35,102,Mikecap42,4.3,"A: Pours a deep amber color with a white head. Beer is clear and see through.  S: Aroma consists of malt, toffee, an caramel.  T: The flavor is definitely malty. The gain bill gives off a wide array of wonderful rich flavors.  MF: This beer as a medium body  O: Soil take on the Oktoberfest style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Perioddicals,4.09,"L - Poured from a glass bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a little cloudy with a red tint. 1-finger head. Minimal lacing  S - The scent comes forward with sweetness. Overall malty caramel  T - The taste is more on the malty side. Definitely sweet as well. A bread taste in there. Light on overall flavors. Biscuit/cracker malts more as I think on it.  F - Medium mouthfeel with medium-to mild carbonation.  O - Overall this is a solid mix of sweetness with malt in an overall pleasing package. Very drinkable, and this is one of my favorite all-around beers. Definitely recommended as I keep it in my regular rotation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Osprey2900,4.34,"Every year I have this and every year I tell myself to buy an extra case or 2 just to keep and have throughout the holidays. This beer is underrated people say it's overly sweet I disagree, I find it to be a delightful beer that I can drink time after time. It's not as heavy as others but imminently drinkable and enjoyable, one of my favorites.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Christianriveraaa,4.07,"Look: Poured from a 12 oz bottled chilled, 2-3 fingers length of foam risen. A little lacing as the beer dissolves. Smell: Notes of caramel, toffee, malts. Taste: Taste followed the smell with less sweetness then the aroma gives off. Really decent beer. Feel: light to medium bodied beer. Overall: Not bad! Was expecting sweeter from reading the reviews here but actually is pretty balanced and not overly sweet.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ATL6245,4.37,"Appearance: Clear amber, frothy off white head with great retention. Medium carbonation.  Aroma: Malt forward with slight floral hops aroma.  Flavor: Malty with toasted bread and spicy hops. Semi-dry; sweet without being overly sweet. Restrained bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Soft & creamy feel.  Overall: Review this beer vs similar ones in style category. I've been drinking this beer for years a just realized I never reviewed it! This is one of SA better versions (2022); as they checked off the Marzen style boxes quite well. Visually pleasing, pouring clear with a big frothy off white head with excellent retention. Has a very pleasant toasty malt & floral hops aroma. Toasty malt and spicy hops flavor. Avoids being overly sweet and finishes drying. Drinks very easy. Clean fermentation profile. No flaws. This is a solid beer especially for the price.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ANIMOUL,4,"Poured from a tap into a beer stein glass at Outback Steakhouse in Fitchburg, MA. Poured orangish brown with minimal head; served colder than probably should've been. Tastes of sweet malt and spices with light cracker taste. Pretty good and expect flavors more enhanced if served warmer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,MadMadMike,3.56,"Tall tap hit at an Applebees. Inch of foam. Orange like a punkin. Smells sweet, nondescript and plain. Tastes OK. Just OK. Caramelly, a light roast is obvious, did I mentally feel and taste syrup? Really? Feel is the salvation. It’s velvety, mid fizz. Overall.,. Mid. Glad I tried it, but I don’t want 3 in a row.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BitteNochEinWeissbier,3.57,"Can(s) Consumed on: 01 Oct, 2022 Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug Serving Temp: 50.4 F   Look: Very dark but clear reddish-copper that comes across as burnished. The head started as 3 fingers of light khaki fizzy foam and quickly dissipated to a thin ring-and-island. Some lacing remains on the glass.  Smell: Sweet, caramelly, and malty. There is a light touch of spice that almost comes across as baking spice(s). There are also some faint notes of hay in the background.  Taste: Mostly a mild but persistent sweet toasted caramel note with some doughy malts backing it up. A very vague hint of spices can be detected if one tries to do so. The hops are dominated by the malts here, but do serve to restrain them somewhat and keep things from becoming sickly sweet. The sip does dry a tad towards the end and finishes malty with a very light spicy note.  Feel: Smooth and soft. A shade sticky. The body is medium.  Overall: A classic. Absolutely drinkable. A fine fall beer. Just not what I look for in a Märzen. It is too sweet for that. And not dry, spicy, and bready enough.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Mindcrime1000,3.5,"Pours fairly amber-ish. Clear. Limited head and lacing.  Aromas of caramel and toasted malts and grassy hops.  Slightly sweet for the style, but checks the boxes on the style flavors. Solid caramel malt flavor balanced by subdued but sufficient grassy and earthy hops.  Thin on the palate, but very drinkable.  Better than mediocre, but mostly just decent. Very drinkable, but completely non-descript.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Brumaster77,4.48,Pours a solid golden amber color with finger or two foamy head. Smells of a toasty caramel scented malt. Tastes the same with smoothness similar to a Irish red but slightly different. An absolute fall classic and is loved by most. There is a reason this is a common draft amongst establishments in the fall. Boston does it well with this Sam Adams seasonal.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Whyteboar,3.68,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint shaker and had to pour in stages as the head was so aggressive. The color was beautiful copper with the manilla colored head, looks enticing. The aroma was ideal for a Märzen style, the malts and caramel and touch of spice, oh, this smelled good. The taste was okay, a letdown after the hard sell- the aforementioned malts were there but rather undefined. It was curious after the aroma was so spot on and the taste just dropped off. Weird. The feel was excellent, no worries there. Smooth and so easy to drink. OA, very strange, parts of this excel but somehow the flavors can’t back the rest up.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jgl55,1.18,"Did I just get a bad batch or do I need a tastebud transplant?  It doesn't even smell or taste like beer. I can't even tell you how it tastes as I can't find the words to do so.  I was drinking Bell's Octoberfest last week. Enjoyed it very much.  Thought I would save a few dollars this week, but ending up throwing away $12.99 for Samuel Adams.  Ugh.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kp7,3.14,"I returned to SA Octoberfest after about 10 years away, and I can't say that the time has done it any favors. I remember a good quality Marzen with a nice flavor profile that, yes, sometimes had its off years, but on the whole was a steady performer in the American O-fest scene.  The only constant from the beer I remember is the great look, a beautiful dark amber. The rest just seems muddled. For me, the taste is a bit off, with a flat malt expression that doesn't have much character or depth, and too much bitterness on the finish. Maybe they've increased the hop bill to meet current tastes? Well it doesn't suite my palate. While nicely medium bodied, it has an unfortunate tendency to syrup-coat your mouth after the swallow.  Would I choose this over a lot of other standard party/bbq offerings? Absolutely. But with so many great, small craft options these days, it might be another 10 years before I buy SA Octoberfest again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,JZH1000,3.79,"Had on tap (alledgedly tapped yesterday) at Hoffbrau Bar and Grill in Westminster, CO  On arrival a fine one finger head was present that relatively quickly dissipated to a ring around the rim and very light covering. Carbonation is lazy and fine in a reddish brown amber body. No lacing.  Aroma has some nice lightly estery Germans tyle lager yeast with a very low hopping rate. A nice nutty roasted malt is peeking its head through pretty aggressively.  Taste is similar to the aroma with a low hopping rate, and a surprisingly flavorful but pleasant German style lager yeast that plays a big role here. Once the fermentation character passes a big wave of nutty roasted malts takes over.  Feel is insanely drinkable with a medium body for easy drinking but a bit more body for that oktoberfest. Very soft and smooth. Not the sweetest but the malts are mouthcoating. On the medium finish it starts drying out a bit.  Overall this is a very nice malty oktoberfest. Flavorful and it tastes German. Very light hops as per style, but it doesn't go great with hoppy amber lagers as I just found out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mwb1100,1.52,"Created an account just to say that I agree with the review posted by ABeingWhoDrinksBeer in Dec 2021.  Overly malty and enough sweetness to ruin the brew. I also get a hint of chocolate, which doesn't work for me in a beer.  Looks good, but that's about it.  Unfortunately, the Pacific Northwest is awash in IPAs, which makes it hard for someone like me who's not a huge IPA fan to find a decent craft beer that isn't an IPA. I spotted this in Costco and figured, ""I like Sam Adams, how bad could this be?"" and proceeded to buy a case of 36 (!) bottles.  I sure hope one of my buddies like this...

35,102,Brook82,3.93,"Bought pint of draft at a minor league ball game, so I paid way too much for a beer. Rich golden, reddish, tan color with off white foam that diminished after a few minutes. Pleasant aroma and taste was malt leading with a smooth finish. Enjoyable brew, would buy a 6 pk for a better deal.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Killgora,4.83,"Might be my favorite beer. I get excited for it every year. Smells of wheat with a slightly sweet malt. Pours an amber color and makes a nice firm head. Has a good solid full bodied, malty, and bready taste. Simple yet strong and hearty. It just screams falls. The weather is cooler, the colors of fall are in full swing. It just screams fall to me which is my favorite time of year. It might not be the most complex flavor but being a Märzen it's not supposed to be. It's simple yet sturdy. Makes me think of light rain on freshly fallen leaves. Put on your jacket sit out on the deck, or porch if you have one and enjoy this beer on a rainy fall day. Just makes me feel at peace when I do.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ABeingWhoDrinksBeer,1.76,"The worst Oktoberfest beer I've had. Smells tolerable... looks fine, but the taste and texture is repulsive. Utterly flat, flavorless, and this weird, artificial viscosity to it that seems artificial. Imagine the people at Sam Adams going ""Let's mass produce an Oktoberfest beer with just malt liquor, caramel color, and thickener"". A strange, sour aftertaste that is reminiscent of rotten tomatoes/pennies. Repulsive. This explains why a 12 pack was on sale for 10 bucks. This is not a good beer. Avoid like the plague.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MaltsOfGlory,3.83,"12oz bottle  Pours over a finger of creamy off-white head into my Boston Lager glass. Retention is wonderful so far, after a few minutes I’ve barely lost any head. Initial lacing looks very nice. Body is a deep orange, nearly brown. Looks great so far.  Nose is deep malts, fresh baked bread, slightly earthy. While I often get a caramel aroma from Oktoberfest’s, something I absolutely don’t mind, apparently it’s “inappropriate” for the style. That said, there is none here, so I guess good ol’ Sam has the most accurate depiction of this beer. The aroma is just super straight forward, clean, and very nice.  Flavor is definitely malty, bready, but not quite as clean. There is something just a tad off too, it almost tastes like tomatoes, which apparently can be a DMS issue. Perhaps a creamed corn flavor too if you look for it. Not bad, certainly rough around the edges though.  Carbonation is about medium. Body is medium-light. A nice small touch of sweetness. Bitterness is low. Mouthfeel is solid, and to style.  Drinkability is nice enough, it tastes decent and it’s pretty balanced.  Appearance turned our great. The head eventually died down, but the lacing was thick down the glass.  The flavor cleaned up a little bit as the beer warmed, those bready flavors replaced the odd ones, but it still wasn’t perfect by any means. Not bad.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BiologyBob,3.31,"Pours with a nice head, but it does not linger. Amber clear in color. It has good flavor, but I expect more malt from an octoberfest. This is drinkable, but fairly mute overall.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,chum_husk,2.99,"Clear, not much head. Smells kinda toasty and malty. Tastes toasty and sweet with a slight hint of hazelnut... doesn't do much to stand out from the sea of similar oktoberfest biers. Very drinkable and forgettable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Coolbreez,2.29,Has Sam Adams changed the formula? This year's Octoberfest does not meet expectations. 12 oz. bottle poured into tumbler. Little head and no lacing. Taste was flat. Disappointed in this beer that I used to enjoy over the years.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MNAle,3.59,"Deep amber, clear, with sparse tiny bubbles rising to a tall, thick, off-white head with excellent retention. Not much lacing.  The aroma is not too strong, but it is quite good. Bready, toasty, with some caramel.  The taste is very malty with lots of bread and caramel. The caramel is more obvious than in the aroma. The flavor carries through to the finish, with just a very slight bittering detected. The aftertaste is, as the initial taste, bready malts with caramel. On the sweet-dry scale, the finish is sweet, but not cloyingly so. The sweetness is well controlled. The overall flavor is pleasant and enjoyable, but relatively straightforward without complexity at all.  The mouth feel is thin, while also being coating.  Overall, I can see why this beer is popular with the public, while also not being a favorite of the beer enthusiast. I am enjoying it, but it wouldn't be a repeat purchase. (I like the Adams Festbier much better. That one I might buy again, if available separately.)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,snaotheus,3.69,"2021-10-30 12oz bottle served in a tulip. January is ticked as the ""enjoy before"" month. I bought it last month.  Pours a brownish amber with a smallish head. Very clear. Smell is mostly grain, and a little earthy.  Taste is grain/toffee/nuts, definite earthiness, and maybe a burnt toffee bitterness.  Mouthfeel is smooth and clean. Overall, it's not terribly exciting, but it's a solid and worthy beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TheOccasionalBeer,3.77,"I haven't had a Sam Adams for ages, and then I think there was a choice of one (possibly two). This poured a transparent copper and developed a one-finger toasted cream head that evaporated quickly. The scent after popping the cap was... well.. generic beer like any macro-brew would give off. Once in the glass, though, I picked up whiffs of vanilla, clove, and nutmeg and a ripe fruit... dare I say pumpkin (certainly seemed more that way then the pumpkin beers I've tried recently). As quickly as the head dissipated, I was surprised to feel some effervescence when it first hit the tongue. A nearly cloying sweetness (like ripe fruit) followed and dominated the flavor initially but settled down to leave a slight bitterness at the end. In some ways it is reminiscent of a hard apple cider.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,JustinClarkHome,3.74,"This is one of favorite Octoberfests. There are others I like more, but this one never disappoints, is easy to find, good from a bottle, better from a tap.

35,102,damnathan,3.21,"Easy to find this time of year. Looks fine. Smells okay. Kinda sweet, but decent taste. Its a beer you wouldn't bitch about if it was the best thing on a menu at a casual dining restaurant. Most usually have Guinness, which I'd take over this, but its a solid beer at the price point.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BigIronH,3.09,"First off, it is a very appealing pour to me at least. Burnt orange almost amber color with an off white head that dissipates in moments to a ring. No lacing to speak of. The head is soft and frothy almost like coffee foam. The aroma is hard to describe. Reading some reviews allowed me to kind of put a finger on what I was getting here. It definitely is a baking soda like smell with some toasted bread and caramel undertones. Honey and citrus rind round out the bill. Taste is honey up front, lingering caramel throughout. Some biscuit or toast undertones, no hop bitterness or floral notes that I can detect. Feel is soft, velvety, and very full. I was impressed with the body as well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Tcricci220,1.35,Looks great nice dark color and clear. That's where the pros end. Has a musty smell of old pennies or something.

35,102,Grounder,3.43,"Is this a malt/sugar/caramel bomb? Damn right it is! Is this anywhere close to a German okto? No way! That said, in a world where craft brewers pump out $10-15 pack of thin and one-dimensional ""our version of marzens"" it remains a safe buy. Not a the best buy, that would be imports, but safe.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MacMalt,3.54,"Poured from bottle into a plastic cup at an outdoor event. It pours a translucent orange-amber with a thin, light khaki head and modest lacing. The nose is subdued but offers notes of caramel and toasted white bread. The taste i on the sweet side with mostly caramel and sweet, bready malt. There is little in the way of nuts, spice or bitterness. Its mouth feel is lite and fairly crisp with a proper level of carbonation and the 5.3% ABV is appropriate. Overall, Sam Adams O-fest is rather one-dimensional. It's rather sweet and lacks the depth or complexity of flavor offered by the better examples of the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,WaterBoar,1.16,This beer is an embarrassment to the Oktoberfest industry. This should not be allowed to be brewed in America. It does not taste anything like Oktoberfest biers.

Not too much one way or the other, it’s an easy drinking beer for late summer into late fall. Semi-sweet, biscuity, with a decent hop backbone to carry those malts. Color is right on—darkish ruby red. If you haven’t tried it, you should. It’s available just about everywhere, in the US at least.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,German-Helles,4.18,"The last one in the frig, I went through plenty of these this fall. This is a 12oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. This Marzen started off with over one finger of tan foam over a medium amber clear beer. The carbonation is very steady, the head slowly settled to a nice solid cap with slight lacing left behind. The aroma is very noticeable from a distance, a nice sweet bread malt. Just what I hope for from a Marzen! The flavor is as good as it looks sweet malts up front, with minimal hops on the end to cut the sweetness for a very good finish. The feel surprises me, it leans toward the creamy side and the carbonation is noticeable also. This is one of the better Oktoberfests, a solid Marzen. I wonder if Sam and the rest of the sons of liberty sampled a few of these before there famous night down on the Boston Harbor?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,1009,3.79,I’ve really become a fan of Marzen style beers this fall and Sam Adams rarely disappoints. This was a malty smooth fest beer with a delightful dark almost reddish color.

35,102,datstankadank,2.12,"Served on draught, 2 finger cream head, dark orange beer. Smell matches the taste; complete malt bomb.. and not in a good way. Quite possibly the worst marzen ive ever had, hops are not noticeable whatsoever. Sickly sweet, one dimensional unbalanced marzen. Cloying sweetness overpowers your palate and its really a task to complete a pint of this. Big fan of their boston lager but just about every other offering of theirs is subpar if not lower.

It was hot for October 97 degrees (36 Celsius), so this thirst quenching Märzen / Octoberfest came in handy, Samuel Adams Octoberfest, ABV 5.30, IBU 16. I know Octoberfest is over with and it was canceled anyway, but I am celebrating a belated Octoberfest in my backyard that will probably last until December. The flavor is toasted bread, nuts, caramel, maybe mild grassy hops.

The cream-white head is less than 1 inch but hangs around for a while and leaves a bit of lace. Malty caramel and a bit of spice makes up the moderate strength nose. Malt forward and semi-sweet to taste, caramel with spicy and floral hop flavor being more pronounced at the dry finish. The body is medium light with high carbonation that seems to keep it from being creamy. Though I don’t seek this one out I have drank plenty of it over the last couple of decades.

Thin head that dissipates quickly probably again due to the temperature. Aroma is malt - caramel and toasty and flavor follows suit. Little disappointed that the flavor doesn't last, not much on the finish. It seems to lack the crisp bitterness that you get from the Boston Lager.

I tried smelling this beer and really didn't detect anything. I suppose a little malty. I don't have the best sense of smell. The actual taste ... Okay. I find it a little too sweet. This beer leaves me feeling like the head. Hardly any and then it disappears. The carbonation is quite low. Not quite but a bit of a syrupy feel. Part of me feels guilty. I really think I just don't like the style. Like the beers that have cherries thrown into the brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Even some red hop citrus on the end (4.00)  Flavor: Strong flavors of rich butter caramel and toffee brown bread. Touch of red citrus on the finish. Yet it finishes nice and dry. Absolutely delicious rich and roasty flavors without being too strong or sweet. (4.50)  Overall: One of the better Oktoberfests I've tried this year. Fantastic, delicious, rich German flavors without being too sweet. I'd say this one ranks among the best American Marzens I've had for the year. (Final Rating: 4.08) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2020-2022  Appearance: Pours a clear, deep amber color with a strong off-white head. SRM of 14-15. (4.25)  Aroma: Moderate to strong aromas of bread, spiced caramel, sweet bread, brown sugar, toffee. There's some red citrus, vanilla, and cherry notes that come through in the middle. A malty finish with some more vanilla, cherry, and caramel on the end.  Flavor: Moderate flavors of caramel malts, cherry, vanilla. A little grassiness and toasted bread in the middle. Some red citrus before a caramel and cinnamon roll flavored finish. Leans sweet and malty. Has a faint cherry/amber flavor that lingers and reminds me of a red ale. (4.25)  Feel: Medium-bodied, but strong carbonation and hop bitterness to clean the palate of the malts. Finishes actually rather dry for the body. On the finish, red hop citrus to bitter at the end like last year. (4.00)  Compared to Odell Oktoberfest 10/1/20: Pours a darker, more amber color. Stronger aromas of red fruit hops. More cherry and cream. Not more alcohol though. Less bread and smoothness. Winner: Sam Adams  Compared to Victory Brewing's Oktoberest 10/14/20: Pours a similar color. More caramel, brown sugar, sweet bread. Less grassiness, lemon, and tartness. It's overall sweeter.  Compared to Sam Adams Boston Lager 11/12/12: Pours similar but slightly more amber color. Extremely similar aromas/flavors of toasty bread, red citrus, whipped cream, caramel, pie crust, grass, and pine. Difficult to differentiate on the aroma. Maybe if we're pulling hairs this one has slightly more red citrus and less brown bread. Slightly more red citrus, grass, German bread. Slightly more Ale flavor?  Compared to Sam Adams Winter Lager 12/22/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. Stronger aromas here with more toasted caramel, brown bread, toffee, and cherry/vanilla cream.  Compared to Odell Oktoberfest 10/19/21: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More red cherry, cream, and cinnamon roll. Less smooth malt?  Compared to Great Lakes Oktoberfest 12/30/21: Pours a slightly darker color. Maltier aromas. More malty caramel, brown sugar, cherry, and spice. Less hoppy German bread and noble hops. More malt focused and darker.  Compared to Breckenridge Brewery's Oktoberfest: Pours a similar color with a larger head. More caramel, vanilla, cherry, and red citrus notes.  Compared to 3 Sheeps Oktoberfest 9/5/22: Pours a lighter color. Stronger aromas. Less smooth bread, earthy Munich malt, lemon/citrus flower, cooked vegetables. More red citrus and cherry spice.  Compared to Great Lakes Oktoberfest 9/5/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. Less smooth bread, pale malts. More red citrus and cherry spice. Darker.  Compared to Summit Oktoberfest 9/5/22: : Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. Less smooth bread, pale malts. More red citrus and cherry spice. Darker, similar sweetness.  Compared to La Dona Oktubrefest 9/22/22: Pours darker, stronger aromas. More cherry/amber malt, cinnamon roll, vanilla icing. Less Rye bread and vienna malt. Slightly sweeter.  Compared to Left Hand Oktoberfest 9/22/22: Pours darker, similar aromas. More cherry/amber malt, cinnamon roll, vanilla icing. Less caramel and sweet brown bread malt. Dryer and cleaner, but same amount of flavor.  Overall: This is again one of the stronger, darker, and better American Marzen beers. Rich flavor with a strong amount of red fruit hoppy bitterness/spice. Not exactly true to the festbier code, and more like the Sam Adams Boston Lager with just more hopped-up red citrus, grass, and bread. Slightly less brown/malty.

A decade later and it's still a favorite. I like almost every beer that calls itself an oktoberfest , but I still haven't found one I enjoy more than this. It's light years ahead of the Boston Lager.  Edit: Had to lower my score a bit after realizing I prefer the German Oktoberfest beers. I still think this one is really good but it's bit too sweet which makes it difficult to enjoy more than one at a time. I also think this beer only tastes good when it warms up.

After having several of these at various temperatures up to 55F, I concluded that the beer lacks a mouth-filling malty body that I'd expect of a fest beer. Flavor was primarily sugary sweet, with inadequate hop character to balance.  I found this beer hard to drink. I ended up mixing in a few ounces of a bitter pale lager into a bottle of this octoberfest. The result cures the hop deficit and also goes a long way to hide the lack of malt body.  Update August, 2020. I think the beer is better balanced than the above review (16 IBU stated). There is minimal head retention. Mouthfeel is slightly astringent. More drinkable than the 2017 review.

I taste a slightly sweet version of the smell, as expected with the malts. Quite a clean finish for a richer brew.  Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.  I'll go ahead and rate Samuel Adams Octoberfest | Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams) with a 4.5",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The taste follows with sweet toasted caramel from front to back. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and undry.

As with most Sam Adams brews, this one is a session beer, not challenging to the palate, that goes great with the season. With fairly understated flavor at the outset, it's got an excellent finish and an aftertaste like a baked good that will put you in the autumn spirit. It's best on tap, but for some reason I prefer it out of the can as opposed to out of the bottle.

35,102,Pantalones,3.71,"Second-to-last bottle from my six-pack. Best-by date is March of 2017, so should still be pretty fresh.  Color is a burnt-orange sort of thing, one of the darker Oktoberfest beers I've had. Very clear, with a ton of little rising bubbles throughout and a very nice layer of cream-colored foam on top. Really nice-looking beer!  Smell is pleasant, though not standing out as much as the appearance. There's a definite sweetness in the background, a toasty bread/doughy sort of thing coming in ahead of that, and occasionally a little hint of hop spiciness (this is far from a hoppy beer of course, but they are present.)  Most prominent flavors on the first sip are toasty bread and that doughy sort of thing. The sweetness from the smell is not as noticeable in the flavor, though still there in the background. Same goes for that slight hop spiciness, it's juuust barely there.  Mouthfeel is pretty nice overall, though I do have some minor complaints. Very drinkable, seems maybe a tad thin at some times (mostly after the foam has started to shrink away.) Despite the massive amount of rising bubbles in this beer it never seems overly prickly, just has a nice soft bubbliness to it.  Overall, not my favorite Oktoberfest (last year's Sierra Nevada still holds that title so far) but a surprisingly good one considering all the hate it seems to get -- I was honestly really impressed when I had my first bottle from this six-pack, especially after reading so many posts describing it as overly sweet (I didn't find it to be *that* sweet at all.) I have had it before, but it was a month or so past its best-by date and was not as good as the fresher version (though still not bad -- I guess this is a malty enough beer to begin with that it holds up better to age compared to a lot of others), so I figured I should revisit it -- glad I did!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

This is a decent beer, it's a little sweet for my taste, so a ""have one"" and move on to something else.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,BloodSoakedAleMug,1.74,"Decided to give this a try since I do enjoy their boston lager from time to time, but man, this is pretty lousy.  L: Pours a translucent orange color with a one finger, beige head that fizzles away immediately leaving no lacing.  S: Very faint notions of caramel, brown sugar, corn, green apples and honey.  T: Acetaldehyde is detectable upfront. Very bland and watery. Sweet throughout with flavors of caramel and apples. Off putting, dirty, grassy taste of wet hay and hose water from a rusty spigot on the finish.  F: Watery. Thin and under carbonated. Quite saccharine and sickly sweet, definitely not my cup of tea.  O: Way too watery and green apple-y for my palate with nothing really to balance it out. Also there's a nasty aftertaste on the finish. Really disappointed in this, expected it to at least be somewhat decent.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Bierliebhaber3,3.74,"This marzen pours a brownish orange color with a somewhat thin white foamy head. The smell is mild, but it is a nice balance of roasted grains and caramel malt scents and some spicy hops. The taste is similar, roasted grains, caramel, spicy, slightly ascerbic hops that come together to make a nice balanced beer. The finish is semi-dry. The body is somewhere between light and medium, and it’s actually lighter than I would have guessed. This is kind of a classic fall Sam Adam’s beer. It’s a really nice drinkable, balanced beer. Nothing too complex, but my only real criticism would be that I would like the body to be a little heavier.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Other than that the nose is pretty light without a lot of character.  Taste is roasted malts with a hint of caramel sweet. The taste is like the nose and by that I mean there does not seem to be a lot of complexity here. That being said the taste is of a good beer and I do like the simple roasty flavor.  Mouth feel is slightly thick and chewy, I would call it a nice medium mouth feel.  Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It did seem a bit strange to be sipping on this beer while it was 100 degrees outside. However this beer did make me long for our cooler fall days coming up.

Although you've had some good times this summer, it's a bit of a let down to see it end. One of the good things about this time of year helping to lift your spirits is the availability of the Oktoberfest beers. A lot of people have them, and they're all good.  I had been drinking light beer and shandies all summer whilst gardening and grilling in the hot sun, but I got a call from Precious. She was at Costco and wanted to know if I wanted some Samuel Adams Octoberfest. I said, ""Hell, Yeah!"" So I've got a 28 pack cooling. This stuff even tastes great warm.  It pours out a medium copper color very clear with a little more head than I expected. It has a great taste and great feel. Note that I hadn't had an IPA or anything stronger than 4% since March.

35,102,teromous,2.94,"I don't see an actual bottle date but FEB is notched in the side of the label.  Appearance: Somehow this poured without any head at all. I can see a ton of bubbles popping on the surface of the beer but what happened to the head? The body of the beer is actually quite dark for an Oktoberfestbier. It has a deep brown and orange color with hints of dark burnished gold. Good clarity. Obviously no retention or lacing on a beer that never even had a head.  Aroma: There is a nice sweet smelling caramel aroma that is light. A touch of buttered toffee. No hop aroma.  Taste: The overall flavor profile of this beer is very light but there are a few good flavors within the wispy plane of near non-existence. There is a light bread flavor with a touch of caramel and a touch of nuttiness with a light fruity finish.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation and very drinkable.  Overall: This beer is average at best and I really wouldn't recommend it when there are much better beers in this style being produced domestically (to the U.S.) and imported. I am especially disappointed as I thought Boston Beer Company would have produced a much better lager. If you ended up with this beer at some point there is no doubt you would be able to finish it but it will leave you sadly unfulfilled.

Mouthfeel: light and mildly carbonated; it finishes semi-dry, crisp, refreshing, and pleasing.  This is an above-average beer, yet it's not worth the price per twelve-pack or six-pack, in my opinion. I find it to be just a tad bit too mild.

35,102,Squire,3.74,"Appearance is of deep golden amber with bountiful white cap and good lacing.  Aroma is malt foremost, caramel, toffee malt in the sweet sense without hop sharpness.  Flavor is full on malt with depth and richness. This is full flavored and it's good flavor. I get little hop presence on entry, mid palate, or in the finish which is clean and short. Hops are there but too shy to give more than a glimpse of their presence. There is a residual darker malt sweetness (molasses?) in the aftertaste that doesn't linger very long.  Texture is medium to full depending on your perspective.  Overall this is a very flavorful beer packed with malt sensations that range from light through rich to dark with an underlying sweetness that isn't really there, just the sense of it due to the lack of hop sharpness to moderate the full on malt flavor. All malt flavor, like all hop flavor, can leave a brew with a feeling of one noteness though this one does bring some complexity to the table. Not of sustaining interest to the beer enthusiast perhaps but a good one for general consumers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Beginner2,3.89,"Had Sam Adams' (SA's) O-fest several times. Yet now reviewed side-by-side with a much higher rated O-fest (Great Lakes).... I cannot be sure why they are not rivals. Clearly, GL's relies more on hops for a drier finish, a clear play to the American palate. But, SA's O-fest clearly demonstrates why this is such a favorite lager style of those who prefer balance and malts.  While SA's rendition Looks slightly above average (a rich-Looking amber), it clearly offers those caramel-malty Smells; yet its judicious use of hops prevent this marzen from becoming sweet as many in this style do. Designed to drink in tall and big glasses, the O-fest from SA hits this traditional spot for Fall.  10/12/20 Had yet again. I took this opportunity to quickly review the 21 beers I've reviewed from Sam Adams and noticed two things. First, my reviews -- and probably my tastes -- are more sophisticated since I visited SA's ales early in my career. Second, SA has a very balanced portfolio of beers... which probably goes a long way to explain their success.  Finally, SA's O-fest looks to me to be the most popular marzen in the world (often twice as many as the competition, per UnTappd uniques and total.) SA's recipe is good, but its marketing and distribution is the best.  At any rating, I've revised my O-Fest review and am satisfied with it. So I am keeping count over at UnTappd.

S: Very bready on the first whiff. There is strong notes of toast and a hint of dark sweetness; it gives one the sense of autumn, which is appropriate. Underneath all of this there is a strange spice scent adding complexity.  T: Despite the heavy bread scent the bread flavor is not as prevalent as one would expect. Malt is strong throughout. The spice notes are more noticeable in the taste. Throughout there is a slight toast and sweetness flavor.  M: Not to carbonated with a medium body. Smooth all the way down leaving some sweetness on the palate.  O: Drinkable, approachable, and unoffensive.

Smell - Plenty of grain, specifically some corn, aromas of autumn. Some slightly vegetative aromas, but nothing offputting.  Taste - Clean, lots of grain with some caramel sweet notes, bitterness is subdued. Traces of a spice flavor. Again tastes like fall.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, clean, moderate body and modest carbonation.  Overall - Decent Oktoberfest beer, far from the best butr far from the worth. Easy to drink and no off-flavors.

Absolutely not. A great seasonal go-to beer that won't empty your wallet.  Look is a brilliant, crystal-clear orange/copper hue that lights up nicely in the right lighting. Moderate carbonation leaves a decent little head that leaves a bit of lacing after it dissipates.  Smell is of warm, roasty malts. Maybe a little hop spice.  Tastes how it smells. A nice malty taste with a bit of spicy noble hop finish. Maybe a fruit (pear?) note. Pleasing malty/bready aftertaste. Mouthfeel is prickly from the carbonation.

It lingered and was a little sticky. I expected more from this. I kept waiting for the Oktoberfest characteristics to come out, but they never really did.

A fairly sweet beer with dominant flavorings of roasted malts. Notes of caramel are present, especially on the back-end/ aftertaste it leaves.  M - Medium to full bodied beer, quite rich feeling. A decent blend of carbonation though slightly harsh for me. Very crisp beer.  O - First Oktoberfest style beer I've had before; wasn't sure what to expect buy enjoyed it very much.

Not a tremendous amount of visible carbonation.  Smell is toasted malt, a bit of caramel, bready, a bit of biscuit. Faint hints of maple (or maybe I just want to smell maple because of the season), light milk chocolate, and noble hop aroma--light grassy, hay. Nice.  Taste is light, refreshing. Aspires to creaminess, but there's a bit of astringency. Still, this is malt forward, sweet, toasty, biscuity. Slight lagery yeastiness, tanginess. Again, a bit of a crisp grassiness or hay flavour. Body is surprisingly light, and the carbonation moderate.  Seems fairly on-point for the style, but can't compete with some of the true German renditions. Still, it's nice, refreshing, pretty clean.

35,102,Wer34truh,2.76,"A quite opaque beer with a distinct amber color. Limited head that dissolves quickly.  Smells very much like one would expect from an Octoberfest. Toasty and floral scent.  I feel like the carbonation entirerly dominates this beer, so much so that any additional flavor is in the background. Which is a huge shame since this could be quite a compelling beer. After the carbonation-boom, it's quite subtle - but that might be attributed to the fact that the initial kick numbs your buds.

35,102,Strat58cat,3.84,"It's amazing that the bouquet of Octoberfest (sorry, years of drinking wine before recently returned to craft beer) actually has a note that is reminiscent of pumpkin. Very appropriate. Octoberfest specifically and the Boston Beer Company in general need to be appreciated for their unique craft paradigm. Octoberfest is the antithesis of a hoppy IPA, actually featuring far less hops than Sam's trademark Boston Lager. It's all about the malt. The aroma is malt-driven. The beer is thick and rich. The five malts featured here show so clearly. It's hopped just enough to provide the requisite neutrality. It's neither bitter nor cloyingly sweet, but rich. The flavors are as unique in today's marketplace as in 1989. This beer is 15 IBU, not 65 like the starkly different Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA. Variety is the spice of life, and this autumn brew is subtle. This is a really old-school, five-malt, more traditional than the Germans (now serving Helles at Oktoberfest in Munich) hyper-quality-malt beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

This has been one of my favorite Octoberfest beers for over 2 decades, and I think it holds its own with the German marzens I've tried. None of them has had a stronger malt backbone.

This one has a mild 5.3% ABV. Let’s see what I noticed.  Look-It pours a clear and rich copper amber color that reminds me of the red/orange brown of the leaves that fall in autumn. The large head settles into a thin film quickly and leaves moist fine lacing on the glass.  Smell-It smells of toffee and caramel malts slightly. There is a bit of spiciness on the nose as well.  Taste-It has a fluid flavor with a slightly more noticeable hop component which was surprising. The hops paired well with the spices like nutmeg which I picked up on.  Mouthfeel-This medium-bodied beer has low carbonation and a slight lingering coating on the tongue with a sweetness that is appropriate.  Overall-It is a standard Octoberfest beer, but coming from Sam Adams it has a bit more grassy hops in it than the other Octoberfest beers that I have tried.

35,102,JohnnyI,3.31,"There's really not much that is truly remarkable about this beer. A very safe Sam Adams interpretation of the style. The semi-opaque, copper colored liquid does bring a whisper of Autumn and the changing of the leaves. Beyond that, it's a decidedly average beer. Quite sessionable actually, with a nice mix of pleasant, yet tame qualities. Oddly though, there is a metallic twang to this beer that I can't quite explain. In that respect, it's reminiscent of an adjunct lager drank straight from a can (which I occasionally find enjoyable). However, the buttery diacetyl flavor, tangy bite and mild amber malt characteristics give this beer much more character than your average BMC. The light spices that poke through on the finish are a nice touch that keep you coming back for more. Quite an interesting beer. It simultaneously manages to be innocuous and common, yet has just enough character and style to keep you going back for more. I guess that's why Sam is among the kings of craft.

It's a better choice than Blue Moon.  Appearance: Light amber, one finger off-white head, bubbles rising to the surface slowly, like seltzer water.  Aroma: Light, almost imperceptible fragrance of bitterness, some (very miniscule) sweetness.  Taste: Well, it's a Sam Adams. It actually doesn't taste much like an Octoberfest, truth be told. A little grain, a little sweetness, not much else. It's certainly a passable brew, but nothing to write home about.  Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation, some bitter aftertaste. Medium-bodied.  Overall: I would take this beer over other drafts at a local steakhouse, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out.

S - Strong malt aroma with caramel notes. Also grainy tones with no discernible hops. Smells like an Octoberfest lager should!  T - Tastes of sweet maltiness with some grain, caramel, and lager flavor. This beer is like a traditional German lager beer but with more body and flavor. No distinct bitterness or hops but it isn't cloying.  M - Medium to light mouth-feel. Moderate carbonation. The sweetness is predominant but is still crisp on the finish which makes it very drinkable.  Overall, this is a great commercial beer that I look forward to having at least once every year.

I must admit, I rate my Oktoberfest's and Pumpkin Ale's in opposing methods: for Pumpkin beers: the less intense the pumpkin and spices, the better for Marzen beers: the more intense the experience, the better  Well balanced, with a friendly hint of spice and apples, his Oktoberfest lacked the finishing punch for me.

35,102,CalgaryFMC,3.7,"Enjoyed a pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A dark reddish bronze with a finger or so of beige creamy head. Aroma of rich toasty malts and fresh green grapes, almost whiskey-like, sweet toffee with a light whiff of yeast. Classic o-fest, really. Body is on the thin side and the carbonation is intense, but in getting past these aspects one can find some toasted bread crust, sultana, light molasses, apples, pears, and even some faint citrus. Weighted towards the crisp, dry, and toasty, not particularly sweet, particularly in the finish. This may not have as much of the classic German malt character you get in some old world examples, but there is a solid noble hop flavor and the rich, deep flavors edge out some of the European examples in my view.

This, to me, is just a muted version of the Boston Lager. I get that initial sweetness, caramel, toffee -- as I do from the lager -- but then I'm waiting for the complexity and bitterness at the end that I'm accustomed to...but it doesn't come.

Light medium body with a somewhat slick texture. Above average carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. The taste profile is reasonably balanced and complex, but has an aftertaste that is metallic. It begins with a light caramel sweetness that flows into a mild bitterness. The middle is mostly mineral in nature over a light hop spiciness. Throughout the profile is a metallic undercurrent that rises to the forefront in the finish and lingers as an off flavor. Having had this many times in the past, this version is sub par. I'll consume the rest of the 6 pack and adjust this review as warranted.

Pours amber with a fair amount of head.  Caramel notes come through, sweet, not a lot going on in the aroma department. Of course do any Marzen's?  Taste: Fairly mundane, I really don't know why I keep buying these beers. They really don't have a lot going on, but I get into the whole seasonal kick of trying new styles. I personally think they are heavy lagers, (which they are) but that is what I do like about a lager, they are crisp. These are just too sweet for my personal palate. Sam is alright, I have had better but none in my opinion are outstanding beers. However, I do know people who love this style and hate the IPA's and stouts that I love.

35,102,MikeyBadnews,4,"Sam Adams Octoberfest.  I'll probably catch a lot of crap from the beer snobs but I expect it to be overridden by mass adulation from the people in my area (boston) for how high I rate this, and granted my views are skewed by a nostalgic feel this beer gives me, but I think this is a tremendous Americanized interpretation of the classic German Marzen for which it’s styled after. I don’t have a lot of other beers of this style to compare it to so maybe it’s the absolute bottom feeder of it’s class, but we’ll overlook my naivety and just focus on the beer itself.  One of Sam Adams more popular seasonal brews Octoberfest pours a dark ruby red that softly fades into a medium bodied copper. Poured at a finger and a half head into an Octoberfest styled dimpled beer mug (thanks Michele) my nostalgic side takes over as the summer humidity is immediately sucked from the room and the crisp apple picking morning fall air is ushered in in a zephyr of fall winds with the falling autumn leaves dropping at my feet, Glorious!  Beer has a chewy citrus to toffee flavor that finishes thick and sticks to the pallet and throat. Tastes like a 1 pm Sunday afternoon football kickoff…. Or a caramelized sugar coated and pan fried pear chased with heavy malts. Smell is similar and quite appeakling  To me this beer *IS* fall. Popping open a can or bottle of this closes the door on BBQs and beach parties. Days at the pool and drenching humidity and ushers in football, leaf raking, frosted morning windshields and hoodie weather.

S- The aroma of this brew is pure sweetness! Tons of malt action going on that is well accented by some caramel notes . The scent is not offensive in any way and is actually quite inviting!  T- Much of the taste is similar to the aroma but without the sweetness. Lots of malt notes going on along with the caramel notes that are accompanied by some interesting toffee/taffy-like flavours in the aftertaste (think salt water taffy). Incredibly delicious and very satisfying.  M- Low-Medium carbonation that is appropriate for the style. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick but not chewy by any standards: Very nice indeed..  O- Samuel Adams Octoberfest, although being my first taste into the Oktoberfest style, was an enjoyable experience to say the least. Not only is the beer nice to look at but it holds some beautiful aromas and tastes that leave you in satisfaction. This brew is easily my favourite Lager and also my new favourite Samuel Adams beer!

A thick two finger head with good retention and carbonation.  Smell- Smells of a fresh bready malt with sweet caramel notes in the background. A bit of peppery spice as well.  Taste- Sweet malty flavor with caramel and a bit of sugar prominent. Some dryness in the back end with a touch of corn as well which tells you this is still a lager if you weren't already aware octoberfest are. Finishes smooth with the ever so slightest detection of hops.  Mouthfeel- Nice carbonation. The beer is thin but has enough taste that it is not watery. Easy drinking.

35,102,hopman333,3.67,"Ok, the first O - Fest of the season and I usually do not like Sam Adam's version but I had to pick it up anyway's. Pleasantly surprised here as well.  My first bottle out of the sixer was not that cold but cool enough, the suspense was killing me and it was my first beer of the day. Upon cracking her open I did the usual one nostril to the neck of the bottle and sniffed repeatedly . Nice caramel / Tootsie Roll and clean noble hop aroma mix. Immediately noticed none of the old aromas I used to find and dislike about this brew.  The color was a beautiful Marzen deep caramel hue that fits the style perfectly. Enough said on with the flavor.  It starts out with a nice prickly carbonation that tingles the tongue in a good way and then quickly shifts to a beautiful harmony of sweet ( but not cloying at all ) caramel malts and a spicy noble hop bite that upon swallowing kind of reminds you of a Boston Lager but slightly richer in malt character then the latter. I used to REALLY DISLIKE this beers overly rich and earthy maltiness and ZERO hops to balance it out. It used to have a very dark coconutty flavor that was not really toasty but just plain Blah !!! . This years batch is balanced, refreshing and just sooo easy to drink, that how I like my O - Fests. One of my favourites is Paulaner and this is much closer in terms of mouthfeel and drinkability to some of it's German counterparts. They definitely improved and tweaked this year's batch BIG TIME. Now it's a true drinkable fest beer that used to suffer from a way to deep and dark maltiness with zero balance.  If your an O - Fest fan like myself you should for sure pick up a sixer this year.

Pours a lovely amber with clarity and a huge very light-tan head, with good retention, pulling some decent lace down the glass. Nice aroma of mild caramel malt and hop spice off pour, soon joined by mild floral and sweet stone fruit aromas. A little carbonation up front delivers sweet, mild caramel malt, over a middling-to-light body, which is soon complemented by a little hop spice, and a little of that underlying fruitiness, perhaps a bit like honey, with all carrying into a nice crisply hoppy finish.

UPDATE 9/14/16: Two came in the new Fall Variety Pack, which I purchased because it has four I have not tried.

Sweet, ready-to-bake bread dough and yeast on the nose. No hop aroma. Not many beers could get away with this, but an Oktoberfest can.  T- Sweet malt followed by more sweet malt, followed by... You get the idea. Not as sweet as other marzen-style beers, but oh yeah, it's there in abundance.  M- Perfect for the style. Not too thin, but highly quaffable, and you know your not drinking a sissy yellow beer.  O- I'm a bit partial toward this brew, as it was one of my first ""micros"" way back in 2005.

It appeared quite red but remarkably clear with a thick tan head that looked almost perfect.  Aroma was that of bittersweet balance, the maltiness commingled with the aroma hops to make your nose want to drink this beer.  Taste was incredibly well balanced, a wash of sweet pale malt and dark caramel malts, which balanced well with what seemed to be a moderate mix of noble hops, and what I think were hallertau hops. The two played off each other to make one of the best balanced beers I could have imagined.

This one has great color for the style, but I would like to see a bit more head (or at least one that sticks around longer).  Smell: Some good sweet malty smells coming out. No hop presence in the nose, which is good due to the style restrictions.  Taste: I realized tonight that I was drinking this one too cold. I had one that had been in the fridge for only 1.5-2hrs and it was like a totally different beer. Nice maltiness with a good, sweet backbone comes out when this one is served a little warmer than what I had been having. Still a bit sweet for my tastes, but less so than when the beer is colder and you taste more sweet than malt.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation and body for the style. This beer drinks smooth and easy, just like an Oktoberfestbier should.  Overall: Overall, a decent shot at the style. Respectable, but not special.

Aroma: sweet, malty nose, earthy & herbal.  Taste: Mmm. Tasty malts, bright and pleasant. Noble hops play a minor roles, giving just enough bite to stave off sweetness. Oh, it's a sweet one, but not overly so. Medium-light body, with the malty flavor lasting long on the palate.  A right on the money marzen. What does the label tell us? ""In 1810, Munich celebrated the wedding of their crown prince with a special beer. After 16 days the party ended, but the tradition continues.

This is a worthy enough beer to obtain positive feedback, despite my animosit towards the Boston brewery.  A- pretty decent looking beer here. Nice red color similar to the color of New Castl . Werewolf, with a much better head. Head isn't really much for conversation though... kindashy. Lacings not the best but what I would expect from Sam.  S- nice and sweat like an angelfood cake. Has some pumpkin in there with a lil ccinnamon and nutmeg. Really great smell for a fall beer but a wee bit counterproductive considering that this is labeled Oktoberfest. (Just because October is in the name doesn't mean we harvest crops for beer.)  T- regardless what the label says, this is a good tasting beer. Completely identicalto ssmell and very malty and nice and bready. Well balanced with some spice on the aftermath. Can't complain.  M- mouthfeel is a little heavy bodied but not too much considering the appearance. Between medium and heavy I guess. Chewy, but... just a smidge.  O- overall this beer deserves a try out. See for yourself that I AM right about this one. This will turn a micro-brewery junkies head in a heart beat.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I happened to try this particular offering last Sunday for the 1st time this year. The wife prepared some pork chops with baked sweet potatoes. OMG. This Octoberfest paired with that meal, especially the sweet potatoes, was pure Nirvana. We immediately planned to have friends over in a few weeks just so we can entertain this Samuel Adams Octoberfest with the pork and sweet potato. It is Slap-Yo-Mama Good. Overall, the beer itself is good but what makes a beer is, IMHO, the meal it compliments. The point is the beer is good, but with the right meal, on the right day, THAT is what makes the experience.

I'm not a big fan of the characteristic Sam Adams carbonation scheme so I'm knocking it on mouthfeel. However, I love the color and the taste is solid, particularly on tap.

I'm not much into cans, I really turn my nose up to them, but when the wife goes out and buys your beer you take what you get and you like it. :) In this case, I got lucky. Out of the can (I can't believe I'm writing that) I found the brew to be absolutely stunning - dark amber colored beer with a lightly tanned head. The head has great staying power with good lacing all the way down the glass. The smell was a roasted or toasted malt - rich, deep, and lightly sweet. I've had other Sam Adams and found them to be to carbonated for my taste, but Octoberfest was just at the right level of carbonation (IMHO). I could taste what I smelled - which is always a plus to me - and there was some distant sweetness to the beer.

Tasted is grans and malty depth with a crisp instead of heavy character. It's a little buttery and has a slightly slick mouthfeel. It does taste a bit like popcorn. Body si creamy but has plenty of carbonation to bite a little. There is a nice little spice character in the finish.  Finishes almost dry and with some nutty and earthy malts. Has a nice toasted quality but not much sweetness and the spice stays faint even though it does present a bit more on the nose an don the palate as the beer warms. My criticism of the taste is that buttery quality. I don't like it on the palate or in the mouthfeel. It has a sour little under taste and together with the buttery flavor is just not what I want.

Again, pretty light-bodied, but at least it doesn't have any strong sweetness from the malts, which I normally don't enjoy.

Expectations are average, based on the brewery. I tend to find a lot of Samuel Adams beers to be very similar and boring.  Poured into a clear balloon snifter glass.  A - Pours about the same as the Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale. One finger of off-white head dissipates quickly. Body color is a dark chestnut / ruby color  S - Smells pretty nice. Crisp toasted malts, earthy, nutty, creamy. Soft notes of caramel and toffee. Hint of wine-like red grape presence. Has some of that strange buttery creamy popcorn smell that I found in Southern Tier Pumking.  T - Taste is of crisp toasted malts, cream, earthiness, nuttiness, maybe some dark cherries & raisins, leafy hops, and some light herbal spice.  M - Feel is crisp and clean with some light breadiness & nuttiness lingering on the palate. Ideal carbonation.  Overall, a lot better than expected, when you really sit down to enjoy it. A simple, classic, fresh representation of the style, and that is quite enough to satisfy me.

There's not too much of a difference between the two but on tap is better. I'd like to try the can soon but not really in a rush to. For me, Sam Adams Octoberfest is one of the few beers I get excited for when its released in ""season"". So much I like to buy in bulk and store it for months after when its Alpline Spring time or even Summer Ale of the next year. Appearance-wise it has a golden brown color to it when poured. Almost like if they were to blend Autumn leaves into their beer. Very distinctive and easy to spot for me. Just a good sign my favorite season of Fall is around the corner. Smell-wise it has a very malty German lager smell to it. Very malty and sweet with a hint of bitterness to it. Very well balanced. Taste-wise Sam's Octoberfest has a lot of German influences in it. Full, malty, ecstatic for the taste buds, and with a hint of bitterness. To me just a perfect beer that tastes great and goes down very smoothly. In the mouth its very refreshing and malty with a hint of bitterness while leaving you wanting more. Very smooth and full. Overall Sam Adams Octoberfest is one of my top 5 beers.

There's also a little hop coolness that helps to balance things out. Also a hint of clove and sometimes a slightly metallic twang.

T - Much more subtle than I remember. I was worried about being overwhelmed by the malt character, but it actually works really well. The sweetness is present, but not overpowering. Similar flavors to the smell.  M - Nothing exciting. Medium bodied, actually a little watery.  O - I've really enjoyed this beer with food.

As such, I have lowered my rating several times in an attempt to rate this beer not just in terms of how much I like it on its own, but also its standing within its (particularly well-defined and storied) genre.  Almost no detectable hop aroma. The malts are great-- big and sweet. Mouthfeel is similarly malty and partially coating. However, where I feel this falls short of other 'Fests is the complete lack of both bittering hop character (which should be minimal, but present) and noble hop flavor. This could have been brewed with a similar amount of Cascade without a noticeable effect...if there are nice German hops in here, you wouldn't know it.  Drinkable and tasty but one-dimensional and tiresome.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,VictorWisc,3.88,"It looks like I'm the first to review the canned version (no bottle experience for comparison--I've had it in bottles, but over 5 years ago and avoided it since).  Pours very nice dark amber with ample medium-grained tan-orange head that does not stick around. No visible carbonation in the glass (aside from the head); some lacing, but fairly minor.  Smells distinctly of malt with a clear burnt orange note. Dank acidic smell follows.  Taste is a similar combination of sweet and toasted malt, orange and an additional note of cooked winter squash (or pumpkin). This turns into a briny feel on the back of the tongue with a fairly acrid finish of burnt wood and characteristics of medium-rye bread, but sweet malt finish. Once the malt clear, the orange and squash return in aftertaste and linger for a while, along with what feels like fermented corn.  Medium bodied with strong carbonation--nothing ""refined"" about this beer. Alcohol is far more pronounced than 5.3% ABV would suggest. Definitely neither smooth nor crisp, but certainly dry.  Not sure if this is the best representative of Oktoberfest style. Some pleasant effervescence and sweet notes are offset by excessive booziness and bitterness that is more closely associated with cheap AALs. Bitterness can be offset a bit by drinking the beer cold, but some of the bock nuances are then lost. Freshness is not an issue as this was in the first week of the very first can release, so something else is going on that makes this beer somewhat unbalanced. My initial reaction was negative, but this beer somewhat grows on you. Not sure if I would consider this for further bulk purchase (bought a 12-pack this time). I would prefer more hops bitterness in this than the burnt wood taste that I got, but it maybe characteristic of the style they are trying to follow. Distinctly tastes and looks like autumn, so the brewer certainly succeeded on that account. Probably best left to seasonal mixed pack--no need to get a mono 12  NB EDIT: Following some experimentation, found that this tastes best from a tall glass (and straight from the can!), not from more traditional beerware. The ""burnt wood"" taste is gone and sweet maltiness came to the forefront instead. Just to be sure, tried it in some other glassware combinations and confirmed the acrid burnt wood flavor in all but tall ice tea glass and can. Not something I would have expected. Tall glass also brings back the bock character that I initially expected and reduces the booziness. Upgraded the scores accordingly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,dpodratsky3,3.59,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  A: Dark amber with nice clarity, thin off white head, no real lacing.  S: Mostly sweet malts, but a good mix of different malty aromas, very light bread but clean overall  T: Rich malts come through from the first sip, sweetness. Some balance with the hops that make it through, but I didn't really pick up an major Noble hop flavors.  M: Decent carb, but not too crisp, lighter body, works well with the flavor and keeps it light feeling but not quite what i'm looking for.  O: Good drinkability. The crispness enhances it and the flavors are all what I would expect them to be. I have used this for a session beer before but as a true Oktoberfest there are better options.  Notes: Used to be one of my favorite beers. It's amazing how your tastes can change over the course of a year of BAing. Still a great beer and it will always be one of my favorite fall beers, but not quite as dark and complex as I remember.  Update: Re-reviewed again, and its still not nearly as good as when I first tried it, but my tastes haven't changed much in the last year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Jakey2005,3.63,"I generally enjoy Sam's version of an Oktoberfest. Nice copper color, malty and slightly roasty taste. I find it interesting the number of commentators on here that find it necessary to dislike this beer because it is produced by Sam. I brew my own Oktoberfest, lived in Germany, been to the real Oktoberfest in Munich, and still enjoy this offering from Sam. Not my hands down favorite. I reserve that for Ayinger.

Almost always a six-pack in my fridge in the fall and winter months. Most places around here (IA) have it on tap too, so it's a good one to get used to. May be a little too early for it's tastes (late-August) but couldn't resist once I saw it in the liquor store. One of my all-time favorites.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,DeFaz,3.62,"Sam Adams sets the bar high, and maybe my expectations are just a bit too high for this brew. It has plenty of malt flavor, and the malt provides sweetness that is only half checked by the hop bitterness that comes in later. Typical autumn flavors of caramel, toffee, and maybe pumpkin as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some astringency biting the tongue. Overall, I like the fact that it is easily available, but with Great Lakes Oktoberfest hitting the shelves this week, I'm going to have to go with that one instead this season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Hesperus,3.95,"Appearance: A clear, dark copper body with one finger of somewhat lasting head that dissipated into a thin layer of foam. Decent lacing.  Smell: Sweet malt, caramel, roasty.  Taste: Follows nose very closely, roasty, malty, caramel. Next to no hops present, but far from being overly sweet.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy, yet very drinkable. This beer has moderate carbonation and no alcohol detectable on the palate.  Overall: There's nothing that I can say bad about this beer, yet not a whole lot that I am overwhelmed by. This is a highly drinkable, enjoyable beer that warrants multiples at a party or other get together. There is some amount of excitement surrounding this beer's release every year that can only be justified by it being the most readily available yet tasty example of this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,StoneTSR,4.01,"APPEARANCE: Rubier red than expected with a full finger of eggshell colored head that fades very slowly. Thousands of tiny bubbles run up the side.  SMELL: That Munich malt comes through very strong with a sweet, but slightly woody smell. Not much else going on here.  TASTE: Wow. What a well balanced beer! The malt is certainly driving this beer, but there is enough hop bitterness to make this one extremely drinkable. A slight grassiness comes in after the first wave of sweet malt hits the palate. The aftertaste is clean, but leave the palate wanting.  MOUTHFEEL: Pretty much spot on. Medium-bodied, supremely drinkable.  OVERALL: I never expect much from Sam Adams, but once in a while they knock one out of the park and this is a perfect example of that. This is what a Marzen in the American market should taste like. Well done Sam.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CaptainHate,3.84,"Last year at a get together with some friends at which we listen to music and drink beer, we sampled three Marzen/Oktoberfests: Sam Adams, Shiner and Great Lakes. At the time, Sam Adams came off as the least interesting of them; it wasn't bad per se, just not as interesting as the others.  Tonight I was out and requested it when I found out it was available on tap. It was served in a Sam Adams glass with a rich copper color and an adequate head. The smell was as expected but the taste made it seem like there was a bit more going on than I had remembered from the earlier bottles. Also it complemented the chicken and shrimp dinner very well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: Malty, bready, slight hint of caramel.  T: Sweet, very bready and biscuity, caramel, hardly any hop flavor or bitterness.  MF: Smooth, creamy, no alcohol taste, and no bitterness.  O: This is a great Oktoberfest beer and I thought the strong malty flavor was great for this style of beer. I've had other beers of this style but this Sam Adams version has more robust flavor in my opinion. A good beer to have with lightly seasoned meats and poultry.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Predominant flavor of caramels with notes of roasted malts, pumpkin, herbal hops and some pine. Hints of peppery yeast and citrus. Lighter body than expected with good carbonation. I wasn't really thrilled by this beer. Too much caramel, with a sweetness that is not really counter-balanced by other variables. Not bad though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The scent is sweet, with sour grains, caramel malts, bran and pecan.  The taste is nicely sweet, not sugary, with a toasty grain and pecan flavor. There is a roasted or kilned taste with malts and toast. The feel is airy and refreshing with a light carbonated ease.  I've had this on draft and in bottle, this review is based on a bottle, and prefer the draft but find this to be a satisfying example of an Oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,gr0g,4.09,"Deep copper in color. Pretty good head retention. Sparse lacing. Malt, fruit, and hop notes in the aroma. Floral hop contribution. Toffee and some dried, ripened fruit.  Loads of caramel-ish malt with just the right amount of bitterness to balance things out. Picks up some breadiness/graininess on the back end. Maybe I never noticed or paid attention to such things before, but more recent vintages have picked up some nice fruity, estery notes not unlike a strong English bitter. This and the skillful hopping separate this from the pack of bland, one-dimensional examples of the style. Carbonation is nice, not at all harsh. Very pleasant to drink.  Marzen is a style I cut my craft beer teeth on, and Sam's is still among my favorite domestic 'fests. Like Boston Lager, this is a very underappreciated yet excellent and widely available brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

OK carbonation coming up, but looks almost flat.  S - Sweet malts, a little bit of spice in there, a nuttiness is hidden in there. Bready malts play around as well.  T - Pretty disappointed really, has a bit of an non description to it for being a marzen. I honestly feel like this may be a spoiled batch, I remember it so much more fondly last year (maybe my palate has evolved). What I do get out of this is largely malts, sweet malt with a small bitter bite at the end. A slight caramel hint as well.  M - Medium bodied, decent drinkability, but honestly the ""flatness"" is previously described makes me not want multiples. Good carbonation level.  O - Disappointing really. Was looking forward to this, but honestly, its Sam Adams, they aren't known for being the highest of quality. Don't get me wrong, Sam puts out some decent stuff, but with such a high volume being put out, its inevitable that the quality will lack some.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Thin, half-finger layer of head that left a good, persistent lacing down the side of the mug. Moderately carbonated.  Smell: There are some sweet, bready malt aromas. Subtle notes of caramel and spiciness. From what is there, it smells pleasant, but there really isn't much of an aroma to it. Light and lacking substance.  Taste: Very malty upfront, sweet maltiness mixes with caramel/toffee notes, backed by a slight toasty quality. Finishes with a bitterness, complemented with a savory, earthy spice flavor on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Medium body to this one, noticeably thicker than from the bottle. Carbonation takes charge at about the middle of the tongue, giving it a creamy feel as it coats the tongue. Very easy to drink.  Overall: This is a solid beer. There are better Oktoberfests available, but you really can't go wrong with this one. Readily available while in season and affordable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Mouthfeel is light, very easy to drink, fall session beer for sure.  When I was younger this was my first foray into Sam Adams beers, he'll this could have been my first craft beer. I recall it being better, but I think that's just my ever changing palate. Still, this is a great Oktoberfest, better on tap than in bottle. If I drink this again, it will be out of a liter stein.

A: Crystal clear reddish orange with an off white head the turns to a film quickly. The film sticks around, no lacing.  S: Hmm, not really much of a scent at all. A little bit of bready/caramel malts come through.  T: Smooth, caramely, bisquity maltiness. Very little bitterness, lots of sweetness but stops short of being too sweet. A very crisp finish but no discernible hop character.  M: Very creamy smooth, while keeping a fairly medium body. It's literally impossible to only drink one of these. Perfect crisp carbonation keeps it interesting, though not enough to bother the throat after taking huge gulps. Mmmm.  O: This is just a really good, affordable beer.

There is a decent amount of nuttiness as well. It was kind of mellow with as many different smells there.  The flavor is a good example for the style in a very non-challenging way. It is perfect for the audience. This combination makes this beer an easy drinker.  Overall, this is a decent example of an Oktoberfest type beer.

35,102,VoodooBear,3.23,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with ""best by"" month notched on the label. Served in a steidel.  Appearance: Deep, rich, amber color. Develops 2 fingers of tan foam that fizzle out very quickly into a thin ring.  Smell: Not very aromatic. Smells mostly of malt, slight hints of allspice, pumpkin pie in there.  Taste: Malt dominates the palate, there's a bit of hoppy bitterness at the end. It's a slightly sweet-tasting beer.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation. Light and easy to drink with a smooth finish.  Overall: This is a tasty and uncomplicated beer that doesn't really stand out anywhere in particular but will keep you more interested in it that any run of the mill lager.

Nothing impressive, but would drink again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MaximalC,2.06,"Pours transparent copper in color with a modest off-white head. Aroma smells of grassy, slightly skunky hops and some caramel. Tastes much like it smells, but worse. A funky hop stank presents up front, asserting itself through excessive carbonation. The malt aspect tastes less like caramel and more like raw sugar--quite offputting. The finish is a heavy does of wheat must. The sensation is kind of like what I would expect if I buried my head in a box of cheerios and inhaled deeply--less than appetizing. Finally the wheaty vapors subside and the process repeats itself with the next sip (sip being the operative word here).  I'm not confident I would have picked this out as an oktoberfest in a blind tasting, but then again I'm not a big fan of oktoberfests, so maybe I might have. Suffice it to say this brew has next to nothing going for it, coming off more like a beefed up light macrobrew than an homage to German brewing tradition.

A good product from Samuel Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,WastingFreetime,3.13,"Reviewed from notes.  Pours out a coppery amber, with another fizzling head that leaves behind no lacing as it falls apart in about half a minute. Medium body and carbonation levels.  Smells faintly of caramel and nuts. But only just. The flavor is much more notable: I get nutmeg-laced bready and toasted malts with a striking absence of earthiness and plenty of extra caramel. In other words, this beer is somewhat sweeter than the usual Marzen on the market. But some folks like that sort of thing. It gets a cinnamon dusting sort of flavor garnish as the glass warms up towards room temperature.

Head is somewhat weak and recedes quickly to nothing. Unfortunately, this beer looks like most bar-grade pints. Put this next to a Yuengling amber lager, and I don't think I could tell the difference.  Smell: Somewhat malty, but overall unimpressive. The aroma is very faint.  Taste: Slightly sweet cinnamon malt flavor. The taste is unoffensive and makes for an easy drinking beer. Decent, but not outstanding.  Mouthfeel: Actually a decently thick mouthfeel. Surprising for the way it looks and tastes. Probably the standout characteristic for this beer.  Overall: It comes off just too weak and watery for me.

M - Well carbonation with a nice medium body. Best part of the beer.  O - It is far from awful, yet there are just too many Marzen's that are way better.

T : Malt with nutty tones and a sweet aftertaste of Caramel.  M: Medium bodied with a slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel was a little too watery for my taste.

How many times have you gone to your local bottle shop, found a beer on the shelf that's a style you like, from a brewer you like, only to be disappointed?

Disclaimer, I never buy Sam Adams, been drinking beer for about 6 years I've had and enjoy pretty much everything. The reason is simple. I like to buy local and living in Pac NW, this might as well just be puddle water.  S: Bottled, pour into a glass, no head A: Beautiful copper tone S: None, maybe I'm plugged up Taste: Now here is where I have issue, there is none, a mild malt flavor and where are the spices as advertised? M: Not creamy, not dry, not anything unfortunately, slightly sweet  Overall: The reason I haven't bought Sam Adams in all my beer drinking years is mostly pride. I think they are trying to mass market a craft product, because you know, all beer makers have a beard and love their job enthusiastically. Let this be another great East coast example of commercialization. I'm sure all you Chowd's over there love drinking this stuff... during the humid summer's maybe. Come on over to Portland and you will learn what craft beer is all about because this is a complete farce.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Kooz,4.08,"Orange with a light tan head in a Sam Adams super-special glass. It is a pretty beer. I especially like how tightly packed the head is.  Smells faintly of hops and of malt. It's all faint, but nice. It smells like it will be smooth.  And boom goes the dynamite. This is a really smooth and mellow beer. Its slightly bitter from the first, but it mellows out as it coats the mouth.  Mouthfeel, as usual for Sam, is excellent. It's creamy and full-bodied with a pleasant aftertaste and nothing harsh. The carbonation is so perfect, it almost feels like a nitro draft.  I'm very happy with this. It may be passe at this point to sing the praises of the Boston Brewing Company, but I'm going to do it anyway: this is one of the beat Oktoberfests I've ever had.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Decent carbonation.  Smell: Not much smell. Nutty perhaps.  Taste: Not real strong but several flavors hard to describe. Raisins and nuts. Bready maybe. Enough hops to balance the sweetness but not noticeable in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Watery, lack of carbonation.  Overall: Easy to drink, good thirst quencher with a decent flavor. It's a quality beer that doesn't do much for me. I wish it was more flavorful. It's definately better than average though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,psuKinger,3.55,"12 ounce bottle acquired via the Fall Harvest Variety Pack, poured into a standard nonic.  A: Surprisingly dark orange/amber hue for a lager. Very translucent. A moderate white head on top that dissipated quickly. Carbonation readily visible.  S: Caramel malt. Toffee and bready notes, with a touch of barley sweetness. All at a moderate level.  T: Taste follows the nose. Caramel malt is outspoken here. A breadiness and lingering sweetness arrive somewhere near the midpoint and last to the finish.  M: Relatively light, but with considerably more heft than most others I've had within this style. Carbonation is exceptional.  D/O: The caramel malt really does it for me here. Perhaps my favorite example of a style that, by-and-large, I find to run too-thin-and-overly-sweet. The caramel/amber malt gives it some heft, and there may even be a touch of hops on the back end, even if it's just slightly.

35,102,BuckeyeSlim,3.35,"12 oz. bottle poured into an English pint glass.  A - Pours light golden yellow into the glass. One-finger head of eggshell-white foam dissipates quickly, leaving a bit of lace and some larger bubbles on the surface. Beer is an explosive amber orange and clear when held to a full-spectrum light.  S - Straight-ahead toasted malts and simple caramels. Some breadiness as it warms up. Nose is soft, but easily identified.  T - Nicely toasted malts with caramels and a bit of butterscotch/toffee. Nothing complex, but quite tasty. Just enough bittering hops in the background to balance the sugars. Maybe just a drop of dried apricot mixed in. I'd like the flavors each to be richer, but as they are, they're fine.  M - Rather fizzy and mouth-filling carbonation. Structure is a bit on the lighter side, but not thin. Smooth and drinkable. A touch of sugar in the finish lingers a bit, but in the background, and not at all cloying. Pretty clean.  O - All too often, most taps at a tavern are still dominated by the big boys. Fortunately, it's becoming pretty common to find one reserved for the Sam Adams Seasonal. When fall rolls around, and it's the Octoberfest, I'm thankful there's been at least this much breakthrough. It's reliable. It's tasty and refreshing for what it is. Many have done worse, and most of the taps around it prove it. Yes, it's pretty simple and two-dimensional, but it's consistently well-executed, and it's a relief to find available so I don't have to settle for Yuengling or that green bottle. Would be great to take to a party of BMC drinkers for a Saturday afternoon of football watching and grilled brats and turn them on to something they can actually taste. In a good bottle shop, it's not even a consideration.

Copper colored body with a small head that stuck around for a minute before fizzling away. Biscuit tones, caramel, roasted pecans, cinnamon and spices all off a nice smell. Taste follows closely behind with the caramel really coming out on top. Goes down fairly smooth considering it is not a thick bodied beer.  Octoberfest really does scream Fall when you sip on it.

The abv content is just right - and in this case, as close to perfection as one would desire. This is definitely a session beer, however, I suspect that you may not repeat the session as once would suffice. Octoberfest beers bring out the best in production, and this one is nothing short of spectacular.

It's biscuity, got some sweet booziness to it, and plenty of malty goodness, but it's as easy to chug down all night as it is to sip slowly. It's also got barely enough hops to balance out the flavour, which I think is great for the style. It's only problems is that maybe it's a little too sweet and sticky and got a little bit of a weird aftertaste. But everything else about it is really great for the price.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Jsteez,3.07,"This was poured into a dimpled beer mug.  A-deep reddish, medium amber brew with a thin tan head that left minimal lacing on the glass. I was surprised to see there was not much to the appearance here.  S-Faint smell of caramel, toasy malt, and some spice. There was also a nice smell of cherry, too. It smelled quite refreshing and I was looking forward to my first sip. But the taste didn't meet my expectations.  T-Toasty malt, caramel malt, some autumn-esque spice, carmelized nuts, baked nutty taste. The aftertaste was okay: buttered bread with some buttery, toasted nuts. A faint taste of pumpkin.  M-The mouthfeel was disappointing. I thought it was a little too wet for this style. It was too fizzy from the carbonation. At times I felt like I was drinking a fizzy soda water. A slight dry feel was present.  Overall-This is just an average beer, not bad, not great, just a beer to have during the crisp fall months. Note the word ""crisp"", a word that this beer lacks. I love having nice autumn beer that gives me a nostalgic feeling that reminds me of the smell of fire places and leaves changing colors. This beer did not present that feeling.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,thehyperduck,3.71,"355 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before July 2013. This isn't a style I've ever been a real big fan of, but to be fair, I can count the number of different marzens I've tried on one hand. Regardless, all of the Sam Adams brews I've had previously have been fairly solid, so I figured I'd give this one a whirl in the spirit of the season. Poured into a mug.  Pours a deep amber-orange hue, clear and effervescent, topped with one finger of dense, creamy white head. Retention is pretty good; it takes more than a few minutes for the foam to lose cohesion; in fact, a reduced layer of creamy foam remains to the final sip. The aroma is malty and sweet, with hints of caramel/brown sugar, toasted bread and biscuits forming the bulk of the bouquet, accented with just a wisp of lemony citrus and spice.  As with the aroma, roasted malts definitely dominate the flavour profile. Toasted, doughy bread, biscuits and some slight nuttiness are the most prominent facets, with the grassy, herbal hops coming forward nearer to the finish. Not especially dry, but not particularly sweet either; reasonably well-balanced. The aftertaste is a mix of roasted malts, herbal hops and faint citrus. Medium-bodied, with restrained carbonation and an exceptionally smooth, creamy mouthfeel that makes this stuff a real pleasure to drink.  Final Grade: 3.71, a respectable B grade. Of all the marzens I've tried (as limited a pool as that is), Sam Adams' Octoberfest is probably my favourite so far. Not outstanding, complex or especially memorable, but a solid brew in its own right - something that would go nicely with a hearty meal as well as on its own. In a pinch I'd probably just stick with their Boston Lager, but if I were in the mood for a heftier, slightly more warming lager for the fall months, I'd consider picking this one up again next year. Certainly worth a try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,LiquidAmber,3.82,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipated slowly to a film over the top and a ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet and bready malt with a hint of toasted malt and hops. Flavor is a pleasant lightly toasted, somewhat biscuity malt with slight light fruit and caramel. Solid biscuit malt finish with light hops. Medium bodied. A nice take on an Octoberfest, not complex, but with the expected solid malt body and finish.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Converge,3.63,"355ml bottle poured into a 16oz pint glass.  A - Pours a clean, rusty amber, with a moderate head of fizzy foam. The head settles to a thin skiff of suds, leaving minimal lacing behind.  S - Lots of toasty, sweet malt, with some nutty and mildly spicy qualities coming through. A good balance of caramel malt and mild earthy hops.  T - Comes across the palate very malty, with the hops adding a mild herbal earthiness at the end. Sweet, toasty grains, crystal malt, spice, and light nutty notes. Some off notes here and there, but overall a drinkable, malty brew.  M - Medium bodied, with a nice, assertive carbonation. Finishes a bit dry, with a lingering hop presence, though subtle.  D - I'm certainly no expert on this particular style, but what better way to familiarize myself with it than reviewing the most popular Oktoberfest on the market.

S: Fruit juice, toasted grains, mild spiciness, and a hint of honey. Sweet, malty, fruity, and spicy. T: Malty, bready and spicy with notes of fruit juice, toasted grains, orange peel and mild hops. The finish is sweet and the aftertaste is nutty and malty. Hints of apple juice. M: Medium-full body, very slick and syrupy (but not cloying) mouthfeel, with low and smooth carbonation.

The aroma smells sweet and doughy, with a notes of citrus, spice and lightly buttered toast mixed in.  The taste has more of a push to it from that green leafy citrus character but the sweetness finishes this out with a mix of light toffee and toasted bread. Dry and bitter on the backend. The mouthfeel is medium bodied; with a smooth and creamy feel as this spreads out and some light crispness that prickles the tongue a bit. This flows pretty decently across the palate.  This was decent but nothing overly special, with profiles that leaned to the sweeter side but there was just enough crispness to keep this mostly accessible and drinkable feeling.

35,102,Darkmagus82,3.48,"Served on tap in a pint glass  Appearance – Served a copper-orange color with a brew with a thick two finger off white head. The head slowly over time to leave a very nice level of lacing.  Smell – The smell is heaviest of roasted malt with a good dose of caramel sweetness. Mixed with this is a light earthy and herbal aroma as well.  Taste – The flavor begins of a biscuit flavor with a good presence of a roasted malt. There is a lighter sweetness of caramel and some brown sugar up front. As the taste advances the sweetness fades and some flavors of a slightly bitter earthy flavor and some nice spicy flavors come to the tongue. Toward the end of the flavor, the roastiness intensifies and when mixed with the rest of the flavors, leaves a roasty and spiced flavor on the tongue.  Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower than average side. The thicker body was quite nice for the roasty and spicy flavors, although a little bit more carbonation would have made it a bit more refreshing.  Overall - Smooth with some nice roast and malt. While not the very the best Oktoberfest in my opinion, it is quite nice. A good go to for more session style drinking.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,BeerFMAndy,4.05,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 5.3% ABV, Enjoy before Feb notched on label.  A - Autumn in a glass, this clear lager shines with is a robust rusted amber color which is capped by an off-white head of tiny bubbles. Spotty lacing collects around the pint above the thin, left over skim.  S - Fall is captured upon first whiff. Light Vienna malts provide an excellent base of faint toast and biscuit notes while the Munich malts offer quite a bit of mild sweetness which swirls throughout. A touch of earthiness suggests some hops but they're generally absent. A touch of mineral harshness trails off but this beer is generally very clean.  T - Maltiness continues to develop with it's Vienna base, once again pushing toasted qualities along with an overall sense of breadiness. The Munich malt's sweetness drops back from what the aroma suggests for something a little easier drinking while the finish opens up to hops just a hair more. Herbal notes and grassy earthiness are timid to say the least, but offer balance. Again, the beer's light mineral harshness becomes just a bit intrusive.  M - Medium-bodied and smooth, Samuel Adams Octoberfest has a delightfully malty but refreshing feel that really works well as a sessionable oktoberfestbier. Just a little dry earthiness on the finish goes a long way to keep the beer balanced and inviting.  O - Embodying the essence of fall, the malty aroma encourages the mentality to shift from light, crisp beers to maltier lagers before turning to full, rich stouts and the like. If there wasn't the pesky mineral finish that's almost metallic at points, I'd really, really love this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good Oktoberfest; one I can drink quite a bit of in season, it's just held back from greatness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Not many individual flavors stand out. Taste is good and balanced. For 5.30% this seems stronger, 7 maybe, as the taste of alcohol shows up on the finish  M- Smooth, refreshing, malty medium bodied  O- A decent offering from Sam Adams and for the style. One of the only ""craft beers"" that my wife will drink. She actually looks forward to it coming out each year.

L – Deep amber color with a 1.5-finger cream-colored bubbly head that dissipates pretty rapidly into a slick of bubbles across the surface. No lacing. Clear with lots of bubbles.  S – Full of malt with grain, toasted bread, and caramel aromas. There are maybe some earthy, floral hop aromas as well.  T – Follows the nose and adds some. Sweet nearly all the way through with grainy, bready, nutty, and toasted malt flavors. There’s a subtle earthy and spicy hop bitterness that comes through at the finish.  F – Medium-bodied with good carbonation, a crisp but creamy mouthfeel, and a grainy and slightly bitter and spicy finish. Grainy sweet malt and spicy, earthy, bitter hop flavors linger for a little bit.  O – This is a pretty good Oktoberfest beer. It has all the hearty and tasty malts that are supposed to be there. The subtly bitter finish was a little different touch, which was nice. I wish the head characteristics were a little better.

Modestly sweet toffee aromas are complemented by subtle fruity, leafy and nutty notes. There's a tad more depth of flavor than the nose would suggest, although it's not as robust as I'd like. Lingering tangy toffee and mild sweetness are the closest things we have to lasting impressions here. Appropriately mild bitterness with modest leafy hop flavor and carbonation. Notions of bread crust with apple butter. A touch thickish on the palate.

Will be a definite buy every fall.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,magictacosinus,3.7,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. No freshness date, but clearly meant to consume by the day Oktoberfest in Germany ends!! Hooray for beer!  Initial pour is highly carbonated, with a generous head, amongst a brownish amber color. Head eventually recedes next to nothing, but carbonation ends up being plentiful. Pretty standard in color - although I could use with a much *nicer* head for a marzen - but overall well presented.  Strong malts make up the backbone of the aroma, but there's other notable flavors to speak of as well, among them biscuits, pumpkin spice, caramel, cinnamon, and brown, burnt sugar. With all those sugars and spices, it's clearly sweet towards the finish, and no alcohol presence is around to overpower those aromas. There's not as much hoppiness as I wished for, but it's still pretty close to how marzens are.  The flavor is exactly the same as the description for its aroma, with the notable exception that it's slightly smoky during the finish. There's a warming alcohol sensation at the back of the throat. Malts are very strong here, with hops playing a minor presence in the beer's main flavor. Did I mention biscuits?? This is very much like a basket of fresh biscuits, but it's definitely more enjoyable than other notable amber ales (such as Fat Tire) due to its nicely thick body, as well as generous carbonation that makes it a delightful drinking experience. I would suggest drinking this far colder under room temperature so the assault of malts don't arrive as quickly as they did for me.  All in all, a very balanced, easily drinkable tribute to marzens and Oktoberfest seasonal beers. While not my all-time favorite, it's still an undeniably well made offering from Samuel Adams. A crowd pleasure for sure, despite being too a little malty for me, personally. Recommended a try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,jak3676,3.38,"Sam Adams - Octoberfest  I'm assuming this one is bottled the same as all their others, in Boston, MA. This is probably the easiest to find Oktoberfestbier in the states. It's about as average as you can come, but that's not a bad thing. Some else was saying its a good way to introduce Americans to the style without being offensive. I'd agree with that - it's good, but not great.  Coming in at only 5.3% ABV this is definately on the light side for the style. Its perfectly clear, with a nice deep amber toward red color. I liked it, it just seemed to be lacking a bit of flavor, not so bad as to call it watered down, but definately missing something.  Only indication of bottling date is a notch out of FEB on the side of the bottle which matches the traditional style perfectly, but maybe that's a ""sell by"" date?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste: The malt really drives the flavor of this beer. Faint hints of toasted nuts (I do mean faint). Takes a slight turn towards the sweet side after it goes down the throat. Nothing overwhelming, pleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. They got the carbonation right on this one. Smooth, yet a bubbly texture is defined.  Overall: I am a huge fan of Marzen beers.

Malt and and a tinge of spice maybe, but it's hard to detect much from Octoberfest.  Taste/Feel: Heavy on the malt, and I love it. There's also the light spice that I get in the aroma, but it's really just a lot of malt. The carbonation is pretty low, but the feel is pretty good. A light/medium body and it makes this beer actually pretty refreshing.  Just the look of the bottle with the taste feels nostalgic to me, even though this is the very first time I've had Sam Adams Octoberfest. It just makes me feel good, for whatever reason. It's not the best beer in the world, but it's about what you'd expect from Sam Adams, maybe a little bit better.

It's like finding a super rare card in a back of baseball cards when I find my first SA Octoberfest.  That all being said, I am going to try, TRY to rate this objectively.  When poured it has an absolutely stunning deep orange/red color into the traditional Sam Adams glass. Decent head, even if it is gone too quickly and good lacing on the glass. The dry notes in the back are a perfect counter to the malt taste in the front and the spice in the middle. Aroma is mild but not to the point of non-existence, and the bouquet of fall season comes out the more the beer is sloshed around in the glass. A wonderful flowery note on the top of the aroma. The carbonation is high, but the beer is pretty full bodied so it doesn't make the beer too soda-y.

Kind of expecting more here.  Taste: Mildly bitter up front with a sweet, malty taste. Finishes bitter with toasted and sweet malts and nutty flavors. A bit cloying in sweetness at the end.  Mouthfeel: Well-carbonated with a medium body to it.  Overall: Definitely not the best O-fest out there and definitely not one of Sam Adams's standouts.

Taste: Light but very balanced. Bready and toasty up front. The middle has just a slight sweetness to it with some brown sugar and cinnamon toast with a hint of caramelized fruit on the side.

The same cherry that could be smelled, maybe even a little fallen leaves and smokiness, but the beer reminds the drinker of the fall season it's designed for. Malt-heavy in a good way, with a good balance of necessary hops, and the cherry isn't overpowering.  M - Rich and heavy, but not to the highest degree. Different flavors came out when it hits different parts of the tongue, and when held on the palate, forms into tiny bubbles that go down as smoothly as the liquid form.

35,102,JamesMN,3.23,Appearance: Pours a translucent dark orange/amber with a thin light tan head. Doesn't leave much for lacing but the head regenerates nicely.  Aroma: Grainy with a touch of caramel sweetness and a slight roasted quality. Not too much in the nose.  Taste: Grainy with a bit of burnt malt in the background. A tad watery but I expect this Octoberfest is actually closer in abv and consistency to the original version than most american breweries produce. It has a bit of malt complexity but an odd metallic aftertaste distracts me from delving further into the levels of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Good level of carbonation and above average drinkability. Somewhere between light and medium bodied.  Final Thoughts: Not one of Samuel Adams better beers but not bad. It's sort of in that grey area where I am indifferent to it. I could see a first time craft beer drinker really liking this one (once they get past how dark it is compared to their beloved macro-lager). Wouldn't seek it out but not out of place in the autumn sampler pack.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,StonedTrippin,3.85,"this is a great octoberfest. looks pretty standard, autumn orange color with a lacey off white head that lasts awhile. smells like big german caramel malts and bready yeast. flavor is complex and not nearly as sweet as so many octoberfests are. i pick up so many fall flavors in this, like pumpkins, squash, and brown sugar, but that may just be a product of the season. mouthfeel is right on for the style, its lighter in body but not thin, just really drinkable. carbonation is pretty relaxed in this. its one of those beers that demands a huge glass. letting a one liter draft get a little warm as it drinks is how i always wish i was having it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,davecavemaster,3.88,"The beer pours with a bubbly, beige head that disappears rather quickly. The head leaves some slight lacing around the glass, but not much, and it doesn't stick around either.  The color of this fall brew is a rich copper.  For a nose, there is a deep smell of the roasted malts. I also get a hint of caramel.  Taste echoes the nose. This beer is very heavy on the malt flavors, but there is also decent balance of hoppy bitterness at the end of the taste.  This is a very smooth beer. Octoberfest has a light carbonation, and goes down easy. This is one seasonal that you can drink multiple pints and not get sick of it, or be overpowered by gimmicky seasonal flavoring.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Appearance: Pours a clear brown/amber color, with a light tan two-finger head that disappears rather quickly, leaving trace amounts of spotting.  Smell: Smells like pumpkins/pumpkin spice, yeasty, and very malty.  Taste: A definitely high amount of malts hits, with a backbone of pumpkin-like flavor. This is quite a malty brew, and quite delicious.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation and body, I can drink a bunch of these in one sitting no problem.

35,102,pixieskid,3.55,"Not the biggest fan of Marzen/Octoberfest beers, this one came in the fall 12 pack. While it's one of my least favorite German styles, I know it well because a couple years back Trader Joes had mini-kegs of Paulaner Octoberfest on sale for 10 bucks and I couldn't pass up that opportunity.  Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a thin white head, dimishes quickly but has a bit of staying power with the somewhat rabid carbonation.  Nose; lightly fruity, soft caramel, touch of grains.  Taste; herbal hop presence, some grains, toastiness, caramel, light fruits...apples. In the finish a touch of alcohol comes through, it's pleasantly warming, but that really shouldn't be there at the mid level abv.  Mouthfeel; crisp and slightly slick.  Overall; not half bad, one of the better beers so far in the pack, much better than the dunkelweizen for sure. Style wise, still not much of a fan. Maybe if I were at Octoberfest and had a big old mug of it and a brat I'd think differently...I'm sure I'll make it over there one of these years.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The beer smells slightly metallic, and faintly sweet of malts. Some toasted grains on the back end.  Taste is very metallic. The toasty, bready, malty caramel is not as present as much as I would expect. The toasty grain element in the finish at least forgives the metallic-tasting beginning.  Mouthfeel is carbonated, somewhat light bodied.  Overall, a good beer to buy in 12 pack cans for the price. Probably what I call your ""average"" marzen.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There's a strong roasted barley malt aroma in the nose. I also detect some mild sweetness and grassy hops. The beer is very bready up front. There is some mild sweetness and the hops bring some balance on the back end. The aftertaste is also pretty malty. The body is medium with moderate carbonation.

The back end gives off a yeast or bread type flavor with a little bit of dryness on the aftertaste.  M: light carbonation, medium body and lots of simple flavor that makes this beer very drinkable.

35,102,TheCondor,3.8,"This beer was obtained in a seasonal twelve pack from Samuel Adams. While I may not agree with releasing the fall seasonals in early August, it's not my choice to make. That being said, I generally appreciate the Sam Adams seasonal packs, as they come with a good variety of brews and you get two, so you don't have to be a loser drinking alone. Side poured from the bottle into a pint glass with standard vigor.  Appearance - Pours a copper, almost rust color with a small one finger head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves little lacing. Love the packaging, as I do most SA products, but that isn't a scoreable criteria (unfortunately). Carbonation action can be seen inside the brew.  Smell - Big, rich roasted malts, breads, and toast. Plenty of sweetness to go around as well in those malts, almost a syrup or vanilla smell.  Taste - Much like the nose. The malts hit you up front, followed by the hints of sweetness and more malts. Finally there is a definite toast essence as well, which is very refreshing and tasty.  Mouthfeel - Finishes fairly clean, leaves an uber-malty aftertaste, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Easy to drink.  Overall - I like this beer! I have always enjoyed the marzen/oktoberfest styles, and the Sam Adams product I think is a quality product. Not a world-beater, but certainly worth a drink or twelve. Definitely a fun beer to buy a bunch of, sit around an outdoor fire on a brisk night, and hang out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

T/M:  Taste follows the nose with rich and full flavor roasted malts. Sweet but mellow and earthy with almost pumpkin pie spices. Full bodied and sticky to the mouth with a good sting of carbonation and a semi dry whisper of herbal hops at the end.   O:  This was one of my first beers from the Boston Beer Company that I tried and loved. I look forward to this every year. Its a mellow but rich beer that packs loads of complex flavors that are well mingled together and very refined. I have yet to try many oktoberfest/Marzen but I look forward to expanding my horizon.

35,102,DocJitsu,3.85,"2011--Pours a copper amber with a quickly dissipating tan head. Classic Märzen aromas. Toffee and ripe fruit. Mouthfeel is magnificent for the style. Two years ago, Boston Brewing messed with the recipe causing the mouthfeel to to be too scrubbing and biting. Now just the right amount of creamy, which is enhanced by the toffee flavor, yielding to a mild scrubbing. I love how this is a beer to experience rather than just drink or swill. The appearance, aroma, mouthfeel and flavor are all complimentary, creating an inclusive sensory experience and a beer with excellent drinkability. Outside of Spaten, this is the best Oktoberfest I've had.  2012--Pours a clear golden copper with a 1/4"", quickly dissipating, caramel-colored head. The nose is characterized by brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, and banana. The mouthfeel is so soft, thick, and wet, with just a hint of carbonation on the back of the tongue. Very, very pleasant. A nearly perfect balance of brown sugar, ripe date, and cinnamon comprise the flavor. There's no overdone, gimmicky pumpkin or cinnamon. It's a very classy Oktoberfest. And, thank God, there is not that usual, off-putting hop presence that is so often prominent in Sam Adams beers. This year is a huge improvement over last year. Thank you Boston Beer Co!

Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Cigar City pint glass.  A: Pours a crystal clear deep copper. Forms a one-finger off-white head with very good retention, and quite a bit of fine bubbles of carbonation. This is awfully pretty.  S: Toasted, rich biscuity malts, a touch of grassy hops, Not a huge nose overall. There's a touch of a metallic aroma here as well.  T: Crisp cracker and biscuit malts primarily, with some herbal and resin hop bitterness behind. A bit of the hop bitterness lingers around after the swallow as the clean lager finish disappears. This is still an enjoyable drink.  M: Medium body...maybe a touch lighter than you might expect. Low alcohol presence and a good amount of carbonation sensation.  O: Is it an old standby? A classic American take on a more classic style? An introduction to craft beer for many? I'm not sure where to put this. Perhaps next to Anchor Bock in an historical sense. It doesn't keep up with the flashy beers around, or the new beers on the block, or even some of the other Octoberfest beers available. But it's solid and drinkable.

O - Despite having an Octoberfest in February, I can safely say that Im enjoying it. A cold night beer. I was expecting a heavier taste and mouthfeel but it has a nice balance of both to make it enjoyable. The foamy head was kinda dissapointing but the flavor really makes up for it and Im relieved when I get closer to the bottom of the glass...It could be old to which that might be why the head looses its body early but that really doesnt matter at this point.

Hops are pretty big for the style and provide an assertive spiciness.  D: Quaffable and thirst-quenching stuff. This is how a Märzen should be - if you can't drink the whole stein...its unbalanced.

After drinking several, I admit that most didn't sit well with me, however this one did. I kind of like it.  Appearance ~ I drank it out of a bottle, so I really have no clue. Holding it up to a window, it looks dark, but I can see through it. I'm going to give it a three because I'm too lazy to get up and pour it into a glass.  Smell ~ Hmmmm... come to think of it, this probably isn't a fair review for me either as I have a bit of congestion... It smells sweet, I think of cherries when I sniff.  Taste ~ This is where the OctoberFest excels when compared to the other beers in the variety pack. (note - I said when compared to other beers in the variety pack). The word of caution is because I can't quite decide if I think the taste is above average. I think I sometimes confuse ""taste"" with ""mouthfeel"". I'm going to give it a 3.5.  Mouthfeel ~ this I like,it's crisp, but not too crisp, giving it a slight silky smoothness that coats your mouth but rinses out quickly.

Aroma had me thinking more ale than lager.  T- Very much lager in the taste, which never compares to ale, in my opinion, but the flavor was good, and much more developed than the all too popular, according to the commercials, adjunct lager style.

Mild fruity hops kick in about halfway through adding a bit balance, but they fade out quickly. Mostly dry finish with the sweet malts lingering a bit longer than anything else.  M - Lively carbonation gives good drink-ability, but I found it a bit much for the style.  O - A fairly solid offering, just not very complex.

It is Beer O'Clock on Friday and my draft Octoberfest's appearance is deep and rich in its plain 20oz glass. It has a subdued head, as the draft seems well chilled. It has a smooth and pleasant caramel sweetness that turns slightly tannic bitter in the finish that does not linger. It is not dry.

The beer was good overall, but did not have anything that hit me hard. To me, it didn't have any charateristics that were different from the norm. I probibly had too high of expectations. It had some of the basic octoberfest characteristics, basically tasting like an average medium lager. I had a high quality of ingredient traits, but it just didn't seem like the ingredient portfolio was very diverse. Just kind of small for a craft ocotberfest in my opinion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Jadjunk,3.43,"#132. One of the most highly anticipated Samuel Adams selections, I have been preparing to consume this beer for a very long time now. I've been looking far and wide for an Oktoberfest that satisfies my palate, and have as of yet been largely unsuccessful. I got mine as a part of the Autumn Harvest Variety Pack for a meager $13.99. This is my first selection (of 4) from that pack (Not including previously-reviewed Boston Lager and Irish Red).  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass at room temperature. Served at 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Rigorous pour yields a frothy 1.5 finger off-white mild cream tone depth head of a light consistency. Retention is average, casually declining as it condenses, until it recedes to a thin surface cover in a few minutes. Minor speckled lacing is left behind on head level. The color is a deep gold-orange with some peach champagne tones. Clarity is crystal clear with medium carbonation and no impurities to the naked eye. The head quality could improve, but otherwise this looks appropriate for an Oktoberfest. 3.5  (Smell) Aroma consists mainly of clean grains, mostly amber, medium crystal and some pale malts and reminiscent of that characteristic caramel tone that most Samuel Adams lagers have. Warming also reveals some mild toffee and roasted nut tones, mild but certainly present. Aside from the sweet toffee, potency is mild, and should tone up significantly to improve this score. Smells slightly more full bodied than the average lager, but then again, that's essential to what makes Oktoberfests so distinctive. In that respect, it meets. 3  (Taste) Taste consists of a mildly roasted sweet amber malt and toasted nut introduction followed through with a lingering caramel finish with an earthy hop twang. The flavors are very mild but balanced enough to avoid tasting ""watered down"". Not surprisingly, this beer swings to the sweet end of the spectrum in terms of taste. Therefore, while the taste lies on the more passive end of Oktoberfests in terms of body, it does so with an interest of accessibility to most casual beer drinkers while also maintaining an interest in decent quality for the more stringent of folks, as with me. I'm not very impressed, but its a decent session beer in the end. 3.5  (Mouthfeel) A medium crispness in the beginning, calming down to a laid back mild carbonation in the finish. Finish also has what I'd consider a ""dry nutty"" tone to it that, of course leaves the finish dry. It's not what I'd call ""smooth"", but rather of a mildly watery consistency, a very lager-like clean feeling, as lagers are largely expected to be. Body is medium, on par with comparing Oktoberfests as there's some substance to this one. Alcohol is well concealed save for a slight alcohol tingle on the tongue and in taste that comes by larger gulps. As before mentioned, it's a decent session take for an autumn beer assuming you enjoy the simplicity of Oktoberfests. I find the mouthfeel to pair well with the taste. 4  (Overall) Not an Oktoberfest to knock my socks off, but it's not lacking in content, just in distinction. If you're an Oktoberfest fan, I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy this but it sticks quite strictly to the seemingly tight-knit standards of Oktoberfests, making it just another beer in a large line-up of very similar takes on the not-so-diverse lager style. For less than $1.50 a bottle, it's a good session choice, but for a real autumn treat, something more adventurous should fit the season better. 3.5  Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Octoberfest B- (3.4)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

However, it really grew on me when I tried the style a couple more times. This particular one came from the Sam Adams Fall Seasonal 12-pack.  The beer pours a translucent amber color. It has a sort of buttery malt smell and flavor that is different than most other styles (recently I have had an Irish Red that is similar). This is probably why I did not originally like this style. But, once I was used to this flavor, I was sad to finish the ones I had.  I would highly recommend trying this beer (and others of the style), especially because they are only available during the Fall season.

T - Taste follows the look more than the smell - it's sweet, very malty, but also something of a maple sugar taste. Not cloying, but almost like the label says - ""what we want fall to taste like"".

35,102,PEIhop,3.38,"As far as appearance goes, Sam Adams Octoberfest definitely has traditional color tones for the style. The beer pours a deep-auburn that has a small, but very, bubbly head. The head doesn't stay for very long, quickly dissipating into a thin ring around the interior of the glass. The aroma from this pint is faint, but that which does escape, is full of malty notes. Caramel dominates the nose with a subtle background of toffee and breadiness. The taste parallels the aroma nicely. The first part of the taste was full of caramel and a bread-y character. The tastes finishes a little sweet, but not overpowering resulting in a clean, crisp take on a European staple. It had been sometime since the last time I poured myself an Octoberfest. I was pleasantly surprised with the fullness of its body, not chewy or aqueous, but medium-bodied with a nice level of carbonation. With an ABV (Alcohol by Volume) of 5.3%, Sam Adams Octoberfest is sessionable during those cool, refreshing fall evenings in New England. It is not the best American interpretation of this style, but is well-made brew that has the ability to open minds to craft beer as it did for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Hints of floral, grassy pine along with some pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg. Very faint malt sweetness even as it warms.  Fuller bodied and more complex than I expected. The hop presence from the aroma is present up front providing faint dry bitterness which compliments the spice character.

Smells of sweet caramel and toasty malts, also get that crisp lager smell, I take a sip and get a medium bodied mouthfeel with sweet caramel and some slight malts, altho I can realy get a noble hop taste, maybe hallertau or tettnager hops, some noble variety, ends in a long lasting caramel taste which makes me want another drink. To be honest i think this beer needs more malty bready taste and less aroma addition hops.

35,102,BucannonXC5,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. Color was reddish caramel. Maybe a ½-inch of head that dissipated very quickly. Minimal lacing. Minimal film on the sides.  Smelled like an amber. Maybe some roasty caramel malts. Some toffee late, but a bit weak altogether.  Tasted similar to the nose. Roasty malts up front, reminded me of Gordon Biersch’s Marzen. Malt heavy.  Medium body. Thin texture. Soft carbonation. Fairly long finish.  About what I expected. Just so-so, but good for the fall/winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste follows nose: clean biscuity caramel malt balanced by bitter hops. Nice clean mouthfeel, very drinkable.  This is not a particularly complex or even interesting beer - but that's par for the style. A little hoppier than its German counterparts, which I like.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MeatHunter,4.33,"We are fortunate enough to have a fantastic liquor store with an awesome variety of craft beers. Over the years, I have tried many beers from Sam Adams and to me, they all had one familiar taste. HOPS. Don't get me wrong, I like hops, when it's applicable to the style, but it just seems like Sam Adams uses them liberally in most of their beers. The other day I decide to pick up a 6 pack of Octoberfest. Have wanted to try this for some time as Octoberfest/Marzen is one of my favorite if not THE favorite style of beer.  All I can say is WOW. Truly impressed. Now I may be a bit biased on my review being that this particular style sits well with me, but there was nothing out of place with it.  Color. A perfect clear Amber. Mouthfeel. Not malty, not watery. Taste. Sweet, but not. Biscuit flavor/smell initially. A subtle sweetness on the backside.  This is a beer, in my opinion, that should appeal to all palates. I WILL be stocking up on this one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S-Biscuits right off the bat, followed by fall oriented scents like nutmeg and pumpkin pie. After taking some really big whiffs I feel like I'm laying in a big pile of leaves!  T-Medium bodied with average carbonation. The classic Marzen spices hit you right off the bat, there's also a surprising salty taste. Finishing very clean with a tad bit of alchohol.  M-Nothing really special here, a bit of carbonation when it first hits the palate, but finishes very silky and clean!  O-Overall one of the best non imperial octoberfests' that I've had, blows Leinenkugel's and Harpoon's versions out of the water.

O- A good beer but not what I think a lot of people make it out to be before I ever had it. The appearance I think is the best part. The taste seems to be lacking for all its hype.

There is also a bit of an earthiness and a touch of a cherry sweetness. It ends with a malty slightly sweet aftertaste.

35,102,WhiteyHesa,3.91,"First beer review, so let's see what I can do.  Serving type was bottle poured into glass. Pours a picturesque amber with a two to three finger off-white, tan head, with plenty of carbonation. Head dissipates after about a minute.  The smell was a bit nutty, with very mild notes of some kind of spice or floral scent that I can't quite pin down.  The taste has a fairly prominent ""bready"" quality that finishes with a bit of hoppiness.  Mouthfeel is pleasant, starting off smooth with a bit of carbonation and ending with a satisfying crispness.  Overall, an enjoyable beer and worth a try, but not something that I'm going to flip my lid over. That said, if Boston Beer Company does anything right, it's definitely the appearance of their beers. They're always a pleasure on the eyes.  Cheers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mactrail,3.48,Clean and malty with a scratchy touch of hops. Nothing very interesting about it but it looks nice in the glass with a real orange color for the season. Malty with a roasted edge. Hops are the earthy sort. Slight bitterness around the edges. Touch of saltiness along with the sweet malt.  Yet another perfectly drinkable beer from Sam Adams. Well made and balanced. Down the hatch and on to something else.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,claspada,2.89,"Pours a nice caramel/amber color with adequate head and lacing.  Aromas are of some sweet bready malts but not much else. It's a pretty weak-smelling brew and left me wanting more. Maybe a faint hint of earthy hops but I could be making that up as well  The taste is about the same, some mild malt and a little undefined spicing, presumably from the yeast. It is a little sweet and bready in the front with a slighty hopped end  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. It drinks easily enough but the carbonation left me feeling more full than a beer with such little body and flavor warranted.  Overall I am not a big fan of this style but I find this beer to be pleasant enough to have one here an there. I will never purchase this beer but it was offered to me for free so I said why not. Plenty of better examples of the style but you can definitely do worse I suppose.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Some very mild, unidentifiable non-citrus fruit. maybe apricots or plumbs. mild spicing, fall spices. nutmeg? clove? reminds me of fresh biscuits! smell is a nice, sweet, very hoppy, inviting beer. leaves a slightly 'off' aftertaste, nothing bad or off-putting, but just.. musky? don't exactly know how to describe it. nothing down-turning though! in my opinion, best served very chilled.

Taste is similar to the smell, consists of roasted malt, caramel sweetness, bread and various spices. Taste overall is light and simple, but blends together well. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Aftertaste is a bitter and dry caramel taste.  This is a tasty and refreshing Oktoberfest, nothing to complicated but nothing offensive. Worth a try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Some beers are loathsome, wretched, abominations. Samuel Adams is good. Not great, but good. Now this particular brew, the Octoberfest, is a very lush amber colour with a decent head that disappears a bit quickly. carbonation is slight but that works with the flavour heavy style. Not all flavours being equal however this is no fantastic beer journey. It's fine. Not very hoppy, a bit spicy, but not much. Try it.

Taste - ...I usually liken these to a mix of red ale and pale ale...this one...this is more like a red ale and a brown ale to me. Less hoppy, more nutty, ontop a malty palate. Finishes fine enough I suppose, not much on bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Like before, leaves a finish of a malty/nuttiness/hoppiness that doesn't last very long.  Overall - This is a bit different of an Oktoberfest for me. I'd think it'd appeal more to people who like brown ales than red or pale ale drinkers. It doesn't hit the right notes for me.

Pours a very nice amber-ruby colour with a fairly large off-white head that burns off quickly without leaving much lace, but getting retained as a fairly thick collar.  Surprisingly hoppy aroma over a solid base of caramel malts. Some bread-like character and a hint of plum, but kind of muted over all.  Tastes primarily of toasted caramel malts. Nice balance between sweet and bitter with a brown bread quality. Slight lemon zest character comes through in the dry finish.  Fairly thin-bodied with a medium carbonation level. Dry and syrupy resin feeling on the tongue. Bitter aftertaste with a slight floral note.  Definitely not my favorite example of the style, I think it's too thin and doesn't have robust toasted/bread/fruit characteristics, but it's still an enjoyable, clean-tasting and highly drinkable effort.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste was fairly classic marzen, well malted a dash of lemon and just a bit sour around the edges for balance.  mouthfeel was crisp, nice, medium bodied, held together well.  Overall finishes fairly clean and is easy drinking.

Immediately after pouring the sides of the glass were covered with bubbles, and they continued to form at the bottom and make their way to the surface.  S: Malty, rich and sweet. Nothing more needs to be said.  T: The taste starts out really strong, bringing in the roasted malts and a good deal of sweetness. Unfortunately once the initial burst of flavor disappears the beer is left tasting like a typical adjunct lager.  M: Has some body, but not much carbonation.  O: A drinkable beer, but just OK.

Slight hop character is earthy and blends into the overall flavor without being distinctive.  The mouthfeel is wet and chewy. If you like malty beers this is a good one. Even for an octoberfest this is pretty malty.  This is basically just a malted up version of Sam Adams Boston Lager. It is a good Octoberfest that is readily available at this time of year.

This is quite probbl the best LOOKING Sam Adams beer; homey tinted orange color that glows and shines with a nice frothy 2 finger cap of tan bubbles. Good retenti, nice legs, but weak lacing.  Smells of caramel and Munich malts-- some good sweetness but also a toasty biscuit quality. The beer is a lot hoppier than I expected, with a nice spicy bitterness lingering on the finish.

Me broken nose can't detect anything. All apologies, lads.  T: Slight bittering hops, an overly commercialized barly/malt foundation, and no real substance. It's decent, but far from exemplary.

It's far from special but has some l imited spice. Built simply, but balanced.  Mf: Smooth and wet, but a touch thick. Rather generic.  Dr: Easy to drink, average ABV, and average quality.

Pours a two finger head of beige colour. Okay thickness and creaminess. No lacing as the head recedes. Retention is above average - 3 minutes.  Body colour is a somewhat dark amber-copper of average vibrance. No yeast particles are visible.  Standard fare for style.  Sm: Caramel, allspice, clove. Munich malts. Hints of pumpkin gourd. A touch of roast. Some grains. Generic floral hopping. On the sweeter end. Lightly bready. No yeast or alcohol is detectable. A pleasant aroma of above average to mild strength.  T: Nice spicing, with allspice, clove, and maybe nutmeg. Good caramalt build with some leavening munich malts in there as well. I pick up a buried hint of pumpkin and some traces of nuts and toffee. Fairly bready and grainy. Any hopping is minimal in strength/floral in character. A bit too sweet. Balance is decent for what it is. Unimpressed with the lack of complexity and subtlety, but hey, it's Sam Adams. Approachable and likable for what it is, but far from unique or special.  Average depth/duration/intensity of flavour. The sweetness isn't to style for a festbier.  Mf: Smooth and wet, with some unwelcome coarseness in the second act. A bit overcarbonated. Body is too full for the lack of diversity and depth of flavour. Subpar presence on the palate overall. It's pretty generic, and I guess it suits the flavour profile okay.  Dr: Downable but forgettable. A pretty average seasonal from Sam Adams. I won't look forward to this in future years, but it's tolerable inoffensive change from Boston Lager.

I could not detect any distinct smell and the taste was more malt that hops. The carbonation level was moderate (the special glass would have made more bubbles and perhaps more flavor). A good beer for intellectual wannabees to impress their friends, but not worthy of a true beer advocate.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,matjack85,3.47,"I got this 22oz brown bottle as a gift, so not sure of the price, but I have seen 6-packs in the store for $7.99, so it's not an expensive seasonal beer. A notch on the left side of the label will give you a best consumed by date. This bottle is notched for Jan. of 2012.  The beer pours a crystal clear red/amber color and produces a huge 4-finger light tan head, so be careful with the pour. Lacing is phenomenal.  Rather weak nose considering all the ingredients in here. Faint caramel and toffee is all I'm getting.  Brewed with 5 malts, it's not surprising that this beer is on the sweet side. Caramel and toffee are the dominant flavors. A slight roasted flavor is also present. With just 15 IBU's, there's not much hop presence.  Medium bodied with only moderate carbonation.  If you like your Oktoberfests sweet and malty, then you'll probably love this.

I realize a mug might not be the most conducive to aromas, but even so I'm really struggling to pick up much of anything.  T- Here the beer shines through- there's caramel, overripe cherry, sourdough bread. A good bit of malt flavors, and some bitter earthy hops to boot. Mostly the caramel is the strongest, but not in an overbearing way at all.  M- Fairly sweet and syruppy. I think I could live with that in a stronger beer/O-fest, but it doesn't quite fit this one.

35,102,Joel,2.91,"Strange taste, but drinkable.  I had this last night at a local reastaurant. It was not my first choice or second. My first choice was Mayflower IPA. My waitress regretted to inform us that they were all out of that. I ordered a Harpoon IPA and my wife ordered this on tap. She thought that there was something wrong with her beer, so I switched my superior dry, hoppy Harpoon with her Octoberfest. The Octoberfest did look better with a small head compared to none on the Harpoon and had a rich color.  I told my wife that there was a lightly burnt caramel taste. This kept the malt flavor from being sickly sweet. I also detected some added spices - a slight cinnamon taste mixed with some other spice. This taste reminded me of a winter style beer. However, after reading other reviews, I assume that flavor was from the hops - probably spicy tasting German or German style hops. I'm not a fan of Sam Adams in general or in sweet beers either. However, this beer was more drinkable than many Sam Adams beers which I have found to have a chemical taste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

There wasn't much of a head on this beer, but the clear copper/amber color makes it look hearty, yet light, as in a watery kind of light.  There's not much smell to this beer. You get a little bit of malt and carmel, and that's it. The taste, however, is significantly more malty with a slightly smaller amount of bitter. There's not much alcohol in the beer, but it doesn't do a good job of covering up what it does have.

S: Some buttery biscuit malt, some sweet fruit, some nuttiness, and a very typical dusty, earth, and slightly spicy Bavarian hop profile. There's even a bit of alcohol, which I don't mind at all. The defining characteristic here is the fruitiness.... drifting toward Nut Brown territory.  T: Up front you're greeted by a large, impressive malty body, but that quickly gives way to a sort of putrid and metallic/hollow fruitiness that I can't say I'm enjoying.

35,102,wrb357,3.75,"I remember having this beer many years ago and it sort of changed my outlook on German beers. Now, I know this is an American beer, but it's a German style, and now that I've developed more of a palate for beers of all types, coming back to it I find myself less mesmerized, but still enjoying the experience.  It looks good - nice amber hues. The head is pretty week, but it retains lacing. It looks like changing leaves of Fall.  Smells very spicy to the nose. One of the best qualities of the beer - instantly reminds you of pumpkins, nutmeg, the Fall air, etc.  The taste is less than I remember. Not less as in bland, more so it is less of an Oktoberfest taste (or Marzen taste) than I would like. It's very sweet - not sickly so, but less complex than say a Paulaner or a Spaten. Now, to be fair, Paulaner or Spaten may taste more watery - but that makes it easier to drink, in my opinion. Lots of spice notes to this one, some caramel - not bad at all, but maybe a bit too strong?  The taste carries over into the feel. It lingers on the tongue, but not in a completely satisfying way. I say this after having put back a few Paulaners (my favorite) so maybe my taste is a bit jaded. Will have to revisit this one tomorrow on a clear palate.  Overall, a good beer for the fall. Easily available gives it more points, and the fact that it's an American take on a German style that doesn't sacrifice any flavor gives it more points too.  I recommend trying it, especially for novices.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Body is a reddish amber color with orange highlights. Transparent with active carbonation.  Aroma is of very sweet maltiness and not much else.  Taste opens up with an aggressive amount of malt sweetness tempered with a background of herbal and semi-spicy hoppiness. Mid-taste of almost cloying sweetness with little hop presence. Aftertaste is of some breadiness. Would have liked something more than just sweetness and faint hops in the taste, like some more noticeable breadiness or biscuit character.  Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, this is quite pleasant on the palate. Finish is dry.  A fairly satisfying American Oktoberfest, good, but not great.

S: Lightly toasted malts, caramel, toffee and very bready notes make up the base of the aroma. Perhaps a hint of floral hops are towards the very back end for a split second but the rich, robust malt profile is the focus.  T: A touch of sweetness initially, but the malt profile comes in again midway through. It's more of the same, caramel, toasted malts, and bready/doughy flavors. There's a very clean quality about the taste that I attribute to not overloading this with an intense flavor. Nothing off or astringent in the finish, either.  M: Crisp, light and prickly on the palate. Again, it feels extremely clean coming and going without leaving anything behind to throw off the experience of the beer. To style, it's extremely good.  This is certainly one of the more easy drinking Oktoberfests on the market, and one that has proven to retain quality year after year while being made on a large scale.

Poured a fast-rising two finger head that thinned shortly to about 1/4th inch layer of foam. A thinner layer holds throughout. A few clumps of lace; not much.  The aroma is filled with toasted grains, bread, caramel and an earthy notion; all of which is pleasant. What isn't so pleasant is an aroma that I can only describe as half shaved metal and half hand lotion; yeah, I'm not at all digging that part. As it warms, suggestions of campfire emerge; I can live with that.  The taste is more enjoyable than the aroma. It started off with refined, earthy hop bent which is quickly enveloped in toasted grains left and right. Grains and bready flavors abound, causing the caramel suggested by the nose to be downplayed; fine with me. On the outskirts are the occasional wisps of mild fruit esters. This critter tastes really good and is well-integrated.  The toasted flavors when coupled with brisk yet restrained carbonation make for a reasonably crisp medium body. Some bready residuals linger, but the finish is quick and mostly clean. The feel is pretty much spot-on.  Overall, this is a decent one.

A: Clear, and dare I say/exaggerate it, pumpkin orange? Yes that's a bit of a stretch, its more of a copper/stained wood kind of color. Head  S: Aroma alludes to an incredible sweetness/richness that comes through but is lost every slightly in the taste department.

It just smells like a sweet, malty beer, it is an entirely unique aroma that only a beer can possess.  T/MF: Not quite why octoberfests get such a bad rap on this site.

It smells of crisp biscuity grain, bready caramel, a touch of aged lemon rind, and mild earthy, leafy hops. The taste is a bit of a let-down, the bready biscuit malt a fair bit less crisp that I was initially led to believe, with some duly fading lemon, a still heady caramel and fire-sale vanilla cookie sweetness, and weak weedy, earthy hops.  The carbonation is average, just plainly supportive in its fizzy endeavors, the body an adequate medium weight, and actually quite smooth, with a minor creaminess arising as things warm.

35,102,sweett3k,3.85,Sam Adams brew. Micro Macro ? I do not know. To me all Sams kind of have that same yeast note smell and flavor. A unique distinction for this beer. Looks like a red beer. Very light and crisp for an Octoberfest style beer. Pours a small head that disapates to hardly any lace. Notes of signature yeast and caramel. Taste like a darker Sam Adams Boston Lager. Kind of nutty. Easy to drink multiple of these. Decent .,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Appearance: Clear amber color with a thin off white head about a centimeter thick that fades into a thin lacing over the top of the beer and clings to the side of the glass.  Aroma: Toffee, caramel, and bready, typical oktoberfest aroma.  Taste: Basically the same as the aroma but with subtle roasted notes.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium carbonation and a sweet finish.  Overall: Decent representation of an oktoberfest/ marzen style. Not my favorite style but still good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smells of doughy malt and Milk Duds are backed by a smell of fruit cup an a hint of citrus zest. The sweet and full malt body borders on a syrupy consistancy. Tastes of mixed fruit, sweet malt and mild limes are all very in balance. It's a nice O-Fest, yet a bit heavier than their German counterparts.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I’ve seen so much raving (and ranting, to be fair) on the boards about the SA Oktoberfest that I just had to find out for myself what all the hype is about.  Poured from a bottle into the SA pint glass. I’m getting a lot of mileage out of this!  Caramel-amber color, not a lot on the nose. But a big malty flavor on the palate. It’s big and sweet, with a nice lingering finish. The maltiness hits up front, with some chewiness on the middle and finish. Pairs well with nice and spicy (veggie) brats. Not necessarily a ‘malt-bomb,’ and not one I’d seek out, but it’s solid, consistent, and one I could easily drink again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Brown sugar and some nice light spices push there way through the huge amount of malt. Dark fruits like figs, dates and plums shine through. Mellow citrus hangs on the back of the tongue.

Light hints of earthy hops and a little bit of spice. Mostly malts and cereal grains.  Taste: Big presence of sweet and bready caramel malts throughout the taste. Lots of wheat grains adding to the biscuit flavor as well. Hop presence is pretty subtle but just enough to add some balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Aroma- Has the average lager like aroma with malts and yeast upfront. Nothing much here.  Appearance- Received with a .5 finger head that dies immediately. Has a light amber color body that has great clarity. Very light lacing on the glass but present.  Flavor- Once again, is an average lager tasting beer. Has malts involved but not sweet. There is a yeasty background to these malts and then a bit of an amber taste. Low bitterness at the finish.  Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and then finishes like a Marzen.  Overall Impression- Nothing too serious this one. Just take it as it is, your average Oktoberfest brew. Very easy drinking but then has a bit of an amber taste throughout. Very different for this style but was just fine. Won't be enjoying again but as I'm drinking more Oktoberfest brews and other seasonals this Fall, I will enjoy comparing them.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

From the bottle: ""Samuel Adams Octoberfest is brewed with five varieties of malted barley for a deep amber color and a bigger richer flavor. It's everything we look forward to in Fall.""; ""In 1810, the Oktoberfest tradition was born when Munich celebrated the Crown Prince's wedding with a special beer and a 16-day party. Our version of this classic style blends rich malts for a hearty, smooth flavor with notes of caramel creating a brew that's perfect for the season, or whatever you're celebrating. Cheers! [undersigned] Jim Koch"".  A Pop! of the cap and the pour produced a finger of fluffy eggnog-colored head with excellent retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity, reminiscent of a former G/F's hair. Nose was rich and malty and very evocative of the style. Mouthfeel was medium and it was sweet in a toasted cereal way that reminded me of Wheaties, which my father would swear by. It was not cloyingly sweet, but more toasty sweet, if that makes any sense. I liked it simply because I do not like overly sweet anything. The finish was semi-sweet and very pleasant. Worth a try at this time of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,boilermakerbrew,3.71,"A- Pours an almost orange amber color. I think orange brown is the best way to put it, maybe it just makes me think of pumpkins for Halloween, I don't know. A tannish foamy head, about 2 fingers worth. Fairly decent lacing, probably better if I would ever clean my glasses better.  S- A subtle smell. Not overwhelming, but a fairly appealing aroma with a primarily malt overtone.  T- Malt, malt, and more malt, followed by a bit of a hoppy finish. This is the flavor I think of when I think of an Octoberfest. Something that might warm you up a bit on a cool night, but definitely drinkable.  M- Fairly light and easy to drink. The malt gives it some body that gives the overall mouthfeel an appealing weight. Very balanced on the carbonation end, it's there, but not so much carbonation as to draw your focus away from the flavor.  Overall, this could become a fall-time favorite.

35,102,Jesse13713,1.79,"Had this on tap at laundry 101 in Kent. Nothing like getting drunk while you wait for your laundry to finish.  Appearence - More yellow than orange when compared to the bottled version. A slight filmy head with little lacing. Appears highly carbonated.  Smell - Nothing worthy or noticeable stands out. Light fruits. Its missing the malts and sweet notes from the bottle variation.  Taste - okay. I was very impressed with this beer when it came out this year, and even titled it as my favorite Sam Adams beer. But this isn't the beer that I love. Must be a funky tap or something because this tastes like fruity champagne that was poisoned with alcohol. No delicious malts. No autumn, leafy breads or grains. Just uncomfortably fruity and fizzy. I call a bad tap here.  Mouth feel and overall - its okay once you get used to it. But this is nothing like what the bottle version I love tastes like. This is low quality, probably due to the locations error on a bad tap and pour. I won't be getting this again, not here anyways.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

No significant nose,very flat taste and an unusual watery mouthfeel made me sorry I bought a whole case. Very disappointed in what is customarily a dead-on example of a superb beer style. Not this year, however. It will go into the sauerkraut and brats preparations.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It poured with a thin off white head that eventually completely faded away, leaving only a ring of bubbles on the surface around the edge of the glass. S: There are light aromas of caramel malts and sweetness in the nose. T: The taste has some sweetness and malty flavors with notes of caramel. Only some hints of bitterness from the hops are noticeable, although there seems to be enough of a balance to keep the sweetness from being cloying. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.

Smell is very light citrus and some peppery notes. Kind of sweet and tart but also very light. Hard to really get a whiff of smell in this. Flavor packs a pretty decent punch. It is not light and thin except maybe a bit in the aftertaste. Green apple, toasted malts and some graininess on the tongue. A bit of a caramel note in there as well. A good easy drinker for sure. It does seem a bit undercarbonated as well. Otherwise it is pretty solid.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BarryMFBurton,3.5,"I don’t venture into the world of Sam Adams very much, but the talk surrounding Octoberfest is just too much too bear. Thankfully, the BBC always seems friendly to my wallet, so even if I end up not liking it, it will not have been a huge financial loss. Here’s to budget-friendly beer!  A: Well, there’s at least one thing you can always count on Sam Adams for: a gorgeous shine on the body. This one is a beautiful amber, which I would describe as more-or-less describe as the perfect fall color. The head starts off nice and thick, a cream-colored bit of heaven, but it degrades pretty quickly (and without a ton of lacing). Again, great color, though everything else is just decent.  S: Surprisingly complex – nutmeg, coriander, and cinnamon show themselves off in what could be called a warm tribute to witbiers. Underneath, there’s some good German barley and yeast, though I can still make out the skunk of cheap grains hiding in the background. Overall, though, the main scents of fruity wheat and banana esters come across quite nicely.  T: Just like every other Sam Adams I’ve tried, this tastes like the “light” version of some other full-flavored beer. At first, there are some chewy grains that introduce the palate quite nicely. There’s even hints of thick, malty caramel. Sadly, these fade fairly fast, as if they were only a taste of something that should have been more. A bit of German esters move in, and they prove less elusive than the malts, thankfully. The aftertaste ends on this yeasty note, along with a slight dryness that I’ve encountered only from Budweiser and Sam Adams. It’s very easy-drinking, but without a whole lot of distinct flavor.  M: Surprisingly creamy. Goes down smooth, with some chewiness in the grains, chalking this up as the first Sam Adams I’ve had that has a micro-brewed feel. Nicely done.  O: Why do I always keep getting Diet Sam Adams when I want the original one? But seriously folks…although this one has a bit of a deficiency as far as flavor goes, it has some tastes and aromas that are distinctly German. You can tell that BBC has the right idea, but this particular has only supported my hypothesis that they are “drink from the bottle,” not a “drink from the glass” brewery.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: Malt, and lots of it, there are some subtle herb, or hop aromas in the background  T: Sweet upfront, then a bit toffee and biscuit flavor, and finally a bit of hop bitterness to close it out nicely.  M: A nice medium body, not over the top and too heavy, but far from light, so yeah I'll say medium body.  O: I love this beer, it's big a malty brew, with just enough hops to balance it all out. It's no wonder Sam Adams has been producing this every year since 1989.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It tastes like toasted, caramel and bready malt, and a bit of dried fruit (apples?). Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick, is well carbonated and easy enough to drink.

I saw sams octoberfest and decided it was the most appealing beer in the fridge so I thought I would give it a shot.  It smells like a bud light and doesn't taste much different. The taste is flat, bitter, and just does not go down well. It is tasteless to tell the truth. I guess I am becoming a beer snob because this beer is straight up bmc to me now. I had a sierra nevada before this and the SN was leaps and bounds ahead of this. It is just not tasty, it is dry and leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

Mouthfeel is smooth and highly carbonated. This is a highly drinkable beer that is good for the summer to fall transition.  Overall, I thought the beer was fine, but nothing to get excited about.

It is very laid back, almost weak.  Taste: There is a strong barley flavor on the tongue on first sip. There is also some musty, slightly sour, and sweet tastes. In the background, near the finish is some cinnamon, biscuit malt, and wheat. Not bad.  Mouth feel: The mouth feel is medium, maybe a little watery. There is no snap from the carbonation.

35,102,paxchristi,3.56,"Poured from 12.oz bottle into tankard.  Appearance: Dark amber orange. Definitely malt-centric from its appearance. However, the head was quite possibly one of the worst examples of head I've seen. Even for a mid-sized brewery lager, its poor. Disappointed. A brewery like Boston Brew should be expected to do much better than this.  Nose: Totally malt-centric (as can be expected). It's very reminiscent of a very malty amber. Its fairly strong actually. A bit sticky in the nose. Probably from a hint of fruit juice.  Taste: Totally decent. Light malt-centric with some sticky juice and perhaps a bit of hops in the back. I like the balance. Its its strong point for this beer. The flavors jive well together.  Mouth: Clean, crisp, and very well carbonated.  Overall: I enjoy this beer. However, its not so good that it stands out amidst the sea of other Octoberfest beers. I keep the bottles of the ones that I think are worth remembering. Sadly, this one is going in the recycle bag.

35,102,Groomsy,3.8,"12 oz. bottle with ""Best by"" of January, poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: The beer pours a clear copper, almost light brown with highlights of orange in the light. Topped by a one-finger head of white foam that fades fairly quickly with spotty, wispy lacing in its wake. Carbonation is persistent and steady to the top of the glass. A nice looking brew.  Aroma: Along the same lines as some other offerings from SA, but enhanced - fruity hops (think green apples), a touch of grass, some caramel and grain sweetness, and just a kiss of fresh baked bread. Definitely has ""fall seasonal"" written all over it; just balanced enough to stake off any cloying sweetness from the malt, though a very malty beer overall. Digging it.  Taste: The malt takes the forefront of the taste with flavors of caramel and toffee, sugary and sweet. This is followed by a flash of herbal and grassy hops, which linger into the finish where flavors of bread hang around on the back of the tongue with some subtle flavors of honey. Very ""full"" and rounded malt flavor here, just kept in check by the hops. Not super-filling, but very crisp and refreshing. A nice drinking lager.  Mouthfeel: Rich medium body, but still crisp and refreshing. Maybe a little too heavy for sessionable drinking, but definitely fitting for a fall brew, and on par for Sam Adams' beers. Some kick from the carbonation, but not fizzy. Finishing flavors are slightly cloying, but not too bad.  Overall: Another nice seasonal from Sam Adams, and my personal favorite from their seasonal line-up other than Noble Pils. Not as good as I remember it being on tap, which I'll have to try again. Nevertheless, a supremely drinkable and full-flavored fall beer that's good for just about anything and can be found anywhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Bouquet is a sweet candy like malt and small fizz pop soda. Kind of odd but alright.  Taste is kind of lacking but has all the right ideas. Simple malt and light, some carbonation that is noticeable but has a medium sized body with a hint of thickness.

Not aromatic at all, I really had to get in there to smell this one.  T: Not bad overall, pretty balanced with lots of bready malt and a lagerlike clean finish. Lemon zest hops add something nice to it and theres also tones of toasted toffee. Has that signature Sam taste thats hard to define but permeates all of their beers. Not overly complex, but ok.

Flavor seems rather one-dimensional, but clean. Emphasis is on sweetness from the malt, but there's not much melanoidin or other grain flavors as I would expect from an Oktoberfest. Spicy hops make a very short appearance in the finish and linger for a few seconds in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is actually pretty good for a beer of this style. The body is full, but not overly so, and the finish is semi-dry without excessive sweetness.  Sam Adams might have played it a bit safe with their Octoberfest this year, as I remember previous vintages having more in the flavor department than this one.

35,102,CraftBeerTastic,2.68,"Ba Review #40 Served On: 8/18/2011 Glassware: Pint  Well it's Märzen season already. At least Boston Beer Co thinks so. Saw a 12 pack of their Octoberfest and grabbed it up.  Look: Poured a dark copper. A little darker than the Boston Lager. Initial head was a nice 3 fingers of tan foam. It disappeared quick and left a thin patchy film. Not much for carbonation bubbles.  Smell: Spicy hops with that typical Sam Adams malty twang. Also some breaddy lager yeast. I swear most of their offerings start out with the Boston Lager wort - then they just add flavoring in the finishing tanks. I guess it sort of smells like an Oktoberfest.  Taste: Ok, this was a Boston Lager without the sourness and a little heavier body to it. Maybe even a little more sweetness. Other than that, I fail to see any qualities that would make this beer stand out from all the other exceptional Octoberfests out there. I’m starting to see Boston Beer as a ‘Jack of all trades – master of none’.

That in mind, it should be a pretty interesting experience.  Pours a quite lively head. Color is a lively amber. Smell is quite intense for a lager, which is always nice.  First sip is wonderfully drinkable. You really get the full malt character coming through in this beer, with just the slightest hint of alcohol on the back pallet.  If I go back all the way to where I really started trying different beers other than light lagers, this one was the absolute first that I ever tried.

35,102,dpasotti,3.82,"Super-fresh Octoberfest is a perfectly clear copper-orange color with a slight ruby shade. Light gold highlights near the edges. One finger of off-white foam quickly dissipates to a tiny film and leave minimal lace. The aroma is dominated by toasty Munich malt with a little caramel underneath. Definite clean lager character, but there are some esters that remind me of English yeast. Slight herbal hop presence.  The taste is nearly identical to the smell, but the malt turns more to a light caramel flavor with a hint of sweetness. Surprisingly, the heavy toasted malt from the aroma takes a step back here, but it is still the main focus of the beer. No noticeable hop presence, but enough bitterness to perfectly balance. There's just a bit of alcohol, which would be welcome in most Märzens but is unexpected in such a modestly-sized one.  Body is medium in weight and carbonation. There's some creaminess that lingers after each swallow, which really adds some appeal to an otherwise unexciting beer. Good thing ""exciting"" is not really something Oktoberfests strive to be. Don't get me wrong. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Märzens (or Sam Adams for that matter), this is a solid brew that nails the style. It's also very versatile: mild enough to drink all night, but enough flavor to have with dinner. It is actually great with milder meals like rice & beans or a grilled chicken sandwich.

Grass or hay earthiness also comes to mind. Maybe even some sour red grapes.  The mouth is bright and light. Spot on for the style.  Overall I can't for the life of me figure out why people think this style is good or even okay. I can't stand the soggy bread taste or the sour grape or over ripe sun warmed melon taste.

The aroma was of a bread malt, mild floral hops and a doughy yeast with notes of caramel, a light fruity ester and a bit of spice.  The taste was very malty with a nice caramel sweetness and a slight fruitiness at first, then became lightly bitter and had a light spicy ending. The flavor lasted an average duration following the swallow, with a light spicy malty taste that was left to linger.

S: Lager - sweet and toast malts with clearly present (but not strongly so) hops that are herbal and somewhat woody.  T: Pretty hoppy & bitter for an O-fest. Nice herbal , woody, and slightly spicy European hop profile. Toasty and crackery maltiness with a hint of grainy sweetness and an estery fruit note.

35,102,BB1313,3.7,"12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a nice amber, white fluffy head, nice lacing, tansparent and thin. Lots of caramel, toffee, malts, grains. This is pretty sweet, due to the carmel. Faint hops. Finishes nice, but it has a thinner mouthfeel than I'd like; nicely carbonated. Drinkability isn't bad, the sweet taste has you coming back for more.  Not the top Oktoberfest, but it's up there. A nice beer to enjoy in the fall. I love the sweetness of it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,LuthersMug,3.53,"A - Dark copper hue with 1/2 inch light yellow tan head that retained pretty well. Thin lacing noted.  S - Average, not that strong. I noted some grains and bread, muted.  T - Some nice malts up front that lingered throughout. Well balanced, hints of grain, raisins, and pumpkin.  M - Slightly too much carbonation, but the beer has a good creamy texture.  D - A good solid beer for the Fall season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,FeDUBBELFIST,2.18,"Bottle to pint glass.  A: A half finger of foamy head with average retention, between off-white and light brown in color. The body is clear and a bright, medium value copper. An abundance of fast paced interior bubbles maintain the lingering film. Spare lacing.  S: Aside from toasted grain, there is very little to appreciate on the nose.  T: Almost lacking flavor altogether. Malt sweetness up front with light fruity undertones. The flavor falls off of a cliff mid-palate, likely due to the aggressive carbonation.  M: Medium body. The texture is creamy as the beer passes through your lips, just before the excessive carbonation prickles the tongue. Moderately dry on the finish. This beer becomes mildly cloying towards the bottom of the glass when the liveliness of the carbonation has worn itself out.  D: One of BBC's more uninspired brews. Not enjoyable to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A very mild bitterness in the background. T - Sweet maltiness rounded out with some dark fruit notes, particularly fig. M - Thinnish body with a fairly substantial amount of carbonation.

With time, all traces of head disappear as if the beer is flat. No lacing.  Smell: Strong, lagery sweet smell. Not much going on.  Taste: Very flavorful, with lots of creamy malt goodness balanced by subtle, herbal hops. There's a wealth of diverse and strong flavors of bread and grain, along with faint hints of spiciness and balancing hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Well-carbonated and creamy. Heightens the flavor.  Drinkability: Sam Adams Octoberfest is a standby for me, and this bottle delivered as well as any I've had in the past.  This is likely my favorite Märzen (though for some reason I've never tried Ayinger's), and is one of my favorite beers from Sam Adams.

Light to medium with a fairly high level of carbonation.  D. I wouldn't pick this up again.

A: Deep orange/amber with a one-finger offwhite head which quickly dissapates into a thin layer across the top of the entire beer. Lacing is pretty consistent throughout the session. A very nice looking beer.  S: Smells like caramel and yeast but I thought it was lacking a bit.  T: What it lacks in smell, it makes up for in taste. Nice malt and autumn spice characteristics, following by some slight hop bitterness.  M: Light/Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Crisp and refreshing.  D: Drinkability is pretty damn high on this one. Could easily spend the whole night drinking these.  Overall, it fits in well with Sam Adams' other beers.

35,102,Andreji,4.05,"A gift from my girl upon her return from a season in boston, a very timely deal she managed to get her hands on, i'd saved it to savour it with a friend and fellow beer lover.  So the pour was an instant reminder of the usual o-fest offerings the germans pull off. A nostalgic reminescence, since i haven't had my hands on anything of the sort in years now. Dark brown looking, fairly opaque almost dark wood toned, with a generous dark head that does however fade in a rather quick fashion.  The smell is a sweet and somewhat smokey roasted malt, a discrete participation from the hops here but nonetheless there; the overall is a sweet and grainly sensation.  However it struck me as interesting how little it correlates with the taste. one would expect a sweet caramel barley feel to hit you, but while the grainy, barley feel is there, the sweetness hardly is. The overall has a rather prune taste, just a tad sour and not sugary, and ever so slightly moldey. Very subtle hops at the end, hardly bitter at all. Indeed a full bodied and interesting mouthfeel, and a very well conceived beer by SA. too bad there's no chance of landing another one of those for a while for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Thick rings of lacing left behind.  S - Caramel malt, doughy bread, toasted malt, lightly nutty.  T - Rich caramel, fruit dipped in toffee, hints of brown sugar and cotton candy, some lager yeast in the background. Subtle hops add a faint spice note and cuts some of the sweetness.  M - Superb! Medium body, soft a creamy.  This is my favorite fall beer. It is almost perfect. When I think of fall this is the first thing that pops into my head. I honestly don't know how anyone could not find this beer full of glorious flavor. I wish they sold this year around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

D - Excellent.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S - Sweet carmel malt smell with some nice toffee elements. Also a hint of bread/yeast in the aroma.  T - Starts with malty sweetness. Followed by just a hint of hop taste and a nice amount of spice flavors. The finish is mostly of the spices and some nice bread/yeasty hints. There is also a nice lingering spiciness.  M - Medium-light bodied with a nice amount of assertive carbonation. Feels really crisp and smooth overall.  D - Very drinkable beer.

I had to strain to smell anything for a few minutes. When the aroma faded in, it wasn't too bad - musty, yeasty, faintly boozy and medicinal. The flavor touches on the style pretty well. Sweet, dense, smooth malty base with some strong shortbread/butter cookie overtones and a spicy/zesty orange peel nip to it. Nice level of carbonation carries the malt feel and flavor quite well.

35,102,TheBrewo,3.31,"We pour a translucent red orange colored brew (nicely matching the leaves adorning the bottle's label), with a one and a half finger orange-tinged head. The big bubbles of the head dissolve quickly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma consists largely of malts, faintly toasted, with notes of mild lemon and esters, and tinny metals. The taste begins with a mouthy sweetness. This carries through, but quickly develops to include a bit of spice and apricot, and the slightest hop character to smooth things out. The metallic feel from the nose comes through to dominate the aftertaste. The mouth is neither dry nor coated by the end of the sip, but the medium body and moderate to low carbonation are satisfying. With a less than robust taste and a middle of the road body and feel, this beer is easy enough to throw back.  Overall, this beer has a nice look, but lacks strength in the aroma and taste departments. While we would have liked to see a bolder and thicker beer for the style, it remained adequate throughout.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,MNJR,3.28,"This is a decent beer from Sam Adams. I would probably never order a SA again, but this was cheap at my local store, so I thought I'd give it a go. The initial head is stupendous - really thick, whipped foam. It gives way fairly soon, but the lacing is dense and even. The color is rich copper, mostly clear with about a 10% haze. I smell cocoa or chocolate milk immediately, with not a lot else Underpinning this is malt, but again little else. The flavor is chewy, sweet, caramel, prune, medium spice and chocolaty malts finishing it off. Mainly true to the style, but the cocoa is a new twist. The mouthfeel suffers from stickiness and tongue goop which repeated sips do not wash down. Drinkability is low. I wouldn't have more than one. Even though it is not bad in any serious way, it just doesn't merit another purchase.

Clean malty caramel, hint of bread, moderate sweetness, slightly earthy dryness in the finish, relatively thin body, a number of the bottles including this one have been a little overcarbonated to the point of slightly prickly.

Maybe it's just a style of beer I don't appreciate, but I'm not impressed yet.  Lightly toasted grains with subtle hop bitterness. Fairly clean flavor over all with a bright crisp bitterness. A nice sweetness and subtle fruitiness. What impresses me most is the clean freshness to this beer.  Slightly thin body with subtle carbonation.

Light citric and herbal Noble hops. Sweet overall.  T: Caramel and toffee. Grassy, citric hops are more apparent than they were in the nose. Finishes with all of these flavors working in tandem, as well as some drier bready and grainy malts.  M: Moderate with good carbonation. Crisp and creamy.  D: Good, but not as easily quaffable as other examples of the style.  Notes: A decent beer. Distinct caramel aromas and flavors are a bit too dominant, but otherwise this is a solid offering.

Smell is a little weak; upfront adjuncts of sour grapes, some faint nuts and caramel malt aromas. Taste has much more going for it over aroma. Starts with faint fruit, than toasty sweet nuts and grains, moving to a good balanced hops flash and then fading out on a spicy almost cinnamon note.

The color however, was awesome. A slightly burnt amber represents the season very well and it was a beautiful welcome to the beverage.  The aroma was good, possibly because I knew what to expect. If I tried to be objective, the smell is not great, but still good. Octoberfest is lightly carbonated, producing a good mouthfeel, but it was not as smooth as it could have been. While drinking the beer, it is difficult to tell the alcohol content, but after a couple of glasses, it become prevalent.

App-Medium Amber colored with a single finger head that was very carbonated.  Smell- It smelled like a giant malt bomb to me. I did detect a slight spicy scent with maybe a touch of caramel.  Taste- Not what I remembered this to be at all. It didn't jump out at me like the normal Sam Adams does which I think are pretty decent. It was a bit sweet and didn't retain a lot of flavor.  Mouth- It's on the thin side but I didn't think it would be a big beer by any means.  Drink- I'm pretty thankful I didn't buy a case of this year. It wasn't bad. Just not my cup of tea I guess.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TheQuietMan22,3.41,"Appearance: Straight pour into a pint glass. The color is red with copper undertones. Two fingers to white head dissipated very quickly to leave a skim of lacing and ring around the edge. No bottle cap can float on that.  Smell: Subdued sweet caramel, molasses, and a little dark chocolate.  Taste: Much like the aromas, the typical märzen flavors are very subdued. The caramel comes through, though the molasses and dark chocolate from the smell are faint at best. A spicy hop backbone dominates throughout the pint.  Drinkability: Decent, but it is far from my favorite märzen.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,deadbody,3.38,"Good but not great beer pretty much sums it up. Picked up a 24 pack of bottles for really cheap. Pours a nice deep amber, small head that doesn't last very long. Slight malty smell, Taste is fine, no flavors really jump out at you, but nothing bad either. Good mouthfeel, not too thin. Very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,socon67,3.83,"Poured into a pint glass.  A - Dark amber color. Creamy white foam head.  S - A little bit of the caramel malt, but not much after that.  T - A nice spicy, malty taste. Also a sweet caramel finish.  M - Very smooth. Low carbonation & medium bodied.  D - Very much so. This guy is made for the fall and for throwing back a few in the fall.  I happen to like this one, and its a favroite of the BBC line.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,goalie33,3.46,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. A: Very nice orange/amber color. Not so much head. S: Some slight aromas of malt, but nothing overly impressive. T: Malty taste, not too much in the way of hops. It's good, but nothing special. D: Very drinkable. Goes down very easy.  I'm not going to go running out to buy this again. It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't especially good either.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BillyBob78,3.83,Bought a case of this after having it at a local bar.  I'm starting to like Sam Adams more and more. They have so many different types and styles that you can find something you enjoy.  Appearance was a nice orange/brown color with a nice off-white head with decent lacing.  Taste like a good German lager with nice sweet malty characteristics and a little hops present but not much. A little bit of spices coming through.  Very drinkable and definitely a good fall beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,HockeytownBrew,4.73,"Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint Glass  A: Beautiful amber is the first thing that pops out as this brew is poured. Nice sized head that leaves behind a good amount of lacing.  S: Great, malty smell with a hint of fruitiness. Smells perfectly of fall.  T: Wow! Autumn to a tee. A sweetness and spiciness blend perfectly together on your palate with a bit of a hop finish. Perfectly balanced. The perfect combination of five different kinds of malt.  M: Perfect amount of carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  D: I could easily put away a few of these, and drinking one will make you want another right away. It's that good.  It's truly a shame that Samuel Adams Octoberfest is only a seasonal beer. A true triumph. After only one bottle, it instantly became second favorite beer behind Boston Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,msjacilynn,3.68,"A: pours a clear, clean amber with orange-ish hue.  S: out of bottle I got an initial musky scent, but that decreased as I drank. otherwise plenty of malt and caramel.  T: Initially hit with malty-bready taste that leaves a sweet aftertaste.  M/D: fairly pleasant in texture and well carbonated for the style. easy drinking Oktoberfest beer...not the best, but one of the better ones.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,gatorguy,3.58,"Pours a hearty orange color with a nice finger and a half white head that fades and leaves a good bit of lacing. Smell has hints of caramel and malts. Taste is strong on malts, with the smell being true has there is hints of caramel. Not much in the way of hops, but has a clean finish. Drinkability is pretty good, not exactly a session beer but can easily drink a few more. I've always been a fan of Sam Adams and Octoberfest is another fine offering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Dadoftwogirls,3.88,This is one of the few Sam Adams that I have tried that I've rated above average to date. It has a great appearance and a great deep complex favor that actually appealed to me. It pours with a 3 finger head straight down the middle of the glass. A nice dark appearance in the glass. Overall one of their better offerings in my book and I could drink a few in one sitting.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bobsy,3.76,"Its great to see another oktoberfest turning up on Ontario shelves, even if it isn't one of the classics.  Lovely looking pour results in a rusty orange liquid and a finger of creamy off-white head that leaves streaks of lacing as it drops to a film. Sweet, bready aroma, with a prominent herbal character and some mineral qualities.  The flavour is dominated by a big breadiness that stumbles into brown sugar. Great herbal hopping, faint grassiness and a hard mineral character. Kind of neat. Surprisingly drying on the palate, with a well-judged carbonation and medium body that works well for the style.  It certainly won't be the best oktoberfest you'll find, but it is a decent rendition of the style, and has what I crave for most on an o-fest - drinkability.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Huhzubendah,3.58,"It's October, after all...  A: The beer is transparent with plenty of bubbles ascending from the depths. The color is an autumn shade of orange, akin to the changing hues of the leaves. There is about an inch of off-white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing.  S: It smells like a lager. The sweetness is subtle, with hints of fruit.  T: A nice take on a traditional German classic. The beer is mostly malty, with very little hop presence. It's slightly sweet and fruity, with notes of grain and/or barley.  M: The feel is thicker than I expected, in a pleasant way. There is a slight hint of astringency and/or alcohol in the finish that counteracts the otherwise fabulous feel on the palate.  D: 'Tis the season. It's not my favorite choice within the style, but it goes down just fine.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Aphexwolf,3.83,"Appearance: Dark amber-orange, light to medium head, good carbonation. Smell: Sweet and malty Taste: Medium hops, slightly sweeter and maltier than Boston Lager. Can detect some caramel. Mouthfeel: Medium frothy, slight bittersweet aftertaste. Nice. Drinkability: Good. Can drink several quickly, but would rather saver them slowly. Summary: This is a very good beer. I gave it an 8.1/10, or B-. This beer is very similar to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but it's sweeter and maltier. It has several food pairings, but tastes great by itself. It's a good choice to enjoy during Octoberfest. I look forward to drinking this beer again next year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,scottakelly,3.7,"A clear, dark orange color with hints of amber and red and a slightly off-white colored head. Decent lacing throughout the beer. Smells of toasted grains which brings thoughts of autumn. Flavor is dominated by toasted grain, with a backbone of caramel sweetness. Almost no hop presence. This beer is a little on the sweet side for my tastes in an octoberfest. Drinkability is pretty good, since I had two of these in short order.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CHickman,3.03,"Pours a clear amber with a huge 3 finger foamy beige head that stuck around a while and left decent lacing that slid down the glass fast.  Smells of sweet malt, wet bread, grains, earth tones like grass or hay and some faint hops; a decent nose, but no odor really jumps out with excitement.  Tastes of sweet malt, toasted grains, caramel, hay, yeast (as there is a metallic taste to it), herbs like tea leaf, faint hops and a sweet sugar mixed in somewhere; this seems to be a conservative beer that borders on dull. All the right flavors are there to make up a good beer, but they are all muted like not enough ingredients were used while making this brew. The flavor is decent, perhaps even bordering on good, but just so weak that the follow through does not excite the taste buds.  Mouthfeel is creamy with very little carbonation that was very light, along with a light, crisp body and overall feel. This beer flowed down easy with zero resistance due to it's light crisp nature.  High drinkability, as this would be a session beer if it tasted better. Disappointing for Sam Adams to not succeed with this one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,VelvetExtract,3.5,"A-Dark amber in color. Pretty good sized head. Leaves lacing.  S-Deeply malty with nuts and spices and a tiny hop aroma.  T-Malty. Nuts and barley. Small amount of bitterness. Tastes like a Boston Lager on the back in in my opinion. Not a very strong taste but still not bad.  M-Medium bodied, not too much carbonation.  D-Relatively easy to drink.  Haven't had many Octoberfests but this one seems like its a good initiator into the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,OWSLEY069,3,"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, quite fruity and earthy. In the taste, just like the smell, fruity and earthy, still quite lager like. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, earthy aftertaste. A bit sweet, but ok nonetheless.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,azorie,2.95,"Every year I try this style: Most of the time every year the American versions leave me wondering why do I try these every year?  A: Served in a shaker pint glass. dark mahogany-tinted orange, with a small off-white head on top. Light lace.  S: Sweet caramel toasted malt, and little to no hops, very sweet.  T: humm not to style, way too sweet. Lots of coffee candy toffee like malt that overpowers my taste buds. Kind of boozy hot after taste. Tap or bottle both suck down to average to me.  M: medium to semi heavy, medium carbonation  D: not very, way to sweet for the style, I will pass on this one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,tylernim,3.48,"This has a dark copper appearance, and held a thing ring around the glass the entire way. Not much from the smell. Some sweet malts maybe. Subtle spices on the tongue. Some maltiness with something along the lines of raisin, a touch of hop. There is a pleasant carbonation on the tongue, with a light to medium feel. This one has a good drink ability. Don't know that I would pick it up on my own accord, but if I find it at a bar I might have a couple.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Onenote81,3.2,"I've had this beer so many times, it's sickening. Honestly though, with all of the great Festbiers out there, why do I always get this one in bulk?? Just realized I've never reviewed this one from the bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a darker mahogany-tinted orange, with a small off-white head on top. Light lace. Scents of caramel, toasted malts, and light booze.  The body is moderate. Good depth. Clean finish. I don't know, this years batch seems way sweet. Lots of candy-like sweetness, caramel, toffee. The finish is odd as well with heavy ethanol. Not pleasant. This is so much better on tap. It's drinkable because it's accessible, but I'd pass on this for better O'fests if available for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,beerprovedwright,3.8,"This pretty brown amber beer poured a one finger head of off white bubbles, which calmed down in about a minute leaving a very thin ring around my glass. The color of the brew rates a 17 on the SRM beer color chart. A sweet smell of pumpkin, wheat, malt, and spices fill my nose. The taste is sweet caramel, malt, and roasted wheat. Smooth and light in the mouthfeel category. Good beer for this time of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mdaschaf,3.67,"A: Clear amber with a very small head and little lacing.  S: Malty aroma with a sweetness as well. A very small hop kick as well.  T: Caramel and lightly roasted malts. Not as sweet as the nose. The hops are mild on the flavor as they were on the nose.  M/D: Medium bodied and pretty smooth. Overall it is a fine fall choice, not amazing, but definitely serviceable. I had this at a restaurant where it was the only ""craft"" choice. I feel that places like that it is always a good choice, but I probably won't go out and grab it for the house.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,massshortage,3.98,"From the bottle it pours a brilliant amber with impressive clarity. Head froths up nicely but doesn't have much retention; it falls to a low ring pretty quickly.  Smell is obviously malty, with a distinct sweetness and a subtle alcohol sharpness.  Tastes only slightly sweet like caramel. Toasty malt is definitely the big flavor, with a bit of nuttiness to go with it. Medium mouth feel with refreshing carbonation. The hop bitterness is subtle, but balances well with the sweetness.  Notes: Probably my favorite of the Sam Adams seasonal brews. I look forward to this one coming every year. Makes me miss Boston, as it's much harder to find on tap in CA. Bottled just isn't the same. This is one beer which I have noticed being distinctly better served on tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CBlack85,3.38,"On tap at the Tilted Kilt in Charlotte. Served in a pint glass.  This beer is a orange-ish/copper color with a small off white/tan head. Decent head retention and a small amount of lacing. Fairly standard appearance for the style.  The nose is caramel and toasted malt, with some floral and spicy hops. Very clean aroma, seems to be a little sweeter than most Oktoberfests.  The flavor is very similar to the nose, with the caramel and toasted malt flavors being the main attraction. The hops are very mild and hidden in the background. As the beer warms the hops start to open up a little, but still are barely noticeable. There is a overly sweet and fruity taste throughout the beer. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Fairly easy to drink, with the exception of the fruity twang that is at some times overpowering.  Overall this is a decent beer that does little to set itself apart from the pack. Not bad, but I have had many better Oktoberfests this year...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Not a whole lot of bubbles/carbonation and a fair amount of lacing.  Aroma was of malts and spices typical of the style, with no hop smell. Taste was nice and crisp, with no bitterness and a strong malt presence, slightly sweet. Mouthfeel was smooth; medium body with a dry malt aftertaste.

Faint off-white crown recedes almost instantly to a vague collar and delicate surface slick.  Interesting mix of pale and caramel malt lend honey and bread notes to the aroma. Vague caramel candy hints as well.  Ritz crackers, caramel, and bread crusts lead into a smooth grassy bitterness that persists into the finish. The noble hops are lasting and lend a subtle complexity to an otherwise lackluster effort. No toast, and the finish is somewhat sweet despite the hops.  Light bodied, but soft and slightly creamy. Carbonation seems a bit low.  Easy drinking, but not terribly interesting even for the style...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The aroma of this beer is full of toasty and nutty malt. Caramel, toffee and herbal hops are also present in the aroma, but it is overall a bit subdued.  The flavor is full of rich malty character. Toffee, caramel, brown sugar, nuts and toasted bread. Mostly sweet, but with bit of a floral hop character as well. This beer has a nice malt character that I find to be very enjoyable.  The mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. This beer did not seem exceptionally dry, but the finish is strikingly so with sticky malt and herbal hops hanging on my palate.  This is pretty drinkable, but the finish is a bit of a turn off.

35,102,weizenbob,3.35,"This was on tap at Sportsmans Irish Pub in Ludington, MI. There's something wonderfully absurd in ordering an American interpretation of a German lager at a faux-Irish pub.  This Sam Adam's Octoberfest came served in an imperial pint glass and looks incredible. There is very little head, actually just a ring of bubbles around the top of the glass. The color is a deep appealing copper hue and this lager is amazingly clean looking. Gazing through an imperial pint glass, this looked very impressive.  The scent was just as inviting. Aromas of spice and tropical fruits persist, but there's a lot going on here, so much so that it's difficult to pinpoint specifics.  Unfortunately the taste of this brew didn't live up to the complex aroma that it was giving off. I should mention that lager-style beers really aren't my thing. However, the look and smell of this really gave off the impression that it was going to be something special. What I got was an above average but unremarkable tasting lager. It seems to be pretty good for the style, but it isn't making a believer out of me.  Carbonation was moderate, though it was still a bit more than I care for. As such, the mouth-feel was a turnoff. It was a pretty crisp beer, and the flavor was strong enough to overcome the carbonation, but ultimately this really just isn't my cup of tea.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste/Mouthfeel: Thick caramel syrup. Makes this a bit too watery and uncarbonated. It's still good overall, with nice hops.  Drinkability: Highly refreshing (and filling) at a footall tailgate.  Overall: Like I said, refreshing, especially during the fall. Would definitely drink this during the right time. Definitely better than Great Lakes Oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A- Pours a nice clean copper with a fingers worth of white head that left a collar that stayed till the end.  S- Lots of sweet caramel malts and lots of breadyness. The smell isn't that profound.  T- Typical marzen, a good balance of caramel malts and toasted bread, rounded out by a little bitter hops that helps tie all the flavors together.  M- A little on the thin side and a little under carbonated.  D- Well it is a marzen so it would have to be a complete fuck up for it to not have good drink ability. I would easily accept the challenge to drink a 6 pack.  Overall i thought this was a good Octoberfest beer, spot on for its style, besides its mouthfeel.

Amber/copper color, very little lacing on the sides of the glass.  This is a malty beer- 5 styles used for this. I definitely find this to be the predominant ingredient and you can taste it. I get a little hop bitterness, but very little. Maybe that could be more pronounced?  For an octoberfest style, this is a good one to drink all night.

Crisp and slightly hoppy. Can taste a slight touch of alcohol. Good flavor combination for the fall season. Leaves a nice roasted taste lingering.  m: Medium bodied and smooth with pleasant amount of carbonation. Surprisingly rich feeling.  d: This beer was very easy to drink.

35,102,JohnnyP3,4.42,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Best before Jan 2011. Pours a copper orange with one finger of white head. Clear with what looks like ample carbonation.  Smells include malts, biscuits, sweetness, some grassy hops, caramel, and toasted grains. Nice boutique of aromas.  Tastes like a quality Marzen/Oktoberfest--true to the style with a nice backbone of malts with some caramel/toffy sweetness and a nice shot of bitterness to balance things out some. Finishes with a nice biscuit-like dryness. Toasty and malty, this is cool-fall weather reliable standby.  Mouthfeel has a nice crispness to complement the snap of cool air outside. Perfect amount of carbonation.  Drinkability--one of the most drinkable in this style category that I have had. Goes down very easily. There is just something quintessential about the fall time and this beer. Call it nostalgia or just a quality brew--either way, this one scores repeatedly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,greengorilla,4.3,"I poured this from a 12 ounce bottle into a mug. It is a nice copper color with a good thick white head and nice lacing.  It smells good and malty.  This is what I believe an Oktoberfest beer should taste like. It has a great balance of bready malt taste with the right amount of spicy hops.  I like the mouthfeel, and it is very drinkable. This is a great beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kbutler1,3.16,"Draft. Pours a brownish amber color with a 2 finger fluffy white head. Biscuity, malty type notes in the nose along with some nut. No lace as the head settles in my glass. The taste is slightly sweet with flavors of lightly toasted grains with some biscuit. Maybe a slight touch of floral as well. Ends pretty cleanly and dry. Not bad and an easy drinker but nothing out of this world.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,DJED69,3.71,"Now this is more like it. A very nice example of the style. Picked up a couple bombers recently as they were fresh and cheap. This is the third Oktoberfest I've tried and the best so far. Pours a great orange-amber with a fluffy off-white head. The beer is perfectly carbonated and has nice head retention, lacing to the bottom of glass. Taste is mostly malt with a hit of hop bitterness. Very tasty. May be my new favorite Marzen. I'll just have to crack the next bomber to confirm!!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Soonami,3.58,Sam Adams Octoberfest is widely available and a pretty good example of the style for people that are just starting to venture from the mainstream path. It's a very malty beer with a lot of breadiness and chewiness. The beer is moderately sweet with touch of noble hop flavor and bittering. I think beter examples of the style maintain that rich toasted malt flavor without the sweetness and more acute bittering. An easy to drink beer that would probably please most people,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,shand,3.79,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle marked best by February 21st into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep red-orange with about 3 fingers of head. Head retains to about a centimeter worth. Looks really great.  Smell: It's kind of a let-down smell wise actually. Some slightly sour hops and some nutty malts. Doesn't really smell that great to be honest.  Taste: But thankfully, it tastes fantastic! I'd hesitate to put this in the same realm as a normal Oktoberfest, there's a lot in common with the Sam Adams Boston Lager here for sure, but for what it is it really tastes great. It opens up with some sweet, nutty malts, with some fruits and spices in there. A bit of bitter hops come in at the end to temper the sweet hops. Very well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: Goes down very smooth and refreshing. No complaints at all, it feels just heavy enough for the style, without any unneeded heft.  Drinkability: This is very drinkable for the style, I tend to have a problem drinking too many Oktoberfests because the spices start to grate on me, but this one is very easy to drink.  This is a great, widely available beer that's got a lot to offer. Check it out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,morebeergood,3.33,"On tap last night at The North Star, a bar over by North Station. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark amber color. Thin white head. Slight bit of lacing. Smell had just a hint of cinnamon and brown sugar to it, but not very much. Taste was slightly above average. A dose of malt hits the palate, but there really was not a lot of other flavors. The mouthfeel was a disappointment, as I found it be be thin and slightly watery. Drinkability was decent, as it's smooth and easy going down. SA Octoberfest is an acceptable version of the style for the mass market, but there are much more flavorful Märzen beers out there made by local breweries, which should be sought out instead.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Nerudamann,3.38,"Look - deep amber/dark copper color, clear. Good head and good carbonation.  Smell - Hoppiness is present, but not overwhelming. Maybe a hint of a nuttiness to it.  Taste - Very smooth, only slightly bitter at the beginning. Good combination of barley. Almost no aftertaste. Doesn't seem to have a lot of additives, just higher quality hops.  Mouthfeel - very well-balanced, but only slightly on the creamy side in texture. Very smooth.  Drinkability - There seems to be a fair bit of complexity here, but only for a hoponista. Otherwise though, a good-tasting beer, smooth, and not terribly filling.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It's a decent beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,QuestionableScum,3.42,"Pours a orangey amber colour with an off white head that dissipates quickly and is quite fizzy in character.  Smells slightly grainy with honey, a tad bit of floral hoppiness and a little bit of an apple like smell.  Tastes is initally very malty with brown sugar, carmal malts and breadiness/biscuitiness up front. Finishes with a very slight metallic hoppy bite. The aftertaste is somewhat unpleasant, and is slightly metallic.  Mouthfeel is lightbodied but quite pleasant, carbonated nicely. Not overly thin.  Drinkability is high but given that the beer is not really impressive that is not all that much of a big deal.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MattyV,3.43,"Pours a clear amber-orange with a thin fizzy off-white head.  Aroma is sweet, smells of bread and a hint of honey. Very faint floral hoppiness started to become apparent after some warming.  Taste is very malty, more specifically bready malt with a touch of sweetness and spice. Couldn't pick up very much in the way of hops.  Thin-bodied and slightly overcarbonated IMO.  Goes down very easy despite the maltiness, but I just wish there was a touch more hoppiness to balance things out and add a layer of complexity.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cratez,3.87,"355ml bottle from a six pack purchased at the LCBO. Pours a clear amber hue with orange highlights and one finger of cream coloured head. No lace on my glass. Smell and taste are herbal, grassy, and slightly floral hops, biscuit, bread crusts, caramel, toasted oats, a honey-like sweetness, cereal grains, and a crisp hop spiciness to even things out. Mouth feel is creamy, medium, foamy carbonation, some bite on the palate, drying semi-sweet finish. A tasty, satisfying and easy drinking O-Fest, which is exactly what the style calls for. I will definitely buy this again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Left a moderate amount of lacing.  S: Beer. Nothing special, just smelled like a macro beer.  T: Malts, biscuit/bread, a tiny bit of sweetness, maybe some caramel, pumpkin, and a bit of butterscotch. Bready finish.  M: Decent amount of carbonation, a little chewy, I'd say medium bodied.  D: Not hard to put a few back if you want. I wasn't a fan so one was my limit.  I wasn't a fan of this, which was disappointing.

T- Light sweet malt with a watery feel. No hops!  M- Very light-bodeid.  D- Dinkablity is a little above average.It has more of a sweetness and malt signiture than most macros but im not impressed.  This beer is very dissapointing. Almost every Sam Adams product taste the same, especially their ales.

The malt comes across as biscuity and bready, and the hops are floral and somewhat spicy in the nose.  T: Lots of flavor, and nice malt flavor here. There is biscuit and bread flavor, with a tiny bit of malt sweetness, before finishing out to a clean noble hop bitterness.  M: Low to medium body, crisp and clean on the mouth.  D: The malt is very present here, but the drinkability is not detracted from, considering the smoothness and crispness of this beer. I couldn't slam a ton of them. but they are drinkable enough.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Shrews629,3.77,"Appearance - Nice amber, copper color with some red highlights peeking through. Slightly off white head that didn't hang around too awful long, but did settle to a fine ring. Not a lot of lacing left on the glass however.  Smell - Picking up a fair amount of malt along with that dry earthy, ""leafy"" smell. Touches of caramel malt coinciding with the bread and biscuit nose that have become more prominent as the beer warms.  Taste - Again picking up the malt with what I detect as butterscotch. Rather pleasant I think. A little bit of the breadiness coming through at the end, which I tend to favor.  Mouthfeel - Medium, dry, crisp, chewy mouthfeel. Nice dry maltiness really sticks to the tongue until the next sip.  Drinkability - I could put a few of these back during one setting with no problem. Personally, I think Sam Adams does a great job with most of their seasonal brews. I actually really appreciate all they do for craft brewing. This beer really sets the mood for those crisp, cool Fall afternoons.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The aroma is sweet and bready, a little toasty with a hint of cane molasses.  The taste is sweet malt with a light herbal bitterness in the finish. Very bready, almost doughy. Slight metallic tinge in the finish. While enjoyable as it is, I wouldn't mind a bit more bitterness to balance the malty sweetness.  Medium bodied, carbonation is on the low side.

It pours a nice 1/2 inch tan head. Good retention.  S: Good strong aroma when first poured, but mellows out quick. Sweet malt and caramel aroma. Not much of a hop smell to it. It has a tiny alcohol scent to it as well.  T: Needless to say, it has the very distinct Samuel Adams' taste to it. It does provide a little more than that though. It has a smooth roasted taste with a little bite from the hops. The aftertaste is the best part, nice caramel note left after the bitterness of the hops fades. You get a little bit more out of every sip.  M: Light to medium mouthfeel. Kind of heavy on the carbonation. Very similar to most Samuel Adams.  D: I like this as a session beer. It does make you a little gassy but I can put that a side and pick up a sixer.  This is by far one of Sam Adams' best beers.

Lots of buttery caramel malt. Some dark fruit. It just leads you to thinking of sweetness. This one has some cheaper malt hints, probably due to adjuncts.  T- Follows the nose. Lots of malt up front, caramel and grainy. Bready and buttery notes. Pretty high sweetness. Some earthy and grassy hops. Some dark cherry-like fruit notes. These flavors are nice but the obvious adjunct malt flavors lingering in the background throw it off completely.  MF- Moderate, somewhat creamy body with high end carbonation. Just a bit bitter.  DB- A flavor suitable for autumn but the sweetness and adjunct lager-like malt flavors hurt it. It tastes ""cheap"" at points but I still wouldn't call it a bad beer.

Taste is nice--full on flavor with a fairly robust body without being too big to detract drinkability. Texture is silky smooth coupled with a good level of carbonation. Those malts really work well together, giving a bready, just barely sweet full flavor, followed up by a firm bitterness. For me, a good O'fest has to be drinkable by the liter.

35,102,clarkm04,3.39,Appearance- Very deep amber/coppery color with a slight white head retention with light to medium carbonation.  Smell- Hints of malt. Not much hops in the smell profile.  Taste- Fairly malty on the front and back end. Not much in the order of hops (which is typical for this style). Not as malty as I would want. Slightly watery in the mid-taste. I really enjoy the aftertaste of this beer. It's very smooth and leaves a nice malty note.  Mouthfeel- Fairly mild but there is a harsh mouthfeel on the back of the tongue that hovers and distracts from what overall is a very nice mouthfeel.  Drinkability- Very high.  Overall- A good Octoberfest. Certainly not in the league of the outstanding German varieties but is a good beer in a pinch. I've had his beer on tap at a craft devoid Buffalo Wild Wings and have enjoyed it both times.

35,102,dfitch81,3.8,"I'm a big fan of Ayinger and Paulaner's Oktoberfest brews. IMHO, when it comes to Märzens these two are the ones to beat - a feat that Sam Adams' Octoberfest does not manage. That said, however, Sam Adams' interpretation has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. This is a highly satisfying, well-crafted Märzen. Even better, its less expensive than the Germans and its brewed right here in the grand ol' US of A.  Color is a perfect autumnal copper-orange. There is room for improvement in the head, which quickly thins and ends up as a whispy ring confined to the sides of the glass. Lacing is entirely absent.  Smell was barely there at first. I had to really bury my nose in the glass to pick anything up. Eventually detected faint aroma of caramel and alcohol. Nose emerged more fully with warming, with the alcoholic character giving some ground to a subtle spiciness (nutmeg, a little cinammon).  Tastes of caramel with a hint of honey, pronounced toasted crackery malts, minimal hopiness - just enough to contain the sweetness. Subtle spiciness detected in the nose is also present here. Smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation complements the flavor perfectly, and although the palate definetly leads toward the sweet side, this is still quite drinkable.  All in all this is a very good - if not great - beer. Recommended without reservation, would buy this again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The flavor is also malty, with a little bitterness in the finish. I feel as though it conforms well to the style. There are some good caramel flavors. The beer has a medium body.

Toasty malts, light caramel, cereal grain, some grassy and floral hop notes, baked bread aftertaste. Flavors start to fall apart towards the end, somewhat of a pattern I've found in a few SA beers.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but has a nice creamy texture from all the malts. Carbonation on the low side.  I have a soft spot for Oktoberfests, the smell and taste instantly remind me of fall. This one in my opinion is solid, a bit bland, but one I will probably get every year because of availability, price and session-ness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cooch69,3.96,"I had this on Tap at Smokey Bones. It poured a very dark copper with a medium carbonation. It was really a beutiful color. There was only a small head and it did'nt last very long. I'll have to say, this beer did'nt really have much of a scent to it. It was caramely and I also smelled a slight sweetness in it. Plus there was a trace of hops in the nose but again not very pronounced scent. This Oktoberfest hit the spot pretty good. Especially with some of the food there. It was really caramelly and biscuity with a trace of hops in the back. But malt dominates and it did have a really good taste to it. To my liking anyways. I'm never really got into Oktoberfest's as much as I could have, but this year I am starting to appreciate this most festivus style a bit more.

35,102,merddyn2002,3.85,This is so far my favorite octoberfest. It's a good balance between malty and hoppy without being overly bitter. Great aroma and almost nutty / spicey flavor.

It gets better as it warms.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smells of caramel malts with some brown sugar in the background. Hops are minimal at most.  The taste is smooth. Caramel malts and brown sugar come first with a minimal amount of bitterness. It's okay but not overwhelming.  I like it in the mouth. Maybe a micron too carbonated or maybe it's just right. I've had other beers I like the feel of better and then again I've had beers that I like the feel of worse.  I like this especially at this time of year. Just seems to be a staple of the fall season in my house. Really good to tailgate with.

35,102,RickS95,3.73,"I've had this beer before but it's been a long, long time. I don't recall it being quite so dark, as it pours a dark brown with a thin tan head.  It was served at a restaurant and it was extremely cold, keeping a lot of the scents in check but I could pick up on the standard issue fall spices. Some flowery hops and allspice come to mind.  The taste was better than I remember. Again, the flowery hops and spices come immediately to mind. My memory tells me the spices were much more relaxed in this glass than in the past, and again, I blame it on the temperature...but that's a good thing in this case.  It lacked the hoppy, spicy bite of a lot of Oktoberfests, but again, that's a good thing in this case. There was a laidback sweetness, but the beer finished with nothing but spices.  I enjoyed the 32-ounce mug more than any bottle I can recall. I look forward to another.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,COBeerBuff,3.23,"Killing time on a Friday afternoon and figured I'd review one of these beers finally...  Appearance: Poured into a pint glass with a dark amber hue and a solid finger of eggshell colored head. Decent head retention yields a bit of sticky malty lacing around the edges of the glass.  Smell: The label proclaims five different kinds of malted barley, and these notes are on the forefront on this beer. Yeast spiciness provides a complimentary note as well, but the overall nose is fairly thin. It's not as rich as I would hope for from the style.  Taste: Much like the nose, the first sip yields malted barley and grains, some toastiness, and a little bit of the spiciness. There is a very subtle bitterness as well, but for the most part, the grain bill plays the majority of the parts on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: The malts help create a fairly sticky mouthfeel, but as is common with many SA brews, the overall mouthfeel is light and crisp. Lager, ales, and Oktoberfest beers, all seem to have the same mouthfeel.  Drinkability: The mouthfeel lends to the drinkability as do the flavors. This is not a complex beer by any means, but it does the style well, and it's quite sessionable. Sessionable enough that it will be one of the kegs for our fall wedding.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A hint of fruit, mainly apple.  m - Light to medium body and moderate carbonation.  d - An average octoberfest/fall beer. Mostly caramel and bready malts in the smell and taste.

35,102,matt062286,3.98,"Appearance - Pours an copperish red color. Small head that dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing.  Smell - Scent of malt overpowers a hint of hops. Small hint of a caramel-like malt in here. There is a sweetness combined with a roasted smell.  Taste - Just as in the smell, malt dominates this beer. They are prevalent and have subtle nuances. The sweeter tasting malts are a bit stronger here than the more toasted flavored ones. Hop flavor is barely noticeable, but their weakness only multiplies the dominance and complexity of the many malts used. (According to the Sam Adams webpage, this beer uses six(!) different malts, so that explains that)  Mouthfeel - this beer is a bit on the watery side. Carbonation is low.  Drinkability - I've had many sessions with this beer, and drinkability is a shining point of Octoberfest. It is ""watery"" and lightly carbonation so that it goes down well, and is flavorful enough to want to keep drinking it. And hey, that's the whole reason for the marzen style, is it not?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,hopheadjuice,3.18,"12 oz bottle best by Feb with no year.  Pours a typical amber in color, filtered with some bubbles rising. 1 finger head that recedes fast leaving a little bit of lacing.  Smells very grainy with a hint od musty fruit. extremely low hop presence with a malty scent as well. something tastes off in this brew, tastes like boston lager with more malts.  Again something is off, the taste has a weird apple juiceness to it. very malty with slight hop bitterness and a malty finish.  Mouthfeel is soft to medium bodied with a soft finish.  I didnt especially like this marzen/octoberfest bier, I much prefer Bostons Harpoon octoberfest to this one anyday.  Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Star80,4,"Beer pours a deep copper color, definitely a few shades darker than regular Boston Lager. Smells like a good marzen should, malty with hints off toffee, very very faint alcohol in the nose. Taste is a nice interplay between the caramel sweetness of the malts, but with slight bitterness, from the darker roasted malts (five in all) along with a clean dash of hops on the tongue. This is really a harmony of different flavors, which honestly, can be a bit much at times, at least, the style in general can be. That is not saying that this is not a great beer, which if it weren't so darn rich and full, could be drunk in large amounts in true Oktoberfest style. I've had a good handful of the German ones and this one holds it own!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Shadman,3.5,"Surprised to find this @ a Coop gas bar/liquor store in Dunmore, Ab of all places.  Aprocot/amber colour, decent head and lacing.  Sweet bready/toasted malts. Not a surprise given 5 malt varieties are used.  What do you you? Malts dominate the taste profile. Toasted and sweet with that mineral water hardness that is so notable in their Boston Lager. Hops are there only in the background and lend a slightly dry finish to all the malt sweetmess.  Feel starts quite full and then migrates quickly to rather thin.  Not sure the Germans have much to worry about here. Nice, but the malty sweetness and rather bland overall taste get tired quickley",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Aroma is sweet malt and a smallish metallic tinge. Honey coated biscuits and yeasty sweet bread on the nose.  Flavor is sweet malt. Malt is slight dark fruit and a touch of molasses. Clover honey and crisp crackery bread. Hops are barely there, enough to cut the sweetness slightly with a honey dew melon flavor. Finishes sweet and with a touch of stick.  Mouthfeel is less than substantial and crisp. Leaves a small amount of stick on the lips. Carbonation is lively.  Drinkability is high as the body is light and flavor is decent.

Fairly one dimensional malt profile, ends on a sweet bready note, mild tangy hop trail.  Medium body, medium carbonation.  High drinkability  I would say an ok beer overall, but not a great Oktoberfest. Very forgettable...drinks like an average amber lager.

35,102,LacquerHead,3.31,"Had two 12oz bottles at Rudy's BBQ in TX It pours a crystal clear brownish orange color with a white bubbly head. There was not much to the aroma. The malts were very faint.  Like the aroma the taste was not too exciting. There was a subtle spice flavor that lingered about, but for the most part it didn't do much. The malt flavor was not very pronounced - it was rather thin. Other BA members were very descriptive and listed off a host of flavors. Maybe it's just me but I wasn't tasting too much in this one. For the most part I found myself searching for flavors and aromas, and I didn't find much.  If I had to describe this beer in one word it would be, uneventful. I haven't had one of these in a long time and I remember it being very good. However, this revisiting didn't live up to my memory. I might order this at a bar or restaurant with a limited selection, otherwise I have no need for it. Not the best example of an Oktoberfest beer...seriously I remember this being much better.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Brewingbanjos,3.28,A nice orange color and very clear. The taste is rich and bettery with malt. The mouthfeel fades quick despite the maltiness.

35,102,feelmefoam,3.2,"Pours a slightly orange ruby color with moderate carbonation running up into a finger of off-white head that doesn't last long and doesn't leave a lot of lacing around the glass.  Slightly malty nose, a little cinnamon (maybe), and some slight hoppiness.... not very fragrant either. Decent smell, but I have to search for it, which I don't like doing. I'm lazy.  Alright flavor, but it's sort of unimpressive. Some slightly toasty malts and a HINT of spiciness... really only a hint, not much else. Some mild hop flavor, too. Decent body... it's a carbonation supported medium body which makes it clean and crisp like crunchy fall leaves. I like the mouthfeel, just not too much else.  This is still a pretty decent beer, just not what I've come to expect from Sam Adams. It's kinda plain, which is not typical of the Boston Beer fellas. I could use some more flavor, some more spiciness, some more pumpkin... some more FALL! Anyways, it's still drinkable, but I need more from Sam Adams on this one.

35,102,Kadonny,3.53,"Poured from a tap into a standard pint glass.  A: A deep copper color with hints of brown. A one finger fluffy slightly off white head provides lacing.  S: Biscuit, caramel, bready, a bit earthy and grassy with slight dark fruits.  T: Lots of caramel and bready biscuit flavors with some toffee, brown sugar and earthy tones. Some slight fig or prune or other dark fruits that just lay in with the earthy grassy notes. Finish remains a bit sweet with ever so slight hops poking through. I actually remember more hops on this the last time I had it. Finish is creamy smooth and mellow.  M: Medium at best, maybe even a bit thin. No alcohol and no real bitterness to speak of.  D: Pretty good, but there are other O-fests I would rather drink.  Overall a solid offering that falls short of any excellence. Still in beer mediocrity of many local bars, this is a welcome sight.

35,102,Reaper16,3.68,"served on-tap @ The Downtown Pub, Tuscaloosa, AL, into a pint glass  Pours an expected bronze/copper color, though a touch darker than many other beers of the style. An airy froth of eggshell head, one finger plus, whisps around.  Initial impression of the aroma was that this isn't much different than Boston Lager. The malts that Boston Beer Company uses for their lagers all seem to smell similar. Grainy, nutty, maybe too sweet. Some candy apple fragrance. German hops. Par for the style.  Thankfully, this beer tastes a whole lot less generic. A clean, well-blended malt profile lifts this beer. Warm, browned malts meet richer, nutty flavors. Steely hops undercut the potential buildup of sweetness. Not too much apple ester sort of flavor but enough to keep things interesting.  I didn't once consciously think about the mouthfeel during my two pints of this. It wasn't offensive or distracting. Those kinds of mouthfeels are generally good. Drinkability is darn good. A low ABV% of 5.3 and a clean, easygoing flavor makes for a nice Autumn session candidate.  For me, this is the second best beer that Sam Adams puts out. Easy-drinking & all-purpose.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,rtepiak,3.4,A hard style to get right and this is on the way. Look is proper with a caramel color and an off white head. Palate is the typical stale apple marzen malt and straw. A bitter of husk and a body that carries you through. But this is done correctly at best. Nothing exceptional about it.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,thebrood1987,4.2,Had this on tap a couple of weeks ago just as it was coming out for the season. It was a very nice penny color with a nice malty Samuel Adams type smell to it. (if you had their other beers you know what I'm talking about) Also with that trademark spicy Noble hop smell but dialed back a bit more when compared to their Boston Lager. The taste is better than the smell actually with a really rich malt taste and an amazing body feel for the lower alcohol content it has. The hops are subtle just to add to the malt. Very nice sweet malts as well. On tap it had more of a crisp hop bite to it then it does in the bottle. With that aside it still has a nice Noble hop character to it that balances out the sweet flavor of the beer. Probably my favorite fall beer I've had.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Looks: perfectly clear deep almond-ornage in color, with a khaki head that looks stickier than it is, since it dissipates to a heavy layer of foam within a minute, leaving minimal spots of lace.  Smells: like an apple tree, tinged with the colors of autumn. Lots of lager yeast and sourdough bread, with the light nuttiness of almonds and walnuts along with a hint of sweet red apple cider.  Tastes: far nuttier, with some peanuts added in with those almonds and walnut. Also get some lightly toasted wheat bread and dried apples before a snappy finish. All these flavors, however, are just a little light.  Feels: watery. A medium carbonation fizzes up the beer as it moves about the mouth. Light-bodied.  Drinks: easily and quickly.

You can taste the toastiness. A touch piney, and very pleasant hops (they really shine through here).  Mouthfeel: Just very mellow all the way around. The carbonation doesn't make much of an appearance, but it tastes good enough that that isn't an isn't.

Now that I've had my far share of better beer, this is simply just mediocre.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,aerozeppl,3.55,A: Burnt amber in color. Poured with a quarter finger of white head. Poor head retention. Quite a bit of visible carbonation.  S: The aroma is sweet up front. Not much hops at all. Nice malt backbone. Fairly clean nose. Touch of freshly milled grain.  T: Starts off a little sweet. The lager yeast comes through for a second then it is all about the malt. Little bit spicy. The sweetness really carries throughout. Finished dry.  M: Quite smooth. I look for a little bit more creaminess from the style though. When it was poured it was a little overcarbonated but it calmed down in the glass quickly.  D: Enjoyable. Not the best example of the style I have had but a fresh marzen is always welcome.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: Solid toasted bread and biscuit malt base with some caramel and light spicy ester aroma. A hint of floral hops and yeast. Not overly impressive, but decent enough.  T: Toasted malt dominates the flavor and gives off a slight nutty toffee flavor. Somewhat sweet with plenty of bread and again, some spice esters.  M: The body is actually quite nice, we'll say medium, with a smooth mid-level carbonation.

Sweet malt that has a distinct toasted profile.  Taste: Toasted fresh bread with a nice subtle hop undertone (mostly earthy hop notes). Finishes pretty sweet, like fresh rolls you just pulled from the oven.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and fairly clean with a light to medium body.  Drinkability: A very nice and appropriate seasonal from BBC. It definitely has a distinct Sam Adams-y note to it (probably due to similar ingredients in their other malt forward brews).

It has a medium body with mild carbonation. Overall a great beer that I really enjoyed. Much more accessible than other marzens, such as Paulaner, Hofbrau or Ayinger, but still a great brew.

It's got a nice amber color, makes me imagine it's fall (even though it's still 90 degrees out here in NC).  The taste is a perfect ""Octoberfest"" type of beer. It's not something I would want all of the time, but it gives me that nice beginning of fall type feeling.  Bottom line, I'll but it in autumn, but that's it.

The nose comprises caramel, citrus peel, red apple skin, and some light toffee. The taste holds notes of light caramel apple (holy hell, it merged!), walnuts, orange rind, and some miscellaneous florals. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, semi-crisp feel.

A little bit of sulfur from Aroma.  Mouthfeel: On high end of thin side. Lots of carbonation. Alcohol not noticeable.  Overall: Missing a lot of the complexity I look for in Oktoberfests.

My first glass of the season (even though it's slightly before the season) on 8/10/11 pours into my Samuel Adams ""Perfect Pint"" a clear and bright rusty orange amber under a sparse head. Swirling the brew around I pick up on aromas of bright crisp fall spiced malt and herbal hops. That's an Oktoberfest aroma all right...This seems to flow along the palate somewhat smoother than last year's edition and I do believe that there's a really complex and robust brightly spiced malt body present here. Tastes of bright bready malt with notes of caramel, nutmeg? and perhaps toasted chestnut deliver a very savory finish. Fall is right around the corner... --- 2010:  3.5 A: Into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass, this poured a clear orange amber color under a quickly disappearing head.  3.5 S: A moderate nose of roasted caramel malt and crisp hops that shined through.  3.5 M/ 4.0 T: A crisp, lightly hopped, and mildly sweet malt feel upfront that flowed into a delicate but firm, chewy malt center before finishing with a malt dominated but tame bready aftertaste.  3.0 D: Malt echoed in the mouth after a couple of these and bordered slightly on overstaying its welcome but was an overall pleasant session.

35,102,klaybie,4.4,"Wow! I am surprised I like this beer now. I first tried it a year ago and was unimpressed. However, I have tried many beers in that year and can now say SA Octoberfest will be in my fridge all season. I've had this beer many times this year so I think this is accurate for me:  Poured into my Friar Tuck pint glass  A.Pours a copper-red color with a 1/2"" off-white head. Very fine lacing. Head retention is about 30 seconds.  N. Smells malty with some hop aroma although I can't place the hops (my nose is not that talented yet). Smells like other Oktoberfest beers.  T. Initial taste is malty and bready and some hop bitterness is present at the finish which refreshes the palate for the next drink.  M. Moderate carbonation and medium body make this beer enoyable.  D. Overall a solid beer in my opinion. Certainly an Oktoberfest that has earned a place in my fridge. The SA website lists the ABV at 5.3% which helps make the beer very drinkable and sessionable. That being said I'm off for another!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bagpiper2005,3.5,"Pour: Clear medium copper color. One finger of ivory colored head that sticks around for a short while and leaves traces of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Caramel, brown sugar bready, a little bit spicy. A light floral hop scent.  Taste: Caramel front end with a hint of pumpkin and brown sugar. Yeasty middle with a light-to-moderate hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium and low carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer is alright, and I can drink it. Nothing special though.  Final Notes: It seems like it's been a bit stronger in years past. It's lost some of its magic for me, that said, it was one of my first beers so for me it's a beer that's close to my heart. I'd drink it if offered.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,brewerburgundy,3.83,"12oz bottle, pilsner glass, enjoy before January 2011 it looks like.  Deep brown tinted orange. Very clear with an only slightly off-white head fully covering the top and leaving traces on the glass.  Brown sugar on a clean lager cracker base. Rich.  Layered saltine caramel, and rich malt. The finish turns on the noble hops. Nutty.  Dry, bubbly, but not lacking heft.  This beer has some memories connected with it that make it appealing to pick some up every fall. I think it stands just about toe to toe with some German versions I've had.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,aristeros,4,"Poured into my Sam Smith pint glass. A burnished copper, one finger of head. Good clarity, moderate carbonation visible. Smells of caramel and biscuit.  Heavy toasted malt flavors up front: toffee, biscuit, yielding to toast. A nip of hops keeps things interesting. The finish is slightly dry and bitter despite a minimal hop presence. Overall, pleasant and malty, and reminds me more of a Fuller's ESB than a festmarzen.  Moderate body, with the right amount of carbonation for the style. Definitely sessionable because of a good balance to the beer, though it leans heavily towards malts.  I'm quite fond of this seasonal, though I'm not sure it's an oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ebby82,3.53,"Pours a light amber color into a pint glass with a one finger head. Smells of mostly malt, but none of the smells are really prevalent. The taste is sweet, malty, with perhaps a hint of caramel. Overall, I think this tastes like a slightly sweeter, more malt like version of SA lager. The mouthfeel is just barely thicker than the traditional lager, but the taste is not substantially different. I don't know much about Oktoberfests, so I can't really compare this to others. It's a highly drinkable affair, but not much different than their traditional lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

No particular complexities for this guy, just a beer that is a notch above fizzy yellow stuff. Lots of caramel, its the beer's #1 property. I guess this is the archtype or something. Nothing wrong with it.  EDIT: Sep 2011, had it again, really a nice octoberfest, I've freed myself that it must be hoppy confines.

Taste is a big sourdough mess with a tinge of metallic flavors. mildly sweet upfront though, increasing in bitters with a sharp cheeder flavor and grassy hops.

35,102,MbpBugeye,4.1,"Ah, the beer that started it all. This was the very first seasonal I got into. I was, and still am, attracted to the history of European, and specifically German, culture and brewing traditions. This one was always there. Easy to find, easy to drink and a good representation of the style it set out to honor. I credit this beer with starting my love for all other beers. This review is long over due.  Pulled out of a Sam Adams fall sampler case and poured into my New Glarus pilsner. A- An updated label has this beer looking better than ever. A nice autumnal orange colored beer with superb clarity. A big white head forms and leaves lovely lacing.  S- A nondescript aroma wafts through out the immediate vicinity of this beer. Getting a little closer I am surprised that the smell isnt stronger, given that I can pick up hits floating around the room. I can still pick out lots of smooth maltiness and spicy hop additions. A nice caramel base is under a fresh citrus and spicy hop bouquet.  T- Very extremely balanced. Big on malts. Peaty, caramelly, and nutty. Delicate notes of lemon-lime, tangerine, and floral hops ride over top.  D- It barely gets drinkable than this. Back when I discovered this beer I would have no problems putting away a 6 pack while everyone else sucked down their Natty at a homecoming party or something. Im glad this beer is back.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Big malt flavors match the aromas and a bit bready too. I think the hop level is almost perfect and balances the big malt profile nicely. Finish is malts all the way, and they hang around for a good long time.  D - This is one of the beers that got me interested in craft, and I remember looking forward to it every year.

35,102,Vdubb86,3.56,"Served in a Samuel Adams pint glass  This is something that I've had in the past but I feel it's a good one for my first review.  The appearance is a nice amber color with a small amount of off-white foam. The beer itself has no strong smells to speak of but there are hints of orange and pumpkin spices. There are light hop notes as well. The pumpkin spices remind of autumn and therefore excite me greatly for it is Oktoberfest season. At first taste there are plenty of smooth malts that overpower any hop flavor. What hops that do come though arise only in the aftertaste which is the only slight bitterness to be found on the back of the tongue in addition there is a bit of sourness that lingers. The overall caramel malts are definitely the over-abiding taste. The mouthfeel is the appropriate viscosity for the style. The drinkability is quite nice. Sitting down and having a couple during a football game is the perfect way to welcome back the fall.  Overall this is a definite recommendation. This is a smooth easy going beer. This beer is a fair representation of the style, and a relatively inexpensive way to enjoy the season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Pours a really nice orange, golden yellow color with a just off white head and a nice amount of lacing. Really great look to this beer. The aroma is slightly pumpkin and yams with some caramelized malts and a nice corn muffin and sweet potato aroma. Also has a really nice bitterness underneath the high malt profile. The flavor is very good on this. I like it better than last years. Not a complex beer by any means but focused and has that great marzen caramel malt flavor with a touch of hops. Fresh and tasty. The mouthfeel is right on with my favorite German oktoberfests. Has a great acidity on the finish that levels out the big malt profile. Drinkability is great on this.

There is some carmel scents as well. The taste is a disappointment. There really isn't much to it except a carmel malt flavor with some orange citrus acid flavor. All is really faint.

Smell is what I'v been waiting for all summer..lots of yeast, bread, toffee. YUM smells like fall is just around the corner.  Taste is similar to the smells with a good amount of carbonation and the alcohol is right up front. Finish is clean and crisp.

Smelled orangey and malty, with some sweet caramel. almost like someone put a splash of orange juice in the beer, but without that citrus bite.  Tastes very nice, a nice octoberfest addition, although not world class. Still, the caramel malts, touch of spices, and sweet flavors are very nice within the style and indeed for any style.  Feels fairly thick and creamy, could be a bit better in this area but no real complaints.  Drinkability is quite high, especially since where I found it (down south) the 12-packs of this were about $4 cheaper than buying individual six packs of the same brand!

Appearance - Poured with some head that dissolved quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The beer looks exactly as an Octoberfest beer should - a rich dark amber color.  Smell - Rich strong smell of malt, molasses and caramel. I don't detect hops.  Taste - Tasting this reminds me of the brewing process. The taste is a nice grainy / barley / cereal taste that makes me think of tasting the used grains after the mash. There is a present malt taste. There is an aftertaste of the beer that makes me think of Sam Adams Boston lager, although not nearly as strong.  Mouthfeel - The beer is smooth, and thick. There is a light carbonation, but it is not under carbonated.  Drinkability - Easy to drink for a fairly strong beer. The low carbonation makes it go down easily.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Is a excellent beer to drink on a hot day. Drinkability is awesome and it is easy to drink 4-5 of these at a sitting.  Would highly recommend this beer to anyone.

Caramel malts abound, though not sticky sweet...somewhat metallic as well. A small amount of hops are present, though pretty minor. Some grain is also apparent at the end. A little bit of stickiness stays around on the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel somewhat thinner than I expected, to be honest. Not as sweet as I'd hoped, though still tasty and good enough for quaffing.

35,102,revdrkevind,3.52,"s- I've had this both on tap and from the bottle, and this beer doesn't much care how it's served.  a- Fairly remarkable. Great coppery orange-brown suits the occasion, and a rather soapy head dissipates quickly to leave no lacing. The weak head suits the style, to my eyes.  s- Unremarkable. Mostly caramel, but nothing to write home about.  t- Very bitter and caramel and spicy-earthy, with tons of roasted malt. It's an okay flavor on its own, but it really pairs quite extraordinarily well with bratwurst and burgers and other festival treats. By itself, I'd say the beer is unbalanced and leans hard on the spice and roasted malt. With food though, it's like having a light beer and your food and a great seasonal sauce slathered on all at once. You can drink Octoberfest by itself, and it's a good beer considering it's usually on special when it's in, but do try it with some nicely grilled treats if you can.  Warming the beer actually gives it some surprising depth as the flavors mellow and mix a bit, and having this beer warm will probably give you instant ideas for the next time you grill brats. Personally, I enjoy this beer so much when it's in that warming isn't usually an issue, but I always kick myself for not remembering it's good at any temperature.  m- The actual feel is a bit watery in my opinion, but you'll likely miss that from the lingering burnt malt and spice flavors. This beer has a high character without affecting drinkability.  d- I've had a few rip-roaring nights on this stuff at festivals (and even served it as well as consumed it), so I can attest that it's a great companion beer to last through the night. However, it's really only good seasonally, as it's just not balanced enough to stand on its own without the novelty factor. Love it when it's in, and look forward to next season. And hey, it's great even as it goes warm, so feel free to enjoy the festival as this beer will stay there for you.  verdict- Food pairings turn this mostly average beer into a great seasonal treat.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Flashsp2,4,"Sam Adams Octoberfest  Pours a deep orange/amber with a small tan head which dissipates quickly leaving a broken top cover and minimal lacing.  Nose is clean, with a rich caramel malt and earthy hop aroma.  The flavor is expectedly malt forward, with a sweet caramel and melon flavor preceding an earthy note from the Noble hops.  The mouthfeel is course and gassy at cold temperature, but becomes softer and heavier as it warms.  This is a great interpretation of a very classic style, and is quite easy to drink at a cool temperature. When its cold it doesn't seem to mesh well. At proper temps its quite a tasty treat.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,smithza9,3.85,"Another great addition to the world of beer by the Boston Beer Company. Octoberfest is a great, dark, mix of spices that is good on any cool fall day.

35,102,Sweetmambyjamby,3.85,"This is a beer that I really like. I know there are probably better octoberfest beers out there, and I will be trying them. But for the price of this beer and the fact that it was readily available i think this beer is one that i will get again every fall. It's a very drinkable beer.

T - Lots of slightly toasted malts. Fairly sweet with very subdued spice. Mild tea/herbal hops.  M - Medium bodied and slightly creamy and smooth.  D - Easy to drink, the sweetness and spice are not overwhelming which helps drinkability.

35,102,vishneda,3.8,"They roll this one out around Märzen time with stiff competition all around, but it holds its own. It has a classic dark orange color with an off-white head and brings a pretty hoppy floral aroma. The flavor seems ""bright""; tart and sweet but not quite hearty enough. Overall it's refreshing and not real filling... a good combination for the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,NOOGIE,4.18,"Look: Poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Great color! Reddish-brown sort of like the like colors of fall in the color department. Nice thin layer of foam, just enough for this beer.  Smell: Has a nice woody smell. Also strong malty and hoppy smell, with hints of candy, like toffees.  Taste: Strong malty flavor, the woody smell is incorporated into the taste, hops and a sweet taste also.  Mouthfeel: The woody malty flavor stays in your mouth after you have finished. Great mouthfeel!  Drinkability: Surprisingly really smooth, the sweet flavor balances the hops, good Oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,callmescraps,3.58,"Trying a nice Sam Adams after several total recent failures. I'm not looking for a home run, just something nice.  Appearance- A nice rich amber color. A good inch of creamy off-white head that settles into a nice cap. A good looking beer.  Smell- A nice hint of spice. Some toasted malts. It's a little mellow. A little nutty.  Taste- Nice and light. A little creamy, with a hint of spice. Lots of toasted malts, some real sweetness. Very bready with some mild hops. A little tea-like. Pleasant, but a little sweet.  Mouthfeel- Nice and rich. It's creamy without being heavy.  Drinkability- Goes down pretty easy, but the sweetness, and the hint of spice, makes it so I could tire easily on this.  A nice beer, definitely. Exactly what I'd expect from Sam Adams. They don't usually knock my socks off, but they rarely disappoint.

35,102,LordAdmNelson,3.53,"Not a bad beer here from SA. Pours a pretty bourbon color with smallish off-white head. Smell is largely of caramel and bready malt, and the taste follows suit. This one's a malt bomb, with very little hop character to balance it out. Caramel, bread, and some syrupy sweetness characterize this one. MF is medium, adequate, although not mind-blowing.

A slight floral/herbal hop scent rides below. Almost smells like a bock/doppel. A bit heavy in the caramel scent. Too thick without any lager crispness.  Taste: Greeted by a rush of carbonation which leads to a light, crisp malt profile. Taste like typical german caramel malt; that almost sour flavor. Ends with a perfect husky dryness that is almost equally matched by an earthy hop bitterness. The huskiness truly reminds one of fall and dry, autumn leaves  Medium body that ends superbly crisp. Solid carbonation. Slight film from the husky malt.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It pours a nice amber hue with a good amount of khaki colored head retention. The smell is outstanding, very malty and reminiscent of autumn.  I love the flavor of this octoberfest, its very flavorful without being too sweet or syrupy.  The mouthfeel and carbonation are also excellent, as is common in most sam adams ales.  This is definitely one of my favorite Octoberfest beers right here.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Serving type: bottle",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Carlton1964,3.85,Great lace and color. Had a very nice aroma. Nice body...not to thick and to thin. Although this beer does nothing wrong....it does not excel at anything either.

35,102,beerwolf77,3.63,"Poured into my pint glass the beer is bright clear orange brown. With some red highlights around the edges. The off white head fills almost half my glass even after a gentle pour. A brief wait results in little to no lace and now I can commence pouring the rest of the beer.  The aroma is about as basic as it gets. Malt, spices some sweetness and a touch of hops. The style leans towards unoffensive so it's right on point.  The flavor is a muted mix of caramle malt, spices and hints of hops. Wheaty finish rounds things off. Again the style tends to be muted so no points off for that.  Medium to light body. Above average carbonation. Seems a touch thin in the mouth.  Overall throw it on the pile of average oktoberfests. Easy drinking if nothing else.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Spineypanda,3.87,"Probably one of my more favorites from Sam Adams.  Has a golden amber color with a thin somewhat lacy head. Smells of malts and a hint of spice. Has the taste of a big malty deliciousness :). A bit of the spice taste to it but not a whole lot, which is a plus. This is a bit of a thin beer on the mouth and hardly what I would want in my mouthfeel but still not bad.  Hope next years is as good as this one!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,infi,3.52,"On-tap at the Asian Pub in St. Marks, NYC.  Appearance is a translucent caramel brown color with some bubbling action throughout. Very thin white cap sits atop with no lacing throughout its duration. Smell is full of toasted malt and spice with just a hint of hop aroma towards end.  Taste reflects exactly what the nose detects - huge and sweet malt backbone with a dash of spiciness like cinnamon. Some hop bitterness in the back end. There was too much of a diacetyl character in this serving; something I've never encountered whenever I bought this SA seasonal in packs. A real palpable buttery taste, which was a little unappetizing for me.  Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean with good carbonation throughout. Drinkability could be a bit higher if not for the buttery tones in taste. Still a decently good seasonal for the BBC.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell: lots of grain and malt; quite carameley and nutty, not unlike a brown ale. It's nice.  Taste: quite malty; there is a nice bitterness but otherwise little hop presence. Like the aroma, it's got a fair bit of nuttiness and caramel. It's not bad, but to me it's more like a brown ale in flavor than a lager.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a little bit of a syrupy consistency; an appropriate level of carbonation.  Drinkability: pretty good. This is not a bad beer by any means, but it doesn't entice me as much as some other Sam Adams varieties.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Beautiful and abundant creamy malts brimming with hints of marshmallow and nougat and a touch of hop character to keep it honest. Deep amber in color and always rewarding you with the perfect mocha colored head along with generous lacing. Though most stores are sold out by this time of the year, (mid-November) there is a small ""ethnic"" store a few towns away that has an ample cache of this stuff. Needless to say, each time I ""SCHHWINGGG"" through, I pick up a sixer'.. I think they should have enough to last for me till the ""drink before"" date in March... And No....

A: Poured with a small head that dissipated quickly to a thin film. No real lacing to speak of. Body is an amber/brown color, and almost completely clear.  S: Nice aroma of sweetness and malt... smells like there may be some caramel in there.  T: Mostly sweet, as it pretty much starts out and extends this way... again, some caramel tones in there. Finishes with a very slight bitter taste. Basic, but overall pretty enjoyable.  M: Medium-bodied with an oily texture, and soft carbonation.  D: I've enjoyed this beer every time I've had it... it doesn't knock you for a loop with originality, but it's easy to drink and definitely a very solid beer.

35,102,jkrich,3.61,"Clear, copper color with an off-white creamy head.  This one had minimal aroma: some faint malt aromas. I find that this style is not the most aromatic.  A rich, malty flavor that is somewhat balanced by some lingering hop bitterness. The emphasis here is on the malt - perhaps too much so.  Solid medium bodied and a little too much carbonation.  I did enjoy a pint of this with my meal, but given the malty flavor, I would not have more than a couple. Still, a solid offering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mklinger,3.7,"Poured from a bottle into a pilsener glass. Color is quite a deep amber -- very dark for an octoberfest -- a bit out of style. Half an inch of eggshell colored head that dissipated quite quickly. Left a bit of lacing behind with each sip. Nice but a bit atypical for an octoberfest.  Smell is all crystal sweetness. Malty, which is very nice, and kind of caramelly sweet, which doesn't seem quite right for the style.  Taste is a lot like the aroma but with a bit of hop bitterness that wasn't present in the aroma. I like the flavor a lot, but it doesn't quite seem like an octoberfest. In lots of ways it's more like an East Coast Amber Ale but made with a lager yeast. Very well brewed, clean flavors but not an octoberfest.  Mouthfeel hits the Octoberfest style very well. Rich, full mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Really nice.  Drinkability I'm also giving a bit of a boost to.

35,102,Whiteweasel,3.8,"Poured from a bottle into a seidel.  Appearance: Hazy reddish-brown colour. Gives a small amount of thin reasonably white head. Almost orange depending on angle viewed at.  Smell: Very fragrant; I could smell it from the moment i started pouring. Very sweet and floral. Defintely smells like an oktoberfest  Taste: Very buttery. Hops flavor is quite understated, especially for this style. More malty than any other oktoberfest Ive had. Strong notes of butterscotch. Interesting but not very deep.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth. Creamy almost. Low amount of carbonation, but that suits it well. No sign of alcohol.  Drinkability: Very good. I could drink many of these in a night. Its not nearly hoppy enough where it destroys your palate, but rather its just a pleasant beer to drink. Good but not great",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TLove,2.58,"(From Notes)  On tap at a bar in SW DC.  Really pretty in line with the style, but unfortunately not really remarkable in any way. This beer exudes mediocre craftsmanship and grassy, corn-laden structure. A decent try for the Vienna oktoberfest style with a stronger color, but the body gets a bit foamy and squeamish in the mouth. Irreverent lacing and not particularly noticeable in character in the smell, the beer does have a nice herbal, piney malt smell with some mint and rye grains in the mouth. Typical of the style. Slightly sweet, very calcic, and somewhat off in the finish. But overall, not shoddy. But nothing really notable either.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,barleywinefiend,3.2,"Poured a deep orange color with a slightly foamy white head and decent carbonation. Nose is pretty flat but I did detect some spice and caramel.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth with a little bit of a malty aftertaste.  Drinkability is good. It goes down quite easy and is a tasty brew.

Taste - Again, malt forward, with sweetness coming into play, but not overly sweet in my opinion. Toasty bready flavor. Enough hops to just balance out the sweetness.  Drinkability - I could definitely [and have] throw back several of these in a sitting without a problem.  Overall, I remember now why this is the beer that got me into the craft scene. This is a really good beer, nice malty profile, which I am drawn too in general.

It also has nice malty flavor towards the end. There's also some caramel flavor in here.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is perfect for this style. It gets a little tacky/sticky after a few sips. Not bad though.  Drinkability: This beer has pretty good drinkability. Nothing too harsh, but the sweetness kind of limits it for my taste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Darkish copper, it has a big pale tan head steadily shrinking to a thin, wispy top and a rich, foamy ring. It leaves a hint of weak lace.  The aroma is a pretty nice, strong vienna, toasty with leafy grain, hints of leafy herbs, and sweet caramelised sugar/grain.  The taste is mineral, toasty grain, leafy-herbal hops.

35,102,allforbetterbeer,3.64,"A- Deep intense amber, looks ruby in some lights. Bountiful head that does dissipate slowly, but laces like a dream. This is an excellent looking beer.  S- Picking up some grains and malts, nothing offensive or distinct. Smells almost like an adjunct lager.  T- For a second of two, this tastes like a mediocre beer. Some subtle noble hops playing on a malt backbone, the slightest citrus and fruit around the edges. When all hope for this beer seems to be fading, the ruddy, earthy malts rush in and save the day. It is the malty aftertaste that forms the essence of the taste.  M- Medium bodied. Not sticky or to sweet, or dry.  D- A nicely drinkable Oktoberfest, one is satisfying, three is just as good.  Overall: A good example of this style, and a fine beer by itself. Not the very best oktoberfest out there, but a solid one in every regard.  Notes: This was the first craft beer I ever remember drinking, and I fell in love with it then (my dad gave it to me to my surprise; usually I was only able to taste his).

35,102,Risser09,4.03,"12oz bottle poured into a pilsner - fridge - March 2009  Appearance: Pours a transparent orange color with brown hues. The 2"" tall ivory head is cakey and shows good retention, with round tentacles of lace.  Smell: Malty aroma is rich with sugar, caramel, lager yeast and brown sugar. A citrus hop finish completes the aroma. Nice.  Taste: Malt flavor is oozing with caramel and smooth lager yeast. A German, subtle, hop bitterness balances the beer to where you want to keep on drinking.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, bitter, balanced Oktoberfest that S.A. has nailed to the wall. Medium body, foamy carbonation and a bitter, dry finish.  Drinkability: Quite a tasty Oktoberfest beer that would pair with lots of foods, from savory dishes to spicy ones. I will drink this again and again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,farrago,3.07,"Weak head which barely gets to half a finger before dissipating to weak swirls across the surface, thin streaks of lacing. Nice glow to the red amber color, thins into a zinc orange around the rims. The nose is gently spiced with clove, nutmeg and allspice, followed on by cereal, mixed white citrus and oregano and bay leaf herbs, neither that malty nor that fruity. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation arguably a bit much for the primary material and does not allow the flavors time to soak in. More of that raw spice mixed in with herbs and a light metallic accent. Hard to shake that dilute feeling, no fruit or citrus to fill in the blanks and the malts not very sweet, some dark chocolate dust. The graininess milled down and powdery. Some lift at the end, but without much direction.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,akorsak,3.68,"A 12 oz bottle.  A: The o-fest is a coppery amber color, clear enough that I can see the decorative candle that sits on the other side of the glass. A decent head, nearly two fingers in size, overflowed briefly, requiring a quick clean-up. Light lacing followed.  S: The aroma is very malty, bready with a pleasant sweet streak that lightens things up. Hops add a balancing aspect only, little in the way of strong noble hops.  T: The beer has a light body, grainy but not too full. The standout is a dose of caramel, almost syrupy, that follows the initial malt wave. The sweetness that it brings livens up the taste. The hops are a little stronger here too, adding an earthy bitterness. The finish is fast, offering some graininess before fading away.  M: The lager is malty, no doubt about it. The flavor is solid though and the caramel really helps it work.  D: This is like comfort beer. I just feel good drinking it and it reminds me of a simpler time when I hadn't yet gotten into ales.

35,102,DoubleJ,3.44,"From Flying Dog to Gordon to Karl to Sam, we enter the last beer of the American Oktoberfest Invitational, the tasting which I sample some of the marzen's of the bigger American craft breweries. Before I go on, I will say that this is the first SA Oktoberfest I've had in three years, which is the longest stretch I've gone without tasting a beer that I already sampled. To some, that may not sound long, but I've only been able to legally drink for only a slightly longer time. That will end very soon. Is SA Oktoberfest as good as I remember? On to the beer:  Poured into a stange, the beer's color is darker than other maarzen's with its rich amber red color. The head on top is semi-creamy/semi-fuzzy. It slowly drops. Light in the nose. There is some ""raw"" hop leaf crawling in the nose with weak notes of malty goodness. Where are my malts? Will I taste them?  Oh yes, I taste them, though on the lighter side. Bread crust and sweet King's Hawaiian rolls lead the way in this smooth, medium bodied beer. It's slightly fruity, and very faint alcohol hints itself on the palate. Dry biscuit malt finishes off the journey.  In the land of marzen's, SA Oktoberfest will hold its own given its distribution, freshness, and price advantage. Not as heavenly as I remember three years ago, but still very servicable and easy drinking. (In case you were wondering, Boréale Blonde is now the beer I haven't sampled in the longest time, dating back to December 2006.)  The American Oktoberfest Invitaitonal comes to end with these four beers, and now is the time to crown a winner. And the winner is....  Gordon Biersch Festbier!  No leftover marzen's at this Oktoberfest, and in the end, the guy who tells you not to trust a skinny brewer takes it all. Hope you're all full of pretzels and potato salad (and beer!) after this invite. Good night everyone!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Bookseeb,3.88,"Appearance has a dark amber color with a nice fluffy head. Smell has a sweet malt breadiness to it.

35,102,sfsean28,4.28,I bought the 22oz bottle almost everyday for the past two weeks. Its been a few years since I had a SA Octoberfest and I was very pleased with it. The color looked great the pour left a nice foamy head. My first taste and I can notice the malt right away. A hint of sweetness. After each sip I wanted more. Next stop I have to try it on tap.  I was very impressed with beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TheFlern,2.97,Appearance: A nice burnt orange/amber color. Almost no head in the pour and zero lacing.  Smell: Lots of malt aroma with just a hint of a somewhat aged flavor. This imo adds to the authenticity of the style.  Taste: The taste follows the smell to a 'T'.  Mouthfeel: This feels full bodied but isn't that complex. Not to heavy and very nice.  Drinkability: This is a pretty light beer but isn't lacking in body. If there was less alcohol this would be a nice session beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,KTCamm,4.33,"Finally found this on a roatating tap at a BBQ place in New Milford. I'd been seeing Brooklyn October rotated in around Fairfield county, and while a good beer, its not the same.  Poured into a cold pint glass. Deep copper ruby color with a hint of white foam, long gone from the original pour.  Smells malty and bready. The beer was very cold, which I find to mute aromas.  Taste is the classic Octoberfest marzen malt. This beer for me defines that taste, at least for American versions. Some breadiness in there, caramel notes, and a restrained hop - all make for a near perfect taste.  Very drinkable, used to drink these by the gallon. Love this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,drunkboxer1,3.83,Deep ruby color with a white head. Smells like Munich malt (not surprisingly). Sweet taste and a thicker mouthfeel make it stand out compared to the Spaten Oktoberfest I had just before it. More hop bitterness is present in it compared to its European predecessor as well. It's also more carbonated. Pretty decent beer that's on tap in a lot of places.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MaineBirdMan,2.36,"Since the cold air has arrived early and October is almost halfway through, I figured I'd better get in some seasonal beers. I drank this Octoberfest at the same time as another so I could sample the differences.  Poured from a 16.6 oz bottle. Little head of foam.  Color: deep copper. clear and clean appearance.  Nose: slight floral tones.  Taste: A little nutty with a slight bit of fruit.  Mouthfeel: not a whole lot there. Very smooth and creamy. Nice finish.  Drinkability: Very easy. Seem to me that this could be a session beer (I could be way off). I could have quite a few. There just didn't seem to be all that much there in this beer. I didn't find it very interesting. Drinkable not flavorful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TexIndy,3.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by notch on side of front label. It was a clear amber color with several carb streams but no lacing. It had a good sized white head that settled into a good collar and some central wisps.  The aroma was toasted malt, caramel, toffee with not much of a hop presence. On sweet side. The taste was heavy on the toasted malt with less of the sweet coming thru and again not much of a hop presence. Dry. I like my Marzen's to be a little sweeter and less dry. Mouthfeel was crisp with medium body.  Overall, a little below average Marzen for me but comes thru in a pinch when it's best choice on-tap. Worth a try. For me, I won't be buying any 6 packs but there are couple restaurants that we hit that usually have this during the season and is often then only non-BMC option so that's about the only time I'd have it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

There is a bit of a hop aroma, but not much.  Taste: A very nice blend of malt and hops. It has a good flavor while still being smooth. I find this to be much smoother than some other brewery's attempts.  Mouthfeel: Kind of thin, not a whole lot to report here.  Drinkability: Very good.

Lots of toasted grains and caramel on the aroma. Pretty sweet overall, but rather simple and clean.  The flavor is malt-centric, with a fair amount of caramel and a nice toasty quality. Relatively sweet, and next to no hop character.  The beer has a nice texture, although it seems a tad flat.

Plus I think it is my favorite seasonal from Boston Beer so It doesn't let me down.  Drank right out of the bottle, at a festival where I subsequently drank a few more walking around.  Good taste, not like the Munichs that I prefer, yet a little spice here and there which surprises me. Heavier than other lagers, including the Boston Lager, yet with a strong malt flavor and very little hoppiness.

35,102,craftaholic,3.46,"Appearance: Had this one on tap in a 22oz mug. The color was a beautiful translucent effervescent golden copper that really had a beautiful autumnal hue. The head had a decent amount of retention and thin layer of lacing upon dissipation.  Smell: Nothing very complex but rather refreshingly simple with subtle toasted malts and grain.  Taste: Quite mild as the nose led on to. There was a light taste of toasted grains and malt but there was a touch of sweetness that was unexpected and overpowers any hop that is lingering.  Mouthfeel: Remarkably smooth throughout with just the right amount of carbonation to dance across the palate, finishes quite dry and has a sweet malty aftertaste.  Drinkability: Easily drinkable and would definitely session in the thick of this autumnal October month. Nothing off-putting and likely nothing overpowering.  Overall: Was the only thing to really choose from with the beer list the restaurant had. Polished off the tall boy pint with a rack of ribs and it paired nicely.

A: Pours a clear, deep ruby-amber body with good carbonation topped by a finger and a half of sticky off-white foam; decent retention and good lace. Nice but unremarkable looking beer.  S: Rich, grainy malt, with a hint of spice on the finish; smooth, crisp, and refreshing aroma.  T: All malt, much sweeter than the nose; caramel up front, followed by a mellow toastiness and a crisp, dry finish. Not bad at all, but nothing exciting.  M: Medium bodied, a little sharp with the carbonation. A little sticky.  D: I miss hops; even in a malt-forward style like a Marzen, I look for at least a subtle hop profile to keep things balanced. My mouth feels coated with grain, and I know that another sip won't remedy the situation. I'm not craving another one of these (but I suppose a couple more wouldn't kill me).  Notes: I still haven't found an O-fest that I really love (unless you count Avery's Kaiser, but that's a different animal entirely), and this one continues to be one of my favorites - it's tasty and relatively inoffensive. Still, this isn't a seasonal that I get excited about.  Cheers!  Edit: Update for the 2010 iteration.  This year's Sam Octoberfest is considerably better than I remember it being last time around. The malts are dryer and nuttier, there's a distinct German hop presence, and the the mouthfeel is far smoother and better-carbonated.

Smell: Sweet and malty with light caramel. Light yeast and hops.  Taste: Very sweet with hints of caramel. Just enough hops for balance and tartness. Leaves hardly any aftertaste so you can dive right back in.  Mouthfeel: Slightly fizzy and very creamy smooth. Leaves a light coating in the mouth.  Drinkability: Had to check myself as to not guzzle this one. Very good.  Comment: I've found I like Octoberfests more and more as I try more of them.

S- I swear it smells like a fresh pizza, only without the savory oregano+basil, but lots of warm, dough-y yeast-y baked aroma.  T- pizza-dough and crispy crust dominate the main flavor range, with other malt flavors, like vanilla-cookies around the very edges. Swallow leads into a more robust version of this same flavor profile, fading off into a slightly watery and short aftertaste.  M- just about perfect for the style. Substantial in the mouth, but smooth and easy to drink; not watery at all, but not so much texture to it that it hinders quaffing.  D- super, as per the style.

35,102,biegaman,3.81,"Sam Adams Octoberfest is a myriad of the quintessentially fall-time shades of auburn and amber. It is a snapshot of autumn foliage. On the whole, it is quite dazzling; fiery tones of red and coppery glazed oranges flare up when the beer is held against the light. Like its clarity, a majority of the head persists. Although the bulk of it resides along the bumpers there is a thin film that manages to cloak the surface. Lacing drapes the glass.  The aroma exhumes a lot of sulfur. Don't be alarmed - this is common in many lagers. It isn't anything unappetizing but it's not exactly enticing either (and the sizable hint of diacetyl isn't helping things). But that sulfur element is definitely characteristic of many lagers and it is one you can likely learn to live with - if not come to enjoy. Besides, swirling seems to eradicate most of it. You might also note caramel and dried fruit.  A profoundly malty flavour hints at notes of caramel, crackers and cranberries. It is distinctly sweet; a trace amount of hops is detectable but contributes nothing more than a dash of earthiness. The aftertaste has a lengthy linger and leaves your tongue in the clutches of sulfur and dried fruits. I wish this was served in one of those giant 2 liter steins :(  I could probably drink at least a few of those. No kidding. This is one extremely sessionable lager. It is smooth and deliciously sweet. The maltiness is sufficient to provide flavour but not heavy enough to weigh you down. I'm not only drinking this in gulps but have actually caught myself chugging it. To call it quenching is an understatement. Admittedly, I wouldn't know where to draw the line drinking this one.  No wonder Oktoberfest is such a big celebration. Any type of beer this good - especially one only released seasonally - deserves its own ceremony and commemoration. This is a gorgeous, distinctly flavorful, endlessly sessionable lager - in other words, this is a beer perfectly designed for festivities. And you can bet Sam Adams' version will definitely be a source of merriment in my house each fall from here in.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It's certainly more drinkable than most other mass produced beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Not overwhelming at all.. I've had two here at the bar while I wait for the girl to show up, and I could go for a third.  Overall I'm not blown away, but I'm not dissapointed either.

35,102,PintOHops,3.49,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appeared a clear dark amber color, it produced a pretty poor head, equally poor retention, and the lacing isn't worth mentioning. Little carbonation could be seen, almost looked flat minutes after pouring. Smelled of soft, but tart, fruity grape/raisin, following is a dominate malt aroma, very grainy & biscuit like with soft caramel and moderately sweet smelling.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tasted of a bit of citrus as it hits the tongue, then a not so rich but dominate flavor profile of caramel, molasses, and biscuit. Very one noted and not complex flavor profile at all, hardly any hop bitterness noticeable, but just enough for decent balance. All flavors seem to linger a bit on the tongue. Mouthfeel was lightly crisp, then sorta heavy and a bit silky, would have enjoyed a bit more carbonation here. Around full bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - This is an outstandingly session able brew! One could drink 3-4 of these beers and enjoy everyone of them, things I didn't like about it where the appearance and the overall taste. The appearance was lacking horribly as noted above, and there just wasn't any complexity to the taste, it just hits you with an instant flavor of caramel/molasses/biscuit. I thought this Octoberfest was decent but I know there are better, still wasn't bad, and I did enjoy it, so if it's all you can get it's still pretty good.  Cheers and happy Octoberfest!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CAOMarcos,4.08,"I enjoyed this beer poured from a bottle into a Nodic Glass. The beer poured with a rich amber hue with a thick off-white head. The beer smells of the complex mixture of malts. There is a bit of a harsh quality at first taste, but then the aftertaste has a slight hops spiciness and a defined complex sweetness that is really refreshing. Octoberfest has a lot of carbonation and you definitely feel it on the tongue.

First thought I detect a citrus flavor, but I figured that's not the case  T - Definitely German noble hops! Balanced malt, hint of caramel, spice and different characters with every sip, almost complex  M - Came with ok carbonation, just enough. Medium body (could be a little bit more) and without dry finish  D - Absolutely! This beer goes down very smooth and after three there is still room for more.

The malt dominates and offers up a sweet taste with toasted flavors. The hops are very hidden in the background and do not act to balance out the sweetness. A pretty good brew, but I would like to have the sweetness balanced out.  Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Has a lingering sweetness on the finish.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Kromes,3.83,Pours a clear copper color with an off-white head. The aromas are pretty simple. A sweet caramel/toasted malt aroma and a little bit of a yeast aroma. The taste is of caramel malt at first and that gives way to a smooth not too bitter finish(actually the finish is a little bit sweet also). The hop flavors become apparent in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is just about right. A light feel that goes down easy with a little bit of carbonation. Very drinkable beer.

There is just nothing to excite you drinking this beer, Not much of a head, little on the nose. Where are the hops? I know it's not an IPA, but still a little hops showing thru is what makes the European lager shine. Drinks like a BMC in my opinion, and in comparison an expensive one at that. Nice to try but Spaten Oct Fest is much better.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jpeterman,3.83,"--Poured from a 12 ounce brown bottle into a shaker pint. Drink-By date clearly notched on the neck label.--  Appearance- A strong, but smooth pour yields a fairly sizable, off-white head at first, but this only lingers for maybe a minute and a half. However, it manages a nice, sticky lacing all the way down to the last sip. Nice medium to med./dark copper color, no haze what-so-ever. Off to a great start.  Scent- Wonderful malt in the nose, sweet, but not overly. Also, the hops come in, flowery and robust, yet refined, as they should be. Bready as it warms a bit. A very enticing beer, simply with the nose!  Taste/Mouth Feel/Body- As soon as the beer hits my tongue, I catch the sweet malts in the middle. With careful attention, you can catch each of the five malts with a separate sip. The floral hops and light spice balance with a slight bitter bite, rounding this beer out well with every taste. Also, you catch some bread, and some of the more roasted characteristics of the malts. You catch them at the tip, for sure. Nice medium body, yet crisp and quite refreshing. The weight on the tongue is perfect for the style. It goes down pleasantly; very smooth. Aftertaste is all malt, nice and toasty for those cold autumn afternoons and evenings.  Drinkable?- Absolutely. A six pack on a chilly autumn evening would be bliss. Goes down very easy, and doesn't weigh you down despite it's medium body.  Overall- An excellent representation of the style. Boston Beer Company has a certain winner on their hands with this one. Not only is this beer good for an autumn fall-back, but I would call it an Autumn go-to. Not too heavy, not too light, just right for the season. Certainly makes me look foreword to this time of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Hints of malt.  T = Weak malt profile. Sort of bland with a little unpleasant aftertaste. Not much to like here.  M = No complaints about the mouth. Somewhere in the middle.  D = Meh, drinkable in that it's not horrible and there's little alcohol. But not something I'd seek out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Creamy 2 finger head that bubbles over the glass and lines it as well. Smells of malts and breads. Very good sniffer. Quaff is also malty with a sweet finish. Not much lingers for aftertaste. Not much alcohol is noted. Mouthfeel is medium and consistent for the style. Drinkability is pretty high with a solid taste and good for a tight budget.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,washburnkid,3.68,"Deep amber with a frothy white head. A cap of retention sticks around during the session and there's a bit of lace hanging about. Aromas are a straightforward and clean toasted malt. Flavors have toasted and caramel malt. Very basic, and not a lot of hop characteristics to balance it out, but it was still good and really drinkable/refreshing. A nice, medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I enjoyed the beer, but there really wasn't a whole lot to talk about.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,wonderbread23,3.4,Appearance: Rich copper orange color with creamy 1 finger head that quickly dissipates leaving minimal lacing.  Smell: Malt up front with minimal hop bitterness. A little bit of banana bread and caramel.  Flavor: Nice creamy malty beer. Lots of breadyness with a touch of bitter pumpkin / fall spices. The sweetness in this beer tastes less malty and more sugary to me.  Mouthfeel: Feels a little thin for an Octoberfest to me. Lacking the additional body I expected and has a short finish.  Drinkability: Easy drinker. Very smooth alcohol isn't noticed. Quite clean and sessionable.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,vacax,3.75,"Clear caramel brown beer with about a bit under a finger of walnut colored head. It looks like an Oktoberfest indeed. Fair head retention. Fairly aromatic with some nutty caramel malts with a lightly hoppy crispness to it all.  Crisp, nutty caramel malts initially, with a concurrent tingly bitterness toward the center of the mouth. Midpalate has toasty malts and slight fruitiness. Nice bitter finish. A tasty brew, straightforward and nice drinking. Medium body, seems fairly highly carbonated, prickly throughout. Drinkability is nice though, definitely something I wouldn't mind getting a bit of every year. One of the most respectable Sam Adams beers in terms of sticking to the proper style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jhammel01,4.18,One of my favorites...Its a sentimental beer for me..  Pours a deep copper- amber with an offwhite head that sticks for a bit and laces all the way down.  Not much coming from the smell dept. Hops 1st and foremost. I also pick up a few notes of malt and caramel.  Its taste is great....Smooth medium mouthfeel with caramel coming through with slight bitterness. Malt backbone of the beer comes through in the end along with a strong bready aftertaste.  Great beer. I know there is better out there I'm sure (just like every other style) but I really love this beer. My favorite from SA and my favorite of the season.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste- Delicious, solid malt bill, slight sweetness with good balance  Mouthfeel- Excellent and crisp  Drinkability- Much better from a bottle than when I had it on tap. When I had it on tap one was more than enough, though one is not enough when drinking the bottled offering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BamaBeerBuff,3.75,"A: SA Octoberfest is a rich orange/maple color with a solid 2 finger creamy head that slowly falls to a frothy cap of foam over the top. Spots of lace all the way down the glass.  S: Sweeter in aroma than most marzens, it showcases some light caramel and just a twinge of the earthy Munich malt so common to the style. There's also a hint of earthy/herbal hoppiness present. Definitely average for the style, but it gets a bit of a bump for being clean and well balanced.  T&M: A light caramel flavor melds with a dry, slightly earthy/grainy presence mid-palate. There's a black tea-like component in the dryness, as well. A touch of lightly herbal hop flavor is noticed, but not that present. All flavors are somewhat subdued, but it's still flavorful enough. Definitely and clean, crisp, and well balanced marzen. Body is light-ish with a carbonation level that's appropriate--never too aggressive.  D: Overall, definitely a quaffer. Not the most robust or bold marzen you'll find, but one that drinks well enough.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TheMadJack,3.55,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Beer is orange-red with some visible carbonation. The head was more exuberant than other samplings I've encountered from this brewery and I had to do some emergency foam control after the pour. The foam quickly subsided to a film across the top of the glass.  The beer has a mild scent of biscuits and something planty that I can't quite place.  First taste of the beer is sweet and just a little tangy, not unlike yams, over a light base of biscuits. There is almost no hop character. There is a slight aftertaste of green grapes.  The beer is smooth, with very little felt carbonation. It has a nice weight to it on the tongue.  The sweetness of this beer seems to imply an intention to be had with food, as does it's rather straightforward and simple flavor and aroma. Understandable, considering the name. I'd imagine it's phenomenal with brats and mustard, covered in kraut. If I try it this way, I will probably revisit this review. Until then, the sweetness will definitely limit the number of that I can drink without something in between to keep me interested.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Jayli,3.63,"This beer pours a reddish brown with a light tan, 3/4 inch head that recedes relatively quickly leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Nose is rather weak, I picked up the typical Sam's scent coupled with a touch of caramel malt, and a hint of spice. Taste is of caramel malts, witha touch of honey up front, hints of roasted malts are present and a slight touch of floral hops. Nothing really truly jumps out about the taste. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, a nice crisp feel to it. This is a nice beer to sit with, even though nothing truly jumps out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Mavajo,3.85,"Pours a copper/amber color with a distinct reddishness when held up to the light. 1-2 finger thick head that fades quickly. Smell is malty and sweet - seemed a bit floral, too.  Very good taste - it's clearly more malty than hoppy, but a good balance has been struck. Some of the reviews here are pointing out a distinct sweetness, but I didn't really pick up on that - it could be that my tastebuds were out of whack, though. No bitterness. Mild carbonation with a medium body. Very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: Sweet Malt  T: Toasted and bready malt goodness  Mf: Medium bodied. Smooth malt taste with a crisp carbonated finish.  D: Smooth and tasty. I could definitely see kicking back a few of these. Very drinkable.  I was relatively happy with this beer. It was distinctly different than the Sam Adams Boston Lager (Vienna Lager) Now if they could stop putting it on shelves in August, it would be a solid OKtoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A - Clear dark copper body with a 1/2 finger off whit head that disappears quickly.  S - Faint honey and maple syrup with a hint of biscuits.  T - Roasty bread goodness with a honey sweetness. Some floral hops add to the mix. Not a malt monster, but close for the style.  M - Light bodied with good carbonation. Goes down smooth and finishes clean.  D - High. Good in any weather, with any food.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kindestcut,3.41,"The Samuel Adams Octoberfest pours a very bright amber with plenty of effervescence. The white head mostly dissipated after a minute but still clung to life minutes later.  The aroma is malty, definitely sweet, with floral notes. At first taste there is a slight sweetness and a faint bitterness which lingers as a distant aftertaste. There is no dominant sweetness nor is there a flavor I would describe as ""delicious.""  The mouthfeel is very light bordering on watery. Unfortunately for the Sam Adams, I have had some very good Märzens so I some perspective to work with. I would rate this beer as good but not great.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The taste is pretty similar with an initial burst of firm malt followed by a seltzery fizziness and some late nuttiness. Kind of amazing how much this falls off. Its also just a bit too dry- it needs a bit more sweetness for the style. A bit fizzy and light in the mouth, this one seems better suited to a hot southern summer than the fall.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

One finger of beige pillowy head with a touch below average retention and moderate lacing.  3.75 S: Sweet, dense caramel like a pumpkin beer without the pumpkin. Toastiness, clean lager yeast earthiness. Toffee with plum and raisin fruitiness.  3.75 T: Like the nose this is full of rich caramel and toffee, dark fruits, pleasantly toasty, earthy. Dense, but not overly sweet, well balanced, with just a hint of earthy hops.  4.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Wonderfully creamy and super smooth.  3.75 D: Very tasty beer, I wonder what happened the first time.   Poured into a pint glass.  3.0 A: Crystal clear amber color. One finger of beige soapy head with AWEFUL retention and moderate lacing.  3.0 S: Grainy and slightly metallic. Not really anything good going on here. Just grainy and slightly metallic.  3.5 T: It isn't as sweet as unfermented wort, but it is too sweet. It tastes a lot like straight up malted 2-row and crystal malt. By this I mean it tastes like the actual grain and not like beer that has been fermented. It's not terrible, but it's not what I want from an oktoberfest.  4.5 M: Medium body. Very good creaminess and good carbonation as well.  3.0 D: Too sweet for the style and I don't know how much beer I'd want to drink that tastes like grain.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Granted that's still saying a lot about the beer in itself because it has a lot to compare to under the Sam Adams brand.

Real nice feeling to it.  D: Very drinkable. Well balanced.  Overall, this is a real good beer. Perfect for a get together whether you grab a 12 pack or a sixer, you're good to go.

A pleasant grainy aroma enters the nose. The taste was a little softer than the scent led me to expect, but still nicely grainy and slightly sweet.

The bottle proclaims it was brewed in ""American tradition"".  It doesn't look unlike a normal Oktoberfest. It has a large 3 finger head that quickly dissipates and a dark amber body. Lacing looks ""dirty"".  Smell is a bit sweeter, and almost pale ale like than most Oktoberfests. It literaly reminds me of an Eastern pale ale mixed with a Boston Lager rather than an Oktoberfest/Maerzen. Not sure what they were going for here.  Taste is rather absurd for an Oktoberfest. it tastes overly buttery and nutty. Also it is watered down and metallic. The hops are the only decent thing about this beer. The mouthfeel isn't too offensive, I figured it would be more carbonated but it has a similar mouthfeel to a traditional German Oktoberfest. The aftertaste of this beer isn't very good though, and there is something just off in the taste, I am content with drinking just one.

The taste is almost a pumpkin-spice flavor upfront, followed by mild biscuit malts and a distinct diacetyl presence on the finish. I remember having this on tap and thinking that the diacetyl flavor was extremely overpowering, here, though, it seems to complement the other flavors of the beer more gracefully.  Mouthfeel is somewhat medium-bodied; I think this one could have benefited from a little less carbonation, actually.

The body is on the lighter side, making for a quaffable beer. That's what I want from an Oktoberfest. Really smooth carbonation.  I want to dock points for the incorrect spelling of Oktoberfest.

Very faint piney hop hint to this as well  T- Like the aroma there is a big sweet malt upfront. Slight metallic hint to this. Herbal hops in the back of this as well. Nice toffee flavors come through in the middle and dies down in the backdrop of this beer.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel. Carbonation level is almost dead on with the style. I could maybe use a spec more carbonation to be honest. Malty tones come over everything while on the palate. Good malty aftertaste in this beer.

Taste: It has a good balance of bittering and aroma hops, so I have to say it has a very balanced taste. The caramel definitely comes through in the malt and the head is held nicely with a good pour. Just like most Samuel Adams brews, when the head is nicely formed the aroma shines. Regardless, it's still an excellent taste.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and sweet on the tongue. It reminds me of brown sugar.  Drinkability: Definitely a seasonal beer. The sweetness would be too much to drink regularly.  Final thoughts: Definitely recommend this one to everyone.

35,102,NeutroMan,3.88,"On-tap at Pinstripes in Glenview (sitting in the Adirondack chairs by their fire pit). Served in a straight pint glass. Reviewed from notes 18 September 2009.  Appearance: Clear dark amber color with decent sized head that recedes to a persistent cap and leaves good sticky lacing.  Smell: Some caramel malts, toasted bread and moderate herbal hop aroma.  Taste: Consistent with the nose - sweet malts, slightly metallic taste. Some herbal hop spiciness. Like most Boston Beer Co offerings, malts and hops are wonderfully balanced.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-light-bodied. Malts are a bit chewy.  Drinkability: This one goes down pretty easy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,beer2day,3.59,"Pours orange to gold with a forced 2-finger head. Good retention. Nice lacing. Not the best color, but a good-looking beer.  Nose is all malt, what nose there is. Very faint indications of bread and toast. Not a lot going on here.  Hits the tongue very sweet and finishes even sweeter. Slight clove flavor. Very nice for the style.  Mouthfeel is a little syrupy, but again that is to be expected.  Overall easy drinker and worth another when better alternatives are not available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Mitchster,4.03,"I've reviewed this beer on this site before, but that review has since disappeared, so am writing another. This was purchased as part of the brewmaster 12 pack. 12 oz bottle. OG=14 plato, 180 kcal/12oz. 5.4% ABV. Brewed with 2-row Harrington, Metcalfe, Munich-10, 2-row Moravian, and Caramel 60. Hopped with Tettnanger and Hallertau-Mittlefruh.  Pours out to a clear medium amber, forming a nice sized whipped off-yellow head with good retention and nice sheets of lace. The carbonation level is moderate. The aroma is mild with some toasted malts, nuts (almonds?), toast, some herbal hops when swirled, and some sour milk when swirled. The mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body. The taste opens with some spicy but not overwhelming hops up front, then is followed by some nice pale and alber malts in the middle, imparting a decent toast and grain husk note. Bitterness is moderate, and the aftertaste is composed of tobacco and herbal hops.  A decent drinkable oktoberfest. Not one of the smoothest or most drinkable out there (i.e-I'll stick to Ayinger), but a decent mass produced US version of a classic style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CupcakeNY,2.5,"Decided to try this, though I have not been that impressed with Sam Adams lately. And I was once again disappointed. Poured a medium brown, with little head, whatever there was quickly dissipated. Nose was a bit malty, with yeasty notes, but not overpowering or complex. Mouth feel was much thinner than I expected, watery, and relatively tasteless. Finish was somewhat unpleasant, a bit sour. All in all, I would not buy it again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bolus14,4.5,"This is my first review, and I'm coming from drinking the good 'ol shitty American macro brews!! With that said there is a huge difference in smell, taste, mouth feel, etc.  Smell to me is sweeter (spices) with a hint of bread dough, I assume this is a roasted malt smell.  Taste, well there is a lot more than the macros. Not being able to separate the individual characteristics I would say caramel/tofee malts upfront then a very slight hop bitter.  Mouthfeel is a little ""heavier"" than the macros but still smooth and easy going down just enough carbonation.  Drinkability, this is the first beer I've had that I can sip, chug, actually enjoy without feeling like I have to force down the last half off the bottle. Update - After over a year of trying craft and macro micro brews this still remains my favorite. I can drink this after mowing the yard, playing cards, watching football, playing darts, you name it this beer works.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A little beer ring lacing remains, but mostly recedes back into the brew.  S: Oaky roasted malt, nuts, and butterscotch.  T: Malt is peaty and nutty. A little pungent, and a little sweet.  M: A little overly-carbonated. Light but hearty. The peaty flavor remains.  D: Good flavor and body makes for a pleasant drink.  Pretty solid appearance, and a pleasing nose.

35,102,PerroGrande,3.92,"Pours to a deep golden/copper color with moderate head that (unfortunately) fades away to nearly nothing with little remnants on the glass.  The aroma of this beer is malty and pleasing. I find a few hints of caramel in the aroma as well.  This is a tasty beer with nice malty characteristics balanced by some gentle hops finish. Not overly bitter, but certainly not a sweet beer. After giving this beer a chance to warm up a bit and breathe, more character and subtlety appears. Very late, the hops fades in favor of malt and caramel hints.  Mouthfeel is smooth with acceptable amounts of carbonation. Not overly creamy, but not watery.  Drinkability is also good. I want another one!  This is certainly a decent example of a domestic Oktoberfest beer.

35,102,drtth,4.05,"Served in a Pils style glass. A glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a crystal clear shiny bright copper orange color with a ¼"" tan head that soon recedes to small ring and minimal surface cover. Sipping leaves light speckled lacing throughout most of the beer.  Smell: The aroma is a nice blend of rich bready caramel malt with faint spicy hop well integrated into the background  Taste: The flavor is fresh, clean, and dominated by the bready malt that has a rich sweet caramel flavor and touches of nuttiness. This is backed up by faint hop spiciness which never dominates, just supports.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is smooth and medium-bodied with a light steady carbonation. The finish is medium length and mostly soft sweetness from the malt tapering off to a dry and lightly spicy end from the hops  Drinkability: I quite like this beer. It is very drinkable and well worth returning to.

Nice and clean finish. Low bitterness. Not a lot of complexity, but easy drinking, and good.  Mouthfeel: It would be better, but is hurt by the low carbonation. It almost feels a little flat.

35,102,NekotoNikku,3.6,"A - Golden amber colour, about an inch of head, nice lacing present that clung seductively to the side of the glass.  S - Nice toasty smell, semi-sweet fragrance, easy on the nose.  T - This was my first Oktoberfest, so I honestly wasn't sure what to expect and tried to not bring any pre-conceived notions to the table, despite being let down by Sam Adams' beers in the past. However! This one was pretty good, semi-sweet chocolate flavor in the beginning, which trailed off into a toasty flavor, not too alcoholic and a little sweeter at the end, which was welcome. Also had a nice nutty aftertaste, which I love in beer.  M - Not very alcoholic, rather smooth and it left me with a pleasant semi-sweet aftertaste once I'd finished the beer. Sort of like when you finish a food you really enjoy and there's that aftertaste that keeps making you remember it and smile.  D - I could've probably had a few of these before I got tired of the taste, but I'm a bit of a lightweight, so I usually limit myself to 1 beer a meal.  Honestly the only reason I didn't rate this higher, despite the flavors I tasted (and enjoyed), was because it didn't seem that complex.

Toasted malts hit's you at first followed by a sweeter caramel aroma that finishes it off.  Taste again very malty with a slight sugary kiss on the lips.A perfect ending of hops that balances this maltiness perfectly.

A few foamy rings of lace trail along the inside of the glass.  S: Some toasty/caramel malt aromas are definitely present. A mild hop presence offers leafy and light earthen notes. A bit of a tartness as well, although difficult to place.  T: The malt flavors take the stage here, and they are equally toasty and caramel-flavored. Sweetness is noticeable at first, but it is kept in check by a dash of hoppiness. Leafy and mild earthy hop notes are present, adding moderate bitterness. There are some complexities at work as well, with tealike tannins and toffee flavors among them.  M: Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. Fairly crisp and definitely on the dry side into the finish.  D: A pretty solid Oktoberfest from SA. I brought home a smorgasbord of fall seasonals the other day, and this is the first I've gotten down to reviewing. It's nice to begin the switch from summer brews to something a little maltier.

Flavor is an underwhelming, but tasty, simple mix of caramel, slightly toasty grain notes on the front of the sip, followed by gentle notes of sweet and bitter, that finish too quickly for a marzen. My mouth waits for a wave of bitter and/or malty flavors that does not arrive.  Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation is good, there is a slight metallic taste in the cling.

A good amount of visible carbonation keeps a slight, sat half, of the beer covered. A touch of lacing.  S- Lots of sweet caramel malts in the nose. Its not very aromatic. It's good its just needs more of what it has.  T- Very clean caramel malts. It starts out big and sweet then comes across with the roasted caramel malts. Very pleasing. The finish is light with a slight residual sweetness.  M- Its a good medium beer, with what feels like a touch too much carbonation. More bittering hops would be better at keeping the finish dry.  O- this is a very pleasing beer. Very good caramel malt taste to it. It could have a touch more hops to the finish, they are almost not present and it seems could benefit by drying out the finish a bit more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Vonerichs,3.63,"Amber color with a foamy off white head.  The smell is caramel malt with a little bit of bread, not very strong.  The taste is very thin and watery. The malt is caramel and a touch of honey. It has a light touch of figs.  Mouthfeel is light bodied and as I already said, a little watered down. I was expecting something more full bodied.  No issues with drinkability. Easy to consume quite a few.  This was a decent tasting beer, but I wish the flavor was more pronounced.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,simskl,4.63,"One of my favorite beers. I love the arrival of fall so that I can grab a 24 of Octoberfest.  It pours a beautiful amber color with a small short lasting cream colored head.  The smell is very malty with a sweet overtone that doesn't last long because I drink the first one far too quickly.  This beer is very much of the Marzen type, very little hop in the smell but it can be tasted with no real bitterness. The test is not quite sweet and very deep.  Very easy to drink, and very very tasty. I love this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,rosmhuire,3.27,"Had a pint of the latest Sam offering at my local pub. Poured a beautiful amber color. Nice head but not much on the nose. Taste is simple bordering on watery - not a lot going on here. Still , a very quaffable beer. Could easily throw back 3-4 of these, though my 16 month old started fussing as soon as I got my 2nd pint.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kels,3.93,"Oktoberfest tasting away, starting with the Sam Adams. Review is on the bottle poured into my pint glass.  Appearance: Pours dark coppery red with great clarity that shows the ample amounts of carbonation running throughout. The initially monstrous (I'm a hard-pourer) off-white lofty head fades immediately to a watery skim and leaves behind chunks of spotty lace along the walls of the glass.  Smell: Really nice honey-roasted grains smell pleasantly toasted and crisp. There's not much to mention in the way of hops, but there is a distinct metallic presence in the aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel: There's a really nice, refreshing quality to this marzen. Feel is pretty bright with a full-feeling quality. The hops not so present in the smell come through subtly as sweet citrus that adds to the brightness of the flavors and feel. The malts, however, play clear center-stage in the beer. They are nicely toasted and sweet without being too heavily roasted or too caramelly sweet. I like the balance a lot. Feel starts to fade fast though - gets waterier quickly as I drink.  Drinkability: Super-high, as expected for the style. A little too sticky in the finish to give it a 5, but really nice and surprisingly light and refreshing. Good transition from summer to fall.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bamadog,3.36,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass - here's to finally being done with duty! Cheers!  Appearance: Pours a deep coppery color with some hints of ruby; body is pretty clear and shows some moderate carbonation bubbling slow up in straight lines from the bottom; comes with a nice one finger head that is off-white and fades to a nice moderate and full skim on the surface, leaving behind an oily film on the sides of the glass that won't allow the spotty lacing to hold.  Smell: Not pulling much out of the nose at all really, just a little bit of a toasty/grainy aspect - very lager-esque...  Taste: Not much in terms of flavor either - doesn't really stand out to me as the seasonal offering and is more or less reminisicent of a standard lager - some nice toasty graininess, very light maltiness adds a tad of sweetness to it, but beyond that nothing is jumping to the palate.  Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy and smooth; nice carbonation that isn't too sharp keeps the body lively; slightly tingly and leaves a fairly sticky residue throughout the mouth - the body is actually quite solid in this beer and one of the better aspects to judge it by.  Drinkability: A pretty quaffable beer from Sam Adams, but nothing to really get excited about in terms of it being a seasonal when there are much better offerings from other breweries that seem to add something more worthwhile to their Oktoberfests. I could easily sit through several of these in a night though as the flavors are nice and the ABV is manageable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mdquigley,3.56,"Sight: Poured into a pint glass, this beer is deep amber, almost orange. Head is slight and disappears quickly.  Smell: Sweet and malty, but it's not strong. This is certainly not going to be a swing-for-the-fences honest-to-god Marzen. It is pleasant, however.  Taste: Delicious maltiness, tinged with a little bitter hops at the end. Aftertaste lingers for a few seconds and is malty. Not a powerful taste, will disappoint if you're looking for a hearty brew. It was too cold when I began drinking. After warming up the beer released some gentle spiciness; notes of cinnamon.  Mouthfeel: A bit too carbonated, but highly drinkable. Again, not the fullest of beers, drank three and was extremely happy as well as satiated.  Overall: This used to be my favorite beer. Along with Fat Tire and Young's Double Chocolate, it was my intro to beer. Will always buy a six pack when I'm looking for something familiar, inexpensive, and moderately filling -- not to mention tasty. One of the better Sam Adam's out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Parched,4.03,A - Nice ruddy brown with sparse head and minimal lacing.  S - Aroma reminds me of plums and dried chili peppers.  T - Pleasant maltiness with hoppiness in the background. Tending toward sweet but not unbearably so.  M- As a fall brew should be; a little more weighty.  D - I'll quaff this brew in season and I appreciate its relatively low alcohol content for the shear pleasure of being able to have several if I wish,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,sisuspeed,2.82,"Reviewed this along with Left Hand's, Harpoon's and Otter Creek's Oktoberfest beers.  Poured this into a pint glass. The color is a red amber, slightly darker and clearer than the others I tried. Lots of bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass, but absolutely no head, and I gave this a generous pour.  The aroma is almost untraceable. But what I do pick up is some sweet malt smell, but that is about it.  The taste is malty and a bit fruity with some spice thrown in. I also taste something that seems like a cross between pumpkin or squash, and sour milk. It's not unpleasant, but different. A little bit of hops dancing around in the background, but mostly unnoticeable.  The mouthfeel is definitely the most watery of the four Oktoberfests I had this afternoon. Overall though, the drinkability is decent. When I try to summarize this beer the image/flavor that comes to mind is sweet malty, slightly sour pumpkin. It is odd. I wouldn't say it is bad, but definitely different. Maybe this bottle hasn't been stored properly, or maybe this is what Sam Adams Oktoberfest is like. Either way, I would only want one of these in a sitting and overall, I'm not very impressed by this beer. There are much better Oktoberfest options.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,abuliarose,2.3,"Poured into a pint glass. Color is a rich orange with very slight head, but many big bubbles coating the inside of the glass. Things die down quickly as it would seem to flatten as I type. Smells slightly sour with faint traces of malt.  Tastes lightly malty and malt-nutty over citrus notes with an almost imperceptible bitter aftertaste. I can really taste the sourness I am smelling, though... almost like milk gone bad. Not appealing at all.  Otherwise, the mouthfeel is light and carbonation is so gentle and rounded that it's watery-smooth. The overall flatness and my urge to pour it down the drain when I whiff it make the drinkability low for me. Maybe I had a bad bottle but man, this would not be my first Oktoberfest choice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,wahhmaster,3.68,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an unbranded nonic imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a brownish-amber color with a thick pillowy head. Head leaves a nice lacing as it dissipates.  Smell: Has a sweet smell with strong hops notes. Smells pretty damn good. Some malts are also present.  Taste: Has a pleasing sweet taste with just a little bit of hoppy bitterness. Pretty tasty.  Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth with almost no noticeabl carbonation.  Drinkability: A solid Oktoberfest and another good beer from Sam Adams. Like most of Sam Adams' beers, this beer isn't the best of its style but still is a good representation of the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Bubbly one inch head on it. Quick dissipation, sides o the glas left clean.  S - Smooth, sweet malts. A little bit toasty, not a whole lot of hops or citris in this one.  T - Toasty malts, a lot of caramel. Little bit of hops, more than I was able to pick up on the nose. Fairly sweet.  M - Medium bodied, a little more full than I was expecting. Leaves the mouth quickly.  D - Easy to get down, and can do more of these. Nothing fantastic, but a solid offering from the folks at Boston Beer.

35,102,jeffthecheff,3.54,"I felt the first chill in the air this season, so being excited for fall beer season (I sound like a Sam Adams commercial, but I do love the beer seasons) I decided to pick up the SA harvest collection pack. After breaking a bit of sweat playing tennis, an octoberfest with dinner outside just seemed right.  Octoberfest pours a medium amber color with a nice, fluffy white head, but it ends up dying down to a disappointing lace.  Aroma is malty sweet with some slight spiciness. I'm thinking nutmeg....can that be right? Well, I checked it out by cracking some nutmeg in my hand and smelling it after the beer, and yes...there seems to be some nutmeg character. (Or at least I convinced myself there was) Also a tiny hint of cherry pits.  Flavor is caramely with a big sweetness. Slightly dry and bitter finish reminds me of what a dry leaf would taste like...ok, the whole seasons thing is really getting in my head now.  Mouthfeel is about average. A nice body, maybe a little light, but it would be improved by less carbonation to really bring out that smoothness and big lager character.  This beer is a nice seasonal offering. It doesn't pique my interest enough to want to session right now, maybe it's too early in the season (hasn't even started yet).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste: Starts with a slightly sweet flavor, ending with hints of caramel. Again, all kinds of malt.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, balanced carbonation.  Drinkability: A good Octoberfest beer and, once again, a solid effort from Sam Adams. This is my go-to O-fest beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Mouthfeel- Soooo smooth, nicely full bodied but not to heavy. Wonderful  Drinkability- It's very easy to drink a 12 pack.  Why is this only a seasonal? I look forward to this beer every year.

Deep, bready malt with a sweetness to it.  The taste is kind of unremarkable though. Doesn't really live up to the appearance or the smell.  Nice body.  I like this beer, but after an exciting pour and first whiff the flavor left me kind of underwhelmed. Still pretty good though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I though I wasn't going to like this since I'm an IPA guy but wow! It is a great tasting brew that I wish I had a braught or sausage to go along with right now.  M: Perfect medium carbonation. Goes down smooth.  D: Highly drinkable. I can't wait for a cool autumn Sunday to put a bunch of these back while watching the Dallas Cowboys kick some butt.

There is decent carbonation and for the color it is surprisingly clear.  The aroma is very sweet, you can real smell the malts. There notes of candy, light hops.  The taste is very light and drinkable, there is no taste of hops which is unusual.

35,102,bump8628,4.3,"Poured into a pilsener glass with 1/2 inch of barely off-white head. The beer is vibrant amber/orange, the epitome of autumn.  Aroma is rich and malty. Bread crust, toast, caramel, and even some light toffee. A little bit of spicy German noble hops also peek through.  The taste follows the aroma with bready, toasty and caramelly flavors. It's perfectly balanced and the malt flavors are really nice, rich, and complex. Hops are present with a light spiciness.  Medium in body with a smooth mouthfeel and crisp, mildly sweet finish.  I may have a little bias on this one as it's the beer that originally got me interested in craft beers and brewing. It's one of my favorites to have around in the fall and a great one to have while watching football.

Good malt complexities in the nose and mouth, with just enough hopping to round out the flavor.

Smell: Smells very dry, with notes of toast and spicy noble hops. Really don't detect very much here.  Taste: Light flavored Marzen overall. Slightly sweet caramel and toast. Minor spicy noble hop finish. Don't really notice much biscuit, as expected for the style. While it sounds like I am complaining, I really do like this beer and its overall balance.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, medium but thin body, fairly smooth and slightly dry finish.

Depending on how carefully you pour it you can get a very thick frothy head with multiple sized bubbles or if your careful like you'll get a just an about 1 fingered head that goes away in about a minute or two. Either way you'll get a light caramel colored head with better than average lacing. The smell is very good, roasted malts take up the bulk of the smell. To me it smells like fall. Taste is very good too. More malty than hoppy like most Octoberfests, not quite as well balanced as the traditional Boston Lager but still fairly well balanced and a good brew. Mouthfeel is good, I'd consider it a slight step above a medium bodied beer with excellent drinkability, I could drink this all day. A usual standby for me every fall until I get sick of drinking it.

Some biscuit and caramel malt flavor with a kiss of hops to help balance all the malts. Tasty! Nice medium mouthfeel. I can drink a few of these. This is going well with my pizza tonight.

Following that is a bit of floralness from the hops and then a big cereal aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a dryer finish.

T: Sweet and bready, a little caramel as the smell would suggest. Hops are present in the taste and provide a nice balance.  M: Medium bodied with a very smooth finish. Almost no aftertaste.  D: As drinkable of a marzen as you'll find on the market.  While Samuel Adams often gets downgraded by a lot of beer geeks and gurus for being little more than a nice stepping stone between mainstream beer and craft beer, the fact is, they're as big as they are for a reason.

I caught hints of caramel and spicy sweetness, which was quite refreshing. There wasn't too much carbonation, just enough to caress the tongue a little bit and dissipate, which suited me just fine.  It's on the sweetish side, which enhances the drinkability for me. The clean looks and taste are quite appealing, and it goes down easily. I finished it quicker than I thought I would. The only reason I didn't order another one is because my friends and I had to leave.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Aroma is a little soapy and mineraly. Usually not the case in SA beers. Otherwise just light of toasted malt.  As far as taste goes, this is one of my favorite Oktoberfests made by any brewery. It's like a smooth munich/vienna malt milkshake. Tastes of toasted malt with a very heavy body that makes you really in the mood for fall. Some candy-like sweetness. Finishes very clean and heavy with a slightly sweet hop aftertaste.  I'd say the only things this beer lacks is some aroma and a more authentic German feel.

It looked good reddish brown with good long lasting staying power.  The aroma was as expected, some malt  The taste was thin, not much malt or hop flavor. Just plain bland, as I continued to drink I kept trying to find some distinctive flavors, none there. The finish was not a crisp as I would expect from a quality lager.  I will avoid in the future.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Drinkability was very good, a safe, comfortable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Brenden,3.8,"The review is the same as from the bottle. The difference is that, firstly, I didn't get quite the same head as I poured myself; secondly, aromas and flavor, while the same, were stronger from the tap.  This is a dark amber-brown color with a tight brown head that stays a while at two fingers and leaves some patchy lacing partway down the glass. There are some grains underneath a predominantly malt aroma backed by hops. It's straightforward. The flavor holds a little more balance and complexity than the aroma, and the variance of malts works nicely. Along with a bread / biscuit there's a gentle nutmeg-like nip just underneath. This is a decent blend of smooth and crisp in the mouthfeel, though neither is prominent. Carbonation is on the light side of moderate and body is medium. Overall I like this brew, and it's a tasty one, but it's all a little light and muted. A macro drinker could definitely handle this, and it would serve well as a gateway brew to bolder beers, especially Oktoberfest beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I know they're a bigger operation, but you can taste the love. Tastes deep and complex, sweet grains and molasses.  Mouthfeel is good. Creamy and comforting.

The smell is of sweet oranges mixed with malt. The flavor is faintly citrus but mostly malty with a hint of sweetness. It's a fairly sweet beer but it has a hint of a bitter aftertaste. I was surprised at the complexity of this one. A bit more carbonation than I would want, but not so much that it's overbearing. I could easily drink several of these. A nicely enjoyable beer.

S - Light malty nose - only a hair of a caramel toffee malt comes through.  T - Starts off malted and sweet. Only a bit of biscuit sweetness. Switches to a hair of bittering without an overt hop flavor. Finishes with a light yeast note, giving it more of a bready base. The aftertaste does reveal just a light amount of earthy bavarian hops.  M - Moderate body - carbonation light. Beer is clinging - sugar sticks to the tongue.  D - Moderate to moderate-high drinkability. ABV is manageable. Flavors are generally underwhelming - sessionable. Not filling.  Overall, a bit on the boring side, but stylistically it fits.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: it doesn't have the same aroma as some of the top-notch oktoberfest biers, but just enough sweetness to lure you in. T: follows the smell--mild sweetness, a little malty, but nothing special. The taste is not full enough to be a solid fest-marzen brew. M: not bad. D: Could easily have a few of these without thinking about it. Goes down easy but it isn't a bier that I would get excited about having with friends. If it is there, I'll drink it.  Overall, I was a little disappointed with this bier.

Retention and lacing are both decent.  The nose starts with a sweet smell before changing to one of bread and spices. The taste contains the same flavours, but the sweetness hangs around as the bready and spicy notes appear. They meld before leading to a bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is on the thin side with a good amount of carbonation to create a crisp beer. Drinkability is good; it leaves me wanting more.

Mouthfeel: Has a very smooth and easy begin on the tongue but does finish with a slight bitterness to it. Does not have a clean finish.  Drinkability: I love this beer.

Even though it's not fall yet in Florida, I saw it in the store today and had to pick up a 12 pack for $13.99... here goes the first one:  a- pours a dark brown/gold with a 1/2"" head - leaves lacing that falls after a few seconds.  s- not to much here. i get some hints of malts, but nothing stands out.  t- similar to the boston lager, but more on the malty side, but still balanced. The malt flavors really jump out: oak, cream, and spice. While the hops are pretty mild, they are still noticeable and give it a slightly bitter finish, which really smooths the deal out.  m- on the light side, lots of carbonation  d- you can certainly stick with octoberfest for the evening. You're gonna want more than one - no doubt. A great beer to drink on the first cool days of the season (even though that's still months away here in FL. It's currently 90 degrees)  an additional note- ive got to say this first beer isnt as good as i remember it being in years past. It seems much lighter, almost that watered down feel. This could be due to two things- first i had really high expectations for this beer, as i enjoy it so much every fall, and second, as the flavors, feel, and ""mood"" of this beer are geared towards cooler weather, I think that cool days are an essential element for enjoying it the way it was intended to be enjoyed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

There is a caramel sweetness which again doesn't fit the style, and again I could care less because it works  M: This beer is low in carbonation which helps give it an incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

Best by January -- interesting that the label has ""Lager"" printed in one corner and ""Ale in TX"" in another.  *Adding an updated edition here having picked up some newer Sam almost 2 months later. Label marked best by March.  A -- Deep amber to copper color with a thick, light tan head that holds up very well.  S -- Somewhat fruit estery at first whiff, not from hops -- more from ferment or yeast. Earthiness back, some spicy alcohol eeking thru. Fruitiness is still apparent, but there's more malt sweetness dominant  T -- Hmm. Nutty, grainy, ""beery"" flavor. Tends to remind me of some pub-brewed amber lagers. Some vague fruitiness and slightest diacetyl back. No real sweetness up front, some vague hops in the finish.  More malty sweetness and no diacetyl in this batch, not as thin as the January bottles. Very tasty.  M -- Medium body with a soft, smooth mouthfeel.  D -- I'm just a little disappointed in this year's take on the style. The flavor just seems a little lacking, a little weak, though it goes down nicely.  This batch seems more on par with the Sam Octo of years past.

The carbonation is very prevalent, and the color is a pretty way to start off fall, so I'll give it above average.  S: sweet pale and caramel malts. Not overwhelming, which is again a little disappointing, though far from bad. I just expect Sam Adams to turn out really solid beer every time.  T: I enjoy the taste. I personally prefer maltier beers, so I don't mind the milder hop presence in this instance of Märzen beer. The taste is of sweet malts, as mentioned in the smell category.  M: bubbly bite initially, feels medium bodied, creamy.  D: To me, this is very quaffable -- I didn't notice how fast my glass emptied, but at 5.7%, that is somewhat of a problem.

Head dissipates rather quickly, but leaves a nice film over the top of the beer.  S/T: The aroma is semi-sweet. Some caramel and toffee in there. Taste is pretty similar with the caramel and toffee notes coming thought. Some breadyness in there. I don't get that real musty and earthy flavor that is common in most Octoberfests, which is a good thing. Pretty good beer, although somewhat lacking in complexity and character.  M/D: Medium to light bodied with nice carbonation. Mouthfeel is a little oily, but finishes pretty clean. Drinks rather easily, and would not be problematic to drink more than one.

Taste - Roasty malts, biscuty, toffee, caramel...as it slides over my tongue it reminds me of cooler fall days and ""easier"" times...  Mouthfeel - Nice and creamy (medium body), smooth, highly carbonated so that it almost ""pricks"" the tongue but oh so enjoyable.  Drinkability - Very drinkable.

A decent amount of grassy and earthy hop characteristics to round it out.  Taste is bready up front with a bit of a grainy quality, hops come in midway through leaving a grassy and earthy linger. A bit of sweetness comes through in the back. It's probably just something to do with the seasonal nature of it, but I keep wanting to equate the taste with autumn leaves...

Decent carbonation helps cloak the sugars on the finish, giving a good feel. Nonetheless a bit rich on the tongue limiting drinkability.

35,102,JesseP09,4.2,"This is one of the Boston Beer Company's most drinkable brews. Octoberfest has a delicious pumpkin-spice taste and feels rich like the season it was brewed for in your mouth. The smell and appearance are pretty standard offerings for Sam, nothing too special.

35,102,jimj21,3.48,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a very clear, light copper color. Capped by about two fingers of creamy white head, which fades quickly. Leaves some lacing on the glass. Steady bubbles stream to the top.  Not too much in the way of smell. A bit of toasty sweetness from the malt and maybe a little spiciness from hops.  Pretty sweet up front. Tastes of caramel and spice. Some lightly toasted bread as well. A bit of tartness on the finish. Also a dry finish.  A little prickly at the front of the tongue but a little watery on the back. I could definitely drink a few of these. Not my favorite offering from Samuel Adams, but good nonetheless.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Vengeance526,3.53,"Pours a clean copper color with a 1 finger white head that slowly dies down to a thin ring and leaves a pretty good deal of lacing.  As expected, lots of malt upfront in the nose. A very bready profile.  Taste reveals a nice caramel sweetness along with notes of bread, honey and a little toffee. Not too overpowering but definitely a very malty offering.  Medium body and carbonation. This is a nice fall seasonal, always better paired with a nice meal. I drank another by itself and didn't find it quite as enjoyable so for me this is always a meal compliment.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,tzieser,3.95,"i saw this at a nearby corner store....i had to grab it. Octoberfest can be extremely hard to find in the off season....especially when they're already pushing out the White Ale. I'm glad they didnt get rid of this stuff. the ""best if drank by"" date isnt until march  pours a deep amber, slightly copper color with a small one finger head that gives way to a small lacing  smells of sweet malts...some caramel maybe. the smell is a bit watery....not bad though..this could be due to it's maturity  tastes good. very malty, as it should be. the complex malts give it a rich, slightly sweet flavor. i really like the aftertaste too. very good flavor overall  mouthfeel is good. still slightly carbonated even though its a little old. i'm glad to see it didnt go flat.  drinkability is outstanding. i could drink a bunch of these.  overall- this is an above average octoberfest. i always grab one at least once a month or so when it's around and i'm always looking forward to the next batch. keep em comming.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kingothewoods,3.36,Orange-red color with decent head. Good looking beer. Smells of sweet malt. Makes your throat curl while swallowing. Tastes of very sweet creamy malt with a hint of fruit.

35,102,BladeRunner,3.97,"I'm looking at my score and I understand it may at first glance appear too high, but keep in mind that an extra .5/1 point for each category is a big difference to me when reviewing beers, so take that for what it's worth. On to the review.  Pours a nice dark copper with a white head that doesn't stay for very long.  Lot's of bready, caramel and slight honey notes hit the nose. A very pleasant aroma that I really dig.  A sweet caramel/honey malt comes through at first sip, but then the spicy/herbal noble hops come through that help keep the finish from being overall too sweet. Really love the malty flavors.  Body is light-medium, with a finish that is just slightly on the dry side.  This beer is very refreshing, and the malts while semi-complex are never overbearing. It's a very flavorful session beer that in my honest opinion has a better overall flavor compared to Boston Brewery's regular Boston Lager. I wish this was year round.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Beernoisseur,3.53,"Pours on the red side of copper, with a decent head, good retention with ultra fine lacing  S -sweet malts, dusty, slightly fruity characters. not bad.  T - Warm and malty. Definitely on the sweet side. Not much hop character to speak of, perhaps a bit of tang on the finish. pretty good tasting.  M - The carbonation is pretty strong. Not bad, but a bit more aggressive than I prefer.  D - I could put down a few of these from Halloween to Christmas, but that'd satisfy me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,StarlightSeraph,3.65,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Poured a clear, golden-red with a white, one finger, slowly subsiding head. Left almost no lacing.  Smell: Bready and malty, and a caramel sweetness that seems to be present in all Sam Adams beers.  Taste: A quick bite of caramel sweetness with slightly bready/biscuity undertones. Watered-down malty flavors. Almost no hops detected. The flavor leaves just as quickly as it arrives, with a minimal aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation makes it a little sharp on the tongue, and prevents it from being a quick drink. Feels nice and thick on the tongue, creamier then I would have expected for this kind of beer.  Drinkability: It has a very smooth flavor, but the harshness of the carbonation makes this difficult to drink quickly. It's a solid beer to have a couple of while hanging out with friends.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Low head retention S- strong aroma of caramel with a malt background. T- Lot's of caramel! Great malty finish. Fairly filling. M- Fine, sweet coating. D- I wouldn't say I could power through a bunch. This is a nice seasonal treat a couple at a time.  I had to re-visit this beer. I originally never liked it much. And it was usually served to me quite cold. I just grabbed one from the basement, so it's probably around 52-ish (my basement is cold and un-finished heh) and I was surprised at the overwhelming caramel characters that I missed while it was cold. When it was cold it was almost a bit bitter/harsh and shallow. I'm glad I tried it again!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,pandashaver,3.1,"Moderate aroma of malt, carmel, and candy corn over breadiness. Poured a deep, transparent orange/brown...very festive. Head is fizzy, not large, little lacing, and not lingering. Dominant malty sweetness in the flavor, with only a very lighty bitter hop flavor. A light syrup character on the palate that sticks around for a little bit. Definitely a great complement to some good grub.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,skeetermoses,4.27,"I was very surprised by this one. I really am not the biggest fan of Sam Adams beers, they tend to really never impress me until today.

NIce floural hops and good amber color, this one may be me new Octoberfest o' choice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,prototypic,3.65,"Appearance: It's very clear and bronze/copper in color. Sitting atop is a vanilla colored head that's about a finger and a half deep. Retention was pretty short. Perhaps it had to be somewhere. Light, stringy lace stuck to the glass.  Smell: The nose isn't bad, but it isn't exactly an award winner. Toasted malts are the strongest component, at least in this department. Somehow they still manage to smell light. There's a faint hoppy scent that's encouraging. Smells grainy and earthy. That's about it. Not bad, but could use some work.  Taste: The flavor profile is nearly a carbon copy of the nose. Not such a great thing in this instance. Toasted malts are clearly the focal point. They have a nice taste, but aren't quite as prevalent (or tasty) as others in the style. Very light spices are present, but they're too insignificant to identify. Hops are noted, but they're faint. A little more would be a welcome addition. It's a little grainy and there's a very faint biscuity or yeasty taste on the tail. Finishes sweet.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and has a pretty smooth feel for its stature. Carbonation is light and really helps in that regard. Drinkability is good. If the flavor were a little better, it'd be great.  Octoberfest isn't a bad release from BBC. But, it's nowhere near one of my favorites. It's just a little too thin on flavor and doesn't have enough depth to carry the day. It's alright and well worth checking out. But, clearly BBC has much better on its resume.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,n811,4.13,"Poured into a pint glass revealing a beautifully amber drink with a nice head. Smelled of delicate hops and malty sweetness. Taste is more malty than the nose, with a very clean aftertaste. As things progress the hops begin to shine through. Head left a nice delicate lacing.  This is a go-to Oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,twiggamortis420,3.83,"Poured into a pilsner glass a crystal clear amber color. Fluffy tan head is pretty nice topping for this 'toberfest.  Sweet malty nose that has some heft to it. Mild floral hop presence is noticeable as well. This brew smells toasty, caramely and earthy.  Not quite as malt dominant as the nose indicates, much more balanced in the flavor. Toastiness throws in a bit more bitterness to help with the balance. Lots of flavor, but maintains a decently light body and feel to it. Not cloyingly sweet, like many American versions...it's pretty tasty and highly drinkable. Every beer drinking American should pick up a sixer of this each September.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It has a metallic sweet aroma with a little bit of a hoppy fruit smell. For an American style Marzen this is good. It has a roasty malt flavor at first with some metallic tones but not as bad as the aroma. It is a sweet beer for the most part but there some good hops in the flavor. The mouthfeel is a little slick with some carbonation. My only complaint is it being metallic.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Deingeist,3.98,"A - A beautiful dark copper color, perfect for the season. A nice tan had that lingers for a while and some nice lacing, most likely due to the sweetness.  S - Caramel, malty, a hint of hops. Not too strong though.  T - Malt dominates the flavor profile. Its starts with a heavy malt taste, then you can taste the hops closer to the finish although there aren't a ton. A little harsh on the finish but sweet throughout and overall very good.  M - Medium and smooth, I like it.  D - This is my fall beer. I love to try new Marzens, especially from other local brewers but I always keep falling back on this. I find it to be very drinkable, it's a medium bodied beer that doesn't fill me up too fast.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,yesyouam,3.42,"Samuel Adams Octoberfest is a sparkling, deep amber jewel of a beer with a loose, sandy head that quickly vanishes. A deep, leathery malt aroma is met with soft fruity hops and is faint in the nose. It is medium bodied, soft and syrupy with a soft carbonation. The finish is a little scratchy. Good balance. It's almost like an ESB. The roast malt blends with the bitter hops. The aftertaste is green like an unripe orange and some arbor vitae. There is a subtle sweetness that lies beneath it all. It's boozy toward the end of the taste. This is some serious swill! (rated Aug 28, 2007)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

And other than ticking off additional reviews there's not necessarily a lot to be gained from it... but this is a beer deserving of review and evaluation. It's pretty mild as a marzen... a pleasing caramel and light toast biscuit wrapped around a bit of noble hop goodness in a solid, medium body with a crisp finish. A purdy ruby tinged orange. Crystal clear. It gets looked over... but it's long been my favorite Sam seasonal... and while in LA there's hardly a fall, it's nice to sit back on one of the rare cool evenings and suck one of these back and imagine that we do.

Overall I bought this beer in September one of first shipments to Idaho. I have heard the that year I heard that it was a good American version of the Oktoberfest.

35,102,Pencible,3.71,"This poured a dark clear copper with tan head. It smelled like lime and pine hops with barley malt and a bit of sour yeast. It tasted like strong barley malt with some caramel and sweet yeast and lime hops. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very sweet beer with clean flavor and a decent body. It was fairly drinkable, but there was nothing too special about the beer, but nothing really wrong with it either.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Aroma is mostly sweet toasted malt with some floral hops.  Taste is better than the aroma. Plenty of sweet malt, caramel, malty biscuit, and some floral hops to finish. A bit of nuttiness also. Very nice and balanced taste. Feel is smooth with ample carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. It's a bit heavy, but still easy to drink. Just not something I could drink several of.  Overall, a pretty good beer. Another solid beer from Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ericmunley,4.23,"Sam Adams Octoberfest is second only to the Winter Lager as my favorite Sam seasonal offering. Best enjoyed on a chilly October or November day, Sam Adams Octoberfest's dark, amber hue and spicy aroma is a true sign that fall is here.  If your palette picks up the caramel, nutmeg and cinnamon notes, this can be a very complex, enjoyable beer. Mouth feel is chewy and hearty, yet surprisingly drinkable for a beer of it's weight.  I recommend Sam Adams fall seasonal to anyone, as it is one of the better Octoberfests I've had the pleasure of enjoying.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: It smelled of light toasted malts and hints of ripe tart cherries.  T: It was smooth and refreshing with a good balance of lightly toasted malts, hints of caramel and tart red cherries.  M: It was creamy and smooth on the tongue with modest carbonation. It finished surprisingly clean and with no aftertaste.

Good head, about two fingers with good retention until the end of the pint. S: Malty, no real hop scent, good for style, no skunk which is often the case with the German imports that may have been sitting on the shelf since the October last.

Pretty good balance, though overall flavor is pretty simple and watery. Meh...  Mouthfeel: Pretty chewy, light-medium bodied, average carbonation. Nothing special here.

A: Darker Amber colored with a nice fall hue to it.  S: Very malty with a hint of spices.  T: There certainly is a sweet malty taste to this brew. This years seems to bit a bit maltier and sweeter compared to last. Spices also kick in along with a bit of a hop finish to balance out this brew. Is this screaming fall or what???  M: Good mouthfeel. Somewhat heavier but not overbearing for the season. This is how autumn should feel AND taste!  D: Again like I said before this one holds a special place in my heart. I could drink many of these in a sitting or pair it with the right foods at dinner. I think thats why I rate this one so high. It tastes good, easy to drink, and I can pair it well with some many foods and deserts. It's almost a go to beer for me this time of year.

Good moderate malty aromas toasty and nutty with a pleasingly sweet fruity carmelled malt.  Clean taste upfront with a zippy tanginess has a complex malty tastes some toasty and nuttyness, no standouts a tad on the weak side with some dry fruitiness.

The taste reflects the bready malt with a twinge of smooth caramel in the finish.  The carbonation is a bit on the heavy side, but not oppressive. This brew goes down very smoothly and clings a bit from the heavy malt.  Overall this is a pleasant harvest brew that is very easy to drink and have several of.

The bitterness is masked nicely by the sweetness of the malts. This is one of the freshest Marzens that I can get, and in addition, probably partly due to freshness, it is one of the better oktoberfests. I have to give Sam Adams a big thumbs up on this one.

35,102,Gueuzedude,4.6,"Best By February 2009; Sampled October 2008 Pours with a frothy, two finger thick, lightly amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is quite clear and shows a full amber color as it sits on my desk. The aroma has some light spicy hop character to it up front, but this is quickly drowned out by a full malt character. Aromas of caramel, toasty grain and whole grain crackers. Actually there is a fair amount of hop character here that lightly spices the more dominant malt aromatics.  Spicy hop notes cut through the slightly more dominant malt character of lightly nutty, slightly toasty grain notes and a nice, almost rich, but not to sweet, caramelized malt note. As the beer warms up it becomes more malty and rich, but still retains its spicy hop character. Light toffee notes seem to subtly intrude into the mix of well integrated flavors that define this beer. I really am enjoying the body of this brew as well, it is quite quaffable, but has just enough heft to cling a bit to the palate and lightly envelope the mouth.  This is a nice Oktoberfest, I really like that it is still fresh and has a nice spicy hop character. I really also like how the toasted malt character accentuates a soft nutty note. Overall this is a really well constructed beer, incredibly well balanced between hop and malt. I would seriously have a hard time asking for more from an Oktoberfest (well an non-Rauch one anyway). This would be quite easy to quaff liters of this beer at a time.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,John_M,3.53,"On tap at the Detroit airport the other day.  The beer pours a mahogany copper color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose I get a hint of sweet malt and not much else. The simple flavors in this beer generally replicate the nose. There is some attractive roasty malt and light honey in this beer, but there really isn't very much flavor otherwise. The beer is somewhat watery, but there are no off flavors.  Pretty boring, but certainly not terrible.

35,102,tbeck,4.09,"Pours a reddish-brown but clear with a good, brown/white carbonated head. Has a sweet, malty smell that is not overpowering and a bit of hops. Taste was very well balance, primarily malty sweetness with cereal grains and a slight hop. Good texture, on the thin side but light and smooth. Not a heavy beer, so more than a couple is okay and it is very enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Very light hop presence. Quite malty, but not very sweet. Very malty, but not overly sweet flavors. Again, toasted bread, but the caramel/toffee flavors seem to come through more to create more sweetness than in the aroma. Light hop presence. Medium-light mouthfeel. The flavors wash off the palate rather quickly, but the beer is not watery at all. Good carbonation. Quite drinkable, as a good O-fest should be. Good, but inoffensive, flavors make this a drinker all day in the halls.

Delicious smells of caramel and toffee lead the nose, toasted malt and breadiness with an underlying herbal quality from the hops.  Toasty and bready malt flavor, light sweetness with the caramel and toffee again showing up, but not as expressed as in the nose. The finish is lightly bitter, herbal and with some earthiness. Nice, but not exceptional.  Light bodied, thin even, but smooth and sessionable with a nice level of carbonation. Could use a bit more substance.  A decently crafted brew that hits most of the style points for a traditional Oktoberfest. Drinks well, definitely wouldn't turn it down, but will go for a few better made fests if they are available to me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,SykDoc,3.58,"Purchased this beer and had it in a pint glass from a bottle. Beer initially poors with a 1/4-1/2 inch off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin film. The appearance is a pleasant clear copper. The aroma reminds of many lagers, having an expectedly malty scent with some caramel. There is a creamy feel to the beer which is generally medium bodied, but light and palatable. You can catch a bit of hops, as well as carbonation. Beyond that, this beer does seem to come up a bit flat overall. It is a good oktoberfest lager, but defintely could be better with a deeper flavor.

Two years ago the Octoberfest was great, last year's batch was crap, now the curent batch rate's in the category of decent.  It has the mezmorising golden-brown color that makes marzen's s appealing with a small amount of head. The aroma and taste show a small amount of caramel and nutmeg. It has a slight bitternes that other's of this style don't have. As for mouthfeel, it has a very slight chunkyness, as if the ingredients and the water didn't completely mix together, kinda hard to explain.  SA Oktoberfest is a hit-or-miss beer.

35,102,craytonic,3.33,"Pours clear light amber, mother-of-pearl head, some light lacing. It at least looks like fall.  Light malty sweet aroma, hint of herb.  Lots of malt & hops, faint hint of tea.

D: Light enough to drink a couple glasses.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,diabecktic,3.82,"Appearance: The beer's color is somewhere between a really dark copper tone and amber. A nice tan head forms quickly and then slowly dissapates; the lacing and retention are both adequate/decent. A small amount of rising carbonation is visible.  Smell: This is a malt-lover's dream. A very heavy, crisp biscuit aroma dominates, but it is complimented nicely by a small amount of spice - nutmeg, perhaps? It definately envokes the feeling of ""fall"" (whatever it is). Any hop-related smell is present in minimal amounts.  Taste: The beer's flavor matches its nose quite well. Biscuity tones dominate, though they're complimented with the spices and a hint of carmel-y sweetness. There isn't really a whole lot of bitterness on account of the lack of hop character. The spices definately ""make"" this beer. There isn't really an aftertaste, but the biscuit and spice flavors linger.  Mouthfeel: It feels quite heavy in the mouth - more of a creamy type heaviness instead of just high density. This may sound strange, but it makes sense to me; I suppose that I mean it's a ""tolerable"" heavy and not something that's just really hard to swallow. I suppose it's what I'd expect from a beer of this type.  Drinkability: This is something you definatley do NOT want to pound. Yes, I know it may be Oktoberfest, but it's best to enjoy this in moderation. If you drank it too quickly, you'd be missing out on the great flavor. The creaminess best augments my assertion of its drinkability.  Summary: As with most of the other Sam Adams brews, I am quite pleased. I always look forward to the time of year when this beer is on the shelf - definately a ""fall"" beer no matter how you spell it. I'm sure there are better brews of this variety out there, but it seems to me that Sam Adams does a good job of making it accessable to those who might not normally drink it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Ive had it about 5 times this year and discussed this with other fans and we agree the recipe has changed. As recent as last fall the lable had a comment something about being malty with ""hints of caramel and toffee"". Well I dont know what happend but those hints but they ar gone from the label and the bottle. This beer is moderatly full tasting in the mouth and very hoppy.

Taste: Starts like any Sam Adams until the beautiful taste kicks in, taste is very smooth and robust, not edgy and not weak, a perfect blend of spices make this Octoberfest stand out from the rest.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, almost to a cream consistency but it isn't.  Drinkability: Still to date one of the best Octobers around, hasn't changed in years and why should it?

The head dissipates rather quickly leaving a thin film coating.  S: The nose was soft, light caramel syrup with only the slightest hint of hops of nobel flowery origins.  T: Sweet and syrupy upon the opening sip. Maplesyrup, caramel appear in the forefront while a light noble flowering hop presence presents itself on the tongue upon the swallow. Hints of chocolate and munich appear ever so briefly upon warming on the close.  M: Light bodied, you hardly feel this at all resting on the tongue.

Has a tan one finger head which dissipates within a minute and leaves a little bit of lacing behind.  Smell: Has a bittersweet aroma, almost like a sourdough bread. Caramel and spice scents are in there as well, along with a little fruit, possibly dates or figs.  Taste: Starts off slightly bitter, then finishes with a mild sweetness. Can detect some toastiness in there, with sort of a bready taste. Interesting spice combination in there as well. Overall pretty refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with a very good consistancy that is just the right texture. Has a carobonated feel after a second of two, which gives it kind of a fizz. Aftertaste is a mild sweetness on the palate, and feels a little filmy.  Drinkability: Very good Octoberfest beer that I would certainly buy again.

Like a malted caramel. Mouthfeel: Goes down very easy - like water...with hops, yeast, malt, barley and likely a couple other grains. Light carbonation.  Imagine the surprise Sam Adams had after InBev bought Anheuser-Bush, and they, Sam Adams (an American Craft Brewery) were now the largest American owned brewery in the states! Pretty cool, eh? Okay - about the beer. Wasn't bad at all, and somewhat traditional for an Octoberfest Ale. Wanna learn more about that? Click here. Kinda sweet, not too hoppy - more malty.

Moderate carbonation. Mild but bitter after taste.  M: Smooth with a slight grain.  D: Light enough to have more than one. Very enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,pwsoldier,3.83,"A - Pours a clear copper with a large, creamy, off-white head. Good head retention and patchy lacing.  S - Caramel, buttered toast, and some very faint grassy notes.  T - Caramel and buttered toast persist, with some spice adding some subtle complexity to it. A hint of lemon is also present in the finish.  M - Medium-bodied, dry finish. Carbonation does a good job of keeping the sweetness in check.  D - Very smooth and enjoyable. I'm not a huge fan of Marzens, but I like this one a lot.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,superdedooperboy,3.9,"The sixteenth and final day of the München Oktoberfest has me finishing off the celebration with the bottled variant of Boston Beer Co.'s Samuel Adams seasonal.  Poured into a pint glass from a brown glass bottle with freshness date printed on the label.  Pours a deep copper-amber hue with a half-finger of light tan foam.  Nose is full of sweet toffee and chocolate notes. No discernible hop presence.  Full-bodied, thick and chewy on the palate. Flavors are of rich malted grain -- sweet caramel, milk chocolate, and molasses. A slight bitterness from the hops can be detected, though the malts are what are truly highlighted, with the hops serving as a simple balance to keep the beer from becoming cloying. Finishes with a lingering sweetness.  Absolutely delicious, though it strikes me as almost a lower-alcohol version of a good Doppelbock, rather than an Oktoberfest/Märzen. Very sweet and therefore not highly drinkable, and much different than the draft version, but still a highly individualistic interpretation of the style and a wonderful way to complete the sixteen days of Oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Jwale73,4,"12oz. bottle served in my Harpoon Octoberfest mug. Best by February notched on the label. Poured a translucent copper with a one inch off-white cap dimpled with tiny bubbles. Head eventually dissipated into a soapy swirl. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose is caramel malt and cereal grains. Taste follows nose with a little hops in the mix. Finish is not as sweet, and much dryer than most Oktoberfests. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and evenly carbonated. Easy drinking and one of my personal favorites for the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,tangentrider,3.48,A- dark copper beer with an off-white head; some lacing is present; minimal carbonation visible.  S- biscuit with a slight bit of cheese  T- a bit of toasted malt sweetness; faint bit of herbal hop; finishes with a light bitterness and yeast.  MF- light feel with moderate to high carbonation in the mouth. Clean.  D- Good beer for a spicy meal. I would have this again.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,philipquarles,3.53,"Pours a clear red/amber with few bubbles and a medium white head. This dissipates to leave a slight film. Minimal lacing.  Smells of sweet malt and some caramel. This was very indicative of the taste, though a bit of roasted character comes out, as well as some hops. Well balanced.  Overall, a good, quite drinkable domestic take on the festbier.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,motleybrew,3.81,"Clear, sparkling amber makes for a wonderful inexpensive fall imbibe. Had it not the hints of cheapness that come with a typical consumer beer, it could be so much more. But considering those limitations, it is quite a bit more drinkable than your usual big-name beer. It feels every bit a malty brew, though it regretfully lacks the full aroma of one. The stale, bready smell of the common inflicts itself and ruins the sense of the scent that lingers there.  Something creeps into the flavor as well. Though the initial mouth feel is overwhelmingly and pleasingly malty, smooth, and pleasant, the late twinge of lemony hops could be destined to be a choice in finish...but comes off almost tart. I am one that will not complain about a sticky, malty beer being sticky and malty...and this one seems to want to apologize. In the backlash it comes off citrus, and a little underage. That will be an inherent problem with a beer produced in this volume.  All that said, I could drink this all day. That, I think, is the best part of this bottle: you can't complain that it isn't tasty the first or fifth time in the day. When it is available, it is a low cost joy.  Worth a try, and a weekend.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,PatrickJR,3.88,"Had this on tap in a Sam Adam's pint glass.  A - Clear, deep amber with a finger or two of white head. Retention is decent with some lacing.  S - Vague sweetness; some dark bread in there a long with a slightly nutty aroma.  T - Sweet and a little buttery. A nice toasted malt overtone. Some dark bread from the nose as well, with a hint of spicy hops creeping up in the background.  M - Medium bodied, medium carbonation.  D - An easy drinking beer. Decent flavor but certainly not too much to think about at the bar.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste: Malty like the style should be. Caramel with a slight slight hint of hops. Excellent rendition of the style.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is well balanced.

35,102,Slynger,3.31,"Nice clear oranged amber color with a cap of finely bubbled dirty white.  Light nose of mostly toasted and caramel, with a hint of fruits and a dash of spice.  Flavors of toasted, biscuity malts with a caramel/darkish fruit sweetness and some lightly musty, nutty, earthy-floral hops. The body is a touch watery of medium, with a modest amount of fine, fizzy carbonation.  Not bad. A mediocre, widely available, american version of the style. Fortunately I have access to some better regional offerings, namely Great Lakes.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,generallee,4.33,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a dimpled mug.  Appearance: It has a dark amber color with good clarity. The head is light tan in color, creamy and about average in size. It has good retention as it slowly fades to light covering that hangs on until the last sip.  Smell: The aroma is full of all the sweet caramel-like malt that you would expect along with some decent mineral/herbal hops.  Taste/Mouth feel: Its flavor has solid, sweet and bready malt with caramel notes and hints of apple-like fruitiness. Hop flavor comes in and adds a good spicy and herbal presence to the middle and finish. It finishes slowly and has a slick texture with good carbonation and a medium to full body.  Notes: Football, Halloween candy, and sucking down some Sam Adams Octoberfest with my father, these are a few of my favorite things.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,oriolesfan4,3.76,The best part about this beer is the appearance and the smell. I bought a bunch of octoberfest beers lately and this was better than most of them but outshined by a good amount too. Very malty with some fall spices thrown in but I found it just decent in drinkability and taste. Maybe this style just doesn't sit well with me?,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,NHGrafx,3.7,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle.  Pours a very clean dark amber color, 2 finger head that dissipates down to a thin layer of bubbles and foam after a minute. This one makes some nice lacing too.  The aroma has a light sweetness to it. Hints of caramel and malts with a light hop aroma.  The taste is mainly malts. There is a nice spiciness to it as well which makes my tongue tingle a bit. I can detect very slight hints of a caramel like flavor as too. The hop flavor seems pretty light to me, but it is there. Semi bitter on the finish. Carbonation seems moderate, good mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good too.  Overall a pretty nice seasonal offering from Sam Adams, of the 4 this one has always been my favorite.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Smixam,4.11,"On tap, pint glass.  A - Almost as good as a beer can look. Rich, clear brown body with a tan 1-2 finger head. Very inviting.  S - If there's a weak point for this beer, I guess it has to be this. Not that it's bad, just nothing special - Malty and earthy, very typical of Octoberfest brews.  T - Solid malt profile, very rich but not overpowering. Very subtle alcohol content lets you really taste this brew. Small amount of hops simply to balance the malt, and a very earthy finish. Aftertaste isn't great, but isn't strong either - think 'brown ale,' and that's it. If you can 'taste' fall, this is it.  M - Solid throughout, this one hangs around for a bit after you drink it. Nothing bitter or heavy about it though, just a nice nutty/oak finish, much like a brown ale.  D - Again, can't tell the alcohol content with this one. Nothing keeping you from drinking this beer all afternoon - it's fine alone and can be paired with almost anything - chips, burgers, steaks, chicken - you name it, it'll work.  The best of the seasonal brews from Mr. Adams, by far.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,whiteangel1238,4.26,"Went to Philly Beer Fests' Octoberfest last weekend. Out of all of them(Spaten, Paulaner, Otter Creek, Spaten, Hacker, Weyerbacher, etc.), this was the best. I guess particularly, this year's batch. It changes each year.  Robust Malty taste, but not too sweet. Level of carbonation staying power is very nice, for a malty Octoberfest. Nice bite to it. As opposed to a Spaten Octoberfest which is a brew that gets syrupy when room temp.  It's Appearance exactly what you look for in an Octoberfest- a nice dark orange, head lingers for about 10 minutes.  I can drink about 4 or 5, then Im full. This beer is probably close to 250 calories a bottle.  Great with bratwurst dishes in autumn",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,sethmeister,3.47,Bottle marked best before June 09.  Clear bubbly luminous amber with a large cream colored head which drops to a film quickly. Very attractive.  Scent unfortunately is hard to detect. All I get is a faint grassy odor.  Taste is caramel and toffee balanced with a slight hop bitterness. Diacetyl and perhaps a hint of toast. A slight peppery flavor in the finish.  Mouthfeel is crisp and nicely carbonated up front becoming round and creamy.  Not the best Oktoberfest around but certainly not bad and I did enjoy drinking it.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,shadow1961,3.58,"Samuel Adams Octoberfest pours two good fingers of loose foam over a clear amber brew. There's almost no carbonation in this sample, and the nose is mild toasty malts and a bit of herbal hop. The flavor is sweetish up front- with notes of butterscotch lightly balanced by some mildly peppery hops off the back. Mouthfeel is pretty round for a lager but by no means heavy. Ofests are supposed to be pretty easy drinking and this one certainly fits the bill. This particular one doesn't blow me away but it gets the job done.

Nose was weak due to no head. Some malt and hops.  Taste was very drinkable and loaded with nice roasted malts and hops and some caramel behind that.

Tons of visible carbonation  S: Bready and mildly spicy with a hint of hops; mildly citrus like. Solid!  T: Starts off rich and malty with wonderful caramel sweetness to go with the bready character. There's a hint of a pepper-like spice that, while uncommon for style, works really well here.

S Very malty, moderate smell with some hops detectable. A very smooth smell.  T Malts dominate with some hops (much like the nose).  M Very smooth, moderately full.  D Just fine but nothing that gets me too excited.  Notes: This struck me as a very ""safe"" brew from Sam Adams but unfortunately for me a little bit boring.

35,102,DeepSix,3.38,"Poured into a pint glass. Started with a nice head that stayed around for a little while. A light amber color with carbonation visible. Slight lacing visible.  I really don't smell much here, maybe a touch of malt, but was kinda disappointed here.  Tastes pretty watery actually for this dark of a beer, some minor sweetness visible, along with malt, no hops to speak of. Light mouthfeel, thought I'd get something thicker, but given the watery taste I can't say I was surprised. The carbonation was fairly light given that I saw in the body.  I guess not a terrible seasoning offering, I don't really like their 2 warmer months ones, so eh. I remember this tasting a lot better on the taster I had the other week, maybe this one of those beer that you have to drink on tap or this just a bad six pack, I'm sure I'll have it again at some point",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I tried it again, pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  I must have just gotten a bad pint on draft, because this one was much better out of the bottle. A nice copperish color with a creamy head... nutty, malty aroma, and a taste that stays the same. A hint of fruit and a little bit sweet, a very nice balance of the flavors.

Very good toasty bread notes and these flavors remain in the finish. Finish is almost a dry toast taste.  Medium body, limited carbonation in this draft glass.  You can put a few down.

I'm not sure if it is a difference in the bottled version but in the past I always remember a sour aftertaste. The Octoberfest I had on tap last night did not display the same characteristics. In fact it was quite enjoyable. It pours a nice dark copper, the head had dissapated by the time the beer was brought to my table. The taste is very grainy, but enjoyable. I would probably try it again on tap if not just to confirm that my previous recollection of the beer was incorrect.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I try at least a couple SA Octoberfest's each year. I remembered it being malty and sweet. That it was but with no discernable hop flavor and very little nuance. It was bordering on bland. It smells malty/grainy and sweet but the smell is faint.  It would be easy to drink a few of these but I doubt I will. The flavor and complexity of this beer doesn't match the Sam Adams price tag. I'd rather drink a Yuengling or a Shiner Bock.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Arsenal82,3.42,"This beer poured an amber/copper color with little to no head and very little lacing. Very little carbonation. The smell was of caramel, orange peel. Hops were present to balance out the malts. It went down smooth, but a bit watered down. A little carbonation feel on the tongue and with a bitter aftertaste.

The initial pour consists of a thick and foamy gusher, which settles into a frothy head of cream atop a dark copper body. There is a profusion of carbonation bubbles within the glass and moderate lacing around it.  The nose will initially detect some sweet notes of butter; the palate discerns a subtle raisin flavor that is supplemented by a quick nip of alcohol - and isn't this why we drink beer? The mouthfeel boasts a toasty maltiness without any bitterness.

The aroma is nice and robust - malty, biscuity, with some floral hops in there somewhere. The flavor is malty and rich, particularly for a beer that pours so clear. There is some spice from the hops, a slightly gingerbready character from the malt. The mouthfeel is solid and chewy, a satisfying beer with a small bite of carbonation.

D: this is a fairly drinkable beer, but not one of my favorite styles. pretty mellow, smooth, and easy drinking though. all in all not too bad. i'd pour a few of these down if on a night out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ljbrisson,3.38,"Hard pour into my new unmarked goblet reveals a dark copper, opaque body. A thin head reduces to a filmy cap which sticks a little to the inside of the glass. Aroma is of fruit mainly, with a little malt, and a vague notion of clove. Mouthfeel is decent for a lager, with good carbonation and a little depth. Taste is like the nose, a touch of clove, wood, vanilla, and a very weak attempt at spice. Aftertaste smacks of alcohol and a very mild hop character. As a lager I like this very much, but as a seasonal, there are many better ones out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,thekevlarkid,3.7,"Off the tap this beer was a bright orange-amber color like pumpkin paste, good clarity with an off-white head. Mediocre retention but decent lacing. Malty and slightly musty aromas with hints of sweetness lurking. The taste was mostly sweet malts, caramel in particular, earthy and taut flavors like a vitamin. Dry and bitter finish is slightly metallic. Medium body and semi-smooth but nothing stellar.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,tpd975,3.36,"A: Nice golden copper hue with a nice tall head when poured from the tap. Good retention and lots of bubbles. A smattering of lace is left behind. A touch of alcohol could be detected.  S: Big malty aroma with hints of caramel.  T: Nice big biscuity malty taste with a hint of caramel sweetness. There is a dash of bittering hops as well to provide nice balance.  M: Medium in body, fairly smooth.  D: A nice change of pace Octoberfest brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,phantomwyse,3.46,"A: Golden orange with a yellow/tan 1-finger head with carbonation moving throughout at varying paces.  S: Light malts all around, little sweetness, vague fruitiness.  T: Earthy and caramel malts, cookie-like breadyness with a disgustingly light hoppiness in the background.  M: Lighter bodied, dryish but palatable.  D: As with most Marzens, highly drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,IBUnit63,3.58,"Poured an excellent, rustic amber color. On draft, so nothing more than a thin wispy head.  Aroma is very clean and malt-dominant with a little hop pine and...what's that...some spice? Really?  There's that spice again-a little clovish but surprisingly hearty. Decent amber malt base - maybe a little hop pine but not a whole lot.  Very clean on the palate with a full woody finish. Little aftertaste. Stands up with warmth.  One of the more pleasing BBC offerings to me. Packs a little more weight than I'm used to for the mild flavor profile but it's definitely an enjoyable sessioner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,dananabanana,3.69,"A: orange-red color. Decent head, for a lighter beer.  S: Sweet and malty, but not very strong.  T: Lots of that sweet malt again, on the tip of the tongue. The perfect amount of hops-- not too much, well-balanced. Develops a nutty taste after awhile.  M: Smooth and creamy. Good mix of carbonation.  D: I could definitely drink this all night. This is the one Sam Seasonal I really miss when it isn't being sold.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,daythree16,3.65,"Poured into a pint glass. Nice copper color with a creamy one-finger head that fades pretty quickly.  Smell is caramel, a little toasted malt, and some grain husk. Taste is sweet, but well balanced with some German hop bitterness on the finish. Straight forward and pretty good  Medium bodied with great drinkability. Would definitely make for a great session lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Wetpaperbag,3.2,"A- Clear copper color. Head is a tight big toe width head that is fading quickly.  S- I smell some malty goodness, with a little dark fruit smell that has been coated in a gooey caramel jacket. Smells tasty.  T- The taste is a bit flat, there is a good amount of malt, but that fruityness is not there, and the caramel is not present in the taste either like it was in the smell.  M- Very thin feeling, and there is almost no carbination, which isn't too bad, but a little more would be nice.  D- Easy to drink if you want to drink something quickly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,HoppyMcStout,3.18,"This brew was a reddish-amber color. The head was decent. The smell was somewhat fruity, but nothing overpowering. The taste was a little bland to me. Nothing that stood out and spoke to me, but I don't usually care for Oktoberfests anyway. The finish had this lagery presence that came out of no where and that didn't suit me well. Meh.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BlackBearForge,4,"Pours a very nice deep amber with coppery highlights, crystal clear with a nice thick creamy off white head leaving some oily lacing.  Smell is nice, of bready malts and perhaps some caramel sweetness.  Taste is all about the malt, sweet up front with a touch of bitter on the finish. Some caramel overtones and a touch of sour on the palate. Hops appropriately take the back stage. Warming mellows it out nicely.  Mouthfeel is light bodied and perhaps a bit over carbonated on the tongue. It is nicely crisp.  Very drinkable and with the change of seasons in the air a nice change from the IPAs and pale ales I've been drinking all summer. Perhaps not the best of the Fest beers but enjoyable nonetheless.  Edit: I've had a chance to drink several six packs of this brew this season and my appraisal of it is higher than it was initially, I've been enjoying it very much!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: Sweet caramel malt and some dark fruit tastes. Some astringent spices.  T: Big, slightly sweet malts up front. Slightly hot finish.  M: Medium body. Might be a little light on the carbonation.

35,102,cbn,3.07,"Nice clarity, beautiful bright copper color, large head induced by vigorous pour retreats to thin off-white cap.  Light malty aroma with a dry soapy end note.  Sweet carmel malt with lemony bitterness and a cornbread end-note.  Carbonation gives a soft bite to the tongue, otherwise smooth and clean, with a medium to light body.  Easy drinker although fairly pedestrian. Not a bad beer, nothing to write home about.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,EnojysAnyBeer,4.1,A good Sam Adams that captures the style is is going for quite well.  A- Dark red-orange-brown that looks like the color most leaves change to in Autumn. Very clear  S- Smell is of caramel and sweet rolls  T- Taste is like the smell but the hops become noticeable with a bitter citrus pinch on the tongue  M- Feel is light with a slight feel of syrup.

35,102,Chugmonkey,3.48,"Light amber color with nice off white rocky head, great retention. Seems to have a malty aroma, is that possible? Taste is really malty sweet, some caramel, little nuttiness, but mostly sweet.  It has a thick mouthfeel to me and it finishes very sweet wich severely reduces drinkability for me. I like one, but more than that and the sweetness builds to a level of annoyance with me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,stephens101,3.91,"Ahh more Oktoberfest brew and I'm on a Sam Adams kick of late to boot. Pours pure copper into the SA specialty glass. A big fluffy off-white head peaks a few cm above the rim and fades very slowly, leaving a scattering of rocky lacing behind. Smells of malts, caramel, and a bit of tea. Tastes sweet with just enough bitterness to keep it from being boring. Goes down smooth with a light-to medium mouth-feel. I'm really digging this one for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Hoagie1973,3.7,"Deep copper color with a medium buttery tan head. Smells very malty with caramel and a slight hop presence. Taste is similar to the nose. Sweet caramel malts dominate for the most part, but there is some hop character to keep things a bit balanced. There's a strong earthy, grassy flavor that I'm not sure comes from the malts or the hops. Feel is crisp with a medium to fullish body. Seems to me this used to be a lot tastier. It was a seasonal I always looked forward to. Now I can pretty much take it or leave it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ColForbinBC,3.6,"On tap at a local pub  Appears a dark amber with orange highlights around the edges with a tight, cream colored cap. No retention or lacing.  Sweet, bready malts and caramel. Not much else here.  Taste mimics the mose. Sweet caramel balanced by some bittering hops. Crisp and smooth.  Carbonation is where it should be, more on the thin side.  Pretty easy to session. A solid offering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Goliath,3.23,"Pours a rich, clear, amber color with a thin white head. Decent retention.  Aroma is ok. A bit of really subtle citrus, with some caramel sweetness as well.  The taste is ok. Again, very subtle citrus with some caramel and bread. A bit sweet for my tastes, and this one generally gives me a headache. It's not a terrible beer though.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation tingle.  Drinkability is moderate. This one is sessionable, and decently flavored etc. Not my beer of choice, but it works in a pinch.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mothman,3.75,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Date says best before Febraury. Pours a small head that fizzed down quickly. Very little lacy noticed.  Color was an orange amber. I could taste roasted malts, but little hop flavor going on here. This was an easy beer to drink and definately another great from the BBC.  I will definately be picking up some more of this before the season is over.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Zadok,3.4,Poured a crystal clear amber with minimal head and no lacing.  Smells of swwet malts and light hops.  Light malt flavor with mild hops and a slight musty flavor.  Smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation.  Another good session beer from Sam Adams. Not the one I would choose but still a decent option.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,KarlHungus,3.75,"This beer pours a copper color with amber hues. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of toasty and caramel malts with only a hint of hops. The taste is a more intense version of the aroma. It is very malty without being overly sweet. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Oktoberfest that I could drink again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,GreenThumb,3.46,I poured this from the bottle into a pilsner glass and got a very tasty looking beer.  I don't think this is a typical Sam Adams because I actually like it.  The flavor is nutty with plenty of good malty caramel tones and a good crisp mouthfeel. I could drink several. It is not a heavy beer but has good flavors. The color is definately an autumn color; reddish orange. The head pours a creamy off-white and disappears quickly to leave soapy residue on the side of the glass.  The aftertaste is distinctly nutty and malty. Not a bad one for a beer from the Bostonian Brewery.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,OverToad,4.63,"Fall and winter are my favorite for beer drinking and I love Sam Adams seasonal brews. I already have stocked up on the 12 oz Octoberfest bottles. I was at my local Chili's and they had the Samuel Adams Octoberfest on-tap. Let me say this beer on-tap is fantastic.  Color: Was a nice copper color with a nice one inch head.  Smell: The smell was of malt and caramel scents are picked up.  Taste: Very smooth malt flavors of caramel, bread, and something sweet with just a tad of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Was full of body and with a clean taste.  Drinkability: I had two of these that night and could have went for more. A very good beer to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,techtatu,4.33,"Nice caramel color and not much head. The smell was just overall pleasant. The taste was surprisingly good for what I call a main stream beer.

35,102,FtownThrowDown,3.57,"Pours a orangish brown in color with no head. Smell is very malty. Lots of caramel in the flavor.

Very enjoyable and drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,eweneek83,3.64,"Appearance - This one pours a penny copper colour, lots of bubbles in the body, a good sized head that sticks around for a while (which is good)  Smell - This one smells like a mix between their Boston lager and toasted breadcrust, a little malt also.  Taste - tastes a lot like the Boston lager too, a bit more body. The malts are balanced really well and not too overpowering. I simple, clean, decent taste.  Mouthfeel - This beer doesn't linger long but the mouthfeel is good. It feels thin to me, but I've been drinking motor-oil like stouts lately. The buttery toasty aftertase comes in for a 2nd showing quickly then goes away.  Drinkability - Great. These are dark enough to not suck, and carbonated great, plus the creamy head mixed with the lager drinkability makes this one good.

35,102,popery,3.06,"This beer looked better than it tasted. I only had one, but there was a definite off-note, a toned down version of what I associate with the big macrobrews brewed with corn and such. That is to say, this beer is better than those beers but it has a slightly skunked aftertaste despite being properly handled and consumed soon after purchase. I often dislike Oktoberfests, so maybe I just have odd taste. I did use it to swallow a vitamin (I imagine my mother shuddered for no apparent reason when that happened), but that wasn't until three quarters through the glass. The carbonation is pleasant and the beer has a good dryness, but I'm put off by the off note. That sounded a bit repetitive. With the help of BA, I'm seriously cutting my teeth as a beer snob.

T - Very smooth malt flavors of caramel, bread, and something sweet that I can't put my finger on..  M - very herbal feel with enough hops presence to be wonderfully balanced. not thin but not syrupy by any stretch.  D - Excellent introduction to SA's seasonal brews. I'll be coming back for it again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cswhitehorse,3.63,The Octoberfest poured an amber color with a good 1-2 finger foam head that was quick in disappearing. It had some tight bubble lacing on the sides of the glass.  The aroma was definitely malty all the way up the nose. It had some baked bread and caramel smells. The taste was smooth and full bodied. It had a sweet finish with a light hop balance on the way out. Overall a very enjoyable Fall brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell: Slightly bread-ish, roasted nuts. Taste: Caramel, chocolate, a faint hint of roasted malt, topped off with a kiss of hops on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel: Decent, not too thin. Nice and smooth. Drinkability: It went down very well, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. This brew was my introduction into Sam Adams seasonals several years ago. And it remains my favorite.

Smells of malts, grains, caramel, noble hop spiciness. Taste is of doughy malts, caramel, noble hops, earthy, delectable! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, perfect carbonation, and crisp finish. Ridiculously drinkable. The best Octoberfest I have had so far this year and the best Octoberfest release I have had from Samuel Adams yet as well.

Smell is pretty mild and hard to detect for me right now....but after coming in temperature there were lovely fruit tones, esters, hops and cherry.  Taste is sweet and malty with less emphasis on the hops at first but a bit of bitterness rings through at the end to balance the flavor well.  Mouthfeel is heavy with soft carbonation with a long yet pleasant finish.  Not the best beer ever but a very good marzen.

S: Great smell of malt and some hop, reminds me of something off the bat. Cant put my finger on it...New Castle Nut Brown, that was it.  T: A whole lot of talk on malt, malt, malt, but I taste water, and then some malt as the alcohol warms very faintly. The hops come through it seems on the after taste. NOT BAD...  M: Great on the tongue, carbonation seems perfect for this Marzen. Spreads evenly, a bit dry for what I was expecting for the so called malt-deity of oktoberfests.

T - Bold and sweet caramel malt, bread, molasses, a kiss of bittering hops on the swallow to balance out an otherwise sweet, grainy finish  M - Medium-bodied and creamy with modest carbonation. Quite smooth and a tad warming.  D - Very easy drinking with solid flavor and mouthfeel.  I'm sure this doesn't stand up to some of the marzens from Germany, but it's pretty darn good.

Smells like beer should smell with a slight amount of grain.  Tastes better than I expected. I am usually not a big fan of Sam Adams but this is very nice. Noticable malt and caramel flavors come through. Almost no bitterness. Finishes very nicely provoking another drink.  Smoothe and fairly light.  Very drinkable, I am about half way through the six pack and it has been very consistant. Its good but not really growing on me any more than the first impression.

S - While the aroma is rather subdued, I do pick up on some bready and caramel malt, molasses, maple syrup and some spices. No hop presence at all.  T - Pleasant malt flavor with hints of sugar cookies, molasses, brown sugar, caramel and bready malt goodness. For some reason, I also get ginger snaps from this. Overall, this has a very sweet, malty flavor with vitually no hop bitterness whatsoever.  M - Medium body with lively carbonation and, although somewhat chewy, a mild syrupy texture that borders watery territory. Quite sweet on the tastebuds with no residual bitterness present.  D - Superior drinkability, but overall a really simple style. Sam Adams pretty much hits the mark with this one. Is it any wonder why this is one of the more popular fall seasonals in the world of craft beer?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BirdFlu,3.47,"Served in bottle at Earle of Sandwich @ Downtown Disney, Orlando, FL  My favorite thing about this beer is it's appearance. It has such a perfect color for autumn that it's sight alone makes you feel like its cooling down outside. A great dead-leaf orange. The flavor has a bit of hop detectable in what is largely a big, dark, malty flavor. This isn't to say that it's a strong malt characteristic the way that, say.. a dopplebock is. It is a warm flavor, though. The nose is lacking. You smell some sweetness, but not much. There is a bit of hop there, but, again, not much and you sort of have to know how to look for it. Too bad it can't smell like burning leaves. Mouth and body is nice, it's moderate and a bit full. The gravity has a middle ground. Fullness of the mouth makes it a bit filling (especially if drank while eating). The high gravity to it also adds to this. It does have a nice flavor though and is fitting for the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The nose of this beer is outstanding...very sweet pumpkin and spice.

I usually drink it up and progress to the German examples of this fantastic style, promising myself once again I'm attending the Munichfest next year. Then another year rolls by.

S: Definite breadiness on the nose which is tinge of spice and alcohol apparent as well.  T & M: So far I have been underwhelmed with marzen style in regards to the examples I've had thus far with Ocotberfest brews coming out. I felt quite different about this brew. The mouthfeel is substantial, no watery texture apparent. The carbonation does not overwhelm either. Taste is what I would expect a marzen to be like.

When held to the light, it is a perfect example of amber. The head is slightly off white and I got about 2 fingers on the pour. Retention is poor. Lacing is minimal. Not bad to look at.  S: Smell is mostly malt. Very sweet malt with some caramel hints. There is also a herbal tinge to the brew. I can't quite place it, but the herb is on the back end of the nose.  T: This brew is pretty sweet. The malt is very there, not very roasted. Just sweet malt. Caramel is there also to add to the sweetness. There is a breadiness to this brew that tries to counter balance the sweetness. Once again, an herbal/medicinal flavor comes in the back side of the flavor profile.  M: This is a light bodied brew that goes down pretty easily. Crisp and clean. Very little aftertaste, and that which is there is a malty aftertaste. This could be thicker. Don't get me wrong, it is closer to medium than a normal light bodied brew.  D: This beer is very drinkable because of its body. It is sweet, but not sickeningly sweet.

35,102,brewmudgeon,3.38,"9/2010 the key truly is in not drinking this one fast. it doesn't help the aroma, but the flavor reveals itself to be quite good when you take your time and savor it. also, there is a slickness to the mouthfeel that's pleasing, though the carbonation must still be ducked and dodged to get to it. overall, though, i am definitely liking this more these days than the boston lager (which is striking me as too harsh around the edges).  8/2010 misplaced my review, but the overall score from last year is about right. the watery mouthfeel was again noted, the boringness, smelled and tasted quite a bit like an AB version of an amber ale, like American Ale. the lingering finish of mildly toasted caramel is practically the only aspect that merits attention. the usual sweet caramel seems missing for the most part. given my relatively newfound respect for and enjoyment of the boston lager, i hoped this one would start a similar ascension. according to the next bottle, sipping is actually the key to enjoyment this year, which is fine but perhaps not really in keeping with the oktoberfest spirit. taste is about a 4-4.5 when sipped.  2009 3.5-4 totally clear ruddy amber 2 finger head looks tight at first but drops quickly to ring, leaving spotty, transient lace. 3-3.5 sweet caramel malts, basement (slight skunk), grassy hops. not so unpleasant as it sounds and after a bit the basement goes away. 3.5 sweetness, toasted malts, some nuttiness. a surprising touch of unmasked alc. about a 3.75. 3 watery mouthfeel, a little low in carb. the watery demeanor is the beer's weakest point. 3.5-4 based on 1 bottle this time around, liking better than last year. but i don't recall it being so watery. what i imagine a michelob oktoberfest would be.  2008 3 color is a decent light amber with shades of pumpkin, but the head drops without a trace. no lace at all. (UPDATE: another bottle poured very aggressively managed to leave a cap with some lingering lace) 3 smell is of the malt typical for the style. nothing special. and not even vigorous enough to mask the alcohol scent. 3 despite this having just arrived on the store shelf, the taste isn't particularly fresh. one-dimensional blandness, but tolerable. a bit 3.5 syrupy around the edges and an odd but slight metallic quality. 3.5 with all the really good oktoberfests out there to guzzle, no reason to seek out this one. but if it's all that's available, it'll do.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Well, well. I didn't know either of those factoids, and now feel smarter.  So, this bottle, poured into a shaker pint glass yields a clear pale copper body with scads of active carbonation feeding a sturdy light tan head. The foam rests at a thick sheet that leaves chubby swatches of lacing on the glass.  The smell of the drink is malty with a touch of fruit and a bit of fresh molasses.  The taste is toasty with a warm toffee background and a touch of dry, biscuity malt drizzled with silky sweet caramel in the finish.

Appearance is amber in color with a foam head that dissipates rather quickly. Bubbles from the bottom continue to rise, however. There is no lace to speak of as I continue to drink it.  When I initially poured, the scent was slightly sharp but as it has warmed, the smell is sweet to me, of caramel malt and a slight floral aroma I cannot quite place.  The taste, to me, is nothing extraordinary. There is a sweetness to it that is reminiscent of caramel, followed by the tang of hops. The aftertaste is not unpleasant, but it does, to me at least, have a slight sourness to it.  There is a nice carbonated mouthfeel that you might expect from a lager. It is not too heavy and also not too light. The carbonation has grown less as I drink it, but even near the end there is carbonation to speak of.  This is a drinkable beer, if unremarkable. I cannot say that I would go out of my way to order this at a restaurant or bar, but I would get it again if an establishment had nothing else that I liked, or to sample it with some good German food such as brats and sauerkraut.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The taste is very balanced and mild--not too sweet, not too hoppy, but it does have flavor. Mildly bitter on the finish, virtually no aftertaste.  Overall, not my favorite Octoberfest beer, but a great one to use to introduce friends to the style.

35,102,Domingo,3.73,"As usual, this is one of the first Oktoberfest beers available each year. This one appeared in mid August, which is just fine with me! Pours a VERY bright blood orange color. It's clear and clean, with a huge fluffy head just like the Bavarian originals. Smells like Autumn should. Sweet grain, gingerbread, candy corn, and a little bit of a spicy note that likely comes from the hops. Starts off sweet, but finished a little drier than you might expect. It's still a very sweet brew, but it's not quite overwhelming or cloying. Unlike most of the imports, the hops are getting a little lost in all of that malt overload. They save it from ""too sweet"" territory, but they don't play much of an other role. I'd like to see some more balance and the sweetness toned down a tiny bit. Mouthfeel is authentic and there's no real heat to keep this from being sessionable. That sweetness is really the only thing keeping me from downing 2-3 at a time. If you like your beers to be sweet and malty, this one's up there for sure. I wish it had a little more of the hops that the German versions have, but it's still quite good. One nice thing is that you know it's fresh. I'd take a fresh SA over a dusty import from 11 months ago any day.  Edit: In the last two years I've noticed a pretty distinct buttery malt flavor that really seems out of place with the style. That's been the case in both draft and bottled versions from 2008 and 2009. I'd say that I don't like this as much as I used to as a result.

Head slowly falls back into beer, leaving a think covering over beer, light lacing. Nice looking pint.  Smell is of light malts, some fruity esters, gentle hops, and a thin, watery grain flavor lingering in the background. Overall, very simple.  Taste is surprising balanced as the beer hits the palate: gentle roasted malts intermingle with plenty of maltiness and some rich grape/raisin flavors, balanced out nicely with some spicy hops. Rich carbonation guides the beer down a leaves a nice tingling, sweet malts and some spicy hop notes creep through on the finish and linger for a second. As those fade out, a thin/watery grain profile comes through, somewhat similar to corn/rice? What? Definitly don't remember this in previous years brews.  Mouthfeel is very nice, actually. Body is nice and thick, almost sticky/creamy that is balanced out nicely by a good amount of carbonation that lets the brew roll around the mouth.  Drinkability is nice, a great tasting beer that is widely available. Very easy to put back.  This is my favorite seasonal beer from SA, and is a close second overall from what they have to offer (after the cream stout). I have noticed it getting better from year to year and it is definitly good this time around - the only thing that is surprising to me is the watery corn/rice profile that seems to be hiding in the back of the beer.

35,102,jayrod20,4.45,"This beer is just simply amazing and great after a long day at work. Another great job from the Sam Adams people, this beer certainly lives up to their reputation and can be enjoyed by pretty much anybody.

35,102,charlzm,3.71,"Consumed 03/03/08, re-reviewed 09/29/10.  Pours a crystal-clear medium amber. A one finger head quickly dissipates to a nice foam skin. Plenty of small active bubbles.  Aroma is faint sweet grain with a lurking metallic undertone.  Biscuity/caramel malt flavor, some fresh baked bread with a slightly bitter, subtle fresh hop finish. Balanced and somewhat light.  Beer is well-carbonated and provides a nice tingle on the tongue. Slightly dry at the finish.  Not my favorite marzen, but quite serviceable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ElGrecoVerde,3.62,"By no means will this beer blow your socks off, but it's a decent, unoffensive choice.  It's a deep copper colored beer. Smells surprisingly toasty. The flavors were all nice, but somewhat mild. Toasted grains, dark fruits, and a slightly sweet caramel were all present, but nothing really stood out.  Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Slightly off white head poured big and frothy but faded quickly to almost nothing... barely any carbonation... light patchy lacing...  Aroma - Light sweet caramel and toffee maltiness, toasted bread / biscuit notes, some buttery notes, honey, cut grass traces, almond, some strawberry fruitiness, orange marmalade, some light peppery hops...  Taste - Light sweet caramel and biscuity malts initially then balanced with a good peppery hop bitterness, light toasted bread notes, sweet almond nuttiness, some spicy fruits (oranges), some slight metallic notes...  Feel - Pretty smooth and creamy with a little sharpness underneath... light / medium bodied... Extremely drinkable and sessionable..  Overall - A decent enough Oktoberfest - nothing too earth shattering... worth a try though...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It has quite a lot of body, yet is not as filling as some and there's certainly no ""bite"" to the taste. A fresh 'fest will give you a nice creamy head that should last through most or all of the drink, depending on your thirst. I recommend everyone pick up a few 12-packs yearly.

The hops do lend some balance near the end though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cbleary,4,"Enjoyed from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  This is a tasty autumn brew. It had a great, clear amber to red color with a solid white head that left a decent amount of lacing. It smelled great with a strong bready sweet malt scent. The taste featured similar characteristics to the smell but was nicely balanced by a touch of the usual Sam Adams noble hop profile. It was very drinkable considering its relatively high ABV. I wanted another right away. I recommend it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

S: A nice, sweet malty smell was evident. Smelled like a good Oktoberfest.  T: A nice, sweet malty taste. Hints of honey were also evident. A slightly bittersweet aftertaste, but that did well as a balancer for the malts and the honey.  M: A little on the thin side, but still pretty solid and silky.  D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Easy-going and smooth. Good taste and good mouthfeel make it a solid session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Caramel colored with a slightly tan foam. Thin carbonation bubbles help hold the head, and leaves thin strings of lace. Smells of sweet malt balanced with a hoppy finish. The taste is full of the sweet malt, caramel, and some hidden spice. Full bodied, flavorful, a good one to enjoy on a cool crisp evening. I thought it to be well balanced mix of malt and hops. Smooth and easy to drink, a pleasant suprise.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jackorain,3.96,"This was on tap at my local Houlihan's. I had this on October 26th, 2007 and just got to adding from detailed notes taken at that time.  A-Really nice red-amber glowing color. Nice tan head lasted a very long time and fell to a substantial 1/4 inch coat that stayed for nearly the entire drink. Where the head receded it left a very attractive lacing effect.  S-Classic lagerish aroma up front, clean Biscuit and caramel malts follow and dominate.  T-Nice malty noce, biscuit and caramel, a little sweet, some fruitiness also enters in the middle. A nice, mild, crisp bitterness finshes it out. Quite tasty.  M-Creamy, with a nice even carbonation. Medium body. Really quite nice.  D-This may be the best Oktoberfest I had this year.

35,102,trentley87,3.77,"I had the opportunity to ""borrow"" one of these from a friend. Poured from a bottle into a glass mug.  A: very pleasant, above average, but even for the beautiful orange amber color and creamy, orange tinged head, I still prefer a darker beer.  S: Deliciously sweet, very appetizing. I didn't spend a lot of time smelling this one. The smell convinced me to get straight to drinking it.  T: Excellent balance. Clearly supposed to be on the sweet side, lots of malty flavors, but not overpoweringly so. Delicious.  M: A little to ""gritty"" to be as refreshing as it has the potential to be. I don't like a lot of carbonation. Again, this barely detracted from the overall great qualities of this beer.  D: Excellent. Don't get me wrong, I could drink this all night, but there are other styles which I prefer. I don't have a reference point within this style to compare it too.  I am again impressed by the Sam Adams lineup. They are consistently offering full-flavored, complex beers and a price competitive with the BMC crowd.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Toasty malt with roasted sweetness. A little alcohol noticeable. Sweet apple flavor. Medium-full body malt. I dont really detect any hops  theyre subtle.  Good clean Oktoberfest. I like it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cdkrenz,3.84,Another purchase while in Milwaukee.  Appearance - Cloudy with an orange-amber color. The head is minimal but there are wisps of remnants that bright the surface.  Smell - The scent is sweet and malty. Solid aroma that makes this brew very tempting.  Taste - Spicy and flavorful. It even has a timid pungent side. I like it.  Mouthfeel - The feel is mildly rough but not enough to take anything away from the over goodness of this Sammy.  ~ This beer is one of the reasons I'll be trying more and more of The Boston Beer Company's brews.

Reddish brown. If I could give an award for beautiful beers this may be the blue ribbon winner. I just love they way this beer looks.  Smells sweet and malty. Slightly spicy cinnamon note as well.  Nicely balanced beer. Make no mistake, is about the malts here. Very bready (almost like a vanilla cupcake). Almost a slight maple syrup like undertone. There is some good hop character here though. Nice bitterness throughout.  I am not very learned with this style. I do however find it incredibly tasty. I enjoy drinking it every fall. Great fall session beer. The fresher the better. Check the drink by date.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A great deal if you can get a draft special around late October.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The flavor is rich and bold and is of mostly malt, with little hops to be found by me. It has a great balance of flavor and carbonation.

35,102,yemenmocha,4.3,"Pours dark, rich amber color with white head that retains well.  Nose is a pleasant musty sweet caramel, maybe old polished wood too. Some fresh brown bread in there as well.  Palate is a luxurious malty richness with hops that hide well so the malt can shine. Malt sweetness is just right in this beer. Again, some fresh bread flavors emerge as they do on the nose. This is a good example of the style, even though it's not a German example.  Finish is medium length with a residual sweetness that teases you to take another sip of this fine lager. Very good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Gehrig,4.3,"A tasty Oktoberfest, this is one of my favorites from Sam Adams. This dark orange, almost copper-colored creation pours a nice, if typically brief Sam Adams head, and has a good aroma that is at once fruity and somewhat spicy. The taste is impressive, rather sweet with citrus and a bit of caramel but also with a slight bite. The texture is a touch syrupy, but not too overbearing, and nothing that would keep me from grabbing a couple more afterward.  A fine beverage, one that always reminds me of playoff baseball watching my beloved Yankees. Well worth buying a six or a twelve-pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Reanimator,3.33,"Opening of this 12oz. is greeted with a spicy, malt aroma. Pours a golden orange color that nearly matches the label with a orange tinted and frothy head. Great lacing, hangs around for the entire drink.  The taste leaves a bit to be desired. It is dominated by malts and is missing the characteristic O-fest spiciness that most other brews nail. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy in that it coats your tongue.  I appreciate what Sam Adams has provided to the American masses, but It's almost too bad that this is the best selling Octoberfest in the world. I didn't enjoy it as much as I do most O-fest beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,tronester,3.83,"This Marzen is a dark reddish orange in color. Had no head when served to me. Smells of faint grain. This is a malt fan's beer.

Taste is also sweet with a hint of caramel. There is a dry biscuity finish.  Mouthfeel pretty good, but thinner than some examples of the style I've tried.  This beer is pretty drinkable.

35,102,saintwarrick,3.93,"One of my all-time favorites for this time of year. Pours a fairly clear pumpkin orange with a more than decent long-lasting head. Aroma is big-time malty, dinner rolls and some candied fruit. Taste is very malty and sweet, some hops there to keep it from going too far. One of the sweeter O-fest offerings I have had. Goes down smooth and is amazingly drinkable. This brew is always a staple when I have friends over during football season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,nickynick,3.46,"This beer poured a nice amber color, although a little lighter then other Oktoberfest beers I have had. Smell seemed very sweet to me. Almost no malt in the nose. Smell more of brown sugar, almost too sweet. The taste matched the smell, a little to sweet, but more malt was present in the palate then the nose. Mouthfeel was ok, a little think and sticky. Drinkability was good as well. It went down pretty smooth. This beer seemed to be missing something that other Oktoberfest beers have. It had almost no bite, or spice, that I have noticed in others.

35,102,erosier,4,"This is a nice octoberfest beer. It pours a deep amber color with a thick caramel colored head that takes some time to diminish. It smells of malts and hops mixed beautifully together. The taste backs this up. It is fresh, crisp, and delicious. It certainly quenches my thirsts for a nice beer. The blending of the malts and hops is really excellent and has a sort of sweet and bitter aftertaste that makes me always want a second glass. This one was expertly carbonated and had a really good feel in my mouth.

35,102,Stimack,4.1,"This is a shocker I have never reviewed the Sam Adams Oktoberfest. Well I guess no time like the present. The brew has the color of slightly dull copper with a nice sized head that is light tan in color with small bubbles that cling to the sides of the glass leaving a nice amount of lacing. This beer has a strong roasted malt scent, which highlights caramel and toasted aromas. The taste of this brew is very good which makes it easy drinking. While others will feel that this brew is unexciting, I find it to be a good version of a Marzen beer with is consistence and flavors. The taste is very malty which gives it a bread/dough like flavor mixed with a toasted like flavor. I do not pick up much of a clear hop presence meaning that I think things are fairly balanced out for this beer. The brew finishes relatively dry while having a fairly creamy feel through out. IMO this is a very good brew, flavors are good, freshness is there based on it being as seasonal and it really is an easy drinking sesional beverage.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Appearance - Very nice copper color with a nice thick head most of which stuck around for the ride.  Smell - Good caramel, lightly toasted scent.  Taste - Fairly clean, balanced flavor of toasted malt and a sweetish caramel.  Mouthfeel - Not the greatest bitter aftertaste, probably the one hole in the balance but still makes for easy drinking.

Pours a deep amber with golden tinges when held to the light. The off-white head is large, settling gradually to a half inch of creamy topping. The clarity is somewhat hazy with tons of tiny bubbles running up through the brew. Left some lace. The smell is of toasted malts, sweet, nutty bread, with some caramel and molasses. The taste is similar to the aroma, with roasted, nutty malts, hints of caramel, and some resiny, grassy hop bitterness to help balance it out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little bit of a dry texture and tons of fizzy carbonation on the tongue.  Overall, This is a quality beer, that fits well to the style. Not quite as balanced as I would like, although that is common for this style. A bit overly carbonated for me as well.

That is all I got.  The taste is a traditional Marzen. Sweet malt with little hop bitterness and with some very mild autumn spices. Finishes clean and crisp. Nothing spectacular and rather unimpressive as a whole. It seemed a bit watery to me and the carbonation seemed flat.

I'm not sure if it's more of a toasty malt or if it's mostly due to a little higher carbonation. I think it's a combo of both.

Taste- Rich maltiness and hop character all thru this beer. Very nice taste. As it warms there is more amber/vienna malt character that seeps thru and sweetness kicks in.

35,102,brewshakes,3.73,I tried this at dinner tonight at Ruby Tuesday's on draft. I asked for a Dog Fish Head 60 Minute IPA but the waiter soon came back and told me they were out so I went with this. I have had it in a bottle before but never of tap. On tap was much better. The beer came a nice orange color. By the time it made it to the table whatever head there was was gone. The smell was sweet with some grain. The taste was pleasant with nuts and spice. A lot better on tap. A good seasonal!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,WaveRebel51,3.83,"My favorite SA brew. The reddish-orange hue is nice, and has a decent malty, nutty aroma. The subtle sweet, malt taste reminds me of toffee, with a nice, hop spice and bitterness in the finish. I normally prefer hoppier stuff, such as Pale Ales and IPAs, but this is a very nice change-of-pace brew and a perfect compliment to a cool, fall evening.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,StargherKing,4.05,"Pours golden brown...fitting for a fall brew, it's reminiscent of the color of autumn leaves. Head is lightly tan, dissipates gradually leaving a ring around the glass. Smell is malty, slightly earthy, with just a hint of hoppiness. Taste is much the same, malty with light notes of toffee and caramel, just noticeable, with a nice light hop bitterness and more of the earthy goodness. Mouthfeel is a nice balance of smooth and light...edging ever so slightly towards crisp, without really making it all the way. Drinkability is rather nice, the 5.7% ABV seems a little stronger than it is, this one has a nice warming effect without coming off as too strong. I'm not sure I could knock these back all night, but I certainly wouldn't pass one up.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Blakaeris,3.7,"Pours clear, deep copper bronze. Head is decent but dissipates very quickly leaving a thin ring and no lacing.  Aroma is sweet sticky caramel malt. Some earthy nut and toasted grain.  Taste is nicely toasted malt, nutty, with a light fruitiness. Brown sugar sweetness and quite bready.Finish brings some hop spice and mild alcohol astringency.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy.  Overall a good offering as a session beer. Plenty of toasted malt, certainly on the sweet side, but still a pleasant brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,aquaderek,4.27,"Poured into a tasting glass... It has a very nice reddish brown coloration. The nose is spicy maltiness, with slight hops in the background.

35,102,jim102864,3.8,"Poured into my Duvel tulip glass and noted the nice copper hue with a thin, slightly bubbly head. The carbonation bubbles cling to the glass throughout the exprience. The aroma speaks of hay, copper pennies, somewhat metallic and grassy. Interesting combination of aromas. The taste is slightly nutty and grassy. There is some carbonation mixing in which impacts the mild bite in the finish to a certain degree. Not an overly malty flavor. The mouthfeel is carbonated, moderately bitter in the finish, quick and slippery in that it doesn't leave any lasting impression after the swallow. It's a nice seasonal brew that is not overly exciting. Still, it is quite drinkable. Also not a session brew but worth the price for a pint.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Strix,3.85,"A pleasant surprise. I haven't particularly enjoyed the last few Oktoberfest beers I've tried, but this beer was nice. Nicely balanced I guess, and although it had the same notes of nuts and spice as the other Oktoberfests I've tried, it lacked the unpleasant aftertaste I've picked up in other brands. This beer actually had some nice complexity to the taste - roasted malts, nuts, spice? and hops. I had about given up on the style, but this shows what is possible with it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste - Nuts and caramel seem to be the dominant flavors. The honey seeps in mid sip and the finish is hoppy.  Mouthfeel - Light/Medium body. Crisp mouthfeel. Slightly sticky.  Drinkability - Very easy to drink and highly sessionable in these cool fall months.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BravoTwo,3.89,"Had this on-tap with prime rib and potatoes. Good combination of the beer with the food, to pair the heavier beef with this beer.  A - Good appearance, but could have been a little bit darker. Light copper color, with minimal head.  S - Toasty smell, with good fall aroma. Caramel spice notes  T - Malty, with a toasted grain flavor. Crisp with a clean finish, definitely a Fall taste.  M - Crisp, with good carbonation without being overpowering / overcarbonated.  D - Good drinkability, although I only wanted one. I could have had another easily, and I think on a cool night (maybe outside) the drinkability would be higher for me.  Overall, a very nice beer that is a solid Octoberfest style beer. Not as good as others I have had esp. Octoberfest from Swashbuckler's, but definitely worth a try.

I have had this beer many times before in the bottle; and, while it is very good out of a bottle, it's even better on tap. I realize that's nothing new for a lot of beers, but the big difference between the bottle and on-tap for this brew was the mouthfeel. Out of the bottle, it sometimes tastes a bit thin. On-tap, this brew is absolutely perfect as it's substantial, but not overdone. Awesome blend of sweet malty flavors perfectly balanced by just a kiss of hops. A must have on-tap for anybody who likes (or thinks they might like) an O-Fest brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Great copper color, poured with a two finger head that had good staying power. On tap the hop aroma (Saaz) I'm guessing really hits the nose nicely.

Edit 09/12/08 : this years offering is sweeter w/ more diacetyl and a bit tart with lots of dark fruits, kinda syrupy tho...

35,102,PittBeerGirl,3.8,Its been almost a year since the SA winter mixed case introduced me to the fine world of craft beer and this is the last SA seasonal left for me to sample.  A- Completely transparent dark amber body that pours with 1 finger foamy off-white head. Head quickly fades to a thin collar and little lacing is left behind in the glass. Bubbles are seen constantly rising to the top.  S-Nose is subtle. Warm caramel malt upfront and a cool refreshing hop scent in the background.  T- A balance of caramel malt and toffee upfront with a slight edge of hop bitterness. The flavor peaks and becomes more intense for the finish but shows the same balance as the initial flavor. An abundance of toffee and caramel malt lingers with no hop presence.  M-Carbonation is high and assaults the tongue. Medium bodied and full.  D- This is a nice Oktoberfest beer made by BBC. Not the best O-fest but still decent and very drinkable. I probably won't buy this again before the O-fests leave the shelves for the winter seasonals.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,gmfessen,3.73,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a perfectly clear amber/medium copper color with a thin, creamy looking head. The smell is not overwhelming but is definitely sweet and of malt. The taste is also quite sweet, amber and caramel notes coming through, slight biscuitiness and a slightly grainy finish. The alcohol is mostly unperceivable. The mouthfeel is medium to full with little carbonation comprised of minute bubbles. A pretty drinkable beer, fairly true to the style but just a little too sweet.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Great inital off-white head which faded rather quickly into a thin pad...about what I was expecting. The overall appearence of the beer was exceptionally inviting though. Great clear vibrant burnt orange/ deep amber color with copper tones. After a few sips, I found only minimal tracing in the glass. Warm toasty malt aroma with hints of caramel and toffee. I also picked up subtle floral hop notes. Slightly warm malty flavor with a trace of residual sweetness which is well balanced by a moderate floral hop biterness. Medium richness maintains carbonation on the palate, and is quite fulfilling. Overall, this beer is very drinkable; from the initial pleasant floral bouqet to the warm, satisfying, yet clean finish, this beer meets the style well.

M: Slightly coarse, crisp. D: Honestly, it's a littler thinner than I had expected. It's definitely a good beer, but normally the Sam Adam's selections have a bit more to say than this beer does.

Large tan head fades slowly to a thick and clumpy cap with some scattered lace. Pretty attractive beer. Nose evinces the expected powdery, dry malt and notes of toasted bread. Taste is malt-heavy with a slightly buttery or butterscotch flavor. Dryish, light bitter finish. Nicely balanced. Mouth is middle-of-the-road, leaning toward semi-viscous, smooth and with low carbonation. Drinkability is very good; its tasty and easygoing. I could enjoy most of a 6er in a sitting.

Eventually it recedes to a finger depth. There is a nice web of lacing left after finishing this brew.  Smells of caramel malts and noble hops, which meld together pleasantly.  Tastes of more caramel malts, which give way to a nice drying hop bite. A solid Octoberfest falvor that is neither nondescript or lacking. Good, but not great.

There is a bit of hop in the aroma, somewhat tea-like.  Toasty malty lager taste. Fairly crisp finish. Sweet bread impression lasts after the swallow.  The mouthfeel is thicker than your average lager, and the carbonation is not as high. Makes for a smooth drink.

Taste is similar. Very bready and grainy, herbal and earth notes. Malt is present in taste but not so much so. A little let down there. Very light and crisp tasting.

Available on tap after mid-September almost everywhere that has more than just Bud Light on draft. This recent review was from a bottle to pint glass served at home.  Nice clear amber color. Good thick head. Decent retention, lots of lace. I love the appearance of this beer. Nice swirling bubbles make for an inviting pint. Smell is somewhat faint but bready, with sweet malt character. Taste reflects subdued aroma  somewhat soft and bready, lots of malt typical of your Marzen. Some hop bite at the end finishing a little dry. Crisp clean mouthfeel, very drinkable.

35,102,jmalex,3.69,"My first taste of this beer in a long while. I'm pretty sure I missed it the past year or 2 so hopefully this is an eye-opening experience for me.  APPEARANCE: Pours a crystal clear red amber into a Sam Adams glass. The head is impressive though I'm sure the etchings on the bottom of the glass helped. It starts at one finger and drops to a hearty collar and nearly full surface covering. Looks great.  SMELL: Less than intense aromas come out of this one. It's somewhat bready and toasty and has a hint of underlying sweetness. Other than that, I'm not getting too much from this.  TASTE: The taste is much more characteristic of an authentic Märzen. Bready malts come on strong as does a toasty flavor. The one complaint is that it gets a bit harsh on the finish displaying some of the flavors commonly found in lower quality lagers. That's a minor detail, however, in what is a nice tasting beer.  MOUTHFEEL: The mouth seems a bit thin with a lower carbonation than I'd like. I might even go as far to say it's watery.  DRINKABILITY: There are some really good things happening with this beer, but there's also some bad. Overall it's a nice beer that I'd certainly never turn down. As far as American versions of Oktoberfests go, this one is no where near the bottom rung, but it just can't measure up to some of the authentic German versions.  I enjoy getting to try beers that I'd only ever had before ""my eyes were opened"" to craft beer. All in all, I continue to be impressed with the Boston Beer Company and the success they have with so many different styles.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,tapman,3.33,"Not a bad copper color in appearance, but a little light for my taste, I like mine with a little more sugar and thus a darker, more caramel color. Head is white and thin with moderate lacing.  Buttery Munich malts mix with a light touch of caramel barley. Hops could be English in origin, bready and mixing with the Bavarian style malts, or just not very apparaent at all. Also smells very sweet, almost like sugar was added.  Very sweet. Taste is slightly larger than the aromas in the nose. Malts are sweet and bready. Hops are pretty standard and are probably the regular ones that they use for the boston lager.  Feels like the standard boston lager mouthfeel. Not as fun as their stouts and other brews.  I've had this back to back with a Newcastle pint and I gotta say that I liked this one better. I'm not sure about from the bottle next to a Newcastle bottle, but the pint was definetly better.

Smell is of toffee and caramel sugar. Raisiny caramel flavors are a bit more pronounced than the average German Maarzen. Hop balance is correct for the style. Body is also a touch more intense than the German counterpart.

35,102,BuckSpin,4.01,"Presentation: 12oz bottle (best by of 2/08) in a Shaker pint glass  Poured soft, smooth with a slight crackle  Nice semi-sweet nose, caramelized malts with a nice bread (pumpernickel) quality. Hops add a very faint spice & orange quality. A beautiful head of 2 finger's worth of soft, creamy, tight, sculpted foam, creamsicle in hue. It reminds me of the innards of a soon to be Jack O' Lantern as it laces in curtain like drapes. The body is equally as sharp - a crystal clear, almost luminescent, deep tangerine orange, copper-like & even a little sunburnt. Added to all this eye candy is a glasswide cascade of slow bubbles, twisting as they rise. This is a stunner visually.  Creamy, smooth, rich with soft semi-sweet caramel taking the point & dominating the initial taste, it has an almost lush tonguefeel. Faintly bitter, the hops are feeble & add a trace of some bitterness as well as a peep of some orange and maybe some really old cinnamon. The wet side of semi-dry in feel with a dulled, back of the mouth crunch that resembles an echo more than feel.  Its going down smooth & easy, growing sweeter on the palate, the malts becoming even more caramelized (very nice) with almost a high end confectionary aspect to the rich sweetness. I'm usually against overly sweet beers but this is just tasting great & going down real nice. It finishes a little more bittersweet, slightly filmy, wee bit chewy with butterscotch and a subtle citric (orange) quality, with a tiny bit of tingle of the teeth that leaves a very faint, subtle warmth.  A most enjoyable, tasty & easy to drink beer. This could be sessioned very nicely. Its a great fit for the season/genre, and a great bang for the buck. Has some aspects of a Scottish Ale. I'm seeing root veggies, aged cheddar, simple meats, something creamy (dairy) or smoked meats as a pairing. Definitely recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Nice clean taste, although it's not as deep as other marzens I've had, especially locally produced. Still, it has some deep tone to it, nice hints of spice and what I think of as a slight caramel taste. It goes down smooth, better than a macro-brew, but only average for a nice fall beer.

M - Vry clean crisp and very well carbonated. A nice touch of thines added to the feel rather then detracting from it.  D - Outstanding, you could have this one all niht.

The nose is malt, up front, but clearly has a generous dose of hops to balance it out. Slightly nutty notes here as well. The palate is precisely what the nose tells you - malt goodness, followed by drying, floral hops. Nice. Mouth feel is on the acidic side with more than ample carbonation. Finish is dry and leaves a lingering herbal and malt combination in the mouth. I'd estimate this to be a pretty decent American Oktoberfest beer.

35,102,ttu94,4,I have always loved Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer. This is one of the beers that made be really start to notice that there is more to beer that penny pitcher night at bash riprocks in Lubbock. I had this offering on tap at the Angry Dog in Dallas. Pours a clear dark amber color that has a decent head. Nice malty smell. The taste is great. Malty sweet with perfect carbonation.

35,102,rohrbachsfan,4,"Appearance: Beer had a very tall foamy head, good lacing, copper / amber red color.  Smell: Sweet toasted malt with some fruity hops aroma.

Drinkability: Very good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste is quite malty rich with a faint zest from the hops. Dates and thick corn syrup flavour with a leafy, tea-like edge; soft hop finish. Medium bodied, sticky, and slightly astringent with decent carbonation.  Concentrated and somewhat cloying. Worth trying...but not particularly easy to drink.

Just the only ingredients that are supposed to be in beer. And lots of them. I hope to drink a shitload of this type of beer at the Dakota Inn Rathskeller at 6 Mile and John R Tommorrow night.

35,102,Slatetank,3.63,"Served in an Imperial Pint at Market Cross Pub and Brewery in Carlisle, PA. A - A deep amber w/ garnet highlights, a lighter amber when held to the light. A thin tan head which condenses quickly into a thin film of head with a ring of lace.  S - A malty sweet aroma w/ a tinge of light woody hops and a gentle lactic nutty malt scent.  M - Malty w/ slightly above medium body w/ a full toasty texture. Gentle sweetness w/ a clean finish.  T - A fairly rich nutty, dry yet flavorful malt taste gets a good dose of sweet crystal malt flavor. Bready German malt flavor makes itself known as the Imperial ale glass warms. A nice woody hop flavor combines w/ a sweet caramel malt and yeasty lager flavor.  D - A very drinkable lager w/ a definite influence from the masters of the style. Pleasing pint after pint, a worthy fest in the American interpretation. I could see drinking this as a go to beer by the case.  I had this on tap in a pint at TGI Fridays enjoyed before having wings  The color is deep bronze with thin head of tan that revived when swirled. The smell is reminiscent of almonds with a sweet nutty and light fruity element The feel is highly carbonated and slightly spicy with yeast dry texture and moderate bitterness. The flavor is good but like the vienna -Boston Lager it is hoppier and cleaner than the European versions I have had with a more dry less noticeable malt character. I enjoyed this but consider it average for the style. It is drinkable which is why I can't knock it too hard overall, but it is certainly catering to an american taste which is a more hop forward lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The smell was pretty subdued.... but a sweet scent like honey, malt and caramel was most prevalent.  Taste: quite good. Nice sweet caramel/honey with a malty finish  Mouthfeel: about right for a marzen. Not too highly carbonated. Nice.  Drinkability: I could have a ton of these.... nothing objectionable.

The aroma is all malt. Sweet caramel and hints of bread go around. Very nice.  The taste is full of sweet malt. I am reminded of caramel and tofee. There is also a great toasted flavor which are followed by just the slightest suggestion of noble hops. It finishes clean.  This brew is nice and creamy on the palate. It is ultra smooth and very easy drinking.  Kudos to the folks at the Boston Beer company. This beer was excellent this year, the best I can remember. I must say that this is my favorite beer in their lineup. I hope it is this good again next year. This goes to show that a mass produced beer doesn't have to be bad.

Toasty, lightly sweet aroma; mostly malt here but some faint hops also present.  Not too sweet, but caramel malt is the show here. Toasted flavors, slightly biscuity, with a hint of herbal hopping.

Body was medium with a good bit of malt, though not as much as expected from the smell. Had a bit of tartness and enough bitterness to keep it from being cloying. Above average mouthfeel; could use a bit more prickle. Drinkability was also pretty good.  Not in the upper tier of Oktoberfests, but pretty decent. I liked it.

35,102,bobhits,3.19,"OK so this is one of the last sam adams beer I haven't had. I'm pretty happy to be nearing the end of their normal rotation and this one gets some GREAT reviews by my friends.  Anyway this is my second beer of the night as the first one left me interested but not ready to decide (a good hour between them). This beer is warmer and I'll just say that it should be served on the warm side.  A quick smell will tell you that this is a fairly malty beer. It doesn't have a fruity or sweet smell. Oddly enough the taste is about the same.  My only other octoberfest was from spatan and it was much sweeter and almost had a fruity flavor to it. I was really hoping for something on that side but I supose sam adams isn't one to go extreme with this style.  This is a nice looking beer with a nice malty flavor that is very very drinkable . It goes down easy, it's light and smooth. That said it's not interesting. It doesn't really make you want more. It's got enough flavor to mix well wtih foods but I'm not really sure what this ""season's confort foods"" are supposed to be.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,marcpal,3.91,"Not a fan of either most Sam Adams beers or Oktoberfests but really enjoyed this one a lot.  On tap at Sun Tavern in Roselle Park, NJ  A: Poured a dark amber with very little head. Looked terrific in a pint glass, good body.  S: Malty and toasty and the one thing it had in strong common with other oktoberfests was the aroma.  T: Did not taste nearly what I had expected in the smell but I think this was not a bad thing- Very smooth with a marked malty aftertaste that really accompanies other tastes. Spices have a presence here as well  M: Nothing dramatic.  D: Very high, surprisingly enjoyable and went for a few after enjoying the first. Not many beers are better with a pizza during the fall than this one.  Im a little embarassed it took me so long to discover and try out this beer- going to add to my list for the season.

35,102,beeragent,4.05,"Compared to other Oktoberfest beers, this tastes totally different IMO, and not in a bad way. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a glass. The beer pours a dark copper/orange color, forming a 1/2 inch head that quickly fades. Very little lacing is visible. The aroma is malty, but also appears to have a bit of spices in the mix. Odd because I dont remember last years smelling this way, but its good. The taste is the same for the most part. Sweet malts up front, but still finishing with a sweet spicey/sugary finish. I'm confused as this doesnt taste like an Oktoberfest should. Light smooth mouthfeel. Aside from the odd characteristics mentioned above, this still seems to be a very tasty beer. Decent abv. and flavor make for a very sessionable beer. Overall, not bad. Not what I expected, but still suprised with a good tasting beer.

Biege lacing never dies and just adds to the look. Very good.  Nose is of malts, with a nice faint hop note. Very sweet in the nose.  Very, very malty, but not sweet. Taste like homemade bread. The hops are there just to balance the flavor. Finishes sweet with malts to chase it down.  Very good beer. Easy to find. Easy to drink.

Nose is very mild, but mostly caramel malt with some light dried fruit. Flavor is fairly similar. Sweet malt, cotton candy, raisins, some berries too. A very sweet beer with extremely light hop presence. Feel is solid with good carbonation. Can't complain about this one; it's a solid beer with a nice sweet flavor.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Gambrinus1184,3.82,"Poured on-tap at the Red Door in Watertown, Conn.  A: This brew poured a dark orange with a 1/4 inch head that disappeared rather quickly. Nice color, not too bad of a lace.  S: Smells sweet and toasty, with definitive malt sweetness and some sugary grain thrown into the mix for good measure.  T: Taste is sweet and malty, just as you would expect from the smell. It tastes like a fuller-bodied Red Ale that's been given more malt, and thus, more character.  M: Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied, I'd say, for an American Marzen. Not too heavy to enjoy more than a couple.  D: Drinkability is high, despite the higher than average ABV tap offering; it's smooth and tasty, and too good to turn down, given the season we're in. So many of these could be had.  This particular night, it's all that could be had, and for a change in seasonal brews, I say, welcome to the Oktoberfest season, with this American offering of the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A little lace, though the head didn't hold.  Smell is lots of sweet malt and perfumey hops. A few hints of harshly toasted grains, and something mineral-ey, perhaps overboiled grains?  Taste is quite mellow and plain. The malt sort of disappears behind a little bit of alpha riding on some bready grains and just enough yeast for it to be noticable. Hoptaste is a little citric, a little grassy, but not enough of anything to be sure. Aftertaste starts towards sweet but then gets a bit acrid and dry.  Feels nice enough on the tongue, heavier than most big domestic brews. Carbonation could be a little more excited.  All in all, exactly what I'd expect from BBC and at this price. Good, predictable, and fantastically easy to throw back with some burgers, chips, salsa, and other such things. Very balanced, almost to the point where it's hard to tell what's what.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

They were pouring this against the Spaten Oktoberfest at Bar 35 last night, and though it didn't match up very well, it made me appreciate certain aspects of this beer that I've loved to hate on in the past.  Poured a clear amber, not much head, but decent wispy retention on the glass. Smelled of biscuity malts, a bit of diacetyl, and a light earthy hop. Pretty appetizing. Tasted a bit watery, or as someone else said last night, ""spun out"". Slightly slick mouthfeel, medium bodied, this year's offering from BBC does go down easy. Not my favorite style to begin with, for better or worse, this has become the standard American interpretation thereof, but it loses a lot of the roasty-toasty characteristics that make the German Marzens so flavorful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell is of roasted malts along with some raisin fruitiness... alcohol is quite apparent on the nose.  Lots of malts in the taste with some hops flavors thrown in to balance it out... not bad but lacking in complexity. Unfortunately I've become accustomed to dopplebocks for my malt fix and this just tastes like a watered-down dopplebock.  Mouthfeel seems thin and watery.

Color is solid with the traditional auburn/copper color with a carbonated head that quickly melts to a few islands floating on the top.  Smell is of malt and more malt, with a hint of hops/fruit on the end.  The taste is good but a bit lite and the malt character is just a bit off for my taste.

35,102,jpkoch1962,2.65,"Served chilled at cellar temps. Appearance was nothing special. A standard, clean amber color, nice head and lacing. The aroma was bready, malty, and a bit beery. This beer could pass as an OK amber lager, but it is a far cry from an authentic Oktoberfest lager. The bottle adverts boast of 5 different malts and noble hops; however, most of the taste was dominated by a sweet yet astringent cloyiness of the caramel malts -which in my opinion were overdone. An authentic Oktober Fest should use only 2-Row Bavarian or Moravian Pilsner malt and dark Munich malts. The use of cyrstal or caramel malts only changes the color and adds sweetness, and does not necessairily add to the malt profile.  The taste did smooth out towards the finish probably due to the hops -but the chewy sweetness remained somewhat in the aftertaste.  A classic Oktoberest Beer should focus on a big malt body without being sweet. The end results should be a very smooth amber lager that touches a balance that between the malt and the hops; the finish should be dry and clean (which is in this case the main function of the hops). It appears SAs went overboard with specialty malts as this beer is way out of balance. I'd also like to know if they used North American or European 2-row barely. This beer is way too sweet and bready and lacks the subtlety of a true Oktoberfest beer. This is a surprise as SA makes a very nice, well balanced Scotish Ale. An authentic Oktoberfest beer is well within thier skillset.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,malcontent,3.85,"Deep, clear auburn body crowned by an imposing head that unfortunately recedes more quickly than I'd like.  Great scents of honey and apple skins support the gloriously malty nose. Iced tea attributes creep up on the finish.  Rich roasted undertones compliment a robust but controlled malt sweetness. Apple-y notes surface once again with a brown sugar theme throughout. Moderate bitterness tempers the sweetness somewhat on the conclusion.  Thick without any syrupy tendencies, carbonated without leaning toward fizzy. A tad heavy but that's the nature of the style.

M: smooth, perhaps a bit watery, but not much. Nothing special, but my mouth does become coated with some sort of sweet tasting lining.  D: very drinkable, particularly with food.

The toffee and caramel flavors are present, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel- Not light, not heavy. Just about right. The perfect transition from the lighter summer brews to the upcoming heavier winter offerings.  Drinkability- As with any other O'fest that I have tried, these beers are made to drink.

MF- like a thin syrup with medium carb, it feels almost too sweet to drink and makes my stomach say ""no"".  D- refreshing and light feeling if you're very thirsty. if i wanted something this sweet i would drink soda. heavily balanced on the malt side, i'd rather have a great lakes oktoberfest instead.  ***2008 edit*** this years batch is considerably better than 2007. malt is toastier and less cloying, earthier more pronounced hops put things in balance. worthy of a new review somewhere near a B+.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Pouring and drinking it, there seemed to be a perfect affinity to the Dogfish Head 90 I also picked up (my favorite for the last year or so). It's like a 90 lite. Malty. Tastey and nice smell.  My only turn off is that officially somebody is calling it a Marzen. I have hated that style (can't remember whose). Ah, what's in a name. I already had two and I think I'll have another!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,sweethome,3.46,"Pours a deep copper color in to my new Samual Adams glass. A nice white head of a couple inches, flows to the top of the bulbous glass. Head retention is pretty good - provides some lace as well.  Nose is a bit metalic, alcohol, a backing of sweet malts. Not as rich as what I expect from a fest. Just a bit harsh.  The flavor delivers some sweet malts, a rich bread flavor. Traditional german malts. Just a touch of hop in here - again sticking to the tradition versus some americanized versions - seems to me Sam O'Fest has had a bit more hop in the past?  This beer delivers flavor throughout the palate. It feels full, but not overbearing. A decent session beer if you can take the sweetness without the palate cleansing of hops. Again, true to style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

This beer boasts a rich and sweet malty caramel aroma. It also has a slightly bready aroma. It has a mildly spicy hop aroma as well, but it is mostly dominated by the malts.  This beer tastes exactly like it smells. The malty aroma is a little less prominate in the flavor, but it is still pretty much matching the aroma.  This beer is smooth, and very crisp and refreshing. It leaves a sweet malty aftertaste. It is perfectly carbonated.  This beer would probably make a great session beer. Good, mild flavors, and relatively low alcohol make it a perfect choice.  Overall: I like this beer. Some might say that it is not extreme enough, but I enjoy its subtalty. I always buy this one this time of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Hops were there but played a secondary role as accent and highlights. Finish and into the aftertaste was a drying sweetness. Mouthfeel was smooth and buttery with low apparent carbonation.

Nothing offensive, as the malts continue toward a caramel taste and yearn you for more. Not many hops, but who needs it in this style. Extremely drinkable and one of the top Oktobers I've had this season!!  Revision: This beer has been dumbed down over the years.

Perhaps my BAness has just given me more appriciation for the malty side of things...  Poured into a SA Lager glass (Thanks Bros and Jim!) a crystal clear, reddish orange topped by a healthy two inches of delicate head (large bubbles, lots of air space) that dissipated fairly quickly... Wonderful spicy nose that somehow made think of football and pumpkins. A little residual heat in the nose as well... The maltiness is balanced quite well with the Noble hop character. I think that perhaps the hops come through a little more than in previous years... But the balance is so close that I can actually feel the middle of my tongue doing a little dance between it's sweet side and it's bitter side and smacking the roof of my mouth after swallowing.

Other Sam Adams products...not such good beer.  But I guess if they can introduce decent beer to the masses who usually drink Bud or Miller, then Sam Adams is doing us all a service.  On to the beer -- unexceptional but adequate in every way. It looks, smells, and tastes perfectly average.  Dark orange / amber color is supposed to remind you of fall. Very little head retention though, and the beer's smell is uninspiring. There might be a touch of malty sweetness to the smell, but perhaps a touch of skunkiness as well. The only way you detect any of that is if you try really hard.  Taste is smooth and malty with a slight touch of sweetness. I know this is advertised as a ""malt lover's dream,"" and I'm not that much of a malt lover. But still, they also brag about five malts being packed into this beer, and I'm not sensing that much complexity.  The mouthfeel is average; average creaminess, carbonation and aftertaste.  I could always drink it in a pinch, and I would appreciate it if the alternatives were larger American macro brews.

All in all not a great taste but good for people who haven't had a true Oktoberfest beer. It's very thin  Mouthfeel: Light and thin.

35,102,JerzDevl2000,4.1,"Got this last October and haven't gotten around to it until recently. I've had this in past years, but I wanted to see if this year's batch would be any different. That turned out to be the case, as this beer didn't have the smell or taste of other Octoberfests that I've enjoyed. Nevertheless, Boston Brewing did a find job with this and I thoroughly enjoyed this brew!  This beer poured a nice deep-orange amber with a slight amount of head, and no lacing down the side of my glass. In past years, I remember this being spicy and having hints of vanilla and cinnamon in it. This year, that wasn't true at all. It reminded me a lot more of their Double Bock than anything else I've drank in recent months. A very strong malted roastiness was this brew's hallmark, with lots of chocolate backing it up. The ABV seems like it should be much more than 5.70%, as it can be easily tasted here and the lack of hops and carbonation makes it that much easier to discern. It's the middle of winter now, but this seems to go perfectly with the weather outside and it's doing a nice job of warming me up!  There isn't a whole lot of depth to this, but I still enjoyed it and am glad that I gave it try to see how it held up to it's previous incarntions in year's past. I'm sure the Winter and White Ale's will also be different this year, but that's what makes microbrews so enjoyable to me.

The finish was greatwhich left your mouth with the malty flavor and craving for more; i also found myself enjoying hte beer more as it got warmer and warmer. I alos enjoyed the smell which was a warm roasted malt that i could almost taste wiht one smell,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Gatch,3.88,"I first had it in a 6-pack and it was disappointing. I then had it on tap and it was an entirely different beer. First of all, the color was incredible. Second, you could really taste the combo of the four different malts that they use. Very good throughout. The best was the finish, which had a nice honey aspect. It was also very smooth throughout. An enjoyable fall seasonal, but I have yet to try a lot of fall seasonals. This is probably middle of the pack. Give it a shot no doubt.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jdmorgan,3.88,"This beer poured a nice amber with a bit of red tint to it and had a small, quickly dissipating head. The aroma has some malt aroma and a hint of a fruit sweetness. The taste had a medium malt body with a caramel sweetness to it. There was a medium hop flavor to it with a light/medium bitterness. The mouthfeel was light/medium in consistency and had a medium carbonation. Despite having a sweeter flavor to it, I felt that this beer was very well balanced in all aspects and has a good seasonal drinkability to it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,sullysbeer,3.98,"Aroma: Malty and clean. Hints of toffee and caramel. Not much hop nose at all.  Appearance: Crystal clear, deep reddish copper hue. White head retention that lasts.  Flavor: Munich malt, toffee and caramel flavors, complex malty sweetness that smothers the delicate hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body that's silky on the tongue with a medium carbonation.  Overall Impression: Malt lover's dream, is what Sam Adams calls it. Very clean fermented lager. Octoberfest beer is actually a stronger version of the Vienna Lager known as a Marzen. These beers are usually brewed in March, femented and aged until the September and October months. I remember last years being a little bit sweeter, but this years is really good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Procrastinator,3.46,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Best before Feb. 07 date. After drinking this seasonal for many years, this is my first written review of this beer.  Appearance: light reddish-orange color with golden yellow highlights on the outer edges. Fine bubbled head dissipates quickly to leave very slight lacing.  Smell: slight fragrance of sweet maltiness and nuts, caramel sweet.  Taste: well balanced hop bitterness to malty sweetness with slight alcohol at finish. Mild sourness also noted.  Mouthfeel: nicely carbonated makes for good mouthfeel, maybe a bit on the thin side.  Drinkability: mild mannered easy drinking Octoberfest. Always look forward to seeing this seasonal on the shelf.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TheManiacalOne,4.18,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a mug glass.  A: The beer is a bright reddish orange color, with a decent-sized foamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace.  S: The aroma is malty, with caramel, hops, tea and spice.  T: The taste is likewise very malty, as it should be, with flavors of caramel, toffee, tea and some spices. Theres also a decent hops presence in a beer of this style with that distinctive Sam Adams hops signature. After-taste is sweet but not overly so.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, clean finish.  D: Very tasty, excellent representation of style, not very filling, goes down very easily, I once polished off a 12-pack in a couple hours so Ill say its very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,RonfromJersey,4,"Clear, bright shiny copper body, lively carbonation streams, topped by four fingers of off-white froth.  Aroma of fresh bread, and freshly mowed hay and grass. Not a huge nose, but an inviting one.  Rich caramelly malt start, with some depth to it, sweet without cloying. Earthy, noble hops follow to balance the sweet without overpowering, and deliver a satisfying snap at the finish. Sweet and bitter merge and entwine and ride off into the aftertaste together. Shows that clean and crisp can have flavor.  Good light/medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability, though maybe a bit too heavy for unlimited liters.  A solid widely available American version of the classic Octoberfests. Prost !",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cooncat,3.05,"Serving was from a 12 oz. bottle, from a case purchased Sept. 2006. I also purchased a case each of Oktoberfest brews from Penn Brewery and Stoudts Brewery at the same time, in order to do a side by side by side comparison.  The Sam Adams Octoberfest beer produces a deep orange/amber colored beer in the glass, with a relatively short lived off white head. Sheeting was good to the bottom of the glass. The nose is unremarkable, with notes of bready/toasty malts. The flavor to me also had a slighty toasted malt note, very light, but balanced. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side for my liking, and for my expecations of the style (remember that I was comparing this to 2 other Fest brews at the same time). Finish is dry, with no aftertaste. Of the 3 Octoberfest brews I tried, this was my least favorite, but still, it has its merits in its balance and drinkability.  Prost!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mobud,2.83,"A friend gave me a six of this beer. Used a shaker glass to sample.  A: Nice dark copper color witha light head that disappers quickly. The beer was very clear and clean.  S: A malty sweet smell is the main note with a slight burn element behind it.  T: I felt a heavy malt flavor in line with the style.  M: Very light with the malt taste lingering afterwards. Some carbonation is noted, but the lightness of the body leaves almost instantly.  D: I did not mind this beer. It seems to be a good starting point for someone who can not handle the complex nature of real fest beers. If I gave my friend a Hacker Octoberfest, I don't think they would like it as much. With so many fest beer out there, this should not be your first purchase.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Metalmonk,3.85,"An average-size lighter beige head sits on top of a burnt amber/orange color.  Aroma features candy-like malts, caramel and toffee mostly. Really nice, but a little too mild, would like this to be a lot stronger.  Flavor delivers a very malty beer which, like the aroma, reminds mostly of caramel and toffee. Nice richness to it, has a nice toastiness and even a little maple in there. Moderate carbonation delivers the flavors well enough, but like S.A.'s Winter Lager, flavors are more satisfying as it warms.  So very drinkable, so very above-average, like most of the Samuel Adams stuff. And like most of the S.A. stuff, not a mindblower despite its very good qualities.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,JayTheFinn,3.12,"This is a rather blah version of an Oktoberfest. It's not terrible, just not inspired.  A - Dark red/orange body with a wee head. S - Sweet scents in the nose. T - A light sweet malty flavor of honey. Tastes like most others I've had, except that it's lighter in flavor. M - Not bad. What flavor there is adequately coats the tongue. D - It's a drinkable beer, just not something I'd seek out to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mrasskicktastic,3.02,"A -Tiny half finger of head rests over a reddish caramel orange brew. The head is short lived and leave no lacing.  S - Sweet, red licorice, faint currants - not a whole lot going on here, but it isn't mild, just not a lot of dimension.  T - A light, slightly sweetmalty flavor with a bit of a rice and grassy hops aftertaste. The tiniest hint of anise. Not much bitterness. Not much flavor at all. It isn't terrible or anything, it just lacks personality.  M - Thick, smooth, pretty refreshing.  D - Good. It is a decent Octoberfest, a bit bland, but it is a subtle style. I prefer my pumpkin ales to this, but I wouldn't mind drinking this again. Good with some foods. Decent all around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,canucklehead,3.85,"bought a sixer in Seattle and have been enjoying this beer with many Fall dishes. Considering the reasonable price , this is a well made O fest beer that is easy drinking yet packed full of those nutty flavours that occur in this style. The finish is tiny bit sweet which suits the style and I like the balance in the mouthfeel. One of the best I have tried in this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Flavors of bready malts dominate this brew with almost no hop presence. Kind of an empty flavor, decent but not great.

35,102,mnj21655,3.63,"Pours a deep amber/copper in color with a respectable off-white head that drops to just a coating. Smell is predominantly of hops with sweet malts and some fruits also present. Tastes first of malts followed by hops then a hint of spice. Fairly well balanced with a bit of hop bitterness at the finish. Nice mouthfeel, leans towards being light bodied, very smooth, almost dry, with some carbonation. Good drinkability, while this isn't the greatest marzen ever its flavors are nicely balanced. Very smooth and great for a nice fall day.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Westsidethreat,3.73,"A: Clean pumpkin auburn with a few thin currents of bubbles rising to the top. Oatmeal colored head began solid but dropped quickly, probably one of the poorest heads I've seen on a Sam Adams brew.  S: Toasted biscuits, ripe red fruits and caramel.  T: Immediate maltiness...buttery, dough and caramel. Some serious toasted cereal aspects move towards the center and tips of the tongue adding much needed depth. Finishes with melon moments, strawberry lows and burnt brown sugar.  M: Medium body...fairly smooth. Touch of fuzzyness at times.  D: The head on a Boston Beerco beer is usually a sight to be seen....not this time. Unusual to say the least. Not a bad tasting beer by any strech.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,hylton44,3.72,"Deep, rich copper hue with a light tan head that fizzes. Spicy robust aroma that makes me think of finely aged ingredients pried out of some kind of rustic elvish barrel, surrounded by mounds of fresh apples and hard cheeses. Spices evident in the taste, too; which is quite sweet and syrupy. Caramel and cinamon malts amidst the sugars which, unfortunately, make the mouthfeel just a tad too thick and sticky. Other than that, this hearty brew is a very welcome thing to have swirling about your ribs on a brisk October day.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste: It tasted good. it had a malt taste to it and I hinted a little caramel.  Smell: Very good smell to it, one of the beers better parts.  Drink ability: I sat at a restaurant and the drink ability was very positive.

Some shimering, cascading lacing.  Smell was smooth and pleasant. Caramel and Vienna malts were apparent with a touch of vanilla.  Taste was malty rich on the front end. As with the aroma, Vienna malts were evident but not overwhelming. Later, some ripe fruits came through before the spiciness kicked in. Slightly hoppy finish created a nice balance to this predominantly malty and somewhat sweet beverage.  Rich, creamy, pillowy and slightly sticky mouthfeel with perfect carbonation.  Overall, this is a smooth, pleasant and very easy drinking beer. It may lack some of the intensity in aroma and taste that typically define Oktoberfests, yet it is still a good all-around beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,neenerzig,3.88,"This beer pours a clear, deep amber orangish/red color. Foamy white head pours about one finger thick. head shrinks about 2 or 3 minutes after being poured. Left some decent lacing. Aromas of malt, citrus, spice, and a trace of hops are all present here. Sweet tastes of malt, caramel, citrus, a hint of spice, and a touch of hops all balance each other nicely. Leaves a somewhat dry aftertaste. Has a nice crispy and frothy mouthfeel.

Some sweet fruit, like orange came through as well. A little bit of spice too. A great blend, but it could be a little stronger.  Taste is strong on the malt flavors. Tastes a little burnt actually. Some sweet caramel with a hint of chocolate and toffee. Not bad. Not great either though.  Feels a little watery and a little slick going down. Decently balanced. A moderate carbonation prick. About an average mouthfeel.  Not a great beer, but easily drinkable when the season hits.

35,102,geexploitation,3.81,"Pours a dark amber with brown notes, very clear, with a scruffy head that thins to a dusting. Grainy nose, but not a prominent one at all. On the palate, malty up front, with a sweet sensation increasing straight through to the finish. Sticky and substantial on the tongue, like a true Marzen style Oktoberfest. Thick carbonation, slick mouthfeel, a bit of a metallic note in the finish. Overall, a pretty good Oktoberfest, pretty true to the Marzen style. A good choice, and this certainly has to be one of the more accessible options out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Not the best Sam Adams but a fairly solid brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,dblinkhorn,3.28,"Poured from a 12oz bottled into a pint glass.  Appearance - Pours with a two-finger light-tan head that is pretty creamy but with some large soapy bubbles on the top. As it dissipates it becomes creamier and decent lacing is left all the way down. It settles at a thin layer of patchy lace on top of the beer. The color is orange-honey and it is very clear. There is little carbonation activity within.  Smell - Slightly fruity hops with some mild bitterness/sourness. Some very slight citrus is just behind the initial hop smell. Some coppery and slightly bready malt aromas in the back. Very little alcohol is detectable.  Taste - Very bread pudding-like malt that is surprisingly rich is tasted right away. Slight bitterness from the hops just behind this, which holds well and peaks just before the finish. Some very slight cherry and plum fruitiness in with the malt flavors. The finish comes in with a slightly-metallic malt character. Finishes with a taste of raw pumpkin, surprisingly. This quickly flashes out, however, and gives way to a fading raw, grainy malt character.  Mouthfeel - Fairly light-bodied (maybe just barely medium-bodied). Has little smoothness. The carbonation is good, but is just a bit too much in my opinion.  Drinkability - The flavors aren't too strong, and the beer has an overall ""light"" feel to it. Definitely could be a session beer if you dig the flavor.  A decent Oktoberfest-style beer. Its best feature is the rich pudding-like malt character that hits you straight-away. Has good drinkability, but is overall an average beer. Worth a try definitely.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Poured out a beautiful dark amber color, has a nice head on it that dissipated and left a light lacing as I drank.  I couldn't detect much of a smell, which I found unusual. I agitated it a bit and some nice, faint sweet odors wafted up.  The taste was sweet and spicy, very refreshing. a very pleasant aftertaste that just made me want to drink more.  Very light carbonation that didn't assault my palate, very smooth with a creamy finish.  This is a VERY drinkable beer.

I have really enjoyed the bottled over several years, but wow is it superior on tap. The same flavor profile of sweet malted honey is there, just in spades. This stuff honestly rocks. I preferred Paulaner marzen to the bottled Sam Octoberfest, but I just tried them back to back on tap and it's no contest. The SA has better color, aromas, and tons more character and flavor. I'm pretty sure my brother would be open to transfusions of this stuff as he is a full fledged addict.

Smell: The light nose bares sweet malts- biscuity, caramel, and toasty, light fruit, and noble hops.  Taste: There are sweet malts up front, which turn toasty and biscuity in the middle as fruits and grains come in. The finish is dry and hoppier than most, but it's not a hoppy style.  Mouthfeel: This brew is medium-bodied and it feels smooth and creamy, with average carbonation.  Drinkability: Everybody is saying that this years Sam Adams O-Fest is the best they have ever made.

35,102,beermanbrian,3.85,Thanks to gdrakeman for this one. He's been bugging me about giving it a try. I'm sure I had it at some point in the past but can't really say it left any kind of impression. Had it on tap last night while out to dinner so figured tonight would be a good night to review the bottle.  Pours a nice dark copper color and foams up with a surprising nice little head that sticks around a while. Eventually falls to a very thin film on the top. Looks about as exiting as it gets for an Oktoberfest i guess. Smell is strong on the malty side. Taste follows suit. I've seen some complain that this is too sweet but frankly I think it has a pretty good balance of hops. Nice bitterness in the back of the mouth and finish. I was ready to be down on this one just to spite gdrakeman but i have to admit that it's a pretty good beer. Nice seasonal sipper.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,memory,3.35,Had on tap. Appeared to have a nice head at first that diminished to a lacy slide. Smelled and tasted of lactic notes that were slightly sour with hints of vanilla. This was just tapped I was told by the bartender. Did the lines change the taste? As it didn't taste like any Octoberfest I've ever had.

The beer's color is a clear orange-copper. The nose is very biscuity, bready, and slightly (noble) hoppy. Very nice, although not pronounced. The taste is quite balanced, with of course a focus on the caramelly breadiness of the malt. There's a hint of bitterness in its lingering finish. I've had more complicated O-fests, but this still does the job here. The mouth is spot-on, with just enough carbonation (smooth, though) to tingle.

Taste: caramel, mild fruit sweetness, a hint of nuttiness, and very mild bitterness. Overall a sweeter beer that is somewhat dry. Simple and straightforward.  Mouthfeel: smooth from start to finish. The finish is also a bit dry. Aftertaste is short with some caramel sweetness.  Drinkability: had a pint before dinner and two with dinner. Of course the restaurant selection was macro heavy, so my options were limited. But I found this to be flavorful and very easy to drink. Definitely worth trying.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Has a very ruby/amber color to it, maybe even more so than a Killian's, but very attractive. Very malty in the nose, sweetness, but not much else. The taste is mostly of these sweet malts, with a slight aftertaste of hops.

35,102,dpd729,3.71,"After a long day at work, I have decided to crack open my first Octoberfest for the year. I find the Octoberfest to be one of the top offerings from Samuel Adams every year.  I poured my 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  A - This beer has a gorgeous color. It is a dark burnt orange color that looks rich and tasty. The head is about 2 fingers but fades quickly to a lace which hugs the sides of the glass to the finish.  S - The smell is suprisingly a little thin. With such deep colors I was expecting a bit more pronounced smell. It is not bad, just not what I remember in the past.  T - This is an excellent beer in my opinion. It has a very malty taste with definite additions of caramel, moreso than in the past. There is virtually no taste of alcohol and the aftertaste is mild and pleasant.  M - Much like the smell, the mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected. This beer definitely drinks lighter than it looks. One thing I notice is that I do not taste and spice in the beer however I feel the distinct tingle from spiciness on my tongue.  D - The combination of the light body and excellent taste make this a very easy drinking beer.

Nice orange/amber colorwith a smallish head that melts to a ring of lacing. Aroma is fresh sweet toasted malt with a little light fruit and floral scents. Taste is sweet toasted malt that isn't overly sweet and gets an addition of floral flavors before being balanced out by just a touch of hops. Aftertaste is mostly a light sweetness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly rich and creamy. This years SA Octoberfest is one extremely flavorful brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kkipple,3.66,"A pour into a pint glass produces a beautiful rust colored beer, clear with an eggshell colored head that disappears to quickly lurk on the top. Looks like autumn colors fell into my pint. Quite pretty.  I get a lot of sweet malt in the nose, with some pilsner-style hops (whatever they may be) and a slight tartness.  Taste is dominated by lots of sweet, caramel malts. Some evident yeast and a bit of a dry corn-flavor. Theres some bittering hops in there to keep it from being TOO sweet, but theyre a balancing measure and nothing more. This is a mildly dry, malty, sweet beer. I like it a lot, but the sweetness is a bit grating  I doubt I could down more than two before I switched to something a little lighter.  I really enjoyed this offering from Sam Adams  its tasty, pretty, and easy to drink. A good example of the style and the price is right.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,plaid75,3.58,Poured a dark copper hue with a one finger pillowy white head. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell featured a strong caramel malt aroma with a smattering of aroma hops.  The taste was upfront malt sweetness with a solid toasted grain bill. A very good doughy aftertaste as well.  The mouthfeel was on the creamy side.  Overall a good drinkable Octoberfest. A bit on the sweet side and could have used a bit more hop in my opinion.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,uwmgdman,4.03,"The Sam Adams Octoberfest pours a brilliantly clear copper-red color into my 16oz. Bucky pint glass. A thin white head quickly diminished. The aroma of this beer is definitely malt, moderate-high maltiness, as with the style, a spicy toasted maltiness evident, along with a sweet aroma, like of some sort of crystal malt. The initial taste of the beer is moderate-high sweet maltiness with a gentle toasted background and hop bitterness is low, but is there enough to create good balance. There is no detectable hop flavor or aroma. The beer is exceptionally smooth and the sweetness is balanced nicely by the background of toasted malt. Carbonation is moderate with a medium-full body yet still decent drinkability. Overall I really enjoyed this Octoberfest. The beer is on the sweeter end of Octoberfests Ive had recently, but still has enough balance in large part due to the toasted grains. The one thing that really stands out with this Fest is its remarkable smoothness, definitely the smoothest Octoberfest Ive had. As expected, this beer delivered nicely, it was part of my self-made sample pack and worth a purchase of a full 6er before the season is up.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Foxman,3.63,"It pours a deep, honey amber, clear and reasonably carbonated. A finger of white head drops soon to simple froth traces. Lacing clings sparingly to the inside of the glass.  The aroma is chiefly sweet malt, almost cloying initially and with a hint of general fruitiness, then dried by a very sparse but notably Noble hop presence.  Upon sipping, the malt is the primary entity, with a baked crust and earthy berry fruit character that slides into a caramel and biscuit zone. A sprinkling of hops comes through, though barelt, with a touch of peppery spice. A grassiness appears near the close, along with a very indistinct and disappointing adjunct impression. The finish lingers quite briefly with just a smattering of hop bitterness. It's balanced on the surface, but rather uneven in its performance.  A bit north of light bodied, the malt fleetingly crosses the palate, but not without some legacy in its wake.  It struggles to get much higher than mediocre in spots, and the dimensions it does display don't have a lot of depth, but it's also utterly inoffensive, and that actually helps make it considerably more drinkable than I thought on first impression. If you're looking for profundity in your beer, this is not the place to delve. But if you're okay with the occasional foray into better-than-average, and nicely drinkable, then you could do worse. Of course, you could do better as well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

No lacing to speak of.  Smell: Not much there. I get hints of fruits but they are not strong enough to distinguish. No smell of alcohol. Smells very thin and light.  Taste: As anticipated very light and balanced. No overpowering hops or malts. Slight citrus to grassy taste. The malt combination is very nice and balanced. The finish is quite bold and holds most of the taste in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Kind of dry and carbonated. I feel very light carbonation on the tongue and the finish leaves me wanting more.  Drinkability: Very easy drinking. Nice beer for a fall day. Nothing overpowering just a smooth, light taste representative of a nice cool autumn day. I like this beer and I am not a huge Sam Adams fan.

A thin white head forms and dissapates quickly to nothing.  The smell is sweet and earthy. There are some malted grain notes, and sweet fruit fragrance, peaches and apricots.  The taste is sweet and flavorful. There is a caramel malt flavor, roasted grain and a mildly bitter hop finish. The flavors are reasonably well balanced.  The mouth feel is smooth and little cloying.  This is a drinkable beer.

35,102,goochpunch,2.3,"Pours a darke copper orange with low carbonation and a thin, barely there at all, head. Laces some. The malt smells too toasty for me. Too much of a noble hop presence in the nose as well. Aside from that, has typical malty body of an oktoberfest. Flavors are off and not what I expect when I open a bottle of what I think to be an oktoberfest. It has a malty sweetness, yes, but that is far overdone. Lacks any depth to the malt flavors. Just sweetness. Hop flavors stand out way too much. No clean lager finish. What is this? Syrupy mouthfeel. Carbonation is too prickly. I don't care for this much, but it's not the worst thing I've had.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The flavor is rich and bold and is of mostly malt, no hops to really be found which is a contrast to most Sam Adams beers. It has a great balance of flavor and carbonation. The mouthfeel is good, very smooth, a medium body but the beer has a thick flavor. This beer has a long, lingering aftertaste that some sweet notes that just add to the character. I could drink these all year round. One of my favorite beers, a great flavor, a beer that always delivers. Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,phishgator,3.71,"This poured into a pint glass with a nice foamy off-white head. The deep amber/coppe hue was brilliant. The aroma is a faint biscuity, malt infused sweet concoction. The flavor is a nice mellow malt driven taste. The highlights are the caramel and toffee along with the balance. The hops are not much of a side note, but that's what you want. I can say that after three you might need too drink more!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I get a small bitterness at the toward the end. Finishes pretty dry.  Mouthfeel is above average. Medium light bodied. A little more towards the medium side. Good carbonation tingle. Coats the mouth.  Drinkability is just alright. I could drink a couple but I dont know about much more.  Overall Sam Adam's Octoberfest is an above average Octoberfest that's worth a try.

Malty initial flavor, somewhat sweet and a little sticky, light toasted flavor, with low-moderate bitterness balancing it. Finishes clean and drier than expected. Neutral texture with a firm body.

Nice malty smells, with a slight floating hint of citrus/orange and a touch of clove.  T: A pastiche of malt characters ranging from the bakery to the candy shop. Bread, orange cake, citrus peel, biscuits, caramel, and spiced cider. Fantastic fall flavors--the BBC did well this year.

35,102,Kendo,3.53,"On tap at Beff's in town in a mug. A coppery-amber, and when the waitress brought it (who knows how long it had been sitting after the pour), there was a small white head. It left some lacing up top, but no more as I drank my way down the glass.  Smelled of sweet malt, caramel and toffee, but not in an overpowering way.  Taste was similar -- high on the malt as you'd expect, with a sweet caramel flavor dominating. An ever-so-slight bitter aftertaste lingers, however, but sweet malt is still the prevailing taste.  Mouthfeel -- medium-bodied, but I thought it was a tad bit over-carbonated.  Drinkability -- OK. I waivered between giving this a 3.5 vs. a 4.0. It's decent, but it's nothing phenomenal -- ultimately the high carbonation level led me to knock it down a peg. I'd like to do a side-by-side with some other Octoberfests and see how this measures up. My gut feeling is that it'd be somewhere in the middle.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Dark hard candy smells.  Sweeter malt flavors up front, with the slightest hop twang from the middle to the end. Finishes with a biscuity malt aftertaste.  Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation.

35,102,TheSarge,4.02,"Being stationed in Korea, it's a treat to be able to sample something different once in a while. Thankfully the on base liquor store (Class 6) carries Samuel Adams, and occasionally seasonals. Finally Octoberfest made its appearance on the shelves of our ill equipped Class 6.  This smells of a rich malt character. A slight amount of hop aroma, but mostly dominated by malt. Blended together it kind of has an orangish fragrance.  Samuel Adams Octoberfest is a bit darker compared to Boston Lager. It has a deep copper color and the body of this brew is very clear. It pours with moderate amount of CO2 and forms for a good top and leaves behind fine to no lacing.  This tastes a little hoppy, but finishes sweet. Not a bad balance of the two main characters.  Overall this feels very refreshing and quite bubbly and is quite comparable to Boston Lager but with a little bit sweeter balance of malts.

Not very helpful. This years Octoberfest beers have been out for a while though, so hopefully this one is this year's model. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Rich copper in color. Initially a decent head, but that falls quickly to just a skim coat of foam on the beer.  Smell: A little bit of malt with some hints of grassiness.  Taste: Pretty bland overall, not what I was expecting from a Marzen. There is a very low sweetness level, none of the malty, syrupy, sweetness I have found in the German examples of this brew. The hop bitterness is also higher than I have found in other Marezens.  Mouthfeel: Medium level of carbonation.  Drinkability: Overall, not too bad to drink, it just doesn't taste like a Marzen. The sweetness is too low and the hop bitterness is too high.

35,102,ThaSmokinGun,3.76,"I was at Oktoberfest in 2004, hit a bunch of tents (including Paulaner), and I have to say that the best bier that year was in the Hacker tent (Hacker and Pschorr have two different tents and two different beers).  That being said, this is the 2nd best Oktoberfest bier I've had. It is hopped a little more crisply than the German versions, but the malt flavor is spot on. This beer loses its head much more quickly than the German ones did, but they don't have much head either. I'd expect to see about a 3/8"" to 1/2"" on a liter mug.  Mouthfeel is pretty much the same as what I remember from Oktoberfest, but maybe slightly thinner. Or that could just be my mind playing tricks on me. Either way, pretty .... close to style in my mind.  Drinkability is about the same as the Hacker Oktoberfest. Make sure you designate a driver or bring a 6 pack home :)  To me, the extra hops are not an issue, and this is better than the Paulaner Oktoberfest.

Appearance is a bright, coppery amber color, full foamy finger of light tan head that slowly fell to a light ring of lacing. Aroma is rich with a huge maltiness, sweet caramel and toffee notes dominating, light hoppy undertones round out the nose. Taste is very malty, much more than from the bottle, light grassy hop bitterness halfway balances between the superb malt character this beer offers. Mouthfeel is smoother and seemingly less carbonated than that of the bottle, a welcome change as the balance of the light to medium body pairs well with the lower levels of carbonation.

T-Had a good taste to it with just a hint of toffee flavoring. Couldn't really pick it out though. Never got that nasty taste but nothing special to write about. A little on the bitter side.  M-Very light mouthfeel, no warming sensation or anything to note. Amazingly felt like a light beer.  D-Had a few brats with this and it makes a great pairing.

Smell - not much smell, some ""typical"" beer smell; no fruit scents or hops scents  Taste - different; I've never had anything with a flavor comparable to this before; malt is definitely the dominant flavor; not much hops, yet it has a nice bitterness to it; I guess I could compare it to an unhoppy Rogue American Amber Ale, but a little watered down; nonetheless, the taste is pretty good  Mouthfeel - great, medium to light bodied  Drinkability - excellent; I drank three in one night  Overall this is a good beer that I want to have more so I can try and pick out some distinguishing flavors.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Jason,3.73,"12 oz brown bottle with a freshness date.  A- Tight collar of tan lace stays true, vibrant yet rustic tawny color ... good clarity.  S- Nice malty aroma, toasted bread with light sweetness and faint herbal hop.  T&M- Very malty, not overly sweet. Lots of bready notes, lightly toasted crust comes to mind. Kiss of hops to balance, slight herbal flavor. Finishes semi-sweet with a lingering maltiness.  D- A tasty choice this year, its good to have a fresh O-fest rather than getting burned by a stale imported O-fest that has been sitting around since last year. A great contrast to some crab cakes with some homemade spicy remoulade sauce.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CharlieMopps,3.08,"A: Copper reddish brown color when poured. Very little to show for head or its retention, as well as miniscule lace on the first few sips.  S: Somewhat rich and toasty malt aromas, which contrast with a hint of spice and sweetness.  T: Carbonation got in the way of what could be a better malt-heavy beer. The taste comes through, but mostly toward the middle-end after a light introduction. However, the toasty notes leave a more pleasant aftertaste, but begin to dull a bit.  M: Tasted a little too carbonated, which curled the tongue and hurt the immediate finish. This made it light-tasting, it seems. On tap this felt even worse, but out of the bottle it was slightly more bearable.  D: Probably good for a couple rounds, but after a while, the composition of this beer can make it tough to go through the cyclical carbonated taste and lack of spontaneity in the flavor.   A little too... middle-of-the-road, I'd say. I was expecting something better from this seasonal due to the good things I've heard through word-of-mouth, but in the end was slightly disappointed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A slight aftertaste, not bad  M- a little thin but smooth, OK  D- generally good but I wouldn't want more than a couple of these at once  All in all a decent beer.

Alcohol is present as well as some fruit sweetness. Pretty balanced as the hops bite in when the malt gets to be too much and both fade together to give it smooth finsh with only a slight aftertaste of caramel malt. Good body  D- Not bad but not ground breaking either. I have had better versions locally than this and I still would prefer some of the Munich versions as well. They keep tweeking this and they are gradually removing the over-sweet character every try but haven't gotten it just right yet. It also seems to get more avergae every year too.

Light smells of malt and warm spices. Taste focuses, too, on the malt. Hints of caramel. Not as strong as it could be, but very refreshing.

I found this beer to be a very average beer and was left wondering why there was so many forum posts lauding this as the best Oktoberfest beer. Other then the color of the beer, nothing else about it would make me believe this was an Oktoberfest style beer, and I would be more apt to call it a generic dark beer. Color was a medium to dark brown with a thin head. I found the beer to seem somewhat watery and very light in terms of mouthfeel. Aroma had mild hops, and the flavor was much the same. All in all, a pretty average brew that doesn't live up to the hype. I regret to say, this was the worst beer I had at the Oktoberfest but was the one I was really looking forward to trying.

35,102,becktone,3.8,"With fall on the way and summer coming close to an end some of my favorite seasonals begin to emerge. With the weather cooling down Octoberfests and Pumpkin Ales begin to become more and more appealing. I thought that I'd give this beer another try and in turn review it again, now that my appreciation and taste for beer has grown.  The color of this beer is a beautiful crystal clear copper. Kind of like the color of some of the Autumn Leaves that drift by my window. Although the leaves are still green now, the color of this beer reminds me of those falling leaves. Head starts off at two fingers, somewhat off white and creamy in appearance. Lacing is fair. Head retention is somwhat poor. The head slowly decreases in size.  Aroma of this beer is also quite good. It is very potent, as soon as the bottle was opened the boquet of aroma hit me in the face. There's not that many beers that I've had where the aroma is that strong and appealing. It seems that more often than not one has to try to find the aroma, searching for it. Not so with this beer. To the nose it is malty sweet smelling of caramel and a hint of spicy noble hop character.  This beer in my opinion is definitely better on the colder side. The flavors just seem to come out better. Noticeable in the flavor are caramaly and some spicy herbal characteristics. Bittering hops do a nice job of balancing the brew out, keeping the malty and caramel flavors in check.  This beer is smooth and well rounded. It goes down easy and is very drinkable. Its got a medium body although it seems a bit thin. Carbonation is in check, appropriate for the style. This would make for a good session beer were the alcohol a bit lower. A good beer to drink once a year, but with so many others out there of the same style with the same limitability it seems unlikely that I'll buy this beer again this season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Being from Boston its only natural to try Sam Adams, althouh I am not sure if this is brewed in JP or the mid-west, but I digress. The appearance is dark golden color, and the smell is a nice malty fragrance. The taste is a bit astringent, not sure why. The puckery feel kinda overwhelms whatever maltiness the brewer was trying to convey. While not a bad beer, its not quite what I was expecting, and its not something I will get on a regular basis. I will try again, just to make sure it was not the batch.

The nose was of biscut, no descernable hops (as I assume is how this should go). Taste was simple, and enjoyable. Sweet and smooth, with a mouthfeel slightly lighter than I'd like, although not far enough off as for me to use ""watery"" to describe it. The finish is warm and smooth.

There was pretty decent lacing...more than I expected, and it stuck around for the duration of the beer.  Smell is all sweet, with caramel and toasted malts being the dominant smells. It definitely smells like an American style fall beer. In the mouth, this felt a bit watery, and there was a pretty strong tingle from the carbnoation.  Tastewise, this is pretty indicitive of the style. Lots of sweetness, with just enough hop to keep you drinking. There is a noticably buttery flavor aside from the usual sources of sweetness, and a slightly dry aftertaste with an almost veggy like flavor throughout. Not sure if I'd have more than 2-3 of these because of the sweetness. Personally, I'd like a bit mroe hop action on the back end, but maybe that's just not the style.

The light touch of ethanol is quite nice. Low hop aroma.  mouthfeel: The carbonation rides the border between medium and high, and is smooth. The body is medium. Instead of being slick after the swallow, the finish is nice and clean, which I appreciate.  taste: Nice blend of malts give subtle notes of caramel and some woody earthiness.

35,102,NeroFiddled,4.1,"Update from previous review: It's been 5 years since I first reviewed this beer. I've had it now and again, without issue, but I'm not so happy with this year's batch. I've had it several times and it just doesn't sit right. It's darker with more caramel notes, the hops lack character (probably just an actual hop crop issue), and the bitterness is seemingly a touch high. I see how it fits within the ""Oktoberfest/Märzen"" style, but with the addition of more caramel character it doesn't even suggest Munich malts, it just seems like an amber lager to me. On to my previous review...  Sam Adam's always delivers, so when I went to pick up an Octoberfest (OKtoberfest with a K is actually trademarked in Germany, so kudos to Sammy for the ""C"") this year I naturally gravitated towards them. Some of the O'fests from Germany have been getting weaker and weaker and more watered down over the years. Hell, some of them are gold in color!  It has a great appearance with a clear, orange and gold accented copper that just 'looks like fall'. It's got great head retention and it leaves some very nice lacing behind.  The nose is clean and fresh with some delicate, caramelish and toasty malt.  The flavor offers all of the soft, bready, and lightly toasty malt that you'd expect with a touch of tea-like and mildly floral hops to lend it some character. The bitterness is present but unassuming; and it finishes fairly short and dry. More importantly, it's remarkably clean, fresh tasting, and superbly balanced.  The mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a medium body and restrained, moderate carbonation that help to accentuate its malt.  It's refined. It has finesse. It's remarkably drinkable. There are other, more fully flavored fests out there, but I'm not sure any of them have quite the same quaffability that Sammy offers.

Cinnamon orange in color, this had a 1/2 finger head that didn't stick around too long. If it had a green head it would look just like a pumpkin.  Smelled weakly of pumpkin pie filling and spices. I gave it a fairly low score in the smell department not because I didn't like the smell, but simply because there wasn't much of it. I couldn't really smell much besides the very faint pumpkiny spice and a little bit of hoppy zest.  Tastes pretty damn good! Raw pumkin pie filling, spiced pumkin bread, orange rind. This is more heavily hopped than I would have expected. IMO it had a pale ale quality to it, but with autumnal pumkin spice. Mouthfeel is light to medium and carbonation is adequate but on the lighter side.  This is a great fall beer that I will surely have again! This tastes more like pumpkins than the Blue Moon pumpkin ale I had the other night.  Note: I picked up another sixer of this 9/9/07, and I'm convinced that while it's a great session beer and a good stab at one of my favorite styles.

35,102,beerogre,4.68,"I'm not sure what it is about this beer, but I have a great affection for it. It's probably something to do with the fact that when I first came to the US from England and discovered American beer wasn't just all Budweiser and Miller, Sam Adams was the first good beer I was introduced to and then shortly afterwards when the Octoberfest seasonal was released for that year, it really was an exciting time as the realisation dawned that here was a whole new continent of beer waiting to be discovered. The gateway to a new world indeed.  I have sampled many great beers since then and continue to do so, and yet Sam Adams Octoberfest continues to be one of my favourites.  Like the ornithologist who spots the first migrant birds arriving, every year around this time it lights up my day when I spot the familiar orange packaging on the otherwise bland Central Florida supermarket beer aisle shelves. Every year I buy a case and consume it over the next few months, and then I forget about it again until about this time, when once more I enjoy the clean, crisp, refreshing taste that makes this beer.  I think this would probably be my session beer of choice if I was forced to nominate one. It's a beer I could just go on drinking forever, quite easily. A simply fantastic creation.  Incidentally, I first spotted this beer at the end of August this year, which is the earliest I recall, as I normally notice its arrival sometime in September. No complaints here though. None at all.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Tastes sweet with raisen and floral essence. Brown sugar and caramel notes as well. Quite smooth on the pallate but I couldn't drink this consistently because of the sweetness. I like it but not in great amounts.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Hop bouquet is fresh in the nose as well.  The taste is sweet malt to start, but blances well with the hops after a few seconds. Rich and toasted, with the sweetnes lingering in the back of your palate as you continually drink this beer.  The body is medium, and the carbonation somewhat light. Finishes clean, and very easy to down.  Nearly 5 years ago, back in college I tried this beer one fateful night, and entered the world of craft beer advocacy.  You never forget your first.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,akahn,3.8,"This beer pours a deep red-copper color with a creamy, dense head. Mildly malty aroma with notes of noble hops. Taste follows through with a slightly sweet malty palate, pleasantly bready, along with earthy, spicy, leafy hops. This beer finishes grainier, on the dry side. Overall, quite solid. Medium body with ample carbonation, goes down real, real easy. One of the better beers that are this widely available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,doppelmeup,4.03,"Poured a deep amber color into a pint glass with a thick, half inch head. Decent lacing. Looks very much like a Marzen.  Aromas of malt, brown sugar. Reminds me of a doppelbock.  Taste is on the sweet side. Very malty, brown sugar, some toffee. Flavor is also similar to a doppelbock.  Thick, hearty mouthfeel. Smooth with nice finish.

A - Reddish orange with a light off-white head to start. S - Very light aroma - light hops and malt / grain T - Bottle advertises caramel and tofee. Sorry, not much if any of that IMO. Basically this tastes as it smells. Very mild for an octoberfest. M - By the color and head I would've expected medium bodied. I'd rate this as light. D - Nice, light easy drinking octoberfest.

I find the color striking.  Smell: Some malt and nutmeg aromas, but fairly clean as a lager, with some noble hops in the background.  Taste: At first my friend and I were surprised at how little flavor we were getting out of this one. It tasted almost watery - after warming in the glass for a bit, though, flavor finally started to come out and continued to improve down to the bottom of the glass. Definitely don't serve this one at refrigerator temperatures. Malt is the big stand out, of course, with some earthiness, and a very clean finish. Somewhat toasty, with enough hops to balance the malts.  Mouthfeel: Fairly light mouthfeel, good carbonation.  Drinkability: Pretty high, but not my favorite of the Sam Adams lineup. Didn't meet my expectations, at least.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Light floral hops? T-Sweeter maltier taste. Not much hop taste at all if any. Bit of caramel or something around that in the taste. Light bitterish aftertaste. Crisp but bit sticky. M- Thin body. Medium carbonation but on higher side. D- Doesn't touch the Spaten Oktoberfest.

Like sourness. Cant realy place what it is. Smells toasty. Not totally bad, but not great either.  T: Mmmm this is a good beer. A very sweet taste upfront with hints of sweet camrmel and a little toastyness. The hops kick in mildly as a back thought of the profile. I like it. Probally my favorite Sam Adams.  M: A nice carbonated medium bodied feel. A tad syrupy, but I think the carbonationg is just right for the style.  D: Good but tough to drink more than one. The sweetness is overpowering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

It gets a 2.5 because no smell is better than a bad smell.  T- light, nice crispness to it. It was a refreshing clean taste. But where is the malt flavor and the hop bitterness? This is supposed to be an octoberfest beer.  M- a bit to watery for my liking  D- an easy drinking beer to say the least. Could have had more to it though. Very refreshing, but lacking any semblance of complexity.  Notes- back when I fisrt got into craft beer a year or so ago. This was one of my favorite beers. My palate has changed a great deal, because this beer did not have much going on.

Smell, you have to really stick your nose into the glass and take a big wiff to at least smell somthing in there, sweet malt small with a bit of some citrus back smell as well. Taste is pretty good this goes down very smooth, has a bit to much carbonation but not over bearing.

Sessionable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,hckyfn9999,4.27,Nice orangish brown color with a creamy white head. Smell is sweet like carmel. I can also detect smells of bread.

Good effort by Boston Beer Company.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Tastes of malty grains. Bread and some hops are mixed in. It seems, to me, to be a maltier, sweeter version of a Sam Adams lager (not just an amber ale with some caramel maltiness as some craft brews do).   It's fairly smooth, but a bit too sweet for a ""session"". Although not quite in the same category as a Bavarian O-fest in Germany, it has a freshness to it, and is one of the better of the style that is available in America that hasn't been sitting in who knows what conditions to arrive here. A bit better on tap, IMO.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,AWolfAtTheDoor,3.08,"I drank it out out of a pint glass poured from a 12 oz. bottle. The best thing this beer has going for it is its taste. The color is intriguing. Pours the color that everyone else has said, orange/amber combination. Taste is not bad at all. This is the first beer of this style that I have tried, so I'm not sure how to describe it. But it does taste a bit ""weak"" if that makes sense. Not watery in the sense of a macro, but it could definitely use a stronger presense. But what taste is there, is good. Like many other have said, I wouldn't go way out of my way to drink this, but it is fairly drinkable, and does taste good for what it is.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Sweet malt, orange, bread  T. Sweet malt, caramel, orange peel, bread, lightly hopped with a slight alcohol finish.  M. Nice palate, could have used slightly more carbonation for my taste.  D. Very smooth taste and a good flavor create a highly drinkable brew.  This is a decent Oktoberfest, which could be much better with some improvements.

Can't compare to previous years, as this typically sells out quite quickly in Joplin Missouri and this is the first year I've been lucky enough to get ahold of some.  That being said this very very fresh sample is quite the drinker.  The appearance is a lovely deep amber, the head at first fairly thick but it tends to die down rather quickly. There is however lace left throughout most of the glass.  Their's a fefinite malty smell and I can sense some spice as well. Above average smelling beer in each and every way.  There's a sweetness to the taste and some caramel as well. All in all it's quite delicious.

This beer has a very nice taste of malts with a hint of bitterness, but the only drawback is a metallic-like after taste. The mouthfeel mainly is brought about by the carbonation that is pleasant but feels like something is lacking. A relatively drinkable brew, but if looking for a session I would choose another. A decent brew, but Sam Adams is capable of better.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell: Has a nice aroma of grains, spices, oranges, and malt. Very nice and balanced.  Taste: The beer has a nicely balanced and somewhat complex taste of grains, hops, toasted malts, hops, spices, and fruits (such as oranges). Aftertaste is mostly the oranges and hops.  Mouthfeel: Mostly smooth and medium-bodied; has a bit of chewyness to the texture. Mild carbonation.  Drinkability: Moderate ABV and the smoothness and flavor make this a rather drinkable beer.  Overall a nice Oktoberfest beer with a good flavor and nice smell. Flavor seems a bit low in the malt department, though. Considering how available this is, it's certainly something to try.

35,102,jokelahoma,4.08,"Pours a deep, deep copper, with tinges of red. Largish eggshell colored head is tight, and lasts a good long while.  The smell is good, sweet malt, through and through, with emphasis on sweet. There's a musty earthiness to the aroma as well, one that adds to the appeal of the beer. Just the slightest hint that there may be some hoppiness to it. Otherwise, all malt. Delicious!  Quite sweet up front on the tongue. Tastes of whole grain breads straight from the oven, perhaps with the fruit jam thrown in for good measure. Very smooth, with no bite to it whatsoever, neither from the hops nor from the carbonation. There's just enough of a hop presence to even out the finish and prevent it becoming too sweet. An oiliness coats the inside of your mouth after each drink. It doesn't seem to distract rom the beer in any way, however. It simply allows you to savor each sip awhile after it's gone, holding that hop bitterness to dry out the taste and make you want more. This is nice. Not as much ""oomph"" from the malt as one might want from a Oktoberfest, but very nice none the less.  The mouthfeel, as stated above, is thick and somewhat oily. This is far heartier than the '05 version, and I like it.  I'd have upped the drinkability but for the oily finish. While it doesn't take away from the beer overall, it does seem to add to a perception of fullness, which holds the beer back.  Overall, this is nicely done. An Oktoberfest which is equal parts accessible and hearty. I'd recommend it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,yelterdow,4.65,"Very fresh bottle- just released this week, with a February 2007 date notched on the label. Sampled on 8/17/06 at fridge temperature in a pint glass.  Appearance- Beautiful clear, caramel orange beer that supports a soapy, resilient three finger head. The bubbles pop and fizz slowly down, leaving behind surprisingly good lacing. Looks great.  Smell- Wow... what a drastic improvement over what I remember about last year's version! A big, cookie-like breadiness stands tall and provides a welcome alternative to the usual caramel/Vienna malt notes of this style.  Taste- A remarkable balance of bready, cakey malts and just the right amount of hops come together for a most impressive Octoberfest style beer. It's the perfect marriage of full-bodied, Autumn-like flavors with an incredibly effortless context.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Maybe it's because this just hit the stores... but this beer is dazzling in the mouth. Absolutely perfect carbonation; a long and exquisite length of activity on the tongue... I could drink this all night.  This year's Samuel Adams Octoberfest is outstanding, and without question the best of show for this style I've yet tried.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

I get some spice on the nose, as well as malt and a tiny amount of hops. There's also a little breadyness there too. When I taste this, I get the breadyness again, with some malty sweetness. There's a kind of fruityness to it as well, that goes hand in hand with the spice. This doesn't finish clean, there's a viscosity that lingers that makes it hard to drink more than one.

A bit early, it seems, but with the temperatures in the mid 60's for the last few days, drinking an Oktoberfest seems pretty appropriate.  A: Pours a rich orange-amber. One finger of off-white head (a bit creamier looking than just white head) and it had decent staying power. Light lacing once it did bubble out.  S: Rich and malty. Has some spice at the front of the nose, and a touch of buttered toast.  T: Sweet at the front, with some pumpin and nutmeg spiciness in the middle coupled with a biscuity flavor. Finish is lightly bitter with a warm toastyness.  M: A bit buttery, but otherwise medium-bodied.  D: It's not terribly refreshing, so a chilly fall day is about the only time this sounds appealing to me.

Has an earthy malt nose with some green grassy hops and alcohol as well.Kind of nutty, roasty and not too sweet overall.  Bisquity and doughy is the malt with a light spicy sweetness that is quickly extinguished by the bitter hops. Pretty tasty with a slight warmth from the alcohol.

It mixes perfectly with the layers of red and orange and brown that carry through the air, with a taste full of spice (lots of cinnamon and nutmeg and pumpkin). Should be served a little bit warmer than one might be used to, just to evoke the harvest flavors.  Color's a nice golden tan with a nose that betrays the somewhat syrupy sweetness that follows up the first wave of taste.  Overall, Sam does a good job capturing Boston's fall in a bottle.

Even though it is currrently March. A aggressive pour resulted in a thick head that has dissipated rather quickly. The smell kindly set you back a little. It is a bit strong. The taste is of spices.

Has that standard 'Sam Adams' smell of noble hops. Not hugely aromatic.  T - malt, again, predominates. Malty sweetness with some astringency from roasted malts. Noble hop spiciness in the aftertaste. Tartness at the end. Somewhat smoky - munich malt?  M - on the thin side. Carbonation level fairly high for this style, IMHO. Tickles the tongue just a bit.

A friend of mine who is not a big beer drinker (much-less craft beer), fell in love with this and now she is becoming an enlighten convert. Point is; this is a very inoffensive, easily approachable beer that (I believe) will satisfy most palates to an acceptable degree, making this a perfect choice for taking to parties with macro-drinking friends. On to the break down:  Appearance: Pours a coppery amber with a slightly golden orange hue to it. Magnificent head.  Smell: Full, thick, malty sweet aroma. Strong suggestions of caramel and subtle hints of fruits. There is something else in the aroma that I think smells like pumpkin.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Extremely foamy, thick sweet malty feeling and tasting. Very nice and easy drinking. It is not too sweet but plenty sweet enough. There are also a hand full of spices, not the most complex Octoberfest Ive ever had but this is certainly an easy drinking one!  Drinkability: This is a particularly easy drinking beer.

It strikes me as a great session beer if you are looking to do some crushing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Jarod,3.78,"This beer poured a golden orange color which seemed to glow, it was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was produced was tight and compact, off white /cream in color and about 1 1/2 inches thick and well lasting. There was a nice sheety lace left behind that lasted to the end of the glass. The aromas were not as strong as I would have thought and liked, but noticable and pleasing, I nosed lots of rich and sweet malts, spices and some light hops. The tastes were more pronounced, ton of mixing malts and spices, from sweet malts to rich malts and defined spices, caramels, and some notes of dark fruit (as it warmed), hints of hops (mostly a spicey hop, but slight floral became noticable as it warmed) swirled in and out near the middle and end of the swallow and turned to a dry hop flavor as a last taste down the throat. Some malty aftertaste and dry hops were left. The body was light medium, not as thick compared to others of this style I have had. Drinkable and worth a try every year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The taste is sweet malt, a bit grassy, and toasty. Slight hop flavor with bitterness. It's a pretty good beer. I like other Oktoberfests more, but it's quite drinkable. But nothing remarkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,JISurfer,3.43,"This is what I call my old stand by Oktoberfest. It's definately a good example of the style, especially for a mass produced beer. I personally have used this one as a ""gateway"" beer on some of my friends who just drink Coors Light, Natty, and such swill as that. All of them pretty much enjoy this one.  It's got a nice little creamy head on it that has some retention, but not too much. The taste is definately a bit better this year, with a more abundance of caramel, roasted malts, and some light fruits intertwined. The past few years for this beer have been rather ho-hum, with faintness abound. Overall, this years brew of Oktoberfest is definately a great step in the right direction.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,SkeeterHawk,3.2,"Appearance: Pours a clear deep reddish orange color with a two-inch off white head made up of small bubbles. The head lasted about a minute, and didnt have too many bubbles rising to maintain the head.  Aroma: Floral hops with a bit of toast are the first things you notice about the aroma.  Taste: There is a bit of an assertive hop presence in this beer that is far from your typical Octoberfest beer. There is a small amount of the toasty malt in there, but it is most obscurred by the hops. The body is medium light with a finish that is slightly balanced toward the sweet malt. No alcohol noticeable the entire time.  Opinion: Well...its not contaminated or anything. This is not what I would call an Octoberfest beer. It is more of a cross between a Northern Pilsner (Hop presence in flavor), and a mild Munich Dunkel (Light bittering hops for finish). Its not a bad tasting beer, but it is rather uneventful and disappointing in the malt aspects. The hops are too aggressive to, I guess, try and make up for the lack of malt. Its OK...just not to style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,ColForbin,3.8,"Sam Adams Octoberfest is a staple session beer for me in the fall - you can find it everywhere, and it is usually on sale. It pours a crystal clear orange-red with a slightly tan head that is fairly large and fluffy at first, but quickly fades to a thin coating on top of the beer. Aroma is malt sweetness, with some caramel notes and a twinge of spicy hops. Flavor is very malty and sweet, a bit too sweet for my liking, with some nutty flavors as well. Slightly cloying sweetness in the finish, with a bit of hops. All in all, a solid fall seasonal and a good session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

A good beer that makes me want to try others of this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Backer2004,3.65,"I figured this one wouldn't be on draft too much longer and the choices weren't too tempting anyway, so why not. This Octoberfest is worth trying, but nothing to rave about. Nice copper, orange color with a small head and lacing. A nice bit of spiciness reminds me their Winter Warmer that will be showing up soon (a much better choice). This one took me a while to finish. I'm not too big a fan of this style anyway.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Jacobier10,3.8,"Pours a deep orange/amber color with a small head. Little lacing is left behind but the head disappates fairly rapidly. Malty aroma that is not overpowering. The taste is full of roasted and caramel malts. The balance is thrown a little towards the malty side, however the hops are still noticable. Slightly dry, bitter mouthfeel keeps this from being an outstanding session brew. I always look forward to this brew when the fall season comes rolling around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,redwolf1,3.23,"A-Appearance is a nice rich copper with very little head that basically disappeared after I poured it. No lacing what so ever. S-There is a subtle spiciness, probably from the hops, that can be detected with hints of maltball. T&M-As for taste and feel, I must say it goes down smooth, rather syrupy-like or even molasses-like. Remaining flavors after one takes a sip remain around the edge of the tongue as opposed to darker, stronger beers, which can overwhelm the tastebuds and attack the back of the throat. D-Sam Adams Octoberfest is a very drinkable beer with a nice toasty finish. Not overly strong based on the mild hops, which allows one to get through a six pack. Though for some, the malt flavor may be a drawback after a couple of beers. After a few, it may come across as fairly heavy. Nevertheless, it is one of the better Octoberfests for the price in my opinion, granted I got this bottle from a buddy of mine. Apparently, Sam Adams Octoberfest is bought up pretty fast in my area, just another testament to its own drinkability.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Decent retention but nothing spectacular.  Smell: Sweet malty nose wtih gobs of toffee and a touch of toast. The smell is rich and inviting with a thick bready quality to it.  Taste and Feel: Sweet opening with a chewy malt character. Light toffee, caramel, toast and a smattering of esters. The middle is slightly sour and dry but tasty and comfortable. White peppercorns and a bit of butteriness. The sweetness carries nicely through the whole beer while never approaching any cloying. Medium body and crisp. As it warms more of the spice flavors develop. Nutmeg, allspice, and clove.  Drinkability: Well balanced and very pleasant. Clean maltiness balanced with spicy flavors make this a very tasty and enjoyable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Thanks to Jason for sharing this bottle.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Dukeofearl,3.85,"Pours a medium reddish amber with very little carbonation. Aroma is slightly sweet maltiness, caramel. The slightest of hops is there, very gentle, wafting through the dominant malts. The flavor follows through, and I believe the best desription is tha flavors of King's Hawaiian Bread. And that's a compliment- I love that bread! It's moderately dense, sweet, and chewy- the bread that is. But it's also a pretty good description of this beer. Pretty simple in its composition- I'm not spending much time trying figure out what that flavor is halfway through the swallow. Real basic. I like it. Very easy drinking, and enjoyable on a cool night.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jakester,3.48,"This is from a case I bought at Shelbourne Beer Distributor. I drank it in a pilsner glass. Expiry date clearly notched on the label.  Pours a very clear darkish copper with a one finger head of beige bubbles with a rough pour. Carbonation looks medium. The head quickly falls to islands and a ring, with only traces of lacing. Almost all SA beers have a good head; this one does not.  Aroma is bready and faintly sweet, with a gentle note of spicy noble hops. Smells are good, but faint.  First flavor is caramely bready malts, with a touch of Munich malt thrown in there. There is a soft hop bitterness, and a hint of spicy hops. Flavor is a little lacking, but it's not bad. The aftertaste is very short, and kind of disappointing.  Mouthfeel is a little thin for an Octoberfest, IMO. Carbonation is soft to medium. Finish is short and slightly sweet.  This isn't a bad beer, and I would get it again, but I think it could be so much more. The aromas and flavors are good, but there aren't enough of them present. It would be a really good session beer. Recommended, with reservations.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,TurdFurgison,3.31,"Had on tap at a seafood restaurant in CT. Dark amber color with kind of minimal head.  The flavor reminded me of Gordon Biersch (spelling?) Marzen. To be honest, it was kind of lame for an Oktoberfest. Not bad with a meal, and better than most other beers available at this restaurant. But nothing special really.  I guess this is OK if nothing else is available. Better than going macro in any case...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The beer poured a deep burnt orange color with a small head that faded quickly. The aroma is of grain malts with just a hint of hops. The taste is the same, almost all malt with some hops, a good balance IMO.  Overall, this is a good Oktoberfest beer to get if you can't find anything else. Nothing special here, but at the same time not disappointing either.

35,102,Fish113d,3.57,"Served from a chilled bottle into a tulip glass.  Note** Let me say that I rather enjoy Sam Adams brews and this review is not a way of trying to take a shot at them.  Appearance is dark copper color w/ a slightly tan 1/4"" head that quickly turns to squat on top of my brew. Not real excited.  Aroma is sour and tart along with some slight apple sweetness and some slight hops. NOt real impressed here. I may also taste just a bit of spice in there toward the finish.  Sipping, I taste some slight orange flavor as well as some apple crispness flavors. A bit more bitter hops expected, that never came. Kinda watery.  Feel up front was of sharp carbonation that felt like needles on my tongue. Body was rather light and watery which didn't tickle my fancy too much. I expected a little more flavor, but it wasn't there.  Overall, if you want a very easy to drink 'Fest, this is it. However, you're not getting anything exciting IMO, and it is rather disappointing. I actually love Sam Adams brews, but this one is lacking almost all around. A shame really.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,sulldaddy,3.73,"I am drinking a cold bottle in a pint glass. The beer pours a clear copper color with an off white fizzy and spongy head of 2 cm foaming up. Aroma is grainy malt and caramel with a hint of earthy and spicy hops. The first sip reveals an average body with fine yet fizzy carbonation. Overall the texture is refreshing and crisp. Flavor starts caramel sweet with a bit of graininess as well. There is just a hint of fruitiness in the middle,while the finish is slightly spicy hops with a bit of a drying effect. This beer is VERY easy to drink and quite refreshing. A nice seasonal and a good beer to introduce folks to a new style IMO.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,unknownlamer,2.83,"This is boring. Drinkable, but definitely boring. The smell is kind of weak with just a bit of a malty smell and a slight hint of spicy hops. It really does taste like a bit stronger and more bitter version of the Boston Lager. The hops have a bit of a nice spicy bite, but there isn't really much of a malt backbone (which I thought was part of the Märzen style...). I'd take a Märzhon or an Old Dominion Octoberfest over this any day.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell is faint, sweet camelized malt and faint hops. The taste is nice, sweet, with a mild hop finish. The carbonation bites a little on this one, maybe too much. The mouthfeel is smooth and decent, not overly full more watery than I would have thought. This one is an easily drinkable beer in quantity and will be fun to take to a gathering this weekend.

Sam's offering has a terrific rich, reddish amber color and a respectable head that had some staying power. For me, the smell was a little too sweet but also has more of a malty backing instead of grainy, which is a plus. The taste is strong and bitey but not overpowering. A quality hop count is present and accounted for as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth and a little creamy. This is a pretty impressive specimen. It's nice to know Sam can still make a quality product when he wants to.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ski271,2.97,"Pours a dark copper with a small, frothy, light tan head that slowly diminishes to a film. Lacing is initially large but does not have the staying power as it slides back down to beer level before your next sip. The smell is malt-dominant and sweet with aromas of caramel, toffee, grass and a light fruitiness. The taste follows suit with the malts taking centre stage. Hrm. It starts out with a nice chewy malt flavor supported by a light herbal bitterness, but it turns a bit thin in the middle. A little honey and savory show up briefly. The slightly bitter finish is below average, with very little appealing flavors lingering. I wasnt impressed by this one. Its not bad, but Ive had several better this year. Doubt Ill get this one again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,danielharper,2.97,"Purchased from Great Spirits, Huntsville, AL.  Pours a deep reddish hue with a nicely-colored dark off-white head on top. The head is thick at first, but dissipates very quickly, often not lasting more than a minute or so. The dark red liquid is completely transparent, with no haze or yeast present.  The smell is decent enough, if somewhat underwhelming. Very malty overall nose, reminding me more of a dopplebock than most of the other Octoberfests I've tried, with hints of apple, licorice, and just a touch of coffee. Unlike other Sam Adams brews, this has virtually no hop presence at all.  The taste here is decent enough, with some hops breaking through on the palate even though they were missing on the nose, and with a sort of fruity backwash that hits the tongue upon swirling the beer around in the mouth. An interesting yeast must have been used, here, because it has an aftertaste that I don't really recognize from anything else, and which I cannot really describe to any realistic degree. Leaves an impression on the back of the tongue.  Mouthfeel is watery, but with carbonation that seems to kick me in the teeth as I drink it. Doesn't really give me anything to hold on to, and I find myself taking large swallows of this beer rather than sipping and savoring it.  Overall drinkability is fairly low, for I really don't like it all that much, and find myself wishing that I had something a little better. Sam Adams can be very hit-or-miss on their beers, and for me this one is a definite miss, even if it's only a slight one. It's decent enough to drink if it's about the only thing available, but I don't think I'm going to buy another sixer of these.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Blossoming notes of pale roasted malts and sweet caramel hovering over a faint fruity spiciness. Very intriguing and inviting.  There's the healthy malt presence I was hoping for. Nice balance of sweet (very faint) toffeeish and (stronger) caramel malts sharing its space with a delicate dryness provided by a well placed hop profile. Very clean and fresh flavors that don't struggle for attention.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Soft, medium body with just enough fine carbonation to provide an airy, fluffy mouthfeel. Delicate dry finish that finishes very clean.  Drinkability is also excellent. Not at all filling with enough flavors to satisfy vets and beginners alike.  Overall I was very impressed with this 'Octoberfest'. Dry enough to distinguish itself from the sometimes confusing Amber style and enough of a malt presence to stand next to the best of them. Good interpretation of a delicate and easy to foul-up style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell: a sweet hop smell is first thing I notice followed by a clean and delicious smelling malt.  Taste: I really like the taste of this beer. It is maltier than it smells. The hops are not very bitter and tastes a little citrus like.  Mouthfeel: very good and refreshing. medium body. It is just meaty enough to feel like a real beer while staying refreshing and easily drinkable. I could drink this all day.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Roasted malt and cascade hop aromas. Sweet roasted flavor, caramel and a balanced hop pressence that carry over into a bittersweet aftertaste. Finishes with some residual sweetness, but quite drinkable.

35,102,JayQue,3.94,This beer is a very nice orange/amber color with an impressive white head that lingers down to the last drop. It leaves lacing up and down the glass. The smell is pleasant but mild. The only other Fest/Marzen beer I have tried is the Weeping Radish Fest Amber Lager The Sam Adams is much more full bodied (although still a fairly light beer). This beer tastes better than the Fest and does not leave the metallic aftertaste I noticed with the Fest. Light beer...good taste...good mouthfeel...no unusual after-taste. Sounds like something I could deal with in mass quantities. I would order this one at an Oktoberfest and look forward to finishing the rest of the 6 pack.

I smelled a very floral smell to the hops, and a nice sweet malt. I picture, like a Bugs Bunny cartoon, little fingers of scent beckoning me towards the beer as I lift off my feet and float towards it. Yummy!  The taste was very sweet, almost syrupy, with a nice balance of hops. My only disappointment was that it wasn't as full-bodied as some of the other Oktoberfests I've been quaffing, like the Hacker-Pschorr. Sam Adams always crafts a great beer, but their last few seasonals have been, I think, maybe ""dumbed-down"" just a little bit for the general masses. A little watery and not as full-bodied as the past. But hey...I ain't gonna kick it out of my fridge, you know!  Mouthfeel, again, was a bit watery, but on the up-side, it didn't leave that high-alcohol feel on my tongue that other beers of its alcohol level can sometimes do.  Drinkability: absolutely.

The beer was faint of malt, like a weak doppelbock.  The taste is the same as the smell with a medium-heavy carbonation. The beer is nice on the palette but the moderately heavy carbonation fizzles it a bit. Solid drinkability, it did not feel like the beer was a 5.7%abv, so it gains a half a point from the rest.  Final Thought: It is a solid beer, but I would rather pay the same amount for the Boston Lager, but the variety/seasonal quality will always get me back to this one every year...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Some spice and malt and a little bit of yeast smell. Not bad but Ive smelled better. Tastes pretty good. A little sweet but good. Spiciness is there; nutmeg, pepper, pumpkin or squash, and a touch of hops. Malts are pretty heavy in this one.I would have liked to see a little more hop bitterness in the back.

What little head there is fell to a patchy cover over the liquid, left minimal lacing.  Smell: Mostly malt, sweet malt. The scent of an Octoberfest, but somewhat subdued. I let it warm slightly, but the aroma increased in intensity just a small amount, so I went straight ahead and started quaffing it down.  Taste: Malty, prdeominately sweet with carmel and toffee (mostly caramel) flavor. Some hop bitterness on the swallow to provide some balance (or perhaps a little alcohol?), nah, it can't be. This is less than 6.0.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth easy drinking beer.  Drinkability: Very drinkable.

35,102,Celt44,3.64,"First of all, I'd like to say that this year's SA Octoberfest is far and away, much better than last year's. Appearance is a dark amber with a frothy head typical of most SA beers. The head disappates quickly but the lacing lasts throughout. Aroma is not strong and hardly noticable. Taste of malt stands out the most. Thoughts of pumkin pie come to mind (although this may be subliminal due to the season). Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation is very typical of other SA beers - not overbearing. All in all this is a good seasonal - appropriate for October and always superior to the typical fare offered at most bars in my area. Always a treat to see this one on tap - just like ALL SA beers - much better from a keg. Great session brew for a long autumn's night around a fire.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,FLAbeergutinMASS,3.88,"I've really been into the Marzen style beers this fall, not sure why they seem to all pass as acceptable but also blasé. This one is no exception, good at it's core but not outstanding.  First glass poured pretty aggressively, in hopes that I get some type of outstanding appearance to comment on, nope, consistent 1/16th head no lacing. Second beer I let sit for a while, again, poured aggressively but really no difference from the first.  Surprising its tastes is its most outstanding quality. Sweet and refreshing, honey notes along with a very grain-like aftertaste.  A pretty darn good tasting Oktoberfest. This is probably my last until next fall. Yeah right.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,pweis909,4.15,"This is my re-evaluation of SA's Octoberfest. I'll preface this by saying that the last time I tried it, I detected some odd smells, which had some impact on how I rated the beer. In this review, the brew fares much better.  This poured a big foamy head with big bubbles that don't really last that long. As always, I'm a sucker for amber colored brews, so I'm not going to fault it's appearance, either.  Last time, the smell that I found offputting was a phenolic, plastic bandaid smell that persisted in each of three bottles. This time around, I smell the malt and no plastic. I also faintly smell something that reminds me of metal, but this is not distracting me from enjoying the malt.  The malt tastes yummy. Mmm. It is sweet but hops balance it with bitterness to prevent anything that might seem cloying. No trace of the metal smell in the taste.  Refreshing, drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Crystalline orange-amber color with a near-white frothy head that faded slowly, laced evenly and well. Just barely malting on the nose with some oat bread mixed in. Light but pleasant smell. Same on the tongue but a bit stronger with a slight hop on the finish. Very smooth but not at all thing. Well carbonated but not too much.

35,102,theozag,3.47,"Tried this one on a whim at my sister's wedding rehearsal dinner last night, and I was impressed. Normally I use notes to complete these reviews, but today will have to go from memory. If I'm a bit less descriptive than normal, I appologize. Here's what I recall:  Appears in the glass a medium brown with slight amber hue. No solids or sediments, but a thin off-white head that fades to a pale ring around the inside of your glass.  Smell is pleasantly fruity and fairly apparent. Reminded me of a plant nursery in the springtime or a fruit tree i once climbed in.  Start is quiet tentative, but full-bodied and creamy. There's a strong malt base that immediately spreads over your tongue, giving the beer a more subtle flavor start than might have been expected from the smell.  Settles in your mouth with a generally enjoyable mouthfeel and some rich, sweet flavors. As I recall there was some caramel, cream, and lime to the taste.  Finish is bold, broad, and flavorful. This beer left me with my tastebuds in an uproar, and a long-lasting aftertaste that was about as good as any part of the beer itself. Generally speaking a good beer that I would recommend and will probably try again. To me it was just a little bit like and IPA without the incredible hop bitters.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Ricochet,3.38,"My first impression when I smelled this was it was going to be a repeat of my last review, because, again, I smelled that rusty ""well"" water but after the pour, it went away. Better than average for nice head this formed on top of a dark orange-brown brew. Mouth was a bit creamy and washed down a bit better than average and smell was a malty scent that seemed like some of the other octoberfest styles that I've sampled.  Taste was above average. A little bit of grainy, maltiness with a snap of ale flavor. There was just a hint of fruitiness and this was not really bitter with subdued hop profile.  So, yeah, I could see buying this and having a few. However, I don't really buy Sammy beers because of the average flavors and for the price, there are punchier beers out there.

Pours out a deep copper orange with a fizzy white finger-and-a-half of head. Very clear with light carbonation bubbling through.  Smell is toasted malt, nuttiness, biscuits, and a light Euro hoppiness.  Flavor is also very strong on the toasted/nutty flavors, but pleasantly so. The baked-biscuits and breads flavors play off of the nuttiness particularly well, and the effect is kind of a big, earthy flavor. I like. It could use more hops, though, to balance things out. That's my only complaint.  Overall: Nice if you're looking for somethign toasty, but not as well-balanced as it could be.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Smell: The smell is a very pleasent, bready, grainy malt smell, combine with a nice touch of noble (I think) hops that really balance it out nicely.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is super bready. Almost too much, overpowering pretty much everything else. But it still tastes good, while it's not very balanced. The hops are damn near silent, only bittering at the finish for a tiny second, following into a grainy aftertaste, that doens't linger very long. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Drinkability and Overall: While it's not the best, this is a tasty Oktoberfest, full of character and drinkability. If only the hops were more prominent, I'd be drinking this beer all season.

Hops are the first thing I notice when sipping, though they don't really have a distinct profile. Taste then turns strongly to a malty caramel flavor that works wel for the style. Sweet, but not cloying or offensive; very drinkable. It doesn't really have that typical 'Sam Adams' taste (noble hops?) which is a slight disappointment for me.

35,102,mentor,3.78,"Bottle obtained from Meridian Wine & Spirits (Lafayette, Colorado) and consumed later that same evening. Pours a 1.5 finger dirty tan head that hangs like Tom Dooley. The beer is rich orange-rust and crystal clear. Smells reich caramel sweet malty during the pour. To the nose, crisp rich grains. Sugar, careml, and some munich malt. Tin hops...maybe Saaz? Toasted grains, smells yummy and looks yummy. Tastes caramel, toasty grains, with some apricot (that's a flavor that doesn't belong) sweet, and a hint of sour grains. Sweet in the mouth, but a dry finish. I don't care for the high carbonation it makes the beer leave the tongue too soon. After swirling to release carb, the head, which, had disappeared, returns in its full glory. The beer tastes much better now. A sweet, yet sour, grain hangs like a thick dark cloud near my tonsils. Yeah, it keeps some of the toasty beer flavor around. Hmmm. I wonder if that flavor could be some floral from hops? yes, now I think it might be. Not Saaz, though...Tettnanger? Maybe. Hallertauer..I think not. Smooth slick mouthfeel, thank goodness I got rid of the carbonation. Drinkability is so, so. The dry gets to me by the end and the toasty becomes a bit too tannic or phenolic.

Malty aromas and perhaps a hint of hops as well. Good strong hoppy start in taste. This yields to a bready malt which spreads over the tongue leaving a gingerbread aftertaste.

The taste has a sweet and prominent malt flavor with hops that nicely, balance things. There are some nice hints of fruit. The beer is well made and retains its flavor well, being as drinkable on the cold first sip as it is on the moderately warmed final sip.

Some delicate hop bittering.  Lively but not foamy carbonation and moderate light body.  The malt flavors do me in, I'm unfortunately not impressed by any oktoberfests as they nornally leave a dull nausea in me that I connect with the ""rotten sweetness"" of the munich malts.

Mouthfeel: There is a lot of carbonation in this beer but it still goes down smooth.   Drinkability: I think I would only have one or two of these.  This is my first Oktoberfest beer.

All around, an above average brew... though a C or C- student for the style. Very well balanced but a bit too light for the style. I can see what others mean by this being a ""safe"" brew. No adventure in this at all. Smells mild, mildly sweet, pleasant. Looks like Sam's lager. No thick, big chewyness; nothing really festive about this either. Perhaps that is where this is really lacking. The whole point of October/Oktoberfest is to give thanks for the last brewing season and to celebrate the beginning of the new brewing season.

A veiled foamy ring is all that's left. Minimal lace.  The nose is very malty with something metal in the background. Has an almost nutty character. Of the SA lineup, this has a more pronounced nose than the others. Not complex, but I don't get my nose wet trying to get a whiff.  Tastes a lot like it smells. The nutty malts make up the bulk of the flavors, but there's that ghost of a metallic twinge just after the midpoint. There's enough hop towards the back to add some balance and something approaching complexity. The more I sip, it takes on an almost woody flavor. I like it.

This isn't flat, but rather the bubbles are miniscule pin prick bubbles, so it feels both uncarbonated and super carbonated at the same time. Taste replicates the smell rather too accurately, although if I concentrate I can pull a little brown sugar and a hint of hop in the aftertaste.

Nothing to write home about but it was popular at the event so it served its purpose. Mouthfeel was smooth but lacking any bold or zippy qualities.

It seems to lean malty, though.  Tastes smooth and slightly malty. A touch earthy and a bit of a toasted flavor. Rather thin across my tongue. The taste really begins quite well, then leaves behind a residual flavor that just isn't agreeing with me.  I could see where the light weight of this beer could make it more drinkable to some, but there just isn't enough flavor to encourage me to open another.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Oxymoron,3.72,"Its great to have a Octoberfest in September. Available as a seasonal brew, this was the best beer available at my favorite sports bar last year. Saw it available at the local grocery store here, and to bring back those found NFL moments of yester year. Now why cant my team just win!  Poured a clear amber orange with red hints. The head was limited and no lacing at all. The smell was pretty malty with a bready nutmeg aroma to it. Strong on the spices. The taste is very balanced with a slight roasted flavor and noticeable spice flavors, specifically nutmeg and cinnamon. I can notice a smoothiness from the lager yeast that is exceptional to most Marzen/Oktoberfests Ive tried. The hops are not really noticeable but blend well with spices.  The body is a good neutral, not overpowering, not too light. One thing I would like to see is less spice in the beer. That said this is one of the better Oktoberfest that I have had.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,dauss,3.48,"Presentation: standard SA 12oz. bottle. Freshness date is notched for February 2006.  Appearance: Pours a clear golden amber. A rather large tan forms with excellent retention and poor lacing.  Smell: Malty, slightly toasty and maybe a little caramel. Its has a very clean malt profile, and a very slight hint of hop aroma.  Taste: High levels of carbonation. It is definitely malty. Sweet, but not cloying. Very little bitterness and hop flavor, with some more toffee and caramel. The body is full and the mouthfeel is good.  Notes: It's not bad. Its just a very clean and malty lager with little hop flavor and aroma. I like the carbonation in this beer, but nothing else wow's you.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,twelvsies,2.71,"Hmmm, not as good as I remebered. Maybe my palate has gotten a little picky over the past year, but there's something a little off with this beer. It basically just tasted like a sweetened lager. A small nutty character, but a way-too-present metalic taste that really just isn't doing it for me. Maybe I'm wrong but this just seems like a half-assed beer from a generally solid company.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,CherylM,4.1,"Look forward to this beer--makes the end of Summer more bearable. Tried this season's both on draft and bottle and was pleased with it's annual consistency--very authenic Oktoberfest. Poured a medium copper color with a nice white foamy head, delivered lots of flavor--mostly malty, light caramel and somewhat dry on the finish. Some Oct. Fest beers are a little more hoppy, but this one is very tasty and pleasing. Acts as a wonderful transition beer from Summer to Winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,quasimoto,3,"This poured a dark amber copper orange with a pepsi-type carbinated head. The head quickly dissappeared and left no lace. The aroma if there was any was of toast, caramel and a background of hops. But I had to look for the aroma, it wasn't strong at all. The taste was of light malt, caramel, toast, and grape nuts. There were hops in the background but oddly it kinda balanced everything out. The downfall is that the flavor just tastes watered down. The mouthfeel, is ok. The large bubbles made it harsh on the pallete, and it left a gummy feeliing after wards. It's an ok octoberfest, but not the best.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,cubedbee,3.48,"Was very excited to see the local watering hole had run out of Sam Summer and now had Oktoberfest on tap--my first marzen of the year. The beer is a dark brownish amber with a thin cap of off white head. Not much lacing. Nose is slight but is a nice nutty and slightly doughy aroma. Taste is a nice sweet malt with a slight caramel roast and a slight nutty finish. Some grassy hops are barely detectable. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, a little fizzy, with a medium/thin body. This is another decent seasonal from Sam Adam's that has the advantage of widespread availability.

Deep amber color, caramel malt flavor with just a hint of hop balance. Sweet but not cloying. Smooth. This bier is so drinkable that you'll wonder why your glass is always empty.  Not heavily carbonated or a lot of head, but that is the style.  Have some frinds over, break out the Masskrug and start singing German songs.  ""Ein Prosit...""

35,102,ADR,4,"I guess this is one of those beers that I just never wrote a review of, strange. Attractive clear dark copper appearance, nice frothy head that is rippled at the surface. Simple ring laces, adequate. Aroma is pleasant, deep sense of nuts and sugar, bit of bready graininess. Carbonation is lower, mouthfeel stands at just shy of medium. Very easy going flavor and spot on as far as typical of style, a good brown sugar approach with a backbone of toastiness that integrates well with the body. Slight fade as the beer transitions through front to back, just a slight uptick in a sense of straw and hay at the close. A pretty quaffable example of an O-Fest here, with a deeper color typical of many in the North American market.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,silver0rlead,3.45,"Pours a copper, almost-pumpkin hue with a nice tan head. Aroma is very intriguing, blend of chocolate , pumpkin, spices, and a light grassy hops aroma. The taste is somewhat of a letdown, with a strong malt presence that is bready and slightly sweet and a light grassy hops flavor with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is crisp with moderate carbonation and a medium body. Descent but nothing to shake a stick at.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,beersarang,3.75,"Pours a wonderful orange with a tan head. Orange becomes amber in the absence of light, but yellow in the light. Brilliant clarity and bubbles streaming upward excitedly. Retention is not so fantastic, but lagers are never as amazing as ales in that department.  Spicy grass hop aroma with hints of malt, nice smell and although subtle, it is noticable and distinctive.  Malt sits on the palate for a long while, with sweet grain and various layers of flavor coating the tongue. Preparing for the swallow, the hops deliver a good countermeasure of bitterness that balances the brew perfectly. Hop character though evident in the nose seems a bit subdued by the malt. Spicy and grassy hops should have shown more presence in accordance with their bitterness.  Prickly carbonation with a medium to light body.  I would drink this again, for its uniqueness and because it fits the season so well. Also it is a good standby at the grocery store when there is no other good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,kbnooshay,3.58,"The aroma is pleasant and malty as hell. The appearance is nice; orange amber with a small tan head. The taste is nice, malty with some nice caramel flavor. This offering compared to their others is a little weak though. And for the category of ocktoberfest it is a little weak also because there isn't as much spice as I would like. BUT, the drinkability is awesome and it is a pleasant brew. I will definately take brooklyn brewey's offering over this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Luigi,3.5,"Rich amber color and a sticky off-white head. Malt aroma comes off fruity, almost plum like. A faint amount of hops. The taste is about the same. Very fruity malts that are grape like. A faintness of hop pulls through the malts. Kind of a metallic aftertaste. Over all this is a slightly above average Oktoberfest beer. It just seems like it was better a few years ago.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,filabrazilia,3.88,Pours a brilliant orange copper with a small tan head. There is a bit of lace on the glass.  A light malt aroma is blended with a touch of toffee and is deliously sweet to the nose.  This is a nice tasting beer--very mild and sweet with a good caramel smoothness. A gentle hop bite finishes it nicely.  This is an exceptionally easy beer on the mouth--light and easy yet dry and slightly bitter in the finish.  A surprisingly good offering from SA. I really enjoyed this beer and would be happy to sample it again.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

As with most Oktoberfest style beers, this has a great drinkability, and, I wish I had a bratwurst right now to go with it. I found it to be slightly hoppier than the Saranac Octoberfest, but still balanced. The hoppiness also lasted a lot longer in my mouth afterwards.

Taste is caramel malts, with the frruity flavor pervasive, kind of hiding other notes. Mouthfeel takes a bit of getting used to with the fruitiness for me, but once you settle in, this gets pretty drinkable.

Smell-lot going on, scent of sweet malt, lots of hops, some caramel, amber grain, and alcohol seeped through my nostrils as well.  Taste-full with a lot of malt and caramel at once, hop flavor comes through as well with a huge kick at the very end, lot of flavor and sweetness at the end.  Mouthfeel-good, a lot of flavors hit my mouth and I really liked the character, for the style it will definitely do.  Drinkability- a few of my friends that had this with me really didn't like it, but for Octoberfest I say you really could do worse. A nice adaptation of the style that pays off.  Overall-this is another fine offering by Sam Adams, perhaps not the best adaptation of the style (I'm dying to find a German version) but very enjoyable none-the-less, give it a shot.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The appearance of this beer is quite striking - in my opinion, a textbook example of what a beer should look like.  Arom: Rich and malty, with distinct bread notes, spices, and a mild noble hop presence.  Taste: Begins with a rich malty taste, dominated by roasted malts and a wave of caramel throughout. The finish is dominated by lingering metallic hops, which seem a bit inappropriate.  Mouthfeel: Soft on the palette, smooth and pleasant, fairly full.

35,102,ThreePistols,3.34,"2002...  Burnt orange amber color with little to no head. Sweet, fruity, spicy hops, and malt aroma. Smell of raisin rum cake. Sweet, smooth malt body, and toasted malt flavor. Very well balanced hops and malt. The hops bitterness was just right from start to finish. I felt that the fruity candy like sweetness was too much for this style of beer.  The flavor was very good, but I was very disappointed how understated, restrained the flavor was.  Nevertheless, this is a very drinkable beer in spite of it's out of character sweetness and the lacking of a hearty lager flavor.   November 2004...  I thought that I would revisit this beer since my first encounter with it back in 2002. I found such a deal for this beer by the case that I couldn't pass them up.  Samuel Adams' Octoberfest Seasonal Brew pored a clean clear reddish amber color with a huge bubbly off white head that dissipated into almost nothing. Practically no lace at all.  Aroma- Sweet toasted malt, some spice and alcohol.  Taste- Sweet toasted malt with spice, weak hops.  Okay finish and aftertaste. Slightly dry and the hops standout more here than in the swallow. No real disconcerting flavors.  This beer is okay though not an outstanding Oktoberfest style beer. But I am enjoying them with cookouts and just as an everyday beer.

Surprisingly, the alcohol warmth comes through, too.  Very round, rich mouthfeel. The flavor comes late, but strongly. Hop is strictly a balancing act to the full crystal malt flavors.

Pumpkin pie spice is the most interesting element of a taste that is otherwise too sweet. Malts eclipse any hops that are present, but even those flavors fade quickly. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and this beer goes down very easily. But this is neither a good Sam Adams nor a good example of the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Rio,3.53,"Deep amber color, without much of a head or head retention. Sweet malts and hop aroma that I've found in many other O'fests come through here, though not quite hiding the alcohol in this one.  The sweet malts, caramel and toasted flavors, open the show with this brew, allowing the hops to finish up. It is a nice balance, but I find I rather more enjoy the beers that allow the toasted and caramel flavors to wrap the hops, both the start and finish. Nice body on this one, feels a bit thicker, though not quite chewy like a nice stout.  Another nice O'fest, though not an excellent one. The tap version (which, regrettably, I was not able to make notes on before it was all gone) struck me as a bit better than this, but it's still not bad.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,woemad,3.31,"12 oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $0.99.  Poured a bronze-copper body, with a thick off-white head. Medium amounts of lace.  Smell was sweet, reminding me of caramel. Beyond that, there really wasn't much going on in this department.  Taste was marginally better than the smell. After starting off with the mild caramel sweetness of the malts (of which there are four, according to the label) there was a slight hoppy dryness that came into play at most at the finish. Still, this was rather lackluster.  This seemed slightly too thin and light bodied for an octoberfest. I'd prefer it if it was a bit more medium bodied.  This is perfectly acceptable for sitting around and consuming for lack of anything better, but that's about it. While not a bad beer, there's not enough character in this to inspire me to purchase it again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,BuckeyeNation,3.38,"Translucent orange with hints of amber and of red. There's an absence of bubbles within the beer itself, yet it's capped by a light caramel-colored head of frothy foam. Unremarkable, but adequate lace. Octoberfest has a standard-issue appearance for the style, but looks to be quality-made all the same.  The nose is toasted malty, lightly spiced and somewhat soft-spoken. It doesn't impress me in the least, but there are no major missteps. A growing sense of unease is overtaking me. Samuel Adams brews good beer, but this offering hasn't endeared itself to me yet.  The flavor profile is acceptable, but lacks personality and cohesiveness. It's toasted grain malt-dominant (sweet underpinnings) and lightly hoppy (mildly bitter, clean, dry finish). The body/mouthfeel is firm without being full initially, then loses its way mid-mouthful to end on the thinnish side. This beer is all over the map and sorting out its qualities is an interesting undertaking. While 'interesting' is on my list of positive beer qualities, it isn't high on that list.  Sam Adams Octoberfest is a lackluster beer to some extent. There are better versions out there and I'm convinced that BBC is capable of better as well.

The smell is up front and malty and a distinct lager smell of cold storage. I don't know but I seem to be able to smell a lager before I taste it. The taste for this beer was a blend of malts and tings of molasses and dark malt happiness. There was a after-taste of spiced pumkin and fresh fallen leaves that at first was unwelcome and then excepted and pleasant.

The sweetness never seems to go away, and seems to be a bit cloying. Light body, with some carbonation. Seems a bit watery. Overall, fair.

The aroma is rich and malty, but there is a hint of roast malt which is not appropriate for the style. Besides that, the arome is quite clean - no esters or other off aromas. Hints of caramel and the barest hint of continental hops emerges as the sample warms.  The beer is malty at the taste, bready with a hint of toast, and an inappropriate but not objectionable taste of continental (hallertau? spalt?) hops. The slight hint of roast malt still detracts. The beer finishes with a nice clean swallow, with a slightly vinous linger from the hops.  The mouthfeel is bang on for the style - medium body, medium/high carbonation, no astringency and no warming.  Overall, I find the hop flavor to be inappropriate to style but not unpleasant.

It's an Octoberfest, so its not gonna blow me away, but I have had better. The malts are definately too weak here.  Mouthfeel: a little watery, but the carbonation was done fairly well.  Drinkability: I could have a bunch of these. I had a couple out of the bottle while watching a football game and eating Taco Bell and it was great. I think its a good session brew for football games, though I would definately take Boston Lager over it.  Notes: Not bad for what it is.

Stable but not bold flavors of malt, bread, alcohol on the good side, a slightly metallic/apple finish on the bad side.

Hops are perfectly balanced with crispness in a very solid fashion. The taste is good too, but strikes me as being the kid's version of this style. It could really use some more charactor, although what's there isn't a bad flavor at all.  The mouthfeel is pretty darn full, and nice as it warms.

35,102,Guinness4me,3.76,"While I usually find most Sam Adams' a bit too hoppy, this beer gave me only a glimpse of hops before the malt and caramel...and I liked it!  The color was the obligatory amber but also a glimmer of rose'...almost a deep, white-zin-wine color. The head was great at first, but fizzled quickly leaving sparse, dotted lace.  The hops scent was slight and quickly gave way to caramel sweetness with a slight pungency (or is that a zing of citrus?).  The taste was the best part of this beer, other than the appearance. It was a perfect blast of carbonation at the tip of my tongue, a quick, and I mean QUICK burst of hops, then a malt taste that would rival a Whopper malted milk ball. Yummy!  This could be one of the most drinkable Sammy Beers I have found.  10/22/04-I had to edit this review and rate it higher in drinkability. My hubby surprised me with it in the kegorator and I've only grown to love it more. It's so easy to drink, it's dangerous.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,abcsofbeer,3.62,"So far all of the Sam Adams brews have not done me wrong. This one does not disappoint. Pours the proverbial coppery amber that is very clear and shows a good amount of carbonation. I was able to pour a large 2 inch head that was tannish and left an abundance of lace to the bottom of the glass.  The aroma is at first malty then somewhat fruity, maybe apples. The taste is much the same with a slight hint of caramel that is sweet. The malt is there as well as some fruity undertones. The hop flavor is mild to non existent. This one starts strong but finishes a little week, but, overall a good beer that I would drink anytime.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,FormatKid,3.97,"Grabbed up a sixer of this as a last-ditch effort for a fest to go with my brats.  The body of the beer is almost a pumpkin orange in color. What forms of a head quickly recedes into a few scattered bubbles on top. The aroma is thick with caramel, hints of toast and cookies appear as well. The taste is dominated by that chewy caramel flavor, almost a little one dimensional. Maybe hints of dry toast and just the teeny-tiniest spicy hop. The mouth-feel is refreshing but substantial, nice fine level of carbonation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,GuinnessSmurf,1.98,"I'm never quite sure what to expect from Samuel Adams anymore. It seems the more popular they get, the lower the quality of their beer gets.  Such is true with this year's edition of the Samuel Adams Oktoberfest. It begins nicely - the look is great. It has an orange lager color with a medium sized head.  There isn't much to smell here. It just sort of smells like a Boston Lager.  The taste is very thin and lacks any festive qualities that make a Marzen different from a straight-ahead American lager. Its very thin and runs off the tongue before I can truly get a flavor on it.  Not impressed....not repeating.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,RushLimbmalt,4.12,"This beer is a nice amber color and has a nice fat head that leaves lots of sticky lace. It has tons of toasty malt aromas and no hops. Not in the aroma anyway... The taste is heavy on the malt, but with maybe a tad bit too much hops in the finish. Not the best marzen/octoberfest that I have tried, but it is decent and I buy it when it is available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,wailingwench,4.6,"Eye Candy: Pours a dark garnett red brown color with a thick off-white head. Plenty of lacing,mild carbonation. I believe that SA Oktoberfest is perfect in appearance. Very inviting.  The Nose Knows: The aroma is rich and malty, with distinctive bread notes. Deep and rich roasted malts.  Tongueland: Thick m/f, rich taste, dominated by roasted malts and hints of caramel, with some mild hops thrown in at the finish. An excellent example of the style.  Bender Factor: The only bad thing about SA Oktoberfest is it's availability. I always look forward to three fall things: College Football, pumpkin pie, and SA Oktoberfest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,brewQ,3.13,"Starts well with a deep reddish-brown gem color.  Some maltiness, otherwise clean and devoid of distinctive hop aromas. This is a well balanced beer with subtle nuances of flavor. It runs the risk of coming off like a macro ""red beer"".  Some tang to the finish makes it quite drinkable.  Editorially, it seems Sam has capacity to brew more volume in Cinci and has backed down on his seasonal offerings' character.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Billolick,3.48,"12 ounce bottle, with freshness dating. Pours coppery almond, clear with a moderate white head. It also leaves a trace of lacing. Typical octoberfest brw thing going on here. Sweet malt carries the load, minimal hopping. pleasant brew goes well with sausages, onions etc etc.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Tang07,3.9,"SA Octoberfest poured very nicely. It was a nice dark copper, with a very thick head which hung around for a while.  I had this beer pretty cold and think that it may have tasted better slightly warmer to release more of the flavor and aroma.  The beer has a strong malt flavor and and is quite tastey.  I look forward to drinking more of this during in the crisp fall nights of NC.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,WesWes,3.8,The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a malty scent that boasts of pale and caramel malts. It is slightly sweet with a dry lager yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a slightly malty flavor with a dry lager yeast finish. It goes down easy and finishes smooth and creamy. There is a bit of bitter hops in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good Octoberfest. It has good flavor and aroma; an excellent drinker.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,MuddyFeet,3.58,"I am finally starting to get turned by Octoberfest beers. This one is an amber-tinged brown in color. Only a slight head, but a nice lace clung to the glass. The taste was earthy, a bold hoppy and nutty all in one. It was not bitter, but a tasty sweet, not overpoweringly rich either. The finish is average but well complemented by a pleasant aftertaste that tastes like hazelnuts.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bark,4.2,"The colour is somewhat pale copper. The foam sinks down to a two finger thick, smooth head.  The smell is full of fresh hops, some bread and a burned flavour.  The carbonation is crispy. Crispy with small bubbles, and it is rather refreshing.  The taste is full of burned malt. The sweetness is moderate for the style. The bitterness is quite soft. The aftertaste got a growing bitterness with tones of citrus.  I think that this is a very, very good dark lager beer, as one could have expected from Samuel Adams. But is it an oktober bier? I must say: Probably not.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,ken3c,3.65,Very bright red-brown in color. The head dwindles to a thin ring with a wisp of foam across the top. There is some light lacing. The color is really the highpoint of this beer.  Smells like roast malt and carmel.  A Sweet malt taste turns slighty bitter more from roast malt than hops.  Medium carbonation and medium body.  I wouldn't search this beer out but I wouldn't turn it down.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,afinepilsner,3.83,"12 oz brown bottle This beer pours a dark amber color. The light tan head starts out good but doesn't last, leaving some lacing behind. The aroma is mainly of malt with a little spice. The taste is mainly malty and on the sweet side. It is medium bodied. This is a tasty Oktoberfest and the one that I purchase most often.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,KoG,2.81,"Poured a copper color with an average head that dissapated quickly leaving good lacing around the glass.  The smell was rather disapointing for an Octoberfest and seemed somewhat bland with slight hops and malt evident with a spicy tinge.  The taste was adequate. Caramely and malty with a hint of alcohol and spice, but a little too sweet. Aftertaste reveals a spicy yet piney taste that lingers for a moment then dies.  The mouth was rather smooth leaving a warm sensation in the throat and on the tip of the tongue, possibly due to the decent amount of carbonation.  As far as drinkability, there are others that I would reccomend first. The spicy nature overwhelms the tastebuds and may need to be toned down before I would drink it regularly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,acrawf6,3.73,"Poured out a nice amber color with a good head. Aroma seemed like a spiced malt smell. The taste was nice and mild... the body wasn't full but not dissappointing, i guess average. I think this is a drinkable beer, but i think it would be getting better reviews if they called it something else because overall i really did enjoy it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,maccroz,4.03,"Aaaahhh...it's that time of the year again.  Samuel Adams makes a great Octoberfest. It pours a very thin brown color with a very sweet taste. It's somewhat nutty, almost like Red Hook's Nut Brown Ale.  I don't think I could drink this year round, it's too sweet, but it's a nice beer to compensate for the colder weather.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,RocketWidget,3.41,"Month of expiration clearly marked.  This is a moderate beer, pure and simple. Not a challenging brew, but not especially disappointing either, it just exists.  Pours a very pretty red amber color. Head retention is above average, off white, and very fine. Smell is almost non-existent. Taste is ok. Malt profile dominates (obviously). Quite heavy for a lager.  I really have nothing to complain about here, but then again, I wont buy this again either.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,zacharius,2.98,"This beer pours a dark amber color with a thick off white head that lasts through the glass. Aroma is malty and yeasty, reminds me of bread. Taste is malty but a bit on the thin side. Beer has a slight hint of unpleasant sulfur, probably could have used more bulk aging. Hops are there only for bitterness. Drinkability is good as expected for the mildness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Gagnonsux,3.15,"This really didn't do much for me, especially when compared to the few German Oktoberfests that I've had. Appearance is a dark copper color with a fairly large, light brown head. Aroma smells of nice dark malts and is pleasing. Maybe a hint of alcohol is also noted. Taste is disappointingly average, the flavor is malty, but overly sweet. Not as complex and balanced as I would like. Mild raisin flavor is pretty enjoyable though. This is pretty drinkable, but not something I'd want too often. I'd suggest true German Oktoberfests over this one any day. Samuel Adams can make a better beer than this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,nortmand,3.2,"Pours clear and amber, with a quickly disappearing waft of tannish foam. Smells rich and fruity, like a lighter doppelbock. Tastes initially unnaturally sweet, followed by a strong metallic nose. Back of the tongue is sickly sweet, ending with a hint of roast flavor. Rolls around on the tongue with a subtle carbonation, but unfortunately makes the tongue unpleasantly sticky. Moderately drinkable, but not really sure how much I like this one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,HardTarget,3,"2004 edition, Standard 12 oz. brown bottle with Best Before Mar notched (could you put a year on the label please?) Aroma: Dark malt and pumpernickel rye bread, but I really had to reach for it, pretty mild. Appearance: Slightly hazy copper/amber body showing very little carbonation, but a respectable vanilla ice cream colored head that died off without a trace or lace. Flavor: Nice level of malt balanced by an odd hop-like taste. Cant put my finger on it, dear Lord, is that cooked corn? My mind is struggling with the concept. No; this is Sam Adams! It cant be! Its not entirely unpleasant, almost a caramel corn, but, still. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation, almost fizzy with a dry lip smacking finish. Overall Impression: Eh. Its odd; I enjoyed this one not two nights ago with friends and enjoyed it fully. Now that I sit down to review it, the flaws start to show. Im thinking adjuncts, or maybe a mild problem in the brewing, but the signature flavor is actually a bit off. Still, it is an Octoberfest and not without merit. A fair amount of malt comes through and toward the end the fizzy aspects settle down. I guess a fair introduction for the masses to a great style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mntlover,3.56,Pours a clear amber with a offwhite head that lasts a little while. Aroma is mostly malt and with slight hop and spice aroma. Taste is sweet malt light hop and spice flavors little over sweet but drinkable non the less. Mouthfeel is light refreshing you get light sugary coating of the mouth but doesn't hurt drinkability. This is not the best Oktoberfest but the first one I had years ago in Colorado recipe has changed over the years probably gotten worse hard to tell as my taste has also changed. Every year still look forward to fall and this beer it holds special place in my heart and probably always will.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Clean and clear.  A sweet toffee malt character with a very lightly toasted biscuit aroma. Also a clove spiciness present.  A watered down sweetness whose aroma is more attractive than the flavor. A faint breadiness that leads to virtually no bitterness. A bit bland.  Medium bodied. Very clean and smooth on the palate.  Easily consumable but there are plenty of better beers of this style out there. An okay brew but nothing special at all.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Taste: Hoppy and bitter with a touch of malt sweetness at the end. A malt presence increases as the beer warms a bit.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and chewy but a little too carbonated.  Drinkability: an easy session beer for me. I think it needs more of a malt body but maybe that's just me. Pretty basic but good brew. Maybe not entirely representative of the style but it may be a good transition beer for non-BA's.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Hibernator,3.8,"I had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a pint glass. Freshness date was notched for February 2005. This beer has plenty of life left.  Amber colored with a solid, fluffy head.  Smells like toasted bread, malt, and a little bit of caramel or syrup.  Nicely balanced with a sweet malt presence and a tad of nutmeg or spice. Slight hop presence on the finish, but the malt flavors dominate. This brew used noble hops and four malts.  Respectable 5.4% ABV brew on this Sam Adams seasonal. Drinkable and enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Hunter,3.43,"Certainly lives up to its autumnal theme. Rich brown le, topped with a light brown head that pour thick with decent hangtime.  The aroma is a little thin. There are notes of malt there and some hops, but everything seems to have the volume turned down.  The label of the bottle mentions four types of malts in the brew, and it certainly shows in the taste. Sweet and malty, with a barely there notes of hops. Decent body and a finish that bears out the hops a little more.  Overall, not a bad brew. I don't particularly care for overly malty beers but this isn't bad. I could see knocking back a few outdoors when the air has a decided nip to it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,chrishickman,3.04,"Saw this and Goose Island's version at the grocery tonight and decided to pick up a sixer of each. This beer is everything I feel an Oktoberfest SHOULDN'T be...mild flavor, light color, poor head retention and lacing, not much by way of malty goodness. This beer would not be bad as a session beer, but I hold seasonals and especially Oktoberfests to a higher standard (simply because there are so many from which to choose), and this just has nothing going for it. Pales in comparison to the Goose and almost every other Oktoberfest I've had. But, it's better than Budweiser.

I recommend it but not highly.  --Joey",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,dedalus,3.86,"poured out of the bottle a deep orange, with a nice, fluffy head. moderate, creamy lacing.  not a lot of aromas, but i got it at an applebee's and they pulled it out of an ice cooler, so that's probably what i can blame the weak scents on. what i could detect was a slight, timid hop presence (noble hops, if i remember the label correctly) and a faint whiff of sugary malt.  good, medium-thick mouthfeel, although i suspect it could benefit by being a little thicker.  almost no detectable hops in the palate. lots of clean, nutty, creamy, sugary malt, in both the palate and the finish. just the smallest bit of hop flavor emerged in the finish; the strong but clean sweetness was given a touch of complexity by this late, light bitterness.  this beer wasn't very complex or challenging, but it tasted great, and there's nothing wrong with that! i kind of felt like i could drink it all day, but there are a lot of other oc(k)toberfests that i'd like to try this year.  all in all, if you can't get your hands on an authentic german/bavarian o-fest, this is a good beer to try. good, clean, sweet, and just complex enough to escape being boring. the autumn beer to reach for when you want something that's easy to drink, but isn't cripplingly dumbed-down.  cheers,  s.d.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,sabrills70,3.13,"Poured a medium amber with an off white medium head. Excellent lace. Smell is very mild for the style, some malt and very subtle other smells, but like I said very mild for the style. Taste is OK, malt and hops, possibly some vanilla, but again mild for the style. This is a very drinkable beer. Its not a great brew and Sam Adams is capable of much better, don't get me wrong it is still very good but it tastes like they purposly ""watered"" it down to try and appeal to the masses a bit more (what the hell, it works for AB). It is still fun to drink and nice to see every year at this time and I do still look forward to it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Beastdog75,3.11,"Samuel Adams Octoberfest is probably one of the O-Fests that I see the most of around this time of year. I have heard about ""tweaking"" and ""dumbing down"" of this beer over the years, but this was my first time trying this one, so I won't have the benefit of past years experience to compare this beer to.  The Octoberfest pours a nice medium amber color that is translucent and has an orange hue. A decent off-white head forms, but only lasts for around 30 seconds. The smell is quite light. I could barely detect some caramel malts in the aroma and that was about it. The mouthfeel is light and somewhat watery. The initial taste is of caramel malts, which dominate the beer making it somewhat sweeter than most. There is a light nuttiness in the flavor, and an even lighter fruitiness. Hop bitterness is there but nowhere near as pronounced as the other Sam beers I've had. Not enough to provide good balance. Aftertaste has some light dryness and bitterness, but not much. Some light caramel flavors continue, and I thought I caught some DMS in there. This finishes off with no alcoholic warmth.  All in all, I thought this was a pretty quaffable brew, but it is nowhere near as exciting as some other Sam Adams beers. To an extent it is almost less flavorful as well. Average for the brewer and the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,Redrover,3.55,"I had this one on tap at the Clubhouse last night. The Clubhouse is a slightly pretentious establishment that is kind of a glorified sports bar for middle-aged businessmen and big haired divorced women. The parking lot is filled with Porchess, large SUVS and other expensive toys. Lots of men in bad jewelry. My second Oktoberfest did not come in a chilled glass so I chose that sample to review.  Nice looking if slightly pale Oktoberfest offering. Decent head, not much lacing. The beer smelled nicely of malt and a hint of hops.  Taste was fine, but not outstanding. Some good malt sweetness and nice use of hops to keep balance. The major flaw in the beer is its thinness. Beer needs more of a malt backbone to move up in the ratings. Very similar to a Becks O-fest. A decent enough beer to use to introduce people to the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The smell is faintly grassy and fresh. Color is exceptionally clear reddish amber with almost no carbonation past the initial pour (looks almost exactly like a strong brewed iced tea minus the ice). The taste leaned distinctly towards toasted caramel malt with a light dose ot delicately floral hops. The best quality about this beer has to be its velvety smooth mouthfeel that is enhanced by the thick malty body, that is much more evident here than in other fest beers I've had. It was almost entirely lacking in bitterness and left no aftertaste. A decent beer for the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

The start is rather smooth with malt sweetness up front along with some toasted, bready notes and subtle spiciness. Hops, and some notes of grain finish the beer out nicely with a slightly lingering aftertaste. Not an amazing brew, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. This is the first Oktoberfest brew Ive tried...

Flavor is light and malty, typical of the style, but there is a distinct odd finish and lingering aftertaste that really detracts from this one. I can't put my finger on the flavor. I looked at some of the other reviews to see if anyone could characterize it for me, and the closest is probably the reference to butter/popcorn. Very odd, doesn't belong with the beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Some light Munich (although reaching for em') and caramel notes up front, somewhat one-sided; fails to develop, a light bitterness, bordering on medium bodied. Notes of butter and popcorn towards the end make this one rather odd.

No hops to mention. Flavor is thick and malty. Full bodied, with moderate small bubbled carbonation. Clean flavors, no esteriness. No apparent hops. Moderate burnt caramel, with the barest touch of smokiness towards the end. A very thick malty finish. Sweet, thick maltiness in the finish, with a quickly fading malty aftertaste.

Taste: More sweet malts, with a nice crispy roastiness to the bier. Carbonation bites the tongue, but settles into creamy, mouth-filling goodness.

Not very heavy but refreshing. Dominated by malt. A little sweet up front followed by caramel and toffee, although none of it was very distinct. Mouthfeel was a bit thin.

Pours to a red, amber color that resolves to a thin head, and there's definitely a lack of any head retention here. That's a shame.  Has a sweet, malty aroma, with a touch of caramel.  There's very little active carbonation here. It makes the beer appear almost flat. However, there is a distinct mouthfeel, and a long, lingering aftertaste - akin to just having had some good, sweet Chinese food, or a facefull of cotton candy, or the like... albeit laced with a touch of hops and malt.  But this is supposed to be an Oktoberfest Märzen. The problem is, the true Märzens that I've had in/from Munich taste and look nothing like this, or vice versa.

Not too much hop, enough to keep it very drinkable yet be a little more interesting.  The SA O-fest is very traditional as I said, very drinkable - I could see myself drinking 5-6 of these over a several hour period, but it was not especially interesting.

The head dissipates almost immeadiatly. I swirled this beer alot to get the scents out. Very weak. Sweet malts and some fruit. An unpleasant sour scent at the end.  The flavors are many but only the malt really stands out. It is a medium sweet caramel flavor that is prominent. Some hops but not any bite to them. There is some mild fruit offerings and a green grape taste at the end. The aftertaste lingers too long as well.  It drinks pretty easy. Goes down smooth. Nothing extra special. Not too dense. Medium bodied. I want to try some other Octoberfest beers and see the difference.  I think this company has some excellent product. I just do not find anything really unique about this beer. A notch above average.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Quaffer,3.39,"Appearance: This was a simple, copper beer that produced a one-finger beige head. It disappeared quickly, eventually leaving only a ring of foam around the circumference of the glass.  Smell: The smell was composed of sweet and caramel malts with a touch of dark fruit and cherries. There were occasional aromas of cracker and roasted malt, but they were very faint. At first, I thought that the smell was rather one-dimensional, but as the beer sat, it gained more complexity.  Mouthfeel: There was a creamy smoothness at the front of the tongue that picked up some bite as the beer moved back into the mouth. Then, after the beer was swallowed, there was a light tingle on the tongue.  Taste: There was not much going on in the taste department. A corny, malty sweetness dominated the flavor from start to finish. As the beer started to really warm up, a bit of bitterness joined the finish, but it was very mild.  I think that I will pass on this beer for the rest of the season. Kind of bland, in my opinion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Bierman9,4.03,"The 2003 version (01SEP03) is equally attractive. Nose isn't as strong, but still has a toasty malt foundation. Mouthfeel still comes in at a 4, smoothing out the more you drink. Flavor is again good and malty, yet the cloying sweetness of last year is gone. There is a subtle, sharp/spicy characteristic that hits you late, in the back of the throat. Nicely toned-down as the '02 version had a real bite. Poured 3 bottles into a Spaten litre glass stein, and it's going down very well. Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  *** ***  Ahhh... the first Sammy O-fest of the season....(16AUG02).... just a prelude to a shit-load of more O-Fest in the next couple of months!!! Poured a luscious dark-copper to amber color, with a huge, off-white, frothy head. Sticks around a bit, with nice lacing! Darker than most O-Fests, including the Munchen originals. Nose has lots of toasty malt, as well as some sharp spiciness from the hops (Tettnang, right?). Body was middle-of-the-road, and slightly rough on the tongue at first, but it smooths a bit as it warms. There is a big, semi-sweet malt backbone to this baby, along with that hop sharpness again. Jumps right out at you! This version has more hop-spiciness than the Munchen varieties, and is quite pleasant. Mmmm-mmmm good! Hello, O-Fest season!!! A big Zum Wohl!!!

35,102,RoyalT,4.1,"Appearance  Nice, light orange body with a big head that held on long and laced the glass.  Smell  Lightly toasted malt in accordance with the style.  Taste  Smooth, creamy, lightly burnt malt flavor. Theres a little caramel touch at the end, but mostly just the smooth, easy, malt taste. Excellent rendition of the style.  Mouthfeel  No carbonation and very creamy.  Drinkability  This went down quickly, which is the telltale sign of a good Oktoberfest beer. When I lived in Germany, I used to drink these warm on tap (the bartender would warm it with a heated tool dunked in the beer specifically for that purpose), and they would often go down after just three or four gulps. I wasnt trying to chug the mug, but they were just that smooth.  Comments  I drank this at room temperature, and it was very reminiscent of the Oktoberfest beers that I had in Germany. Excellent example of the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,taez555,3.78,"Had it on tap at the Sam Adams Brewhouse at Logan Airport in Boston.  Poured a dark amber, but very clear, body. A small off white head sat atop.  The nose was very sweet and malty. Caramel, some roasted malt, very mellow, hints of brown sugar, wood, touch of alcohol, grass, and some nice noble earthy hop touches, but all very faint.  The taste was very smooth and malty. A tiny soft bitterness. Rather highly carbonated. Wood, earth, caramel, light brown sugar, maybe even a slight slight slight smoke touch, more of a backwoods earthyness.  It ends with perfect balance of malt and earthy hop. It actually has an ever so slight touch of citrus bitterness.  This beer gets much better as it warms. But overall I can't help but think Bud meets Sam Adams kicked up a notch. An odd but still extremely yummy combonation. A great middle of the road Octoberfest by SA.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Either way this one is worth a try, pours a deep ruby brown with a nice sized creamy tan head leaving full even rings of lacing beautiful appearance. Aroma is also up to par with Vienna toasted nut malt tones in the aroma and residual caramel notes arising one warming treat just a lil early in mid August in this heat, just not fall yet. Flavors blend well with a great toasted nuts flavoring from the specialty malts used and spiced up goodness to go around bringing not only a solid representation but maybe a lil uniqueness from the BBC. Finish contains som mild fruit tones and a bready characteristic that I call the Sam Adams funk, keep in mind not always a bad funk just goes here.

Great copper/amber/orange color with a large head and a very clear body. The smell was pretty average wich is slightly wheaty with very little hop aroma.

Appearance: Pours a brilliantly clear amber-brown with a fat, foamy, three-fingered head; head retention absolutely stellar -- two of those fingers made it down to the bottom of my 20oz. pint glass; thick, foam lacing.  Aroma: Toasted Munich and Caramel malts with notes of noble hops and a slight fruitiness.  Taste: Upfront, much like its aroma; a light to moderate hop bitterness (earthy) fights its way out in time, as does a touch of grain. All in all lightly sweet and moderately malty with a touch of bitterness.  Notes: A respectable rendition of the Oktoberfest style. Slightly superior taste profile to that of Paulaner's Märzen, which I drank juxtapositionally.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

35,102,AtLagerHeads,3.48,"I need to apologize to Sam because I bought this a bit past the month of expiration, but I don't think it affects this review. The pour seemed quite robust and a nice head came up without coaxing. The head did dissipate a little too quickly and not much lacing was present. Nice caramel malt aroma with a background of hops. The flavor was very nice and gave off hints of malt and bread, but these were well balanced by the light hopping. Crisp finish; quite dry. Very enjoyable, drinkable beer. I will seek it out next year when it's released again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83

Color is a clear amberish brown, with a white head that fizzed away pretty fast and left some lacy patches. Smell is faint roasted malt, a bit burnt caramel or caramel popcorn. Taste form this was good, very smooth with good rich, sweet malt thats mild and pleasing. Some drying hop presence in the finish but is not strong enough. Thus bringing it to the feel, a little empty and slightly watery, lighter/medium body, smooth, clear and clean with some dryness and sweetness mixing at the end.

35,102,scottum,3.18,"Dark amber with a white head. I like Octoberfest beers every so often as a break from my ales. While a decent brew overall, it just does not compete with others from the style.

The 12oz bottles just aren't enough. I have to get the big glass and do two at a time with this one. the beer finishes clean with a distinct hop after flavor that is the ugh factor that is often associated with to many micro-brews. I look forward to this one every year. But I usually wait till my ""real"" German Oktoberfest run out. This can't compete in the European market I am sure - but as far as American Oktoberfest beers goes.

35,102,MJR,2.56,"Appearance: Pours a nice, orange-amber shade with great clarity. A foamy off-white head starts off a good size and sticks around for the duration.  Smell: Aroma of caramel, a bit of toffee, sweet malt, and corn.  Taste: The strongest flavor is the sweet malt, with it's caramel and toffee notes, but a corn taste is a close second. Too much sweetness overall. That's disappointing, considering this used to be a really good Octoberfest offering.  Mouthfeel: Has a fairly medium body with a crisp, dry mouthfeel.  Drinkability: It would be a lot higher if the unmistakable corn aroma and flavor wasn't there.  This beer caught a lot of heat this year when many people detected corn in the recipe.

Nose has more of a hops note than I am use to with Oktoberfest beer and obstructs any other aroma. Palate is a toasted thin sweet malt and a slight hops.

Poured a clear looking, deep Amber-Reddish Color, that again, looked very good, no complaints there. Still, No Aroma though (Deeper Sniff)  Im trying.

I get some hops in the middle but not many, perhaps just one. Where the hell is that Aroma?? (Snorting the Beer now!!) - Nope still cant find it. Very lightweight mouth feel, that disappears almost instantaneously. Some cloyiness in the residual tastes, more annoying than pleasurable. Is this an Oktoberfest LITE ???????

Bready, biscuity sweetness upfront yields to caramel malt and dark fruitiness, with mild hop bitterness providing a lightly bittersweet character mid palate. Lightly bodied and crisp in mouthfeel, lending an oddly refreshing nature to this brew. Finishes w/ trace notes of butter.

35,102,Lupe,4.15,"Pours a deep orange color with a slightly foamy head and decent lace. Malt, fruit, spice, hops, and alcohol all in the nose and taste. Nicely balanced, very smooth, and highly drinkable. Very good, what you would expect from Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,WilliamPhilaPa,3.23,"Pours a deep orange / amber color with a slightly foamy and sticky off-white head. On the nose the aroma of the noble hops comes through, hints of fruit and spice. Mouthfeel is slightly grainy, a bit sharp at first but settles down. On the palate the flavors consist of mild fruit, caramel, toasted malts, slight hop bitterness. Tastes a bit like a very, very light SA dobble bocknot really a good o'fest though, to many better ones out there. Still drinkable though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,cokes,2.16,"Dull amber color. Doesn't seem to sparkle like a nice lager should. Slow but steady carbonation. Foamy off-white head did not retain well. Odd smelling. Fake malt sweetness. Notes of adjuncts (corn) and some godawful spice I can't seem to place. Taste is equally uninspired. Onslaught of cloying psuedo-malt sweetness. Toffee coated adjuncts. This is what I'd expect Miller's Oktoberfest to taste like. Corn-filled, fake, cheap and abysmal. An ugly blast of grain alcohol seals the finish on this one. My least favorite o-fest to date. Actually, one of the least favorite beers I have had in a while.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,doerickson,3.33,"Reddish to light copper coloring, minimal white head. A balance of citrus-like hops and malty aromas in the nose. This balance remains evident in the taste, as neither hops nor malts takes the lead. I have to say that it's not quite as flavorful as the smell and appearance might lead you to believe, but nonetheless it's easy to drink and it did keep my interest (at least for one pint).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,hyuga,3.9,"2002 release. Orange-amber color and a white head with many large bubbles. Head stays well for a bit, but eventually goes down to a thin lace. Apparently this one needs a good hard pour to retain a head. Malty smell with some hop character and fruitiness. Lots of toasted malt flavor that is typical of Sam Adams beers. Sweet hop flavor that has just the right amount of bitterness, which seems to increase as you drink more. Lots of flavor here, but not quite as much as I would expect from a Sam Adams beer. Still a good brew in my opinion, and definitely worth trying.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Thrasher,3.86,"To my mind, this seems mellower than recent years. I find this a boon because I seem to remember my palate growing tired after one or two bottles from the previous batches. Perhaps something has been sacrificed, but overall I think it's a plus, at least in the drinkability department. Cushy head atop a crystal clear amber liquid, slight musty aroma. Tangy malts with just the right trace of spices to let you know you've got a Fest beer grasped tightly in your mitt. The taste profile goes through its cycle quickly, ending up with a photo finish containing faint echoes of the flavor, nice and gummy. Even though Sam has been troubled recently in the PR department, I'm enjoying their specialty beers (read: anything other than Boston Lager and Light) more than ever. Think I'll have a Cream Stout a little later on.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,mophie,4,"This is a fairly decent beer, and an OK way to celebrate the season, IMO. Rich copper/orange color with a creamy tan head. Subtle noble hop aromas, slightly spicy, with a little caramel and brown sugar. Taste is dominated by malt, but the hop presence is there to keep things balanced. A bit juicy. Slight alcohol spiciness in the finish. I'll have another, thank you.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jdhilt,3.61,Moderate carbonation and frothy head that doesn't last too long but leaves some lace. Copper/orange color and more malt than hops in fact the hops are barely noticable. Nose has some fruitiness but it is barely noticeable. Finish is smooth with some sweetness but not cloying.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Suds,3.68,"This beer has grown on me year after year. Medium head that quickly fades. Burnt golden color. Aroma could be more pronounced. Malty, sweet, and satisfying. Good balance with a soft, creamy finish. Subtle bittering hops emerge at the end of a lingering aftertaste. Good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Bighuge,3.35,"This beer has a very nice deep clear copper hue. A decent white head that is well retained. Nice toasted malt aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with a body of about medium. Taste is pretty average. Subtle toasted tones. Some maltiness. Minimal bitterness. Nothing really stands out with this one, but by no means will I be dumping this down the drain.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,jackndan,4.15,"Sam Adams Octoberfest (2002): As deep orange a beer as you&#8217;ll ever see, with an off-white head with good retention and stickiness. This beer has an aroma of pumpkin pie spices, and fresh bread. Very pronounced malt flavor, with great spiciness. The beer has a hint of alcohol warmth, and it carries through to the aftertaste. This beer has always meant fall to me, and this was very fresh. But I&#8217;ve found through long experience that this beer ages very well. Buy it now because it&#8217;ll be gone in October, but it&#8217;ll last till June. Prosit!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bmills1608,3.83,"This beer is a really nice orangy-amber color, when I poured it, the first thought I had was pumpkin.  Smell is fresh malt, almost cake like, not a real sharp or over powering nose, but smooth and soft.  Taste is rich and malty, somewhat complex in what seems to me was a quick wave a baking spices flashing across my taste buds. After the first sip I swear I could taste autumn. Really nice and smooth. I was drinking this in the cool of my basement when outside it's August and 90 and the summer can't end fast enough for me now.  Finish was sweet with a bit of chocolate and caramel in the finish, maybe even a touch of fruit.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,inebrius,3.92,Deep copper-amber leaves a partial lace. Malty biscuit nose. Sweet malt start turns gradually bitter hop and lingers shortly. Creamy and tasty SA Octoberfest is a quality beer IMO. I am truly glad to have a beer of this merit readily available.  Cheers to frank4sail for the sample.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,frank4sail,2.73,"12 Oz. Bottle. Malty slight hint of cardboard (Oxidation?) Below average for the style. Decent mouthfeel, but nothing there of any positive taste. Not one of Sams best. I'm now sorry I got a case of this stuff.... It looks alot better than it tasted.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,oberon,3.73,was pleasantly suprised byt how authentic it was.Nice malty flavor and good color.I like most Sam Adams products.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,Brent,3.6,"A solid American take on the style. Moderately sweet with a little less malt backbone than average for the style, but smooth and good natured.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,BKotch,4,"Very malty, with a fair smack of hops in the finish, but a bit too fruity for the style. Still, a very good beer and a heck of a deal at under $10 for a 12-pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,xXTequila,4.18,"wow...talk about malty. It was alittle heavier than I liked. It tasted similar to their winter lager, without the spices of course.  Update: 9/27/2002 I have noticed that this years Octoberfest is alot sweeter and has more of a caramel flavour. It tastes alot more like a ale than a lager. It actually tastes alot like their stock ale now.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,gwfrankpsu,4,"This is a nice beer, rather chewy and malty. This is the first I've had this in a long time, really very nice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,bcm119,3.76,"2001. Very malty, as it should be. The malt flavors are up front, sweetish, ripe and fruity, with an alcoholic flavor as well that leads into the firm hop bitterness. Hops are present only towards the end, lacking any flowery flavors in the nose, but definately accomplish what they're in there for: cutting through the slightly syrupy body for a decent finish. Nice for those early fall cool spells.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
35,102,AaronRed,4.06,"Nice amber color makes this beer appear warm and inviting. Sweet and malty, -well balanced. Also, very crisp in some ways. I drank it with a Bison burger, and it's flavor lasted until the end.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Märzen,83
