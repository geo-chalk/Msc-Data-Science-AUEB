192,607,jonphisher,3.96,"Wanted to try one last time before it’s gone for good…  A very beautiful beer, crystal clear; slightly off white head with above average retention and some really nice lacing. It drinks nice and light really; just enough little malty richness, very lightly toasted in quality…little hoppy, yet nicely restrained, on the finish, noticeably bright and clean finish.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,nickb2000,3.87,"Nice amber color, fairly clear and pulls a alright head, not amazing but its something. Smells alright, nice hit of toasted malt, caramel and floral/citrusy hops. A tad bit of the yeast comes through on the nose. Taste is pretty good. Its very crisp and refreshing. The toasty malt hits you first, then you the hops, but not alot of bitterness. The finish is good, crisp and you dont get any alcohol. Overall great mainstream beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,AlexandraDen,3.53,"This review is mostly from memory from last night, couldn’t review it properly but not a big deal as this beer is pretty much just a straightforward, inoffensive amber.  No appreciable head on the pour but it is a gorgeous crystal clear, darker orange-amber colour. Genuinely amber. Very nice. Aromas of grassy but most flora hops, lightly toasty caramel malts. And the taste is identical on the palate. Not much else to say. I didn’t notice any ashy or burnt qualities personally, which for my palate might’ve actually been a nice spin (though burnt malt notes get you a little out of amber territory)  Light bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly prickly on the tongue, very crisp  It’s an average amber, better than any macro, underwhelming by modern craft beer drinker standards",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,LanceBiggums,3.52,"Pours spot-on amber. Amber amber. Tiny bit hazy. The head recedes quickly and leaves spotty lacing for whatever that's worth. Smells quite decent, orchard fruit, maybe apple, not too far off what you'd expect from a British amber ale. There's also a very subtle toasty aroma. Unfortunately it smells better than it tastes. The flavours are understated. More of that orchard fruit, but unfortunately none of that quintessentially British marmalade flavour. There is some gently bittering hops to balance it out. There is also a strange ashy flavour. Other reviewers described this beer as very biscuity, but I don't find that. It tastes somehow slightly burt and, well, ashy. That is subtle but not very pleasant, and the more you focus on it the more it irks. The mouthfeel is all right, no complaints. Overall it's not a bad beer but I'd only consider it one or two steps up from the average American macro swill. At least this has a bit of character.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,JZH1000,3.52,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by April 10th yikes a little old but I'll adjust scores.  On the pour a white 2 finger head forms that quickly recedes back down to a 2mm head. Color is about as spot onto amber as you can get and there's a decently lively carbonation. No haze. Light lacing.  Smell is a bit old, but beyond the light skunkiness it reminds me of what I can only describe as belgian light beer. All I can really detect is the old hops and yeast not a lot of malt character here.  Taste is quite similar to the nose. There is some sweetness coming from the malt but it is mostly covered by the yeast character which is quite bright and belgian tasting, but not as strong as traditional belgian beer. Some malt aftertaste as would be expected from an amber. Not a bad flavor but slightly boring.  Feel is a bit light for the style. Definitely can see that it was competing with macros back in the day it's slightly heavier than a lager but it clears the palate fast and has a slight drying effect.  Overall this beer is better than I remember it but the flavors are quite subtle. Apart from the aged hops there's nothing off or offensive about this and it's very easy to drink but only a step or two up from traditional American macros. In Colorado this almost feels like a local macro. I wouldn't seek it out but I'd choose it over a few beers for sure",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Patriots3232,3.64,"It's just not New Belgiums best imo, and it's not the greatest amber ale I've endulged into at the same range. I'd state an average at best.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,TheBricenator,4,"Look: Nearly clear reddish amber with a creamy looking head that retains well and eventually settles, leaving good lacing behind Aroma: Freshly baked bread, light toffee notes, wafts of dough, caramel, lightly toasted grains, and some malt sweetness Taste: Caramel-dipped bread and tons of it starts things off as some doughy notes and toffee filter in behind. These components continue to develop and deepen along with some toasted grains and closes how it started Mouthfeel: Full, pretty smooth, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and smooth finish Overall: I dig it. A classic in its own right and a tasty and well-made Amber ale to boot. Probably not too exciting for some but it’s a great no-nonsense, easy-drinking, malty beer that is nice to have readily available pretty much anywhere and inexpensive to enjoy",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Perioddicals,3.97,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass at roughly 50 - 55 degrees. One and a half finger light tan head on an aggressive pour. Clear amber-brown color. Some lacing that fades.  S - Sweet malt up front. Creamy/buttery scent. Some light bread as well.  T - Taste follows scent with sweet buttery caramel malts. Light Biscuit. No bitterness, all straightforward flavor. A bit of toastiness as it warms up.  F - Good buttery medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation.  O - This is a good straightforward beer. The flavors are a basic caramel/biscuit malt, and there is no bitterness. This is a very pleasing beer that I would always choose ahead of the American mass market beers. In fact, I would classify this as one of my standard beers. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to everyone.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,lomtatz,3.72,"Color is a dark amber that is translucent. Pour was nice with a small head that dissipated really quickly, leaving little bits of disconnected lace on the glass. I noticed the aroma instantly while pouring with the phenolic aroma characteristic of a Belgian style ale. Taste is very crisp, and notably well balanced in terms of sweetness, bitterness, and yeasty flavors. For a bBelgian style ale, it is somewhat muted, but in a way I think works very well for an easily drinkable rendition of this style. Overall, a very solid beer, I think the only reason I haven't rated it higher is because the style in general is not one of my favorites.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,RoyBrentII,4.16,"This was my go-to when I was still in the states. Usual pour was from a 12oz bottle into a porter glass.  Look: clear; almost more copper than amber. Decent head/lacing.  Smell: complex. Slightly sweet with biscuit and caramel.  Taste: pretty much matches the aroma. Almost a märzen, but just enough hops on linger to remind you that it's an ale.  Overall: Ah, Fat Tire, I miss you. Nothing in Belize is even close.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,KingLemuel,3.5,"I just bought a second six pack (about 2 months after the first) of Fat Tire 12 oz bottles. I bought both at Fred Meyers in Tacoma. Sadly, for the first six pack, all 6 were stale and 3 of them were just about completely flat with next to no carbonation. That was the first time I ever bought beer from the supermarket and the beers were stale! Fortunately, the 6 bottles I just bought were all fresh and very much carbonated. I poured into a 16 oz pint glass and a large and quickly dissipating head appeared with lots of carbonation bubbles. For an amber beer, the caramel malt is not the star, its flavor does not overwhelm the maltiness. Instead, the malt flavor blends well with the caramel flavors and the malt is perhaps a tad more prominent over the caramel. The beer is bitter but not too bitter and has some hop flavor and aroma but not too much. The malt/caramel flavors are the star of the show and the hops play a secondary role. I just brewed a 5.5 gallon clone of this beer (adapted from BYO magazine and Austin Homebrew Supply's clone recipes). Fat Tire's website claims that the beer is a balanced and easy drinking beer, that it is! For the clone recipe, getting the flavor balance right between malt and caramel malt is the hard nut to crack. I like the somewhat subdued caramel malt flavors in Fat Tire better than Alaskan Amber Ale and Redhook ESB. The fizzy, dissipating head is the one drawback for me. Maybe it is a tad too carbonated. I've adjusted my clone recipe to hopefully get closer to the real deal (less caramel 80L malt) and will brew it again in 2022. The Briess Carapils malt that I used in the clone resulted in better head retention. The Fat Tire tastes good and is very drinkable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Beergeeknut,3.29,"Appearance: This classic pours a transparent amber with a head about two fingers in height.  Aroma: Bready, biscuity, floral hop with a slight dryness in the nose.  Taste: Buttery, biscuity, light hop bite in the back. Fairly malt forward. Nice notes of caramel.  Overall: I first had this well a long time ago and I enjoyed it. Years later I still do. It's such a great classic beer. Cheers.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Nose is isn't too bright - light brown sugar, some earthy hop, a bit of brown bread. Even as it warms, the aroma is pretty muted and dissipate pretty quick. Flavor delivers more, though up front sweet - light molasses, agave nectar, light brown sugar. On the finish, however, there is some really pleasant breadiness keeps it from cloying.

192,607,flagmantho,3.51,"Poured from 16oz can into a dimpled mug. Best by 12/5/21. I find it almost incomprehensible that, 3900 beers in, I have never reviewed good ol' Fat Tire.  Appearance: rich orange hue with a clear body and a nice effervescence. Head is a thick finger of frothy light-tan foam. It is very autumnal looking, like the changing of leaves.  Smell: sweet and a bit estery, with a lightly biscuity malt component. It's ok, but it comes off as kind of having a cloying fruity sweetness. Not super strong, but definitely there.  Taste: yup, that's Fat Tire. Sweetish malt, rather biscuity, and with a light bitterness and not a ton of hop character.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and a decent creaminess.  Overall: I haven't had a Fat Tire in a long time, but way back in the day I had a ton of it. I feel like it has changed not one iota. This is perfectly decent, well-enough crafted beer, but these days it just doesn't suit my palate too much.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,GEO_MAN,2.34,"OK usual blah poured into my beer stein.  Have travelled enough to see this beer, thought I would give it a go.  Enough, I expected big things of this beer. Honestly this is a beer that starts strong and finishes poorly. Good craft beer adds something to the end, a hops buzz, a malt twist. this has a typical US Bud, Coors, Miller Metallic Ew.... No thanks. I spent $21.19 on a 12 pack 12oz which puts it in the same league as Sam Adams which I like, and it is not the best but I think is reasonable and will drink if someone else is paying, I generally enjoy German / Czech beers same price for 24 pack but 17 oz which equals about 3 times the amount for the price for Flat Tire.

192,607,DeidaraVictory,3.87,"Look: nice beautiful deep red hue. Reminiscent of an Irish red, but a little more on the light brown side.  Smell: I’m picking up lemon, maybe a bit of caramel, a bit of hops, some malt, and some toasty bread.  Taste: Nice malty taste, smooth drinking and definitely some light toastiness. The hops are faint, but it’s there and it does a great job at balancing out the malt.  Feel: Great carbonated mouthfeel. Smooth and goes down easily. Light bodied, but definitely has its own presence in the mouth.  Overall: A solid beer. Not extraordinary, but really good for what it is. I’d drink it again.

192,607,German-Helles,4.2,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into a New Belgium goblet. There is about an inch of off white foam over a clear dark amber ale. The carbonation is moderate, the head settled down to a eighth of an inch with a bit of thick lacing left behind. The aroma is sweet bread malts, very noticeable. There is a roasted caramel sweetness, then crisp, followed by more sweetness with a lightly hopped finish. This is good stuff!

192,607,JohnniEMc,4,"Not only amber, there's some copper to the color. This observation by virtue of two twelve ounce brown bottles being poured into a clear glass liter mug. The white head is modest, yet enduring as part of a well carbonated brew. Yeast dominates the hops and malt in the smell. The good news is that there's more to taste than smell. This is a well balanced and somewhat complex ale. The barley malt is solid and provides a little sweetness. Within its relationship with the hops, they bring some earthiness which adds to the depth. Apparently, the malt, hops and yeast can also produce a nutty aspect for the taste buds to appreciate. Concluding, there's only a little lace following the liquid down the glass. No matter, this is a very pleasantly full flavored amber ale which makes it good that it's available year round.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Remnants of head continue to cover the surface of the beer until it is gone.

192,607,BNSlums,3.65,"L: An amber-brown pour with a bright white, 2 finger head. SRM 18. Rather transparent with lowly visible carbonation beyond the fluffy head.  S: Caramelized sweet malt and hints of corn. Maple Syrup background, like sweet dark cornbread. Hints of fermented yellow apple.  T: Malt forward that develops tangier over time. It begins as baked brown sugar, than gives way to a bit of hops, washed away by barley and caramel. A fruity zing at the end of apple/cherry.  F: Light and easy drinking. Medium carbonated and a ,medium-light body. Fan-friendly and not satiating.  Right away, I thought the taste of corn would turn me away, but I ended up quite impressed. The balance of sweet malt pulled away from the tang of fruit and slight hop presence, creating a subdued party in my mouth.

Appearance: It pours a gorgeous, deep amber color of perfect clarity with a finger thick sail-white head. It shows moderate carbonation that feeds the head, leaving solid lacing down the glass.  Aroma: A delightful aroma of grains, apple, fennel, toast, biscuit, earthy hops, and mild grassiness.  Taste/Feel: The smooth, medium body follows the nose with grains, apple, fennel, toast, biscuit, and earthy hops to balance the malty flavor profile. Very drinkable with a slightly dry finish.  Overall: This timeless beer is refreshing and full of character. It is a go-to for any time of day, and pairs well with a wide array of foods.

192,607,Shiredave,3.66,"Good looking glass - bright, clear golden leaning towards amber color with a low and persistent head of foam that left some pocked trails. Aroma is German lager-like with floral and herbal notes supported by faint sweetness. Flavor is Amber-lite - a great intro beer for noobies who maybe don't like hops. There is a nice light grainy character that makes it kinda interesting but it lacks body or malt complexity. The mild hop rate is just enough to lend some balance to the watery caramel malt sweet. There is more going on here as it warms a bit, hinting at what this could be if not thinned out for mass appeal. Finish is sudden, slightly dry with a soft caramel sweetness that is not unremarkable. This is better than expected and I've had a lot worse.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,barneyrubble,3.24,Pouring from bottle into tulip glass created a beige foamy head that quickly settled to 1F with no lace. Color is copper at about 80% transparency.  Nose i faint malt and perhaps a faint fruit note and not much else.  On the palate I was surprised at the creamy dryness of the malt and subtle hop presentation. The malt does not have the sweet notes I was expecting and the hops are just green and non descript. I suspect the hops are just doing their job to balance out the fullness of the malt.  Mouthfeel is a bit of a conundrum. At first it feels a bit watery and then it gets quite sticky on the finish. Yup cloying to me on the back of the mouth. Carbonation is light medium and very fine.  I was inspired to try this classic after having an Alaskan Amber which I liked a lot. I wanted to discover more about crystal malt. I expected a bit more malt flavor and perhaps a touch of sweetness.

There are some hop notes, mostly grassy, and some alcohol notes as well. Taste wise, there is a hint of ester up front and it ends boldly with amber malt. As the malt flavor rises, the hops become somewhat noticeable. The mouthfeel isn't anything too special. Its not bad but not the strong point of the beer. Overall, a classic.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BPVandenbroek,3.44,"A- Slightly hazy, decent cream colored head S - Gently male forward aroma, smelling something of caramel malt moving into fruit centered aromas of green apples. Finish is quiet pine scented hops. T - More bread flavored malt forward profile. Malt builds into a well rounded center where I get hints of green apple again, bitter finish. O - Overall, not a bad amber ale as things go.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Zythophile,4.02,"Bottle Date: 2/10/20 Palate Contaminants: ice cream  Nice, clear amber color. I almost expect to see a mosquito from 10 million years ago in it. Plenty of slightly off-white head, very fine. Little to moderate lacing.  Nice and sweet malt. Plenty of citrus and honey, although sugar maybe covers up some of the complexity. Slightly bitter hops that have some light tobacco.  The taste isn't nearly as sweet as the nose. (And I remember tons of sweetness in this one from years ago.) This bottle comes across more like a moderate English bitter. Any flavor from a plant is enhanced (tobacco, hops, and brown tea). There's plenty of weight for what's actually in there, though.  Nice weight, although a swish around the mouth draws a bit of prickly carbonation. Aftertaste is the tea.  Not bad, but not at all what I remember from the tap fifteen years ago.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,MichaelGennings,3.61,New Belgium’s Fat Tire Amber Ale. 5.2 per cent alc. Contract brewed by Steam Whistle in Toronto.  The beer is a nice light to medium amber colour. Lots of tiny ascending bubbles. Medium beige head that evaporates within minutes.  Not much smell to this brew. Some faint malt aroma but that is it.  Taste is sweet caramel malt that is nicely balanced by light hop bitterness.  The beer is light to medium bodied. The finish is crisp with a nice lightly done bitter hop jab.  Nice glass lacing. Definitely a good beer. One you could pretty much enjoy everywhere.  This gets an A- from me.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,KooVee,3.35,"330ml bottle. Bb in 2 months, so quite a flat tire by now.  Clear rusty red colour. Medium foam that does not linger and leaves weak lacing.  Aroma is quite faint. Mainly bread with some nutty overtones. Some toffee when freshly poured.  Taste improves the impression. Biscuity and nutty maltiness, chloride in the water profile, a bit of bitterness walking by the side of sweetness to the end of medium length aftertaste. Carbonation adds a bit of tartness, but I would have left that out and the chloride is a bit distracting too. Overall that is the problem here: overtrying to emphasize maltiness. The Special B and Biscuit malts should have been surrounded by something else.. Vienna as base, some caramel, hops should have made the nose more enticing. Too malt-oriented water profile stresses the thinness of the tricks and the fact the yeast is just too neutral. Can't help but to compare disfavorably with best BPAs from Belgium.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

This beer at 5.2% ABV, is very drinkable, and smooth (and had me asking it's all gone?) Bready, and malty, tasting, sorta nutty finish and for me an after taste similar to a Tootsie Roll. After a while though the after taste seemed to disappear and it had no after taste whatsoever. Nice refreshing and enjoyable beer. Definitely worth a try if you and it are available for a session.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jwp777,3.2,"From the tap at a restaurant poured into a chilled glass:  Beautiful amber color, almost like a dark copper, with a respectable head that lingers for a bit. Leaves a good lacing.  Aroma is a bit underwhelming for me, but it’s not terrible by any means. To me, it is like someone baked a loaf of bread and toasted some peanuts in the same room at the same time.  Taste starts immediately with a fairly strong malt that is somewhat bitter at first, but is followed by a semi-sweet citrus finish (maybe a note of green apple in there but I could be wrong). Moderate carbonation, smooth feel. Not much of an aftertaste.  Overall, solid amber ale.

Sweet, light malt scent. Swirling the glass kicked up a mild stone-fruit scent to join the others.  Somewhat sweet stone-fruit flavor, peaches or apricots. Light malt and hops join in. The aftertaste is a continuation of the main flavor but the bitter hops remain the longest.  Turns into a creamy foam. The relatively light carbonation doesn't cause problems swallowing.

Not that it is bland but nothing particularly memorable about it. Thus I have no qualms about cooling it down in the fridge where other beers of any genre might loose their unique characteristics. It's definitely a light ale.

(4.00)  Aroma: Very mild aromas. Somefaint bread, pale malts and yeast. Slightly toasty. I'm imagining some red fruit, orange peel, apple, red fruit, licorice, earthy caramel. Maybe hints of fennel, but it's a stretch. Also some brown breadiness and biscuity malt flavors. Little to no hops. Restrained. (3.25)  Flavor: Mild flavors of caramel, red fruit, Belgian spice. biscuit and brown bread malt. Sort of breadiness. Relatively dry, simple and clean. (3.50)  Aftertaste/Feel: Moderately carbonated. Yeasty and full. The malt flavors are rounded by the yeast dryness, but nothing is pronounced. (3.75)  Compared to Trader Joe's Dark Lager 3/13/20: Pours a much lighter color. Less roasty and hoppy. More smooth caramel/bready malts. Less roasty, cocoa, and bitterness.  Compared to Summit Brewing English Pale Ale 12/3/20: Pours a slightly darker and clearer color. Milder aromas. More red fruit, fennel, Belgian spice. Less orange, earth and flower. Milder overall. Winner: EPA  Compared to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale 12/3/20: Pours a similar color. More ruby red aromas and less citrus, but overall the aromas strength is about the same. Also, there is similar amounts of caramel malts. The hops may be different, but a very similar caramel malt profile and body. If these two were only malts I don't know that I'd tell them apart. Maybe prefer Pale Ale bc it is more hoppy.  Compared to Odell's 90 Shilling Ale 2/26/21: Pours a slightly lighter color. Milder aromas. More pale malt profile. Less toasted and caramel. Similar malt body and sweetness.  Compared to Smithwicks Red 3/10/22: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More bread malt. Less cola and Vienna notes.  Overall: Nothing is special about this beer. Restrained malt flavors of caramel, apple, and red fruit. Not really getting the green apple and fennel that the website describes, but then again, not getting much of anything. Nor does any hops or yeast. It's balanced, but the combination of dynamic, but weak, flavors all sort of contradict or cancel each other out. It's not really sure what it wants.

192,607,GratefulBeerGuy,3.63,"I have drinking this craft beer classic for a very long time, so imagine my surprise when I realized I never reviewed it! Long over due:  Pours out a clear Amber with golden highlights. A soft and subtle white foam forms high, settles down fast but leaves plenty of coverage and a bit of sticky lace.  The nose had aroma's reminiscent of an English pale ale and Belgian Amber. Exactly how the description states, sweet and toasty style malt, buttery, honey scented with some subtle spice from the yeast. The hops are very subtle in the nose but give off some pine and cedar style effects.  A medium body, crispy and then long and slick malty feel gives this a bit of extra hefty, but deep down it's pretty crispy.  A combo of slightly spicy Belgian-inspired yeast with the honey-soaked bready effect of the malt makes for a very unique amber ale. A little, Belgian, a little English in all the ingredients and American in overall style. Malt and spicy yeast with a subtle hop taste of pine and grasses rounds out the flavor spectrum.  Overall, it's a classic. Unique and fun. Not mind blowingly complex but a nice choice if your in a pinch.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Well, it's hard to tell if this would be drastically better if it was freshly bottled but its a good beer overall. Not what i expected when i saw the words ""Belgian style"" but didn't know it was an amber ale. So i will give this beer a B+",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Pretty good retention and the lacing left behind is an interwoven spiderweb.  Smell - clean and grainy, with some grassy aromas, a hint of leafy hops and a subtle nuttiness. Mineral notes on the nose too.  Taste - mild, very mild with some grainy bits and the slightest suggestion of Belgian style yeast and candi sugar. Could use a little more punch.

The taste is cracker like, slightly toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness and an almost imperceptible tart on the finish.

The flavors are much as expected from the nose with lots of rich lightly bready malt flavors, some light malty sweetness and just a hint of bitterness.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly smooth with the soft and moderate carbonation. The finish is basically a slow sliding away of flavors to an almost dry ending with little or no bitterness  A nice, easily drinkable beer that I'd be fine with having again but which I'll not go out of my way to find again.

Good lacing. Aromas of somewhat toasted, biscuity malts with some caramel sweetness and also a hint of brown sugar. the taste is pretty much the same, with a heavy, somewhat toasted, biscuity, caramel malt sweetness with a hint of brown sugar followed by some earthy, piney hop notes that lend some bitterness. The sweet malt flavors certainly dominate the flavor profile, but the balance from the hops is well implemented here.

192,607,PlinyMeNow,2.68,"Weird, I used to really like this beer and drank it all the time. Now that I'm into big flavor profiles in craft beer, this was a little underwhelming. Pour is clear clean amber without much head but with a lot of lacing. Aroma is faint caramel malts and a muted grassy earthy farm scent - I kept thinking about horse farms and cow dung! Not as bad as that makes it sound though. Taste is mostly malty with a burnt coffee overtone coming through, some herbal hops to balance the malt, and a strange sort of rubber taste (the fat tire?) but there was nothing really exciting. There is a bitter aftertaste. The feel was a bit watery with moderate carbonation. Overall I guess somewhat enjoyable and maybe I'm being unfair to it, but for me it fell short.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SmokySignals,3.86,"The New Belgium Fat Tire, 12 oz. bottle poured into shaker pint glass. A little bit lighter than I expect for an amber, but nice and clear for an ale. Decent thick Head dissipated quickly, leaving a perfect top coating, but no lacing.  The aroma is a mix of floral, citrus/lemon and mildly clover or honey? And faint malts come in nicely somewhere along the ride...followed by a balanced mild hop perk of pastry and spice....more elegant than one might expect. But it makes sense.  Medium-light mouth feel, with light carbonation... very round and smooth, Fat Tire cruises down the ""middle of the road"" nice and easy, and puts a smile on your face. Taste follows the nose, and It finishes nicely balanced, and inviting you to take another ride. Seems to get maltier and more awesome as it warms, and finishes rich and smooth without ever becoming too sweet, though it gets really close. I see why it is served everywhere: ""Asheville Sweet Tea"" I call it, although there are better amber ales made there that would refer to. Crusher, gateway, easy date...  Tried this at Brixx in Asheville a few years ago, and now that I've had a bunch of craft beers, it's even better than I thought back then.

The head has solid retention, leaving a fair amount of lacing before settling into a thin film that rests gently atop the beer. Looks absolutely gorgeous under the light.  The aroma is very doughy and yeasty, with subtle notes of caramel.  The taste has lots of sweet caramel up front, with some biscuits not far behind. The finish is very clean with the faintest hint of hops.  The feel is medium bodied with pretty good carbonation. Incredibly smooth and drinkable.  Overall, am I missing something here? This beer is really good. It's extremely drinkable and well-priced. It isn't the most complex beer by any stretch but it's tasty and well made.

192,607,Gatch,4.17,"The average score indicates that the beer snob is strong with this one...  I cannot believe I didn’t review this beer during my seven years in Arizona from 2005 to 2012, which involved a lot of Fat Tire consumption, especially in the early days when this specific beer was all the rage. So now that it’s being distributed in Massachusetts, I had to drink it again. Really happy to see it make it all the way to the East Coast, considering it was distributed in only a few states when I first drank it back in the mid-2000's. Update: had it on-tap during the 2017 Boston Marathon weekend and it was even better than I remember. Sweet, sugary, roasted malt without being too bready or cloying. Easy-drinking. Just delicious.  Isn’t the goal of craft breweries to distribute in nearly every state and be as ubiquitous as the major brands?! People are such haters and have such short memories. I guarantee most of these low scores are from people who, just a few years ago, wondered why Bud and Miller were the only beers at their local store. This is a legendary beer and brewer that put craft on the map! People realize that this is an Amber, right?! Hops aren’t supposed to be the main aspect of this beer. Malt is the key player here! Sweet, tasty malt. Remember malt, one of four key ingredients in beer?!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,LarryV,3.25,"Fat Tire is new in these parts so I was anxious to give it a try; I found it a bit underwhelming. Nose is mostly malt as is the flavor profile. There's a touch of hoppiness to keep it honest, but it's not very prevalent, overtones of caramel - at least it's not overly sweet. It kind of reminded me of what a cross between Yuengling and SA Boston Lager might taste like. It's a well made beer, but I just find it kind of boring.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Toast and biscuit on the nose, with a slight vegetal note and faint floral scents. As expected, the first sip brought a big biscuity and bready malty flavor. The bitterness appeared on the back end, accompanied by floral notes that played well with the malt. Easy-drinking and medium-bodied.

Mouthfeel is a bit harsh - possibly too much carbonation. The taste is thin maltiness with a tinge of hops and sweet caramel. I am not a big fan of ambers but I am pretty sure this is not a good example of the style. Overall I gave this a 2.75 which is rather low for a New Belgium - normally I like their beers.

192,607,m_hall,3.67,"12 oz. longneck, poured into a nonic pint. A crystal clear, brassy-amber beer topped by a thick, twofingers tall cream colored head, that falls to a film, leaving fairly copious spotty lacing.  Aroma has notes of bread, toffee, very light fruit notes (banana, apricot) and slight musty hops.  Flavors are dominated right up front by bready, biscuit-y malts, with some slightly toasted notes and grain working through the mid-palate and towards a finish with dry nutty notes and just a touch of herbal hop bitterness.  Mouth feel is medium, slightly creamy, and at a modest 5.2% ABV this one is very sessionable.  Fat Tire is nearly everywhere these days (at least in my area) and it's easy to see why. It's not particularly outstanding at any one thing- the flavor profile is a bit one-dimensional, if we're being honest- but then again it doesn't miss the mark at anything really. That lack of complexity does make for broad appeal, and also makes for a beer that pairs very well with most any foods. This is a very natural beer for meals at restaurants or when you just want something with just enough substance while still being very easy to crush in large amounts. Solid.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,lwcreasy,3.41,"Light copper in color. Inch of white head drops quickly to a film on top of the cloudy brew. Carbonation is visible and there is a very light speckling of lace on the sides of the glass.  Moderate intensity malt is the main aroma to start- biscuit, slight toffee and caramel. A whiff of cooked cabbage (tad of DMS?) and veggies whaffing upward. Unfortunately this nearly out-shadows the quite affable smell of stone fruit that more readily appears as the beer is warming. When its nice and open, the strawberry and biscuit are quite pleasant.  Rich biscuity malt is the first note on the tongue. The beer's backbone becomes more of the grainy-sweet type, especially on the last half of each sip. O.k. finish of more grain. Slight herbal quality to the hops that has to do battle with the less pleasant vegetal-grain hybrid that is increasing in intensity. Still quite nice in spite.  Medium body. Solid finish- not too dry or sweet.  Bonus points for being one of the OG craft beers for me. Finish really could've done with a bit more yum, either from the elevation of the stone fruit or perhaps more of that homey biscuit impression. It's only that inkling of DMS worth knocking in this brew. Solid overall.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,PDGreenB,3.67,The Fat Tire is a very smooth Amber ale with an easily sessionable feel. The taste is very mild and malty with a slightly sweet smell.

Does not overstay its welcome, just a tiny bit sticky but not bad at all. Texture is this beer's finest point.  Overall: If you want a no-frills, middle of the road beer that tastes nice without overwhelming the senses, drink it. I'm not a big fan, but it's okay every now and then.

Caramel and biscuity notes are present in the smell which gives you fair warning of the maltiness of the taste. Very bready taste and its not bad.

Taste is up front bread, rolls to toasted malts and caramel. Flavor does linger for a while after drinking. Feel is light to medium body with no carbonation to it. Overall a solid beer, easily drinkable and meant for all around use. Flavor is probably strong enough to pair with red meats, may overpower poultry save for game meats or bbq.

192,607,Fear4Beer,4.34,"Just an outstanding beer. It is so refreshing and smooth. It isn't trying to be some over the top powerhouse of a beer. It is malty, low bitterness (IBU), and sessionable with a modest 5.20% ABV. I had this beer sitting in my den and before drinking it I didn't have great expectations because I just figured I wouldn't like this beer style very much. I was pleasantly wrong! I'll be coming back to this beer. I haven't drank Bud Light, Coors, Miller, etc in years. I'd drink this any day over those.

192,607,shabbtastic,2.53,Always wanted to try New Belgium as its new to our area and boy was I disappointed. It starts out looking good in the glass but it's a downhill from there and rather steeply I might add. Smells of wet dog fur - very musty and dank. The taste up front is solid and gets your hopes up only to disappoint with a stinging dry bland follow. If this is a benchmark from New Belgium my enthusiasm for another one of their offerings has fizzled just like their Amber Ale did half way through my pint. Just an average beer in a cool bottle and hyped beyond deserving.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Smell: Loads of sweet caramel malt, a touch of slightly bitter grassy hops and a hint of roasted nuts.  Taste: Rich, yet smooth and restrained flavors of caramel and cornbread upfront. A very nice, dry, grassy, European noble hop note on the end to round it all off. The beer goes down easy and as you become accustomed to the taste, hints of toffee, molasses and toasted nuts emerge.  Feel: Light and supple. Low carbonation. Silky and thin. A little too watery.

Unobtrusive and balanced taste. Not too much going on, just the right proportion of biscuity malts and hops. A bit light bodied. It's Fat Tire: you know what you're getting. No huge flavors here, but just a tasty and well-made amber ale. Despite saying ""Belgian Style Ale"" on the can, there's nothing Belgian about this at all.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,FBarber,3.63,"So in the photo above you can see the old version has a much more robust head compared to the new version - however I poured the new version second, so it is clear the head on the new version is lackluster. Color is essentially the same between the versions - it is a clear, light amber color.  Aroma on the old version is predominantly malty with some lightly toasted malts, bready, and a touch of light hops. The new version is still malty, but it lacks the toasted malt character and instead it trends sweeter on the nose. There are still some subtle hoppy notes on the back end. If you were not really paying attention I am not sure you would really catch the difference on the nose, but if you are paying attention to it, they are clearly different beers.  Taste on the old version is malty with notes of toasted bread, some bready malt and floral hops coming through on the back end. It is very mild and approachable as well as balanced between the components. The new version is malty, but again, it is a much sweeter malt character than the old version. It almost reminds me of a cream ale the way it comes across. The hops are there, but very subtle and subdued. It is easy drinking, but ultimately lacks the depth of flavor from the older version.  Feel Is very similar in both beers outside of higher carbonation on the newer version. Otherwise these are both light bodied, easy drinking beers.  Overall I definitely prefer the old version to the new version. That toasted malt character really adds a nice complexity to the beer that the new one lacks. The new version is not bad by any means, but it does seem to be simplified. And with a beer that was already very straightforward and simple, I am not sure it was a change for the best.  My prior rating on the old version was 3.63. (3.63/5 rDev +0.8% | look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5) ______________________  Poured a nice amber color with a thin off white head.

FEEL: Good level of carbonation, medium thin body, a little slick up front and slightly drier on the finish. OVERALL: Not bad.

A - light amber in color with a slight hint of haze, but minimal. Tight white head quickly fades to a ring of thin lace leaving a few splotches of stick.  S - bright fruity hops with rose pedals and an excellent suggestion of watermelon? Biscuit malt rounds out a very nice nose.  T - fruity hops and biscuit malt blend very well. Some Belgian sugar and mild cherry.  M - a touch on the light side and usually I want thicker and stickier from this style, but Fat Tire has an unusual quality going on and makes for not only a bright flavorful amber ale, but one that's very refreshing.  O - I had Fat Tire years ago, and while that review was lost in time I once again stumbled across this while out of town for work in the beautiful state of WV. This is a very good ale and one I can add to the list of introduction into the craft beer world. New Belgium have stood the test of time thus far and rightfully so.

The style always seems to be pretty good, but not amazing, and Fat Tire is no exception.  Had on draft and yeah, it looks sorta amber, sorta light brown. It smells mild and unassuming. It tastes malty and bready and ever so slightly nutty and spicy. It feels pretty light, you could drink a couple of this without any issue. Overall this is a standard, solid beer.

Nose is somewhat leafy and mushroomy, also some toast in there, but overall fairly mild.

Flavor broadened some after the beer warmed a little above fridge temperature. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly firm, a bit creamy on the backside. In general, I was surprised that not too much was going on with this beer - considering its reputation, I guess.  Brown bottle, best-by date on label 12JUN16.

Biscuit-like malt: sure. Hoppy freshness? No. The aftertaste was something nutty but not in a very pleasing way. Body was pretty light and way too much carbonation. All in all it tasted watered down.

Really nice malt flavor coming off this one, and the hops are there just enough to keep things in check and add spiciness/earthiness to the beer. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth and the beer goes down super easy. Its just a damn good beer, nothing fancy, just solid stuff.  PS: Mind you 80% of my beer drinking is from IPAs!

This beer pours an coppery orange color with a minimal white head. Not too much of a smell. Smells kind of malty. Taste is subtle. It is sweet and is not too hop or malt forward.

Pours with a thin creamy-white head that slowly dissipates, yet remains present after several minutes. Impressive lacing, considering the container's temporary purpose. Color is golden amber, accentuated by diffused light through the plastic cup. Clarity is highlighted from light reflected from wing. Difficult to judge smell due to extemporaneous influences.

It drinks very smoothly and does not attack the palate with too much malt, yeast, nor hops. It is not the lighter empty taste of a standard pilsner, nor the bitter hop attack of an IPA. It is simple a good tasting middle-of-the-road beer that is pleasant to drink but not all that memorable.

192,607,Beginner2,3.72,"Listed in the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die"", Fat Tire has gotten to the elevated status of a ""classic""... reserved for, let's say, a dozen American craft brews. There is good reason for this. Much like the grand-daddy of American crafters classics (Anchor Steam), Fat Tire is the brewery's cash cow that makes all their innovation possible (including employee ownership.)  Had many times over the years, I just now increased only the overall rating .25 to acknowledge its classic status. I think Fat Tire's softness varies a lot based on carbonation, can, bottle, tap and temperature. But if you try a brew in many different circumstances with an increasing variety of foods and it always seems to pass, it arrives at ""classic.""  The malty fruitiness seems to emulate within at least two of New Belgium's lines and, more importantly, by other brewers; giving it the classic status more than any other quality that Fat Tire offers. A nice, balanced finish leaves a lasting impression and, presumably, return customers.  MJ's 1999 ""Guide"" only gives Fat Tire 2.5 of 4 stars and called it ""soft, malty, fruity."" I second that, probably to the nth degree.  6/29/20 While I had again with dinner (proving this brew's versatility yet again), there is nothing good I said that I can take back. Classic. But with the employees now selling out to a major brand manager, nothing more needs to be said from me. I hope the new owners respect the role Fat Tire and New Belgium has played. I'm now keeping count over at UnTappd.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

It remains the same into the back end and into the aftertaste, with some hop bitterness surfacing near the end.  Overall: My first American Amber/Red Ale style of beer. This is a widely known and popular beer around here, so it was only a matter of time before I had it.

Carbonation could be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated evenly and at a nice pace. Thin stringy lacing. The smell had a semi-sweet caramel maltiness with some light toast, toffee and nuts to blend nicely. Light earthy bitterness. The taste was somewhat sweet, and bitterness seemed tamer. Fruity aftertaste, sly quick dry finish. The mouthfeel was about light bodied. Carbonation felt fine. Sweetness sticks to my tongue in a nice manner. Overall, to me, when I lived in Alaska, it was easy to find on tap everywhere.

Nose quality very good, and from the first sip the impression was that hit everything right in the sweet spot, so to speak. Flavor, carbonation, aftertaste were all quite desirable and easily left us all wanting another.

192,607,DovGibor,3.08,"Poured from folly pack can (best by 1-17-16) into stemmed glass. Light amber color with white head. Low head retention.  Nose is all sweet malt; no discernible hops. Mouthfeel is medium, but doesn't add anything to the beer. Sits there without being light and crisp, but also not rich and fulfilling. The flavor is light malt with a tiny touch of hop bitterness, but not much else.  I heard great things about Fat Tire, and perhaps my bar was set too hight. I understand how this stands out from 'macro' beer, and how 30 years ago it was a revelation. Unfortunately I do not believe it is a revelation today. It's not making any big mistakes, but it's also not doing anything to win me over. I believe there are much better amber ales available and while I enjoy other New Belgium offerings, I do not see myself picking this up again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Pantalones,3.9,"Second and last bottle of this one from the fall Folly pack; best-by date is November 29th, 2015.  Pours a dark gold/amber color; darker once in the glass, almost leaning toward orange especially in the spots the light hits -- there's one spot near the bottom of my glass that's coming across as this really nice bright ""sunset orange"" type color with the angle the lights in my apartment are hitting it from right now. Quite clear, and with lots of little bubbles rising up from the bottom. Very nice head of foam on top too, white and fluffy with a really nice texture to it. Filled my pint glass up to the rim at first, but now has shrunk to about a third of its initial size, leaving some trails behind around the edges of the glass in a few place. It's a great-looking beer.  Not especially strong smell-wise, you definitely have to get in close to the glass and sniff, but what's there is pretty nice. I'm getting mainly toasty smells from this one right away, maybe a little bit of a caramel-y sweetness mixed in there too. On one of several sniffs I picked up just a hint of piney hop in there, too, but it's pretty clear that this is a beer that leans more toward the malt side. Interestingly, toward the end of the glass the toastiness in the smell fades a bit and a fruity smell comes out more. Hops, or perhaps yeast?  Taste, like the smell, has a lot of toasty and slightly-sweet malt. Much richer and tastier than the smell would indicate, actually -- starts off milder (similar to the smell) and then the malty flavors come in pretty strong, lingering for just a bit after swallowing and then fading away. A bit of lingering toastiness at first, with some sweetness coming in along with it at around the halfway point. Burps are slightly fruity and slightly piney, interestingly -- so yeah, the hops I smelled occasionally are still there, they just can't power their way through the malt enough to be tasted much. Though now that I'm past the halfway point of the glass I'm starting to taste just a bit of hops in there, too. Basically no detectable bitterness until the tiniest hint came in on the very last little sip, though I imagine the hops are busy doing their job to balance things and keep it from seeming super sweet. Overall, it's a pretty simple flavor, but what it does, it does very well -- if you like toasty malt flavors, you will like this beer.  Mouthfeel is also really nice, and works together very well with the taste. Very smooth, soft feel to it; incredibly drinkable (I'm seriously almost having difficulty *not* taking huge gulps -- if I was in a restaurant that had this on tap, I'd order another one when I was done with the first for sure!), but at the same time it's far from feeling too thin or watery -- it definitely feels more substantial than the several pale lagers I've had recently.  Overall, this is a nice beer, one that I don't think I fully appreciated the first or second time I had it -- but now, nearly a year later, I have to say it's one that I'll probably be buying again and again in the future (though I'm sure a lot of those times will just be the two that come in every one of New Belgium's variety packs, rather than Fat Tire on its own.) It's a pretty simple beer, and not one that's an aroma/flavor explosion like some big IPA or stout, but it's one where all the features of the beer (whether you mean malt, hops, yeast, etc. or taste, feel, etc.) work together so nicely that it's hard not to like it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,GreesyFizeek,3.64,"On tap at Nicola Pizza in Rehoboth Beach, DE.  This one pours a clear medium amber, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.  Smells like caramel malt, toasted malt, and some slight fruitiness.  I can't believe I'm finally trying this one. It's certainly good, typical toasty/caramelly amber ale flavors, but not the most interesting beer ever. It's drinkable as it's best quality.  This is light bodied, crisp and bready, with a higher level of carbonation.

A little carbonation with a half finger of off white foam reducing to a bubbly froth.  Aroma: I don't have a real good nose but I was getting a fresh, sweet floral smell with some maltiness.  Taste: Right off the bat it was a malty,fruity taste. Some hop flavor was coming in but it was only a little. To me the flavor is just delicious.  Mouth Feel: Nice medium bodied beer. Smooth and creamy feeling. Finish lingers.  Overall: This has become my ""go to"" beer.

T - Taste follows the nose pretty closely. Victory (biscuit) malt is the strongest flavor. There is also a light caramel/sweet malt flavor that is just behind the toasty and biscuity flavors. Hops are well balanced, with a earthy/floral flavor and clean bitterness that balances the sweeter malt flavors. M - Slightly sweet with enough carbonation that keeps it from becoming cloying. O - A little on the sweet side for me, and the biscuit notes get a little bit annoying after a while.

Nice malt sweetness up front and then a spicy slightly bitterness on the end. Nice mouth feel with a lower abv and a decent amount of carbonation, not much but a nice caramel sweetness on the back of the tongue. Overall, I wasn't expecting much from this beer, I'm not sure why, but was pleasantly surprised that the sweetness on the nose isn't overwhelming and is really kept in line with a nice hoppiness on the end.

Rising bubbles are subtle. SMELL: Malty. I love it. Mild aromas of pale malts, caramelized malts, and biscuity malts combine with subtle spicy and bitter hops aromas. Not very balance, but I don't care. Call me the malt man. TASTE: Strong biscuity malt flavors meet with mild caramelized malts to create the intial taste. Mild buttered bread (snuck by my nose), pale malt, and spicy hop flavors combine with subtle bitter hop flavors to finish off the taste as initial flavors persist. FEEL: Medium-bodied with surprisingly high carbonation. There is a slight syrupy feel to the brew as it travels and sticks to the back of the throat.

192,607,hopphead31415,4.06,"I’m not gunna lie. I first tried this beer when I was like 12 and it was something I sampled several times throughout my teenage years. I drank it only seldom in my adult life, but wanted to drink it again while I generate my review for it in order to ensure the most accurate review. It gives this beer a nostalgic component that might increase its overall score by a half point or so. So keep that in mind.  Look-It pours a perfect amber color (and is clear) that the Brewers really nailed. The head is off-white and 2 fingers foamy, but then settles down to a thinner layer.  Smell-The aroma is biscuit, fruity, a pinch of yeast and herbal hops that are almost imperceptible.  Taste-This crisp and drinkable beer brings joy to your body as it fills your mouth with a pleasant smoky breaded malt-forward, but inconspicuous flavor where the hops are mild and herbal.  Mouthfeel-This beer is crisp, smooth, and with mild carbonation. I would say that this brew is well-balanced and subtle. This beer is not loud and obnoxious. It is perfect and it is mild.  Overall-Like I said, this beer has a nostalgic component for personal reasons, but it is such a great go-to beer that I can’t help but give it praise. The components are all humble and quiet, but if you listen then you’ll pick up on a chorus of beauty and flavor that is unlike any other amber ale.

I think I drank a few cases one summer when I was first drinking beer- it was one of the first craft beers I developed a taste for and then I got tired of it. I had one for the first time in years at an Indian restaurant that didn't have great selection and was pleasantly surprised. Sure it's nothing earth shattering but in an approachable way its actually remarkably complex. What we have is a Belgian influenced American take on a classic English style: a big biscuity sweet malty body hopped just a little heavier and pinier than an English beer with that weird funky Belgian yeast flavor.

192,607,TheMadJack,3.22,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass.  A: Gave the beer a firm pour. It settled in about 20 seconds to a dull white, fluffy head, which itself settled after a minute or two. Good strong lacing on the glass. The beer is quite clear and to the orange side of amber, with the occasional bubble.  S: Nose has the expected biscuit base with a fair bit of clover honey and a smattering of secondary aromas. Lemon peel and a hint of green olives come to mind. As it warms some nuttiness, like peanut butter, comes forward.  T: Crackery malts, somewhere between a wheat thin and a water cracker, dominate. Light, pilsnery hop bitterness arrives second, and the finish has a faint green-tea aspect.  M: Decent weight lends to the bready character of the beer. Finish is lingering and a little sticky.  D: This is a good beer but not a great beer. The emphasis on malt is a nice change of pace in a hop-obsessed culture. Don't have this beer with a sandwich, it's too much bread in your meal. Instead, try it with some cold cuts, some cold sliced vegetables, and some chunks of sharp cheese. Too heavy to be a session beer but a good one to keep on hand throughout an afternoon.

T - Malt forward, with a caramel and wheat bread note, and a slightly bitter hop note in the close.  M - Light and easy on the tongue, a good drinker.  O - A solid amber that delivers a solid malt forward brew, with subtle but delicious bread flavor, and a clearing, clean close that keeps things rolling along. An easily drinkable beer perfect for a long, multi-bottle session.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,GerryPendry,3.55,"A decent beer. Nice head, definitely malt-forward sweet biscuit, a little hint of roastiness, nice earthy hop flavor with understated bitterness. I first tried this beer 15 or 16 years ago when it already had a cult following but was much harder to find. Then, as now, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Maybe the hype was justified in the late 90s, when great beer was harder to find. Maybe BA should add a ""Nostalgia factor"" to the rating categories.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Appearance: Pours a bright, clear, light copper with 1/2"" sandy head. Impressive lacing and fair retention. Still true in 2019.  Aroma: Amber ale-y - not too sweet, slight hoppiness; definitely a malt-forward brew. Allowing this to warm brings out much more character. Still, a subtly fruity nose; vague pear/apricot esters. Malt-forward.  Taste: Rich arrival, then quickly feels thin. Not as malty or as sweet or as toasty as Mt. Carmel or Bell's Amber ales; this is cleaner, lighter, fresher. Still true relative to other ambers, but not a thin brew by any stretch. Fluffy ale texture is appreciated. Lingering pear-like ale esters. The yeast really is the star here.  Mouthfeel: Active carbonation; light, crisp. Lighter side of mid-weight; fluffy, fairly clean finishing for a malt-forward beer.  Overall: This is a really light amber ale; I'd put this against Boston Lager or Eliot Ness Lager for how light and clean it seems for an ale. I would have expected a heavier, slicker, sweeter treatment. But given that Boston Lager and Eliot Ness are two of my favorites, it's in good company. I'd definitely buy this again, but won't seek it out. On second consideration, that is still true. Less hoppy than Boston Lager, less malty than Eliot Ness. Has more expressive yeast character than either, and has that ale texture that those lack. It’s a good beer to have around to give to guests who are new to craft beer or for pairing with food. I typically buy amber ales specifically for that purpose. However some ambers keep really well, and my impression of this one is it is way better fresh.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Kelby777,3.4,"Tried Fat Tire earlier today, and I am finally sober enough to write a review for it.  Poured delicately into a dimpled beer stein. The temperature of the beer was in the mid 30's. I have also tried Fat Tire at a slightly warmer temperature - at around 45 degrees.  Appearance - Very beautiful appearance. The color is a shade of amber and resembles light maple syrup. White frothy head (when poured at a warmer temperature) with a nice lacing around the glass. Appears to be of high carbonation.  Smell - Wonderful and distinct smell. Grassy hops is definitely the dominant aroma here.  Taste - Has a hop bite to it, but it doesn't linger on the tongue for a while like other ales do. It has a bitter taste from the hops, but the average beer drinker would be able to handle it. I personally don't dig the bitter hop taste, but it won't prevent me from drinking it.  Mouth feel - It has a nice carbonated mouth feel, however, it could be thicker. I found it has a thinner mouth feel than a typical macro beer.  Overall - This makes a great session beer. It is not one I would drink everyday but if I were offered it, I would not decline it. It's good to get away from the macro beers now and again.

Beautiful amber color, smells a bit fruity, nice refreshing taste with a little bite on the end that's barely noticeable but a good contrast to the sweetness up front. There's a reason this one is usually the one craft choice at a lit of dives around here; good quality but not big flavored enough to scare your BMC crowd away.

Fat Tire is a not as hoppy as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or ubiquitous as Sam Adams Boston Lager, but a gateway into craft beer for many nonetheless.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

This could just be some idiosyncratic observation of mine, but the rising carbonation bubbling look bigger than they do in most beers. Overall, an okay look; I would have liked more head.  Smell - 3.75/5 Smells like an Amber should. A deep malty-alcohol smell, with perhaps fruity undertones.  Taste - 3.5/5 Tastes similar to the smell, at least to some extent. A sweet malty-alcohol taste, with some notes of piney hops, fruitiness, perhaps caramel as well. I wasn't expecting the pineyness, and not sure whether I like it. Luckily it's fairly subtle.  Mouthfeel - 4.25/5 The beer is fairly light in body, the carbonation is quite strong, but not too overpowering. I like the slight bite of the carbonation when I drink this beer.

I have turned to Fat Tire when needing a sessionable yet flavorful beer. It's a great Amber Ale. Bitterness is balanced quite well with the sweetness. New Belgium knows what they are doing with this beer. It's a common, accepted beer staple in much of the Western States. It's a good balance and easy drinker, way above average adjunct lagers and other mass produced cereal beers. IMO, this brew has it's rightful place. A good quality brew for the craft beer beginner, or one looking for a quality easy drinker without having to sacrifice quality and taste.

192,607,hoptheology,2.78,"Serving Style : 12 oz bottle/poured into 8 oz glass for appearance  Appearance (3) : Copper colored and slightly opaque. Has a foamy white lace that disappears quickly.  Smell (2) : Bitter bean, dark wheat. Rye. Damp cellar. Pretty gross.  Taste (3.25) : Full flavored rush of black bean and red wheat. Dull rubbery bitterness accompanies the flavors. Light cilantro notes with hits of fresh room-temperature celery. The rubber bitterness then turns to copper bitterness with a backlap of tomato and rye; and it hits hard but leaves quick as to not be totally distasteful. The body and flavor are decent, although wildly all over the place.  Mouthfeel (2) : The mouthfeel on the other hand is not something I'm fond of. I don't like the sticky finish on this one or the rubbery mouthfeel. My sample had harsh and generous carbonation that pricks your mouth and leaves a bitter and dry aftertaste.  Overall (2.78) : I've had far better Ambers than this. The damp musty smell and prickly mouthfeel bring down the scores quite a lot. Taste is above average but barely - and it's all over the place.

Both smells are rather muted, however. Not bad, almost an imitated of Yuengling (which is a lager, fyi), but neither the malt nor the hops are particularly robust. Just OK. 3/5  T: Again, just OK. Lightly kilned caramel malt imparts a toasty and sweet taste. Hops are apparent, but they aren't robust enough and I barely taste them. Like a watered-down Yuengling (although this beer is an ale). 3/5  M: Smooth and crisp, but nothing special. 3/5  O: Not that good. Taste is rather bland.

Smells like a great amber as well, somewhat modest with a sweeter scent. Not too much of a punch in the flavor however I find the mellow quality desirable. THere is a bit of an alcholic taste at first then dies down to a numbing sensation. Mouthfeel is incredible. Full thickness of the amber brew lingers in my mouth.

192,607,BEERchitect,3.37,"Incredibly popular, New Belgium's banner beer is an ale that's caught in an identity crisis. Its it an American amber ale, an Irish red ale or is it a Belgian pale ale? Where the taste tilts to Irish, there's much more to consider in this fairly complex but understated ale.  Its honey-amber hue is a lead in to its toasted flavor and freshly kilned grain aroma to seep into the initial senses. Faint caramel, peanut and a bready-sweet taste is elegant on just off of caramel with bread crust and biscotti instead.  Its dextrin-rich body is creamy, starchy and smooth- allowing its cream corn center to give a faint butterscotch flavor as its malty grain flavors offer smoothness and a creamy medium weight. Herbal hops are tea-like and mildly citrus; even as cinnamon and clove spiciness tether through the sweet breadiness and indicate a turn to closure.  Spicy in finish, a moderate pepper taste and feel highlights its mild alcohol warmth that outlasts is starchy malt upstart. Semi-dry in finish, only a mild bitterness and tepid spice complement balances the taste in those waning sips.  Friendly and unoffensive, the allure of the ale lies in its non-polarizing taste and its understated complexity.

192,607,zimm421,2.82,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. Appears a beautiful deep amber that is very clear. The head is off-white, fairly thin, but has some lacing left behind.  The nose is all sweetness, with loads of caramel. That's it. One-dimensional. The taste is bland. Again, no complexity here just caramel and breadiness. A slight touch of bitterness on the back-end which attempts to balance it out, but fails.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of stickiness on the back side. Carbonation levels are too low, and I think bumping them up a touch could improve this quite a bit. Overall, a good entry-level brew, and a great way to bring people into craft beer, but not something I ever reach for any more.

192,607,GeorgeMenton722,3.45,"Overall Fat Tire brews a good amber ale. There isn't anything exceptional about this beer, but there isn't anything you can really complain about either.

Almost like a good burger, it features the classic taste that you expect without anything extra that may set it apart.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Peanuts, wheat thins, a twist of lemon and fading toastiness to end. Faint C-hop orange rind finish and clean tingly linger. Light, crisp, slightest cling.  OK, it’s watery, there’s really no hops and it’s Crystal 20 at a push. There’s still just enough flavor to shock a BMC drinker. I wouldn’t stick with it myself, but I see where it makes sense.

192,607,scratch69,3.78,I poured a bottle into a pilsner glass.  Appearance- Clear copper color with a fingers worth of head. Fair amount of lacing.  Smell- Caramel malt and biscuit aroma with a hint of yeast.  Taste- Very similar to the nose but with a more pronounced caramel malt sweetness. It has just enough fruity hop flavor to balance it out.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied and very smooth.  Overall- Many years ago this beer and Samuel Adams are what got me into trying different craft beers. I decided to try it again and it was like revisiting an old friend that I haven't seen for years. Very good beer that I need to drink more often.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

It's well balanced, has a great body/mouthfeel and I love the toasty malty qualities. It pairs well with most meals, however I think it's especially great with anything Italian. I've had it with homemade pizza and with lasagna and both were prime.  Definitely a solid beer that I will be drinking for a good while.

192,607,CalgaryFMC,3.69,"Bottle from a six-pack poured into a shaker pint glass. The first New Belgium beer to hit Alberta (along with Ranger IPA) and not a surprising choice at all considering that this is basically a craft beer legend in terms of broadening the mainstream drinker's horizons and helping to set the stage for the wonderful scenario we enjoy today (i.e, the widespread availability of beer that contains flavor). A coppery red-bronze brew with a moderate amount of whitish head and an aroma centered on biscuity, nutty malts, the overall impression is one of flavorful but not cloying biscuit and pecan nut flavors, supplemented by a little red apple skin and faint strawberry creme and pine flavors ... This latter element must be the hops making their presence known just enough to cut some of the sweetness. Others taste some Belgian influence here. I do not, although I suppose there is a rather more assertive yeast flavor than would be typical for a red ale and a middling rummy candi sugar vibe somewhere in the mix. All in all, its relatively safe, a great showcase for biscuit malt flavors, sweet but not overly so, there's a pleasingly moderate degree of carbonation, and the whole thing is tied together like a room featuring the Dude's rug.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Taste: The taste of fat tire is a lot like the aroma except that I don’t get any yeast or bread taste like there was in the aroma.

192,607,thehyperduck,3.79,"355 mL bottle served well-chilled; best before May 25. One of several American classics that I picked up on my last cross-border trip.  Pours a clear, golden-amber colour, generating nearly two fingers' worth of fluffy, off-white head at the surface. It maintains cohesion for quite a long while, slowly condensing into a dense, creamy cap thickest around the edge of the glass. Great lacing, too - just an attractive-looking beer all-around. The aroma is fairly subdued, consisting of some bready malts, toasted nuts, caramel and some earthier notes.  A tasty, straightforward amber ale. Caramel, crystal malt and grainy sweetness grab my attention first, with toasted biscuit and nuts soon taking over. It finishes with the hops, which provide an earthy, slightly spicy conclusion to the sip. The aftertaste is a little nutty and bitter, perhaps reminiscent of almond, though not lingering on the palate terribly long. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation that lightly prickles the palate. Easy to drink, and enjoyable to do so - it's rare for me to polish off the glass before the review, but here we are.  [Updated July 13 2019]  Tallboy from The Beer Store; dated Jun 7 2019 and served slightly chilled. Now available in Canada - or Ontario, at least - I don't think I've had this since 2014, and my opinion hasn't changed much, if at all. Fat Tire is one of the best examples of a basic, malt-forward amber ale I've ever tried. Not the most unique example of the style, but this particular brew has a lot of history behind it and is a damn fine beverage regardless. Märzen fans might find this to be an agreeable year-round alternative, but anyone seeking out a reliable, lighter ale that keeps the hop bill in check should give this bike a test run.

Taste: Some caramel maltiness with a slightly bitter finish. No hop presence other than the hint of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Light with lively carbonation. A very refreshing brew.  Overall: An unimposing beer than is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Tastes like a toned-back Maerzen, which is itself not an imposing style.

192,607,Brewji,4.3,"Beer hipsters in the US have claimed for some time now that the Fat Tire Amber Ale (ABV 5.2%) from New Belgium Brewing is the coolest, best beer in the USA, and that I have to try it. Well, now that I see it's available in BC, I went out and bought some. It's apparently one of the most well-travelled brews in the states, and it's been well-received.  Time for your average beer appreciator (AKA Brewji) to take a sip and tell you what it's really like.  On first sniff, the aroma reminded me of biscuits, sweet biscuits...not in a bad way. It had almost a bready-biscuit aroma, if I may. Biscuit and malt? I'm not quite sure, but definitely not a bad aroma.  So I went in for the first sip, and was surprised at how well the flavours work together to make this a solid amber ale. The aroma of the biscuit-bread translates into a rustic, amber ale taste with a hint of sweetness and malt to brush all of the necessary taste buds on my palate.  Why was I surprised? Beer hipsters (AKA snobs) generally annoy me, and the fact that a lot of them recommended this beer to me made me have slightly lower-than-average expectations. However, New Belgium has done well with this one. I've had a couple of other brews from them as well, and have never been disappointed (yet).  Either way, take a good look at the label, and see if you can find this at your local liquor or beer store. It's definitely worth the pick-up. It stands out against most ambers on the market, and at $14 for a 6-pack (in Canada, beer is expensive), it's quite the steal.  So there you have it, the Fat Tire from New Belgium Brewing. I recommend this to newbies who are trying to transition out of the econo-lager phase and into ales. This, and the Blue Buck from Phillips are great transition-ers.  New Belgium Brewing's Fat Tire gets a surprisingly-not-so-hipster 8.5 / 10 (or 4.25 / 5 on Beer Advocate).",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Dark bread, caramel, raw sunflower seeds, and a slight earthy hop bite are most distinguishable. As it warms I get a slightly funky stale aftertaste.

Savory, smooth ... became my ideal first choice whenever I left Florida. When job situation changed, I played the Smokey and the Bandit card with friends who were traveling from northern climes (mostly from GA). Even made a few road trips myself (1 hour) to grab some amber deliciousness. There had never before been a beer I was willing to drive some distance to obtain. On 29 June 2013 my quests for New Belgium's Flagship Brew became super easy as Florida welcomed Fat Tire and her band of brothers/sisters to the Sunshine State.

I must admit, however, having been to many countries in Europe, having lived there (Germany), and beer around the states a lot, I hope I've developed an at least ok taste in beer haha. There is something different about Fat Tire. I feel like along with its increasing availability in average cities also comes its unique taste. I am not the biggest fan of amber ales, but this one is smoooth. The biscuit taste stays in my mouth, without any overwhelming bitter taste at all. And it's amazing when you're outside hanging out in the park or playing frisbee, having a bbq, whatever.

Poured into a clear balloon snifter.  A - Pours a nice coppery amber orange colored body with some okay clarity, and about a finger and a half of fluffy soapy off-white head. Decent head retention with some good thick scattered lacing. Looks pretty nice.

Light lingering breadiness / stickiness. Easy drinking, light bodied, & with nice carbonation.  Overall, a nice every day easy drinking amber ale from New Belgium; it's easy to see why this is their flagship beer.

The beer is a true amber or copper color. It looks nice. The smell of this beer is fairly complex, with some grassy straw characteristics, a little bit of malt backbone and a nice hop profile I'm guessing is a cascade variety. The nose is a hint at whats to come, but not overpowering at all. Giving this beer a first taste and holding it in my mouth for a second the prickly carbonation gives way to a mild maltiness, some light citrus flavors and that delicious hop finish. Everything in the nose of this brew is detectable in flavor, and the flavor is really good. No single ingredient is overwhelming the other and I might even dare say this beer is a tad light, but it's balanced and very enjoyable! The mouth feel of this beer is pretty watery. I would say it's the weakest point of this beer and may lead to it feeling lighter than it really is. It is however not enough to detract from the big picture.  Overall this is my new go to beer. It just started getting distributed to the Dayton Area in Ohio and I am now a big believer in it.

It brings back memories as one of the first ales I ever drank therefore has a certain sentimental value personally. It will be a good introduction for many to craft beers and ales in general since it is being sold at many places in the area now that don't have much of a selection.  I'm reviewing a 22oz bottle poured into a pint mug, and it poured with a nice head. It has a wonderful amber color that is very inviting, as should an amber ale, and has very nice clarity as well. It is a good example of an amber ale, thought doesn't have a very strong taste, there is a good balance between flavors with a slight bitterness. It has the good characteristic of being easy to drink yet filling at the same time.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,saltytom,3.79,A very good beer and good representation of an amber ale. Bought at Sam's Club in 22 oz. bottle. Poured into a Sam Adam's pint glass. Nice head with nice lacing.

192,607,AMJones,4.47,"Wonderful Amber Ale. This style is by far my favorite and New Belgium nails it with a biscuity smell that I crave.

Slight, crisp herbal hop finish. No fruitiness, diacetyl or astringency detected. Beautiful color somewhere between a pale and amber with perfect clarity.

Hints of toffee and butterscotch. Some corn is in the mix as well. The flavors are crisp and refreshing. Very earthy. Slightly sweet. More caramel. Healthy amount of malts. Hops are very subtle. More corn. More butterscotch. Mouthfeel is awesome. It's medium-bodied but creamy and fluffy with active carbonation. It's extremely smooth and very drinkable.

The aroma is rather grainy, in a good, pleasant, bready manner. There is some earthy/gardeny notes to it as well.  Up front, this beer has a good bready tone to it, with a little sweetgrass to top it off. A wheat flavor continues all the way through to the earthy end.  The mouthfeel is light medium bodied.

""ENJOY BY 30MAR14"" stamped on the lower right of the label. Also stamped there is 55619 for those interested.  A Translucent very light copper body under a brief but one inch head that was gone after 60 seconds. Fine, safe look. 3.0  S Light biscuit malt and little hops. I am reminded that this beer is entirely drinkable, the best feature of the beer. This smell is somewhat interesting and a rather welcome smell, providing some degree of comfort and ease. It is certainly a better smell than BMC. 3.5  T Barley malt centric light amber taste with a swoosh of hops in the latter one third of the taste. Again, it is apparent why this is not only very drinkable but a very popular beer. Indeed it has been mentioned by many Beer Advocates as one of their early inspirations into craft beer. 4.0  M Thin to moderate, another feature that makes it very drinkable. 3.5  D/O Drinkability is the highest 5.0 Since this category was changed to ""overall"" then my number rating will reflect that. Overall this is a highly drinkable, easy going light amber. 3.5  Notes: I REALLY like the price of this beer. I noticed that all 3 of the 22 oz. bombers are $2.99 in many stores around here. I will have to try the other two in the New Belgium trio that has come to Ohio and report back here.

Lots of CO2 bubbles all over the place, but strangely, a smallish head: under 1/4"".  Smell 3.25: Very subdued bouquet. I get hints of caramel barley and a slight nose of a dry hopped low alpha hop, but that is about it.  Taste 3.25: Front is slightly sweet, with a small hint of barley. Middle is semi-dry; a hint of barley malt makes the taste more full at this level than the others. There is also a very faint alkaline taste of hops here. Finish is also dry, with more of the barley there barley and brief taste of hops. Aftertaste is short with a brief hint of cereal grains.  Mouthfeel 3.0: Watery in the mouth, with very little to make it distinctive.  Overall 3.25: A beer that is just a little better than OK. Not to say that this beer is horrible by any means, it is just an OK beer. Unremarkable, somewhat dry, I am certain it would be great with food.

Smell - Not getting big aromas off of this, but definitely a biscuity, yeasty, bready sweet maltiness. Also a touch of floral/leafy hops.  Taste - Follows the nose in a bigger way, but includes a touch more hoppiness. Follow through continues with biscuit, toasty malt sweetness and just enough hop bite to balance nicely. Not much if any bitterness lingers. I'm noticing and enjoying the flavor more as the beer warms slightly.  Mouthfeel - Lively carbonation, light/medium body finishes nice and dry, makes me want to take another sip. Smooth.  Overall - This is just a quality beer that's chief strength is it's great balance and drinkability. There is nothing mind-blowing, complex, or strong about it, but that's not what this beer is about.

I swear this beer tasted different when I first had it before InBev bought part of New Belgium, more biscuity and malty. This time it's very tart and sweet, with a watery, caramel mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Almost no head but nice lacing. A good go-to amber ale if you can't get any good local brown ale in your area or can't stomach anything but inoffensive flavors. I would call it the white-boy mild salsa of amber ales. Not too malty, not too hoppy, a little watery, but really quite good.

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an octagonal pint glass  A = Nice amber color, clear as crystal, with about a 1 cm head after an easy pour. An attractive amber ale, but nothing exciting.  S = sweet and malty, with a chocolate characteristic. Very pleasant and inviting.  T = Sweet malts are at the helm of this amber ale. Previous example I had was almost devoid of any hop bitterness... perhaps it was an 'off' bottle or I was drinking it too cold. Hop bitterness is fairly balanced, but play second role to the malt. There is a chocolatey, almost ""Tootsie-Roll"" like flavor. Bready and sweet.  M = Medium bodied, well rounded but not filling or too heavy.  O = I shouldn't have rated this so poorly on my first review. Whether I had a bad bottle or was drinking it too cold, I missed out. This is a solid amber ale, something that most everyone can enjoy. Even my BMC loving cousin likes this beer.

There is also the hint of hops, I assume in hopes of balancing the taste. It doesn't do it for me though. It looks good. All dressed up- but I can't quite belly up to the flavor.

Taste: Very malty up front, followed by some spice of black pepper, slight hints of clove and coriander, and finished by a good balance of hops. Caramel and honey provide a good sweetness to round out the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium with some good carbonation to tickle the taste buds.

Im slow on the pour with my ales cause they give me pleasure when they fill the glass so i didnt get much of a head. Actually I was so entranced with the smell I wasnt paying much attention to pouring a head. There is bitterness in this brew, but more to the after taste then the taste.

Always a pleasure to drink.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,DMEsquire,3.32,"People have been hating on this beer lately, but I suppose that happens with all craft brews that are marketed well and are, therefore, very successful. Anyway, I live in Mississippi, where New Belgium is unfortunately not sold yet. So, I had to pick it up in Memphis.  I got it in the can, as I am a firm believer that most beers (especially this one) taste better from a can. I don't know if it's the can conditioning, or the lack of sunlight reaching the beer, or the simple fact that it tastes colder, but I love it.  So, the beer itself is, in my opinion, the standard example of an amber ale. It's not as complex as a porter or an IPA, but it's not supposed to be. It's just a good, crisp, drinkable ale, suitable for tailgating at a football game, doing yard work, or just sitting at the house watching T.V. This beer would be my go to and I would keep it stocked if only it were available in my home state (hint hint New Belgium..)",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S- Light English hops, light American hops of citrus and floral, with a tad of earthy spice. Medium malt sweetness.  T- Similar to aroma, light citrus, spicy, floral hops. Medium sweetness. Maybe a touch of banana.  M- Pretty full for a 5.2% beer, it does finish a tad thin.  O- This beer tastes very similar to Bell's Amber to me but with everything a few notches lighter (aroma, taste). It seems like New Belgium filters all their beers which I think kinda gives them all a kinda similar flat note taste.

Refreshing, very easy to drink but not all that complex.  M: Moderate body, refreshing carbonation. Easy to drink.  O: A solid beer but I'm not sure it stands out in the crowd.

I've had the 1554 from the brewery before and liked it so I decided to try the very popular Fat Tire. I found it weird that a beer from Colorado was sold in North Carolina and not up in Pennsylvania. I had this beer yesterday 9/7/13.  A - I poured the bottle into a regular pint glass. There was a hint of amber red. As for most beers, this was not very opaque.  S - Not usually one for the smell of the beer but this beer smelt like fresh flowers on a warm spring day.  T - It tasted really good, but I noticed a weird aftertaste as the beer got warmer. Not sure what that was about.  M - Pretty standard in the mouth category. I’m not going to get fat tire flavored Listerine either, although beer flavored Listerine would be crazy cool.  Overall I am amused by it, but I'm not going to rush out of state to get it.

192,607,Isoruku,2.81,"God knows why Fat Tire is considered a worthy craft beer. New Belgium have cleverly marketed it as an icon of the micro-brewery phenomenon, but it has to be the one of the least memorable, blandest and unremarkable beers I ever experienced. I suspect that its unthreatening character is precisely why it is often the default ""craft beer"" in many taverns - the typical person ordering it is the State Farm agent who has an office in the strip mall and his date Tiffany, who drinks it from the bottle.  But give New Belgium credit - they've got a winning product here! One dimensional, boring, and not-too anything (e.g. not-too hoppy, not-too-bitter, not-too-malty).

It's definitely a solid, all-around lager, but nothing really insanely different or artistic about it; a real, ""meat-and-potatoes"" kind of brew.  It's appearance is a dark amber with a moderate head that stays around for awhile. The smell is very malty (biscuit is a strong note) with a slight floral aroma (much less hoppy than say a Sam Adams). It's a pretty thick beer with solid mouth-feel and it goes down quite well.  Like I said, overall, not too bad. I used to disdain this beer, but it's grown on me, especially since I'm finding it more and more in places that don't serve a lot of craft beer (great alternative to your Miller Lite crap), but then again, Sam was the same way with me.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,eternalcow,2.7,"To me this is a thoroughly average beer. I can't find much fault with it, but I also can't find much to recommend it.  Due to the brown hue of the bottle, color is difficult to determine, and I don't have any beer glasses. I know, some beer drinker I am.  Aroma to me is tangy, maybe a little citrus.  The flavor bears the same citrus notes, and is light on hops. It leaves a slightly woody aftertaste which to me is actually better than the beer itself.  The mouth feel is light, which I know is standard fare for this kind of ale. Unlike other pale and amber ales I've tried though, Fat Tire doesn't have anything in its flavor to balance out the light texture, so the beer tastes almost watery.  Let me hasten to add that I tend to favor dark beers, and these criticisms might just be a matter of preference.

Nothing extreme here, but that's the point.  Solid body.  Overall a fine beer Nothing the slightest wrong with it. I can see how this is the gateway craft beer do so many people.

Balance is really the name of the game all the way around, there's nice sweetness in the middle of this brew, but with a nice, mildly bitter aftertaste that stops it from being cloying.

Aroma: Nice malted barley and light earthy hops.  Taste: I haven't had Fat Tire since getting into serious craft beer. I'm surprised by how light it is. Underneath the slightly watery exterior there is some semi-sweet amber malt flavor. A nutty/toasty character that is pleasing to the palate. There is a fair amount of bitterness on the back end (20 IBU?) but no real hop flavor. A decent amount of flavor packed into 5.2% ABV.  Mouthfeel: Between light and medium in body with a lot of carbonation. Good drinkability and sessionable.  FInal Thoughts: Definitely got better further into the drinking experience.

Poured into a nonic. Lovely clear amber in colour, with a good sturdy head of foam, which recedes into a thick layer. Lots of lacing; a fine looking brew.  Nose is quite grainy, smells a great deal like brown bread. Biscuit/cracker, caramel, mild hop bitterness.  Beer tastes fine, good sturdy amber ale with nice bread and cracker graininess. Not so much of the hops as advertised on the bottle though, and although I don't need a hop blast with every beer I drink, if they say it's there it should be there. Still, a tasty brew that would be a good sessionable ale. Thin bodied, mild carbonation, slightly creamy.

Taste: Follows the nose incredibly well. Flavors of crusty bread hit the tongue right away, but fill out to a body of caramel and toffee flavors just ever so lightly accented with a perfect earthy hoppiness. Incredible.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, thick mouthfeel with little carbonation and an incredibly smooth finish.  Overall: I love this beer.

192,607,Jadjunk,3.57,"""Fat Tire Amber Ale's appeal is in its feat of balance; toasty, biscuit-like malt flavors coasting in equilibrium with hoppy freshness. Named in honor of a storied bike ride through Europe, Fat Tire cruises with Belgian imagination and inspiration. Take it for a ride! Brewed in the style of an Amber Ale. Date on bottle is May 19 2013. Available in 6 packs, 12 packs and Folly pack selections. Fat Tire has become New Belgium's staple beer and developed a devoted mainstream Craft drinker's following.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a Fat Tire pint glass. Served north of 54º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a light frothy head of an off-white tone over an orange-amber body with high clarity and standard carbonation. Retention is average and lacing is light and spotty. Not a bad appearance overall, just a little shallow on head quality. 3.5  (Smell) Lightly sweet toasted biscuit caramel malts, with a touch of husky bitterness with a mild floral hop and a pinch of citrus character. Balance is slightly sweet over bitter. Potency is mild/medium. Very clean aroma overall with an accessible lightness in the aroma. Not really blown away by it but it's appealing. 3.25  (Taste) Light biscuity cereal malts, a touch of toasted caramel grain on the finish. The malt bill is complimented by a floral, earthy hop character for a moderate dry finish without a dominant hop flavor. Sweetness is a touch more reserved and light, so the balance is a bit better, but the combined flavor is light throughout for a high drinkability and has a touch of toasty malt body for some depth and character. 3.5  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, light with a subtle buzzy carbonation, a very mild grain sweetness and a dry finish accented by a mild alpha hop blend. Body is light/medium for the style and light/medium overall. Alcohol presence is light. Texture and carbonation is very good for the style. 4.25  (Overall) A drinkable, session Amber Ale. It's probably the most mainstream example you can find, and it's not too bad. Despite a light body, there's a pleasant toasty caramel malt character and a matching floral hop note for a nice balance. It's a good Amber ale choice for those who enjoy a mild, drinkable ale with a good balance and character.

M: The only thing I would suggest is a slightly higher amount of carbonation, but that's just me.  O: I've not been one for food and drink pairing in the past, but I would suggest trying this with angel food cake; it works quite well; make sure it's with strawberries. This is an easy go-to beer because A) it's tasty B) easy to find in grocery stores and C) it works for me any time of the year. I definitely recommend this to beer geeks like myself and those transitioning from""beer"" and what beer can actually be: tasty.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,emyers,3.27,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a very slightly hazy amber-gold with a half-inch white head.  Smell: Toasted biscuits and a little bit of caramel malt. Smell is predominately bready. Pretty simple, but that is to be expected.  Taste: Similar to the smell. Very biscuity/bready, with a touch of caramel. Maybe some raisins if I dig really deep, but once again there isn't a whole lot of complexity here.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, medium carbonation. Very drinkable, but could benefit from a little more body.  Overall: For what it is, it's a solid beer. Just don't expect anything spectacular. I consider this to be something of a ""gateway beer"" to craft beer, and it doesn't hurt that you can find it in most bars that don't carry much other than BMC.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,TheBrewo,3.62,"This beer was served from a bottle at the Sundeck on Aspen Mountain in Aspen, CO. It arrived in a pint glass, glowing a golden pumpkin orange. It held a two finger head of copper-brushed foam, resembling the body of bubble bath. This showed nice retention, leaving a quarter of an inch of thick foamy lacing. Carbonation appeared light, but solidly present, with no haze or sediment noted. The aroma gave toasted pale and amber malts, light metallic adjuncts, sweeter raw barley, and big grassy hops that were more crispy drying than juicy With warmth came peanut nuttiness, vegetal sprouts, toasted graham cracks, and overripe bananas. Our first impression was that the flavoring was very toasty and biscuity, as advertised, but the adjuncts definitely shone through. As we sipped, the flavor opened with bittered pale malts and ambers, as did the nose, with metallic bite off the bat. Mixing in were white flour adjuncts, and milder grassy and herbal hops. The middle peaked with a deepening of earthiness, with dried tree bark, green stick hoppiness, and a continuation of those pale malts. The finish came with light vanilla and milky creaminess, effectively breaking up that standard, even graininess. The aftertaste breathed of toasted pale malts, buttery sweetness, mineral, baker’s yeast, light adjuncts, coppery metallics, and big mustiness. The body was lighter, and the carbonation was medium to high. The mouth was coated with wet, watery foaminess, with eventual light dryness once it finally dissipated. Each sip gave nice slurp, smack, cream, and froth. The abv was fine, and the beer drank decently.  Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the bitterness through the flavoring, due to both the grain and the hops. Neither really acted to steal the show, but both helped to box out those comparatively unpleasant adjuncts. The nose, comparatively, was weak, but did improve with warmth. This beer is a classic for the style, but its basic nature leaves you searching for a bit more.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The beer smells like toffee and bread crust. It also smells a little nutty. The taste follows the nose. It's a mild flavored beer with slight toffee and nice bread crust flavor. There's a touch of nuttiness as well. The body is light with moderate carbonation. There's a light aftertaste and this beer is highly drinkable. This is a very good beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

A bit of spotty spider web lacing. Remaining head eventually dissipates completely, but renews fully with each new pour.  S: Malt, almond, pecan, molasses and raisin. All very-well balanced.  T: Woody malt. Cardboard-y character. A little pungent peat and bitter pecan shells.  M: Sappy feel, pungent throughout.  D: Not much resistance. This is a full flavor, well-balanced, session style brew.  Atmosphere is pretty good. Shallow hue, solid foamy head, and only slight lacing. Nose is a great combination of malt, nut, and sweet components. Very well done. Flavor has a papery wood and nut character. Pungent aftertaste.

192,607,MShirokov,3.78,"The others have described the taste well. This beer won't give you any kind of ""religious experience"" but on a hot summer day it's perfect to quench your thirst. I had it a few days ago at a golf course with a light snack (honestly it was either Fat Tire or Miller Light, so that was an obvious choice) and found it to be refreshing and a good companion to food. Yes, it lacks flavor a bit, but sometimes you want that.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MikeAAL,3.25,"This is a very average beer. Definately not the best example of the style.  Red/ amber body with a white head.  Smells a little hoppy, bready and malty. But not much smell.  Watery taste, a little hops and malty at the end.  Light, watery mouthfeel. Heavy carbonation. A dry finish.  Not a lot of flavor with this beer. Wouldn't buy it again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Immortale25,3.47,"Can supplied by SatlyMalty. Poured into a snifter. Bottom of can says 06 JAN 13.  A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch cream colored head that retains very well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a sheer coat of surface foam. Slick lacing leaves a solid ring behind on the glass.  S- Sweet aroma with faint hops and biscuity pie crust-like malt. Tinge of alcohol.  T- Pretty standard amber ale profile. Bready, light alcohol, kiss of hops, easy to drink. Struggling to find more character but it's just oh so basic.  M- Pretty thin, almost watery. Medium carbonation with a body that's lacking substance.  O- Can't really see why this was or is regarded so highly (by average beer drinkers) but I guess that's the point: it's easily accessible from a taste standpoint. Can't say that I necessarily had high hopes for it since craft beer drinkers in the know warned me it's not all that, but it's kind of a letdown all the same.

192,607,sam_bliss,3.17,"My rushed pour yields an enormous frothing off-white foam-head. As it settles a bit, lacing is already evident. The color is classic red-copper of an American amber. Smells fruity at first, roasted malts and hay come through at second whiff. The taste is more subdued than the smell, a bit of black malt is thrown into the mix of bready and caramel. Some mellow grassy and spicy hops mingle with the mild red fruitiness. The mouthfeel is medium or even light, but leaves a coating on the roof of the mouth nonetheless. Carbonation is understated like the flavor.  I am a bit biased against Fat Tire, because I have always thought it was overrated. Obviously not the best of New Belgium's offerings, but I did my best to review it impartially. Not my favorite amber, which isn't my favorite style.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Hopinista,3.62,"A: Light amber, slight orange hue.  S: Bread, bread, and bread. This has a very malt-forward smell. Just the slightest hint of anything remotely hoppy.  T: Roasted malts are the dominating taste here. It does have a biscuit-like taste to it (just like the label says.) There is almost no hop presence here.  M: This is where the beer really shines, it's surprisingly light and carbonating for being so malt heavy.  O: Not my favorite beer ever, I like a lot more hops than this beer offers. To me one of the most redeeming qualities is that out of the beers widely available at restaurants, bars, and gas station etc, this is one of the better options, especially since I don't drink (anything) from macros. The other thing I think Fat Tire has going in it's favor is that it's extremely sessionable. It's ironic that I absolutely love Ranger and 1554, but the original is somewhat lacking.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,orcsinspace,3.25,"This was ""the"" beer to be seen with in my neck of the woods last year, although I often wondered if anyone was drinking it. On paper, this is a great beer. In presentation, this is an excellent beer. In truth though, the taste I find sub-par.  The color is amazing, the head pours nice (I poured from a bottle), and there is some really light lacing down the side. However, I find this beer much too earthy tasting for me, and while it is decent, it is defiantly not one that I will try again anytime soon. To me this beer tastes like someone went half and half with a Michelob and a Yuengling Traditional, and I am not really crazy about either. I will admit that the taste does mellow out if you drink several of these, but I find that with most beer too.  Fat Tire is basically like having a friend that is a body builder, and when you get him to help you move you find out that it is all superficial and he sucks at using his muscles in a realistic way--it is a let down. I feel like if they spent more time on the beer rather than the label art and the advertising, this would have been better. I expected more out of New Belgium, because I generally like their beers, but the Fat Tire offering that I had reminded me that not every microbrewery can be Sierra Nevada.

I sampled it a few months back after I took a long hiatus from tasting it that first time.  I would say it is above average in all aspects except appearance. A good basic go-to, but nothing exceptional. Value is decent as well when compared to similar styles.

Inoffensive, but nice enough to look at. Nose was lacking. Malt, I suppose? This is a beer, correct? Taking my first sip, the carbonation gives way to runny ale seething abt my teeth. I felt provoked to swallow. Taste is OK. Inoffensive. Medium-grade malt flavor with light hop under/overs.

192,607,Cyrion,3.91,"Poured into a nonick pint, I was surprised at how unlike an amber ale it seems. A clear, medium gold appearance instead of the red I was expecting? And what's this, no carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom at all! Still, it presented a nice frothy head with complex lacing, which I found delightful.  Aroma was sweet and biscuit-like. I detected a slight orange hop tang, but nothing more than a hint.  Taste was a rich, sweet malt. It brought to mind oatmeal cookies. That bakery taste was unmistakeable. A slight cocoa flavor was also present- I shall be interested in learning the malts used. A slight hop flavor was noticed at the edges of the tongue, but remained hidden for the duration of the quaff.  Mouthfeel was of medium body and only slightly chewy. Went well with the bakery flavors presented by the malt.  Overall, a delicious first foray for me into the New Belgium lineup. The flavors were uncomplicated, which may disappoint those looking for far more character than I was seeking. I'm still not sure I'd call this an amber/red ale, but I found it delightful.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jjamadorphd,4.34,"Last night while still in California I was able to enjoy yet another great tasting beer - this one with the catchy name of Fat Tire.  The beer has a nice dark golden color that has light and dark highlights that accent quite nicely when candle light catches it just the right way. The head was lightly brown, frothy and had a bit of staying power - there was plenty of lacing the entire way down the bottle. What surprised me was the distinct caramel smell that I found appealing and added just a little to the taste. Mouthfeel wasn't anything spectacular, carbonation was a bit more than I like. Overall it was a great beer, I'm jealous with Californians, they have a very good selection of brews at their local restaurants.  Update - 13 June 2016 After much consternation and deliberation, I've decided to update my rating and review of this beer - the first ever for me. For the longest time I believed a review should stand, no matter how long ago it was performed. However, as time moves forward I come to the realization that my palate has ""matured"" and I'm finding some of the previous beers I've had needing updating - in some cases down and in some cases up. I think for this offering from Fat Tire, their flagship brew, I am notching it up.  So what changed since the last time I reviewed this? The odor isn't as good as I once thought, but the feel, taste, and overall experience is truly top notch, in my book. I do believe I get it now why this brew was considered groundbreaking back in the day. This is truly a beer that has stood the test of time and deserves being revisited quite often.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Philousa,3.42,"Pours a clear orange amber with a small amount of white head. Aroma is mainly biscuit with some caramel and a tartness from the yeast. Flavor is sweet with biscuit and slight honey, some chocolate malt, and the tartness from the yeast prevails towards the end of the flavor profile. I'm guessing noble hops are used, as the finish of flavor is nectar and flowery that goes well with the sweet Belgian malt. Well balanced with a middling mouthfeel and a balanced finish.

Always have enjoyed it!  Beer poured a reddish copper color with a smallish head that is leaving a bit of lacing behind.  Nose is a nice biscuity grainy blast.  Taste is biscuity and slightly sweet with light hopping to keep the sweetness at bay and make the finish a bit dry.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth.  Overall this has been a decent go to beer over the years when out at restaurants and bars in which craft is not king.

192,607,PsilohsaiBiN,3.29,"2012 can:  Appearance: Pours amber with a 1 fingerish off-white head that leaves for the most part after a few minutes.  Smell: Kinda smells like a moldy basement with some brown sugar sweetness. There's also some faint hops and malt in there. Trying to be nice about this, but up front there's some kind of off putting odor reminiscent of mold, weird. I'm also getting some salt? Sorry, but this is one of the most bizarre, off-putting smell-wise beers I've ever had(and I've had Ta Henkett...).  Taste: Beginning hop bitterness fades into a semi-sweet, malty ending. Nothing too fancy, but not bad. One thing I really like about this beer is how the aftertaste rolls off of your tongue. That said, you could call it a crisp finish that ends clean, with the palate reset and ready for more(or, perhaps another brew). A palate wrecker, it is not.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with not much carbonation. It's definitely (dare I use the AB term)drinkable.  Overall: I know this beer has a cult following and it's by no means bad. It's just that for me, personally, it kind of has the taste/feel of a lager, not an ale. It's sessionable as hell and I'm sure it's pretty good on tap, but as a beer with dinner type of beer, this just wouldn't be my first choice. It's above average with a good/or lack of? aftertaste.

192,607,babayaga,3.25,"Bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance- A really nice clear amber-to-copper color, with a 2-finger creamy off-white head. Great lacing on the glass.  Aroma- Grains, slightly sweet malts, a little toast. I don't get much hops at all, but I poured it at 40F. Grape nuts.  Flavor- More grains, some ""mineraliness."" Biscuit.  Mouthfeel- Medium body, medium carbonation.  As unique as I think that this beer is, I think that New Belgium has some much better offerings.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,gnftr44,4.13,Slightly cloudy appearance with a uniquely sweet aroma. Smooth taste with a fruity finish.  Very easy to drink and has no negative aspects. Particularly enjoyed drinking the Fat Tire slowly and with a non-spicy meal such as fries.  Overall a solid daytime draft beer.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,raynmoon,3.58,"It smells like light malts, and some noble hops it seems. Sort of lemon-lime in character. I also get a very nostalgic raw/ being brewed smell of grains and hops. Something you only really smell when you are making beer. Also some nice caramelized malts. Not strong, but above average for its complexity.  A sweet malt flavor, very faint hop flavor coming through with a mild but satisfying hop bitterness. a slight cocoa taste at the very end. Reminds me of some of the nice Euro Lagers.  Definitely not something I am clambering for, but I can sure see why people like it so much. Solid.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SerialTicker,3.5,"For MONTHS I've been seeing Fat Tire advertisements around Michigan, and I just finally had one on draft. At $3 for a 20oz, I figured, why not?  Appearance: I feel like it's not even fair to judge a beer on tap because I've just found that any beer will look better when it comes on draft... this beer looked awesome. Had a small, creamy head that went away pretty quickly, but the lacing was great.  Smell: Has a dry, malt aroma. My friends like to say the smell is reminiscent of a ""wet trunk"". I can't disagree with that, but it's not an off-putting smell to me.  Taste/feel: Much like the smell. I've had a few ambers, and I find this tastes a little bit different. Most ambers I've had have had that ""trunk"" smell and taste, but Fat Tire's not quite the same. Not a fantastic beer by any means, but it's drinkable and cheap. The feel on this one is probably as good as I think it is because of it being on-tap... smooth and easy drinking.  Fat Tire's a solid beer all around. When left with this or the option of several BMCs, this one clearly wins.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,HarryPotHead,3.57,"Started seeing this beer more frequently in Maryland over the last year so I figured I would ""take it for a spin"". ...groan.  S - Poured from 22 oz bomber with a 1/13/13 ""best by"" date into my favorite frosted mug.  A - A better than expected and frothy head sits on top of a rich amber body. The head eventually yielded, but hung around for at least half of the first pour. Average amount of lacing left behind.  S - The smell is the best thing about this brew! Not overpowering but very pleasant indeed. Subtle hints of cherry with a malted headiness. Very well balanced and unique.  T - Was expecting more based on the beautiful aroma, but was slightly dissapointed here. A little heavy on the malt for my tastes, but not bad. Aftertaste lingers awhile but is not bad either. Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular... a solid 3 in my book.  M - Lightly textured, cool, and crisp without a lot of bite. Nice.  O - I might have enjoyed this beer a lttle more a few monts back. It's winter here in Maryland and I think this beer would be a good summer ale. I'll stick with my porters and stouts and come back to this in April or May! This is a good solid American ale with a lot going for it... Just nothing remarkable. The label says they are ""wind powered and employee owned""...I wish I could add extra points for those two facts alone!!

S - Bread/biscuit comes through first, with possibly honey and some hops. Malts dominate, though.  T - Bread/biscuit again, malts, honey or caramel, can't tell which.  M - Well-balanced, not just a heavy blanket of malt or just a tongue-stab of hops. Bright finish.  O - Solid, well-balanced ale. Would have it again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jjboesen,3.78,"This amber ale is New Belgium's flagship beer and honors bike riding - apparently. The ride begins with a massive marshmellow frothiness that includes shimmery bubbles and lather. The body is a translucent amber color wherein little carbonation or lacing. The head will eventually dissapear alltogether.  What little nose there is reminds one of honey and green apples while the palate detects grass and plum with a final and fleeting hit of hop. There is a little biscuit wrapped in the body along with some wispy strands of maltiness. Nice balance at the end of the ride.  There was much hoop-la surrounding the arrival of Fat Tire in the East, which now makes me scratch my head. Still this is a pleasant, if a somewhat underwhelming beer. That said, I am still glad to have it available here in Maryland - where I live.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,WoodBrew,3.58,"Pours an solid amber with a good amount of white head with good retention that drifts to a decent lace. The nose is refreshing, and nice not to get hit with a bag of citrus fruit. The biscuit/bready malt is surprisingly forward. Hops are floral and fruity (and yeast). Taste follows with lots of biscuit/bready sweet Belgium style malt and a bit of caramel. Hops are subdued, but floral and noble in nature. Also fruity yeast character. Mouthfeel is smooth and has good balance. Overall a fine beer, but I prefer SA Lager or Honkers Ale to this.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Smooth, toasted malt flavors up-front; light caramel and subtlety burnt sugar; light fruitiness in the aftertaste. Smooth, rich, medium-bodied.

192,607,Jugs_McGhee,3.17,"Served on-draught into a pilsner glass. Expectations are average; I'd had it from the bottle before. Reviewed from notes.  A: Pours a beige floater. Body colour is a semitransparent amber. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Amber malts, caramel, hints of butterscotch? Some biscuit malt. A mild strength aroma.  T: Amber malts, caramel, and biscuit malt. Clean but simple. Pleasant and balanced. Little yeast comes through.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Suits the flavour decently. A touch too heavy on the palate for the lack of diverse or bold flavour. Good thickness. Overcarbonated.  Dr: Drinkable but unremarkable. A good beer for drinking at a bar on the cheap, but it's lackluster. Overpriced at $6.00. New Belgium makes far better beers.  Low C+  *** Sixer of 12 fl oz bottles ran me $7.99 USD (plus tax) at a Rouses Supermarket in Metairie, Louisiana.  Toasted malt, obvious caramelization/caramelized sugars, faint herbal hop flavour. It's well balanced and enjoyable especially when cold, but I do think it's a better beer on-draught. Flirts with cherry-like fruit flavour in the finish, which I find quite pleasant and luscious. I dig the push-pull between the almost bready toasted malt dryness and the subtle burst of fruity cherry sweetness, which to me is the heart of this ale.  A very accessible flagship beer for such a large brewery, and increasingly I think I'm finding I prefer it to Boston Beer Co.'s Sam Adams Boston Lager, Stone Pale Ale, and similar flagship beers from some of the macromicros. There's no denying it's a drinkable crowdpleaser of an amber ale, and for my money it's one of the best widely distributed amber ales in the U.S.A. (Don't look at me, Alaskan Amber, you're kind of sort of an altbier - but you *are* a better brew).  $1.33/bottle? Yeah, I'll keep buying this over the years.

192,607,tectactoe,3.71,"Pours a copper color, fairly translucent, with a slightly off-white head, thick and fluffy looking, decent retention and a little bit of lacing. The smell is malts, malts, and malts all day. A tiny bit of a floral aroma can be picked up if you really force yourself to find it, but the malts are what smacks you in the face. The taste is quite nice - clearly lots of roasted malts, most heavily in the form of burnt caramel, toffee, and light, milk chocolate. This sweetness is counterbalanced by a subtle, yet apparent hop sting that jumps out about two-thirds of the way through. Slightly piney, the slight touch of bitterness at the tail end leaves your mouth in perfect harmony from the jumbo sweetness of the up-front malts. Medium body, medium to high carbonation, decent mouthfeel.  Very tasty amber ale, I'm glad New Belgium finally brought this product to Michigan.

It had a beautiful copper color and a three-finger head that made its way onto my upper lip, since I could barely wait to drink it. It was absolutely delicious.  This beer for me strikes a nice balance between the everyday lagers and the heavier ales and craft beers that I enjoy. I love the spices and the drinkability. It is a wonderful Autumn/Winter brew for my Kegerator; it is a substantial enough seasonal offering without being too heavy or over the top.  Many dismiss it as pedestrian, mainstream, or just the gateway to craft beers, but I respectfully disagree. I have a two-tower Kegerator, and it has firmly established a position on one side for the Fall season.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The taste is a delicious toasted malt and spice blend. Though it’s list as an amber ale, it has more spice taste then some companies Oktoberfest offering. It finishes with a slight chalky after taste. I’ve had this in my cooler for about 6 months and I think it drinks a little nicer now that it did when it’s fresh off the truck.

My previous 3 ranking seemed harsh, so I got it again. Don't think my score will change much. This Amber has always a bit of a flat taste - decent malty taste with no sense of any hops.

The head fades over a moderate amount of time to leave a decent level of lacing on the glass.  Smell – The aroma is of caramel and some light roasted malt aromas. Mixed with these are subtle hop aromas of citrus and a light herbal smell.  Taste – The taste begins with some of the bready and caramel flavors. These are quickly meet by a lighter fruit flavors of a sweeter citrus hop as well as some very light roasted notes. As the taste advances to the end a light herbal flavor come to the tongue and leave a sweet, light hop, and light roast flavor to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer was on the average side with a carbonation level that is slightly lighter than the average. Perhaps a bit more carbonation would have made it a bit more crisp and good for the fruit and herbal hops, but yet the not as good for the roasted flavors. It’s hard to say which would be better.

192,607,deebo,4.67,"A bottle with a BB date 18 Nov 12.  A-Poured into a pint glass, this beer gives a solid 2 fingers of a rather creamy slightly off white head that laces the glass quite nicely. Perfectly clear with an orangish amber color with a few CO2 bubbles making their way to the surface.  S-I really like the aroma of Fat Tire. My reference smell of biscuity sweet malt-this definitely is the dominant aroma. Minor notes of green apple.  T-Toasted malts with a fair amount of sweetness with just a touch of hop bitterness to cut it and help quicken the finish. I love the balance of malt and hops in this beer. Hints of fruity (apple) yeast also present to help give some extra complexity.  M-Plenty of carbonation to carry the malt and cut the hop end note. Medium bodied for the style.  O-A terrific beer. This was one of those gateway beers many years ago that made me marvel at what a beer could be beyond the standard pils most of us grew up with. Many years later it's still a beer I very much enjoy and like to have on hand as a great all-season beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Oakenator,3.83,Pours brown with a slight amber hue. Nice head at pour but disappates and has left little lacing on this clean glass. Smell is of a bready malt with a hint of sweetness maybe a touch of caramel. Flavor is a quality amber brown ale with a hint of a sweeter nut maybe pecan; light hopping is present.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MattSweatshirt,3.2,"Pours transparent golden orange body with a bubbly white head.  A nutty, toasted bready malt smell fills your nostrils.  Although it is quite malty there is a hint of hop character. More of the same from the aroma with the nut(kind of pecan like) and toasted bready malt.  Light-medium bodied that is crisp and slightly refreshing.  A sessionable beer but one I’m not going to put back more than 12 oz of.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MeowTom,3.5,A- Pours a super clear golden amber color with a nice head that is about an inch big and stays around for a bit and then turns into a lacy film over the top.  S- Nice mellow hoppy aroma of grassy and citrus notes.  T- A very balanced beer with maybe a slight edge towards the malty side.  M- Light and crispy with a little body to it. Carbination makes it a great lawn mowing summer beer.  O- Great average beer that is well made and could easily be a session beer around a camp fire or a day of yard work.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RonaldTheriot,3.53,"New Belgium Fat Tire Amber Ale has a thick, fluffy, off-white head, and a clear, somewhat bubbly, amber appearance, with a pretty good amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma is sweet and of pecan shells. Taste is of medium-roasted barley malt, pecan shell, and just a touch of hop bitterness (I would never have guessed that this beer has an 18.5 IBU rating). The mouthfeel is light and watery, and Fat Tire Amber Ale finishes crisp, refreshing, highly drinkable, and dull. Overall, this beer just lacks enough boldness. I rate it good, but just so.

192,607,TheCondor,3.97,"Side poured from a bottle into a pint glass with standard vigor.  Appearance - I have always loved the packaging on these beers, pretty much everything by New Belgium has a nice label on it. This beer pours a nice amber/copper color with a one finger head that sticks around for a minute, leaving little lacing.  Smell - Wood, nutty, toasts, breads, and malts intertwine to produce one of the better smelling ambers I've came across. There is just a lot going on in the nose, and I like it.  Taste - Follows the nose closely, with the bready toasted malts always playing a powerful role, but the beer is not without any other character. Very earthy, woods, excellent taste.  Mouthfeel - Finishes with a slight spice, kind of watery, with pretty high carbonation. Smooth, but watery.  Overall - This is one of the few amber ales that I can actually stand, and that's saying something. There have been so many ambers that I have tried and hated that Fat Tire is always a pleasant surprise, especially given its cost and availability. Sessionable, a good beer for any time of the year, I like this stuff.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Translusent enough to see the perfect amount of carbonation bubbles floating to the top to help keep the consistancy of the head. And B E A U T I F U L lacings! After it sits the fuzzes makes a ring that DOES NOT go away. After each gulp there are rings indicating where the beer was at in the glass and they stay there untill the end of the beer.  S - earthy notes and undertones. very foresty. very roasted.  T - First reaction is that the beer taste like a bonfire. The aromas that emmit from camp fires or char coals was the taste of this beer. very unique and yummy. A must try, to understand first hand the experience of this burnt fire woody beer. almost like bourbon.  M - perfect mouthfeel to make this an almost dangerous beer. medium bodied, with a very clean finish. Did not sit this beer down very long at all.  Overall this is a great beer. One just to be drinking, one for festivities, one for parying, one for good ole times.

192,607,BeerFMAndy,3.28,"16 oz can poured into a New Belgium globe. 22 JUL 12 on bottom of can.  A - Steady carbonation streams from the glass' nucleation point, through the clear, gorgeous amber beer, to the frothy off-white head. Retention is rather poor, but plenty of lace remains caked to the glass.  S - Deeply earthy, Fat Tire has always reminded me of a musty fall day after a rainfall in a lot of ways; crisp, cool air, damp leaf piles, and wet rock. Toasted malt notes emerge behind the extremely earthy hop aroma for a good level of balance.  T - The earthy aspects the nose offers follow through to the flavor incredibly. Mulch pile and damp leaf with a wet rock-like finish that doesn't so much remind of hops or malt, just a unique earthy flavor - one that I'm really not a fan of.  M - Medium-light bodied, Fat Tire, with it's moderately higher carbonation level, is crisp on the tongue, biting at the throat in conjunction with dryness on the finish leaving a rather refreshing lingering bitterness post-swallow.  O - New Belgium's Fat Tire has made quite a name for itself, building the brand by leaps and bounds. It's popularity has allowed New Belgium to do unique and different things with beer, and for that I'm grateful but, I'll be honest; I really don't care for this beer. I strive to be as objective and style-focused as possible when reviewing beer; in the end, I just don't think Fat Tire is very good. The combination of malt and hops in this beer doesn't showcase either of the two ingredients, rather, it leaves a lasting impression of just plain ""earthy"". It's damn consistent though, and that takes some serious skill. If people didn't like it, New Belgium wouldn't be where they are today.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,TheRealBigC,3.31,"Fat Tire is an odd one for me, because I've found it tastes significantly better in the bottle than on tap. The last couple of times I've tried it on tap there's been a pungent, almost sour foreground to the flavor that I've found off-putting. Otherwise, it's a pretty solid beer which I can understand being a popular name in bars around the country.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The aroma has a lot of sweet malts, caramel, and butterscotch in it.  The body was about medium.  The taste also had a quantity of caramel and butterscotch in it with a mild hopped ending.

192,607,IllNate,3.75,"Pours an solid amber with a good amount of white head with good retention that drifts to webbing. The nose is refreshing, and nice not to get hit with a bag of citrus fruit. The biscuit/bready malt is surprisingly forward. Hops are floral and fruity (and yeast). Taste follows with lots of biscuit/bready malt and a bit of caramel. Hops are subdued, but floral and noble in nature. Also fruity yeast character. Mouthfeel is smooth and has good balance.

192,607,SpeedwayJim,3.04,"Surprised that I've never actually tried this one. Brought back by a friend. Best by date of August 13th. Poured into a Sam Adams sensory glass.  Big, frothy 2 finger white head with good retention. Beer is clear bronze. Lacing is spotty with average stick. Good.  Nose is uninspiring. Decently aromatic. Nutty with hints of brown sugar, chestnut, and tree bark. Not really what I'm looking for from the style. Missing that nice, hop presence.  Opens nutty. Brown sugar, chestnut, and a weird, yeastiness. Big malt presence throughout. An odd metallic taste peaks out at the end. Sweet, sugary aftertaste. Strange, but not bad.  Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. Goes down watery with an accent. Finishes sharp with a mellow, lingering aftertaste. Refreshing.  I can't say I'm surprised by New Belgium's flagship brew. Its nothing special but the flavor is decent, not offensive, and very conservative. Not much to hate here but not much to like either. I'd have this if this was one of the only craft options.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Aroma is not impressive, let's just put it that way.  Taste is actually not bad... I wish they made it a little fatter, and it'd be a proper brown ale like Bender. Even so I quite like the balance between sweetness, speciality malt character and the finishing bitterness.  Mouthfeel is rather watery, but nothing unforgivable. Overall it's an above average beer.

Decent retention but eventually fades at just a white film. Leaves webs of lacing on the glass.  S - aroma is delicate. Soft gooey caramel and toasty grainy bread are first aparent. Hints of spice mostly cinnamon and clove. As it warms it turns to festive notes of gingerbread and spice cake.  T - toasted almond and sweet cake-like flavors are first apparent. Earthy bitterness steps in quickly for balanced. Spice notes of pepper and ginger mid palate. Sweet caramel on the short finish.  M - medium body. Smooth and creamy texture. Light carb, big bubbles. 3  Overall - I was impressed as it had a bit more complexity than I was expecting.

192,607,BBThunderbolt,3.46,"Imagine my surprise when I recently realized that I hadn't reviewed Fat Tire. How did I get to almost 1,500 reviews without ticking Fat Tire? Well, let's take a look at this standard of the style.  My nemesis the 22oz bottle was the container. Poured into straight pint glass. An accidentally over-aggressive pour produced a clean, clear, medium amber brew with over 2inches of just off-white head that had very good retention and lacing.  The scents and taste were nearly identical, soft, even malts tinged with some gentle hops and a bit of biscuit on the finish. The beer was medium bodied, and a bit thinner than I prefer in the style. Drinkability was, as you probably already know, very good. Many ""Flat Tires"" have gone down my throat in the past and I suspect more will in the future.  Overall, a good, solid beer. Always worth a shot. The best thing about FT for me, is that around here, even the most redneck-logger-commercial fisherman-farmer joint will have this next to the BMC taps, so no matter where I go, I can at least get a craft brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Retention is very good and tons of lacing is left.  3.5 S: Dry graininess and toasty malts. That's about it, but it's done well and thus well appreciated.  2.5 T: Smells better than it tastes. Still grainy and toasty, but not as powerful. Just an easy drinking, uninspired beer.  3.0 M: Lighter medium body. A bit too much carbonation. Not creamy or crisp, but not bad either.  3.0 D: It is what it is.

A slight hint of alcohol and a strange finish...grape? A little chlorine odor towards the end.  T: Fresh malt hits the palate and quickly turns into a nice, toasty caramel, present throughout. Tart fruits come next, similar to smell, but with hints of yeast and tobacco. Complex, but finishes a bit skunky. I like my ambers buttery, and this does not fit the bill.\  M: Very watery, could benefit from more body and carbonation. Not at all resinous.  O: Very disappointing.

Runs the gamut from dough up through crust. It's an edible experience. Toasted grains add a nice depth. Mild roasted profile. Almost fruity...ripe cherry?  Taste: Toasted and roasted. Clean grain profile upfront. Malts run sweet and drop big caramel notes, almost hitting toffee. Mega toasted. Bread all up in this thing. Dry crust and fresh-baked goodness. Mild fruitiness wrapped in a delicious doughy exterior. Nice roasted profile keeps things from getting stale. Some pale malts as well. Gritty.  Mouthfeel: Moderate body with a solid carbonation.

I did not realize this one was going to have so many carbonation columns. There is also a solid ring of lace sticking to the glass.  Smell- This one has a very pleasant, sweet cookie-malt scent. I can also appreciate some earthiness. Most of the nose though is the sweet malt.  Taste- The palate still has the malt sweetness, but is dialed back, replaced with some more earthiness and slight hop bitterness. The malt finishes more bread-like than anything else. I would appreciate more hoppiness or a more complex malt bill.  Mouth feel- The beer has a nice tingle from the hop bill. The beer has nice carbonation but is not overdone. The feel was nicely handled.  Overall- While this sweeter amber is solidly crafted, it lacks in originality and is a pretty standard drink.

Flavor is pretty flat, however. A little bit bitter, a little bit chalky, a little bit skunky/lagery. Highly carbonated on the tongue. I don't appreciate any Belgian inspiration here.

T: Slightly sweet with the caramel, toasted, and biscuit malt backbone. Well balanced with the hops as there is little detectable bitterness.  M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation.  O: Pretty easy to drink and definitely a sessionable beer.

I am getting some malts, a bit of nuts and some caramel.  T - A light malty brew that far surpasses the average beer that is widely available. The biscuity malts dominate the flavors while being followed by some sweet crisp notes.  M - Light-Medium bodied with a bit high carbonation for my liking in a red. The brew has an elementary amount of complexity in its progression, but nothing more. Not much horrific here, but nothing really going great.

Aroma contained some light caramel and nuts along with a floral hop aroma. It wasn't very strong, though, and I thought there was a slight metallic note.  Flavor was quite nutty and biscuity with floral hops quickly following. A little sweet with a mild bitterness and sticky finish. Mouthfeel could have been a little bit fuller.

192,607,OneDropSoup,3.91,"Poured into a stemmed tulip: Nice medium amber-orange, clear, with bright gold highlights, tiny, fast nucleation bubbles, & two fingers of soft, cloud-like head that drops but stays thick & clings to the sides. Lookin' real nice, actually.  Smell at first is a biscuity toastedness, on the sweet side, & soon reveals some banana bread, a little cocoa, with a blunt sugary character like sweet potato or even bubble gum. Not bad, but kind of ""dumbs down"" after that first impression.  Taste follows pretty closely with the smell: biscuity caramel character & banana bread, but with a crisp hop bitterness that brightens it a bit & keeps it from just laying there. Evens out & ends with a combination of sweet & dry, with just a little booze character. A little more bakery sweetness shows up & becomes pretty pleasant.  Nice balanced mouthfeel, medium-bodied with a crispness as well as a slight chewiness.  Good brew overall, nicely drinkable & has a character all its own. I wouldn't complain if this were as ubiquitous in my parts as it seems to be in most of the country.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,phishsihq,3.53,"From a basement in 1991 to the flagship of the 3rd largest craft brewery a few short years later...  Growing up in Wisconsin I was always surrounded by GREAT beer. Bell's, New Glarus, Capital Brewing, Three Floyds, and the list goes on and on, but there was always rumors of this amazing beer just on the other side of the Mississippi.  Fat Tire Amber Ale pours a beautiful copper-amber color with one inch of white head that retains quite well and leaves a decent lace. Caramel and biscuit is strong on the nose, slight floral hop tones as well. Malt flavors, again biscuits, toffee, and caramel are strong out of the gate with a GREAT balance achieved by the subtle hops lurking in the background. Medium-light in body, somewhat creamy, and with a moderate level of carbonation. A cult classic!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mullincs,3.83,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a chilled pint glass.  Appearance - formed a nice head before dissipating after about 5 minutes. The color was a nice hue of amber.  Smell - Not really much to smell after pouring. Possibly a little sweetness  Taste - Very small amount of bitterness at first sip, quickly balanced out by the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly very smooth, with a medium amount of carbonation and a light feel. Very pleasant and easy to drink. If anything, it might feel a little too watery for my likes.  Overall - I was fairly impressed with this brew. Nothing spectacular, but it was a simple, easy, and drinkable ale that succeeds where others fail.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

I have moved on to more interesting brews now, but occasionally find myself in a place where this is the best to be had, and in those cases times ain't bad. (Finding yourself in a PBR or High Life dilemma, now there's a REAL situation!) This brewery sprung up a cpl miles from where I grew up, so for a long time this was my ""taste of home"". I'll be as objective as that allows.  A - Rich mahogany brown body. Weak carbonation, lace ring dissipates to almost nothing and no trace left behind down the glass.  S - Nutty, earthy smell. Roasted grains. It smells better off the tap than the bottle for sure. Very slight grassy hop presence.  T - Mellow roasted grain, no sweet maltiness however. A little dankness comes out at the end. Decent, fairly unassuming.  M - Pretty wet and watery, bit of a funky aftertaste. I went through a phase when that aftertaste was disgusting to me, not so offputting now.

Mostly malt forward in both taste and aroma, mildly sweet caramel leads the charge. Some floral and vaguely piney hops...I'm sure this one struck me as way hoppier years ago but now it seems pretty balanced, leaning more to that bready caramel malt.  Body and carbonation are both medium..some creaminess in the mouthfeel. Clean and refreshing, fairly dry and crisp.

Head stays intact all the way to the bottom of the glass. Leaves behind a few large splotches of lacing.  S - A little bit of fresh earthy hops on a biscuity malt background.  T - Toasted biscuit with a little bit of fruitiness upfront. The body is very well balanced with light and fresh green apple and apricot notes balancing the biscuity malt. Smooth, toasted biscuit and fruit finish.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation that is slightly chewy. Backs up the flavor profile quite nicely.  I received this in exchange for doing an oil change on a friends car and I was surprised to discover I had not reviewed it. I was even more surprised by how well I liked it. The light, earthy fruit notes complimented the toasted biscuit flavors of the malt well and helped the beer come off tasting fresh.

I feel like the buzz must have been some sort of craft cachet amongst not-really-craft drinkers who liked the name and label artwork. I'd place this right about at Yuengling level, which is to say better than macros but about halfway to the level of interesting crafts. Nothing offensive about it but nothing memorable either.

M: Decent carbonation, a little dry but not astringent in the finish. No discernible alcohol.  O: A good brew, but also rather boring. It's fine for quenching your thirst, but I wouldn't drink it purely for the taste experience.

Aroma was of a very pleasant, soft petal bouquet, almost fruity, and rose-petal-ish like scent.  Polished, crystal clear, fossilized amber in appearance. Cool and pleasantly carbonated. Taste was very faint, but easily drinkable. Spikes at a citrus-y pine in taste at first slowly melting into a drop of butter on moistened toast ahead towards the finish. The hoppy-pine taste lingering longer as the beer warms, and expressing more pale-ish tasting malts.  This was the best looking amber in color I've ever seen. The taste was nice, cool, faint and sessionable. I do agree with another viewer, ""not horribly complex"".

Mouthfeel - Light bodied, with decent amount of carbonation and bite.  Overall - Ahhh, this is the Fat Tire I remember. My initial review was poured from a bottle that tasted flat and bland.

MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a light to medium body (somewhere in between) with a light to medium texture, moderate carbonation and good body lacing that dissipated slowly. The initial flavor was moderately sweet with a lightly bitter finish that lasted for a moderate length of time.  DRINKABILITY: This was a good session beer.

192,607,rickyleepotts,3,"This beer hasn’t always been available here in the Midwest. I used to have my friends from out of town bring it in. But a few years ago, Fat Tire came to Indiana and we have been hooked since. It’s sort of like Yuengling. You still can’t get that here. Anyway, Fat Tire is an amber ale, and while I don’t usually like amber ales… this one has a certain spice that I can’t get enough of. Anyway, let’s see what this beer does for 1001 Bottles.  In the Glass: There isn’t much going on here. It’s sort of like any domestic beer you pour. The head is thin and weak, and the lace is almost nonexistent. But you don’t drink a beer like this for the quality, rather the drinkability that you can expect out of a beer that’s not quite a domestic (even though it’s made in the United States) but not quite a craft brew.  Nose: There isn’t much going on here. I do smell a hint of spice in there. Maybe some cinnamon.  Flavor: We are drinking this VERY cold, which makes sense for a beer like this. There isn’t a ton of flavor either. It has a punch of spice in the middle of the palate, but then it quickly fades away. There isn’t as much carbonation as you would expect from a beer like this, but drink it cold. It doesn’t do it any justice when it heats up.  Mouthfeel: It’s thin and smooth as it crosses your tongue. There are some subtle bubbles toward the back half of the palate, but they are there and gone before you know it. Those spices do, as you drink more, tend to pile on top of one another and stick around the more of this you drink.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste, at first, is weak and pretty much worthless. But after two, three, and more drinks the aftertaste starts to stick around and gain momentum. The beer also has a pretty good burp, leaving you with those same spices. The beer doesn’t have a big ABV, so there isn’t much, if any heat. But it’s not a beer that you save. It’s a beer that you drink three or four of with dinner or with buddies watching football. For the record… we don’t watch football.  Fat Tire is a good beer, but not great. It’s average, at best. It sells well because it’s new here. Plus, it has a cool story. I like the label too. If you haven’t had Fat Tire before, try it. You might dig it. But it’s not what I would call a craft brew. It’s also not a beer I would expect to find on a list like this. Of course, 1001 bottles is a LOT of beer. They can’t all be gems!  Beer Name - The bottle says: “Fat Tire Amber Ale’s appeal is in its feat of balance: toasty, biscuity-like malt flavors coating in equilibrium with hoppy freshness. Named in honor of a storied bike ride through Europe, Fat Fire cruises with Belgian imagination and inspiration. Take it for a ride.”",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RoamingGnome,3.83,"Enjoyed on tap while out for some wings. Arrived at my table in a New Belgium tulip style glass.  A) This is a very attractive looking red. There was about a full finger of slightly off white head. Decent retention on the head. Not much lacing.  S) This one is primarily malt aroma, slightly sweet, just a little bit of hops, which provides a distant floral/earthy aroma.  T) Roasted malty flavors, bready, caramel sweetness, blend together well with a light amount of hop bitterness, that leads to a very pleasing earthy quality. Decent finish and aftertaste.  M) A fairly light bodied beer, not overly carbonated. I wouldn't call this smooth, but it sits well and is refreshing.  O) Haven't had one of these in awhile, and it's still quite enjoyable. It was kind of like bumping into an old friend from school.

Aroma is a little weak, but I do detect faint hints of toasted malt and hops, as well as some grassiness. Taste is much better than I anticipated - a nice roasty character is strongly in the foreground and it is complimented by a light hop bitterness. It does not dry the palate as hoppier beers may, but I feel it is a little too 'watery.' This is a good 'everyday' beer, but truth be told I'd rather have a good Pilsener.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Somewhat grassy as well. Not my cup of tea.  Taste is much the same, except the medicinal hops dominate. Slight biscuit flavor, but its too crisp for my taste. Not bad, and I prefer it to BMC.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Labeerfinder,3.83,"Pours a nice amber color, lingering thin tan head with nice lacing. Sweet aroma, and initial caramel flavor. Ends with a slite bitterness to make it interesting.

192,607,jessbeis,3.88,"A -Golden color, can see clearly through, little head.  S - Label description describes this amber having biscuit like notes, this is certainly true. Not strong in aroma.  T - Quite mild. Surprisingly hoppy, but not overwhelming. Expected it to be sweeter, but still delicious. Well balanced with hints of caramel.  M - Light and crisp. Carbonation is evident. Should certainly be served cold.  O - While ambers are not my favorite, I enjoy this one due to its hoppy flavors. Better on draft, but not a bad option when looking to pick up a pint for a night in at home.  **Maybe a good beer to introduce to friends who are looking to drink ""better beers since it is quite mild.""",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,magictacosinus,3.57,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date is ""April 22, 2012.""  Pours an amber, slightly cloudy color with a generous portion of carbonation. Contains a very weak head, but a little ring ends up settling the top. Not too remarkable, but pretty decent and inviting enough.  This one is filled with lots of season types of aromas often found in winter warmers: pumpkin spice, slightly toasted biscuits, caramel malts, brown sugar… Overall, not bad! Usually can't stand ""seasonal"" beers but this one contains a good balance of hoppiness and malty feel (although far maltier) to make it out to be a crowd pleaser.  While definitely a malty cascade as it smells, there's a load of underlying hops that make it interesting and balanced. The biscuit flavor is ridiculously obvious here, and it would be no surprise if New Belgium Brewing Co. were attempting to make a different take on British bitters with the notable inclusion of extra spices and seasonal hops. While the flavor is pleasant, it gets far maltier as it warms up and little less enjoyable for me. The feel is slightly gelatinous when cold, but becomes progressively watery with any warming. There is no overpowering flavor of alcohol present, which definitely might have made this thing too sweet. Strangely, I'm curious how something this malty feels too thin in body.  This is an undeniable cult classic, which, just like SN Pale Ale and Anchor Steam, has found wide national distribution yet an obvious niche following of die-hard fans in the craft brewing world. Fat Tire was never my favorite due to the high maltiness and thinned body, but it is still a well made beer. It has all the right things going for it to be a well-received beer everywhere, and I take up the chance to drink one when offered. It may not be a personal favorite of mine, but it's earned my respect with its consistent recipe in the long run.

Leaves some nice legs after every sip.  Toasted malts and Caramel bring out most of the nose... Well I'll say all of the nose. I didn't get too much else out of this besides being very malty.  Taste is a touch different. Very nice malty beverage but there is a bit of a light, crisp hop kick to it. Though not overpowering just a nice touch.  Mouth was light bodied, good carbonation and a tad bit on the watery side.  I think in all fairness this falls into the category with Yuengling.

192,607,CHickman,3.66,"Pours crystal clear amber color with a 2 finger foamy white head that faded very slowly, creating caverns of foam as it faded and leaving very good foamy lacing clinging to the sides.  Smells of floral hops, grains, tea leaf, biscuit, fruit sweetness, caramel, bread, toffee, pine cone and bread; the hop blast fades quickly and turns grainy and bready for the remainder of the nose.  Tastes of biscuit, lightly toasted grains, floral hops, flowers, tea leaf, caramel, crisp wheat bread, sweet malt, light brown sugar, piney hops, vegetables, light spices and tree bark. The hops add flavor to the malt and bread profile, with the mellow sweetness of the grains the most prominent flavor. I detect some yeast in the aftertaste, which is dry.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with mild carbonation, a medium chewy body and real easy flow and feel to it.  A very good beer that a lot of people session if they enjoy malts. I always enjoy this beer, but would not session it myself – maybe two in one sitting.

192,607,denver10,2.93,"Pours a dark amber. Looks more viscous from an amber ale than I'd expect which I do like. Smells of the sweet, caramel malt and the taste maches. I'd say this one veers just too far off the sweet deep end for me. Medium bodied with some syrupy creaminess to it. I think this beer is a perfectly solid amber and it deserves its widespread popularity but, for me, I am not a huge fan of it as I find it to be just a little too sweet for my tastes.

Hops start to show up a bit more as the beer warms up, but this is definitely a malt forward beer.  Ml: Slightly less than medium bodied with mild carbonation.

192,607,damndirtyape,3.73,"Served in a shaker pint glass. Served at Kaiser Grille, Pam Springs CA.  Appearance: Clear coppery amber color with a light tan 1/8"" head. This died down a bit to a thin skin across the top but plenty of persistent lacing noted.  Smell: When first poured, strong toasted malts and even some hints of chocolate. As it warmed up, the malt smells died back and with a good swirl you could just pick up some of the toasted malt and maybe a hint of some floral hops. Smell definitely muted as the beer warms up.  Taste: Strong toasted malt, caramel, and even some roasted and mild chocolate notes in here as well. Hops are muted and start to show up a bit as the beer warms up, but definitely malt forward. The toasted malts are just right - not just sweetness, but a sweetness with some good character to it. The bitterness to balance out the malt strikes me more as bitterness from the roasted and toasted malts rather than hops, but there is a hint of earthy hops in here. I hesitate to say German-style hops, but I was not getting the typical American hop flavors with this one. Could have been the meal I had it with though (see below).  Mouthfeel: Nothing remarkable in the carbonation department, but definitely thicker than water. A little chewy.  Overall / Drinkability: One is enough, but it's an interesting one is enough. I had this with a whiskey brined porkchop, and it went quite well with this, but I noted after awhile I could really only taste the malt; hops are too blended in to pick out or the meal I had prevented me from really tasting the malt. Definitely above average but I think I was expecting more hop flavors to balance out the malt. Possible they were in there, I just couldn't pick them out.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S: Served in a chilled mug really masking true notes. Gummy, toasted bread notes. Warm mellow acidic fruit smell of orange.  T: Explosive notes in accordance of smell. Chewy, bready, gummy. Small traces of slightly burnt caramel malts really add to the complexion.  M: Bubbly bitter up front which makes for explosive flavor at the end even more enjoyable.  O: I finally understand why people go crazy about this beer. Way better on draft. Extremely fresh, crisp, clean and one of the most flavorful ales while perfectly balancing all the ingredients.

S - Lost of toasted malt character. Not much in terms of hops, or yeast, or alcohol.  T - Similar to the nose the toasted malt character is present throughout. The middle of the beer brings a mild bitterness from the hops. Fairly well balanced but the malt dominates. The beer finishes with a biscuit flavot that lingers.  M - Medium bodied with decent carbonation.  D - Good.  Overall, this is a solid offering from New Belgium. As I have been drinking this beer my whole adult life it seems the taste has changed slightly, perhaps it is just me. I just remember being blown away by it. Perhaps with more emphasis on craft beers my palette or mind has shifted or other beers has surpassed it. In any event I think NBB offers some better beers but this is solid.

Interesting side note - I have a buddy who lives in North Carolina and travels out to Colorado occasionally. He had this beer numerous times on tap while traveling and always raved about it. When they started selling it in North Carolina, he was really excited. After buying it a couple times, he was disappointed.

A fairly standard biscuit malt, the barest hint of fruity esters in the background but otherwise kind of boring and plain.  T. Sweet caramel malt, grainy flavor and feel...standard.  M. Medium bodied.  The perhaps textbook definition beer for the idea of an average and inoffensive beer that can come across as boring, and yet you drink it anyway because it is at least better than a BMC.

No hops apparent in the nose.  T: Mild woody flavours. Some dark fruits and maybe a bit of mild apple tang? Overall everything is extremely muted and weak.  D: Good drinkability, but not complex enough to choose this over another beer.  Overall: Fat Tire is just...boring. It doesn't offend; it doesn't really do anything. It just delivers an unoffensive and weak-flavoured version of a style that isn't all that exciting (unless its all hopped to hell) to begin with.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ThisWangsChung,3,"Welp...since I reviewed Fat Tire's big brother Ranger, why not give this one a spin? You know the old saying, you've made it big when you're on a neon sign behind the glass of your local wine and spirits place at the grocery store...  A: Nice, average fiery amber coloring with acceptable lacing on the glass.  S: Decently average smell of bready malts with some hints of caramel.  T: Well...um...it's average. It's a malt bomb with an adequate amount of roasted, bready, biscuity flavor. Not detecting much hops on the tongue.  M: Very average in its feel, with an average amount of carbonation and heft on the tongue.  O: This could very well the most average beer I've ever drank. Nothing terrible about it, and nothing great, either (except for the value that is...) It's a monument to pure adequacy, therefore, 3's across the board for this one!

S: Lightly toasted caramel malt, hints of lemon and grass...light biscuit character.  T: In line with the nose, crisp biscuity malt & a light toasted nutty character, flavors of lemon zest, grass, and just touches of tangy citrus bitterness as a light hop character arrives on finish.  MF: Crisp light mouthfeel, lighter body...a touch dry on the finish.  O: Balanced, but not my favorite...drinkable but forgettable.

Golden amber color with a 1 1/2 finger foam head. Malty sweetish aroma..nothing out of the ordinary. Taste is of malt and caramel. Ive heard it described as ""toasty""...I guess I can see that. Overall its a decent beer. I understand why its so popular, its easy to drink and it doesnt taste like butt, but New Belgian makes way better beer..like Belgo and Ranger for example.

I paid $3.99 – you can’t beat that!  Look: Light copper color - more golden than amber. Had high clarity and good carbonation. Head fizzled down to a thin tan inconsistent coating.  Smell: Aroma was slightly spicy with some brown sugar notes. Clean citrus hops came through.  Taste: A warming spice upfront – like cinnamon. Also an unsweetened earthy brown sugar. The middle was rather bland with a faint hop bitterness noticeable. There was that Belgian yeast funk, but I really had to search for it. The finish was very clean with some hop bitterness carrying over into the aftertaste.  This is an ok Amber. For the price, I certainly cannot complain. I’ll be picking up more of this one.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,joek440,3.47,"A - Clear golden orange color. Effervescent with medium light colored head.  S - Caramel malt and hints of citrus hops. Not very strong smell.  T - Lots of malt flavor but not as much citrus hop flavor as I was hoping for. Finishes on a bready yeast flavor. Malt and yeast are the highlights with just a hint of the hops.  M - Light and bubbly, easy to drink.  O - I can see why this is a widely distributed beer. It has a non-offensive flavor but is almost too simple. It is enjoyable and easy to drink. Was hoping for more of a hop flavor in this Amber Ale -- but the Belgian influences are noticeable.  (Reviewed 11/1)",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,boilermakerbrew,3.85,"A- Pours a light copper hue with a 2 finger foamy head that sticks around a little bit. Pretty good lacing.  S- Weaker than expected, but some caramel malts and citrusy hops ring through. Maybe a hint of a pine scent.  T- Nothing terribly complex, but solid. Starts with a mainly malty profile with a hint of caramel. Hops come in, mainly cascade if I'm not mistaken. Finishes off with a biscuity/bready taste that leaves the palate clean and crisp.  M- Somewhat creamy in your mouth. Not terrifically heavy or light. A decent amount of carbonation, but not too much.  Overall, this is a sessionable beer and one that doesn't break the bank. Being in college, heck, I might be persuaded to drink this at a party instead of trying to get drunk off of macros.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ReelBigwigFish,3.3,"Poured into pint glass, no freshness date.  A: Golden light amber color with minimal one finger off-white head that fell quick.  S: Light sweet malt, some grassy floral hops. Biscuity diacetyl.  T: Sweet buttery malt with mild herbal hops. Smooth throughout with the mildest prickling of dry hop flavor coming in and out.  M: Smoooth. Creamy, mild carbonation, easy drinker.  O: I live in NJ, where Fat Tire does not exist. That being said, there is a certain amount of hype surrounding it, as with everything that people are aware of but can't have. Anyway, on a trip to OBX last week, there was the full range of New Belgium, so we picked up a bunch. Now that I've had it, Fat Tire is a let down. Yeah it's decent, but I would not buy this again.

A - Pours nice amber orange with a dense two finger tall off white head leaving small rings of lace down the glass.  S - Smells of sweet caramel malts, toffee, dulled hops, and some fresh baked buttered biscuits...Based on the nose this one is a little past its prime.  T - Starts off with a big dose of sweet caramel malt slowly giving way to a mix of even more toffee sweetness, dulled out hops and some light buttery notes. There is plenty of biscuity taste and feel in this one. The finish is a mix of sweetness and chewiness, lingering on the pallet for some time.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, slightly chewy, feel that lingers on the pallet for some time.

Smell - The morning smells of fresh, light citrus fruits. A bit of orange and lemon. Not too strong of a smell.  Taste - I must admit that I am a little let down by the taste. This is a very average amber ale. No unique or outstanding flavors really shine here. A bit of citrus and lemon with red ale properties. Decent.

Perfect body, with a fluffy, egg-white head that steadily dissipates. Lacing is full-bodied and thorough. Well done.  S: Wet grass, metallic, malty hints. Bread. Nothing spectacular, and I may be imagining things.  T: Soddy and light grass. Some hop crispness, cider essence in the middle, and very light roasted malts on the backend.  M: Fits the style. I like a little more body though overall.  O: It’s a great session amber, evident in its early cult status (now that it can easily be had anywhere, it’s lost much of this).

S: The smell id very heavy on lightly toasted malts, grains and not much else. Maybe a hint of some floral hops.  T: Not a whole lot of flavor, actually. Toasted grains, kind of an earthy flavor, a slight hop bitterness. Like the aroma, it's simple, not very strong, but well balanced.  M: Medium-light body and ditto for the carbonation.  O: I'm a little torn on this beer. On the one hand it's not very flavorful, it's not very exciting, it's not all that good. On the other, however, it is good BECAUSE it's not very flavorful or exciting. It's an easy beer to drink. I think I could easily put back a six pack without realizing it.

A nice little sheen of cling.  Smell- A little bit of sweet apple skins with a lot of malt behind it and a slight bitter note from some hops.  Taste- The taste follows the nose with more malts and some deep citrus and a slight hop balance. A touch dry flavored with a chocolate powder flavor.  Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonation.

I think the clever name is a key part of the success of this beer, now let's try the goods!  The body is a deep amber with a good off white head and big malty aroma.  It looks like a craft brew for sure.  The flavor is mostly malt up front, and carries a lot of spice - I get nutmeg and cinnamon, throughout.  Here comes the ""flavorings"" debate.  OK, I do add lemon to my wheat beers, a big no-no for most of you.  But here I am on the other side of the fence, the spicy flavors are not my cup of tea.

Aroma is biscuity and malty with a hints of roastiness. Taste is very heavy on roasted notes. It's tasty, smooth and very crisp.  Body is middling with an appropriate level of carbonation. I can see why people consider Fat Tire to be such a great gateway to craft beer beer. It's very drinkable and highly sessionable....an enjoyable drink. I'd recommend it to my non-BA friends.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,psuKinger,2.91,"Bottle poured into a shaker-pint glass.  A: Pours a translucent orange, virtually no ""haze"", with a thick lively white head on top.  S: My sniffer must be broken? I pick up on... very little. Maybe just a hint of sweetness and an odd ""almost spoiled"" smell, but everything is VERY faint.  T: Light, thin, and crisp, the ""almost spoiled"" scent I picked up reminds me a bit of a Pilsner bitterness on the back end, would be interesting to see what kind of hops they are using here. Also, a touch of bisquity malts here as well.  Am having trouble deciding if, when it all comes together, whether it's ""pleasant"" or not. It's rather ""meh"". Mediocre.  M: Unremarkable. Finishes a bit dry and leaves a bit of sweatness behind. Carbonation could be a bit more distinguished for my liking.  D/O: An ""average"" craft beer.

The smell is of bready malts with a little floral hops. The feel is medium to light. The taste is as expected a little caramel, some biscuit malts with a little hop bite at the end. Overall this is a decent beer, there are far better craft beers but this one is occasionally available in places which only serve the big brand beers and is far better than those.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Receeds rather quickly leaving very light, almost no traces of lacing. Some carbonation streaming off the bottom of the glass.  S: Nose is mainly malts. Big bready malts, some sweetness as well. Mild floral hops with a great nutty character.  T: Taste is of lightly toasted malts, almost a big nutty flavor. Mild sweetness, but very balanced. Big biscuit-like qualities coming through, I'm enjoying this very much.  M: Medium bodied, great coating of the mouth. The carbonation is a little low, therefore the flavors linger a bit.

192,607,Hopfenpeter,3.58,"The beer is a nice clear honey amber deep gold, very beautiful, and builds a creamy white head, about two fingers high. It hangs around and produces nice lacing. The smell tells of delicate flowery hops, some mild malt and some sweet notes like honeycomb cereal. Tasting the beer, I was surprised how mild it was. Delicate bread, cereal and grain flavors up front, being followed by mild flowery hops which bring mild fruit flavors like apple and peach into the palette. The end is a well balanced combo of all the flavors. It is a very mild and light flavored beer, but well balanced and by no means watery or characterless.

192,607,output01x,3.71,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (Best Before 09/18/11) into a pint glass.  A moderate pour yields a 1-finger cream-colored head that fades after a few minutes to a thin, clumpy dusting and thick foam ring. The body is a perfectly clear honey gold with a good amount of rising carbonation bubbles. Good lacing can be seen clinging to the glass throughout consumption.  Sweet malts aromas carry notes of honey and bagels. Some mild floral hops aromas are also detectable in the background. Overall, the nose is not particularly strong but is definitely delicious.  Light, toasted grains gives this beer a rather breakfast cereal quality. Notes of sweet honey and bread are also noticeable. A light floral hops flavor is also present but is more of a background flavor. Like the nose, the flavors are not bold but are well balanced and enjoyable.  Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this is a very refreshing beer. The body is crisp and very drinkable. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy and really helps to move this beer along.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The head is nice and fluffy white and lingers for quite a while. There are a ton of carbonation bubbles rising through this brew.  S: Some decent hop aroma is noticeable through the smell as well as the malt background. The brew smells overall slightly sour.  T: The initial taste is of caramel and deep roasted grain. I think this tastes wonderful, however the flavors are definitely light and delicate. The aftertaste is of the grain with the mild hop bitterness to balance. Very in check and good. I love the biscuit flavors in this brew.  M: The MF is pretty average I would say. Light bodied and thin and very quaffable.  O: I think this is a good, pretty simple and straightforward ale.

S: Predominantly malty, the hops are definitely noticeable. Floral, but faint.  T: The taste comes and goes without you really realizing it. Some light hops and malts combine and are followed by a caramel malt finish. Really doesn't abide by typical Amber Ale taste guidelines, but I can see why this is considered a gateway beer. Very drinkable, yet has some characteristics of the better, bigger beers on the other side.  MF: Light, carbonated well, crisp finish.

Smell: Has a fruity smell reminiscent of apples or apricots. Has a significant malty/biscuity backbone to it as well.  Taste: Starts malty and very fruity. Finishes toasty with a mild hoppiness. Leaves a pleasant, toasty aftertaste. Has a mild yeastiness to it as well.  Mouthfeel: Reasonably full-bodied with an expressive carbonation.  Overall: I'm so glad that New Belgium has extended their distribution to Virginia! I've heard a lot of the hype surrounding Fat Tire and was disappointed at having never had it. Now that I have, it (mostly) lives up to its hype. It's a simple, unassuming, accessible beer. You don't have to be a huge hophead or beer aficionado to enjoy it.

192,607,Crossmd,2.83,"Poured 45 degrees into a tulip glass.  Pours a lucid red-amber with a 1.5 finger head that dissipates with some lacing.  Smells of a biscuit-pastry with a very odd wet-metallic, or urine smell. Maybe a slight herbal quality? Not really all that pleasing or complex. I'm trying to taste this more than smell it.  Taste is of a smooth, but one dimensional and unassertive. Some toasted malts with a slight coffee or carame only on the very beginning of the drydown. This beer is like that one friend that you have that comes to hang out with you but never says anything and just stares at women in the bar. Really sort of tepid, forgettable.  Overall, it calls itself an amber, but it drinks pretty thin. The ambers that i want to drink are robust, hearty often autumnal ales. This is feels like a ""light amber"" beer. Not well balanced in terms of smell and flavor, and for an additional two or three dollars you can probably get yourself something a lot more special.

S: Grainy, nutty. To be honest, it smells just like a box of freshly opened Cheerios.  T: Smooth and crisp. Again, the most up front quality here is the earthy grain. There's a lot of it, from start to finish. There's a touch of hop oil on the back end and finish that helps to liven things up.  M: Wonderful. It's got a layered texture to it that really adds something to the overall presentation, making come across a bit more complex then it actually is.  O: New Belgium's Fat Tire is pretty much what I expected: flavorful, quaffable and easy on the wallet.

Smell was actually pretty good in my opinion. Hints of malt and very small overtones of fruit.  Taste was good as well sort of chocolaty at the front with a small carbonation bite at the back of the mouth.

Very faint aroma of sweet malt with some fruity notes.  Flavor is extremely subdued. Malty sweetness with biscuity tones. Bitterness is low for the style, and hops are a fleeting afterthought, going virtually undetected in the flavor.  Rather thin feel, almost macro-ish. Nothing offensive here, but nothing special, either. Semi-dry in the finish, with a lingering dextrin-laced bitterness.

I try not to replicate phrases used on labels, but the feel of this ale truly was biscuity. The flavor won't bring me back, but the feel will.

I'm not kidding. It's no wonder that cheddar cheese is a good mix with this style of beer. It absolutely fits so well. But the smell is actually quite tame... too much. You can hardly smell much at all.  Mouthfeel: Lightly fizzy and super smooth. Nothing to complain about. It's definitely a drinker. It's even smoother on tap.  Taste: Simple, yet, good. Very much the same aftertaste as cheddar cheese, which is why that pairing is an excellent choice. Underwhelming immediate taste but just a lovely aftertaste. Not much complexity, but who cares, right?  Overall: A good beer and one of my favorites to pick up when you're at a bar that doesn't necessarily serve good beer or at a supermarket and just want a beer on a whim.

192,607,Rschis16,3.58,"Crystal clear amber colored beer with nice sized white head that dissapates down to a patchy film. Decent amount of visible carbonation. Sharp grapefruit hops are picked up on the nose as well as a bittersweet smelling maltiness that makes me wonder.  Acidic but malty, with a piney kind of hop that is overpowered by complex buscuity malts. The hops are there to help out the balance, but in my opinion, the balance is a little off. A tad too much of the toastiness boasted on the bottle and not enough of the hop freshness, even in a fresh bottle. The hops that are there contribute a bite in the back that tries to balance but doesn't quite get there. This could be a personal preference thing, so I am giving the benefit of the doubt a little, but something is not quite meshing for me. Crisp, clean and dry finish that is spot on for the style though.  All things considered, not a bad beer and definitely worth the try, but I don't know if I get all the hype for it.

Easy to drink, very full flavor.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is mild and tingles a little while after a little while. This does not compliment the taste very well, but does not infringe upon it very much either.  Overall: A very drinkable, dark amber ale. It has great flavor and great head making it quite an appealing bear to sip and look at. It is however, missing something. I cannot put my finger on it but I must say it fell short of my expectations I had for it.

Lightly earthy and spicy hop aromas contribute to a degree. A soft, faint tartness lurks in the background.  T: A bit toasty and bready up front. Mild caramel sweetness is present. A faint hop bitterness adds some balance, with a minor earthy flavor. A bit of yeasty tartness in the finish.  M: Rather light-bodied. Carbonation is average. A modestly dry finish doesn't prevent the mouthfeel from being fairly watery overall.  D: Quite inoffensive, in both good and bad ways.

192,607,GeoJ,2.58,"Big foo-fraw about Fat Tire going on sale in the Richmond VA area - Decent sale price at Martin's Supermarket as a promotion. Two 22oz. for $6.00  Poured into a pint glass. Appearance does not strike me as an ""Amber Ale"" - More of a golden wheat color.  1-finger head that disappears quickly - minimal lacing.  The only way I can honestly describe everything else about this beer is that I'm not the slightest bit impressed, considering the amount of hype it has gotten. Fairly boring brew that for the life of me tastes like nothing more than *slightly* better version of a run-of-the mill adjunct lager. Smooth drinkability, but it also has a lingering, metallic aftertaste that I personally can't abide.  Not that it's truly offensive or ""bad"" ... it's just ... meh.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Smakawhat,3.27,"Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. Nice label, 2011 Washington DC Commemorative Beer-Elation With Representation. Neat!  Out of the bottle, fat tire pours a gold color hitting the glass and presenting a more orange copper amber. Some rising carbonation but with a two finger small head that is sort of weak and foamy without much retention. Leaves a simple puck while drinking.  Bouquet is a toasty malt but also kind of grassy reminding me more of an Irish Red Ale. Good grain behind this with lots of toast, but this grass smell throws me off.  Taste is mostly missing a lot of what is on the nose. Gas carbonation on the palate mixed with grass mild hop. Weak texture and a little wet, with a mild toast finish.  Overall this is kind of boring, it really lacks a strong malt presence, has a weak texture and taste, and the nose while good, does not remind me of a nice amber. I have no desire to have this again. I would describe partaking of this drink as one big fat giant non event.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Smell: Has a strong caramel malt smell with a slight hop undertone.  Taste: A little sweet with a camramel aftertase that was a nice balance to the spicy hops.  Mouthfeel: Excelent carbonation with a beer that was a just little light.  Overall I would buy this beer again (if it was available in Michigan). Ilove the heavy malt flavor that is in balance with the hops. Most amber ales are just bitter with no malt backbone.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

M-medium creamy carbonation with a creamy finish. really smooth  O-not a bad beer. its an okay replacement for Yuengling while i'm out on the west coast. it isn't something i'll crave for, but i'll be excited to see it when i do, but probably only because i can't get it in Florida, otherwise i might not give it too much though at all.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,katybee,2.81,"hmmm. The taste of this ale was puzzling to me. Completely missing the hopping my tastebuds have acclimatized to, and lacking the overt maltiness as well.  pouring a deep golden yellow, creamy foam poured from the unshaken bottle. most impressive head I've seen in a while.  the smell however, was very mildly sour, or dry, somewhat in the way of Guinness...no hops really to balance it. As the beer warmed, this became more present, and on the palate as well.  the taste was different. totally lacking excessive hopping. If present, the hops were mildly greenish and floral, definitely no citrus or pine. Perhaps lightly peppery. But mostly the taste emphasized a biscuity maltiness, not sweet at all, or burnt, chocolate or coffee...just grainy but wholesome and rounded....A bit like a pale light version of Guinness stout or budweiser without the hops.  Very lightly creamy, especially as it warmed up, but only light-medium bodied.  Overall this is a very nuetral beer, a nice change of pace from stouts, black ales, imperial ales, and hop czars. Much more substantial than a PBR, and none of the wheatiness of widbeers and hefweizen.... Don't know that I'd seek it out, though.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

A hint of some belgian yeast in there as well.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Bonis,3.38,"Review from notes: 7/29/2011  A - Clear goldenish/amber in color. Thin white layer of bubbles hangs around throughout. Not bad, not special.  S - Not much here. Dominated by bready malts with a touch of lemony hops.  T - Very malty and biscuity with a decent balance of hops. Bready to start and slightly dry and bitter on the finish. A fairly clean tasting beer. Nothing too exciting or offensive. A real beer drinkers beer. Alcohol can be traced, but nothing too much (was surprised at how notable it was for the low ABV). This isn't really my cup of tea, but would be a good summer drinking beer.  M - Nice body for the style. A little too prickly with bubbles due to the excess carbonation in this one.  O - A pretty nice beer that I heard a lot about before trying it. I would compare this to Bell's Oberon, in that it is a beer that many people like and sort of hype up, but us beer snobs aren't often amazed by it. I understand the two beers are nothing alike, but I'm sure most ppl get my point.

Up front this beer has a really nice malt profile, but there's a smoky or burnt flavor that I detect in the finish. There is also a decent hop character but it is at odds with the malts. The hops come across more citrusy which does not balance well with the smoky malt character. Mouthfeel is nice though; crisp, clean, and medium bodied.  Though this is NB's flagship, I think they have so many other great beers to offer that are far better than this.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mactrail,3.27,I guess we should be grateful that New Belgium has a big hit to support their more interesting beers. Mellow tang but dirty aftertaste. Muddy taste but has a touch of sprightly hops. Seduces with some roasted malt flavors but tails off into dishwater. Best feature is the nose of caramel and flowers. An average example of a style that has few standouts. This is not one of them. A well made but tedious beer.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

A- Dark Copper color with a slight head. Looks great in my free New Belgium.  S- Sweet malty with a bit of hops  T- I'm normally a hop head, but the sweet maltiness of this beer is absolutely delicious. I don't know the technical terms, but a sweet ""bready"" flavor to this is how I'd describe it.  M- Feels great going down  Overall I love this beer.

Not much of a head, but a solid half finger.  Smells like toasted caramel malt, with some light earthy hop aromas.  First thing that comes through is some sweet caramel malt with a light hop bite that includes some slightly citrus and floral flavors. After this comes what I consider the signature Fat Tire taste, sweet toasty bread like flavors come through and linger around for a few seconds. Maybe some light butterscotch on there too.  Mouthfeel is adequate. A little higher in carbonation. Very drinkable though.  Overall, this is a solid amber ale. A lot of ambers to me are just meh.

192,607,biegaman,3.68,"It has a dainty amber core and soft-pressed haze, but Fat Tire burns up like it were a lamp. A beer this radiant looks an instinctive accompaniment to hot weather and a thirsty palate, even if it means drinking straight from the can. The staying power of its head and scabrous lacing, however, shows that it's rather deserving of a proper glass (if not chalice).  The beer has a soft, spongy toffee bouquet that is only mildly sweet but supremely appealing. Light fruity esters may develop from swirling but those honey-and-biscuit malts - rather Belgian-esque malts, it should be noted - simply dominate. It doesn't quite lavishly pamper the nose, but it does make sure that it's been properly looked after.  Likewise for the taste: the palate isn't spoiled but it is properly looked after. Biscuit-like malts, modestly sweet with wafer-like overtones, again govern the profile but fruity yeast esters stay buoyant and a stale black pepper taste, err, well, peppers the finish. Earthy, herbal hoppiness may not be that perceptible, but it's been spun in there rest assured.  Fat Tire has a full and wholesome maltiness that is thick enough to gratify without being too thick so as to fill you up. At a modest alcohol strength, there's no telling how many I could have before thinking better about having one more; it truly is an enjoyable, easily quaffed ale. It's no surprise this microbrewery, now America's third largest, has done so well.  New Belgium haven't built their house on sand, they've gone about things the right way: they've made strives for environmental sustainability, social and civic responsibilities, and they've built their reputation behind a solid, reliable, extremely agreeable flagship brand. Fat Tire doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it sure hits the spot on a nice, sunny day!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,tito42,3.02,"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. Best by 25 SEP 2011 stamped on label.  A: Crystal, light copper with a copper hued head that dissipates fairly quickly and doesn't leave much lacing.  S: Strong toasted malts with biscuit and a slight hops aroma and a touch of honey.  T: Toasted malts, bready, biscuity, with a bit of cherry and a bit of a hops finish. Slight hint of pine oil.  M: Light-bodied and watery. Extremely clean and crisp.  O: The flavor doesn't work for me personally, but this is an important crossover craft beer. Lacks in many respects, however, and I would much rather have a Boulevard Amber Ale brewed locally. Readily available in many places as one of the most common 2 or 3 true craft brews outside of the local favorites.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,sauron681,3.3,"Pours a reddish-gold color with blotchy head, very sticky lacing, and good carbonation. Aroma of bananas, bubble gum, and flowers. Has a very musty grain flavor to it, it is a very predominant must to it, overwhelms the light bubble gum flavor i occasionally could pick up. Also seems to have a stale taste to it, however, it is not stale if that makes sense. Feels like after drinking it, I needed to floss my teeth.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Jerone,3.72,"A - Pours a clear brown with a thin head and a small amount of carbonation.  S - Smells like lightly roasted malts and toasted bread.  T - Tastes of toasted biscuit/bread and lightly roasted malt. Hardly any aftertaste, no bitterness at all.  M - Light mouthfeel with slight carbonation. A very drinkable beer.  O - A very good beer but not a great beer. Would be good any time of year, I would buy it again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,archaeofreak,3.97,"Poured from a standard bottle into a glass. Excellent hoppy aroma and flavor profile. Pours smoothly with a deep reddish brown color, with excellent head retention and superior lacing on the glass. Strong mouth-feel and nice bite. Hops might be over-whelming to some. Overall, quite enjoyable as a six pack, but more than 6 might be too much hops.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,zeledonia,3.48,"A classic summer beer that I drank many times before becoming a real beer enthusiast. Trying it again, for the first time. Bottle says best before 11 Sep 2011.  Pours a medium orange-amber color, quite clear, with a fluffy one-finger off-white head. Head recedes rather quickly, but leaves a load of sticky lacing on the glass, and a coaster of foam on the surface.  Smells super toasty and biscuity. Loads of sweet, buttery, bready malts dominate the aroma. With the exception of the light hop aromas hiding in the background, it smells like a cookie.  Taste is fairly similar to the smell. I get much more of the toasted malts than anything else. Not quite as cookie-like as the smell, but still pretty biscuity. Very little hops in the flavor. Overall, I find it kinda bland. And not as refreshing as I remember it, largely due to the mouthfeel...  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, rather light on the carbonation. Feels like water, but heavier. Kinda weighing me down on this warm summer night. It's got no spring in its step.  Decent beer, nothing special. Solid biscuity malt flavors, but I don't find a whole lot more to it than that.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,PeprSprYoFace,3.61,Had this a million times before but never reviewed it. It was my beer of choice before I would say that I really got into craft beer.  Poured into a pint glass. Nice clear amber color. Film white head and ok lacing.  Aroma is just kinda malty. Not much goin on. Just like stickin your nose in a sack of malted grains.  Taste is solid. Nice malt flavor but with a slight hop bite in the finish. Easy drinkin.  Mouthfeel is smooth and good carb.  Overall a solid beer and a go to of mine for parties because I know so many people that aren't super into craft that like it and I can still support the smaller guys.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,STKPICR0720,4,Great gateway brew. This brew should be one of the first when venturing outside your normal domestic home. Smooth not a high ABV so very enjoyable for newbies. This beer is brew with a passion that is also found in the beer. Great taste that lingers and smell that offers a lingering smile. Good brew and most definitely a brew that everyone should try at least once.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,corcoranjc,3.68,"appearance: small tan/white head, nice amber appearance...nice lookin' brew.  smell: lots of malts. sweet. fine.  taste: sweet malts leaving a residual sweetness after the swallow. not generally my cup of tea, but it is refreshing and not so overly sweet like some ambers or browns.  mouthfeel: perfect for this beer. not too full...if it was any fuller the sweetness and thick mouthfeel would play off each other in a bad way. as it is the beer is smooth and sessionable.  Overall: there was a time that i did not like this beer at all as i tend to lean toward pale ales, ipas, etc. and shy away from the ambers and brown ales. however, this is a good beer and is one that i will now buy on occasion and truly enjoy. i was once told that this beer was produced to be a crossover beer..one that can be enjoyed by both beer geeks and the less casual beer drinker. i appreciate this, and i like craft breweries making beer that is easy drinking and has mass, commercial appeal.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Appearance-Dark red, almost brown. 1 finger light brown head, not much retention. Some nice lacing  Smell-Malts, lots of it. Some light citrus.  Taste-Light caramel, brown sugar. Pretty sweet, lightly hopped. As a whole nice taste, but nothing to go crazy about.  Mouthfeel-Pretty light, moderate carbonation. I got a 24 ounce glass, and about halfway through I wish I just got a 12.  Overall-Nice gateway beer, but not a session beer in my opinion.

The aroma shows a lot of bready, biscuity, slightly grainy flavors. I get a little caramel to it as well. Not a bad aroma, but a little one dimensional.  The taste has more of a caramel and toffee flavor to it. I get some of the bready, biscuity flavors as well with just a hint of graininess to it.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it's a decent beer, but nothing that really stands out. It's flavorful but feels a little one dimensional to me.

192,607,Northsider,3.53,"I had this in a bottle. Pours nicely, dark amber with white head  Smell is very bready and malty. Some spices pop out.  Taste is very low in bitterness and hops. Has a subtle fruity flavor that is followed by bready/wheatiness.  Overall a simple and balanced beer. Available widely to most people. Not a bad choice",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,blackcompg,3.83,"This bottle came from a New Belgium Folly Pack. Pried off the cap, poured into my 12oz beer glass and...  Appearance - Impressive, this poured about 2 fingers of brite white head, small tight bubbles, came down to a half finger in a couple of minutes, already getting light lacing from turning the glass. Color is a gorgeous, almost glowing amber gold, perfect clarity - really a nice looking beer. *Beer is nearly finished, and solid lace lines for every sip, did not expect this, very nice!  Smell - Smells of bread, slight citrus and something like apple or pear, overall a pleasant, sweet smell from the bottle. From the glass, Wow! Literally freshly baked bread, sweet white/sourdough bread - this smell is absolutely forefront now, slightest citrus/pear/minerals in the background.  Taste - Starts out fresh warm bread from the bakery, then a wonderful mixture of subtle grains, grass, slight pear/apple, slight minerals, crunchy dry breadcrust at the end... and then all of a sudden, there it is... some subtle dry hops! A very welcome surprise at the end making for a very clean, crisp (from the tingly carbonation), tart finish, primed for the next sip.  Mouthfeel - Light-Medium body, not overly sweet at all, not quite creamy, but definitely a smooth and easy drinker. Some satisfying breadth and complexity during the sip, nice crisp dry finish and slight bitterness long after the sip. Very refreshing, head and shoulders above any macro-brew.  Overall - I have to admit, I did not expect to like this. But when I consider the style, this beer is really doing alot of things right. I prefer beers with higher ABV and bolder flavors, but I find myself being completely impressed with the complexity of the flavors, and how really well balanced they are, and how well they work together. Flavors are all on the lighter side. This would make a fantastic session beer, and I can see enjoying many of these wiith friends, great conversation and warm weather. This is readily available, and I recommend that you give this one a try :)",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,djeucalyptus,3.24,"realized I'd never reviewed this rare gem, so here goes nothing.  pours a surprisingly nice light amber with marigold highlights into my new belgium tulip. A frothy, thick two-finger head fades slowly to a thin cap that leaves solid lacing. Looks good.  aroma is malt, a touch funky, nutty and corn. earthy and grainy. hints of earthy hops. the grain aroma gets stronger as it warms.  taste is clean, crisp, hints of fruit, hints of malt, and a touch of hops - just enough for a pleasant crisp bitterness. apples, pear, some wheat and a touch of white sugar.  mouth is solidly clean, with moderate body, ample fine carbonation, almost creamy but not too thick. really works.  all in all, what can i say that hasn't been said? When fresh, it's pretty solid. when not brand-spankin-fresh, it's border-line awful... which is why I'm tossing it a slightly lower score... something about the malt profile just gets funky as it warms.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,JNewbs,3.93,"I really dig this beer. I've not had many sessionable beers that were this quality. The appearance was good and as expected. A bit of a head with decent retention. The color is a clear amber. The smell is nothing outstanding - dominated by breadiness and malt. The taste is exceptional for such a light tasting beer. Lots of biscuit, malt flavor that finishes clean and crisp. An easy beer to knock back a 6 pack of on a hot day. I would definitely give it my recommendation. I wish we got it in Ohio.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,airheadmtrcycle,4,"An aggressive pour into a New Belgium over-sized wine glass looks nice. About a finger or more of head over a copper ale. It leaves some nice lacing.  Aroma is malty/biscuit -y, some spice and something I can't place. Not much hop aroma.  Taste is dominated by the malts, and they are delicious. It is different than other amber ales, but I can't say why, really. The finish is (very) mildly spicy and hoppy, but that doesn't take anything away from this beer. In fact, it shows restraint and makes for a tasty brew.  Most of the beers I favor are in the extreme category. Lately I'm going back and trying to fully appreciate a well done beer, even if it's right in the middle of the bell curve. Fat Tire is one I would put right down the middle. I can appreciate the craftsmanship that went into Flat Tire.  The mouth feel seals the deal. It's medium on the palate with a perfectly refreshing carbonation.  Overall, Flat Tire is a very good beer and one I'll come back to. Don't come looking for any extreme bitterness or alcohol and I can give it a solid recommendation. I will pair it with a burger or dog from the grill, hot wings or just about anything else for that matter.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,MaltsOfGlory,2.95,"Pours a pretty small, one finger head. The head is completely white and has some small and some big bubbles. Barely any lacing throughout the beer, and the head has already completely dissipated. The body is a light amber/orange color, it looks exactly like apple juice looks, for sure lighter in color than a traditional amber ale. Visibility is better than it should be, there really isn't much obstructing my view at all. The carbonation is extremely small, like, ridiculously small, there aren't more than two or three bubbles coming up at one time. Overall the appearance is ok, it's only redeeming factor is...it looks like beer. Small amount of hops on the smell, barely any at all, mostly pale malts here. I knew this wasn't a great amber ale, but this is kinda embarrassing on the smell. I really don't get much in the way of hops at all, and it just smells watery. I mean not much else to talk about, small amount of hops, mostly malt, watery. Overall average smell. The taste is no different, bad malts on the taste and a very very small hop note, somewhat watery as well. I suppose the taste is a little better than I thought it would be, but not by much. I mean the smell was really bad (considering it's a micro brew), and the flavor is only kinda bad. I mean I can at least taste the hops without trying too hard searching for them, where as in the smell it was reaaal difficult. This beer is closer to a 3.5 on the taste, but really not nearly close enough to get a 3.5, still a pretty solid 3. Pretty average taste overall, watery, malty, slightly hoppy, but not much. Mouthfeel is pretty terrible, I gave this beer a little hope with the carbonation, thinking maybe my eyes were deceiving me, but no, almost no carbonation in this beer. It feels like I'm drinking beer flavored water, so little carbonation it's not even funny. I know it's not good to overdo it on the carbonation, but they under did it, BIG time. The body isn't saving the mouthfeel either, it's thin, watery and not much too it. Overall on the mouthfeel...wow, not good. Drinkability is this beers only redeeming factor, it goes down easy and there isn't anything too offensive about it. Overall on this beer, it's a lot worse than I remember it, a lot less flavor and the mouthfeel is a lot worse than I remember. It's not a horrible beer, it's not hard to drink and it doesn't taste horrible, it's just really not a well crafted beer.

There's an aroma that's also a lot like honey. Bready, sweet, simple. There's something slightly unpleasant here though that I can't quite put my finger on; the only thing I would call it is ""wet wood.""  An incredibly bready beer. Little hop bitterness, and a very simple, one note, though pleasant, flavor. Caramel and bready malts dominate this beer.  Medium mouthfeel. Ample carbonation.  A simple, one-note, bready amber ale.

I wasn't too impressed; however, this is their flagship beer, so I'm more than willing to have my mind changed. Let's see:  A: Pours a dull, hazy orange/amber. A thin, off-white head expands rapidly from the pour and leaves a large amount of bubbly, expansive lacing. Looks a bit thin.  S: There's a distinct sweetness in the nose, almost like apple cider or bananas. An earthy yeast aroma finishes it off. Smells a bit sour at times.  T: At first, all you taste is the wheat - present, but pretty thin. The yeast is fruity and phenolic, but again, thin. It's a blend of flavors that could have been done better, and has.  M: Good drinkability, although it really just reminds of a BMC after a while.  O: The beer has good intentions - that's easy to tell. In my opinion, though, New Belgium didn't execute.

Overall - An above average beer that would work very well for a session. It's not the most exciting beer, but it has enough flavour to keep me interested.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,CaptDavyJones,3.83,"Poured a dark amber color from a 12 oz bottle with a one-finger head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma was more on the malty side with hints of hops coming through. Tasted more along the lines of an ESB. Slight bitterness from the hops coming towards the end. This would make for a nice sessions beer. Nothing too fancy, but a reasonable drink nevertheless. Worth a try.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,rawfish,3.54,"Poured from can to NB globe.  Tawny amber colored body with a rocky 3 finger parchment shaded head. Retention falls a little short but leaves some netted lacing all over the glass.  Bready caramel malts, with a touch on honey. Earthy hops balance this out. Some weird aroma like raw pumpkin and a little metallic, a little out of sorts.  Biscuit flavor mirrors the aroma along with some raw grain, honey and mint underlaying. Hops are earthy and do just enough to push back the bready malts to a reasonable level. That unique bready aftertaste is very present but the drink is still crisp.  Average body and carbonation, balance is obviously swayed a little bit towards the malty end but always crisp and satisfying.  Fat tire has that bready/biscuit taste that seems prevalent in a few of NBs main brews but there is a considerable amount of variation based on tap and bottle age. This is the first time I smelt the off aromas, perhaps due to canning. Always a balanced refreshing brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jsanford,3.46,"22oz bottle poured into a NB globe.  A - Pours a clear amber with a thick, bone-white head of creamy foam that dissipates slowly, leaving some streaky lacing clinging to the glass. S - Crisp, caramel malt with a slight buttered toast aroma and a bit of earthy hops in the finish. Smells sweet. T - Grainy caramel malt, again fairly sweet and buttery, balanced nicely by the slightly bitter, earthy hop finish. Not too complex, but very crisp and refreshing. M - Very smooth, with a medium-light body and fairly sharp carbonation. O - An excellent hot-day beer, very sessionable and enjoyable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S: Whole wheat bread, underripe bananas, slight coconut, leafy hops... OK. T: Exactly what you'd expect from the smell, but with a metallic bitterness in the hops, a general ""milk"" creamy quality throughout, and a heftier wheat character. It's OK. M: Thicker and milky with a frothy crisp finish. O: This is all right. It would rarely be my first choice.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Appearance- Clear Orange in color, Frothy, 4 fingers of Head leaves netting type of lace.  Smell- There is an Amber smell with a great ton of floral hop notes and yeast.  Taste- A mild hop taste up front and then a grainy flavor. There is a light amount of bitterness and fruit as well.  Mouthfeel- Light bodied, medium casrbonation and crisp, smooth like always! Can always count on a Fat Tire to be the same.  Overall- Always refreshing! Always know what it will taste, feel, and drink like.

It resulted in above average amount of lacing. The aroma is malty, biscuitey and has a slight hop aroma. The taste of this beer is a nice balance of toasted malt, biscuit, and hop bitterness. Did I mention Sweet. Yes, It's sweet. I have had scores of American Amber Ale's and this by far is the best. Obviously, this is a classic craft beer.

Smells weak, slight grassy notes mixed with some mild malts Taste is much like the smell, bits of malt with very little sweetness, mild grass and hay, not much in the way of hops stand out. They're there but subdued. Feels a little thin and fizzy and finishes with a lingering bitterness in the back of the throat. Nice hot summer day beer with a low ABV.

192,607,BerkeleyBeerMan,2.67,"Appearance: The beer pours as transparent rusted honey. The head is uneven with patches of bubbles. This is way too carbonated and in my opinion the appearance doesn't hold up well in the amber category.  Smell: The ale smells like warm biscuits smothered in butter. There are hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. I am thinking of excess and lack of subtlety when I taste this beer. I feel the brewers were exuberant about making something original in taste but forgot to take quality into consideration.  Taste: My immediate impression is of soggy graham crackers sprinkled with nutmeg and ginger. It leaves a peanut butter aftertaste in my mouth There is no balance in this beer. The spice flavors are overpowering and artificial tasting, while the hop languish in the mix. Fat Tire is extremely dilute. I don't want to drink any overly carbonated craft brews again. I have had good New Belgium beers before.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is watery, bland, and forgetful.  Overall: I like some New Belgium beers, but I find it hard to understand why Fat Tire is so popular. I don't understand the hype.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,angrybabboon,4.05,"Review adapted from notes taken 8/27/10  Appearance: Clear with a bright amber color and a white head that quickly turns to thin white lacing  Smell: Light, sweet biscuits, subtle floral hops, an overall scent of sweetness  Taste: Mostly tastes like sweet, dry biscuits - some caramel malts, doesn't exactly taste like a typical amber as it is a bit lighter - some spicy flavors and there are some hops, but mostly the taste is dominated by the sweet malts - not complicated, and great for what it is  Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with nice carbonation, feels like it could be a bit smoother  Overall: Probably not worth the hype, but it is noteworthy because of its absurd level of drinkability  Maybe this beer gets a lot of hate because the hype might imply that it is more complicated than it is. It's a simple yet well-balanced amber. It's an easy drinking beer that I honestly wish I could keep in my fridge year-round.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Fatheranderson,3.96,"For the price, it's an excellent beer. I really don't have any complaints.  Appearance: Dark reddish orange. Looks like I'd expect from a fine amber ale.  Smell: Eh... the smell is kind of hard to detect at first. It smells like warm buttered biscuits... kind of... not a whole lot going for it in the nose section.  Taste: After the smell, I wasn't expecting much, but fortunately, I was completely wrong. This beer is very malt forward with just a hint of hops circling in the background. Just enough to give it that flavor without overpowering the malty earthy sweetness that makes this beer so good.  Mouthfeel: Not too thick, not too thin. Nothing ultra impressive here, but definitely a good mouthfeel.  Overall: I'd recommend this for a session beer. It's relatively cheap, has good flavor and goes down smooth. I'd drink it any day.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Here goes --  22 oz. Bomber bottle, best before May 15, 2011.  American Amber, eh? I've always heard that this was based on Belgian Pale Ale.  A -- Deep golden-amber with a firm, slow-settling, off white head that leaves good lacing.  S -- Aroma has prominent DMS with spicy hops in the finish. There's biscuit malt & some Brett in-between, but very fleeting.  T -- The flavor is a nice balance of mellow caramel malts and mildly spicy hops. That Brett character is present in the background, but far from overpowering. The finish spicy, lightly bitter, hops with the lightest citrus character and an aftertaste of nutty malt.  M -- Mouthfeel is crisp with a light medium body.  D -- Drinkability is certainly good and I'll keep this in mind for those bars and restaurants that might not offer much else.

192,607,KajII,3.2,"[Best served in an Pint glass]  The pour was a sparkling clear light copper with an average (1-2 finger) foamy white head that diminished in a few minutes and had OK lacing.  The aroma was of a biscuit malt, a mild herbal hop and a doughy yeast with mild hint of citrus, caramel and was a little nutty.  The taste was lightly malty with a hint of caramel in the beginning and took on a very light bitter and crisp flavor with a small citrus note at the end. The flavor faded rather quickly after the swallow leaving almost nothing behind.  Mouthfeel was just a bit above light in body and creamy yet watery in texture with a prickly carbonation.  Overall a decent tasting brew, nothing overly special but quite drinkable none the less. Would make a great session beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SkunkWorks,3.68,"Had this before in a bottle. This time, I'm getting it in the can thanks to CurtisMcArthur. Thanks for the trade and the chance to try this beer!  12 oz can with a best before date of May 2011 stamped on the bottom. Poured into an Irish pint glass.  Look: clear amber body. A very aggressive pour yields about a finger of off white head with decent retention and a little bit of lacing.  Smell: toasted, biscuity malt with some earthy hop aromas. Compared to the bottle I had, not as strong and a bit more centered on the toasted malt than I remember it being.  Taste: follows the nose with toasted malt being in the forefront and a slight taste of earthy hoppiness. There's not a whole lot going on here except the toasted malt, which is a bit too forward for me.  Feel: thin body, crisply carbonated, and a little sweet.  Drink: quite an easy drinking beer. Since there's not much flavor, you don't have to worry about getting a fatigued palate.  Overall, the can isn't as good as the bottle. There seems to be something different about it... the toasted malt flavor is a bit too forward and its a bit too one noted for me. Stick to the bottle is my advice.

Smell - I gathered a toasty sweet maltiness right off the bat. Subtle hoppy undertones as well.  Taste - Tasted very similar to the smell with sweet toasty malt taste up front with a nice hoppy bitterness on the back end.  Mouthfeel - A medium bodied offering with a good amount of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Drinkability - A nice smooth beer that is very easy to drink. The carbonation gives it a heavier feel than it actually is.  I have had the opportunity to try this beer on mutiple occasions and have yet to be dissapointed.

First sip is biting, very thirst quenching. Hops and roasted barley hit the palate. Let your pint warm up though. When it's fresh out of the fridge, there's a little bit of a bitterness that gets softer after a few minutes.  As for mouthfeel, it's a crisp feeling, with a creamyness that washes over the palate & tongue. The carbonation is perfect, it's not too little nor too much.

S: I sniffed, and detected something unexpected, something I couldn't immediately identify. Sniffed again. Yep, I knew that smell, but still couldn't place it. On a long, open mouth inhale, it hit me - strawberry jam on bisquits. OK, maybe nobody else got this impression, but once I pegged that aroma, it stuck in my head every time I lifted the glass (and I happen to love that smell - not the cheapo manufactured strawberry crap or the grocery store berries that are picked green - this is the smell of jam made from home-grown, fully ripe berries.) After I got past that first impression, I identified sweet malt, bisquit, ripe fruit and a little citrus.  T: Rewarding taste. Reinforced my strawberries on biscuits impression, but this is all beer, no fruit beverage here. Nice balance of hops to malt, but with a little lingering sweetness on the tongue.  M: Medium body, slight tingly sensation from the carbonation, fairly dry. Good back-of-the-mouth effect.  D: This is a very drinkable beer. I enjoyed this a lot, and will come back to it.

Head is light, frothy, recedes quickly but never disappears entirely. Nose is biscuity malt, which this seems to be renowned for, with an earthy quality to it. Taste is again (pleasantly) murky biscuit malt with a very, very, faint fruity quality. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not really a major infraction. This is something of a icon here in Colorado; therefore, at any major event here there's a good chance this will be available to save you from the usual macros you'd be forced to endure.

Some bread notes also present.  For an amber it is amazing. It has a great smell and flavor. Usually most American ambers are too sweet and malty with no hop backbone for me.

192,607,CuriousMonk,3.5,"Review #400. Usually drunk out of a 12oz bottle or on tap in available bars throughout the country. One of my first craft beers back in my college years. From notes -- Appearanace: Russet amber that glimmers in the glass. Lots of bubbles that rise to a thin off-white head. Aroma: Toast and homemade popcorn. Taste: Toasty, malty, firm biscuit presence leads into a mild warm hop statement, and finishes with a bitter snap. Lovely! Palate: Goes down smooth, jovially, agreeably, and maltily. Overall: A great, well-balanced brew with a malt-foot forward. Easy, extroverted, not too complex but not at all boring!

192,607,davidvaz,1.17,"Drank it straight out of the bottle.  This beer smells like someone stale beer in a plastic cup from the party the night before.  Tastes like someone dropped a greasy wrench in the water then brewed the beer. I dread belching and having to taste it again.  Mouthfeel low carbonation, very little aftertaste; flat finish.  Drinkability: I can barely finish one. Even though it is 3 months before the exp. date, it seems flat and on the verge of getting skunky.  I bought the variety pack to try the various Fat Tire Ales and I am very disappointed with the amber ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,stakem,3.68,"12oz brown bottle care of Pete, thanks man and thanks to Mike for bring it home from Texas. The presentation is a brown format bottle that is ""westvleterenesque"" in the way it has a small raised collar around the neck of the glass. Best before dating of February.  Poured into a pub glass, this brew appears a clear golden copper color that is quite clear except for the tiny particulate floating around in suspension. It displays just shy of 2 fingers worth of slightly yellowish stained head that is creamy. It recedes back to a thin layering across the top and leaves a webbing of patchy lace about the glass.  The aroma includes a scent of fresh grains upfront that has a lightly toasted quality. The hops come across with a light fruity scent that is almost like orange-rind. Further inspection reveals a light sulfur note towards the back end of the nose. Diacetyl comes forward and is evident as this brew warms up.  The taste further encompasses all the aspects included in the nose. A fresh grainy taste is upfront with a flavor of toasted malt that imparts a touch of sweetness which brings out a slight fruity character that is lightly orange-like. The aftertaste has a touch of sulfur and buttery notes of diacetyl that linger in the mouth with a light yeastiness and bready grain.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is well rounded and a fine example of the style. The alcohol is well hidden and it is quite drinkable. The good aspects of this brew far outweigh the negative, there is a reason these guys have been around for 20 years now.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Whould I buy it again: Absolutely Would I recommend it to a friend: Absolutely Would I drink it if I was offered at a party: Absolutely Would my wife drink it: Yes Overall: This is my favorite beer, hands down.

192,607,morimech,3.31,"The first time I had this beer I was underwhelmed. It was one of my first reviews. Now after a few years and close to a 1000 reviews under my belt. I felt it was time to revisit this beer. This time I got the beer in cans. Amber color with just the slightest bit of haze. One inch of solid head forms and has good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Still not a fan of the aroma or flavor. But it has nice qualities. Definately on the malty side of the beer spectrum. Has a bready and slightly musty quality. Not much for hop aroma or flavor. It is a lighter beer with low ABV, so the body has enough heft and has a nice texture. Not ever going to be in my regular rotation, but it does drink nice and there is no problem downing a few in a sitting.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,emmasdad,3.53,"I've had this one so many times, in many different formats, and it always struck me as a serviceable beer for many occasions, and one readily available in many bars locally. My favorite experience with this one took place on Halloween, '03 or '04, trick-or-treating with 4 kids on a cold, nasty, snowy night, shivering on a doorstep in Littleton. The door opened, the lady smiled and offered us a beer.

T: Taste is not very complex, but is a nice balance of malts and hops. Overall character is slightly bitter.  M: Clean, with kind of a thin body. Moderately carbonated and a very slight bitter aftertaste.

192,607,steve8robin,2.79,"Got this to try something new. Have an uncle that likes this stuff, so, let's see. 12oz bottle. Best before 04/03/11...  A: BMC colored. A super clear golden honey with apparent carbonation bubbles and a small white head that fades quickly to a lace. Decent.  S: Smells of honey, spices, and faint nutmeg upfront. Not too much else on the nose.  T: Definitely better than a BMC, but in the same ballpark. I get some spices and metallic breadiness upfront with some nutmeg and cinnamon quickly following. Very watery on the backend.  M: Light body with a very well done carbonation feel. A clean and crisp finish.  D: Goes down very easy which is a testament to the 5.2% ABV and wateriness to the brew.  All in all, this is a great beer for a social gathering with BMC friends. They will definitely enjoy it. A good pounder at a party. For people, like the BA community, who look for more to their beer than a ""pounder"", then this is not for you. You might enjoy if you like session brews or if you're looking for a BMC conversion brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Coloring is a little pale in comparison to other Ambers. The beer has subtle hops aromas on the nose, blended with nut and earth. The taste is very rounded, with hints of chocolate, nut, and light hops on a roasted malt foundation. Very bold and smooth in mouth, with a pleasant aftertaste of light hops and a hint of sour. Smooth, clean finish. Very easy to drink.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

No sign of hops other than a lack of sweetness/slight bitterness in the background. M: Crisp, slightly dry, medium level of carbonation. D: This is a perfectly good beer for what it is, i.e. a simple everyday drinker. I have never understood the ""love"" for this beer, it is good, but not great.

192,607,Guitarctica,3.58,"I first heard of this beer from a friend. Apparently it wasn't availabe in Georgia until recently (2009). It happened to be the ""beer of the month"" at the bar my wife works at so I got a pint on tap. I got a free Fat Tire glass too!  A - It arrived to me with one finger of white head that quickly dissipated. It was a translucent amber that wasn't completely clear. Had decent lacing on the glass.  S - Not much smell to it at all. I was struggling to pick out what I did which was some hops and citrus notes  T - I could taste malts though not the roasted kind, I did detect some ""earthiness"". There was some sweetness from the wheat and it finished with a hop bitterness.  M - Light body and very smooth. The finish was fairly dry from the hops.  D - Insane drinkability. The taste is pretty good and the smoothness will keep you coming back for more.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Andreji,4.12,"Again I have to credit good friend, colleague and fellow beer enthusiast Rafael Bernal for this fantastic gift. I held back from trying it for a few days- my plan was new year's but then i fell asleep- so I popped it today as an ode to my (oh so happy) 1 week vacation.  I like this beer from all perspectives. The pour looks good, a cristal orange hue with a fantastic, tall white head and tonnes of lacing. some fizz within, not too much though.  While the smell doesn't fill the room or is abundant in any way, it is indeed its most complex and intriguing attribute. it morphs somewhat and makes you have to process it for a while. At first it was a dominant cumin like feel, very spicy. maybe even a pure cacao (the non-sweet, 100% pure type). Then again, you go smell it again and it feels like some caramel, some fruitier notes. indeed, complex.  The taste is also very good. It is soft, much unlike what i expected for the beer, but it holds all things good about american beer- a caramel-hop duo, very soft and refreshing, blending and complementing a complex smell. it is very light but by all means tasty. and in spite of a low abv, it has a perceibable boozy undertone that is only complimentary to the whole deal.  Indeed very drinkable, very enjoyable year round. can't wait to get my hands on more New Belgium.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ADZA,3.45,"This is my first sampling from this brewery and looking forward to it and on pouring im quite suprised at how light looking it is for an Amber/red ale its a very light golden bronze hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that recedes to just a big rim of lacing,the aromas are maple syrup firstly followed by a background of honey coated caramel,the mouthfeel is only average and is definately light bodied with nice carbonation on mouthfeel and the first taste i get is toasty roasted malts nicely balanced by a dash of citrus and mango mid taste and rounded out with a tinge of sticky maple syrup and followed by a sour boiled candy bittersweetness,and overall for my first sample from this brewery i was definately hoping for more and there are alot better American AA/RA's here in Perth to try before this one,but as they say dont knock it till you try it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,alkemy,3.67,"This pours a crystal clear, slightly light amber color. The fluffy head is just short of being white and didn't stick around too long. Aroma is quite pleasant presenting as a combination of caramel, nuttiness, biscuit, and a grassy funk. The taste is pretty bready right off the bat. There's some toasty malts and then the grassy funk apparent in the smell appears. Finish is a bit on the grainy side. It doesn't look like it in the glass, but explodes with carbonation once it hits your mouth. I do like the feel of this. I had this a long time ago, in my pre-BA years, and seem to recall being more enthusiastic. Still, it's a good tasting beer that would appeal to a large audience.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,StoutHunter,4.03,"My parents brought me this six pack back from a trip down south, I have never had anything from New Belgium before so lets give it a go. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.  A- This beer poured a nice light amber color with three fingers worth of thick white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed the rest of the time, there is also some nice lacing.  S- Typical amber aroma with the caramel malts sticking out the most with some grassy hops at the end.  T- Pretty similar to the smell but more bready and biscuity. There's a good balance of earthy hops on the finish that helps level out the tons of breadyness that comes from the malts.  M- Medium bodied and good carbonation.  D- This beer makes a good session amber. The combination of low alcohol and good flavors make this beer pretty drinkable. Three or four of these would hit the spot.  Overall I thought this was a nice amber ale and I am glad I tried it. Too bad I have never seen this at any of the local stores. This beer was a good first impression for New Belgium, I look forward to trying more of their brews.  Edit- I had a couple of really fresh bottles that were just a little better so I adjusted the score and gave the aroma a 4 instead of 3.5, this is a good an unique beer that I always try and get when out of state.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,sizzlemc,3.54,"This is pretty much my go-to beer when on-tap at a bar, since it's better quality beer than BMC.  Appearance - I like the darkish amber color of this beer. In my experience when drinking this on tap it always has a very good head retention and decent lacing as well. In a bottle the head retention is significantly diminished.  Smell - Your average beer smell in my opinion. Guess I could compliment that there is nothing off-putting about the smell.  Taste - Pretty wheaty taste really. Like I'm munching on hay. Not that this is necessarily bad. The favor is just really consistent and nothing really shines.  Mouthfeel - Pretty good body, a little dry, and decent carbonation.  Drinkabilty - Very drinkable from the tap I'd say. I drink a couple pints on occasion.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Biscuits.  T- Follows the smell. Bready.  M- Mouthfeel is a tad on the watery side.  D/O- Drinkability is out of this world. Goes down like a common BMC, only with some (decent) flavor to back it up.

Light floral and slightly citrusy hops. Very light, fruity esters, and just a hint of tartness (almost cherry-like). No flaws, but not overwhelming.  Flavor-Toasty and biscuity malt. Moderately low floral hop flavors, and low hop bitterness. Similar to the aroma, there is some light, tart fruit flavors (like cherries or pears) and some light funk. Certainly not bad, but not something I'm dying to drink.  Mouthfeel-Medium body, medium carbonation. Smooth, but lingers on the tongue and sides of mouth in a somwhat strange way.

Being from Michigan I am not afforded the same priveledge of tasting this beer on tap, rather I visit family in Chicago and buy the beer in bottles. Yet, the beer itself is quite remarkable. The hoppy flavor that it claims to have is recognizable yet subtle enough to keep from detracting from the flavors that it boasts. It is far less malty than some abmbers I have tried but I feel that helps more than hurts the brew. Fat tire still retains a bright robust flavor and is apparent in both the front and the back of the beer.

I guess that's what limited distribution can do for a brand.  Anyhow, while in Colorado (where this is on tap at seemingly every bar) I knocked back a few Fat Tires. Overall, I think it's an interesting beer. It has a very bready and biscuity aroma and flavor. Some definite caramel malt sweetness and minimal hop flavor or aroma.  It's a unique and different flavor from many other amber ales out there. I'm not sure if it is the malt makeup or the yeast strain, but there is something unique here.

Leans heavily to the malty side of things - it does get a bit tiring after about a half of a glass.  M. Good mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.  D. Goes down easy enough given its moderate ABV.

Sweet and biscuity. Light fresh hops  T: Follows the nose: Very bready and biscuity (this is the most biscuity beer I've ever had). However not sweet as the smell (fortunately).

It pours a deep amber color that makes one know there will be a fine maltiness to the brew. The smell is not the best for a beer of this quality and gives off a note of roasted malt that overcomes all the other aromas. Not even entirely sure where it comes from. The taste though, is what got me hooked. I never expected this beer to be as big as it was.

The taste is so malty and creamy that these flavors remain consistent throughout anything you taste afterwards. There is a distinct sweet aftertaste, pretty much candy, inside of that friggin' bouncy castle, inside of that bottle. Overall, all your worries come back at the bottom of the glass. This is easily one of the most adaptable beers out there.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Smell - Sweet caramel malt in the nose. Picking up a decent bready, biscuit aroma. Some sweet fruitiness of some kind. Not sure what.  Taste - Sweet caramel comes through at first with the taste. The bread and biscuit follows nicely. Again, getting some type of fruitiness. Peach or something. Really sweet!!!  Mouthfeel - Medium to thin mouthfeel. Mostly dry. Smooth. A little bit left on the palate.  Drinkability - This beer is pretty good with a meal. It might be a bit too sweet for some to drink all night.

Two-fingered head that seems to be dissipating fairly quickly, leaving minimal lacing.  Almost no hops to speak of. Malty undertones. Fairly plain, all things considered.  I think this beer is pretty overrated. I hate to say that, and I really do like almost all of New Belgium's offerings. This style of beer just isn't for me.  Whatever.

It pours a clear pale copper topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, ruby red grapefruit, lemon zest, coriander, and a stiff toffee backbone. The taste brings the toffee to the fore, subduing the fruity notes in the process. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a nice amber, nothing close to special, but eminently drinkable and more than enjoyable enough.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Carbonation is higher, as many lighter ales tend to be. Feels a little watery for my tastes.  D- Not the worst beer I've ever had. For a ""craft"" beer, I expected more flavor and less of a watery feel. Past that, it's decent, and if you can find it cheap, pick it up.

Smell - Lots of earthy smells going on but is balanced out fine by the hops. This beer has an earthy quality to it. Im picking up fresh bread, some grapefruit and a pine finish. Very pleasing, smells clean.  Taste - The bread is just as strong in the taste as in the smell. The malts give it a grainy taste which is followed by citric hops finish and after taste. Fairly simple tastes in this beer.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied, nice carbonation that tickles the palate. It has a very clean mouthfeel.  This beer is highly drinkable.

I'm still not sure why they don't sell to Pennsylvania yet, but hopefully some day.  The beer pours a crystal clear light copper color with one finger creamy white head. The aroma is simple yet pleasing. Lightly toasted grains are the first thing that come to mind and following that there is sweet malt and hints of fruit. The flavor shows off those lightly toasted malts from the aroma with an earthy bready character. There is a sweetness I can't really place, but solid earthy hops round out the flavor. The body is light with decent carbonation.  Overall this is a very solid beer. It's not ground breaking or anything along those lines, but it is a solid amber ale. On the side of the bottle there was mention that this was originally thought up on a biking trip, and I can see that. The flavor is very earthy and solid and would fit along those lines well.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,wmtxbb,3.47,"Bottle poured into pint glass  Appearance: Amber with a light amount of lacing. Nothing too impressive  Smell: Bread, sort of like peanut butter and jelly bread. Nice sweet malt smell.  Taste: has a light body and subtle taste thats complex. bagels and sesame seeds. Nice zing from the alcohol. The hops are present throughout the tasting but especially present at the end. Hops are not citrus like but spicy. Light amber profile. This beer is missing some of the malt presence that I'd expect from an amber beer. I think New Belgium did this to give a lighter crisper tasting beer. After a second taste I think it almost tastes a little like dog food. Now that I've thought that I really can't get this dog food flavor out of my mind every time I drink the beer.  Drinkability: High if you're looking for a decent session beer. Not my kind of beer though. I'd prefer something a little more in terms of malt, hops, and flavor.

Nice and malty with a dark whole wheat aroma. A small bit of hops are there as well.  Taste is of the same. Like a whole wheat bagel mixed with some hops in a glass. Some describe it as biscuity, I say bagely.  Not too bad in the mouth. No peppery feeling at all. A little full initially then it fades to being a teeny bit watery at the end.

192,607,FrozenJoe,3.42,"Appearance: This is a beautiful looking beer. Unique bottle. It pours a copper / amber color. Tall thick head. Nice lacing. This is what beer should look like.  Smell: Light malty aroma, described on the label and by many reviewers as biscuit-like. I see where they're coming from, but don't totally agree. What I smell is a watery maltiness. It does not smell like the rich buttery aroma I would expect from biscuits. There is a slight graininess to the aroma. Is this an all-malted barley brew? Very light hops fruitiness.  Taste: Malts dominate. Slight graininess. Very light hops. Some bitterness but no fruity hops complexity. Where is the hops character to this beer? Expected more. Watery. The brewers seem to be aiming for balance. In a way they achieve it, but this is by no means an awe-inspiring beer. Better than a macro, but not a great tasting beer.  Mouthfeel: Nice. Thick. Well carbonated. Good mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Good. Easy to drink. Goes down smooth. Easy to throw back several of these. A nice alternative to a macro for a bbq setting.  Overall: I have to admit, I'm disappointed with this beer. I expected more. After the beautiful pour and look to this beer it was downhill from there. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer. Clearly it's made with a higher standard of quality than a macro. But for the price you can do better.

Leaves light lacing down the glass as it is drunk.  S - Biscuity, with a bit of caramel as it warms up. A touch of earthy hops on the back end.  T - Meh. A flat taste of maltiness that delivers on the biscuit aroma. Not much of a hop balance to it, and a bit cloying.  M - About what I'd expect from the style, the carbonation is pleasant, and the body is fairly balanced.  D - Pretty drinkable if it weren't for the lack of balance. I could throw a few of these back, but the slight cloying character of the beer would wear on me with each serving.  Overall, not too much to write home about.

Taste: Maltier than the smell suggested, and thankfully so. Early, bready, malt flavor, with a distinct earthy undercurrent.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with better than average carbonation. Starts strong and finishes stronger, a little thin in between. Clean malt aftertaste.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink.

192,607,GabrielM,4.3,"I've had this many, many times, but never out of a can, so I thought I'd give it a review. Poured into a pint glass.  A - great amber color with nice head and retention. The sight of this beer reminds me of fall, which is just around the corner.  S - combination of malt and hops, some fruit, maybe apricots or cherries, and a very slight bit of alcohol perhaps.  T - on the front are the hops, a tad dry and bitter, but then comes some sweet malt, fruit, bread, and caramel. Finishes very smoothly, not too dry or sweet, but just right.  M - good carbonation, nice balance of flavors, but a little liter than expected when compared to the bottle (which is what I've grown used to).  D - very smooth, not filling, and at a sessionable ABV. As mentioned above, it's liter than I'm used to, but I actually think I prefer this brew out of a can. Will definitely buy again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,lstokes,3.33,"This was orange with a light tan head, and the smell is sickly sweet malts with maybe a bit of citrus.  I similarly found the taste too sweet for my palate--it's like a malt bomb or something, with biscuity and caramel sweetness and then just a hint of floral hops around the edges, finishing sweet and not that clean. Isn't so much focus on the malts off-style for an American Amber? I also felt the mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side and under-carbonated, and am a little bit confused as to why this has become a cult beer. I will be drinking it again, as it's a step up from anything else at my new local bar, but still, I'm a bit disappointed overall.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,JMad,3.98,"Had this one on draft at Red Hot and Blue... Poured into a mini pitcher, the color was copper-amber, nice white head that left good lacing. Smells of caramel malt, buttered toast and a hint of apricot. Tastes bready and buttery, sweet malt. Feels light-medium and is very soft and smooth. I could have a nice session with this brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Scent is sweet from the start with carmel and brown sugar notes, even some cotton candy, a earthy english hop presences with hints of pine and citrus. Starts of sweet with light toffee notes and again a hint of cotton candy, nice hop profile with earthy and floral hops on top of pine and citrus. Medium bodied, highly carbonated, sweet aftertaste. A decent beer with some carbonation issues and a sweetness that borders on too much at times.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,AlCaponeJunior,2.88,"Amber with a decent head and fair lacing. Mostly clear.  Smells slightly grainy with some malt and sweet notes.  Tastes OK. More like an ESB to me... there's that something of a taste I can't quite put my finger on, but it's overly pungent. Caramel malts are very dominating. A little bit of sweet.  Feels pretty good, medium bodied and well carbonated.  There are far better and more drinkable beers from this brewer. I doubt I'll buy this one again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Plokhooy,4.43,"New Belgium's flagship brew is the best American Amber on the market today (at these of those that are somewhat mass marketed). This beer mixes a great craft flavor with a drinkability not often seen with beers of this complex flavor. Much better on tap than in the bottle, but either way is still an enjoyable experience.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,sogrady,2.86,"When I moved out to Colorado a little less than ten years ago, Fat Tire was all the rage. I'm not sure if it was because New Belgium was early to market or because New Belgium, but either way it's not The Beer out west anymore, it's just one among many. Albeit a popular one.  The color is the most impressive thing about the beer, as it's a deep ruby color with admirable clarity. Unfortunately, the taste doesn't live up to the presentation, as the beer is to my taste overly malty with an aftertaste of slightly charred wood.  To be fair, ambers are not generally my favorite beer, but even making allowances for that fact, it's relatively pedestrian in my view.  Not awful, and certainly drinkable, but undistinguished in a landscape that is far more competitive than when the line launched .",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

My perception is that this thing is overrated  A-really nice light copper color, off white head, not much carbonation, head dissipates pretty quick  S-sweet, malty, a little apple fruitiness  T-really sweet, malty, definitely a rich sweetness like a caramel or toffee, but just overpowering for my taste, it's not just the overbalance of maltiness but I feel like the flavor is kind of one dimensional, this is one beer that I actually feel like is on draft in an overabundance and right now I'm thinking I do prefer the bottle variety,  M-good mouthfeel and the overall lingering effect on the palate are good, it feels more balanced until i take another sip  D-this is a tough one because I regularly encounter this on tap everywhere and I have to lean towards the negative, there are many circumstances where I give this another try and then have to settle on something else",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RickS95,3.32,"Pours amber as you'd guess with little head. The head doesn't last long, but there is immediate lacing. The beer is light enough that you can see right through it.  Doesn't have a lot of smell. There are some biscuity notes and kind of a peppery-flowery smell, but that's about it.  The flavors are subtle, but enjoyable. I couldn't identify anything in particular, but there was a malty sweetness before the peppery bite took over.  There's some complexity. It's medium-bodied so there's some feeling to it. Like I mentioned, there's sweetness early before giving way to a bittering finish, but all along it's somewhat spicy.  This beer has a lot of different things going on and that makes for an interesting drink. It's got moderate alcohol, a crispness with the carbonation, and is neither light nor heavy, making for a nicely drinkable brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,NWer,2.18,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Pilsner glass.  Quite frankly, I don't know what all the fuss is about. Very bland beer, totally pedestrian.

S - Toasted malt with some caramel hints dominate the nose. A touch of grass and herbal hops are also present. Some grain and sweet aromas as well.  T - Follows the nose with toasted, caramel malt dominating the taste. Some sweet biscuit flavors in the background. Hints of herbal, grassy and earthy hops mid sip. Finishes with a slight mineral taste as well.  M - Lighter side of medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty creamy and smooth.  D - Easy to drink beer that benefits from a smooth and creamy body. Flavors are easy to drink and nice, especially on a hot day, but nothing to write home about.  Notes: About and average beer. Nice body with a creamy feel. Toasted, caramel and sweeter malt are dominate. Touch of hops is nice, but not enough to really spice it up.

T: Malty, bready, some caramel and fruit, just a tinge of hoppiness, clean and creamy finish with minimal hop bitterness.  M: Creamy, light, not too much carbonation, just right.  D: Incredibly drinkable.  This beer is a good one. It's readily available unlike most of the microbrews that I love so it's one that I come back to on a regular basis, and that's not a bad thing.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,JordanEllwanger,3.75,A nice amber tone with a lot of transparency and a half inch cream white head. Smells of hops first hit the nose almost as much as an IPA. A much more malty taste yet still toned by the hops. Almost in the realm of a Belgian double. The feel could be less biting. A very drinkable beer that tastes more than it should.

Doesn't smell bad, just not enough aroma to go around. T: The first thing I noticed is the maltiness of this brew. This beer leans on the malty side and could probably use a little more hops to balance it out. M: Good mouthfeel. Smooth, creamy, and goes down easy. A slighty crisp finish. D: Easy to drink.

A: A light, coppery amber color with a good deal of carbonation which builds to a two-finger head of creamy, rocky, white foam. Retention is very good and lacing is nice.  S: Good, fruity malt aroma with hints of toasted biscuit and light, grassy, citrusy hops.  T: Clean, crisp and creamy malt flavor up front. Throws flavors of lightly toasted caramel malts and fruity ale notes. Light hopping adds just a bit of dry graininess to the brew and serves more of a balancing purpose. Clean and slightly creamy malt finish with minimal lingering bitterness.  M: Light-medium bodied with a crisp, yet creamy mouthfeel. Not a lot to get in the way, but very good feel overall for a lighter ale.  D: Not the most flavorful ale on the planet, but so well-balanced and simplistic that it would make a great choice for almost any occasion as a brew to sip all day long, and at 5.2% ABV this is easily accomplished, or share with the uninitiated beer drinker.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S - Smell is of bready/biscuity malts, with nutty and fruit-like notes. Not too much in the way of hop presence.  T - Taste is of roasted, biscuity/nutty malts, with some dark-ish fruits. On the maltier side, but has enough hop character to keep things well balanced. Nothing too out of the ordinary here, but it's very well done.  M - Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Goes down very smooth though.  D - A great amber ale to session, a couple of these hit the spot perfectly.

Appearance- Perhaps it was the fact that the people I was drinking this with had stellas, but the deep amber color of the beer and nice head really looked fantastic.  Smell- The maltiness takes the day on this one. Smells of rich caramel and bread.  Taste- Follows the smell quite nicely, some fairly big malt flavors. It has a nuttiness to it, as well as a distinctive breadiness to it. It reminded me of a loaf of multi-grain bread. It's a fairly basic, non flashy ale, but it's definitely well done.

A half a finger of head leaves residual lacing behind in scatter locales.  S: The amber ale has a soothing bready malt aroma, mild yet firm. Nuttiness and soft fruit flavors match the breads.  T: A very plain ale, bready malts, crisp carbonation and a dash of hops provides everything that the ale needs. The bready malts, caramel and pale, have a calming flavor, a relaxed ale to sip on. The carbonation works in contrast, lively and vigorous. Hoppiness, a small kiss of earthiness, is minimal but not a necessity. A nice, neutral ale to pair with a spicy cheesesteak.

A bit of a leafy greens flavour lingers on the tongue as well.  M - Light and bubbly. Nothing offensive here.  D - Because the flavours are lighter, this one is easily poundable, and non-offensive.

Primarily smells of sweet malts and hops, with a little bit of spiciness, and a slight hint of honey.  Has a very sweet, bready flavor, with hints of malts and caramel. The finish has just the slightest bit of spice to it, and a touch of hoppy bitterness that lingers on the palate.  Light medium in body. It could have used a little more carbonation; as it stands, it felt a little flat. But other than that it was very smooth and left just the right amount of dryness on the tongue.  For a beer that feels as light as this does, it's surprisingly heavy. About half-way through pint number two you really start to feel it.

A fairly hop forward amber that tips back to pale malts and a rather odd flavor not unlike rubber. A crisp mouthfeel with light bittering and finish.  I swear it really does smell like tire air. Perhaps that's where they got the name or it's just a subliminal hint applied to an odd odor and taste I detected in this beer.

Taste - exceptional flavor, great tasting beer. Spices work together well. Bisquity hopes and toasty malt flavorings pair very nicely. Truly a great recipe and one to follow. NB's flagship beer indeed.  mouthfeel - exceptional. worked well on the palette and left a dry mustiness that had me wanting more.

Pored from a bottle into a pint glass after letting it sit in the freezer for 20 minutes. Once the head settles theres a thin tan lacing that lasts for the duration.  The taste threw me off the first time I tried it. The second time I came to it I was a little more mature. After tastes a little sharp when chilled too much, after letting the room temp warm it up it transforms into probably my favorite beer yet. The taste resembles some sort of sugar with a strong aftertaste.

On the East coast, my friends had heard of it, but not tried it, so I brought a case out, iced it down, and let the tastings begin.  This is a very good ""starter"" Belgian Ale. . . not for the Bud Light crowd. . . it requires patience and a somewhat developed palette at first if you're new to it.  The pros: not heavily carbonated, so you don't get a bite that covers the flavor. The flavor is a bit on the sweet side, and that can be a welcome thing compared to some of the thicker Belgians out there.  The cons: more than 2, and it starts getting heavy. . . but not a satisfying kind of ""WOW"". . . just heavy, like, I can't have any more of that.  I understand this isn't a technical review. . . not how I function. . . but as someone else said, this is a good gateway beer into a new world outside the American mainstream beers, and will start your journey to some very interesting places!

A- Pours a copper brown color, crystal clear, with an almond color head, one finger thick and heavy. Head is firm but fades into a nice lace. Could use a bit more red to the color.  S- Strong caramel malt with a subtle noble hop flavor, but mostly malty caramel, almost overwhelmingly caramel.  T- Caramel malts with hints of prunes. The caramel malts are so strong that they overwhelm any other flavors.  M- Creamy and a little bready. Moderate carbonation. Smooth.  D- Highly drinkable. Not the greatest flavor palate, but it's a good brew, with a gigantic availability, and a good price. I can drink this any time, and more and more I find it available in bars that typically only carry BMC.

I will refrain from ordering this beer again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Shuffledaddy,3.95,"From tasting notes. This is a go-to beer for me as it's widely available where I live. Fat tire was also the first true ""craft beer"" I tried back in college.  A- Medium-amber, somewhat effervescent. Lacing is about finger-width with moderate retention.  S- Scents of honey, roasted malt, and biscuits. Pleasant but not overpowering.  T- Honey flavors are present in the front palate, transitioning to slightly citrusy hop bitterness. Finishes malty.  M- Medium-bodied, average mouthfeel. Nothing special but nothing detrimental either.  D- Very drinkable and balanced amber ale that pairs well with many foods. Easy to see why it's so popular.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,charlesbyrd,3.93,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a beer mug.  A: Pours a clear copper with a nice frothy off-white head that climbs over the rim of the glass. A constant stream of carbonation climbs from the base to the top of the glass.  S: Very balanced aroma. Caramel sweetness and grassy hop notes compliment each other well with a strong malty backbone.  T: Again, perfectly balanced. The attack is spicy and herbal, followed by more caramel notes. The finish is slightly bitter from the hops and goes well with the sweet and grassy body.  M: Crisp and bubbly. The body is just light enough, with a slightly dry finish.  D: I finally got to try this classic symbol of craft beer, and I wasn't disappointed. Balanced is the perfect word to describe this brew, it has all the right combinations of flavors. At the same time, it's simple and light enough for anyone to enjoy.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,gkunkle,3.98,"I heard this beer was supposed to be very good before i tried it for the first time. So i did have some expectations going into this and I feel Fat Tire met those expectations. Pours an amber color with a white head that leaves a little lacing. Smells of malts and caramel. To the taste, Fat tire is a bready with some caramel and its a little bitter. (just the right ammount of bitterness) It has a nice medium body that is sorta smooth. Overall, its an enjoyable beer to drink, one that is appreciated by many. To me, this is the beer that defines the category.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,JayQue,3.98,"Poured into a pint glass. Clear amber color with medium size white head. Good head retention and thick ladder-like lacing. The aroma is fairly mild, mostly sweet malts.  Taste is sweet bready malts with enough bitterness to cut the swetness- like a dopplebock lite.  Mouthfeel is rich and inviting. Drinkability is excellent. This would be a beer to seek out for sessions. Low abv and very tasty.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,DFN,2.38,"This is one of those beers with a reputation that exceeds its actual wonderfulness. It's not awful, but overall I found it unexceptional in every way.

Modest carbonation. Smelled of malt, nuts, and a hint of dark fruit. The taste was much more complex, beginning on a winey/apricot not, progressing to a malty/nutty mix, and then finishing sweet. Subtle carbonation; medium and smooth. Good session ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SassyBootblack,3.1,"On tap at a local dive bar.  Apperance - Amber color, came to the table with no head.  Smell - Don't remember.  Taste - It has a unique biscuity malt flavor that I've come to call the ""New Belgiun flavor,"" but not much else going on. Great for cold weather.  Mouthfeel - I think with the interesting biscuit flavor, it could benefit from more body. As it is, it's a little thin.  Drinkability - I may have problems with the thin body, but because of it, this stuff goes down easy.  I have fond memories of going to the New Belgium brewery and having a canner hand me a fresh can of this stuff. It's a classic and easy to find.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

In the aroma the hint of lemony hops and toffee meld well.  In the taste there is more of a tea and toffee taste than expected. This seems more of an English style pale ale, than an American Red Ale.  The mouth feel is light and crisp with mild carbonation. I'm glad I retried this beer, it seems to carry it's own weight; however, seems to be falsely categorized.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,dayswonder,4.7,"The beer pours nicely into a snifter glass with just about 2 fingers of slightly cream colored head.  The fragrance of the brew is filled with caramel notes that ends with the slightest scent of fruit.  This beer is highly touted, and in my opinion it lives up to the hype. The taste is bursting with buttery caramel notes, after ingested the exhale though the nose adds the biscuit flavor that ties it all together.  The exceptional tastes is accommodated by a medium mouthfeel.  Very drinkable, but since I can not get this beer in PA, I can only enjoy this beer sparingly.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,aeminter,4.18,"A - Clear and a nice copper color with a persistent off-white head S - No noticeable hop pretense...bready, cereal malt...very mild esters T/M - Flavors match well with the aromas. A nice malt sweetness on the bready/cereal side. Hops aren't a predominant player outside the balance they provide. Carbonation is moderate and pleasant.  This is a very lovely beer, not just for the solid craftsmanship but also for being one of my gateway beers.

192,607,biboergosum,3.63,"12oz, distinctively collared bottle, another ubiquitous American craft brew, unseen as yet in Canadian liquor stores. My friend in Chicago always had a fridge full of this stuff when I would go visit, a few years ago.  This beer pours a clear, medium copper amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, frothy, and lightly foamy off-white head, which leaves a decent paint job of sudsy, streaky lace around the glass as it slowly ebbs away.  It smells of mildly toasty, biscuity, and bready pale malt, a touch of dry nutty caramel, and fruity, floral, and slightly piney hops. The taste is more staunchly bready malt, one fading in its interesting biscuity and roasted nature, with a wet ashy essence that strangely rises to the roof of my mouth, and some agreeably balancing earthy, herbal hops.  The carbonation is moderate, manifesting in but a trilling frothiness, the body medium-light in weight, and perhaps a tad dusty in its otherwise well-rendered smoothness. It finishes off-dry, sure, but tempered just enough by the lingering earthy, weedy, and musty hops.  A good and venerable American session ale, I would imagine, if the toasted biscuit character didn't quite challenge the palate on each re-up, and thus become unwelcome after a few rounds. As training beer for those moving out of their particular version of BMC hell, you could do a lot worse, and I see why I enjoyed those cold ones from the fridge in aforementioned Chi-town, after all that not-so-cheap Budweiser at Lollapalooza in Grant Park, and watered-down (wait, what?) Schlitz at Wrigley Field.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,HosP,3.77,This was my first non-macro brew I ever had a few years back in Vegas. Some co-workers enlightened me on good beer and I haven't looked back since. Store had 6 packs on sale and couldn't pass it up!  A: Clear Amber color. Not a lot of head to it. Lots of carbonation.  S: Taste is more subtle with good blend of hops and malts. Neither really jump out and overwhelm the other. Caramel malts are tasted more and more as I went through the bottles.  M: Medium body. Very crisp and to the point beer.  D: No problems drinking all 6 before the night was close to being over.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Brenden,3.95,"Since I was in Asheville, and I'd tried in on tap, and I have to go a ways outside of Toledo to get this (which is weird), I decided to try it from the bottle while I'm here. This is a copy-and-paste of my earlier on-tap review with the necessary revisions.  The color is a deep, clear copper. Unlike the tap, the head was sturdy and fairly thick, leaving patchy lacing behind. The smell is pleasant and, while not extremely strong, pretty fragrant. There's a nice hops and malts balance with grains and a hint of fruits with a sweetness underlying. The flavor is a mix of floral, biscuity, sweet and gently bitter. It's very easy to drink and I think it bridges the gap nicely between the weak, weakly flavorful beers and the palate-pounding monsters. There's a light carbonation and the body is on the light side of medium. This one's very sessionable and an all-around solid amber.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Pours a clear, golden honey color, with a lot of carbonation, white foamy head.  smells of sweet rich malts, and subtle grassy hops. nice.  taste is very good.

T: Tastes of sweet roasted malts, more toasted biscuit-y malts, a small amount of caramel and vanilla thrown in at the end. M: Creamy, perfect amount of carbonation, lighter bodied than it looks.

Aroma: Musty, with a hard biscuity malt and subdued floral notes.  Taste: It's characterized by mild bready, biscuity malts that leave a cigar-smoke oaky haze in the back of my throat. A flash of hops leaves a juicy bitterness on the tip of the tongue mid-sip. Finishes dry and toasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with an even feel. Moderate carbonation.

I really enjoyed the taste, a unique twist on an amber, sort of toasty/biscuity with a hint of medium dark fruity-ness. Reminds me of some Belgian Dubbel Ales, without to much character from the yeast.  Enjoyable? Why yes, I do believe so. Unique? Why yes I would agree. Rites of Passage for all beer lovers? Not necessarily... Worth a try? Why yes of course. Hype worthy? Sure possibly so depending where you live. I like NB, and I think this is a nice flagship offering, especially since it is so widely accessible, just not in my area.  I need to revisit this review? Why yes, yes I do.

Its popularity is surprising.  A-Light amber hue, too light for style. Pour produced about a 1 1/2 finger heard that left only scant lacing.  S-Almost like cheap macro beer. Very faint pale and caramel malts, but virtually nothing in the nose from hops that I could discern.  T-Nondescript like everything else about this beer. It tasted much more like an APA. Probably contributes to its popularity. A light tasting beer that is better than anything from BMC.  M-A bit harsh from too much carbonation.  D-Pass. There are many, thankfully, better beers in this and other styles available for a similar price.  Good marketing doth not a great beer make.

Quite sweet and biscuity without too much in the way of hops. The caramel note borders on being buttery, but isn't quite there.  T: Essentially the same qualities that are present in the nose manifest themselves here in the flavor. A solid biscuit and toasted malt base with a pleasant caramel sweetness and creaminess.  M: The body is medium with moderate carbonation.  D: While this isn't my favorite beer, I do not quite understand the ""hate"" toward it. It's certainly an easy drinking beer and one that is a good ""beginner"" craft offering.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,DioS,3.5,"Amber color with a smooth rather inactive but persistent decent looking foam. Smell is not strong, slightly fruity and like lightly roasted malt. The taste is quite unique, like cookie. I suppose this would be one of my first strongly biscuity beers. I was reminded of the Givenchy Pi cologne with its ability to evoke this warm, appetizing cookie flavor where there's no cookie in sight. I find this beer quite easy drinking, but the unique flavor makes it an option only when I specifically want something like this.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,movingtrain,3.74,"12 ounce bottle sampled from a Duvel glass.  Pours a nice amber color, but with very little head. Even with the Duvel glass agitation, not much is happening up top.  The aroma is nice and malty...caramel notes, hazelnut, roasted apple, wet grains, cereal, oats, and hints of honey and vanilla.  Heavy malt notes up front, followed by a creamy sweetness. There is a dry bitter bite up front, as well. Some caramel notes, crusty bread, oats, some spice, and a light hop backbone.  This is a nice, refreshing beer. The taste is average, nothing super outstanding, but no bad notes to speak of. Fat Tire is drinkable with a nice effervescent mouthfeel and summer-sweet aroma.

192,607,bobsy,3.18,"Bottle courtesy of TJ - thanks man! Frankly, I didn't have high expectations of this one and didn't crack it until I needed some beer to go in a stew. I drank it for a while and added the rest to my dish.  Pours a rich amber with strong red highlights and an off-white head that left some slippery lace as it dropped to a thin film. Fairly standard appearance for the style. Strong toasty aroma, with lots of biscuit and a splash of caramel. Light acidity and maybe a hint of citrus. I prefer my ambers to be hopier than this, but as this is supposed to be Belgian-influenced I'm happy to cut it some slack. Flavour-wise this isn't going to make you stop what you're doing and let out a whoop of joy. It's a decent, easy-drinking beer, but it's a little flat and a little plain. If it were a bike ride it would be going down a country lane with endlessly flat farmland on either side. Pleasant, but without any real point of interest. Toasty biscuit dominates, with a touch of brown sugar in the middle, and that nagging acidity turning up in the finish where I hoped the hops would be. The medium-light mouthfeel makes this drinkable, but again does not mark this out as anything special.  Accessible and without any real defects, but also void of any real interest. The sort of beer that would be a gentle intro for non-craft drinkers, and would probably work well up at the cottage. Hard to believe that the same brewery also makes La Folie.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Whether the climate is hot, cold, or mild, the perfect balance of Fattie on tap is heavily drinkable.

Taste - get some bready character upfront followed by just a bit of crystal malt sweetness but not too much. Not any hop bitterness from this one. Finishes in the sweet side.  Mouthful is on the thin side of medium and nicely carbed.  Overall, this is a great, easy drinkin', beer! One I could consume copious amounts of on a warm day at a bbq, taking in a game or just playing poker.

The taste follows the nose fairly well. Not much going on, but it is pretty easy-going.  In the mouth it feels exactly like a soft drink. I'm still undecided, even after a few days since my notes, if this is a good thing.  Ok, I get it. It's a good introductory beer. They aren't really doing anything wrong.

Honey, burnt biscuits, bubble gum, rye. Still unique and good.  Tastes: like biscuits. A properly subdued sweetness balances with a good grainy character and some subtle roastiness. Uncomplicated yet solid.  Feels: aqueous. A watery body, plus some very high carbonation combine to result in a rather average mouthfeel.  Drinks: like sensibility.

Medium bodied with a subtle dry hop presence up front that provides nice balance to the sweet toasty malt notes.

There is a swwet caramel aroma with a bit of an agressive hay quality. There is also a faint hop aroma in the background.  The taste is fine. A light hop presence adds a bit of bitterness to the beer. The beer is a bit more malt forward though. There's a nice dose of caramel and again I get a hay like character.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little on the flat side. It's kind of dull and lifeless.  Drinkability is fairly high. The ABV is relatively low making it a more sessionable beer. The flavor profile is unique but not overly impressive.

The body was a clear amber and a small white head of tight bubbles sat on top of each cup, it looked good, even in toothbrush cups.  The aroma was malt, with hints of hops if you sniffed long and hard enough.  The taste was malt with less hops than I remember the draught version giving me, or was I mistaken?

Now days , in my 40's , I go for taste first ( still don't mind the effect ) but now days with all the new taxes levied against our beloved suds , I can't always opt for a higher priced beer. I do like to venture out a couple times a month and try something new ( to me ) especially if someone recommended it , and a radio DJ here in the Charlotte area recommended FAT TIRE to me on the air.I finally found some , and I have to say I am glad he did .

A- Clear amber orange, small white head. S- Biscuity malt, light hoppiness. T- Lightly sweet, biscuity malt followed by a slight hop bitterness.

Some malty sweetness, but not much in the way of hints or notes of other stuff except a little bit of grainy husk at the end. Nope. Just lots of well rounded toasty biscuit.

A mildly sweet and toasty, almost creamy malt center is washed away by a moderate amount of floral bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation.

192,607,zoso493,2.76,"Ah, so here is the infamous Fat Tire, the beer that the non-craft drinker will open while proudly proclaiming that they are drinking ""good beer."" Let's see how accurate that assessment is. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a rather odd-looking orange-amber color that is quite atypical for an American amber ale. There's very little haze to it, and atop the beer is a very thin one-finger head that dissipates quikcly, leaving some trace lacing as it subsides.  Smell: I'm hyperventilating trying to find something to smell in this beer, but I'm coming up almost empty. There is the faintest scent of toasted malt with just a hint of orange peel complementing the malts. I can pick out no hops in the smell, which is ominously suspect for and amber ale.  Taste: The taste is equally as bland as the smell would indicate. There is some very, very, very light toasted malt followed by a slight hop bitterness to finish, but that's about it. I'm very unimpressed.  Mouthfeel: Fat Tire is beyond thin in the mouthfeel department. The beer just disappears into your stomach as soon as it enters your mouth. This does make it pretty drinkable and fairly refreshing, though.  Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable beer, as it goes down very easily and is pretty light on the flavoring.  Overall, this is a very mediocre beer, in my opinion. I can say that after having tried it, it is unequivocally not what I would call a ""good beer"" but is a beer worth trying. I've never been impressed with New Belgium, and Fat Tire has only served to further solidify my opinion about them. I don't have any empirical evidence to support this statement, but I would venture to say that is the most purchased craft beer in the United States.

(Much bigger on my second pour.) Good lacing, good retention, very clear orange body. Multiple streamers of carbonation all along the glass. Very attractive.  S: Strong biscuity malt character. Bready, doughy. Sweet malts. Caramel notes. Grainy. Heavy toasted toffee aromas and flavors. Hops are in the background, (probably due to the bottle's age) but who says all amber ales need to be hop forward? The aroma was pretty solid nonetheless. maybe drinking this beer at the end of the 'best before' date was a happy mistake.  T: Taste follows nose. Hints of peanuts and marcona almonds. Slightly lacking in complexity, depth of flavor and any kind of intensity for that matter. Well balanced, I guess, in that sense. Much more malty than hoppy.

Slight off note perceptible to some degree, but overlooked in everyday drinking. This is a drinkin' beer, not a sippin' beer.  Medium to fuller in body, carbonation is a bit high. Nice clean flavors, very palatable, easily sessionable. Nice amber ale without pretentiousness. I've heard of people being ""disappointed"" with this beer, but as far as ambers go this is a good one.

Not sure what it is, but the malt taste does not taste that great to me.  m - Light body with a good amount of carbonation.  d - Overall the smell and flavor of this beer did not appeal to me too much.

Smells very malty with something slightly metallic that is a bit off-putting.  Just like the smell, the flavor is very malt-driven, slightly earthy like a lot of other beers from New Belgium. Pretty standard for an amber ale, though I wish it had more discernible hops.  Fairly light bodied for the style, but I think that makes it go better with a lot of foods (especially pizza!). Right amount of carbonation at first, but it tends to dissipate quickly leaving you wanting more. Leaves something of an oily feeling on the palate, not really good or bad, but noteworthy.

Light to medium-bodied brew with a high amount of carbonation. Finishes clean without any aftertaste at all.  Smooth flavor makes it quite drinkable. When I first tried this beer about a year ago I wasn't a fan. It's funny how tastes change because now I don't think its that bad. Has some interesting flavors which are different but could be blended a little better. A decent refreshing brew, somewhat overpriced though.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,theopholis,3.7,"Apperance- The body is anorange-amber color that effervesces for a while. The head is fluffy and white and leaves a decent lacing.  Smell- Bisquets. Lots and lots of bisquet smell. Yummy. A fair amount of toastiness comes through also.  Taste- Starts out with a dry, sweet and toasty malt up front. Some bittering hops in the middle (not a lot), and finishes with a very nice toastiness.  Mouthfeel- medium body. Carbonation accentuates the toastiness and hop flavors. finishes off-dry.  Drinkability- Doesn't really fit any style. That's New Belgium's shtick. Just make good beer and to hell with the style guidelines. Having said that, I reccomend at least trying this stuff. It's a great beer to give to people who are starting to tire of American macro-lagers and yearn for something different.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

M: medium body, slightly oily, with a carbonation to accentuates the grainy and hop flavors. finishes off-dry.  Overall, interesting enough aromas and flavors. Mouthfeel is a little off and taste is kinda grainy.

192,607,Groenebeor,3.83,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Fat tire pours a deep burgundy amber that resembles a young brandy. Minimal head with a little lacing.  As with most ber ales. The hops hit the nose most strongly followed by a whiff of sweet honey malt. The beer tastes much the same, with the exception of an increase in the portion of malt you actually detect in the taste. Pretty well balanced- neither hops nor the malt are overpowering. Pretty damn drinkable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Settles down to a small amount of active bubbles on the top and around the edges of the glass. Looks clear and clean.  S - Biscuity malt dominates with some earthy hints and floral notes. Slight fruity sweetness.  T - Biscuit again and clean roasty malts. Very slight bitterness hinted at and some mild hops balance it out. Very clean, dry, and crisp. Pleasant and unique.  M - Clean and light bodied.  D - Drinkability is good. A nice mellow session beer and probably a good gateway to craft drinking.  Notes - Actually enjoyed this more than I expected.

Definitely taste more roasted malt than hops, but it's not too off-balanced.  M: Medium-bodied.  D: Not bad, but even after having this one a bunch of times I still don't get too excited about it.

A - Golden copper color with frothy white head and nice steady carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass. Sticky lacing.  S - Citrus dominated by an interesting malty smell. Can't put my finger on it, very unique...very bready/biscuity. Toffee, caramel, malty hops.  T - Malty and biscuity. Unique flavor that follows the nose. Very earthy and different. Not my favorite, but the unique taste was a step in the right direction from your average brew.  M - Smooth and malty...very malty. Did I mention it is malty?  D - Easy to drink, but the unique flavor isn't really my cup of tea.

Has a malty smell with some light citrus hops.  Fruity taste with some noticeable hops in the background. Sweet with hints of caramel and hoppy.  Lighter bodied beer with fair carbonation. Very drinkable and easy to have more than one or two.  I'm not usually a big fan of ambers but this one is an exception.

192,607,jhtipton,4.02,"I purchased this gem at the Navy Club in Seoul Korea. I think it made me a wee bit tipsy but I liked it none-the-less. Poured this nugget into a lager glass and accompanied it with some rye crackers and sharp cheddar. Made a nice little snack time libation. It is a nice copper colour in the glass. It gave me a brief amount of head but then transitioned to a small amount of lacing with steady stream of carbonation. I like the flavor. Not sure if I tasted biscuits as some comment. It has a little caramel malt flavor and some hoppiness. I tend to go for bolder hops but this is a decent ""session beer"" I could send back two or three with ease.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,drizzam,3.92,"A - Poured from the brown bottle into a clear pint glass. The brew is a clear orange/light amber color. An aggressive pour yielded a fluffy two finger white head with excellent retention. Nice sticky lacing was left down the inside of the glass.  S - A sour citrus smell emanated from the brew...pineapple maybe? Biscuity malts and subdued floral hops seem to appear as well. Fairly aromatic right after the pour.  T & M - A nice balance of biscuity malt and hops. The hops are just enough to make this a multi-dimensional brew, not enough to be bitter. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation.  D - A nicely balanced brew. Low enough in hop bitterness where it can be enjoyed by most, yet enough to be flavorful. At 5.2% ABV, you could easily session this brew. I could see stocking this in my fridge.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,beerthulhu,3.5,"A: Poured a pumpkin orange with a faint beige capping that was 1 finger high, frumpy and displayed an average retention rate. The lacing was fairly good leaving a thin spongey coating on the glass. There was a faint misty haze to the drink with micro particles lying suspended within that still allowed a good deal of visibility through the glass. Visible carbontion was light, composed of micro-bubbles that rose at a steady rate.  S: On the nose was a mixture of fresh caramel with pear slices. Not a lot of hoppiness was detected with a preference towards fruitiness. On the closing fade were glimpses of semi-dry oranges and applesauce.  T: As with the nose, the flavor was fruity and sweet with distinguishable notes of green melons, apples, pears with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. There was a bit of spiciness, perhaps touches of nutmeg finishing things out. The malting was bready with some honey notes and sweet moments of caramel coated oranges all rounding out with a fading soft alcohol touch combined with faint flowery citrus tones.  M: The mouthful was medium bodied, with a buttery avocado consistency. The carbonation was soft while a light residual maltiness lines the tongue upon the swallow.  D: Decent drinkability though may be a bit sweet for an all day drinker. Sweet and fruity but mannered enough to down a few.

M - Light body with fair carbonation, and a smooth, almost creamy finish.  D - It's a fair drink. Pleasing but not particularly remarkable.

There is light sourness, particularly notable in the lingering finish.  Dry, medium bodied, with a watery texture.  A Sam Adams perfect pint glass eases this unassuming beer.

I first had this beer in San Antonio back in spring of 2005 at this restaurant up the road from the Alamo right along the famous River Walk. $4.50 for 22oz, all paid for by the company budget. They went down like water and were among the most enjoyable beers I had ever had at the time. Just under five years later, a friend of my father's brought a case of this back from Colorado today. Finally, a chance to review it.  A: Clear with a thin white head, the color a perfect amber.  S: Sweet and biscuity, with a tiny floral note to the nose.  T: Biscuity malts with a little bit of pepperiness. Mild hops help to balance it and stick to the back of the throat leaving a very pleasant lingering bitterness. While it's not quite as sweet as I remembered it being on draft, it's a very mild beer.  M: Medium body with a very smooth feel.  D: With a great balanced taste and smooth body, this really has the potential to be an amazing session beer.

T- Weak hops dominated, nothing really balanced it. There were hints of malt and a fruity hang. I found it rather boring. Not offensive, just not as complex as I'd like.  M- Light bodied and crisp. Didn't finish as clean as I'd like with such a light bodied beer. It left my mouth slightly coated.  D- This is really a fairly drinkable beer. I find everything about it to be understated.

You can also smell the deep aroma of hops. The hops and malts to a good job of complimenting each other.  Taste: In short, this tastes like beer. The flavors are very delute.

On the whole, I found this beer lacking. The smell is a mild, semi-sweet grain with a little bit of hops. The taste is similar, just a little sweeter, with more wateriness and less hops. I couldn't get over how watery this beer tasted and felt.  Looking up, Fat Tire is very drinkable. Easy as anything you'll find without going macro-lite.  To conclude, maybe this is a case of a good but not great beer failing to live up to the big hype, and I'm just disappointed.

Only downside is the fast-disappearing head leaving a somewhat flat-looking beer.  S: Surprisingly hoppy in smell. Very mild sweetness underneath, but not too dominant.  T: Sweet tasting beer. Carmel was the predominant flavor in my experiences on-tap. Small balance from something not-so-sweet that I can't quite figure out....

I just wish it had a little better head. When I pour this beer I only get about 1/4"" of head that fades quickly but leaves good lacing on the glass. If it just had a little more head it would be a 5.0.  S: Very mild and sweet. No noticeable hop aroma. Kind of a sweet wet grain smell. It's not at all offensive but just hard to accurately describe. Seems everyone else calls this beer's aroma biscuit like. Well that aint what my mama's biscuits smelled like but...good aroma anyway.  T: This is where this beer really shines. Very mild malt flavor. No hops bite at all. Either very low hops or really well balanced by the maltiness. Very unique flavor profile, almost like toasted 7 grain bread? I've never tasted a beer like it. I'm generally a big fan of big hops but I really like this beer.  M: Great mouthfeel. Just like Goldilocks, not too thin, not to thick.

The malt flavors have a bit more graininess than the smell intimated but still have a distinct pale malt flavor. Midway through the sip small amounts of earthy hop flavors enter into things and carry through to a crisp and mildly bitter ending. As it warms it becomes mildly buttery as well, though it never becomes overkill.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a solid thickness with grainy carbonation.  Drinkability is good.

And it sticks around too.  S: bready/slightly toasty malt. I'm getting vague notes of citrus rind -- which I assume to be the hops. Spicy note too. Not sure what that is.  T: bottle describes malt flavor as biscuity, and I tend to agree. Very mild hop presence, just enough to balance, but the malt is what really comes through.  M: beer? It's wet, it's carbonated, it doesn't drink like a milkshake and I didn't expect it to. End of story.  D: Balance between hop and malt flavor and lower alcohol content make this ideal as a session beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jmaur345,3.52,"I kept seeing this beer around and a few a my friends told me it was a quality brew so when I found a six pack for sale I had to pick it up.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my trusty Chimay goblet, very pretty bottle design with a blurb about the beer on the back.  A- Coppery red color, well developed head that fades to a good sized ring that lasts throughout, excellent lacing when poured hard.  S- Very floral hop aroma, almost rosy.  T- Well balanced between the malt sweetness and the hops, it has kind of a bready taste to it. I was a little bummed out by the taste after the amazing smell, but it's still good, I just expected more.  M- Overall, pretty clean, slight lingering taste from the hops.  D- Good, not stellar, but good. I finished the six pack and would consider buying it again it it was on tap.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,JalfPsu,4.83,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a New Belgium goblet. As a PA resident, this smuggled beer was my first foray into New Belgium beers, and it was a wonderful experience.  The first thing I noticed was the color. Calling this beer ""amber"" doesn't do it justice. It's a rich gold, with pleasing effervescence, and a thin, creamy had that left intricate lacing along the inside of the goblet as it receded.  The smell is not overly assertive, and it's dominated by an inviting, bready aroma, with a strong undercurrent of sweet malts. Overall, the aromas are extremely pleasant, and mesh well with the flavors of the beer.  The taste did not disappoint. The bready yeast flavors and rich maltiness are certainly there, and it's moderately sweet, but never cloying. This is a very well balanced beer, with no one flavor overwhelming the palate. There's also a very subtle hop character, but it only comes through in the aftertaste, adding another note of complexity to this brew.  The body is light and crisp, with a relatively high degree of carbonation, almost cleansing the palate between sips, leading to a beer that is continually pleasant and refreshing.  This beer was heavily hyped for me, but it certainly lived up to it! If Fat Tire was available in Pennsylvania, I would probably drink it every day.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BrandonWardlaw,3.95,"This was one of the first beers I ever tried, and it has remained a favorite for me.  A: Golden amber, with a 1.5 finger head that dissipates to a thin layer. Moderate lacing.  S: Caramel, hops, biscuits and a hint of malt.  T: Very biscuity. Starts with a malty-caramel flavor, finishing with biscuits and hops.  M: Nothing outrageous. Light and somewhat carbonated.  D: High. These are easy to throw quite a few of back over the course of a night.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Smell is biscuity and malty. sweet Taste is slight bitterness melded around a complex bread and caramel malt profile. Mouthfeel is medium and lingers slightly afterward. reasonably clean finish but leaves you ready for another mouthful.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Josievan,3.88,"Appearance: Standard amber hue, perfectly expected for the style. Decent head sticks around for a spell, then gives way to a generous ring of lacing.  Smell: Malt and hops duking it out, but at a distance.  Taste: Toasty and quite malty, though I'm tasting the hops in this beer more than I ever have before. In the end, balance is the key characteristic.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with decent carbonation.  Drinkability: Easily sessioned, as I have done many a time.  Notes: Fat Tire was a gateway into the craft beer world for me. As such, it will always have a warm spot in my heart. Upon revisiting it after a long absence, I find it once again to be more than a decent brew. I'd say the draft version is superior to bottle, although you can't go wrong either way.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,devilben02,3.53,"I had tried Fat Tire a number of years ago on a trip to Texas and I enjoyed it, but didn't think it was anything remarkable. Once it started being distributed in NC, it seemed to be hyped as the next great craft beer, and many restaurants were advertising that they carried this special new beer. Not buying the hype, it took my a while to try it again around here. From this tasting, I continue to believe that this is a solid, enjoyable, everyday session beer, but I still don't believe that Fat Tire is terrifically special.  A vigorous pour creates a big, billowy head on top of a light orange-amber colored ale. The aroma is crisp and a bit sweet but is not too complex. The flavor is also skewed toward the sweet side, with the caramel taste of the malts being a dominant part of the flavor. This sweetness is balanced, however, with a bit of lemon hop astringency. Medium bodied, but still quite crisp and refreshing, making this an enjoyable and easy-drinking amber.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Nice retention  S- Subtle notes of caramel and dark chocolate. Mostly malty.  T- At first sip, the taste is identical to the smell. Biscuty malt with dark chocolate. Aftertaste is where the hops and subtle citrus come in.  M- Wonderful, arguably the best attribute of this beer.  D- Not as good as I would have hoped. A tad bit high on the carbonation.  Overall, I'd recommend this to just about anyone.

Its light bodied, a little dry but still refreshing. It didnt offer anything exciting or new but it didnt offend either.  D-An easy session beer, its light, doesnt fill you up like other american ambers.

Pours a clear amber hue with a fat head of off-white foam that fades slowly to a thick cap, leaving behind a nice display of thick rings as it disappears.  Aroma consists of some bready, biscuity malt notes and some underlying earthy, herbaceous hop notes.  The palate mimics the aroma in most aspects: Up front is a very mildly sweet, bready malt character, moving into a bitty, grainy persona toward the middle as it melds with mildly bitter herbal/earthy hops reminiscent of fresh earth, carrying on into a finish that is a nice melding of the characteristics: a bit malty-sweet, a bit earthy, and quite dry.  Nothing spectacular here. An easy quaffer and perhaps a bit of a nice craft intro for the macro drinker; nothing complex, nothing inoffensive.

Best before 12/25/09 on front label. Was a clear amber color with good carbonation and some lacing. It had an average sized beige head that settled into a foam and collar.  The aroma was biscuity and toasted malt with some floral hops but this is mainly a malt show. Never really enjoyed the aroma on this one and can't really pin it down. There is something in the aroma and taste that I find odd but not sure what. The taste follows the aroma and is biscuity with an odd aftertaste. Ambers are a middle of the road style for me but even then I usually don't find this aftertaste in the others. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp with good carb levels.  Overall, this is a good beer that I want to enjoy since it's from one of my favorite breweries and is readily available on tap but that odd aftertaste keeps it from being a big player. Even so, I get it on tap quite often as it's best choice. Recommend. Rotation: avail here bottle and tap.

192,607,JerzDevl2000,3.6,"Finally...I got a chance to buy the ""Yuengling of the West"" as I've always called this when I was on the road this past summer. I had it on tap once but I collect the sleeves of the six-packs that I drink and sure enough, this was one my ""to get"" list. While this isn't going to win any awards, it was one of the last beers I had this summer and yes, I still miss it now here in Jersey!  Nice pour to this - a ""bright brown"" hue to it with a decent amount of head and some lacing lingering after each sip. The taste was pretty light on the mouthfeel but not light in taste. It was pretty balanced, a slight floral taste with some roasted notes behind it. This went down pretty easily and I don't recall having these in my car for very long as I traveled. If you're looking for a hoppy American Amber, keep searching. This doesn't much of a bitter taste to it, but it doesn't detract from the beer at all.  Sure, this is above 5.00% ABV but if you're looking for a good session beer, this is it! I'll take this over a ""Lager"", as it's Eastern Counterpart is known in the Keystone State, but not with any type of food. Rather, it's a good beer for unwinding with at the end of the day or for a party where there aren't a lot of die-hard craft beer enthusiasts there. In other words, if I was getting into microbrews, this would be one of the beers I'd start out with.

However, last weekend someone ordered me one so I was reintroduced to it.  For me, it was just average. It has a very roasted nutty flavor and it sits heavy in the stomach. Nice maybe with a meal or just by itself, but not if you're out drinking and plan on having more than one. I just don't know what all the fuss is about because I know a lot of people who quite like Fat Tire, but perhaps it's just not for me. Not much ""wow"" factor...

The aroma is really nice. First a bit of caramel malt followed closely by some rich, nutty smell as well.  The flavor is very nutty up front with some caramel malts trailing. Following this is a slight citrus hoppiness, but nothing out of the ordinary, just allows the beer to be a bit more balanced. As the beer warms, the nuttiness mellows out, which is good for me.  The beer is smooth with a medium body that is pretty smooth going down. Not too much in the way of carbonation, either.  This is a good beer, I couldn't drink too many of them just because it would be too much nuttiness in one sitting.

192,607,PappinAce,3.85,"Appearance: I had this beer poured into a Belgian snifter-style glass. It was a golden-amber color, as the name suggests. Nice half-inch head which dissipated after about a minute, leaving really light lacing behind.  Smell: There wasn't much going on here other than the very apparent roasted malt and yeast, like a fresh-baked white bread. It got much more aromatic as it warmed up though.  Taste: Quite tasty. The beginning is very malty with the slightest hint of bitterness and yeastiness on the finish. The aftertaste lingers for a LONG time; after you think it's off your tongue, a clear bready flavor pops back up again. As the beer warmed up I thought I was getting a hint of raisins.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, I thought it was the right amount to compliment the flavors. I would say this is on the light side (5.6 ABV) but gets you a nice buzz when drinking from the typical 22 oz. bottle. Starts off feeling almost like a dopplebock because of the initial toasted maltiness, and then feels like a hefeweizen on the finish.  Drinkability: Certainly drinkable. That lingering aftertaste leaves me wanting more. I don't normally drink an entire 22 oz. by myself, but I couldn't leave this one. The alcohol hides itself well; the presence is not in-your-face.  8/10. In summary, liquid bread.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,marvin213,3.6,"A little on the light side for an amber ale, it looks more like a lager. The fat, foamy top provides more evidence in that regard. As the creamy head dissipates a full two inches from its cap (more indicative of a stout), a thick layer of lacing leaves a hoppy mark. It looks interesting though confused, and it's out of character for an American Red Ale.  The smell is less interesting, as there's not much to it. A bit of toasted malt, perhaps, and a biscuity vibe. Oddly like the escaping gas of a Hardee's drive-thru window, the effects are less impressive from a beer.  The taste is solid. Definitely biscuity, with a slight malt imbalance--it's more toasty than hoppy. The breakfasty toast taste is more pleasingly Hardees-like than the smell. A bit of caramel-like sweetness adds to the effect. If you have a breakfast stout with Fat Tire, you can have Fat Tire with biscuits-n-gravy.  Mouthfeel is better than most with the sweet malty biscuits. It's the most amber aspect of the whole beverage. There is, however, an old toast-like staleness to the aftertaste--I could do without it like a PB&J without the crust.  Drinkability is good and, at 5.2%, it's among the more flavorful ""sessionable"" beers. Vacationing in Breckenridge years ago, it was one of the first beers I appreciated as more than alcohol-infused water. It's blown up of late with massive moves into new markets, and I'm glad it's now available everywhere around here.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

It's pretty clear with a good amount of active carbonation. Still, just a little too light methinks.  S: Hmm, actually some hops, a mix but tending towards piney. Not to say it's hoppy, but you can smell the hops. Mostly malt, I'm getting a lot of biscuity, bready malts. Nothing dark.  T: Again, a very acceptable amount of hops for an amber, very nice job there. I'm getting a little off taste though, and I hate to say it, I really have no problem with beer in cans, but I taste a little metal. There is still that malty biscuity flavor, but it's milder than in the nose. All in all, it's a pretty mild flavor and no wonder why it's so popular.  M: Light and airy, a great hot weather beer, it has just the right amount of carbonation.  D: I couldn't think of a more drinkable beer, really. Lowish alcohol, solid flavor, and here I use drinkable as it applies to the population, I can't imagine many people not liking this beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ibbjamin,3.78,"This beer was left behind in my fridge from the last gathering I had. Believe it is around $7.50 per 6pack of 12oz bottles. I pour into a pint glass to review.  Half inch, white, fizzy and tight-knit head. Transparent dark gold color with many rising carbonation bubbles. Great lacing and just a thin sheet of white retention.  Has an earthy aroma with brown sugar, caramel, maple and raw adjunct. Interesting malt profile here as I'm getting hints of biscuit and toasted sweetness.  The taste is of dry toasted malt, brown sugar, caramel and barley/raw adjunct. A unique beer that seems to be a combination of a brown and an amber.  Light to medium body and nicely carbonated. Has a crispness to it yet leaves a mild toasted malt aftertaste. Nice mouthfeel makes this one quite drinkable.  Honestly, I thought this beer was going to be much more average. I have not had one in a while, probably since I just started getting into craft beer. It really is not bad at all and now I can see why this has become the staple gateway beer for many. I'm sure the high marketing dollar has a lot to do with it as well, but this here is not too bad a beer. Nice move there New Belgium.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

T -- Tastes of toasted malt that really coast across the palate, and fade into a light hop which balances the beer nicely.  M -- Nicely carbonated with a very clean finish that isn't very sweet, just nicely toasted.  D -- A very nice production beer whose reputation precedes itself, but overall for the money, they and many other people offer much better beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Taste - Sweet malt, a bready body with some spicy, bitter hops on the end. Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with high carbonation and fine bubbles. A little fizzy. Drinkability - Easy drinking. Overall - I remember this being much better the first time I had it on draft at the Bellagio.

Hopefully they will start distributing this into Pennsylvania.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ndillon45,2.96,"With all the hoopla, anticipation was high. Right off the bat, I was thoroughly disappointed with the macro-brew aroma. Pours clear bronze with thin tan head. Sticks to the glass well, so maybe it has some merit. Taste and feel was very similar to the macro brews which may explain the crowd of people it has drawn. On the plus side, it's highly drinkable, but I'd probably order a bud light for cheaper if that's what it came down to.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,alleykatking,3.28,"Had on tap at the Linebacker.  A- Pours a clear semi-dark amberish/copper color. Nice big two finger head that takes a little while to die down to the point where it is not all over my palate while I sip away. Good lacing on the sides of the glass. Looking at my notes the guy sitting next to me was drinking Amber Bock. I noticed how Amber Bock had better color but the head and lacing sucked on his glass.  S- Malts, malts, and more malts! Sweet bready malts dominate everything in this beer. Almost too much like they are trying to hide something up here. Faint toffee smell which gets covered up quickly with malts. Could detect a faint piney hint to this but oncne again everytime I tried to get a better sniff all I got was malts....enough with the god damn malts New Belgium!!!!  T- Well I knew what to expect with the taste from the sickly sweet aroma coming from the glass. Semi-sweet lightly roasted malts (sweet and bready) dominate the palate right from the get go. Some hints of toffee in the middle that get overpowered right away with the bready biscuty malts. Light hop bite on the tail end of this beer. Almost as much of a bite as Budwieser American Ale but I think even that has a more distinct bite to it. Really just a malty mess in your mouth.  M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good with this beer. All the malts in this beer make it feel more heavy in your mouth. Leaves a slick oily film of biscuty malt taste on the palate. Once again and it feels like I have stated this enough in the review...malts are everywhere in this. Aftertaste is well..go figure sweet and malty.  D- This I will say is a very drinkable beer in the sence you can go at it all night and be good to go. The place I went to to get it serves it in a 32 oz glass. I ended up drinking another 2 of them because only other things they had on tap were BMC products which I am not a huge fan of. Good lawnmower beer. I will and have drank it again but only when I don't want something bursting with flavor.  On a side note I have realized why this beer has become the battle cry of a ton of people over the past couple months in Indiana. It's something new to try and everyone gives it rave reviews (aside from on here or other beer sites). It has taken off because it leaves you with a familiar comfort zone (macro beer drinkers) but takes you on the start of a micro quest. People either except it and go on to bigger and better things or else you are stuck drinking this and Sam Adam's the rest of your beer drinking days.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Beautifully clear dark amber, carmelly color.  S: very light aroma, of crisp clean balance of hops and malt.:  T: this is where Fat Tire shines. not much for hops, but a nice, nutty bread maltiness - no bitter hops follow up at all. However, as it warms, a bit of hopiness come thru.  M: Solid body in spite of the understated taste. generous amount of carbonation. this is a SUBTLE beer but I really like it.  D: HIGHLY drinkable.

A pleasant balance between all ingredients. The hop aroma helps out the taste too.  M: Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel. Finishes dry.  D: Good drinkability. The flavors are all balanced very well. Even if nothing sticks out as spectacular its a nice drinkable ale.  Notes: Had to finally try this beer as almost everyone (both in the craft world and out) has heard of it. About what I expected.

Not too far form apple cider. Has a nice thick foamy white head with some decent lacing.  Smells roasty, with bready malts and some fruitiness. A faint whiff of hop can be smelled as well. Also has a bit of a fart odor.  Has a moderate watery body with a decent bit of carbonation. Taste is again very toasty and malty. Not much hops are present, but they give off a hint of earthy spice. Has a bit of sourness in the finish. The aftertaste is bitter.  Overall it is a pretty pedestrian ale, has an off putting scent and not the strongest taste either.

T/M/D - it has some of a hop feel to it, but I can't get over the malt, it's everywhere. It is full bodied, but mostly malty and finished malty. It's drinkable for like 4-5 but then the malt weighs you down. I loved this when it came out of the blocks but am over it, some say that a good beer can be drank over and over and keep you satisfied, this isn't the case for me.

The taste was similar with a bit of hops and perhaps a slight caramel or toffee taste. Both the smell and the taste seemed simple, with no individual notes, but both were good. It was a medium/light body that flowed very well  just not the same pazaz from a tap. Georgia has immediately become saturated in fat tire, with every bar and resturant advertising the same signs.

Taste - Exceptional... currently in WV, Yuengling is all the rage.. this blows Yuengling out of the water - and at 5.2%. With the recent passage of the State's Craft Beer Law, I hope I find some places that start aqcuiring this beer.  Mouthfeel - I'm not sure I understand this quality.

192,607,woodychandler,4.2,"I thought that by coming to Denver, I would have no problem finding this beer in a CAN. It turned out to be my quest for the great white whale. It existed, but just out of my grasp. I finally scored a sixer and have some for CAN-only trades.  I had just done a warm-up with Breckenridge Amber, but this is the gold-standard for an Amber beer. Let's see.  My bartender's pour created a finger-and-a-half of tawny head with good retention. The color was a really bright orangish-amber, translaing to NE-quality clarity. The nose was biscuity malty and I am so glad that someone explained that phrase to me. Again, this was the standard bearer for the style. Mouthfeel was medium and although the CAN mentioned ""Toasty malt flavors in tandem [(har)] with hoppy freshness"", I simply got the malt. This was eminently drinkable, especially in the amber style. The finish was smooth and slightly dry. I do not miss the sugary sweetness of some CANned beers which I have reviewed.  Shore/Beach: If you CAN find it, hell, yeah! It was an elusive beer in my estimation, but once I found it, I was glad that I had. Ten Fidy is NOT coming wih me to the Jersey shore!  Clearly, my CANQuest (tm) is above, but I am currently in the midst of winnowing down the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody & as such, I am revisiting it in bottle form. Today is F, 07 April 2017.  From the bottle: ""It's time to celebrate the beer that was conceived on a bike 25 years ago in Belgium. Fat Tire's perfect balance of bisquity [sic] malt flavor and hoppy freshness has always cruised with Belgian imagination and inspires us onward. Kickstand up! The future needs good beer.""  I Pop!ped the cap & despite it being a fresh bottle, I have begun to embrace a gentle pour followed by an in-glass swirl. In this instance, I raised two fingers of dense, foamy, tawny head that hung around briefly and slowly fell away to wisps, leaving a lot of lacing in their wake. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sweetish with a honey-biscuity scent. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was very malty, definitely biscuity as advertised. The hoppiness was barely noticeable, more grassy than anything else.

Leaves some great bright white lacing down the sides of the glass. Awesome initial appearance.  Smell: Bread, grains, and toasted malts highlight the nose. Not much going on besides those three scents.  Taste: Very bready and biscuity. The malts are almost overdone, but based on my past experiences with this beer, they seem just right. A slight tinge of bitterness on the back end, but this is malt-bomb through and through.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and refreshing. When you're looking for a light and flavorful summer brew, this has to be in the running.  Drinkability: This used to be more drinkable for me.

Light and mostly thin-textured on the palate, with average carbonation. Good flavor of roasted malt, with an average duration.

Smells like sweet corn malt and very subtle fruity notes.  Tastes incredibly refreshing with sweet corn malt , but not too much and a nice subtle skunky euro taste to it as well , nicely done  MF is pretty light and lots of carbonation is present with a very dry finish  All of that makes for a very drikable and enjoyable beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,bamadog,3.76,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a near perfect coppery color and the body is amazingly clear -- you can see everything through the other side as if you're just looking through a plain old window; fairly strong carbonation bubbles up from below; head is 1 and 1/2 fingers deep and is a creamy, just slightly off-white color that fades to a pretty thick and uneven skim floating on thes surface; leaves a fairly full lacing down the sides of the glass.  Smell: Smell is of toasty and grainy malts.  Taste: Not too shabby, and it definitely better than the smell - the toasty and grainy malts are coupled up with a nice, slightly sweet maltiness as well; there is a very mild hop presence that follows in the far end and holds slightly on to the aftertaste (which is really quite minimal itself) but is not especially bitter at all.  Mouthfeel: The body is nicely carbonated and comes across as quite ""wet"" and refreshing - leaves a very slight stickiness on the back of the tongue and a slight tingling on the gums.  Drinkability: Not bad, actually. I'm not the biggest fan of the amber style, but this one is definitely drinkable - the flavors are pretty nice and not overpowering and the ABV is more than manageable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Tastes of sweet grainy, bready malt. Slight bitter hop aftertaste. Not very complex in smell or taste.  Lighter in body than I would have expected.

Smells soft and grainy with some slight bitterness. Tastes similar, a bit bland with some grainy sweetness and some light bitterness. Smooth, but the taste drops off fairly quickly. A fairly pedestrian beer. Not bad, just a bit boring and no better than hundreds of others in the style- and worse than some.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SIRIUS2,3.63,"Poured into a pint glass from a 650 ml bottle  Pours a orangish gold in color with a plentiful dense creamy off-white head of about 2 fingers or so. Crystal clear. Tight lacing all the way down the glass. Looks nice.  Aromas are mild, basically malty. If you look for them, you might find some caramels and something earthy. Just a little above average in my mind, but pleasant none the less.  Earthy tones blend with malts on the tongue and make for a deceptively heavier taste than you might expect from the color. The body and mouthfeel are great and help to make this brew very satisfying overall. All of the flavor components are just solid and stay together great as they wash over the tongue.  Overall, this was enjoyable. This is definitely on the heavier earthy side of the amber ales but it is definitely worth a shot. I would certainly go after one of these again!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,taylorhamrick,3.18,"I didn't know if I'd ever drink this - it's something I imagined I would always pass over. But I got one for free, so of course I drank it.  Pours a kind of dark copper color, very clear, with a nice dense off-white head that sits around for a while. There's some decent lacing, nothing amazing, but this one looks nice. The smell is sort of subdued, but there's a crackery, kind of toasted bread type smell in there. A tiny bit of sweetness, some light esters, and some kind of chalky, grassy hops in the background. The taste comes across mostly with the toasted bread taste - not burnt you know, but lightly toasted. It's kind of sticky, and I can actually notice the presence of esters here. That sort of subtracts from the flavor that's present. The hops don't come across with a lot of flavor, but really come with a little bit of a feeling - not bitter, but just like a kind of hoppy mouthfeel or something. The malt can get kind of powdery and overbearing at times, almost making it taste dry when it's really kind of sweet. There's a kind of funny yeasty taste, too, but overall, it's fairly pleasant, and though there's nothing to wow you in here, it's not bad at all. The mouthfeel is kind of off though. The carbonation is nice, but somewhere between the huge amount of biscuit malt, the funny feeling from the hops, and the esters mixed in here, the feeling of the beer gets to be kind of off-putting. But overall, you can drink it fairly easily. The price is pretty good for a 22oz bottle, but I wouldn't say I would go after this again, but it was nice to visit once.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Though exactly the same in design, this bomber is way cooler than the Georgia commemorative ones I saw in Augusta not long ago.  Pours an orange-amber color. Nearly two fingers of foam retain well and leave some decent lacing behind.  Sweet malty nose. Not a very powerful nose, slightly above average for an amber. Some very mild earthy hops.  Sweet grainy malt flavor. The hops seem to disappear outside of a very light, brief bitterness, that gives way to a slight sourness. Not great, but far from bad. I can see why so many consider this to be a great gateway craft beer.  Body is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation seems right on par. Not bad. Not much depth or complexity, but it fits a niche.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

VERY easy drinking, and that caramelized, toasty malt really is what sets it apart from other flagship beers by the other near-mainstream craft breweries such as sam adams or sierra nevada.

The head eventually faded to a frothy cap, which lasted until the beer was finished.  The aroma was super mild. Somewhat powdery initially and a touch malty. As the beer opened up, some bready malts were detectable.  The taste was full flavored for the style. Lots of toasty malts came through up front, along with a distinct nuttiness. Fruity in the center. Some earthy hops were noticeable in the clean finish.  The beer was medium bodied. Somewhat creamy with a fine, livelier than average carbonation.  Drinkability was impressive.

192,607,jbphoto88,3.5,"The brew pours a crisp, clear burnt orange color and has a nice tan head that laces well. That's it. That's all the inspiration I get from the appearance of this beer. Sure it looks nice but so did a coors light once in my life. Maybe the bottle just looked at me the wrong way. Stupid bicycle.  The scent is grounded in malt-ville. There is a toasted and sweet malt nose but I feel it could be bolder.  I'll give this a 3.5 because it's better then some others that I've tried but not by much. The malt taste seems stale and over worked. I know this is the workhorse beer for the label and thus probably made in giant batches which could explain the lack of character. Personally I dig the other offerings from New Belgium.  The mouthfeel is smooth starting and gives way to carbonated bitterness. Light body and a sizzle of bubbles after each sip. A decent beer but only a few steps above average.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

It pours dark orange with an off-white head that doesn't last. There's some lacing.  The smell is very inviting: malty and biscuity, as others have noted. There's some sweetness in there, as well. Toffee, maybe? No hops as far as I can tell.  The taste is right in line with the smell. Malty, chewy, biscuity. I can't detect any hops at all. The carbonation lingers in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is good -- semi-full. Lighter than a lot of ambers out there (I'm looking at you, Full Sail). Carbonation is where it should be. It's noticeable, but doesn't distract.  Drinkability is high. Despite its dark color, this is a good summertime session beer.  This beer strikes me as the little brother of (e.g.) Boont Amber Ale, which has the hops and complexity that this beer lacks. If you're a hophead, this beer probably isn't for you.

The taste has a nice rich malty taste that is hardy, there is a bit of hops to keep the malts in line though the malts are clearly the star of the show. Flat out a nice session beer for when you do not want anything that complex; just a simple solid non-challanging ale. a perfect beer for smoking a joint, mowing the lawn, a lazy afternoon, a concert.

192,607,TeeCee,3.58,"Quick review: Very sessionable beer with more flavor than I'd remembered, but not as much as I'd like.  I picked this up as part of New Belgium's Folly Pack 12 pack. I poured it into an American style pint glass hard enough to produce ~2"" of head. The body has that tea look I've been noticing lately: totally transparent orangey amber. The head dissipated over the course of a few minutes, leaving sticky traces on the walls of the glass, reducing ~1/8"" of foam. Very slight, continuous nucleation.  Malty on the nose. I can't smell any hops discernibly.  The taste is smooth and malty with some hop trailing as I finish the sip. Some hop flavor, but no overwhelming bitterness to speak of. A nice balance.  Not quite as thick in the mouth as I expected. Not quite a light beer, and thicker than a BMC lager. Maybe it is just as thick in the mouth as it should be.  I could drink several of these. They go down easy. I might be turning to something else to get more flavor, but then those something elses would not be very sessionable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

I think this beer would be much better if it had a bit more malt for sweetness. No doubt, this is a very easy drink and tasted quite fresh. I can't believe its abv is as high as it is.

Taste seems a little off but I have never had this beer so I dont know how it should have been. Citrus character as well as a nice malt body make up this beer. Not that much going on. A good mouthfeel that does exactly as it should and is quite pleasant.

192,607,czfreeman,3.7,"Fat Tire came to SC earlier this week and now it's time to review. Pours a light-amber burnished copper tone. Light tan head provide a decent amount of foamy goodness. Light lacing is left. Light biscuity hoppiness upfront, a malty light bodied palate of aroma. Some carmalized sugar is suggested, a light touch of yeastiness adds a floral note. A sour-cherry tart smell comes through, suggesting a slight oakiness. Wheras most beers in the American Red genre is extremly hopped,i.e Rogue brutal, Big Hoppy Monster, this one defineatley has a Belgian Flair, even if it is somewhat subdued Taste is sweet/sour maltiness, light carbonation provides a creamy backdrop for tart malts, light floral hoppiness, and a light finish.This beer is very light bodied, no real overpowering notes of anything jumping out. There is no explosion of flavor, nothing very stand out about it.

A nice light copper color into the glass with a decent head and some lacing.  The smell is minimal, even as the beer warms, some sweetness and a little bit of hoppiness are barely detectable.  The taste is mostly caramel malt with some light hop bitterness and some mint and citrus notes, not strongly flavored at all.  The mouthfeel is crisp, the body is on the lighter side, this leads into a very easy drinking beer.

Smells of toasty malt and a little bit of a nutty aroma. just a hint of hops but I smelled the hops better while it was still in the can.  Tastes quite good, nutty with a moderate malt backbone, just a subtle hop that you can't hardly taste until you burp it up.  Mouth is a bit oily and moderately carbonated. Drinks easy straight out of the can or from a glass. I think this is a better beer when you don't have to smell or see it so the can is a good thing.

Light carbonation could be seen rising to the top.  Aroma was light and grainy with a bready malt backbone. No hops to mention. Not much to it really.  The taste pretty well followed the nose, light, grainy/bready. Pretty simple and too light.  The beer felt light in body but was smooth. Drinkability was above average mainly because of the light flavor and nothing too strong that would be off-putting.

A bit of sweeter fruits with some citrus and herbal hops. A bit of a funky aftertaste, maybe metallic like. Not real complex here.  M: Light and dry, a bit thin.

Taste is largely malty with some caramel flavor. Not much complexity but it is refreshing. I don't taste any of the distinct biscuit like flavors found in Belgian style ales. There is a faint metallic taste.  Moderately carbonated and medium bodied - it leaves a pleasantly sweet after taste. It very soft and non-agressive on the palatte.  The refreshing flavor and low ABV allows one to enjoy several in one session. I have heard about this beer for many years and the hype surrounding it is bound to disappoint.

S- Real toasty, Molasses, German dark bread.  T- Nice maltyness, flavors of toast and biscuits. Slightly nutty. Barely perceivable hops. Saltines?  M- Light, but has some lingering body. The taste of biscuits stays on the tongue long after the sip is done.  D- I'd like to nominate Fat Tire as the new standard for American session beers. This goes down incredibly easy, and packs a lot of flavor. It's not a flavor that I'm always in the mood for, but neither is Pliny the Elder or Mikheller.

Has about medium carbonation, and leaves some Patchy, soapy lacing. Smells of lightly toasted grains and malts, sweet caramel notes, nutty, very much like chocolate cake. Some slightly earthy notes, and tart grape, but has a major malt profile.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes, ah, like chocolate cake. Lots of flavorful, sweet grainy, malty, molasses, caramel, honey, chocolaty notes flood the palate, there's some lite citrus flavors and subtle hop bitterness in there, but just enough to round it out. Highly malty and very flavorful! Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly silky, small bite of carbonation on the tongue, and lite-medium bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - Ive had this wonderful Ale many times before, finally decided to pick up a 6pack to see if it tasted as good as I remembered, and it did! Ive always loved this nearly flawless tasting Ale, my only complaint would be the body, I would appreciate just a little bit more body to it, but otherwise it's perfect to me.

Overall I'd describe the taste as pleasant, but altogether nothing very exciting going on.  I'm a little bit disappointed in the mouthfeel.

Creamy, filling feel with a touch of stickiness.  Here is the thing. I have been drinking this beer out of a can since its introduction here in Indiana and merely called it okay. After pouring it out, aerating the drink and being practically moved to tears by its appearance, I have an entirely different viewpoint of the beer. It turned from good to great. No exaggeration.

The toasted flavors are robust. There is a mild floral hop finish that's slightly bitter.  Medium body, good amount of carbonation.  It's an easy drinker.

Really though, this just might be the quintessential ""American session ale."" It's clean, with a great malt base, and just enough hops to balance, which add a touch of complexity. The mouthfeel rides that fine line between enough body to round out the flavours, but light enough to keep things moving. Sure, there are more ""interesting"" beers out there, and I tend not to session anything really, but if I were to do so, I would not hesitate to reach for a 6-pack of Fat Tire.

Thin creamy retention that flares up into a rigid 1/2 finger that throws some massive frothy lacing up on the sides of the glass.

The taste is toasted malts and caramel sweetness mixed in with a pervasive fruity citric character. Light bittering hops pull up the back with some needed balance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fairly relaxed and creamy carbonation and a generally all around refreshing feel about it.

The toasted malt provides a decent backbone for the mild hit of pine and somewhat citrus hop flavors.  M - Light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation.

A good fluffy white head with good retention and good lacing for the full tasting.  The nose is a bit cleaner than versus the bottle. The malt comes out with a light bready and biscuit aroma. Some minor caramel as well. There isn't the nutty aroma that I usually associate with Victory malt (and a bottled FT). A very clean yeast and some minor esters. The hops are a bit cleaner as well, and the herbal and floral hops come out a bit more.  The taste is similar in that it is a bit softer. The malt is very clean with a light caramel. Some minor hints of the nuttiness, which Im not a fan of. Some bready notes come out as well. The yeast is a tad more noticeable in the can version as well. Some light rose peddles and bananas. The finishing hops are about equal, a good balance with hops and malt.  The body is a about the same, moderate to light. Very clean and easy drinking.

192,607,prototypic,3.33,"Ahhhh. Fat Tire. I hear a lot about this beer and have been anxious to try it for quite a while. Let's get to it.  It pours a light copper or amber color and is very clear. A light vanilla colored head tops it off. It's about a finger and a half deep and was very quick to recede. An ample amount of sticky lace remained on the glass. Not bad, but not great.  The nose is underpowered and very average. It's initially a little sweet and malty. Smells mostly like toasted malt. A fair amount of yeast is noticeable throughout. Hops are very faint and could easily squeak by unnoticed. They smell mostly floral and earthy. Perhaps the light grainy smell on the tail is attributable to them. There's something here to work with, but it comes across as way too anemic.  The flavor's a little better than the nose, but it's only above average. It is sweet and malty initially. Its base consists of a mix of pale, toasted, and caramel malts. The toasted variety is the most distinct flavor. It's yeasty throughout. Hops are floral and grassy. A spicy hop flavor emerges toward the end that gives it a little edge. It's slightly grainy. Alcohol is not noticeable at all. It finishes a little bitter and spicy. It's not bad, but is clearly not nearly as impressive as I've heard.  Fat Tire is nowhere near robust or fat. In fact, it's thin and feels a little watered down. Carbonation is active and crisp. It's nowhere near smooth. Drinkability is above average. There's not enough flavor here to entertain most of us beer geeks for very long. Its abv and feel certainly lend themselves to sessionability, but I doubt many BAs would be happy with this for long.  Well...Fat Tire's okay, but not exactly good beer. Not nearly as good as I've heard. Incidentally, all the talk I hear is not from the craft beer crowd. I now understand why. Fat Tire's probably a good gateway beer into the craft beer world. There's enough here to intrigue the uninitiated. But for those of us who really scrutinize our beer, there's not much here. The nose is weak, the flavor's merely above average, and it's too thin. I don't buy all the hype I've heard about this beer, but I get why ""the others"" incessantly talk about it.

Decent lacing all the way down.  Smell: Toasted biscuit, caramel, and sweet citric hops. Citrus and hops seem more pronounced in this version than others.

Lots of sweetness with clean hop finish.  Mouthfeel: Light-medium body, well-carbonated, pretty sugary, and clean. Quite smooth.  Drinkability: I've had Fat Tire many times from many different sources. It's always tasted the same to me.

Dare I say...musty cardboard kinda held in my mind as well. Doesn't really spark it up.  Taste was pretty mild as well, but very easy and enjoyable. Predominantly toasty, the hops were sneaky but evident more towards the finish. Become more buttery as it warmed. Clean tastey finish.  Body is quite light but carbonation is spot on.  What lacks in complexity compensates in QUAFFABILITY.... which is where I think Fat Tire shines, and is my best guess for its massive popularity amongst even novice beer drinkers.

This is a great beer if you're just getting into craft beers and not sure where to start. Give this beer a try to get your bearings. I've heard a lot people and I include some of my friends, say that they don't care for this beer. They can never really place why they don't like it though. I'll admit the first time I had this beer, I didn't care for it that much. Over the years though it has grown on me, and it's not my favorite or even in my top 10, it's still a really solid beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Decent looking beer. orangish amber color with a small head. leaves some decent lacing on the glass.  aroma is all caramel malt. wish there was atleast a hint of hops on the nose. not getting much smell with this brew though.  average taste. nothing really sticks out in the taste of this beer to me. bready with some caramel taste. good bitterness to balance the beer out.  mouthfeel is slightly undercarbonated to me. but this is a pretty drinkable beer. nothing about it makes me want to go back for another sip though. not a very exciting beer at all.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,surfer4life,2.26,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bomber.  A - Pours on the yellow side of amber, maybe just a tad darker than yellow. Small head, with average lacing. Freshness date on the bottle.  S - Smells a bit like a malt liquor to me. I get some corn in there, some other grains, but no floral hop nose at all. Faint sweetness, but again nothing defined enough to identify.  T - Not much taste really, I get what I smelled. Corn, some kind of sweetness, perhaps from syrup, but not to great. No hops detected at all, the malt is subpar.  M - Medium bodied and way undercarbonated. Mouthfeel is not pleasant at all.  D - I'm afraid I would rather go without. It's possible I got a bad bottle, but the drink before date has been maintained. I will try it again with hopes for a better outcome.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BigJim5021,3.16,"New Belgium has finally hit Indiana. So, I figured that if the shit was here, I might as well see what the big goddamn fuss is all about. I got the 1554 on Tuesday and was completely unimpressed. Fat Tire has fared a bit better.  Pours more orange than amber from the nice-looking little can. Big ass white head settles into a permanent ring with a good amount of lacing.  The smell is toasted caramel malt. Not the least bit assertive, though.  The flavor is just as mild as the smell. It's got a good toasty flavor to it, but there just isn't enough of that flavor to stick out.  Mouthfeel is too thin, but not terribly so. Carbonation isn't quite what I would call aggressive, but it's at least somewhat assertive.  Drinkablity is above average. I could easily throw a handful of these back in a sitting. This stuff doesn't live up to its cult status. At least it wasn't the letdown that Shiner Bock was.

A- Amber in color with very little head. The head that is there is very white.  S- The smell is caramely with a large grain smell.  T- The beer is malty for sure, not hoppy in the least especially for a red ale. There is a slight bitter taste that leaves a weird taste in your mouth. This is not better in a can to say the least.

S: Smells a little fruity reminiscent of an English ale. Not sure what fruits, but it's there. Smell is not really outstanding in any way, but not at all offense. Just a little unremarkable much like the majority of the beers in this style.  T: Tastes pretty crisp and mildly fruity, again reminding me of a poor example of a Samuel Smith's style ale. Similar in many ways, just not as good. Caramel malt is there, but in the background.  M: Feels good, nice and oily. Carbonation is just right, but the feel is pretty thin.  D: As long as it stays cold, it's very drinkable. Once it gets warmer it tends to the bitter side.  A good standby if nothing else is available as it's extremely wide in its distribution net.

Poured into my big glass mug because it was the only thing big enough for the whole bomber. Poured a very lite amber with a little too much head for my taste. The rest of the beer (smell, taste, mouthfeel) was nothing at all spectacular. Finally, this beer was way too expensive for what was at best an average amber. $4.50 a bomber was just dissapointing.

A: Quite clear for being ""can conditioned"", a little bit of haze though. Very orange/light brown in color, excellent lacing.  S: Roasted malts, a faint hint of caramel, clean piney hops, and thats about it. Not really that exciting in the nose. Baked breads. All the usual aromas.  T: Biscuity malt, lots of roasted flavors, a faint sweetness, and a mild hop bitterness. The canned version seems to be a little more flavorful than the bottle, things seem a little more robust. Not too shabby but nothing to rant and rave about.  M: Medium thickness and medium carbonation, slick, slightly dry, leaves a desire for another drink.  D: Easy drinker all around.

192,607,originalsin,4.06,"At my local home brew supply shop yesterday, I ran into a New Belgium Rep. by the name of Dallas. Really nice guy- he shared some samples of Fat Tire with us as well as some merch. I'd never seen Fat Tire in a can before, so I thought that was really cool. I'll be perfectly honest- I've had Fat Tire a couple times previously and I've never really enjoyed it that much...my palate has expanded so much since then, so let's give this another shot.  A: Really nice head on the pour....about half an inch. The retention was ok, and it's laced well thusfar. The pour was a rusty amber...a fat rusted tire haha.  S: A bit estery almost. Maybe some apricot on the nose. It's weird to say but the smell really seems to match the color. A bit rusty--and a lot of malt on the nose. Some caramel as well.  T: It doesn't assault your taste buds from the get go. There's a really long lingering taste of caramel malt, though, and that's what I taste throughout. A malty brew.  M: Medium carbonation and a really smooth beer altogether. Nothing really sticks out and, as i said before, assaults your taste buds. It's got a good mouthfeel.  D: A very drinkable brew which explains fat tires success. It's enjoyable the whole beer through.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,dancinwillie,3.21,"Thanks to myself for sending me a bottle from my trip to Phoenix!  Very light amber color, clear with a modest off-white head. Foam recedes quickly, leaving a bit of lacing on the sides.  Aroma is faint. I let it warm for a few minutes...after about 10 minutes, still faint. Some general fruitiness, and a bit of chocolate.  Mellow flavors all around. Chocolate is present from the nose, and there is a general fruitiness that I still can't put my finger on. Hopped well, although I can't say for sure what hops were used.  Mouthfeel is about the best thing about this beer. It's smooth and velvety. Finish is semi dry. A good beer to session maybe, or to enjoy with a meal, as it will remain unobtrusive.

192,607,drperm,4.3,"Reviewed on 21 March 2009, soon after it hit NC shelves!  Appearanace: Russet amber that glimmers in the glass. Lots of bubbles that rise to a thin off-white head.  Aroma: Toast and homemade popcorn.  Taste: Toasty, malty, firm biscuit presence leads into a mild warm hop statement, and finishes with a bitter snap. Lovely!  Palate: Goes down smooth, jovially, agreeably, and maltily.  Overall: A great, well-balanced brew with a malt-foot forward. Easy, extroverted, not too complex but not at all boring! It's categorized as an ""American Amber/Red Ale"" but to me it has shades of a good ESB (with less bitterness). Nothing fancy -- but you don't always want a fancy beer.

S: Toasted biscuit malt aroma comes through the heaviest, followed by some vague floral hops.  T: Once again toasted biscuit dominate, but that's not a bad thing. The hops and mouthfeel both act to keep the brew from taking on a thicker quality. The finish is clear and the hops are present.  D: A great, drinkable crossover beer. A good go to for beginners, or those new to craft beer. Not a great beer, but a solid beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SykDoc,3.65,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a clear copper/amber. The off-white head gets to about 1.5 inches and reduces with full coverage until it is gone.  The aroma includes nice caramelly malts with some fruity sweetness and yeast. There seems to be a reasonably good balance between the hops and malts and at one point, I could notice some cinnamon.  The taste was also a nice balance of caramel malts and hops. A very slight metallic taste and silky banana sweet that lingers with the hops. When you mix this together there is an almost bread-like component to the taste.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied. An initial crisp/carbonation is followed by a smooth and almost leathery feel on the tongue. It ends fairly dry on the palate.  Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. The flavor hides the alcohol but does not destroy the palate. The mouthfeel leaves you with a fair level of enjoyment as well. A very good beer that I will continue to enjoywhen I have the opportunity, which is fairly minimal.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,rtratzlaff,3.3,"Fat Tire has a clear light amber body with a white head that dissipates and leaves minimal lacing.  The aroma is mainly sweetish malt that isn't really caramel, but more like light toast.  The taste matches up well with a hop balance that gives just enough flavor. Toasted bread is about the main quality of the flavor. A slight bit of diacytle is there as well giving it a slightly buttered bread flavor.  The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the style, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. This could be a good session beer, but nothing I would seek our or purchase often.  Compare this to the other beers of this style, and it doesn't come close to comparing to the best of them. Compare it to the anything people consider ""beer"" and yeah, it is better than most.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MikeInIowa,4.53,"I love Fat Tire. Once I am more adept at examining beer critically, I will know why it is that I love it so much, and update my review then.  But for right now, I will say that it is because of the following reasons: Its rich, nutty aroma; its creamy feeling like that of a decadent, chocolate cream pie; its luxurious, opaque amber appearance and sustained, light-brown head; and its completeness of taste in that it stimulates sweet and bitter simultaneously and in precise balance between the two without lingering a second in excess.  Did I mention that I love Fat Tire.  With Respect for Beer, MikeInIowa",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,smerkinb,4.11,"From a 22oz bottle marked ""Commemorative-Taking Flight in NC"" Copper pipe color with a flax colored 2 finger head. Bubble a bit fizzy-not like pop(soda) but definitely active. Clinging lacy strands of foam stick around. This brew is clear as a spring day.  Smell is mild but appealing sweet and malty with just a little snap of floral in the background. Not super expressive; not a bar- it-all-in-your-face style. More like a quick glimpse of thigh and lace that coyly intrigues you to want more.  The taste is what happens behind those closed doors--after you've been together for 5 years. It's good, it makes you want more, but it's not gonna leave you gasping for breath or hunting for you clothes later. Malts take charge with hoppy lightly floral background notes. Somewhere in the mix is a bit of toasty caramel, but this was like finding Waldo--I really had to pay attention to pick it out.  Good carbonation prickled my tongue and the slightly oily mouthfeel made it even easier to down this quickly. Smooth, with a dryish finish, I had no recourse but to grab my glass again almost as soon as I had set it down.  To me, this was balanced and a good idea of what I could expect from this style. Honestly, my bomber when down way too quickly.  Tasty, easy to drink, enjoyable and refreshing. Right on the money for this style, I think.

The thick sticky white head leaves lacing all over the glass. Nice appearance over all.  Aroma is slightly sweet with a roasty malt and earthy hop character.  Flavor is full of roasty biscuit malts. The hops are more like that found in English pale ales. They impart a nice earthy flavor and gentle bitterness that doesn't over power. There is also a mild apple tartness.  Mouthfeel is a little thin and the carbonation is higher than I would like. It also has a slightly slick feel. Drinkability is pretty good but it's not something that I come back to regularly.

Poured an orange copper colour with a soapy, white head that faded away in about 60 seconds. CO2 bubbles continuously stream upward. Smell is nice. Quite a bit of caramel and other sweet malty nuances. A bit of earthy hops is slightly detectable. Lets hope the flavour holds more hops than the smell. Nope, it's all malt, and rather ""un-eventful"" malt at that. Not a very complex beer at all, really. Starts out very slightly bitter, if you use your imagination, then goes to moderately sweet malt, then finishes a bit dry. That about sums it up.

It's like Yuenling for some reason, everyone wants it even though it's really nothing amazing. But on my recent trip to Colorado I thought I would check it out again and see for myself. I was actually pleasantly surprised. A real pretty amber beer with a nice comfy head. It strikes me as more of an English style ale than a west-coast amber. Lots of bready, doughy, biscuity maltyness with some toffee and caramel thrown in. Earthy herbal hops in the finish. This beer for being as ""dark"" as it is, is really super super drinkable and has plenty of flavor.

It isn't very heavy and at only 5.2% alcohol its definitely a session beer.  Overall I enjoyed this beer. I had this a few years ago on tap in California and at the time I thought it was one of the best beers I had ever had.

Very light and transparent zinc orange color, just about as much yellow as any deeper red. Mocha, chocolate cake start off the nose, then corn syrup, dried tea leaves, the lack of a strong roast cedes more territory to the grainy and floral hops elements, almost by default, no citrus. Light-bodied and at times the carbonation foams up enough to make it feel dilute. Malted milk balls, caramel, some biscuit or baguette type of doughiness, here you get a suggestion of sweet mixed white citrus and pine.

Even more watery at the finish, no lift nor final kick.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,PittBeerGirl,3.13,Thanks to Swellbow for hooking me up with this beer of the west!  A- Body is a crystal clear medium amber hue. Pours with an approximately 2 finger white head. Head eventually fades to a thick collar and traces of lacing are left all the way down the glass.  S- Faint sweet caramel malt comes to the nose first followed by an impression of herbal/grassy hops.  T- The flavor upfront is very mild and offers herbal and grassy hop flavors along with a faint sweet malt backbone. The finish is even more faint than the beginning and doesn't really taste like anything but water. After the finish a mild impression of grassy hop bitterness emerges.  M- Medium tingly carbonation and a body that is a bit thin and watery.  D- My overall impression of this beer is that its pretty boring. Nothing offensive-but nothing exciting. I can see why it is so popular with being a good transition beer from BMC to craft beers. Easy to drink and nothing offensive about it.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,daliandragon,3.6,"I picked this up today at the Whole Foods here in Cary and subsequently saw it at each of the three grocery stores on my weekly shopping run. As announced on its label, New Belgium has officially arrived in the Old North State. I had always wondered about that since Fat Tire was absolutely ubiquitous every time I made a sortie west of the Mississippi but I never saw it on the East Coast. Wonder no longer my children.  Pours a very light copper color with a decent but temporary head and an aroma worthy of its namesake: malty with caramel but very yeasty and featuring notes of spice and honey.  My first impression is the abundance of carbonation and yeast to the detriment of the overall taste. There is light floral hopping to temper the caramel and toasted bread tones from the malt. The flavors do grow on you with each sip but although definitely unique, this isn't something I'm going to seek out regularly, no matter how common it becomes round these parts.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,wedge,3.25,"Commemorative ""Taking Flight in North Carolina"" bomber...oooh. Best Before: 26JUN09.  Pours a brilliantly clear orange-amber with a thin but sticky white head. Sweet, nutty, almost bicuity pale malt aroma. Spicy, earthy hops and hints of peaches and faint citrus. The flavor is similar with a more pronounced floral/herbal quality. Light toasted grain, apricots, and perhaps some melon. Light easy drinkin' body.  Nothing to get excited about.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,cvstrickland,3.7,"22-Ounce bomber bottle with the infamous bicycle an additional red sash on the label that reads, ""Commemorative"" and ""Taking Flight in North Carolina"". Well, isn't that nifty.... Now let's see what the deal is with this much buzzed-about beer from this much buzzed-about brewer....  In a large tulip glass, Fat Tire Amber Ale is sparkling-clear and golden-amber in color with a cap of grainy white foam. A few steady streamers of active carbonation feed the soft-bubbled head, and webby lacing is left at the sip-marks inside the glass.  The smell is toasted-biscuity and florally sweet with a clean honey note and a twist of lemon.  The taste is rich and malty with a touch of caramel sweetness and a rich toasty backbone reminiscent of my grandmother's inimitable flour biscuits, toasted dark and sprinkled with sugary, sticky malt syrup. Hops are present in the finish as a tingle of spice, and bring a bit of dusty dryness to balance the drink.  Fat Tire is light-medium in body, well-carbonated, and superbly drinkable, and definitely makes me want to try more brews from New Belgium. Welcome to North Carolina, NB! Cheers!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,tdawgydog,3.8,"2nd brew on my West Coast trip... Purchased a 22oz bomber from Whole Foods, which has an amazingly good selection for a grocery store.  The beer pours a nice light copper color, small head with decent lace retenion. I must note that I am drinking it out of a plastic cup in a hotel room because that's all I have;-)  There is plenty of hoppyness present but it's not over powering. There is a slight hint of biscuit that makes a pleasing addition to the pallette. Overall a very good beer that I would definitely drink again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S-Not much to the smell, sweet with not much hop presence  T-A nice tasting amber ale for the most part. Again pretty sweet with no hops to speak of.  M-A crisp, refresing beer.  D-An amber ale I could definitly sit down and drink several of.

Taste...what taste. There is hardly any. Don't get me wrong, this beer is very drinkable...if you like plain water. However, I found this beer to have little if at all any taste to it. Boring is what I call it. Now, some of their other beers, I like. This one, yeah....not so much. Come on people, get some taste buds. Expand your beer drinking vocabulary.

The carbination is fairly high. Smell has a slight hoppy scent too it with a bit of maltiness in there, not overly impressed. Taste has a big malt forward base, not really much in for hops exept a touch of like refreshness at the end. The taste almost reminds me of High life with a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is alright, had a bit of consistency and has pretty clean aftertaste. Overall I was a bit disapointent with this one. It wasnt bad but didnt stand out If I want this light high carbinated malty taste Ill get a high life for a quarter of the price.

192,607,SickBrew,2.83,"I think this is the first ""can"" conditioned beer I've had, at least that I'm aware of. However, it's not much different than the bottled version.  Appearance is better than average and it does leave some lacing. It does look more like an IPA than an amber, however. Taste is a bit dry and there's a heavy earthy component that just doesn't sit well with me. I find it off putting. Body is medium light and than can conditioning resulted in good carbonation.  If you where golfing and your choice is a domestic can or Fat Tire in a can, I would go with Fat Tire.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

A- Poured golden amber into the glass with a rising tan-white head that settles back into the liquid after a few sips. Very inviting.  S- Beatiful malty aroma that makes me salivate.  T- Simply delicious. Malt predominates, but it dosen't overpower. Nice subtle hop flavor finish.  M- Rich and creamy. So good.  D- Very drinkable. Every sip leaves you wanting to come back for more.

S: Biscuit malt, some caramel, and a little bit of floral notes.  T: Toasted, biscuit, and caramel malts come out as I drink, leaning toward the toasted malts as the drink warms. Crisp and dry in the mid-taste, with a little hop bitterness in the finish.  M: On the thin-side of medium-bodied, almost a bit watery. I like the carbonation.  D: This is the halfway-craft beer that many popular bars carry. If I find myself in one of those establishments, that's probably when I'd try this. Otherwise I have no desire to drink it.

A tad light for the style but still good looking.  The aroma is dominated by light malts with a strong bready character with only hints of caramel sweetness. More toasted than sweet overall.  The taste follows the aroma pretty close with the light toasted malts and grains dominating with a faint fruity sweetness and a slighty dry toasted finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and crisp due to the major toasted malt presence.  This is a fair amber that's drinkable but doesn't offer anything original or complex.

Fruity smelling hops make an appearance as well as some corn flake cereal and honey notes. One of the classically identifiable smelling beers.  Nutty and toasty tasting amber ale. The prominent sweetness found in the nose is much more subtle in the taste. Some, but not much hop bitterness and flavor. Thin bodied and pretty simplistic tasting.

S: Smell is earthy, bread-like, big malty character too with a tinge of hops.  T: Strong earthy and biscuit like tones. I am not a fan of the big malty flavors of this brew. I know American Amber tends to have that, but I think they went a little overboard with it. Its not a bad beer but I wont drink it if I can avoid it.  M: Carbonation is pretty high and tingles my taste buds. The brew was kinda thick, just as an ale should be.  D: It becomes more drinkable as it warms but the taste alone just puts me off.  I just can't understand why some people have come to define this brew ""godsend."" Some may say if I don't like the style then I shouldn't have reviewed it. I defend my review in the fact that I have an open mind to every brew and that every good beer deserves a good shot.

So...Monday night, bowling, our lanes break down & the waitress offers us free beers. I order a Mothership Wit. And get a...Fat Tire.  Usually when I'm in the ""C"" range on brews, it's due to a lack of taste, or lack of distinction, with just nothing standing out. That's not the case here. Fat Tire tastes like its name. I'm always reminded of bicycle rubber & beer-soaked bread when I put this in my mouth, & it's not a real pleasant combo for me. It's weird & unique - but not in a good way.

This beer poured a nice amber/copper color and was extremely clear. There was next to nothing of a head, with very minimal, if any lacing. The smell was not entirely impressive, but not bad either - there just wasn't anything that jumped out. The flavor is a strong malt that is essentially the backbone of this beer, with a well supported hops to it. Reminded me more of an Oktoberfest though. It had a good, full body that somehow didn't leave me feeling full. The strong point of this beer is certainly its drinkability.

Appearance: A golden amber body with slight haze from the can conditioning. The dense white head holds well, clining to the walls of the glass. Solid.  Smell: Biscuits and light fruitiness. There's a bit of mustiness as well, something that always puts me off with this beer. Honey and pineapple come out as it warms.  Taste & mouthfeel: Rich with toasted malt flavor but well-attenuated.

Complex, but not what I'd say something that makes me salivate at the thought of drinking.  Tastes like crackers, probably the biscuit taste that everyone mentions. A very crisp finish and light hop bitterness. Not very complex, but enjoyable and fitting of the style.  Mouth is thin and carbonation is high. Anything else would make this beer undrinkable.

Lightly nutty initially, but as it warms, it develops into more of a grain flavor. Very light hint of pear fruitiness. Floral, spicy hop character with a light bitterness. Finishes dry and crisp.

Before I discovered microbrews and imports, this was the beer I drank when I was required by protocol or when I simply wanted a beer for some reason. As a result, I tend to judge everything else by a ""fat tire standard"". I try not to, but it's hard to break old habits. In any case, now that I have other REALLY good beers to drink, I tend to think of fat tire as distinctly average. It's not bad, and I'll certainly drink it when it's the best available. There are a couple of clubs in the area that serve fat tire on tap, and they just don't have anything better. In that case, it's a nice beer to drink for the evening. Appearance, smell, taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability are all average.

Very easy drinking session beer. Light on the hops.

192,607,angelmonster,4.18,"Nice one finger white head, clear amber in color. Lively in carbonation with nice head retention and great lacing  First smell is of some piny hops. Also some sweet malts and very faint alcohol aroma  First taste is of sweet roasted malt with some toffee or caramel. Very faint hop taste with a tiny bit of bitterness smoke at end.  Nice balance of carbonation. Light , smooth, and sweet going down.  Fat tire was one of the first craft beers i tried and still one of my favorites. Highly drinkable session beer.

192,607,toweringpoo,3.63,"Light, great flavor that's not too strong or overpowering in either direction; malt or hops. The malts are toasty and chocolatey. Kind of reminds me of a schwartz or or something. The hops are pretty light, just the right amount of bitterness to balance this one out. There's a bit of fruitiness coming through somewhere...I can't put my finger on it exactly but it reminds me of peach or apricot, just a hint. (after reading some other reviews i agree with the cherry comments as well) Really good session beer. Recommended.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,nick76,3.68,The aroma is both hoppy and malty. The appearance is light amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma with both caramel and biscuits. The palate is smooth.

192,607,olmatty,4.02,"Appearance- Pale Amber with a fluffy three finger head. Nice lace in glass  Smell- Hint of chocolate cherry and biscuit.  Taste- Medium sweetness with predominant flavors of chocolate cherry, biscuit maltiness. Hops are less apparrent among the malty qualities. Flavors are far less balanced in bottles than on draft.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied, very light amber for an amber ale  Drinkability- Bottles are quite drinkable. A good session beer. This beer is significantly better on draft.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Mild sweet bread and a tiny hop tingle. Nothing off here, which is amazing for a beer that is so mildly flavored.  m: Gently foamy carbonation.  d: A west coast Yuengling. Not bad, but not a stand out. This is a rare beer that is exactly what it wants to be.

Left several lace rings. Flowery scent.  Tastes light and fruity. Biscuity malt, and subtle pear and white grape juice flavors. I was expecting something intense but this is very mild and pleasing.

S: Caramel is the most prominent scent that stands out in this otherwise rather bland smelling amber.  T: As the smell indicated the most recognizable taste was that of caramel and a bread-like taste. As one reviewer said this is on the lower end of the medium bodied scale.  M: The beer stays carbonated and crisp throughout the entire drink and is smooth as it is consistent.  D: The beer's lightness does make for a very drinkable beer, one that could be drank easily for quite a period of time.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S: Nose not super strong, I pick up some malty/breadiness. Rather clean nose but not great.  T & M: It is funny because I used to not really care much for this beer or New Belgium in general. As my beer journey has progressed this has become my go-to session beer. There is something about this beer specifically with New Belgium that differentiates it from others. I believe it is the yeast but it really makes this beer special. It has this almost chocolate quality that goes along with the light breadiness. Finish is clean and crisp along with the mouthfeel.

Bottle pour, I much prefer this one on draft. Pours a simple looking orange/straw color, with a light white head. Aroma has a musty funk to it, but mostly just malt. The biscuit malt flavor in this one keeps in grainy and malty. It is very drinkable, and has a lot of basic flavors... so nothing over the top, but a good beer standard to keep around.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,turamarth,3.21,"Poured into my new New Belgium tulip glass w/ nucleation etching.  Appearance: Clear amber color, with a decent white foamy head that has really good lacing. The effect the nucleation point give is neat, a column of bubbles.  Nose: Some interesting hop smells at a first sniff. Not much malt in the nose.  Taste: Very malty with a very prominent biscuity flavor. There is some hoppy birghtness, not a lot though. Nothing too complex.  Mouthfeel: medium thin bodied. Has a fairly mild carbonation.  Drink: This is a pretty sessionable beer. I not entirely sold on it, but i can see how a lot of BCM people can be turned on by it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,KickInTheChalice,3.73,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a nice caramel / amber color, with a 3 cm head. Some of this head remains, especially in patches. Leaves a little lace on the glass.  Smell: Some cherries and a little bit of caramel sneak into the aroma, but the toasted malt is clearly the dominant smell.  Taste: The biscuit malt is the dominant flavor, from start to finish. The caramel and cherry flavors I noticed in the aroma are also present in the taste, but very muted. Towards the end I get a flash of hops but not nearly enough to overpower the malt. A very uncomplicated tasting beer, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is not very noticeable, but every sip finishes with quite a pleasant creamy smoothness.  Drinkability: As a fan of beers with a heavier dose of malt, this suits me well. It feels a little heavy to drink too many, but this would be good for a relaxed session.  It has actually been a while since I have had fat tire, as I burned out a little bit during its popularity explosion in Chicago. I am glad I went back and formally reviewed it. Although not a complicated brew, this has a simple, pleasant taste and feel. This also makes it a great beer to bring to the party; not intimidating nor exceedingly hoppy, but able to convert a few macro drinkers into aspiring beer geeks.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Everdrift,3.85,"Fat Tire amber is a great intermediate beer. I would recommend this beer for a person who has only had cheap macros. It wouldn't overwhelm an inexperienced palate, yet the flavors it has are definitely good. It has a brilliant coppery color, with a fine one-finger head that retains decently. The smell is bready and sweet. The taste is nothing exceptional, but again, what flavors are there don't disappoint. Malt flavor dominates, with a hint of hops that gives it some measure of balance. The mouthfeel is very light, watery for my tastes, but this would feel good in an inexperienced mouth. The drinkability is of course very high, you can quaff several of these quickly and easily. For your beer-helmet, beer bong chugging friends this is a great choice to introduce them to something a bit more classy.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

D - Drinkable to say the least.  I've had this many many time. I finally decided to put my thoughts on paper because of one strange day when Fat Tire would not leave me alone. I had one after a stressful day in mid afternoon. Went out to eat at Applebee's and there in the window greeting me was the Fat Tire neon sign. Had one with dinner. Then on the way home an empty Fat Tire bottle on the sidewalk! So of course I naturally had another waiting for me in the fridge.

The beer pours a very lovely deep gold-brown color, with a slight haze, almost like a wheat beer. There is a slight head that doesnt last long and very little lace. The smell reminds me of fresh baked biscuits. The taste is bready with a hint of some some sort of citrus. Overall it is a very drinkable beer from a great brewery.

Nice floral smell with hints of fruit and maybe a bit of caramel.  Tasted a hint of fruit, almost banana-like to me, nothing overbearing or overwhelming. Can taste the malt a bit and once again possible caramel.  Smooth brew, with a little carbonation feel and a bit of warmth when swallowing.

That I'm having a sort of hard time pinning down.  T: Tastes like roasty biscuits. The malt is all bread. Not a lot of sweetness, thankfully. Earthy hops in the back of the mouth. Pleasant, but nothing too exciting.  M: Most of the bite feels like it comes from the carbonation. But it's still nice and smooth.  D: A good session beer.

Lace and head, not to much to talk about  S: dominant toasted malt nose, caramel and cherry sweetness  T: toasted grains and biscuits malts. Sweetness makes me think of lightly toasted coconut paired with caramel. Big and burly toasted amber overall with no hops, or a dash of them, as my tongue tells me  M: carbonation jabs away at smoothness, toasty finish and lighter body are nice  D: to tip a few would be no problem, but it lacks in overall complexity, but thumbs up for a huge toasted malt flavor if that is your thing.

192,607,BeanBone,4.24,"Appearance: Clear, copper-orange body with a two-finger, off-white head that easily rises above the edge of the glass. Lacing is brilliant and really lasts.  Aroma: Fat Tire has always been a bit thin on the nose. What you can detect is sweet, biscuity malt and a whiff of citrus.  Taste: Lightly-roasted, sweet, biscuity malt is the center-piece of Fat tire. A subdued, earthly hop-bitterness helps to balance the malt. Occasional shades of booze at the finish. The biscuity malt endures in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, somewhat creamy, and medium-bodied. Carbonation is moderate, in keeping with the style.  Drinkability: I know for a fact that one can drink a twelve pack in the course of an evening. I guess that says it all really.  Verdict: Fat tire is a nicely balanced, biscuity Amber Ale.

It tastes like toasted malt, biscuit, peppery spice, ginger, nuts and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and has average carbonation.

192,607,SFLpunk,3.65,"Thanks to my girlfriend for bring me back this bomber and a matching pint glass from her recent trip to Fort Collins, CO.  22oz brown bottle, with freshness stamp on label (16JAN09). Poured into a Fat Tire pint glass.  Appearance: Bright amber and really clear. A thick, fluffy white head formed, and faded slowly leaving a little lacing, and a stable coat across the surface.  Nose: Roasted malt (I think of a really mild lapsang souchong), black tea, some fruity-esters. This is what I imagine a traditional British house to smell like around the holidays.  Palate: That roasty/smoked black tea thing is amazing and mingles with flavors of citrus and glazed pear tarts. The carbonation is rather light, and the beer is really balanced between bitterness and fruitiness. The underlying earthiness (tea) is a perfect addition to this amber ale. Way out on the finish, there is a note of nutmeg or clove.  Notes: A really drinkable beer, I see why people ask for it constantly out here on the East Coast (I've worked in Boston, and now in Burlington, VT). It packs a lot of flavor for a beer that seems very filtered and/or racked. I was expecting something more Belgian in style (this is my first experience with a New Belgium brew), but find it to be very British in character. Anyone else get that?

Mouthfeel is definitely the best part of this beer. Light bodied.  I have had this on tap and it is by far way better. On tap, the color is actually amber.

The Hops are secondary and mild. It's solid, not mind-blowing. A bit more roasted as it warms up. Hops are of the hallertauer/German variety.  It's a thick, creamy amber. Good to drink on an empty stomach. Goes well with a juicy burger. A solid beer.

Smell: A strong caramel, woody malt undertone that was accompanied by a faint fruitiness  Taste: Similar to the smell. Caramel malt and nuttiness are the main notes on this brew. I expected a bit of a hop bitterness at the end but instead I was greeted by a nice, spicy sweet finish.  Mouthfeel: Way too thin for the taste of this beer. Reminded me of rusty tap water at times and put me off of this beer. By and far Fat Tire's weakest point.  Drinkability: Would be very easy to drink these if not for the thin mouthfeel.

192,607,ProfessorHops,3.89,"Fat Tire  When first opening a bottle of Fat Tire by New Belgium, I wasn't blown away by the experience. Although the appearance was handsome, nothing quite as exciting as pouring a Belhaven Wee heavy or a Sam Smiths Nut Brown. Just seamed like an average amber ale esthetically.  I gave it the nose. It's aroma was remarkable. It had and abundance of fine wine or fresh fruit. I immediately then was interested in the brew. It been a while since the aroma of the a drink sparked my attention.  I then took my first swallow. A creative combination of sweet ale but not having to use an overzealous quantity of malt to achieve this flavor. Yes there was plenty of malt in the pallet, but more in the back than I am use to in an ale.  When ever encountering a ale that has this characteristics, it leads me to believe that the fine scrutinizing of raw materials and the sharp grasp of etiquette taking in the brewing process is present. I my be far off on my assumption. But this is the mind set I have taken over the years of beer tasting.  The finish was quick and moderate hop bitterness. Which most of time is a disappointment. In this brew though, it was a good compliment to the pallet. The pallet was very good, and I think a long bitter finish would have blown out the flam of the pallet.  Beer was bright and complex and drank easy. A lot of refreshment in this bottle.  Rarely do I encounter a beer I don't like. I am a beer lover. But I found this beer a special delight.

It is very flavorful, not too strong to have a few, and definitely a good alternative to other American ambers with its unusual chocolaty flavor.

It looks pretty good, being dark amber with a light tan, long-lasting, creamy head, slowly shrinking and leaving and fairly good lace.  The aroma is pleasant, caramelly grain and toast with faint hint of citrus.  It is very bland, being mostly a lightly sweet, faintly toasty-caramelly bread character. This persists pretty well, only degrading and thinning slightly, but it has just about nothing else, with almost no perceptible hop character or bitterness.

Candy sweet malts, with slight sweet tart notes from the nose invade first followed by an excellent hop balance. Other notes of nuts, melon, grass and semi-spicy yeast. Balanced and very drinkable.

The smell is fruity and somewhat raisin-like. I attribute this to the combination of hops and an assertive malt, reminds me of special B, but I don't think that's what they use. The biscuity-caramel malt shines in the taste though it is somewhat thin in mouthfeel. This is the prototypical jack-of-all-trades beer.

Nothing really stood out.  The taste is good and the toasted malt comes through. It is a very smooth beer to drink. There is not a bit of after taste with this beer.

Carbonation is a little soft which makes it come across as a bit thin (though it does have a little bite right off the tip of the tongue).

Besides having the Government warning and refund values, it has a lengthy paragraph on how the beer's name came about, flavor notes, ABV%, correct glassware, proper serving temperature, a best before date, and even a batch number. They packed everything you would want to know about this beer onto this little label.  This Amber Ale poured a...well it poured an amber color. What else would it be? There was some orange in there as well, but that didn't subtract from it's solid amber color. It had an average less than 1/2 an inch white head of foam sitting on top of it. This head of foam actually had pretty good retention that left behind a skim of white foam and a streak or two of lace around the glass.  The smell coming from this beer was simple and light with some lightly toasted caramel malts, a speck of juicy fruits, and a small touch of peppery hops at the end. It was an Average Amber aroma. Nothing more.  The taste was also plain and simple, but at least it had some flavor to it. The taste was nice and toasty with toasted caramel malts, a hint of bitter hops, and a slight touch of yeast at the finish. I had a couple of bottles of this and the only thing that changed in the taste was the level of toasted caramel malts and yeast. It was a very consistent beer.  This was clearly a light bodied beer that was high on the carbonation, but had a decent aftertaste of toasted caramel malts and a tiny touch of bitter hops. It was a very easy drinking beer.  In the end, Fat Tire makes a nice choice for a crossover beer. It contained more flavor than a regualr macro, but it didn't have an overwhelming amount of flavor to it.

The beer has a slightly sweet flavor profile, with just enough hops to keep it in balance. Drinkability is high; abv. is at most an afterthought.

Fairly complex and very nice Taste is of grainy sweetness, with the bread flavors coming through. Touch of caramel sweetness at the end is cut nicely with some hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is really nice, smooth and lightly creamy. Touch watery on the finish though. Could drink this quite often, if I could get it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,dgriffis,3.8,"This beer has a medium body, nice balance of hops to malt... the finish is roasty sweet. As you drink it down and it loses its chill it gets better, so cellar temp is optimum serve temp for this beer. very solid beer out of the bottle, but better on tap.

192,607,beerindulger,3.63,Apperance is a darker amber color kind of like an old brass door knob with a nice head that lingers for a short while. Smell is good kind of a bread or biscuity aroma with some lite fruit or honey mixed in. Taste very drinkable with a little bite wich is gone almost as soon as you notice it and replaced with a smooth finish. Mouthfeel bread like I guess that's from the malt not much hoppiness. Smooth in the mouth not much carbonation. Drinkability Very drinkable but not anything to write home about fills you up fast also.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Something in the nose is a little off as well, almost smells like burnt grain.  T - Toasted malt taste; biscuity. Very light hop presence; earthy and spicy hops. The balance just does not line up and has a somewhat off flavor.  M/D - Medium bodied and very smooth. An easy drinker but not the best taste.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The smell is of soft biscuity dough with light citrus. Mild.  The taste is biscuity. A slight bitterness balances a soft, almost toasty mild maltiness in the sweetish, pretty clean, finish.  Light-bodied and somewhat creamy.  Inoffensive, mild, biscuity. Not much to this one. Pretty mediocre overall. Not bad, but I can think of plenty other amber ales with more character.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,nrpellegrini,4.1,How could a brown ale be so good? This was one of the top things I looked forward to doing/ trying on my trip from Baltimore to Las Vegas. The smoothest most flavorful brown ale out there. A lot of flavor but not enough to knock your mouth out. The constant head gives it a great aroma through the entire drink. Just the right amount of malt and hop flavors.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,NatetheGreat,3.58,"First time trying Fat Tire, I do really enjoy NB beers:  A: lighter than I expected, an orange-amber translucent hue with nice fluffy white head.  S: weaker aroma, some oily hops and doughy notes  T: very well balanced, spot on Amber Ale. Clean oily hops followed by bready, semi-sweet maltiness. Many have called it ""biscuity"" and I can see that. Very refreshing.  D: wow, this goes down like water...almost. It's very smooth, moderate carbonation, unnoticable alcohol, and with a pleasant taste, it's just really easy to knock back a few. Good beer, although NB had several stronger offereings. This would be a crowd pleaser even for people not familiar with craft beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,diabecktic,3.83,"Apperance: The color is a beautiful dark red/amber. The head formation and retention are moderate, but there is great lacing. It looks pretty appetizing (or whatever the liquid equivalent to that is).  Smell: The aroma is quite sweet with a hint of bitterness. I'm not quite sure what the sweetness is due to (toffee?/orange?), but it somewhat resembles a freshly baked loaf of bread or roll. Either way, it's not a bad scent (even though I can't quite difinitatvely figure out what it is)  Taste: This brew is quite sweet and not at all bitter. I know the smell is a bit bitter, but the bitterness is hardly present in the taste. Again, I can't quite figure out what the sweetness is due to, but I think it might be honey/malt.  Mouthfeel: It feels quite light in the mouth. Bitterness is lacking, as is carbonation, but it still feels good before it goes down.  Drinkability: This beer goes down incredibly smoothly and has a slightly creamy finish to it. It would be quite easy to chug; however, since it tastes pretty good, I wouldn't suggest doing so, (do whatever you feel, though).  Summary: I suppose this beer is somewhat ""legendary"" - or at least worthy of something like a cult following (at least where I'm from). To me it doesn't seem exceedingly special, but it seems like a great beer to throw down if you're tired of the standard fare. Again, I'd advise against doing so since you really should appreciate the flavor and not merely try to get wasted (it's also a bit expensive for solely that).",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Beefeater57,4.47,"A: light copper color with a sudsy head, retained through each sip.  S: I get a lot of a fresh biscuit smell, and a nutty smell, like almond or cashew.  T: Very balanced, has a malt sweetness that is heavily characterized by the biscuit malt, and there is just enough hops to balance it out. Hops are noticeable but not overpowering. The toasty nuttiness is there, and I do enjoy the biscuit character. Definitely get the biscuit/nutty taste with this.  M: Not bad, borderline watery but still good. Carbonation levels are perfect.  D: I'm from Colorado, where Fat Tire is almost on kitchen sink tap, so I definitely have a great appreciation for this beer. One of my favorite beers to drink, and a great example of a balanced ale. Great malty sweetness with good hops. Always have them in my fridge, a truly delicious beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Beer poured a nice dark amber color that reminded me of maple wood. Decent head with many different sized bubbles  S- Smells good with a sweet malt carried by a hint of fruits(mostly grape)  T- Tastes excellent with a balance of fond malts and a hint of fragrant hops and light fruits  M- Feels excellent with a smooth medium body and ample carbonation  D- Drinks good with a refreshing aftertaste,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,HalfFull,2.86,"From a 12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic glass. Pours a clear orange amber hue with a decent looking but short lived head. Lacing is well represented yet thin and fleeting.  Smell is overwhelmingly of hazelnut and burnt malts. Smells like Frangelico. This is a rather popular beer so I guess some people like that in a beer. I don't care for it.  Tastes of biscuity roasted malts. Medium bodied yet concludes with that roasted malt and nut flavor I so don't enjoy, and it is a bit thin. I call the drinkability average because I'm already numbing my taste buds. One thing this brew has going for it is the lack of over the top sweetness common in some ambers. Perhaps it could use a little more.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Choppr,4.11,"I live on the East coast, so this is not something I can easily get my hands on. I have heard from several of my fellow beer aficinado's that this is certainly a favorite out west, so when I got the chance to try it, I was all over it. I think I was expecting too much from it...  Beautiful amber color when poured into a glass. Very clean smell, almost sweet, and a solid head with small to medium sized bubbles/lacing.  Taste was a very nice balance of malt and hops... I think a relatively strong hoppy aftertaste compared to other ambers, but not at all unpleasant.  This brew goes down easy. Not too strong, so you don't have to worry about it sneaking up on you as you will be following it up with another, and another.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Appearance:  Pours out a nice medium brown with a hint of red with a frothy white head. Nice lacing forms as well down the glass.  Smell:  I smell a sweetness from the malt, almost fruity, as well as definite yeast.  Taste:  Toasted malt, tastes like warm bread. A slight bitterness in the aftertaste, but not that much.  Mouthfeel:  Fantastic. So smooth in the mouth and goes down easy. Carbonation is perfect. Perfect score in this area for me.  Overall, this is a fantastic session beer. Not the best beer in the world and some would say overhyped, but I think it deserves all the praise it gets. Well balanced, sooo drinkable, and down right tasty.

192,607,THEBEERBAR0N,4.02,"Poured into an American style pint glass out of a 12oz bottle. Provides a 1-finger white head which takes a little while to dissipate. There is decent lacing. The color is copper-amber-gold, and clear when held to the light. A little light in color actually I thought.  Smell is rich and malty- the chocolate malts definitely comes through with a lot of toasted biscuit. Hops are tucked away and come through somewhat earthy.  The taste is similar to the smell, with a lingering malty and somewhat phenolic tasting finish.  The feel of this beer is very nice, slightly slick and thick with a lingering chewiness on the palate.  Drinkability is a high, though a little malty in taste and feel compared to some other ambers, like Boont and Alaskan.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Loads of malty sweetness and well-balanced hops. Close to perfection. A crowd-pleaser.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,xare,3.95,"Was able to locate a few bottles of Fat Tire while on vacation in Texas - bought a sixer and drank 5 of them. Definitely well worth the investment.  Appearance looks very nice (I never got a chance to pour it out of the bottle, so this is based on the bottle itself and what glimpses I could get from the action inside the bottle). Excellent head and retention inside the bottle though.  Smell is a bit tangy with hops, malts, and some other ""bready"" aromas that intermingle to create an overall pleasing aroma.  Taste is simply quite unique. I've never really had a beer before that actually tasted quite ""biscuity"". There's some real meat on the bones and it's got touches of malt and just a bit of hops at the end. I like the flavor of Fat Tire! But it's just a bit offbeat enough that I wouldn't always want this beer.  Mouthfeel was nice - really chewy, carbonated decently, and smooth for the most part. I didn't have any problems drinking this beer but it didn't make me want to gulp it like a fish.  Drinkability is excellent. I was able to use this as a session beer and also very glad to have found this beer. If I could get it in Ohio, I'd make it a part of my rotation but I'm unable to locate this without going to extremes.

I'm a bit biased because my junior year of college Fat Tire taught me what beer could be.  Pours a clear amber with a rich white head.  Smells a bit malty, slightly bread like.  Tastes, wonderful.Nice and smooth and well balanced.  The mouthfeel is pretty great too, perfect carbonation and not too heavy.

This pours out a rich deep amber color with a huge fluffy head and plentiful carbonation. Shelves of lacing down the glass throughout.. Awesome!  Beautiful aroma of warm fresh baked bread, rich and malty backed with the faintest of hops. Smells very inviting..  Oh, man I'm in love here. Rich, malty deliciousness that reminds me of a loaf of warm fresh buttered loaf of bread. The richness of the malt tastes wonderful going down.  Ok, I've found a new favorite session brew in this. It pretty much everything I look for in a session brew...delicious, not too heavy, and goes well with anything.  Hooray New Belgium!

Nice hops taste and mouth-feel with some complex flavors (chocolate?) and some caramel after notes. Fairly low on carbonation as evidenced by the thin head, but, tasty nevertheless. I am a fan of belgian ales, and while this really doesn't qualify (brewer's name non-withstanding), I find it to be highly drinkable in the same manner.

I also detected a hint of sulfur in there, that I wasn't too thrilled about.  The taste starts with light sweet malt followed by a bit of spiciness from the hops. Not much bitterness. Some nice breadiness on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-thing with medium-high carbonation.

Slight brown sugar sweetness. Hops make an appearance in the finish playing a balancing role, then biscuit flavor ties things up.  Notes: Very mild and very drinkable. A solid crossover brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,KBomb,3.9,"Fat Tire shines a beautiful red-copper with one finger of head on top. The smells of sweet biscuit, faint hops, and tiny bit of citrus and spice. The taste is about what you can imagine: rich balanced flavors of American Amber Ale. There are no flavors out of the ordinary save for a hint of apple or pear at the very end of a sip. Moderately high carbonation brightens the flavors quite a bit. Not too heavy.  This is a good beer for being a consistent good character, not for any particular innovation of flavor. Caramel malts that are well balanced produce a very drinkable beer that rarely dissapoints, even if it doesn't particularly excite. It is not hard to drink more than a few of these. Detractors have taken to ""poo-pooing"" this brew-- you gotta know going into this thing that it aint no DIPA or Imperial whatever. It is what it wants to be, a quality amber ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The smell has notes of sweet malt, some biscuit, and somwe nuttiness. Also a faint nose of citrus.  The taste follows the nose and the samples I've had in bottles except I think there's more of the nutty character here and that's what I like about drinking it on tap at the brewery when I visit. Still not as good as there but, it's tasty and pretty drinkable and if the cans show up in Casper some day, I'll buy some.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Texture is smooth, making this a very enjoyable ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Gehrig,3.98,"I grabbed this at the sterling Sun Singer with lunch today. A full finger of white foam tops a brown body with golden highlights. Good lacing on the pint glass. Modest chocolate and caramel malts, all lightly toasted. Somewhat floral hopped tasted with rather bitter malt, like a peppery butterscotch, I like the combination and the more bitter taste was a pleasant surprise. Creamy with moderate hop texture is quite good also.

Perfectly fine as a drink to quench your thirst and to get drunk but do not expect anything special.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Rayek,3.6,A: Slightly hazy copper colored beer. White head is small and doesn't retain particularly well. Small carbonation bubbles. Left only small spots of lace.  S: Fruity and malty. Caramel sweetness plus hints of apple and lemon.  T: Toasted and caramel malts up front. Hops add a well balanced bitterness and nice lemon tartness. Finishes fairly clean with residual lemon and biscuit flavors.  M: Medium body with just the right amount of fizz. A little slick on the tongue.  D: Good session brew. Not particularly daring.

Most restaurants carry this as a micro-brew alternative, but I found it rather uninteresting. It has a nice copper color, but the head was flat, as was the aroma. There was a bit of initial bite from the carbonation and some hoppy attributes, but overall I'd rate it an escape hatch rather than something to seek out.

192,607,Kyle987,3.9,"Dull orangish-tan body, with an average head that stuck around the edges until the end. Decent lacing.  Smell was very fresh, and, as another reviewer said, subtle. A little bit of hops, a little bit of malt.  Taste was very pleasant, but not remarkable in any particular way; a good balance of malt and hops.  I really enjoyed the mouthfeel; a solid fullness, but not heavy, and when you swallow it down it leaves you strangely both satisfied and wanting more.  Nothing here is really incredible, but everything comes together to make a very good, extremely drinkable beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

But all of these are barely detectable and combine for a uniquely crafted beer. On tap it is super mega drinkable, and it just disapears in my glass. It is a really light amber, not a big hoppy red if that is what you are after.  Kind of odd that I like this one so much, I usually demand more character from a brew. I think I just really appreciate the delicate balance of it.  I have had excellent success homebrewing this one.

Faint semi-sweet biscuity aroma. Good but nothing special.  Has a slight grassy hop bitterness finish to compliment the same light sweetness that was apparent in the nose.

Well, my impression of normal FT is that it is a decent beer with a 'bloody nose' aftertaste.  On to the can.. On opening, it sounded just like a SKA Brewing ESB or a Dales Pale. Nothing spectacular. Smells just like it should, be it on tap from the brewery or in the bottle. I think the taste might be a little better, as I didn't get as much of the aftertaste, but I admit that's probably the can doing its job of snuffing out my sniffer.

The head fades fast leaving a film on the top of the beer and some lacing on the side of the glass. There is a deep clear amber color to it. Light passes through easily with no problems.  I had difficulty making out the full scent of the beer initially. The scent was not weak, just very subtle. There was a pleasant combination of malts with a citrus accent. The taste was very mild. It had a light malt flavor with a mild hop backbone. There was just a hint of bitterness that enhanced the flavor. There is almost no aftertaste.  This is a medium bodied beer with a light carbonation to it.

Compared to many of the exotics from Belgium and other American microbreweries Fat Tire really isnt that impressive, but it is a clean crisp refreshing ale that you can drink all day any day and never get sick of. The flavor isnt overpowering, just a light sweet combination of malt, spices and hops. One of my biggest torments in life is that NB isnt sold in New Jersey, and isnt likely to be any time soon.

Here is my biggest problem with this beer. It smells and tastes like sour milk. Not bad milk, just slightly soured milk and I get it from every pint/bottle of Fat Tire that I drink. I don't know if it's my odd senses or if there is some soured Lactose put in the wort. I find it so dominating that the soured milk smell overwhelms everything else. The taste is much the same, but its not as dominating. There are also roasted grains, and a bit of sweet chocolate that comes through in the finish.

192,607,diamondc,4.15,"Pours a nice, reddish amber, clear copper color. Excellent head retention with a steady stream of bubbles.  The aroma reminds me of Christmas... cookies baking in the oven, cinnamon, nutmeg, fruitcake. I don't get much fruitiness or hop aroma though.  The taste is sweet and spicy .. a bit of roasted-ness .. with some faint fruit aftertaste. No really big flavors here, but its all in balance (well, could use a bit more hops, but they save it for 2º Below).  The lack of big flavors and medium abv makes Fat Tire an excellent session beer. On tap though, I find it a bit smoother. Still, it's a great reliable 'gateway' or 'stand-by' beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,merryjoulton,4.36,This is an exceptional brew. Appearance is a light amber color that is impeccably transparent. The smell is just a divine blend of hops balanced with a perfect proportion of malt. I can absolutely sense the influence of Belgian yeast in this one. Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability all go hand in hand as incredible balance and Belgian influence come into play here. This is a superb interpretation of the Belgian style by New Belgium and I highly recommend it to every beer drinker as such.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SurlyDuff,3.97,"New Belgium's flagship beer. I've had this countless time, just getting around to a review.  Not just a typical amber, for NB has a tendacy to almost belgianize it with their propietary yeast.  Biscuity malt presence, with some honey/caramel sweetness. Good medium body with a light fruity and sweet floral/nectar hop presence.  A superb session beer in every respect. The perfect fall-back, and in my opinion it's better in bottles than on tap, maybe something to do with conditioning?",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Realale,4.2,"Medium copper in color with some nice red highlights. Very fine bright white head leaves nice lace. A good-looking beer here.  Nose is slightly caramelly malt, over fresh-baked biscuit. Some slight yeasty spiciness too - touch of anise, bit of lavender. This is much better than I remember Fat Tire being.  Medium in the mouth with waves of pretty complex malt. Lots of biscuity goodness and some fresh baked bread. The caramelly notes keep to a supporting role, and the spicy yeast notes add additional complexity. The yeast notes are quite reminiscent of De Koninck, which is a very good thing in my book.  Carbonation is enough to keep the malt lively. Very drinkable, where this beer used to wear on me after half a glass. The biscuit/caramel notes seem in much better balance than before. The only reason I re-tasted this one after all these years was because it was in my sampler pack, but I find myself really enjoying it. Best before: 22Aug08.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BeerImmediately,3.3,"Saw this in a couple places while in Nevada, so had to get a 6.  Pours a reddish-orange, ""whiskey"" color, with a low head and minimal lacing.  Decent smell... little nutty with some sweetness.  Taste was unique - very malty, with a slightly burnt biscuit flavor, and narry a hop note.  Mouthfeel was rather rich & thick, causing drinkability to be good, but not great for the style.  Props to New Belgium for a unique edge on the style. DEfinitely interesting - give this one a try!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,PhageLab,3.7,"I drank a lot of this stuff during my stay in Nevada, it is literally everywhere you go, and decently cheap. Served on tap in a standard pint glass.  A - Rich caramel/reddish coloration, decent head of froth, good retention, spotted lacing.  S - Sweet malt aroma, with a spicy finish.  T - Sweet caramel malt body, slight hop tinge, not very complex but pretty tasty.  M - Light bodied, sharp carbonation level, clean finish.  D - Pretty tasty, it's like Yuengling with a little more flavor in it. While this isn't anything to rave about, it's a great session brew and a shoe-in over most of the other tap choices in Las Vegas.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

I couldn't place any hop aroma.  T: Roasted biscuit flavor, malty. Slight hoppy aftertaste.  M: Light carbonation, crisp flavor. This one never lets me down.

192,607,babyhobbes,3.79,"Pours a small white head and a light honey color. Highly drinkable brew. Sweet with a slight hoppy balance, mainly malt. Scent somewhat fruity.

192,607,ByTor2112,4.07,"Thanks to Tom Wood for this one! Pours a great color, light Amber with some orangey hues coming through with the light. A nice foamy head forms and lingers with active carbonation, bubbles constantly rising. Aroma-sweet like apricots with some hay like aromas-very pleasing. Mouthfeel- sweet malty flavor, medium hops with no bite. A slight chocolate flavor at the end of the finish when the tongue is pressed to the roof of the palate. I know this Amber is their flagship but it is very tasty, satisfying and quaffable. This could be my go-to brew if it were available here.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Risser09,3.52,"12 oz bottle poured into a wine goblet - 06 | July | 2007 - Cellar temp  Appearance: Pours a transparent golden/yellow/orange with a thick 2"" head that is off-white. Active carbonation shoots streams of tiny bubbles towards the surface. Thick, foamy head with tons of lace. Excellent.  Smell: Biscuits with butter, malt and oatmeal. I can't discern an hop aroma at this point which is contrary to the bottle description.  Taste: More biscuits generate a chewy and satisfying flavor. Not very much hop taste. Not very complex.  Mouthfeel: Chewy and very creamy. Smooth. No noticeable alcohol. Pretty quenching.  Drinkability: Very good. Perhaps this one was too old to show off its hop character. A decent brew worth trying and repeating.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jeonseh,3.03,"Poured from a bottle into my GI Tulip  A - A light, kinda watery amber color and can see the carbonation trailing up the middle of this one. Has a nice one finger head that sits on top and sticks around throughout the beer.  S - Smells rather biscuity and can tell the yeasty aspect of the beer. Also has a hint of orange that comes up as well and gives the beer a slight citrus scent.  T - The first taste is of orange peel and that quickly fades away into a taste that is a bit hard to describe but almost taste a bit like a dark grape and a shortbread cookie. Also has a bit of a roasted nut flavor in there as well It is an interesting and unique taste but one that I don't really care for too much. Can definitely taste a hint of hops in there that sits around in the aftertaste and get the hint of biscuit and caramel but it just doesn't really do it for me. Something seems a bit out of whack and even has a hint of sourness which seems out of place. The aftertaste has a slight orange peel taste to it.  MF - Mild carbonation and a bit thin in the body. The carbonation does end up calming down and turning the MF into a very creamy aspect that makes the beer feel smooth and makes your mouth feel rather full.  D - Overall, I can see why some people get all up in arms over this beer and It would make a nice gateway beer for BMC drinkers. I think the unique flavor profile makes this beer one of those beers that you are either going to really like or be a bit indifferent about it. I happen to fall into the indifference category on this one. It is a beer that I would drink if it was around and definitely before some of the BMCs but I would never go out and buy it on my own.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,joepais,3.86,Thanks to JVD for this one Bottle poured into a pint glass produced a good two fingers worth of head on top of a clear amber body Aromas of bread malts and a light hop floral The taste of sweet malt with a slight hop finish fills your mouth. Good carbonation and crisp on the tongue Had to try this one after watching the beer movie An interesting take on an amber ale would drink it again if I could. A good solid brew,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,beeragent,3.83,"Not sure if New Belgium changed their recipe for this brew, or if my taste has changed that much, but this beer is alot better than I remember it being. Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a medium amber, forming a thick 1 inch off-white head, leaving a good amount of light lacing. The smell is a light aroma of sweet malt, giving it a light nutty aroma. The taste starts off with a good amount of sweet malts up front, followed by the same light nutty/buttery flavor, and finishing with a hint of hops. Relatively light mouthfeel. For a sessionable ale, this hits the spot. Good flavor and alcohol level. Overall, as stated before, I'm not sure if I've changed or if th ebrewery has, but this isnt nearly as bad as I used to think. I will definitely try this again to confirm.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,everetends,3.75,"This is my beer of choice when I visit friends in Texas because I have not been able to find it in Alabama.  Appearance is a light amber, almost orange presentation with good head retention.  Smell is a sweet bread with a hint of hops and malt.  Taste is a bit hoppy, but I am a fan of hops so it doesn't bother me.  Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Carbonation isn't bad and overall a good feel.  Drinkability is great. I usually go to Dallas during the summer months and this a good all around, refreshing beer. Doesn't get old and is not too heavy. Big fan.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,cswhitehorse,3.21,The Fat Tire which is a local beer it seems like with the distribution in the NW. It poured a clear amber color with sweet big lacing and a solid finger foam head.  The aroma was toasty biscuity smells. The taste was a bready backbone with a hop bitterness on the finish. It was semi crisp but other than that didn't leave much on the mouth feel. Overall a pretty run of the mill beer and it tasted better colder than warm which is usually not the norm.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Portertime,4.5,I get so many requests for this beer down here in Florida I wish they would ship south! I was lucky to finally try this brew in a bar across from The Art Institute in Chicago. I was wunderbar! Had a nice intense reddish color. Smelled a nice fruity malts and a kiss of hops. Tasted smooth and nice on the tongue with well balanced malt and hops. A very nice addition to the awesome Guiness hamburger I had a the bar.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,toolbrew,3.95,I've had this beer many times and even driven across several states to get it.  Pours a light amber color with a thick white foamy head. Lots of carbonation.  Sweet malty smell with some citrus aroma.  Nice malty taste with hints of apple. The malt taste tends to linger afterwards.  My tongue is mostly affected by the brew. Not much stimulation on the roof or back of the mouth.  Great session beer.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,DesMoinesMike,4.1,"Poured into a pint glass. Had a medium amber color with a 1/2 finger of head. Had a pleasant malty smell.

192,607,JEdmund,3.36,"Appearance More orange than amber; easy to pour head--one inch+; lots of carbonation bubbles; clear; good head retention and it leaves some lacing; very impressed overall with the appearance, aside from the color, which looks a little off, but may be because of lighting  Aroma Mild, sweet and bready, a little fruity, and a touch of hops; not a whole lot to entice me  Taste & Mouthfeel Upfront sweetness that lasts the whole way through; mild maltiness and nearly no hop bitterness; very clean, but also pretty thin in body; caramel becomes more present as it warms; pleasant and sweet, but not something I'd want more than one of at a time  Overall I had discredited this beer a long time ago as having very little flavor or personality (for a craft brew), but since reviewing it, I stand corrected. It does have flavor, though it's on the weak side. It's certainly not a bad beer nor a bad example of an amber ale, but I've had better ambers I'd go to before this one again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,bradybeer,3.8,"Pours a orange amber with a rocky white head. I detect a faint hop aroma-taste is good, slight malt character with a nice hop bitter in the finish.

None the less, good go to beer for hanging out around the house",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Beerbuddha,3.5,"OK so I now get to try the infamous Fat Tire! The beer poured a great coppery, golden color with a huge off white head. The aroma had a nice malty sweetness and biscuit note as well. Slight smell of hops. The taste was similat to the smell. Maltiness dominates with hint of hops. Mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall not bad but a little over hyped. The way people talk about this beer is that it's the most incredible beer in the world. I find it to be average but good.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,claytri,3.95,"The beer pours a light amber with a nice bit of red to the tint, also it has a nice rocky white head that soon becomes a very nice lace.

S: Biscuity malts, light citrus hops, and a wee bit of yeast.  T: Caramel, toasted biscuity malts.  MF/D: Mild bodied and smooth, this beer is exceedingly drinkable. Very pleasant. It's hyped a lot as a ""gateway"" to microbrews, like Sierra Nevada and Anchor Steam, and I can see why. The toasted malt flavour might be more my cup of tea than some folks, but this is one of my favourite tasty refreshing adult beverages of all time.  A great standby choice in any bar that serves it, since it seems to be most spots' ""craft"" beer of choice, against the big watery boys.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Good staying power and a significant amount of lacing.  Smell is of sweet biscuit-like and toasted malt, yeast, and floral hops.  Taste mimics the nose for the most part. Sweet toasted malts with a nice floral hop palate, with just a touch of honey.  The alcohol is hidden extremely well, very smooth with no noticeable aftertaste.

Taste: Follows the smell, bready, but also a sweet caramel flavor and a touch of tea-like bitterness at the end.  Drinkability: Easy to have several in a sitting if I'm not looking for hops.  New Belgium's flagship beer is definitely one to use to indoctrinate people to craft brewing. More flavorful than the macros but no overpowering flavors to turn people off.

It's not gourmet, or something overly special. What is it? An excellent beer for relaxing, hanging out at the sports bar, or drinking after mowing the lawn.  Appearance: Beautiful, clear, rich amber color. It has a nice frothy head, and average lacing on the glass.  Smell: You can smell grain, somewhat floral rosy hops, and a sweet biscut like malt flavor. Not an overly strong scent.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Mild and sweet, smooth. Mild body. Smooth and refreshing.

Tastes of rich dark caramel without being overly sweet, but it is sweet. No sign of hops, all malts here.  Good presence in the mouth with more body than I anticipated. Pretty smooth.  I could drink quite a few of these. Share this with an inexperienced beer drinker and they'll probably be impressed.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,HardTarget,4.21,"Aroma: Unique deep dark wet grain aroma that no other beer has. Very earthy, leafy, organic.  Appearance: Great clarity with the definition of amber color. Creamy white head with massive retention and glass coating lace.  Flavor: Much lighter than the aroma leads you to believe.

Mouthfeel: Medium light body, moderate carbonation, slightly rough texture, slow drying finish.  Overall Impression: A hallmark of craft beer, rightfully well known and generally respected.

Appearance: The pour is amber-copper with a frothy white head.  Smell: The nose is mostly semi-sweet biscuity malts with a little bit of grain and a smidgen of floral hops.  Taste: Take a few swigs of Firestone Pale Ale, a drop or two of Piraat, then eat an unsalted biscuit with a little peanut butter and a small dab of honey. As soon as you burp, you'll get this flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: It's light, verging on medium bodied and smooth, almost creamy, with soft carbonation.  Drinkability: Fat Tire has a double whammy. It's a flavor profile that I usually don't enjoy and it's not good enough to be tasty in spite of it. I had two vintages of La Folie and they were unbelievable.

Very heavy on the roasted or toast flavor with a slight sweetness of brown sugar or molasses on the backside. M - Medium carbonation, and close to medium body, but not quite. A little watery when swallowed, but not bad. Not much hop bite and finishes with a light aftertaste of burnt toast then fades. D - Pretty good beer. I can see why it's popular.

S- The smell is the weakest component of this beer- mainly because it's just weak. There's a light toasty huskiness to it with perhaps the slightest citrus, but I could def use more in the scent department.  T- A great balance of malty sweetness, with some tones of honey adding to the light malt- slightly toasty, and slightly husky- and then good earthy hops, which remind me of freshly turned dirt, in a good way.

Flavor is sweet and malty: a good start. Unfortunately, the ""crisp hopiness"" described by the brewer didn't appear, leaving instead a somewhat cloying taste. Not bad, but a touch more hops in the finish would have cut through the sweetness much better.  Widely available and easy to drink, so it's a possibility in most bars and restaurants.

An evenly balanced hop side after the swallow. Finishes clean, just a hint of leftover bitterness.  Mouthfeel - crisp, even-bodied, good levels for the style.  Drinkability - easily sessionable, a good amber for any season. Cheers to my sis-in-law for bringing this one across the miles. Thanks Cathy!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,katan,3.98,"22oz bomber, dated feb 2008  A - Pours a dark golden brown color. Very clear - no haze. Has a moderate amount of carbonation that dissipates quickly. Obviously an amber ale.  S - The smell is dominated with roasted specialty malts. Not much for hops there.  T - Doesn't initially hit me with much flavor. Perhaps a balance of some malt flavors balanced by a light bitterness. But then it changes quickly. Finishes with a sweet chocolate flavor. Seems sweeter than most that I've drank.  M - Smooth mouthfeel - almost creamy. Not overcarbonated.  D - I could drink this rather easily. It agrees with my stomach and has the alcohol of a session beer.  I know that people tend to give Fat Tire a hard time since its almost the proverbial ""macro"" craft beer. But I have to say it is still quite enjoyable, and for the price, its hard to find better value.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mwilbur,3.73,"Poured from 22oz bottle into NBB snifter. A: Golden amber hue with a perfect 2 finger creamy white head. Nice. S: Mild hop aroma with grain essence. T: Nice dry bite initially giving way to sweet hops, toast, and mild citrus note. Not very complex though. M: First sip has a dry bite, but very smooth with every sip--or gulp--after. A little light on the tongue and taste quickly dissipates. D: Quite drinkable. Good sessionability. Goes down easy. This comes from a fan of NBB...but...I believe Fat Tire is a little over-hyped. It's a good beer, but not great. NBB has several better offerings (La Folie, Abbey, etc.). That being said, I do enjoy the fact that it is now available in MN and will definitely revisit it from time to time.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,trentley87,3.5,"Enjoyed a pint of this on-tap at The Local in Minneapolis.  A: Average appearance. Nice amber color. Average head/retention/lacing. Nothing overwhelming.  S: Very mild...some malts are present but not picking up many cues from the aroma of this one.  T: In keeping with the rest of the beer -- remarkably average. Nice malty sweetness with just a little hops kick and maybe a hint of citrus. Kinda yeasty throughout, but especially in the aftertaste.  M: A little on the thin side for my tastes.  D: Better than any macro but I expected more with what I've been hearing about New Belgium. I probably won't be seeking this out again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,shertz,4.25,"Had this both on tap and in the bottle while on a working trip to the Mid-West. Orange in color, with lots of bubbles and lacing. Smell was fruity, maybe grapefruit. Taste was very balanced between citrus hops and sweet malts. Drinkability was good except I hadn't eaten in 12 hours and drank a few with my meal and felt them pretty quick. I would love to visit this one again and maybe homebrew a clone. Always heard good things about the brewery and this beer. Both are right on. Tasty brew.

192,607,Vixie,2.92,"A: Nice white head, was a nice copper color with a hint of red.  S: Not much smell at all, nothing stood out to me.  T: Starts out malty and sweet, finishes with a note of hops. Taste does not linger long. There is a slight sweetness to it, just a touch of fruit notes before the hops kick in at the finish.  M: Slightly thin, but not too bad. I'd say about average.  D: Not an outstanding brew, but not a horrible one either. This to me is something you'd drink with food when you're not too concerned about how good a beer you have, but want something better than the mass market beers. However, if I was wanting something above average or special, this beer would not fit the bill. I've had 2 Below Ale by New Belgium, and I'd consider it much superior to Fat Tire.

192,607,Squelch,3.24,Appearance: Beautiful amber color with sparkling carbonation and an off white billowy head.  Smell: Fruity esters dominate with a slight malt backbone.  Taste: The crystal/biscuit flavors meld well with the earthy hop flavors. tastes grainy to me.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with some astringency in the end. No puckering though  Drinkablity: Good drinkability. Has great balance and finishes clean.

Small, realtively light-colored head  S--Pleasant toasty, malty scent.  T--Welcoming biscuity taste, as advertised. Simple but not boring. Mellow maltiness with a barely detectable hop finish for balance.  M--Moderate carbonation, but it isn't trying to cover anything up. Kind of a dry mouthfeel--but in a good, clean way.  D--Hell yeah! An approachable session beer for just about anybody. I can see why this is so popular.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

D - This is a very good, enjoyable beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,littleshamrocks,3.6,"12 oz brown bottle with a best before date printed on the label. Served in a mug.  Pours a light copper with a huge, foamy, off-white head. It has a sparkling clarity and abundant carbonation. The head is mostly lasting and leaves behind an impressive amount of lacing. The aromas are well balanced, first noticing caramel/toasted malt and then some floral and citrus hop scents along side. Flavor is much as advertised by smell, the biscuity malts, with a very noticeable caramel presence, and some herbal and slightly citrus hops. There is an added touch of spice that rounds out the flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to medium-full bodied with a bit of a course texture and some prickly carbonation. Finish is mostly clean.  Overall, I find this beer to be a solid, easy drinking brew that would be good for times when you just want to throw back a few. It has a pretty good balance to the ingredients, with the malts taking a definite lead. It seems to be nicely fit to the style. It is a good, but certainly not great beer that I probably wouldn't seek out, but I would gladly drink another.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,willjschmidt,3.6,Poured form a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours an amber hue with a thick white head.  S: Biscuity malts with some floral accents.  T: A big malty and bready beer. It's toasty with quite a bit of grain. A good hop taste in the end balances it out quite well. Lots of grain and lots of toasted bread.  M: Medium bodied.  D: A good cross-over craft brew and a bit of a cult classic. There are certainly lots of better craft beers out there but if this gets someone off of BMC then I'm all for it. Another good choice on-tap since it's widely available on draft in California.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,assmasterson,2.76,"A: Pours a nice deep brown, almost has a reddish hue to it.  S: Kind of has a weird smell to it. Almost a faint dirty apple juice aroma mixed with alcohol.  T: Not exactly the best. When poured, had a very strong overcooked biscuit taste to it with an unpleasant aftertaste. Better straight from the bottle, as a lot of the harsh tones are masked.  M: Not too bad, sort of thin, yet sticky. Definitely feels like a macro brew.  D: Not as good. Goes down pretty easily, but the odd flavors keep me from having more than one. I probably won't be picking up any more of it. No...I know I won't.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MrIncognito,3.58,"Poured from a big bottle into a tulipped pilsner glass.  Clear amber/red color, nice white head that dissipates quickly.  Smell of caramel and dark bread. A little sweet in the nose with a draw of Belgian yeast.  Taste is pretty much the same. Not hugely impressive but still tasty. Not much hops to this one. The dark bread and roasted malts take center stage with the chasing Belgian yeast. Nice taste but lacks some umph.  Feel is smooth and light with moderate carbonation. A bit watery and thin for my taste.  A pretty good beer. I wish there was just a bit more to this. Very sessionable and easy-to-drink.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,demcorhip,3.78,"A nice, clear brew, somewhere between bronze and amber in colour. Nice two finger off white head formed on a fairly aggressive pour, with nice retention. Fairly mild and finely carbonated.  Bread, caramel and toast from the malts. Pleasant yeastiness, hints at apple. Somewhat surprised at the subtle hopping, with just a kiss of citrus blossom. Flavours much like the nose, no major surprises here, bready and toasty malts with a hint of caramel and melanoidin. To avoid repetition it tastes much like it smells.  Creamy yet finishes dry, slightly wet yet still astringent. Essentially light bodied, with decent malts and some complexity provides for some substance. Subtly hopped, a pleasant surprise, yet there is enough there to provide for some balance in this malt forward brew.  A tasty and very drinkable brew. Its quality and craftmanship reveal themselves in this interesting, tasty, approachable and sessionable brew. This would make for an excellent crossover brew, and I suspect that this is the main reason for its popularity. I'll be bringing this to more than one summer family gathering.  Note that this tasting was done with the beer slightly warmer than the recommended 7C, and was likely done with a 10-12C brew due to my impatience and suspicion that drinking it slightly warmer would reveal any deficiencies, none of which were noted.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,mnstorm99,3.86,"Clear orange amber pour with a decent white head that sticks around pretty well. Faint aromas of sweet malts and PNW hops. Taste is a nice amber, malty sweetness with a touch of roasted and toasted malts. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, but I found it a little thin. I have been critical of the hype this beer gets, but this is a solid beer and with it's availability we almost always have some around.

192,607,Greggy,2.7,"Appearance: Poured into my chalice glass, I got a nice 1.5 finger head, that receded rather quickly into a thin lace. The lacing on the glass wasn't ovely impressive but it remained in suspension. The beer had a light copper color and nice clarity.  Smell: Not a ton going on in the nose department but I did pick up some light caramel, a distinct breadiness/biscuit, an uber light hopiness and some malt. I was expecting more, to be honest.  Taste: A very light bready or biscuit tast lingers on the palette but isn't identified, by me, in the initial sip. There wasn't much I could pick out of the taste as it seemed rather 2 dimensional.  Mouthfeel: Smooth feel and lightly carbonated.  Drinkability: In Minnesota, these are only available in 22oz bomber bottles. So drinkability for me means, 22 oz at a time. It is ok and beasts out any macro you throw against it, but I could easily think of many other brews to drink intead of it.  Notes: I found this to be quite over-rated and I was quite shocked. This is pretty popular stuff in Minnesota but I think it may be because of the demand giving it some real hype that, in my opinion, it didn't live up to.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

It is some sort of a grassy malty odor. The beer smells fresh just not appealing to me.  The taste is equally balanced between malt and hops. Good carbonated bite.

The flavor is pairs very well with the rest of the beer. There is some complexity from the hops. On the mid-palate there is some sweetness. Also I noticed some mild fruitness. MF:Light body. D:Very easy to drink. There is a light mouth feel so it is easy to drink a few.

The taste is of toasted malt, roasted peanuts, and a light floral hop in the end. The feel is light but not watery and finishes well balanced. A solid amber brew with some nice toasted/roasted flavors.

Tastes of biscuits and malt, with a tad bit of spice to it.  Good mouthfeel, not overly thin or too thick.  Drinkability is great on this, I could easily make this a session beer if it were available in Indiana.

192,607,Natural510,4.1,"Fat Tire is a well-established name here in California, tho its accessibility is next-to-naught outside of the Western US. We pour it on-tap at my workplace, and it always gives a nice, creamy head. The color is a clear amber, with red overtones. Not much scent other than that of malt, but admittedly I usually taste this before I sniff. The selling point of this beer is the roasting & toasting of the malts New Beligium adds to their signature brew. I personally can't get enough toasted malt in my beer, which is what keeps me coming back for more. There is some hop presence, enough to please purists, but not overpowering enough to keep this from being a great ""session beer"". The carbonation also sticks with it enough through the end of a pint to keep the first sip as enjoyable as the last. All the NB products I have tried have been great, but keep coming back to the Fat Tire due to its exceptional drinkability & malt flavor...making this my go-to beer in bars & restaurants which don't go out of their way to please beer geeks like myself.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Came across the bar in a New Belgium Brewery Fat Tire snifter. A cool glass, wanted to lift it, but restrained myself. Translucent amber color with 1/2 finger head that rapidly receded. No lacing.  Not much in the way of nose. Very light malt and barely detectable hops.  Very light body, crisp, with a very dry after taste. A bit of bitter hops aftertaste.

I cannot recall a maltier nose on a beer.  T- More sweet malt. Nice bready flavor that is offset nicely with a slight bitter hoppiness. Very flavorful beer.  M- Surprising, not too heavy or thick (syrupy?). I thought that the mouth would be heavier due to the maltiness, but was pleasantly surprised to find this brew had a crisp, clean finish to it.

S: Smell is not intense, but sweet malt can be whiffed throughout.  T: Sweet malt taste can be enjoyed throughout with a hint of hop flavoring. The carbonation also helps this one taste great throughout. This beer is definitely reminiscent of a belgian ale, but not as yeasty or having intense alcohol flavor.  M: Light and very carbonated. Not thick, but what you would expect from an ale.  D: Easily drinkable as the ABV is only 5.2%. A definitive, easy session beer.  I had this one in a bottle after I first moved back to the mainland. After hearing much hype form a close friend, I had to try it. I was not impressed during my first session with the beer. But as I gave it more time, I began to really enjoy it. It really grew on me. And now that I had it on-tap, I really can say this is a great brew and a good choice from those who are locked in a bar or restaurant who only sells the usual suspects.

I'm not a slammer of beers, so I'm gonna say i got a bad batch and I'll have some when i want to encounter this again. Until then, I'll can just say this Fat Tire was flat. (Pun, I know.

192,607,CamuMahubah,3.83,Wow!..This stuff surprised me last night!...It had been a few years and I written this beer off. Decided to give it another try and I was very pleased this time around. Last showing it might have been a bit stale. Don't know how long it sat at Kloch's.  This beer wasn't as dark as I thought it was gonna be...pouring into the mug I noticed it was light orange...well I thought this beer was as black as my heart...Now I know it's an Amber Ale...  It tasted of pumperknickel right between toasted and burnt with chocolate undertones...this beer emants a cacao aura that I chased late into the night...  Easygoing...that is the magic...robust but without the strong aftertaste that I was expecting...just the right amount of fizz...  I am gonna keep a sixer in the fridge for when buddies stop by and such...Wifey likes it too...biscuity goodness!,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MarzenMan,3.68,"A - Nice clear amber color. 1 finger thick rocky head. Good lacing.  S- Lightly malty and chocolatey with a slight fruit smell.  T & M - Same as the smell. I delfinitely agree that its a one dimensional beer but its not quite like anything else either. Sweet, light chocolate/carmel malt but manages to end dryly. Very very lightly hopped.  D - High. Mild flavor and sweetness make it an easy downer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,tempest,3.65,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber, it's a hazy, reddish amber with a short head. The smell and taste make for a slightly toasty amber ale. There's a medium body, so despite its popularity, Fat Tire is no lightweight. The taste, however, just isn't that engaging. It's still a nice, balanced mix of sweet yeast flavors and malt, and not a beer I'd turn away.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,pweis909,3.95,"22oz bomber.  Bright translucent amber-orange with a head. Not highly hopped, this beer features toasty malts. The toasty notes were subtly apparent by smell, but more apparent in the taste. It is not sweetly malty, however, and actually has a crisp, dry finish that makes it highy drinkable. It's a well-balanced beer with crowd-pleasing appeal.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,marcpal,4.37,"Thank you Bort11 for this one. Ive enjoyed this one in Vegas on more than one occassion, good to try out on East Coast and to finally get around to the review.  Poured from bomber into glass  A: Nice reddish-amber color with an enticing inch of white head. Carbonation more than present and lasts long time with good lacing throughout.  S: Biscuity and malty. Very good sweetness to the nose. Hoppy smell.  T: Malt and biscuit just as in the smell. Sweetness was more than I remembered but still a huge fan of this taste. Hops have a clear presence in the throat after working way through this bomber.  M: Some body with a good mouthfeel. Carbonation was not going anywhere but it was nice.  D: Incredibly high, I am part of the following for this beer and am a bit down that this is my only that I get to enjoy out here. I really wish I had more and will look to gather more down the line.  Terrific beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,CAMRAhardliner,3.86,"The quaint scene on the label looks like it came from a children's book. I like the bottle with the dimpled neck, looks fancy.  The beer pours coppery gold with a frothy eggshell head that last an average length and leaves half the glass covered in sheets of lace. Grain roughness and toasted malt is evident in the nose. There's almost a bran feel to it. The taste is malt-centric with a biscuity and toasty feel, reminds me of the feel of some Belgian Pale Ales and Triples. The yeast, however, is much more neutral than any Belgian ale. The hops are pleasantly spicy and provide a competent counterbalance to all the malt going on. The finish is malty and slightly hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a somewhat rough carbonation.  I like this beer, it's very inoffensive and not bold in anyway, but its just interesting enough to keep my attention. This would make a great gateway into craft beer; its not too hoppy and wouldnt turn off even the most pedestrian palate.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,tronester,3.85,"Pours a clear amber with a medium off white head. Smells bready and yeasty. Taste is biscuity, but not as biscuity as I remember. Has a sweet presence as well, with a good rounding out of the hop bitterness. Slight hop flavor as well. Slightly thin on the mouthfeel. Quite drinkable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Reanimator,2.98,"The golden orange color and large, frothy, eggshell white head is very enticing. Aroma is very bready and sweet.  The taste is a bit disappointing. Malts and hops are there, but nothing really stands out, the volume seems to have been turned down on all of the flavors.  This is a very drinkable, yet ultimately unsatisfying beer. I had heard many a good thing about Fat Tire and I really wanted to enjoy the 22oz in front of me, but the subdued taste and weak body kept me from liking it as much as I had hoped.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,hellcatsjg,4.38,"Appearance: Medium amber color with a finger and a half of fluffy white head. Active carbonation lasts for a good while after the pour. Small amount of lacing as you go.  Smell: Toasty malty smell. Along with a sweet caramel aroma. Very nice.  Taste: The best word that describes this beer is ""biscuity"". Slightly sweet and very yeasty and malty. Not the most complex flavor, but what there is is very nice.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with good thickness. Carbonation lasts for a while. Very pleasant.  Drinkability: Very high. This beer has a great flavor, and is something that I could drink several of. Wish I had more than the single bottle that I just drank. Very good beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Leaves a distinct aftertaste. Very unique for an Amber. M: Medium/Light bodied beer with a high amount of carbonation. D: Fairly high.

192,607,smurphy77,4.1,"Picked up a six pack of this near S.F. when I had nothing else to do. Over the course of a few days my opinions swayed a bit, but overall this is a nice beer that is most definitely drinkable. It has a reddish amber color and a thin head. Taste was what varied, ranging from nice roasted malty slightly bitter slightly sweet complex concoction to eh that's nice but not interesting. Weird that one six pack could have such a spectrum of tastes.  I had this on draft a while back and loved it. Too long ago to review now, but the bottles in no way compared to the keg experience.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,champ103,3.71,"A: Orange/amber color with a small white head, decent carbonation, and a good amount of lace on the side. S: A little one dimensional. A lot of malt some hops, and maybe a hint of some other spices. T: Bread/biscuit malt with some nutty flavors and hops. A very distinct flavor that I like a lot. M/D: A light to medium body and medium carbonation. Not bad at all. A session beer through and through.  How do I sum my thoughts up without ranting? I will try and keep this short. This beer is considered a stepping stone into the craft beer scene, and many people think it is an over-hyped beer. I spent a summer camping in Montana in 2005. Fat Tire, Moose Drool and some local micro's were all we drank. I loved it then and after many years of trying many other styles, I still find it very good.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,likestoswallow,2.82,"From 22 oz bottle. Pours a rich copper-gold with an off white head that foamed up furiously then promptly disappeared. Aroma was very light malt. Flavor was mild with a distinct nuttiness--pistachio and peanuts in a semisweet backdrop. Hops and carbonation were undeveloped and weak. Mouthfeel was thin and less than fulfilling. Finish was short. Not likely to drink again, this beer tasted like it was specifically crafted for weak beer fans--and that is not me.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MMAJYK,3.55,"A- Copper/Orange transparent beer. Head is bright white, and thin. Goes away in the first few minutes for the most part. A thin film does stick around for the duration.  S- Smells of butter, almonds, caramel, nuts in general. I also pick up some biscuity aromas like homemade biscuits. I do pick up some sour yeasty smells too.  T- Taste of smooth, but burnt, nuts. Alot like the smell dictates. Smoky, woodsy, and yeasty. Finish is somewhat dry.  M- Mouthfeel is quite thin, but is decent. Nothing sticky, but definitely goes down good. I would call it low to mid carb. Just a little watery for my liking.  D- Very drinkable beer. Light on ABV and unique taste. Likeable and good. I will have to make another trip to the midwest sometime and pick more of this stuff up to bring back in my luggage.  This is one of the most talked about session craft brews and I can see why. It has enough distinctability to be a great craft brew and the drinkability to appeal to almost any beer drinker. Great job guys, keep up the good work.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,bboven,3.43,"Light copper color, clear with great head and lacing.  Super-biscuity, with a little yeast character that really is different for this style. Subtle stale hops.  Roasty and sour , very bready.  Mouthfeel is a little thin and over-carbonated for the style.  It's good, but for such a hyped-up beer, I dunno.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jp32,2.21,"It had an auburn tint, transparent, with very little carbonation at all. Not a lot of flavor, a bit bready.

192,607,noremorse1,2.88,"Now that I live out in Washington (having moved from Michigan) certain beers are now available to me. Beers like the infamous Fat Tire from New Belgium Brewing. Why not buy a 6 pack and give it a review.  Pour is a light amber with a medium amount of head that seems not to want to go anywhere. Mild lacing.  Smell is caramel, bready yeast, malt... grandmas musty attic.  Taste is nothing insane, but decent. Toasty with a strong taste of malt and bread.  I could drink a few of these. Nothing outstanding, but a decent beer none-the-less. However, I am told it tastes better on tap and in Colorado.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Metalmonk,3.89,"Never see this stuff (or other New Belgium beers) in VA/NC, so it's cool to see the Fat Tire logo lit up in neon all over Portland, OR and surrounding areas. I had to try one on for size.  Pours a toasty golden copper with very little head that thins too quickly. Nothing remarkable in its looks...  The aroma is probably my favorite aspect of this beer, as it strongly recalls buttered sourdough bread straight from the toaster. Wicked. There's a lighter spice element in the background that I can't put my finger on...cardamom? nutmeg? Ultimately it's complete and total toast. Toast Advocates should check it out.  Flavor-wise you get a big helping of toasty, crisp, biscuity flavor, with hops being present but pretty low-key. This is maybe not the most mindblowing beer out there, but it is one of the most unique, in that I can't recall a single other flavor like it.  Mouthfeel is crisp and tingly, with a nip of toastiness (oh really?) and light bitterness on the tongue.  Not the most bready beer around, but one of the most toast-like, if that's not too confusing.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,SchaefMan,3.5,"I like this beer quite a bit, and I may have even reviewed it before. It has a nice copper color to it, with an off-white head. Smells sort of bready, and tastes so, as well. Mouthfeel is good, with decent carbonation, and drinkability is good.  My main issue with this beer is the cost. I mostly get it because I like the 22oz bottle, but at the local Jewel, the regular price is $3.99 per bottle !!! Now, I would never pay that. I get it at Teddy's Liquors for $2.69, but even at that, it's way over-priced. Yet, I still get it.... oh well. I still like it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Hops were definitely secondary. Fruity, plum-like scent. Medium body. Spicy fruit flavor with plenty of sweet malt. Floral hops were in the background. Mouthfeel was about average. Well balanced. Could use a little more pizazz. Quite drinkable, though, and could be a good session beer, particularly at restaurants with limited beer selections.  I've read this has/had a slight Belgian character. If true, it's either gone or I couldn't detect it. Not exotic by any stretch, but a solid amber ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mrasskicktastic,1.91,"A - A huge frothy white head sits on top of a clear copper brew. The hed dissipates in minutes leaving thin rings of lacing at every sip.  S - THIS is the fat tire which I have heard countless rave over? It smells of very stale grain with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg underneath. A touch of dry hay keeps it hopped. Seriously, this smells pretty awful.  T - The taste, though not great is not nearly as unpleasant as the smell. The flavor has a dry light grain, not a hint of sweetness, with an intense carbonated water aftertaste accompanied by some hay and a bit of a cinnamon presence. Not good, but drinkable at least.  M - Thin, extremely highly carbonated - it actually tickles my throat, neither drying nor particularly thirst quenching.  D - Well, I can hold my nose on the sips, so it is just a little unpleasant. Last time I listen to the masses. I'm really sad to have bought a whole six pack of this.

Like the inside of a warm rubber or something. The taste was like a stale cracker or bread crust. Maybe it would go better with some kind of food, but by itself, it was not refreshing.

The smell is the only thing off about this beer. I wasn't bad...but it wasn't good.  It has a very earthy, bready taste. I had never tasted an ale like this, and it was a very unique brew.  This beer actually coated my mouth. I'm still smacking as I type this.  Very good drinkability. I would have another one right now if it wasn't my last one.

Taste reminds me of kit kat bars. Not desirable. Taste is a little woody. It's sweet flavor at first reminds me a little of an Oktoberfest. Mouthfeel is ok, a little harsh on the carbonation.

Twinge of hops.  Moderate body, it's nicely carbonated, crisp and short on the palate. Caramel sweetness with serious yeast flavors, slightly floral, very much like bread.

The hype was way more exciting than the beer. My first taste was from a bottle the second was on tap (I bought the bottle warm at the grocery store and wanted to give FT a second chance).  Negatives: It looked like any other amber ale, maybe a bit redder, and had a very regular mouth feel with some stickiness left over after the beer was swallowed. In terms of drinkability, I was very quickly ""flavor-stuffed"" and didn't want more than one or two pints.  Positives: It smelled good. I thought I'd want to drink an entire barrel. The flavor was good, but didn't wow me- a little like tree bark, almost like New Belgium was trying too hard to create something ""special"". A pint or two was all I wanted before I switched beers.

Goes down easy with little to stand in the way.  Overall: Not a bad beer--perfectly fine. Not sure what all the hub-bub is about with trying to get it everyone.

A grassy hoppines is also noted. Flavor is somewhat the same: biscuits and toasted malts. Hoppy bitterness is kept to a minimum, but still can be detected in the background. Aftertaste is heavy, and lingers for a while. Mouthfeel is oily and slick, but clean and the carbonation leaves a nice bite on my tongue.

Inviting, though not complex.  Taste: Here's where I started to be impressed. It was along the lines of a favorite of mine, Great Lakes Eliot Ness. Instead of a clean lager yeast, though, this one was all Belgian. A strong supporting note of apricot fruitiness backed up the deep maltiness of the brew. The two flavors played off of each other nicely.  Mouthfeel and drinkability were managed nicely. The brew was not too syrupy or fizzy. This would have been a nice session beer if I had managed to buy more than one bomber.

After an initial aroma dominated by malts; the hops come through with the aroma of wet cut clover.  T: This is a fairly clean beer. The body is moderate, as is the carbonation. It is nicely malty upfront, with some bitterness from the hops to balance out the flavor. The aftertaste leaves a slight bitterness that coats the mouth.  M: Decent mouthfeel. A bit thin but the hops and carbonation clear the palate sufficiently for the following sips..  D: This is a solid amber ale; very drinkable. It has good flavor and there is nothing overpowering but there is also nothing that gives this beer distinction or discrimination compared to its American cousins.

Very pale amber color and good clarity.  Aroma - pepper, bisuity/bready malt character  Flav - Biscuity malt flavor dominates early. Crisp hop bitterness balances the malt leading to good balance.

Othewise, stick with Bud Select or Michelob Ultra or the sorry ""local"" Empyrean (caveat: yes, the Empy's ESB is good). Anyhow, false advertising on the part of NB, for the much proclaimed ""balanced"" Fat Tire is actually quite malty and hardly, scarcely hoppy. It's a yummy malty bonanza, one you'd love to have with an acidic, teeth-cleaning dinner such as sashimi or grilled fish and lemon. But there's no hop profile to talk of . . . I'd say this beer is closer to the maibock, maltorama beer profile than it is an amber. Great . . . if that's what you're looking for. If you are looking for balance, or a spring and summer drinking sprint, or a mouth-awakener, then this is not the beer for you. As for the NB wheat, well, that's just not worthy of my radar.

The beer pours a dark gold color with a slim light white head that does not remain too long. Smell is of roasted malt and slight belgian yeast. Taste is light on dried fruits, and a slim cocoa scent/smell in the taste. Carbonation seems on par with most belgians making this a nice refreshing drink as it is light too.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,John1985,3.28,"Ale poured a deep amber with a half inch head. Taste had a tangy malt flavor that just seemed a bit off, not really unpleasant but strange. Hops balanced with an adequate bitterness. Overall this is a decent beer but since I'm visiting the great Northwest, I didn't see any reason to dwell too long with this one.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jar2574,3.92,"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass. Nice, off-white head. Light amber colored beer. Lacing is slightly above average as the beers is downed.  Smells of sweet fruit and maybe a touch of pine. Malts as well.  The taste is mellow and slightly sweet, as if there were a touch of honey in the beer. Very quaffable though. More malty than hoppy. Nice on a hot summer day. It could get a little sticky and sweet after a few rounds, for some.  I've had bunches of these lately because it's the best thing on tap at my local dive bar. This beer does not wow you, but it does what it sets out to accomplish -- provide quality at an affordable price. I think the taste is unique as well, which sets it apart from other beers geared toward mass consumption. Very good session beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,franksnbeans,3.9,"Pours a dark golden amber with minimal head and lace. Smells of citrus, fig and roasted malt. Tastes refreshing with mild fruit, mild sweet malt and a touch of hops. Finishes crisp. Light in the mouth with great carbonation. Great beer to develope the pallate for a true craft beer and this drinks like an ice cold water on a hot day.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,tgbljb,4.1,"Poured amedium amber color with moderate slightly off-white puffy head. Smell is significant for caramel with some light hop backtones.

A very easy-to-drink beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Overlord,2.98,"A decent brew, but certainly not one of my favorites.  A slight amount of hops, a fruit after-taste, and the beer was neither oversweet nor overly bitter. Mellow, good tasting, and pretty drinkable.  If there was one aspect I really didn't care for, it was the mouthfeel. Just felt weird, almost slimy...if that makes any sense. I don't know if the carbonation was off, or what, but this was not a pleasant beer to ""chew on"".",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,pmcadamis,3.31,"I found this on-tap at a tiny little place called Van's Tavern that was attached to our hotel in St. Louis.  A - Clear amber brew with a massive three finger head of rocky white foam and lots of nice lace sticks to the glass. Quite the looker.  S - Musky and earthy malts with some vinegar notes. Sweet and dusky with some funky characteristics...it smells OK, but I had to really stick my nose in and basically snort beer up my schnoz to detect any aroma at all. More assertive on tap.  T - Sweet and malty right off the bat with some big fruity fruitcake flavors. Some nice citrus hop flavors are there too. The rich carrot cake or fruitcake malts remind me of a watered down oktoberfest brew. The label says that the brewer's focus here was balance, and I'd say that they achieved that pretty well. It is malt-forward, but there are enough citrusy pale ale like hops to keep it in check.  M - Medium bodied and slightly oily on the palate with low levels of carbonation. The finish is neutral, sweet, and pretty clean.  D - A great session brew, but you get the feel that it's really made for the masses. Its a tasty but uncomplicated brew that goes down easy enough and compliments food well, it just lacks any sort of ""wow"" factor. This one seems much fresher and quenching on tap than in the bottle. I had four of these that night at Van's, and for me that is a major session.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Coppery-red pour with about 3/4 inch of head subsides quickly and leaves just a bit of lace. Medium carbonation. Aroma is heavy on the malt, lots of biscuit and cracker with a light floral sweetness and a bit of noble hop earthiness. Pretty clean.  Taste is pretty sweet with a bit, forward malt presence with toasted biscuit and caramel dominating with a bit of a grainy finish. There's a suggestion of hops in a light floral note, but nothing obtrusive. Creamy in the mouth with a medium-light body. Downright chuggable but a bit boring, nonetheless, it's a good session ale and I can see why it's popular with the crossover crowd.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,umustdrink,2.95,"A - Still orangey amber color. White head fades to an eighth inch. Average lacing, just above the head.  S - Very faint smell, some caramely malts with very faint hops.  T/M - Starts out somewhat viscose and a sharp carbonation hit, then an almost chocolatey roasted malt. Hops taste green and bitter but not very prevalent, it seems the roasted malt flavor is balanced by the carbonation. Finish leaves a toasted cereal malty flavor.  D - I like ambers a lot and this is not a terrible beer, but I wouldn't go back to it if I wanted an amber, as there are much better ambers available to me.   The beer store I work at just got in three New Belgium beers (Fat Tire, 1554 and Mothership Wit).  1554 was crap, this one was just okay and I liked Mothership the best.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Clockwork420,4.03,Bottle poured into a Glass Stein.  Apperance was amazing amber (duh...) color. Nice head. Actually took a picture of it. Little bubbles. Nice.  Smell was kinda sweet and corny. Not skunky or over powering. That was all I got.  Taste was semi sweet. Easy to drink. This quickly became a favorite now. The taste kinda taste almost earthy. At first I thought it was too carbonated. But now I know it is perfect. Or close to what I imagine is a great one for the price.  Along with that earthy mouthfeel came this number. This beer speaks for itself... And so forth with the drinkablilty.  This is simply amazing to me for a 2.39 22oz bottle came this good. Im astonished.  I now have a new favorite.

192,607,bluemoonswoon,4,"22oz bottle served in one of those old timey coke glasses (hey that's all I had available at the time). No freshness date.  A: The coke glass was pretty well suited to hold the head on this beer and formed a decent two inch off-white head that faded into a cap about halfway through the glass and left decent lacing down the sides of the glass. Pours a dark amber (as to be expected) a bit darker than the American Amber and St. Rogues Red from the Rogue brewery and quite bubbly. Good looking but not great.  S: For some reason I remember this being a bit fruiter, maybe I'm just used to smelling Rouge's amber ales but this one was huge on the malts. Big bread and biscut smell that while very fresh seemed to me unbalanced, just maltss thrown in my face with an underlying hop citrus scent, very minimal though.  T/MF: Tastes much like it smells, big fresh bread and biscut not too sweet and balanced nicely with the hops. The hops are there but not overtly noticable, they appear more in the finish rather than when the beer first hits the tongue. The bottle says it was going for the bready taste and it accomplished that.  D: Pretty damn drinkable but very filling, had to share some of the 22oz bottle and when I was done I felt like I ate an entire meal. Nice late summer early fall beer, there are better ambers out there though.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S- Very malty, floral and citrus notes, doughy/yeasty (bready)  T- The taste carries through but in a smaller dose than the smell. It has a great taste without being overly anything. Just a great all around, tastey beer! Leaves a dry pastey taste on the tongue. Very biscuity aftertaste.  M- Medium body, decnt carbonation.  D- Very drinkable.

Forms a nice frothy head.  The smell is spectacular. Dark, malty, slight ester notes, and generally delicious.  The taste is, well, delicious (notice a theme here?). As most others have said, the hop presence is not very strong. Malt and biscuit are the predominant flavors here, as well as a hint of mushrooms. It's also very... toasted. My father says the taste is far too burnt for his liking (although, take into account that all he buys is Icehouse or Busch).  Mouthfeel is quite good. Carbonated well enough.  This is a spectacular beer. This beer is the reason I never got into macro brews. Before I turned 21, my father gave me O'douls and (one) Busch beer, so I should have turned out liking the swill put out by BudMillCoor. However, I did not, and have this beer to thank for that. In a word, delicious.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,shadow1961,3,"New Belgium's Fat Tire pours a nice stiff head over a clear amber brew. Carbonation is listless and the nose is fruity yeast esters and barley malt. The flavor is sweetish toasty, nutty barley malt up front, with a bit of an herbal hop finish. The mouthfeel is dry and crisp. It's not a bad beer at all, but the catchet surrounding this particular beer is puzzling con- sidering the rest of New Belgium's lineup. People really need to drink more.

Smelled of caramel malts with subtle fruits and spices. Taste was in line with the smell -- smooth maltiness, not a lot of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit more watery than I expected but not terrible. Fairly sessionable, but also fairly forgettable -- perhaps a little overrated. Seems very much in line with just about every other beer of this style.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S - Nutty, toasted aromas with a faint lactic yeastiness in the nose. Very grainy and biscuit-like in aroma.  M - Nutty, biscuit-like graininess on top of a medium full feel. Subtle carbonation allows for a sweet malty finish.  T - A real roasted nut flavor w/ other toasted and grainy tastes. A bit of rye seems to join the bready melange.  D - An easy beer to drink after a warm summer walk in the sun(which is exactly when I tasted mine) It is a pretty mainstream taste and has an image and branding that is easy to recognize.

D: Very drinkable, is widely available, and a great choice in places that have so-so beer selection, and I've found it goes great with chili.

After a short warming from the fridge, into a pint glass, pours a solid amber color with a nice slightly bubbly, mostly foamy off-white head, sticks around for a few minutes until receding to a thin-ish film. Lacing comes in large swaths of row-and-column strands. The aroma is vaguely fruity, a biscuit malt sweetness to it, kind of eh but pretty solid.  The taste is a bit better. Starts off a bit stand-off-ish, easing into full flavor. The first thing that comes to fruition is the caramel and biscuit malt, and gives way to a mild hop bittering with slightly spicy, slightly floral tones. Now that I'm drinking it through, it definitely improves as it warms. The mouth has a medium body, a good dose of carbonation, a bit of a grainy feel to it, which usually wouldn't float my boat, but doesn't seem out of place here.  I'm not going to lie; ambers aren't nearly my favorite beer, and I've been a bit skeptical of this beer in particular. As it is, its pretty decent, and easy enough beer to drink.

The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a nice high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer. I dont think this is the best beer in the world, as is often clammed.

192,607,jmalex,4.28,"Thanks to my friend Matt for bringing this back from Arizona for me. It's been a long time since I've had this.  APPEARANCE: Pours a crystal clear pale golden amber with a small but hearty white head. Bubbles cascade up the glass constantly refreshing the head giving it decent staying power.  SMELL: The aroma is predominantly of toasty malt. It smells almost like a rustic bread. A nutty sweetness hides a very mild hop aroma. Pretty nice.  TASTE: The smell carries over into the taste. Toasty and nutty with a nice mild sweetness. It's also got a bit of a smoky flavor to it. The finish is clean and crisp.  MOUTHFEEL: A crisp carbonation highlights a medium to medium-light bodied beer.  DRINKABILITY: Really good. I could drink these all night. 5.6% ABV might be a little high to be sessionable, but I'd still count it.  I've had this before, but it still kind of caught me off guard how nice it is.

S-Raw grist grainy smell. A bit rough around the edges. I would have loved to see a big yeast punch come through, but this is the crowd pleaser that made them who they are today.  T-The rough, unbalanced grain makes a little way for the maltiness to come through. A residual sweetness leaves a full finish.  M-I understand that everybody loves this beer in Colorado, but it is like Spotted Cow of Wisconsin. The flavor is safe and the body is full with little hop bitterness.  D-Put it this way, it is a very nice beer, but if I was in Colorado at a bar that had other Colorado greats on tap, this one would be passed by (but that is just my dislike for this style of beer.)",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Great when skiing.  A: Pours out a light amber with a definite red/orange tinge. Much higher clarity than expected. Head pours out half an inch and dissipates quickly. Head is an off white with a slightly reddish tint. Carbonation rising to the top is fairly minimal.  S: Definite roasty toasty notes with a little bit of coffee and bread that has been slightly burnt. This is followed by a sweetness that is accentuated with the hops in the brew.  T: Not a whole lot of flavor up front. Mid palate has the beginnings of slightly cripsy biscuit minged with a little sweetness. This alludes to the finish, which is full out biscuit deliciousness. A slightly burnt biscuit, at that. The hops in the beer don't reveal themselves until the latter part of the finish, in which they intermingle with the burnt biscuit that has quickly come to dominate this beer. Not overly complex, but a delicious flavor.  M: The carbonation is actually quite prevalent in this beer. The beer is much cripser than one would guess when looking at the color. The carbonation is also slow to disspiate after the current mouthful has been drank.  D: The CO2 dominated mouthfeel inhibits the drinkability of this otherwise great beer. Some drinkers may be offset by the overall roasted and even burnt taste this beer exhibits, but for those that like their breakfast baked goods a little on the toasty side, this beer is heaven.

The taste is nice and rich -- not fully Belgian, but delcious nonetheless. This is not a hoppy beer. The beer feels nice on the palate, and is not overly carbonated.  It is very drinkable -- a dozen or so in a sitting would be nice over a long afternoon or evening. It's not really a golf course beer, but I had a couple during a round.

Unique malty aroma that manages not to seem sweet. Something a little yeasty, and some herbal aromas. Interesting.  In the taste, the biscuits are lightly toasted and have a little caramel on them. A semi-sweet flavour through most of the mouth. Hops are there, not overdone, but notable, well in balance. Hard to pin down one word to describe the hops.  Smooth, medium body, the carbonation works just right to keep this an easy drinker. Fairly dry, it leads to the next sip quickly.  As far as ambers go, this one really suits my tastes.

First, I don't understand the terminology of a ""Belgian style"" amber. The beer is OK , but I've certainly had better amber ale's (in recent memory - McTarnahan's, for example). Recommended for the curious, but not for anyone else.  Appearance was indeed amber, with good ""Belgian"" lacing. Aroma was faintly malty, but not distinctive. Flavor was roastier than I would've expected, but as it warmed it had a malty sweetness that I didn't expect and didn't reall feel fit with the rest of the beer's flavor.

I noticed a slight citrus taste at the front of my mouth in addition to the sweet, bready malt that doesn't change as I swallow and experience the aftertaste. It's very straightforward without much complexity. Just a tiny bit of hops tasted at the end.  Mouthfeel is clean to me, creamy and refreshing. Nothing unpleasant, but still not leaving any striking memories.  I remember thinking Fat Tire was more memorable than this.

This is definitely one of my new go-to's...provided I'll be able to find it on the east coast.  Put this beer this way: My dad is a Coors Light/Busch kind of guy. He swears by those two beers (though he has been known to go for a guinness or a Honey Brown on occasion). He loves this beer. This, to him, is beer exploration (which he isn't the biggest fan of, unlike my brother and I) at its best. So if you know someone who's not a huge fan of branching out, buy them a Fat Tire.

192,607,cdkrenz,3.73,"Six Pack Dan's Liquor Plover, Wisconsin  Appearance - Pours in a pale redish gold flow. The 1/2 inch head stays for a minute or so before leaving a whispy cloud of white at the surface. The caronation appears to have faded as only a few bubbles rise to the top.  Smell - There is a hoppyness to the scent craeting a bitter aroma. It's a faint scent and needs to be inhaled deeply before really recognising it.  Taste - The taste is subtle until it reaches the back of my throat. It is bitter but the bitterness isn't too strong. It has an enjoyable flavor. It has the hoppyness of an ale while offering a hint of stiffness a red might throw at you.  Mouthfeel - There is really a softness to the feel of this beer. I'm not used to ambers with that kind of soft appeal.  ~ All in all I have always enjoyed this beer. Whenever it's available in Central Wisconsin I take advantage.

192,607,ngandhi,3.23,"The amber ale is the hallmark of local beer. Malty enough to show the character of your region, but mild enough to demand immediate consumption before it goes dull. And, that said, Fat Tire might be just fine for Fort Collins, but it's a waste of shelf space in Chicago.  The arrogant allocation and labeling (try finding the ""Chicago"" bottling anywhere downstate) only emphasize how big of a sham this beer is. It doesn't belong here and now amount of packaging will change that.  Because this is not our red ale. Compared to the classic Bell's amber (which has sadly left Illinois) or New Holland's smoky Red Tulip, this is a boring affair--one more worthy to be chugged from the bottle than poured into a glass.  It's bready, lacks hops, and can't decide if it wants to taste like chocolate chips or Cherrios.  The beer's fine, but it aggravates me. Maybe because New Belgium's selection is so profoundly varied and complex. This is the cash cow--the brewery's throwaway beer--and I'm a chump for buying it.

I cracked this baby open with a Fat Tire goblet shaped bottle opener a friend gave me just today.  Appearance: Pours with a 1/2 inch almost white head. This settles very slowly into a 1/4 inch coating of dense foam with a ton of lacing. The beer itself is a medium amber and perfectly clear.  Smell: Slightly metallic, bready malt aroma.  Taste: A little toasted/burnt flavor upfront, in a pleasant way. Hops are not as present as I would have expected. Mild bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Average carbonation level. Body is excellent.  Drinkability: Very nice. A malty beer, just my style.

Sweetness up front turned to a mild bitterness with a relatively short finish.  Mouthfeel was smooth. Body was medium/thin.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

S- I actually love the smell of this beer. It smells floral and earthy at the same time. Hoppy sweetness. T- Like it smells. I used to think the taste was like peanuts but I now associate that taste with biscuits, well, because thats a much better description. Hops and sweet, not too much of either. Too much of an alcohol taste for such a quenchable beer. M- Decent- Crisp, well carbonated and slightly sticky D- I like this beer when I can't get more serious craft beers.

It pours a light amber w/ ~1/2"" of frothy head, maintains decent glass stick throughout the session. Nice aroma of toasty, caramel malts & matching tastes. Very smooth beer that has a bit of richness but is not overly thick. A real easy drinking beer that goes down way too easy.

Among that stuff was a couple bottles of Fat Tire.  Appearance - Pale amber, formative head, not much lacing.  Smell is pretty distinct for a lower alcohol amber ale. A spicy citric aroma, kind of like an orange spice tea.  Taste....oh yeah, I remember this. I was sitting at a bar in Boulder and had this with a cheeseburger, and thought it a distinctive taste. Kind of *tastes* like the air inside of a fat bike tire, if that makes any sense....and I actually don't mean that as a negative. Kind of a pleasurable chocolate and rubber mustiness, yes, it's all coming back to me. Rather unconventional...weird....but it works. Moderately alcoholic in the finish...I can actually taste some alcohol, which I also find odd for a 5.6% brew. Pairs well with grilled foods, salads, pretty much anything.  Mouthfeel is just right for this style.  Well, this is an oddball beer. This isn't going to be everyone's bag, but among its adherents (and I suppose I can count myself as one), this is very drinkable, and a nice session beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,jtslay,4.6,The description on the bottle is quite accurate. Biscuit-like aroma and flavor are a direct result of the yeast used by New Belgium Brewing. Pay close attention to the serving temperature and try to pour into your favorite beer glass rather than drink from the bottle. The aroma gets me every time.

Regardless, I wasn't terribly impressed. There wasn't much to smell, and even less to taste. I kept taking sips looking for any soft of flavor, but kept coming up short. It was definitely a red ale, but a very mild one at that. Low in carbonation as well. Not much to report on this beer I'm afraid, and I even had another just to make sure - yet had the same experience. Great in color I must say, but lacking in all other areas.

S - Rich citrusy smell, typical Amber Ale.  T - Strong, distinguishable flavor. Almost chocolatey. Aftertaste lingers for about 1 minute. Not a potent aftertaste, pleasently skunky at first. Overall Rich tasting beer, mild hoppy flavor. (makes me happy).  M - Good for summer days. Not the best with some foods (i.e. picnic salads, fish), but pretty good for burgers and BBQ's.  D - Very drinkable. Aftertaste does not ruin the overall Quality.  Overall a good beer. Refreshing yet full bodied. Cons - First sip a little ""too"" potent, but by half the beer I was acquianted.

Faint whiffs of pale and crystal malts are apparent, giving off a nice caramel nose. The taste is pretty sharp with the carbonation but has a nice subtle sweetness to it, with a mild ending that isn't too astringent. Mouthfeel is light and sharp initially with the high carbonation but smooths out towards the end, giving it a pretty good drinkability. Won't be the most exciting beer ever, but within the context of an amber ale, it is quite solid. ___  5/15/09  Had at Philippe's on tap in Los Angeles. Was sweeter than I remember it.

So a revisit of all the times I've had it at Joe's party, or pulled out of an ice tub at Lisa's house, etc...is necessary.  Nice grassy hop nose that's really mild but inviting. Very mild but tasty beer, easy to drink down and leaves a sweet aftertaste that makes the grassy nose of the next sip and ever better balance.  It is true it's a gateway beer, easy to drink but with a stronger flavor than most widely available macros. You can find it on tap just as easily if not more so out her in Portland, and it's a good beer to help spread the appreciation of different beers to a new convert.

Smell: Has a somewhat warm aroma of yeasty malts and some florals. I think a bit of fruit smell is present too, but the yeast is quite pungent (a bit too much so).  Taste: Very much like the smell, with a strong yeast flavor. But it does have a bit of hops as well to counter it.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and a tad bit chewy. Very smooth and with a light tingly feel.  Drinkability: Definitely a drinkable beer that goes down fine and that is easilly managed (alcohol and taste-wise).  Certainly doesn't live up to the hype I've heard over the years. Not a bad beer, but it's like they're trying too hard to make a ""special"" amber ale.

Waves of biscuit with a nice caramel backdrop. A nice mellow hop presence. Malt is accompanied by some nice juicy fruit flavor. Not a lot of sharp citrus, just some soft apple, pear and peach touches. Biscuit and fruit really dominate this brew. Ends with a mild lingering fruitiness.  This is really a fantastic gateway beer for macro drinkers to craft beer. It doesnt have that overly hoppy flavor like Sam Adams, but the malt base and fruit flavors are huge and make this very drinkable and distinct.

Taste: Not much of the distinctive Belgian yeast aroma or flavor in this one, which I was naively expecting from a brewery called ""New Belgium."" Biscuity and grainy, with some hops in the background. Malt takes the lead in this one, and it is sufficiently complex without being too sweet, which helps drinkability a lot.  Mouthfeel: Not too thin, not too syrupy. Good.  Drinkability: Good - something even non craft beer drinkers can appreciate, maybe because it's complex-tasting without being bitter.

It has a nice caramelly buttery taste that is balanced well with hop floral aromas/tastes. The taste is very full bodied and finishes very clean. I would consider the drinkability high for this beer compared to other ambers, of which I am generally not fond.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Very nice smell, malty and floral with a bit of hops.  Very tasty, too. Sweet and malty up front with a nice hop flavor on the finish.  For such a good beer, it has a very thin and fizzy mouthfeel. I wasn't sure if I should give this a 2.5 or a 3. Maybe my expectations were higher because this is such a well made beer, so I figure it's at least average.  This is a pretty drinkable ale. It has a robust flavor that won't overpower or be overpowered by good food. I like it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The nose had just a little caramel and toffee, with a slight bit of graininess and hops, but it was all very weak. The taste was lightly toasty, bready, touched by caramel, with minimal hops. The mouth was medium-thick, with fine but tingly carbonation. Overall, an easy drinker, but with little character.

Smells nice and balanced, hops and malt both evident.  I like this beer. It tastes good. Hoppy initially with malts creeping in the aftertaste. I have always thought this beer had a hint of marijuana taste to it, as strange as that sounds, although hops is related to marijuana somehow.  Feels a bit thin, but this is nice for this type of beer and compliments the tastes very well.  I could drink as much of these as available.

No hops or tartness to speak of. Bready and quite bland. It's not bad, but not really my favorite type of brew.  Mouthfeel is medium with slight astringency.  Drinkability is low to me.

Good bubbles and some better lacing than expeceted, along with the light foam retained throughout. The aroma is like Killians, only a peg or two higher. All right taste, but definetly overhyped in the Chicagoland area ever since it became available. Good malt character with a light cleaning effect from the hops. Not lot of hops mind you.

192,607,jeffjfindley,4.4,"About twelve years ago, I met Fat Tire, and I haven't been the same since.  The appearance is a strikingly transparent amber, and the head's retention is fabulous. As for the smell, imagine walking past the best bakery you can imagine, and they're making up a batch of cinnamon scones. The taste is great too, and absolutely unique in the sea of the 27 trillion other micro-ambers I've consumed in the past twelve years. That having been said, I can see how some could find the ""biscuity"" character a little overbearing  The moutheel is crisp, yet substantial on the palate, with a numbing afterglow that makes me think of novocaine. The drinkability is second to none, and I'm convinced that a negative review of this beer finds it's roots in a determination to deride it. If nothing else, the simple fact that this beer has brought such an incredible number of folks over from the dark side should earn this beer a lifetime acheivement award.  Also, I had the pleasure of visiting the brewery when I was in the Denver area for my recent birthday, and I couldn't recommend the tour more highly. Their business practices, and their success are as inspiring as their beer. You must go to Fort Collins. While you're they're, check out Coopersmith's Brewpub.  It warms well too.

192,607,laintringulis,3.55,"2006 vintage. Served in a pub glass.  Pours a dark amber with large white head that last throughout drinking. Moderate amount of lacing. Large amount of tight carbonation.  Smells very yeasty/bready. Moderate citrus hop smell with vague cinnamon and ginger.  Initially, there is a slight sweet maltiness that progresses into a dry hop citrus finish. There is a slight peppery taste to the finish. The flavors are kind of muddy; not very distinct in the presentation. The bready/yeasty flavors seem to dominate.  Light plus bodied, properly carbonated. Not watery. At times, slightly too astringent in the middle and the finish. I noticed this much more with the bomber vs the 12 ounce bottles. I don't know why, but that's what I found. I almost didn't drink the 6 pack for the bomber.  Easy to drink. Sessionable. Uncomplicated beer.

I've had Fat Tire before, both bottled and on tap, and this is NOT what I remember. Even served some from a different bottle at a tasting I hosted just a few days ago and enjoyed it much more.  The beer is beautifully amber, deep in color with a pleasant effervescence. But when I raised the glass to my nose I was repulsed by the odor of  sorry to be crass  vomit.  After backing away from the glass and letting it sit a spell, I came back to give it another whiff, and the unpleasant smell had given way to something a bit more tolerable, though for the life of me, I cant put a name to it. Maybe molasses, a little caramel, a bit like a biscuit. But theres still something skanky lurking under there.  I hate to waste beer, I really do, so before giving up on this one without tasting it, I grabbed some saltines to clear my palate and hoped for the best.  I take a sip and again, Im baffled. I just dont remember this beer tasting this way. Its not awful  its just not great. While the mouthfeel is actually nice enough, the taste is just off.  I dont know what else to say.

It's more of an ale than amber, nearly bordering on ale with some amber to it.  It's not overly filling or bloating, so this would be a great one for session. I missed my chance to try it on-tap while traveling throughout the northwest USA (or at least I've forgotten if I had any), but I will be sure to grab this at the next available tap I see.  Definitely ""way up there"" on my list of more or less traditional US beers that are actually worthwhile.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,PhiloPsych,3.22,"Fat Tire is a nice looking light-medium amber. It pours a big, bubbly head. It has good taste up front, but finishes a bit weak. The moutfeel is a little watery. It's not a bad beer, though. It looks nice and is quite drinkable. At 5.2% it would make a pretty good session beer--not strong, but not too weak, either.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,blackie,3.28,"appearance: The tumbler is handed to me with a fluffy off white head that slowly falls back just a little and then comes almost to a halt with about half an inch left...very nice retention. The beer is a clear amber in color.  smell: Wet, stale toast and a light hint of nutty malt. A touch of sour fermented grain. No noticeable hop aroma.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is a smooth upper medium, and the body light...slightly watery.  taste: Very similar to the aroma. Toasted bread and watery biscuits upfront, with a light sweetness. No hop flavor and just a touch of bitterness. Not much else to it and a little watery.  drinkability: easy enough to drink, just not that much of an amber/red  bomber split with dirtylou during my stay in WI",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Of course this is probably all a result of west coasters thinking (very incorrectly) that they are superior to the east. But I digress...This is not a bad beer, but its not a great or original beer either...I enjoy the biscuit/nutty flavours, mild grain, light fruit sweetness, light earthy hop character  mouthfeel: a tad thin  drinkability: high",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,vanrassel,2.71,"This beer looked nice, but it was mostly downhill from there. It wasn't a terrible experience by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't say I liked this beer all that much.  It poured from a 650 mL bomber a nice amber colour with a bit of a coppery tinge topped by a nice head. The smell was downright unpleasant at first: dark malts and a subtle nutiness almost completely overpowered by a sour aroma.  The sourness carried over to the taste, though the effect seemed to moderate a bit as the beer warmed and I picked up some biscuit-like taste and some toffee sweetness. Those observations elevated this beer, to me, from downright unpleasant to at least tolerable. Not much more good to say about it, though.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BeerSox,3.36,"12oz bottle into a mug. Exp date: Nov 10, 2006  Pours deep yellow, almost orange. Creates an egg-white head with some retention, then settles into a thin cap. A little bit of webbed lacing.  Weak grainy scents are present along with hints of fruit.  The malts create an almost liquid-biscuit flavor. Huskey aftertaste along with a hop-bitter finish that sticks around for a bit.  Light to medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. Drysing finish along with a crisp feel.  This is a popular craft beer (almost reaching the ""ubiquitous ranks"" of Sierra Nevada and Guinness) that gets the job done. Refreshing, yet comes with generous flavor.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Dizzy,3.87,"Pours clear amber with off white head with some lace. Aroma is bread like malts and fruit. Taste is malts with some noticeable hop bitterness and some fruit like flavors as well. Medium bodied with a little bite from the carbonation. I've never had another beer quite like this. There aren't any extreme qualities to this beer, its just a unique tasting great session beer. I highly reccomend this.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,EvilKeith,3.18,"Pours into the glass a crystal clear pale amber color with a meringue-like finger of frothy head. The lacing was generous.  The smell was sweet roasty malt, light caramel, faint fruitiness, and an earthy, nutty note.  The taste is a good sweet toasted malt base. Molasses, and dry nutty husk-like grainy flavor. Just enough hops to bring balance.  The mushroomy/nutty flavor is something you will either love or hate. I found it to be a very different. It's almost tastes like grains of paradise and the added dry nuttiness.  Moderate carbonation. Medium bodied. Dry ""nutty"" lingering mouthfeel.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Winter,4.4,"Rare treat from Colorado. A coworker's relative brought some and she was kind enough to share with me. Pours a clear copper in color with a light khaki head. The nose consisted of caramel and toasted malt, with a slight ale fruitiness to it. Medium-bodied in mouthfeel, with a slight crispness around the edges of the tongue. Buttery toasted biscuit flavor and plenty of malt sweetness on the front. Texture and taste slides to a grainy flavor in the middle. There's just the right amount of hop bitterness to contrast the malty sweetness. It's perfectly balanced in that aspect. Finish has almost a slight nuttiness to it with alcoholic vapors. This is amazingly quaffable. Probably one of the best ambers I've ever tried.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BurnsTau,3.68,"Pours amber-copper, decent amount of head, little lacing.  Smell is definitely malty sweetness, some fruit notes in there too.  Taste is clean crisps malts. Bit of sweet fruit flavor and a tiny hop aftertaste. Doughy malts dominate throughout this beer. Good medium body/carbonation. Everything about this beer is made to relax and enjoy. Nothing too complex but definitely very drinkable.  Overall great for what it is, an amber. If you're into the style then this is a great beer for you.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Poured from the 22 oz. bomber to a golden amber, with thick off-white head that lingered throughout and excellent lacing...so far, so good. Unfortunately, the aroma was a mixture of stale hoppiness and mildewed dishrag. While the flavor was smooth, I was unable to detect any particular taste. Body was very thin, which led to a watery finish, that very quickly dissipated to no finish. Cute name, but Ive had a lot better beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,drugsbunny,2.06,"""Not impressed"" seems to cover it. I had this on tap out West, but I drank it after I had been drinking some glorious Sierra Nevada, fresh as I ever get it in New York. So this hop-less amber was a big disappointment. Nice red color though, but I wasn't taking pictures of this beer. If you drink Fat Tire, make sure you don't do so after drinking some wonderful hoppy beer. Otherwise all you get is a cloying sweet taste that was too much for me to even finish it. Skip this amber for many other worthy examples.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,UberWasser,4.13,"12oz bottle served in a pint glass.  Fat Tire pours a crisp, clear medium amber color with a nice thick head that starts out frothy like a cappucino and ends up, just before dissipating all together, looking like the craggy foam on an angry sea shore. The foam seems stick and laces the side of the glass nicely. Attractive.  The smell is quite nice, dominated by grainy bread like notes with some spicy hop presence to balance.  The taste follows suit, with a slight sweet-bread flavor starting on the tongue, developing into a more grainy bread crust flavor partway through, and finishing with a spicy and slightly fruit hop kick just at the end. Quite tasty.  Mouthfeel has always suffered in the bottle for this beer, in my opinon. The nice head that it gets on a medium pour seems to sap the beer of all of its carbation...it was quite flat to me, as usual. My dad agrees and tends to refer to it as ""Flat Tire"".  That mouthfeel sort of cuts into the drinkability for me, leaving my mouth feeling somewhat bored.

Spicy and a good balance of hop bitterness. My beer was a little too cold and from a freshly tapped keg so it seemed milder/lighter tasting than what I remember.  M-Light to medium bodied. Not heavy on the tongue and medium carbonation.  D-A very good beer. I could stick with this for a long beer session.

Nice balance of malt and hops (the closet comparison of Celis Pale Bock), and much richer than one might expect based on its color.  A truly outstanding amber-red lager, and heads and shoulders above other beers of this style (the biggie is the nice surge of hops that perfectly matches the very sweet malt).",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Generik420,3.5,"After hearing about this beer for a number of years, I finally got to try it this past weekend. The bar I was at had it available in 22oz bombers and a friend I was with bought me one when he found out I was a Fat Tire virgin. Upon pouring out the first glass I was pretty pleased with the color and appearance of the beer. The smell was on the fruity side and overall pretty pleasing. I thought the beer was very good at first, a somewhat light mouthfeel, but the taste had some nice estery notes hidden in there. Unfortunately, I found that 22oz of this is just too much and was really starting to wish I had split the bomber with a friend then have it all to myself. Hard to really explain why, just found the more I drank of it, the more tired of it I got. It isn't a bad beer by any means, but for all the hype it has gotten for years from people I know, it sure fell far short of living up to it. I would drink it again if it was handed to me, but really doubt I would buy myself a bottle unless there was only budmilloors available.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Appearance: The beer pours a clear amber coloration. The head was two fingers high. The off white head had major staying power.  Smell: The beer has a major league biscuity maltyness. The beer has a twinge of fruityness.  Taste: The beer is biscuity maltyness from start to finish. The beer has a slight hop prescence knocking the maltyness down a bit.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer is very easy to drink. This would be a great sessionable beer.

I would have a hard time saying this is an all around perfect ale, but it's very good in many ways and would be a regular drinker if I could buy it. My guess if the price tag climbed, some folk here would rate it better.  A - dark, cloudy, small head. S - spices are present and enticing. T - sweet with a a uniquely Belgian style spiciness. I guess corriander or some other aromatic spice comes to mind and it's not subtel. It's not very hoppy, but it gets at something very different that I really can't say any other beer I could think of embodies so nicely. M - a little sticky, but that might contibute to the drinkablility. D - it's hard to stop. To get so much flvaor without the heavy alcohol that usually accompanies it is a treat.

S - The bottle advertises this beer as being bisuity, and I would agree. Smell is of toasted bready malts and an underlying sweetness. Not much in the hop department.  T - Yeah, bicuity. A lot. Probably too much. The label also advertises a hop balance but there wasn't much hop to be found. In fact, I'm struggling to find any. This beer is a malt bomb. If that's your thing, you'll love it. Personally, I prefer a slight amount of balance.  M - Medium and creamy. Not bad.  D - I wouldn't want to session this beer.

Tried as I might, I couldn't detect much more in terms of flavor.The flavor wasn't full bodied, however, and I found this beer kind of weak. Slight hoppiness, but nothing distinctive.

Very well-balanced, hops and alcohol taste aren't really even detectable.Tart, but not bitter.  Light to medium-bodied. Nice creamy feel at first, but then too watery.

Smells immediately of belgian yeast and eventually fades to green herbs by mid-bottle. Near the end cocoa would creep in, riding on the bready yeast. Taste is very mild with grapefruit-like hops then hints of malt that certainly finish on the note of toasted nuts. Aftertaste can border on pleasantly tart, especially after big sips.  Perfectly clean on the tongue, no sticky situations here!

Some musty earthy malt, caramel, and a rich chocolate and hazelnut aroma that reminds me of Nutella...mmm.  Tastes just like it smells.

Pours a glowing amber color, with a substantial white head. Intricate lacing in the glass. Nose is warm malt, with hints of dough and spices. Palate is on the sweeter side; a good balance of sweet malts and bittering hops. This beer has a candy-like character to it that's nice as well ... like a toffee.

If one really sticks your nose in there and takes a big whiff, you get the sweet, biscuity malt you would expect. Much the same can be said of the flavor, rather dry for the style, and more in a disappointingly bland way than a pleasantly drinkable one.

As it says, biscuity and malty. very simple, not much to search for here.  T - Seems much simpler that previous times I have had it. Again, a little bready, a fermented taste almost from a yeast strain. Tastes more like an MGD than an amber.  M - Very crisp and I guess, refreshing. Perhaps the better part of this beer.

Tastes very bready doughy with biscuit and caramel malts. Some toasted character and a bit of a citrus finish that I take to be hops. Not quite grapefruit, but not quite orange either. Md light body and a touch dextrinous in the mouth. Modest carbonation. Simple, tasty, and unique. Just an all around nice beer. Much better fresh at the brewery than from a store-bought bottle.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Clear copper with two fingers of off white. Very good retention with plenty of wispy ringed lace.  The nose is a nice balance of toasty malts and caramel with just enough flowers and spice from the hops. Well rounded aromas.  The taste follows along the same lines but with just a bit more toast with the caramel and just the right enough hop bite for balance and a nice dry finish. Slightly nutty in the middle. Again, well rounded and tasty.  Nice moderate mouth that finishes clean. A very drinkable Amber that can please those new to craft beer as well as those who have been drinking crafts for years.

192,607,marcobrau,3.51,"The only other Fat Tire I've had before this one, was one ""bootlegged"" to Illinois. I will agree with some of the other reviewers in that this is a good beer when fresh. The nose is appealing with an exagerated malt aroma and a bit of toasted marshmallow; which gets me thinking of this as a great campfire beer. As very carbonated beer, I give my second pour of the bomber a good pour to release the bubbles, creating a very smooth mouthfeel and lasting head bright white foam. A medium bodied beer, Fat Tire is amber ale that accents its malt flavors more than the hops. This is definitely a beer for ""malt heads"" but not so much as to put off the newbie micro drinker. Definitely a good ""beginners"" craft beer with enough tasty toasted and caramelly maltiness to make this experience satisfactory, but a little too malty-sweet for me to enjoy more than a couple.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,dedrinker,3.51,"I hear countless requests to carry this beer at the grocery store I work in, so when I first tried it - a ""medium-everything"" amber, I was not surprised. Very drinkable, very fresh (its chief strength) but surely nothing to get excited about for those who have been around the beer block a few times. This is a great everyday beer for casual consumption, but aside from its young, fresh character, not a single thing stood out but its ordinariness. This beer is perhaps one of the best introductions to the American craft beer category for the uninitiated. Don't get me wrong - I liked it.  Four Years Later: My original review still holds. I have picked up on the subtle mingling of toasted malt flavor with a clean dry finish from a dusting of sufficient hops for the purpose, but this remains a well crafted middle of the road taste experience. One of the best examples of a middle of the road style. Upper middle class white girls still rave and their boyfriends declare, but the more knowledgeable tipplers at BA hold the line on where this beer belongs - a solid ""B."" I also had one out of date - as bad as anything else that has past its prime.  My obsession with Fat Tire is more of a socio-psychological one as to the narrow demographic that proclaims this beer to be perfection in a bottle, and my attempts to get inside their heads to look for answers and clues for how to help them get into the rest of the thousands of awesome American craft beers.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Skidz,4.38,"After hearing many things about how this beer is brewed using the same recipe as used for Mile Rock Amber by Harbor City, I decided a side by side review was necessary. My review of Mile Rock amber can be seen here: http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/794/5940/?ba=Skidz  This is my review for Fat Tire:  Pours out crisp light gold and sits bright copper-amber in the glass with a good sized, slightly off-white head. Fades to a good skimming of foam with nice lacings around the glass.  Smells of toasty malts with some caramel presence. Earth and nutty tones blend in with full, green, leafy hops aromas. Some bits of clover dancing around the edges.  Tastes of delightfully rounded malts, bursting with toasted character. Liveley caramel, and crackery tones run up and down along with bits of hazelnut. Mild hops bitterness enters, but delivers little flavor, besides some slight, dry leafy tones. Satifying finish.  Soft, forgiving and creamy in the mouth with mild-moderate carbonation and a medium-light body.  Fantastically drinkable, soothing and pleasant in the mouth. Lots of character and no real quarrels to speak of.  In comparing Fat Tire to Mile Rock Amber, the visuals are key to the interpretation. Held up side by side, both sit fairly equal in color and depth, but MR definately has some chill haze going on. Head retention is very similar, though I'd say MR has a bit of an edge.  After that, these beers are nothing alike. While they may have started off using the same, or nearly identical recipes, the yeast divides these two beers significantly. Earthy, nutty tones dominate in FT, while fruity flavors hit home in MR.  Which is better? I'd put my money on FT, hands down. Best looks, nose, taste, body, drinkability all-around. Not to say MR doesn't hold a thumb to it, it's just not as good as FT.

I could certainly drink several of these at a time were it not for the $3/bottle pricetag in Wisconsin. Overall, this is a pretty good beer.

A brown bomber bottle of Fat Tire with a best by date of June 16, 2006. I poured my beer into a standard pint glass.  The beer poured a very faint amber with the slightest of red tinge. The quarter inch of white head did not retain well. Doughy malts provided the majority of nose, along with a hint of carmel and and another, unidentified, underlying graininess. The beer, which has a substantial following behind it, tasted of a simple maltiness. No hoppiness to really boast of existed inside the flavor, but no negative astringencies were held within there. I found it - on the whole - to be a fairly basic, although very drinkable, amber ale. I see the reasoning behind its cult following, but I find nothing worth really writing home for in this one.

To start, the beer had this real funky taste and smell, sort of sour and sulphurish, but it blew off after a few minutes. Aside from that nearly tragic problem, it smelled generally malty and a bit yeasty. The taste is bready, with a slight tangy hop middle, and some yeasty flavors in the aftertaste.

A moderate toasted, biscuit malt aroma. Astringent, perfumey floral hop aspect. Earthy, slightly sweetened wheat and grain.  Sweetened caramel, lightly burnt toffee; active, doughy yeast giving a biscuity flavor. Noble, rounded rustic floral hops that doesn't exactly balance the toasted maltiness, but it tries. Caramel and sweet toffee in the aftertaste.  Medium bodied; mellow and sweet on the palate. Not completely balanced, but not intrusive.  A pretty boring beer.

Provides just enough hops to not offend those making the switch from macros, but satisfy a craft beer fan. A nutty flavor rolls in late. The finish is bit...bland and unfulfilled...  A fine session beer. I like what this beer repesents...it is a quality beer with a solid flavor profile, a decent hopping level.

192,607,ultralarry2006,3.38,"Poured from a 22oz.bottle. Leaves about one finger of foamy head that recedes into a scant surface skim. Does leaves a nice lacing. Is a clear coppery red hue.  Aroma - odor is a very sour dough, bready malt. It's very fungal (like wild mushrooms ) and reminds me of the odor of moist and rotting grass clippings from the lawnmower sitting in an open lawn-and-leaf bag. It's hard to tell what to expect from the aroma - it seems really sour -like it could be bad, or maybe its actually good, like cheese that smells bad, but tastes good. Also, hint, just barely, of grassy and herbally hops.  Taste - well... it is kind of as promised as by aroma. It is grassy, doughy, bready, sour malty. Slight, very slight, taste of hops ( I may have even imagined it, it was so slight. ). Aftertaste of weakly brewed tea, with some lemon (see, there's the hops afterall ). This is not unlike Irish Red Ale, which I do like quite a bit. It has its own unique taste though, being dominated by this sour, wild fungal, grassy, doughy thing, but I like it. And the tea-like aftertaste helps resolve it into a recognizeably red ale ( Irish, or otherwise ). The thing I like about red ales is that they are not really sweet at all, rather they are somewhat tannic, and I find that to be refreshing ( like I find tea to be refreshing ), and this one is fact, even somewhat sour, and of course, mildly tannic.  Mouthfeel - Less than full, not quite thin, but tending towards that. In spite of lack of assertive hop flavor, there is a very nice hop oil mouth slickness from this ale. This doesn't leave you dry, but there is a sort of tannic feeling ( i.e. tea-like, first in the aftertaste, and now the mouthfeel ). Low carbonation.  Drinkabilty - this goes down very easy. I could put away two of these 22 oz.'ers in no time flat, and possibly a third (especially since the abv is like 5.3 % ). But, much as I like the taste of this, it is on the balance, fairly meek,and I would tire of this, and would want something bigger and bolder to go on with through the rest of the night (or sitting, or session, or whatever ).",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Whisps of off-white head with quickly dissipating retention.  Aroma: Smells heavily of copper flavored caramel. There may be a faint lingering of fruit mixed in. Virtually no notes of hops here.  Taste: Fat Tire seems fairly easy to drink, but it doesn't offer much challenge to the palate. The finish leaves the tongue with a slight sweetness. The hopping level here is just enough to leave a faint memory of bitterness.  Notes: This is obviously a gateway beer, and hopefully it brings the masses one step closer to becoming full fledged supporters of microbreweries.

Honestly this is the beer that got me interested in real beer so many years back, back when it was a Colorado exclusive beer and I couldn't find it on every corner store across America. Now it is a definately favorite for watching a hockey game (go Avs), or bringing along to a party or for post mt biking session.  Pours deep copper to amber color with nice dense one finger white head and some nice sticky lacings.  Aroma is unmistakable, huge buscuit malt aroma with a fruity aroma like strawberries. Taste is also massively biscuit malt and grainy with just a bit of hops for balance. Some fruity sweetness is detectable but that malty flavor just dominates everything. Mouthfeel is refreshing in spite of the strong grainy malt flavor, Light to medium body goes down very easy and smooth with just a bit of grainy dryness in the end. Nice malty aftertaste is a great bonus.  I know this beer is somewhat shallow and it's major attribute seems to be it's drinkability but man, what other beer with this much malty flavor is so darn drinkable? Also this beer does not truly fit the amber ale style guidelines and is so unique compared to the many amber ales that are available. It is really in a catagory by itself.  This is one of the finest session beers in the world if you ask me. Highly enjoyable any season for any reason, tons of flavor and easy to find.

Smell: was pretty average, nothing spectacular cept' maybe apples  Taste :A decent mix of hopps,yeast,caramel was all I could realy taste.

192,607,UncleFlip,2.84,"Honey coloured liquid- ever so slightly hazy. Modest off white head falls at a decent rate, leaving just a bit of lace behind.  Loses some major points on smell. There's not much there to go on, but what there is smells a bit ashy and old. Hopefully the flavour is better. :)  Flavour is kind of raw grainy, with not much else going on. There's just a hint of hop bitterness under.  Liquid is just the thin side of medium. Carbonation is prominent, but not annoying.  Drinkability is OK....but I give it marks off because it's a personal rating, and I'm just not that crazy about this one. If there were more going on with it, maybe it'd do better.

192,607,patrick16o,4.22,"Pours a golden amber hue with a modest head and a good amount of bubbling. Head dissapates slowly. The aroma has a strong sweet malt character with hints of chocolate and toasted malts. Flavor is malty, quite toasty and sweet. It reminds me of a roasted marshmallow or a smore. There is a hint of hops at the end to balance it out nicely. Mouthfeel is good. It is medium bodied and I could easily drink a couple more of these. Very tasty.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,musingmonkey,3.75,"Poured a clean amber into my glass with a fluffy head, which sadly remained but a few minutes before subsiding with little lacing to remind me it was once there. Right from the pour you know this beer is about malt. Heady biscuity aromas prepare you for what is a very malty beer. Again, smooth biscuit caresses the palate, with a slightly grainy finish, and only a little bitter bite. The taste is lovely, but you won't find a complexity of flavours to distinguish from. Very smooth, medium bodied. Quite drinkable. I will be trying this again sometime.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,medic25,4.2,"It's become a bit of a tradition now that any trips out west will end with me stashing a few of these in my carry-on luggage. The beer pours a nice, clean amber color, with a very pleasant malty aroma. The taste is very nicely balanced; biscuity malt flavor with enough hops to keep things even (I thought the bitterness of the hops was much more apparent when I had it on tap). Drinkability is off the scale; this is a great session beer.

192,607,VoodooBrew,3.75,"Time was, I liked Fat Tire a whole, whole lot. I'm sure the recipe and production techniques haven't changed in the intervening time, however I think my own personal tastes have shifted to where this beer doesn't quite do it for me the way it once did. As such, whenever I'm at an establishment where Fat Tire is for sale, there are usually enough other beers available that preclude me from buying Fat Tire. But when a case is on sale for $15, I have no problem picking it up.  Whereas Fat Tire likes to promote its ""feat of balance,"" I personally feel the beer leans heavily upon its biscuity-malt character, without much hops to equalize things. Then again, if I were to seek balance I'd look in an APA (okay, or a good hoppy Brown Ale). That's just where my tastes are nowadays.  I don't want to sound too down on Fat Tire. I think it is a fine beer, well-made, and certainly drinkable. I think the aroma shows a side of maltiness that you don't usually run into, and to be fair I detect more hop bitterness with subsequent sips. As I said, not too long ago I was a very big fan. But my tastes being what they are now, I tend to prefer a beer that does not showcase cereal, biscuity malt flavors in the way that Fat Tire -- quite deftly I might add -- does.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Little lacing  Smell is chocolate and lemon. Unique. Well done for an amber.  Taste is malt and bready  Dry, carbonated feel.  Drinkable brew, not overpowering by any means.  Fairly boring brew, good for a few beers, but flavor is a bit lacking and it doesn't leave me with an impression.  I bought a 12 pack of bombers from Costco, UNREFRIGERATED.

192,607,acrawf6,3.36,"Pours out a deep amber color with a slight tan 1 inch head that goes down quickly.  Smells, like the bottle says, toasty. It is a toasty malt smell. A slight sweet smell and fruity smell like apples, or apple juice. Just a malty aroma. a little grainy cereal comes to mind.  Taste is decent. a light sweet malty flavor. Malty, but not overpowering, or even that strong. Seems many people would like this, which isnt always a good thing. i dont taste any hop flavor coming out, but it does seem balance like its there.  Mouthfeel is ok. average carbonation. This is a malty beer, hops are a little too outweighed here. It dries my mouth.

192,607,longarm,4.3,"Growing up in Ft. Collins, this likely pushed/enticed me into the wonderful world of better beer. I remember its excellence on tap or in bombers from local distributors, but my experience trying it in distant locales has previously been a little disappointing. I'm hoping they've improved freshness, since I picked up a 12 pack in Arizona for a taste.  Beautiful amber coloration. Decent carbonation bubbling from the glass bottom enhances the visuals, but little to no head or lacing quickly fades.  Aroma has sweet carmelized malts mixed with date/raisin and maybe a little apricot.  Almost backwards from my expectations, bitterness ebbs from the first dose of flavor, followed with a brief kick of sugary malt that fades into a sour-bitter haze. I taste a moderate dose of hops that didn't seem at all present on the nose. The contrast between expectations announced by the aroma and the actual flavors the appear is dramatic IMO and make this a far quirkier brew than I ever remember or imagined. This odd result is enough for me to bump it up a half-point on both drinkability and flavor, since it seems like an accomplishment rarely achieved and certainly not achieved with the accomplishment here.  Mouthfeel is clean and certainly well-suited to quaffing repeated brews.  Not a Belgian, but not a simple amber either, this beer refuses to color within the lines and stands as a true testament to the spirit of the late 20th century microbrew revival in the U.S..",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Tupperwolf,3.05,"Pours into my nonic glass a reddish-gold with a short, fizzy head that falls quickly to a thin ring. There's a little lacing left that's persistent, but there's not much of a head to leave lots.  Smell brings to mind peaches, pears and cat... um... well... cat piss. Some fruitiness and acidities. Really not so bad, just not so great.  Subtle tastes; Fruits, grains in crackerish form, a very brief hop bitterness. Pretty well balanced, I guess. Just kind of unenthusiastic in total flavor quality.  Mouthfeel suffers; Not enough carbonation, or rather not carbonation of the right sort. What's there is too tight to really excite the flavors around the palate, and it completely cleans the palate upon swallowing, leaving almost no aftertaste or after-feel.  Definitely drinkable with food; I had this with pizza and it was a jammin' combination. I wouldn't choose it to drink it by itself, though.

Bitterness is subtle. It has a clean crisp feel on the palate, and isn't too thin. I always think of Fat Tire as good drink paired with a meal, but not that exciting by itself.

Lots of lacing down the side of the glass.  Smell is a little sweet, but very complimentary to the hop profile. Hops are fruity and sweet and very pleasing and approachable.  Probably my favorite session beer of all time.

It has enough quality to endear beer enthusiasts and is yet approachable enough to appeal to novices or those who dont normally drink craft beer.  It's flavor and aroma are dominated by major biscuity maltiness. Hop rates are not high but balance well to accent the malt. A very drinkable, refreshing ale.

There's a nice hop presence in the mid-tones that gives a slight grassy taste to break up the big malt presence. Very subtle fruit presence near the end - some bananna, and even a yeastiness. Very distinct flavor that's hard to confuse, but easy to remember.  M: Moderate carbonation. Dry feel in the finish and satisfying until then.  D: Very drinkable.

192,607,twilight,3.21,"I don't get it.  Amber orangey with nice lacing and a nice flat bubbly head that laces atop the brew through out. Aroma is fruity, almost reminiscent of Froot Loops.0  The taste, however, is like hard water with spent grains, kind of like that bready taste I don't really like. Slight thin fruitiness with some roasty grain feeling and an acidic/tannin-like aftertaste that is more reminiscent of grain than hops. I don't get why this beer is so popular. Tastes like a souped up amber ale but with a strange aftertate.  This beer is okay, but it is neither here nor there, and the strange Froot Loops taste is pleasing and not pleasing at the same time. Certainly a good brew, but one that I will probably skip in the future. Unless I'm in Colorado, of course...

Smell: Buttery and rich, reminiscent of Brazil nuts, pine nuts, and creamed corn. Caramel malts, toasted wheat, and light, citric hops round out the aroma.  Taste: Everything from the aroma is here, and then some. More hoppy than the nose let on. Strong nutty taste. A bit more malty than I generally prefer for the style, but still very well-balanced with a pleasantly dry, lingering finish.  Mouthfeel: Big, soft bubbles create a thick, creamy froth in your mouth. A bit sticky. Great for the style.  Drinkability: I think I could drink this every day. A great sit-back-and-relax beer.

I could drink Fat Tire over and over, and I have. My first encounter with Fat Tire and New Belgium Brewing was in 1997 and since I live in the East I've been hooked ever since.

192,607,yelterdow,3.89,"Freshness date: 05DEC05.  Served at forty-five minutes over fridge temperature into a Fuller's becker, with much anticipation.  Fat Tire; I never thought the day would come that I would get to sample this classic amber. A friend brought a case back from Colorado to Jersey, and here I sit before my only bottle. Time to hop on the bike...  Appearance- A very pale amber that supports a rugged, two finger head on a rough pour. The bubbles are unusually large and loud, finally quieting to a thin mat. Almost perfect clarity.  Smell- If you could crank the levels of ""sweet"" and ""toasty"" both up to 10 simultaniously, and then take a whiff, you would have Fat Tire. Frankly, I have never smelled anything like it... sometimes with a fantastic quadrupel, I find myself with nose buried into a snifter, taking in the magic of the Belgian ways... but never have I done so with a ""domestic amber"". I get toasted sesame seeds and fresh bread from a bakery just under way at 5:00 in the morning. Magnificent.  Taste- Well done biscuits with sesame seeds, a nice malty character with only a trace of hops. Lingering toastiness in the mouth long after the swallow.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Small, sharp, aggressive carbonation that might best be countered with food... a bit much on its own. The huge toasted maltiness begs for full attention, and grabs it by drink's end. I am glad to have sampled this truly unique beer from a city I probably will never have the pleasure of visiting in the near future.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Shovelbum,4.07,"A creamy white head over a translucent amber body. Great lace and average retention. Smells of warm biscuits and caramel malts, floral hops. Hints of fruity esters and Belgian yeast. Biscuit and caramel malt flavors with an underlying hop bitterness. Light sweetness. Lean body, smooth in the mouth with a lingering slight bitterness. Very drinkable.  A great session beer. This is definately an American-Beligan hybrid, and therfore in my opinion deserves very high marks within the category of American Amber Ale. Despite its rapidly increasing distribution and what I can only guess must be exponential growth in production, this continues to be a solid brew and a wonderful specimen for beer reeducation. I hope the wider distribution is foretelling a mass shift in American tastes. Thank the gods for New Belgium.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Aroma boasts toasty biscuity malt, a note of caramel, and some earthy hops. Mouthfeel is light medium with moderate carbonation. Tastes pretty good for what many label a ""crossover beer"". Toasty biscuit drenched in caramel gives it a sweetness that is well balanced by a soft earthy hop bitterness. Some yeasty breadiness adds a nice touch. Very pleasant tasting and well balanced.

My first impression when smelling this beer was sweet malts, some grass and a bit of hard candy.  The taste tracks very similar to the smell. This is a sweet beer with hops pushed into the background. You also get some fruit and a dash of nuts. Not bad at all if you like a sweeter beer.

Smell is faint but what I can detect seems sharply sour.  The start of Fat Tire is rough with plenty of hop bitters. The beer then settles medium-bodied, bitter, and with a distinctly heavy taste. Flavors in this beer include caramel and oats, but it is overall slightly dry in the mouth and unpleasant. Finish provides the strongest of the flavors in this beer with just one extra bitter hit as Fat Tire heads out of your mouth.

Smell  malt, grass, mild hopiness  Taste  moderate heavy sweet malt. There is a wonderful burst of malt at the beginning of the sip, followed by a brief hop taste that rises and falls across the palate pretty quickly and never outsteps the sweet malts. The substantial malt body carries through the long finish.  Mouthfeel  medium-rare. The malts are so significant in this one, it's almost easy to overlook that is has a surprisingly light mouthfeel.

Nose brings a raw malty feel to the nose, along with that is a fresh field note of wheat. You deffinetly notice a herbal backround also.  Enters the mouth with a distinct nutty, herbal feel. Maybe a hint of hazel nut. A very raw fresh feel overall to this beer but it is smooth and mellow, wery easy to drink.  It finishes soft and fuzzy on the mouth.  A very nice american belgium amber.

The aroma was nice caramel coupled with a good malt backbone and a nice nuttiness. The aroma most closely resembled Munich malt.  The flavor was malty with a nutty character and a light hop bittering which kept the malt in check. The malt and hop balance was well done but malt led the charge and won the war in this battle. The flavors were nicely crisp.  The finish was dry with a light crispness into the afteraste. The body was medium and well done with a nice acidic bite from the carbonation.

First off, the ringed brown bottle with the brewery name was pretty cool.  Your expected amber with off white head and a load of carbonation feeding it. Not much retention, but excellent lacing throughout the pint glass. Bready and caramel malts with just a little bit of herbal hops. That same caramel and biscuit malt comes back in the flavor. The herbal and citrus hops are there in the finish. Comes off as an easy drinking medium bodied brew. Not earth shattering, but smooth, drinkable, and enjoyable. I see why this appears all over the state.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,orbitalr0x,3.82,"Thanks to mentor I finally get the opportunity to try this one! Pours from the cool ringed bottle a crystal golden amber color with a small sprase white head that quickly recedes. Aromas of are big on freshly baked bread with ribbons of caramel. Subtle herbal/citric hoppiness lingers in the background. Biscuity. Laid back nose.  First sip brings a big caramelly, biscuity bready maltiness that rushes across the palate with some light fruit tones peeking out as well. Mellow, clean herbal, slightly citirc hops follow on the way down. Toasty flavors abound and set this one apart. This might not be anything earth shattering...but it's a solid amber ale.  Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied with a light silkiness as it rolls across the palate. It works well for the style. As for drinkability...I could easily session this beer and see why it is so popular. A great crossover beer that's easy to approach. It's too bad I can't get New Belgium brews in IL yet.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Gaisgeil,3.6,"This one wasn't quite what I was expecting when I ordered, but an interesting pint just the same. On tap @ The Flying Saucer, San Antonio TX.  Pours a dark amber in color, with some ruby tones around the edges, brown toward the center of the glass. Nose is quite grainy, bready/biacuity, quite sweet to begin with but there is a faint hint of a hop profile detectable. Taste is quite strong following the nose closely, tastes much strong than 5.3% to me, that's for sure. You taste every percentage point of that one, for sure. A bit harsh and astringent, I can't help but to think it may have had something to do with tap line problems though, keep 'em clean boys! Quite malty though, and quite syrupy in a fruity sort of way, a bit overpowering to that end.  Not a bad beer, but as it was server it suffered from some balance issues and some unintended flavors I think.  Slàinte!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Domingo,3.48,"One of my session beers of choice, especially when it's available in any bar or restaurant in the state. Here in Colorado it's also the ultimate fallback beer as you can find it literally anywhere beer is sold. Color is a rich reddish brown. I'd describe it as the color as finished cherry wood, but still opaque enough to see cleanly through. The smell is of roasted malts, but with a sweetness at the end. Taste is very clean and reminds me of roasted malts, but shockingly with a tiny hint of strawberry thrown in. I've never heard anyone mention that (other than myself) but once I mention it, it seems like everyone notices it! There's also a hint of a graham cracker flavor. Not a strong hop presense, but there's a hint in the finish. It's one of those brews that I can keep drinking one after another. ABV is just right, too. It's not perfect, but for the price and availabilty it's a great everyday beer to have on hand. It's also a wonderful gateway beer for those who've only been exposed to BMC.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mushroomcloud,3.8,"Fat Tire is a bright, clear amber color with some gold highlights. A 1/4"" off-white head falls quickly to a cap. Very light lacing.  The aroma is bready with a bit of chocolate from the malt. Nice hoppy citrus character mixed in with smell of hay. Nice malty aroma.  Taste is earthy with some of the chocolate malt from the nose. Some sort of grainy(oat??) flavor in there as well.Light hop bite in the liquid as well. Nicely balanced overall, leans only slightly to the malty side.  Mouthfeel is good, it is a little less than full-bodied but worlds away from thin. Good carbonation, high drinkability. Smooth easy session stuff full of good flavor.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Gavage,3.98,"Appearance: clear amber in color with a 1"" head that slowly receded to a surface foam. Spotty lacing develops.  Smell: the aroma is of caramel and soft citrus.  Taste: this beer has a nice dry malty backbone as caramel, light orange, bread, and a mild bitterness complete the flavor tones.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. The mouthfeel is dry and lightly crisp at the start, and finishes dry with a short caramel and bready aftertaste.  Drinkability: a solid beer that is nicely drinkable on any occasion.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Backer2004,4.3,"I've been thoroughly impressed with this Amber ale since visiting Colorado last year (though for some reason, I failed to review it). Excellent balance of malts and hops makes this one of the most drinkable beers I've had in quite some time. Nice light ruby ale with great mouthfeel. Too bad I cannot find this Charlotte.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,DogFood11,2.4,I'm having a bad night of reviews. This is the second beer in a row that had dissapointed to say the least.  The biggest problem I have with this beer is the heavy grainy/earthy smell and taste that you have to basically drink this quickly or the aftertaste will annoy you. Malty but this beer is really unfocused on what its supposed to be. It wants to be an amber ale but its to earthy/biscuity to qualify in my judgement. My wife tasted it as well and couldnt take another drink and she loves amber ale's. sometimes theres a reason that beers are on-sale all the time and this one seems to always be on-sale.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RBorsato,3.65,Hazy light golden with a nice light beige head and nice active carbonation. Toasty biscuity grainy malt aroma and flavor. Nutty character with no hops noticeable. Light-medium bodied and fairly smooth with a dry toasty malt finish.  Good but highly overrated. I don't get it but remember only tasting hops in this once when I first tried it on draft in CO.

192,607,carln26,3.65,"This poured from the bottle a clear gold to amber with a decent sized cream colored head. The head receded quickly and left a nice lace on the glass. The aroma has a bit of roast malt up front backed by caramel and toffee from the malt. The taste has the same roast malt with a little nutty character. The caramel toffee note is there too, and just a hint of citrus from the hops. Nice smooth mouth feel leads to a high drinakbility. This is the Rocky Mountain and Midwest staple. Every liquor store and many bars have it available. Not a bad choice.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,far333,3.95,"Pours a light honey color, with a beige head that rises up and settles quickly. Subtle aroma of lightly toasted malt, a bit flowery, some honey and fruit. Flavor is unassuming, lightly toasted malt, no hops to speak of, bits of honey and butterscotch, but not much else. Smooth mouthfeel, even carbonation. Good with a meal because it doesn't overpower any flavor but accompanies many pretty well. It's just a solid basic beer with good malt flavor, very drinkable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ryantupy,3.81,This poured a very bright copper hue. It smelled like biscuity malt with a hint of something floral. I wasent to concerned with the smell as it was the taste I most enjoyed. It was very medium bodied (but in a good way) very clean and very smooth going down. Very malty and toasty especially the lingering aftertaste. Its a great Ale my friends and I enjoy and I definatly reccommend it.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,connecticutpoet,3.35,"This was a clear, amber brew that arrived with not much head. Not sure if they poured it that way or not.  Aroma was mainly malty and not sweet. Not too many layers to it.  Taste was of bitter hops over a medium malt body. Again, not too layered, but not bad.  Mouthfeel was pretty normal for a beer of this style. Drinkability... well, it was about average. Nothing tremendous. Better than the macros they had on tap, that's for sure.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,rowew,4.02,"Presentation: 12 oz long neck bottle with a raised ring on the neck Best before date, ABV, and recommended serving temperature all clearly marked.  Appearance: Poured into my New Belgium globe (great all purpose glass, by the way!). Red orange color with a medium sized head.  Smell: Lots of biscuity malt and some bread and yeast mixed in. There is also just a hint of fruit.  Taste: The same biscuit found in the aroma definitely comes through in the beer. Malt dominated, with the hops in the background. Clean and crisp taste.  Overall impression: Does this beer deserve the cult status it has? Probably not. Is it a damned fine beer? Definitely. Great session beer, and no one but the most ardent beer geek or BMC fanatic will ever turn one down.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,weeare138,4.1,"The first time I had this out of a bottle, I wasn't impressed. This was especially true after enjoying it so many times on draft. I must've had a bad bottle because this came equipped to impress. Appears a glowing amber with a frothy 2 finger white head. Tons of sticky white lacing clings to the glass. Medium streams of carbonation bubbles come rising to the top. Smell is of sweet biscuity malts and grain. Taste is of sweet, toasted biscuits backed with a fresh, hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well rounded as the sweetness fades into a crisp, hop finish.  Finger licking good.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,GClarkage,3.08,"05/29/05- Purchased at Piazza's Market in San Mateo, CA  Presentation- 12oz bottle, forgot to look for dates. Poured into a standard pint glass.  Appearance- Golden, maybe reaching for a darker color, pour. Lively pour which disappears soon. Little lacing along the edges.  Smell- Mostly malty scents. A bit of carboard or wet paper scent as well.  Taste- Heavy wet carboard malt flavor. A bit stale maybe? Some very bitter-like hop flavors as well. Is this the Fat Tire everyone is so crazy about?  Mouthfeel- Well carbonated, little aftertaste, but leaves you gasping for water from the dryness.  Drinkability- Truthfully, I'd rather have many beers instead of this one, including even a few macros. Not horrible, but not the taste I was expecting. Maybe I got an old one....I hope at least.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RonfromJersey,3.38,"Bronze body, good clarity, good carbonation, topped by two fingers of tight white foam. Good lacing. Interesting raised collar on neck of the bottle.  Aroma has a strong biscuit quality, and some spicey hop notes.  Taste kicks off with a big brash caramel impression, some spicey noble hops, some fruit, and finishes with a surprising big bite of toast.  Medium mouthfeel. Decent drinkability.  Didn't rock my world, but it did make an ok ""beer before bed"" on my recent Vegas adventure.

192,607,Vancer,4.05,"From the ring on the bottle neck, to the festive label picture, this one pleases a person! A clear (maybe too clear), light amber orange pour produced a small white head. Rich, malty aroma for an amber ale. But the taste, yum, very well balanced (slightly more malty) quaff that has a great toasty, biscuity finish. Somewhat thin, but an excellent summer session brew, or just for 1 or 2 for the deck. New Belgium Brewing Company is wind powered & employee owned. Beautiful.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,beergeek279,4.07,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle into a dimple pint. The color is more golden but slightly amber, with a wispy, ringy white head. The smell is caramel sweetness with a touch of noble hopping. The taste is dominated by caramel, with a sweet honey flavor as well, but well-balanced by a Tettnang/Hallertau hop that provides a presence without being overpowering. Mouthfeel is average. As for drinkability, some could say this is a bit cloying, but I think it's balanced just correctly, and as such this is such a nice session beer that I could easily drink this all day  Thanks to BlueMooner for this bottle. I imagine that people in the western part of the US, with Fat Tire's ubiquity, would be absolutely surprised that Fat Tire is so sought after by people east of the Mississipi where we don't see a drop of it. It's a shame that we don't see it out this way, but I could see myself drinking this one on a hot summer day....a terrific sessioner, and I see just why it's such a hit...one I'd enjoy having again.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,NeroFiddled,4.1,"New Belgium's flagship ale delivers a clear amber body beneath a billowing head of white froth that holds well and leaves beautiful Brussels-lace about the glass. The nose welcomes you with toasty and sweet malt, and that's exactly what you'll find in the flavor. It's malty... toasty, biscuity, and ever so slightly caramelish; laced with gently spicy and delicately floral hops; and backed by a firm bitterness that grounds it before it fades in a short lingering finish. It's an enjoyable, well-rounded, and drinkable ale that makes a great introductory beer for your friends who are used to American adjunct lagers and the golden ""pilsners"" from Canada, Mexico, and Europe; and it pairs well with a wide variety of foods such as grilled chicken, Cajun-style dirty rice, beef stew, soft-flavored semi-hard cheese (Fontina, Muenster, etc.), and French toast and eggs.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Boneheadmx,4.23,"Pours out to a nice orange color. Very inviting. The smell in my opinion is the bad part about this beer. It smells like bread, but in an unpleasant way. The taste is quite nice. Very subtle, with a nice round bitterness that is reminescent of chocolate or coffee. The initial contact with the beer to the tongue is very refreshing, with the bitterness and the malts rushing on as you swallow, and these melt away to leave a tiny trace of the alcohol. It feels pretty nice going down. Feels thicker than most beers, and the carbonation bubbles popping in your mouth gives it a ""spicy"" feeling. very exciting. Thicker than the average beer. This is a very drinkable beer, and I really love it! One of my favorites.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

As I drink it, the problem is, what flavors match up with these aromas? The beer has a great London/English fruity estery taste with christmas ale type flavors of nutmeg and cinimmon. I bet this would be a great mulled beer.  I wish I had more than one of these to review beacuse its a really complex ale that I would like to clone.

192,607,loren01,2.72,"First of all I must admit that ambers are not my favorite type of micro. The one thing that was good about this beer was the appearance, light amber with a decent head to it. However things go downhill from here. I smell a faint biscut aroma, not much other than that, no hoppy smell to speak of. The taste is even worse, tastes like Coors Lite with a little more malty flavor too it. Mouthfeel was just plain flat, no pep to it at all. As I said before I am not a huge fan of ambers but when I do drink them I prefer one that is either more malty or more hoppy. Fat tire just tasted weak and flavorless to me. I will be touring the brewery this summer and I can't wait, however I'll stick to their other brews which I love.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Aroma is fair, with a bit of floral hops in the air, and a bit of caramel.  Flavor is decent for the style, Starts with hints of sweet and toasted malts and finishes fairly dry.

Overall, I think that while this brew strays from what I see as an Amber ale, it is still a very excellent beer. Color is amber, with a thin head that is sustained by steady streams of carbonation. Aroma is a soft chocolate scent with a twinge of tangy hops - mouthwatering. Taste is similar yet more varied, featuring a crisp hoppy start that is immediately accompanied by a rich chocolately malt, and finishes with the original dry-bitter (yet slightly fruity, apples and such) hoppiness. An awesome brew, I was glad to find it - and while is does deviate from a typical amber a little, I would chose this over most beers any day.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Maybe this is somewhat biased, because I have had no beer in a few weeks, but after getting past the poor presentation by the restaurant I was in, it was very refreshing. Biscuity malts and a moderate body were the highlights of this offering. Some fruity flashes were present along with a moderately dry finish. This was the perfect pairing with my post race burger and fries dinner.

Try not to smell this beer if you can avoid it. Smells like a compost pile. The flavor is just off. Skunky and unpleasant. In the mouth it feels like beer, but you don't really want it in your mouth because it taste so off. Not really drinkable at all.

Taste - Bready and busciuty, with some fruity esters thrown in. The hop bitterness is not very pronounced, which lets the beer's malt characteristics shine through.  Mouthfeel - Texture is sort of oily or butter-like without having any off flavors. Body is good.  Drinkability - This beer is easy to drink, and quite pleasureable at that.

Gives off a pear aroma, yeasty, kinda skunky and reminiscent of the dump or the recycling center (though I suppose ""biscuity"" is the more generous term). The strongest points of this beer are its appearance and enchanting tingly feel. Tastes of apples and earthy, doughy malts.

192,607,neonbrown82,3.92,"This was the beer that did it for me. This was the first non-macro I ever had the privelage of trying at the tender age of ~17. Even though it was the beer that sowed the seeds of my advocacy, I tended to pass it up in favor of shitty beer for several years to follow, except for on special occasions since I didn't know any better at the time (beer is beer before you are old enough to buy it yourself). Eventually the Fat Tire faded into near obscurity after eventually developing an infatuation for wheat beers such as Boulevard or Blue Moon. Recently though, my new roommate this semester noticed that I seem to almost never buy the same beer twice asked me if I had drank Fat Tire, which he drinks like friggin' juice when he has the opportunity to have it (since you can't get it here in Iowa). Now it seems that every time I go back home (just across the river from Nebraska) I have to pick up some of this just on principle, just so I can enjoy a good beverage with my otherwise macro loving roomies.  Alright, now that the reminiscing and all that sentimental bullshit is over with, let's talk about the beer. It pours to a pale amber with a thin film-like white head. Now that my beer horizons have extended this is not really all that impressive looking. It used to seem very unique when I first had something other than a fizzy yellow beer. The smell is VERY biscuity. Not really anything else worth noting in the smell since the biscuit malts are so powerful.  The taste is also dominated by biscuit malts, but there is also a hint of fruitiness in the background. I can't help but agree with my roommates that this tastes more like juice than beer, but it doesn't have enough depth of character for me. Nonetheless, it is a very intriguing beer for a brewery to have as a flagship. I will continue to drink this when it is available to me, but my main priority is to drink the other beers offered by New Belgium that I haven't already had, such as the Tripel, 1554, and seasonals. Hopefully we will get New Belgium in Iowa soon, as I heard we are supposed to have it soon (at least Fat Tire and other more easily accessable brews like Sunshine wheat).",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Predominant taste is rich, slightly caramel malt, nutty (toasted pecans?), biscuity and faintly roasted. Hop bitterness balances out well. Finishes malty but dry. Moderate carbonation and body.  A superb session beer, with no obvious faults. We're fortunate in the southwest to have this beer on draft nearly everywhere. No longer do we have to settle for a Sam Adams or Shiner bock.

The head dissipates to nice cling and some edge lacing within 1-2 minutes. Smell is of biscuits, celery, and earthy hops. To tell you the truth, the smell reminds me of beef & vegetable stew w/ biscuits. Kinda odd to me! However, when taking a sip, I notice what I smelled is exactly what I taste. The grainy malts and the biscuits and vegetables comes out right away. I never knew beer could taste like dinner...hell, i thought it was dinner! Anyways, feel is mainly light, tingly carbonation on the sip that follows through til the swallow. Slight alcohol on the finish, but nothing exciting.

The goblet had little head with no retention, only a ring of foam and almost no lace. The Pils glass really showed off the appearance! fine foam arose to more than 4 fingers and coalesced into a course head of large bubbles. The pils retained 1 cm. head after 5 minutes. Lace clinged to the entire glass to the origional pour line after the glass was empty. Got you thinking about appearance ratings? No Difference in the bright amber - copper/gold clear color.  Initially, I was not fond of this taste: bisquit malt and ""undesirable tannin grain flavor -Todd"" the hops seem a little week providing only a ""quicky"" aftertaste that fades too soon. Served beer at 50 F. and tasted slowly until 62 F. the light to almost medium mouth feel improved with temp the malt and bread came out - maybe I just got used to the husky tannin grain.

Faint smells nuts, spices, biscuits all mixed together. Tastes very biscuit-y and malty, like the bottle says. An average mouthfeel, somewhat heavy, but also thin (?).  This beer has a really good biscuit taste. I just wish that taste was stronger because it tastes like it's mixed with malt liquor or something. Still, this beer has a great smell and appearance.

I don't want to spend this review going into the categories of the beer, such as flavor and appearance, because let's face it, everyone knows how it is.  But let's consider that every successful brewery usually has a flagship beer that really makes a name for themselves. This beer, although ordinary in many ways, is also quite extraordinary.  There is a signature yeast strain that they use that creates a very unique flavor profile. It goes really well with the caramel flavor and biscuit overtones this beer has to offer.

The pour was good, it had a nice malty flavor. Very refreshing hop aroma. The hops had a bit of a bite, but I couldn't readily identify them: perhaps it was a mixture of hops.

192,607,ghurux86,3.74,"i've been wanting to try this one for a while but just finally got around to it. this one pours a clear orangish amber color with a small head. the head mostly vanishes really quick but the little that stays around the edges does leave a little lacing. the smell is probably the best thing about this one. smells of malt and some toasted nut. the taste is not bad, it's better than average. mostly malt with a little of that toast at first but the rear is brought up with a hint of hops. the hops are noticeable but not overly bitter. the mouthfeel is average, seems a little thin to me and the carbonation is a little higher than i prefer, it's not bad but just a little much. you can really notice this on the tip of your tongue. although i think this beer is only a little better than average over all, i could probably drink it all night, i would definitely take this over many other beers, but the opposite of that is true as well.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,OStrungT,4.65,"This beer pours a golden amber with a thin white head. The head dissapears quickly. It smells biscuity with a little hint of spice. Maybe ginger. Also smells a little flowery. It tastes sweet with a great ballence of hops and malt. Maybe just a little more hoppy than malty. Very smoothe. Very, very good. This beer is a well rounded beer that can be enjoyed any time. You can easily drink a few of these beers at one time due to the somewhat low alcohol content. Only 5.2% I can not get this beer where I live, but only a few hour drive away, I can, so I usually stock up. I usually like dark, malty beers, but this is definately an exception. Definately worth a try.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,rajendra82,3.23,"Provided in person by Southernbrew, this brown longneck poured fizzy clear yellowish amber. The head was less than ¼ inch thick, although there was a lot of latent carbonation. The smell was a bit unpleasant with some rotting wood mixing with fresh tilled earth. The taste was nutty, grainy, and quite watered down, with some hop bitterness lingering in the background. Mouthfeel was thin, but not maco-ish. The aftertaste was clean, and gassy. This is clearly a beer meant to be a stepping stone from macro-swill, although IMHO Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is much better suiter for that mission.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RoyalT,3.91,"Appearance  This one is a light, clear orange in color with a colossal head that was full and showed great retention. It looked like a beautiful white cloud hovering over an orange sky.  Smell  The light, pleasant grain is complimented with some soft, citrus hopping. The two go well together.  Taste  This is a pretty darn good American Amber Ale. The grain is unoffensive and actually quite nice. The hops are subdued in line with the malt flavors. Theres a caramel flavor throughout that mixes well with the citrus notes.  Mouthfeel  This one is medium-bodied and lightly carbonated. It finishes with a lingering bitterness that gives this ale a well-rounded mouthfeel.  Comments  This beer is so common in every supermarket and quickie mart that I knew it just had to be bad, but it was really pretty darn good.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,KoG,3.08,"I've had this on tap and remember it tasting different.  Filled my glass with a clear orange(Que?) liquid that produced a meager head, but left it all as lacing.  Smell was a bit doughy with a flowery hop essence, not bad buut not astounding.  Taste was not nearly as sweet as I remember. Somewhat yeasty but very clean carrying malt and hop flavor with it. It's allright i guess...  Mouth seemed a little thinner than it should with no real carbonation.  Don't think i'll be getting this in the bottle very often(if ever with so many other New Belgium offerings), much better on tap.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Juggernaut,3.22,"This beer poored a amber/bronze color with a nice white head. It smelled of toasty malt with a nice biscuity note that it is known for.  The taste was well balanced between the malt and hops that made it very refreshing, and just what you would expect from the aroma. The body was decent, and it had a slite bitterness at the end. Overall it was pretty good.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,swid,3.83,"Fat Tire pours a light amber color, and is clear. Strong carbonation. 1/4"" head; moderate lacing.  A strong malty aroma, with the trademark biscuit smell dominant. Just a hint of a piney smell as well. Not a terribly complex aroma, but definitely unique.  The taste lines up exactly with what the aroma promises...an initial malty, nearly cracker-like flavor is prevalent. After a little bit, the flavor from the hops kicks in, resulting in a mild bitterness. Fairly light and crisp for a &gt; 5% ABV beer. Finishes with a mild bread and slightly bitter aftertaste.  In this part of the country, Fat Tire is one of a handful of craft beers that can be found in most bars, restaurants, and stores. It is a great crossover beer, and is a good, drinkable beer on its own merits anytime.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,soulfly967,3.25,"My buddy brought this back from Texas for me, since PA sucks. Anyway, back to the beer. It poured a light oange/amber color with a nice white head. You could clearly see the carbonation, and it looked pretty good. The smell was of biscuits and malt. The taste was also of biscuits and malt and a slight sweetness. The beer was rather smooth, and drinkable too. Not bad, not bad at all.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,brewQ,3.7,"From the bottle, a thin head with nice sheathing action. Color is bronze.  Aroma is nutty, even woody, definitely malty. The taste is even more than meets the eye. I drink this on tap regularly- one of my better regional choices here in KC.  I like the New Belgium offering; haven't hit the Blue Paddle or the Framboise yet but will get around to it.  A good mellow, slightly warming session beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,amicar,3.41,"12 oz bottle from grocery store.  Pours a nice clear brown with a white head which sticks around for awhile, but leaves no lace on the glass. Not too complex of an aroma with faint hoppiness. The taste is a bready/ biscuity with a little well- balanced sweetness. Not too heavily hopped. Mouthfeel is pretty good and has some substance to it. Goes down easily, but after the swallow- the taste disappears quickly.  Overall, a very nice beer. Definitely not one of the beers I'd bring for tasting night, but a good utility 6-er for day to day consumption. I'd get it again as a beer to bring to a party, to not scare off the MBC crowd, but still introduce them to something decent.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,benito,3.31,"The much lauded amber ale of the Front Range...after living several months in CO and giving Fat Tire try after try, I'm not sure what all the hype is about (IMHO it's not even the best amber ale brewed in Fort Collins!)  Pours a transparent amber, with carbonation clearly present. Head is unexceptional, but once poured the beer does have a certain regal air about it. Good lookin' for sure.  The smell and taste are fairly straightforward, with few flavors emerging in the bouquet and a ho-hum carmel-sweetness. To its credit, the beer is very well balanced and the flavors, consistent. No surprising bite, no swelling carbonation, etc. What that makes for is an emminently drinkable beer and an emminently forgettable one.  I'm sure I'll have my fair share more of Fat Tires in my day--it is on tap EVERYWHERE in CO--but given the choice I'll buy a six-pack of Odell's Levity any day of the year.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Southernbrew,3.82,"Brought to me by a friend from Texas.  Pours orangeish-aber with a small, soft head.  Aroma is full of biscuity notes, oven fresh. Pleasant malt sweetness blends with a very faint floral hoppiness.  Medium bodied, fairly smooth. Nice roasted malt flavors, and again very biscuity. Becomes slightly sweet then finishes with a dry breadiness.  Nice amber ale, nothing about it really stands out, but I'm sure this is a nice beer for newbies. A BMC drinking friend of mine tried it and liked it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,oggg,3.7,"Poured freezing cold at Red Robin.  Actually doesn't taste bad freezing cold.  Pours a brilliantly clear orange. Minimal wisps of white foam. Aroma is pretty much nonexistent, even as the beer warms. Sweet caramel malt with a great nutty taste. Minimal hop bitterness. Hint of hop floral character. no citrus. Neutral finish. Light to medium bodied.  Overall: nice nutty session ale that is not bitter. Could be a good newbie beer. Not really your classic amber (high malt and hops and red color)",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Dmann,2.58,"I was quite unimpressed by this beer concitering it has gotten so muc hype over the years. It poured a nice amber color with a nice head that faded quickly and left little to no lace down the glass. The smell is nothing special, some sour citrus and stale bread scents float off of this brew. The taste was not to good either and was plagued by an overly-woody, oak like flavor that was not all that pleasing. This is not a beer I will be revisiting.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Thrasher,3.63,"Ah, Fat Tire. A beer of disputable repute. I have fond memories from a stay in Santa Fe in 1999 -- at the time I loved the beer, thought it one of the best I'd had up to that point. But afterwards I went back to the east coast for a few years, where New Belgium doesn't distribute, and my affection for the beer may have grown as a result of its absence. Now I live in Oregon, and the beer is readily available at every Safeway and 7-11. Fat Tire is back in my life once again.... It's a disappointment. I am hoping the beer has changed over the years, because it's kind of distressing to learn my memory is so unreliable. But Fat Tire is not a BAD beer, and although it cannot live up to its regional hype, it will satisfy many. It isn't a hoppy beer by any means, and is quite smooth, even lager-like. Drinkability is very high. The aroma is not inviting, a bit like sour fruit, but it is pretty mild and can be overlooked. Those who love this beer tend to drink it out of the bottle anyway. The flavor is similarly mild, almost bland, with a subtle caramel roastiness and a strong flavor of peanuts. It's a decent beer, nothing great, but it seems to generate a huge amount of devotion. Judge for yourself.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,donnebaby,3.5,"This amber ale is definitely amber in color. Clear body and an unexpected cream ale-like cream head. A thick drifting collar remains behind for the duration of the session. Nose has lots of body and far more expressive while the head is up--so sniff quick! Toasted low wheat and some booze in the background, somehow.  Taste, too has alot of the toasted wheat germ that was in the smell, which continues into the aftertaste and bitters out into roasted and burnt wheat with the hops. Minerals in the after as well. Pretty heavy body feel to this brew in the mouth, but the strong enough carbonation seems to lighten it somewhat.  Nice amber, but surely not one of the best out there.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,klk,3.29,"I had this one on tap in Phoenix, AZ. The pour was a clear amber color without any cloudiness. The head was not large with little lacing. There was very little aroma to sample with this one -- a little malty, but not strong at all. It has a easy-drinking taste that does not over-power the tastebuds. Taste was decent but nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel was overall decent, but I would only be able to drink two at most. Overall drinkability was okay, it was the best thing on tap at the bar. If it's this versus the standard macrobrewery choices, I would go for it again. Otherwise a taster is all that is recommended.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Taste is sweet and malty with that biscuit flavor popping up again. Nice yeast flavor. Caramel roasted flavor to this is complex and hard to pin down, want to call it butterscotch but it is more than that. Nice nutty flavor.  Mouthfeel is good.  Nice brew to drink not a best of class but a welcome example of the style.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mrpicklerelish,3.83,"Appearance - Pours a nice amber color with a fairly large size head that seemed to stick around the top of my beer even as I took a few sips.  Smell - Upon first smell, I really noticed the malt sticking out above everything else. After cutting through the malt kick a nice hint of fruit could be noticed with a nice compliment of bread as a back note.  Taste - A slight fruit taste after the large malt kick. A small amount of hops could be noted but nothing to overpowering. A very balanced tasting beer.  Mouthfeel - Feels very crisp on the tongue with what seems like a very nice compliment of carbonation. Not too much, not to little, just right.  Drinkability - Very easy to drink and very balanced. Could easily be described as a session beer not only because of the ABV but also because of how easy it is on the palate.  Comments - The flavors are really balance in this beer. It by no means tries to break any flavor barriers, which makes it an easy candidate as an introduction beer into the world a craft beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Actually it just stank. Smells like socks. Some malts there, but mostly socks. The flavor was sock-like too, not that I know what socks taste like, but it's what they should taste like.

A bit of yeast, mildly citrusy/floral, a hint of malt--just a hint, period.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Basically, like drinking a slice of supermarket honey wheat bread. Bit of yeast, slightly nutty, slightly metallic. Finish is slightly... God, who cares, this is pointless. Mouthfeel is EXTREMELY thin and a bit fizzy. Yawn.  Drinkability: So light, you could probably drink one and never realize it. Whether that's good or bad is up to you, I suppose.  I don't know why this beer is so popular.

Some citrusy undertones. Nice crispness in the finish. Really it's all about that bready flavor with the fruitiness from the yeast. A crisp lightly bitter finish. Light and refreshing.

192,607,GreenWBush,3.18,"Fat Tire. How did this phenomenon happen? My friends categorically turn up their noses when I crack my ""expensive"" beer. Still, these same BMC devotees would have paid me a ridiculous amount of money to bring this stuff back to Indiana in bulk. How the people at New Belgium bridged the eternal gap from piss-water to respectable amber ale appreciators is beyond me. More power to them.  Speaking to the bartenders at New Belgium's brewery, it was more than clear that Fat Tire pays the bills but is by no means the brewery's heart and soul. Still, the beer is head and shoulders above most crap out there.  Copper. Slight, clingy head. Biscuit bomb on the nose, with hints of gummy plasticene malt character.  The mouthfeel is a tad clunky and heavyhanded. The package is pulled in with a slight, light bitterness. I could drink this, but no more than one or two.

It's an outstanding choice for those who are looking to graduate from American macro-swill but aren't ready for a heavy or overly-bitter flavor.  Others have noted the biscuity flavor, and I agree that it is very apparent. A small-ish head disappears fairly quickly, leaving a small foam ring that follows the beer down the glass. There is a slight maltiness in the flavor, and a somewhat bitter finish.  The texture is very smooth, making for outstanding drinkability.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

In fact, it has character and lets you know this is no ordinary beer.  A nice golden brown color, I was surpised that it was poured out of the tap without much head. Maybe that is the bartender, though, and not the beer. The first taste is complex and you realize why it doesn't smell so great. The layers of flavor don't allow one smell to come out so it is a mix of peppers, citrus, wood, sky, dirt, etc. It definitely isn't a beer for everyone but that is fine. You'll notice that people seem to like it or hate it and if it is on tap, those who like it usually get that sometime in the evening.

A slight hint of gingerand pepper, perhaps. Nice.  Taste: Starts with a crisp sharp hoppiness with a smooth malt undertow, none of the spiceyness of the smell. Pretty average stuff.  Mouthfeel: Clean, round and smooth, more presence than one might anticipate from an amber ale.  Dinrkability: Perhaps a bit too much carbonation to drink several. Nice enough for a couple.  Overall, I think this beer is better on draught than bottled. Drinking it three miles from where it was put in the keg didn't hurt, I'm sure. I know people who rave over this beer.

The flavor was all malts, no hops or yeast or anything else. I got a whole lot of toasted biscuit. It was good at first but wore on me quick. Really cloying imo. The biscuit flavor clung to my mouth. The body was really light which enabled me to drink this beer rather quickly. I could see how people who are used to the Bud Light's would get into this. It's light in body with actually some flavor.

192,607,ybnorml,3,A bright amber ale with a little head that evaporates quickly. Has a light malty kind of biscuit aroma. A quick short twinge of bitterness to wake up the taste buds.

There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly grassy with some hops present, and a good dose of maltiness. Fairly balanced, but just a little light. The taste is very grassy, a little flavor of rice, even though I doubt it's used in the brew. Fairly malty, but tasted adjuncty. The mouthfeel is fair, a little light. The drinkability suffers some from the taste, but isn't too bad. I expected more in the taste from New Belgium. I don't know why this has suck the cult following that it has.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BuckeyeNation,3.5,"Clear, rich, orange-influenced amber. The head is light tan with a hint of pastel orange and is mildly sticky. It resembles soft meringue as it falls, leaving adequate lace in its wake. The nose is good, not great. It's primarily pale malty with a smidgen of spicy-earthy hops.  Interesting flavor, but I can't quite put my finger on what makes it so. I appreciate lightly toasted malt with an underlying sourness and a component of herbal-earthy hops. Where did spicy go? I think it's the sourness and the hop flavor that strike me as different. The finish is both mildly bitter and lingeringly sour and the mouthfeel is average for the style.  I'm not all that impressed with Fat Tire. The flavor doesn't really push my buttons and no other characteristic elevates it much past above average. It's clearly a well-made beer, but isn't one that I'll drink again. So what's all the fuss about again?",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,smcolw,4.03,"Honey golden in color; clear with an awesome head that leaves a beautiful sticky lace.  Biscuit malt aromas--very clean smell with a slight touch of hop. The flavoring also features biscuit malt and possibly some crystal malt. The hop is subtle but very much present. A very full but balanced flavor.  The carbonation is on the high side, but this counteracts the full body. Lingering bitter hops lasts long after the swallow. This is a very nice ale that would go well with a large variety of foods.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Loki,3.45,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance: Brassy color with a very thin head.  Smell: One of the most unique smells I've ever encounted. Pleasant and not at the same time. Smells of bread and biscuity yeast, but at the same time like a clean, wet dog. Odd.  Taste: Dry malt, butter, burnt toffee, yeast  Mouthfeel: very dry finish.  Drinkability: good, I don't see all the hype, but good beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,watermelonman,3.25,"This poured with a nice deep amber color, without much head.  Grains come through dominating all aspects of the taste.

192,607,studentofbeer,3.96,"New Belgium's Fat Tire is from what I understand one of the great successes of craft brewing in America, with a decent amount of crossover appeal between beer nerds/geeks/snobs and your average drinker. I've also heard it is an overrated brew that's nothing special. When I found some on my recent trip to Texas, I had to give it a shot.  The bottle is very nice--the raised lip at the base of the neck recalls Westmalle. The beer poured out into a straight-sided imperial pint a brilliantly clear honey orange with an almost pink hue. The shortish white head died off pretty fast, but the color in the sunlight is pretty impressive.  A lot of roasted, toasty flavors came through the nose, with banana, roasted nut, burnt malt, apple and soap also figuring in the aroma. It was an interesting scent but not completely inviting.  I let this one sit out a bit so serving temperature was probably more than 50 degrees-- right around cellar temp. The first sip was almost too roasty, with not many flavors peaking through. Coming back for my next sip, a bit larger this time, I found a mouthful of candy sugar sweetness giving way to the darker roasted flavor, which leaves a tobacco taste in the back of the throat.  A bready malt flavor and hints of orange shows up in the middle and in the aftertaste, and the rather thick, oily body coats the mouth.  I had this beer a couple of times during the week in Texas and it didn't taste as good as it did today. I think each of the other times I tasted it the beer was too cold, leaving the roasted flavors intact but killing off the sweet sugar and bread, which made for a pretty unbalanced beer. At cellar temperature it's actually rather tasty, and would make an excellent session beer. Especially for an amber--not one of my favorite styles--Fat Tire does a nice job. The candy sugar/bready tastes put the beer somewhere between Belgium and England, a nice compromise for an everyday offering.  The roasted, toasty flavors still feel a bit oppressive and the slippery mouthfeel lasts a bit too long, but overall it's an enjoyable drink especially at a warmer temperature. Not sure what I would pair this with, although I think it would have been a better choice with the Pad Thai I had last night than the brewery's Biere de Mars, which was overwhelmed pretty fast by the dish.  I can see why this beer has its supporters and detractors, and while it may not be intensely complex as what one might expect from a Belgian pale ale--for instance there isn't much in terms of yeast flavor--it's a good beer that I wouldn't mind drinking for a session, especially if I was feeling burned out on the pale ale American superhop bandwagon of beers.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,HiroProtagonist,3.15,"Fat Tire was served from a 12 oz bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a very attractive shiny and metallic clear amber, and was topped by an ample and resiliant off-white head that left thick and sticky lacing. The nose presented sweet bready malts and a robust, textured grassy-herbal hop bouquet. The taste matched the nose closely, opening up with bready grassy sweet malts with a touch of herbal spice in the transition to a nice orange-tinged crisper and lightly bittered finish...obvious Belgain pale elements.. The body was overly light and fluffy. Fat Tire is an interesting take on the amber style, with nice flavors, but it ends up being overly sweet for my tastes.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Hunter,3,"Clear amber appearance, typical of the style. Head of off-white foam, less than a finger-thick and quick-shrinking. Carbonation quickly shrinks to zero after the pour.  Odd collection of hops, vegetable, and malt in the aroma. Odd, but not unpleasant.  The malt comes through exclusively in the first taste, with a short backbite of hops in the finish. That vegetable/carrot aroma rears its head again in the aftertaste as well. Finishes pretty clean.  I have respect for New Belgium for being part of the vanguard of microbreweries in the late 80s/early 90s that set the stage for the public to demand more from their beer than Bud or Bud Light. But with the appearance of so many other breweries and their experimentation, New Belgium has been left behind. This, their flagship beer, is a solid, acceptable, drinkable brew, but nothing more. Average marks from me across the board.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,moulefrite,3.41,"The infamous fat tire has now crosed my lips, and I'm still the same guy I was before I tried it?! This was a good beer, no doubt, and it gets me excited to know that folk are warming up to better beer. But I don't think it is a great brew. The pour here was a very light amber and the head and stick were generous, while not more than good. Aromas were redolent of horse dung and the straw that the horse eats-I'm guessing this is the malt-peuuu! Anyway, the mouthfeel was generous and clean. Flavors favored malt and toast, while the hop profile was somewhat weak. The beer was beefy, and whole grainy, and caramely, and at the same time downright barnyardy. Not sure this is a barnyardy that I want to re-visit? Thanks to Ron at Gluntz for the sample! The guy dragged this baby back on a plane for yours truly, and I thank him!!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,HochFliegen,4.07,Fat Tire is a great beer in my opinion. Its deep copper color and biscuit aroma with a hint of berry stand out as in no other beer. The taste is a very smooth and fine blend. Its carmel and biscuit flavor are really something. A full bodied beer. Another great beer by New Belgium.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

This beer tastes extremely smooth and easy - nothing about it is on the fringe, just smooth simple maltiness with little hop flavor - light and somewhat bready. Slight carbonation, but smoothness helps thicken up the mouthfeel. The aftertaste, like everything else, is slight and short-lived, but not a turnoff. This beer is extremely easy to drink, but I found it to be too simple - just didn't have enough oomph in any way to keep my interest. Well done - but not my style.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

Great name too.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,woemad,2.68,"Had this on tap in the bar at Denny's near Spokane International Airport (I work there - me and my coworkers went to Denny's because it was the closest open place at midnight). I'd never had it, and the remainder of the on tap selection was peopled with the usual suspects.  My pint was a pale gold color, with a miniscule white head. It reminded me of the disappointing Fish Pale Ale I'd recently had. There was no lacing to speak of.  Smell was rather weak. It mostly consisted of a vague malt sweetness. I detected a slight citrus note that might have been hops, but it was hard to say, it was so slight.  Taste wasn't much of an improvement on the smell. Very blandly malty, with a tiny bit of hoppiness at the end that provided for a little crispness. It didn't taste gross, it was just very, very bland.  Mouthfeel was a little thin, but then again I sort of thought it would be.  This is drinkable in repeated pints because it is very undemanding, though I personally found it too bland to be interested in more than one. This seems to be very popular amongst those who have very little experience beyond the big 3, so I guess it could be a decent gateway beer. I was once talking about beer with my brother. He says his fiance's favorite beer is Fat Tire, then added, ""She's not really into flavor."" From what I understand, New Belgium uses the profits from this to finance their other, far less commercial beers, so in that light, I'm glad to have helped keep them in business. However, unless I find myself in another place where this is the best choice, I see no reason to have another.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,DaPeculierDane,4.32,"One can gather a good account of this beer's qualities from other reviews so rather than be redundant I'd like to share a story, which I hope will show just how special this beer is.  I first had the Fat Tire in June of 1999 at a graduation party in Chicago. Around 8 O'clock that evening with some friends arrived with several dozen cases in the back of their dodge. It turned out that they had driven to some place in Missouri the night before to stock up on the brew for the occasion.  I immediately fell in love with the stuff and was disapointed to learn that it was unavailable anywhere in my area. I asked my ""buddies"" if they would sell me a case, and despite having literally hundreds of bottles of fat tire they all exclaimed no. That was just the beginning of my experiences with Fat Tire hoarders.  After moving to liberal Madison three years ago, I was happy to discover that many of the city's Yippie types keep a tire or two lying around for special occasions. Even these typically generous folks, however, wouldn't share much with me, ""the fat tire's to prescious man. get you own man.""  I put an end to that last month, though, when I picked up a good quantity of Tire in Colorado Springs on a road trip. Refusing to sucomb to the meiserly ways of those who introduced me to the beer, I have sworn to give it away freely and to any who appreciate a solid brew., although perhaps sometimes with a price.  Last week I made my friend Thomas, one of those yippie types that I was talking about earlier, clean my kitchen for a Tire. Despite the grime build up in the sink, and the rotten potato that was sprouting a virtual tree in the corner, Tom thanked me for the brew and offered to help paint my garge for a similar payment in the future.  To date, I can not think of single other beer that so many people will drive so far and go to such great lengths to obtain. Sometimes beers just have a quality that go beyond taste, and they are those beers that become the thing of legend.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,AtLagerHeads,3.65,"A good amber beer from a very good brewery. Fat Tire was on-tap just about everywhere I visited in the Phoenix downtown area recently. Clearly it is a local favorite, and I can see why it is so. The clear amber body sports a nice cream-colored head that laces partially down the glass. A nice aroma of malt is accompanied by decent understated hop notes.  The flavor is a bit more bitter than I reckoned, but not in an overstated manner. Clearly, this is a mature formula brewed to please a large audience and it does so very well. A pleasing feel and good drinkability are attributes of this brew.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,MuddyFeet,4.17,"I was told I would like this beer before I tried it. My buddy was right. It comes in a neat bottle with glasswork around the neck and a swell drawing of a bicycle.

Lightish amber color, very clear, thin, creamy head - which doesn't last. You can just taste the malt and caramel - but only just. A bit light in the mouth - not like it's overly carbonated or anything, it just doesn't have enough body to it to suit me. I guess I'd call that medium body :) Just a hint of hop bitterness.  Hmm. Part of why I give this such a poor review is that I did side-by-side tests with this and 5 other ambers.

A nice looking amber. The smell is syrupy at first before moving along to some mediocre flowery hop notes. The taste is more akin to a red ale in my opinion, and has a nice bready profile up front. A mild bite of hops fills in the middle before the bready sweetness engulfs it once more. Mouthfeel is a little thin but o.k. for the style. Drinkability is average due to the lack of distinctive qualities. A slightly above average amber.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mickeymac,3.6,I've never seen Fat Tire in LA but found it on-tap and in bottles on a recent trip to San Antonio. I enjoyed it a bit more from the bottle but wasn't blown away by either. It's a more or less middle of the road amber with just a bit more sweetness than most. Hops seem to be a bit on the light side.

192,607,gnaussea,3.62,"Hmm... I'm a bit torn. At times I've had this brew and enjoyed it thoroughly, but the flavor collapses if you've had something sweet before it. Either way, it pours an orange amber with a quickly subsiding white head. Smell is the best attribute. The spices are very notable over a strange, somewhat tosted malt that is not depicted by the color. Flavor is much the same. Hops are heterogeneous throughout the flavor, layered on top of the totasted malt flavor, but overall, the taste is thin.

192,607,RootedFool,4.3,"Purchased a six pack at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Pours luminescent amber with a light orange sudsy head. Some stray striations of lacing left on the glass.  Smell is of earthy malts and bright bready notes.  Well-rounded breadiness (or the ""bisquit"" flavor so often mentioned in other reviews, and on the bottle too) is the first characteristic I taste, followed by a distinct yet down-played undercurrent of hops.  The aftertaste returns to the opening flavors of bisquit and malt.  So, in other words, the flavor of this beer comes full circle. Don't worry, I won't compare it to a bicycle wheel.

Taste is unobtrusive, very mild, very slight bitterness with plenty of sweet, toasty grain flavor. There's a somewhat undesirable husky, tannin grain flavor that's very biscuity, but you get used to it. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy on the palate, even. Biscuit finish.  Nothing stellar, but it is what it is and does a good job at that. Did I say that this beer is biscuity?",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,Dubblebock,3.98,"Fat Tire is a beer that has suffered a little from it's own success. I hear a lot of people dissin' it for no other reason that it has an image as a popular and readily available microbrew. Maybe it's a little TOO popular, maybe it's a little TOO readily available, and maybe folks now think that's it's outgrown it's roots. I dunno. What I do know is that Fat Tire is a perfectly good beer, one that I gladly pick up from time to time when I'm in the mood for a good, solid session ale.  Fat Tire pours a nice, deep amber color. The fair sized head will stick around for a minute or two. Good carbonation. The beer has a malty, slightly fruity nose.  Very smooth and drinkable. The malts tend to dominate the palate, but the hops make themselves known on the back of the tongue. Slight fruit tastes are mingled in the body. Bready and balanced, a well-made beer.  A good mouthfeel and easy drinkability keep the score for this beer pretty high. This is a great beer for any season, and it's one to pair with light chicken dishes or even seafood or Mexican.

Not overly intimidating which is good, as this beer is usually on of the first that the macro drinker would try if trying something different. Noticeable hops. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth, easy going down. Drinkability: Very good intorduction beer for macro drinkers. If I have friends who normally won't drink a micro (BMC folks) I think it would be easy to hook them on this beer. Easy to have more than one.  One of the most popular micro brews sold in Lincoln.

The appearance is that of the average american amber, reddish orange with a nice fluffy and almost rolling slightly off-white head. The smell is dominated by light roasted malt, but there is just a touch of hops that touch your nose, and a bit of grain as well. The taste is very much the same, nice malt character with a touch of hops to balance. Nice level of carbonation and medium body make this a pleasant drink for both taste buds and entire mouth.

The taste is very much malty with a bit of hops on the backend. The mouthfeel is a bit light, yet still creamy and smooth. The drinkability is excellent as well. This is what I wish my local yuengling lager tasted like. One of the best amber ales out there, but it sill falls short of the excellent Treogs hopback amber, IMO.

The head had good retention and left some sticky lace down the sides of the glass. The smell was fruity-sweet. Light caramel malt and aromatic hops were evident. The taste was less sweet than what the smell might indicate but was still enjoyable. Some grainy malt flavor was picked up initially before toffee and nut flavors played across the palate. The finish was modestly bitter and nicely balanced the maltiness from up front. The feel was light and smooth, despite the rather vigorous action of the carbonation, and dry.

A silky smooth taste and mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer. Its like another beer I know on draft only in the bottle. The slight biscut and caramel malt texture is balanced by the hops. The after taste is balanced with hops and a Aftertaste leaves a slickness on the cheeks. the overall beer is really good, but I dont understand the phenomena surrounding it.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Nytemare,3.95,"Poured a nice clear red with a light and fluffy off white head. Smelled of bready malt with a light hops and floral boquet. Tasted bready and sweet up front but turned slightly sour and bitter as the hops came through to balance it nicely at the end. Some spice in there as well. Light and oily. Clinged to every surface of the mouth. I could easily find myself drinking lots of these, in fact, I have found myself drinking a lot of these. One of my favorite choices for when I'm going to have several friends down at the lake. After a hard day skiing and swimming and fishing, it's great to sit on the deck and enjoy a few of these.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Hobbz,3.8,"Though my review is from the bottle, from my limited experience I think I prefer this beer from tap (maybe because I'm on vacation, and then everything is ""sweeter""?).  Reddish hue, while still a bit transparent. Barely foam on top after the first ""hit"" while leaving small bits of round-the-glass lacing. Smooth quality to the mouthfeel and the taste is sweetish and somewhat fruity.  Overall a good stand-by US pale ale in the ""older""/English style since it's hops are understated.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,CBFanWish,3.94,"I would drink this every so often when I was in the Army and had the opportunity to drink some again th other day. So I did. I like this beer. It has The average golden color was the lowest point of Fat Tire. It had a sweet inviting smell to it. I drank is tasting hops, but not as bitter as it could have been, which is good for this particular beer. It was an easy drinking beer and a good beer for playing a game of pool or darts.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,RenoZymurgist,4.2,"Finally Fat Tire is in Reno, i talked to a distributor a few weeks ago and found out this was coming and i reserved a case. This morning the beer truck arrived at my work and i was very happy to see the keg of Fat tire as well as my personal case. I love this beer and i am very happy to have it on tap where i work so that i can have a pint with lunch. Lacy white head maintains itself quite well atop a very lively carbonation. Clear deep gold with a touch of amber color makes this one of the lighter ambers i have tried. Aroma is of dark toast and a hint of fruity esters. Flavor is a malthead's dream as it is a blend of light carmel balanced with a definte toasty bread flavor and a bit of hops to keep things in line. A hint of chocolate lends itself to the finish which is very clean with no bitterness. Medium bodied that is almost light which adds to the drinkability of this brew, definetly an excellent brew that i am very glad is here in Nevada to enlighten the populace.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Boto,3.5,"The beer is a somewhat reddish color. A bit of an off-white head. There was some lacing down the glass. Mild aroma of hops and malts. Medium bodied malt sweetness to taste. Some hints of caramel. Not quite sure of what this is trying to be. Is it an Amber, is it a Belgian? It is somewhere in between. I know this is more of a beer for the masses, but it could be so much better. Nice flavor, a little sweet.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

My first try of New Belgiam and I'm relatively impressed. I know this is meant to be one of their more dumbed down beers, but actually I think it has some qualities beer gurus will enjoy..Very solid Amber Ale I would buy again..

192,607,palliko,3.35,"I have an ambivalent attitude toward Fat Tire: I have found it to be the only choice available on tap (excluding the stainless steel standards) and have found it acceptable. But other times, by comparison with a really good pale ale, marginal. The appearance is copper with a small crest of foam; some lacing; bouquet is mild hops, malt and yeast; the initial sweetness that tempts one to drink more is betrayed by a flat, uninteresting middle. Then just when you are ready to abandon ship, the after finish quiets down to a mellow warmth, and you are not sure if it was good, bad or indifferent. There are better choices out there.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Gueuzedude,3,"Topped by a thin quickly disappearing head. A pretty copper color. Smells nothing much more than beery, but in a good way that reminds me of a dried cracker aroma. Light sweet taste with a cracker-bread bite to it. This is a good example of a beer with biscuity cracker flavor in it. A slight hint of some off putting taste, but this fades quickly. No real hop presence to speak of. This is a fairly bland beer from a brewery that so much good beer has come from. Oh well at least it allows NBB to make other great beers. This I would rate as serviceable when nothing else is available.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,tar,3.83,"This is a beer I've always enjoyed every time I've had it, either on-tap or from a bottle. From a very attractive bottle it pours a nice amber with a medium thick off-white foamy head. The head sticks to the glass a bit and includes some rather large bubbles. The aroma is pretty nice, malty with a bit of hops. The taste is quite good, malt flavors really come through, and there is a nice ""baked"" biscuity type flavor as well. A hint of hops is present as well, especially in the finish. Fairly smooth mouthfeel and a very drinkable beer--a good session beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,BeerResearcher,4,"As indicated by my rating, this is a Good beer. Here's an Amber Ale that pours a perfect amber color. The off-white head is pretty thin and the lace trails and fades rapidly. The aroma is malty and lightly fruity. The full malt body is caramel sweet and nearly syrupy. A lightly lime citrus and slightly spicy bitterness provide some balance to the sweet maltiness, but I would have preferred a bit more hop bite. This is a nicely made session ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,stoutman,3.47,"A nice refreshing Amber Ale. Not a whole lot of character, maltiness, hoppiness etc, but very well balanced and enjoyable.

192,607,Hefe,4.21,"Tasted on 8/21/03  This one provided by a friend who picked it up in Cali while on business. I've been hearing about it for while here on the East coast, mostly from chagrined beer shoppers just finding out that the great brew they had out West just can't be had on this here side of the states.  12 oz. brown glass bottle. With drink by 10/14/03 freshness date.  Appearance: nice honey/gold with red tinges.minimal head, basically just some lacing across the top and around the edges.  Aroma: Grapefruit, malt, and honey, with almost a shortbread(?) nuance to it.  Taste: A touch of sweetness initially with great, malty-citrusy flavors. A bit of a toastiness spreads across the palate after a moment or two.  Mouthfeel: Nice richness, fuller than I expected.  Drinkability: More please!  After finally getting to try it, I'd say It lives up to the hype. Well Done!  Tasted again on 8/28/04 Just an addendum or two. I noticed more of a brioche and brown sugar flavor in the background this time around, more than a hint of sweetness is evident. Nothing that makes me want to change my score, except to bump the drinkability a touch.. Easily accesable and pretty darn enjoyable.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,LiquidBreadMan,3.5,"This beer poured a light copper with an average sized head, which lasted a little while. The smell was a pronounced combination of roasted malts and citrus fruit. The taste was reminiscent of the aroma: carmel and grapefruit. Delicious. Mouthfeel was slightly less-than-fully carbonated. I'd have preferred a few more bubbles but this one drank easily either either way.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Stubbie1,4.2,"This amber ale poured a nice gold color. It is finished off with a small white head of foam. The foam stayed a spell but is soon replace with a nice sticky lace. The aroma in this ale was unreal. This is my first beer with a bread/dough aroma to it. It was a pleasant surprise and not to overpowering. The taste was a sweet start to a nice malt background. The bread/dough aroma turned to flavor, is absorbed by the taste buds. Nicely balanced flavor with the malts and hops. I could enjoy this beer through out the night. Nice and clean in look, aroma and taste. Very nice!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Maestro,3.52,This beer is interesting. A friend brought it to me from Denver on the plane. I am not sure if it is fresh or not. The taste is quite yeasty and very odd. But I like it. The head is thin but leaves some noticeable lace. The hops are hard to pinpoint. They are very subdued. The malts are are not very bulky. Not a lot there. This reminds me more of an ESB than an amber but it is decent. There is a slight metallic taste left to linger. I am not sure of the direction of this beer but it is quite different from things I have tasted in the past.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,alexgash,3.62,"Pours a golden yellow--not amber, interestingly enough--with an average-sized white head. Smell is of rich malt with some hops.

192,607,kindestcut,3.54,"I will defer to my review of Fat Tire from the bottle except for a very important difference I could detect. The mouthfeel.  Fat Tire looks nearly identical, although I believe my bartender could have poured the beer a little better to achieve a more substantial head. I'll keep the appearance score the same since I've had several Fat Tires on draft and the head was nearly always pretty good.  As for the mouthfeel, I found the Fat Tire on draft to be more carbonated, which made for a more drinkable beer in my book. All in all, this is a very good beer made a little better.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,TripelJ,3.38,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle poured into standard pint glass with almost no head.  Amber Ales tend to be unique, and this one follows suit in that respect. First the head, minimal to nothing which put the guard up. Smells a little funky, like someone cooking chicken and dumplings, but definitely an odd smell. The taste provides the ""equillibrium"" the bottle brags about with a definite mild biscuit flavor with a nice malty sweetness. I do not detect too many hops here, but probably enough just to balance it all out. Worth a try if you are looking for something different or are into amber ales.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,garymuchow,3.97,"Obtained from a friend of mine who brought it back from Colo. when he was on a business trip. Thanks John! Initially a pretty standard pale malt aroma with a pinch of flowery hops. This was followed by a very pleasing bisquit aroma. Head leaves too quickly. Color is a nice orange amber and very clear. Flavor is very much like the aroma with the bisquit quality leaving a very pleasant lingering. Not much complexity beyond that. Good balance of carbonation with a fair amount of fullness from the carbonation. Medium to thinner mouthfeel. Slightly rich. This is an enjoyable and unique beer. Well crafted and highly drinkable.

192,607,Rumrunner,2.47,16 Oz. Pint style glass This was not my favorite amber ale. I personally did not like it. The appearace is nice. Medium amber with a small head. Nice bubbles when looking through the glass. The smell was better than the taste. Nice biscuit scents with mild hops and a delicate fruitiness.  Here is my problem. The flavor. The biscuit turned to charred burnt toast. All the fruit flavors were gone and the malt took over and crushed the hops. No balance and the burnt flavor killed it for me.  I found the mouthfeel and the drinkability unpalatable. After every sip there was an oily feel in my mouth. This oily feel left a tang flavor that I did not enjoy. This ale did not go down well for me.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,cokes,3.3,"Earthy pale amber under a virtually non-existant foam. Bready nose. Doughy mosty, but with underlying toasty wafts. Pretty straight-by-the-nose taste profile. Biscuit malts up front, leaning towards toasted white bread by the midsection. Supressed flourish of cocoa, and ghosts of fruitiness. Lightly floral hop closure. Nothing ever stands up and asserts itself. It is not bad, just bland. Medium light bodied.

Clear, light caramel forming a thin white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is fruity, biscuity, toasty, grainy with light must and apples. Taste begins with floral hops, delicate brown toasty malts, and a earthy finishing bitterness. Crisp, extremely brisk mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation and lightly dry finish. The bottled version takes awards for looking nicer, but the draft version has a smoother mouthfeel and more aromatic complexity.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

The only smell that really stands out is a nice sweet malt aroma.  Mouthfeel is alright, and I really enjoy the taste of this. Nice and refreshing maltiness that I liked immediately.  This is an all around tasty beer thats good for putting a few down on a relaxed night. I like malty ales and this is one that goes down smooth and has very little problems with it. It might not be exceptional, but it sure isn't sub par.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Mark,3.47,"This beer did not measure up to it's appearance which was a lustrous clear light amber. I thought someone had pulled me a pint of cask ale in the U.K. Head retention was excellent and lace sheeted my imperial pint glass. It was kind of average city after that though. A benign aroma was followed by a mostly malty, lightly hopped flavor. This is a winner for me usually but I expect a little more from U.S. good beer.

Put it this way: I visited three hotels in the state of Arizona, and beyond the usual suspects, this was the only ale offered at all three. This is a beer that should be concerned with continuity and consistancy. Having had it in several instances, I did think that the New Belgium people had done a good job with that. The sampling I had first was served too cold, but it is the one I reviewed.  Using Anderson Valley as my baseline for ambers, (I cannot think of one I've had in ME) Fat Tire was lighter in both color and malt flavor presence. It had more hope bite than I would have expected from an ""amber"" style. I had readied myself for a caramel flavor and had to accept a lingering malt sweetness in the finish.  Maybe I should use Fat Tire as my amber baseline: nothing too special, but nothing out of place. Seemed like a bridge between brown and pale without asserting itself in either direction too much.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

This is one of those classic beers that you can find everywhere, everybody can drink and enjoy, is fairly cheap, and makes a great party drink since you can drink several of them easily.

192,607,BigHead,3.6,"Fat Tire is in almost every restaurant out here in Phoenix, so I end up drinking it often rather than succumb to the macros of Bud, Miller, etc. that are on tap. I find it to be a sweet beer, malty for sure. The lack of hops does detract from its overall character, but I am not one to hold a grudge as long as the experience is still a good one. Depending on the pourer, you might get some head...on the beer that is. The copper red color is nice as well as its drinkability. It is a sweet beer so if you don't care for that, then you'll only be able to down a couple. I recommend as a good party beer, unless you get Coors Light and hope for the twins to show up.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82

192,607,marburg,3,"So I walked into Putnam's store today and was picking out some beer for a party when he offered up a bottle of Fat Tire that he had lying around. I'd never had it since it doesn't get shipped out here, so I gave it whirl.  So here's the review: it's freakin malty.  In all seriousness, it's got a strong malt nose and a stronger malty taste. It's a drinkable brew for sure, but the excessively malt-sweet flavor is so potent that I couldn't possibly have more than one or two at a time. Poured will very little head and had a fairly simplistic aroma to it. Tasted like it was barely hopped at all, really. Certainly not bad by any means, but considering The Legend, The Mystery, The Mystique of Fat Tire, I was expecting more.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,feloniousmonk,3.84,"Fat Tire has a bit of a hype around it, especially in regions, like mine, that do not receive this Colorado amber. What could be the reason, I wonder, why do so many rhapsodize so dreamily about it? Is it the equal or better of world classics from Europe, or does it stand out against America's legendary micros? I was determined to find out... Fine, bubbly, but brief, head, over a bright amber color. Nice fruity touches in the aroma, and the more I ""drink in"" the nose, the more I seem to find...tropical fruits, mango, banana?, peach, apricot, a hint of gentle spices, and a whiff of flowers, even. Nice grainy, gritty texture, but overall, very smooth palate. Hops seem to be lying low, and malt does it's part, without taking the spotlight. Slight sourness in the finish, later absorbed by tasty sweetness. Well-balanced, and enjoyable. I can imagine a pleasant session with these. So why the cult status? I have a few theories. 1. Funny name. 2. There's a bike on the label. 3. It's an easily consumed, delicious ale that accompanies fond memories of seeing jam bands in Colorado, and the perfect thing to stock in the cooler at the post-show drum jam.

192,607,LarryKemp,3.33,"This amber beer poured clear with a fair, short lasting head. Its aroma was very subtle. I was in a smokey steak place bar so tha ambient odors may have overridden the beer's aroma. The beer malt predominated the taste. I did not detect hops. The mouthfeel was light.

192,607,TXHops,3.72,"-2 kinds of Munich Malt -Caramel Malt -Magnum, Goldings, Willamette hops -16 IBU's -5.2% ABV -12.2 Plato  I can remember trying Fat Tire in Santa Fe back in about '96, when I was just starting to get interested in beer. I thought it was unremarkable then, though all the members of my family all thought it was pretty good. That was before Fat Tire became the next Sam Adams Boston Lager. Now it's even available in most restaurants in Dallas, sitting on tap next to Bud Light, Coors Light and Miller light.  As always, Fat Tire pours a textbook amber, with a head that appears to be scared of the air, it dissipates so fast. A beautiful waft of aromatic Munich malts rush from the glass and offer the beer's best characteristic--a heady, malty, fresh bread smell. The taste is quite unique, in my opinion. No other beers taste quite like Fat Tire. There's a slight touch of diacetyl in the body, giving the sense of slipperiness and creaminess to the flavor. Add that to the medium-bodied, malty flavor, and the complete lack of hop aroma and flavor and voila--you have the fastest growing micro beer in America!  Not great, but nowhere near as bad as the press it gets from hardcore beer drinkers. Some hops would be nice, but they're not required. The lack of them allows a bit of sourness to develop late, after the finish.

The aspect that stands out the most to me is a unique mellow dry quality. Almost alt-like. I wonder if this is cold conditioned at all. Typical amber qualities are present, but not to a big enough extent. Not enough maltiness or hoppiness. It's more biscuity and toasty. Not bad by any means, but seems a little watered down.

Sweet malts come through up front in the taste along with some biscuity flavors. Almost too sweet. A mild hop bitterness in the finish helps to balance the sweetness somewhat. A good step up from the macros.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Bruiser81,3.7,First tried this one on tap but reviewed it from a bottle. Poured a very clear amber color. The head lingered for most the beer and it left foamy sheets on the glass. The smell is light and almost fruity. The taste is a bit bitter but not bad. The colder it gets the better. I go with this beer because it is easy to drink and you don't get full.

I smell, as well as taste, a little bit o' fruit upfront. The hops finish rather unassumingly...leaving this beer tasting rather herbally fresh.  There is nothing outstanding or over-the-top about this beer, but that is what makes it highly drinkable. It's neither here nor there...it just is. The Tao of Ale.

As stated in a prior review, nothing to stop you from having a few at a time.  Unfortunately, they do not distribute on the East Coast. Still one of my favorite beers.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,PhantomVodoo,3.83,"This beer isn't available in Ohio so some buddies and I went to some great measures to acquire a case of Fat Tire. I'd heard a lot of great things about it and was eager to sample it. It's a good, solid amber ale, but after about two sips I looked at one of my friends and we were both saying it's kind of bland, where's the flavor. Again it's a good beer, but we were expecting a little more from it after all we'd heard about it. Copper in color, not a lot of head. Aroma pretty standard malty amber ale type aroma. Good malty, biscuity, but low-key flavor. In true Belgian style, the beer does have a good amount of complexity, but again it's pretty low-keyed. The fruit and spice flavors are evident, but stay in the background. Hops are average for an amber ale. Solid, very drinkable amber.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Dogbrick,3.36,I saved this one for last out of the sampling of New Belgium I got (acquired via trade). This is one instance where I did not save the best for last though. While this was a very good Amber it is definitely not one of their better offerings. Pours a nice amber color with virtually no head which is a noticeable break from NB's other brews. Passable malt aroma. Rather sweet malt flavor with a slight apple finish. I'm glad I finally got my hands on this but it doesn't compare to the Trippel.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,hyuga,3.6,"Clear amber brew with golden edges. A small head forms on top, but goes down quickly. Like the bottle suggests, toasty and biscuit-like malt dominates the aroma. It smells like bread! You could say this for many beers, but this one has a particularly strong biscuity aroma that gives me that impression. Slight fruitiness and spice in the aroma as well. Lots of malt in the flavor, toasted, biscuit-like, bready, and grainy. Hops are there, but stay subtly in the background. A bit of spicy dried fruit gives complexity and a Belgian feel to this brew. The carbonation creates a Belgian-like mouthfeel as well. Light to medium body. This beer is overrated by the general public, but it's still pretty good. Great session beer. It's also good for converting macroswillers.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,putnam,4.05,"Nice, clear, polished bronze liquid.  Not knowing what ""style"" this was, I did my best to guess based on the nose. The label said Amber Ale and the aromas conformed to this claim. But there was a subtle, sweet spiciness that reminded me of a Dubbel. Not assertive, but there nontheless. These elements rested upon a clean, bright, sunny maltiness.  The flavors were clear and delivered textbook Amber-like features. Dry, caramel, mild bitterness. Supple. The real charm of the bear is its whistle-clean profile. Subtle in an English Amber way. The substance shows on the lengthy, balanced finish. Highly drinkable. A banger.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mjohn27603,3.8,"From 22 oz bottle marked best by 10Nov02. Marked to be served at 45 F. 1/2 "" head with large bubbles that reminded me of cooking pancake batter. First sip reveals big maltiness with caramel flavors. It is not as hoppy as other amber ales. A light and refreshing beer. I'm not able to detect much from the smell. Since I can't get this beer where I live, the allure is a bit brighter. I might become bored with it if were much more available.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,nathi,2.12,"This beer is available everywhere here, and is often the only micro. And when it is....I drink bud. I really hate this beer. The aroma is funky. Not like rich malt, and although it used to, now has no hops or interesting esters to balance the funky aroma that I suppose is toasty, but for some reason comes off kinda vomit like to me. The taste starts off decent but ends with this lingering, cloying sweetness that just dosnt have the richness to be pleasent. Just flat, boring, and unpleasant to me. Like drinking unfermented wort. It needs something there to balance it. Just seems to sit on the tongue.  At least it is pretty.  But, if New Belgium can continue to sell tons of this stuff and be able to keep brewing the intense stuff like their trippel, la folie, mars, etc (not to mention the upcomming collaboration with a certain belgian brewery of some fame), more power to them.  Love the brewery....hate the beer.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,StevieW,4.03,"Draft at the Tap Room in Vail, CO. My first experience with the much heralded fat tire came this past weekend. Nice clear copper color, faint white head, carbonation bubbles last and last. Smell was an interesting combination of malty richness, very slight hoppy undertones, and an uncertain earthiness. Taste was crisp and pleasant to start, nice carmel malts, then again a unique earthiness to finish. Tastes coated and lingered on the tongue. I guess I expected a more noticable hop profile, but it still was very good. Lived up to the hype for me. I wish it was available on the East Coast.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BeerAngel,3.93,"Overall I like this brew quite a bit. Pours a clear pale yellow/amber with a 2-finger off-white head that dissipates quickly yet leaves a lace. The smell is that of a nutty malt with some earthy notes as well. Light bodied mouthfeel with a smooth well balanced flavor of a slight grainy, touch of caramel flavor, and finishes with a pecan type flavor on the tail. Highly drinkable. Cheers!",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BeerBob,4.3,"Fat Tire brew by New Belgium brewing company pours a dark amber from a 12oz brown bottle. Head forms about two fingers worth of fluffy tan foam that settles down to a thin cap and a well defined ring.  Nose is fragrant floral hops and malt with just a slight whiff of alcohol. Palate is a good amount of sweet malt mixed with a nice floral hops.  Not a supper duper top of the line Ale, Fat Tire Amber Ale is well put together and does not disappoint.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,beernut7,4.45,"This is an awesome amber beer. I had it on tap at a Denver Mexican restaurant in a mug about the size of my leg. Awesome orange color and foamy white head with a delicate malt aroma, the first taste of this brew is absolute quality. The light sharp hop presence and delicate malt flavor is followed by a crisp clean finish. Awesome.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,mzwolinski,3.83,"Like Sam Adams Boston Lager, New Belgium's Fat Tire is a great alternative to the macrobrews which seems to be available in almost every grocery store in my area. It's easy to see why. Fat Tire is a great session beer.  The beer is a nice, rich golden-amber color, with a head which tends to start thick and peter off to a thin, patchy top.  The aroma is also rather thin and patchy. Slight nose of alcohol, and you can definitely pick out the malt which will dominate the flavor, but overall there's just not that much to this scent.  Things improve once the beer enters the mouth. The principal flavor is that of toasty malt. As the bottle suggests, it reminds one of biscuit, or perhaps bread crust, though there is certainly a noticeable fruity presence as well. Hops are understated, but just present enough to lend balance to the beer.  Nice body, with just a slight crispness to the finish. It's easy to go through a six-pack of this stuff. I'd love to try it on draught.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Jon,3.73,"Fat Tire poured a nice amber tint with minimal head retention and decent lace. It didn't smell incredible, nor did it smell too bad. The taste was somewhat sweet, with some lingering caramel and toffee flavors. It is very balanced and it's quite easy to put away more than a few of these. Overall, this is a pretty good amber that seems to be rather overrated among the average beer drinkers. Cheers to New Belgium, however, on their excellent bottle labels, which are great marketing tools in themselves.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,bditty187,4.05,"Tawny-gold hue, ultra translucent, small off-white head, peaks at a half finger before fading slowly, a few rings of lace. Lovely, delicate nose nutty, fruity with a whisper of spice and malt. The invitation is soft yet you gladly take a sip. Tasty palate, nutty, crisp malty influence, nicely spicy, some fruitiness. Again the palate is soft but pleasant with just enough of a malty aftertaste to be reminded to drink it again. The body is medium-light, moderate carbonation, fair mouthfeel. Damn drinkable. This is the worlds greatest crossover beer and one hell of a session beer for any BA. The beer is not the second coming, ignore the hype and enjoy Fat Tire for what it is a great Amber Ale.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Pegasus,3.95,"Appearance: Slightly hazy copper color with a small and dense off-white head, lots of sticky lace, fairly well carbonated.  Aroma: Malty aroma with distinct biscuit notes.  Taste: Tasting yields malts, followed by the flavor of fresh home-baked bread and a little hop bitterness at the finish. A mildly sour note runs throughout, it plays off well against the biscuit malt notes. For those who like hops to be understated, as do I, with more emphasis on the malt, this beer is sure to please.  Mouth feel: Smooth, with slight carbonation. I have had this beer many times, it has always seemed a little thin, this is the only real shortcoming of Fat Tire, although a minor one.  Drinkability/notes: An absolutely wonderful beer, rather unique, I cannot recall any other beer that could be called similar.  Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber with a pop off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,usualpulp,3.64,"Once again, the new belgium company has made an good beer. While this is not one of their best, it is the most readily available. It pours a dark amber, almost red color, and has a medium light colored head, which fades quite fast. The is a nice floral/fruit scent to the beer. This is also noticed in the first sip. This is a very smooth beer, with a malty sweetness, and is very easy to drink. I find this beer to be alot better than other ones silimar (i.e. Shiner Bock). On a side note, the beer tastes just as good directly from the bottle, which makes this a nice choice to take to parties, or out on the lake. All in all this is a good beer to keep on hand if you just want to kick back with some friends and drink a few beers",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,jreitman,3.5,"Had this on draft at a local restuarant. Very easy to drink and fits the style well. Nothing extraordinary, but still a good brew. Had this with a nice steak and mashed potatoes. Worth checking out.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,Suds,2.96,"A nice, pleasant beer. My bottle produced a full, but short-lived head. Rich, deep-copper color. You have to hunt for an aroma, but the beer produces an enjoyable, mildly malty finish. No characteristics stand out as particularly notable. Still, its a worthy tavern-food companion.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,marc77,3.53,"The clear light amber hued brew is topped by a fairly thick head that exhibits good retention. Fat Tire is well carbonated, but the CO2 levels still manage to allow for a smooth mouthfeel and medium body. There's just a touch of yeasty esters in the aroma along with a discernable biscuit malt aroma (bread and butter!) The hop bitterness is quite mild and appropriate considering that Fat Tire isn't heavy maltwise. Hop flavor is almost nonexistant, although I do detect a hint of earthy hop-- perhaps Willamette or Styrian Goldings? In any case this is an innocuous, no frills beer. Well balanced all around-- an excellent session brew. This may actually be better in the bottle than on draft.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,proc,3.5,I enjoyed this one. It places somewhere on the amber spectrum between Killian's Red and Bell's Amber. Nice malty taste with a slight hop presence throughout and on the finish. I can see this being a good session ale as it goes down very easy.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,ADR,3.01,"I drank this repeatedly on tap on a trip to Grand Junction and was consistently under-impressed...definitely not highly hopped and the malt did not break through rather than being quite ""bready"" and neutral, unlike a Full Sail (as one example) that will establish a flavor profile...color was good but I find this one of Colorado's most over hyped brews.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,John,3.66,Pretty good for what I find as a typically boring amber ale catagory.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,AaronRed,4,This is a good ale. Nicely hop flavor and well balanced.,New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
192,607,BeerAdvocate,3.92,"Presentation: 12 oz slender brown bottle with raised glass around the neck of the breweries name.  Appearance: Deep golden amber with a patchy white lace.  Smell: Mildy fruity with a malty nose of toasted and biscuity aromas.  Taste: Crisp and medium in body, big malty palate with a restrained hop bitterness that seems to only balance the brew. Toasted malt with a bread crust flavour is the theme, good amount of grain in the finish also. Hint of fruit and yeast adds to the complex flavour.  Notes: Very tasty, good focus on the malt. Great American style amber ale ... very drinkable to say the least.",New Belgium Brewing Company,"Colorado, United States",American Amber / Red Ale,82
