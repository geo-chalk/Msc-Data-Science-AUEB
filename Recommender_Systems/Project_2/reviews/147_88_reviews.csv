147,88,robed,4.52,"This isn't my favourite style but this is an excellently made beer. Melon heavy up front with pine after, then a bit of a sweet malt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tyden46,4,"Fruity at first, then a hoppy bitterness with some pineyness. I liked the sweet malt aftertaste. Better than voodoo, not as bitter of an aftertaste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mactrail,3.28,"Clear amber with plenty of foam in the big Duvel tulip. Aroma of resins and mango. Slightly sweet with a substantial malty body. It seems to have enough hops for a Double IPA. Tastes of bitter citrus and something scorched, with grapefruit peel aftertaste and a dark woody aftertaste. Overall this is the dark and glowering side of IPAs. Bitter, urelenting, acidic. On the plus side the fruity aromatics stay with you while your tongue is being scraped. From the 12 oz bottle purchased as part of the supermarket 12 IPAs pack.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cyclonece09,3.94,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours orange yellow with a fluffy white head. Smells of citrus and earthy hops. Tastes of citrus hops with nice floral notes. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Griffin2,3.94,Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Willi Becher pint glass. L - Pours a clear amber color with a fluffy whit head that dissipates slowly.

147,88,LesDewitt4beer,4.38,"12oz bottle mfr date 8/25/22 from the STONE 12 Day of IPA 2022 Xmas variety pack into a Spiegelau IPA glass. L: Pours transparent amber w a thick 1"" off white head w excellent retention, very well carb'd, head gets a bit pillowy, some sticky lacing. S: Bready, citrus, caramelized malts, lightly floral, melon, grapefruit, ""spicy"" hops, very slightly dank (like .5 of a point), a hint of alcohol w warming. T: Bright citrus, caramelized malts, lemon drop, a hint of bread, lightly grassy, bitter hops, citrus zest, pine resin, melon, grapefruit, a long citrus zest linger. Well balanced tastes. F: Stately w a gentle and crisp bite at first, med bodied w a moderately robust mid-section then a drying finish w a long linger. Med-long taste overall and smooths out over time. O: A beautiful American WCIPA. Hop fwrd, a bit sweet w a bitter finish and long linger. Fairly big, fruity taste, drinks easily and is outstanding in its style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JZH1000,3.73,"Had on tap at Chili's of all places.  On the pour I watched da pretty enormous head form that the bartender poured up to just 1 finger. After a few minutes, the head shrank to a thin covering and ring around the rim. Body is a pale gold, with plenty of fine carbonation. Light but refined lacing is left.  Aroma is mostly citrusy with a great big hit of bright grapefruit. A slight alcohol note is present with some sweetness coming from light malts in the background.  Taste is bigger than the aroma, at least at this temp, but this is a sweet citrusy dank IPA. Pretty standard, but better than voodoo ranger with a bit more depth and bite. Some alcohol is present, and this one is a solid west coaster with a big hit of bitterness that comes with a bit of darkness as well.  Feel is big yet refreshing. With a fine but powerful co2 bite and a long finish with a mouthcoating feel. The bright flavors do a lot for the feel with bright grapefruit rindy notes sticking round through the finish.  Overall this is a classic IPA that has become a benchmark for WCIPAs. It does its job pretty damn well with nice hoppy bitter yet inviting fruity notes, without being tropical, and maybe even being a bit dank.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ant777uk,4.51,"First actual American IPA for ages...never heard of this one before...  Amazing head...a little bubbly...intense colour.  Aroma is phenomenal...melon is dominating. But not as deep and complex as many IPA's or Belgian tripels...  Wowow...this taste is off the scale. After 2 pilsners this literally sets my soul alight. Mouth feel is like an explosion, one of the best that I have ever experienced. Sweet melon, followed by the bitter hops that literally assassinates the melon and creates a ying yang experience...  This is amazing and I totally love it. I'm buying all of the cans in the shop next to me that sells it. As soon as they open.  How could it be improved? I'm not sure...the ying yang between the melon aroma and the mega bitter aftertaste is unparelleled in my decades of beer tasting (drinking till I forget everything) ; )",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NCSapiens,4,"Just a good, classic, standard west coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jonwiseman,4,Vintage in this category and still one of the best ipas ever brewed. Can’t really say anything that hasn’t already been said. Is it bad that I’m drinking one at $13 in Chicago airport at 9:55 AM? Kinda days it all,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MadMadMike,4.16,"Pours clear gold, nice frothy white head that retains well, sip by sip lacing. Citrusy hop bomb. Medium body, xlnt carbonation. Bitterness is a quality hallmark for my taste, so Stone IPA really delivers, without going completely dank. Well balanced everyday quaff, plus it’s readily available everywhere at a reasonable price point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RedStickPhil,3.81,"A gift from Bret, with a connection to UCSB. Thanks! Really pretty to look at, but I don’t see the business of taste as all that special. I guess it is just too long on bitter without much extra nuance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ammo1,4.24,"One of my early go to IPAs. After many years, I've found Odells, Ballast Point, and Elysian provide citrus and floral hop notes that I prefer depending on the mood. Stone has a special place in my heart, a bit one note and not the absolute best. The price is right and is still in the rotation, sometimes for the memories it conjures up. Don't change it Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zman1974,3.33,"It's a high quality, well made beer. Just not for me. The finish is bitter to the point of being off-putting. I just do not want to take additional sips.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gu_re_gu,4.71,The original and still one of the best. Haters gonna hate.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dcat151,3.9,"Golden pour with a medium amount of head that dissipates relatively quickly. Odor is dank, hoppy, and piney. Taste is traditional IPA with hoppy bitterness and a slight bit of pine. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall a good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MarkovBeer,1.36,Stupidly bitter and unpleasant. it's the gargoyle that hypes this up.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ihpjoeguy,2.01,Wow. Way over rated. Or maybe just old school. Bitter baby. I get DIPA’s less bitter.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tekstr1der,4,"I revisit this one periodically, because at one time it was in my top 10 IPAs and I get nostalgic about that. Not sure if the recipe has changed over time, maybe it's just not been as fresh, I don't know... but I can only say it's a little better than okay in today's IPA world.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZebulonXZogg,4.02,"Pours a clear gold, big frothy white head, ridiculous amount of lacing. Citrus, and tropical fruits. Medium bodied, excellent carbonation. This is solid!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jkh15,3.82,Pretty solid but a touch too bitter for my liking.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hankp59,4.06,Pine cone resin in a glass. A nice golden color with a rich head. The malt is there. The hops are solid but one dimensional. If you like bitter the sides of your tongue will hold that bitterness for a while. I prefer grapefruit to pine so not my cup of tea but we’ll made and enjoyable for the style.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Seejae,3.85,"Pours a clean rusty orange. Not too much on the nose, a bit of pine and some malty sweetness. Upon the tongue, a definite old school IPA. The malts are at play here. They mince nicely with the malts and that’s probably the idea. Personally, I prefer the hops to win out. The feel is very clean, too clean for me. I get this more of a macro appeal. It definitely accomplishes that. No complaints, but not special.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BigGinge,4.28,"Appearance: Clear light copper color, rocky bone white head. Spotty lacing. Rocket ship carbonation.  Smell: Dank, pineapple, orange, lemon candy.  Taste: Bitter. Refreshing. Bone dry. Citrus fruits, aspirin-like bitterness. Pine needles come to mind. I'm trying to remember if I chewed on some when I was a kid. I'm gonna say pine needles. Malt is almost toasty, not sweet at all. Nice balance.  Feel: Perfect for an IPA. Just shy of medium bodied, dry and well carbonated.  Overall: Very good beer. My neckbeard should come in nicely after drinking this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Peach63,4.25,"Light amber with a 1/2"" white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing.  Aroma is floral, piney, grapefruit, grass.  Taste is pine, grapefruit zest, orange, resinous.  Medium body, moderate carbonation. dry, resinous finish.  Stone knows how to do IPA's. Excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,eatsluggs,4.57,"Not for loosers. A beer for late nights, just before enjoying a not so good food. At least the beer was worth the wait.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,morrisseywilde,4.67,"Folks, simply put, if you are a hophead, this is what you want. It may not be the cool new and exciting thing on the block, but it is a classic for a reason - the Led Zeppelin IV of IPA’s. I’m a little tired of all these 16 ounce 4 packs of hipster IPA’s with their arty packaging that are usually pretty meh. All sizzle with little steak. I am also way tired of hazy IPA’s. I am West Coast all the way, and this one right here is just perfect: lemony, bitter, clean, refreshing, chewy, and all the hops you could ever want - hops that stay with you for awhile after each sip. It’s not expensive, it’s easy to find, and it is the prototype of what a WC IPA should be. Those young bucks with their 4 packs need to recognize. This is the real deal Holyfield.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,soxfanben,4.73,"It gets better the more I drink, and isn’t that the sign of a great beer? It’s very hoppy. Hoppy. Hoppy is a weird weird. Say it like 50 times in a row and you will start to question whether or not it is even a real word. Hoppy. The only reason I know it’s still a weird is Siri says it’s a word. I never met my grandfather. No, the other one. Pairs well with broken dreams and the frustration that comes with realizing that the perception of any progress is quickly dissolved into the endless sea of society and reality and life. A beer review is not the correct place for a cry for help, they said.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HardCider,4.02,"This beer poured a clear, golden amber color with a significant white head. It is quite effervescent and has good head retention with nice lacing. The most notable aromas are fresh hops and pine. The taste is quite bitter and dry. As with the aroma, the most prevalent tastes are hops and pine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,laketang,4.37,Crystal clear copper and good head and retention. Very nice lacing. Floral notes to the nose. Bitter pine and some malt balance. Outstanding bitterness to the palate. What a classic west coast style here!.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BILLyATX,4.79,Good taste...smell seemed off.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HoppyMick,3.41,A little less wow factor for me. Nice balanced IPA but slightly lacking in flavour profiles that I am accustomed too. Still a lovely beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Grubetube01,4.63,Medium bitterness that is well balanced against a pine and grapefruit flavor.  I’m not normally a huge fan of IPAs but this one hits the mark and stands out. I’ll certainly be returning to this one again.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Alieniloquium,3.53,"On tap at Yard House. Clear golden. Smells of pine hops and grapefruit. Tastes of grapefruit pith, pine, immediately bitter. Light caramel sweetness. Medium body. Good without being exciting, but that's why it's a classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dan2213,4.5,"Not much has to be said about this beer. An absolute classic. The perfect combination of pine and citrus with a bitter finish to round it out. Perfect example of what I consider a “West Coast” IPA. Out of the can or poured in a glass, always reliable and steady.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OK_Denise,4.02,"I am not a huge IPA fan so take that into consideration when you read this. This is a pretty good representative of the style, as far as I can tell with my wimpy taste buds. You can definitely taste the hops but it is not ""copper penny in your mouth"" level of bitterness though. It does finish nicely, I have to say. It looks fine and everything else is above average so I would recommend it to those who enjoy IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Junior,4.28,I'm guessing this is what people are referring to when they are talking about West Coast IPA's.  Tropical fruit aroma and flavor up front with nice bitterness.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Shiredave,4.2,"Upside down printed 19.2oz can dated 02-04-21 best by 06-04-21. $3.29 at the corner gas station. With deals like this it makes me question the wisdom in paying $7-9 for a 16oz pint at a bar. This couldn't look much better. Bright, clear golden amber with a tall, sticky white head draping lace all around. Small, lazy bubbles rise through the beautifully clear beer. Mashed grain aromas mix with piney hop in a classic left coast IPA kinda way. Faint floral notes peak through along with a hint of honey on wet hay. Not as pungent and hoppy as when this was a smaller brewery yet still unmistakably Stone. Good balance in the nose leads to an overall balanced flavor profile. Hop bitterness and character take charge but the malt sweetness is ever present. Great medium bodied mouth feel with a satisfying and lingering hop bite. This big batch, ultra filtered mass market edition is not as impressive as it was in 2002 but still a winner and a classic IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Sigmund,4.16,"12 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.9%. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate white head. Lovely hoppy aroma, notes of citrus and tropical fruits. The zesty and fruity flavour is distinctly hoppy from start to finish, on a sufficient malty background. Ends in a grapefruity bitterness, but it is not overdone. Long bitter aftertaste. More to my liking than the Arrogant Bastard. Good stuff!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bilch,4.58,"19.3 oz can enjoy by 02/25/21. poured into a 16 oz mason jar.  look: clear, orange honey golden amber, 2 inch retentive head with intricate lacing.  smell: light citrus pine, slight hops and bread.  Taste: the resinous piney citrus hops, combine with the malt and swim well together. slight sweetness, but the bitterness of the hops lingers a bit longer than any maltiness. nicely balanced. alcohol disguised well.  feel: medium low carbonation. full bodied (slight chewy i guess)  overall: A beautiful example of a balanced, not a juice bomb, west coast IPA. if you are worthy or not, it’s recommended to try. I personally will have it in my rotation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Olsonhead,4.85,"This beer is one of my favorites. Outstanding from pour to finish. Perfect head. Smooth finish. Year-round beer. Great for winter, not too heavy for summer (in California).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BNSlums,3.63,"L: Light brown to amber, quite cloudy. Darker ale color with a tall and tight bright white head.  S: Malty with hints of lemon, a pine forest backdrop. Rather dry yet appealing.  T: Surprising orange kick. Highly bitter but balanced by a malt finish. Citrusy throughout.  F: Medium to heavy mouthfeel that lingers at 6.9abv. One pint would be a load, somewhat oily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RedBalloon,4.5,"12 oz bottle dated 10/8/20 poured into a Teku on 12/16/20.  Pours a 2"" creamy white head. Light amber, golden color. Nice sticky lacing.  Smells like pine needles with some dank, grassy, and citrus notes. Slight biscuity malt flavor.  A strong pine flavor up front gives way to bitterness in the finish. Nicely balanced hop and malt flavors.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel. Astringent and well-carbonated. Some oily, resinous stickiness.  Very delicious, well-balanced beer. The hop-heavy pine upfront is nicely balanced with malt flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IBU_Hunter,3.93,"Decent IPA at reasonable price, but harshly bitter for no reason. If you dislike the hoppy aftertaste, please not buy this. Better Alternatives: Racer 5 IPA, Firestone Union Jack, Russian River Mind Circus, Bell’s Two Hearted Ale. *Looks: good 1 finger head, golden/light amber, semi-clear *Aroma: mild citrus, piny, hoppy, slight lemon *Taste: Well balanced alcohol with significant hoppy aftertaste. I wish there was more maltiness as opposed astringent bitterness, which is a turn off for me for single IPA. The balance is missing. *Final Verdict*: solid, good, well-crafted IPA but not the best. Harshly bitter, unnecessarily. They need to make this similar to the a single IPA version of Stone Enjoy By! That would make it better towards perfection.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MaxHops,4.61,"The quintessential west coast/San Diego IPA. Defining the dry (for an ale) citrus/pine hop attack with oh-so light subtle malt making the perfect balance. 6.9% abv keeps it out of the heady range and if not exactly sessionable, much more so then ales only 1/2% to 1% higher can be. Reall y the standard by which I judge all west coast IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,frankdatank1337,4,The original craft West Coast IPA. if you want to taste where it all started drink this.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LoganFarinhas,4.89,"C: Golden, clear with a little haziness, excellent tight head that comes down to a cap. long lasting lacing that develops on each sip, and surprisingly not much carbonation (medium to slow rising bubbles) I was expecting more based off of the head.  S: Piney, resiny, citrus, slightly fruity, very hoppy smell, with a slight biscuit smell, smell increases significantly as the beer is getting warmer  T: Pretty bitter hoppiness with the hop and fruity citrus character upfront, followed by an increasingly malty, bready, piney flavor. Very accurate for an American IPA, 6.9%ABV and very unnoticeable. Really good for it's style. The Esters are strong in this beer.  F: Light, not much effervescence, yet not creamy, very balanced beer, with a soft feel not much sticking/ coating of the mouth.  Overall: This beer was Canned on 11/04/2020 and was 19.2fl oz., 6.9% ABV, 51ºF. This beer is very good it represents it's style very well and there is really nothing to complain about. I picked up a self-serve can for around $3 or something, the flavor is amazing, it is fresh, the smell and alcohol content is great and not overwhelming for being around 7%. Very great beer, I give it a 98.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PathofChaos,4.78,"Appearance: Pellucid, pollen gold under a slim head of fuzzy, whipped cream white. Low retention, stringy lacing.  Bouquet: Mild Citra hops followed by fresh bread spliced with a passing thought of lemon rind. There’s a teensy tang of pine hiding in there and occasionally, a sprightly honeysuckle flits by like a hummingbird. Unlike most IPAs, the fragrance gains potency with time.  Feel: Smooth and clean as marble with a nip of crisp carbonation in the linger.  Taste: Like biting into a juicy wedge of hoppy grapefruit. A wave of pungent, earthy pine flows over it; its advance slowed by caramel malt sweetness that abruptly ends, washing you up on a sunny, dry shoreline... still soaked in all the pine and grapefruit that tumbled you here. As you air off, mango, orange, and honeysuckle begin to chime in.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,barneyrubble,3.71,"Poured from can to tulip glass a big 3F head of soft beige foam forms. Nice loose lace from the high point is visible as it settles slowly to a 2F head. Color is gold with about 90% transparency.  My nose detects faint pine and citrus hop, a touch of malt and not much else.  On the palate a soft interesting fruit note sits atop the light malt. The malt is moderated by the slightly bitter hops midway to the finish. Notes of subdued orange and grapefruit sneak through the hops which are pine and grapefruit pith in flavor.  Mouthfeel is lighter in body than I expected. Light carbonation adds some tang to the slight citrus notes. The finish is bitter and slightly thick from the light astringency.  This beer drinks lighter than the taste would infer. It has a good balance of light malt with aggressive bitterness that makes it appealing. It has more pine sharpness than Odell IPA but both are growing on me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Limazulu,4.56,"A-deep orange, subtle haze, minimal head S-Grapefruit and pine T-Grapefruit and pine. Appropriately bitter. M- Medium/full body for the style, Average carbonation. Pretty darn smooth. Clean dry finish O-winner winner WCIPA dinner. Close to Sculpin in taste and mouth, just not as refined",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,harrypowers,4.15,Poured from a 12 oz bottle a translucent orange with a small head.  Had a pine aroma. Malt and hops taste. Some fruit notes. Dry finish.  Light body and carbonation.  Nicely made west coast IPA,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,entheos,3.92,"This is an exceptional beer. It is a very flavorful west coast IPA that is fully hopped and delicious. An underlying roast brings out the grain and hop. The feel is a bit harsh, but worth the drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MNAle,3.92,"The 6-pack was packaged on 6/3/20, so just over 9 weeks old at the time of this review (on 8/8/20).  Aroma is orange - almost sweet, hints of piney notes accompanying. A light toasty aroma underneath.  Orange-amber color, with a chill haze, ample rising bubbles to a creamy off-white head with very good retention. Nice-looking disconnected lacing. The chill haze eventually dissipates to a clear amber color.  Taste has the citrus rind (orange) biting up front, backed by some floral and orange juice flavors. The floral appears mostly as aroma that accompanies each swish in the mouth. There is sufficient malt presence, toasty bread, to provide the needed balance, but clearly the hops are the name of the game with this beer. The beer is not bitter for the first sip or two, but the bitterness builds with each successive drink to become a quite bitter beer. The aftertaste lingers for a long while and is intensely bitter.  The beer has substantial body for the style.  Overall, a very good IPA, and deserving of its iconic status in the West Coast substyle. To my palate, the bitterness is most evident in the lingering aftertaste than in the flavor of each sip itself. The bitter aftertaste comes to dominate everything before you are finished.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IPAs_for_days_13,4.49,"This beer pours a beautiful cloudy yellow with a creamy white two finger head. Smells heavily of pine, earth, floral notes & hops. The taste follows the nose, very heavy on the hops, but ends with a perfect malt sweetness that makes you appreciate the bitter even more. This beer is so crisp & delivers a clean IPA taste. It goes down exceptionally smooth with its medium-bodied carbonation. This is by far in my opinion one of the best IPA's out there, it's not to heavy, but it's definitely full of flavor & a proper ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,imnodoctorbut,4.42,"popped a can to celebrate the 23rd birthday of the O.G. that launched it all. strong, pungent earthy pine and grapefruit hop up front and center. caramel malt sweetness stops to wave hello before surfing on by and leaving you on the beach with a clean dry finish soaked in grapefruit and pine again.  gnarly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FBarber,3.89,"I am no big fan of Stone's but I have to admit, this is a very nice IPA.  Pours a crystal clear brilliant golden color. Nice 3 or 4 finger head settles in then quickly dissolves leaving just a mound ring of foam along the outside of the beer. Not a ton of lacing is left behind.  Aroma has bright notes of grapefruit, pine, dried grass, and a bit of sweet light malt.  Taste follows the nose with notes of pine, pine needles and grapefruit, with again, a bit of that malt peeping through. So far this has been the ""maltiest"" of the beers I've tried over the last day and a half, but lets be honest, it is by no means a ""malty"" IPA. Pronounced bitterness tarts on the back end and lingers into the finish.  Feel is light to medium bodied, pretty dry throughout producing a coating sensation in the mouth.  Overall its a really nice IPA and a worthy example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Amendm,4.27,"An easy pour yields two fingers of eggshell white, creamy and soapy foam that lasts and turns lumpy. Clear orange-straw color, yellow gold in bright light. Stick sagging arches of lacing.  Piney hops greats the nose with grapefruit and toast, pale malt and residual yeast in the background. Alcohol is noticeable from a deep inhale.  Semi-dry with high bitterness. Salty and spicy piney bitterness dominates the taste. The grapefruit is now a light general citrus taste, almost sour adding zero sweetness. There is a sturdy malt backbone that keeps the dryness in check. The finish is lengthened by the bitterness, the malt and citrus drop off. The aftertaste lingers on, hoppy and bitter.  Medium-light bodied, busy abundant carbonation. It would be smooth if not for the bitterness. The alcohol is warming yet it does not get to big as the Beer warms. Not quite session-able but by no means a sipper. West Coast all the way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bluerabbitbell,3.65,"Leah and I are wondering if this comes from an old keg. Salty and lemon up front. Dry finish. Average IPA to us. Had at Annie Bailey's Irish Pub in Lancaster, PA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hk117,3.36,330ml can: Very hoppy and bitter flavour with a dry finish. You can almost taste the alcohol in a not so pleasant way imo and just a bit too heavy (almost harsh) for my taste.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dapatriot1,1.88,let be totally honest ..I am not a fan of IPAs but wanted to give this one a try. I must say it was very hard to finish...i had to force it down. I hate giving poor ratings and to be fair if i was an IPA fan this might have been a great beer. I will stick to Stone lagers,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,BubbleBobble,4.42,"From gas station 19.2 oz can, about 3 months after canning date.  L: Sunset orange, fluffy thick head, sticky lacing that clings throughout the drink. S: Pine, citrus , sticky hops. T: Classic West Coast flavor, biting bitterness balanced by sweet malt; stone fruits, some light candy sweetness. F: Thick mouthfeel, but enough carb to dart through it. O: So refreshing after an onslaught of NEIPA candy and hop burn.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,AthltSpirit,4.95,"Best tasting beer I’ve ever had. The aftertaste is honestly the best part. Smooth and creamy and leaves you wanting more. A near perfect blend of hops, bitterness and malt. Couldn’t ask for anything more out a beer",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NateGamer,4.35,"IPA favorite you are at the grocery store.. Foamy moist head, sticks on frozen mug wall...I drink from a frozen mug okay, even if it's prefered only for Lagers. It's got a punch of hops but with a cool sweet butterscotch pudding after taste from the Jello pudding pop commercials. Can't even taste the 6.9 percent, it it hidden by the great taste and unique flavors from this great American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,milkshakebeersucks,4.25,Medium gold color with a large head and good lacing. Hoppy pine aroma with accents of citrus.

147,88,just1cho,3.78,"*Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Teku glass at 45F*  I've tried a lot of IPAs before, but when I drink this one, the word 'average' comes to mind. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  This poured a slightly hazy copper look. Has a nice diversity of rocky and micro bubbles with a white half finger thick head with a medium retention.  Nosing the glass, this had a decent amount of hop aroma. The hop presence here wasn't massive, but it wasn't necessarily subdued either. It was about 70/30 in terms of hops and malt presence respectively. I wasn't overwhelmed with hop aroma, but it wasn't necessarily balanced either. The aromas covered a good range of citrus notes such as oranges, grapefruit, a little bit of lemon with notes of pine and tropical notes like mangoes.  Tasting the beer, I felt there was more of a balance in the taste between the hops and the malt. Upfront I can taste a medium grapefruit bitterness, then it develops in the middle to a more malty sweetness. Then the pine and the other earthy tones of the hops shine in the end with a mild amount of an alcoholic taste, leaving a lingering bitterness in the end.  The feel of this was a mellow medium body with a medium amount of carbonation. Not much to say here, other than it was pretty normal/average.  Overall, this was a decent IPA that's pretty good for its ubiquity. Definitely not bad by any means, but it doesn't necessarily stand out by any means. Still, I would have no problem drinking this any day of the week.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hophead723,4.33,"On tap and paired with banana pepper and steak pizza. Delicious!!  Look: Honey amber color with steady carbonation. Hazed from the incredible hopping. Off white, almost light khaki-colored head with excellent retention. A plump, creamy cap of foam lingers until the end of the glass.  Smell: Rich with tropical and citrus fruits including pineapple, mango, clementine, pine, orange, honey, and caramel from the malts. The delicious and fruity aroma that welcomes the senses.  Taste/Feel: A silky smooth and clean mouthfeel carries waves of tropical pineapple, pine, orange peel, caramel, and honeysuckle malts that provide impeccable balance alongside the delicious fruity hops.  Overall: This beer is so balanced and delicious. Very smooth and drinkable. Excellent work Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,timon,3.92,"Not a bad beer. I hoped for a bit more. Taste is a bit like lemon zest and orange in a dark bread. Good balance of bitter and dark, but nothing too groundbreaking or delicious. Mouthfeel is a bit light for me, but not bad. I like a thicker mouthfeel, but if you like thinner mouthfeel or medium this is great for you. The smell is meh. Very light and not too interesting. Look is a nice copper with sparkling lacing and medium head. Overall, it's drinkable and OK for $10 a sixer. There are deals I like better and better IPAs for sure, imho.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jzeilinger,4.15,"A - Nice bright, medium to dark gold color, perfect clarity, creamy white lacing on top with great head retention, carbonation is light and steady.  S - Light caramel malt with a piney, citrus presence on the nose.  T - Strong caramel malt backbone up front until midway through when the pine and citrus roll in like a freight train and continues to roll even far past the sip down the 'ol pie hole. Long lingering pine bite with some citrus washes away and malt sweetness that was experienced up front. On the very, very back side some of that malt tries to resurface but with little success.  M - Big and full and the tongue with light carbonated pricklies and finishes dry on the back of the tongue.  O - A classic that never gets old.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,caligman,4.12,"I consider Stone to be the canonical West Coast IPA. While others have played with the formula, I rely on Stone's hoppy bite to reset my palate. This beer pours into a coppery haze and smell, with no attempt to negotiate with me. This means that the pine and citrus notes are understated in comparison to today's experiments. The hops leave a lasting impression.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBeerMaster1,3.89,"Floral, citrus, clean and crisp. I don't think this wows me with anything, but certainly has a different take on west coast ipas.

147,88,HazyNewEnglandDays,3.55,I think this was my the first IPA I tried. I remember skating my boy's half pipe then stealing one these from his dad's mini fridge. They have a complex and delicious flavor with a strong bitterness. Definitely an acquired taste but this is a prime example of a west coast style IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,1009,4.1,"Poured from the tap at the office on a lovely Friday afternoon.... holds a beautiful color, solid taste with good bite and a crisp finish. Well balanced, mass produced IPA. On Par with Harpoon, not quite up to the standards of the true craft beers. Would order again if it’s on tap somewhere and I’m looking for something with horsepower. Not going out of my way to buy it, though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Can't really smell much, a slight citrus odor. Taste is another story, this one will really peal your wig back. Bright tropical fruits, tons of hops and fairly bitter.

The aroma was inviting to my nose. The taste....very excellent taste of what I really love in an IPA. It left me wanting more after each swig. Not trying to sound like a connoisseur, but You do not need to be one to enjoy a few pints of this brew. Good job Stone. I have a new favorite.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jwp777,3.78,"Poured from the bottle, bottle dated 10/19/19, tasted 12/28/19.  Pours a dark orange/light amber color. Head fades quickly but does retain a little bit. Lacing is pretty good.  In the aroma, pine, orange peel, and grapefruit jump out immediately. That is all I can make out since my sense of smell is weak and the aroma is not super powerful.  Taste - LOTS of pine in this one. I expected some piney, hoppy bitterness, but it was a bit overpowering for my taste. Aftertaste lingers for a while, and the malt shows up for me in the finish.  Feel - very crisp and refreshing. If this was a beer I loved, I could probably session it pretty well.  Overall - I generally prefer New England or Imperial IPAs over West Coast. That said, this one was decently enjoyable and easy on the wallet. If West Coast your thing, I am sure you will like this. Even if it’s not your thing, it’s worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,BloodSoakedAleMug,4.03,"From a variety pack from costco. Drank from the bottle because I felt like it, apologies for no comments on the look, but plenty of other reviewers here have provided that information. I have had this beer so many times in the past I do know what it pours like however.  I have to say, as soon as I pop'd the top, the aroma jumped out at me. It wasn't wildly complex or so pungent you could smell it from across the room or anything, but you could definitely smell it waft through the air initially.  Aroma: Even from the bottle the aroma is better than a lot of other beers of the style poured into a glass. Pine sap, rolled oats, caramel malt, toasted almond, mild wintergreen, slightly spicy grapefruit peel and tangy, savory orange.  Taste: Upfront just the slightest amount of prickly heat from the alcohol bill. Goes bitter with gentle waxy tangerine peel and dry grapefruit rind. Transitions beautifully, following the nose, into flavors of malty toasted almond and granola with honey - before fading out into orange marmalade and bitter spruce.  Feel: For the style, light body with moderate carbonation. Very crushable and sessionable, even at 6.9% abv.  Overall: This is probably one of the most well rounded, modestly priced, readily available and iconic american IPAs out there. An excellent introduction to the style for newbies, while offering a solid amount of bitterness and drinkability for veterans alike. Stone has perfected this beer to the letter, and I always find myself coming back to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell is pretty bright and zesty hops, grapefruit/lemon/pineapple with some pine and floral notes. Not picking up any malt flavors other than a light sweetness, which fades as the finish becomes dry with a lingering resinous biterness.  I probably would've rated this beer a 5 when I first tried it out of bombers back in 2006. Not sure how much of it to attribute to their altered dry hopping, or rather a change in my palate? But while familiar, it seems to have a wider range of hop flavors (more floral, earthy) than it once did, a slightly less bright and perfumy nose, and less malt character in the flavor.

Its as though the different flavor notes are in a boxing match fighting for your approval. Boy do they fight hard. Nice foamy and dense 2 finger head is like the icing on the cake. The color of the beer is almost a facade that lures the bud light drinker into trying more complex beer. And it is by far the least ""craft beer""-esque charactaristic about it.

Aroma: Moderate aromas of grapefruit & orange citrus, pine, and nectarine, with a touch of tropical melon. Tons of nectarine, pineapple, mango, stonefruit, & orange citrus. Hints of herbs. Yes, I suppose some Fruity Pebbles. (4.25)  Taste: Much more pine bitterness on the taste. Bitter pine forest for days. Some orange, nectarine, grapefruit, and pineapple as well. Lots of citrus. Much more than the tropical nose. A prominant dry and bitter peach soap and suds. Not unlike a Two-Hearted Ale. Such a great pine flavor. Followed by tons of bitterness.

Less bitterness and astringency. 10/11/20: Pours a lighter color. More grapefruit citrus and less resinous pine soap.  Compared w/ Surly's Yummi Bear West Coast IPA: This one has a slightly darker color. More deep citrus, pine, melon on the aroma than airy pine and citrus. Flavor is darker and more stonefruit. More peach suds. Less lemon and pine. This one was flat, but I would say flatter and less bitterness and carbonation.  Compared w/ Bent Paddle Golden IPA: Similar in appearance. Similar pine upfront, but turns dryer and even slightly more bitter. More stonefruit. Less sunburst. Identical malt body. Overall, slightly more bitter and dry. Very similar.  Compared w/ Bells' Two Hearted 3/7/20: (skunked and old Stone) Lighter orange color. Stronger aromas of grapefruit citrus and pine. Less caramel. More herbal (maybe b/c it's oxidized). More pine bitterness and less caramel sweet.  Compared to Elysian Space Dust IPA 5/8/20: Pours a slightly darker color with a stronger head. Milder aromas. More nectar, resin, and bitterness. Less citrus flavor and floral/pine. More caramel and sweet.  Revisit to Yummi Bear IPA 7/28/20: Pours a slightly darker color. Stronger grapefruit, nectar, and pine. Less citrus, herbs, and berry/melon. More soapy pine bitterness.  Compared to Sculpin 1/17/21: Pours a slightly lighter color. Much milder aromas. More pine and bittering. Less fruit/strawberry/peach. Winner: Sculpin  Compared to Sierra Nevada's Dankful IPA 3/5/21: A lighter color. Milder aromas. Less flavor. Possibly more grapefruit, but this must be an old beer because there is nothing here.  to Stone Deliciousness 1/4/22: Pours similar, slightly lighter. Milder aromas. More grapefruit and pine.

Less resinous grapefruit and nectarine. Dryer, less sweet, and more bitter.  Overall: This is the gold-standard for west-coast IPA all the way. Terrorizing Bitterness. Citrus, pine, with less stonefruit. Orange, pineapple, grapefruit citrus and pine.. Finishes dry and bitter and west-coast as I expect. it's a palate cleanser for sure.

Anyway, The Beer inside is all that counts. I noticed this brew has a very nice head and lacing that seems to last forever. The Smell really sets me off and tells me its gonna be a good one. The nose on this Beer is Bright and fruity. You get a lot of citrus notes with dankness and maybe some pine. Now for the most important, The taste. Glad to say this IPA is Damn Delicious. Upfront a burst of sweetness along with Pine apple and citrus notes. There is that Classic west coast Pine needle dankness going on followed by a backbone of European pale Malt character. As it finishes, A slow swell of hop bitterness arises. Like any good West Coast IPA. The finish is clean and dry with a tad of lip smacking stickiness. The beer falls short a little bit for me in the feel and body. Not as Creamy mouth feel as some other West Coast IPAs. A touch of wateriness and looseness. Carbonation is low, Very drinkable.

Aromas of raw, deep pine, evergreen, and a subtle but immovable foundation of flaky crisp malt; slight dank earth hangs in the background along with some tropical undertones; forest personified in a beer.  Taste profile is evergreen and pine needles, with grapefruit zest coming in to even out the advancing, raw earthiness of it all; bits of herbal weediness follow in tow; bitter hops and a building malt punch mature with the profile as a whole.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a moderate, dry carbonation; vaguely bitter; coats the palate tactfully with a smooth, herbaceous grit, while simultaneously, a juicy pop grows throughout and culminates near the finish.  Stiff but deceptively approachable paragon of old-school hops.

Unfortunately there seems to be a bit of a metallic taste - imparted by the can perhaps? Mouthfeel is light in comparison to similar IPAs.

147,88,Mister_Faucher,3.71,Pretty standard middle of the road pine-centric IPA. Glad I got my 6 pack on sale at the local Safeway for 8 bucks and some change. There are better west coast IPAs available now since they started brewing this (Even Stone's own Scorpion Bowl is better.),Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tripel_Threat,4,"Solid IPA. Poured from pounder into glass tumbler. Clear and light orange in color, with a few fingers of head. Leaves rings of streaky lacing. Lots of aggressive pine notes, but with a nice citrus kick in there to keep it from being one-note. Not too shabby",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,German-Helles,3.08,"The look is solid, a nice fluffy white head that sticks around, the beer pours....I would say a very light amber color with light carbonation. The smell is strong citrus and pines. The flavor is the same as the smell and dry from the hops. I have not acquired a taste for the IPA style beer yet. It is not bad, but it is also a style I do not crave. Bitter and dry",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dnelson0,3.69,This is definitely a good beginner IPA. It indicates what your personal taste wants from an IPA. More fruit or citrus flavor or more malt to balnce out the the hops. Beer looks good as it has lots of little carbonation bubbles. Head dissapates after short time. Smell was unexpectedly not potent with some citris and pine. Taste follows suit with slight initial sweetness quickly followed by moderate pine bitterness. Very dry. I need something in one direction or the other. Probably not fair to compare to Sculpin /Fresh Squeezed or Union Jack/Two Hearted. Standard IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Troy-Hawaii,3.65,"Part of a variety 12-pack $18.99 Target Citrus smells Clear golden amber tinged color Medium mouthfeel Medium carbonation Citrus flavors, bitter aftertaste Overall a typical IPA. Nothing outstanding. Not worth the premium price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Helluvaz,3.39,"Not too much to say. This IPA is just like standard IPA. The hop scent is a bit more perky than some other IPA's, but this is just a normal IPA on the market. Enjoyable, but kinda normal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Mindcrime1000,4.04,"Poured from a single-serve into a pub glass.  Pours a classic amber-gold with a fine two-finger head and good lacing. Just a hint of haze.  The aromas are subdued, but excellent. Grapefruit citrus and oily pine resin hops in equal measures meld with just a hint of crackery malt--not sweetness, but just enough maltiness to balance.  The flavor is skewed hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Floral hops hit the beginning of the sip, with citrus (grapefruit flesh and pith) rounding out the middle palate, and oily pine hops and a touch of booze at the finish. The malts present on the nose are, again, just barely noticeable here.  The mouthfeel is excellent. Medium-bodied with a fine crisp finish.  I don't remember the last time I had one of these, but it would good to revisit an old-timer. There are certainly better and more creative offerings of the style now, but this is a solid rock.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBrewsky,3.89,"It has been so long since I have had this beer. One of the first IPAs I have ever had if I correctly recall. L: Pours dark straw yellow in color. Nearly perfectly transparent, as is the case with most of these OG WCIPAs. From a simple pour, a frothy 3 finger of head was formed that settled down to what amounts to about a fingers worth of the same, densely packed head. Heaps of lacing on the glass, a true pleasant site. It coats the glass and makes me ever more so enthused. S: Malt-forward, with healthy amounts of citrus and dankness. A smell that instantly harkens you back to the days of the OG WCIPAs. Dank and citrusy with a malt backbone. T: Very hoppy and bitter up front, the you get the cascade of sweetness from the malts on the finish. Citrus flavor is present throughout, primarily consisting of lemon and grapefruit. Aftertaste is pine with dank resinous flavor and finally sweet malt at the finish. Sweeter than I remember, maybe due to bottle age. F: Light in body, more medium in weight. Carbonation is moderate for the style. Smooth and easy to drink. O: It still holds up well and is fun to revisit classics like this. Very drinkable at 6.9abv. Like I said, it is sweeter than I remember, but still tastes great on this rainy day. I am very glad to have re-tried. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Marraybay,4,"Look: Clear light amber; 1 finger of dissipating white foam on top; lacey.  Smell: earthy, pine, pineapple / mango  Taste: Opens with sweet citrus / tropical fruit that transitions to a lingering grapefruit pith at the close.  Feel: smooth; silky; welcoming  Overall: A classic IPA with all the components of the style very nicely represented; unassuming and highly drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Since I am such a critic of recent Stone decisions, well , at least the one to retire another icon the Russian Imperial Stout I will give credit when it's due ... Smooth as silk classic WestCoast style regular IPA with fruity floral flavors, some pine, and a nice grapefruit bite.

147,88,MrOH,4.26,"Pours clear gold, thin white head. not much in the way of retention or lace. Aromas of citrus, pineapple, pine, and various and sundry tropical. Little be of sweet malt underneath. Full flavored. Reflects aroma. Clean. Good brisk bitterness Light but satisfying. Medium-light body. Spot on carbonation A great go-to IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DavidD3,3.96,"A pretty delicious beer, but one I feel like I've had before. Maybe other IPAs I've had are just imitations of this really popular (and rightfully so) beer, or I'm just too late to the IPA game to appreciate this classic before its influence was spread. Either way, very hop forward, fruity, and piney with a really nice bitter backend. Definitely a worthwhile buy, but not something I think I'll come back to often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JonnoWillsteed,2.02,"L- Mid gold, very slight haze, pours with thin white head that swiftly goes to lacing. S- Lychee and some melon. T- Woah, very dry, a dab of perfumed fruits, anything else is to me overwhelmed by the Feel. F- Very hoppy-dry and has a long finish of deep sourness which I find tongue-curling. O- This is what I call a hop-bomb, it focuses almost entirely of a very high hop-profile which I find overshadows all else. Bought in London/UK, not one for me.

147,88,Lucular,4.21,"My 285th IPA, finally(!) getting around to drinking the IPA with the 4th-most ratings on BA. This may be brewed in Richmond but it's basically the perfect West Coast IPA - a nice hoppy, piney, citrusy bite well-balanced with a caramel malt backbone (with very little sweetness). This classic beats the pants off the vast majority of new-school IPAs (whether NE-style or not).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MoreBeer4me,3.75,"Its okay. Nothing I would be doing back flips over. Its just another decent IPA in a gigantic sea of IPA's. If you have some, drink it. If not, no big loss. Just drink another IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mothmanscott,4,"From notes 4/1/12: Pours a hazy burnt orange producing a 1.5 inch, long lasting beige head that leaves super lacing. Aroma is hop heaven with caramel malt and resinous tones.

147,88,Snowcrash000,4.15,"Pours a deep golden amber coloration with a large frothy head. Smells mainly of hoppy grapefruit and orange notes, with a hint of pine as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by hoppy grapefruit and orange rind notes, but with quite a resinous character, light caramel malt and strong pine as well. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and quite a bit of pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This is the quintessential West Coast IPA with its resinous character and notes of grapefruit, pine and caramel malt. Probably the best value-for-money IPA in Germany, if you can find it fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma: Sweet caramel malts, grapefruit, and pine. This one has that pleasent nastalgic old school IPA smell. Also, some assorted citrus fruits, specifically orange, which mingle in nicely.  Taste: Grapefruit and pine are larger on the taste than they were on the nose, and it has a massive bitterness which I absolutely adore. The malts are identifiable on the taste as well, but this is an ode to the bitter hop. Orange peel comes out as well. This beer, along with Delicious IPA and Tangerine Express, are why Stone is my go to fridge filler brewery, outstanding!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Harrison8,4.3,"Pours a clear dark yellow with two fingers of off-white foam that retains well. Aroma is pine, dank, and resin hops with biscuit malts behind. Hops are biting, but not aggressive. Flavor profile is resin, dank, pine, and orange hops with biscuit and bread malts behind. It's clean, and while the hops bite a little, they are wonderfully balanced and blended into the beer. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a soft, velvety texture that lends itself to joyful sip after sip. Overall, a splendid, balanced IPA that hits traditional West Coast IPA hop notes.

147,88,hoppity,3.92,"Nice yellow/gold color. I didn't get too much from the nose. Taste was on the bitter side and probably not for everyone.

Overall I like it and recommend anyone interested in IPAs to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ATL6245,3.52,"Appearance: Pours a clear, clean pale golden color. Fluffy white head with tiny compact bubbles with a moderate head retention. Aroma: Oranges and grapefruit dominate with strong pine notes. Slight grainy malt smell. Flavor & Aftertaste: Flavors of citrus (oranges, grapefruit, pepper) with very low malt sweetness. Aggressive bitter hops leave a lengthy, piney resin aftertaste. Mouth-feel: Highly astringent. Low carbonation on the palate, long bitter and very dry finish.  This is a challenging beer to review because people who love highly bitter IPA absolutely love this beer. In terms of West Coast IPA, this is one of the top 5 easily. But, looking at the broad category of American IPA, there are a number of them that are better. The aggressive bittering leaves one with a mouth-coating, piney resin aftertaste that lingers well past the finish. It's a very unbalanced beer. This is a beer with a narrow audience - those who love very bitter beers. So if you love highly bitter IPA's, go for it, this ones for you. If you prefer a more drinkable, balanced IPA, don't try Stone IPA. Go with a Harpoon IPA, Sweetwater IPA, or Creature Comforts Tropicalia.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Did this really kind of start the west coast IPA thing? And after all these years, is this really the first time I've tried this beer?? Who knows and who really cares. What is important is that this beer does deliver the sharp, poignant IPA bitterness that one would look for in an American IPA.

147,88,BGM,1.66,"Stone is having quality control, sanitation, and/or supply chain problems. The recent batches of IPA have been undrinkable. I lived in San Diego in the early 2000's - back in those days, the beers were a bit heavy-handed, but very well crafted.  I sent a note to the brewery after dumping 18 beers down the sink over a span of 3 months - no reply. This brewery has become too big for its britches, and quality is suffering. There are too many fantastic beers on the planet to bother with Stone.  To follow the terms of service:  Look: the IPA poured into glass with an appropriate amount of head and decent clarity... no complaints. Smell: A bit off, see below Taste: the flavor resembles a bucket of fermented mop water used to clean an institutional mess-hall. Notes of industrial solvent, mold, and cat urine. Feel: well - I did not manage to swallow a single sip in the three six packs I purchased. Dish soap would be an accurate portrayal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lacing is minimal with bits here and there around the glass.  The nose is tropical. You get lots of orange rind up front with just a touch of sweetness. The grains come through in the middle giving it some dryness. Finish is sweet and grainy with lingering bitterness.  Its quite balanced upfront between the bitter and the sweet. You get orange, pineapple, a bit a lemongrass and some grains. Ends sweet with a sharp lingering hops bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit oily.

On tap I feel like this grapefruit, citrusy taste tends to dominate, but out of the bottle the deeper pine notes and sweet bready malts are more noticeable on the back end. I prefer the former, though I wonder how much of that has to do with freshness (no date printed on this 6-pack).  Smooth, crisp, and slightly dry finish. A reliable classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Profundobaso,4.38,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. Pale yellow in color, one finger head with lacing and decent carbonation. Smell - floral, citrus, pine, heavy hoppiness. A myriad of flavors, though subtle, are detectable. Some malts in the background as well. Taste - Strong, strong hoppy flavor with a malty backbone. A blend of floral and citrus hoppy flavor balanced out by a nice malt flavor in the finish. Clean and incredibly refreshing. Feel - medium bodied, perhaps a bit more. medium high carbonation with a kick in booze as well at near 7%. Overall - Stone IPA is one of archetypal examples of a west-coat style IPA. Catered to a smaller audience when the brew was first made, it is very hoppy compared to other similar beers on the market and some might find it a bit too overwhelming.

There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, and earthy grains and malts. This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The look and smell are really inviting. Now for the taste, it is Bold with hop bitterness at first. Then you pick up a smoothness of earthy grains and malts at the end. There is alot going on in Stone IPA. If you are not a fan of hops, this is not the brew for you. The body of Stone IPA, is a medium to heavy. But not to heavy. There is a super nice balance to this brew, there is nothing overpowering about this American. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing.

Smells strongly of hope, not as much as a double but more than many IPA, piney resinous and a touch of citrus. Very well balanced, just a touch of biscuit malt flavor hiding behind the hops.

The taste is not nearly as balanced, no real citrus hit, just loads and loads of bitterness that lasts forever, the furthest thing from dry or clean.

There is a slightly funky smell, which I like, without citrus or fruit – somewhat redolent of the farmyard, one more likely to be found in a saison.

The hops come through more in the taste but not dramatically.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Not the flavour I was expecting and the subdued flavour means this is very sessional which could be quite dangerous at 6.9%vol, well for me anyway.

147,88,doktorhops,4.18,"This beer represents something special: Stone IPA, launched 20 years ago (I was still in high school at that time, I feel old now) it soon became the zeitgeist brew that grew immensely in stature on a certain website launched by two passionate beer-drinking brothers... you know the one I’m talking about - that site. So I’m going in to this review with a certain amount of reverence that will hopefully not become the folly of hype by the end of this page. However that’s hardly likely to happen with Stone “Xocoveza-Vertical-Epic-W00tstout-Americano” Brewing, those legends of San Diego (which of course in German means a whale's vagina) who don’t seem to brew any bad beers, least none that I’ve encountered [yet!]. Anyway: My beer awaits.  Poured from a 355ml can into a nonic pint.  A: Hazy amber body, like the sun rising between misty hills at golden hour. With an off-white thatch-work half centimetre head that leaves a nice sticky lace on the side of the glass. This is a damn-near perfect looking IPA, one that Pale Ales hope to look like when they grow up. 9/10.  S: Aroma is a dynamite piney/caramel combo with a hint of dried apricot and citrus leading me further down the rabbit hole. Top-notch fragrance, quintessentially West Coast... hell this is the original West Coast, so of course the aroma matches the ambition of this brew. It’s got a touch of hop fade... would love to have this fresh (can date: 17/02/17 - that’s over 5 months old now). 8/10.  T: Big citrus bite upfront, full piney/earthy notes, broad caramel base, dried apricot hint leading towards an assertive, almost aggressive, bitter finish. It’s balls to the walls this beer! Rather than be overly malty as other brews I’ve noticed with hop fade this one appears to have fared a little better - it’s only a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste that ruins an otherwise impeccable West Coast IPA. 8/10.  M: Feel is good, it’s got a bit of (Johnny) Dep(p)th to it, medium bodied, and an almost German-like carbonation (i.e. not quite but almost creamy). 9/10.  D: I get this beer. It started a “Generation X” wave of brewing beers that were bitter, tasty, and all round a bit of a handful (or glassful if we’re going to be technical here). However I now look back upon these early West Coast IPAs as the age of beers that were challenging, and at times too much for me, and I look forward to the ever growing popularity of New England IPAs which strike a perfect balance between sweet/bitter - which is my favourite beer balance. Huzzah! 9/10.  Food match: Go for some spicy buffalo wings with this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gvickery,3.89,"Poured from a bomber into a cheap clear water glass. It has a slightly hazy gold/orange/copperish color. Smell of pine, citrus, with a slight sweet undertone.

147,88,Lone_Freighter,4.49,"Bottle to becher pint glass. The appearance was a glossy burnt yellow to golden bronze color with a sly transparency about it. Moderate carbonation rapidly rises to hit a finger's worth of white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Mild messy lace. The aroma had a nice blend of spicy to earthy hops up front playing with a sly semi-sweet cracker malt backbone. Ample amount of pine to citrus peel particles slide in for a nourishing quality. The flavor was a blend of the spicy earthiness to the pine and citrus bittersweetness, bold and up front and giving off the added persona of an eventful spicy earthy, piney and citrusy aftertaste. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good and non-distracting to hop harshness. ABV felt as projected by the brewer. Overall, if Greg Koch is reading this, I just want to say one thing to him - hey man, don't change to keep up with all of these newer flavors that feed into all of the people that just want to keep ""ticking"" new beers. The beer market might be changing, but still over 10,000 people that rated this on this site have the score equally out to above a 90 should tell you something and that something is this IPA will stand the test of time!

147,88,RandyCongdon,4.56,"When the current IPA/IBU fad eventually subsides, and so many craft brews with it, Stone IPA will be one of those left standing. It has just the right balance that typify a really good IPA, which is why it has been around for 20 years this year.  Look- A beautiful crystal clear amber brew with a thin white head. There is virtually no residue on the glass after a sip. It is simply clean.  Smell- Pineapple and citrus provide a powerful punch that immediately begs to to take a sip. It is very appetizing.  Taste- The pineapple/citrus is carried over in full. There is, of course, the hoppy bitterness associated with a typical IPA. It is slightly sweet, too. This prevents the bitterness from being cloying. So many current Hop Bombs forget this balance. Hot food should never sacrifice flavor for the sake of heat. The analogy can apply to the bitterness of IPAs, too. Stone is NOT a Hop Bomb.  Mouthfeel- The body is medium-light. The swallow om is crisp and clean, but there is a strong tingle on the lips and tongue from the hops and good amount of carbonation. This is one of this beer's coolest features.  Overall- The value of Balance cannot be overstated. If I were to choose an adjective that summarizes why this is such a great brew, it would be ""balanced"". As a beer clerk who is frequently asked for recommendations by my customers, this is the IPA I point to when asked for a good example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It feels to me that they put so much Citra into this that it became bitter. Both dry hopping and otherwise the aroma of Citra is dominant but at the same time leaves quite a bitter aftertaste. Could there be something, a bittering hop hiding behind the citrusy overtones very subtly? Stone is a master brewery, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the case. The beer tastes very smooth and the carbonation quite soft, makes you think for a minute that it is quite light in character but nothing could be futhet from the truth.

Bitter from the first glance, without pushing too far, due to balancing, sweeter malts. The hops are pretty fruity but foremost dry, bitter and in your face.

147,88,andrewh995,4.36,I've had a few stone IPAs but this one is my favorite. Lots of varying citrus such as orange and lemon along with incredibly balanced hop bitterness.

147,88,porters4life,4.07,"After walking past this beer for 3 years I finally decided to throw it into a mix a six and give it a try. I am not usually the biggest fan of IPA's, I'm more of a stout and porter guy, although I have been venturing more into the IPA world and starting to enjoy them. L: Stone IPA looks great, it pours a nice dark gold color with a bit of an amber tint to it and a head that fades pretty quick. There is decent lacing as you drink the beer. S: I could not get a whole lot of of the smell other than the hops maybe a little bit of citrus but that's about it. T: Very hoppy at least for me. I do not think that I would have liked this beer if I would have tried it 2-3 months ago but I am really trying to get into IPA's and I'm finding that I am starting to like them more and this hoppy beast was a pretty good brew for the style. F: I actually really liked the mouthfeel for this one. To me it was kind of thick for an IPA and I actually really liked it. Overall: A solid IPA that i would gladly drink again not my favorite but one of the better beers I have had in the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It's definitely as nice as other IPAs and stands a bit above your everyday IPA.  The smell is good. It has a nice and strong grapefruit note to it that has a nice pine running through it. The malt notes also come out fairly well as a sweet note with a bit of bread to it.  The taste is very good. It has a nice strong bitter grapefruit note mixed with a nice pine running through it to give a good bitter bite. The malt note is sweet and light with a bit of bready note to it. While it does not quite balance out the It's simple compared to other IPAs but still very good.  The feel is good. It's a medium bodied beer with a nice dry finish and carbonated bite that makes this beer a pleasure to drink.  Overall, a pretty good everyday IPA and a very good IPA overall.

This has everything I look for in an everyday IPA. Huge nose and flavour combined with a near perfect body and mouthfeel make this the first beer I reach for after a long day at work. ABV is a little high to make this truly sessionable but a couple of these blow the cobwebs away of an evening. I keep trying to make a point of grabbing some of Stone's ""GoTo"" IPA to cut back a bit on the booze but I just can't see past this bad boy. Love it, and I'm very much a stout/porter kind of BA.

The head is one finger thick, leaves lots of lacing but has still better than average retention, however, for this beer, I was expecting it to have more retention. S: The aroma is strangely sweet since I has hoping not to find anything sweet here. I guess there's some toffee in the back but I'm not sure of it. Yet, the aroma is very mild and you can't have any clues on the flavor coming from this. T: The taste is really bittersweet, has it has some sweetness coming specifically from a characteristic I can't seem to find and then connecting it to the bitterness of the hops. M: The body is medium to medium high. Carbonation is high. Bitterness is mild to strong. O: I've had better IPAs from Stone but this is remarkably good for 96' recipe.

Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a one inch, well retained head that left gorgeous lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is citrus, pine, sweet honey like note and some malts.

The Stone IPA isn't bad, it's OK and I guess a decent example of what it's trying to be but for me it just has a less full mouth feel some piney and has that bitter bite at the finish I don't really take pleasure in.

Always liked the old version with its different hops but sadly I have passed this up too often over the last few years for newer brasher IPA's offered by other breweries. Can't wait to get a keg of this for the house. What is the difference in taste? Had a 12-pack of the older version but still within date code to compare and I have to say the newer one brings on a slightly sweeter malt before the hops take over. Not my favorite smell for an IPA, but every other mark puts it one of the better ones in my book. Still 6.9%abv, still 77 ibu.

T: Delicate pine needles, biscuits and honey, grapefruit pith, orange juice, orange marmalade, with a bone dry finish and a lingering citrus bitterness that smacks of biting right into an orange peel.  F: Mouthfeel is medium, but feels full, slick, and almost creamy thanks to the hop oils and plentiful carbonation.

Golden dark straw beer with a generous, fairly thick, slightly off-white or yellowish head. Nice hoppy nose with resinous hops dominant, but some floral and citrusy notes as well. Taste, like nose, is balanced - a must with bitter beers, as far as I am concerned - and clearly there is some solid malt beneath the hops, even though this is a truly hoppy IPA.

147,88,J_T_Arlington,3.38,"Looks good. Classic gold.  Smells like bitter, rotten, and sweet.  Bitter beyond all get-out. Citrus and pine, not much more. Maybe something sweet, like a faint lavender... perhaps honey-dew, but it doesn't work with the other flavors. Something kind of tastes like aftershave in here. No doubt appealing to certain people, but not this people.  Feels nice. Not much foam in the mouth. Simple bitter aftertaste that sticks around like that annoying cousin you wish would leave already but you invited him over so you can't kick him out without being rude so you have to just let stay here and annoy you some more. Gets more tolerable towards the bottom though. the sweetness is becoming more prevalent and the bitterness becomes less biting.  All things considered, this beer definitely takes a special palate to enjoy--a fine, and refined palate perhaps, but not my palate. The thing is, I can tell this is a higher quality beer, but it's taste is not for me. I will not seek this beer out again, except on a great rare ocassion maybe, but it is worth a try for anyone who enjoys IPA.

147,88,Hallu,3.89,"This is the one for the European market, brewed in Germany. It's only 2 weeks old. Great fresh smell of hops, classic west coast with pine and citrus. Taste is maltier than most West Coast IPAs, and the finish is very hoppy, very bitter. However, it's like Alpine and their IPAs : sure they're classics, but nowadays, they're nothing exceptional. Now in Europe we get better IPAs from Omnipollo or Oppigards. And we have access to quite a few great American IPAs as well. So as far as American IPAs go, I believe that AleSmith or Bells are much better. You may find that Stone IPA is cheaper in the US than the ones I've mentioned, but for a German brewed product, I've had this one for 4.1 € per 33 cl can, more than an imported Torpedo IPA, and a similar price to what I paid for an imported Bell's Two Hearted Ale. It's brewed right next door, it should be cheaper than the ones crossing the Atlantic... In any case, it may have been a classic 19 years ago, but it ain't one now.

Very less fruity, almost all about the bitterness. Does it age that bad? the third taste confirm the second one : it's a lot about a grapefruit bitterness and citrus acidity. Not much of melon anymore. The melon comes back a bit in the smell as it's warming up. Also the head doesn't stay long. I have to lower my ratings.

147,88,moodenba,4.16,"Case of bottles Stone IPA purchased at big box store in NY state 6/27/16.  45-50 F temperature bottle poured into a highball glass. Big lasting head on top of a light amber brew.. Aroma from a distance was strong and beery. A close sniff yielded a fine delicate hop aroma. Taste was a powerful bitter blast of hops  My preference these days is for a maltier, more balanced brew, with a similar color to this one. Stone IPA probably has some of the character of the old Ballantine ale from Newark (pre 1970). The Ballantine had a similar color, a rocky, long lasting head, big aroma, and possibly a bit more malt character. _____________________________________________ Cask Stone IPA was found at BBD in Rocky Point NY in July, 2017. The cask version was expertly served with appropriate low carbonation and temperature, about 60F. This serving style knocks the edges off the hoppy character to produce a full flavored, balanced ale. One of the two or three best cask beers I've encountered (Blue Point ESB and an old version of Bridgeport Porter are two competitors). _________________________________________________________ I purchased a case of cans of Stone IPA at a discounter in spring of 2019. After having had several, I broke out my intense lamp and magnifying glass to read the label. Oh no! "" . . . tropical aromas and flavors . . . achieved . . . with an awesome new hop blend"". Must have been subtle since I didn't pick up on it initially. At least they are honest.

This beer's flavor is dominated by hops. Magnum hops are unforgivably bitter. This starts piney, has a hint of citrus, ending with a dominant hoppy bitterness. F: Perfection O: This is a great IPA.

Feel: On the lighter side of feel.  Taste: Hops and pine resin leave a lingering bitterness, with the subtle fruit flavors appearing within.  Overall: Had a the Firkin Fest 2016 in Ashland, KY. I am surprised I haven't had this yet, since I see it all the time at the store. Regardless, I haven't and I saw it, so I tried it.

Clear orange amber color with one and a half finger foamy white head, it has good retention and leaves lot of lacing patch and spot once gradually dissipated along with everlasting frothy sheet atop.  The aroma is predominated by hops with a citrus, lemon, piney, spicy, and herbal notes. There is also some sweet bready malt in the background too.  Hops forward in the taste disclosing many characters ranging from spicy, bitter, piney, citrusy, lemony, and herbal. That is so great hop profile. A flash of malt is in the flavor compartment too but in subtle fashion while hops still continue to dominate and wrap all the things up to make a robust yet clean bitter finish.  Medium body with smooth mouthfeel along with a touch of lively carbonation through the palate, crisp and refreshing, finish is dry.

But, Stone's hop combos are too different from the classic Northern California style that I most appreciate (like Anchor Liberty.) Stone's IPA starts with semi-clear, light amber Looks and the mostly citrus (some pine) Smells. But the Tastes initial malt sweetness just gets whacked by that combo of hops and its bitterness continues into a way-to-dry finish. OA: I didn't like Stone IPA the first time I Had it and certainly not the second for this review. I doubt there will be a third.  Stone's IPA is reviewed on the ""1001"" list, I presume, because it is popular and it helped define the hoppy revolution that emerged from San Diego.

Very strong notes of pine and a pleasant under layer of onion. What surprises me here and what brings a welcome appearance is a nice malt backbone to balance things out.  A crisp carbonation follows through on the feel and provides perfect stability for the flavors.  Overall, Stone IPA was better than anticipated. I was expecting an onion bomb but pleasantly surprised here. Will have again.    Edit, had another one. Fresh from the bottle poured into glass. It was all onion, pine, and utter bitterness.

The flavor starts with some quick citrus, followed by a much larger wallop of dank herbal notes and a lot of dark pine, and finishing in a mellow but bitter caramel flavor. The mouthfeel is full but refreshingly fizzy. Overall this is an awesome beer. While caramel-pine west coast IPAs are not my favorite, it is impossible to ignore how well this beer is done.

High points for me were in the taste and mouth feel. This beer is tasty and easy drinking giving some good happy points. The downside to this one is the price point.

I grew up in SD not too far from classic iconic breweries such as pizza port, port, lost abbey and of course STONE. Here is my first time reviewing the beer:  Appearance. Yellowish Orange, Gold hues and not exactly amber. Decent little white head. Small bubbles shooting towards the surface.  Aroma: get a little pine, a little grapefruit, bready malt characteristics with an evident caramel sweetness  Taste: its crazy how after years of acclimating the palate with hundreds and hundreds of IPA's this particular beer is not super bitter, super hoppy or super aggressive at all, the way I used to perceive it back in the day. It tastes very balanced. The Hops, the yeast, the Malts all come together in a highly drinkable brew but its not super impressive the way I used to think it was. It's a solid go to but doesn't have much depth or any distinct highlights worth discussing. It is lemony and citrusy of course and a dry decent finish.  Mouthfeel: it's pretty light, its got that standard carbonation. Holds itself together nicely but yea about a light medium feel.  Overall: I respect this beer. It's a pioneer and a game changer. This bitter grassy piney bomb changed the way I started drinking, purchasing and talking about beer. Cheers mofos.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Appearance: Golden/orange in color. About 1.5 fingers of white foamy head Smell:Plenty of hops aroma with a mix of citrus. Taste: Complex mixture of balanced bitterness and sweetness. Goes down pretty easily with only a mildly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Smooth and full-bodied with a moderate level of carbonation.

Look: Slightly hazy straw gold color with a 3/4"" foamy white head that held up well, eventually reducing to a 1/8"" foam ring that lasted to the end due to a light but constant carbonation. Strong lacing throughout.  Smell: Sweet floral, pine and citrus hops with a damp earth undertone. Pleasant maltiness  Taste: Flavors of grass and pine resins, solid malt back end but hops dominate.

Upfront you get to enjoy the carbonation and a perfect mixture of the malty sweetness, citric, herbal floral and piney flavors and the abundant bitterness. Starts off balanced, but the bitterness begins to kick when it heads to the finish, which is long. The hoppy flavors are very assertive all throughout this beer, which is scrumptious.

Piney, citrusy, floral taste: Stone likes to boast about hops, but this is balanced well with malts. Nice pale malts match the bitter hops Mouthfeel: smooth, pleasant, well carbonated.

This is a 3 month old bottle, (freshest on the shelf), and the flavors are a little muted, the aroma is better, weird. FEEL: Smooth and creamy, not as carbonated as I would have thought from looking at it. A little slick at first and then dries up nicely on the finish. OVERALL: My first Stone product. Would love to try it again a little fresher. The flavor was basically bitter muted grapefruit. The aroma was pretty nice, weird because I've always heard the hop aroma goes away first. I'll try another when I can, this is not yet available where I live. EDIT: Grabbed a six pack from a different location. The website says 'enjoy by date' on the shoulder of the bottle? My ASS!!! There is a code of some kind on the bottom of the bottle printed in black that you can only see when the bottle is empty. That said, the beer was good.

147,88,JDaV,5,"So I got this at a gas station and totally thought I was getting ripped off at first but went with it anyway to take a chance on this beer (i had already paid and they weren't going to give me money back). Anyway I checked it out on here and saw there was some pretty good hype about it so I got pretty excited. Spoiler alert; the hype is real. Considering the style of beer this is it is pretty much as close to perfect as everyone makes it out to be.  I poured hard from bottle into the trusty weapon that is my pint glass and poured one of the most gorgeous beers to ever sit in front of me. Frothy, white-ish head. The color was an ambiguously solid gold. The beer stands and looks clear but hazy in a way that you feel it could also nearly be opaque. I held it up to light and saw yeast particles nearly microscopic in size that helped give the beer its perfectly clear/solid complexion.  The smell is perfect. Strong and hoppy. Somewhat fruity but not in a ""fruity beer"" way.  The taste is full. And when I say full I mean FULL. It's bittersweet. it starts with a flip flopping of bitter and sweet hop notes. Very strong hop character. Then you also get a touch of the fruit similar to the nose with a very yeasty finish. An interesting thing I noticed, and quite enjoy, is that if you take a minute between gulps, a lingering aftertaste of pineapple subtly resides on the pallets as the hop bitterness settles. I also would like to note that one of the Alström brothers said to burp after taking a gulp. I tried this and it was pretty awesome, really helps to kickstart the pineapple lingering effect.  Mouthfeel is thick and wholesome. The beer is about as heavy as you will assume it to be in both mouthfeel and alcohol content. 3 of these honestly kind of does the job for me.  I have never been sure about when or not I am having a (almost) perfect beer, but I was sure this time. It was way good. Perfect for any hop head and anyone who likes to get the funny feels off a few deliscious brews. I am savoring the last few sips of my last unit out of the sixer and can say I will definitely be getting this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

That being said, it is a great beer and my town is missing out having a six pack just chilling for that long in the big HEB.  Pours a brightish, golden malty color, with great lacing. Leaves foam rings the whole way through. Has a clean, malty hop smell, a bit astringent in a great way. Taste is very bright and hoppy, with a zesty citrus combined with pine to make a quite a resinous drink. Upon drinking, I immediately realized that I was not dealing with an average beer -- this is one to which you can hold other beers as a standard. Truly sessionable, great beer even when its apparently out of date.  I have had nothing but great from Stone, the Ruination 2.0 is a bit better and more robust but this is quite a great beer as far as taste and feel goes. Also hides a bit more alcohol. This one is Definitely a winner if you're looking for a new gem to add to the long list of incredible American IPA's. Very chill beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,akdo,4.75,"Look: The beer pours a dark orange body and has a generous one-finger white head. It recedes to a thin white layer with a few holes and a solid white crown. The beer's lacing is excellent and the marks on the glass stay for a very long time.  Smell: A lot of hops on the nose as well as citrus and grapefruit rinds. The nose is not floral; it is just strong enough to tempt you.  Taste: The malt profile is very subtle in favour of the hoppiness, which is not a bad thing as this is a Californian IPA. The beer's front end has a nice taste of citrus and grapefruit. Then it moves to notes of smoked pine woods. This suggest that Cascade hops were used in the brewing process. All in all, the bitterness was not too overwhelming.  Feel: The mouthfeel is medium-bodied because of the smoked taste. The finish is super clean and there is no remnants of beer on your tongue. Therefore, there is no after taste. Speaking about the alcoholic warmth in your throat, it is almost lukewarm.  Overall: Although this beer's bitterness is almost at the end of the IBU spectrum for IPAs, it is very well balanced by the smoked taste of Cascade hops and other hops I could not recognize. Moreover, I love how this IPA does not downplay its Californian identity unlike Lagunitas IPA, which tasted too much like an IPA from the East Coast. I would gladly drink Stone IPA again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,crisis1290,4.5,"Stone IPA (India Pale Ale) - Stone Brewing Co is a killer beer to say the least. This one is outstanding. I could drink this one all the time. Great aroma. Grapefruit, lemon and Piney hops with a dash of citrus. Great amber/copper color. The flavor matched the scent too the Tee. Very citrus forward (notable lemon) with nice piney after taste. Super carbonation and a nice foam head. If you are a hop head, give this one a shot. This beer is very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BrokenEdge,4.41,"This might be the single best IPA I've had yet in my beer journey (okay, I haven't had many yet, but still). It was really everything you want in an IPA, intensely bitter but still smooth and drinkable. I sipped it almost nonstop and finished in record time, pausing only to marvel periodically at the swirls of foam, thick lacing, and beautiful copper color. Very prevalent hops but not overwhelming. Everyone should definitely try it, it's a classic of the style for a reason.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bilbobrewer,4.33,"Bottled on 11/13/15..pretty fresh. 6.9% abv.... easy to drink, even sessionable. The hops here are a little more towards the bittering end vs. aroma. Some juniper aftertaste. A really good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TLWalsh,4.16,Pours a hazy orange straw color with a thin white head that persisted and laced nicely. Has a fruity citrusy aroma with a piney overtone. The mouthfeel is medium and well carbonated with a typical IPA hoppy piney flavor. Finishes very nice with a pleasant building bitterness that's well balanced. I'd buy this again.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,twage04,4,Very little malt but lots of pine from the chinook hops. There is a little citrusy fruit thing going on too but the pine is the dominent flavor. Overall a solid IPA but is pretty standard hop profile and taste for your run of the mill west coast IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Umdrunner,3.94,Poured dark straw/copper with 1 finger fluffy white head into snifter. Great head retention and lacing. Scent is strong on citrus with some subtle piny notes.

147,88,Sabtos,3.42,"Clear amber-gold with a fluffy and thick off-white head leaving tons of lace in layers.  Smell is a little catty, dank lemon and grapefruit. As it warms, it becomes more pungent and piney, with cornbread, biscuit and rug.  Taste is really fruity and crisp lemon-lime, with toasted malt, a little pine wood, pretty bitter, finishing dry.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,vikinggary28,4.2,"Poured from bottle into glass mug. I don't know why I waited so long to try this one, I guess there are so many out there. It has a nice copper/amber colour and smells of mild hops with some citrus, very good because it was not overpowering. Taste is not overly hoppy, a perfect blend of hops, citrus, pine that is found in most west coast IPA's but done much better here. Goes down smooth. Prost!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Pete_2112,4.51,"At first sip I was a little worried that I might not like this one as much. But as I've gotten accustomed to the flavors and let the beer warm up a bit, I have come to really enjoy this beer. The smell is pretty dang hoppy in my opinion. I can smell the malt for sure, along with some earthy and citrus, floral hops. Now the taste is the best part. It's like the flavor just comes out of nowhere. The bitterness is there and delicious. You can taste hop resin, a little citrus, and again, the floral notes. The malt sweetness is definitely there as well. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is perfect. Overall, this beer is great and I will drink this resinous babe again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ckval1972,4.84,The best IPA that you get nearly everywhere. Ruined all other mass available IPAs - if the store or restaurant doesn't have it - I get wine. Always check freshness date to ensure you're getting the best product. L: Somewhere between quality honey and new copper with thin foamy head that persists for some time S: Floral though a little boozy smelling T: Words elude me to describe accurately - though having an ABV of 6.9 - you don't taste it. Citrus notes. Wonderful gulpability - if you don't like to sip. There's a faint residual bitterness but much less so than other West Coast style IPAs. F: Slight residual stickiness that enhances taste. Satisfying and delightful feel going down throat and in gut.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Marius,4.31,"Had this on tap at Craft & Draft in Amsterdam. A great beer, light bodied and heavy on the tropical fruit - pineapple and mango - plus a bit of grapefruit, on top of a bitter and refreshing body. The alcohol is quite well hidden.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kurqt,4.28,"With a 94 on the BA score, a 99 on the Bros score, and numerous personal recommendations, I'm coming into this review with extremely high expectations.  A: First let me say how much I like the packaging: the black and green color scheme, the expertly done drawing of the gargoyle, the way the label seems to be ingrained on the bottle through some manner of witchcraft.  Thin, foamy white head upon pouring. Drank out of an off-brand clear plastic cup because I've got no class at all. A layer of foam stays for minutes on the surface of the drink and around the edges of the cup, while carbonation visibly bubbles in a continuous and slow-moving manner towards the top. When held up to the light, the color could be most closely compared to honey (when the honey's in a bottle, not when it's being poured).  S: I smelled right after opening and was bulled over for just a split second. I'm still refining my beer nose, I'd characterize the smell as hardy, as being full-bodied yet having a lofty component. Nothing unusual per se, but a strong, reliable, yet distant sort of effect that I found myself smelling over and over again as I tried to pin it down.  T/M/O: This one's a straight shooter, definitely right-handed. What makes this beer great isn't some unexpected burst of flavor or unusual ingredient; it's the overall quality, the competence of the execution; it's the graceful balance between substance and drinkability. This beer rides like a dream. I'm going to sound like a broken record, but it strikes a tasteful balance between being light and pleasant, while also being bitter and complex enough that I want to keep sipping on it over and over again.  This beer did meet the high bar I had set for it before sampling it, though not in the way that I'd expected. This is the beer that I will judge other IPA's against; it is the standard for a well-made, high quality IPA without frills or gimmicks. I'm excited to compare some of the more adventurous takes on the IPA formula, my previous favorites (Great Lakes' ""Burning River,"" Jackie-O's ""Mystic Mama""), to this classic.  Addendum I: As someone who's always preferred things that were a little different, I don't think this could ever be my personal favorite beer. Stone IPA is like the girl your parents want you to marry: comforting and substantial, but nothing exotic or challenging, nothing to get excited or passionate about. I find myself wanting something a little bitterer (is that a word?), though I know that I'm an IBU fiend.  Addendum II: I've been sipping from bottle number two for a while now, and I keep coming back and lowering the score by intervals of .25. In the future, I think I'll try to rate beers blind, without any knowledge of the BA score, because I feel like knowing the BA score beforehand clouds my judgment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sgt_187em,4.12,"Very good IPA. Had this from tap at BJ's. Had about a 1/2"" thick white head and a copper color. Hoppy taste from start to finish and a nice medium thick body. I'll try again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,devo1980,4.42,Awesome beer. Just fantastic. With so many junk IPAs out there - this sets the standard of what an India Pale Ale shoud be. Tons of flavor and the bite is just right.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ddugan,4.27,"One of my go to beers. Pours a very nice copper color with a medium white head. Smells like a west coast IPA should. Very hop forward with citrus, grapefruit, and pine.

I'll always have a soft spot for Stone IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It has a good amount of bitterness with a nice malt backbone. Feels medium bodied, smooth with moderate low carbonation. This is a great IPA.

147,88,CO-Bloom,4.19,"Passed by this well known and well regarded IPA for a couple of years now. What was I thinking?!?  One reason I love stone? They give you a brewed on and best by date and it is only 3 months apart! They really want you to drink it fresh, which I so appreciate them giving us that information (unfortunately many still don't)  L-Clear amber, off-white head, and nice sticky lacing. S- a little muted, but with a little swirl in the tulip I get some really nice pine, citrus, spicy hops and a bit of sweetness from the malt. T- follows nose but more intense. Big pungent pine, lemon, grapefruit and orange peel. Great amount of bitterness up front which lingers into a slight sweetness. The slightest bit of alcohol burn as it warms but nothing that detracts. F- Good carbonation that allows it to be big and slightly sticky but also crisp and refreshing. It rides that line well for me although it has a higher ABV. O- Wow, this holds up remarkably well in the almost 20 years it has been brewed (not sure how much they have tweaked the recipe, if at all). I can't imagine how much this blew away the taste buds of beer nerds when it first came out. A good standard barer for the piney, citrus west coast variety of the style. Really like it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Not a very strong smell, I am not detecting much, perhaps a vague piney hop aroma.  T: Floral and herbal hops immediately come to mind as I take my first sip. Perhaps some hints of fruit (grape?) as well. Overall, a decent taste, but nothing too complex or fantastic.  F: Carbonation is moderate light. Body is medium.

147,88,Dave97,4.99,"Poor - From a 12oz bottle - Nice frothy poor. Nice 2 finger frothy head that settles down to a thin top lining. Very nice lacing.  Appearance - Nice 24k gold/amber. Nice haze, no particles. A Gorgeous beer. Not a lot of carbonation.  Nose - Beautiful nose. Not huge like some DIPA's, but very nice nonetheless. Dank, tropical, pine, resin, citrus. Very nice.  Mouthfeel - Nice medium body, Not fizzy, dry and crisp. Very easy drinking.  Taste - Loads of spice; nutmeg, ginger, cardamon and clove. Very nice sweet malt backbone, but not too much. And of course tons of hop bitterness. Might as well just be chewing on some hops; Sour, bitter, herbaceous, piney and resiny.  Finish - When closer to room temperature, there is an actual crystallized sugar/malt on the finish and taste. This is a personal distinction I've made about this beer only. The main reason that keeps me coming back to this one over and over. The finish is long and delicious. Sweet/sour on sides of tongue and nice granny smith sour on the back of the throat. Overall a lasting sour lemon.  Overall - This is my double IPA. I'm not a double IPA drinker, they are all too over the top for my personal taste. I also don't like a total grapefruit bomb. This definitely has a little grapefruit but not ALL grapefruit. All in all just a juicy, dank, piney, delicious IPA. This one of my all time favorite beers.  Food pairings - hot red curry.

Although faint, the smell is rather pleasant.  T Pretty hoppy and dry upfront, with a surprisingly malty finish. The hops are citrusy. Despite the lofty commercial description, this brew is pretty damn smooth; I could easily see myself drinking a few in one sitting. Stone’s website lists this as 77 IBUs; I wouldn’t have said more than 65 or 70.  F: Medium body and medium carbonation. Some warmth from the alcohol.  Overall Impression: A very solid IPA and with Stone’s freshness policy you can generally expect it to be real fresh.

Appearance: It poured a clear golden copper colour with a one finger white head that had good retention and leaves nice spotty lacing.  Aroma: Fainter than I expected but starts with tropical mango and pineapple before turning to pine, grass and citrus lemon zest.  Taste: There was none of the tropicalness from the smell, but strong lemon zest, hop bitterness, floral and grassiness.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation.  Overall: This was only just ok for me. It wasn’t bad and I would drink it again but for example I prefer Stone’s Go To IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nice spotting, but not much true lacing.  S: A bold, but vague citrusy tartness. Some ale yeast esters. Some mild resin. A little disappointed in this department, actually. Bottle's only 33 days old.  T: Dry, clean arrival, balancing malt across the middle with moderate bitter pine and resin; closing out to a dry, lingering medicinal hop finish.  M: Lighter side of midweight, less carbonation than the appearance suggests; quite slick on the finish.  O: Now THIS is what I consider a West Coast IPA. There is very little fruit on the nose, and very little sweetness on the palate. It is clearly imbalanced in favor of hops, but strangely, it works. Though so many try to do this and fail, Stone succeeds. Is it a go-to IPA for me? No, I was disappointed with the nose; I like more than just a little vague tartness; I also like more fruit-forward and sweeter/maltier IPAs. Not offputting at 70-some IBUs.

Found the beer to be overwhelmingly hoppy. I see the beer is dry hopped. Maybe I need an IPA that's not dry hopped, if there is such a thing. Maybe it's California IPAs that I don't enjoy.

147,88,Strat58cat,4.37,"I've seen reviewers ragging on Stone IPA as not sufficiently extreme. Then they praise Firestone Union Jack which is way over the top. The point of an IPA is not to be extreme. It's not a double IPA. The point of an IPA is to be enjoyed to the maximum extent. Stone is working some sort of gargoyle magic on this brew. It's excellent.  The look is everything an IPA should be. It's nothing unusual. Nice color and plenty of head. The head retains well and laces down the glass, showing a quality malt.  The smell is everything an IPA should be, and nothing it shouldn't be. You don't have to vent excess pine to keep your eyes from watering from fumes (I'm looking at you Rebel) or to catch the underlying complex bouquet. It's got everything - spice, fruit, pine, but nothing is overwhelming. It's a righteous aroma and not at all too much.  Now, it's Stone and you can look up the IBU and see it's 70. You'd think it would be like trying to drink a pint of lime juice, but it isn't. The flavors of spice, fruit and hint of pine combine with the flavors to make it right. The taste is just what IPA should be. That's all.  The bitterness comes into play when it comes to feel and finish. It's clean. In the bad old days of my youth, you might drink a corn-laden Miller or Michelob, and after a few maybe they didn't want to stay down as that corny malt feeling set in. You could kill myriad of the relatively bitter watery-rice Budweiser's, though. It's like this: bitter makes it clean. Now, at Stone's brilliant level, the bitter makes it clean. It finishes clean. Stops on a dime. Time for another.  This is good stuff. It's also widely available, at least in California, although not cheap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,thehyperduck,4.14,"Bomber from the LCBO; best before Sept 9 2015. Served slightly chilled.  Pours a hazy golden-amber colour, resulting in the production of a modest-sized, half-inch head of white foam. It dissipates relatively rapidly, lasting no more than a minute or two until it has been fully replaced with a thin collar and bubbly film, along with a small curtain of lace. Average-looking. The aroma includes a fruity mélange of juicy tangerine, grapefruit zest and apricot notes, with more subdued suggestions of pine resin, tropical fruit and doughy, biscuity malt sweetness.  As you'd expect, Stone's IPA is really quite unabashed about its bitterness - the backbone of doughy, biscuity malts and caramel sweetness, though detectable, has little chance of holding out for long. Juicy peach/apricot shows up soon enough, along with slight hints of pineapple by mid-sip. From this point on, your tongue takes a serious beating from the hops - it is highly bitter, with lots of orange and pithy grapefruit citrus astringency. It becomes more floral and increasingly resiny as you approach the finish, ending with a lingering pine oil bitterness and a slight hint of boozy warmth. Medium-bodied; perhaps just barely leaning toward the fuller side, with restrained carbonation levels and a smooth mouthfeel. Leaves a bit of a slick/oily feel behind on the palate after each sip. I find it to be much more drinkable than a 6.9% beer really should be, but to be fair, non hop-heads will probably come away with a different assessment, because the bitterness really is kind of relentless.  Final Grade: 4.14, a very respectable A-. Stone IPA is one of the grand-daddies of 'em all. I had a sip of this, many years ago - I think the product placement on ""Weeds"" made me curious about it - but at the time, it was just way too god damn bitter for me to tolerate. After years of blatant hop abuse, however, I'm finding it to be a much more agreeable tipple. For a beer that is only three weeks from expiry, it is drinking fairly nicely, though I would argue that several domestic brewers have been making IPAs that equal (and occasionally, surpass) the irrefutable quality of this flagship offering. Of the three Stone beers that are currently available in Ontario (this, Cali-Belgique and Arrogant Bastard), I am least-enamoured with this one. It's still really good - just not $9 a bomber good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A solid blend of hops and coffee notes finishing with various spices.  M - Light to medium bodied beer, averagely carbonated. Fresh and crisp finish with a mild hop aftertaste.

147,88,HoppyBastard,4.29,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, ""enjoy by"" date 6-25-15.  APPEARANCE: pours a clear, dark golden color with one-finger white head that quickly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is a moderate amount of lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.  SMELL: flowers, sweet honey, citrus/grapefruit, pine, bread, very pleasant to the nose.  TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet honey and citrus then an assertive piney hop profile that really lingered.  PALATE: medium body and carbonation.  OVERALL: this is my second beer from Stone, the other was pale ale and I disliked it so much I avoided all their other beers until now. Clearly, that was a mistake, this is a very good IPA, it's more assertive than most but would appeal to anyone who enjoys the style, I would have this again for sure and will try more from this brewer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,DabblinWiscCraft,4.31,"Found this at the Four Firkins in Minneapolis. The best by date suggests it's still good for another three weeks. Poured right from the fridge into my pint glass.  L: Pours a warm honey amber with about an inch-and-a-half of white, dense head that sticks around for a nice bit and leaves some cling on the glass. Clear, with lots of specks of particulate and moderate carbonation visible.  S: Pine hops are the prominent notes in the bouquet, along with some grapefruit and orange/tangerine. Some bready malt notes lingering underneath it all. Not a huge aroma to this one.  T: Assertive pine hop notes right out of the gate, with the caramel and bready malts working to keep things in check. A bit of citrus as the taste moves to the middle--some orange and grapefruit. There's also a bit of clear alcohol as it moves into the back. The close is probably my favorite part about this beer: there's nice resinous pine and much more assertive grapefruit rind that have a little stick and carry the aftertaste for a good long while.  F: On the heavier side for a single IPA, this one makes you feel like you're drinking a substantial beer. It's got smoothness/creaminess, but that quickly turns bright/bitter by the back end, leaving some substantial bitter on the palate. The carbonation is spot-on.  O: I wasn't sure if this one could live up to the hype for me, but it definitely did. This is an expertly crafted IPA that has beautiful straightforward hop flavors that really hit the tongue hard. For all of the big flavor, it still manages to deliver some complexity. I will definitely revisit this one again when I have the chance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ovaltine,4.42,"Pours a nearly clear copper color with a creamy white head that clings to the glass. Wow, is this a gorgeous beer. The nose features dank tropical citrus, primarily tangerine, grapefruit, and lemon. Officially drooling.  Those dank citrus flavors are forward and unrelenting - they are nicely bitter and unapologetic about their flavorful, bitter profile. This defines the WCIPA style, as does the drying mouthfeel.

147,88,slyme,4.49,"Look- exactly what you expect from a miraculous ipa. Dark golden in color, lacing down the glass, and a medium thick pillowy head. Very inviting.  Smell- smells baseline. Underlying citrus but primarily floral, hoppy notes. To be honest, as spectacular as the taste is, isdexpect a more intense, piney smell. That being said, it smells like an ipa.  Taste- this is where this beer becomes legendary. When you order an ipa, you have certain expectations. Strong flavor, beautiful bitterness, and a smell that utters ""buckle your seatbelts, this is about to get real."" Stone ipa reminds you of why you avoid domesticated beers, and thrive for artistry. This beer, my friends, is one that you can consider one of the ""royal ipa's""  Feel- Incredibly intense floral notes, yet this beer is incredibly light, and easy to drink. High carbonation, relatable to a cold soda on a hot day. This may not fall under feel, but this beer takes me back to my first ipa experience and caresses me at all the turns it first took me on.

147,88,Pantalones,4.3,"My third bottle of this one from the six-pack, has the numbers ""24 15"" with a squiggle or symbol of some sort between them... bottling date or best-by date of some sort? I saw a 6 on one, and numbers like 24 and 26 on others, so I'm guessing this means the best-by dates are toward the later end of June 2015.  Anyway, on to the beer. Looks dark gold, bordering on orangey, mostly clear with lots and lots of tiny little bubbles coming up. Nice head of almost-white foam on top, which is gradually shrinking but hasn't quite gotten to ""thin coating at the surface"" as of my writing this. Leaves a whole lot of lacing behind as it goes, too -- the inside of my glass seems to have been painted to resemble a white kitchen sponge in some places, there's so much of a foam trail covering it. Bottle/""label"" design is neat too, I don't see many of the ""printed directly onto the glass"" labels like this.  The smell is really great on this beer. Hoppiness the moment you open the bottle, and while pouring. Mostly citrusy, which is an interesting change from the way so many IPAs seem to have a lot more pine in them to me. There's a bit of a piney, leafy thing going on when I take a sniff now (the initial citrus blast fades a bit as the foam on top shrinks) and some other fruitiness coming in, but the citrus is still the primary smell.  Taste is nice, too. A lot of citrus, and there's more pine than in the smell but it's not as dominant of a flavor as in several of the other IPAs I've had. Bitterness is significant (but not overwhelming) and has a bit of a leafy thing to it, hangs around for a just a bit at the end. I get just a little of a bread-crusty sort of malt flavor here and there, but the hops are definitely the primary flavor, as expected of an IPA. In the previous bottle I occasionally picked up something that reminded me of cinnamon, oddly enough. I got just a hint of this with my last drink from this glass, too, actually. In previous bottles I've also picked up on something that reminded me of walking through the woods in a way, I'm guessing a combination of piney/leafy hop flavor and maybe something else? Wasn't getting quite as much of that this time (more citrus, pine, leafy) but it stood out to me in the previous bottles I've had, so I figured I'd mention it here.  Feel is good too for the most part. Maybe just a tad bit more fizzy/bubbly than I would've liked, but very drinkable (while still feeling more substantial than water or lighter beers.) The near-7% alcohol is completely undetectable, I can't pick up on any mouth-warming or alcohol-type flavors at all. Overall feel is nicely ""in-between,"" not too light and dry but not too heavy and sticky either. Overall leaning a bit more toward the dry side.  Overall, this is probably my favorite IPA so far. The smell is great (especially the initial citrus blast when pouring) and I'm really liking how there's a bit more complexity going on in the flavor rather than just an explosion of hops (though that's certainly there too!) -- it's like someone took the things I like about ""regular"" pale ales scaled all that up to IPA-strength. Which is exactly what an IPA is supposed to be, isn't it -- a bigger, hoppier, higher-ABV version of a pale ale? Very nice first impression from a brewery that's only recently appeared in the stores around here -- I will be trying more of their lineup (and probably more of this one) in the future for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,taxandbeerguy,4.31,"18oz poured on tap at the local Bier Markt one day for lunch. Saw this and figured it was a must have as otherwise accessibility to this heralded beer is non-existent in Ontario.  Appearance - Bright golden color, with some bronze hues. Poured a respectable one finger of head, with decent retention and a nice soapy collar left behind afterwards. Cloudy in appearance but not hazy.  Smell- Delicious blend of lemon, graepfruit some malty sweetness, combined with a sweeter tropical fruit and some mandarin orange. Very enticing and among the best smelling IPA's I've had.  Taste - Wow this was good. Starts sweet, very juicy and fruity with the sweetened grapefruit and something like an unripe strawberry flavor, before the lemon starts to control things and ends rather bitter (and tart). Yet there is some maltiness in the back to prevent this from being too unbalanced, but the juicy fruit flavors are the star. A bit boozy towards the end of the glass, prevents this from getting a 4.5.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and very crisp with the most invisible and seamless level of moderate carbonation I have ever experienced. Great feel.

S: A nice hop presence, pine pine pine T: Not very balanced IMHO- not that its a bad thing, but i'm getting a ton of pine foretaste and aftertaste. Malts come through just a few times and are isolated, the rest of the time they are overpowered by hop which is sort of the point. M: crisp, very crisp O: A solid west coast style IPA.

Caramel malts shine through on the palate in the beginning with obvious caramel flavors, then the fresh yet powerful bittering hops clean house. Mouthfeel starts heavier and finishes light due to the flavor profile. This beer has depth and character, and is at the top of the IPA food chain by a long shot.

A - frothy off-white head leaves a spattering of lacing at the top of the glass. Body is golden and crystal clear; sometimes there's some particulate yeast but not this time. S - zesty lemon and grapefruit, but it's a rather mild nose. A fresher bottle might have helped here T - a bit tart and very bitter with lemon and grapefruit zest controlling the palate. Malt is mild and more like pilsner than anything. Some grassy and piny hops and a very slight herbal aspect in there as well M - medium body, moderate carbonation, finishes bitter and dry O - one of my favorite IPAs. Delicious and refreshing.

147,88,Beric,4.26,"Serving: Bottle into snifter Served: 31 March 2014  Appearance: Pours a nice deep orange color with a creamy 1.5 finger head. Didn't leave any lacing but that could be due to the glass.  Smell: Huge citrus hop notes in the nose with an underlying malt sweetness. Very pure nose without much funk at all.  Taste: Really superbly drinkable- a nice hop bitterness contrasts with the sweet malt base. The malts add some depth of flavor without imparting much character- it just seems to be there to carry the hops down the palate without it being too much of an herbal mess. The hops themselves provide a huge amount of citrus flavor- lemon zest, grapefruit juice, a hint of lemongrass, and some cajeput to tie it all together. Really great hop flavor here.  Mouthfeel: One of the best feeling IPAs I've had- nice medium body without being sticky. Excellent carbonation- nice medium bubbles- carry the beer smoothly across the palate.  Overall: An excellent IPA, and one that is drinkable and world-class without being gimmicky, overly boozy, or anything else. Just a straight-shooting IPA with incredible purity of flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Light fruit and hop aromatics, relatively weak on the nose.  T - Smooth, light malts, quickly dissipating into both fruity and floral hop flavors, smoothing and sweetening out into a boozy aftertaste.  M - A bit fizzy, but very creamy and smooth for an IPA. It settles in well to let the palate talk.  O - Perhaps my opinion is skewed having tried a couple other Stone IPA's prior to this one.

The smell is intense with floral and pine aromas with vague hints of citrus. The taste reflects this, lots of hoppy goodness with a little malt to back it up. In my opinion this is definitely a hop forward beer. Definitely refreshing after a long day. Usually I like my IPAs more on the citrusy side rather than floral or piny, but for this I will make an exception. I understand why this is a world class beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

M: On the fuller end of medium body, moderate carbonation.  O: Properly hoppy, shows why it's a true standard for the style. Still not my favorite, but a solid classic.  Update: Stone IPA 1.1  A: Pours golden Amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and laces well.  S: Piney, floral, slightly fruity, citrus, bready malt, and a touch of sweetness.  T: Resinous pine, floral, citrus, grapefruit and lemon, a little stone fruit, apricot, peach, faintly tropical, dank herbal notes, bready malt, and a touch of sweetness.

147,88,Gajo74,4.43,"Appearance: nice golden and amazingly clear brew. It starts of with a decent fingernail length head and dissipates into a frothy thin lice that retains throughout. Smell: initially did not detect much of an aroma. However, after a few sips I became aware of a sweet aroma that becomes more and more pronounced as the drink warms. Lots of fruity esters, particularly pineapple, bannana and pear. Taste: the taste is, for me, quite a contrast to the aroma. Hardly any of the tropical fruit sweetness, instead, the bitterness of the hops hits you upon first taste and retains throughout. The finish is bitter and yeasty. There are also herbal, spicy and piney elements to the taste. If you are a hops head, this is the one for you. The only thing that I would have liked to see was for the sweet aroma to be more prominent in the taste and provide some balance to the hops. Feel: smooth, creamy and drinkable.

The tropical fruit flavors also shine through in the flavor. Underneath everything is a nice malt base suggesting light caramel. It's medium bodied with a lingering herbal bitterness in the aftertaste.  Even though I complain alot about American IPAs, I sure seem to drink plenty of them.

Hard-pressed to find a better looking beer (especially the head).  Smell - notes of grapefruit, citrus, raisins, and bready maltiness.  Taste - the hops didn't really hit me up front. Goes down very smooth. The finish is very long-lasting and bitter hops really come on here. Nice bitterness that persists for a very long time.  Feel - you can argue about what the finish does for you. I find it savory for a while but it goes on a bit long for my taste, resulting in an interesting mouthfeel. I feel like it desensitized me from what could have been the full experience. My only major complaint.  Overall - one of the best looking beers you will find.

Glassy, green, fresh taste with a grapefruit flavor. Great sipper but the bite of the beer can sometimes fatigue the pallet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SitkaSteve,4.25,"Almost hard to believe I've never said anything on this beer until now. I've always had this in a pint glass and for today once again, yes in a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light foamy lacing clings but trickles after a while. The smell had a sharp pine assault of bitter hops with a light spice intertwining in and out on the aroma. The taste copied the smell and carried a nice bitter pine into the spice of this beer. Light pine to spicy aftertaste lead to a dry finish. The mouthfeel had a light to medium bodied sessionable dry spiciness rolling over my tongue. Overall, I say this has and always will be a go to for me as an AIPA. Its hard not to find practically anywhere.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Southerndiscomfort,2.54,Its alright. Don't understand the hype but they are a top notch brewery this just ain't enough citrus or any fruity hop presence enough for me to purchase again.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MisterGone,4.44,"There is another brand that bills itself as quite possibly the best IPA in America. It isn't. This isn't either. But it comes damn close. The one that started the hop addiction in San Diego and beyond is just a world class IPA, though.  Poured from a tap at some unmentionable chain that thankfully has decent craft brew on tap. Pint glass a little too cold (in a chain restaurant, really?). Beautiful orange hue with what was likely a white head that was gone by the time I got it. Once at temp, the hop aroma was just delicious. Some mild citrus and pine with a floral backing. The flavor matched perfectly with a more intense version of the aroma, only this was balanced by some nice maltiness that did just that: balanced without taking over. Understated nicely, not lost, to let the hops serve as showcase.  Seriously, world class stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dannyboygaga,3.38,"Very dissapointing considering other reviews, too bitter, and I don't mean good bitter, bad aftertaste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dmgeng,4.75,"Got this as part of the sampler pack but having tried this before I knew it was the quintessential West-Coast IPA.  A - Bright orange color. Slight chill haze from the dry hops with a perfect white head and nice lacing.  S - Pleasant and strong hop fragrance with citrus fruit, pine, and some dankness. Just an amazing hops showcase plain and simple. If you want to be picky there maybe some malt and ale character present but only after you pry apart the aroma.  T - Great flavor with the strong citrus hop character predominant with some resin, dank, and pine notes in the middle. The hop bitterness is also present but not in contention with the citrusy hop flavor. There are also light malt and yeast character but mostly covered up by the hops. Really a delicious IPA.  M - Medium to light mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. This one is just perfect for drinking after a long day because it is very flavorful but not overwhelming in any way.  Overall, an amazing IPA. Definitely makes since why there is such a market for this beer with all of its flavor and drinkability. I would never turn this beer down whether it's 100 degrees or 10 this beer is a winner.  Glass- Tulip",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,slee196,4.2,"First time I ever tried it, I thought it was too bitter and hoppy. But that was years and years ago and I think my palate was still developing. Stone is my absolute favorite and I genuinely enjoy this classic IPA. I feel like this is honestly a well balanced, traditional IPA that packs the right amount of hop flavors and aroma. Very classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rex_4539,4.9,"This right here is the beer that made me a beer lover.  I'm surprised how cheap it is in the US.  A world-class beer, no doubt. Extremely drinkable and quite hoppy. Marvellous!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WesMantooth,4.02,"Plenty of reviews so far, so - Cliff notes review:  Deel gold. More clear than opaque.  Huge foamy off-white head. Lacing monster.  Plenty of bitter hops up front that linger throughout. Grapefruit sourness, but tastes equally like pine.  Slight resin feel. Medium bodied.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,breadwinner,4.39,"Total pillar of the style for me, perfectly exemplifying the grapefruit + pine note classic hop combo that works so well. Despite Stone's aggro marketing, this is totally approachable and even has a bit of malt sweetness to it. Everything is complementary here, even down to the perfect carb levels and body. Hope they never see fit to change the recipe on this bad boy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,JLaw55,4,"A nice standard go to IPA. Nothing that blows you out of the water, but it is nicely executed and keeps the hops front and center. A definitive example of the west coast style IPA.  Would Drink Again: Yes Would Purchase Again: Yes",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,psychoticpilgrim,4.25,"This is a true IPA. If you don't like IPA's then you will not like this beer. Some friends who claim to like IPA's have tried this and not been happy. This one separates the pretenders from the advocate. Tasty stuff, but get the Ruination for a dollar or two more",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JackRWatkins,3.5,"not gonna go into too much detail on this one, it's very interesting I tried this after having sculpin for the first time, and the bitterness was indeed refreshingly bitter as greg koch described it (not this beer specifically but craft beer in the early days as a reaction to big brew swill) in a talk he gave I found on youtube. this is a very good beer and one i can see myself going back to, it's certainly not as vicious the bottle would lead you to believe but it's a very good beer and better for being a little less bitter than described",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chainsofsilver,5,Supremely delicious and crisp! My first and favourite IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MikeViall,4,Grapefruit. Hoppy. Strong. Drinkable. First taste is light and somewhat watery but prolonged bitter aftertaste rescues it. An enjoyable IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Taybeh,4.3,"On tap at the hotel bar, into a tall pokal style glass  I've had this from bottles a number of times, but on tap, this is extra nice. There is a dank weedy hop presence on the end that I'm really grooving on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Niceroad77,4.5,"This is as close a beer I've ever tasted to my favourite IPA, Driftwood's Fat Tug. That said, it is absolutely great! Great balance between the citrus and pine aromas and flavours. Not much for tropical fruits like mango, pineapple and else. So not an easy juicy IPA by any mean. This one is for the IPA connoisseur!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Riggintrav,4.75,"One of my favorite IPAs. Has a great hoppy flavor, which is just the right bitterness. I also appreciate the label, the gargoyle is pretty BA. If you like hops, you'll like this IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Antoine,4.75,"Not to be confused with Stone's Go To IPA, this is always a go-to beer for me.  Perfect blend of bitter hops and fruity notes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TBoneJones,4.65,"Pint pour: Fairly clear, healthy golden color with done visible carbonation and a fair white head. Aroma, I pick it up from afar here. Terrific hop scent of pine and dank grapefruit. Some malt lurks beneath that as well. This is a citrus delight of a west coast ipa. I'm surprised I haven't tried it in a long while after only tasting it once prior. Now that I've sampled over a hundred varieties of ipa, I can revisit this here and appreciate the standard. Sweet and sticky grapefruit and pine resin is the impression, and the hops shine like the golden sun. Bitter big time, yet not ending as dry as many would. Creamy medium feel. Smooth drinking for all this is, which is a perfect example of a beer for those who enjoy hops without much else getting in the way. Not overly complex. Highly drinkable. Grade A stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jmac55,4.7,This beer is great. Amazing flavor with a lingering back end bitterness that seems to affect the mouth increasingly as the time between sips increases. Similar to getting out of a pool when it's cold. The flavor Keeps you coming back for more. So jump back in that water because it gets cold when you're out too long!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CalgaryFMC,4.09,"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a Lagunitas mason jar style mug (yeah, yeah, I know!). A classy light copper color with frothy beige head leaving nice rich lacing on the glass. Aroma is herbal and spicy, with some grapefruit, zesty orange, papaya, and pine undertones. Deep, rich hop flavor and a smooth, near-creamy mouthfeel. Herbal and earthy rather than aggressively fruity, although certainly there are clear citrus, peach, and pineapple notes. This fits the hop bill, heavy on Chinook and Columbus. Extremely drinkable despite the bitter resinous punch. Getting almost a cola-like brown spice in the dry herbal/woody finish. Some bready caramel malts lurk beneath the hops and this sweetness becomes more pronounced as one's tongue acclimatizes to the bitterness. Leaves a very pleasing impression of complexity and poise. Deserves its good reputation and does offer something different from other west coast IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,daveg36,1,"99? What? I love Stone beers, but hate this one. Mine is fresh according to the bottle, but WAY too grassy, and off putting. Just a nasty beer, and I don't get the fan fare with this. Where are the grapefruit, piney, citrus notes that you get in a West Coast IPA? Just completely non-existent with my particular beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,BenwayPHD,4.75,"Pours a light gold with a two finger, white head. The aroma is very hoppy. Lemon, orange juice, grapefruit, pine, sap, and a little malt sweetness. The flavor follows the nose very closely. There is a bit more of a malt presence, but that is very well balanced by the high IBUs. I've had so many IPA lately, this is better than I remembered.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Ruination and Enjoy By, on the otherhand, are 2 of my favorite beers. easily top 5 for me",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Lane_in_ID,4.7,"Look: Deep orange color, 1 finger of white head Smell: Citrus and Pine, subtle malty note Taste: Bold citrus up front, piney bitter finish.

147,88,m_hall,3.68,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic pint. Clear amber color with a thick, lingering 3 finger cream-colored head which eventually receded into a fluffy layer on top of the beer. Left abundant lacing as it was consumed  Aroma is classic IPA- pine-y hops and floral undertones, bright and invigorating.  Upfront the taste has just a quick dash of malt sweetness before that is overwhelmed by a tsunami of hops- resinous pine and grapefruit tart Cascade hops. Finish is very dry, almost astringent. The massive bitterness of the hops will linger on your palette for some time, so if tasting with other beers, I'd definitely save this one until the end.  Mouthfeel was excellently balanced- refreshing but substantial enough that you won't think you're drinking bitter water. Carbonation is on the light side.  Overall this is a prototype California-style IPA. I personally really have to be in the mood for IPA, and when I do partake I tend to prefer the east-coast styles for their more apparent malts (Dogfish Head 60-Minute, for instance.) However this beer's reputation is well deserved, and I could definitely see myself enjoying this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Chickenhawk9932,4,"Pours a pale amber with an ample white head. The head has a good retention and leaves some nice lacing.  Bright citrus and floral notes followed by a resinous pine scent in the nose.  Sweet citrus ripped away by bitter pine and bitter herb rounding back to a bread malt background with some sweet mango notes. A very aggressive and complex brew. A very solid IPA that can run with the big dogs, but is not leading the pack.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,BWED,4.03,"12 oz. bottle poured into a wine glass, how fancy! (I didn't have any of my beer glassware available to me.)  A- Somewhere between gold and brass. Half inch, foamy white head. Great lacing.  S- Sweet, fruity bread balanced with citrus, earth, and pine.  T- Pine is the prominent hop flavor in this one. Some citrus, and still a solid backbone of bready malt.  M- Medium body, carbonation is fine, and a very dry finish.  O- Delicious. This one is very well balanced, considering the roar of the hops in there. It's a classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Merzman47,4,Good India Pale Ale. Similar (I think) to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,The_Mad_Capper,4,"The aroma includes lots of fresh pine with a grassy touch; there's a twang of lemon and orange; some subtle cookie sweetness rounds it all off. The body is a somewhat hazy dull orange. Sweetness hits the tongue first but is quickly overrun with bitter, resiny hops; the hops also have a slightly fruity quality in the vicinity of peach; the 6.9% ABV is quite noticeable. Despite the level of alcohol, the finish is only somewhat dry. The mouthfeel is otherwise smooth and medium-bodied; the hop bitterness produces a slight sting.  Intense but flavorful and reasonably well balanced. The alcohol and hop qualities are slightly attenuated by some malt sweetness and smooth carbonation, but the former still verge on overwhelming.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DiggerDahl,4.25,"This may be my favorite IPA now! Stone Brewing makes some very good beers. Very assertive front taste and smooth finish. Nice golden hue coloring with very little head.

147,88,Saisons-of-the-Abyss,4.75,"This is a delicious, super smooth IPA. Very drinkable with only a little bit of bitter aftertaste. It smells and tastes pretty grapefruit-y.

Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation and good thickness. Crisp but still thick enough to feel hearty.  Overall: Solid IPA.

147,88,orangemoustache,4.5,Pour is golden with a modest touch of amber. A medium to thin head reduces at a quick pace to leave sticky lace coating the glass. The nose is robust and smells of hop and touches of citrus and earthy grasses and pine abound. Bitter hops greet the pallet as do a moderate but appreciated malt under current. This IPA is really quite gentle on the tongue which makes it quite easy to enjoy more than one. A nice dry finish rounds out this quality beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,samtrillo,3.89,"The nose is of the piney and forest like hops I've come to know and love on the west coast.  Taste keeps the hop nose very well but with a huge malt characteristic followed by a very bitter end. Honestly too much of an off putting bitterness at the finish. I can take bitter all day but this was not exactly in the right direction, and it's surprising because Stone always has a good malt backbone to balance things out.  It's still a very good IPA but of course Enjoy By and Ruination are a bit better in every way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Before trying this beer I was a fan of the Pale Ales and darks but this IPA has grown on me quickly because of its hoppiness. Very crisp on the tongue and lingers nicely. A good summer beer elsewhere but great anytime in its home town and mine. I could not give it a perfect score because I believe there is always room for improvement.

Hops is awesome and flavor is awesome with hops, and citrus and finishing with more hops and some citrusy-grapefruit finishing. Great balanced brew and one of the top 20 IPAs I have had.

Good amount of bitterness at 70+ IBU's, but so well balanced that it doesn't overpower the beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp.

147,88,anthony23cippy,3.07,"A- a medium amber color wih a .5-1 finger head AR- malty with some citrus and some pine T- same as the nose, except slightly more pronounced malt and an orange/slightly alcohol after taste M- medium bodied with a slight creamy feel O- highly overrated, just an average IPA I've has better and I've had worse",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mooseo,4.35,"12oz bottle into tulip glass.  A - Bright clear amber with a thick white head.  S - Pleasant hop aroma. Pine, tropical fruit, spicy hops.  T - Strong hop flavor and bitterness. Piney, spicy, and herbal hops. Delicious. Bready caramel malt lends a bit of sweetness.  M - Smooth, crisp, medium bodied. Somewhat creamy.  O - An all around exceptional IPA. The hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness level are all quite pleasing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Auraan,4.35,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy rich golden color with a slight orange tint and a thin cap of white foam. A very nice looking body, but a slightly disappointing head. Scents of pine resin, lemon zest, melon, earthy hops and a faint hint of biscuit on the finish. A nice overall aroma profile that is very hop forward. Flavor begins highly bitter with strong notes of pine resin and citrus peel, with a little hint of pale malt. This moves into a fairly bitter middle with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and pith, some floral and earthy hop flavors and hints of alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and a faint hint of biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is dry with Nora of pine resin and grapefruit peel, with a faint grainy flavor. There is also a very mild, though present, pale malt backbone that barely balances the bitter hop flavors. A good IPA flavor profile that fits the classic West Coast mold. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with resinous, oily slick feel with medium-low carbonation. A nice mouthfeel that keeps the overall impression light and easy to drink. Overall this is a classic example of a West Coast IPA. It doesn't do anything new or experimental, but it does provide a wonderfully hoppy and refreshing drinking experience and highlights the general strengths of Stone's recipes and brewers. Quite the nice core offering and highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MikeWard,3.86,"12oz bottle into pint glass. Enjoy by 9/9/14  re-reviewed from 11/5/11, coz I like to think I know more now. (Jury still out on that)  Golden yellow with a small white head. Good carbonation & lacing.  Not getting much of anything on the nose.  Taste was a very good blending of the hops and malt, just enough of a hop bite to let you know it's there, with a sweet malt wash throughout the mouth.  Mouth was medium with a persisting sour bitterness on the back of the mouth.  Overall, a good and tasty IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,logicalparadox,3.98,"A: hmmm. Nice head, with decent retention. Pristine copper to bronze color, with respectable lacing.  S: big hop aroma. The nose is dry and forcasts the hoppiness to come. Not very floral or piney, or even citrus, but full of hops nonetheless.a little alcohol.  T: dry as the sahara desert. No sweet maltiness here. The hoppiness and bitterness is driving this bus and we're along for the ride. Grass, pine, and pith are at the forefront, with some spices in the rear, to bring it all home. This is an IP A to please those that love IPAs.  M: light to medium, lingering, with a medium carbonation.  O: dry, bitter, and full of hoppy charachter that is quintessential of the style, without being a characiture. This is good to great, but not exceptional.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Redneckwine,4.38,"12 oz bottle into pint glass  Appearance - Hazed over and golden, nice sticky lacing left behind and solid head retention  Smell - Very grapefruity up front mingling with other various citrus notes, pine, some malty sweetness and dank fusel notes  Feel/Taste - Feel is medium bodied and super smooth, gentle carb, very drinkable. Taste follows nose - lots of hoppy grapefruit and citrus going on up front with a bitter bite that doesn't go overboard, some dank hop funk going on, trails off with a perfectly balancing caramel malt sweetness.  Overall - Just a superbly crafted IPA: a heavy dose of citrusy, fruity hops blend and balance deftly with caramely malts, while never getting the sensation of being too sweet. Extremely drinkable, this is a classic and a go-to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,porter_collie,4.47,"Served from 22 oz bottle into a pilsner glass.  A - Straw-colored, slightly hazy body. The head is thick and white. This is the way an IPA should look!  S - Orange, grass and spring flowers. Just a hint of pine and hemp.  T - Much like the smell, but more pungent. The orange and floral notes work in perfect harmony, with the semi-sweet crackery malt keeping everything in rhythm. The finish has more hoppy flavors and some assertive, but refreshing, bitterness.  M - A smooth mouthfeel to go with a medium body. Carbonation is near perfect.  O - A fantastic IPA. When enjoyed fresh, it's one of the best widely-distributed single IPAs around. If the six-pack weren't $12, this would be my go-to beer without a doubt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Phigg1102,4.51,Very clear orange color with a thin head of foam. Grapefruit zest and something really earthy in the aroma. The taste has tons of floral character and a crisp bitter finish.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BEERchitect,4.28,"There may be no other IPA that so confidently displays what it means to be ""west coast"". Its premier and dedicated focus on hop bitterness is supported by the perfect type of barley malt- the nonexistent type!  Its nose-piercing scent of hops take center stage with the strong presence of white grapefruit, tangy orange peel, fresh-cut grass and an overall aura of resinous pine. And upon the first drink, the mouth dries and waters at the same time; contending with the full brunt of hop flavor and yearning for refreshment.  The middle offers up a malty-dry taste and texture that's of faint caramel and thin honey, but with a wafer-thin light bread texture. As the palate acclimates to the tongue-sweating hop dominance, its floral and fruity periphery show fleeting glimpses.  As the bottom falls out of the malts, its sweetness recedes quickly and allows the hops to develop into a smoothly resinous bittering, that intensifies to the proportions of freshly torn pine needles, bark and sap. Still, its pithy citrus sharpness ensures a high level of refreshment and drinkability as the ale concludes with resolute dryness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AyeMito,4.71,"To me, this is what IPAs are all about! Poured heavy into a pint glass from a bottle, it looks wonderful with a deep golden/ amber color. It also has a nice thick foamy head. It has a sweet grassy smell with a slight hint of citrus. The taste is absolutely wonderful! Its smooth and fresh with a crisp bite and smooth notes of pine and citrus. I love how well everything is blended together and lays out perfectly. Truly a world class IPA! Without a doubt one of my new favorites!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BreakfastStout,4.54,"Damn, what a nice beer! Reminds me of a slightly less hoppy Two Hearted Ale. I could drink this one all night.  Aggressively poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Sticky lacing stays on the glass throughout. Subtle hops on the nose with mild pine behind. Taste? This is where this baby really shines! Smooth drinking IPA, but hops are still present. Far too many IPA’s today lack the subtle balance that Stone delivers with this beer. Love it. Mouth feel is nothing but smooth easy drinking.  Overall? I’m an IPA and IIPA snob and this one moves into my top five, right behind Pliny & Two Heart!  Kudos Stone! Hell yes!!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gear54,4.47,From a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Enjoy by 8/1714 is the date on the bottle  A: Gold color with about 1/3 inch head that grips the glass. Not a superb pour but that's most likely my fault. I can see the carbonation rising from bottom to top. It looks awesome.  S: Mostly citrus and some earthy notes  T: Wow! I'm a huge IPA fan so that wow is completely biased. Taste exactly as it smells. Citrus and pine on the front with lasting hops got several seconds afterward.  M: Not as heavy as I had expected but it coats really well.  O: worth every cent. A complete drinking experiance,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PaulyB83,4.08,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Enjoy by 08/17/14  A- Pours a medium gold with medium high white head. Slightly hazy.  S- Pine, dank, grapefruit, orange.  T- Similar to aroma dank pine and grapefruit and orange notes. Finishes pretty dry with lots of pine. A malt presence that I didn't really get in the aroma. The bitterness is right on.  M- Medium, pretty easy drinking and refreshing.  O- For a while I didn't like IPAs and this is the first one that really connected with me and I haven't been back since. Now that my palate is used to hops and I know what the a lot of different varieties taste like, I'd have to say that I would like a bit more Centennial in the recipe but this is still a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MisSigsFan,4.2,"First had on-tap in a pint glass. Pours a nice golden color with thin white head. Perfect lacing. Right away you can smell an almost overwhelming amount of pine, which is at the forefront of both the smell and taste. At first, the bitterness can be a bit much, but the flavor just takes over so wonderfully. Very piney flavor with just a hint of wheat at the last second. This is honestly one of the smoothest tasting, if not THE smoothest tasting, IPAs I've ever had. Even if you're not a fan of IPAs this is a must have.  Re-review: Out of a bottle. Smell is piney and citrusy. Taste is grapefruit and pine. The bitterness is balanced out nicely with bready malts. Not as bitter as I remember it. The taste seems subdued as well. Not as piney as I thought it was. I had this not too long ago and thought it was as good as ever, but for some reason it just doesn't live up to what I remember. I'm not sure if it's a bad batch or my palate has just evolved a lot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: in this order: lemon, floral hops, onion, spices, earthy pine  T: sweet candied fruits with a spicy pepper to it upfront, which is replaced by an extremely bitter, spicy finish; i can feel the hop's oils stuck on my tongue on a lengthy finish.  M: creamy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation.  O: not my style, but i didn't hate it. The hops are a little much, but i like the spicy, sweet notes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mikus,4.24,"Delicious, fresh IPA on resident tap at the Brick Wall Tavern in Asbury Park. Juicy, fresh West Coast style. Clear to see why this is a standard. Bright citrus on the nose and palate. Too easy to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pjbfromkc,4.29,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into pint glass. No head and little carbonation. You can definitely smell the hops. Taste is an immediate rush of hops, but smooth. Well balanced at 6.9 abv. This is a very drinkable west coast ipa, one of the best. That being said, there a very similar ipas readily availabe in most stores in kc that are more affordable and just as good in quality. This is a great ipa though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,leantom,4.36,"Ah, got to drink one of my old favorites the other day. Now I'll be able to review it. Here goes:  A: Very good. A clear yellow; I can see through the glass perfectly. The beer also pours an ample head (not too big or small) with adequate lacing. Carbonation is superb, too.  S: Again, very good. The smell is not too overbearing, as is the case in many West-Coast IPA's. Has a good balance of grapefruit, lemon, orange and lighter spices. Not much of a malt character, but this is to be expected in any WC IPA.  T: Beautiful. Brings back a lot of great memories. This was one of my first IPA's, and the taste is still consistently good to this day. The taste follows the nose, i.e., lots of lemon, grapefruit, oranges and pine. The beer is also quite balanced for a WC IPA. You don't feel like you're being overwhelmed with hops as you drink it, and it doesn't leave any of that bitter taste in your mouth that's so typical of beers of this style.  M: Excellent. Lots of carbonation, but the beers slides down the throat quickly. Very light on the palate, but not too light; just right.  O: A great take on the WC IPA. A beer to enjoy again and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ciocanelu,3.7,"Berlin version from a can. Clear, golden color with white head. Aroma has grassy and dank hops and citrus fruits. Taste follows with the same hoppy notes but the malts seem a bit off, somehow too grainy for an IPA. Finish is quite bitter with intense grapefruit flavor. Medium to light body with medium carbonation. It has some really nice hoppy notes but there’s something wrong with the malt backbone. 3.85/5. Escondido version from a bottle. Clear, golden color with white head. Not as aromatic as the Berlin version. More generic, floral hops. Taste is also somehow more bland. There is a generic bitterness with some earthy hops but not really fruity or floral. Medium to light body with medium carbonation. This one is quite boring, I am disappointed. 3.5/5 Average for both versions: 3.7/5",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,greentam2,4.51,"I heavily favored torpedo for my stand-by extra ipa, but this stone product has all the qualities that I have found in torpedo, with an added little spiciness of mild cloves on the front end of the taste that lingers into the middle sipping of the sound hop base.

T: Pine citrus, malts, onion, light orange candy, solid bitterness that lingers on the tongue.  M: Medium body, medium fine bubbled carbonation, smooth, slightly resinous finish.

147,88,DavidLosAngeles323,4.88,"Stone ipa is a house hold name. It is simply great, I've had exclusive brews, seasonal brews, and this india ale is simply one of the best they have to offer. It tastes a lot better than their other brews. It is perfected with the right amount of hops and is a bit harsh for the normal drinker. Though this specific brew is a lot lighter than its brothers. It is not to be taking lightly this is a strong beer flavorful with dark citrus and coffee residue. It is a must try by anyone and a regular basis drink in the household.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TexasRedskinFan,3.75,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into an everyday drinking glass. A- My extreme aggro pour eventually produced about a quarter inch of the thickest egg white consistency head I've seen in a long time. Looks like beaten egg whites. Pours an orange, gold, slightly hazy beauty.  S- Honestly it didn't smell too fantastic. The bottle I got was about 3 months out of code so it might have been off. But this smelled like a Budweiser. SorryT  T- This tasted like an IPA for the masses. Like an ""all day IPA"" or a watered down Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It tastes delicious, hoppy and bright. Nice sweet malt to balance it out and bring it home. But maybe I've been enjoying too many insane IPAs lately but this was kinda AAL style or something. It tastes great. But its definitely not as pungent as some other nice brews.  M- Mouthfeel was watery. Under carbonated and thin.  O- I find it hard to believe this is a ""World Class Beer"". Its good. Damn good. But so short of its full potential. I had a Stone IPA about 4 years ago in the hot Houston summer. I remember it being very flavourful and refreshing. Now it just seems watery.

The flavor likewise has a solid malt backbone, but the powerful bitterness dominates, albeit without being over-the-top abrasive. The mouthfeel is resinous, but the beer is still tremendously drinkable. Overall, this is one of the beers that I think exemplifies the prototypical West-coast IPA.

I often drink IPA's from the bottle, but this one is absolutely better in a glass.  Feel is better than most IPA's- IMO. It doesn't develop a shitty, dry sourness that some IPA's get as they warm up a bit.  Basically, I always have some on hand. You don't have to look hard for the stuff, it's not expensive and everyone likes it.

No way in hell they would drink my specific bottles of this and agree that it is world class.  WOW, I have had this beer before and it was decent then, but this time when I am reviewing it, it is horrible. Way too grassy for me, and not alot of pine and citrus that seems to characterize some of the other Stone's. Maybe it is a bad batch? I tossed the rest of the 6 pack out after I drained poured this one. I don't get it, this doesn't seem to have any hops at all.. Bottle date says to drink by 8/18/2014. It is June, so lack of freshness certainly isn't an excuse. What I got here is just completely uneventful and disappointing.  I found the hop characteristics that epitomize Stone beers to be completely non-existent with this specific 6 pack. I actually did a drain pour with a Stone beer (go figure) and am saving for the Sculpin IPA bomber I picked up at Whole Foods. I really dislike this beer.

147,88,humuloner22,4.45,"This is a hop bomb. Stone is becoming one of my favorite breweries and my only complaint is that they only bottle. Cans, guys do some cans.  I have had several lately from Stone and look forward to trying more of their lineup. Although I am not really a stout person I may have to give that one a go as well. The price is always dead on for what you get. Which is a plus. I understand the bottle, I swear I used to prefer bottles over cans, but the new canning techniques make it taste so much fresher. I do like how they put an etched label on so you can stick some in a cooler without getting that nasty label glue melted ice mix.  Appearance: Some reddish straw color, nice IPA coloring. Head was about in line with the Enjoy by I had recently, frothed up for a minute or two but settled into a nice lacing pattern.  Smell: Oh this is where they get you. These guys like hops and make sure you know they do. Piney, floral with some tropical fruits in there. A well balanced aroma.  Taste: I just think this beer is amazing, and for the price its a steal. I just purchased a bomber but for $4.50 I believe that is amazing that they can produce such quality at such a reasonable price. It was hop forward assertive and kind of dank, but had a nice floral balance to go along with the bitterness. I really enjoyed this one. My hats are off to the guys a Stone.

147,88,Tsar_Riga,4.27,"A - This beer pours up golden copper, nearly clear. White head, dense bubbles that pillow out to a thin layer, with extravagant lacing. A beautiful pour indeed.  S - Bright citrus notes, heavier toward lemon and orange, with pine resin, and a slight pepper and grass close.  T - Following the nose, with big lemon and orange zest, leading into citrus flesh as the sweetness of the malts links up. The pine and resin comes out in the middle, and it runs into the close, where the bitterness swells and holds for a while after the swallow. Along with the bitter, there are hints of pepper spiciness and sour lemon.  M - Light, but with a chewy back-end and considerable building dryness. This is not a gentle IPA - it gets in there to do some damage.  O - This is one I've been meaning to try, but it wasn't until the 4-bottle box, when I got a couple along with all the other options (all of which I've bought separately), that I finally tried one.

Smell- Tropical notes of orange and pineapple. Quite floral as well.  Taste- Pine and grass notes up front blending quickly into a biscuit malt flavor. The earthy hop finish is pronounced. The bitterness lasts awile for a dry hop wrap up.  Mouthfeel- Slick and moderate in body. Not thin. Ample carbonation.  Overall- An IPA that is very solid. A fine creation of the style indeed.

I have no complaints though, all the tastes cling to your mouth. A medium body IPA. At the end a piney bitterness lingers.  Overall a great IPA. I misjudged this one at first.

147,88,CTbrew32,4.12,"This beer pours a deep golden amber color with barely a finger of head. The aroma is amazing with a big burst of pine and citrus. This was one of my first ipas ever about a year ago, and it was extremely bitter. After a year of letting ipas wreck my palate this still packs a punch, but it is a much more enjoyable bitterness. Honestly I wish more ipas were still this bitter to me. Besides the bitterness the taste overall is amazing with citrus, bready/caramel malt, and BIG pine which helps amplify the bitterness. Overall, this is a great ipa and one that got me into loving the style. This is the perfect beer for the ipa lover, but if your new to the style the bitterness could be overwhelming.

147,88,ssteakley,3.78,"Difficult one for me, I have become accustomed to PNW brews and this hangs way over on the citrusy side, from the aroma to the taste I just live n a different part of the world I bought this due to the BA rating so I respect where it comes from but there are just to many better options so I will not return to this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MaineBrewing,4.25,"Decided to do a ruination and stone IPA vertical. I have always had these on separate occasions and failed to really noticed much difference. I was quite wrong.  A - poured a slightly hazy golden orange with one finger frothy head, nice cap of foam remained, and a little lacing.  S - pungent piney nose, bright citrus, almost lemony. Cereal malt notes round it out, slight grain character.  T - hop nose carries over to the taste, very piney resinous and lemony citrus. Very crisp malt character provides a great balance. Finishes with ample hop bitterness, very dry and clean.  M - on the thin side body wise but still has some stickiness, well attenuated and crisp.  O - overall this is a great American IPA, great hop flavor and balance with a nice crisp dry finish. Regarding my verticle with ruination, this doesn't have nearly the hop flavor, or malt sweetness, but provides a little more balance, certainty two very different beers as this is more lighter and crisp.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,itsscience,4.35,"Cloudy light copper with a finger of soapy head that sticks around. Classic IPA smell: A flowery aroma with some grapefruit, orange, lemon zest, and clean crackery malt. Stone touts on the label, ""to say that this gem of an IPA is 'hoppy' would be putting it modestly."" Maybe that was true with this beer debuted, but to the modern palate, the hop level here is manageable if not average. That's a good thing for those of us who like balance in a hoppy beer. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a citrusy payload, a neutralizing malt backbone, and an oniony, earthy character that lingers in the background. I think one of the most underrated aspects of drinking beer is the aftertaste you get when you breathe out through your nose after a glass, and Stone IPA is the best beer I know of when it comes to these bonus flavors: it has a nice herbal and flowery aftertaste. Overall it's my favorite of the Stone offerings that I've tried.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Hops are not overwhelming at all, but still very flavorful. No hint of alcohol.  M: I really like how this feels. Thick, rich and smooth. Doesn't feel watery. Very full and fulfilling feel on the palate.  O: Stone continues to impress me. This is an outstanding and easy to drink IPA. Very similar to the Enjoy By IPA I recently had but lacks the overall freshness, but to be expected.

Appearance - Very nice, clear amber. Lacing is outstanding.  Nose - The nose is not powerful, but does bring up a nice light grapefruit/pine/resin scent.  Taste - Yummy. Not thick and or over the top; but rather a perfect balance. Ruby Red grapefruit juice, pine resin, yummy sweet malt.  Finish - perfect. Bitter, long lasting, citrus sour.  This is truly a world class beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,arc0042,4.31,"This is a solid West Coast IPA, and easily one of my top 10 IPA's.  The malt bill is rather subtle, but definitely proficient enough. I would describe it as a wonderfully crafted loaf of bread, with hints of brown sugar and caramel. It isn't deep at all, leaving a crisp, not overwhelming taste of just absolutely wonderful malts on the tongue. I wouldn't consider this malt bill aggressive at all, but as I said it is definitely proficient.  Stone absolutely nailed the hop bill on this beer. When they state that both bittering hops and aroma/flavor hops are well balanced, they are 100% stating the truth. The fresher you get this beer (always check the best by date), the more pronounced the bittering hops will be. If you get an older batch of this beer, the bittering hops probably have settled and you will be left with a sweeter IPA (which some people like). This last batch I got however is dated best by 05/04/14, and it is 02/26/14. I would consider this rather fresh, but not as fresh as I would like.  I've tried probably close to 20 6-packs of this beer, so I feel as if I'm rather qualified to rate it. The hop profile is rather complex....I see that a lot of people describe the hop profile as ""citrusy"", but honestly that isn't what first comes to my mind. The forward hop flavor in this beer, to me at least, is a variety that is PUNGENT in humulene and low in alpha acids (such as a noble hop). I'm rather sure they don't use noble hops for this beer, but that is what the flavor reminds me of, which leads me to believe the primary flavoring hop is rather low in alpha acids and high in beta acids, particularly humelene and myrcene. With this being said, I do taste a slight citrus note, but it isn't the predominant flavor. It is a rather bitter grapefruit/mango/papaya type flavor. The dominant hop flavor I get from this beer is that of an herbal variety. I mean very herbal, almost like a lemon thyme/rosemary/spearmint flavor. Either way, I fully approve of this hop profile. The bittering hops and flavor/aroma hops they chose beautifully compliment each other, making this one of my favorite IPA's.  I don't describe the pour of this beer because I don't pour IPA's. I think that the carbonation snap that is achieved directly from a bottle is essential in a proper tasting. Pouring these beers releases important volatile essential oils into the air, many of which are important to the final characteristics of the beer.  Cheers people!!! This one gets an easy 4.5/5, and that is being stingy!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PBIU,4.48,"Stone first came to Chicagoland in the Spring of 2010.  This was about the time I was beginning to expand my craft beer horizons and Stone was a great brewery to dive into.  Not quite sure why some video reviewers knock on this IPA (thinking Better Beer Authority) here. Although those guys are a bit goofy at times and I find myself disagreeing with them about 80% of the time.  So here is the review. Had this beer on-tap from my basement kegerator (many more pints to come).  Appearance is a bit orange with a nice bright look. Nice lacing on the glass when swirled and about a two finger head.  Smell is citrus focused with a bit of carmel malt at the tail end.  Taste is very smooth. Well balanced play with the hops and malt here where one does not overpower the other. Dry finish. Typical West Coast IPA taste and from the guys that really invented the San Diego IPA style in the 90s.  Mouthfeel is not what you would think with this. Coming in at 6.9% one would think a heavier syrupy mouthfeel would be present. Stone IPA is light and smooth. Some may say a bit watery for the style, but I think it works well with this offering.  Overall just a good solid beer. Stone delivers and I can see why they have such a cult following.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bone53,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass at around 45°F  Appearance: Golden copper with a one finger off white head that dissipates quickly.  Smell: Funky hop extraction and mild pepper in the nose, and at that moment I knew that this wouldn't be the IPA for me  Taste: Syrupy hop extraction and a hint of malts with the pepper that puts me off.  Mouthfeel: Goes down smooth with subtle bitterness.  Overall: Did I get a bad batch? Coming from Stone, I was underwhelmed to say the least",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bouleboubier,3.59,"A West Coast IPA whose magnificence I certainly must not understand.  The hops are of a blend of fresh-cut grass, holiday wreath, and green onions. A modicum of sweet malt combines with additional hop flavors to create a mild, sweet orange-creme nuance. The chlorophyll-leafy and green onion-like pungency and bitterness has always turned me off enough with Stone's beers not to have any urge to order a pint or buy a bottle. Some of their darker beers exhibit these qualities, but a couple actually taste pretty good. I'm seriously going to have to find out which of the hops they use offends me. Or is it the yeast? It bugs me, because a lot of people love their beers.... Then again, none of their beers below 6% abv score above 4 on here. Maybe there's my answer... Gonna see what Levitation has to offer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Johnny_Muir,4.55,"12 oz into tulip glass. I had heard so many good things about Stone, and this being my first beer of theirs, I was not disappointed!

147,88,eclipse54,3.8,"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at the local as a single - realized I never wrote a review for this one and wanted to correct that oversight. Into the tulip it goes.  A tangerine colored body with a finger’s breadth of fluffy white head comprised of various sizes of bubbles. Average retention and generous wet lacing. Aroma is of pine, citrus (orange and lemon with a dash of grapefruit), grass, and a bit of caramel malt (hint of age on the bottle, I suppose). Flavor draws a bit more malt, but still generous doses of lemon, grapefruit, and pine up front. Bitter, earthen hops dominate the middle and finish. Lively body with perfect carbonation, dry, bitter finish. Overall, a well balanced IPA that is a great example of the style. I do wish Stone had a more robust bottle dating system (the date was wiped off this bottle), but it’s still fresh enough to be enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Boca-X,3.84,"Poured from a bomber into a Sin City Brewing Co (Nevada) pint glass. Light head, faded fast, light lacing, lasted throughout drink. Golden, honey orange...a little cloudy to the eyes.  Slight hops on the nose, orange, grapefruit, lemon, pine...what you would expect from an IPA.  Mellow pine, citrus...a hint of candy cane and dark/burnt coco on the front of the tongue. Extremely smooth. The finish tastes of bitter lazy grapefruit. Bitter finish is fast, then gone...probably why so many people like it?  I've had the Bastard and thought it was very good. This is extremely balanced and smooth, making it very drinkable, if you enjoy IPAs you'll like this. Honestly, it isn't much different from lots of very good beers in this style? I will drink again...it's good...close to great...but...?  I'll come back to it and review it again in the summer...maybe the change in weather will help? I must say I've been drinking a lot of very hoppy IPAs lately, so my buds are all juiced up!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste: smooth but not subtle spicey and piney hop, a bit of malt backing up the hop notes  Mouthfeel: medium body, medium carbonation, crisp, slightly dry in the finish.  Overall: if you want an IPA, and only a classical, crisp beer that is everything you think of when you think IPA will do, buy this beer",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,lochef81,4.38,"As a huge fan of all of Stones offerings, I am finally getting around to tasting one of their simpler, less in your face ales. Pours a handsome hazy orange with almost notes of green in the light with a slight white head and substantial lacing. The nose is somewhat subtle for a west coast ipa. Floral and citrus hops, some pine and a little malt. It definitely smells very fresh and lively. The flavor is perfect west coast ipa. Bitter and hoppy, tons of pine and citrus. Just a little malt to offset the bitter but not so much to take away from the fresh flavors of the hops. The mouth is light and easy drinking. A little dry on the finish but in the best way. This is the benchmark for west coast ipas. If they all tasted like this the world would be a better place.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,ONovoMexicano,4.06,"Poured into a pint glass from a twelve ounce bottle.  A great appearance to start, with a finger-thick head that's both frothy and chewy-looking. As the head dissipates, it leaves lots of sticky lacing, but some head persists and remains above the liquid. The liquid is golden with amber hues and shows some moderate carbonation. The beer looks filtered, yet still slightly cloudy.  I get lots of citrus on the nose with hints of pine. The beer smells sweet and semi-malty as well. Almost smells like there's an orange just sitting in there.  The taste follows the nose pretty faithfully. The beer is citrusy and bready. I get a lot of grapefruit peel. There's not as much flavor complexity as I'd expect, but this may have to do with freshness.  This beer is crisp, light and easy-drinking for an IPA. There is an intensely dry and bitter finish, but the beer starts creamier and with a thick mouthfeel. Very impressive in this regard.  Overall, a delicious IPA and one easily accessible. Of course, I have La Cumbre Elevated at my disposal so that one will always have my heart.

147,88,macher0,4.41,I'm finally getting around to reviewing this beast.  Expiration date of 2.14.14  A. Medium copper color. Poured a one finger egg shell head. Fine bubble and frothy carbonation. Steady updraft of effervescance. Mega laces.  S. Light fragrance. Mostly pine from the hops and light malts.  T. Moderately bitter. A strong hop profile. Mostly pine flavors but some citrus grapefruit. An excellent balance. Minor biscuit notes. Peppery.  M. Very smooth. High carbonation. Light body. A very pleasant tingle from the freshness.  O. This is a very well crafted ale. I assume this beer falls off as it ages so I'm fortunate to review it while fresh. I greatly enjoy the peppery tingle from a fresh ipa. An excellent balance of pine and citrus notes from the hops. I don't enjoy hop bombs so this is right up my alley. Not overly aggressive but a decent amount of bitterness.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A - Pours a nice bright coppery orange colored body with two fingers of fluffy doughy off-white head. Some nice thin scattered lacing. Looks very nice.  S - Smell is of big fruity hop bitterness - grapefruit, mango, blood oranges. A hint of biscuit malt and some crisp yeast. Floral and tropical smelling. A hint of soapiness.  T - Taste follows the nose: well balanced caramel / biscuit malts paired with resinous pine, grapefruit, blood orange hoppiness. Creamy; slightly soapy. Delicious, and extremely drinkable at 6.90% abv.  M - Feel is smooth and creamy, medium bodied with good carbonation. Some sticky resinous pine and dry bready malt on the palate.  Overall, it is all around drinkable, and delicious. I can definitely say I think much more highly of this beer now than when I reviewed it sometime last year. I can safely say that this is a pinnacle IPA right here. Stone may go over the top oftentimes, but this beer still ranks with the best of them.

147,88,jwhancher,4.77,"Bought a 6-pack at Total Wine earlier this month. Enjoy by date is a little smeared but it's still well within the suggested timeframe. Poured into my Dogfish IPA glass for review.  Light copper color with fluffy white head, nice carbonation and a tad of sediment which renders the beer somewhat hazy. Smells fantastic with pungent piney hops, whiffs of papaya & mango, maybe some orange and pineapple.  Tastes overwhelmingly hoppy with sweet tropical fruit flavors then a burst of hop bitterness. Piney & citrus resins linger and coat the tongue wonderfully. Definitely a true West Coast style IPA.  Mouthfeel feels light to medium bodied. Think the hop resins make it perceivable more full bodied but this beer is definitely extremely drinkable and a wonderful thirst quencher. No astringency from the amped up bitterness rate. Alcohol well in check and carbonation is fine.  A damn fine IPA overall. I love that Stone prints the Enjoy By dates on their bottles. As a conscious shopper, I like knowing how fresh my hoppy beers truly are after being burned one too many times. This just adds more appeal to Stone's beers.

147,88,CDBeerDisappear,4.5,"Look: Clear (I personally prefer the look of a clear beer over hazy, probably because I am old) amber gold with tons of of creamy fine bubbled foam. Bubbles are visible rising at medium speed. Head is more dependent on the glass you pour it into than of the beer itself. Smell: Aroma of big pine and biscuit malt. Taste: There is the tiniest bit of sweet on the tip of the tongue followed by a massive hit of pine bitterness. The piney bitter taste is what you buy this beer for. There is citrus in there too, especially grapefruit. Feel: Nice full mouthfeel. Carbonation is slightly prickly. Clean finish and Overall: This beer and Bell’s Two Hearted were my first introduction to IPA’s and they won me over. Love at first sip. The taste has held up over the years and now this is a classic IPA. Archetypal West Coast bitter IPA. This beer is good if you are taking your time to really enjoy a classic West Coast IPA, but it is also quite good to just drink one after another. One of my all-time favorites. This was canned 3 months ago and tastes very fresh.  I used to drink this a lot but then I went chasing after every new thing that came along (nothing wrong with that, of course) but It is nice to come back to this and find it is every bit as good as I remember. It's like meeting an old friend at a class reunion and your friendship picks up right where it left off. It's a BIG beer. There is a lot of malt in it, you don't get 6.9% alcohol by skimping on the grains. And it is hoppy as hell! Big, big hop flavor. I need to be whacked in the head by flavor and this beer delivers. I was drinking a lot of European beers in the 80's and 90's because American beer was, well, embarrassing. When I tried this - WOW- I never looked back. I don't drink nearly as much European beer now and I am PROUD of American beer. Thanks Stone! I'm a fan for life.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Caj1,4.28,"I'm tired of drinking stouts, porters and various spiced, sometimes far, FAR overspiced Autumn and Winter beer types, so I decided to ditch the sweater and the liquid bread and go with something a little bit lighter and fruitier this time around (if I have to drink another damn ""pumpkin"" beer I'm going to puke.) Having had the Arrogant Bastard Ale before (which is damn good in case you weren't aware) I'm going with the Stone IPA.  Bought in a six-pack with the iconic gargoyle printed on the front (thanks for keeping us and the brew safe, ol' pal) this pours a beautiful gold with just a hint of copper-amber to let you know that you aren't just drinking swill. I really can't emphasize enough how crystal-clear and pretty this beer looks. Lots of carbonation, a decent two fingers of head which dissipates into a lacing that covers fully the head of the beer and sticks quite well to the side of the glass.  Smell is standard IPA fare (but in a good way) with a lot of variety between grass and citrus notes, pine-needles and nice esters. Taste is some heavy hops punching you directly in the nose and mouth that as the flavor mellows strikes a nice balance between the malt and the hops. This is crisp, refreshing, slightly bitter but also delicately balanced and a tiny bit sweet, and overall is exactly what I would expect from the folks at Stone. One last note: the 6.9 percent ABV will leave you with a nice little buzz after finishing a glass or three.  So, of all the IPAs I've had so far, this one is particularly hard to beat and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Probably the only beer that comes close so far is the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which is also quite nice. IPA fans should already have had this beer. If you haven't, you're missing out. Anybody else who hasn't had this beer is also missing out. Just try it.  Cheers, to good health and good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sugar cookie up front with lime, candied grapefruit, pine needle and fresh crystally oil. Lemonhedz finish and loong aspirin linger. Crisp, halfway between light + medium, slight cling.  Light, lean, fresh, and bright - just enough malt to hold it up yet sparkles of sugar popping through to keep things light, great brightness to the citrus, firm bitterness that doesn't hint at 77 IBUs- so many things to like about this beer. Like Ruination with all the potentially alienating qualities toned down. Funny how, as an old school recipe (1997) it reminds me of another 90s IPA, Goose Island, in the lime sherbet feel.

147,88,ThePaintedGrey,4.49,"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Clear and pristine, but not transparent. A glorious amber color with a thick, creamy white head that eventually dwindles down to a frothy cap, leaving sticky white lace down the glass. I could have done with more lacing, but it's not enough to subtract from the score.  S: Hops galore! Definitely lots of floral hops, with a little pint of pine. A little bit of citric zest peering through, but this one is almost exclusively herbal and floral hops. Very rustic. I wouldn't mind having this scent in a candle!  T: Herbal and floral hops, and LOTS of them. Those pine notes that I detected in the nose come through with some fresh-squeezed grapefruit. Tons of bitterness throughout, but it never becomes too pungent. A little bit of alcohol spice in the finish, but other than that, this one lets the hops do the talking.  M: Oh my goodness, this one is smooth, creamy, full-bodied, a bit on the thick side... Everything I look for in a mouthfeel, essentially. This one would have gotten close to a perfect marking in this area, but I did find the carbonation to pack a little too much of a bite. Other than that, this is a flawless drinking brew.  O: Man, oh man... I'm a fan of dark brews, but this one has my palette-preferences playing tug-o-war! This is without a doubt one of the finest, easiest-drinking IPAs that has ever graced my mouth. My wallet is currently shuddering at the thought of how many sixers of this I'll be buying in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bubseymour,4.16,Bottled in June 2016 with best by date of 9/24/16. Extremely fresh.  Supposedly the IPA was reformulated recently and was told by Stone reps. that this should be the 1.1 version despite the same labeling still being used. Not sure this is accurate as I'm still getting a strong amount of the west coast pine and missing the juicy smoothness from the additional hops that were supposedly added. I honestly can't taste anything new here from the original (if this is actually reformulated). Solid IPA for west coast hop heads. But not quite my favorite style of IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,slusk,4.38,"A: This IPA pours a 1 finger white head that dissipates to a thin long standing froth. Very nice lacing and a golden to light amber color. Somewhat clear but not crystal. A slight bit of turbidity.  S: This beer reminds me of the smell I get just as I toss my bittering hops into the boil of a batch of wort. An immediately intense hoppy aroma. Nice citrusy, spiciness with beautiful grapefruit character. A very fresh hoppy extravaganza. All the while, the malt sweetness fills in the background.  T: The first thing that you taste is the sweetness of the malt as it rolls across the tongue, quickly followed by a slight acidity from what I feel are the salt additions you would expect in an IPA and the bitter bite from the hops. The sweetness lives on the tongue as the hoppy goodness fills the nose with a complex taste experience. I like that the hops don't attack you too quickly allowing you to enjoy a glimpse of malty goodness, a hallmark of Stone's IPA's in my opinion. After a few seconds you get a moderate bitterness that lingers but in a good way.  M: moderate mouthfeel with a borderline slick feel that probably comes from an abundance of hop resins.  O: A beautiful creation that allows you to find the malt sweetness without missing the hoppy goodness. For me, this beer is a great choice for those who don't consider themselves 'hopheads' . It is definitely a hop forward libation but it gives you a glimpse of the underlying grains that are the groundwork of a good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jj139,4.68,"Enjoyed in a pint glass  A - Hazy amber color, eggshell 2 finger head and long lasting lacing.  S - Piney hops with citrus/grapefruit notes  T - Big hops right off the bat then the citrus kicks in. Hints of malt in there as well.  M - Medium body and carbonation.

147,88,Glennlawless,3.72,"Poured into a signature Stone IPA Pint Glass.  A - Poured a nice golden color with a creamy like centimeter head. Getting some nice lacing as well.  S - Grapefruit and sweet malt. As it warms the fresh fragrant hop smell fades and the sweetness really punches through more.  T/M -Very first thing that hit me was the sweetness of the malt then shortly after came that juicy citrus feel - Tons of grapefruit and tropical like fruit going on. Also picking up orange. Leaves with a super grape-fruity-pine blast but not one that is overbearing.bitterness definitely sticks around a while...really nice. This is my type of IPA for sure.  Overall, this is a fantastic beer put out by stone( as usual) and is always a constant in my fridge... Reminds me of Ballast Points ""Sculpin IPA"" but just a tad more bitter. Its the perfect example of a west coast hop bomb. Really glad im able to get this year round as well.

Golden-orange color that almost glows, a solid two-finger head and light carbonation bubbles S: When I think IPA this is exactly what I smell. Hop-forward, mostly pine but some grapefruit as well, and a nice malt backbone with a hint of caramel T: Also hop-forward with nice balance of the pine & grapefruit, fresh malt & a bit of caramel on the midpalate then a lovely spice-floral finish that lasts quite some time M: Tastes fresh. Medium-bodied but bold, again a pleasantly long finish O: One of the hoppier IPAs out there then again this is Stone; it almost tastes like a DIPA but not quite as much alcohol which lets the flavors show more on their own.

T - Very subtle all the way around. Piney, fruity, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, everything in this is very subtle and balanced.  M - Light body, carbonation is pretty prominent, drinkable, a bread dryness that is inviting for the next drink.  O - Given the style in mind, Stone knocks this out of the park. I'm use to heavier IPAs at this point and I had to keep reminding myself of that during this review. I really like their lineup and this is a great start to the world of craft beer.

147,88,HighGravityMan,4.64,"A - Pours nicely into a glass that showcases the thick, white head and amber color. Head retention is excellent with some cracking visible after a while. Good lacing.  S - I could basque in the beautiful scent of this beer for eternity. The floral, fruity, piney hop nose tantalizes me. This is God's perfume. Clearly some high quality hoppage.  T - Such an introduction is hard to follow. The hoppy bitterness kicks like nobody's business and is shortly followed by the dry hop and malt flavors promised by the aroma and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The taste is best described as a whirlwind fugue of fruit and ester and pine and floral with a slight malt undertone. Every sip is excellent and the flavors further open up as the beer warms.  M - Slick, thick, carbonated to perfection. This feels right, somehow.  You ever try a beer and then dream about it and crave it? That is this beer for me right now. It has opened my eyes to the beauty of hoppy character. Well-balanced and totally worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very impressive for a standard line-up IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheDoctor,4.27,"A: Pours a crystal clear, orange-tinged straw with a big pristine white head that settles down to a nice inch-plus cap of foam with a constant stream of champagne-like carbonation shooting up from the base of my tulip. Great retention; beautiful gloppy lacing. Nearly perfect.  S: Crisp and cool, a bit sweet at the beginning and pretty bready throughout. Rich cereals and a touch of warm malt but citrusy hops are the predominate aroma I detect. Very good.  T: Dry and bitter with a lingering medicinal twang in the back of the throat. Pepper, oats, grass, hops, orange rind.  M: Clean and bubbly. Good strong carbonation, light-medium body, lingering bitter finish/aftertaste.  O: Excellent IPA! Gorgeous to look at, the smell is probably the weakest point of this beer and even it is quite nice and very subdued. The hop flavors are relatively one-note, but they are quite good and manage to dominate the beer without overpowering you. The aroma is much maltier than the taste is; however even the taste has some very strong cereal flavors which kind of form a nice backdrop for the medicinal hop notes at the end.

147,88,Stevedore,3.46,"12oz bottle, enjoy by date of 12/23/2013, poured into an unlabeled snifter today, 11/15/2013.  Review #288.  Pours a fairly clear golden-brown body with a decent 1cm white head that dissipates fairly quickly, not much retention. Some lacing. Standard IPA appearance.  Smells fairly hoppy. Some pine and a bit of grapefruit, predominantly pine. Some biscuits and crackers in the malt backbone. Very nice smelling IPA.  This kind of falls short. It's a fairly bitter IPA, but the rest of it is fairly bland. A bit of floral earthiness is there on the backend. But throughout its just bitter, even when it warms up some more. Disappointingly average and uninteresting.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, OK carbonation. Nothing really special stands out. Aftertaste is a floral-pine bitterness that sticks around for quite a while. This is a fairly bitter beer, no ABV here.  Not that interesting to me. They probably used a crapton of bittering hops, but didn't really get a whole lot of aromatic hops on there. Disappointing, given that this is the first time I've actually had it. Average IPA, not worth revisiting again. However, Enjoy By and Ruination are much better efforts by Stone. I'd recommend looking for these instead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Out of a bottle and into an american shaker at Fernwood Bar, Big Sur, CA.  All of the necessary components are there; appearance is uplifting like Kate Upton in a corset; smell is delicate, yet nice like picking flowers with Natalie Portman in Florence while she is wearing her summer best; and taste is on par like Eva Mendes swinging a 5 iron.  Now, don't get Raul wrong; it's solid down the line, but not amazing like having Nina Agdal over at 2 AM ""amazing."" The main drawback is what Raul would call a ""strict"" taste/bite in the end.

Smell: Floral extravaganza! The hops stood out, as they should. Notes of citrus and herbs also stand out. Very pleasant scent.  Taste: This was one potent IPA. This beer came off pretty sour after the first sip. Complex notes citrus break through. Eventually the malts come in and attempt to contain the dominating taste of hops. There is a great balance between the hops and malts for this IPA.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, perfect carbonation.  Overall: This IPA seems to get all of the attention. I have enjoyed a number of great IPAs but this one stands out. Drinking one of these is an experience. Definitely a great example of a top-notch IPA.

Taste was very similar to the aroma with citrus hops being foremost with some green notes and a bit of malt sweetness. Mouth feel was moderately carbonated with pretty smooth. After taste was pine.

I keep trying to convince myself that it isn't as good as I think it is - because it so widely available, I guess. But Stone struck gold on this recipe. It has never let me down. Every time I go back to it after not having one for a few weeks, it's always better than I expect. So I have to admit that I really love this IPA.  It is tame enough to be enjoyed at any time, but aggressive enough to remind me not to take it for granted. The citrus flavor is perfect. Sweetness and bitterness are balanced just to my liking. The hops are a little more powerful than is necessary for an IPA, which keeps me coming back for another sip.  I love that I always have Stone IPA as an option no matter where I am in the country.

The aroma is dank, pine, herbal and citrus rinds like grapefruit are also thrown in there. Grain is hardly an afterthought, this nose is all about the hops.  The taste is bitter with floral hop flavoring. Some herbal grassy and dank aspects. Somewhat pithy to rindy with little to no grain inclusion.

Appears very carbonated though, I've had a couple of sips and I still see a ton of bubbles heading to the surface.  Smell: What I'd expect for an IPA. Piney hops are very apparent, hint of grapefruit.  Taste: Pine, hops, grapefruit, makes for a light tart flavor with some bitterness. A lot of the super-bitter IPAs don't have much flavor but like that this is so dry but flavorful. Aftertaste is a bit different, definitely some residual bitterness and hops but also pick up some of the alcohol (in a good way).  Mouthfeel: Lot going on here. Very dry and the heavy carbonation makes this beer seem very light. Just pleasant to drink. You don't really notice the bitterness until after drinking, again leaves some lingering bitterness which helps reinforce the flavor.  Overall: Enjoyed this one. I usually like my IPAs a little sweeter but like what Stone did here. In my opinion a lot of the very bitter IPAs don't have much flavor, just dry dry dry, but this one is dry with impactful flavor.

147,88,WheelsPSU,4.5,"I first had this as a single 12 ounce bottle sometime awhile ago. It pours a golden orange with a bright white head. There is usually sediment and it’s always a bit cloudy. The lacing usually doesn't hang around very long. The nose is orange and lemon, and naturally, a hop bomb. Floral and piney as well. Perfect.  The taste gives me grapefruit and pine. It’s straightforward, not terribly complex but delicious. Exactly what a I long for in a west coast IPA. The mouthfeel is a bit drying but leaves you wanting the beer to linger just a bit longer.  This is the beer that got me hooked on IPAs. It was my introduction to a somewhat bitter, dry hopped beer. I blame it for being my gateway beer to all of the other over the top hopped beers. Thanks Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jkshield,4.4,"12oz bootle poured into  A: the color is a cloudy golden haze with about a cm of head if poured correctly  S: a refreshing aroma of floral notes and citrus undertones  T: A intense almost piney and grassy nose followed by a more floral after tone. I normally like IPA with a little more depth in terms of their malts, especially IPA with a little more amber malts to them, but the hops are brewed with a very deliberate and unique way that make the beer taste great.  M: This beer left my mouth feeling tingly and content. It had a very refreshing and interestedly well balanced after tone that made me want another sip of that golden nectar.  Overall a great beer. They had a flavor and taste in mind and were definitely able to make that unique and flavorful beer they had wanted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,christopher_shaffer,4.22,I have to admit that I was finally convinced to try Stone after reading Mitch Steele's excellent book on IPA's.  This was an IPA I avoided for a long time because I didn't think something so well distributed and available could be any good. Boy was I wrong. Stone never ceases to impress me with their hop levels and just plain drinkability. This has become an IPA I judge other IPA's by.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ISmith87,4.49,"What a great go to beer! Available at plenty of grocery stores (this sixer was from Fresh and Easy), this runs 9-10 dollars for 6, making it affordable by craft beer standards.  A - 4.25 - nice golden amber color that's clear as day and has a perfect thin film of off white bubbles on top. Lacing is plentiful. Bottle is full of character and sticks out enough that I can remember specific movies where I've seen it sitting around in the background.  S - 4.5 - the uber-fresh hoppiness is amazing, esp for the price. Grapefruit, orange, lemon lime, pineapple, and other tropical fruits are right at the front. There's still a sweet malt in the background that balances it all.  T - 4.5 - bitter piney grapefruit. This beer is like the definition of west coast IPA. It's just so easy to taste the specific hop flavors. Citrus zest. Not really balanced by malt but who cares. I'd be interested to see how it stacks up to it's imperial brother Ruination.  M - 4.5 - intensely bitter, alc completely hidden, bitter aftertaste that's almost tongue numbing. You would definitely have to move up from here to a darker or more hoppy beer to still taste something.  O - 4.5 - probably way above average on this rating, but this is so much better than other IPA s you can pick up at any grocery store. Out of Union Jack, Hop Notch, Torpedo Extra IPA, Lagunitas IPA, etc I think this really takes the cake. It s just that good. Sculpin and Pliny may be better, and the day someone finds me a sixer of either of those for less I'll buy them first. but until then --&gt; Stone IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bowers-Brew,3.81,"A - Nice clean orange/brown color - good head when poured aggressively, but didn't last long.  S - Nice hop-full smell - more pine than citrus, slight yeast and alcohol notes.  T - Sweet up front - earthy, piney, bitter, and dry finish.  O - Good IPA., but I rate it a bit low compared to the average on this one. Love Stone and Love IPA's, but this and some of their other beers, just fall short with me for some reason. I plan to give it another try to see if my taste buds are just not quite on today.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SFACRKnight,3,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into oskar blues pint glass. Pours a brite gold color with an inch of rocky bone white head. Aroma, well, there isn't much going on here. Faint malt scent, muted pine hops. Hope this gets better. Flavor follows the scents, muddled hops, muted malt presence. Nice mouthfeel, I'm sure these fine bubbles would help scrub the bitterness from my pallate... if there was any. Overall, I've had american pale ales that blow this beer out of the water. I will add a caveat to this review, I started my night out with alpha king and had this beer right after eating some crackers to ""cleanse"" my pallate. I also expected an ipa to bring more to the party than it little brother. I will be revisiting this beer, but my initial impression is that stone may be needing a facelift with this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Adastra,4.44,"This beer embodies a very masculine styling of the IPA, with the barrage of hops that hits your pallet all of the way to the smooth finish and crisp flavor despite its relatively high ABV%.  Appearance is irrelevant in beer, in my opinion. I drink it for the flavor, and complexity, or to simply get weird. So let's move on.  Smell: Has a very strong pine note, with a citrus follow up that pierces through your nasal passages. Lemongrass seems to be the main reason for this citrus and slightly earthy smell. You can definitely pick up on the large quantity of hops used to brew this beverage.  Taste: Despite its ABV% of 6.9 this beer is smooth from start to finish, the malt flavor washes over your pallet paving the way for a crisp pine flavor, and finally leaving your pallet with the slight bitterness due to the hops. Definitely smooth, and complex with some slight fruit note in it. This beer will leave you craving another sip.  Mouth-Feel: Cleanses easily throughout your mouth, and the hops/alcohol gives a nice dry sensation. Not overly dry. Smooth and easy to drink, leaves a somewhat oily feel as the hop bitterness lingers.  Overall: I am the reason we offer this beer in the bar I work at, being in charge of beer/liquor orders has greatly expanded our collection and quality, and this is the premiere IPA we offer after the Stone RuinTen, very popular, economical, and allows Guinness to float on it beautifully for a nice stout Black 'n Tan or Doberman. This is one of the beers I always have stocked at home, and will never allow to be 86'd in the bar. I highly recommend this beer to everyone who is expanding their beer horizon. Keep up the excellent work Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nexumen,4.29,"I'm fresh to Beer Advocate at first, it was because of this site I went beer hunting starting with the top 250 beers I could find around my area. On that list, was a lot of Stone beers. I still Have 4 bottles to go after the one I'm having now, which is the IPA. By popularity and rating, the remaining bottles are Double Bastard, Imperial Russian and Espresso Imperial Russian, and the Ruination. Finishing my intro, I realize I'm probably not a big fan of IPAs. This ""hop"" taste seems to be the big factor in some of the ratings (remember, it's just my perspective) and my tongue just isn't a huge fan. Other IPAs I enjoy however are this one and Firestone's Pilsner. When people say bananas or grapefruit, I always wonder how the heck can you taste that, but then again, I'm a novice so I respect everyone for how they taste beer. That's what makes us all individuals.  Now, onto what I thought.  A: It looked nothing special, the bottle I mean. Classic brown bottle, label, and so forth. Drank straight from a bottle, but poured into a glass for the sake of appearance. Looked like a orange/yellow color with a one to two finger head. Not cloudy, but not clear.  S: Right away my nose was pleased by a sweeter smell, but also toasty. All I know is that my nose was pleased with it, creating a refreshing facial expression. I can smell the hop in it, considering it's an IPA, but not too overwhelming.  T: At first, it was a mixture of sweet and tangy, followed by a buttery/bitter woody taste. Aftertaste was smooth, and the hop wanted the last word for sure. It was almost like Firestone's Pilsner, except it had a little more strength to the hop. No complaints here though. Didn't taste any specific fruits or anything like that, but I'm sure other tasters have.  M: Carbination was there, not as strong as Pepsi or coke, but not light like Mountain Dew or Red Bull. Felt bubbly, but soon dissipated after the swallow. It wasn't completely smooth, but it was enough to say, ""Ah, not too bad"" and then take another gulp. After a few takes, I declared, Yes, I like it.  O: It's a good beer. I did enjoy this beer better than the other Stone beers I've had, which were the Arrogant Bastard, Gotterdammerung and Self-Righteous beers. I can't wait to try the other ones mentioned. It was smooth for me, had a hint of sweet taste without an overpowering hop flavor. I did try and orange slice with it, and it gave an additional positive flavor to it, smoothing it out more, but not much more. Good Job Stone, you have a returning buyer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DJScroggins,3.95,"Orange tinged golden color. Clear. Light carbonation visible. Pours with nice ivory head. Good retention. Beautiful medium thick lacing.  Citrusy smell, particularly orange zest. Certainly some pine here. Mild sweetness in background.  Big rush of hops up front, fades to tart grapefuit in the middle with strong, bitter, piney finish.  Mouthfeel is light without feeling insubstantial. Sits nicely on the tongue. Moderate carbonation. Very smooth beer.  This IPA isn't the most complex of its kind, but it's so eminently drinkable. Certainly one of my favorite go to beers of the summer. Always have wished that the flavors interacted more rather than hitting the palate in distinct phases. But certainly an IPA I recommend for individuals wanting to tread in a more hoppy direction.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ianmatth,4.5,"A - Yellow-orange, a little cloudy. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?  S - Flowery, citrus, some pine. Dry hopping with high quality hops here.  T - Light malt profile that really lets the hops cut through. Plenty of fruit, citrus, and pine with good bitterness, but not overpowering, very light and clean for such a heavily hopped beer.  M - Smooth and dry, very balanced.  O - This is the standard by which I measure all IPAs, and since I can get it for $9.99 a six pack, it's a great deal too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kell50,3.91,"Poured a 12oz bottle into my OMB tulip. Enjoy by 9-23-13 written on the neck.  A - Pours a clear, amber color with a slight haze. A small head vanishes quickly leaving a small touch of foam in the middle of the glass. Very light lacing holds on tightly.  S - Touch of pine with slight citrus undertones chiming in. Not too overwhelming. I actually expected some more punch from their flagship IPA.  T - Tastes much better than it smells. Perfect amount of hops for an IPA and malt backbone. I'm also picking up some grapefruit rind, ground black pepper and caramel. The alcohol at 7% is pretty masked.  M - Finishes pretty clean and is refreshingly light on the palate, which I don't typically experience with Stone beers. I love how easy this goes down.  O - Stone has created yet another excellent example of a ""west coast"" IPA. It's very drinkable and very true to the style. I wish I had another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Noyt,3.89,"Bottle. Gold pour with ivory white head. Aroma is heavy pine, a whole coniferous forest’s worth. Some sweetness too slightly citrusy or some pineapple.

147,88,Aaron_Ramson,4.02,"Served from tap into a plastic ""bud-light"" cup at a local music club. Great IPA aroma; herbal, citrusy, slightly earthy, along with toasty bready notes. Nice thick head that dissapates into a sheet of lacing (even on a plastic cup) and a fine layer of bubbles that remains on top of the brew. Taste is pure hop bitterness! Herbal hop variety; very piney, some orange pith and grapefruit zest; malt profile is hidden under the hop barrage but very little is to be had in terms of malt complexity or residual sweetness. Very dry and assertive. Medium thin mouthfeel. Overall a very aggressive IPA and the benchmark set by Stone. I much prefer the sweeter, less herbal taste of Sierra Nevada torpedo extra IPA, or even the juicy-fruit bomb that is 'Stone's Enjoy' By line. Just my own personal tastes. Fans of a botanical, earthy, bitter IPA love this beer and rightly so.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Head retention is very good with excellent lacing.  Smells have citrus and piney hops in the forefront, with elements of grapefruit and other tropical fruits, with a slight sweetness. Very pleasing aromas  The taste consists of a sharp hop bite, with bitter grapefruit flavors. I get some alcohol warming as well.

147,88,scotorum,3.9,"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into an Innis & Gunn flute.  a: Clear amber topped with a two finger thick white head which dissipated to a thick foam surface film and heavy lacing.  s: Moderate pine, leaning to intense.  t: A piney hop assault on the tongue suggestive of an IIPA. Lingering bitter finish.  m: Moderate, the hop bitterness detracts.  o: A powerful and unpleasantly bitter IPA, typical of West Coast IPAs, indeed reminiscent of Green Flash and Lagunitas, although the latter is a bit less hoppy and far more tasty.  Definitely one hopheads will enjoy. Not for me though, the finish is too persistently bitter, although I enjoyed it more near the end. Yet I just had an SN Hoptimum last night and loved it. And Uinta's Hop Notch the night before that, and liked it a lot.  Oddly, I loved Ruination, which is even more hoppy than this. Perhaps my taste buds do not appreciate certain hops. I'll take the slightly more pricey IPAs from another California company, Firestone Walker, over this any day. And for not a lot more than half the price, SN Torpedo will suffice to satisfy my hop cravings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I can't see any carbonation in this beer. Smell is very sweet and I get orange, citrius, pine and tropical fruits... awesome that is how a IPA should smell!  Taste is a short fruity sweetness closely follwed by a big piney hop presence that lingers on your palate.. I quess until the next morning ;) I have to admit I like my IPA more balanced. This is just pure hop bitterness, with almost no malts to back it up.

A little bit on the bitter side for my tastes but balance could be spot on for some real hopheads.  M: Medium body that is just a little sticky but still pretty crisp. Medium carbonation.  O: A true west coast IPA. I'm more of an east coast style guy, but I have to respect the quality of this beer.

A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of surface foam. Sudsy, resilient lacing.  S- Musty, dank, resinous hop aroma that's not too over the top by Stone's standards. A bit of booze and trace amounts of bready malt.  T- Juicy hop flavor with assertive bitterness that's, once again, not too over the top. The alcohol lets you know it's there but doesn't get in the way of enjoyment.  M- Sharp and tangy from the hops with medium carbonation and a lightish body.  O- A solid benchmark for the style. I always forget about how strong it is.

147,88,StoutHunter,3.83,"I picked up a bottle of Stone's IPA yesterday for $1.99 at The Lager Mill. When I saw this beer sitting on the shelf I realized that I haven't had it before. so I decided to give it a try, lets see how it goes. Enjoy by July 21st. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label is nice, it's not that eye catching but it has clean and classy look to it. It poured a fairly clear golden yellow color that took on an orange hue when held to to the light with two fingers worth of creamy slightly off white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and left some nice rings of lacing behind. This is pretty good looking IPA, I have no complaints at all.  S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher medium amount of sweetness followed by a good amount of hops, there's some spicy and floral hop aromas mixed in with a nice citrus hop aroma with grapefruit seeming to stick out the most. Up next comes some a slight bit of bready and grainy malts followed by some more floral hops aromas with a little bit of pine in the background. This beer had a nice aroma, it was dominated by hops, maybe a little too much so, but the hop profile was pretty nice.  T- The taste starts off with a slightly lower amount of medium sweetness followed by a good amount of hops, I get all the hops aspects that I picked up in the aroma, but it's the floral hops that seems to stick out the most imparting a flavor that reminds of Two Hearted Ale. Up next comes a very slight bit of malts that imparts a light grainy flavor that is a little watery. On the finish there's a very high amount of medium bitterness bordering on high bitterness with a very floral hoppy like aftertaste. This was a nice tasting IPA, but I would have liked just a little more balance to it.  M- A little smooth, pretty dry, pretty crisp, slightly watery, on the lighter side of being medium bodied with a good amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was nice, but I wish it was just a tad thicker.  Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average IPA, it had a pretty nice hop profile that stayed away from the heavy citrus and tropical fruit components and it relied on some nice floral hops to take the helm and I thought that worked out nicely. This beer had decent drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention and I think one or two of these would be good enough for me, the bitterness and lighter body might start to wear on me after awhile. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty damn good with the aroma doing a great job at highlighting those floral hops. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, I know IPA's are suppose to highlight the hops, but I think a maltier base would help this beer a little. I don't know if I would buy a six pack of this anytime soon, but I wouldn't mind ordering this at a bar/restaurant and I think this could pair well with some spicy food, I recommend this to any IPA lover and people who like the floral hops, I also thought it was priced nicely. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid IPA, there's some aspects that I think could be improved upon, but for the most part is was a pretty good straight forward American IPA and the more I drank it the more I liked the hop profile. This isn't my favorite IPA, but it's far from my least favorite, I would say it's a little above being right in the middle, but if I was in the mood for a floral hop heavy beer I would choose Two Hearted Ale over this. Good job Stone this is one solid IPA, I have no clue what took me some long to try it but I'm glad I finally did, keep up the good work guys.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerDocT,3.66,"Been very impressed with every other Stone product I have purchased. Looking forward to trying this baby. These guys really know their hops.  Appearance 3.50: Poured out a hazy, semi-translucent gold. Half-inch head stuck around as thick foam on the top.  Smell 3.75: Nice bouquet. Very spicy hop aroma that is almost floral. Not a thick and cloying floral scent, but light, airy...very pleasant and inviting. Also hitting notes of pine..chlorophyll...is this Chinook? Nice.  Taste 3.75: Front is somewhat salty and features a very subdued hop alkalinity. Middle is very hoppy and floral...somewhat too floral. Middle is also malty and semi-sweet. Finish is dry, with more of the floral hop. Ever smelled a tea tree blossom? It reminds me of that. Pleasant, but strange and somewhat distracting. Aftertaste is wonderful: everything described above taken back a step and distilled...almost like perfume.  Mouthfeel 3.50: Good level of carbonation, certainly fits this style.  Overall 3.5: Good IPA and certainly different from the many other IPAs that seem to proliferate the bottle shops. The featured hop in this brew is distinctive; very clever and well-thought out of the brewmaster at Stone. Nonetheless, this IPA is not perfect (IMHO), but it is very good. Sessionable, but probably not all that great with food. I see the floral hop interfering/clashing with certain flavor profiles. Nonetheless, certainly worth trying this beer if you have never had the privilege.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very floral and fruity with multiple layers of complexity. Perfect hop bitterness lingers just long enough. Just enough malt to balance the powerful hops. Perfect head which adheres to the glass to remind you it is disappearing by the sip. I buy it by the case whenever I can find it! I've tried many beers that are rated higher on this site, but none come close to the perfection of this beer for me.

Bitter and citric upfront flavor of grapefruits with pine and resin notes. Very dry, even astringent, and an eternal bitter aftertaste. This will make you sneeze or have your nose running. Medium body with perfect carbonation. Alcohol of 6.9% ABV is a coward against its power. This is a bold IPA, which does not overcomplicate. It is assertive, delivers what has promised, and it is reasonably balanced given its extremes flavors. Hard to beat it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste is all of that, with grapefruit being most dominant in the beginning and the end, with the other flavors lending a hand in the middle.

147,88,utopiajane,3.67,"Pours clear, amber/ orange with a good size head of white foam that fell almost reasonably to a thick cap; leaving some monstrously stubborn lace. Nose is big with lemon, floral and herbal, citrus, lime and a nice soft spice under all the fruit. Not a lot of malt on the nose. Just a hint of bread and some caramel sweetness. As it warms the lemon sweetens deeply and so does the caramel. Taste is colossal. Fruit washes over the palate a bit too quickly and meets a heavy resin for a bitter that starts mid palate. Bread shows up in back with some light biscuit right before an oily pine blast. Finishes slick with a powerful bitter that lasts long into a finish that isn't really dry as much as pithy and sour. Body is thin and while the malt constantly approaches it never rounds out and so this leaves a touch imbalanced Moderate to low carbonation.  This was a strong, beer that grows on you as you drink. I didn't find the same cocky personality in this that I have found in other Stone beers and I think I missed that. I also think that the fruit character suffered in the attempt to make it intensely bitter without provoking it sufficiently first. The malt came out more and more to show that it was indeed stronger than you might have realized. The hop character engaged you more and more as well as the expansive bitter just kept unfolding and at the end of the bottle I was mysteriously satisfied.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BEERZILLA,4.73,"Stone brews are all top notch and this one is no exception.it pours a hazy orange and imo is the perfect example of the styles appearance,nice head that retains and excellent lacing.  It smells of hops and citrus,more lemon oil than anything else.there isnt much in the way of malt but thats fine with me.  Taste is a hop punch in the face,not much malt for balance but balance is over rated imo.lemon is the next thing that hits me after the hops and bitter.  The mouthfeel is spot on to style to me,i would not call this a sessionable beer by any means but thats not what ipa's are all about anyways.If i had to give one knock on this beer it would be that it has a bit to much lemon oil but thats really nitpicking.  Overall, stone ipa is outstanding and is the standard by which all ipa's should be measured.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jekyll,3.77,"Well was introduced to craft beer 10 years ago and been a member of BA for almost as long. Decided to start reviewing them 10, ye ars later one at a time. Well havent had stone in quite awhile and decided to give this one a go and it is how i remembered . An over rated ipa boosted by incredible word of mouth and marketing. Not bad at all just overrated and waaay overhyped. Above average ipa at best and would be curious where this would score in a blind test without the benefit of all the hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MarkQ617,4.73,"Big boy bottle poured into a pint glass. Gorgeous copper color, slight haze, generous slightly off-white head. Aggressive aroma, big hops, good citrus, floral. Not as clean of a finish as I think you see from a lot of IPAs, but I think that's a good thing as there's nothing to complain about with the after taste here. Another outstanding offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,stella77artois,4.21,"12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A - ""Powerful"" looking IPA. Seemed to be darker than most. A dark golden-orande, I'd say. Maybe I had an old bottle, but didn't have much of a head. Bummed about that.  S - The usual IPA aroma, with more than more normal citrus. Smelled some orange peel and even a touch o' lime. Some piney scents, too.  T - A darn good IPA. Nothing hugely deviated from a typical quality IPA, which isn't a bad thing. The difference in this one is it seemed to have more subtle sweet hints. Touch of malt, and the aforementioned citrus. Pleasantly bitter aftertaste.  F - Solid, powerful. Not as dry as some IPA's, which is a good thing. Good amount of carbonation.  O - A quality IPA, one of the better ones I've had. More fruity flavor than a typical IPA without sacrificing it's bold, hoppy flavor. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBeerDog,4.55,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A - light orange, pours a nice head and leaves lots of tracing on the glass  S - Pine, citrus, ya know that wonderful west coast IPA aroma  T - bold and bitter, but not overwhelmingly so  M - pleasant, smooth  Overall - I've had Stone IPA on several occasions, but this is the first time I've had it in quite a while. At first drink, believe it or not, I kinda felt that it tasted a little watery. But then I realized that my perception has been altered somewhat by my recent consumption of many bold high alcohol IPAs, porters and stouts. However, once I reached the bottom of the glass, I was enjoying this quite a bit, and was pleasantly reminded of my previous dalliances with this beer. Overall, this is a great beer. If you're looking for something more bold and daring, reach for the Ruination or Arrogant Bastard. But if you're craving something more drinkable, less bitter, and, dare I say, sessionable, go with the IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CMUbrew,4.4,"A: Light orange in color, clear body, bone white head on top.  S: Very piney with some grapefruit and orange rind to be found as well.  T: Obviously a West Coast IPA. Big piney and resinous hop punch with a sizeable and enjoyable bitterness. As you drink more you can start to pick up delicious flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and bitter grapefruit peel, and slight hints of orange.  M: Nice body, soft feel with good carbonation, and slightly slick and oily. Goes down very easy for a nearly 7%, high IBU beer.  O: Perhaps the quintessential West Coast IPA and definitely one of my new favorite IPAs overall (if not THE favorite). If it wasn't for the high price being this far from Cali, I would certainly buy it on a more regular basis.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cozmohollis,4.77,"A: Orange in color with a white head a really good lace.  S: Citrus scent.  T: Orange and other citrus flavors with a good amount of hops from beginning to end. Really clean and smooth.  MF: Medium light body with medium carbonation. Crisp, refreshing, smooth and clean with a hoppy feel the whole time. Drinkable with a light and dry finish.  O: One of my favorite IPAs. I love how there are hops all throughout this beer but it doesn't over power it. A good IPA for any time, even summer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FairyFunBoy,4.37,"A- Straw color with a red hue. White 3 finger head. S- Burst of pine and sap with a great citrus undertone. T- Orange, pine, biscuit malt. Overwhelms the palate in the best way possible. M- for such a great beer the mouthfeel was a little light. Not too much malty velvet like I would prefer. Carbonation wasn't sufficient half way through the pint.  O- this is one of my go to beers. Stone is dependable, their IPA is a great addition to their suburb collection.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Cobrito,4.49,"Not sure there's much point in rating a beer that already has more than 5,000 reviews, but here goes for my faithful reader(s).  Bottle with enjoy by date of July 17, 2013.  I find that Stone IPA's excellence sneaks up on you. The appearance and head are fine but nothing dramatic in terms of size or museum-quality lacing or anything. The aroma is somewhat tightly wound, at least coming from the bottle, and it is subtle though nicely complex--dank hops with with a surprising, orangey-grapefruit fruitiness that tells me this beer was made by people who have a sense of composition and desire to combine flavors in an at least somewhat out of the box way. So then I drink. And drink. And it goes down so incredibly easily, but the complexity of the nose is still there in the palate, and the finish on the back of the tongue, while somewhat short, has a pleasant bite, and it is so tantalizing. Can I do that again? And again? In part because of the company's over the top ad copy, there is this sense that Stone is bad ass, but this standard IPA seduces slowly but completely. The Billie Holiday of IPAs?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kuaff,4.4,"Served from a bottle into a tulip glass around cellar temperature.  Stone's IPA has a nice two fingers of a white, frothy head, and the beer itself is a remarkably clear, golden amber color. Such pure clarity... very beautiful.  The smell has strong pine, some citrus, and a little bit of candy-like honey sweetness. This is exactly how I like an IPA to smell.  It tastes much like it smells... great! I get all the classic IPA flavors in abundance. Like the bottle says, it's brewed with simply ""barley, hops, water, and yeast."" It's amazing how such simple ingredients can be melded together so perfectly. The bitterness is impressive. If you can stand to wait a few minutes before the next sip (challenging as it is), you'll still be able to taste the bitter hoppy goodness long afterwards.  The carbonation is right where I want it, just like everything else with this beer.  Bottom line: this is an outstanding IPA that delivers a plentifully flavorful punch that puts some lesser DOUBLE IPAs to shame. Stone rules.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RyanTeeter,4.48,"a: This IPA is gorgeous! A straw color that is dense with flavor so although it is clear it does appear hazy. It carries a great, wonderfully dense head. The head just sits atop the beer, like a billowy comforter on a bed.  s: The smell is the classic citrusy hops common to the American Hops style.  t: The taste is spot on to an American IPA. Nice citrus hops characteristics leave a lingering grapefruit acidity on the back of the tongue. You do get a wince of the alcohol within the flavors however the balance with the grapefruit is perfect.  m: Very smooth....'gives you chills' smooth. Low carbonation allows for this to simply rush down the throat, demanding more.  o: This is the quintessential IPA. This was a pleasure to drink and I would be blessed if there was more in my fridge (there is not). As I am reviewing this beer I am taking sips between every two or three words - I cannot keep it out of my hands. Very positive experience!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brodericksloth,4.49,"Excellent nose ..very citrusy and clean. malts integrated but not pushy. overall hop dominated. very nice summer beer, it cools you off. lingering chewy pine aftertaste but not palate wrecking easy to drink. high acidity from hops. alcohol well hidden at 6.9% abv. nice head until the end. good pub or outdoor beer; only improves as it heats up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,VoodooBear,4.77,"Presentation: 22 oz. brown bottle with an ""enjoy by"" date printed on the neck. Served in a Samuel Adams pint glass.  Appearance: One finger head goes down eventually and stays there until the end. It has a clear, bright gold color, and leaves some very nice lacing.  Smell: The smell is fantastic, with a dominating herbal hop scent and some pine, fruit and spice notes present too.  Taste: This beer has a big hop character, overwhelmingly so. It's very herbal, spicy and bitter. You've gotta love hops to really appreciate the details and character in this. If you don't it'll be just another (albeit good) strong, bitter brew.  Moutfeel: It feels creamy, full bodied and smooth. It leaves a tingling sensation on the palate that's quite curious.  Overall: An amazing brew in every single aspect. If you love hops, IPA's or just something crisp, bitter and challenging, you'll love this beer. If you don't, you'll probably be put off by the intensity of it all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Arithmeticus,4.18,"Poured chilled in standard ale glass  A: dark orange; very little head; carb is good, but the bubbles are inert; little lacing S: very hoppy, lively; aroma lasts quite a while; promises much in the way of hops T: sweet, intense IPA; quite lively; strong in the finishing hops M: viscous, thick mouthfeel  This is an amazing IPA, but to be had only on occasion, because of the intensity",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Roguer,3.93,"A - Pours a surprisingly dark orange-copper color. Very small cream head. Nice amount of carbonation. Thick but translucent. Leaves nice lacing on the glass.  S - Has the fresh citrus, grapefruit scent I would expect. Not overpowering.  T - Hop-forward, with a surprisingly strong element of malts. Grapefruit peel on the backend. The malts give it a caramel feel, while the citrus is definitely not as pronounced as I would have expected. Some floral hops, as well. There's a little bit of citrus sweetness, separate from the notable maltiness.  M - Very nice, mouthy and thick, but drinkable. I don't see this as an all-day drink. The alcohol is very well-hid (granted, it's only 6.9% ABV), the flavors are well-blended, and the carbonation doesn't bother the tongue or palate at all.  O - This is very good, very drinkable, a good example of an IPA. It's neither as thick nor flavorful as a DIPA, but there's certainly no lack of hops, and it provides surprising balance and complexity. For my personal tastes, I'm not big into the malty flavor, which is accentuated as the beer warms up. I don't think it makes it a bad beer; I think it's quite intentional, and well-crafted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Connormick,3.8,"The IPA from Stone Brewing Co. was poured from the bottle into a clean pint glass. It had a smaller head (1-1.5 inches) but it was nicely shaped.  The part of this IPA that bothered me the most was the appearance. It seems like a plain looking IPA, kind of a copper colored cloudy color. But it looked like there were solid particles hanging around. It may not be a big deal, but it bothered me just a bit.  The smell was my favorite part of the beer. It was incredible, an intensely strong hops smell, it practically cleared my sinuses.  The taste was a lot like the smell. A strong hoppy taste but refined with a citrus and pine-like backround. I am not really a fan of IPAs but I feel that for what this drink does, it does really really well.  Mouthfeel was fine. I could feel the carbonation but it wasn't crazy.  Overall, I'm not really a fan of IPAs. But this IPA makes such a strong identity for itself that I have to like it even if I wouldn't drink it regularly. If you REALLY like hops, it will make you happy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bosoxfan20,4.24,"A- Poured from 12oz bottle into a Speigelau IPA glass. Pours a copper color with a nice 1-1.5 finger white head. Average retention with sticky lacing. Nothing special, just looks like an IPA  S- Citrus with some floral, pine and grassy hops. Orange and grapefruit rind lead the charge to the charge to the olfactory sensors. Sweet base on the back end  T- Dynamite. Hop forward with the citrus the nose caught from the 3 Cs of hops. Maybe even a little more intense than the nose led me to believe. Just a touch of bready malts to keep the hop profile honest. It's not super balanced...and it's not trying to be. Delightfully bitter finish with a slight hint of acidity.  M- Mid body with nice carbonation. A lil slick with an oh so dry finish. Crisp, drinkable and refreshing.  O- The way an IPA should be. If I had to drink 1 IPA for the rest of my life, I certainly wouldn't be upset if this were the one. An overlooked classic here. Can't believe it took me this long to try it.  No bottled on date even though i know Stone is relentless with their dating. Relatively inexpensive.

147,88,DenverHopHead,4.41,"This particular bottle is dated best by 8/26/13, so fresh! Poured into a tulip. Appearance - Pours a gold, almost orange with a thick white head, a lot of carbonation and leaves a lot of lacing. Smell - The aroma of this brew is superb! Grass, pine, grapefruit, other citrus hops. Taste - matches the nose. A lot of dominating hop character! Feel - a rush of hop bitterness, wreaks the palate like so many of Stones offerings! Overall - So good! This is a classic representation of the West Coast IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Skywave,4.41,"Pours out to a creamy white head, concentric rings of lace, and hazy golden color. Aroma is ""c"" hops and sticky Carapils malt with notes of pine, citrus and cilantro. Flavor is a world class blend of pungent hops in your face, pale malt backdrop and lingering alpha acid bite. Mouthfeel is light to medium and carries the flavors well. On the whole, a damn fine American IPA made by people who stake thier rep on quality and craftsmanship.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,J_Dub,4,Poured a golden yellow into a stone IPA glass with minimal head. This one is a real hop bomb. The aroma of pine and grapefruit hops dominate. Very fresh and floral. Taste is what one would expect: Hoppy pine. Some citrus. Loads of peppery spice. Exceptionally bitter. Medium carbonation and body.  A solid IPA that is a good representation of the style. There are other IPAs I like much better but many more I like less. Stone IPA is one of the more reasonably priced and accessible brews of the style.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JackMcAwesome,4.28,"Dated: 06/04/13  Poured into a mug.  Look: A hazy light gold is poured with a one finger head. The lacing is quite minimal, so I'm wondering if it's the glass. I'll edit if that changes. A constant flow of bubbles from the bottom keep feeding the head throughout.  Smell: HOPS. That's almost it for my nose. A bit of citrus. Perhaps on the grapefruit side. Everything I expected, and it lingered quite nicely.  Taste: Follows the nose completely. Upfront is all hops, which turns into citrus, and it seems to end on a honey note. Very interesting, and smooth.  Feel: Medium light carbonation. Mildly slick, but not a tipping point for me. (I'm personally not a fan of slick beers, but this one is balanced well enough, so it's not an issue.)  Overall: A great buy as pretty much everyone seems to already know, and well worth visiting again. For anyone who wants a punch in face with a hop glove, give this one a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hendry,4.11,"Minimally hazy honey color that pours a two inch foamy head that is truly nice and hangs out for a good spell. The nose is that of a well crafted California IPA, which is hop forward and has an average citrus aroma for the style. Lacing is quite good.  Flavors are that of a well crafted West Coast IPA: punguent, piney, and slightly bitter. The aftertaste is on the bitter side and pleasant. Stone is widely available as I picked up mine at the local supermarket for a $5 bomber.  Overall, no letdowns here: a nice solid example of a Cali IPA, yet for an extra $1.50 AleSmith IPA scratches my itch in the pronounced citrus aromas/ lingering aftertaste arena for pocket change.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dar482,4.39,"The color is a light hazy orange.  The aroma has big hops, citrus, and grapefruit. Very expected from Stone.  The taste has a good upfront orange, then grapefruit, lemon juice, and then a big bitter dry finish that actually turns into huge tart grapefruit peel and sticks there. I wish there was more citrus punch in the front. It's a bit away from Ruination to my surprise.  The wonderful bitterness and fruity pop is great, but I don't care too much for the grassy lingering finish. Exceptional IPA, but I prefer Centennial and Union Jack. A good dry hoppy IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dope,4.15,"Best by 5/29/13, so quite fresh.  A: A clear medium amber pour. Big fluffy white head. Head fades very slowly.  S: Grapefruit with a little resin and caramel.  T: Lots of grapefruit and resin. Resinous hops quite strong in fact. A little bit of caramel sweetness but it gets overrun by the hops pretty easily. Waves of bitterness in the finish. Resinous, piney hops linger in the aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied, drying in the finish. Almost a little soapy in the finish too.  O: It's a pretty simple IPA but very nice. Huge on the hops with little malt backing it up - truly a west coast IPA and a standard of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JamFuel,4.25,"Pours a clear amber with fine, soapy head.  Smell is fruity and floral with notes of grapefruit, pine, lemon, green tea and some peach.  Taste is fruity and a bit sweet.

147,88,GossageBrewery,4.31,"Poured this 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. This American IPA poured a hazy golden color, produced a thick creamy head, excellent retention and excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of malted grain, citrus and pine. Medium in body, this AIPA has a foundation of malted grain, biscuit, fruity easter and dominant piney hops. Bitter and well balanced- Nice example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dougbassett,4.48,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #20 of the ones I've reviewed here.  The paradigmatic American IPA. There are others I like better, but if I wanted to introduce a newcomer to the style, this is probably the one I would give them. It hits all the classic notes.  Pours an impressive golden brown/bronze color. The head disappears quickly but it's nice to see it while it's here. Classic nose of orange peel, lemon and dry Xmas spice -- flavors more or less the same with a terrific finish at the end -- the bitterness lasts a long, long time.  Like some other beers I've tried of it's type, I think it's only real fault is that the body/mouthfeel is really too light to support the flavors contained therein. This would've been even better at a heavier concentration.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gr0g,4.07,"Amber in color, slightly hazy. Solid two-finger head that leaves a nice sudsy ring around the crown of my pint glass. Plentiful hop aromas, primarily of grapefruity citrus with a touch of pine. When I first got into IPAs, the aroma score would've been higher, but Stone's IPA lacks the tropical fruit notes present in other top-notch IPAs. Still, pleasantly floral and yet pungent, letting you know the hops are in charge of this beer.  Flavor is bitter from start to finish, and while it isn't balanced by any definition, there's still a solid malt profile. Grapefruit on the palate as in the nose, some resin follows, and some slightly sweet caramel notes finish it off. Spritzy carbonation and slightly oily texture give it a mouthfeel that's an ideal match for the flavor.  Re-rating this after having it for the first time in a long time, and on tap to boot. It's still a fine IPA, and for ""old-school"" C-hop IPAs, Stone's is hard to beat, but it can't really stand toe to toe with the top beers in the style any more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,capnamerica,4.79,Stone Brewing IPA from San Diego  A - Hazy light golden with a nice white head.  S - Excessively hoppy with strong pine notes. Dank/pungent herbal aroma.

This Stone IPA has received a 5 star rating because it is a superior beer.  a: Wonderful honey color. s: Light hop/citrus smell. t: Well balanced smooth taste. m: Medium body with no after taste, smooth. o: Best Westcoast IPA.  This beer does not need any improvement.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TastyAdventure,3.62,"A- very cloudy light orange. 1 1/2 finger head, frothy. clings to glass.  S - citrus like hops, more bitter hops, pine?  T - unlike most IPAs (IMO), the bitterness in this one is not overwhelming, which def. scores it points. The grassy flavor in the middle, does not. The hint of pine helps out the grass. Somewhere in the middle of all that hops, there's a subtle sweetness that tastes a little like sweet orange juice.  M - thick and nice for an IPA. good level of carb.  O - I'm not a fan of IPAs, and this one did not convert me, but still good for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SebD,4.23,"Appearance: It has a nice clear golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately slow and leaves very nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of resiny pine, citrusy hops, bready malts and caramel.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a some delicious pine resins, citrusy hops, some grapefruit and sweet bready/caramelly malts blancing it out.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas.

It's the beer that I always seem to come back to and always enjoy. It has a good ABV, but it is hidden well. The smell is fantastic and you can really smell the hops. The taste is very in your face like any IPA, but in a good way. The taste is very hoppy and with a hint of pine. This is a great beer and a staple for any craft beer drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Andrew041180,4.28,"A - Poured into some kind of bell-mouthed pilsner glass. A little bigger than the bottle required, but all I had handy. Color is very close to golden, and slightly hazy. The pour resulted in about an inch of head that disolved relatively quickly and left little to no lacing on the glass.  S - Not as noticable as some others, but it did have the characteristic west coast hops aromas that I really enjoy.  T - More malt forward than I remember my last glasses being, but not in bad way. I guess it just seemed far more balanced than I remember it being. The finish contained more of the hops taste that I was looking for.  M - Silky smooth and delicious. Very light carbonation.  O - Still one of my favorite, go-to IPAs. I'll advocate for Stone where ever I go.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Roman5150,4.66,"All I can say is, wow. Another amazing beer by Stone. I've only had Arrogant Bastard, Oaked Arrogant Bastard (holy shit), and Double Bastard.  Appearance: 1.5 Finger thick off white head, VERY appealing looking cloudy ipa, dark orange  Aroma: One of the best smelling beers i've encountered, only 2nd to Hopslam by Bells. You can instantly smell the west coast piney ipa signature smell, very citrusy and smells of ripe grapefruit.  Taste: Huge citrus and grapefruit notes, very simcoe oriented, lots of floral and tropical fruity notes... Malt backbone is very sweet and balanced. One of the fruitiest IPAs i've ever had. Very well balanced, probably the most for an IPA i've ever had, so refreshing and smooth on the backend, I could session this all day.  Overall: One of my favorite IPAs, this is what I think all west coast IPAs should measure up to. The aroma and taste are out of this world and I will be buying this over and over again. I may be in the extreme minority, but I prefer this over a Ruination. Which is kind of odd considering I love DIPAs typically a little bit more, and I still love Ruination, but this just blows every other single IPA out of the water.

A - I can't really comment on this considering that I drank it straight from the bottle  S - Refreshingly dank...in a good way. If I was having this beer on 4/20 with eyes closed I might grab for the wrong intoxicant is what I'm saying. Very pleasant smell.  T - MMM. Well balanced. I don't have the ability to discern pine, citrus, grapefruit etc., but if I did they'd probably all be there.  M - Again, well balanced carbonation.

A- dark amber, hazy, some carbonation bubbles rising entire time. nice, off-white two finger head that slowly dissipated leaving partial lacing throughout. S- earthy, pine smell dominates, but there are hints of grapefruit as well. T- hops comes through in a wonderful bitterness that IPA's should have; it finishes with a lemon/honey note that I find interestingly complex. M-The hops sits on the back of your tongue. It is not too heavy, but it is there as it should be. O- Above average in my opinion- it has the bite and bitterness I want in an IPA, but it is not overbearing or hard to drink. This is a beer to be savored and enjoyed slowly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ThisWangsChung,3.78,"Re-review ^_^ 12 oz bottle poured into a regular glass.  A: Pours a faintly hazy golden amber color. The head is a two finger offwhite shade that retains itself nicely.  S: Not really my bag here. It's mostly some earthy dankness, pine cone, mild grapefruit, with a bit of augmenting caramel malt. I prefer big tropical fruit bomb aromas, so it's not the fault of the brew itself.  T: Better than I remembered. The initial flavor is pleasant grapefruit, before giving way to a bitter, dry piny finish. Malts are only vaguely evident throughout. Quite good, even great.  M: Dry and astringent - bitter, too. There's nothing balanced or delicate about the mouthfeel, but it gives the beer impressive drinkability in conjunction with the lighter texture and moderate carbonation. Still, it would be even better if the bitter dryness didn't fatigue the palate so badly.  O: I keep writing off Stone, and there are many occasions when I'm right in doing so. This one, though, I'm thankful I revisited. I wouldn't quite make it a go-to - there's far too big of a risk of getting a stale bottle here on the right coast - but I would revisit this on tap, easily. A good ""palate wrecker"" IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,flydudehsv,4.55,"Pours hazy amber with average, creamy white head; decent retention and spare lacing. Aroma is citrus ans floral hops, orange peel, bread and cookie malt, light dank, and light pine. Flavor is fresh pine, citrus and grassy hops forward (medium bitterness) with good supporting bready malts and light citrus esters; dry finish with some lingering bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation. Good beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hopinista,3.67,"A: Deep orange with really active carbonation. Mine had 1/4 inch of head which dissipated immediately. Really?  S: I was really excited by the smell, really hoppy and piney. Some slight citrus aromas.  T: This is where I was really let down, and really, what else is more important? The smell of strong hops was not matched by the taste. The initial taste is moderate hops, very resiny, then a strong finish of bready malts.  M: Very light on the palate. Very crisp and carbonated.  O: I have to admit, I've been drinking Arrogant Bastard for years, I just finally got around to trying the standard IPA. I feel like this is a big letdown, whereas Arrogant Bastard sets the bar high (for me, I understand the IPA came before arrogant bastard, I had arrogant bastard first, so for me the IPA is the new one) The standard IPA falls a little short of the mark.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheCondor,4.35,"I wanted to snare this one up for obvious reasons. Stone is an excellent brewery, I have heard so much about this IPA, it is a Beer of Fame, etc. Side poured from the 22oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - A large, fluffy white head sits magnificently on top of a golden orange beer that is wicked in its presentation. A little carbonation can be seen in the glass, decent retention with excellent lacing. Of course, as with all Stone products, the packaging is excellent.  Smell - Definetely a fruity hop cascade zips the olfactory glands in a big way. Grapefruit, citrus, and lemons are big time in the nose. Big pines are also present. What you would expect out of a West Coast IPA.  Taste - Follows the nose closely, but has a malty backbone and is very well-balanced. THe malts are continually present on the palate, although the fruity hops are always the big movers.  Mouthfeel - A nice level of hop bitterness and fruity flavors. Very well done all in all, finishes clean and smooth. Medium carbonation and bodied.  Overall - An excellentbeer. All of BA knows this, I know this, you know this. If you haven't had this beer, go get it. Pretty simple.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,KYGunner,4,"Presentation on this IPA is extraordinary as a bright white fluffy cloud sits atop a hazy golden/orange body.  The scent is of mostly citrus hops with underpinnings of grapefruit, lemon, brewed tea and even some orange. Nicely presented in aroma this is the high point.  The taste is mostly piney hops with subtle sweet resins and more floral touches. Very metallic in the finish, some of the tea taste comes out near the end, but that tinny taste lasts for some time.  Very crisp and refreshing this IPA has some highs and some lows to make it an interesting ride.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- caramel, lemon and orange, and pine.  T- caramel malts, lemon and some citrus, with lemon peel and bitter pine.  M- medium body and carbonation. Some syrup feel with effervescent finish.  O- good ipa, well balanced with light caramel and pine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Omnium,4.3,"Bottle &gt; Pint Glass A - Pours a great golden color, single finger head, retains very nice, lacing clings very well. Looks like a fantastic beer, especially an IPA should look. S - A barrage of pine and floral hops, bread malt, with some citrus flavors amongst the pine . T - A tad try, and resinous flavor from the hops, definitely get the bread malt style flavor, but its not overly sweet. Pine flavor is big time here. M - Good feeling IPA that leaves your palate with the bitterness for a while. O - This is just a great, solid IPA that's available year round. Stone is a go-to when it comes to reliable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Clear  Smell is over the top hoppy, extremely resinous with a ton of pine, some citrus, a little dank  Taste follows the nose, big pine and citrus. Big punch of bitterness. Clean malt profile with just a touch of sweetness. Dry and crisp finish.  As aggressive as an ipa gets, way better on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,vicg12,4.35,"Smells like a home brew. Tastes great, lots of hops, mmm. A little less brightness than a usual American IPA, but that does not in anyway mean it's short on flavor, quite the contrary; just different selection in hops. Stone is a great brewer, keep it up. Only real complaint is that it was not very well carbonated, very small head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Judgie,4.11,"Purchased a variety pack at Costco and decided to update reviews/ratings. This classic IPA was packaged exactly 2 months ago (12/13/19) which is probably as fresh as I can expect here in rural Indiana. Poured into a tulip glass, the beer is perfectly clear light copper with a 1 finger head. It looks just as I want a beer to look. Aroma is faint pine and even fainter citrus. Taste is pure IPA, not too sweet, not too bitter. Mouthfeel is clean and perfectly carbonated; again, feels like a beer should feel. I will repeat this purchase again & again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,barczar,4.05,"Pours a clear copper penny color with a foamy half inch cream head that dissipates at a moderately quick pace, leaving sheets of lacing.  Aroma erupts as soon as the bottle is opened, with huge notes of pine, resin, and fresh cut grass dominating. Dank cannabis, citrus fruit, and caramel malt add complexity.  Caramel malt forms the backbone and is far more prevalent than anticipated from the aroma. Flavor is sweeter than expected, throughout. The finish is pretty bitter and herbal tea-like and resiny, with pine in the aftertaste. Dank cannabis and fresh cut grass hit mid palate and hold on for the duration. There's an initial citrus character, showcasing muted grapefruit and lemon. More complex tropical fruits emerge as it warms.  Body is moderate, with a corresponding amount of carbonation, and slight alcohol warmth.  Much more floral and grassy hop character in the flavor than I recall. Citrus is fairly subdued, but bitterness is not. Not an offensive bitterness, but too much for my liking. Good malt presence, though perhaps a little overboard.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Fatehunter,4.02,"Poured a thin head on a hazy, straw colored body. The aroma is a wonderful grain and honey with some citrus. The taste is a solid pine bitterness. Straight up IPA. The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. Well, it's one of the best IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bernardkowalski,5,"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scot_chale,4.53,"A- beautiful crystal clear orange body, 3 fingers of full white foam that recede slowly, and very faint, if any, carbonation activity.  S- Citrusy, grassy hops and some faint fruity esters. it's medium potency.  T- Wow. Absolutely delicious hop character, but balanced. It doesn't hang out, you don't get ""hop bombed"", it's just great. This is such a perfect beer to show someone what all the hop character of an IPA is, without scaring them off in the process.  M- It's kinda soft, kinda thin, dry, washes away but hangs in the back of your mouth. Just perfectly palate cleansing.  O- What a beer. I've had my fair share of IPAs, but never one like this. I've never had an IPA that had all the characteristics I look for, yet washes clean and begs for more without sacrificing body. This is a home run. Cheers. I'll buy a 6 pack of this any time i'm going to be with company that will appreciate it, or a 22oz when I'm not.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Groomsy,4.56,"12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic. ""Enjoy by"" date of 03.03.13.  The pour on this yields a thick, fluffy head of bright white foam that clings all over the glass and leaves sheets of lacing. The body itself is a crystal-clear gold/honey color with nice carbonation from the bottom of the glass. A great looking beer.  Make no mistake: This is the definition of a West Coast IPA. Brimming with the smell of candied grapefruit, oranges, lemons, floral hops, and some piney astringency in the back, the hops are front and center on this beer. Even as a hop-forward brew, there is still a lot of sweetness; I'm getting a lot of ripe tropical fruit in the nose. This is all backed by just enough bready/biscuity malt profile to balance the abundant bitterness. Great nose on this one.  The taste profile follows the nose. On the front of the tongue, there's a big burst of citrusy bitterness, followed by some malty sweetness and tropical fruit (see above) on the middle of the tongue. Some floral and piney astringency hangs on the back on the mouth in the finish. Perfectly balanced, but hop-centered. All of the 3 Cs of the hop world are in full force here and are beautifully intertwined with each other.  Stone's IPA feels great on the palate. For a relatively high ABV for its style, the alcohol is well-hidden and stays in check through the flavors. Mildy carbonated and smooth, this is a dry and refreshing beer of which you can easily drink several. Its light body makes it easy to drink as well.  Through and through, this is a great and quintessential American IPA. You owe it to yourself to try this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mvanaskie13,4.37,"Poured into a new belgium glass, color is gold/copper, translucent but not too dense; head is frothy, thick on the pour then clings and lingers well.  Smell is not all hops, i get some very nice subtle pale and toasted malt notes, grassy and citrus hops come through with an undertone of pine.  Taste is great, wonderful hop forward flavor, big citrus lighter pine and great clean pale malt flavor - never over sweet or way too bitterly hopped.  Mouthfeel is that wonderful mix of bitter forward with some mild malt balance, your tongue is not destroyed by the bitterness and the dryness from the clean fermentation is a great finish.  Overall, great brew, love the hop flavors and the malt balance. Not an over the top IPA, but a great, easy drinking great tasting one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Flounder57,4.03,"12 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: This beer poured a one finger head that reduced to a thin layer. It is a pale yellow color with great clarity and bubbles coming up through the glass. Spotty lacing on the glass as the beer was drank.  Smell: Caramel and bready malts, citrus, grapefruit, and tangerine. Smells so citrus sweet and delicious.  Taste: Everything is blended well together, but the flavors are a bit lighter than what I smelled. Some lingering bitterness in the end too.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium bodied, low to medium carbonation, and some tingly bitterness in the back of the mouth.  Overall: Pretty solid IPA that I have enjoyed through the years. Good stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AshleyKing,3.88,"OK, where are the hops? I get the bitters. What about the amomas?  OK, it is a well made IPA from the demi-gods of San Diego. But it is dry and I am not getting the hop hits when I buy this, pretty frequently above 60 degrees north latitude. I don't blame them because I have never had a fresh keg glass of this golden brew.

S: Big notes of citrus: grapefruit, lemon and orange.  T: More bitter than most IPAs under 7%. Sour lemon and grapefruit. Malt shows up late to the party and gets thrown out by hops. Not a bad thing though, the hop flavors are great in this.  M: Not too sticky, a little creamy, good carbonation.  O: One of my favorites. Lately, I've been drinking this beer more than any other. Classic west coast style IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jellopants356,4.77,"This is the IPA that got me into hoppier beers to begin with. When i was younger, i had Ranger IPA and thought very little of IPAs till my uncle (from California) got me a Stone sampler which included this flagship IPA. I will TRY to rate this IPA as objectively as possible... It pours a nice honey with very little bubbles. About a 2 finger creamy-white head with medium lacing. Tastes start with a strong hop presence (duh) then onto slight fruit notes, maybe a faint bit of apricot. The mouthfeel is whole and pleasant. Overall a very good IPA. Anyone who is thinking of trying an IPA, I recommend this one. Honestly, one of the best IPAs out there and one of my personal favorites, when i can get it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A: Poured a clear, 3-4 shades darker than straw color, with a nice, fluffy, solid white head that sat like whipped cream on top.  S: Lots of pine surfaced as some as I popped the cap. Floral bouquet of hops with no malt to be found. Love it!  T: From the get-go, the bitterness stained my teeth and gums, with a nice hop backbone to back that up, followed by a piney, unmaltified finish. Catch my drift?  M: Nice prickly carbonation, nothing syrupy or sugary about this one, and lots of lacing left on the glass.  O: Always a pleasure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mevett89,5,"Appearance: clear golden body with a nice-sized fluffy white head. The head has nice retention and decent lacing.  Smell: crisp; of bitter hops but with some sweetness in there too.  Taste: quite bitter, with a bit of a metallic taste to it. Citrus, but more pine profile. The crackery malt is almost an afterthought, but manages to balance out the hops well.  Mouth Feel: crisp and refreshing, with lower carbonation. Sticks to your tongue.  Overall: No doubt about it, this is a well-made IPA. It is on the bitter side of the style, and is a tasty and refreshing beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Say you were being revived, you'd like to breathe this. Taste: Intense hops, both flavour and bitterness. A really wonderful flavor arc. starting sweet & fruity and clean bitter finish. This see-saw, and the tingle you feel with IPA is the big draw and Stone does it big without being heavy handed.

Citrus and pine mingle in a crescendo of flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel.

147,88,TheNerd,4.6,"Okay first review...  From a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass (improvizing)  A - like honey but thinner. Not all syrupy. Prior pours ended up with a very thin head so i poured very bold and had about 1.5to 2 fingers worth of head. Disipates after about a minute.  Smell - citrus, a little bit of pine, nice malt to level things out.  Taste - citrus quality hit very strong (in a great way) . Fresh clean. Nice bitternees with the hop but the malt has enough presence to keep it grounded. Like a jumping off point to really enjoy the hop quality w/o dominating your palate too intensely.  M - malt gives you a little something to sink your teeth into. A bit chewy (if i can borrow the term). Crisp and smooth with a little depth to hold on to  O - this after having some New Belgium Snow Day. I like to 'taste' after having something with a big contrast since i puts a focal point on those differences kn my palate. The citrus was very bright in the transition and the Bitter wasnt overwhelming. Great crisp full beer.

Smell - Smooth, hoppy aroma with hints of barley and malt.  Taste - Flavor-filled hoppy punch but not just hops, well rounded. More bitter than smooth.  Mouthfeel - Hinted hop reminder. Hop settles down but rests on the sides of the tongue.  Overall - No mistaking alcohol content in this one, definitely packs a punch!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,danfisher1,3.78,"22oz poured into a DFH tulip.  Appearance: pours a light hay-amberish color. There is a 3-4 finger head after a vigorous pour. Lacing is extensive and dissipates slowly. Beautiful lacing left behind. Head is made up of micro bubbles but is billowing on top like sea foam. Beer is clear with a small amount of bubbles emerging from the bottom.  Smell: a sign isn't hop presence from the moment the cap Is popped. With a few swirls of the glass different characteristics begin to emerge. On the inhale vibrant tropical notes dominate along with the classic west coast hop varietal essences. It's gets interesting on the exhale green apple peels with a tropical twist. Hop forward but not over powering with a slight hint of the 2-row graininess is back there somewhere.  Taste: heavy hop bitterness upfront, dry with a malty a hint of alcohol warming. Aftertaste is long and astringent almost like bile. Orange rind definitely not a palette cleanser.  Mouthfeel: silky and surprisingly juicy since the finish is so dry. The aftertaste is overwhelming.  Overall: stone is a west coast and craft classic. I feel as though the main purpose of these early ipas was to simply use the grain bill as a medium for the hops. I think if stone revisited this they would seek a certain type of balance. It's just that the battering hops dominate more than anything else. Still a good beer but not compared to others west or east coast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S — Smell is light initially, but there are some solid grassy and citrusy hop aromas evident. A bit of pine, lemon, and a light bready sweetness.  T — Lemon, pine, dry, crisp, a clean composition of hops, fairly light though, nice balance of everything.  M — Light-Medium bodied, ample carbonation, a clean finish.  O — One of the best classic examples of the style. Still manages to maintain relevancy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,KFBR392,4.55,"Appearance: A clean golden glow lights up this beer. About a finger worth of head throughout drinking. A tantalizing thick layer of lacing stuck to the glass. Carbonation played happily.  Smell: A perfect citrus aroma. Sweetness in the undertones of caramel, dark fruits, and molasses. Oh yeah, and the hops. Really knocks you on your butt, in the best way possible.  Taste: The hop bitterness bites on the front of this beer. The body is a magical combination of exotic fruits, caramel, molasses, pine, and a sweeter hop presence. The strong hops show up again in the end of this beer and make you appreciate what this beer brings.  Mouthfeel: Very dry, the hop presence in this beer really cleans off that palette. The sweetness in this beer finds its way into the mouthfeel.  Overall: This beer is everything that an IPA should be. Such a deep complex taste, simply wonderful. This beer was the first craft beer that really opened my eyes to truly great beer. I feel like Stone can almost get taken for granted being so widely available but they really bring it with all their brews, especially the IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It leaves a thick sheet over the top and chunky lacing on the glass. A fine looking beer.  S - 4.25 - Strong aroma of citrus-like and spicy hops, accompanied by a lighter note of biscuity malt. Clean and fresh first impression. The hops are spicy and herbal overall, not overly piney or catty.  T - 4.25 - Flavors are balanced between light, bready malt and sharp, spicy hops flavors. There's a light yeast note in the background. Dry, crisp finish. Exceptionally clean and slightly understated for a West Coast IPA.  M - 4.25 - Medium body. Smooth, creamy carbonation. Moderate hops bitterness lingers in the crisp aftertaste. Light alcohol presence.  O - 4.5 - This is a crisp, clean IPA that is more quaffable than it's ABV would suggest. The hops are the primary characteristic, but they are clean and herbal/spicy, making it more balanced and less overtly ""C""-hopped than many West Coast IPAs.

I really wanted to see what notes this beer would release if I let it sit and warm up for a few minutes. This turned out to be a good idea.  Aroma: Immediate hops, grapefruit on the front; warmth reveals pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, light malty finish.  Taste: BITTER, right into tropical fruits, light maltiness, then into a lingering hoppy, crisp, bitter, astringent, maybe a little spicy or cereal finish.  I was finally able to sit down with this one for a review. Quite a tasty West Coast type IPA; I was pleasantly surprised with the tropical fruit aromas and flavors, but this batch, at least, tends to stay on the bitter side.

Taste: Malty sweetness, followed by a distinct and noticeable citrus pine. Tangerine and grapefruit mix is what I sense. Not an overly bitter finish but there is no mistaken your drinking an IPA. I really like this one a lot.  Mouthfeel: Lively carbonation is present for this moderate body beer. All of the flavors blend so well across the tongue. I'm left with sweet malt at the finish when I was expecting the normal IPA bitterness. I definitely prefer the Stone finish.  Overall: In my opinion, this is one mighty fine tasting IPA. Though my favorite IPA is still Dogfish Head 60 minute, this definitely comes in a close second. Another fine beer from Stone Brewing Co.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,trxxpaxxs,4.2,"A: Pours a translucent apricot gold with one full finger of pure white head. The foam settles quickly, but the lacing is ridiculous. This beer looks great.  S: This beer smells super dank. It's huge pine, mild citrus, and even a touch of onion. I'm kind of blown away by how potent this beer is for a single IPA.  T: I am met with a touch of sweetness and a good amount of piney hops. It's watery and malty in the middle, but it comes back with a nice kick of hops.  M: Light bodied beer. Sweet... to big bitters and spice... to malt... to pine and dry.  O: This is a pretty incredible IPA. I can't believe it took me so long to try this beer. Call it East Coast bias, I suppose with staple like 60 and 90min. But I will drink this beer again, and recommend it to many a new beer drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Aewachiw,4,"This is a modest, yet outstanding IPA. On draft at Silk City in Philadelphia PA.  This beer has a lot of the qualities typically found in DIPA's. Citrus notes and a slight bitter that reminds me of a tasty grapefruit.  I would definitely order this again, and was a perfect pair for my Spicey Asian Tuna Berger.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Raime,4.05,"A - Pours dark gold, almost amber with a three finger white head. Left massive amounts of lacing.  S - Pineapple, mango, grapefruit, light toasted malt. Scents are a bit distant.  T - Quick shot of tropical mango and pineapple, slightly malty, and watery in the finish. Pretty on the fence about this one.  M - Medium creamy body with heavy carbonation.  O - Overall, I'm pretty sure that this was an old bottle. No flavors really jump at me. I've wanted this one for a long time and it's kind of a disappointment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FastBlondesBrewing,4.29,"My first review...  Reviewing a new to me IPA from an old favorite brewery.  Appearance: Poured a nice clean 1"" of head, very good lacing. Color is slightly darker than honey, mostly clear with a touch of sediment suspended.  Smell: I get mostly pine and citrus with slight floral and malt notes. Smells ""West Coast IPA""  Taste: Excellent IPA very true to style, good bitterness up front, medium carbonation malts present but definitely only in a supporting role. Pine, resin and citrus flavors predominate, excellent clean and dry finish.  Mouth: Slightly thick, but very drinkable. Not too heavy.  Overall: Excellent IPA, likely to be the best option in many pubs for that style. I put it in my top 10 for this category.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheMarkE,3.58,"Appearance: Attractive amber-gold color, good head and lacing.  Smell: Hops, citrus, pine.  Taste: Hops. Floral, pine, citrus, and then more hops. A touch of malt in the background.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, crisp, and incredibly bitter.  The Verdict: Meh. I love IPAs and I love hop bombs, but this is just too much of a bitter bomb for me. I picked it up hoping to change my mind about Stone and finally see what everyone loves about them, but thus far I’m still disappointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,retry4z,3.42,"Poured from a bottle into a standard beer glass, cold. Solid head, about 1 finger size that disappears quickly. Strong malty aroma with citrusy hints.

Initially sweet, and then very dry-bitter finish, not well balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zeledonia,3.93,"Bottle says enjoy by 02.26.13. Assuming Stone's 90-day shelf life, that means bottled around 28 November 2012. Strange that it's taken me this long to try this, one of the classics of the style.  Pours very clear bright orange amber (leaving the yeast in the bottle). One finger of white head, good retention and outstanding lacing. A thin curtain of bubbles pervades the glass.  Smell is really nice, a pungent but gentle piney hop aroma. Like sniffing a handful of pine needles, really, but it's backed with a twinge of acidic citrus. And there's a fullness that I really appreciate - this is no empty front-heavy IPA. The malts are surely second fiddle, but I know they're there by the solid base the hops are resting on.  Taste is pretty solid. Moderately bitter throughout, assertively but not aggressively so. Has a pronounced dryness, so that the flavor almost gets sucked out of my mouth. Lightly sweet, very grainy malt base.  Mouthfeel is enjoyable. Pleasantly dry, reminding me of a number of hoppy pale ales I've had recently. Starts out fuller, then gets progressively lighter as it dries out. Medium carbonation. At times unobtrusive, allowing the other characteristics to shine through, and at times quite enjoyable. Nice.  I like this, but for some reason it's feeling like less than the sum of its parts. Each element works, but they don't add to each other. I think I might like this much better on another day. As it is, I like it plenty well enough!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Efay,4.02,"A- Nice faded orange color that's translucent if you're using an average pint glass. About 1 finger of foam with lots of lacing left.  S- Smells of grapefruit and citrus are first and foremost, with some smells of bread and pine to finish it off.  T- Initial taste of hops and bitterness from the start that is composed of citrus, grapefruit, pines and some tangerines. The bitterness lingers but is not overwhelming, as the flavors end with a sweet bread taste.  M- Medium bodied with a small amount of carbonation. Seems sticky and thick.  O- As a young guy from the Midwest I was surprised at how enjoyable this IPA was for me. Definitely different from what we get around here. But different isn't necessarily bad. Really enjoyed this and can't wait to try more from Stone to see what they offer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,JohnnyJam,4.13,"My friend, Phil, gave me one on New Year's Eve. He didn't have a glass for me to pour it into and wanted to know my review as I drank from the bottle. I told him that I would have to reserve that for another night but I really enjoyed drinking this beer from a bottle (something I almost never do).  Poured from a brown 12 oz brown bottle with no freshness date into a pint glass and got 1 1/2 finger of rocky head.  A: Pours a dark honey color with an off-white rocky head that lasts to the end with more than just covering for the top of the beer: good head retention. There is lots of beautiful, slicky lace.  S: I smell grapefruit and grapefruit rind and some other maybe some othe fruits, maybe tropical fruit.  T: Grapefruit rind, pine, grapefruit is what hits me first. Then pine and I know this is a big IPA. It finishes with grapefruit rind and big pine taste. Very hoppy.  M: Goes down easy and smooth. This is a little chewy. The malts balance the extra hoppiness very well. Mildly carbonated.  O: I really like this beer. It goes down smooth and has a real hop bite. It reminds my somewhat of a Sierra Nevada Torpedo but with more bite and a more piny finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,arfenhouse,4.28,"A: Dark copper with a white head. Very strong lacing and retention. Lots of bubbles streaming towards the top.  S: Grapefruit, pine needles, slight skunkiness/dankness. Typical IPA smell all the way through.  T: Has a bit of malty/grainy sweetness which is quickly cut down by the hop taste. Grapefruit, citrus peels, and pine. Leaves an overall bitter aftertaste. Clean IPA taste with nothing that I can find offensive.  M: Feels to be medium bodied with a medium-high amount of carbonation. Dry and prickly on the tongue.  O: This is a very solid IPA that is definitely worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brewtus,3.98,"After trying a bunch of stones I figured I should step back and try the IPA. This pours light orange/yellow with a white head. The smell is a lot of citrus and pine, slightly yeasty. This tastes great, it starts and finishes with a consistently great hoppy dryness. The favors are typical; hoppy, piney, citrus, lemony, and the lack of malt makes this a crisp masterpiece. This isn't the best IPA ever made but I can see why this is a staple for stone, glad I finally grabbed one, I waited too long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scvance,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a golden, opaque, honey color with a large fluffy white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smells very strongly of hops, there are definite pine and earth notes along with a slight citrus. Taste is slightly malty sweet at first, but quickly fades to a strong hop bitterness. There are pine and resin characteristics. There is a nice long lingering bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly oily. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. This beer is very drinkable, although I discovered it is maybe too drinkable. This is turning out to be one of my favorite IPA's. It is very enjoyable and I recommend giving it a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jjamadorphd,2.98,"I heard so much about Stone IPA, now that I've had two different IPAs, I'm beginning to think IPAs are the brew for me...  Stone IPA pours out of the bottle an orange tinged amber, cloudy, but still appealing to the eyes. The head is small, has no staying power, but surprisingly laces all the way down the glass. The mouthfeel was very strong and overpowering on the carbonation - possibly the highest carbonation I've tried to date - it just detracted from the taste. The taste itself was IPA all the way - something I've come to terms with that I'm just not a fan of. Overall, it's a good beer, but not much better or worse than the other IPA I've tried.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

O-Overall a tasty IPA that I would not shy away from.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HerrDave,4.23,"My first review...  Appearance: A nice amber color with a decent white head that dissipates after a few moments. Nearly a perfect looking beer.  Smell: A very lovely hoppy smell with some hints of citrus.  Taste: A nice bitterness and quite a strong hoppy taste are what you first notice. As you continue to drink the beer the flavor evolves and their are some fruity hints within the taste. While a good taste for an IPA it could be a bit overwhelming to some people.  Mouthfeel: A good amount of carbonation with a medium body, goes down crisp and smooth.  Overall: On the bottle Stone brags about making then IPA ""deliciously hoppy."" I would say the emphasis would be on the hoppy and they succeeded with this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DaveAnderson,3.67,"I have one beer maxim: I'll never regret choosing Furious. Whether it's at a bar/restaurant, or in a liquor store, I am frequently faced with the dilemma we all face: a favorite -vs- something new. And while there's always something new to try, occasionally, you have to go to your go-to.  But then one day, you order your go-to, and someone else orders something you've never tried, and when you get a sip, you realize your go-to won't cut it anymore. Personally, I went from Summit EPA to SNPA to Two Hearted to Furious, where I've been stuck for about 6 years.  Well, Stone has been in the market for at least a year, and I have tried almost everything in their lineup. But somehow, plain old IPA has escaped my attention. And yet, I keep tripping over the notion (mostly in the BA forums, mind you) that Stone IPA is not to be taken lightly, that this, not one of the Bastards, is their flagship beer. That this may be the beer that causes me to think, as I take my next sip of Furious, that I ordered the wrong beer.  OK - the bar is set impossibly high. Let's go.  Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a Surly pint glass. It's a clear, golden liquid that produces a 3"" foamy head. It looks sticky, judging from the lacing as I swirl it. Nothing to write home about here, but if we're being honest, appearance is the least important factor in enjoying an IPA. How does it smell?  In a word, not bad. Yeah, that's a couple of words, but come on. This is supposed to to be a transcendent beer. I'm fairly certain that I am required to pronounce the quality of my beergasm by the end of this review. It's malty. It's hoppy. It actually smells bitter, if that's possible, It also smells vegetal. And I'm not getting much fruit to speak of. No citrus, nothing tropical. Man, this isn't looking good. But how does it taste?  Maybe a little better than it smells. That stickiness was not an illusion. The malt is strong in this one, and that means there's enough sweetness to deal with the bitterness. Well, there's enough to start, anyway. This is one bitter IPA.  And one bitter IPA drinker. Is THIS the legendary West Coast IPA that is supposed to make me swear off all pretenders? Please. The presence of this beer wouldn't even make me regret ordering a Two Hearted. I. Don't. Get. It.  Drinkability: Not bad, same as overall.  EDIT: For some reason, I decided to drink my last bottle of Stone IPA straight from the bottle, which is something I practically never do. I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy this beer considerably more than in a glass. So I am taking the rare step (possibly my first) of adjusting my rating. Taste and overall bumped my 1/2 point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little resiny from the hops, and the carbonation is mild.  O: This beer is so good after a long day. It delivers on bitter and juicy citrus and pine hop flavors.

The hops smell juicy and biting, citrusy and fruity and highly floral.  T – The flavor is idyllic. This is just a model IPA, grapefruit and lemon, grass and pine, and a lovely bitterness that just makes you want to stand up and give an ovation. Just a glorious IPA, bravo Stone.  M – The mouthfeel is medium in body and the carbonation gives it a silky smooth aspect; it is lightly sticky as well and dwells on the tongue and palate for a moment before going down. Great mouthfeel. Playful, fluffy, lush, dry finish.  O – This just so completely wonderful. One of the best IPA’s I have ever had, and, in my opinion, one of the standard bearers for IPAs.

With an aggressive pour I get a finger an a half if nice white fluffy head that dissapates nicley and leavs some nice lacing...  S: nice! Some juicy citrusy grapefruit and tropical fruit hop aroma, there is also a nice bit of grassy and piney hops all blendin together into a delicious blended hop aroma...  T: is much like the aroma, agreesively hoppy, the pine seems dialed up a few notches from the aroma, contributing a nice resinous butter pineyness to the brew, along with the Juicy mango/pinneapple citrus hop notes, this is delicious.... That are also some herbal grassy hops in there which come through blending with the malts. The only thing is, on the end, there is a yeast grainy bready note that comes through, that I wish just wasn't there, but overall this is delicious.  M: medium body with a nice crisp moderate carbonation that lightly stings the tounge. Overall this ipa is dry and bitterly resinous.... And very very drinkable...

Stone IPA was kind of like that chick in High School, who was cute but wasn't the most popular.Your captain of the football team and shes the trumpet player in the HS band. One day you decided to approach and shoot the shit and to your astonishment it goes pretty well. You invite her back to your place and the next thing you know your pants are around your ankles and your mumbling thanking some lost Babylonian god.  Thats stone IPA.  It has a smooth orange pour with a moderate amount of head. It feels really smooth in your mouth. You can really taste the hops along with the bitterness.

Piney, grassy hops on the nose and slick fruity ones in the mouth. Mostly tropical - sweet mandarin oranges and pineapple. Mouthfeel is just how I enjoy it - lightly carbonated, thirst quenching, but still leaves you looking for another sip.  Overall a damn good beer. Maybe even one of the best I've had to date.

The highlight of the look is the head and lacing though, which is absolutely awesome.  Smell: Earthy and spicy hops ... it's a hop bomb in the aroma department. Pleasant to say the least.  Taste/feel: At first sip, I got a hugely bitter taste, but the more I drank it, the more balanced and complete it seemed to get. Definitely huge on the hops (spicy, earthy, even fruity) which is always key for an IPA, and the malt cuts through the bitterness quite well. I do like this beer, but at the same time, I'm somewhat disappointed. The reviews on this site has it ranked among the best in the world, but it's just lacking something. I'm not sure what that something is, but beers like Racer 5 and Two Hearted have it ... this one doesn't. It's still a very good IPA that I'd no doubt have again, but I definitely feel that it's a touch overrated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Head rolls up and recedes into a thick ring. Stays with you the whole way through. The smell is a strong, but balanced aroma with a very strong hop foundation and a sweet, malty backbone. The Flavor is that of a very strong, floral hop, with a nice crisp citrus finish. Beneath it all a very sweet, but balancing malt character rounds it out nicely. Refreshing carbonation, but with a respectable heft on the mouth. Active but short-lived combination. All around great IPA that's easy to enjoy at any time, and more proof that Stone just makes thoroughly flavorful beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mojo,4.56,"This stuff is just wicked. It poors a full golden color with a small immaculate white head, awesome retention, and incredible lacing. The smell is the expected citrus with notes of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is just right, not thick and not thin. The taste follows the nose. I get that familiar grapefruitiness up front followed by those incredible hops on the finish with a satisfying aftertaste. Buy this stuff and enjoy if you have never had it.  (This is the exact same review I gave Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA. They are a lot alike.)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DesMoinesMike,3.48,"Glad to see Stone finally get into Iowa!  I was filled with intrepidation when pouring this into my perfect pour glass. It's a light amber color with 2.5 fingers of foam, almost overtopping my glass. The aroma is definitely hop-centered and strong, but not overly interesting. The flavor I was wather disappointed with. There was the acidity from the hops but not much flavor. I'm use to IPAs that have notes of floral, citris, mellon, honey, but there wasn't much of that at all. It seems the type of hops in there had a singular focus of the hop acidity but nothing else to add any entertainment or side-story.  It's a good IPA, but I've had many that are more interesting. It's not weak, but it's kinda boring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CloudStrife,4.28,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Enjoy by 10/24/12  A: Pours a hazy golden straw with whisps of orange and a 1.5 finger puffy white head. Some small bubbles are seen rising to the surface. Head sticks around for a few minutes, leaving nice lacing on the sides.  S: Get some pretty good hop notes right off the bat. A light fruitiness as well from the malts. Yeastiness and pale malts make up the backbone.  T: Great hoppy beer that doesnt completely smack you in the face with bitterness. The light malts back it up real nice. Lingers with some hop bitters at the end.  M: Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Doesnt leave a hoppy stickiness on your tounge.  Overall a wonderfully balanced IPA. Stone knows how to make IPA's and this is no exception. If you havent already, give this one a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hanglow,3.96,"330ml can, berlin brewed.  Pours bright gold, large head  floral fruity hops on the nose, needs a bit more though. lemony and lime  Full on hop hit in taste, malt just hangs on. Good bitterness but no excessive, fairly thin for the abv, high carb. . Bitterness lingers on, little sweetness  very good, nice to see in M&S",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,straygator,4.55,"Having overlooked this one for too long, I snagged a few pint bottles tonight. Poured slowly into a snifter, a beautiful soft, chunky head grew and settled into a lacey bead that lingered to the bottom of the glass. The color is tarnished gold. An initial fragrance of distant pine blooms into citrus and fades to spearmint. A clean, refreshing hoppy taste that is bitter enough to get your attention without that 'punch-you-in-the-Adams Apple' bite remained fresh. This IPA is one to spend an evening with preferably watching a sunset over the Blue Ridge mountains or the ocean at Cape Hatteras. I have had an epiphany...this is one not to be neglected.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DrinkSlurm,4.22,"Poured from tap into pint at Bulldog Midcity NOLA. Pours a nice hazy golden with crazy lacing and a good head. Smells of piney citrus hops...very hop forward. Taste is nice bitter hops, pine, citrus, bitter but sweet malts. Nicely balanced and a great IPA...I know im not the only one to think so. Go have one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GMB,4.5,"Stone IPA may set the standard for American Indian Pale Ales, which are renown (or notorious, depending on whom you ask) for their in-your-face hoppy characteristics and higher-than-average ABVs.  A delicate pour produces a thin head of white foam atop a translucent light amber body. The head does not stick around, but does leave a delicate and beautiful lacy pattern floating on top of the beer's body. I'm reminded of the flavorful oil that sits atop a cup of good, unfiltered coffee. I expect to be overwhelmed by flavor.  The nose brings a smile to my face. A bold bouquet of aromatic hops dominates, but is complemented by understated notes of biscuity malt and the faint, warming smell of alcohol.  The first sip of a glass of Stone IPA is an experience I'd like to have again. Resinous and aromatic hoppy flavors dance around the palate, supported by a fine balance of light malty sweetness and a powerful lingering bitterness. The bitter hang of this beer is not to be missed: It both sustains the piney, resinous hoppy aromas that appeared at the front of the sip and plays counterpoint to them as they continue to develop in depth and complexity. The hoppy complexity is accentuated by the warmth and bite of alcohol.  One of the difficulties in reviewing a beer this complex is that its flavor profile changes with each sip. Once the palate grows accustomed to the bitter hang and resinous, piney hops, it discovers the subtle fruity characteristics of the yeast. The malt is a bit overwhelmed at first, but begins to reveal its subdued sweetness as one comes to the end of the bottle. As the beer warms, the character of the alcohol becomes more pronounced and integrated, producing still more complexity by introducing warmth and a floral quality that adds complementary and sometimes contrasting aromas to the bouquet of hops that has been developing on the palate.  The mouthfeel of this otherwise stellar brew leaves something to be desired. On the first sip I felt the carbonation to be a bit harsh. The harshness did wear off with subsequent drafts and swirls; I found the proportion of fizz to malty body the most satisfying just after I had finished half of the bottle.  Stone IPA is not to be missed. I found it to be like unto cubist art, in which a single, clear perspective is abandoned in order that the object be viewed from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. There is too much happening on the palate to appreciate all of the flavors of this beer at once. Your perspective must be flexible, mobile, and willing to focus on particular aspects of the experience, perhaps at the expense of comprehending the beer's flavor in its entirety. Expect to be overwhelmed, challenged, enthralled and enchanted. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gcamparone,4.12,"Served on tap from Perry's bar and Grill in Narragansett, Rhode Island into a normal pint glass.  A - slightly hazy golden amber. Medium head that lingers  S- very floral with some citrus and pine notes in the background. Pleasingly hoppy.  T- Follows the nose with more citrus/grapefruit notes coming out. Well balanced and drinkable  M- Low carbonation, medium body  Overall very nice as expected. Easy drinking, balanced and tasty. Exactly what I want from an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JackieTH,4.42,"I've enjoyed many a bottle, but finally on-tap at the 2012 ABR. From notes.  Golden with a cap of white foam, good retention and lacing. Smell has a distinct tropical fruit bouquet with punchy orange/grapefruit zest and resinous pine, subtle mint and pale malt.  Taste is primarly juicy orange and grapefruit pith and resinous pine, not as much of the tropical fruits here. Slightly herbal. Bitterness is moderate, but not overpowering. Medium body that's brightly carbonated. Bitterness is respectful and doesn't blow out the palate, maintains plenty of hop flavor, with moderate bitterness is refreshing and juicy. Very, very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lordofstarside,4.57,"Probably my favorite ipa, only now getting around to reviewing it bottle with a 11/1 enjoy by date into a pint glass  Pours a dark gold with a silk white finger and a half of head. Retains quite well, laces beautifully down the glass. At the end of the beer I was able to see where I took each sip on the inside of the glass. Holding it up into the light there are tiny suspended shards of hops, mildly filtered. Mild carbonation spaced evenly along the inside of the glass.  Smell of strong hops, grapefruit, pine, some citrus, a hint of juniper, and some alcohol. Very mild malts in the background break through despite the potency of everything above. One of the best smelling beers I've had  The beer wastes no time and throws a huge hop flavor up front. Grapefruit, citrus, a nice tropical tinge peak through the after taste. Modest malts are nicely represented but the hops are what really take the spot light. With 77 ibus this is one of the stronger ipas I'm aware of, and is guaranteed not to be touched by anyone but myself at a party. Needless to say, not for people who aren't familiar with craft beer  Mouth feel doesn't disappoint either. Bitterness is upfront and wastes no time over whelming the palate. The carbonation is strong enough to give my tongue a tingle but not enough to distract or cover any of the flavor. Very dry finish, very drinkable  Overall this is one of my staple beers. It's cheap and holds over my hop fix between the couple double ipas I get each week. Something I do and will continue to buy often, this is my bench mark for west coast ipas",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,spoony,4.34,"From a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Enjoy by 10/30/12 on the bottle (i.e., not particularly fresh).  A-Pours a slightly hazy golden amber color. There is a thin white head that goes away pretty quickly, but the cap sticks around until the head.  S-Awesomely sweet pineapple with orange and floral highlights. There is a resiny fragrance of pine and hints of cut grass and wet hay. Delicious if you like em sweet.  T-The taste is not quite the floral, tropical fruit bomb that the smell would lead you to expect, but it is still pretty good. There is more herbal pine and sage in the taste. No malt to speak of. A slightly hoppy, bitter finish, but it is not mouth-puckering like a Ruination. I would imagine that a fresher bottle would hold more of the floral, citrus flavors.  M-Quite carbonated, but still drinkable without feeling like a helium balloon. This is not a resiny, greasy IIPA, but it is not a lightweight lager, either...just on the heavy side of medium bodied.  O-A really well-done IPA. The smell was the highlight for me, but the taste wasn't bad, either. I like Ruination, but this is much more drinkable and would pair better with food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,StonedTrippin,4.25,"yeah totally worth the hype. one of the most refreshing and delicious sessionable strong ipa's out there. this pours clear and bubbly, champagne looking. it smells like intense oily hops, lots of citrus in this one, some pine, northwestern to me, a little bite there as well. the flavor confirms, total grapefruit profile with some spruce, bitter and pithy, but balanced too. its got the same juicy acidic tart but sweet addicting essence you get from a fresh florida pink grapefruit. its uncanny how similar this tastes to that fruit. it gets real bitter in the end and more as it warms, and serves a thirst quenching role to perfection. this has a great feel too, light enough in body to drink a bunch of them, but a well hidden and dangerous alcohol strength. carbonation is bright, and it makes the beer feel lighter than it is. overall a nearly perfect india pale ale, one of the best stone beers out there and a classic for a reason. so many other stone beers are just slight deviations from this one, but i seem to always come back to the original in terms of preference...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,intensify,4.62,"Im going to keep this short so I can enjoy this soley!  The pour was a nice golden, burnt orange color. Tall and heavy head stuck around for some time and leaves lacing as I gulp it down. First off, the nose is amazing. Potent hops, resiny aroma, strong pine, orange peel and some more of that medicinal marijuana smell. Not a big hop monster but definately a piney one. Very well balanced and ends semi dry. Medium bodied delight in a bottle.  A must have. I expected greatness from Stone Brewing, but they have brewed a top contender here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ThePaleRider,4.5,"A - Dark yellow to light orange. Super clear with a white head. Very carbonated and keeps the head looking nice.  S - Very piney and citrusy. A lot of hops in there. Not picking up much of the malts, but that's ok with me. The more hops the better.  T - Super smooth with a little bit of a bitter bite. Very well balanced with the malts. A lot of hops in there, very piney flavor mixed in with some orange peel, and flowers.  M - Very light, love the amount of carbonation in there. Dangerously smooth for nearly %7.  O - Excellent IPA. Quite possibly a benchmark for affordable, everyday IPAs. Great job Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,TheRealBigC,4,"Nothing short of great, Stone delivers a fine IPA which, strength-speaking, really isn't too far off their double - Ruination. While still being decidedly less strong overall, this IPA is huge on hops. They dominate the nose and palate, leaving a sticky hop residue in the back of your mouth. Hopheads rejoice! Personally, I'd take Ruination over this one, but to get a 6 pack of this one is about 5 dollars cheaper, and I couldn't fault anyone for grabbing one. It is a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Might go right up there with pliny for a great ipa.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,micromaniac129,4.3,"A hazy, lazy amber colored brewed kissed with a touch of peach blush. On the pour I didn't really get that much in the head, though it is long lasting and leaves some spotty lacing. Carbonation is a bit light i think. Reading some of the reviews I was a bit disappointed in the aroma. I was expecting a knock down and it just didn't happen. It does have good aromatics, the hop bouquet is quite light.Citrus and grapefruit can be smelled, but it's an effort. That being said it smells good and is nicly balanced. A good balanced flavor untypical of a WCIPA. A good hop taste with floral and citrus notes plenty of sweet malts counteract the hoppiness. Not that it's bitter in the least. Drinks easy being smooth, semi dry and semi bitter. A very good well made beer Me thinks me likes.

I can honestly say that I love everything that comes out of this San Diego based brewery.... Stone I.P.A. has such a perfectly balanced hoppy taste along with a perfectly hoppy nose to match it.... With my increased pallete for beer over the years (generally, only giving beers of a 7.5 ABV or higher a chance), this is one I can always go back to because of its increasing availability....

The biscuity sweet malts float in and out of the palate but are overall inundated by the hops. Biting spice finish.  M: Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel with exceptional linger.

147,88,RussBecker1,4.46,"Served from a bottle to a pint glass at King Street Grill Charleston, SC  A- Nice golden haze with good carbonation and just the right amount of cloudiness...virtually no head whatsoever though, but this may be due to it being served to cold  S- probably the highest point of the beer. Absolutely loaded with hop spice that immediately fills the nostrils. Follows with that nice citrusy scents. This is what and IPA should smell like.  T- Follows through on the nose. Delicious hops fill the palate, but do tend to fade off towards the aftertaste leaving something to be desired. That being said that specific note does make this brew more drinkable over a long period of time than some other as it does not inherently blast your palate.  F-Nice, decent amount of texture nothing to really write home about  O- This is an IPA that is easily accessible throughout the states and more often than not should be your choice when opposed to the selection",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Living816,4.23,"The first time I had this, it was one of those huge bottles. I thought it was fairly bitter and unbalanced. A few months later, I thought to give it another try. This was a 12oz bottle ""Best Buy 10/1/12.""  Very nice appearance. Much lighter than I expected in color. A a fain tan, copper color. But quite a bit lighter than other beers of this style. I know it's quite difficult to make beers this light that have any substantial flavor so I appreciate the technical element in it.  The aroma is quite hoppy, but not as citrus or bright as the typical IPA. It's not your usual fruit bomb smell. A rich piney smell. Pretty standard IPA smell.  Taste is obviously quite bitter, given the style. But exceedingly smooth. Slightly malty. It has a nearly perfect balance of malt, hops, sweetness, and bitterness. Aftertaste is not present. The term ""aftertaste"" is perjorative term precisely because it sucks to have anything linger. I like to have the beer leave nothing but a nice memory after I swallow. This leaves a hint of hops but that's it. Absolutely no flavor of alcohol noted, which is commendable given the 6.9%. The belly says, ""Thanks for the strong beer, hands!""  The beer is a bit thicker than I would like.  Overall, quite nice. The taste is quite splendid. I would be hard pressed to find anything to fault the flavor with at all. Excellent product.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma: Citrus and passion fruit hops. Can definitely tell it is West Coast influenced.  Taste: Good bitterness, present but not overwhelming. Lots of grapefruit flavor from the hops. A little malt in the background. Definitely hop dominated, which hits all the right notes here.  Mouthfeel: On the lighter side of medium body which makes it superbly drinkable.  Final Thoughts: I've been eager to try Stone IPA for a while and didn't miss the opportunity when I saw it on the tap list. Lived up to all my expectations and then some! Really great West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JamesTurkey,4.3,"Appearance: Pours golden-amber and develops a nice head upon agitation. Pretty clear and crisp looking too.  Smell: Citrus. And berries... like, those mixed berry gummi candies. There's some pine too, but it doesn't overpower the fruit.  Taste: Lots of citrus and juice. There are occasionally hints of dried fruit (especially apricot, one of my favorite hop flavors), which is really spectacular. Leaves a slight lasting bitterness, like a lover's scent.  Mouth: As it gets warm, it gets thick and creamy. Not incredibly carbonated either, which is nice on the palate.  Overall, this is a damn fine beer.

147,88,BradtheGreat7,4.38,"Review taken from notes.  22 oz brown bomber style bottle with a terrific Stone label that screams quality and class with a typical description backside from the guys in Escondido. Poured into a signature Stone IPA glass, and another into a Stone standard pint glass.  A - Golden-orange colored body with the slightest bit of haze. It's shows off some fairly good clarity while still letting your eyes know it has some thickness to it. A shade just off of white head that is fluffy/frothy with a thick ring of lace after it sits. Lots of stickiness with this as it clings to the walls of my glass in a classy manner.  S - An abundance of hops of floral and citrusy notes in this aroma. Fruitiness creeps in along with a solid hop spice. Sweet malt base Sits in nicely in behind all the hoppiness.  T - loads of grapefruit and Pine like hops make for an assertive bitterness with a nice hop spice flavor. caramel malt backbone does a wonderful job of keeping everything balanced. Dry finish and a lingering bitterness top off a great tasting ipa.  M - a bit more full than medium in body. Quite smooth with a good thickness. Alcohol booZiness is detected, but just adds to the overall taste of this flavor giant.  O - one of the best west coast style ipa's you can get and it's fairly easy to get ahold of. Do the guys at Stone make a bad brew? I know I've never had one(I've had about all of them) so im guessing no. This is one of the west coast legends and I finally decided to give it the credit and respect it's due. The Stone IPA is a must try for those of us who love hops and want a damn good American IPA. I know it's one that's hard for me personally to pass up and the guys at Stone don't make it easy on me since this is a year round offering. It's just one of those all time great IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,southeastmat,4.6,"A: Amazingly you can see right through this beer, but you can tell there is much more to it. You can almost see the body of this beer.  S: Terrific hop blast up front - floral, a bit piney and a touch of tropical fruit.  Taste: Whoa. Great bitterness to begin and it doesn't stop. Just great hops here and enough malt to balance.  M: Clean. Refreshing.  O: One of the standards for IPAs. I've rarely come across any that are consistently better. It's almost always on point and when it's not I've found that it's due to freshness. Being in South Georgia we have to pay attention to labels - stores here are not quite up to snuff on craft beer. We're working on it though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hoplomachus,4.65,"This is my go-to beer. I want some in my fridge at all times. Even though this is a Stone, the hops are not overwhelming. The malt present makes the beer smooth and not as bitter as other Stone beers.  Poured into a glass the color is beautiful deep orange... but who cares, straight from the bottle this beer will not disappoint.  The aroma lets you know that there is a good deal of hops with citrus and a little of pine.  This beer does not coat your mouth too much, so that after a drink there is a crisp, refreshing finish.  Although the ABV is not as high and the hops are not as strong as some of my favorite IPAs and double IPAs, if I had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life, it'd be Stone IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JuicesFlowing,4.45,"Poured into a balloon glass from a 22 oz. bomber.  The beer is a ever-so-slightly hazy orangish/amber color. A nice one-finger cream colored head dissipates to a modest film with groups of bubbles in the middle. Sheets of lacing cover the glass, but this was after a few pours. The beer smells mostly of pine, with a touch of grapefruit to round it out. Taste-wise, this is how I prefer my IPA: a high concentration of woody pine with good citrus hops on the tail end. It's perfectly bitter and smooth in the flavors. The mouthfeel is dry and sharp. A small alcoholic burn is detected in the finish, but I mean very slight.  Overall, this is pure. It's good. It lacks variety in the flavor profile as all I get is pine and grapefruit, but there's nothing wrong with that.

147,88,ZippyThePinhead,3.96,"This is another of my go-to IPAs, and I'm glad to see so many others agree (judging by the scores here).  It is widely available, inexpensive, and a very easy-drinking beer. Refreshing, even. Trust me on that, as I'm having one as I write this. I can always find 22-oz bombers for around $4 here in SoCal as of this review date (8/2012). I can even find this on Amtrak (Pacific Surfliner, going between San Diego and points north). The nose is not as hoppy as some, and the piney, citrusy goodness isn't quite at the level of certain (more expensive, harder-to-get) competitor brews, but it is an excellent beer, no question about it. And best of all, I'm never limited to just a single bottle per visit, which is often the case with other competitor brews.  I also regard this as a very reasonable gateway IPA, which can be used to introduce non-hopheads to the wonders of IPA. I've converted more than a few folks myself, using this very beer.  The finish on this is not as quick and clean as I prefer, but it is still pretty good in that respect. I really don't get much of a malingering bitter aftertaste with this. And it's dry, not too malty. A great ambassador for the west-coast style of IPA.  Kudos to Stone for making an excellent, ubiquitous and inexpensive IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- hops...i'm not getting a whole lot more due to my sinus congestion. sorry for the lack of specificity.  T- Hop heavy with little to no malt balance. This is my father-in-laws favorite beer for this reason. he loves hops but does not really want it to be balanced with malt. It is very refreshing and there is absolutely NO bad taste in this brew. Hops are the highlight and they are done fantastically. Pine, mild citrus/grapefruit, with a good resin taste that sticks to the tongue.  M- Resin and a lingering aftertaste of hops. Oily finish. very crisp and very refreshing after a day with a heat index above 103*  O- A fantastic IPA that I can find no fault with. No taste detracts from the overall flavor. i prefer my IPA's a little more malty, but for what this is, it is fantastic. if you prefer hop heavy beers, but don't want to break the bank and you want more than 3....try stone's IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,threeviews,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (Best By Date: 09-11-12) into a Corsendonk logoed tulip glass...  A- Pours a crystal-clear yellow/orange with a beautiful 2-1/2 finger white, soapy head.  S- Piney resin and sweet tropical fruit (mango, papaya, pineapple) in equal amounts. As the head subsides (and as the brew warms), the sweet tropical fruits tend to dominate while the piney and resinous aroma plays second fiddle.  T- Wow...for an American (single) IPA, that is quite bitter! While the citrus is secondary on the nose, white grapefruit rind pummels the palate and continues right through to the dry and tacky finish...malt is nowhere to be found. Nothing left to do but take another sip!  M- Abundant carbonation allows the bitterness to infiltrate your palate while increasing the refreshing qualities of the brew. There is no question as to why this may be considered Stone's flagship beer (argument could be made for Arrogant Bastard as their flagship).  O- For an American IPA clocking in at 6.9% ABV and ~$10 a 6-Pack, I don't think you can find a better beer for the money...the exception being Union Jack from Firestone Walker. This is great stuff and should be a staple in every hop-lovers 'fridge...but be sure and get it fresh!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,boilermakerbrew,4.48,"I'm not a big IPA guy, but this is the epitome of the style. Great pour, retention, and lacing. Huge pine-scented nose. Light malt for the base, that balances the moderate hop bill well. Hops do not overpower, but provide a solid kick. Great weight for sessioning. Could throw a few back and feel great, while still getting the great flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IPApadawan,4.1,"Medium body, very strong tasting for a single IPA. However, it is very smooth once your palate gets used to the hops they use in the beer itself. For first timers, this is one that I highly recommend trying, and its priced just right. You can pretty much find this anywhere (depending on where you are located). Always recommend trying it in the 22oz bottles before buying 6 packs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JWU,4.08,"12oz. bottle poured into a tumbler glass.  A- a clear straw/orange/amber, with a pillowy white head, which sticks around and sticks all over the glass.  S- grapefruit and herbal/earthy/piney hops, a fruity yeastyness of sorts, and a bit of a caramel malt note.  T- Very bitter on the palette, hits hard up front with the herbal/piney hops, which give way to a bit of the caramel malt sweetness, but it's quickly overridden by the big piney/grapefruit hoppy end. Bitterness lingers awhile after the sip, perhaps a bit too long.  M- Excellent. Medium bodied, but smooth and almost syrup like. Quite dry on the finish for a single IPA.  O- a reference standard for the West Coast IPA. I could enjoy it anytime, anywhere, and it really hits home when I want a very bitter IPA (but don't feel like blowing my head off with Green Flash W.C.

147,88,viverlee,4.03,"I could be working tonight, some license review whatever. This beats the hell out of that.  STYLE: American IPA  ABV: 6.9%  LOOK: Lighter than expected, honeyed yellow. It reveals no hint of the body and balance to come. The lacing is fine with moderate retention. Moving on…  NOSE: Soft pine, pineapple, mangoes, orange peel, olive oil. Go on…  MOUTH: A real building beer. Sweet tarts, pine needles, backboned malt, playful carbonation. The mystery here is that the beachy nose doesn’t quite leave the pool bar. You could find that irritable. Or maybe intriguing? What I do know I want is a longer, more refined finish. There’s goodness to be savored that shouldn’t require an extra pull.

Creamy coconut-white head a finger thick with good retention and great lacing.  Smell - Strong hops on the nose, citrus and pine predominate, with some earthy malt aroma - weak, but there  Taste - At first, the hops predominate, with a lovely bitter citrus fruit, tropical fruit, and floral flavor bursting through. Touch of pine, and the malt appears in a small way. Then the hops finish their dominance and the malt starts to break through, with big lovely caramel and grain sweetness. Finishes long and dry on the palate with hoppy bitterness. Lovely balance of flavors  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, crisp, a touch creamy and oily. Slightly above average carbonation.  Overall - The King of West Coast IPAs. The hops are perfectly chosen to create a beautiful hop flavor profile that focuses on citrus and tropical fruits, but the malt makes a good showing as well. Perfectly drinkable and never disappoints. Highly recommended",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pillowy tight bubbles. Very good retention. Body is a hazy honey-orange and it looks like there’s some floaties in there. Above average lacing.  S: Primarily grapefruit and orange, but also some welcome tropical fruits. There are aromas of both sweetness and bitterness involved.  T: Follows the nose very closely. Tons of grapefruit, grapefruit rind, some orange and a hint of lemon zest. Sweet malt is there but not standing up to the waves of hop flavor very well. The aftertaste has noticeably bitter citrus rind.  M: Pleasantly bitter but pretty smooth overall for all the hop character that it has. Body is medium, texture on the oily side, carb average. Some astringincy in the finish. Surprisingly drinkable.  O: The definition of the west coast style. The flavors and mouthfeel worked very nicely together.

Slight but not over powering citrus notes. Finishes dry with the perfect balance of hops and malts which makes the aftertaste seem like a dessert.

Pine and floral hops from this one along with a solid malt base that work well together. There is some mild citrus and a touch of lemon along with some stronger grapefruit notes.  Much the same as the smell with a fair helping of pine hops and grapefruit that is quite bitter. There is a lot more citrus than with the aroma but not too much. It is rounded off with some earthy hops and light caramel malts.  Medium bodied beer with a smooth body and a lot of bitterness from the hops although it did seem well balanced despite this.

A rocky white head unfortunately leaves us very quickly but is nice enough to leave behind some beautiful lacing.  S: There are some subtleties tot his aroma I can't quite make out beneath the surface of your standard IPA scents: hops, citrus, pine. Maybe a faint malt or some more citrus is the responsible party, rounding out this scent. Though I wish it was a bit stronger.  T: Let it rest on your tongue. You'll detect beautiful citrus and malts that compliment the hops and pine very well. But as soon as you swallow, be prepared for an onslaught of hops. True to the Stone ethic, it's an intense taste, not for the faint of heart.  M: Very well carbonated and given an appropriate medium body, the feel is vibrant and robust.  O: A great sipping beer that grabs you and doesn't let go. It demands your attention and rewards you for it. Subtlety behind intense flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jjboesen,4.45,"The logo for this San Diego brewery is a gargoyle, those eerie stone creatures one sees perched along the roofs of great cathedrals, where they serve as rain spouts. Why? This is unimportant; what is important is that Stone produces great craft brew; this IPA is one of the best.  It begins in a luxuriant froth, spongy and shimmering, and slowly subsides beneath the glass rim, forming a sudsy crown atop a cloudy pool of gold. The nose detects faint whiffs of apple supplemented by myriad notes of butter.  However, the action occurs on the palate; there is an initial citrus explosion, containing various shards of lime and orange, which fades in a quick, but intense, bitterness provided by the generous dry hopping. Pleasant well-balanced mouthfeel brings to close a satisfying quaff and an important reminder of how great craft brew should taste. Still, you gotta love them gargoyles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Darkmagus82,4.32,"Poured from growler into pint glass  Appearance – The brew pours a nice golden color, with a thin white head. The head fades rather fast and gives way to a very light amount of lacing.  Smell – The aroma is a nice mix of caramel, bread and a blend of citrus (mainly grapefruit in nature) and pine hop.  Taste – The taste starts out of sweeter caramel and a nice smooth bread flavor. There is a nice citrus hop present up front, that begins losing ground to some of the sweeter tastes more toward the middle of the tongue. While it temporarily loses ground in the middle, more toward the end it intensifies again and mixes with a pine flavor, which in the end, leaves a slightly sweet hop flavor on the tongue. It is quite pleasing.  Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is above average in creaminess and the carbonation is right about average. The carbonation is good for the exciting hop flavors, but the creaminess is good for the malty and sweet. Together it is a pleasant feel.  Overall – A nice easy drinking IPA. It’s not over the top in hop, or lacking either. It is a good session IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Melikeydahop,4.59,"If you would like to know how this beer tastes, looks, or smells please feel free to read the 2500 reviews that came before mine. What I can say is that the only beers I keep in my fridge with the exception of some Hoegaarten (for my wife..she likes it with lemon) are APA's and IPA's. Me likey me ales pale and hoppy. I'm no expert but I've tried many of them and I know what I like and what I do not. And I like Stone IPA. For you IPA newbees don't be scared off by the 6.9% abv, it's pretty much unnoticeable.  I'm a huge proponent of putting APA's and IPA's in the freezer for about 15 minutes before drinking them. There is just a crispness with these type of beers that is accentuated by drinking them very very cold. However, by the end of the beer, when it warms up a bit you really know what you have. Lesser quality APA's and IPA's tend to lose that crispness as well as show their alcohol content once the beer warms. So if it still tastes good and not so boozy when it warms you have yourself a real winner. And that's what you have with Stone IPA. Super delicious when ice cold..still pretty darn good when piss warm...can't say that about many beers. If you haven't tried it and enjoy hoppy beers, get on it my good people, you'll be glad you did. Good thing about this one is that you can find it at almost any liquor store.

147,88,Raven3464,4.53,"Appearance: The beer pours a clear, golden body with a two finger head. The clarity is amazing. Why do Stone Ales always look so good?  Smell: Malts, pine, and grapefruits dominate the nose. There is a ""buttery"" aroma as the beer warms.  Taste: Sweet malts are noticed early followed quickly by a citrus hop bomb. The fruits do not stand out as much in the taste as they do in the smell but the earthy hop flavor in the after taste is heavenly.  Mouth feel: It is medium bodied. There is just enough carbonation to refresh the taste buds after the hop explosion. The feel invites another sip.  Overall: This is a near perfect representation of the style. Bottom line, Stone knows how to make pale ale, IPAs, and double IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,thegodfather1076,4.97,"This beer was served out of a 12oz. bottle dispensed into a glass....  Presentation - Stone label and artwork are just the coolest. Label is painted or embossed not sure which. Gives it top notch feel and look.  Appearance - Pours out a golden yellow/orange color with surprisingly dense 2 finger white foam head. Head retention is about average, sticking around for about a minute before dissipating into an airy foam covering. Leaves excellent lacing.  Smell - Smell is truly amazing. A HUGE aroma! Smells of strong citrus hops with hints of tropical fruit. IMO, falls more on the Piney hop side than the floral hop side. Very faint hints of malt scent throughout.  Taste - Taste is just as amazing as the smell. A malty start gives way to intense hop flavors. The combination of citrus/piney/sweet tropical fruit-like hop bitterness is amazing!  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Starts off very crisp before turning smooth slightly creamy on the back end.  Drinkability - Smell/taste/mouthfeel combo make this extremely drinkable. Cant just have one!  Best IPA that I have ever had and one of the best beer I have ever had PERIOD!

147,88,flayedandskinned,3.81,"Best before date 7/16/13 Poured into the Sierra Nevada/Dogfish IPA glass.  Appearance: Pours a crystal clear straw yellow with some orange highlights. A voluminous, 3 fingers tall pure white head forms slowly as the beer is poured into the glass. Amazing head retention and the head leaves absolute curtains of lace as it slowly recedes.  Aroma: Some faint juicy grapefruit, spicy notes of pine and a dark, earthy onion note before you're greeted by quite a substantial, bread-like maltiness with noticeable yeast esters to round off the surprisingly low key aroma(for Stone, that is) This smells like somewhat of a traditional English IPA made with American hop varieties.  Taste: Right up front your palate is greeted with some classic American hop characteristics; juicy grapefruit, orange, and spicy, resinous pine, but just as their flavors start to grow stronger and stronger, a sizable, very bready and biscuity malt backbone rises up and helps lesson the bitter bite from the hops. The beer finishes dry with a strong, assertive bitterness with lingering notes of pine resin, grapefruit rind and even more breadiness left dancing on your palate.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate to high carbonation.  Overall: Stone takes the malty English IPA style and marries it with some in-your-face American hops(Cascade, Chinook and Columbus). I wish the hops were a bit more bright and aggressive, but the hops that really showcase those ripe, juicy characteristics that most 21st century hop heads crave weren't bred during time that Stone came up with this very balanced and dry IPA recipe.

It's a very bright and inviting smell. The flavor is fantastic. The big malty sweetness is balanced by big hop flavors. The citrus flavors accompany the sweetness into the mouth while the piney bitterness hits the back end. It's incredibly well balanced.

147,88,RppIII,5,"Appearance: This beer was served in a 16-ounce pint glass. When poured from the tap a handsome, ivory white head formed the width of two fingers and held steadfast for a delightfully pleasant amount of time, which allowed me to fully immerse myself in the consumption of this divine nectar.  Smell: At first, one might assume that the aroma emanating from the beer is just like every other IPA they have ever had and they would be utterly and completely correct! There is so much complexity in the odour of this beer but it still has been crafted with an uncanny sense of refinement. These guys knew what they were doing; so much so that they bottled it and sold it and the rest is history.  At first you get hops, beautiful hops, spicy hops, earthy hops, piney hops, fruity hops. Mostly, hops….  Taste: The taste of this beer is utterly and perfectly sublime. The hops, much like greed in the politics of today, been ubiquitous throughout every aspect of this beer and the flavour factor is no different (77 IBUs!). Think of this beer as a massive earthquake formed deep in the ocean that generates a tsunami with each subsequent after-shock continuing to create wave after wave for a significant period of time.  Immediately, your mouth puckers and is slammed with a tidal wall of spicy hop flavours (thank God for the colonization of India and the invention of dry-hopping). After the initial onslaught, the aftershocks, while not quite as intense, come in waves of varied hop flavour for several minutes after the first drink. As the spice begins to give way, there is a sense of floral earthy flavours, and a hint of citrus, a beautiful creation, indeed.  Let’s not forget the little guys who make this whole process possible, our yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae give a tremendous finale, imparting their own unique flavours amongst the hop invasion. The malt is in perfect harmony with the hop characteristic, moderately sweet in comparison to the hops.  Mouth-feel: The feel of this beer as it is consumed should not be compared to a tsunami nor an earthquake but to that of a baby’s bottom. While I have never actually felt the aforesaid, I have heard tale of the unequaled smoothness of such and this beer is no different, smooth. In fact, it is absolutely the smoothest liquid I have ever consumed. The finish leaves your feeling like you just spent the day wandering in the desert but at 6.9 ABV that is expected.  Drinkability: Many a night I have slumbered yearning for just such a beer and, seemingly as a phantom, this beer, doesn’t seem real. The Holy Grail, seemingly something not quite attainable for any brewmaster, those Arrogant Bastards at Stone must have found the chalice and used it in the crafiting of this beer. It is addictive and their creation continues to haunt my palate every second I deny myself of it. Simply put, once consumed it will consume you.

147,88,brotherloco,4.2,"22oz bomber. Served in a tapered 22oz glass.  Pours a slightly hazed pale orange-gold. A nice two finger off white head sticks around for a bit and never completely goes away. A moderate amount of complex lacing left behind.  Aroma of bright west coast hops. Citrusy, a bit dank. Caramel malt in background.  Taste hits the same notes as in the nose, but cranks things up in intensity. Citrusy and bitter, solid caramel malt backbone. A little sweet in the middle, but finishes pretty dry. Lots of lingering bitterness. Relatively big ABV is well blended.  Medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. Easy to drink this one down quick.  Absolutely a definer of the west coast style IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T - Very nice herbal, spicy, and piney hops strike you first followed by a nice sweet malt note to balance the flavor with a touch of alcohol near the end with nice smooth bitterness to finish.  M - Medium-full body, moderate carbonation, super smooth and crisp.  O - Such a great IPA I could drink this any day of the week!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZethOfTheNorth,4.54,"12 oz bottle poured into a mug. 6 pack bought at Rouse's in New Orleans for $9.69.  A: Looks like an IPA. Just barely lighter than the Torpedo I had before this. Not much head, but nice rocky bubbles. Pretty Jackson Pollock lacing.  S: Smell is citrus and hops heaven. Absurdly aggressive. One whiff and you know it's a Stone IPA.  T: Classic IPA citrus fruit (esp grapefruit) bitterness first, then a split second of malts, then that loooong hops finish that lingers forever. This isn't necessarily the most complex IPA, but it's incredibly refreshing. It tastes ballsy and great.  M: Very dry. Quenching. Carbonated perfectly.  O: My nomination for best bang for your buck IPA that's available nationally. Appropriate during all seasons, really all the time. An total craft beer classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,natemort13,4.1,"Poured into a tulip, best before for another month...lets do this then.  Pours a chill hazed golden orange with a big pillowy slightly off white head that leaves ridiculous spiderweb lacing as it fades away.  Nose is absurdly floral with hints of grapefruit and tangerine and a beautiful pine backbone to it. Nice orangey characteristics as well. The hops become slightly dank as I lean in for a closer little sniff. Orange pith, grapefruit, pine resin. Damn!  Dank into citrus into floral with a very smooth cereal chill hop finish. Very juicy hop presence on the mid palate. Finish is crisp and bitter but doesn't linger a ton.  Mouthfeel seems just a tad thin to me but it stands up to the hops well enough so it still works.  Overall, I've gotten so distracted by all the west coast ipas since I moved out here I forgot about my ipa roots. Thank you stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

M- Clean smooth mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Very easy drinker.  O- This has been one of my go-to IPAs over the past 6 years.

Hints of malt and vanilla hiding way back. Taste is hoppy, citrus, cardboard and some light malt and pine. Warming from the get-go, almost full-bodied, smoother than expected, not a heavily hopped either. A good brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,raynmoon,4.03,"It looks really nice in the glass, a soapy sort of head however.  It smells very inviting though. It has a nice amount of malt backbone I can already tell. A little fruity, but more pine and lemon/ orange notes than anything. Maybe I'm picking up a coriander type smell, it has a little punch to it. Maybe that is the alcohol coming through.  The taste is sort of the same for me. Lots of hops up front, kind of spicy, but probably from the alcohol, but very drinkable.  I'd buy it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Forb,4.35,"Poured from a bottle...  Appearance: Beautifully clear golden body with a deep fluffy froth of a head. Sticky lacing lathers the glassware with every sip.  Smell: Strong pungent aromas of both piney, freshly cut grass bitterness and citrusy sweetness.  Taste: This is where the beer proves its reverence. Amazingly clean on impact with an explosion of the aromas found in the smell. Malt comes forth first with it's slightly nutty foundation only to be built on by the complex hop flavors of fruity sweetness and piney bitterness; the latter maintaining through the finish.  Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation with a nice creamy body that goes down deliciously smooth.  Overall: Probably the best session IPA I've had the pleasure to drink. Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tony223366,4.3,"A: Golden yellow color with perfect clarity. Nice action from the carbonation. Three+ fingers of white, fluffy sticky head. This is a really good looking beer. Nice lacing and great head retention. You can't ask for much more. Maybe a slightly more complex color but that's being extremely nitpicky.  S: Huge aromas are jumping out of this beer. Big citrus and piney hop aromas. It's really fragrant and smells so inviting. It's really fruity and delicious smelling.  T: This beer is so worthy of the praise it receives. It's so bright and floral. The hops are really clear in their complexity. Huge citrus and piney flavors. Their are herbal qualities to it as well. But just before it reaches that point that it becomes harsh it takes a step back and you get some nice bready malts. The finish has a nice even bitterness.  M: Medium mouth with actually fairly light carbonation. I would have hoped for just a bit more carbonation.  O: I'm so excited to finally review this beer! This was seriously my very first go to beer. An expensive one, but I drank this week after week before I knew anything about beer. I just knew I liked this. Even now that I'm more beer geeky it still holds up fantastically. Worth every penny.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,July2Nov,4.13,"Appearance: Light amber in color (think apple juice) with a frothy, 2 & 1/2 finger big bubbled head.  Smell: Lite citrus with a strong piney hop aroma.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Great spiced flavor from the hops giving me a lemon and grapefruit taste with the back end of it leaning more toward the heavy end (pine) of the hop profile. This is a very smooth and crisp IPA with less bitterness than I was anticipating. Has a medium mouthfeel, especially in the middle part of the beer where it feels like a touch of velvet on the throat. Easily drinkable!  Overall: Stone's IPA is world renowned and highly rated for good reasons. It's classic in it's delivery and taste and it's easy to see why many a beer lover has fallen in love with IPA...a classic in every sense of the word.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,MichPaul,3.9,"Maybe this bottle was a little older, they say that hops fade over time. Nothing struck me as spectacular with this beer. It really didn't feel like an IPA to me but rather a plain ol Pale. Not a bad Pale, but just a pale. A-Pours nice, just a typical cloudy bronze. S-The smell was nice, nothing that blew me away, but did have a nice aroma. T-Again, nothing spectacular. Not much bitterness really to speak of, most IPAs seem to have more hoppy flavor. M-The carbonation and such seemed about right. O-Overall, this beer was just OK for me. Not sure why, as an IPA, this gets such a strong rating... If it was just a Pale Ale, I could see it though. Not a bad beer though. I did enjoy it, just have had much better in the IPA class.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mscudder,4.03,"Poured into a sweetwater pint.  A - A cloudy straw yellow with a fair head. Leaves some lacing, overall a beautiful IPA.  S - Grapefruit, hops and some pine. All the scents are controlled, and not too complex.  T - Lots of piney hops here. They leave a nice bitterness towards the end, but are certainly not overwhelming. I prefer a bit more citrus to my IPA, but this one screams quality.  M - A light and almost thin body with this one. I prefer a bit more depth, but the carbonation is on point so its far from poor.  O - Overall this is one of my favorites from Stone. A balanced, perhaps a tad hoppy IPA that is widely available for around $10 a 6-er. For the price, I don't think you can get much better per brew while staying moderate with all the beer's characteristics. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

O: Classic IPA, always dependable when its fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DM1293,4.2,"Whenever I think Stone, I think big bold strong, sometimes bitter flavors.  This IPA contradicts that. While beers like Ruination and Arrogant Bastard do everything they can to hit your palate, this one is rather subdued and lets the classic flavors of an IPA play on the palate. Not so much a citrusy hop than a piney grassy one, with a very mellow bitterness on the backswing. More of a plain malt on the front. A really good mix of flavors from beginning to end.  Overall, maybe not an iconic IPA, but definitely a good benchmark. I'd like to think of this as an introduction to Stone, because its still a pretty strong hoppy-flavor compared to other IPA's I've had, and this is the weakest of their stuff I've had so far, relatively speaking of course.  Worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PhantasIPA,4.42,"The appearance is a clear, golden color with a head that pours very thick and dissipates quickly. Even thought the head was thick in the beginning, it was present for the entire time at about a quarter of an inch.  The smell is hoppy with citrus notes, but not too powerful.  The taste is a strong, classic hop flavor. Not too piney, not too much citrus, but right down the middle of all three flavors. The finish is bitter like a medium strength IPA should be (or is expected to be) but not over powering.  The mouthfeel is just fine. It is not carbonated, not thin, and goes down smooth.  Overall the beer is a solid IPA. It is smoother than most IPA's but has all of the excellent aroma and flavor qualities of a classic IPA. Try it, it is worth it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: The aromas I typically associate with a west coast IPA, citrus and pine hops and a lot of it.  T: Wonderful hop flavor to this beer and a lingering bitterness in the finish. Lots of citrus and pine notes.  M: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp.  O: Easy to drink and very refreshing on this unseasonably warm evening in early March in NYC.

Perhaps I should have consumed this earlier. A small amount of grassy hops come in during the aftertaste.  MF- Crisp, with a balanced feel to it.

While I am looking for the former in an IPA, I am also seeking a bit more body, as well as greater refreshment in the flavor, feel, and aftertaste, which the use of hops here slightly intrudes on.

A bit simple for me, but what it does it does well.  Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. A bit oily.  Overall, a good IPA but not up to its reputation in my opinion. The hops are nice and it is a good beer, but I would like more of a malt presence to accompany the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell - Floral and classic Stone grapefruit-like citrus hops dominant the aroma.  Taste - A hoppy, bitter grapefruit flavor dominates throughout, with subdued notes of sweet malt peaking through from time to time. A bit of orange peaks through as well. Simple and clean, but very tasty.  Mouthfeel - There's just enough malt to give this IPA some body, and the carbonation is right about where it should be.  Overall - There's nothing complex about this IPA, but it's clean and it catches the taste buds just right. I'm a big grapefruit guy, so the flavors in this beer are right up my alley.

The head is modest, about a finger thick, and is made of white foam. Good lacing is left behind.  Lots of citrus hops greet my nose as I inhale this beer's scent. It is mostly grapefruit and lemon, but there is also a minor malt sweetness present.  This is a fine tasting West coast IPA. Lots bitter hops throughout the flavor. The malt backbone is hardly tasted. What is there is a hearty bread flavor, but it is small compared to the hop oils.  The beer has a medium body and a perfect level of carbonation that complements the bitter tingle of the hops. A slight coat is left behind that has some hop residue.  This is a top notch IPA. I don't think I can find any fault with it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell: Pale malts and orange juice. Fresh squeezed. A nice floral component over some bready malts. Lots of orange. Some zest. Marmalade.  Taste: Pith and orange zest mingle with a fresh juicy orange flavor. Nice punch of grapefruit prevents it from slipping too far to orange. Lingering bitterness. Malts are chewy and throw fresh bread more than anything. Very clean.  Mouthfeel: Decent mouthfeel. Leaves a little to be desired in terms of body. Carbonation is nice and helps the hops disperse.  Overall: Easy drinking IPA and then some. Lots of flavor, but easily drinkable in quantity without experiencing fatigue.

You know, everyone picks up ""grapefruit"" and ""citrus"" and ""hoppy bitterness""-- except for a few people who pick up different scents and tastes.  I can't say I noticed anything vastly different than the horde of other reviewers, except that the finish left a lingering taste of roses and hibiscus in my mouth and nose. Objectively speaking, I'm just not that impressed with the appearance. There's nothing about its appearance and presentation that's exceptionally noteworthy. Oh well.  Yes, everybody else is quite appropriate to laud this beer. It's a fine IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation. The beer coated the mouth for several seconds after each sip.

Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, apricot, mango, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, honey, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness.

Zero warming alcohol for 6.9%. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modestly bitter/resinous/drying finish, never overly aggressive. Even with the new dry hops they added for the 1.1 version, it still tastes like the original Chinook/Centennial hop profile the most.

S - Hops burst with citrus and pine, very well balanced between the two (this being one of the first IPA's i can really find myself thinking grapefruit as opposed to orange)  T - Very similar to the aroma with the malt flavor coming forward more than i expected based on the aroma. This balances out the flavor profile extremely well.  M - Light to Medium body with a drying finish.  O - This west coast IPA really shines in my opinion.

147,88,hagbergl,4.15,"Appearance (4/5): Bright orange, huge three finger white head. Lots and lots of lacing. Head reduces to an eighth inch white rim.  Smell (4/5): Sweet bready crystal malt, piney and grapefruity scents. Not super-complex, just very hoppy.  Taste (4.25/5): Exceptionally bitter and grapefruity. Pine also shines through. Grapefruit pith in the finish. A paragon of west coast IPA flavor. Sweet malt backbone acts as good counterpoint to the heavy hopping, but it solely functions in a supporting role.  Mouthfeel (4/5): Mouthfeel is medium light, perhaps lighter than other West Coast IPAs for its exceptionally light, unobtrusive malt bill. A resinous, dry finish lingers for days and has an aftertaste of pink grapefruit rind.  Overall (4.25/5): Still a wonderful beer. I do at times when drinking this beer wish for more body and more malt. Other beers, like Green Flash West Coast IPA, have a more prominent malt bill, which I favor. That being said, Stone IPA is a true trailblazer. It remains one excellent IPA, particularly when enjoyed with a month or less of age on it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A - One inch of white, fluffy head with excellent retention; The color is a mixture of caramel and straw; Clear appearance; Nice lacing left behind  S - Very light and floral in the smell; Other hints of hops are there too: pine, grapefruit, and later pineapple; Toasted toffee lurks beneath the hops  T - Nice dose of bitterness up front that weakens towards the end of the taste; Lots of hops present as well with floral, pine, pepper, lemon, and pineapple flavors; Toasted caramel and toffee is able to peek through the hops near the end of the taste  M - Just above moderate carbonation; Just under medium bodied; Slightly dry finish  O - This is the first Stone IPA I've had in awhile, and it still doesn't disappoint. There's actually more bitterness in this beer than I remembered from before, but that's certainly not a bad thing for me. The hop flavors are delicious, with a good showing of the floral and pine varieties, which make this a very uplifting and drinkable beer. This brew has always been one of my favorites, and will continue to be one I come back to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JohnnyP3,3.8,"22oz bomber with an enjoy by date of 01.22.12. Should have looked at that more closely when I bought it. Anyways, pours a hazy orange-gold with about 3 fingers of white head that simmers to about one. Great lacing on the glass.  Smell -- one of the best IPA aromas I have had the pleasure of inhaling. Deliciously citrus--grapefruit--in character with some pine. Also hints of pineapple juice.  Taste -- not quite as bitter/pungent as expected/hoped for. And that may be because of drinking this about a month after the recommended date on the bottle. I really thought this stuff moved off the shelf pretty quickly, so I didn't even bother to check. Or it could be that I was expecting something with more IBUs, like an imperial IPA. Back to the beer--has a good malty/biscuit backbone that the hops are just able to punch through. Still has some pungent citrus flavors--grapefruit/pineapple/tangerine--and finishes slightly dry with some crisp bitterness.  Mouthfeel is crisp with some oily slickness from the hop oils. The body is slightly thin. Somewhat lacks the pucker factor I was looking for. Overall, this one is still good, despite a little age on it, but I will have to seek out another one that is fresher and adjust my review accordingly if warranted. Compared with other American IPAs, it definitely holds its own.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Drinkerofales,3.85,"Pours almost clear light golden, with straw colored highlights. A large almost white head leaves some nice lacing.  Smell is understated with orange citrus, and not much else.  Taste follows the aroma, citrus that is not overpowering, with a hint of pith.  Feel is smooth and easy to drink. Crisp and dry.  I drank this after the West Coast IPA from Green Flash, and let's just say, the Green Flash blew this out of the water like a cheep blow up toy. Still a fine beer, just normal, not special.

147,88,HopHeadRyan,4.46,"Stone IPA - -  A - Hazy golden yellow…awesome creamy-froathed head…sticky lacing…  S - Not sure the age on this bottle…but if I get close to the head it smells like what it would smell like to be in the middle of a hop garden on a hot and humid late summer evening…beautiful flower hop aromas…dank, grassy, pine resin, and some citrus…superb…  T - Like chewing on fresh hops in the best possible way…a lingering bitterness…truly superb hop utilization!  M - Creamy medium-full bodied almost cask like quality!  Ovearll - A masterful IPA that sets the standard for the aggressive end of the IPA spectrum…In my dream pub I would have this on fresh on CASK 24/7.

147,88,thecheapies,4.44,"I do not see a bottle date.  Hazy light coppery color with a fluffy bone-colored head. Quite stunning lace/stickage. Also, remarkable retention. Looks like an IPA, and I'm about to find out that it smells like one, as well.  Fresh pine needles, grapefruit, saltwater, meadow grass, and lilac. A very sea-breeze smelling IPA. Some quaint floral notes behind the heavy pine make for great complexity.  Big yellow grapefruit hop rush, out the gate. Also, some woody pine notes that blend nicely with the citrus. Background floral suggestions create imagery of a spring seaside garden. Pleasant saltiness in the back of the throat in the finish. No off-flavors detected. Just a beautiful, clean, and refreshing libation. Medium-high bitterness is long-lasting and semi-dry. Faint hints of lemon and ginger. Outstanding.  Assertive carbonation that isn't abrasive. Medium bodied and wet and surly. High on the 'drinkability' factor'.  Holy smokes! Been awhile since I've last had one, and I have no idea why. When I started getting into IPAs and hoppy beers, I always proclaimed Stone IPA to be favorite of the style and most appealing to me. This may still hold true after all these years... I mean, it definitely sits in my Top 5 of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T-Citrus tang with a touch of pine and malt backround. Definately hop forward just as I like it.  M-medium body and good carbonation right to the end. Slightly stickey-sweet, then a great bitter hop finish. Cool and wet.  O-An outstanding IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Dave1999,4.08,Came in the glass a cloudy yellow colour with a small white head.  Smell was very faint I could get hops along with grapefruit.  The taste with pretty bitter with some hops and malts.  Felt very smooth in my mouth with very little carbonation.  I tried this right after drinking a bear republic racer 5 for the first time and thought the racer 5 was slightly better.

147,88,tylerprince,4.07,"Gave the draught version a 4.55. This was from a fresh bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a beautiful light copper, clear with a one finger white head. Foam fizzles away immediately but leaves a great lacing.  S: Strong. Primarily hop aromas - a grassy combination of floral and citrus.  T: Tastes like it smells, with a very subtle malt backbone. Perhaps not quite up to par with the on tap version, but excellent for a bottled beer. Bitterness lingers, as does the alcohol.  M: A tad overcarbonated for my taste, and thus a bit thinner than I might like.  O: A great beer; one of my favorite IPAs. In comparing to draught from notes, this one holds its own but is considerably better on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dools9,4.3,"Poured into a shaker...  A: Pours a honey, golden yellow with a bit of haze. Finger of white head that maintains fairly well, sticky lacing left over the glass.  S: Definitely getting alot of grapefruit and citrus aromas with maybe just a hint of foresty pine. Not a super, over powering smell but very, pleasant. Lets you know its a west coaster.  T: Citrus and orange rind hop bitterness, some resiny pine as well. A touch of malt sweetness keeps it in balance. Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness and a bit of alc. Very well balanced and not overwhelming in terms of bitterness.  M: Medium bodied, drinks very smooth and creamy. Actually pretty refreshing, a warm weather staple.  O: A pricey brew but worth it. An outstanding ipa and I will most definitely revisit in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dac0152,3.98,"Had this beer many times, just now reviewing it and throwing aside all former notes to focus on just this bottle.  Stone IPA fills the glass with a gorgeous golden haze and the bubbling, foamy head sticks to the sides of the glass leaving lace marks the whole way down. This beer looks fantastic!  I smell a lot of orange and grapefruit. A lot. There is a slight pine aroma, but, even though it's an IPA, my nose is upset by the complete absence of any malt; there's no sweetness, no grain character, nothing. Sad. Malt adds so much. Oh well, still smells pretty good! I really wish there was a '3.75' but there's not, so I'll bump it up to 4.0.  Grapefruit and orange still dominate this beer but, unlike the aroma, the malt sticks its neck out to balance this puppy out. Definitely on the bitter end, almost like biting into an orange rind, but delicious. Some pine sneaks its way into the flavor as well. As Larry David would say, ""prettyy prettyyyy pretty goood."" I have had better, but I still enjoy this thing.  Not a whole lot of carbonation (a good thing), and it leaves a nice bitter taste lingering on the tongue. I'm gonna give this a 3.5 because, while decent, it's not anything spectacular and, once again, I've had better.  TL;DR - Lots of citrus, pretty in balance with the malt, though nothing kicks me in the mouth. Pretty good, but there's better for the money. I still love you, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,demuzik,4.85,"This is one of my all time favorites - drunk it forever, realized I never reviewed it:  An inviting light orange in appearance - crystal clear and well carbonated. Head retention is wonderful on these.  The smell is herbal and of pine; like being on the edge of a field with your nose in the forest.  The taste is sensational - one of the most iconic American IPAs available. Completely balanced, drinkable, and hoppy - this has served as a ""gateway beer"" to many of my former non-beer friends.  Long live Stone and this all time great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,damndirtyape,4.45,"On tap at the Renaissance Palm Springs Hotel. Served in a globe pilsner glass.  Appearance: Hazy orange/yellow/copper color, with lots and lots off-white foam and persistent lacing. Persistent head and the lacing came in strands and sheets. Nice looking beer.  Smell: Mostly orange citrus, with a hint of pine thrown in and maybe, just maybe, some grapefruit, but mostly orange citrus hop smell dominating here. A highly pleasant orange smell to boot.  Taste: The perfect blending of orange citrus hops and malt sweetness to balance it out. Hoppy, but just right hop bitterness to come out as refreshing, but not crisp. Very solid malt backbone in here.  Mouthfeel: Just right carbonation, not terribly thick, and not a lot of hop oil sticking to the teeth (to my surprise). Nothing amazing, but certainly good for the style.  Overall / Drinkability: A very good AIPA and quite drinkable. I had two of these in short order with a grilled salmon and crab cake dinner. I could even argue dangerously drinkable as after two I wouldn't mind a third but I know better. A very fine AIPA. I can see why it is rated as high as it is, and I think on tap it's even better than it is in the bottle from when I previously reviewed it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mattbk,3.83,"A- Hmm, golden orange color, very cloudy, presumably from dry hops, although it is so cloudy it must be unfiltered. The color is interesting to me, I'm used to the copper color you get from an IPA. Not much of a head to speak of.  S- Pine and grapefruit, not overpowering, the low carbonation probably leads to the lower amount of aroma. Sweet as well, maybe a bit orangy. T- Definite amount of hop bitterness. The malt sweetness and hop finish balance each other out and leave the beer feeling crisp and clean. A bit grassy at the end. An orange-lemon finish also balances this grassiness, maybe even some faint banana undertones. Refreshing actually.  M- Medium-low mouthfeel, a bit thinner than I'd hoped for. Perky carbonation, prickly on the tongue. Interesting how the carbonation comes through in taste but not in appearance..  O- This is a nice beer, refreshing, tasty, easy to drink for 6.9%. I would have liked a bit more on the aroma and mouthfeel. I should note this is from a bottle from craft beer exchange, possibly this is a bit older than it should be, not bottle dated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jar2574,4.45,"Stone IPA - I've had this a couple times and always loved it. Time to rate it. Easy-to-drink, just the right level of hops and type of hops for me. Flavorful without being too aggressive. Great beer.  Pours a dark yellow color with plenty of carbonation and a very nice white head. Excellent retention and lacing.  Smell is citrus hops, a touch of honey, a touch of bananas.  A well balanced IPA - it is only slightly bitter and there's plenty of malt to balance things out. Taste is orange & banana hops, a touch of grassiness, and some sweetness. I prefer citrusy hops to piney ones, and this beer is more citrusy than piney.  To quibble, the mouthfeel could be a little more dense. But then, I am spoiled because I had Ruination last night and loved the creaminess.  Very, very drinkable.

147,88,Intrinsic,5,"I'd like to start off by saying this is my favourite beer in the world, so if you're looking for an objective opinion, keep looking.  Stone IPA pours a golden straw colour, almost perfectly clear with a healthy head and very respectable lacing. The smell is completely dominated by the hops, but its so much more than that. Citrus and pine tones are mixed with an ever-so-slight maltiness to form the perfect bouquet. The taste is, well, incredible. The most intensely piney hops I've ever tasted in a beer (not including Ruination of course) are somehow balanced up front with the malt they've chosen. The aftertaste is almost just as intense and it's quite dry. Overall, I've already said it.

Smells of hoppy awesomeness but is not overly pungent. Very fruity with aromas of pineapple, slightly earthy and citric with slight notes of orange.  Pineapple and pine/mint, slight orange. Ample bitterness but not palate shredding. Very, very slight cracker/ buiscuit like malt adds a nice subtle taste towards the back with the hop bitterness coming back for the finish.  Feels light/ medium bodied, very crisp and drinkable, slightly refreshing even. Excellent feel.  Overall: A delicious IPA, deliciously hoppy but not to the extreme.

Behind the hops is a hint of alcohol and toasted malt. Very good.  T - Very similar to the nose with a rush of hop presence on the palate. Piney, earthy, herbal tones immediately before expanding to a medium bitterness with herbal and fruity character. Very hop forward but a nice base toasted grain foundation.  M - Very smooth.

The hint of grapefruit and citrus is present however not taking away from the full hop tast that is the dominant taste.  M: It is not a thick feel and a typical light IPA feel. Leaves a good pine hop taste after the beer is finished.  O: It was a great choice and gave me the IPA taste i was looking for.

This beer is deliciously complex. It starts off with a good blast of hops, then mellows into a still hoppy, yet smooth, crisp flavor with an extremely clean finish. It's a little resiny, as some IPAs are, but it's not overwhelming. Overall, a crisp, clean balanced taste.  The mouthfeel is smooth and palatable. Not too heavy.  I'm not a big IPA girl (working on in though), but this one really impressed me. I don't like when the hops overwhelm the flavor and never balance out, but this beer does that.

147,88,MEsoJD,4.22,"[Poured into generic tulip glass]  I: I am no stranger to Stone's ipa, but I give my official review today. I wasn't planning on this review, but I had a taste for it when I went by the store, and saw a six pack(my inner hop head crying out).  B: [6.9%(basically 7) ABV, 12 FL. OZ. Bottled. cant make out the date] As you expect, this has stones classic logo, summary, and ingredients(""Nothing but Barley, Hops, Water & Yeast""). Nice overall, but not as grabbing as their newer iterations.  A: Orange transparent body with a fully/slight scatter head (moderate dissipation), and decent lacing.  S: Typical smell of a standard west coast ipa. Sweet citrus(grapefruit/lemon) malt and spicy hops.  T: Taste like many west coast ipas, but does stand out with slick citrus malt really coats/runs down your lower tongue. Lingering spicy hops complements the malt.  M: Slick/slight dry/crisp finish, medium bodied, medium carbonation(that feels perfect btw), and a decent presence of alcohol.  O: Stones ipa is between a sweet ipa like alesmith and racer five and a more bold like wipe out. I think this is a damn fine beer, with a great malt backbone. With all of that said... Stones ipa doesn't shatter the earth, but that's not the point. It's an ipa and very good one at that.

There are no chocolaty or flowery fruit flavors here, just full uninhibited beer taste with a double dose of biting hops and complimentary malt tones. There are mild hints of crisp apple to me.  A mouthful of this is perfectly balanced and refreshing; it is clean and satisfying with a complimenting aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Every sip is consistently good.  This beer is my everyday beverage. I think it is the perfect brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Citric juice and peels, resin, pine needles, growing clean bitterness. Semi-sweet notes of rye bread and caramel. Medium to full body. The aftertaste got growing notes of grapefruits, lemon and orange peels, passing clean alcohol and rose-flavoured candy.

I found an amazingly fresh 6 pack at Trader Joe's for 9.49; I figured I had to give it a proper review.  Poured into a goblet from a 12 oz bottle dated fresh by 03/25/2012.  A: Pours a golden yellow/orange tone. Great carbonation from the bottom of glass with 2 inch bread off-white head. decent lacing.  S: The hops don't really come out as fresh as on tap. Maybe I have become used to this beers profile, but you get faint citrusy notes.  T: Refreshingly crisp, bitter, and citrusy. Very mellow but flavorful malt backbone that keeps everything nicely balance. Good front end bitterness finishes off with a trace of citrus peel. You can keep drinking this until the glass is empty. A true classic.  M: Light, yet flavorful. This does not weigh down at all.  O: A pioneer and true classic in the West Coast Indian Pale Ale style. It's amazing to think this thing was as bitter as you could get years ago; now it's a very approachable and full flavored staple. A plus.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBrewo,4,"This was served from the bottle at P.F. Chang’s in Stamford, CT into a tall pilsner glass. The beer appeared a hazy gold color, holding a soft two finger head of white bubbles. This showed great retention, leaving thick lacing behind it. No sediment was noted, but a moderate haze permeated the liquid. The aroma was big on grapefruit hops, with a balance of lightly toasted malts. The hops really dominated the show, but were helped along by light black pepper and spice, metallic pale grains, and a brief honey sweetness. As we sipped, the taste opened up with lemon and hoppy cleanliness. These were light and sweet, with an earthy quality towards the back. To make things even lighter there was light strawberry fruitiness. The middle peaked with a renewed fruity sweetness, but this time of cherries, with a hint of fusel ethanol. The finish was strongly of lemon rind and grapefruit hop action, with little else, even from the malt bill. The aftertaste breathed of a balance between clean malts, crisp hops, fresh grass, and slightly more metallics than in the nose. The body was medium and the carbonation was medium. To each sip there was a light and airy feel, with soft slurp and froth. The liquid was more coating than drying, but the mouth was left happy. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how light it was, but also how robust the flavoring was despite this. Throughout there was great hop freshness, with enough room left for the malts. This is a nice standard for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,McStagger,4.58,"Re review of a beloved classic. Being over a year since I've learned to love the IPA, I figured it was time to revisit one of the very first IPA's that gave me a newfound love of the style.  A: Pours a transparent light copper. And I mean transparent. Two fingers of fluffy, ever so slightly off bleach white head. Retention is high, with excellent lacing as well. Carbonation appears subdued, with tiny little bubbles lazily floating to the surface. Lacing is superb, with flecks of head dotting the wall of the glass.  S: Touch of malted caramel, grapefruit, notes of tropical fruit (papaya, mango), whole grain and a bit of straw.  T: Subdued malt sweetness, not quite caramel, but more like a cereal or grain like sweetness. Hops are that of prickly bits of grapefruit, evergreen. Mid palate of tropical fruit. Substantial bitterness and finishes completely dry with herbal and lemon peel notes.  M: Amazingly light bodied and refreshing, especially considering the alcohol by volume of this beer. Finish is extremely dry, akin to a quality pilsner, but with more of a citric undertone.  O: Probably the best California IPA in the broad market. No other beer so dynamically combines explosive flavor with smooth refreshment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,HopNelius,4.2,"Served out of the bottle into a traditional pint glass. Appearance-golden small amount of carbonation with a 1/2 inch head, head is sticking to glass. Smell-citrus and pine hops, not smelling any malt or alcohol. Taste-notes of pine and grapefruit. I can also taste malt with a little alcohol on the finish. Very smooth overall though. Mouthfeel-nice, crisp, very drinkable. Overall-Solid IPA. Some IPA's really bite and sometimes I like that, this is an IPA however that you could drink several of very easily if you chose to do so. It is satisifies the hopheads but is also very well balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rangerred,4.62,12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a slightly hazy orange with a thick white head. Awesome lacing.  The aroma smacks you in the face with piney citrusy hops. There is also some earthiness along with caramel.  The flavor is pine and grapefruit but giving way to some caramel. There is a certain earthy flavor present as well. Strong bitterness throughout leading to a drying finish. Mouthfeel is good for the style.  Overall this is one of my favorite IPA's. It is extremely smooth and each sip leaves you wanting more. It would be easy to down several of these in a sitting.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ptykozoon,3.88,"Pours light honey with a nice half inch sticky head. Bubbles and good lacing make this look very ALIVE.  Grapefruit, pine, honey, bits of orange.  Taste follows the scents, dry pine mixed with sweet grapefruit and a dash of pineapple and orange.  Sticky sweet mouthfeel, 6.9 abv is perfect right? Sounds good to me. Sessionable yet a very distinct and lively beer that holds its own.  Picked this up at Costco, glad they are at least dipping their hands in something other than Bud. Lovely beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T- Nice citrus here, grapefruit, lemon and a lot of zest. Warm hops along back with warm grass and even some grain. So drinkable but nice and hoppy. Not too malt forward.  M- Crisp, nice tongue burn.

147,88,chinchill,4.27,"A pint on tap. Arrived with a billowing head that was exceptionally thick and creamy. It left loads of sticky lacing.  Citrus hops with traces of alcohol and malts in the nose.  The beer also has a strong citrus component on reaching the tongue, but this becomes more piney mid-taste. Sweet when it hits the tongue, with no immediate hop hit following ... this does appear in the surprisingly hoppy finish. Thus, this IPA creates a striking and unusual (well, exaggerated) flavor dynamic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Grapefruit and citrus hops, a touch of pine, and a decent malt backbone round out the aroma. Maybe even a bit astringent.  T - The bitter hop flavors more or less follow the nose, but the malt backbone comes on stronger in the flavor. Finishes with a blast of piney hops.  M - Medium bodied, smooth and a bit sudsy feeling. The carbonation level is perfect.  O - Overall, a fantastic beer - I actually enjoyed it much more than the Ruination IPA.

147,88,hopsolutely,4.3,"Brilliant example of an American IPA.  Hazy orange amber with a decent head and pleasantly oily mouthfeel. Aroma of caramelized malts and citrus.

147,88,aficionado,4.26,"12/2 Bottle date ~ Consumed 12/24  Frothy white, pillowy foam atop a clear yellowish gold body. The lacing is ridiculously high.  Freshly picked pine cones, bitter pine sap, concentrated orange zest, puckering white grapefruit drizzled with caramel, and a subtle sweetness from bready malts. Very West Coast indeed.  Quite balanced for an IPA, yet still inherently bitter. Crisp, refreshing, easy drinking. Aromas and flavors match, but the flavor is slightly better.  Like PtE, when Stone IPA and Ruination are older than 3-4 weeks after bottling, the quality goes significantly downhill. After 4 weeks, Stone IPA still enjoyable and drinkable, but not as stellar as it once was. You don't get that blast of pine; instead, you get more malty fruity citrus notes.  The price is way too high for a sixer ($12), but this would certainly be a go-to IPA if I could always find it fresh for around $8.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Finally finishes with a fairly sweet malty flavor while still remaining bitter from hops  M- caronaton is not too much or too little, takes mouth for a ride, hoppy, sweet malts, and finishes bitter from hops.

147,88,magictacosinus,4.35,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a hazy, straw-tinged amber color that literally screams ""West Coast IPA."" Contains a 2-finger head that slowly dissipates. Contains loads of carbonation.  Strong citrus notes (especially of lemon), grapefruit, desert flowers, but surprisingly, a very malty aroma accompanied alongside the hoppiness. Yeasty smelling as well, often reminiscing fresh, spicy bread.  Taste is immediately flowery and fruity, with tons and tons of citrus flavors! There's a soapy flavor at the back, in spite of all of the strong, astringent bitterness. Due to the carbonation, this beer is quite creamy, which makes it very easy to drink (if you're into hoppy beers). Barely watery, and manages to hold a taste as yeasty as it smells.  This is an awesome IPA! One of the top quality ones, and a true inspiration for those attempting to brew premium IPAs. It, just like all of Stone's beers, is an acquired taste, but it's a classic hop recipe by the brewery. Simply excellent!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very pungent happy smell, its very nice  Big upfront spices hop taste with a fruity tart like sweetness on the lips. Pungent dry hop finish on the back of the tongue. Malt body lingers as well as the hops but not in a bad way. Flavors are layered well rather than blended. Body is a bit thin on the finish.  Very very spicy herbal ipa. I thought the bitterness would be abut more brutal but its not (not that its not rough). Some fruit flavors and a very very subtle malt body which probably lends to the slightly thin finish. Better than expected though.  Hop bitterness builds slightly but its not intolerable like some other beers that probably use the same type of hops.  The beer is definitely different for an ipa. It actually showcases the huge flavors one would normally find in a double ipa which is impressive but not exactly what im looking for when I want an ipa. Not bad though at all",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- Pungent mix of American hops right off the top. Piney with lots of citrus aroma. Perhaps a little grassiness. Smells like an American IPA should.  T/M- Just as expected from the aroma. Aggressive hops up front. I get more resinous pine in the flavor, although some sour citrus creeps in as well. Grapefruit. A lot of traditional hop bitterness behind the upfront flavor. Very little maltiness to back these hops up, although as it warms up there is a very slight grainy note. Not what would be considered balanced, but for my taste, that's alright on this one. Extremely dry finish, which I find pretty refreshing. Doesn't linger, the drying almost leaves you wanting more.    O- One of my favorites.

I poured the 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass and took note of the nice foamy head -- about an inch in all. The beer is amber-colored.  As others have written, it is a very well-hopped IPA with a nice citrus aroma and taste. I actually did not find it all that bitter, but my taste buds are used to drinking beers in this genre. In any case, I found the hops to be sufficiently balanced to take the most bitter edge off of the hops. It still tilts generously towards the hops, but it has a very pleasing taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brewsclues,4.42,"A - Golden brown color, and very hazy. Great head retention and frothy lacing that sticks to the glass nicely.  S - Tons of resiny, piney hops, and strong citrus overtones. Reminds me of DFH 60M Minute with lots of grapefruit. I also smell some fresh bread, too. Really digging this. Smells like it's true to it's name: how hoppy can we brew a beer?  T - Really refreshing IPA with an outstanding hoppy bite. Tons of bitter citruses (lemon), as well as a cranberry aftertaste (really subtle). This is a huge flavored IPA.  M - Nice balance of carbonation and malt-smoothness. A resin aftertaste gives a big, sticky mouthfeel, which may turn off some - but, we're drinking a big IPA here, what did you expect?  O - This is a great effort from Stone. This is right up there with DFH in terms of my favorite IPAs - big hoppy flavors, tons of citrus, and a nice refreshing malt-y finish with a good carbonation balance.

147,88,fox227,4.24,"A: A medium-aggressive pour resulted in a nice two fingered head, but it quickly falls to one, but retention is good. The lacing sticks to the glass all over. The liquid is a dim gold.  S: I love the smell of this beer: very perfume-y aroma of flowers, citrus, and perhaps some stone-fruit or dried strawberries.  T: The taste isn't as amazing as the smell, but it's still very good. The citrus, floral flavor carry over from the smell, and there's also a slightly caramel, but more biscuit-like flavor in the malt. Hops are fairly well balanced with the malt, but it's certainly IPA-hoppy, so no worries there.  M: Medium carbonation, slight palate numbing from the hops, and finishes a bit dry.  O: This is a very solid standard IPA. I tend to not prefer pale ales and IPAs that have that biscuit like flavor going on, but the rest of the profile is excellent - as usual for Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,troysoy2,4.43,"Ah, Stone IPA. We meet for the first time.  It's pretty. I have to admit that. No flaws here. It has the color of the ""ideal"" IPA. Bubbles rising to the top to form a beautiful head that refuses to die below the point of covering the surface.  The smell is... well, let's just put it this way: it's hoppy. And that's all it smells like. Simple, strong, and unashamed.  The front of the taste is almost indescribable. Just the essence of bitter. Towards the middle of the taste, actual 'flavors' start to come into play. Still, it takes until you swallow for there to be anything to say about this beer other than ""HOPS"". And even then... what can I say? Pine? Awesome?  The mouthfeel is what I've been looking for in an IPA. The right balance between frothy carbonation and sticky resiny goodness.  The only negative thing I'll say about this beer is how single minded it is. ""Let's see how hoppy we can make an IPA"". Not sure if this is exactly what the people at Stone Brewery had in mind, but I have a feeling they wouldn't mind me saying that. Thank you Stone, for brewing interesting beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,StarshipPoopers,4.2,"A - Amber and pretty transparent, has a nice glow to it. Sticky white lacing with some fizzy carbonation in the pour.  S - Fresh grapefruit that gives off more of a bitterness than the typical sweetness, which is balanced out by citrus. A touch of the malt comes through as well, gives a base to the hops. Nothing complicated going on in the aroma, just a nice, inviting hop character.  T - Fair amount of bitterness. Up front there is a combination of pine resin and grapefruit. Lots of citrus comes through in the finish, grapefruit being predominant along with hints of peppery spices. The finish leaves a distinct pine resin that sticks to your throat.  M/D - I quite like the feel of it. The body is medium with a little bit of carbonation that lasts throughout.  O - I thought I had reviewed this by now, surprised that I haven't. I usually pick up a 6 pack whenever I'm in the US and see some that is only a few weeks old. It's nice that a solid IPA like this is affordable and usually fresh in stock in Michigan.

T/M: Big bitterness up front, followed by some pronounced floral/citrus rind hop notes, light body but smooth. The finish is lingering bitterness, more citrus, pine resin hops, and a subtle candy malt flavor on the bone dry finish.  Overall: Great beer, and so damn easy to get.

Bitter, but not as bitter as I would have thought, especially coming from Stone.  M: Medium, carbonation is surprisingly soft and unintrusive.  This was nice and balanced (for a hop lover) IPA.

M- Slight textured feel, goes down smooth. Leaves your mouth with a hoppy and bitter taste which basically means to me that this IPA did its job. Medium carbonation keeps the taste alive.

147,88,ghwolf,4.5,"Stone Brewery in Southern California has been producing excellent beers for more than a decade and have a wide array of offerings. This IPA, though not their best IPA (in my opinion), is one with fine character. The golden color of the beer is contrasted with a off white head which laces the beer glass while drinking. The aroma, though not as pronounced as other IPAs (thinks Avery's) is nonetheless hearty with agreeable hop notes. It has a hops, earthy, and some light citrus flavor which remains on the palette even after drinking. Sure, there are many IPAs on the market, but this one is well above average, very drinkable, and remarkably consistent every time I have had it. And another benefit is that one can find the beer all over the US owing to the size of Stone Brewery (among the top 25 largest breweries in the US).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

All the typical IPA elements are there that follow the aroma. Slight bready notes and a sweet start procede into a strong hop character with a powerful citrus punch.  M - Good carbonation. Medium body. Nice bitterness.  O/D - Incredibly drinkable. Very solid and nice. A well constructed IPA that puts so many weaker ones to shame.

Forgot to snap a pic, so I am borrowing the one from the Stone website.  Appearance: Hazy golden-orange color. Pretty translucent. Pours one and a half fingers of foam that sticks around a while with some lacing on the side of the glass as well. 4/5  Smell: Very herbal, tart-citrus aroma. Lemony fresh with nondescript spices. 4.5/5  Taste: Very hoppy and citrusy. The carbonation makes the lemon/fruit-citrus bitterness quite zesty. Quite piney too. Lasting hop finish. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium carbonation. 3.5/5  Overall: The golden standard of year-round single IPAs.  Recommendation: An absolute must try single IPA. If you have not yet had the pleasure, you must. Even casual beer drinkers should be able to appreciate the quality of this brew, though hop haters might need to avoid this one.  Pairings: Hamburgers.  Cost: $4.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle or $10.99 for a six pack.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BilbosNuts,4.09,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a hazy orange/dark golden color. It appears to have a minimal amount of carbonation, with only a few scattered bubbles rising occasionally. Its small, white head fades quickly to a small ring over the top.  S: Basically what you'd expect from a good IPA. There is a nice hop profile, it has orange and lemon citrus aromas accompanied by some other fruity esters. Herbal and floral notes also make an appearance.  T: There is a bold dominance of hops that contribute to the tastes present. These include a citrus and fruitiness, herbal and floral flavors, and a nice lingering bitter finish.  M: This is a medium bodied IPA with just the right amount of carbonation to disperse the bold hop flavors. It has a sort of dry finish and a crispness that allows the flavors to linger on the palate.  O: This is a fine IPA. Stone's regulars are all pretty solid and this one is no exception. This is a readily available, well above average IPA. Very much recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very inviting hoppy smell of lemon, pine and spice and everything nice! Very fresh and inviting!  A lovely assault on the tongue, very upfront with a nice easy washover that keeps me wanting more.  Sits very well in the mouth, a great lingering bitterness very close if not better than my other 2 favs. Two Hearted from Bells and Furious from Surly, Hops RULE!!!!

147,88,fmccormi,4.16,"Straight pour from a 22oz pry-off bottle to my DFH IPA glass; freshness date of July 28, 2013 printed in yellow ink on the shoulder of the bottle (“ENJOY BY 07/28/13”). Given Stone’s standard 90-day freshness window, that would mean this beer was bottled on April 29 or thereabouts, just under three weeks ago. Easily the freshest Stone IPA I’ve seen in this area.  Appearance (4.5): This pours with a full, voluminous head (easily three fingers) the color of custard, which seems as if it won’t die down. It dissipates slowly, looking like the texture of meringue, leaving some lacing on the sides. The body is a crystal-clear, 24ct gold. As the beer goes down, it leaves wide, thick patches of lacing and wide collars which cover nearly half of the far side of the glass—very nice.  Smell (4.0): Very nice, fragrant aromas of pineapple juice, pine sap, some dank resin, and some of that weird, earthy spiciness you can get from Simcoe. It all floats above some fresh white bread, sugar cookies, and light simple syrup.  Taste (4.25): Starts off with a strong bitterness that tastes like chewing on grapefruit rind, and that bitterness sticks around through to the dry finish. The malt body follows the character shown in the nose, mostly with a sugar cookie sweetness which ties into some of that pineapple juice hop character. Key lime pie, mint leaves, and more pine sap mingle. It stays light enough to stay out of the way and still finish nicely dry, especially with that undercurrent of pine resin. Straightforward, but well done: solidly bitter from start to finish, with a present-enough malt body and a dry, bitter finish.  Mouthfeel (4.25): Carbonation is moderate with a soft feel, foaming easily with a subtle tingle before finishing, pairing with a slightly less-than-medium weight body that finishes well dry but not parching. Overall, it makes for a very satisfying feel.  Overall (4.0): This is a very solid, very classic American IPA. What I like about it is how straightforward and clear the bitterness is, showing more bite than a lot of the new, all-chewy-juicy-hops (D)IPAs—this kind of beer defines the American IPA, in a lot of ways, and it’s very good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,rickyleepotts,4,"I LOVE Stone. Nearly every beer they make is amazing. I am not sure I have ever had a beer they made that wasn’t just incredible. I have had this beer before, and being that I LOVE a good IPA, I have managed to find and order this time and time again. I prefer it on draft, but the point of this blog is not beers on tap, rather in the bottle. Anyway, let’s make our way through this tasty brew,  In the Glass: It looks like an IPA. Most of their beers appear more heavy in the glass and have a certain home brew look to them. Anyone that makes their own beer knows what I am talking about it. Regardless, it’s a good looking beer in the glass. There is little to no head, which is fine by me. Think barleywine.  Nose: It smells like an IPA! Actually, it smells like an IPA with a hint of orange. Not sure where that orange scent is coming from, but it gives it a certain “wetness” to the nose. We are drinking this beer cold, too, which is not how I would typically prefer an IPA. I like them halfway from fridge to room temperature for the true flavors. Speaking of flavor…  Flavor: Whoa! As I said, I have had this beer before. But here, drinking with purpose, I am able to enjoy it and take a little more out of it. The bitterness that you demand from a good IPA is immediately noticed when you take a sip of this beer. The way it dances across your tongue on the way down just begs me to take another sip. You swallow, and while the aftertaste (we’ll get to that) isn’t what you desire, it still tastes amazing.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is quick, wet, and cold. Of course, that’s because I am drinking the beer cold… but you get the idea. It has a hint of carbonation to it, but not too much to make you put the glass down. The best part of the mouthfeel is the end, when the beer is gone yet the flavors are still all over the palate. That is when you know you have a good brew.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is not what you expect from a beer with this much flavor. It’s there, and it lasts for a while but it’s nothing to write home about. It’s clean, crisp, and the subtle bitterness toward the end lingers for a while. It’s not one of those aftertastes that makes me want to stop and smell the roses, if you know what I mean. Regardless, this is a great beer, one that is easy to find, and is not very expensive. I will order this time and time again. Bottoms up people!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheMultiYeast,4.44,"This IPA pours hazy, golden yellow with some white head and impressive lacing.  Smell is full of juicy hop aroma. Moist. Dank, pine and citrus notes complemented by some sweet grain. Grassy frutiness, pineapple, starfruit.  Big citrus notes in taste. Grapefruit, some earthier pine notes. Well balanced with a hint of sweetness, then big dry bitterness.  Medium bodied. Definitely session-worthy.  Classic West Coast IPA and a must-try beer for any hophead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hmf05,4.45,"Just reviewed this one on tap, but I figured I'd review a fresh bottle. Pours a clear gold with a two finger head that sticks around. It is a little darker than a standard macro. Smells is wonderful. I get pineapple, grapefruit, and papaya. Smells juicy. Taste is a hop onslaught. Mostly citrus coming through with noticeable pine. Overall, I think I might actually prefer this bottled. Perfect representation of a west coast IPA. The only thing keeping this from being an A+ is the lack of any noticeable malt flavor. I know west coast IPAs tend to be all hops, but I prefer a little sweetness in my IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DaftCaskBC,4.7,"A: 3/4"" off-white head that left a nice lacing over cloudy amber liquid.  S: Pine and citrus hops as well as honey malt.  T: The bitterness is aggressive up front but this quickly gives way to citrus hops in the middle and a finish with some pine and semi-sweet honey and nutty malt. Very interesting, and it keeps you coming back to re-experience the unique flavour profile. At 6.9% ABV, this beer hides the alcohol very well.  M: Medium viscosity and medium level of carbonation.  O: Very impressive IPA. More like an Imperial IPA meal in a glass, but who am I to complain.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,y2jrock60,4.33,"A- Cloudy light orange with a creamy white head that laces nicely.  S- Earthy and sweet piney hops aroma.  T- Sweet upfront with piney hop kick that's present in the middle of the sip and slowly lingers away. The finish is nice, it's not too dry and isn't overpowering.  M- Medium body with light carbonation.  D- Pretty drinkable for an IPA. The bitterness is perfect, it doesn't hit upfront and fades nicely at the end of the sip.  Definitely one of the better IPAs. It is nicely balanced and is unfiltered.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gregb13,4,"Had this tonight over an awesome burger at Red Robin. Pours a beatifully inviting, frothy glassful of welcome. Nose is dominated by bitter citrus flesh, red grapefruit rind, citrusy hops. Taste follows the nose perfectly. Perfect carbonation. Goes down way too easy. Could drink all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rudolphjacksonm,4.33,"A - Gorgeous amber with a white one and a half finger head that slowly dissolved. Heavy lacing on the glass. 4.5  S - Fruity, hoppy aroma with a hint of banana, and pine resin. Very pleasant. 4.0  T - Extremely well-balanced. Strong citrus and resin flavors that are slightly sweet and hoppy supported by a malty aftertaste. The bitterness one would expect from an IPA is just the right amount for me. 4.5  M - Smooth and medium-bodied. Not too carbonated and not too thick. 4.0  O - I like Stone's IPA for its hoppy, pine character. It's much more true to my vision of an IPA than others I have tried. That being said though, I think I still prefer Bell's Two Hearted Ale to the Stone IPA in terms of flavor. Nevertheless, this is an excellent IPA that people should definitely give a chance. 4.5",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheQuietMan22,4,"Appearance: Straight pour into a pint glass. The color is hazy light bronze with small particulates of yeast (?) hovering in the liquid; it is no doubt from the sedimentation that developed at the bottom of the bottle, which I thought was a little weird. Two fingers of eggshell-colored head dissipated to leave trails along the glass, a spotted lacing, and a thick ring of foam around the edge.  Smell: Dominant grapefruit and metallic hoppiness, a little bit of sweet malts, and lemon zest.  Taste: Much like the smell, it offers a nice, dominant, metallic and grapefruit hop bite, which really tickles the tonsils. It is loaded with hops, and it is beyond evident to me that I have not had anything this hoppy in a long time; each sip provides a massive dose of bitterness. Lemon zest and a little orange is also noticeable, but it obviously gets overshadowed by the massive hop characteristics. Toward the end, my taste buds finally adjusted and I was able enjoy it without the intense bitterness getting in the way.  Drinkability: It lacks complexity, but it packs a hoppy punch and offers major grapefruit flavor. It is now the definitive IPA in my book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jvillefan,4.45,"A: Golden yellow with a three finger pearl white head that hangs around for the duration of the beer.  S: Awesome. There is the bitter hoppiness that IPAs are suppose to have. In the background of the smell is citrus and a little pine.  T: There is obviously the intense taste of hops. The more subtle flavors are citurs, pine, and a little sweetness created by caramel.  M: The carbonation is heavy yet perfect. The beer could be a little smoother but a good texture.  O: Very good IPA. Among the best IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,drpimento,4.88,"The quintessential American IPA. Poured with a nice, large, off white, foamy, frothy, head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is hop, malt, citrus, pine, fresh baked bread, grass. Flavor is huge hop/malt bittersweet thing with perfect carbonic tang. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish has just the right length and is like flavor. This is beer baby.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Luigi,4.6,"Pours out a frothy three finger head with excellent head retention. Great thick lacing sticking all around the glass from start to finish. Hazy light orange color with yeast partials floating around the glass.  The aroma is sharp with citrus and pine hops. Biscuit malt, and even a hint of sweet malt.  The first flavors to hit the palate are sharp bitter hops. Hints of grapefruit, orange, pine, and hemp. Biscuit malts pulls through the hop. A touch of yeast with malt sweetness. This is a hop head's IPA but there is a balance.  Medium bodied easy to drink. Finished dry with bitter with hop lingering.  This America IPA is hop head's dream! Classic west coast IPA not for the faint of heart. In your face hops and easy to drink!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CyclingLush666,3.88,"The appearance of this beer is very nice, a dark amber orange color that lets you know right of the bat it is a genuine IPA. I really like the darkness because I enjoy a darker beer. And one of Stone's motto's is ""Yellow fizzy beer is for wussies"".  A very strong smell of hops and barley. I can't really smell anything else, and I don't think they want you to smell anything else.  The taste is great, and much more mellow than some of their other beers. The Arrogant Bastard and some of their other beers are almost too bitter, while this is very smooth for a Stone. I like their IPA a lot and could drink it all night.  The mouthfeel is nice as well, nice and smooth nothing that bites too much. But still this IPA has some balls, and may grab your taste buds if you do not normally indulge this kind of beer.  Go out and grab one of these. Their around 6 bucks, and a 22 oz with 6.9% alcohol by volume will take the edge off your day for sure. And if you don't like IPA I don't know why you are even reading this review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,claspada,3.53,"Pours a hazy golden orange; clearly unfiltered, or is that haze from the dry hopping?  Aromas begin with typical C-hops, citrus, pine and grapefruit. Definitely floral and juicy as well. None more dominant than the other. Light pale malt sweetness in the background.  The tastes begin with abundant amounts of spicy, juicy hops. A full body supports this heavy load of hops with some bready malt flavors present to give this brew some balance.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Big and full and the finish is as smooth as silk. No alcohol, mild carbonation and a hop bite come together to form a deceptively smooth and refreshing finish.  Overall this is a good IPA but not my favorite. A bit too much on the bitter side with a lacking hop flavor. Kind of forgettable and a bit of a palate wrecker because of the lack of a malt presence to balance the abundant West Coast C-hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,donovanneb,4.8,"This is the standard for an everyday drinking IPA. The flavors are pouring out as soon as you dispense it into your favorite glass. The taste is an excellent hoppy, fruity, flavor that lingers in your mouth. Clean, incredibly well made, it’s a beer that I drink weekly and will continue to buy until they retire it, which I doubt will ever happen.  People need to understand that you don't need an overly hopped out beer in order to make it a good IPA. Reminds me of the wine industry and highly alcoholic wine with pruny, raisin flavors that so called wine drinkers started flocking to in the late 2000’s. This is an excellent IPA, well structure and just as advertised. Those looking for something overly hopped out in order to “get” this beer don’t understand the elegance that goes into beer making and IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Murrhey,3.54,"From notes taken several days ago. Served in a Schooner at The Iron Mule in Lake Forest. Disclaimer: not a fan of IPAs.  A: My glass had minimal head, and poor lacing but a nice light orange color. I might attribute the head to the bartender.  S: Hoppy, crisp.  T: Hops present, obviously. Not as strongly and bitter as I usually get from IPAs. I enjoyed it.  M: Great consistency, great feel.  O: New go-to IPA. Nice job Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jmerloni,3.21,"A - Orange/amber with nice sticky white head.  S - Hops, citrus, and more hops.  T - Surprisingly not much flavor. Citrus, hops, and a light brown sugar malt. There's some citrus rind in here as well.  M - Light to medium-boided. Almost watery, but swallows nice and even.  D - I don't really understand this beer. There's not much here. It's watery and there's hardly any mouthfeel at all. Don't think I'd get this again. Not impressed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hophead717,3.13,"Overall, I'm very unimpressed by this beer. Definitely disappointed.  A: The beer pours a very nice golden brown from a 12 oz bottle with a 1.5-2 finger head after a slightly vigorous pour. The head disappates fairly quickly, but leaves some lacing along the side of the glass.  S: The first smell you get is citrus, specifically grapefruit. A light grassy/piney smell follows and you can pick out some bitter hops.  T: Similar to the nose, only with a very bitter hop flavor coming across. Grapefruit and citrus notes pair with grassy hops before the taste is overwhelmed by bitter notes. If you like your IPAs bitter, you may enjoy this. There's a little malt underlying the beer, but you have to look to find it. Overall, the flavor is fairly weak, though a touch of bitterness sticks with you through the finish.  M: Very carbonated and light.  O: Meh. If you enjoy really bitter IPAs, you'll be a fan. I enjoy bitter hop tastes, but the thinness of the beer and overall light flavor is disappointed. I wanted a lot more from Stone and the beer did not deliver.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Keithstone44,4.55,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. The beer is hazy-golden in color, with a slim 1-finger head. This is a very aromatic beer with lots of floral and citrus notes; I also detect a little honey at the tail end. At first taste, the grapefruit and citrus flavors are very evident, as well as a noticeable hop-bitterness that is strong but not overpowering. The body of this beer is exceptional, for it accomplishes being creamy yet highly-drinkable. The carbonation is a little much, but the taste outweighs this minute flaw. In comparison to other trademark IPA's. this brew holds its own with ease.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Overall I really liked this beer, great combination of flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scootny,4.3,A very large head and a copious amount of lace. Opaque golden amber color. Smell is bright and citrusy with lots of caramel sweetness and tropical fruits. A touch of pine and yeasty doughy sweet rolls. Taste super. Sizable malt front is quickly enveloped by lots of grapefruit. A nice amount of caramel and multigrain dinner rolls for a backbone. Hops are full of oily citrus notes. A bit of mint as well. Finish is very dry and long with hop oil dripping from every part of my mouth. Feel is crisp and mildly effervescent with a medium light weight. A top flight beer that just does it better than most. Wow.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BucannonXC5,3.77,"Poured from a draft into a pint glass at Playa Grill & Margarita Bar in San Diego, Calif. Color was orange blossom honey, kind of clear. Not much head when I got it, but probably originally an inch. Bubbly white lacing on the top. The film was scattered throughout.  Smelled of citrus hops with light lemon leading the way. Some bitterness at the end.  Quick citrus up front, giving way to a sharp and strong alcohol bite. Crisp, clean and some bitterness at the end.  Medium body. Lively carbonation. Clean and refreshing.  A pretty good beer overall. I’d definitely give it another go.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Philousa,4.85,"Sits an opaque gold in the glass with a good amount of head. Lacing is great, leaving a trail of your Stone experience like rings in a tree trunk. A complex hop profile greets the nose. It's earthy, citrusy, floral, and light with some bitterness. Pale malt meets the tongue first, tasting fruity with higher temperatures. This fades to bitter with hints of earthiness. The bitterness is a kick, but not overwhelming. There are some yeast flavors in the brew if you're looking for it, which speaks to the delicateness of this beer. The mouthfeel is balanced. Lots of carbonation, but it isn't harsh on the tongue or throat. Stone sure picked their yeast carefully. It feels a bit too malty at first, but it lightens up due to the carbonation.  This is a model IPA that should be followed, if not replicated, by other breweries. Many say that Stone is too bitter or hop crazy, but when you compare this IPA to others (such as Lagunitas or DFH), you notice this is much more delicate than its competitors. There are floral and fruity undertones to this beer that you just don't get with others. Now it must be admitted that I'm a bit partial, since Stone introduced me to the wonderfulness known as hops, but I think there is a reason I listened when they spoke. Stone knows what they're doing here, and anyone with taste buds will sit a little straighter and take note. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,falloutsnow,4.18,"Bottle purchased from Piccadilly in Champaign, IL. No best by date. Poured into a standard US pint glass.  Pours a large, 2cm-plus, off-white head of fairly large bubbles, which makes it look a bit cumbersome and strange. Deflates slowly, leaving significant lacing in small streaks. Body is a deep and cloudy orange-yellow color, very intriguing and enticing. Carbonation and sediment visible. Good overall.  Aroma of pine and citrus with a bit of faint malt in the background for balance. I like this, but think it could actually be a notch stronger and stand out all the more while still being balanced.  Strong malt backbone with plentiful citrus and pine hop flavors swirling around this central pillar. Intermediate flavors of hop bitterness and mild malt sweetness. Definitely a hop-forward brew. Aftertaste is crisp, biscuity, and bitter with hints of grapefruit rind.  Strictly medium-bodied with noticeable carbonation, but nothing excessive or uninviting. Good for the body's heft and style. Finish is dry and slightly sticky either from resins or sugars.  This is an excellent AIPA, as most seem to agree upon. I would appreciate a deeper aroma, but the core of this beer is entirely strong; I wouldn't change a thing if it meant altering some other aspect of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,les1721,4.94,"Serving type; 22 oz. bottle with awesome artwork. Got to love the Gargoyle.  Appearance; A rich golden, orange hued beer with a nice thick head that's lacy and sticks around.  Smell; Very piney, citric and fruity. Very aromatic and pungent and a little earthy and herbal. Its smell is awesome, they should make cologne that smells like this.  Taste; The taste is divine. Hops are the first thing you taste. Very piney, a little citric, herbal and intense. The hop profile is profound and the bitterness intense but not overwhelming. Very grapefruity. A nice subtle malt profile balances it out and the finish is very clean yet lingers. Sweet but crisp. Almost contradicting, this beer has it all.  Mouthfeel; Medium mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation.  Overall; This is a perfect beer for me. Strong and hoppy, but balanced and not overwhelming. Complex but crisp.

147,88,WoodBrew,4.42,"Tasting the Stone IPA as my first beer on this glorious Saturday evening. The beer is quite good. The color is a hazy orangish with white foamy head that is lacing. The smell includes fresh pine and bitter citrus fruit. The taste is quite good. It starts with a nice citrus and pine push then a malt takes over then a bitterness, then the pallat clears with more malt. It is quite an interesting beer. The mouthfeel is very good and I probably could have a couple before running out of steam; higher ABV makes it tough. Overall a very good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Humulus85,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Rogue pint glass. It produced a super dense, white, two-finger head. Damn good retention and a bit of lacing. A clear, honey gold color; this is a good looking brew.  Smell is top-notch. Hop forward as expected, but nice complexity. There's some citrus, some pine, a bit of spice, and a touch of sweet malt.  Dry, spicy hops upfront, mellowed out by some lemon. Malt comes more as it warms, but this brew remains dry and moderately bitter throughout. This is a well balanced IPA  Medium bodied and nice carbonation. The sign of a good IPA is its drinkability, and this is very drinkable.  Overall this is a really solid representation of an AIPA and an overall tasty beer. Recommended for any fan of IPAs, plus it is widely available.

147,88,jtingue,4.4,"On cask at Ashleys in Ann Arbor.  Appearance. Very cloudy with visible chucks of yeast floating around. Nice 2 fingers of off white head that retains extremely well.  Smell. Surprising presence of yeast. Dominated, though, by a nice floral hop aroma.  Taste. Starts with a nice sweetness and a slowly building hop bitterness, which takes over for a while. A candy like sweetness returns with some yeasty esters. This is accompanied by medicinal and herbal hops with a slight citrus as well. This lingers to the finish.  Mouthfeel. Simply amazing. Creamy body with a tight carbonation.  This is a completely different, and frankly better, beer on cask.

147,88,BeerNoobNC,3.97,"In my opinion, this beer is not as good as it's stronger counterpart double IPA (Stone Ruination) which is definitely one of the best in its category.  With that said, this IPA is still a great beer that is worth a try. It still has a great hoppy taste and is not too bitter. I have definitely had better IPA's, but that does not mean this is not a good one.  However, if you are a ""hop-head"" and really want to see what Stone is about, I would recommend the Ruination IPA. Otherwise, this is one of many good IPA's available in this country, and though it is well-brewed, it is not special to set it apart from any of the other good ones.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brian44556,4.33,"Picked up a growler of this at LB in Springhurst. Poured into a Southern Tier 2xIPA glass.  Pours a honey color with a thick, white head that turns into a great lacing that coats the sides of the glass. Carbonation bubbles race from the bottom of the glass to the top keeping the head afloat. Smells of grass, citrus, and sweet malts. Taste is well balanced between the bitterness from the hops and heavy malt profile. Taste strong bitterness from the hops, sweet malts, and a citrus tropical profile. Easy drinker and crisp finish. This growler will be easy to finish before evening hits (2pm as I review). Great IPA from Stone. Makes it even better this is readily available. This is a staple beer that will always be in the fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,coldriver,4.38,"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a deep amber with nice fluffy head. Lacing is great. Nice citrus pine hop aroma but fairly subtle. West Coast in your face hop blend is what I live for, but properly balanced (or properly imbalanced for the style) with necessary malty backbone. Nice thick resinous mouthfeel coats the tongue with spicy bitterness cutting straight through to the most hop receptive taste buds.  Overall I'm a big fan of this West Coast style IPA.

147,88,setexascustoms,4.59,"Bottle into a pint glass.  A- A lovely bright golden amber. A moderately aggressive pour yielded just over one finger of head, nice and rocky, off white. Retention was fair and the lacing had a lot of stick.  S- Very aromatic hops; with citric, floral and piney notes. The kind of smell that implores you to drink this beer, with a slight bready malt presence as well.  T- Hops up front with a lot of citrus zest, and a little rind. Bready malts come in to help balance it out into the lingering bitter finish.  M- Full bodied and slick, which is a staple to me in good IPAs. Slightly dry in the finish.  O- It may be a little on the bitter side of balanced, and I could see how it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But that's OK, I love it. One of my favorite IPAs.

147,88,uawildcat,3.6,"(Hop)ing to get in a few IPAs as the hot weather remains in AZ. Poured this beer into an English pub glass. The first thing I noticed was the smell. Man, does this thing have zesty citrusy hop smell coming from it. A creamy two finger head formed with a hazy yellow color in the beer itself.  Once I got my nose in the glass I noticed that the citrusy hops had a piney smell behind them too. There is so much hop aroma that it is impossible to smell the malt. Dry hopping must have been done. This is how an IPA should smell.  The taste of this beer however is subpar. Maybe I am not as much of a hop head as most beer advocates. I love hoppy flavor, but this one is over the top. The bitterness is like chewing on an orange peel with no sweetness to balance it out. It is nice and creamy going down. But once the drink is down the palate gets dry from the 6.9% abv.  This beer would be good when I desire something extremely bitter, with a lovely hop aroma. However, this beer isn't something that I would go out and get a 6 pack of.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tdm168,4,"Pours a dark, hazy yellow with 1/4"" of dense, foamy head. Good retention. The smell has barley malt notes, yeast, and faint citrusy hop aromas. The taste is bready malt followed by some pineapple and grapefruit with just a slight earthiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and refreshing.  Not overly bitter so it's drinkable and refreshing. The alcohol content is moderate but warms the palate. Overall balanced and solid.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,TheAlamoWrocker,4.41,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, best consumed by October 4 of 2011, into a Blue Star Brewery Pint Glass.  Appearance  The color is roughly a mix between a shade of Fulvous and also a shade of Goldenrod. The color is kinda remarkable on how beautiful it is. It poured a one fingered head and most of it left quite quickly. The carbonation is mild and rises to the head and it creates almost a swirl like head.  Smell  The smell is pretty mild. It has a slight malt with mostly a nice hoppy floral smell to it.  Taste  The taste is strong floral citrus taste. The taste is just almost too much. The taste just punched me in the face and the aftertaste kicked me while I was down. The bitter-like pine is amazing and the malts make this beer a delicious tree and this is how nature should taste. The bitterness stays on the tongue and even just looking at this drink I could feel it on my taste buds.  Mouthfeel  The mouthful is light and the carbonation is pretty mild. A lacing is pretty present on the tongue, but I feel like it doesn't coat the whole mouth. I guess a drink doesn't need to coat the whole mouth to make it's impact though.  Overall  This IPA is just like heaven in my opinion. Maybe it's because I love the taste of trees that this does so much for me. I could easily say that this is the best tasting IPA I've ever had, but there are still so much I need to taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,notsoprobeer,4.12,"Golden straw (hazy) in color. It had a big fluffy white head that dissipated slowly and left lacing on the glass. Very strong aroma of grapefruit and floral hops. First, I tasted some caramel and sweet malts. When it hit the back of my mouth, the bitterness of the citrus hops kicked in a big way. Alcohol taste was not noticeable. It finishes dry with bread-like malts and resiny hop bitterness. Light to medium in body. It had medium carbonation and a nice effervescent mouth feel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CheezyBlaster,4.5,"Sometimes I think the west coasters are crazy. Silly amounts of suds on the pour, leaves a bubble bath all over the snifter as I drink.  The intense pine/grapefruit nose and flavor are what I've come to expect from West Coast manifestations of IPA, especially from Stone. Peach and mango became so clear to me in a second serving! It's definitely not old world! Good lord, this stuff is insanely drinkable too. One could get into a lot of trouble. Nice full body and only a slight lingering grapefruit peel/bitterness. I could session this gargoyle!!!  Okay, not really ""session"" . . . that would be a very bad idea, at 6.9% and not really being a session beer in the slightest, no, I wouldn't . . . but still could drink a few without blowing out the old palate!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BareFeetPete,3.82,"What can I say? It's an American IPA. It's hoppy, it's bitter, it's bubbly, it's delicious. Having grown up in an area where beer lovers worship Sierra Nevada, I can say with a lot of confidence that no amount of hoppiness can faze me anymore.  The smell right out of the bottle is pretty overpowering, but if you like hops (even if you don't just do your best to get over the smell) you should be able to get the first taste down pretty easily.  It's very smooth, lightly carbonated, not nearly as carbonated as most Sierra products I've had, and easy to put away.  Overall it's a very standard IPA. There isn't a whole lot I can say about it to wow you into going and buying it, but I will say it's very drinkable and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a new IPA to try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jugs_McGhee,2.77,"Served on draught into a generic beer glass at The Lab in South Central Los Angeles (by USC). Reviewed from notes.  A: Pours a two finger head of nice soft cream, fair thickness, and decent retention. Colour is a hazy light gold.  Sm: Light floral and banana notes, some bubblegum, and orange peel. A moderate strength aroma.  T: Admixtures of the notes on the nose form a bad balance. Structurally, it's problematic, with no satisfying climax. Poorly built and balanced.  Mf: Sharp, coarse, and wet. Terrible. Doesn't suit the body at all. A classic example of the problem with IPAs.  Dr: I was disappointed having heard such great things about Stone Brewing. I paid 5 USD in LA, which isn't terrible, but I don't care much for this one.  2.58  --- 12/05/13: It's been over 2 years since I sat down with this beer, and I figured I'd add some truncated notes since my palate's probably developed.  12 fl oz brown glass bottle served into a conical Guinness pint glass in Castle Rock, CO. Reviewed live. Enjoy by: 12/24/13.  Served cold. Side-poured.  A: No bubble show.  Pours a 3 finger wide head of white colour. Fluffy. Okay creaminess. Decent thickness. No lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. Retention is above average - about 4 minutes.  Body colour is a clear textbook copper of above avg vibrance. No yeast particles are visible. Translucent.  Standard fare for an IPA overall. Not unique or special.  Sm: Plenty of generic floral hop character. Pale malts. A hint of grapefruit. Pine. Some mango. Maybe even passionfruit. Fairly grassy. Plenty of hop bitterness is detectable, and the malts seem inadequate to balance it. I'm really concerned about the balance. There's maybe a brief hint of crackery malts.  A clean aroma - no yeast character or alcohol presence is noticeable.  T: Hop character: primarily floral, with some lighter notes of pine, mango fruit, grapefruit, and some tropical fruit. The pine is nice I guess. As it warms, I pick up a stale orange juice note - one of the off-notes that indicates a subpar IPA.  Pale malts. Maybe some caramalt.  The hop bitterness overwhelms what little malty sweetness there is, resulting in an annoying imbalance. I do like some of the fruity notes here. It has a loose cohesion, but feels a bit thrown together. Too bitter on the finish. Not gestalt, unique, special, nuanced, intricate, complex, or subtle. Average depth and duration of flavour. Above average intensity of flavour.  Mf: Smooth, wet, rough, unrefreshing, and overcarbonated. Suits the flavour profile okay. Doesn't seem at all custom-tailored to the taste.  Dr: Downable but problematic. Stone, as usual, displays little awareness of balance with this beer. I won't be buying it again if I can help it, nor would I recommend it to friends. I remain shocked by this beer's high ratings. It's by no means world-class, or even above average. I stand by my initial rating.  C-  *** 12/10/20 1 bottle was included in Stone's Twelve Days of IPAs Christmas pack ($25.99 USD/12 different IPAs) so I'm once again revisiting this beer. Currently ranked #68 on the IPA - American beers list (no small feat!) with a 94 overall score.  ""West Coast Style IPA."" 6.9% ABV. 71 IBUs. Brewed with ""Magnum, Chinook, Centennial, Azacca, Calypso, Motueka, Ella & Vic Secret™.""  Floral, a bit citrusy. Pale malt. That's really all I get. Simplistic and shallow...just a boring dull attempt at an IPA with a mediocre hop profile.  No pine at all to my palate...I'm not sure why the Centennial isn't coming through at all, but this is no Bell's' Two Hearted. No passionfruit or tropical character from the Azacca.  Tastes like a bastardized English IPA if anything, not an American IPA proper. Finishes overbitter with the Magnum dialed up to an unnecessary extent.  Drinkable but lackluster. I continue to fail to understand the appeal of this beer...its hop profile is dull and it's fundamentally imbalanced. Why buy this over Sierra Nevada Celebration, Bear Republic Racer 5, Lagunitas IPA, Alpine-brewed Alpine IPA, et al. (and that's just naming widely distributed IPAs from California alone, nevermind other states' expressions of the style or breweries with a much smaller distribution footprint)?

147,88,nrs207,4.2,"This beer pours a beautiful golden color. Not clear, but quite delicious looking.  This isn't even exceptionally fresh, as it says enjoy by 9/26/11, but I got it from the only place that sells it in six packs around me. Not even considering that, it smells and tastes delicious.  Citrus and piney hops are quite fragrant. No malt to speak of.  The taste backs that up, it almost doesn't live up to the smell but the citrus flavor gives it a mouthwatering juiciness that keeps you wanting more. Goes down very easily.  The mouthfeel is quite smooth. I've had a IPAs that have a better mouthfeel, which kept me from giving it a perfect score. But it is still very good.  Overall, definitely try this if you can. A solid IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The smell is out-of-this-world good. Loads of citrus hops hit the nose with a wallop. The taste is all hops. Delicious grapefruit flavor with touch of pine. Plenty of bitterness makes this a hop-head's dream, and not for the faint-of-tongue.

The smell of this brew gives off a good blend of malts and hops, the hops are strong on the nose like they should be. The taste is really nice here, just a really drinkable IPA. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and has a good carbonation to it.

Pours a murky copper color with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to an island of foam sitting on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace mark the drink down on the sides of the glass. Smell is of pungent pine and herbal hops and a slight malt aroma. Taste is of the pine and herbal hops up front with a malt backbone coming through on the finish. A medium level of bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level making for a crisp and clean mouthfeel.

Appearance: Poured into a pint glass, poured with a solid two finger amount of head.  Smell and Taste: Apricots, Grapefruit and other citrus smells. I also catch a little bit of pine too.

147,88,rdilauro,4.5,"What can I not say about this super Ale!  The pour was a vivid golden tan, almost like a faint sunburst orange. The small but full white head stood atop of this brew. Once I put my nose into the glass, I was in hop heaven! The hop aroma came out so very bold, you could almost anticipate the bitterness. Yet, at first sip, the bitterness was well balance with a full body, a little citrus, perhaps orange . Each time I put my nose into the glass all that comes out is HOPS, HOPS and more HOPS. Yet the actual taste is so easy. The finish is actually very smooth and lingering. Some where down the pour, I also detected some very rip pears.

Tons of reviews for this one so I'll keep it short.  Huge, foamy, off white head of 2 1/2 inches that lasts forever but eventually disipates to a small island of foam. Lacing is alright but random and viscous. Crystal clear medium yellow with an ever so slight orange tint.  Not a whole lot going on with the smell. Some tropical aromas and a bit of pine but mot much there. Taste is mostly bitterness with a good apricot and citrus finish.Light bodied, high bitterness and medium carbonation with small bubbles gives this one a velvety mouthfeel, making it very drinkable but a bit odd.

S: Subdued citrus and a little pine, not too much there.  T: Citrus fruit flavors, almost reminiscent of fruit loops because I get a nice hint of grain at the end. No hints of alcohol. I'm surprised that these higher abv IPAs hide the alcohol so well.  M: A little thin for me, not bad though in fact good just not exceptional. Light carbonation.

A: Poured a translucent, golden color with a good inch of thick, creamy head atop that seems to last forever and leaves plenty of lacing around the glass as you drink. Carbonation levels are great.  S: The aroma smacks of fresh citrus and pine hops with a little bit of grass. Pretty one-sided, but enticing.  T: Taste follows the nose: entirely hop-centric, sure to please hop-heads and those familiar with West Coast IPA's, but also some barley present, though not as predominantly as in the pale ale. I could use a bit more balance. A bit piney for me as well, but better on tap than in the bottle.  M: Medium bodied, smooth and creamy mouthfeel with ample carbonation and a bit of substance. Very drinkable.  O: Exactly what was to be expected, this is the flagship American West Coast IPA and the one that all others will be judged on. That said, I prefer a bit more balance in my IPA's as well as the more grapefruit, citrus oriented hops, but I would never turn one of these down.

I know from experience that’s a way bars can extend the life of their kegs. Sneaky!  Straw/golden color, clean and clear, with tiny bubbles rising up and releasing all sorts of floral, delicate hoppy aromas. Yum! This is a beer to inhale at your leisure.  Of course you can drink it, which is what I prefer. The beer dances on the palate. There’s a definite hop bite to it, with a clean, sharp finish. Great carbonation. A little maltiness to balance the sting. More floral than piney hops, although I get a sense they’re in there too. (Again, I need to work on my hop education.)

Smell - Big citrus, red grapefruit, orange zest, with a little sweet pineapple in the back. Really smells nice.  Taste - Holy citrus heaven! Really big juicy citrusy flavors here! Starts with strong ruby red grapefruit, orange zest, there is also some slite spice here - maybe coriander. The front half of the sip has a slight malt honey sweetness, then citrus hops coat the tongue nicely, ending in a drying bitter pine. The dried citrus peel and pine go way long into the finish, and remain sticky on the palate until the next sip. Alcohol is completely hidden.  Mouthfeel - low to medium carb gives this beer an almost creamy feel, which totally amps the citrus as it coats your tongue. Finish is dry and piney. Really a good mouthfeel.

147,88,thatruth,4.25,"picked up a sixer on sale from the Safeway near Alaska Junction in West Seattle for 8.99. can you believe that? poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass.  pours a 1/2"" light-tannish cream head with a slippery, mediocre lacing. body's a bright amber with a warm darker middle, this beer had quite a bit of sediment.  scent of hoptopia, odd soapy smell, raunchy banana, and lime. bready and citrus aroma.  tastes like someone spiked the punch. again, citrus and hops brigade on the taste buds. 6.9% hidden very well by the smells and flavors, and not at all in a bad way.  mouthfeel is wet for an IPA. roomy in the mouth and bright. citrus infused hops - at least what they seem like - linger on. like bud light lime had a wet dream of what it could be.  a badass IPA. I really can't believe I found this brew for so cheap. it could easily go for twice as much.  enjoy by date: 10/11/11",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sk8man121,4.4,"12 oz bottle poured into DT tulip. Best by 10/11.  A: Pours hazy candied orange peel with apricot highlights. Nice head settles into a thin cap, leaving quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Just read about the chill haze in recent batches, and it's quite apparent here.  S: Citrus, grapefruit, pine needles, sweet cream. Mmm...  T: Juicy malts up front with a nice herbal center. A little bit of butter in the center, but not enough to bother me. Finishes dry and crisp.  M: Nice and creamy with a medium body. Exactly what I'm looking for in an IPA  O: This is one of the most talked about off-the-shelf IPAs, and for good reason. It's insanely drinkable, not to mention delicious with every sip. My only gripe is that it's ABV is a bit high for a standard IPA offering at 6.9. Then again, no need to drink five beers in a single setting anyway.  Benchmark, for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,morebeergood,3.92,"Had a few bottles of these on Friday night at a local Middle Eastern restaurant. Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice vibrant orange body with a fine white head. Moderate carbonation and lacing. Smell was full of hop aroma. Very potent, just like a lot of the West Coast IPAs tend to be. Taste was also mostly hops, and that lent a nice pine-like flavor to the beer. Very crisp beer, with a bit of dryness at the end. Not an over the top IPA, so it was enjoyable to drink. Plus the high abv was not much of a factor. I thought it paired well with the spiciness of the evening's Lebanese food. Good match.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kaips1,4.74,"the classic stone ipa, this one a 12oz from a bottle into a snifter glass  this one is a staple in the diet when i can afford it, a nice strong pour brings a finger or two of white frothy head that lays on a body of gold clarity that is part of stone ipa. the lacing is not strong but thats ok and there is a little bit of legs to let you know it was there. the smell of citrus and grapefruit hit first small bits of pungent next and a slight sweet that follows. the taste is not let down by the smell at all, full of citrusey fruit tones and sharp hop bitterness jump out at you, it has a slight drop at the end of the sip but works with the punch you get from the first of the drink. the mouthfeel is very lively with lots of jumpy carbonation that attacks the tongue but if ate with spicey and i mean spicey food its not there at all. overall i love this beer, drinkability is outstanding and an easy everyday all day beer for me. one of my favs of stone hands down",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hoagie1973,3.23,"Slightly hazy golden amber with a 1 & 1/2 finger foamy head. Plenty of sticky lacing. Piney, citric hop nose with some underlying bready malt. Starts sweet and fruity then transitions late into a overly strong acrid bitterness in the finish that continues to intensify long after the sip. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Fresh and tasty to start, but too much straight bitterness way too long into the finish for my taste. Not my favorite IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChrisSimpson1968,4.42,"He shoots, he scores! This is a wondeful IPA... Pours an orange-caramel into the glass, with a sticky, frothy head, medium retention and wonderful webbed lace. The nose has all you’d expect: grapefruit, citrus, pine, floral accents. These transfer directly into the flavor dept. There is a faint caramel malty sweetness which underlies a huge hop contingency. Grapefruit, citrus, and candy orange slices are noted in the mid-palate, whereas the side- and back-palate are peppered perfectly with a mildly-lingering pine resin dry-hop. All of the wonderful complexities of this brew come together almost flawlessly. It has a very nice, refreshingly creamy (and cleansing) finish that works wonders for the overall effect! Truly, one of the best IPA’s one can have.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tballz420,4.25,"Stone IPA is an orange colored brew, medium sized white head with loads of lacing. The scent is pretty interesting and enticing. Some caramel malts, but loads of piney hop, citrusy hop, grapefruity hop. The flavor is very good too; nice sweet malt start, but the main focus is on the west coast panoply of hops. Citrus, lemon, pine, some bitter but not as much, some grapefruit. Lot's of variety in the hops, but none are overwhealming. Medium bodied.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DrewV,4.02,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass.  A: Hazy golden yellow with a frothy 2-finger white head. Decent lacing, but nothing spectacular.  S: Floral/piney hops up front with the citrus notes and malt playing lesser roles.  T: Follows the nose, hop-forward, somewhat light, the malt definitely takes a back seat. More piney hops, very fresh, as if you were chewing on a hop flower itself.  M: Moderately thick body, creamy, oily texture. Below-average carbonation, but satisfactory. Highest marks here, mainly due to the creamy mouthfeel.  O: Another solid offering from Stone. I think I prefer a maltier base, like Arrogant Bastard, but certainly nothing to find fault with here. You could do worse than this for sure. At nearly 7%, I'm amazed that there's no sign alcohol burn whatsoever with this brew. Very well crafted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,match1112,4.65,"a: a is for awesome, pours a slightly cloudy straw color with a big two finger thick dish soap like head that lasts forever.  s: s is for superb. tons of citrus hops, when you get this fresh there is nothing like it.  t: t is for tasty. lots of citrus grapefruit flavor.  m: m is for more, as in i need more! smooth yet filling with a slightly bitter dry finish.  o: is for obsess. because i cant wait to go get more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CFHMagnet,4.42,"An average pour delivered a finger of lovely near white head. Body is yellow-orange with a lot of bubbles rising to the top. A bit of sediment is noted near the bottom.  Nice hops! Floral and sweet citrus hops work extremely well together for a very fresh nose with a slight spicy bite. There is also a bit of breadiness and malt in there to flesh out the diverse but not overpowering nose.  There is a faint citrus zing up front, then the floral hops come cascading through. This is followed by a teaser of malt. Ends with spiced bread and a bitter lingering taste. I love it!  I have to call this one light bodied. It just rushes over the tongue so fast, and the carbonation definitely makes itself known. Bitterness that is pleasant and not overpowering stays with for a while. Dry finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kinsman,4.09,"Time to revisit an old friend and give it a proper review. Enjoy by date: 10/12/11  Hazy glowing orange body capped by a creamy white head, about 2 fingers thick to start. Aroma is full of grapefruit and orangy awesomeness alongside a slight bit of pine resin. Not much room for the malt to come through but some bread and biscuit notes can be picked up.  Not quite the hop bite I remember but still plenty of bitterness to go around. Fruity and slightly floral hop character. Solid malt backbone to back it up but still very much a hop-forward beer.  Mouthfeel is smooth with a solid medium body feel and a lively carbonation. Overall, Stone IPA might just be the quintessential American IPA. Fruity and bitter and oh so wonderful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JohnnyBarman,4.08,"Bomber picked up at Consumer Beverages in Buffalo. One of those beers that I've been meaning to try, but isn't readily available in Ontario and didn't have that flashy appeal of some of the more intriguing imperial stouts and DIPAs out there. But there's lots to be said for well-made brews that fall in to more ""standard"" style categories.  Poured into a couple of nonics to be shared with my wife. Pours a hazy bright orange-golden hue, with a big frothy head and nice lacing. Good looking brew.  Nose is sweet, malty, with nice floral citrus and pine hop notes. Tropical fruit (grapefruit and mango) abound.  Considerably more hoppy than I had expected, in that the malt character is quite subdued. Still, all the great flavors are there - citrus, pine, floral hops, tropical fruit, caramel and pale malts. Long bitter finish. An enjoyable IPA. Nicely carbonated, creamy.  A textbook IPA, rich and hoppy. Standard, but high-quality. Glad I picked this bottle up!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jimmys,4.2,"A: a hazy bright orange. can see bits of yellow around the edges of the glass. orangey white head. retention isnt great but the lacing is.  S: minty, herbal. american pine hops. if i had to guess i would say there is some centennial in there.  T: a solid toast, grainy cereal. glistening citrus works very well with herbal hoppy undertones. finish is bitter but not without a malt sweetness bringing a nice balance.  M: a very very mild carbonation on a medium full body. wouldnt hate a touch more fizz.  D: the balance between the hops and the grain couldnt be much better than in this pint. as most everyone that uses this site knows, very enjoyable brew from stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jerone,4.08,"The appearance is a slightly cloudy with a straw/golden color with a few bubbles coming up, frothy head and great lacing.  Smell is of hops! Floral and citrusy.  The taste is nice and hoppy with citrus notes of lemon and grapefruit and some floral character as well. There is also a bit of a malt sweetness to balance it out. The ending is bitter but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium with a bit of carbonation.  A solid IPA that is not overpowering but has everything that you would want.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MadCat,4.5,"Appearance: A nice golden color with good white head, leaving some lacing  Smell: Very hoppy, spicy, herbal hops  Taste: As you would expect from an IPA, there is plenty of hop character here. Herbal and spicy hops. There is some decent malt sweetness to balance out some of the hops  Mouthfeel: Medium body, full carbonation  Overall: Very good and enjoyable. Probably the gold standard IPA as far as I can tell. It is hard to tell it is 6.9% abv as well, it's so easy drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mechamifune,3.99,"Have had this many times on tap and bottled, so I thought it was finally time to give a proper review.  Pours the usual gold/straw color of most ""west coast"" ipa's. In this particular bottle there is a good bit of setiment floating around, which is odd because I have never seen that in this beer before. Slight white head with good lacing. Usualy appearance would go for a 4.0 as I think of this as a very clean looking beer, but this time I'll have to put it down to a 3 because of the setiment.  Smell is citrus and hops all the way, though it is not one of the more overwhelmingly floral IPA's. But even though the smell is not particularly strong, the notes are what they should be.  Taste is in line with smell, but stronger. Not much of a malt backbone to speak of. Lots of citrus flavors up front followed by a good amounts of bitterness and finishing with almost a little bit of an apple juice taste (odd). Still a very good hop forward ipa.  Mouthfeel is probably the highlight of the beer. Just the right balance of smoothness and crispness. Carbonation is perfect, and for a beer with such powerful flavors going on, it is pretty easy to drink.  Overall I think of this as kind of the standard for west coast style ipas. Not the best, mind you, but note for note it respresents such a good base line for that style. If I had one complaint, it is that there seems to be a little more variance from serving to serving than I would expect given the pure quantity of this beer that stone has/had brewed over the years. But even within that range, it has been between good and friggin great. Oddly enough, I have had the same issue with their neighbors down the road, green flash, and their ipa (and no, it has not been an issue of age on the beer)....but I digress.... this is a great (and easy to get)west coast ipa, and if you are a fan of the style you should seek it out. Save yourself the 5 bucks, pass over the ruination 6 pack, and pick it up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jazzyjeff13,4.3,"A 12 oz bottle with a BB of August 2011. Picked up from Beeritz in Leeds - my first Stone brew! I love the label style on their bottles.  Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A hazy golden-amber hue with a good level of fine carbonation. Produces a huge head of white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a surface layer. A powerful hoppy aroma greets the nose, underpinned by a generous dose of sweet malt. Notes of pine, resin, citrus and brown sugar.  Tastes of rich, sweet malt with an intense hoppy bitterness. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, pine, and citrus. The hops have a spicy quality that warms the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied, with tingly carbonation and considerable astringency. Aftertaste of pine bitterness.  Excellent. Aromatic and bitter with a good malty backbone. This typifies the American IPA style - nicely balanced with stacks of hop character. A must-have beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brunite,3.36,"A: Pours a pale straw-yellow color with a decent head.  S: The smell was plenty of hops with a predominance of floral and grassy notes.  T: The taste was disappointing. No sense of any malt at all. All hop bitterness...and not in a way that appealed to me. I get that thi is an IPA...but just bitter is not what I want.  M: Pretty good...medium bodied.  O: One and done for me. There are other IPA's I prefer. Two hearted, Green Flash, Hop Devil.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jondeelee,4.2,"Stone is not a brewery to be taken lightly. With their penchant for adding more hops to their light beers than most brewers stick in an Imperial IPA, it comes as no surprise that even their entry-level IPA smells intensely of pine and grapefruit. Below that bitter layer rests orange and apricot scents, and a good noseful of brown sugars.  On the tongue, hops are front and center, the brew's 77 IBUs translating into an instant pine and grapefruit shock that makes identifying other flavors difficult. Still, there are other tastes there: orange and lemon peel, brown sugar, banana, and hints of wildflower honey. The aftertaste, like the rest of the mouthful, is dominated by hops, and lasts for quite a while.  Overall, Stone's IPA is good fare, and definitely does not shy away from the hops. Hop-lovers will rejoice at this bitterness, but at the same time, many of the beer's more subtle flavors get lost in the mix, marking a possibly huge weakness (depending on your tastes).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jnn4v,4,"Consumed within 30 minutes of getting the growler filled.  A: Dark yellow / pale orange color. Very slight haze. No sediment. Some off-white / very-light orange colored head.  S: Peach, bready yeasty malt, orange, and grapefruit.  T: Very similar to the scents, but with a slight resiny / piney aftertaste. Very clean and relatively basic textbook IPA flavor. Balanced malt and hops, but in the aftertaste, the hops win out.  M: Medium viscosity. Moderate carbonation with moderately-sized bubbles.  O: Everything is textbook about this beer from the scent to the flavor to the mouthfeel. A good benchmark IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,1Adam12,3.92,"Pours golden, frothy head. Smells AWESOME! Very hoppy, very citrusy. The taste was a let down. Did not taste as hoppy as the smell, nor as citrusy as the smell. Not a big fan of the bitterness. Total let down. Typical mouthfeel for an IPA. Solid carbonation. Overall, the bitterness killed this for me. I think without the bitterness, this would've been better. Also, I wish the taste would've matched up with the nose.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,metal850,3.9,"A: Pours with a 2.5 finger off white head theat leaves great lacing. Golden in color with a slight haze.  S: Big hoppiness, with citrus, grass, and resin notes. Nice subtle malt background.  T: Intensly bitter with a strong hop flavor of resins and earthiness. Malt is there, but just enough to tell you that this is malt based beer you are drinking.  M: Crisp with a low carbonation.  O: Good IPA, very assertive as Stone is known for.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dvsbizzyb,3.38,Appearance - Shows a bright golden orange with a very thin white head. Leaves a nice lacing throughout the glass.  Smell - Strong hop scent with hints of citrus in the background.  Taste - Dominant hop flavor that lingers on the tongue but an aftertaste of grapefruit and an unknown sweetness help balance it out very well.  Mouthfeel - This has a refreshing feel to it. It's on the low side of medium as far as carbonation goes which is great. Leaves a mellow coating of bitterness but nothing overbearing.  Overall - I really enjoyed this beer. It is well balanced and highly drinkable.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,grittybrews,4.51,"Poured a rich, hazy orange-amber into a tulip with two fingers of fluffy white head. Fresh, juicy pine aroma with hints of grapefruit and caramel.  Moderate carbonation and a creamy, slick mouthfeel. Bread and gentle orange/grapefruit up front with some slightly sweet caramel and a dry finish with pine and grass.  Very nice IPA -- it's one of the last major offerings from Stone that I've tried, but it shouldn't be upstaged by its flashier siblings. This IPA is spot-on!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mdcrouser,4.43,"Upon rumor of Stone having a ""Kansas City""-branded bottle on the market here in the last week or so, I went on the search for it, hitting a couple of area liquor stores before finding three cases - I left all but one bottle behind.  Poured from the 22 oz. bottle, noting that we're the ""top dog"" of BBQ, suggesting that it would pair well with the beer. We'll see about that.  Tiny pocks of tannish head that you can almost tell will lace, throw shadows through the somewhat cloudy golden-orange beer. Picking up some sediment as well.  Piercing with herbal and citrus notes on the nose, filling it with promise of what's to come.  Herbs and greenery on the tongue, spicy too with the hops at the fore. Closes with a hint of carmelization and like a fading light, slowly muting to the tongue.  What an outstandingly good IPA - less citrus than many, but more of the herbs than most, which really turns your tastebuds on their ear.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,fdkayti,4.3,"A- A straw colored, semi-opaque beer with an almost bashful white head, decent retention. Layers of lacing down the side of the glass.  S- Pine/citrus hops, a slight sweetness. Slight yeasty, bready smell. Smells like the flower room at the funeral home.  T- A pretty big hop blast to the face. Serious bitterness, a grapefruit with no sugar. Maltiness arrives as it warms up.  MF- Good carbonation, medium mouthfeel. Dry and almost harsh. Bitterness lingers and then lingers some more.  O/D- Just what I was looking for tonight- more bitter than balanced, made my eyes red. A happy example of the style, I think.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lewis8,4.5,"a- Poured this beauty into a tulip glass. Slight haze with a nice light honey color. It looks great in this glass and has excellent lacing.  s- You definetly can smell those centennial hops in there. A big citrus and floral nose coming through. Oranges and grapefuit with a touch of pine.  t- The taste is very similar to the smell. You get a good bitterness upfront with a huge citrus blast. Then you taste the malt, which is slight. It has a touch of graineness in a good way. Then finishes super dry, which i love in an ipa.  m- The mouthfeel is great in this beer. It coats your mouth enough to enjoy the malts, but then finishing dry to make it crisp and refeshing.  o- This is an excellent beer for a true hophead. It showcases all the aspects of a great american ipa. A highly recommended beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,roodie,4.17,"Enjoyed on tap at Sandy's in Huntington Beach  Served in a pint glass  A: pours a tea brown with white foamy head with good retention. Lacing covers the length of the glass  S: hoppy piney bitterness resin like quality. No real fruit or malty component  T: hop forward. Bitter the way a good IPA should be. Some malty sweetness contributed at the end  M: bitterness dries out the palate.

147,88,tobelerone,3.84,"Was looking forward to trying this one for a while but have to say I was slightly disappointed. Nice beer but doesn't really stand out for me amongst a crowded IPA field packed with great beers. This one looks nice, cloudy light amber color and modest head; smell is slightly floral hops, continuing in the taste. Bitterness is pretty restrained for a west coast IPA. Mouthfeel is thin enough, medium carbonation, definitely highly drinkable.  Perhaps I got an old bottle; there was no dating but I did buy it from a very solid store that keeps the product moving. Overall the flavors were a bit more muted than I would have liked but this is a solid B IPA nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GDBEERMAN,4.3,"12oz bottle into tulip, from notes.  A: A bright, murky straw body, with a good layer of white head. Lacing is formed in layers.  S: Aroma of very floral hops, slightly herbal and earthy. Medium hop intensity.  T/M: Cleans the palate with a juicy burst of liquid hop flavor. Bitterness catches up with the body and dries things out. Lingering finish is strong bitter and dry, while mouthfeel is quite refreshing. Malt body is present, but hops are leaning on the heavier side.

147,88,huhl23,4.5,"Another hop-tastic treat from Stone. A vigorous pour creates a beautiful cascading effect, and the lumpy, sticky head is also very pleasing to the eye. Hazy orange color. Soooo aromatic. Pineapple, citrus fruit, and raw, herbal hops- intense aromas. Very complex taste. Nice fruitiness and surprising sweetness. Hop character is bitter and long-lasting, and perhaps a bit medicinal. Herbal for sure. The finish dries up a little, and the oily hop feel is replaced by a more leafy one. Some spice (perhaps from the alcohol) in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery, but the hops make up for it. As a Hophead, this brew makes me very happy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cbonham,5,"Jesus what an incredible beer. After having tried (and enjoyed on several occasions) some Arrogant Bastard Ale (in a bomber no less) I purchased a 6 pack of Stone IPA for $9 today. My immediate reaction? Jesus. The pour is nothing short of beautiful. A foam head at least 1"" thick comes up as soon as the beer hits the glass. The color of the beer itself appears to be the same color as honey is. The smell is definitely a lot of hops, with a strong scent of pine as well. Very, very hoppy. Taste-wise, between the intense amount of hops being present in the beer and the taste of pine and a tiny bit of grapefruit, it's one of a few beers that is actively kicking my ass. All in all, this is a beer that is automatically on my top five list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CountJustinian,4.38,Pours with a hazy orange glow and a foamy head of at least two inches. Head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves minimal lacing. Nose is very hoppy with an herbal and fruity smell. Taste is hoppy with mildly fruity malts. Medium carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel with restrained bitterness. Very drinkable.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JTSbeerislife,3.94,"12 oz. bottle poured into a British Imp Nonic.  Case marked 6/2011, which I believe is a born on date.  Pours a nice one to two finger head which rapidly settles to a 1/4” cap and then to a thin film. Golden amber color with some depth and obviously not filtered. Very little “lacing”. An average looking IPA.  A good aroma of citrusy hops, light yeast, and as this ale warms some malt, nothing overly exciting here but quite enjoyable.  Nice crisp entry in the mouth, medium to full bodied, with the main flavor being the nice fruity citrus hops, the hops give way to some pleasant bitterness, and eventually a little malt comes thru as the ale warms.  Has a good finish of lingering bitter hops, very good length, quite enjoyable.  OK, not a heavy hitter but certainly a very drinkable IPA, refreshing, one I would drink on the colder side, say around 45 degrees, and suitable for a warm summer day. The finish is the most distinctive component of this ale and definitely adds to the overall enjoyment. Average ABV for this style. Sells for approximately $42 around here so it’s no bargain when I can buy Victory Hop Devil for less.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ummswimmin,4.42,"This is another example of a beer that I have had many times, but finally reviewed today.  Stone IPA pours with a pretty aggressive head. I used a tulip glass, and got three fingers before reaching the pour line.  I can smell the hoppiness way before I pull the glass to my nose. There is a pretty strong smelling head of pine and citrus.  In my first taste I am reminded of the difference between East Coast and West Coast IPA's. The hopping is much stronger in the West Coast... this is only half a step away from a DIPA. The bitterness is present, but not over-powering.  Overall, Stone did a great job. It isn't a surprise that this is on the beers of fame.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Number967,3.3,Drinking this right now poured out of a bottle into a Pint glass. Nice head and color. The smell is right on with other ipas. As for the taste... I had stone ipa ruination last week and personally I think this brew does more damage to your palate. Hops are very strong. Immediately attacking the back of your tongue. I feel like I can only have 2 of these and then I can't taste anything. Cant taste much alcohol but the buzz comes in nice and easy. It's a quality beer but i prefer something a bit more drinker friendly.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- Sharp and aggressive with some citrus  T- Wonderfully bitter and strong with a nice undercurrent of citrus notes  M- Smooth, not overcarbonated, not too thick or too thin for an IPA  Fantastic beer. My friend handed me a bottle. We were looking after a house and I didn't want to bother him with a request for a glass (being that he'd have to wash it) so I just drank it from the bottle as he was. Still an exceptional beer, even just out of the bottle. Can't imagine how incredible it is in a glass much less on tap. Great beer.

S- Citrus, pine, and tropical fruits. There is quite a presence of caramel in the aroma as well.  T- Wonderful citrus and pine come immediately from the hops. The caramel malt is extremely present in the backbone. The aftertaste consists of a sweet caramel/pleasant bitterness.  M- A bit watered down and under-carbonated.  D- Sits very light. No problem putting away several of these bad boys.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SilentBrew,4.42,"An excellent IPA.  The 6.90% abv blends very well with the abundance of hops flavor. The citrusy flavor reminds me of Columbus hops, with the possibility of Simcoe and Centennial.  From the bottle, the beer pours a fairly heaving beer with a medium head. The beer is clearer than the taste would lend you to believe with a very full mouthfeel.  The malt-sweetness melds well with the hops bittering while the aroma returns the experience to sweetness.  It goes down easy for a bigger beer, and is deceptively strong for those not paying close attention.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hoptometrist,4.67,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic glass  A- Pours a nice hazy orangrong e color with a two finger fluffy head that leaves lots of chunky lacing with very little holes in the lacing.  S- Big citrus, some pine, floral, tropical fruit, woodiness, and a little funk. One of the best smelling beers I have ever had, if not the best, and a powerful aroma as well.  T- Citrus, pine, woodiness, and tropical fruit. Has a very nice assertive bitterness to it  M- Very dry beer, finishes very dry with some prickly carbonation  O- This is a great IPA, very aromatic, great flavor, strong bitterness. This is a great beer and a hophead's dream come true. This beer just tasted so fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thourgood,4.62,Pour - is excellent. Thick but pale. Moderate but lasting head Smell - hop heaven Taste - wonderful. My goto IPA. I think there's something missing but I don't know what... Like I haven't tasted it yet Mouthfeel - very enjoyable. Not overly viscous. Overall - for me the standard of well-hopped medium-strong beer. Analysis - great. Could be better but not much.

I suppose the steak is going to have to go with a nice stout later on. And away we go...  A: Well slap me about the face and neck and call me stupid, but it sure looks like an IPA. Light burnt orange in color, a head the color of an orange peel 1cm in height, which dissolves quickly into lace. Pretty good.  S: Surprise, surprise, surprise (50 points to anyone who knows whence came that quote), it smells like an IPA, and a hoppy one at that. I'm getting grapefruit, orange, pine, a little caramel from the malt, not bad at all.  T: Ooh, wee, that's hoppy! Bitter Beer Face! Very piny up front, so much so that you almost miss the grapefruit and caramel. Stone is known for hops, and this doesn't disappoint if that's what you're looking for.  M: For its style, great, not spectacular. It's medium-bodied, not overly carbonated, and leaves a very piny finish.  O: Very good. It's what I would expect from a West Coast beer; hoppy as all heck, and bitter as an ex who finds out you've done better since leaving her. I wish I'd waited to cook the steak and have it with this beer; the saltiness would have cut this hoppiness nicely. Think I'll grab myself a piece of sharp cheddar. Ciao!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,csiewert,4.23,This beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with a finger of foamy white head that retains and lace amazingly. The aroma is strong with caramel malt and earthy hops. The taste starts with some caramel and bready malt and then has citrus notes and finishes with the caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is clean and finishes smooth. Over al a great IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dragonWhale,4.41,"Sipping on this cold delicious and warming beer on this hot day, figured I might as well say some words about it. It is a pleasure, one I rarely anymore so often give myself to where I indulge in this, one of Stone's finest offerings. Sadly, there is so much beer to try and so little time, but today, an old classic reigns in my glass. Frilly lace upon the sides of the caravan as it travels the swivel of my elbow from the table to my mouth. Big time pine in my nose with a little bit of citrus. Drying finish, nice bitterness, subtle malt backbone, just supple enough. This is a classic for a reason. And the reason is love.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,aknight,4.38,"Pours a copper-apricot color with a nice head that quickly dissipates and leaves a nice ring of lacing. The smell is slightly sweet with strong citrus aromas dominating. This beer has a nice grapefruit aroma going on. This is a hop forward IPA. There is a decent malt backbone but the hops steal the show as they should in a west coast IPA. This is a nicely carbonated IPA, not too bubbly but just bubbly enough which really helps to tie the whole package together.  Stone IPA is always around so I don't drink it often but when I do I always question why I don't drink it more often. This is a damn solid IPA, one that I need to remind myself to get reacquainted with from time to time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

(date is a bit tough to spot - laser engraved on the shoulder of the bottle)  pours a bright, clear golden-yellow with a good finger and a half of a frothy beige head. excellent retention and lacing all over the place. for my money this is the archetype of how an IPA should look.  aromatic hoppy nose smacks of grapefruit and pine with a touch of malt in the background.  taste follows and even exceeds the nose. just a really tasty IPA with plenty of juicy citrus, pine, and a touch of herbal-ness. nice dose of sweet malt. excellent beer. medium bodied on the palate with average carbonation.  overall, one of my favorite IPAs. just an excellent, well-made, beer. an exemplar of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DavidST,4.67,"I have a place in my heart for this beer, when I first got started on craft beers, I only drank stouts and porters, assuming that pale beers were all lagers and Bass type ales, then I tried this one and learned about the magnificent world of IPAs. This was probably the second most important beer I tried, so finally a review:  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, best before date of 09/05/11 (this is the freshest I've found this in a while and its so good fresh).  Pours a light golden color with a nice foamy white head, which leaves a nice lacing. The smell is of hops, citrus and pine, some grapefruit and lemon, a little caramel malts but they're mostly hidden behind the hops.  The feel is medium light, lots of hop bitterness coats the mouth. No surprise with the taste, its mostly hops, a hint of malty sweetness on the way down but its quickly overwhelmed with a very bitter hoppy after taste which lingers, there are hints of citrus acidic flavors (grapefruit, lemon) which go nice with the pine hops and it has a great dual taste. I think one of the things I love about this and Green Flash IPA are the extreme hops and bitterness are very present, no double IPA attempt to hide them with lots of malts.  Overall I absolutely love this beer, I've probably drank more of this one than any other, its my go to beer for a night of drinking and it never disappoints. I love it fresh and I even like it past date when the hops die down a little and the citrus flavors shine through, fresh or old I love this beer. Thank you Stone for making me a craft beer lover.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jmvecchio1,4.12,"The beer pours out a clear yellow in color with a light head on top. The aroma off the beer is decadent, floral, and really showcases those traditional West Coast hop varieties. The dry hopping allows for more prominent tones of citrus, pine, and maybe some light woody characteristics as well. The taste of the beer is similar to that showcased in the aroma, it's a homage to hops and easily overpowers the malt profile of the beer. Mostly the beer tastes of citrus and piney hops and swallows with a dry finish with lingering hop resin on the tongue. Overall the drink of this beer is great for those hop heads/IPA lovers who are more taken by the West Coast variety of the beer style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,eclaycamp,3.96,"Having sampled many of Stone’s offerings in the past, I’m finally getting the chance to try their IPA.  This is a 22 ounce bomber that I’m pouring into a goblet. The appearance is hazy, and it almost looks like there is some yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. I didn’t think that Stone bottle conditioned but maybe I’m wrong. Color is a deep golden yielding to copper. Head is minimal but it has gorgeous lacing.  Not surprisingly, hops dominate the nose. This is an IPA, after all, and a West-coast style one, to boot. Fruity citrus hops dominate, followed by floral and musty pine. In the background there’s this wonderful hint of malt caramel sweetness. Often you get an IPA with muted hop character, and that’s certainly not the case here. The smell on this is just so crisp and fresh – a sure sign that this is a very fresh IPA and one that’s been treated with care.  The first taste showcases a nice level of carbonation, and moderate bitterness that isn’t overpowering. Having had Ruination in the past, it’s nice to get a beer from Stone that actually attempts to maintain some semblance of balance. Taste has a nice residual sweetness to it, including in the finish. It’s easy to finish IPAs with bitterness, but this, surprisingly, seems to go more towards the sweet side. That said the body of the beer is light, dry, and refreshing. Lots of flavor for something that goes down so easily. The label says 6.9% ABV but the alcohol is never apparent.  Stone gets a lot of praise for the other beers that they produce, but this is an underrated example of the West-Coast IPA style. It’s a little bit light in body, but this lends to easy drinking. The hop profile and underrated malt backbone make this beer a winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Diesel76,3.95,"As a fan of IPA (and a fan of Stone in general) this is a good but very mild IPA. Its taste is mild and smooth. I would have loved to have had some more hop flavor... it has the look and smell of a good IPA.... but, could use just more... oomph! That said, I have had it a few times, when I am in the mood...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,obrike,4.35,"My first review of this...what the f@#k?  An exceptional IPA...probably in my top 5 I would say.  Nothing to fancy about the look...honey-toned, decent head...doesn't last too long, but a thin white ring remains for the entire drink.  The smell...oh the smell. Mmmmm. I could smell it as soon as it was cracked. Hoppy goodness in a bottle. A lovely mix of fresh pine needles, sweet caramel, and fresh citrus. So good. This is the scent that all IPAs should strive for.  Sharp, biting flavor. That mix of sharp hops and sweet malt blends perfectly. I also noticed a bit of a spice too...not sure what, but lovely. The beer drinks like butta...super smooth, so easy to drink, especially for a nearly 7% brew.  Although it's a bit pricey for a 6 pack, this is a classic American IPA...one not to be missed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rawfish,4.15,"Pours a nice orange gold with a fine chill haze. Capped with a inch high white foam, good retention with a decent amount of cloudy lacing sticks to the glass.  Nice malt profile with some noticable toast and honey. Floral hops with citrus and pine, nuances of apple, peach and pears shine through. Good complexity and nice and strong.  Bready malts with a touch of honey and apples. Hop flavor is pine and citrus but more balanced than the nose would indicate. Finishes drying and bready with a huge kick of bitterness that lingers on.  Smooth with adequate carbonation and body. Finishes very dry and bitter, parched feel on the tongue after a bottle.  I thought I had seen a nice spectrum of IPAs up to this point but Stone really kicked me to the curb with this one. Bitterness is really up there, great smell, and very balanced. Hop heads rejoice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RickS95,4.5,"Looks great. An orangy peach color, just full of enough stuff that it's a hazy orangy peach color. A thin white head briefly sits on top.  Smell may have been a 5 and I'm being too critical. Citrus and pine comes thru and dominates everything else.  In general, the mouthfeel isn't exactly smooth, but for an IPA, it's extremely easy on the palate. The citrus sweetness starts immediately before the tartness and bitterness from the hops kicks in. The kick from the bitter is obvious, but doesn't make you want to shave your tongue.  Might be the best IPA I've ever had (and I've said that a lot lately). There are no flaws with this beer and I'm not sure my 4.5s across the board do it justice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dismal,4.37,"Pours light yellowish orange with a nice big white head. The head disappears to almost nothing within a couple minutes but still leaves some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell right away is hops. For just a regular IPA it's probably one of the most hoppiest smelling beers I've had. Citrus, piney, grassy, a bit earthy. Almost like holding hops up to your nose. The taste like the smell is hops. At first it almost seems balanced when it hit's your mouth but then as it sits for a second the hops take over. Citrus, pine, a little grassy. Ends with a nice bitterness and hop bite aftertaste. At almost 7% ABV it's not terribly high so multiple bottles wouldn't be a problem in one sitting. Overall it's a fantastic IPA and one I've been drinking a ton of lately. So when I can't afford Ruination this is definitely a damn good substitute. Another solid beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,deadonhisfeet,4.38,"This 22oz bomber poured out a nice hazy light apricot color with a fine head. Typical IPA aromas abound: lemon, grapefruit, orange, and flowers.  Nice tart, refreshing hop bitterness with a creamy malt background. This is an IPA done right. Wonderful dry citrus flavors, sour apple, herbs, and honey. Very nicely balanced. I don't detect any real graininess and the finish is tart and satisfying.  I can't think of anything wrong with this beer.

Nice fruity aroma with mangos, pears, orange and light malt. Nice bitter taste with an even bigger bite on the swallow. Big malty backbone helps to even it out and there is a long bitter aftertaste that sits well on the buds. More carbonated than I would like from this IPA.

Complex nose of fruit with resiny pine.  The taste follows the nose with a sting of bitter grapefruit on top of biscuity malt and a touch of caramel.

147,88,zac16125,4.45,"22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass  A: Pours a golden amber with just over 2 finger widths of white fluffy, cloud-like head. The head dissipated pretty quickly but leaves a significant amount of cool looking lacing.  S: Hops all over the nose, mostly of the citrus variety with only subtle piney characters. Also there is some sweetness that comes through, with aromas of peach and mango. Great aroma.  T: The first sip is dominated by a fruity sweetness that I wasn’t expecting, although I probably should have after the sweetness in the scent. Hops are certainly appreciated but not as much as I anticipated, especially after all the “hop head” talk on the label. Its sweet up front with hints of orange and mango, then finishes with a hop bitterness on the back end. Really a great balance between sweetness and hop bitterness.  M/D: Smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink with almost no hints of the relatively high 6.9% ABV.  O: Overall, an excellent IPA, that I will put up as one of my favorites. It ended up being not as hop-heavy as I had anticipated, especially considering the strong hop aromas and all the hop head talk on the bottle. But it was a very well balanced and delicious IPA. I certainly recommend it, and will be enjoy again in the future.  On a side note my appreciation for Stone grows with every one of their offerings that I try.

S: Smells of fruity citrus hops and a nice clean yeast profile.  T: Nice hoppy punch of citrus and pine. Well balanced with a decent caramel maltiness that carries a residual sweetness throughout each drink. Dries out the mouth with some pucker and gives off just a tad of heat.  M: Overall a light medium body and probably the only beer I can drink straight from the bottle. This is one of my favorite beers from Stone.  D: An excellent bold IPA that is incredibly smooth and quite sessionable.  Probably a standard in the American IPA category. A showcase of a very well balanced brew. Hoppy but not offensive to the palate in any way with a solid malt base to balance it out.

147,88,azdback,4.35,"Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. Light to medium orange in color, clear with an average amount of very small carbonation bubbles that produce quite a large head. That head is all of three fingers, bright white and very compacted and firm. Lace appears very sticky and does a nice job of coating the inside of my glass with a very thick patchy pattern.  Smell is quite balanced. I smell quite a bit of earthy, grassy smells but at the same time I am pulling out just as many citrus, hop bitterness. It also smells sweet, but on the hop side not the malt side.  Taste is what I expect from a San Diego brew. Citrus hop punch at the front. Flavors of a yellow grapefruit and some peach or maybe mango. The yeast I got from the nose is not at all here in the taste. I find myself licking the bitter sweetness off of my lips. This is coming from the malts and balances well with the bitter hops. Very enjoyable.  The mouth is very bright and crisp. This one is just as the style should be. Not overly sweet and sticky nor too hop bitter. The carbonation is perfect and this stays upright all the way to the belly.  Overall I really enjoyed ""this"" bottle of Stone IPA. I say that because I don't believe I have ever had a fresh bottle of this. Stone has just recently started ""best enjoyed by"" dating their bottles and this one is dated 07/05/11. This is one of the beers that I cut my teeth on but that was 6 or 7 years ago and I haven't really enjoyed any that I have had (since way back then) until this one.

It once made a dinner with business colleagues beerable at a Black Angus (kudos to a chain restaurant for offering it) in Lakewood, CA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,orangesol,4,"Reviewed from notes. Bottle poured into a Hair of the Dog tulip glass.  A - Pours hazy orange with a nice frothy pillow of one and a half finger tall white head leaving light rings of lacing down the glass.  S - Smells of pungent hops; most notably citric and pine; sweet caramel malt, and some fruity esters. Good overall balance of sweet and bitter.  T - Starts off with a nice punch of pungent citric hops slowly giving way to a mix of sweet caramel malt, pine, and some fruity esters. I like how no one flavors dominates the others, it makes it very easy to drink. The finish has some light hop bitterness, lingering for a short period of time. This is one easy drinking, enjoyable, IPA.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Very smooth, crisp, feel with some lingering bitterness in the finish.  O - Pretty good. I could drink this regularly but when you compare it to some of the other offerings available locally it really comes up short. Still a good beer tho.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HopSkank,4.07,"Poured into pint glass. Produced a wonderfully soapy, light- khaki head, which laced the glass for a good period of time. Beautiful light amber coloration.  As soon as I cracked the bottle open, I took in the scent of grapefruit and other subtle aromas, i.e., honey, orange, all balanced with a hoppy backdrop.  There is an immediate bitterness, which quickly concedes to a light grapefruit-like flavor. Being that this is a basic IPA I was not expecting anything outrageous, and the balance that I did expect was all there. The flavor very much matches the aroma.  There is enough carbonation to lend some crispness to the flavor of the beer, without being too overbearing. It is smooth enough to allow the hops too flourish. I do feel, however, that the beer is a tad thin-bodied for my liking. But that is subjective...  Overall, I am very pleased. And were the ABV not above 6%, I would happily session this IPA on a workday. Well, maybe I will anyway...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,karait95,3.65,"A: classical ipa looking a very intense yellow color with an almost white head on top, very prominent and compact with small bubbles that dissipates slowly leaving behind some traces on the glass.  S: an intense hop aroma not to complex, very little alcohol can be sensed with some malt behind the hops.  T: it is a well elaborated ipa, the intense flavor of the hops takes couple of seconds to explode on the mouth, first you feel the malts.  M: first you have a neutral sensation and then starts the bitterness of the hops very strong and lasting a lot in the back of the mouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Herbal hops obvious as well.

Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonated. Leaves a bitter and malty after taste.  Drink- I'll always come back to this one. Such a classic example of what a single IPA can and should be.

S: Smells of fruity citrus hops and a nice clean yeast profile.  T: Nice hoppy punch of citrus and pine. Well balanced with a decent caramel maltiness that carries a residual sweetness throughout each drink. Dries out the mouth with some pucker and gives off just a tad of heat.  M: Overall a light medium body that has some residual stickiness on the tongue. Dries up on the finish.  D: An excellent bold IPA that is incredibly smooth and quite sessionable.

Still very strong on the floral notes in the taste of the beer. One taste made me thirstier.  M- Not too heavy, not too light. Just the right about of crispy carbonated bite to compliment the bitterness of the hops.  O- This is a great IPA.

147,88,vrushing88,4.47,"This beer hold a special place in my heart. My buddy took me out for my 21st birthday a few years back, and ordered this for me as my first craft beer. I had no Idea what ""I.P.A."" was or that their were more breweries outside of the evil ""Big Beer"" companies, Sam Adams, or PA. Breweries.  I was a virgin beer drinker to say the least. I took one sip of this thought ""My God, why would you drink this?"" I finished it as I was told... I did my best to avoid I.P.A.'s for over a year. I got the idea to experiment with them, not entirely sure how/why, Dogfish 90 minute/Southern Tier come to mind as to why I started to enjoy I.P.A. beer.  That brings me back to this brew. Now that I can say ""I enjoy I.P.A., I had to review the beer that brought me into the world of I.P.A. Since I've rambled enough, I'll keep it simple. This beer is angry, hateful, and if you've had a bad day, pop one of these open because they will channel all that aggression into good I.P.A. This beer is aggressive, and angry, yet relaxing and mellowing. It brings a hop-heavy, malt aroma, how a good beer should smell. I personally find that many I.P.A.s taste ""Scummy"" like algae in a pool, but this I.P.A. is as clean as a double I.P.A.

Up front the taste is herbal and piney...hops are there, but not full blown...flavor is great and the bitterness comes through on the finish. Mouthfeel is what I like to call snappy.

Smell is lots of different hop aromas, but none very strong: an orange/citrus Centennial quality, some pine, some grass, earthiness.  Taste is a lot of orange/grapefruit flavors from the Centennial hops, a bit of sweet malt beneath, and a bunch of herbal and pine hop flavors notable as well. Bitterness hits after the swallow and lingers. Hoppy, but the hops don't smack you in the face like I remember them doing when I had this before I had had many IPAs. Still a good hop-forward IPA, though.  Mouthfeel is a titch watery and not escessive, mildly carbonated, and works well with the beer.  Overall, this one is a good IPA.

147,88,Reaper16,4.32,"12oz. bottle served into a tulip glass  Pours a nice yellow orange color, like a school bus paint job. Moderate opacity; I can barely make out the shadows of my fingers through the glass. A little over one finger of sudsy white head leaves adequate lacing. It's unspectacular but pretty.  Classic IPA aromas, delivered with intensity. Grapefruit and pine for days. A lush nectarine component comes off strongly. Not much malt character to speak of on the nose, which is A-OK with me. The alcohol spikes a little bit for me on the nose, which is unexpected given an ABV just under 7%. It's straight-forward but certainly good. Apart from the weird alcohol note, this is a textbook West Coast American IPA aroma profile.  The taste follows the nose. Plenty of acerbic pine bitterness. Some Five Alive action going on: a whole basket of oranges and tangerines and grapefruits. Just a gentle kiss of honey-sweet crystal malt. It's certainly a West Coast IPA; the malt seems there for the pine resin to play off of more than anything. Again, this IPA doesn't bring a lot of innovation to the table. But it executes classic flavors. Good stuff.  My favorite thing about a lot of West Coast IPAs is the thin bodies on them. I love love love love an IPA that is thin like hop water. It's indicative of less malt, sure, but the thinness works for me to accentuate the hop flavors. Stone IPA has the sort of thin mouthfeel that I love. It's not watery, just lean. The carbonation is nice and prickly. If anything, I have to knock it a half-point because it gets a little thick on the swallow.  Back in the early part of the 2000s, before I got into beer, I imagine that this was considered a top-tier IPA. It still should be. Stone has never distributed to where I live (though where I used to live, Kansas City, just started receiving Stone beers). Whenever I'd be in a city that has Stone, I'd always pass up the IPA in favor of bigger, rarer offerings. So this is my first Stone IPA. I wish I'd have had one sooner. It's a lovely example of the American IPA style. It'd be a mainstay of my fridge if I lived within Stone's distribution.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,minterro,4.3,"A: mid-range orange colored beer, with a yellow orb glowing forbearingly from the bottom. Rising from the yellow floor are chins of bubbles crawling to the surface. Eventually, these bubbles reach a fluffy white head that leaves an excellent display of lacing... like layers of rock on the side of a cliff.  S: STRONG STRONG piney hoppy aroma. The bitter crispness of this beer sends shivers down your spine and makes your skin goose bump. I can’t recall a more aromatic beer. It reeks... in a good way.  T: Upon the first gulp, it literally feels like your drinking a big ol' bit of a pine tree (it is that intense). Some where in the middle you can really feel the lemon/citrus tones kick in. The “harsh” taste the alcohol is felt in the after-taste. Finishes pleasantly dry, but not over the top.  M: Medium body, medium carbonation. It possesses creamy and tingly mouth-feel. This beer is quite easy/enjoyable to drink.  O: Even being a big fan of IPA and drinking them all the time, this beer blew my mind! I don’t know WHO told me that this was bad or maybe I dreamt it (the reason I waited so long to try it). But if I remember, I will never trust their beer taste again.

147,88,BarryMFBurton,4.17,"I'm gradually working my way through the ranks of Stone's offerings. So far, so good - to date, it's my favorite all-around brewery. Here we have something I've had in the past, before I started reviewing, and that I'm glad to be trying again: the classic IPA. Last time I had it, I was impressed. Let's see how it stands today:  A: The body is a deep honey gold, rich and shining. Its head is thin and white; it's pretty sticky, leaving lacing all around. What really stands out, though is the carbonation. Bubbles float consistently to the top of the body, but not like other pale ales I've had; this is a constant super-stream of rising fizz. I like it.  S: There's a big hop aroma; tons of orange and pine notes. It has a very fresh feel.  T: Very refreshing! Hops are superbly crisp, showing off minty, citrusy, and natural flavors. There's a great chewy wheat in there, making the earthiness even more distinct and complex. An unsurprisingly dry finish leaves you wanting more after each drink.  M: I love this aspect about Stone brews. There's enough carb to excite the palate, but not enough to make it prickly and less drinkable.  O: This is refreshing, flavorful, and satisfying - which is great for an IPA. And, with summer just starting, I have the feeling I'll be stocking these $5 bombers deep. Great bang for your buck!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lacqueredmouse,4.03,"I've actually had this once before—it was a grey import to Australia, however, so I thought it would be better to review it fresh, close to the source, as Greg Koch intended. This one was purchased from BevMo in Sunnyvale, CA. Let's see how it matches up.  Pours a hazed and bright pale golden-orange colour, with a full and frothy head of meringuey foam. Lacing is sudsy, but quite pleasant. Body is relatively heavy—weirder is the fact that there's very little carbonation noticeable when tilted, or when the beer is static. I'm interested to see how the mouthfeel relates.  Nose is crisp and pleasant, with very classic citrussy hop characters dominant. Sharp and fresh for the most part with a crushed lemon leaf type of pungency. In some respects, it's a little one-dimensional, but it's rather unapologetic about what it's doing, and you have to respect that.  Taste is crisp and light, with a nicely balanced, but not dominant hop character through the centre of the palate. Moderate feel gives off some mild light malt notes that meld with the citrus to give a honey-and-lemon melange. All over, nicely balanced—not overly complex, overly aggressive or assertive.  This is a good IPA, and a good benchmark against which to measure others. I'm pleased to say that I would have said similar things about either version I've had, whether in California, or grey-imported to places it wouldn't have been seen otherwise.  Yes, this is a good beer. And so was the one I had in Australia.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,EricCioe,4.09,"This pours a clear golden amber with a one finger frothy white head that dies down leaving some small rings of lace. On the nose there is a ton of citrus zest, huge grapefruit and lemongrass but also something a little different, almost like guava, mingling with light pine. In the mouth there is a big hop hit, very spicy and herbal, like freshly zested lemon. It's approaching but not quite puckering in the bitterness. There is a little bit of evidence of some caramelish malt backbone, but the hops are certainly the show for this beer. The body is medium or a bit fuller, with a long, bitter finish.  Overall, this a pretty great IPA, though not my favorite. There is no denying the quality of this brew, however, and it's a cornerstone of the style for a reason.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lacing clings to the glass as if it has been glued there.  S: Dank, sticky ""bud"" smell. Very fresh hop smells. Pine, zesty citrus. Tropical fruit esters too. Faint biscuity malt base.  T: Citrusy hop bitterness registers on the palate immediately. A bit of herbal spiciness. Lemon zest. Grainy and biscuity malt base comes through toward the finish. Bitter leafy hop tastes ride it out into the finish too. Dry, but not bone dry.  M: Medium bodied, creamy, and slick with hop oils.  O: Very good.  Notes. One of the first West Coast IPAs to which I was exposed. It still holds its own within the style, even in a saturated market. A classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,notchucknorris,3.57,"A: Medium amber color with a decent-sized white head.  S: Some pretty nice floral hops going on here. I'm not picking up much else, but the hops are nice.  T: I don't know about this one. I know a lot of people like it and it has great reviews, but it just doesn't do it for me. There's just nothing to this one. There are some decent hop flavors upfront, but then nothing else happens and it ends on a semi-bitter note and seems watered down throughout. It's not the worst IPA I've ever had, but it's just not that good for me. Stone missed the mark on this one. Ruination, on the other hand...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,LeeryLeprechaun,4.67,"Poured a golden orange color with a little white head. The floral and citrus fruit aroma was excellent. Notes of orange and grapefruit were mixed in with the floral aroma. The medium bodied beer with a subtle malt backbone gave way to a citrus hop taste that was neither overpowering or underpowered. At almost 7% there was a little warmth but the alcohol was not detectable. This beer was excellent, maybe my new favorite IPA over Pliney and Green Flash West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,atomicbeer,3.39,"Pours a slightly hazy bright gold. One finger creamy white head that provides some lacing. Nice carbonation: steady streams of tiny bubbles throughout. Aroma is piney hops with rosemary/floral on orange marmalade on crackers. Pine-grapefruit taste, no sweetness here. Bitterness dominates mouthfeel yet creamy. Lingering bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dbossman,4.18,"A: Golden bronze hue with a thick steady white head and nice lacing  S: An onslaught of hop aromas: with grapefruit and lemon rind taking control--also a pleasant floral bouquet; there are some bready malts underneath but this is a hop-heavy beer for sure  T: A citrus/ grapefruit bitterness takes control at first--these oily hops take most of the show--though a touch of slightly burnt, bready malt undertone eventually peaks through  F: This has all the oily, sticky residue you want in your west coast IPA; the carbonation is right on and the beer is actually pretty darn creamy in the end  D: This is a damn good, easy drinking IPA; such a nice example of a hop forward--without going crazy--IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A-Pours an undisturbed,transparent orangish-gold with a strong and stiff,cloudy white head that stood two fingers tall and exhibited a honeycomb of medium sized bubbles across it's surface before depositing thick,concentric rings of lace on the glass.  S-Undeniably West Coast.Bold,citric hop presence of Navel orange and grapefruit(more pith than flesh)but also a perfumey,floral note on the nose as well.Sugary,but not overly sweet,malts are well represented and balance the strong hop profile well.  T-Great oily bitterness but used with finesse and restraint.Bold flavors of candied grapefruit,pine,hop resin,wildflowers and caramelized grains all intermingle and work together.Very clean.Some faint spice on the finish was reminiscent of white pepper and lemongrass.  M-Slick and smooth.This beer coats the mouth with a medium body that shows a strong hop presence but also a nice use of carbonation and a dry finish.

147,88,HugePlume,4.82,"Poured from the tap at our SD hotel the first night in town.  A- Lighting wasn't ideal in the room, but it had a very nice rocky head, and excellent lacing. My wife had a sierra nevada pale, and I was actually surprised that the SN was a little darker and redder than the Stone IPA, which I felt was on the lighter end of the AIPA spectrum, nice lacing.  S- out of sight. massive hop aroma, dry hopping to the extereme! wonderful complex hop notes, from whole hop, with a little citrus mixed in,  T- again, fantastic. Smacks you right away with a full bore bitter hop assault. A nice sweet grain malt background gives way to a bitter hop finsh of unusual complexity.  M- Spot on here, a little resin left on the teeth and tongue, and good carbonation to pull away some of the bitterness, but not too much of it.  O- Great IPA, a pillar of hoppiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SMcGuire33,4.55,"My favorite IPA that I have had to date.  A- A yellowy orange beer that leaves behind a solid lacing.  S- Citrusy and tangy, (Grapefruit, lemon, orange) with a strong hop presence that looms large.  T- Best tasting IPA that I have tried. Starts out citrusy and almost piney, and leaves a bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while.  M- Great amount of carbonation. Light enough body that makes it a potential sessional beer.  Overall I think this is such a well-rounded IPA. It goes down very easily, and although it has a higher abv than the BMC's of the world, it can just as easily be a session beer. It has been my go to for months, and I am still not sick of it. Just can't wait to try all the rest that Stone Brewing Co. has to offer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kevanb,4.24,"Poured into an oversized wine glass from a 12 oz bottle from a fresh 6 pack.  A: Beautiful amber color, amazing texture with a thin lacy head. Just transparent enough, but still rich with color.  S: Amazing scent, hoppy, citrus and almost a bit peachy, really welcoming.  T: Great taste, nice and bitter, really nice hop flavor, with that hint of citrus in the background, nice hoppy finish.  M: Feels good, not great, a bit lacking, but it goes down really smooth. Not overly carbonated, but not flat.  O: Exceptional IPA, one of the best I've had that is a standard brew, not a special bottle type. Really beautiful colors, great aroma and a great taste.

147,88,hoppyhampy,4.39,"22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Best by date is 5/5/11. Pours a cloudy yellow orange with two fingers of frothy foam and moderate carbonation. Nice lacing. Nose is lovely. Elegantly hoppy and bitter. Nice, playfully fresh hops with just a slight hint of malt. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Lively carbonation. Palate is all hops dancing on the tongue. Not super resiny. Just resiny enough to give the finish a long and pleasing bitterness. The hop flavors are so light, they have a more floral quality than you find in most IPAs. This continues to be one of my favorite expressions of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,gonedrinking,4.38,"Pored a golden haze, one finger head, medium carbonation. Smell was not a powerful as I expected, citrus stood out. The pine and citrus hop flavors go well together. Had a dry ending and after two I could taste the resin on my lips. Overall a solid IPA, I can't believe I waited this long to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,smarcoly,4.21,"A - This IPA couldn't be more beautiful in my glass. Poured a deep, rich apricot color with a fingers worth of foamy head which dissapated slowly. Head is easily stirred up again and lingers in the glass. I like that.  S - To me, this beer does not have the abundant hops aroma you would think a Stone IPA may have. The aroma is slightly muted with a faint smell of wet grass and hop. Above average and inviting.  T - Hops are much more prevalant on the palate than on the nose. Initial taste is mostly bitter but there is a slight sweetness that disappears quickly. Bitter hops lightly coat your tongue on the finish. I dont taste a whole lot of complexity, just a well balanced IPA that isnt in your face.  M - This beer has just enough astringency to slightly pucker up the tongue. Not too watery and not as thick as a nice DIPA with sweet malt might be.  Overall, this one should be on standby in my fridge and is perfectly tasty on any given day. This is a great showing from Stone. I just wish there were more hops on the nose since your sense of smell is half the experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jggibbs,4.13,"Poured a clear, pale golden with a thin 1/2 finger white head.  Smells of mellow pine and hops. Slightly sweet, grassy too. Not an overpowering nose. Its quite nice.  Taste is of Pine, citrus and hops. A slightly sweet and there is a little bitter toward the end. Very balanced and enjoyable. Not too complex in flavor.  Feels light, smooth and almost too easy to drink.  I've been on quite the IPA kick the past few months and this was by far the easiest of the lot to drink. Its not as overpoweringly hoppy and piney as some of the others and they got the sweetness just right for my liking. Very enjoyable and will probably become a regular pick up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Flavor: Grapefruit hop flavor balanced by a touch of honey sweetness. Bitterness appears in the middle and remains well through the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and body.

147,88,biegaman,4.24,"It almost seems funny to say about a beer from sunny San Diego, but Stone IPA leaves my glass looking like the scene of a snowball fight. There's spatters of white crystals formed everywhere... except, ironically, on the top of the beer. That is largely barren. Perhaps its beaming golden radiance melted it all? It otherwise does look like a warm weather beer.  This is a bold, characterful brew with a big hoppy bite - this aroma is like the ‘beware of dog’ sign on the gate. Bitter but tropical resins radiate from the glass; pineapple, grapefruit, papaya and tangerine are experienced in high-def 3D vision and full on Dolby surround sound. It's hops on the big screen! And to think the show has yet to really even begin...  There's plenty of toasty, lightly biscuity, underlyingly sweet maltiness in there but for some reason with each sip I can't shake the image from my brain of a bunch of bare-footed San Diegans in a giant wooden vat stomping on a mound of hop cones. The fruity and floral and grassy (and brutally bitter) hop oils are overpowering in both quantity and quality.  Stone hardly keeps it a secret that they revel in their love for big, characterful brews and, likewise, their beers aren't exactly discreet either about their big, characterful dispositions. Every single one of the 77 IBUs registers on the palate; it's as if Stone rung out like you would a wet shirt every last drop of bitterness from each individual hop.  Stone claims their IPA is a good example of a style that (they define) as being ""highly hopped and high in alcohol"". More accurately, it's the benchmark of a style that Stone themselves pioneered and popularized: a hugely hoppy ale that is stingingly citric, brutally bitter, tremendously tropical, remarkably refreshing and candidly characterful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Homebrewer4ever,4.57,"A- Poured a slightly hazy dark straw with about a 2 finger small bubble head. Good lacing and great retention.  S- Citrus, pine resin, almost grapefruit like. Gets the mouth watering.  T- Nicely hopped (as to be expected from a Stone brew), citrus, and pine. Malty undertone.  M- Bitter and dry, bites you on the back of the tongue.  O- An excellent summer weather IPA. Quenches thirst and not extremely high on the ABV in terms of Stone's standards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mancer,4.3,"The bottle poured out a cloudy yellow body with a two finger high off-white head. The bubbles were quite lively and the head dissipated to a thick and sticky lace that lasted for the whole beer. The initial aroms were of citrus and pine hops. There was a malt sweetness with light fruits, and a distinct dryness. The initial flavors were of heavy amounts of resin and pine, citrus fruits, and finished with grains. The flavors were straight to the point and made it known that you were drinking a Stone. The brew was dry and bitter and had a medium body with medium carbonation.  Overall, this is a great beer from Stone. I think they made it really stick to the Stone name. Definitely find this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SHODriver,4.5,"A: pours a somewhat hazy golden orange hue with a little bit off white head which recedes to a small pool that sticks around for awhile S: A lot of citrus with this one, mostly some grapefruit, a hint of pine and just a dash of herbal spicyness. Slightly sweet from the malts but mostly as assault of hop essence. T: Grapefruit mostly with a bit of mintyness/menthol, some sweetness from the malt shines through as well. Lingering grapefruit aftertaste M: smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation. Not watery at all and not excessively thick. A bit drying initially after the swallow but quickly turns juicy.

However, IPA has been my favorite style for a while now. The latest one to retry was this one. Here goes. It looks good poured. Nice head. Smells strongly of pine. Tastes piney and citrusy in equal measures. This one went down quickly. Not a strong alcohol IPA, but pretty strong tasting. Bitter just the way I like it - not as much as Ruination, which is ok. Solid all the way around. I'm sure I'll enjoy the next 5.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

M - Light bodied and moderately carbonated. Smooth, watery, and slightly dry in the mouth. Goes down smooth and crisp with a small amount of bubbles. Finish is slightly dry with a clean aftertaste.

147,88,CHickman,4.68,"Pours a cloudy orange amber color with a massive foamy 2 finger head that faded very slowly, leaving great lacing sticking to the sides and a creamy layer on top; the lacing leaves great rings after each sip, and the beer is nice and murky.  Smells of huge hops, with floral hops, flowers, piney hops, citrus hops and just a barrage of oily hop sweetness up front; after another whiff, the other aroma’s come through like sweet malt, grains, caramel, grapefruit, orange peel, pepper and other spices, and perhaps maybe some brown sugar, but the hops really suppress everything and dominate the nose.  Tastes like it smells with huge hops up front including floral hops, flowers, piney hops, citrus hops, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple or apple (can’t decide), sweet malt, grains, caramel, wet wheat bread, grass, a touch of herbs like tea, pepper and other spices, light brown sugar, and then a nice tart bitterness that tingles on the tongue before fading slowly and leaving a nice sweet hop pucker. This is what an IPA is all about, and I have always thought that this beer is one of the best IPA’s that sets the standard. The alcohol is well hidden, and there’s just a little heat from the alcohol, hops and spices which balance nicely with the malts used. Nice tart fruit flavors add to just a great overall taste.  Mouthfeel is creamy, oily slick and quite smooth, with light carbonation, a medium body that’s chewy, and a nice bitter finish that leaves a fruity pucker with a hop bite.  This beer feels light and easy to drink, even though it has some kick to it, and is so drinkable it’s almost scary; this is a top notch beer which I have immensely enjoyed for years and one that I highly recommend. This is the epitome of an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SpeedwayJim,4.01,"12oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint. No freshness date.  A: Standard pour yields a 2 finger foamy and frothy off-white head with great retention. Beer is a clear light peach-orange. Lacing is stringy and patchy with good stick. A beautiful beer overall.  S: Nose is citrus, cane sugar, fresh cut grass, and a slight resiny hop bitterness. Very crisp, simple, and appropriate but only moderately aromatic.  T: Opens citrus and piney hop bitterness with a subtle cane sugar malt backbone. Grassiness creeps in a bit towards the middle as does some grapefruit and a subdued unripened pineapple tartness. Bark and more grass towards the end, finishing with a crisp, spicy hoppiness. Aftertaste is resin and sap. Almost perfect for its style but doesn't add anything extra that would make it memorable.  M: Light bodied and moderately carbonated. Smooth, watery, and slightly dry in the mouth. Goes down smooth and crisp with a small amount of bubbles. Finish is slightly dry with a clean aftertaste. Perfect and exactly what you'd expect from the style.  D: I can definitely see this as my go to IPA. Very well distributed. Incredible balance, great feel, and just a very drinkable beer overall. A definite staple for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nice and sticky. Body is a clear gorgeous orange amber with tiny sparse fast rising bubbles from the bottom.  Smell is a wonderful simple grapefruit and somewhat grass like hop. A little small, but very solid. A little bit of cinnamon too.  Taste is a good spiced hop profile, malt sugar body hints of brown sugar. Missing some bread action but a little on the finish, but I really like the hop feel of this IPA, it's strong but not overpowering. No hint of booze either, feels easy drinking.  Overall this is solid you just can't go wrong with it, it's also a personal fav for this style as well for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZenAgnostic,4.05,"Appearance - Orange amber hazy body with a large frothy white head with decent retention.  Smell - Strong grassy notes. Very hoppy, obviously. A bit of hidden maltiness though.  Taste - Slightly bitter lime peel finish and aftertaste. I consider it a slightly off flavor, but completely acceptable for the style. Can't always have your cake and eat it too.  Mouthfeel - Smooth with full body and creamy carbonation.  Overall Drinkability - Good kick in the taste buds when you're craving an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Creamy and foamy dirty white head That is making the beer look great. Not really lace but the whole head is sticking to the glass!  S- one of the most floral ipas I've smelled. Tons of stone pine that I pick up in alot of their brews. Also some grapefruit That is mixing with some toffee malts.  T- piney and sweet at the same time with lots of floral hints. There are malts That back up the hops very nicely. Just a classic ipa taste That I drink alot of.  M- medium bodied that has a creamy texture. Not heavy or burdersome but not light and weak, just right. Just a faint alcohol tingle on the swallow.  Overall a great beer. Nothing is out of balance and the hops are really sharp and piney.

Taste: Beautiful hops. hops come first, bitter in the middle and a sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly creamy, the carbonation is light but bites a tiny bit after a second.Very good.

Freshness date 4-10-11, i was a little worried about this, but figured, what the hell, i drink this beer enough to know if it tastes right.  A: Poured a pale amber color with small spider web like head. Sticky lacing.  S: Smells like bountiful floral and citrusy hops and malt. Has that hop smell that you want west coast IPAs to have.  T: Just as good as the smell, very smooth and balanced. It's amazing how much malt really comes through even though it's a bit of a hop bomb.  M/O: Excellent carbonation, crisp mouthfeel, goes down smooth. It's been a good amount of months since I've had stone IPA; it was the first beer to truly get me into craft beers, and I felt like I had moved on.

It has a sweet, citrusy, hoppy aroma.  Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  Bitter and Hoppy but with flavors of citrus coming through.  Intense flavors, but not for the timid. If you don't like bitter or hoppy beers this may not be for you.  I found Stone IPA extremely satisfying and most enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The Stone IPA pours a nice head that goes the distance. Aroma is just as it should be, very inviting, which foreshadows what is to come. Many IPA's start out sweet, then bring on the hop and bitter. The Stone has a nice blend of hop flavor and underlying sweetness from start to finish. Not much bitter to this brew. Very smooth, with a luscious mouthfeel. I give it high marks.

The palate's mild malty sweetness is very quickly bowled over by the resiny and very leafy hoppiness, while the nice bitterness provides the fuel for the long, dry and slightly mouthwatering finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A bit of ruby red grapefruit and wet her garden scents.  T: Hop smack upfront followed by pale malt, lots of aromatic citrus, again with the lemons and oranges and ruby red grapefruit. I get a lot of grassy character too. Huge astringent alcohol near the end before a bit more bitterness.  M: Slightly thinner than medium and quite fizzy.  O: To me this was a very lemony (but not too far) hoppy pale malt creation that works. Its bitter but balanced and not too acidic. I could drink many of these.

S - Piney aroma with a little sweetness in the background  T - still being an amateur, I tried this when it was a little too cold and got mostly a bitter hops bite with a malty backing character. As I made my way through, I let it sit and warm up and the fruit flavors come out. This has a pine hop bite up front even as it warms, but a orange/lemon flavor appears and finishes with a malt back.  M - A good beer, a little more body than other IPA's I have tried, and I like that.  O - As it warmed, the character of the beer comes out, I really enjoyed the Stone IPA, I wish there was a little more fruit flavor, but overall a very good IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dubinsky,3.97,"Poured from bottle into a tulip.  A - This beer pours a honey, light amber with exceptional clarity, that is until i accidentally dumped the yeast sediment into it. The head is super white and incredibly tight and foamy, almost chunky. I really enjoy this much head retention. It just seems to linger around, long enough for me to keep typing up this review. The head is also leaving behind some wonderful lacing, what little there is of it due to the amazing retention.  S - This is definitely a West Coast IPA. The aromas are mostly of Pine, resin and citrus. I'm also picking up on some sweet notes that i cant quite identify. Overall, its a very classic smelling west coast IPA.  T - I have had this before, numerous times and decided that it was time to review it. The previous times i had this beer, it didn't taste like this. In the past it was mostly bitter, with little mouth feel. This is completely the opposite. This must be a very fresh bottle. Its incredibly balanced. There is a great amount of hop bitterness, but its also complimented with a nice sweet maltiness. Its mostly piney, and grassy with a fair amount of citrus. The finish is also pretty incredible, leaving a nice film of light bitterness on the tongue.  M - Medium body, and medium to light carbonation. This is perfect for the style.  O - I really enjoyed this beer. I'm glad to know realize that its better than i thought it was earlier.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thatlongname,4.55,"Appearance: Great golden brew with lots of carbonation bubbles. Thick off white head that sticks.  Smell: Great hop smell, maybe a little bit of lemon zest or some sort of citrus in there.  Taste: Absolutely delicious. Great complex hop flavors. Right amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth. Especially nice when the foam hits your mouth. All part of the experience.  Overall: A damn good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,devinoconnor,4.95,"Stone is always a pretty safe bet, so I was extremely excited to try their classic India Pale Ale.  Pours a golden citrus color. Smells of hop and bitters, a little citrus in there as well.  Taste is a wonderfully balanced pairing of hops and bitters. Although Stone claims its filled with hops, I didn't find it to be overly hoppy like so many other IPA attempts.  Goes down very smooth and it's a very easy drinking beer as far as IPA's go. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rummy666,3.8,"A: Good color, golden color with a nice head.  S: Nice aroma, with a gentle hoppy smell.  T: Slightly more bitter, was expecting more of a floral hop taste, however, this bitterness is not that bad.  M: Decent mouthfeel with a hint of alcohol.  O: A good brew, however, I'm not as impressed as I thought I was going to be. Could taste a little more alcohol than I was expecting. As I drink a lot of IPAs from around the country, I was expecting this to have a more floral taste, however, the bitter hoppy flavor is still quite pleasant.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tubacharlie,4.35,"A modest white head appears on pouring into a glass mug. Although there is limited carbonation activity while still, after a sip it rushes up to reline the top with a fresh blanket of foam. The honey yellow color of the brew has a very light haze.  The hops aroma presents itself readily, with some citrus overtones. As it hits the mouth, slightly sweet grapefruit flavors are followed a mellow grain presence softened by smooth carbonation and trailed by a bittersweet lingering hop bite.  Very good example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,metter98,4.22,"A: The beer is yellowish amber in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high dense off white head that quickly died down but consistently left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface. S: There are light to moderate aromas of floral and grapefruit hops in the nose. T: Like the smell, grapefruit flavors from the hops stand out in the taste, but these are very well balanced by the underlying malts, which have some notes of caramel. There is a moderate amount of bitterness. M: It feels a tad below medium-bodied on the palate and is smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. The finish has a little bit of dryness. O: The beer is extremely drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste and the hops do not overpower your palate. I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,harrymel,3.75,"Bb: 5/18/11  A: Pours a honey ale with exceptional clarity with a two finger head of off-white blossoming head which dissipates slowly to leave a thick sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.  S: Pine, resin, mostly dominate the nose here. some medium grain and caramel tones. Lightest hints of mint and cotton candy. Decent.  T: Balanced. Super balanced. I don't believe this beer is super fresh, but the hops have died out a bit the beer is dominated by a healthy malt backbone and early hopping bitterness. Nearly good, but now, above average.  M: Medium body, and medium to light carb. Good feel. Leaves mouth with little reminder that it was just there.  O: Very drinkable. I wouldn't call this beer great, but I could likely drink all night, and that's a sign of a quality flagship beer, as this is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Rutager,4.46,"Appearance. Pours a slightly hazy, yellow gold with a finger of bubbly white head.  Smell. Nice strong floral hops. Some pine and sweet citrus. A little caramel malt. Really nice.  Taste. Yellow grapefruit rind, floral hops, pine and light toasty grain with just enough solid caramel malt lurking in the shadows of the hops. Yum!!  Mouthfeel. Medium body with medium-high carbonation. Little alcohol presence which is nice for the abv.  Drinkability. I could blaze through a few of these without any effort. Good stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerLover99,4.9,"A: deep orange, cloudy body, 1 finger head, slight patchy lacing  S: pine, citrus aroma, clean scent  T: slight sweet citrus up front, firm earth pine middle, slow long bitter finish  M: medium body, slight sticky feel  D: Nice earthy IPA, fine Stone offering, but not my favorite. This is a perfect beer for me; can be sessionable and also sipper.  DELICIOUS, SEEK IT OUT!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FoamyMustache,4.26,"A - Poured a ""thick"" amber color with the most glorious, lumpy, angel cloud 3 finger head I've seen.  S - Wonderfully aromatic hops with a touch of spice. Sweet fruity notes fill in all the voids.  T - Big bold hops with some definite herbal qualities hit the palette first. Fresh pineapple and citrus notes in the middle with an interesting finish of yeast and grain. Hops stay with the beer throughout the taste and on the finish.  M - A nice balance malt blend adds a creamy, smooth, somewhat oily feel that is wonderful.  D - There is no doubt that this is a hoppy beer so it might not be for everybody, but it is crafted so well that the balance makes it entirely drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MichaelLynBryant,4.03,"Pops open and pours beautifully to a 2-inch mountainous white head atop a pale amber, almost orange from a slight haze.  Carbonation perfect--lacing is thick and white--and appetizing.  The front of your tongue is sizzled by hops.  The nose has a hint of malt sweetness as well as some hops, but not very big. On draft, this beer's nose is much bigger.  Great mouthfeel from the carbonation, lacing your tongue with hops. Furthe sizzle.  Dryness is similar to that of a good cabernet, residual and demolishing.  The most British of the west-coast IPAs. A delicious IPA from the king of hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Chriscrundwell12,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter  A- Hazy, golden body, one finger head, moderate lacing. S- Malts, sweet aroma, hints of grape fruit and citrus, hints of caramel T- Fresh hops, malts, slightly bitter but well balanced, very similar to the aroma. M- Medium body, very smooth, easy to drink. D- Very drinkable, a solid IPA from the west coast. Nice and balanced with all the ingredients. Perfect for a nice hot summer day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Glibber,4.2,"Nice looking pour with a healthy 2 finger head. Froth settled down, but left quite a bit of lacing. Light yellow amber color with some decent carbination to make the beer refreshing. Has the grapfruit citrus taste up front that I really enjoy. Has a decent hop kick, but not so bitter that you couldn't drink more than a few of these without getting too full. In fact the back end of the taste, it is actually very smooth- the more I drink it the better it tastes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jesse13713,3.86,"Thanks to my brother for sharing this with me!  Appearance - A very opaque golden straw yellow. Cloudy and appears to be well carbonated. A nice sunset orange.  Smell - Smells quite hoppy. Slight malts and grass notes.  Taste - A complexity of floral notes swims with delicious abd fresh hops. Quite a solid IPA. Caramel notes and slightly sweet on the finish.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Quite smooth with a bit of orange zest. Very crisp, drinkable and refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beerman207,4.43,"Saw this on tap at a bar called ""The Pub"" near my house so had to finally sample this beer.  A: Wow - Can see through it, the orange hue is fabulous and the skim head left leaves great lacing on the glass  S: Pine hops, very floral, and great citrus tones  T: Hops galore, bitter up front, malt in the backbone to chill it out. Very well done  M: Not overly carbonated - just about right for a an IPA  D: All night long - just fabulous!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Wattsox,4,"750ml bottle, consumed Feb 2011.  A - Golden orange body with a head that dissipates quite quickly, leaving a good amount of lacing that clings to the glass.  S - Hops lead on the aromas with some pine and citrus notes.  T - As with the aromas, the hops definitely lead the taste, bringing some pine and citrus notes and punchy bitterness.  M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and clean.  D - Very drinkable, though starting to get a little high on the ABV for too many in one session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jinholic,4.6,Another IPA this time by Stone. Pouring this into my pint glass right now.  Appearance - Clear pale orange 3 fingers of head with some thin lacing.  Smell - Sweet citrus and hops.  Taste - Almost everything I smelt sweet citrus with hops at the end a bit dry on the finish.  Mouthfeel - Clean and smooth can't even tell this is 6.9%.  Drinkability - I'm not even done with it and want another. Just an awesome west coast IPA can't wait to try something else from Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mattkoon,3.96,I have really started to love the complexities of IPAs. The ipa from the stone brewing company is a great one. The piney citrus comes on strong as soon as this champion hits your tongue. The bitter finish packs quite a punch. This beer is deffinatly not for the drinkers of that sissy lite swill that little lady-like fellas love. I would expect any less from the makers of arrogant bastard!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Shrews629,4.47,"Appearance - This brew poured a very attractive orange color. It was cloudy with a somewhat average sized white head. Not a whole heap of retention and it left some lacing clinging to the sides of the glass.  Smell - A nice floral and perfumy aroma. I smell the grapefruit, some orange. both citrusy and fruity. Some piney notes along with some mild malt. Smells very nice and balanced. I started to get a dry bread smell as it warmed a bit.  Taste - A prominent amount of bitterness at first with the taste. Medium to high hop flavor. Grapefruit citrus is really nice and not over the top. A touch piney. Again, very well balanced and even. A slight resinous flavor as the beer went down.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. Wonderfully dry and snappy crisp. Really blankets the palate and the taste hangs on for a great long while. Nice!!! Goes down way too easy.  Drinkability - Everytime I have a Stone beer I'm impressed. This brew is no different. Very solid all the way around. Perfect for the Spring and Summer day. Most definitely worth a try.

147,88,JesteR14,4.25,"A- Nice golden color, small bubbles coming from the bottom of my tumbler. Nice creamy head that lasts a good while. Soapy bubbles in the head for sure. light body and slightly hazy. Very nice to look at.  S- Very hoppy, with some floral citrus smells.  T- Very nice fresh hops, come on strong but its not overwhelming. Lightens up in the taste and something that surprised me. Very fresh tasting and the after taste brings out this nice citrus flavor which i enjoy. Someone who enjoys hops like myself would love this beer.  M- Dry and low carbonation.  D- Pretty high, nice easy drinking IPA with great balance of flavors.  Yum!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Classic IPA. Short sweetness followed by lots of citrus overtones, buttery, great bitter finish.  M. Medium bodied, light carbonation slightly dry finnish.  D. I really like this IPA I get it everytime I can find it Thank You Stone",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DannyDan,4.53,"This IPA pours a nice clear golden color with excellent retention, some of the best lacing I have seen on a beer and good carbonation too. The smell is of herbal hops, some pine, a little bit of citrus and pineapple. The aroma makes me look forward to the taste. The taste is strong herbal hops followed by some grassy earthy taste than some pineapple and citrus in the middle and staying until the end and finishes off with more herbal hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy and very enjoyable to drink since it is so good that it just goes down nicely. This a a must try IPA, great beer highly recommend it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dirtyskunk,4.25,"Poured from a bottle to a standard American sized pint glass.  A: Bright gold with a sizable off-white head. Great retention on the head.  S: Very bright and tropical fruit hoppiness with a lot of myrcene influence. Good but not exceptional  T: Fairly sweet and fruity hop flavors. Citrus and apricots. Once again, lots of of myrcene. It finishes with a very smooth and refreshing maltiness.  M: Wonderful, the mouthfeel is silky and almost creamy. This would be amazing in a nitro serving.  D: Great overall drinkability. I only mark down slightly because of my personal taste. I have a hard time drinking more than a couple of any IPA or similarly hoppy beer. This is probably an exception to the rule though because of the smooth finish and buttery mouthfeel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dalimsta,3.38,"- Pretty typical appearance and texture for an IPA.  - Aroma is interesting--a bit of citrus and pine with something else I just couldn't place. Not bad, but it didn't draw me in.  - I definitely agree with some other reviewers about the grapefruit bitterness up front. It's a bit overpowering, especially when taking a lot in at a time--it really does taste like unsweetened grapefruit juice with some pine at the end. After the bitterness cleared up, though, I got a really nice malty breadiness. I just wish it had come sooner, since the overwhelming hops presence isn't all that pleasant.  - Drinkable, but go slowly. Taking in too much at once bombards the palate with astringent hops.  Some might like the bitterness (and Stone writes clearly on the bottle that they loaded their IPA with hops), but it just isn't for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rpardon7,4,"Poured from the bottle and amber hued clean orang with a carbonated thin white head that receded and gave some good lacing to the glass. Smell is of centinial and magnum hops with a tiny hint of some caramel malt, but let's be honest this beer is about the hops. Taste is pine citrus and lemon with a smooth backing of caramel malt with a biting hop finish. Mouthfeel is balanced and simple not too heavy but not efforvescent. Drinkability is easy as this is a classic american india pale ale. Give me another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Scotchboy,3.95,"Pours a golden honey and has decent carbonation, very little haze, and some off-white head that sticks to the glass a little. Looks refreshing.  Hops and hops on the nose, but not overwhelming and very much in line with what I like in an IPA. There is citrus, some astringency, some piney-ness and a little sweetness. The malts are there at the very back.  This beer is more about the bitterness than the sweetness, but both are present. Citrus, grapefruit bitterness, pine, hop oil, the malts are bready and sweet but definitely in the back seat. A little warmth brought the orange/juicy tangerine to the forefront. A touch syrupy...about the perfect amount for me, not cloying or over-sweet.  I'm suprised that people rave about the mouthfeel, to me it wasn't more or less impressive than most of the regular IPA's I've had.  I deemed the drinkability to be fairly good.  Good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,irishmadness,4,"S - I just bought a set of snifters. So This was the first beer I drank it out of. A - The appearance is golden and almost orange looking. S - I smell Glorious hops and Citrus.

D - A good beer that is worth trying.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OldIronLungs,3.97,"Right into a pint comes a nice fluffy foam of bright white head slowly popping with invitation. Golden straw color smells of pine and citrus or floral herb. A gulp deals a nice creamy hop burst - I want to say Amarillo, but I'm not that good yet. More sweet of a finish after that nice balanced bitterness to start. The 6.9% is present but that balance makes for a fine drinker.  A nice IPA at a solid price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,therica,3.97,"I sat here sipping this after I opened it and realized, I could save a helluva lot of money if I just bought unsweetened unsalted white grapefruit juice.  A= nice amber-gold, fair head with nice lacing and pooling.  S= nice hops florals, sweet malts and what I call fresh linen laundry-starch which apparently refers to one of the malts.  T= grapefruit and more grapefruit rind. Ultra bitter. Great if one's goal in an IPA is pure IBU. But for me it's lacking character. Modest sweet malts buried in there. Still, I'll give it 4.0 for Stone apparently meeting its goal.  M= post grapefruit-rind with some mild but nice malts on the tongue along with the linen-bleach malts effect.  D= for someone in an entirely IPA-max mode this is probably great stuff. For the more casual IPA lover like me who is still a total Stone fan, but who prefers a little balance and flavor, it's got limited tolerability. Plus, there are no ratings for ""Stomach"" and mine is complaining about acid-overload at the moment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chilly460,3.77,"A - This one pours a nice amber color. Finger of off-white head that sticks around a bit, provides a fluffy white cap. Decent lacing.  S - Great pine smelling IPA. Mix of subtle grapefruit mixed with clean smelling pine, nice pungent IPA scent.  T - Pine up front with some lemon and orange peel, but definitely makes you remember the rugged pine punch. Balanced with some biscuity malts but overall pretty mild. This was one of the first IPAs I tried and it was definitely enough hops to feel like I was drinking a ""real"" west coast IPA, but still not over the top.  M - Good balance as expected, medium body and carbonation.  D - Still a good beer, big pine hops checking in.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T/M - nice, smooth mouthfeel right up front, almost creamy. citrus and malts smooth the bitterness out so doesn't hit you right in the beginning, it's more of one long climaxing note where the strongest of the bitterness is in the finish. really fresh and refreshing. light to medium bodied. mild carbonation.  D - reasonably drinkable for almost 7% ABV. IPAs are not my favorite style, but I liked this a lot. I'd say that it's my favorite IPA that I've tried so far.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HopHead84,4.03,"2/24/2011  On tap at Stone. Forcefully paired with the plaintive wail of a female Irish folk singer.  A: Transparent yellow gold with a big creamy two finger white head. The head is long lasting and leaves a lot of lacing when it recedes.  S: Redolent of grapefruit flesh and rind, and orange pith. Grassy and herbal notes are detectable. Malt provides light cracker notes. It's all hops, though more subtle and restrained than your average San Diego India Pale Ale. Light pine resin notes are revealed after the beer warms to an adequate temperature. This gets much better after it warms up a bit. It was very cold.  T: Grassy, with notes of orange, pine, and grapefruit. Malt is faint and crackery. Bitterness is at a moderate level. There's a bit of grapefruit rind in the dry finish.  M: Upper light in body with upper moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is dry, crisp, and sticky.  Overall: Strangely enough, I rarely drink Stone beer when I'm at Stone. This is the sort of beer that's always there and is often overshadowed by flashier offerings. However, this is definitely a good IPA, and sadly one that I probably won't drink again for some time. Still, tasty stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,treehugginslug,4.21,"A - Good  S - Wow! Now this was a fantastic smell. Smells just like when you add hops to the brewing process, possibly Cascade hops involved. Very nice. My wife even liked the IPA smell, which she normally does not like.  T - Now, the taste was not as good as the smell, but initially, my beer was nice and cold and tasted pretty good. As it warmed up, it got a little more bitter.  M - For an IPA, I could drink a few more.  D - Like I said, for an IPA, much more drinkable.  Would I buy it again?

The hops are quite bitter, yet not offensive. The sweetness really sets this apart from your standard hop bomb IPA's, and makes it quite delicious.  M - Medium bodied ale that possesses a slight prickliness going down, yet finishes with the perfect amount of dryness.  D - A very tasty IPA, loads of hops with a nice bitterness that makes it easily drinkable.

147,88,yisseroff,4.15,"Pours a honey-orange into my trusty Woodstock pint glass. Head? MIA for the most part. Visible carbonation for the first minute or so, but it went away with the head. Overwhelming pine/citrus combo on the nose. What I'd expect from an IPA, but nothing too groundbreaking. Maybe a hint of grapefruit there. This was a well-hopped beer, but the bitterness was not overwhelming. Really fresh citrusy fruits in drinking this beer- like taping a sip and then biting right into a fresh citrus fruit.

Grapefruit and lemon and orange rind in the nose. What I smell is blissfully hoppy, but I remember it having a stronger and more pungent aroma in earlier tastings.  An exceptional spectrum of flavors including: initial bitterness, hoppy citrus, and then a bready and biscuity flavor near the end.  Smooth yet full and rich mouthfeel. This beer invites you to drink more of it.  Very close to a perfect IPA. I feel lucky to live a ""Stone""'s throw away from the brewery.  I've had incredible success transitioning BMC drinkers to craft with this beer.

147,88,airheadmtrcycle,4.58,"My 100th review on BA! I wanted to make it something special. I purchased Stone IPA and Ruination at Smyrna World of Beverage. Their ""beer geek"", Jake, suggested both. Thanks pal! I chose the IPA. I've never had either that I remember. I generally avoid Stone due to the strange descriptions on their bottles.  Pours a beautiful slightly opaque orange (my wife says it's more caramel or golden) into a Duvel tulip glass. The head is two fingers of fluffy white head that leaves thick, sticky lacing behind. It makes me think I should downgrade the other 5's I've given for appearance.  The aroma is strong of pine and citrus hops: lemon peel, orange and tangerine. The citrus is sweeter, rather than bitter like grapefruit. However, once I take a sip, I do get some grapefruit balanced with sweet malts and then a semi-bitter finish. Stone IPA is really a delicious and balanced IPA. My impression of Stone beers is that they want you to think everything they brew is over-the-top and extreme, but the only thing extreme about this one is it is extremely delicious and refreshing. It's more balanced and should have more mass appeal than their propaganda suggests, which I'll disregard from now on.  The more I progress through this bomber the more bitter hop character I get. Still it never seems out of balance; there's always some sweetness and body there as well. The mouth feel is medium with just enough carbonation to keep it refreshing. The 7.7 abv is completely undetectable in the taste, but left me with a little buzz that sneaked up on me.  Stone IPA made for a perfect early evening on this unseasonably nice mid-February day. It went well with a Nicaraguan puro cigar, an aged Don Pepin Garcia Cuban Classic robusto. This IPA is as good as any of my favorites and will surely be a regular in my fridge from this day forward.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mjrod2142,4.5,"22oz. poured into a Perfect Pint glass  The beer pours an orange-amber color with a thick white head that stood very firm. It has a bright citrus aroma that's distinctly orange and fresh-cut grass.  The bitterness doesn't bite like I expected it too, but rather the flavor mellows out to a buttery finish. To me, this is a unique tasting IPA, but extremely enjoyable. I'm not sure what to make of the buttery flavor I'm picking up, but it's very interesting.  Very drinkable and highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mikeg67,4.1,"12 oz bottle. Pours golden hue with a white, foamy, long lasting white head. Aroma is of citrusy, grassy, herbal hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Medium, tangy body.

147,88,r0nyn,4.03,"Poured from a bomber into my Stone pint glass (what else?). Best by 4/10/11.  Pours a light mandarin orange hue, with a half inch white head that dissipates gradually. Leaves a ton of lacing coating the inside of the glass. Gobs of soapy bubbles just hang there, lazy as you please. It's pretty transparent, with good clarity. Smell has the characteristic hop bouquet of good IPAs, along with some subdued notes of pine. There's also a definite malt undertone that has nuances of citrus and other fruits. Interesting and quite welcome.  Initial sip yields a sweet, malty presence with lots of fruitiness. Slight hints of caramel accentuate the bittersweet grapefruit that appears to complement the malted beginning. Hoppy bitterness comes along next, with plenty of pine to go around too. It coats the tongue and rides into the aftertaste, which lingers for a good minute before disappearing. Quite a nice balance between the two contrasting tastes Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a crisp texture. Slightly drying finish, with a bit of a bite as well.  Drinkability is actually pretty good. Not really a hophead, but I'm trying to expand my palate and beers like this give me hope that some IPAs might just be for me. Really a very nice beer to sip and savor through the course of an evening. Cheers to Stone Brewing for another quality brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Very nice.  T - Quite a bit of fruit in the front. Good amount of piney hops, fairly well balanced, but perhaps a little too fruity.  M - A good balance in the mouthfeel. A decent amount of carbonation.  D - Very drinkable. This beer doesn't overwhelm at all. Carries the ABV very well  Overall, just a solid IPA.

147,88,aasher,3.32,"This is the final beer of my Stone ""kick"". This beer pours a thin burnt gold with a one finger white head. The aromas are of bitter pine. It's nothing I haven't seen before. The flavors are of pine and grapefruit, yet both bitter and sweet. The malt kind of becomes rather prevalent after a few sips and gives it a moderate amount of sweetness. This beer drinks between light and medium with a very, very dry finish. I hate dry finishes. I'm not a fan of induced cotton mouth and this beer brings it. It's unfair to this one that I compare it to Ruination and their 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA but this one doesn't hold a candle to either. The cotton mouth is a little much and it isn't as complex as their other aforementioned IPAs. This beer is pretty average in my opinion, as far as IPAs go.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,dali27,4.12,"Served on-tap into pint glass.  A: A nice rich amber color. Beautiful haziness, I love the way an unfiltered beer looks. Thick head that stays around through whole glass.  S: Strong, pungent hops aroma which I can smell without getting anywhere near the glass. I almost feel like the fresh hops are sitting in front of me. Really strong and amazing.  T: The taste is so incredibly hoppy that it is overwhelming to me. That being said, I cannot fault what is obviously an outstanding beer, because of my naive pallette. The taste is very complex to me even with nothing but hops coming through. Very bitter in the way that you want it to be.  M: This beer feels nice in the mouth. Medium to full body with moderate carbonation.  D: I can see how this can be easily drinkable for someone who wants this much hops in their beer. It definitely wasn't hard to put this one back. For me personally, it's not very drinkable because I think that it might be too much for me at this time. Again, I will not subtract from the quality because of my personal taste.  I am really happy to have been able to try what is so widely regarded as one of he best ipa's out there.

Beautiful beer.  S - Smell is all hops. Citrusy, grapefruity. Great stuff. Very west coast.  T - Starts off nice and balanced. When you attempt to swallow, your tongue is bashed with hop bitterness. Nice crisp finish with a slight grapefruit aftertaste. More balanced than Ruination. Very good.  M - Mouthfeel is right on for the style. Medium with good carbonation.

Has a small, frothy head that dissipates slowly and leaves considerable lacing.  Smell: Powerful, citrusy hop aromas dominate here. This is definitely a West Coast IPA...  Taste: This is some intense hoppy flavor... Strong citrusy, piney, and herbal hops dominate the entirety of this beer. There is a slight sweetness to it as well but it's mostly lost in the hoppiness. This is a true American IPA.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a nice bite to it. Fairly refreshing for an IPA.  Drinkability: A truly excellent IPA. While its intense hoppiness makes it a bit of a sipping beer, it is still a pleasure to drink. Anyone who has tried Stone's other offering should, to some degree, know what to expect from this beer.

Nice lacing along the glass as well.  S - Strong pine aroma greets the nose up front. Some floral notes in there as well with a tinge of malt.  T - Both citrus and pine hops up front with a nice malt background. A bit of biscuit character in there too, a nice and balanced IPA.  M - Medium bodied, smooth throughout with a dry finish.

Appearance: Great dark golden colored body, nice amount of translucency. The head dissipates quickly, but there is great lacing. A very ""typical"" American IPA.  Smell: Great hop profile on the nose (after all, it is Stone). Lots of citrus and some fruity esters but a prevalent bitterness regardless. Little malty balance, but definitely hop forward.  Taste: Great balance of hops here, along with the sweet malt body; makes for a very well balanced IPA. , Relatively dry finish, but not oppressive, simply a pleasant IPA. I get some yeasty notes towards the end of the taste, but pretty minor (tap line issue possibly?).  Mouthfeel: Smooth, semi-dry, and not thick in the slightest.

S: Dominant notes of grapefruit and citrus scented hops with just a touch of sweet grainy malt underneath. T: Grapefruit dominates again but the taste is sweeter than the nose suggested, almost honey or agave like, with a touch of fruit nectar thrown in as well. Finish is full of sweet malt and the aftertaste has a really good bitter punch. M: Viscous mouthfeel over a medium-thick body and low carbonation. D: A very drinkable IPA full of fresh hop flavor.

The bitterness of the hops does leave almost a dry feeling in you mouth when you're done. D - I felt that the piney hops were almost over the top.

147,88,Phelps,3.75,"Enjoyed from the bottle at Casey Moore's. Poured into a shaker pint.  Deep orange-gold, like apple juice, with perfect clarity. A sticky one-finger head of pure white recedes to a filmy top layer that leaves jagged walls of lace as it dissipates.  Citrusy yet not bitter grapefruit in the nose, along with lime, pale cracker malt and a tiny bit of honey. Nice balance.  There's the piney bite. Lime, orange peel, caramel, crackers, grass. Not bad, and the bitterness isn't over the top.  High, painful carbonation assaults the tongue and fizzes up the beer a bit. Medium-light body, crisp finish. Smooth yet light.  A decent IPA. Nothing too outstanding, but it seems Stone reserves its crazy side for beers like Ruination and Arrogant Bastard. It's actually refreshing to see some semblance of balance from them in this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It has a clean and dry mouth feel at the same time.

It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite an excellent IPA. This one had a good balanced flavor to it.

Decent lacing, OK head retention.  S - Good. Grapefruit and lemons dominate, followed by some grassiness moreso than Pine. Smells dry / Bitter.  T - I read in another review this beer is bitter just enough before I'd state it's harsh, which I agree with. Grapefruit and lemons are there but not as much as the nose would suggest. I got as much biscuit and bready - grainy flavors as I did Grapefruit citrus which was a turnoff. Bitter hops, and a very dry but crisp finish. I feel the Grapefruit - Lemon citrus in this beer is muted. Too much Grain and Bread flavor along with the hops. Best by 3/21. Maybe this is an off batch.  M - Dry, bitter but keeps me looking to take another sip to see what else I can find in this beer. Good but not great. Not a very smooth IPA.  D - See Mouthfeel.

147,88,Boitnott,4.5,"Poured from the 22oz bottle into a Chimay Goblet, really missing my DFH snifter...  Anyway it pours a pale orange color with a small head, which stays present the whole time. The lacing is excellent. The floral hops come through in the smell, along with a slightly rich sweetness that mixes well to create an amazing olfactory sensation.  The nose of the flavor is of sweet citrus and not much hop presence at first. Tastes similar to orange and maybe a slight bit of lemon. A lingering in the mouth brings out a bit of hops that continue onto the finish, in which they truly dominate. The sweetness is still present in the finish, but more like the bitter aspect of an orange, and less of the sweetness. The hops take over here and last for minutes after the beer goes down. This only serves to further entice the next sip, and the next sip, and so on....  Nice carbonation and the lighter body would make multiples of these enjoyable. I would highly recommend getting a few of these because they would only get better with more of them. I think this would be great anytime of the year. Is Stone capable of producing bad beer? I think not.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lace seems really sticky, individual bubbles are floating towards to the and it doesn't seem super carbonated.   Piney, and fruity. I can't decide which one is more present, because I am picking up both of them so well. Some earthy notes as well.   Starts off really piney and grassy with a really good dryness. That taste develops into a really nice malty/bready backbone, which finishes off into a really strong hop oil feel that leaves a really nice lingering aftertaste.   Like all of the Stone offerings I have had, there is alot of flavor in this beer and it's pretty balanced, mouthfeel is no different. Really balanced, mild IPA mouth feel.

A well retained white head leaves ring upon ring of lacing around the glass while drinking.  A swift kick in the pants with citrus fruit, orange, grapefruit, and a fainter hint of the malty base. Hop bitterness is strong and in the forefront.  Plenty of bitter, biting hops crash onto the palate with a splash of juicy citrus. The fruit flavors add to the hops, elevating the beer beyond simpler, one note tongue bashing IPAs. Slight sweetness with blood orange and apricot coupled with continuing bitterness. Lighter malt backbone as well as a very light touch of biscuit breadyness. Finishes long, bitter, and slightly dry.  Medium bodied, medium carbonation, sticky and bitter but not overpowering.

However, only good IPAs are bold but balanced, this hits that perfectly. Enough malty sweetness at first then a great hop combination.

There's a brief dead zone in the aroma department before the spiciness returns accompanied by an orangy liquor nose. Foamy fluffy white head. To the eyes there is beautiful slightly yellow golden glow.  Very hop forward with long firm bitter development through the middle palate and to the end with a long and strong finish. Supportive body, not heavy, but balanced and porportional. Reminds me of a more refined leaner and fuller Punk IPA. Pretty certain this was BrewDog's inspiration.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Star80,3.94,"Best before 2/06/11, was in the refrigerator case at my liquor store. Really nice lacing on the glass too. Smell is of some tropical fruits, citrus and some herbal grassy notes, and some odd glue/acetate odors in the alcohol. Hmm, not what I would normally expect from an American IPA. Fortunately, the taste comes through nicely without the strange off flavors I got from the smell, not sure if that is a by product of the yeast or what. Anyway, the taste is nice and hoppy, big resinous pine and grapefruit, and some sweet malt in there to balance things, a little. The mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, and full bodied. Wow, I am getting a real nice long bitter aftertaste, most be a lot of resins in those hops, whole leaf?? Overall, once I can get past the weirdness in the nose, believe it or not this is a great beer. So far I like their IPA best, the bigger ones get a little too rich, sweet and malty. I just noticed I drank half a glass of this pretty darn quick! I think I will get another six pack of this again soon, and see if I still get the ""glue"" smells.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Bitter overpowers sweet.  Taste has a bite. Nice bitter hops. Pine and grassy mainly. Slight hint of pineapple. Little bit of butter/toast malt to back up the hops.  Leaves a bitter, dry, hoppy aftertaste. This is a good smacky, sticky ipa.  When I imagine a standard ipa, this is what I think of. It isn't a tropical fruity, sweet ipa, and it isn't a high hop, high malt backbone ipa. Nothing overpowers and it's hop dominated. Bitter and crisp.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Ample carbonation and some lacing. The nose is piney with hints of tropical fruits...green apples, hops, malt. The alcohol is very well masked. As for the taste, fresh hops are the first thing I notice followed by subtle malt. The mouth feel is light approaching medium in body. One of my favorite IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,engagechad,4.64,"I bought this single bottle from World Market in Shortpump/Richmond, VA - poured into a DFH snifter.  There was a lot of hype leading up to my first real Stone brew tasting. The hype was backed up.  I poured this beer into the snifter and it poured a slightly hazy ambery gold just screaming at me ""i'm so hoppy you can't clear me up!"" The head was great and the lacing was sticky on the way down.  SHAZAM HOPS! Man.. One of the best beers I've had on the nose, all hops and some earth in there. Mostly pine in this aroma and boy was there a lot of it. Every time I agitated the brew it seemed to open up even more  This brew is amazing and totally lives up to the hype. It tasted so deceivingly smooth and easy for a 7% beer. Bitter but smooth, Spicy but not overwhelming. THIS is what I look for when I grab an IPA.  I want to have 10,000 of these.  I've been gaining steam with my experience into american craft breweries, buying singles all over the place trying to expand my repertoire as much as possible. THIS beer makes me want to settle down and buy a six pack, and that says a lot",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PeprSprYoFace,4.16,Been drinkin this beer since I started likin iPA's a few years back. never reviewed it.  Pours a nice straw/yellow color with a nice hoppy sticky head. Great lacing.  Aroma of citrusy hops and slight maltiness. Could use a little more aroma.  Tastes great. Like a simple IPA should. Nice hop bitterness with a good malt backbone. Citric hops come forward.  Mouthfeel is great. Great carb and nice and dry.  Overall this is how a standard IPA should taste. Grey beer that I buy often. If you can try the double dryhopped version. Even better,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JoeBloe,4.32,"my good wife just blindly picked this up for me from the supermarket - 22oz bottle into my favorite 'ephemere' tulip - pours a slightly hazy golden tangerine with a tight/bright/and white 2-finger head, leaving healthy lacing all the way down the glass as the head fades into surface film with a thick ring - the hop aroma is nice, along with fresh grassy/piney action - taste follows nice and sharp, a good hop bite on the tip of the tongue with a nice citrus fade towards the back - a little sticky, yet clean, knowwhati'msayin'? = very smooth - I wish she'd picked up a couple more, this one went down way too easy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Stone never fails to disappoint.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,knm,4.42,"I am very impressed with this beer, by bottle and by tap! Its taste is very smooth for a beer such high alcohol content. Quite hoppy with not to much sweetness.

147,88,ramseye4,3.92,"Pours a cloudy yellow color, huge head, and as expected, huge lacing. Aroma is hops, hops, and more hops. It is simple, but appealing. A bit of citrus and slight grapefruit, but the aroma is of primarily hops.Bitter hops dominate the taste, with some lemon and citrus, with hop bitterness dominating the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated, and drinkability is good for a beer of this ABV. Overall a good IPA, but nothing special.

S - A beautiful blend of fruitiness and hops. Neither really overpowers the other and they blend wonderfully together.  T - A very nice citrus start with a piney but mild bitterness. Very pleasant.  M - Crisp, refreshing, lightly carbonated. I like it!  D - Very very drinkable. Stone makes very good IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,veinless,3.98,"Pours a cloudy yellow/gold, head is white and not as plentiful as I would have expected. Whatever head was there disappeared quickly.  Smells hoppy and has deep floral notes, with a bit of honey mixed in. Simple, yet pleasing aroma.  Taste is similar, as it doesn't counter the bitterness of the hops with much of anything, but is not too bitter (in my opinion) as to be unpleasant.  Leaves a nice sticky bitter coating in mouth and is very crisp from start to finish. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, and each gulp does down easy. Simple, well done IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Rings all the way down the glass; a great pour.  S- Citrus blast. Nice hops in this one.  T- Bitter hops- grapefruit pith and an earthy pine bitterness that lasts for days. Great west coast flavors. Tongue-twisting bitterness.  M- Very well put-together, no off-notes, no flaws. Great carbonation.  D- Fairly high. And damn cheap. Pretty good stuff. Not top-tier, but tasty.

The beer is fairly transparent as well. Slightly creamy. The palate could be a bit better. The beer is full of hop flavor. The dry hopping did pay off if you ask me. The bittering hop just gets all over the back of your mouth. I love this beer because the focus is all in the hops. Not really much to say about the malts. Overall, a good bitter/hoppy IPA from Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bendurgin,4.72,"Poured into a pint glass. Thanks for letting me snag one of your bottles of this guy Andy! Pours a slightly hazy straw color with about a finger of white fluffy head. A big aroma of dry piney hops and citrus zest. The aroma very nicely blends dry and juicy aromas. Probably the most balanced IPA I've smelled in a while. This is like smelling a pine tree spayed with sweet tropical juice. The taste is perfect. It simply doesn't get better than this. Dry piney hops, dry bitter flavor with a lemony finish and slight citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is light and sharply carbonated. Nothing to argue with here. This is amazing. I want to be able to get this with my meal at Wendy's. I simply want this all the time. It's almost not fair that I can't drink this all the time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MeisterBurger,4.08,"Pale gold in color, lighter than many others of the style, topped by a bright white frothy head that laces like a beast.  A blast of freshly peeled yellow grapefruit dominates the aroma with a whisper of malt sweetness fighting to be heard.  A bready malt hits a barage of piney spiciness, all ending in a long bitter finish. The bitterness level is spot-on, but the dry hopping also adds a layer of complexity to the flavor invoking thoughts of lemon rind and mandarins.  The creaminess of the mouthfeel melds with the malt and helps stave off the bitterness nicely. Slightly chewy while at the same time crisp.  Maybe not my favourite IPA ever, but in terms of mass produced IPAs it's well up there. Please, someone, anyone, make this available in Ontario.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,secondtooth,4.94,"Pours a cloudy gold, with a large head of foam.  Nose is big and floral, with an unmistakable grapefruit/citrus hops character.  Taste is clean and bitter, punchy and explosive on the palate. A little sweet malt to balance.  The relatively high ABV (6.9%) is hidden well.  Packed with big flavor and freshness, this is a top-tier brew with character and guts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,andrewinski1,4.63,"Poured into a pint glass. Very light straw colored. There is just the tiniest bit of haze here. Large 2 finger white head. Almost as good as it gets.  Great nose that is full of citrus and rosemary. Any aroma from the malt is not worth mentioning here; it's secondary. Not too complex, but it's an IPA, it should smell like hops and it does.  The very first sip I took began with a hint of malt sweetness. After that the bitter hop finish dominated. Lots of grapefruit flavor in this one. I do not detect any sweetness the second sip and beyond. This qualifies as very dry for sure.  The carbonation is pretty high, as indicated by the foaming during the pour; possibly emphasizing the bitterness. Good drinkability on this one. It's one of my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,cjacobsen,4.35,"Pours a yellow/orange straw color. Slight haze appearance, not fully clear. Small, thin white head.  Smells of hops with some citrus to it. Orange peel and slight lemon. There are grassy and floral notes to it as well.  Very nice taste to it. It's got a good amount of hops but they don't hit you until mid taste, and then it's a good mix of bittering and flavor. Does have a slight lemon hint to it. Its not overly bitter like the other IPAs are. It's got a good amount of flavor, but it doesn't demolish your tongue.  It's surprisingly very smooth. I expected a bit more harshness on the sip but its not there.  I've had a lot of IPAs lately and they all seem to start running together. The market is saturated with a lot IPAs tasting really similar. This one is very good and not overpowering. The Ruination is definitely more along the lines of what I've been seeing in the market lately, but this beer is a nice balance of body and taste.

Had this before,back in my native home state of CA, this is my first reviewing it here.  A=Light-orange, with surprisingly little head, leaving faint lacing. Not very good in appearance character for an IPA, but don't be fooled.  S&T=Nice power of hops coming at you, but not overdone, perfectly balanced with a solid malt backbone. MMMM MMMm!!!! Very Tasty.  B=Solid medium body, with good carbonation that doesn't distract from the good flavors here.  Another outstanding IPA, a good solid example of the West Coast IPAs. I miss my home state so much. Will be getting again, when I can find it here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBear11D,4.47,"12oz bottle  Pours a solid clear golden orange with a foamy nearly white head with good lacing.  Citrus hops galore; grapefruit and orange are the standouts. The hops are extremely abundant, but not unpleasantly so, just enough to build the anticipation for the flavor to come.  The citrus hops make an amazing flavor with grapefruit leading the way. I also am picking up some orange, lime and perhaps a hint of caramel tucked in the back, but only for a brief moment. This beer is all about the citrus hops.  This is a very smooth beer with lively, active carbonation and medium body.  Thank goodness I have a 6 pack of this because just one will not suffice. Well worth the price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hopshopshops,4,"A good, but not great IPA. Still, a good IPA beats just about anything else out there.  This is another West Coast, citrusy hoppy. beer. The taste is very good but it seems to lack a bit of body and finish. This would be a dry IPA to my taste and lacking a bit of a malt balance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thebrood1987,5,"My favorite all around regular IPA hands down. I'd buy this one every single time if it wasn't so expensive for a 6 pack. I understand though why it costs so much because its really top notch, top quality beer. Many IPA's use a lot of the similar American hops but for some reason the way this is brewed it comes out very unique in its smell and flavor. I can't compare this to any other beer really. The smell is just fantastic it has a huge smell of pine and this pungent perfume citrus, floral, flowery smell. Others have said this could be a cologne for hop heads and really it could. It has that sort of a thick quality hop perfume smell to it underneath the upfront pine smell.  The taste is just like the smell hitting you with crisp refreshing hops up front a surprising bready malt quality and that famous long bitter citrus/ pine finish. It's very drinkable and probably the most refreshing IPA I've ever had without being too light bodied. If you are looking for hop bitterness this one is it. This IPA has a higher bitterness than most double/imperial IPA's... not to mention a ridiculous amount of hop flavor. I just can't say enough good things about this beer.  The hop bitterness, the bready malt and the hop pine flavor is everything you could ever ask for in this style of beer. West coast IPA's usually have this sort of pungent different smelling and tasting IPA but this one nails that unique quality of a west coast beer. The only one that I've tried that comes close is Sierra Nevada's Torpedo ale but I'd say this has a richer taste to it plus more hoppy bitterness. Thank you Greg Koch for my favorite IPA to date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tifore,4.32,Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A - Pours a bright hazy yellow orange color. Almost neon-ish in the light. A crisp 2 finger head forms that is bright white in color and leaves loads of sticky lacing as the head deflates.  S - Has an amazing smell of west coast citrus hops. Very fresh and crisp smelling. Lots of green apple and some citrus tones. Smells very refreshing.  T - Taste is crazy on the palatte. A downright hop bomb that has a awesome citrus taste and great finish.  M - Lots of carbonation holds the hops up well. Has a great fresh mouthfeel and a bit of lingering bitterness but thats expected.  D - A classic definition of the IPA style.

There is a slight malty undertone that adds a little balance, but this is a nice hoppy beer.  M: A nice medium body with sufficient carbonation. Leaves a bitter taste on the palate.

147,88,TheOtherMike,3.18,"As a fan of Stone's Pale Ale and IPAs in general, I thought this would be much better than what I found. It is sometimes available in my area.  I would not consider this offering to be ""over-the-top"" for an IPA as is Bell's ""Two-Hearted"". But it does somehow just miss the mark for what I prefer. I think the presence of PINE is overdone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The smell gets you hooked, just like a beer should smell. Fruity hoppy dry armoma just slaps your palate before you take a sip. Tastes very fruity and juicy, definitely some citrus going on. There's a nice sweetness to it as well, which is very pleasant; slightly malty. Finishes dry, but slightly juicy, enjoyable! The taste will have you coming back for more.  In the world of IPAs, this is definitely up there w/ the best, you can argue it's the benchmark. Classic IPA, classic example of the style.

There was a pepper spice and hop bitter smell to the beer; green and sweet at the same time. Tastes of pine and hops on first taste, somehow balanced with a sweet base.

Some toffee with grapefruit and some woodsy characteristics.  The hops keep punching you and there is a candy malt background. The hops are very piney with some citrus bringing up the rear.  Pretty light(malt) IPA with amazing hop characteristics Pretty easy to drink and leaves a nice astringency so you constantly want more.

Head quickly dies by about half, leaves a nice lacing almost immediately and continues to do so throughout the time it took me to enjoy it.  Tons of hops in the nose and it seems to have almost everything: piny, citrusy, grassy, some floral notes.  Taste is similar to the nose. All hops, more citrus, grapefruit and grassy notes than floral or piny. Real crisp, dry finish with a bitterness that lingers on the tongue.  Medium body and medium carbonation in this one. Carbonation seemed to fade towards the end but that may be more of a product of me taking a bit to enjoy this one rather than a characteristic of the beer.  About as highly drinkable as possible for a brew of this ABV.

147,88,OneDropSoup,4.03,"Poured into a tulip pint: Moderately vigorous pour creates four fingers of glistening, buoyant, cotton head that drops to a thick finger with a mound in the middle & leaves resinous patches of lacing all around the glass. Body is golden-orange, barely clear, with moderate nucleation. Attractive.  Solid smell of grapefruit, tangerine zest, a little grass, with a lingering baked sweetness in the background, like lemon bars. Nothing unexpected, but solid.  Sweet, light, & citric up front, then rolls in a moderately piney bitterness that takes over & pushes the other flavors aside. Like I said, it's moderate & doesn't overwhelm, but it definitely takes charge. Kind of phases itself out & allows a little maltiness back in, but only slightly. Crisp finish & that bitter sticks around in the aftertaste, like I chewed on a little bit of grapefruit peel.  Medium-bodied, active mouthfeel that's close to abrasive but just pulls back. Still, my tastebuds are still feeling it afterwards.  All around solid IPA, nothing jumping out at me, the alcohol's well-concealed. This could easily be a repeat taster, though I after maybe three I'd probably have reached my limit. Not incredible, but very decent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CaptDavyJones,4.35,"Poured a deep straw/golden color from a 12 oz bottle with the gargoyle, ABV and the freshness date on the label. Massive, massive head that stays forever with good carbonation. The aroma is high on hops, with hints of malts, pine, sweetness and yeast. This is an 'in your face' IPA, the hops have a titillating effect on your taste buds. The hops are blended perfectly with the malts, an oily piney aftertaste lingers. Very good lacing along the glass as I kept sipping. Stone has a lot of winners, and this is definitely one of them. A solid IPA and a treat for every hop-head. Mouthfeel is very good with a nice smooth finish and only makes you want to have more. Drinkability is therefore good, but it is a good idea to keep the drinking in check. Would definitely have this beer any time, any place. All in all, a highly recommended IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerisfoodLLC,4.32,"Poured into a pint glass at a bar in downtown Baltimore:  A - Gold in color, slightly hazy, thick head.  S - Citrus & Pine scents, slight alcohol notes.

Very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,curasowa,4.04,"Pours a golden yellow color with 3 fingers of creamy head. The floral hop aroma is noticeable without even lifting the glass to my nose. Upon closer smell, there is a lush bouquet of floral, lemon and grapefruit hops. Hop bitterness right off the bat over a sweet malt backbone leading to a very bitter, slightly oily finish that is quite lingering. Body is medium and drinkability is OK, hurt by a bitterness that boarders on harsh. I know that's Stone's thang, but I think this would be an exceptional IPA if they toned down the bitterness just a touch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BEERMILER12,4.5,"A: Pours a golden yellow color with 2 fingers worth of puffy head that leaves nice lacing and retains well  S: Strong aromas of citrus and piney hops along with a generously smaller malt backbone. Hops kill it here  T: Follows the nose. Hops all the way, with the nice citrus and pine notes along with a lightly bready malt backbone that does just enough to hold the hops up and be slightly balanced  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: This is one killer IPA that focuses on hops, hops, and more hops. The malt does just enough to balance out the hops and make this one drinkable brew. Definitely a top-tier IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Rschis16,4.43,"beautiful beer, has that perfect amber color, almost orange, and just looks like quality. Smells like hops and tastes the same. Huge hop taste up front and yields to a dry, hoppy finish. Great beer, maybe a little too big for my taste as an everyday beer but who knows, I could really see myself growing a taste for this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,daledeee,4.28,Got the last six pack of this while in Wisconsin.  Pours a very clear yellow and big nice head.  Nose is really floral with hops. Clean smellling.  Taste is medium hoppy and the citrus floral thing is going on also. This is a very easy to drink beer. Five years ago I would have given this really high marks. There are so many IPA's out there now that this one is above average but not THE best.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,climax,4.5,"Stone IPA is on the pale side. The bright gold body has pretty good clarity after the haze and bubbles calm down. The head was a good few fingers of eggshell froth which receded lazily leaving notches all the way down.  The aroma oozes herbal goodness. Cannabis (good cannabis) buds, grass, orange pith, bubblegum, and soapy bitterness.... Yum. The malt.... er, I don't know where it is, but I'm assuming they put some in there somewhere. Not too worried about it, my search party's too distracted by this hop delirium.  The flavor is bursting with hop oils. The pinching bitterness, teases the taste buds and then squeezes the cheeks in the long finish. This is an assault of hops for being just the ""regular"" IPA, but I'm digging being in the line of fire. Heavy grass and white grapefruit flavors take the stick and beat the other flavors with it. Some tangy orange with a hair of sweetness get a couple blows in before getting mauled once again in the finish.  This one has good viscosity and stickyness, yet it still feels light and very easy to drink. Nice balance. The carbonation keeps it crisp and alive, but doesn't me distract from the bodacious flavor. The feel begins to get chalky half way through and turns to try in the finish. Give me more!  Not that they need more reinforcement for what they do, but +1 Stone. Find me a flaw in this one, and I'll drink Bud light for the rest of my life.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ryantaussig,4.45,A: Head and lacing are out of control with this beer. I wish I had used my Duvel tulip instead of my Piraat because of the etching. It's not really needed--I just want to see it. It might have pushed it up to a 5. As close to perfect as you can expect.  S: Lots of complex hop aroma here. There's a vegetal leafiness to it to go along with the fruity esters that also come through.  T: Excellent levels of hop bitterness with just enough malt backbone to balance. Vegetal character cuts through and the fruitiness and sweetness buzz around in the background. Excellent overall balance for an IPA without sacrificing any of that hop bitterness we all love.  M: Quite smooth for a medium bodied beer. Finish has a certain drying effect because of all those hop oils. Quite good here.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,politicsandbeer,4.89,"Stone's IPA is the darling of hopheads far and wide. It's so adored I feel like I'm venturing into the lions den with this one. So here's my confession: I've tried it multiple times on draft at the beer wonderland Redbones in Davis Sq, Somerville and it totally failed to impress every single time, to the point where I'd had sworn off trying it anymore. Until now. I threw a 12oz into my 6-mix in a last ditch effort to find something endearing.  The pour was thick and with a solid head of foam. I can't even begin to describe the aroma. Well here goes: Fantastic! Deep green hops! Velvety sweet, soft and wonderful! If the beer stopped here I'd be happy. It smelled freaking awesome!  Ok, so I was damn impressed from the beginning. But the next hurdle was the taste. First sip was an assault of nasal filling hoppiness that zig-zagged all over my palette. Very hop oil heavy, some serious pine sap, grapefruit, minor citrus and it got greasy and a little leafy. Thankfully there was a solid amount of sweetness to back it up but it definitely didn't eclipse the hops.  Another attribute that really made this ale such a success was the thick, creamy mouthfeel while the carbonation kept it feeling a little frothy.  The aftertaste was full of little pinpricks of piney bitterness on the palette, like little electrical charges ""fzzzting"" and crackling. The oil left a really nice coating on the tongue. Visually, a heavy lacing clung to the glass the whole way down.  After I was done with this glass I was absolutely craving another one. I'll have to stick to bottles for this puppy from now on because this was one helluva great ale.  Speaking of bottles, they have very unique labels, or lack thereof. I looked into it since it's obvious they don't glue paper labels onto their bottles. Instead they use a process called Applied Ceramic Labeling which consists of silk screening their logo onto the bottle and then firing it at @ 1150 degrees so the color actually becomes part of the bottle.

147,88,spinrsx,4.15,"12oz Bottle  Appearance - The beer pours a hazy amber colour with a massive size creamy and frothy off white head. I can't make out much carbonation due to the haziness of the beer and there is some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - caramel, hops, pine, citrus zest  Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the beer has a very full bodied taste and feel. There is a lot of hop taste and pale malts mixed with caramel, citrus zest and pine. The beer finishes with a very hoppy and slightly woody aftertaste.  Drink - Another one of Stone's beer that I really enjoyed. It is a really hoppy/citrus based IPA that isn't too sweet - which I like. It's a must try for all the IPA fans out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BerkeleyBeerMan,4,Appearance: Light golden honey colored hues. Beautiful creamy head. The head has good lacing. The beer is somewhat cloudy.  Smell: Sweet malts. Hops have bright floral aromas. Hops are slightly citric and acidic  Taste: This beer taste good in the mouth. This is a delightful beer after a full day of work. It's got the great hoppy taste. It burns a little bit and goes down the back of the throat bitterly. It has a citric quality to it. The beer is well balanced with the malts complementing the hops well.  Mouthfeel: Generous long mouthful with a long lasting taste that is pleasant on the tongue. It swishes around well in my mouth with citrus and floral flavors taking turns. The hops taste good and high quality. The beer taste fresh and isn't overly carbonated.  Drinkability: This is heavy stuff. It isn't for tte faint of heart when it comes to drinking IPA's. This is a strong IPA. I couldn't drink too many of these in a row but it leaves such a satisfying aftertaste that sticks around.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,vandemonian,3.48,"Stone IPA has a nice orange colour and a good 1cm head that that fades to sparse lacing after about 3 mins. It smells faintly of hops, citrus and yeast. Very hoppy up front with some bitterness. The aftertaste is metallic and slightly bitter. This beer is watery in the mouth.

Citrus in there and a certain sugary quality to it as well.  T: You definitely know stone made this. It has that aggressive feel and taste that i'd call a 'burn' not in the alcohol burn kind of way, but in that way it makes your palate and throat tingle with warmth. Nice bright citrus hops balanced well to thick bready malts and a bitter finish. Very nice ipa that defines what Stone is about.  M: Nice feel, smooth and carbonated nicely with a warming sensation too.  D: Very nice ipa to have around. Solid stock beer from stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TCHopCraver,4.35,"Reviewed from notes created on 11/16/10.  Stone IPA pours a golden-amber color with an eggshell-white, one-finger head into a hefty snifter. After the head recedes, clumpy, frothy ovals and circles of various sizes remain atop the body. Straight, sinewy lines of carbonation move fairly quickly up the sides of the glass. The lacing is great, with a mountain-esque top sguiggly line and many small dots and lines underneath.  When I smell this beer, a wild, unrestrained hop odor fills my nose. Skunk, grass, and fresh bud aromas are evident as soon as the cap is popped off of the bottle. Further delving into the scent reveals a little bit of grapefruit and orange zest to go along with the other hop aromas. A little bit of caramel and biscuit are also in the smell profile, providing a bit of balance to the unrelenting hops.  Bitter skunk, grapefruit, grass, and a certain herbal flavor pop onto my tongue at first sip. The caramel malt flavor balances out the hops in the middle of the sip, then a piney hop bitterness finished off the taste.  The mouthfeel is on the light-bodied side, but the potent hop bitterness stinging my palate makes up for that shortfall. I could use a little more creaminess and less wateriness, but this is a crisp and well carbonated feel.  This is an IPA that I really enjoy and I revisit it from time to time. I think it is a fairly session-able IPA, though the hop bitterness might crush a palate after a few bottles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChadQuest,3.2,"Ah, my first beer in 6 days. I've been really looking forward to this. Hazy golden orange color with a heafty bone white cap.

147,88,Fenris244,4.28,"Poured into my favorite stein from the bottle  The pour produced a sticky 3 finger head that stayed forever and clings to the glass on it's way down. After it finally vanishes it leaves a thick layer of foam on the surface of the beer, the beer itself is almost a pale amber color with a hazy look to it. No joke this beer has the best looking head I've ever seen.  The smell is hops and citrus, lemony, with hints of the malt tucked away as well as some floral and earthy notes  Big powerful hop bitterness at first as well as more lemon, almost lemon peel flavor that fades into an awesome malty sweetness on the finish that almost completely cancels out the initial bitterness.  It's crisp, smooth and light as far as the mouthfeel goes, everything I expect from an ipa  Very drinkable, easily my go to ipa.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zhanson88,4,"Appearance: Stone IPA pours a slightly hazy straw color with orange highlights, and just over a finger of eggshell white head. It reduces down pretty slowly and results in a slight amount of fine lacing.  Smell: Lots of grapefruit and citrus (mostly orange rind) notes in this one. Piney hops as well, and maybe a hint of tropical fruits.  Taste: Grapefruit and citrus come out the strongest up front, with maybe the slightest hint of malts. The finish is piney and very bitter from the hops; overall drowning out other components more than anything.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is just over light bodied with quite a bit of fine carbonation. Overall, a good IPA that I buy pretty often when I get the chance to get it fresh. I would prefer more fruitiness and a little less bitterness, but it is very refreshing in the end.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Hops Hops Hops. Citrus dominating, especially grapefruit, but also a light floral note and a twinge of pine. More orange rinds and grapefruit though. Very nice, very fresh. There is a very subtle but appropriate balancing bready malt note underneath as well, lending just enough to balance but still showcase the hope aroma.  T: Floral and herbal hop is big in the introduction with a nice and surprisingly ""there"" malt character. Midpalate is lightly bready with a bunch of fruity hops laid on top, namely pineapple. Finishes very dry with a spicy bitter character but also with some balance there.  All around a very solid IPA, very bitter, but still retaining some balance. Awesomely drinkable. Will pick this one up again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T - A pretty typical IPA offering. A little stronger than some, but by no means high ABV. A bit more floral/citrus than, say, a Bridgeport, but also a bit more bitter. Similar to Titan IPA from Great Divide, but a little less sweet. I do prefer Titan to the Stone offering, but I'm a malt freak.  M - Very nice. Perfect amount of carbonation, a little residual stickiness without being heavy.

147,88,laituegonflable,4.32,"Feels funny reviewing this beer now since I know Greg Koch would hate the fact that I've tried it at all. For the record, I bought this not knowing it was grey market and drank/reviewed it before I'd heard his thoughts. Suffice to say I was disbelieving a lot of what he said during his interview, since this was a cracker when I drank it.  Pours a pale golden colour, with huge white fluffy head, reverse cascade puffing around in a jumpy and excited fashion. Sinks a little quickly, but retains a finger's depth. Lacing is quite nice, thin spidery webs. Pretty good.  Tasty aroma. Lots of hops, really nice cascade aroma and pleasantly strong malt underlying. Cake dough with some bread grain as well. Hops are enough to balance the maltiness but not too much. Yeah an IPA aroma, not a double. Just pleasantly balanced and nicely hoppy.  Taste is quite malty, lots of grain with cereal notes and honey on there, then hops come through nicely, with cascade flavours, apples and pineapple and of course some bitey citrus zest. Nicely balanced, but a touch of resiny bitterness which has a slighly dank effect on the very very back, just overrides the last trace of zesty citric hop and makes it finish on a slight low note. Otherwise a great IPA palate.  Great body, nice textures, I can't really fault that, just goes down smooth.  A tasty beer. Balance, flavour, aroma are all really great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I've had this on tap so I know it's not just a freshness thing. This beer is all bitter all the time. Piney, acrid and harsh. Again maybe a touch of burnt tires.

The first thing that hit the tongue is actually the solid malt backbone. Then the hops, pines, and citrus hop in an an explosion of flavor that quickly yields back to the malt backbone.

Some minimal lemon and lime citrus behind that. Very subtle honey-like sweetness.  (M)- A good carbonation level. A decent balance, but it really is primarily a very dry bitter pine profile of a beer.

There are notes of citrus, pine, and sweet notes.  T - This has a very nice hop presence, and they are definitely the star of this beer. There is also some citrus, caramel, and grapefruit notes.  M - Nice mouthfeel. Medium bodied with medium carbonation.  D - Drinkability is great. I can drink these all night and not get bored with the flavor. This beer goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. I like it because it showcases hops more than a lot of other IPAs out there. I think stone did a good job on this one.

Hints of herbal spearmint like hops show up as well. Finishes like you brushed your teeth with a grapefruit.  M - Medium bodied.  This beer is bursting with fruit flavor!

147,88,AWolfAtTheDoor,3.18,"What is it with me and Stone. I just can't wrap my head around their hop profiling. I love the RIS, Smoked Porter and Old Guardian, but I just don't like (m)any of their main offerings.  Poured into my pint glass. Nice foamy head, respectable lacing throughout the session.  Smell, typical stone hopped smell. Like this dysfunctional marriage of pine and citrus.  Taste is more of the same. Very piny, with some bastardized sour citrus thrown in.  Mouthfeel can best be described as ""blech"" as the sourness lingers from a relatively syrupy beer.  Got to be one of my least favorite IPAs. If you are forced to drink this against your will, I would suggest letting it warm way up. I drank the second half of the bomber at damn near room temperature, and it was much more palatable that way. I have had more than one of these, but I bought this bomber specifically to review it. Won't be buying anymore in the future. It's not all Stone's fault; there is some STEEP competition out here on the west coast. Just goes to show that any gorilla can dump a truck load of hops into the brewing vat. It takes an artist to carefully choreograph the delicate balance that makes a beer truly great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BuxMontBeerLover,3.92,"I've had the Stone Arrogant Bastard in a 22oz bomber and enjoyed the extreme hoppiness of it. I was in the distributor deciding to either go with my everyday IPA (DFH 60) or try something new. Went with the Stone IPA. Served in a DFH Signature glass.  A-Nice amber color. Slightly cloudy but not off putting. Lots of carbonation rising from my glass. Nice lacing left on the side of the glass.  S-Nice citrusy smell mixed with a sweet, hoppy smell.  T-Definitely more on the hoppy side than the DFH 60 which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There's a nice grapefruit or citrusy taste mixed in which is pretty common with many of the IPA's I've tried.  M-Nicely carbonated. Leaves a slightly bitter taste in the mouth after each sip.  D-Tough call...I liked this beer a lot BUT not as much as my DFH 60. I don't know quite what it is but if given the choice in the future, I'd rather have a DFH 60 or even a Founder's Centennial IPA or Lagunitas IPA. That being said, I'll have no problem finishing off my case. Worth a try for sure...  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,greenmonstah,4.17,"12 oz bottle  A - Pours a cloudy light caramel-color with half a finger of frothy white head. Considerable sediment is apparent throughout. Fantastic lacing on my pint glass.  S- Mostly pine hops with some citrus hops thrown in.  T - Hops are actually not that pronounced, thought their flavor does last. The malt character is nice, and the finish includes a very appealing breadyness. Well balanced and delicious, but not as hoppy as I expected -- probably not the best IPA for hop heads.  M - Actually a bit thin for my tongue. Good carbonation with bubbles that just keep on coming.  D - Oh yes. Very tasty with that lovely finish that is actually a bit warming. Easy to down and would be wonderful to session. Good competition for 60-Minute in that respect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CASK1,4.17,"S: Spicy, citrusy hop aroma dominates. Low caramel malt aroma in support, but definitely a hop-forward beer.  A: Pale amber. Hazy, didn't clear even on warming. Good initial off-white head fades, but leaves a persistent thin layer of foam.  T: Complex hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor dominates. Enough malt character to barely balance the hops, but decidedly a hoppy beer! Dry, bitter finish.  MF: Medium to high carbonation is a plus. Medium body, bitter, lingering dry finish.  D: Very drinkable for a hophead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nataku00,4.2,"On tap poured into a straight sided glass. A golden yellow with a finger of head initially that dissipates very quickly. Good carbonation visible through the clear beer, but it doesn't help feed the head.  Nose is citrus peel, lemon and grapefruit, with an herbal mix that makes it fairly pleasant. Mostly rosemary. Some malt also detected but very light.  Taking a sip, the taste follows the nose early on the tongue. The taste continues through to the aftertaste that lingers lightly after swallowing. A nice flavor profile that isn't overly bitter.  Light bodied beer is nice enough to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Franz4,4.3,"A- light golden color, slightly translucent, huge, beautiful off-white head that doesn't want to leave. Crazy lacing as I drink it and as the head settles.  S- floral and citrus hops. Citrus is more lemon/lime than grapefruit. Some pine notes as well.  T- Citrus/lemon hops come through first. I want to drink this beer as fast as I can. Some grassy notes as well, but I'm having trouble taking the time to describe the taste when I just want to finish the glass.  M- medium bodied, leaves a hop aftertaste but it's not unpleasant.  D- Very drinkable, absolutely lovely. I've been waiting to try this and now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long.

147,88,NODAK,4.05,"Aroma here is of a lot of pine trees. Really. Very hoppy...if there are any malts in there, they're hiding.  Pours a golden color with a fluffy, white head on it. Fair thickness...good lacing.  What's somewhat surprising about this beer is that the hops are not entirely all THAT bitter on the taste. I guess they saved that for Ruination. The bitterness is actually fairly standard for an IPA. Stronger than some, weaker than others. From the start, there's a good pine resin, oily hoppiness that envelopes the tongue...it fades a little in the middle of the swallow, only to come back just as bitter on the finish with notes of grapefruit. The bitterness lasts a bit into the aftertaste as well in a small way. On the finish, there is a bit of creamy malt (and I do mean a little) showing up, but is still definitely behind the hops. I will also add that the mouthfeel is definitely thicker than what I'd expect most IPA's to be.  I'm surprised about this beer, to be quite honest. Stone has done a solid job of creating a good IPA here, without going too far.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Chizoad,4.03,"Poured into a pint glass. Nice clear amber color and with a good, fluffy head with the fat bubbles I like so much. I love it when the bubbles are varied in size and can take a long time to pop. Excellent lacing.  Good nose. I suppose if I couldn't get a lot of the CA IPAs, I would think this is nirvana. From my perspective though it's still a good but not outstanding classic west coast IPA smell. Piney/citrusy hops and a malt undercurrent.  Very similar taste with a lingering bitterness characteristic of Stone beers. I like the balance here, and the flavor is distinct from all of the other IPAs I've had.  Good mouthfeel, although it did have a slight building bitterness. Not overwhelming, but a little disconcerting since I excpected it to get out of control.  Very drinkable, and highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,mattgreger,3.84,"Pours a nice Amber colored body, with a decent sizes creamy white head. Little bit of lacing that hangs out for a bit. Not much carbination, which could be a challange on this one.  Aromas are very present on this one. Very heavy with a citris hops aroma in the forefront of this one. Its followed up with some other aromas as well...being some some caramels, oranges, and a trail of a floral hops as well.  The taste on this brew is very good. The first sip of this brew has a nice hoppy flavor to it. It follows up with a strong presence of grapefruit and a hint of orange mixed as well. Its sweet and bitter all at once, which makes this a very interesting beer. Its very nice finish.  The mouthful is great on this west coast born IPA. Its crisp and smooth and has the perfect bitterness that you expect from an IPA. Spices sit well and give you that bit of a bite you are looking for. Nice medium body and little carbination, which actually helps round out this beer.  Drinkability is good. This wouldn't be a great session beer due to the higher ABV, but it goes down smooth and I would definitly have it again. I will have to try some more brews by Stone Brewing Company.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kreeper,4.1,"This is another world class beer from Stone. Take it out of the fridge, let it sit on the counter for ten minutes or so before opening it, then lavish yourself in the beautiful floral aroma of hops. It's readily available in six packs in my area, so I'm spoiled. It has the hoppy, citrusy flavors one would expect from a west coast IPA. I've used this beer on four occassions to introduce a BMC type to real beer. Each time was successful.  Serving type: bottle",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NightINgale,4.2,"A - Hazy amber body, with a nice creamy beige head. Good head retention and some lacing. No visible carbonation to speak of.  S - West Coast-style citrus hoppiness. Juicy grapefruit, oranges, and some floral notes. Also hints of caramel, apple, and sour dough. Pretty hop-forward but not one-dimensional.  T - First you get a good hop bite, with very apparent grapefruit notes and a hint of orange. Then sweetness, breadiness, and bitterness come in all at once. The finish is bitter and bready, with a little tartness. Very tasty!  M - Light-to-medium body to it. Not very carbonated. Quite dry in the mouth, though. A little spiciness from the hops can be felt on the tongue. A little hint of alcohol.  D - Pretty good drinkability, however, I wouldn't make this my session IPA, because of its dryness and its ABV. Goes down smooth at first, but then it may become more challenging to drink, especially if you're not a hophead.  Overall, I agree that this is one of the finer examples of the style. A true classic American IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,joepais,4.46,"Well time to review this monster, I do mean monster. Because like with all the stone products they tend to be a tad heavy handed with there hops. With a IPA that can be a good thing.  The bottle poured into a Stone IMP pint glass produced the most perfect looking IPA you can imagine. It looks like the advertisement photos you see. A nice golden orange with a beautiful pillow of a white head on top. As you consume the brew the lace just follows the beer down the glass.  The aromas are hop forward. Again there is no surprise, it's the typical pine almost floral bouquet. I would expect from an IPA. Only hoped to the max.. (LOL) This is a typical west cost IPA. If you want to experience one out here in the east this is the one I would point you too. The flavor is bitter grapefruit with almost no malt profile in it at all. Balance would not be a word I use in describing this one. The feel is a soiled medium to me with a good amount of carbonation in it helping to cleanse the pallet.  This is a great IPA drinkability is perfect. This beer is one everyone needs to try at least once.

It has this large bouquet that lingers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Spider889,4.04,"Not my favorite beer, though I prefer the maltier Eastern IPA's more as it is. As a side note, Stone has proven to be about the worst bottles to save for homebrewing because their art is painted on the bottle, no label (I was saving these at first to reuse and eventually decided that it would be too obscene and pitched them). Very cool for drinking the beer though.  Appearance: Bottle is unique, good art, though trying the read the 4.5 type font 500 word essay on the back of their bottles is a chore, and ultimately for me, unrewarding. Pours a golden honey color, nice white foamy head.  Smells of straight hops. Pine, oily and resinous, semi-floral, and nothing even remotely close to sweet - I think Stone uses bittering hops as finishing hops!  The flavor is typical for a West Coast IPA. Very clean tasting, the quality on their beer is always spot on. Bitter dry hops, no malt or sweetness to obscure those little flowers that Stone pays homage to.  Crisp and easily drinkable if you like the style, this is a great beer. But for the price I can get other things that I like a lot more as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Came to me at the bar a dark yellow, with tangerine highlights. Minimal head, but nice off white lacing throughout.  Smell's instantly of hops. Sweet, piney citrusy hops. Clean and eye opening.  Tastes of sweet bitter hops right up the front, smoothe on the sides with a crisp finish. Very clean,crisp IPA.  Awesome when fresh and on tap. One of the hoppier single IPA's I've had. Extreme bitterness, with some creaminess to balance out the beer.  Outstanding, almost perfect IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,drtth,4.45,"Served in a standard shaker pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a clear peach/amber color with a ½"" fluffy white head that recedes slowly leaving sheets of foam on the side of the glass. Sipping leaves a sheet of ridged foam on one side that clings to the glass while on the other side the speckles and legs of lacing do their thing. The head and lacing on the glass persist for much of the beer.  Smell: The aroma is fresh pine mingled with grapefruit zest. There's a mild presence of malt. I'm expecting this one is going to be all about the hops.  Taste: As expected from the nose, the flavors are a nice mix of pine and grapefruit with maybe a touch of lemon in there too. While the malt backbone is present, the malt and its light caramel sweetness never really moves front and center, rather it keeps to its supporting role.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied and slightly smooth and creamy with the active carbonation. The finish is medium long and begins with the grapefruit zest showing but then trails slowly off in to dry light bitterness that just disappears.  Drinkability: I can see why this IPA regularly gets high marks. This is definitely a well-made beer that fits the style nicely. I have had this one before, am enjoying this one as each sip easily follows the one before. I certainly expect I'll be choosing this beer again in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sweet malts, followed by a very nice pine and citrus hop fusion that finishes with just the right amount of bitterness.  M - Medium in body, crisp and refreshing.

147,88,Dspohn,4.05,"Enjoy by 12/08/10, I believe this dating system for the IPA is for 3 months, making this bottle a few weeks old, a good start.  A firm pour yields a 2 inch white rocky white head on a clear light orange body. Some pretty nice lookin lacing also. The smell of this beer is a little interesting, very clean, with grapefruit and pine dominating. There is this sort of strange citrus rind almost melon like flavor and smell that I always get with this beer (Hop Czar from Bridgeport gives me the same thing). The taste is much the same, quite bitter with about equal emphasis on grapefruit and pine. No tropics to speak of. Some light malts give a little support but not much. Actually a quite bitter IPA when consumed fresh, I might actually go as far as to say this beer is more bitter than the Ruination which I find has some more sweet citrus and tropics. Pretty much the standard when it comes to IPAs, but definitely not the best. Carbonation is pretty much spot on.  The rindy/melon taste kind makes the flavor profile kind of distracting in my personal opinion. This is a beer I've had many times but is definitely not my favorite from stone. Give me a Ruination or SSR over their standard IPA any day when I'm looking for some hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: on the first whiff I got more sweet maltiness than hops but did manage to detect pine, bready, and slight citrus notes.  T: the hops are not that potent like the nose but it did seem to come with grassy, earthy, pine and tea like notes. I thought the malts were playing a prefect role on the balance and not overly sweet.  M: the brew was light to medium in body with a decent amount of carbonation which had a grassy, piney, tea like, and very mild hop bitter pinch.  D: it drank quite well but was kind of dissapointed on the hop profile and bitter punch that was lacking especially coming from the arrogant bastards.

Then come some pine hops which leave a bitter aftertaste. Well-balanced and not over-the-top. M: Well-carbonated and medium-bodied. D: Drinkable for the style, but I've had more drinkable IPAs. One or two is enough for me.  A good IPA, but nothing too special. I would recommend this, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.

Smell: Very floral and citrusy, with hints of caramel, grapefruit, and pine from the hops.  Taste: Absolutely wonderful, the bite of the hops is there, but it's not aggressive, it's balanced nicely with the malt. Finish is very nice, and leaves a hint of pine on the palate.  Mouthfeel: A bit of carbonation, just enough to feel a bit prickly, but not overbearing.  Drinkability: I could drink these all day long, but at 6.9% it would hit the head after a few. Absolutely a joy to drink",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SkunkWorks,4.64,"Bottle poured into a pint glass.  Look: There's a slight haze in the copper, straw colored beer with a pretty huge slightly off white head. The head leaves behind great lacing and retains very well.  Smell: One of the best smelling IPAs I've had. There's a huge floral hop character in the smell with some hints of citrus and grassiness. There's a little sweetness in there but its pretty much all hops all the time. Incredible.  Taste: Follows the nose very well. There's some toasted malt in there but its mostly the floral hops and the citrus hops in the taste. There's some pine taste towards the end of the taste. I'm surprised to see that its 6.9% alcohol because the taste doesn't give this impression at all.  Feel: this is medium bodied tending towards light. There isn't that much carbonation but just enough. Again, you don't taste the alcohol at all considering that its just shy of 7% ABV.  Drink: very drinkable. I got to the bottom of my glass a little quickly. Its just too delicious and its not something you have to sip. I could easily see drinking this as a session beer, even with the 6.9% ABV.  Overall, one of my new favorite IPAs. This along with Smuttynose's IPA are going to be my go tos for the style. I'm surprised I took so long to try this out given that Ruination IPA is one of my favorites.

147,88,kgrober,4.22,"Golden straw appearance with 85/15 beer to head split. Nice lacing that dissipates slowly.  Hoppy with lemon, lemongrass, and grapefruit notes. Fresh and sunny appearance and taste.  Mouthfeel is refreshing with nice balance of fluid and carbonation.  An above average IPA for me with excellent presentation and drinkable because of it's restraint with the alcohol and flavor characteristics.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,divineaudio,3.97,"bottle into a weizen glass. freshness date marked.  pours a standard translucent gold color with a little yellow around the edges. gave me a great big foamy head that rose above the edge of the glass before calming to a thin film. lots of sticky lacing left in my glass too. looks like it should.  big floral hop character in the nose rounded out by notes of citrus, fresh cut grass and lightly toasted bread.  taste is about what i expected. toasty malt with loads of flowery and fruity hop character. strong piney bitterness that hangs on the back of the tongue and a dry finish. nowhere near balanced, though i'm sure that was intentional.  mouthfeel is the lighter side of medium with enough carbonation to fell prickly.  pretty drinkable, but high enough abv that i really feel it after 2 of these. To me the epitome of west coast ipas and probably should be on everyone's beers to try list. i'm pretty sure this set the standard at one point, but there are certainly more exciting examples of the style out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CascadeConan,4.42,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a few fingers of off-white head that leaves sticky, resiny lacing that may require steel wool to remove.  The smell is pure IPA thoroughbred. Generous dry hopping is apparent in the heavy citrus notes of grapefruit and lemon zest as well as pine, very little malt in the aroma but who cares.  It tastes just like it smells, delicious. Very few IPAs I've tried have this delivery of hop characteristics but the retention of individual tastes and the citrus qualities of each hop variety is amazingly well blended. Finishes bitter but the malt carries it through smoothly.  Great beer to represent the American IPA style, bold hoppy flavor and boozy weighing in just shy of 7% ABV. Not a beer to session but goes well with spicy food and it's my go to for the over $10 sixer category.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,glazeman,4.02,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter  A: medium orange in color with a 1.5 finger white head. Moderate retention, and mild lacing.  S: Lots of lemons on the nose, with some tangerines as well. Nice smell, but not quite as complex or intense as I would have liked.  T: Mostly a citrusy IPA w/o much pine character to it. The main flavors I get are orange and grapefruit. There's a nice bitter kick at the end as well with a little bit of earthiness to it.  M: Par for the course. Nice level of carbonation, but it doesn't have as long lasting or nice of an aftertaste as top tier IPAs.  D: Great drinkability. This beer tastes pretty good and goes down easy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Eriktheipaman,4.49,To me this is the trademark beer for west coast styled IPA's. It has a nice head to it and great fruity smell. The color is an almost murky gold.  This beer is not meant to be a ballanced IPA and focuses purly on the bitter. There are some hints of almost citrusy flavors but they are wiped away almost instantly by the taste of hops and even more hops.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZacHart,4.54,"Pours a beautiful pale golden-orange color and offers a dense, thick head that fades slowly, leaving plenty of lacing and a thin persistent head. Aroma bursting with hops, namely citrus, pine, and grass aromas. A wonderfully balanced flavor with just enough malt to stand up the hops, and little alcohol detectable. Overall highly drinkable, and an outstanding example of the American West Coast's world-class IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bobhits,4.97,"In most styles of beer I take a standard somewhat generic beer and I hold all others to it. The APA for example is best shown by seirra nevada. I'd never call that a great beer, it's average in most of its efforts. With IPA's I used ot judge them to dogfish head 60 minute but stone ipa honestly is easier to get and all IPAs end up being graded down because they aren't stone.  The nose is other worldly, served in a stone iPA glass the nose is just breath taking. Floral, fruity, spicy, piny, and hell if I could have this as a perfume I'd buy it for all the ladies. This is the best smelling beer I've ever been with.  The appearance is cloudy off yellow/copper, an unimpressive head on this pour but normally it does far better. Leaves a decent but not amazing lacing. Not much carbonation.  I'm an atheist, but this beer makes me want to thank god for the taste. It's citrus, crispy, with malt COMPLETELY in the back seat but at the same time perfectly complementing the hops.  Look, I've given beers 5's before. This beer is the best beer I've ever had when I really truly sit back and judge fairly. I can't give the appearance a 5 though...again a flaw in the bro's scores. Many beers have exceptional qualities. This beer in many places is perfection...and there is no 6 to give.  In the quest to try every beer on the planet one often forgets about the easy to find and cheaper offerings. Well IPA lovers...there is no better staple. There is no beer I come back to as often and trust me I've got about 40 different beers in the fridge...this one will be bought again before all of those are even sampled.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Plokhooy,4.87,"For what it's worth, Stone IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale are the two stalwarts of the American IPA / Pale Ale class. Stone is a very drinkable IPA that is great for both hopheads and casual beer drinkers alike. Even if you are not a big fan of ""hopped up"" beers, this is still a must try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Julz,4.5,"A - Good head after it's poured into your glass. Nice light orange color, great carbonation that leaves pretty bubbles on top.  S - Good citrus and forest floor smell. Very simple, not at all overwhelming.  T - Very nice citrus with a yummy piney bite. You can make out the malts as you swallow, with a awesome hop flavor all around. The after taste makes you want to take another drink just to experience it again.  M - Not too heavy for an IPA with medium body and a great balance of carbonation.  D - Easier to drink than a lot of the IPA's out there. Not too bitter and goes down very easy. As I said in the beginning, each drink of Stone makes you want another. This is one of my favorites. All attitude, thanks Stone!  Serving type: bottle",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ADZA,4.3,"First of all i love the label and spiels on the back of these bottles just stoked to be able to be drinking a brew from Stone,it pours a non see through tangello hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a nice two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is nearly spot on with hints of pine resin,marmalade,passionfruit and lychee,it has a pleasant medium bodied mouthfeel which is lightly sticky and leaves you with tastes of passionfruit,tangerines,grapefruit,some light toffee malts and finishes with a tiny bitter tinge basically a perfectly balanced beer in my eyes that i could drink all night if given the chance and will definately revisit this fine drop.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GarrettMD,4.12,"A - Pours a hazy light orange/yellow hue. Very little head, but what head there is stays around as a thin layer of bubbles.  S - Smells like it should, citrus and pine hops, caramel malt background. Simple, to the point.  T - Taste is a lot more citrusy than the aroma implies. Caramel malts are still there but are pushed even further to the background by the fruitiness from the hops. Pine hops are slightly less prominent than the citrus. As the initial rush of hop flavors fades, it goes more towards the sweet caramel malt base. It fades very nicely into that with a bittersweet grapefruit taste.  M - Medium bodied, good carbonation. Very smooth on the tongue. Not as oily as most IPAs, more silky. Finish is sweet with some slight citrus notes.  D - Very good drinkability, 6.9% isn't too high, but definitely not ""sessionable."" Not so bitter that it will ruin your palate for the night, not too sweet to give you a headache after drinking one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BBP,4.48,"A- A honey gold color with fair carbonation and a massive foamy head.  S- Pine resin, citrus and hops. Not much malt to be found.  T- Leads with bitter hops and then becomes bittersweet as a grapefruit flavor begins to rush in. Leaves a very good grapefruit aftertaste. I've never been much of a grapefruit fan, but I'm starting to think that beer will make me one. A bit more hops than the average IPA.  M- Medium high body and a carbonation that goes perfect with it. Fairly creamy as well.  D- A very solid example of an IPA. To be honest, it's working it's way towards a double IPA. Very easy to down, and considerably hoppy. Would definitely get it again. More grapefruity than most though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mora2000,4,"The beer pours a hazy light amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of various hops, but is a little bit faint. I get some orange citrus, pine and flowery notes. The flavor is more assertive, with notes of pithy oranges and some caramel malt. The bitterness is about medium and just about right for a regular American IPA. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. A very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,alkemy,4.22,"Slight touch of haze in this deep yellow brew with bright orange hints throughout. Pretty fluffy head that reduces as expected, but manages to stick around a while. More of a floral secondary to citrusy hop notes in the nose. There's a good bit of hops in the nose and the taste. There's quite a bit of bready malts coming through as well. More of a citrus forward taste leaning toward grapefruit with only hints of pine. I found this to be very well balanced (what can I say, I like lots of hops.) Certainly finishes cleaner than Stone's bigger beers, but is great for the style. Not my favorite of the style, but right up there with the best of them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerNinja007,4.42,"Bomber served cold into a chilled pint glass. A moderate pour gives a nice 1"" of frothy off-white head on top of this semi-cloudy golden brew. The smell is a strong resiny pine hop, some mild florals and a bit of sweet light malt. The taste has an interesting body of tannins and a secondary malt sweetness that support a moderate dose of the sticky pine and florals detected in the smell. The earthy astringent tannin and bitter hop blend well together, tieing the body cleanly to the hop for a rounded full taste. The feel is perhaps a bit on the light side of moderately thick, with appropriate soft carbonation. Tasty. Lace lingers on the glass through the session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Spica66,4.22,"A: Light amber color with extreme head formation. Be careful when you pour this one!  S: This beer smells wonderful. Sweet malt and flowery hops mix together perfectly.  T: I expected the hops to be the main player, but the first drink taught me differently. The malt is very sweet on the front of your tongue, then the hops go to work. Nicely done, Stone Zen Masters.  M: Silky smooth malt and just the right level of carbonation. No alcohol burn at all.  D: Extremely enjoyable. Very easy to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,infi,4.43,"22 oz. bottle, best by 10.10.10.  Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a pale golden color full of carbonation with a beautiful off-white and cloud-like head with generous retention. Lots of foamy and sticky webbed lacing all over the glass too. My glass is completely covered by the dried lacing- I'm loving it. The aroma contains a large bouquet of earthy hops and sharp grapefruit citrus. There's a sort of soapy characteristic to the smell as well. Standard IPA aroma overall.  Very nice. Stone IPA is incredibly hop and malt-balanced. The flavor profile begins with some sweet and bready malts and then is followed by a nice hop crispness and grapefruit bite. The final bitterness is very minute and not as biting as other IPA's I've previously had. All of the qualities in this IPA are very well represented and perfectly balanced.  The mouthfeel is perfect, especially for an IPA. It's visually effervescent, but on the mouth it's incredibly smooth and silky. Almost like a porter or stout. The carbonation is barely noticeable on the tongue. Drinkability is noticeably high - definitely can have a couple more glasses of this delectable IPA. My first glass was finished in a matter of minutes due to its incredible taste and mouthfeel. This IPA is underrated!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kzoobrew,4.42,"Slight hazed golden body topped with a thick frothy antique whited head. The head retains its position for quite some time before receding. Thick sheets of lacing left coating the inner walls of the nonic.  Strong citrus aroma oozes from the glass. Tangelo and grapefruit scents overwhelm the nose. There is a very fine line when it comes to hop aroma between being pleasing and just too much. Once you cross that like the overwhelming citrus begins to evolve into something far from what it is suppose to be. Stone IPA manages to find that sweet spot where the aroma is intense while still pleasant.  If the aroma was great the flavor is incredible. The hop flavor is bright and juicy with an underlying biting bitterness. The strong citrus flavors meet a more subtle pine bite to even out the hop profile from becoming too sweet or too bitter. Malt creates a sturdy base with a pleasant pale malt with a light caramel malt sweetness. One way to ruin a good IPA is to go overboard with the caramel malt, Stone definitely keeps this is check.  Medium body with a smooth and clean texture. A resiny biting bitterness does dig in but the finish is still rather dry and pleasant.  Stone IPA is one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying. In my book it falls only behind Two Hearted amongest American IPA's. Tremendously enjoyable and easy to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tone,3.85,"Pours a hazy, maize color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops (pineapple/grapefruit), alcohol, pine, slight alcohol, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hint of floral hops, alcohol, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Overall, good standard IPA - nothing flashy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,herman77,3.7,"*Review from notes on 9/4*  A: Hazy deep honey color with an average white head. Pretty good lacing  S: Strong pine hops. Pretty much just raw aromatic hops in the nose.  T: Straight up bitter hops. Resiny. Intense pine hop rips up the palate. There is a touch of citrus flavors after the initial bitter hop bomb, but its hardly there. Finishes crisp and pretty clean. For how bitter it is, you'd think its very dry, but thats not the case here.  M: Light to medium body. Average carbonation. Very slick feeling probably from all the hop oils.  D: Drinkability is average at best for me, I personally prefer some malt and or tropical fruit flavors in my IPAs, but the malt was really lacking. Definition of a West coast IPA for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bmwats,4,"Poured from a 650 ml bottle into a standard pint.  A: Medium golden hue. Pretty heavy carbonation clings to the sides of the glass. Pours about a 2 finger, foamy, white head. Settles very slowly leaving plenty of sticky residue behind and nice little craters and peaks. Lots of spider web lacing remains as you drink.  S: Very piny, a little yeast, and a bit of a floral note.  T: Lightly malted and very hoppy.  M: Light but full. Hops assault the palette and linger throughout the experience. Steely aftertaste.  D: The hop bite will dictate sippage on this one.  Atmosphere is pretty great. Appearance is rich and golden with a giant foamy head that just won't quit. Plenty of persistent sticky lacing. Nose is not complex, but full and floral. Flavor, again, not complex, but full-on hop assault. Overall, this is a really good quaff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beyah,4.42,"I meant to grab a bottle of Ruination, but grabed a bottle of the Stone IPA, oh well let's give it a shot. Pours out of the bottle golden in color, nice head 1-2 fingers. The head disapears after a few miutes, nice lacing. The smell is wounderful. The hops are INTENSE, but have another sip it keeps growing on you. This is a very hoppy IPA, nice finish, hardly any trace of malt flavor. If you like IPA's and a beer heavy on the hops you have found your beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SolomonGrundy,3.8,"Pours a perfect orange-gold with only the faintest haze to it, almost no carbonation. Very little head with no retention, and some sticky lacing. Nose opens up with grapefruit and pineapple. Settles into west coast style aroma hoppiness...Flavor is burting out of the gate. Very full and rich for an IPA. Some alcohol in there, and it carries throughout the flavor, but isn't too much. Hops are huge here, and overpower almost all else. Some hints of candied apple, and maybe some vanilla but it's masked amidst the wash of hops. Finish is long and bitter in a good way. Priced well usually, so this is great everyday beer. However, it's the epitome of a West Coast IPA and not super unique at this point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,UncleDads,4.35,"Poured into a pint glass.  Medium brown color with two finger head. Lots of lacing with great head retention all the way down.  Smells of hops with a subtle hint of flowers and fruit. Really awakens your senses.  Taste starts out smooth at first then you are hit with the bitterness. You get a hint of malt and subtle alcohol flavors really bring this beer together.  This is a very drinkable IPA. There is just the right balance of hops, malt, and fruity notes. Great brew and will surely be having this again when i crave an IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,billshmeinke,3.82,"Poured into a pint glass.  Two finger tight white head. Slightly cloudy golden body. Impressive lacing left behind, and really nice retention.  The nose is filled with a sour dough like bread scent then piney hops, and a hint of citrus. The sourdough bread scent is a little too much for me.  Taste exhibits the same sour dough like bread note, then piney notes, resin bitterness, and a hint of grapefruit citrus.  The mouthfeel is light well carbonated, and crisp. Balanced malt sweetness and hop bitterness.  Super drinkable IPA, and a favorite of mine, especially in terms of availability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AgentMunky,3.8,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass.  A: A nice thick head sips atop a clear yellow beer, leaning towards gold, with faint bubbles rising upward. I have high hopes for this beer, but they are not met by the appearance.  S: Strong hops. And more hops. There may even be a faint citrus in here. Unless my nose is right in it, I don't smell very much. What is there is nice however.  T: Thick and bready, the hops provide all the substance for this beer, but with a faraway, underlying malt frame that is all but obscured. Heavy and sharp on the tongue, these are some spicy hops. The aftertaste is drying (but not dry) and interminably hoppy.  M: The hops dominate the initial and final mouthfeel. The midfeel is biscuity.  D: I feel the Stone IPA is overrated. It's a good beer, but not amazing. The hops are fun for a while, but too violent in the beginning of each sip. The 6.9% tells. I wouldn't buy another, but you should try just one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mdaschaf,4.47,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a DFH snifter glass  A: Pours a cloudy golden body with a large chunky head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving white splotches on top. Some really nice lacing down the sides of the glass.  S: A blast of hops as well as some pine and grapefruit. Also a little bit of malt on the back. Really nice and strong, expected from Stone.  T: A lot of hop flavor on this one! A nice combination of spice and a grassy/earthy component. The hops are nicely balanced by the malts.  M/D: Creamy and smooth, very easy drinking. A great IPA that I could drink everyday.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Baraka,4.72,"Pours a light gold with a solid sustaining head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is very citrusy with a hint of caramel. Really nice hop bitterness comes through, leaving a solid aftertaste as well. Malt is not really apparent in the flavor, which is perfect for my taste. Imo, this is pretty much the paradigmatic west coast IPA: hoppy and delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TMoney2591,4.1,"Served in a Devil's Backbone willibecher.  We'll see how long it takes me to die during the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. My guess is not much longer. This co-defendant pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam, complete with a decent amount of etch-style lacing. The nose comprises plenty o' pine, grapefruit, honeydew, and rich toffee. The taste dilutes the pine up front in a wash of grapefruit, followed by a nice smattering of toffee, but then, in the finish, the pine returns for some always-enjoyed vengeance. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty dry and crisp finish. Overall, a very nice, easy-drinkin' IPA. Get some!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,billab914,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Surly shaped pint glass. Poured an amber/gold color wit ha frothy white head filling the top inch of the glass. Pretty good head retention to it and it also left some nice lacing on the glass as I drank it.  The aroma is not surprisingly hoppy. It's floral with a good amount of pine and citrus coming through. Some notes of grapefruit and orange come through in the citrus flavors. A little bit of earthy spice comes through in the hops as well.  The taste has a big grapefruit, pine, citrus, hoppiness to it. More of a dry bitterness starts to come through in the finish with more pine and grapefruit. It has a bit of an earthy spice to it as well as a bit of malt sweetness coming through. Very nice IPA overall.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it's a very well made and flavorful beer. it has a very nice and bright hoppiness to it that is very nice. All that said, for my personal taste I slightly prefer more of the tropical hoppy flavors in an IPA. That doesn't diminish how well made this beer is though at all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Luk13,4.02,"Bottle. Gold pour with ivory white head. Aroma is heavy pine, a whole coniferous forest's worth. Some sweetness too slightly citrusy or some pineapple. Taste is definately piney and grapefruit with an extra bitter finish. Good sparkling mouthfeel with a bitter dry taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,droomyster,4.32,"Pours a cloudy dark gold/light amber with a nice white head. Lively aromas of citrusy hops and caramel malts. On the palate this beer becomes positively electric. Lots of orange citrus and (to a lesser extent) pine resin jump right out in front and later linger long on the finish. In between these hop bursts, the mid palate is noticeably sweeter, with honey and caramel flavors. I pick up some floral and grassy notes as it warms. Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation; a definite palate cleanser that will stand up to any food under the sun and is a pleasure to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IronLover,4.38,"Deep yellow in color with a hint of orange and a touch of haze. Decent white head that reduces to a healthy white cap and leaves a trail of sticky lacings on the glass. Soft floral aroma with hints of orange and a faint hint of pine. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a crisp finish. Like the aroma, floral hoppy flavor with orange in the beginning, a brief sweet malty taste, and a hint of pine at the finish. Nice clean finish that raises the drinkability points as you have a hard time keeping the glass down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,argock,3.88,"A nice treat on-tap and it went well with my Thai chicken curry with its floral, citrus and spicy hoppiness and robust pale and light caramel malt backbone.

147,88,MbpBugeye,4,"Best by 09/08/10. I guess the freshness is pretty good for grabbing it at Giant Eagle.  A- A more yellow take on an IPA than many others. This beer is only moderately clouded by chill haze. A nice, big white head rises up and holds. Lacing is quite intense.  S- Nice and strong smelling. I am catching little wafts of oranges as it sits next to me on the desk. A closer inspection reveals a nice floral note going on. Nice strong pine that is very west-coast/Stone. A nice classic, fresh, hoppy smell.  T- Not too bitter, but slightly more bitter than most other breweries' year round IPA. Mostly pine but there is a lot of orange and grapefruit.  This beer does live up to how good everyone says it is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lacing is also excellent. 5  S: Very floral dominated smell as well as a sweet fruit, like an apple... a pungent smell of hops was also present. 4  T: Floral, oak, and herbal flavors. Some malty sweetness. I am not a huge fan of the hop choice, they very seem pungent to me. 3.5  M: Nice smooth character, does not seem like there is too much carbonation present. Good solid body. 4  D: The only complaint I have about this beer is the hops. They seem much too herbal to me. Like one of my mom's homoeopathic concoctions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,animalchin,4.25,"A - Definitive body and color of solid light copper with insane amounts of sporadic, yet dense lacing all around the glass.  S - Very earthy, grassy hop aromas that team up with some malt and a clear pungent bitterness. Excellent.  T - Hot damn. Obviously plentiful in the hop category - but with it comes a crisp, citrus and herbal quality that pleasantly lingers on the tongue and palate. As with the smell - a very grassy taste goes along, but this is a good complement to accentuate the earth-like tones that distinguish this IPA from many others.  M - Very aggressive action on the tongue, but nothing out of the IPA ordinary.  One of the best IPA's I've had. Been wanting to try this for such a long time. Stone does not lie when they say that they like to go big with their beers. They don't hold back anything, yet they don't over-do it either.  Any IPA fan will not be upset by this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Citrus at the front of it all. Grapefruit and pine hops mixed in as well. A very solid IPA. Not the best I've tasted but a very good hoppy IPA.  M- Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Nice bitterness to it.  D- Very solid beer from Stone. Wouldn't expect anything less from them.

S- piney citrusy hops dominate the nose i get a faint smell of malt in the background but not much. Pretty subdued to me  T- For a beer with such a quiet nose the taste is quite a smack in the face! Great taste of hops n malt intermingling , all the classic IPA taste with a great malt foundation. Im tasting mostly grapefruit and brown bread baked to perfection M- smooth oily slightly watery but I cant complain D- Perfectly sessionable .

S-a light bready malt lies up front with toasted grain in the middle. the hops take over with pine and citrus, notes of grapefruit, pear and appricot.  T-a lot of the same, extremely well balanced as the flavors seem to meld together in harmony, the malt base flashes quickly in the front with bready and caramel and compliments the piney hops towards the back. the toasted grain is behind the malt and adds an earthy quality that adds complexity and balance to the herbal hop presence. The citrus hops are juicy adding grapefruit, appricot, and mango. there is a moderate lingering bitterness that rolls down the back of the tongue. very well done!  M-light body, clean and crisp with a well done carbonation, juicy on the tongue and crisp in the finish.

A creamy/frothy, one inch bright white head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap with some thick swaths and strands of lacing adhering to the sides of the glass. Nose reveals grapefruit and resinous hops notes with a trace of caramel or toffee in the background. Flavor profile is very well balanced - some citrus astringency at the start, a little bitterness at the middle and towards the back (not as piny as suggested by the nose) and a light biscuity presence. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation that falls shy of prickly but leaves a residual tingle on the tongue after each quaff. Astringency lightly stimulates the salivary glands. A very solid and drinkable IPA with great balance. Doesn't overly assert itself in one direction which greatly accentuates the drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OttoBomb,3.61,"12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head signature glass (August 16, 2010). ""Enjoy by 10-13-10"" is printed on the rear of the bottle, so this just about two months shy of the freshness date.  Eyes: A very pretty looking beer. Gold-amber in color with decent haze. A nice white colored head erupts under a vigorous pour. Lacing is significant.  Nose: Strong hops, pine, not overly complex.  Tongue: Damn this is bitter. Surprisingly heavy on bitterness and surprisingly light on flavor. I expected a rich flavor profile, but this is dominated by bitterness. Malt is sparing. West Coast IPA for sure.  Mouth: The sharp metallic bitterness leaves it's impression on every sip. Carbonation is good, but doesn't cut through bitterness.  Libation: I like this beer, but frankly I expected a whole lot more based upon reputation. It's a bitter IPA, I get that, but I'm just not getting the complexity that warrants the bitterness. I think there are better options out there in terms of delivering an interesting/complex flavor profile, which this doesn't.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AlCaponeJunior,4.45,"My first taste of the stone brewery came on vacation in TX. It remains one of my favorite IPAs, and one of the best values available anywhere.  This IPA was a single 22oz bottle, poured into a 16oz wide top beer glass.  Poured typically IPA-ish in color, golden tan and slightly cloudly. The head was very thick and lasting with tons of lacing. Super-fine bubbles could be seen rising upon close inspection. A very fine looking IPA.  Smells of bitter hops and pine forest. There's an indistinct but detectable sweetness. Very pleasant but not that strong.  Tastes very, very good, and within the IPA style it's definitely a standout. I haven't enjoyed an IPA like this since I reviewed Smokestack's double-wide IPA. A complex set of flavors includes pine trees, grapefruit citrus, a complex hops profile, a nice spiciness, and a light sweetness.  Feels very nice. Mildly bitter, especially for an IPA. Aftertaste lingers slightly between sweet and bitter.  Drinks very highly for the style, and indeed for any style.  Stone remains one of the best breweries anywhere, IMO. Every beer I've had from this brewery is great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JLeege,4.15,"Appearance- golden in color, small white head from a fairly aggressive pour, crystal clear. good lacing  Smell- hoppy pine, some wood, citrus, NICE  Taste- some sweet malt up front followed by a splash of citrus, and a nice dry hoppy pine finish.  Mouthfeel- pretty light, highly carbonated, could be a bit thicker.  Overall- this is your classic west coast ipa. not unbalanced but definitly hop forward. hops are not overwelming but stick around just long enough to keep you going back for more!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TenHornsProud,4.47,"A flash of white through the blinds, and I know it's time to start the day. Again: shirt, pants, shoes, belt. It's too damned hot to be wearing this in the Texas heat. ""That's why we have A/C at 73 in the office."" Yeah well, try telling that to my car's busted A/C. Maybe they should meet up, spawn a new, working A/C for me to pitch (home brew pun) in the car.  I want to walk in the office and scream like Maldoror, curse my boss and the rest of the knee-jerk jackoffs who are laying me off. I want to ""restructure"" their bones.  Instead, clothes now on, I reach into the fridge and plunk down a Stone IPA. And at this moment, I feel like the gargoyle on the front really gets me, really agrees with my Maldoror impulses.  It pours a nice copper color with white, foamy head. I can smell the hops from the table and as it gets closer, I notice its fruit, citrus companions.  My brain says, ""Yep, yep,"" and down goes the first gulp at 7:30 a.m. The taste is hop bitterness balanced in a way that only Stone seems to pull off so regularly.  It is thick and has a nice body without being syrup. The finish is fantastic, and I can't stop drinking it. I could drink this all day, but alas I have to go in to work, for at least a few more days before they finally hand me the exit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jwinship83,4.23,"12oz bottle purchased shortly after stone invaded chicago. the bottle date was current when i drank it (a while ago). found notes for this review recently. drank from a stone brewing pint glass.  A- this one pours out a translucent pale copper colored body with a rather large and fluffy white head on top. the head lasts for a while, and leaves behind solid rings of lacing. very nice.  S- being a stone product, the blast of hops i get when i place my nose near the glass is expected. lots of grapefruit and lots of pine. what is also expected is that the malts take a distant back seat here. a small amount of caramel comes through.  T- a small amount of semisweet caramel malts start this one out but are quickly overpowered by a solid blast of hops. tons of pine and citric (grapefruit) flavor.  M- a little lighter than i would have expected or liked. the carbonation is somewhat high. it does leave a nice bitter and dry aftertaste.  D- its a toss up between this and two hearted for my go to IPA. i usually settle for whatever one is on sale. sometimes with green flash's west coast IPA. glad this one made it here. also glad they list the freshness information on the bottle. every IPA should have that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,UncleRicoII,4.85,Grabbed on a whim in my never-ending search for a better American IPA.  Appearance is light amber to caramel colored. Head forms to medium height of off-white color and retreats nicely leaving its fingerprint behind.  Aroma jumps into your nose as a citrus pine combo and sets the taste buds off in wanting their turn to enjoy the party.  Taste starts off like an above average IPA but quickly shift to a great hop taste served up with a citrus exclamation point.  After-taste is pleasant and sets the stage nicely for your next sip.  Highly recommend this IPA as the Gargoyle emblem has definitely protected the hops from evil spirits that can ruin a good beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,jsprain1,4.15,"A- Pours a clear golden, verging on light amber. with a 1.5 finger head that has decent retention and extremely sticky lacing. S- An aggressive hoppy aroma, with pine scents and fruit smells also permeating. a faint bit of alcohol aroma and just enough malt aroma to prove its existence. T- Very hoppy opening, herbal and coniferic. Hits the tongue hard, but gently subsides with some malt balance and a bit of breadiness before it finishes with a drying hop flavor. The breadiness seemed a bit strange sandwiched between the hop flavors but it wasn't overly distracting. M- Smooth and creamy before the drying hop finish sets in. Full body for the style. D- Top notch drinkability. One doesn't even notive that it's 6.9% until he reads the bottle. An excellently crafted and flavorful ipa.  Edited 7/17/11: Doesn't quite pack the same hop punch for me now that it used to. Still hoppy and flavorful, but the alcohol seems more prominant to me now than it did the last time I had it, thus had to lower scores a little bit. Scores changed to reflect updates.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kagent777,4.1,"12 oz bottle obtained during travels to S. Lake Tahoe.  Poured into a goblet. One finger wide head settles to a thin film over a hazy light golden beer.  Smell: Light solvent alcohol, pine, and citrus. My nose is not good enough yet to distinguish which ones. Not as potent as the ruination I had a few days ago.  Taste: Just as an IPA should be, this one is hoppy but also balanced with the malts. The balance is very good. The finish is longish with the carbonation perfect, not too fizzy  Mouthfeel: This one is probably a great example of how an IPA should feel.  Drinkability: If I could get these on a regular basis, I would. This is a very good IPA.  Review #2",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,silentjay,4.12,"pretty standard looking IPA, somewhat hazy orange copper with an almost white head. not quite as big a head as I would have expected, but it retains and laces pretty well.  aroma is very hoppy. pine, tropical fruit, citrus, grass. backed up a bit by some light malts.  bitter and fruity taste. grapefruit is more apparent in the flavor than the aroma, pine gives way to plenty of tropical fruit and citrus peel. malt is just noticable. a bit of a peppery spice comes through and lingers along with the bitterness for a while.  mouthfeel is very good. medium bodied with tons of carbonation and some good hop resin left on the bitter and spicy finish.  drinks rather well. You have to have a decent hop tolerance to enjoy this one, but if you do it will satisfy your hop fix very easily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,EgadBananas,4.12,"I've had this many times before, never took the time to review...why not now?!  Golden straw in color, 2.5 finger stark white head, with loads of tiny bubbles. Laces the entire glass.  Smells very bitter, floral and woodsy. It's very good and aromatic, but not extremely in your face.  Taste is an initial bitter punch in the face, fading to some very slight malts in the background. Bitterness much more pronounced than in the nose. Beautiful.  Feel is lighter, crisp, and clean.  Got a sixer, it's Friday, and I'll definitely easily drink a few.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The sent has a bite to it (smells promising)  T- very simple strong taste. You will taste hops. There is a slight taste of citrus but its all about the hops. It bites at the end and overall has a good taste. It's not the best IPA I've had but it's up there.  M- medium carbonation, medium body, nice bite at the end.  D- Not too expensive when compared to other beers in its class. Its an enjoyable drink but probably not one you have more than one or two of. Overall a solid IPA but not quite the best.

S: Strong presence of pine and citrus hops, with a certain sweetness. Smells tasty.  T: Very underwhelming. Not much hop bitterness, but the pine taste is very upfront. There are also great notes of juicy citrus-grapefruit flavors that saves it. Enjoyable to a degree.  M: Medium body, decent carbonation, but not as smooth as I would prefer.  D: I've had this on tap and in bottle several times, trying to get into this beer, with all the hype around it. I've been disappointed every time. I doubt it's a freshness problem (having it fresh out of a new keg), I am trying to like this, but there are too many other good IPAs out there to give it another chance.

Taste - Pleasantly dry and bitter with intense hops that tend towards a pine-grapefruit flavor. Enough malt to balance the taste although definitely leans towards the hops. Finishes well with a clean aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium body.  Drinkability - Surprisingly easy to drink and a great beer for an introduction to IPAs.

147,88,LacquerHead,3.85,"Poured a very hazy straw color and had a very foamy head that clung to the sides of the glass. Poured this into a tall Pilsner glass.  The aroma was reminiscent of a pine forest. It also had some citrus grapefruit.  Like the aroma, the taste was a mix of pine and grapefruit. It was dry and the bitterness was just right. The sweetness was in the middle. It also had a mossy taste to it. Overall the components were all there and were well put together, but I didn't think this was an aggressively hoppy beer.  It had a decent drinkability. I thought it tasted best on the colder side, it didn't really taste that great as it got warmer. It had a dry aftertaste.  I do not understand all the A ratings. This was worth the price and I would buy this again. However, this seemed like a fairly standard, yet solid, IPA.

D- Very easy to drink, but too light for me to give a higher score, wish I could for Greg but just seems lacking  Revisited out of the bottle...

Some light malt and yeast notes in the background.  MF- Light body with smooth carbonation and a fair amount of bitterness. A nice long hoppy aftertaste.

147,88,Walken,4.5,"Stone: IPA (Bottled 06/03/10) (Tasted 07/28/10) 22 oz. bottle, poured into a cervoise goblet.  Appearance: Hop hazed, dark golden ale with a big, bubbly, frothy head o' foam that does not want to die, it leaves marks of its former glory all over the edges of the glass. Odor: Anything but average. Much more herbal, spicy and floral, in that order, with a subtle citric fruitiness, hints of toasted white bread in the way-back. Consistency: Medium body, cracker and bread malty dryness, lush, medium-high carbonation. Taste: Low-riding toasted whole-grain bread maltiness and the kind of brutal, herbal bitter hop flavor that only Chinook can deliver. Riding low in the background, is a vaguely citric fruity hop flavor and some nips of warming alcohol. The beer finishes bone dry, very crisp and extremely hoppy, with a lingering, bitter, herbal flavor.  Great IPA in its own class, more aggressively bitter than most with a decidedly more herbal/floral profile.

This is no doubt the look of a west coast IPA  S- an amazing combo of citrus like hops and a floral body. There is a sweet profile that is built with bitterness.

Color: if you're into it, it's a nice slightly hazy golden color.  Odor: Very clean, nice fruity hop aroma; slightly sweet body.  Taste: Even bodied fruity hops; fairly light in bitterness; doesn't pull you in different directions of hop flavor like the Ruination does. Slightly sweet body with dry finish. No real aftertaste other than the hops.  I like it. Great summer beer being crisp, not overly sweet or bitter.  I would like to try it with spicy Mexican Food, especially Ceviche.

147,88,Bravo4,4.32,Poured from the bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A- It pours a hazy golden color with not much head that dissipates fast and leaves a little lacing. The head has a grainy texture that I have found typical of most IPA's.  S- It has a floral hops aroma accented by a little citrus that reminds me of grapefruit. It's not very strong but it's not weak either.  T- It has a nice hoppy taste to it with a little malt and citrus in the middle and finishes with that typical IPA hop bitterness. The bitterness isn't too agressive but it isn't weak either. I would describe it as well balanced.  M- The carbonation level seems slightly high but it doesn't detract from the feel. It's pretty smooth and almost has a creamy finish.  D- This beer is pretty drinkable if you like IPA's and would make a good session beer for IPA fans. Overall this beer is a classic IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FeloniousDrunk,4.22,"This beer pours clear and golden with a stout 2 finger ecru head.  The smell is mostly of hops, but has a good piney/floral aroma.  This beer is a good, well-rounded IPA with ample hops flavor, and some strong floral notes. The flavors of resin and flowers about with a nice hop-forward character that leaves the mouth a tad dry, but not overwhelmingly so. This is a great example of an IPA that uses enough hops to be bitter and dry AND give it a good hop characteristic without being too strong and un-sessionable.  The drinkability is key for this beer, as I could have myself a lot in one session and not feel bowled-over by it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DovaliHops,4.18,"Pours a cloudy, straw-orange color with somewhat large white head. Extremely hoppy aroma with a bit of sweet malts. Very strong citrusy notes (orange, grapefruit, lemon). The taste is very well balanced. Up front you get great citrus hoppiness, followed by sweet citrus fruits. Then it ends with bittering hops. Very lovely taste. The mouthfeel is almost perfect for an IPA. The drinkability is very high for this 7% gem.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,detlefchef,4.65,"Pretty golden-orange color, like that of a sungold tomato. Pours a pure white head that breaks quickly. Pretty apparent aromas of mango and citrus with an almost vinous lingering aroma. Actually, smells not entirely unlike a funkier white burgundy. Maybe one with some age on it or from a particularly ripe year.  Taste-wise, it is pleasant if not remarkable. Mind you, I don't mean that in a bad way, rather that it tastes like it should. Nor particularly boozy or aggressively bitter. Just balanced and pleasant. Odd that should come off as a nearly back-handed compliment, but it does prevent it from getting a perfect 5 in that category. Nice, crisp finish though with hints of tangerine.  Really fine texture and outstanding drinkability.  All in all, certainly a benchmark. Enough exotic aromas to make it stand out and everything else certainly does it's part. A fine brew indeed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bourbonbock,4.27,Poured this 22 oz bomber bottle into a clean pub glass. As soon as the cap cracked a pleasant aroma of hops was released.  A. Clear yet not golden copper in color with a smooth white head of 1-2 fingers that receded into a lid of foam after a few minutes.  S. This beer smells fantastic from the first moment it is opened. It smells of citrus and perhaps a slight smell of grassiness.  T. Complex flavor starting with a slightly bitter bite followed by a frothy malt profile and finishes with a crisp floral character. The aftertaste sticks around for a while and leaves a hoppy resin near the throat.  M. Although it doesn't seem that carbonated it is apparent after the initial flavor. It is a smooth beer with an oily aftertaste.  D. I could definitely have a couple of these after a long day at work and fall asleep nicely. A little strong to be a session beer but not a bad choice to keep one or two (22's) in the fridge.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Head settles to a small ring and some gorgeous sticky lace.  S- crisp citrus with grapefruit and lemon some pine sap and cut grass. Very mild malt sweetness.  T- big hops up front with the citrus and pine. Mild bitterness that is balanced out by the simple malt profile. Hint of grass and honey.  M- mid to lite body and mid carb. Semi dry.  D- lowish abv and tons of flavor makes for a great beer. I tend to over look this one for bigger newer thing but this.

147,88,mcnkuckles,3.57,"A good solid IPA from stone, but wants to grow up to be the Runition IPA, as this is a far superior IPA from the same company, and worth every penny! The regular Stone IPA has an average amount of hoppiness/bittering, but not overwhelming. Consistency is very light, and the flavors will not blow you away.

Finish is crisp, dry, with some lingering vegetal flavor.  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body, moderate 'fluffy' carbonation. Dry in the finish. Overall, not bad.  Drinkability -- This is the Stone offering that I have passed on over and over. While it didn't fully live up to my expectations, I am still glad I went with this.

D- I'm slow getting more and more into the hoppy beers , def. Put a sixer down, if you like beer , then bottoms up.  This seems like a corner stone of an IPA, this is what I think of when I think of an IPA. It doesn't totally blow me away, but it what a good IPA should be. If your looking for something more left of center, then I'd probably find something else. But if your looking for what an IPA is all about this is a good beer to start with. If I had any critique of the beer it would be , its very , two dimensional, there isn't so many little things going on with this beer. Hops and malt. It a nice, bold, straightforward IPA, maybe explore more into the depth of flavor. Why fix something that isn't broke.

147,88,Shakesbeere,4.1,"Golden pour with an initially thick head. Smells strongly of cascade and floral hops and sweet citrus grapefruit. Taste is initially of bitter hops with some lighter flower tones. It then morphs into a citrus grapefruit flavor. The final stage is a cascading plunge of bitterness culminating in a wave of intense hops in the aftertaste. Palate is somewhat thick and syrupy. A very excellent IPA. As Ludwig Wittgenstein once said, ""I turn to stone"" -- now who could deny the taste continues?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Appearance: Slightly hazy golden-orange color with a fairly large white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a heavy lace behind.  Smell: Biscuity malt aromas, with lots of hops- some floral nots along with pine and a bit of earthiness.  Taste: Buttered biscuit flavors up front, with sharp bitter and grassy/flowery hop flavors in the finish. There's also a nice sweetness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with balanced carbonation and a sticky, slightly finish.  Drinkabiliuty: Being from Stone, I expected this to be an assault of hops. However, this is hoppy but also has a very pleasant, balancing malt character. A great IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Arbitrator,4.03,"Re-review. I last approached this in February 2009. Time to try again.  Chilled bottle into a glass.  A: A hazy copper-gold color that scatters all light. Has lazy carbonation wafting up and forming a 1 finger head, which recedes into a thick film on the glass. The lacing is amazing: thick, sticky sheets all the way down. My only ding is for the lack of clarity.  S: A little weak, but agitation solves that problem. Grapefruit, grass, and floral hops. Some tart lemon, and a mild nose of caramel and biscuit.  T: Grapefruit and floral hops dominate the taste, as in the smell. Lemon tart is stronger in the mouth than it is on the nose. Caramel malt provides a lightly sweet backbone to accentuate the bitterness of the hops, with a general biscuit sweetness noticed throughout. The finish is bitter and grassy, but it's not very sticky.  M: Medium-bodied, with medium carbonation. The finish is quite clean, which I appreciate in an IPA (I think I am in the minority on that).  D: Very drinkable. This is a great beer to get a sixer of; it's priced reasonably for the quality, and I can stop at one bottle if I choose. Definitely on regular rotation in my fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Shuffledaddy,4.77,"One fateful night I had this beer at Yard House. From the moment I saw it, with its golden color and ample head, it seemed like a special brew. I took a whiff, and noticed scents of pine, pineapple, and grapefruit. Upon tasting, I discovered a beautiful hop bouquet colored with shades of pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, pine nuts, and peach. The hop bitterness was quite pleasant and intense without becoming acerbic, as many IPAs do. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, even syrupy but not too much so. As far as drinkability, I felt like I could pound a few more, but I had to drive :). I let my friend have a taste, and he thought it was very good even though he doesn't care for IPAs.  Overall, I'd say this is the gold standard in American IPAs. Hoppy as hell, but in the nicest way possible. A must have for all the hopheads out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerFMAndy,4,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 6.9% ABV, Keep Refrigerated, no date.  A - Hazy golden yellow beer flows from the bottle freely resulting in a plump and well-retained three-finger white head. Chunky lace coats the glass. Beautiful.  S - Monstrously bitter smelling hops assault the nose with citrusy American hops backed by floral notes. Malts fall to the background but still provide good support for the dangerous hop level.  T - Balanced hops are key in this beer. A good level of citrus, mostly lemon-like, and floral notes play well with the caramel-sweet malty base rather than completely engulfing it.  M - Medium in body and smooth with a pretty persistent bitterness on the finish. The balance is good here.  D - Fairly easily drinkable based on what I've heard about the bitterness. It makes me wonder how old this bottle is. Regardless, Stone's IPA blends potent hops with a good malty backbone well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,TheSevenDuffs,4.3,"On tap at Cole's in Buffalo. Served in a pint glass.  A - A medium yellow with hint of amber. Small amount of creamy white head.  S - Bitter citrus hops dominate the nose. Not much else here.  T - My pint was like a tale of 2 beers. The first half was just hops - mostly citrus with some piney notes and very bitter with next to no malt profile at all. Dry, bitter finish  About half way through this all of the sudden started to sweeten up. There was some sweet caramel malt flavour to balance out the bitter hops, especially those on the finish. I really enjoyed the second half of my pint.  M - Light to medium body. Lightly carbonated.  D - A good IPA but not a favourite. I really want to try this one again because the second half of my pint was very, very good but the first half was too bitter.

I'm sorry, it will never happen again. Hugs and kisses on all your gargoyles.  I love Stone IPA and I'm not afraid to say it.  Clear gold with a thick, meaty head. Good retention leaves a foamy schmear all down mine glass.  Aroma is sharp pine and citrus hop. Sugar coated pineapple pieces and peach rings. There's a light cracker malt foundation underneath, toiling in near obscurity.  Searing and just barely palatable grapefruit pith bitterness. Just enough bready malt to give hops purchase.

A few patches stick to the glass as I down this delicious hop nectar. Smell is a touch piney, but more grassy / earthy / peppery - to me, at least. There are some floral notes in there, too. Taste is more citrusy, with grapefruit rind being pretty noticeable - there is some piney-ness, too. Caramel malt is there, but this beer is definitely hop-forward. Mouthfeel is just about perfect to me. It could use a little more body, but that might deter it from being so drinkable. The finish is crisp, clean and refreshing.

Most IPA's are pungent with a rank quality. Stone's has an elegant but muscly aroma that's quite pleasing.  Taste: Intense bitter hop character. Rounded herbal and spice notes. A hint of fruitiness in the middle. Grain and hop leaf flavor in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and very slick and oily. Carbonation pops nicely.  Harmony: A beer for hopheads.

You're expecting to be hit with a bitterness you have never experienced before and then, WHAM! One of the most subtle and well balanced IPA's you will ever have. You get all the hops, all the power, all of the might that Stone is known for in a solid-forceful, yet kind and soft nurtuing flavor. Kind like being rocked to sleep (in a good way) by its mascot.

147,88,Boxus,4.5,"This is sort of an archetypal IPA. It's a good introduction to the style, and a reliable mainstay, especially in the small towns in southern California where many of the good beers that you can easily locate come from San Diego (i like the Green Flash IPA even more, though it's not as drinkable/popular).  It pours a rich gold color with a light fruity aroma. A small head lingers with nice light lacing. It looks and tastes exactly like an IPA should. Robust and tangy and heavily hopped, but light enough to be refreshing and drinkable, even on a very hot summer day. This is an ideal summer beer for me - in the winter I get really into stouts, but in the summer I tend to go for IPA's. And this one has a flavorful hoppiness and crisp smooth aftertaste that make it consistently satisfying on these lazy sun-drenched days.

147,88,bohemiandonut,3.62,"... Edit: I continue to have varying experiences with this beer. This take was supposed to be a score-bolstering edit, but I'm left conflicted still. From a bomber to a snifter, just can't get it how it be on tap. Is this the beginning of my notepad-slinging career? No. No it is not.  Yields a slippery, seafoam head that lasts, above a rather pale, almost blonde amber sea. Minimal lacing. ... True. In fact the head is generous at first but settles to a soapy ceiling.  Rather passive aromas here. Subdued presence of grapefruit rind amid caramelly malts. ... Somewhat true. This fresher bottle seems a bit more active in the tropical department, and more aromatic as well. ... Taste is more 1-dimensional than the scent, either that or is highly dominated by a strong hop presence, which in this case leaves little room for breadth. Regardless, each sip yields deeper layers of minty/piney/grapefruit freshness. A knockout for the tastebuds. Definitely not heavy on the malts, but perhaps a bit much in terms of oily hop mouthfeel, at least for me.  This is a decent IPA, no doubt, but I find it lacking in the character department. A little too well-rounded, you might say. There is however a distinct aftertaste of Samuel Adams' Boston Lager, which I personally enjoy. ... Almost agree with this, but I think what I meant to say is the boys go for Xtreme bitterness here with little regard for breadth beyond a noticeable malt platform. Where is the airy, heavenly hop-stream of Pliny and Sculpin? Not here. Too bitter.  Regardless, I count this among my favorite IPA's for the mysterious fact that I can ""feel"" this beer after only a few sips! There must be some elusive yeast club of strains with this ABV-defying effect. Drunkable. ... lol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,washingtonydc,4.02,"Reviewing a Stone brew may be like declaring your love for puppies--not many people fall on the opposing side, so it's mostly convincing others of how right-on their opinions already are. But with that said, let me join the echo chamber and tell you what you probably already know.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, it's a hazy, dark straw color with about two fingers of frothy head and some of the most exquisite lacing I've seen this side of Brugges. It gives off a wet, spicy grapefruit aroma--what I imagine a shift-worker at the Dole cannery comes home smelling like. The taste is of bright, floral and citrus hops, but finishes with a subtle, sweet malty lingering. The big draw of this beer, though, is just how juicy it is--the hops just seem to burst in your mouth, which combines nicely with the refreshing, wet, medium-bodied beer. It's a big IPA, as you'd expect from Stone, but it's rather enjoyable and sessionable.  So, yes, this Stone IPA is an amazing, exemplary beer.

The appearance is nice, and the smell is very floral and complex with plenty of dry hopping. Unlike the aforementioned IPAs, though, there's no notable malt sweetness, perhaps just enough to make the beer palatable (but not enjoyable).

Taste is a quality hoppy bitterness right up front and all the way through, nice underlying notes of bready malts and yeast. This beer is quite thick for a regular IPA, definitely not a session beer in my book but nonetheless light and crisp enough to be refreshing. This is pretty much what I'd expect from Stone for an American IPA--a beer that tilts full throttle for the style on the flavor scale.  I'm more ambivalent about Stone than most of the BA reviewers, I think, I'm not necessarily a fan of overpowering beers but in the case of an IPA, I enjoy and appreciate it provided that it isn't oversweetened and overmalted as well. This beer is not, it's a bit thick for a regular IPA in my opinion but the quality of the ingredients come through and the balance is proper for an IPA.

I have had better, have had worse. Mouth is pretty full for the style, helps carry the hops well. Overall, a good, solid IPA. There are better IPAs to be had for less money, but sometimes Stone's signature flavors just hit the spot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jlapennas,4.21,"Aroma: Moderately high American hop aroma, pungent, piney, a little bit dank, with some fruitiness - fruit salad?. Hops are backed by a bit of alcohol and a small amount of sweetness that blends in nicely with the hop aromas. The aroma is not super complex compared to some contemporary IPA's that use multiple hop varieties but it's classic, and classy, in the best sense of the word. No obvious malt character in the nose. Hops lack that really fresh element you sometimes find on draft or in really new bottles but that's to be expected.  Appearance: Wonderful deep gold color makes me believe the beer with not have too much sweetness or specialty malt character. Head is thick and shows excellent retention. Totally the way an IPA should look.  Flavor: Spicy, resin, very firm bitterness, especially on the first few sips. Base malt flavor evident with little bit of caramel type sweetness. Alcohol is evident in the back of the throat. I get the sense that there is a little bit of sweetness here but the bitterness and resin really mask it. For an IPA, the resin isn't especially high but the bitterness makes up for it lending a crisp drying character to the finish. Again I've had more complex IPA's but this is spot on.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and rich but still highly drinkable. Slightly dextrinous. Supports hop bitterness well. Alcohol is evident as is resin but both are appropriate for this style of beer.  Overall: I love it! Had this many times and it's always good, even in the bottle. Stone does a really nice job with their QC - this is even a few weeks past the best buy date. Compared to other top shelf American IPA's this is fairly bold but quite balanced. It shows a lot of hop character without getting into the grassy, vegetal, harsh resin realm that some approach. Some that push the envelope a bit more are more tasty and complex but this is extremely enjoyable and great drinking. Wonderful balance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,garuda,3.93,"Slightly hazy orange color with a thick white head that has good retention and also good lacing down the glass.  S - All hops with fresh pungent pine resin up front, then some citrus notes of grapefruit and orange. As it warms, an assertive smell of black pepper, grassy scents come forth.  T - I found it a little less complex from the smell, but still good with toasted malt sweetness up front, with big grapefruit zest bitterness through the finish.  M - Light body, good elevated carbonation level emphasizes hop character. Sticky mouthfeel from all the hop oils.  D - Another one of a kind, big, bold Stone brew. The grassy/black pepper notes I was getting from the smell really keeps me from drinking too much of this at any one time, although it was mighty tasty and surprisingly complex.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigfnjoe,3.47,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A- pours a dark golden, almost orange with a one finger crisp white head. Doesn't really look like most IPAs...but it looks nice. Love the color of the head. Laces beautifully and gets an extra half point for that.  S- faint...getting a lot of orangey hops. But you know what...it actually smells really, really good.  T- very bitter. In fact...all I'm really getting is bitterness. Pine, pine and more pine...getting some very vague hints of grapefruit, but thats all. Disappointing.  M- feel is...interesting. Its got a thickness to it. If you look at the color and think its going to be light and thin, you're not going to get that.  D- I'm not really sure about this...I've had IPAs I've enjoyed more, and because of how bitter this is, I'm not sure if I'd come back to it. I don't get many flavors aside from the pine, and its a huge turnoff to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,deleted_user_357747,3.63,"A- Aggressive pouring leaves an enormous 2-finger head on this brew. It's bubbly, rocky, very light tan and sticky and resiny looking with the tiniest rainbow sheen. Color is a very pretty hazy orange color, bright and colorful. Very good looking beer. Too cloudy to really see any carbonation.  S- Fruity and a little aggressive. Hoppiness, backed with a layered sweetness. Not only fruit, but florals, pine and herbs. Lacking serious depth, but still very nice.  T- Starts out biting with hops, mellows out to a nice balanced pale ale flavor and finishes on almost a licorice taste and strong bitterness. Very hoppy without a lot of counterbalance. It's good, but not my cup of tea. I'm already getting heartburn from the resiny hops cones.  M- This is where this brew shines. This beer almost floats on the palette, it's so smooth and lighter. Dead on carbonation. Perfect feel here.  D- Too hopped out for my tastes, can't even finish one of these bad boys. I might revisit and finish one to get the full Stone IPA experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Finishes with a lingering piney bitterness. Solid flavor profile.  M - spot on mouth feel. Enough carbonation without being overwhelming, medium body with a hint of stickiness that I enjoy in my IPA's.  D - Pretty easy drinking IPA.

S: Piney goodness. Bright hop aroma abounds.  T: A little spicy up front. Slightly vegetal. Some fresh pine. Finishes with juicy grapefruit, tangerine, and valencia orange. Delicious.  M: Prickly carbonation. Slightly slick mouthfeel.  D: I find this beer to be pretty drinkable, but it is very bitter, so 1 or 2 may fatigue some palates.  Just finished a HopDevil prior to this and I have to say this was a great exercise in how different (but still delicious) American IPA's can be. If HopDevil is the quintessential East Coast IPA, then Stone is it's West Coast counterpart. Just as I said of HopDevil I'll say of Stone IPA, it's readily available and relatively affordable so if you haven't had it - what the hell are you waiting for?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pours a slightly hazy golden with a white, patchy, head. First whiff is pure IPA kindness, very pronounced hops on the nose. First taste is the same. The hops are the star, but let the other flavors act as good support. Pineapple, grapefruit, and sweet malts. Outstanding beer. Nicely balanced. Feel is nicely complex, creamy and smooth, but with a daggered hops edge. Doesn't finish as dry as I expected. High drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerBeatnik,3.26,"Looks, smells and tastes like an IPA. Nice beer. There are better out there. I liked it. I think if everyone tasted this blind -- without knowing who made it -- they might just find it a good competent IPA.

T - damn, i always forget how delicious this one is because its so readily available. intense citrus hops with some earthy grass and pine as the final kicker. malts are just there as a backbone for the hop attack. wonderfully ""balanced"" for a hop head. MORE.  M - medium bodied, carbonation is lively yet in control. leaves mouth feeling a bit sticky with hop resin, very clean and crisp.

Came in a pint glass, slightly cloudy and orange in colour, more orange than the amber body I was expecting, full white head at first, soon only a wisp and collar.  Very hoppy in aroma and taste, the citrus smells from the aroma hops disgiuised the bitterness that was to follow in the taste.  I quiet enjoyed the beer, the bitterness continued throughout the tasting, even the aftertaste was all hop and no hint of any malt content could i find anywhere within the brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jbowers56,4.67,"Wow I was excited to try this beer.  Looks good. Not great. A cloudy orangey yellow with a nice nearly white head that fades pretty quickly, but leaves ok lacing. Edit, must have had a less than perfect glass. This time it looks great, plenty of lacing, though the head does fade quickish so its a 4.5 not a 5.  Smells great. Infact, I cant fault it. Im going the 5. I get rich citrussy flavours, which are integrated superbly well with the caramelly notes from the malt. Grapefruit, pine, pineapple - its all there and wonderful.  For me, a perfectly balanced IPA. Bitterness is big, and doesnt make any apologies about it. However, it sits atop a very good malt backbone offering caramel-like sweetness to support the hop assault. The hop profile in the nose translates well. Could be perhaps a tiiiiny bit more hop flavour, which is why im giving it a 4.5 not a 5. That may be due to the journey it's been on though.  Feels exceptional in the mouth. Smooth, but doesnt stick around too long and the huge hop profile leaves that typical dryness on the walls of your mouth. This is the kind of beer that, for me, deserves an unreasonably high rating. It is pretty much everything I would want in an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This beer is very rich, and tastes more like an imperial IPA than just a regular one. It's hearty with a good sweet-bitter balance. Unfortunately not really what I'm usually looking for in an IPA--just a little too intense for casual drinking. It's a tasty ale, very indulgent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sweet malty smell and a piney/resin hop presence. Taste has sweet caramel malt with a pine hop bitterness. Huge abrasive bitterness. The hop oil really coats your mouth and teeth, leaving everything feeling dirty and gritty.  This has good carbonation, but overall, this just isn't my preferred take on an American IPA. There is really not a whole lot of ""taste"" or flavor to this, just huge bitterness. It feels like that was the intent though, so I'm not giving this a negative review.

147,88,Pittsburgh,4.15,"Bomber, poured into a pint glass, looks awesome, smells awesome as well, I am ready to try this beer. Bitter for an IPA, but the bitterness is welcome, I actually like this better than the ruination, because it is not over the top with bitterness.  Very hoppy, as I expected from a Stone IPA, hits you in the mouth, no disappointment here, most of the taste is the bitterness of the hops, I can catch a little sweetness as well, but I do feel the bitterness can be a little over-powering and mask other flavors in the beer. Maybe that is the intent. I have noticed I have had these a little after the drink before date, maybe they are not as fresh as they need to be, and something is getting lost. But I feel there is a lack of complexity in this beer that is lacking.  I do like the beer, definitely is a quality IPA that I will be drinking when I can, but I do feel some flavors are dominant and you are not able to taste other things in the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Natural510,4.45,"12oz bottle with a best-by date of 7/06/10 subtely stamped on the back.  A solid-gold color with amber tinge pours a frothy white head resembling melted ice cream. Sturdy, lasting carbonation.  Dry, leafy, herbal hop scent with an understated sugar-malt sweetness.  Flavor is smooth, herbal statement of hops. Very dry, earthy with only a hint of malt sweetness. Fairly light and quite refreshing on the palate. Not quite the puckering bitter, astringent effect you get from some IPAs, but instead a cleansing hoppiness which is dangerously drinkable.  Excellent alternative for those who tire of sweeter IPAs.

Lasting hop bitterness.  M - Silky smooth, soft carbonation, medium body.  D - This is a joy to drink. Very tasty, satisfying, and refreshing.  I actually like this better than Ruination.

Had to do some emergency sipping to prevent a spill over. My first impression of the smell left me very eager to take this encounter to the next level and take a gulp. I've heard so much great stuff about Stone products, so my expectations coming into this session are very high...but OMG, this stuff is sour. I might detect some clove, if so, that would explain this reaction I'm having. There is some citrus note struggling to present itself , but it keeps getting slammed back by the taste of turpentine and who knows what gawdawful spice that dominates. Either I got hold of a bad one, or we just have ""a failure to communicate"" going on here. I'll go back to drinking my Torpedos in ignorant bliss, I guess. In retrospect, the letter grade that this reviewer gives this brew is higher than my overall impression of what I just drank...the difference is how BA assigns value to aspects of the beer [like appearance]that do not count at the end of the day, but helped to jack up the score here. I would personally rate this beer a solid ""D-"" if all there was to consider was what I just drank.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I detect citrus, sweet bready flavor, a hint of a yeast characteristic, which is intriguing, since most ipas are super clean. This one is still clean, but has a little bit of estery flavor to it.

147,88,BobJustBob,4.88,"Poured from a bottle into a 16 Oz. dimpled mug. Where do I start?! From the immense delicious head and traditional strawberry blonde haze that typifies a classic IPA to the intense spicy hoppyness, this is one incredible American-style IPA. Probably the best one I've tried yet. The lacing is worth a note. It covers the whole glass, right to the bottom. One point I need to make about this Beer, is that it isn't Hopped to the point where the Malty character doesn't come through. It's there, sure enough and perfectly balances the brew. Although the ABV is fairly low, a few of these at the bar would still warrant a designated driver. It hits the brain like liquid Marijuana! Be advised and drink (ir)responsibly. (and I'm no light-weight.) This is a classic that nobody should go through a lifetime without trying. Essential!  ---Edit--- Every time I do an IPA tasting, this one still comes out on top. If there was a higher rating than an A+ I would give it to this Beer. The bottled version is astounding. On tap, it's enough to provoke spontaneous combustion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I really enjoy the herbal spiciness that protrudes and stays through the whole sip. There is still a nice sweetness here. Strong hop bitterness during the sip, and the aftertaste is quite bitter as well.  Mouthfeel: One thing I will never say about a Stone Brew is that it is not smooth, and this is no exception. Medium carbonation, but with a strong taste it drinks with a medium / full body.  Drinkability: West coast ultra hopped tastiness. Not for the faint of palette.

I must say that I wish I would have tried this first as I find it to be an excellent beer. I definitely enjoyed this beer more than the Stone Ruination IPA  This IPA looks as good as it drinks with a two plus finger head and a slightly cloudy amber color. The head had fair staying power although it retreated faster than I would have hoped. I seldom impart this to the beer but rather my glassware and dish washer. Lacing was good as well.  The smell was crisp, clean and not too strong. It had good hoppy floral notes.  The bitterness although good was definitely not overpowering making this a great everyday drinker. I really enjoyed this beer and I feel like this could be ideal in the heat of summer or by a fire in the depths of winter. One note is that there was a slight aftertaste that was not easy to identify, it almost creates a powdery feeling on the back of the tongue.  I would definitely recommend this beer to fellow craft brew fans and macro brew drinkers alike.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

M - great carbonation; very light in body but hops are still overwhelming.  D - Burned through the first two but slowed as the alcohol caught up to me.

147,88,BuckeyeOne,4.25,"Poured a nice amber with a fluffy white head that laced the glass well.  The aroma is grass and citrus with just the hint of grapefruit. No malt sweetness in the nose at all. I was expecting a hop blast in the nose that wasn't entirely there.  This is one bitter IPA. Tastes very much like a DIPA at first, especially when it's very cold. As it warms, a bit of malt biscuit flavor comes through, but not much. A fresh Stone IPA on tap is all citrus, pine, and earthy grass flavors. The aftertaste is very dry and bitter.  There is just the right amount of carbonation here to hold up the hop resin. As it warms, it becomes a bit more oily.  This is an IPA that I keep in my garage fridge when I find it reasonably priced. It's usually a little more than comparable IPAs. Regardless, it's very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gerardoguzmanh,4.57,"This is one of my favorite everyday beers. The smeel of hops is abundant with hints of herbs, and grapefruit, maybe some fresh cut grass. Taste has full NA hop flavor with a small malt trace. Undoubtly this beer is all about the bitterness. The aftertaste is quite persisting and a strong hop character lingers in the mouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dwilson01,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my ""Brewery Tours of San Diego"" souvenir pint glass.  Solid head brimming the glass with a fairly hard pour, creamy and white with excellent retention and lacing. A hazy golden color, looks thick from a solid amount of malt.  The smell is awesome, herbal and bitter notes hit the nose with and audacity that isn't a characteristic of many beers. I get no sweetness or citrus in the smell, a definite woodiness though, pine for sure.  Love the taste, it's all bitter hop flavor, pine, and herbal references all combining in the palate simultaneously. The bitterness stays with you during the whole analysis and doesn't ever let up, not even at the next sip when you refresh your palate with more delicious brew. Tons of flavor in here, the way an I.P.A should be, this bad boy puts some so called ""DIPA's"" from other breweries to shame.  Had to go back and specifically think about this one, it's not an in your face quality of the beer like the flavor is but it's there, solid and malty...at least enough to balance the brew and keep you coming back for more. Basically the malt in here=body, but no sweetness which is completely fine with me.  Hell yea it's drinkable, this is my third one tonight! Highly recommended offering from stone if you're looking to grab a sixer of something new or something great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnwarne,4.05,"A beer haiku for you:  IPA? OK; Solid effort but not great: Worthwhile sipping ale.  Not a bad IPA--just not as good as a few of it's peers nor it's other family members [Stone, that is]. Perhaps I am a little critical tonight, but my excitement in trying another Stone offering fell a little flat. Don't mean to harsh this beer--just not a home run.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Prostman81,4.13,"Finally, after years of waiting, got to try Stone IPA after a buddy picked up a sixer at the local store. This one definitely didn't disappoint. I had already been lucky to try the regular Stone Pale Ale, and was a little surprised by this one.  The apperance was a nice gold color; the PA has a deep, almost blood-color to it, and I was expecting this to be just a hoppier version of that. Sure was wrong. Stone, in their brilliance decided to really make this a beer of it's own, rather than just defaulting to an existing grain bill.  Poured a nice 1 and a half finger head that stuck around. Was expecting a little more aroma than what was presented, but still was good.  Taste is where it's at. The grains used provide a very sturdy backbone to the beer. A bit of hop oil seems to stick on the tongue, and overall the hops do not dominate this, but rather mix nicely for a combo of citrus, floral, and spice.  Goes down very smoothly, although I did start to notice a little alcohol note towards the bottom of the glass. Not enough to put me off, but enough to give me pause and respect for this. Not something I would pound two or three of down in a sitting, but a good opener beer for something a little more sessionable. Just a well crafted IPA from a brewery that I keep discovering really has their sh*t together. I'm so glad this one will now be a regular option at the store.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bajasith,4.17,"Love to visit Stone Brewing since there is always something new in the works, being food and beer.  Stone IPA is one of a kind as it pours amber/orange with a nice thick frothy head as I love to dip my nose to the ever present aroma of thick hops... (on that note... if there ever was a shaving creme with thick hop aroma, beer geeks rejoice)  Taste: Hops explode in your mouth as the sweetness of the malts balance out the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, bitterness fades as the sweet malt and slight cabonation blends it all well.  Drinkability: Hop heads rejoice... This brew goes very well with spicy Mexican food as hops bite through the burning sensation of the tongue almost nubing the burn... Sip this brew all night with some spicy salsa and chips.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Well balanced with a hop kick and a dry finish - great for the style.  M: Medium carbonation. Sticky but with a drying finish.  D: Great for 6.9%.

D- Good drinking beer, each drink has so much flavor that it is really a beer you can take your time and savor, though I can't call it my favorite IPA, it is definitely up there and is a beer I will be looking for again in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,spoons,3.65,Poured from a bomber to a pint glass.  A really superb looking beer. The color is a hazy orange with a great white head and nice sticky lacing.  The smell is a nice standout. Great hoppyness. Citrus/orange pine. Smells great.  The taste has a strange bitterness to it provided by the hops. Has a mild sweetness underneath the hop bitterness. Taste a little alcohol on the end.  This is a good beer but it doesnt leave me running for another one like some IPA's do.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A bit of sweetness as well.  T - Hop-laden bite with citrus overtones and just a bit of malty sweetness in the peripherals.  M - Light-bodied with a hint of carbonation. Slightly sticky, but not thickly so.  D - While the hop influence is incredibly strong, this is still a very tasty and drinkable beer. Highly recommended for hop-heads.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: nice not to heavy hop citrus and a light pine. a light sweetness as well. T: light hop citrus and pine, like a little brother to ruination, malt sweetness is also light and a bitter pine long aftertaste. M: light carbonation, hops give good crispness.

Mouthfeel is light, slightly buttery with a crisp, hoppy finish.  For a straight IPA this beer is very hoppy. It is definitely not a great introduction to this style of beer, but is terrific for one who has acquired an appreciation for a delicious hop bouquet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DNICE555,4.48,This review will get a mug next to my name!!!! (nerdy excitement!!!!) This achievement clearly trumps a silly mug at Eli's. Had on tap at Plan B.  A - Orangey copper body with a nice white head. Looks pretty.  S - Nice citrus hops. Screaming for me to take a sip.  T - The citrus hops transition from nose hairs to my taste buds. A tiny malt backbone to balance it out nicely.  M - Very crisp bitterness that assaults the tongue with in a rage of passion.  D - Nice smooth hoppy beer that is very well balanced. Definatley one of my go to ipa's. Very glad they made it to CT so I can have it on tap. I had to finish it quickly so the family of hops were able to stay together. I don't want to be the kind of person that separates a family.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Some other fruits also present, maybe peach.  T - Hops are featured up front and they are salty and wet. Sweet malts taste like honey and caramel. Long and bitter finish but not tonsil-twisting. Crisp. end.  M - Medium body with a slightly sticky texture.  D - For all the trash talking on the bottle, this is a balanced American IPA.

Look: Super gold with what looks to be a nice, moderate amount of carbonation. A nice finger and a half head. Wonderful lace retention. Smell: Sweet, citrus with a very balanced malt background. It gets a 5 due to the balance, very, very nice. Taste: Much like the smell, it has wonderful balance . The went very hoppy but made it nice and crisp. A little too much of the citrus hop flavor, but just a little, tiny bit. Mouth: Good carbonation, goes down smooth but the aftertaste bitters up a little much. Drinkability: A good choice for any IPA fans. Easy to session (just under 7%) and not too heavy in the belly. I like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Flashsp2,4.23,"Stone IPA bomber into .5L pilsner glass  Clear orange with gold highlights, two finger oranged tinted beige foam that tracks monstrous lace. Retention is pretty good to boot.  Aroma is powerfully citric, with loads of underripe navel oranges, green hop leafs, pink grapefruit, tangerines, floral, herbs, tropical fruit. I think there may be just a wee bit of light caramel in there as well.  Taste is big salty green hops, grapefruit, apricot skin, tangerines, pale malt, and a long and bitter citric finish. Dry and crisp at the end.  Body is medium with a late blooming carbonation that is a bit prickly.  This is a hard hitting IPA that is too strong to session, but too good to have just one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AgentZero,3.73,"A - Pale orangish with a huge bubble head that quited down rather quickly and didn't leave much lacing.  S - Been drinking too many DIPA's, this smells pretty muted, but nice in what you get. Citrus and grassy hops smell mellow nicely but that's about it.  T - Smooth, come citrus hops, but nothing too grapefuity, a bit grassy, somewhat sweet, solid malt backbone to even it all out.  M - Smooth, medium carbonation, nice light drinker.  D - This is the type of IPA I would give to people who are looking to try IPAs for the first time, it's pretty unoffensive, no offensive hop tastes, very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,portia99,4.33,"12oz bottle poured into a Brooklyn snifter.  A - Pours a hazy, translucent and glowing pale orange color. A thick, rocky 3 fingers of foam rests atop this brew and exhibits pretty good staying power. After a couple of minutes the head falls sufficiently to allow drinking and leaves behind some loose but very sticky lacing on the glass. A beautiful pour.  S - Citrus and pine are the name of the game here. Oranges and grapefruit take center stage with the pine playing just a bit in the background. A small hint of alcohol enters the equation. Very nice example of a west coast IPA.  T - Very dry, bitter - very good...Citrus is prominant as with the aroma - grapefruit plays a big role...still getting some orange and pineapple enters the picture too. Pine is still high, but sits behind the citrus flavors. Alcohol also comes in on the inhale and continues to contribute a bit to the flavor too.  M - Medium bodied with pretty high carbonation level. Carbonation is enhancing the bitterness and gives a nice lively kick on the tongue and cheeks. Very dry feeling IPA...bitterness lingers long after the swallow and also some of the citrus stays behind.  D - This is one of those beers that reminds me how many great beers there are out there right now. This is an exceptional IPA but when I walk into my favorite beer stores, I tend to walk right by...it doesn't stand out to me on the shelves...seems ""common"". But, I'm glad to have picked up this one along the way. This is a great IPA that suffers from great availability. Very drinkable IPA, great west coast flavors, reasonable pricing...what more can you ask for. Think I have to revisit this one more often...hmm, wonder how many other great beers like this I just walk by in the stores.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,phiberoptik,4.74,"This seems to be one of the staple IPAs according to hop heads I talk to. Decided to give it a try and must say it out works some Imperial/Double IPAs I have tried.  Poured into a ""Sam Adams"" Perfect Beer Glass.  Pale yellow with a small head. I LOVE the smell of this beer. If it was a cologne I could wear it!  The taste is hop heaven and it goes down smooth although I get a bit of a ""tinny"" after taste. Very light and not filling at all.

147,88,juju7,4.32,"Quite happy to finally try this much talked about IPA. Also happy to say it is as good as everyne says. Basically they have nailed the style of American IPA. Nailed and virtually trademarked it. Hops aplenty on the nose in the mouth and well after you've finished.

Can't wait to try it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The nose is full of grapefruit and pine with just a touch of pot skunkyess. Sweet biscuit malt is also in the aroma. Flavor is wonderful with loads of American hop character. Grapefruit, pine, orange, floral and a hint of spice. It's all there folks. Strong bitterness, but this beer has a solid malt backbone that keeps it from being completely unbalanced. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium with a sticky dry finish and lingering bitterness. The lighter body and dry finish makes it super quaffable. Could be hop addict's session beer if it had just a little bit lower of an ABV. Classic IPA, and one that I had forgotten how great it was. Glad I got a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CBlack85,4.49,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Really quite a nice amber/orange color, a fairly aggressive pour produced an enormous amount of white foamy head. Very nice sticky lacing as well.  As soon as I started to pour the huge aroma completely overpowered any other aromas in the room. My wife was cooking dinner, and as I started to pour, the smell of food seemed to dissipate and be overtaken by a huge citrusy, hoppy smell. Very nice  The hop flavor is nearly as dominant on the tongue as it is in the nose. Piney and bitter, lots of grapefruit and some orange zest, but the surprise is the malt presence. The sweet malty backbone really balances this IPA out. Medium bodied with a mildly sticky feel on the tounge. Very nice overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Pours into my american pint glass with a nice gold color and a foamy and rocky white head that takes a bit to recede leaving gobs of lacing.  It has a decent smell though not overly intense. It is very citrusy and zesty with also some herbal grassiness. There isn't much malt to the scent of this beer.  It is smooth and hoppy with a good amount of biscuity malt backing and a nice bitter finish. Luscious but insanely drinkable. This is the quintessential quaffing IPA.  The mouthfeel is nice and medium bodied. This stuff is so easy to put back, it is like drinking water, far higher drinkability than a light beer especially when it is nice and warmed up.

Smell: Lotsa grapefruit and florals, makes me think it'll be a bit of a bitter bomb.  Taste: Same west coast hops coming through, cascade and the like. Overall what I'd expect for an overhopped ipa. The bitterness overtakes the hop character a bit, but still not too bad.  Mouthfeel: A slight bit sticky, about average.  Drinkability: While still a typical unbalanced west coast ipa, overall this really is pretty drinkable.

Smell is an assault to nose with a ton of citrus and a bit of pine. Taste follows with the nose plus some. A bitter-sweet citric parade fills the palate. The hop oils are ouzing out of every sip. Finishes with a perfect amount of bitterness. Dryness lingers on for quite awhile after a pint or two. Overall, a top notch IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jeffo,3.97,"Originally had a bottle of this that my parents picked up in PE and flew over at Christmas, but the bottle was a little old. Found a relatively fresh bottles at Geers in Gent, so was happy to give it another go.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger medium-thin looking white head with decent retention. Color is carrot red or orange peel with almost no carbonation. Head slowly recedes to a film and decent ring. Splotchy wisp remains, leaving some nice lacing down the glass.  SMELL: Bold nose of pale malts, pineapple, honeydew melon and some piney notes. Some floral hop aromas and quite fruity. Very nice.  TASTE: Pale malts, pineapple again, and lots of honeydew sweetness and bitter pine. Plenty of bitterness at the finish, with pine and citrus fruits. A big, bitter and fruity aftertaste lingers and lingers on the palate. Tasty brew, and bitter in the Stone style.  PALATE: Medium-full body and creamy smooth on the palate. Goes down smooth and finishes relatively dry on the palate. Good feel.  OVERALL: Say what you want about their marketing, but Stone is one of the most solid and consistently good breweries in the States. This was an enjoyable and tasty IPA, and if you’re a fan of bitterness, this will not disappoint. Admittedly, the first time I had this beer many moons ago I was not all that impressed, but freshness may have been an issue there. This bottle was great, so I’m glad I was able to have it again.

Pine and citrus hops waft from the glass, but there is also an underlying sweetness, and further inspection reveals some grass notes as well.  The flavor is very traditional for the style consisting of pine and woody hops, and a sweet malt backbone for support.  This is a smooth brew, medium in body and medium to moderate in carbonation with only a slight drying aspect at the finish.

147,88,obywan59,4.82,"12 oz. bottle.  A somewhat tentative pour gave me only a finger and a half head and only moderate lacing. Golden in color and slightly cloudy but transparent. On the 2nd pour I went for broke and had to pause for a minute till I could get the last 2 swallows into the glass. 3 1/2 finger head in my pint glass.  A blast of hops after popping the cap that's almost as good as sex. Wonderful piney herbal aroma. Every now and then, a whiff of faint popcorn or coffee.  Nice, light sweetness, but the hops predominate. Noticable citrus early on. Long-lasting bitterness in the end. Aftertaste 2.0 kicks in with every burp, bringing the herbal vapors of the hops back to the fore.  Moderate body. Very biting early on, but mellowing out the more you drink. Slightly sticky. Nice burn down the throat.  A great drinker, but I'm finding the 6.9% ABV is slowing me down a bit.  I had thought that AB was the first Stone brew I had tried, but after reading the notes on the label concerning the gargoyle, I realized it was this beer. My feel at the time was that it was an inpressive brew, but I wasn't sure that I really liked it all that much.

The hops come through (there are definitely some C hops in here), and thee is a very clean bitterness in the end (tastes like Magnum). Very well bittered.  M - Good carbonation, not to light.

Aroma a pleasing balance of sweet malt and colorful hops with a citrus-pine background.  Taste of striking hop flavors as hinted initially by the beer's aroma. Bitter hops linger nicely; however, they are not overwhelming in part due to a strong malt temperance. Straw and pines detectable as background enhancements. The hops remain as an eclectic and lively aftertaste prominent several minutes after consumption. Very impressive.  Mouthfeel smooth and of moderate weight. Carbonation moderate.

147,88,zoso493,4.22,"My 100th review! I was hoping to make it something very special, like an Abyss that I've been impatiently holding onto, but I think this will suffice just fine. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Stone straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a very pleasant honey-amber color that turns very yellow when held up to the light. A vigorous pour produces a two-finger creamy head that leaves an intermediate amount of lacing on the glass. It's very hazy, as well, which is what I like in my IPA's.  Smell: Stone IPA has a fantastically refreshing and zesty hop aroma to it. Fruit, and in particular grapefruit, is dominant motif in the scent. It almost smells like the hops are crusted with sugar in this one. This is probably one of the most luxurious fruity-smelling IPA's that I have come across to date.  Taste: The taste sticks very strongly to the hoppy grapefruit theme. At this point in the review, I'm noticing that this brew is about 2 weeks past it's best by date, which could explain why the hops are a bit subdued. It might be unfair to review an older example like this, but the beer is still damn good. It's sort of like biting into a grapefruit, if the grapefruit provided you with a pleasant hop bitterness towards the end. The sweet malts act to balance the hops nicely, as well.  Mouthfeel: This, for me, is the ideal IPA in terms of mouthfeel. It's thicker like a DIPA but still retains an adequate amount of carbonation. If it were fresher I'd imagine it would be a bit crisper, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt in that category.  Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable IPA and at 6.9% ABV is fairly low in alcohol. It's not going to bruise your palate with the hops (like Ruination might), so it would be nice to enjoy a couple of these.  Overall, this is a really nice example of the style and I would love to get my hands on a fresher version because this is a very hop-forward beer. It's not a hugely complex IPA but it's very well put-together and is something I would definitely drink again often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,robertjbell,4.72,"Appearance: A deep hazy amber/orange coloration with an luscious ivory head leaving a thin but enduring retention, and a lovely speckled lacing that also lingers long into the drink  Nose: WOW, this is a hop bomb, must be the dry hopping, I'm smelling definite West Coast hops, but nothing particular, probably Cascade, but also some mellower ones on the nose, such as Amarillo or Centennial. Also in the nose is a delicate balance between herbal and floral hop elements, a sweet, pineapple, lemon, and grapefruit citric hop element, and balanced by a sweet malty characteristic rounding out the aroma into one of the best smelling IPA's I've been able to lay my hands on.  Taste: A gentle malt sweetness is apparent up front, mixed with a definite taste of pine and grapefruit in CLASSIC west coast IPA fashion. Mingled in are strong citrus notes and a nice, full hop finish that doesn't blast too hard.  Mouthfeel: Super creamy, but with a nice dry bite on the finish  Overall: One of the best traditional west coast IPA's out there, hard to top.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Chico1985,4.15,"I've had this in the bottle many times and on-tap, finally getting to review it. Poured into my new Magic Hat pint glass (thanks Julio's). Appearance is faint orange with nice creamy white head, carbonation bubbles flying everywhere. Head retains well and leaves thick lacing. Smell is great as well, loads of hops and some tropical notes. Taste is good but doesn't really live up to the smell. I'm getting lots of grassy notes, grapefruit, in the aftertaste a bit of biscuit and surprisingly booze. A hint of toasty caramel lingers as well. Mouthfeel is a tad watery. As far as drinkability, it's good but there are probably other IPA's I'd prefer for the same price/cheaper (Titan IPA comes to mind). Still a solid go-to IPA I will continue to get in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GeezLynn,4,"Finally getting around to doing a review for this one with 22oz.  Comes out a very light and hazy orange-yellow shade. Decent white head.  Caramel malt and hops are the primary components of the aroma. I get more pine here than citrus.  No doubt it's a West Coast IPA and a Stone brew. Loads of pine resin and grapefruit that starts out subtly but asserts itself as it warms up. And as expected, the malt is really light. The first 8oz are very green, but I start to pick up a little more fruit toward the latter half of the bottle. Finish is medium length with plenty of bitterness.  The mouth is light yet moderately sticky with full carbonation that complements the rest of the beer nicely.  All things considered, a pretty good IPA. No glaring weaknesses, although isn't a favorite. Would love to get it fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Appears a nice gold color with a fluffy white head that dissipates very slowly, never completely disappearing and leaves great lacing down the glass.  The nose is dominated by hops, with citrus and pine dominating. The taste is similar, very hoppy, with a great bitterness and bite to it. There is a lot going on in each sip, but it's somewhat difficult to pick out exactly what. There are some nice malts in the background but the hops dominate. The aftertaste is bitter and sticks around for a good amount of time.  This beers is actually quite smooth with the right amount of carbonation. It is on the thick side, but it fits well. Drinkibility is great on this beer as well, something that is fairly easy to put down and tastes great. All around just a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,bgreg3,4.33,"Stone IPA. I have really been into trying stone lately. The bombers are cheap and the beer is pretty damn good. This beer has amazing head retention, the foam sticks to the side of the pint glass fantastically. I need to invest in a tulip glass. Cloudy orange, a bit pale in some areas and the air bubbles come up in a manner that make this beer look proud.  Stone IPA smells delightfully of citrus, floral, apricot, and subtle yeast. A beautiful amalgam of what I like to smell in and IPA. I taste apricot notes that mix with yeasty characteristics and a slight bittering hop taste. Nothing is overwhelming in this beer, it is perfectly balanced. It ends on the hoppy side but just barely, and it is not very wet on the finish compared to some of the IPA's I'm use to. I might very well buy a six pack of this sometime.  The beer is tingly when it first touches the tongue but I enjoy this feel. It's not too heavy and not too light. This is so easy to drink and can be very deceiving for the alcohol content that is in it. It goes down a bit too good (if there is such a thing).

Good standing foam off the pour and lace throughout.  S: Grassy and floral hop with some spice. Fresh.  T: The hop character of this beer is grassy and spicy with a strong floral character on the finish that lingers. Maltiness is caramel and toffee like. Overall a VERY clean and fresh flavor with some hop oil on the back of the palate.  M: Creamy, cream, creamy with small bubbles of carbonation. The finish is dry with some slickness from the hop oils.

147,88,joemeister,3.5,"Pours a cloudy, golden yellow. Head is white, sudsy, and about 3/4"" inch.  Smell: no surprise here. Spicy hops dominate, with a vague suggestion of tropical citrus in the background. Like mango or something, but its weak.  Ooh. I did not expect that. The obvious flavor commencement is citrusy hops, but it follows with a surprising grilled, smoky flavor to finish. The aftertaste is almost buttery (my brother says he tastes bacon). This beer would satisfy the hophead who enjoys a little more three-dimensionality in their palate. I appreciate it, but the smokiness is not what I expect or enjoy in an IPA. I like the finish to be a little more sweet. With that said, this is definitely worth trying. It has a uniqueness as compared to other run-of-the-mill IPA's, but I find myself largely indifferent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S- I most enjoyed the smell of this beer. Strong and fresh centennial hops accented by a basic but clean malt/straw aroma. Hops were piney with a bit of citrus.  T- This highly hopped beer is balanced by a clean, basic, sweat straw malt taste. The hops up front are in your face with an acidic pine and grapefruit taste. This is followed by a clean malt that works well with the hops. There is a sweetness that balances the finish.  M- Oily mouthfeel. This IPA brings along a nice carbonation hindered slightly by the hops.  D- Very drinkable for a high gravity IPA with balance. Yet it will attack the pallet and more then two for me would start to overdo the taste it brings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Head settles to a nice film, which remained for duration of drink. Beer is slightly less than clear, but not too dark, or opaque.  S- WOW! This smells fantastic! This beer smells strongly of hops, slightly floral. Very very clean smelling. This is the single best smelling beer I have ever had the pleasure of sampling.  T- Taste is again very dominated by hops, but I really enjoy this flavor. It is a very complex taste. Aftertaste is very clean and almost non-existent after a short while. Very good.  M- Smooth, with the right amount of carbonation. Silky, and slightly thick, without being muddy. Again, very good. I am really enjoying this beer.  D- This beer is very drinkable, as a one and done beer. I would not consider this to be a beer to drink on a weekend for ""recreational"" time, but is going to become a staple for me when I want something upscale, and worthy of savoring.  Very beautiful beer in the glass, the epitome of perfection in beer. Smell is the best I have ever smelt. I want to take a swab and dab my upper lip so I can smell it all day... yummmm.

147,88,Pahn,4.3,"12oz bottle into a wine glass. Forgot to note the date, but the store had just got this 6pack in the week I bought it, which was a couple weeks ago.  Appearance: Easy pour yields a 1/3 inch, frothy, off-white head with bubbles all around the sides. Head dissipates quickly and leaves a lot of lacing (beer has good lacing as well). Pours a hazy orange.  Smell: Strong piney and citrus hops (mostly citrus). Some faint breadiness lurking in the background.  Taste: Starts out a little sweet with a cool citrus flavor, then bitters up to a healthy degree and settles into a long malt finish the character of which is reminiscent of sourdough or white bread. Great balance. The flavor is not very complex, but it gets right to the point. Strong, refreshing, aromatic hops up front, smooth and satisfying light-bready malt finish.  Mouthfeel: There's a fair amount of carbonation, and the body is rather light but smooth and approaching creamy. Light but not watery or juicy. No alcohol warmth at all.  Drinkability: Hidden ABV and great IPA flavor. A staple beer for me.  There really isn't much to say about Stone IPA. It's a solid, straight-ahead American IPA.

A thick dense sudsy ivory head with limitless retention and average lacing.  This is not at all the assertive hop-forward beverage I was expecting. Instead, the aroma is very clean and restrained, suggesting toasty malts and English digestive biscuits backed by a light fruitiness (citrus and melon) and an herbal/floral note from the hops. Very distinctive though difficult to verbalize.  Malt balanced, toasty, and spicy/herbal flavors dominate: fresh thyme, cardamom, and faint vanilla pods... The finish brings on a very well balanced citrus-kissed bitterness, but nothing like you would normally expect from Stone (Ruination this ain't).  Rich medium-light body with modest carbonation (as expected from cask).  A very different beer on cask with a superior drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Good retention and lacing. Very attractive beer. Smell is a little reserved for a west coast IPA. Nonetheless, piney and citrusy hops are prevelant. Taste is resiny, piney hops with a balancing pale malt backbone and a touch of honey sweetness. The finish is crisp and dry with a moderate bitterness left on the palette.

Add in a little bit of the sweet malt and maybe even a little breadiness and some other floral notes.  T- Contrary to the strong scent of hops, this is pretty balanced all considering. Piney hops up front and a good malt backbone. Also I pick up a little bit of grass on the tail end.  M- A thin to medium body that has a good amount of bite up front and a little dry on the finish.

147,88,icetraxx,3.95,"Apologies in advance for my over-comparison to Bell's Two Hearted.  A: Pours a two finger head into my Weihenstephan mug, which looks mighty creamy might I add, and is a slightly hazy straw color. Fizzles down to a half finger head that is still creamy and laces the glass like crazy. Looks better than Bell's Two hearted.  S: The smell is giving me back faith in beer compared to the terrible Samuel Smith oatmeal stout I just poured down the drain. Smells pretty much exactly like Bell's Two Hearted, a tad less malty on the nose. Grapefruit dominates, there is some citrus, and other fruity florals from the hops. Pretty aromatic, even a tad more aromatic than the Bell's.  T: Not quite as bitter as I was expecting. The floral hops overwhelm the malt by just enough to really mask the malt, this happens to be less balanced than two hearted while maintaining about the same level of hoppiness. There is an ever so slight earthiness, I am not sure if this was actually intended, a flaw, or a result from some slight aging. Living in Michigan I know that my bottle isn't as fresh as the two hearted that I can get, and this shows as some complexity from the hops has obviously cooled down due to age. The lack of balance really gets to me on this one, I wish I could actually taste some malt, this IPA definitely feels one dimension due to this. As another poster has said, this one smells better than it tastes.  M: A little light bodied for me, possibly a tad more watery than two hearted. Carbonation is spot on.  D: A proper session IPA. I could drink another without crying out for a different IPA. I am not drinking it quite as fast as I find myself drinking other IPAs.  O: This is the standard for all other west coast IPAs to follow, though the mid-west style IPAs are more my cup a tea.

Feels great when drinking, smooth and just right on the carbonation. Drinkability on this one is above average, in my opinion. A great tasting brew, with not too much alcohol content. Could be my favorite ""session"" brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jamiesessions,4.62,"Orange copper colour with a white head that leaves a nice-looking lacing. The smell is truly something to behold. All kinds of fruits and flowers come together to form a bouquet of brilliance that is hard to describe using only the words in our English language. Suffice it to say that the smell is so powerful that I almost feel as if drinking it would be an affront to my nose. The taste, while by no means as affront, simply doesn't live up to to the nose. That, however will be the only negative thing you will hear me say about this. It tastes wonderful, with a hops taste, and a malt finish that creates a wonderful balance, while still maintaining the bite and bitterness that a good IPA should have. Feels wonderful, with a great body, and I could drink this all day. A great product that I'll be glad to have another of.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,danetrain0101,4,"Apearance is a dark gold with a cloudy hew. A decent white foam head.  Smells of strong hops and alcohol. Some malty smells as well as a light grass smell.  Very bitter with a strong presence of hops. Leaves a strong after taste of hops and alcohol.  Very smooth feel with a heavy presence.  Great IPA to drink. Not to strong, not to light. Just a great all around IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,berley31,4.32,"A: Poured with an average-sized, white head, that scored pretty well in the lasting-department. Body is hazy and a light orange color.  S: Excellent aroma. Lots of hops, and lots of citrus... especially orange and lemon. Beautiful.  T: Huge citrus blast at first, then the equally-huge bitterness hits you at the finish. This results in an expected very-long-lasting flavor.  M: Creamy, medium-bodied, average carbonation.  D: Being on the east coast of Canada, I've probably been lucky to have the few Stone beers that I've managed to find on trips to the U.S. Beers like this one continue to make me want to try more... three for three so far, Stone! Keep up the excellent work.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rwrk42,4.92,"Appearance: Golden color that has a nice froth and lace  Smell: HOPS, HOPS and more Hops. Very nice smell of hops with a slight fruity undertone.  Taste: A great amount of hops at first taste. Incredible character of hops but very smooth at the same time. A bit of a bitter finish from all the hops but it is just perfect.  One of the best IPAs you can buy. Highly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thedrewski86,4.17,"Pours a pale golden yellow with hints of orange and a slight haze. Left a good 1"" off-white head with good retention. Leaves solid lacing. Smell is piney and earthy. Makes you think of the woods. Taste is initially smooth with a smokey hop bight for a finish. Kind of burnt. Mouthfeel is pretty light, mild carbonation. A little too mild actually. Drinkability is good never the less. This is a great bitter IPA. Not too complex, just right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Beerandraiderfan,4.33,"The standard for SoCal ipas. Copper pour, looks beautiful, aroma, big bold citrus hop, taste, more of the same. Amazing finish, leaves little to no aftertaste, just hits big all over the tongue. Must be some real crystal malt or something  Can't really faultthe mouthfeel for going away, it would be worse if it didn't. Very drinkable. Example: Got a keg of this in Reno for graduation 10 years ago, when just about nobody (especially college age) had ever had it.  Lots of pukey chicks at the end of the night, who didn't realize that this stuff has some kick. I had never seen chicks drink anything so good and bitter. Good times.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bbkd3b,3.83,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  A: Comes out a nice copper color with great clarity and carbonation. The head's decent and the lacing's good. A fine looking bber, all in all.  S: As they say on the bottle, it's dry-hopped so there they are. Pine notes up front with some citrus buried deep within. Not bad at all.  T: Great hopiness on top of bitterness. Those two are the most evident, but there's some citrusy flavor underneath. Grapefruit, maybe? Tough to tell. A good IPA flavor.  M: A perfect, medium body with spot-on carboantion. It goes down clean and after a few sips, I can feel it in my gut. Real good stuff.  D: Hoppy beers always get a little easier for me to drink as I go along. It's the first one that I have to get through. That wasn't too hard with this brew at all. Take two if you get the bigger bottle.  Overall/notes: This is just a good IPA from Stone. I preferred their Pale Ale a little more, but that just speaks about how great THAT beer was. This one is... well it's really good, too. An easy-to-access beer that'd be great for novices (like myself) to look into.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,capps24,4.77,"Stone IPA how can you go wrong. You can smell the hops in this one, and its got great character to back it up. I am a hop head, and was very satisfied after having my first Stone IPA years ago, and after having one tonight, had to rate it.  If you like IPA's this is a no brainer! Great appearance, not too carbonated, and will simply blow you away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FeDUBBELFIST,3.67,"Served in a pint glass.  A: Large frothy head from the pour. The head was bone white and diminished fairly quickly leaving excellent lace. As I continued to drink I realized the body didn't have any stick to the glass and left spare to none lacing. The body was an amberish-yellow (clear with just a little haze) and I swear there were barely noticeable green highlights. Huh.  S: Average malt bill. Grains and biscuits. The hops were indeed fresh. And heavy! Floral, herbal, grassy and just a smidge of citrus. There was a small yeast contribution to the aroma, that of sweat and must.  T: Pretty average but some pretty decent flavors come through. Mango, honey, light brown sugar, pepper, coriander and other spices, tobacco and a bit of some cardboard.  M: Again, nothing to write home about. Semi creamy texture with lively/prickly carbonation and a big, not quite heavy bitter finish.  D: Drinks pretty well but not much better than your average, baseline IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T- First gulp, the hop aroma delivered into the taste. Second taste, well balanced bitterness, citrus with pine notes coupled with caramel. Pleasant after taste.  M- Not thin, well carbed and with a stickiness from the malts  D- Very drinkable, after the first taste I noted to myself, ""save some bottles for tomorrow"".

147,88,californiakulak,3.6,Poured a bottle of this beer into a Firestone pint glass.  A. Nice amber color with a good one inch head. Good retention and lacing.  S. Smells of hops. Floral hops with a slight hint of sweatness.  T. Pretty good beer. Not as citrusy as I usually like but still tasty. Pretty standard for an ipa. Lots of bitter hops.  M. Medium body with a long bitter aftertaste. Good carbonation.  D. This beer was good but I feel that there are a many better IPA's in Cali. I would have trouble drinking more than 2 of these at one sitting.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,samie85,4.77,Reviewed from notes. Originally consumed 12/23.  A- Pours an light orange color with a white two finger head.  S-Fresh citrus and pine notes dominate here with a hint of caramel malt.  T-Follows the nose with citrus and pine bitterness with a caramel malt base that balances things a little.  M-Really creamy and smooth for an IPA. Medium boded with moderate carbonation.  D-This is one easy drinking IPA. It's easily one of my favorites and I hope Stone makes it to Chicago soon so I can regularly enjoy this fine beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: Nice initial hoppy, citrus body with an aftertaste that delivers too much pine for my liking.  Drinkability: I think it's a must to have more than one of these, or precede it with another IPA in order to get used to the piney undertones this one shows.  Value: Expensive, considering what else is out there in IPA Land.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goldbot,4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  A: One finger of off white foamy head. Slight carbonation. Golden copper color and crystal clear. The head is retained nicely with great lacing.  S: Floral hops, orange zest, a little piney. Touch of coriander.  T: Bitter hops, yeast, citrus, grain. A bit sweet on the finish, and moderate alcohol warmth.  M: Silky and smooth, balanced by a perfect amount of carbonation and alcohol.  D: This is very drinkable. The flavors are nicely balanced, and the hops don't overwhelm like many other IPAs.

147,88,Skitowneric,4.22,Poured a dark coppery gold. Nice two finger head that quickly disspated to one finger before I had a chance to take the first sip. Initial smells were with very forward hops but the citrus and fruit was present as well. The hop and fruit flavors are very forward on the palate. The taste hits you right away and then goes away with a nice balance. This beer does not have a huge bitter aftertaste you might expect given the initial smell and taste. Overall just another impressive Stone product.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,kcr357,3.77,"A-Dark copper with two generous fingers of foam and spotty lacing. Color is ominously close to Budweiser, but dark enough to tell the difference. S-Faint undertones of a normal IPA, then the hops gloriously hit your nose like a freight train. Light undertones of caramel and malt. T-Quite bitter as it should be, but there seems to be an odd or off flavor that does not belong, but dissipates after a few swigs. M-bubbly with a feeling that it coats the tongue; a bit syrupy.

147,88,irishking1977,4.1,"Bottle form. I'd normally have some issues with an 11 dollar six pack, but Stone is an exception; they make worthy brews.  A: Pours a solid dark gold, with decent lacing and a minimal head. I was expecting a huge, frothy head, but I didn't get the pour quite right.  S: Hops, citrus and some herbal notes. Pine also a found.  T: Lots of citrus and pine with copious hops. Now this is what an IPA should be. There haven't been too many IPA's that I have liked as much as this one, with the exception of Stone's Ruination. Now THAT one is the pinnacle of IPA's. In comparison, Their basic IPA seems slightly less refined and balanced than Ruination; the hops seem to dominate the taste too much. While that's not a bad thing by any means, Ruination still boasts a more varied and complex taste.  M: Highly carbonated and oily with a bitter background. The hops linger on the palate for quite some time.  D: This a pretty good session beer, even with a higher than average ABV. Regardless of price, if I'm in a hophead mood, I'll have to consider this one, or Ruination as my hopped beers of choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Not a huge head, but decent retention and lacing on it.  Smells strong of floral hops. I love that slightly sweet smell to the hops on the nose. Not much else though, as to be expected from the style.  Taste is what you'd expect based on the smell and the hype. Sweet hoppiness up front, lingering hoppy bitterness, well balanced between in each sip. Good carbonation and no bad aftertastes.

147,88,Magpie14,4.52,"A: here we have a soft hazed reddish yellow with a glowing character. The body shows some mildly entertaining life with a handful of swirling bubble pockets. The bleach white head rushed up after a diligent pour and melted away with pace. What is most striking is the interconnected spider webbing that christens the walls of my glass, things look sticky  S: a lush rush of hoppy smells fills my nasal cavity with a near instant mouthwatering reaction. Grapefruits, oranges, and prickly pine reign amongst a small candied malt sweetness. Hop monster coming at ya!  T: hmm, darn close to hop juice. I taste a fresh basket of citrus fruits with flavors ranging from lemons, oranges, pink grapefruits, and a nip of tropical pineapple. Oh, and I can not forget the easy-going pine notes that meld with the ""fruit gang."" For just an AIPA this thing is loaded Not much in the way of malts, or so my palate thinks. Yet, I sense they are just there, holding everything together. With some careful evaluation I gather a firm pale malt sugar cookie goodness  M: with the flavors, look, and style it is right where it should be. The body holds a medium quality with complimentary carbonation. It is surprisingly refreshing and sipping is tough to maintain as continual gulps beckon  D: full of zest and formidable flavors, this is a staple in IPA's as far as I am concerned.

Poured into a standard glass.  A - Pours starting as a light, bright yellow, fading to an orange. Clear with a nice, foamy white head that clings rather well. Head that sticks around very well. Great lace, clinging the height of the glass.  S - Can't smell too well tonight. Strong hop aromas is about all I can get through my stuffed sinuses. I know there is much more to this beer, so I'll come back to it another day. A six-pack is in my future.  T - A strong hop spice kicks you in the tongue. Very herbal. Definitely piney. An excellent, complex balance that brings more with very sip. Definitely a strong, bitter, hoppy beer. Tastes of malts are present too. Very intriguing.  M - Kind of lose me a bit here. Kind of carbonated/foamy, and I don't care for it. Has a very bready aftertaste, but with a dry hoppy kick. Not bad, but I dont care for the thick, foamy feel.  D - Quite drinkable. ABV is under control, and it's not too abusive on the palate. Great tasting and complex.

147,88,cratez,4.25,"650ml bomber poured into a shaker. My dad was kind enough to grab this for me on a recent trip to Las Vegas. He picked it up at Khoury's Fine Wine & Spirits.  Pours a clear, bright yellow with golden hues and a fluffy white head that retains for the duration of the beer. Sheets of spotted lacing line the entire glass. Smell is a pungent bouquet of hops, with intense citrus fruit, pine needle, and lemon/lime aromas. Strong hop flavours burst onto the palate, producing a pronounced citric bitterness and juicy, clementine punch. Big flash of white grapefruit and lemony hops in the body. Lots of tang and spice. The bold hop flavours and aromas suggest the use of hop oil or extract. A weak malt backbone manages to cut the IBUs only somewhat, with a bit of sweetness, white bread, and crackers toward the finish. Aftertaste is not as bitter as I thought it would be. It's a strange comparison, but this resembles an amped up, American version of Harviestoun Bitter & Twisted.

The color is a deep golden color with a light tan fluffy head that has great retention and leaves lacing on the side of the glass.  The nose is very hoppy, citrus and grapefruit and floral hops all shine in this one. It also gives off a strong cannabis like smell. This is pretty dang good.  The taste is dominated by hops, much like the nose, but there is also a significant malt backbone that comes through at cellar temperature. Very hoppy and straight forward, but very balanced and complex. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light appropriate carbonation. Lingering bitter aftertaste.

A really nice bouquet of fresh, piney and spicy citrus hops that are dripping with flavor, then balanced by a slight bit of malty breadiness. Awesome flavor.

A nice one inch head that seemed to linger on for a while.  S: Well, let me first say this is one pungent IPA. Very fragrant and citrus like. Big hops, grapefruit, orange peel, tangerines, sweet hops, pine, all of the above. A real inviting smelling IPA.  T: Such a well balanced taste right from the get go. The hops are very unique in this one. They don't overpower you like Ruination but they certainly aren't weak by any standards. The taste definitely resembles the smell. Lots of big sweet hops, fragrant citrus, pine, orange, tangerines, etc.  M: Medium to medium heavy mouthfeel. Fairly carbonated but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, a great feel.  D: Outstanding drink on this one. So well balanced. The ABV is perfect, not too high and not too low. I could've drank pints of this all night.  Overall, one of the best IPA's I've ever come across.

147,88,Vengeance526,4.6,"Pours a medium lightly hazy golden color with a thin white head that lasts for a little while before slowly subsiding.  Aroma is very citric with an emphasis on lemon.  Taste reveals a light malty profile and pine notes in the back, but the hops largely give off citrus notes all around. I get lemon from start to finish with some orange and grapefruit to a lesser degree.  Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Ruination may be one of my favorite beers, but Stone's regular IPA is so much lighter while still being quite flavorful. It's not as crazy as Ruination but the hop presence is still amazing and I want to drink it all day. One of my all time favorite IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The head is roughly 2 fingers thick and gives a very pillow-y appearance as it dissipates leaving a nice thick lacing (more of a coating.)  S- Lemon zest, marijuana, bready malts. I'm actually getting a very slight amount of booze out of it too as it warms, but nothing alarming.  T- The ""bready-ness"" that I smelled in nose is the most evident player on the palate. Also, some lingering bitterness on the back of my tongue. Not much in the way of the citrusy hops that I get in the aroma (though faint.)  M- Pretty standard IPA. Possibly a little low on the carbonation scale, but nothing that detracts greatly from the overall quality.  D- Deceptively drinkable for nearly 7%. Nothing is too overwhelming, which is good except for with the hops, which I was hoping to be more prominent. All in all, a good beer and definitely one of the better of the widely accessible IPAs. I feel like this bottle might be a little older than I would have liked, but no dating system on the bottles so I don't know. I hadn't had it in months before tonight, but I remember having a bottle or two and definitely some servings from the tap that were slightly better, but my palate may has changed since then too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jdense,4.42,"22 oz. bottle poured into Piraat snifter.  Pale Amber cloudy body, 3/4 finger white semi-rocky head, some lacing. Citrusy nose (grapefruit) some piney-ness, and bready malts. Taste is quite citrus, a bit sweet, meyer lemons? Above average mouthfeel and carbonation. Extremely drinkable. Maybe not as much of a hopbomb as most SD IPAs, but certainly an exemplar of the West Coast IPA style. Along with HUB and Bell's Two Hearted, one of the most balanced IPAs. Classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,UncleBubba,4.38,"After recently trying some great IPA's from Smuttynose, and Dogfish Head, I was skeptical when i came across Stone IPA. Now, all I can say is wow!!! This is a damn good IPA!!! To me it has the perfect balance of hoppiness/maltiness. Very easy to drink, and leaves me wanting more. Nice session beer. I'll definitely be purchasing more Stone IPA's in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,microbrew52,4.27,This pours hazy yellow orange with a little small layer of foam at the top which will lace the glass slightly. It has a very fragrant like cologne.

147,88,BrewitYerself,3.72,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass; 40 deg F.  Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a copper hue. Thin white head, disippates quickly. No lacing.  Aroma is of bright fruity/floral hops, some esters, some sweet malts, perhaps some grainy/toasted malt. Hints of honey, too.  Taste is slightly sweet and fruity upfront - mainly hops and esters. Bitterness explodes on the mid-palate, through to the finish. There are some sweet/grainy malt flavors, not enough to match the hops.  Mouthfeel is nice - moderate carbonation, slight chewiness, very smooth.  This is a tasty beer packed with hops. The bitterness is a bit sharp on the finish and a bit too astringent. Throughout the sample the hop aroma gave way to sweet malt and honey. The flavors kept going back and forth between pungent, pithy hops and sweet malt. The hops are very persistent on the finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kingjames1,4.32,"Pours a light, murky gold with little, but persisting, sticky head. Smells like citrus, grass, and a faint note of pine needles. Taste is a tart citrus, and pine.

147,88,spencerw,4.24,"I've read so many good things about Stone and this particular beer I thought I would try it. Not generally a big IPA fan but wanted to give it a shot.  A - The bear poured a very refreshed looking light copper honey, thick foam head that lasted for a minute or two then left a nice even lace along side the glass. Very good looking brew.  S - Pronounced malt and citrus smell. It was golden to the nose and smelled extremely quenching.  T - Decent malt, creamy sweetness at first then a blast of citrus hops! Very hoppy and pronounced and pretty much tingles your tongue for seconds after. Good balance and a good IPA if you like them...especially the more bitter ones.  M- Medium body, well carbonated and extremely fresh!  D- Very refreshing and could be a good session beer. I'm not even a huge IPA fan but I could see myself having a few of these. Would accommodate some great food very nicely.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T - I never really thought what a massive sweet core this one has, and so deftly squashed by the bitter of the hops. Good balance and begs for another taste.  M- Medium body, great carb and coating. Great Balance.  D - A classic. Quaffable to the extreme.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerSingh,4.17,"A : Clear golden colour with a massive crowning glory - the head lasted for the entire glass and left signature lacing  S : Lotsa hops, tropical fruits and zest. The smell really lingers on.  T : A big hug of hops up front, which eventually gives way to a nice malt balance. Can also taste some tart fruitiness at the end  M : Thin really, but the liveliness on the palate more than makes up for it. There is a lot going on  D : Great example of an IPA, so keep it coming. A great hop - malt balance really adds up to its drinkability",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,marvin213,2.47,"It's a murky yellow. It actually looks like a pilsner with dirt thrown in it. Were it not for the creamy white head, I'd think it's a contaminated beer. Though yellower than I expected, it's also more murky. It makes me think of cloudy piss. The lacing left as the foam settles let the hops be known.  The hops smell bitter and astingrent. The beer is straight hops. There's no fruitiness, no malty balance, and no additive novelty. It's like your original bitter. I think of liquor bitters. I think of Bitter Bill's face on the macro commercials. The nose is pure and unadulterated, but I offer no bonus points for that.  It's a plain beer and, although I love hoppy goodness, it's overly bitter and otherwise flavorless. I credit it for simplicity, but why would I repeatedly reach for plainness? It's bitter like an aspirin, and that's not cool.  The quality carbonation provides a fuzzy medium for the hops, so mouthfeel is the selling point. It's oddly the best thing about this bland beer. This is an overly simple IPA from a big-time brewery. I respect (and see most people on this site apprciate) a bland hop beer but I, for one, would like more on the medium of this feel.  I don't really like it, so I won't be drinking it much. It looks overbarleyed and tastes like a medicine while feeling as if it's soda. It's an eccentric experience--particularly for such a simple IPA--but that doesn't mean I'll revisit it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scottyshades,4.62,"A: Pours a transparent light color gold that creates a nice big, fluffy head that retains pretty damn well and leaves sheets of lacing along the pint glass.  S: Big hop profile, big malt profile! The hops are very aromatic and a lot more pleasant than I thought. They are perfectly balanced by a nice and sweet malt profile that really kicks this thing to the next level. Aside from the hops and malts, I pick up A LOT of honey.  T: Very similar to the nose. The hops are dominant, and more bittering than the nose would suggest. Malts balance perfectly. Honey is still very present, and a slight alcohol twang. Very floral, aromatic, sweet, and citrusy. I would give taste a 5 if only the alcohol was a little more discrete.  MF/D: Very smooth carbonation (perfect), medium in body, gives you that sticky mouthfeel effect, long honey/fresh hop finish!  Overall, definitely one of my favorite IPA's, and I really cannot say enough about Stone as a brewery...never a shortage of amazement",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Also, the lacing on this beer is magnificant, its in abundance all up and down the glass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,natelocc787,3.6,"Well balanced IPA. Lots of grapefruit and orange character in this one. Nice head, good lacing and nice grapefruit aroma. By well balanced I don't mean malt and hops I mean citrus and pine flavors derived from the choice of hops. Okay, hops and malt too. Medium body, medium carbonation. Crisp and oily. Good solid choice but a little overrated in my book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WeedKing4,4,"Aug 26, 2009 12oz bottles. Pours a slight cloudy yellow colour. A nice hop punch to it, quite tasty and smooth. Doesn't live up to the hype though.

A-Poured a clear golden-amber hue with a two finger, foamy eggshell white head that receded into an abundant, sticky lace. Gorgeous appearing.  S-Wow. One of the most fragrant IPAs I have enjoyed. Normally, this much aroma is only found in DIPAs. Piney and citrus hops, especially grapefruit are very prominent, aggressive, and inviting.  T-Hoppy bitterness is very citric, especially grapefruit and lemony esters, and full flavored. There is also a very slight, but welcome, bready malt backbone balancing this aggressive, perhaps the quintessential, West Coast IPA.  M-Very smooth and well balanced. Nice carbonation level and complexion. Extremely well crafted for a beer with 77 IBUs and 6.9% ABV.  D-Exceedingly drinkable for an aggressively hoppy IPA. Drinks well cold and warmer. An excellent IPA, quickly becoming a favorite of mine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,WalrusJockey,4,"A- very light, bright, clear, light almost-yellow-but-not-yellow golden color with a near-white head.  S- lots of citric and tropical fruits as the aromatic hops dominate the nose and produce a huge bouquet.  T- much more bitter than the nose announced, right off the bat. A dash of funkiness provides a contrasting note to the tannic bitterness. Swallow is clean, and the aftertaste is lingering, floral, aromatic sweet hops.  M- good body, solid presence in the mouth, satisfying texture.  D- decent. Too aggressively hopped to be a session beer, for me.  Over-all: pretty good. Once it starts warming up, though, I think it will be too bitter for me to really enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brewdlyhooked13,4.17,"Appearance - pours an unassuming golden color with a dense finger of creamy dull white bubbles. Excellent shiny lace bands and patches stick to the glass as the head recedes.  Aroma - intensely pine and grapefruit zest.  Taste - brief malt presence, slightly caramel. Zesty bitter hops, more grapefruit present than in the sniff. Very hop dominated as advertised, though not as dry a finish as I expected. Continues to increase in bitterness on the aftertaste and finish, just peeking into mediciney flavor when it fades at last. Just about ideal on hop usage I'd say. I'm more of a citrusy IPA fan but this is good.  Mouthfeel - solid body and carbonation, a touch oily. Nicely done.  Drinkability - the sixer disappeared quickly, I had to hold this last one off to review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Offa,3.02,"This is ok, slightly with some malty sweetness to round out the hoppiness. However, it is still rather simple, straightfoward in citrusy hops, and too rough on the hops, a sharp, rough hop bitterness with little real flavour taking over in the finish, drying out my mought and making my tongue and throat feel like someone energetically rubbed them with a terrycloth towel.  It orange gold, it has a thin, white head shrinking to a foamy ring and a little weak lace.  The aroma is mostly citrusy hops, especially grapefruit, with a hint of pine.  The taste is again mostly citrus - grapefruit - with pine and a light raisiny grain sweetness underneath, but not quite enough to carry it. It's far too bitter, with some malty sweetness to balance and a grain element in the finish, but too unbalanced and sharply bitter. Making a beer, even an IPA really bitter, simply does not to me equal good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brewdoc75,4.62,"Picked up a sixer of this when I was in WI.  A: Yellowish orange with solid, but not too much carbonation. Bright white 1 inch head on top. Drifts down to a lace quickly.  S: Tangerine and orange with a hint of pine. Slight honey sweetness. Strong aromatics  T: Beautiful hop profile with orange, tangerine, grapefruit and even some pine. Very flavorful. The malts are present, but more w/ a light, honey sweetness. Definitely a West Coast IPA. A strong bitterness in the end, but doesn't stick around too long.  M: Lighter bodied IPA w/ good carbonation. Crisp and clean.  D: An exceptional IPA with fabulous flavors. Would like a hint more aroma though. The appearnce was solid, but not the amount of head I was looking for. Overall, this is a hop lovers dream, with tons of hoppy flavors. A showcase of the American hop as it should be. I will buy this again and again. Please start distributing in Minnesota.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kpoole25,4.3,"12 oz bottle to glass. Clear yellow-orange, soapy head, lacing is great. Smell is good, juicy fruit and some spice.

Very drinkable, well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kylegillick,4.32,"Appearance: an ever so slightly hazy golden pour with a nice 2 finger head  Smell: Well its certainly an IPA. You can taste sweet hops in the smell. Seem like a few herbs and spices made they're way in with the hops.  Taste: Hops, spices and herbal galore. Maybe a litte pine and grapefruit in there too. hints of sweetness that warms your core. man its good.  Mouthfeel: its bitter, yet it encompasses just the right amount of smoothness to go down right. This IPA leaves jsut the right amount of hoppy flavor in your mouth when you done.

147,88,Gambrinus1184,4.24,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass. (went for an east meets west sort of vibe)  A: Poured a very clean golden amber color with a slight orange tinge and a nice, fluffy, one and a half finger head of dense white foam which leaves some nice sticky lace.  S: Big, sweet grapefruits and very herbal hop aromas with the heavy scent of pine.  T: Taste is sweet and nicely malty at first, with a quick flash of toasted roll and wheat before the rush of burning, sweet, citrusy hops floods the palate. The finish is big pine and grapefruit with loads of oily resins sticking around for a burning aftertaste. Produces burps like the pilot light went out.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied and really quite creamy. This enhances the malt flavor to add a little more balance to the big hop flavors.  D: Hey now, that's a drinkable IPA! Pretty good balance and a super creamy mouthfeel for a fruity and hoppy ale. The 6.9% ABV is manageable for a session, but I could see doing a lot of damage with this one.  Just a little bit smoother than DFH 60 minute with an extra kick. A really great intro brew for strangers to Stone looking to start out with some of the big guns.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This is an excellent beer all around, very complex and flavorful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Thur123,4.3,LOOK - A light copper orange with lots of lacing so far and a white foamy head. Looks to be quite carbonated.  SMELL - A dry bitter hoppy smell with a citrus edge that is grassy and sweet smelling. The malt offers the nose a bit more sweetness then I expected. A bit orangey.  TASTE - Hops hit first with the floral bitterness that instantly share the space with a lemony citrus taste. The back end is more bitterness again. Well balanced.  MOUTH FEEL - Nice and thick enough to deliver the taste all over.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,quinnsi,3.75,"Appearance is hazy orangish yellow with 3 fingers of head that dissipates to about 1/2 a finger.  Smells of floral hops and resiny pine. Little to no citrus on the nose, let alone any malt.  As far as taste goes, hops are the show here, starting with a mild bite and slowly becoming more aggressive in the mid palate, where the first signs of a slight malt flavor also make themselves known. The aftertaste has some of that same malt sweetness, but begins to get pushed out by the ever increasing hoppiness, which lingers on and on.  Mouthfeel is nice, with significant bite from the hops. Medium carbonation works well with the rest of the beer. I could have one of two tops before my tongue begin to beg for mercy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HitokiriNate85,4.2,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip pint.  A - Poured a nice tawny gold. Completely clear with a really nice, frothy white head. Not much visible carbonation at all except for some lazy guys floating to the surface every few seconds. Leaves some lacing.  S - This is what I've been drinking for the last few days, and I've been trying to get a good handle on the nose. Citrus notes are dominant. Orange peel and grapefruit, but while they're fragrant, they aren't overpowering. The smell is very similar to grated orange peel. Some light, bready malt is detectable in the background.  T - The hops are slightly herbal, but they're mostly dominated by citrus flavors. Orange rind and a sort of tangerine note lead into some really nice bitterness that's more reminiscent of fruit pith. Like the smell, it's not overpowering. This is all matched by a pretty light malt profile that's pretty sweet and slightly doughy.  MF - Pretty thin. When I first cracked the case, I thought it was too thin, but previous to that I went through a case of Green Flash IPA, which is much more full bodied. I enjoy the feel a lot more now. It's thin with light carbonation and pretty slick. Fairly sticky.  D - The best. Probably THE most drinkable beer I know. It finishes only slightly sweet and a bit dry, which brings me right back in. A big reason for my purchase was knowing how crisp and refreshing it was.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,woosterbill,4.15,"12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Bright, hazy amber-gold body topped by half an inch of fine white foam; decent retention and good lacing. Pretty standard.  S: Initial wave of deep, resinous hops - definitely grapefruit - followed by some dry biscuity malt and some floral hops to boot. Quite nice.  T: Pretty straightforward hop goodness, with a brief glow of round sweetness in the middle drowned out with an overwhelming (but entirely welcome) tide of pure hop bitterness on the finish. Delicious, and exactly what I expect from a serious IPA.  M: Medium bodied with great carbonation - full and soft. The hops scrub the palate clean with every sip. Great.  D: So purely bitter that this really isn't all that sessionable - I had two last night at a party, and then decided to switch to something with a lower ABV and a more balanced flavor profile. I prefer to savor this hop bomb at my leisure.  Notes: All around, this is a terrific IPA, and I'm very excited to be able to get it in CT now; however, there are other IPAs that I prefer, especially for the price (I think we're getting gouged as a new market, as the six pack I picked up last night cost $14 with tax and deposit - pretty steep). I'll probably only get this one on tap from now on, but I'll definitely be keeping my eye out for it.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ek0nomik,3.87,"Poured In: Tulip Glass Purchased At: Steve's Liquor (Madison, WI)  Appearance: Pours a nice, quite clear, golden yellow color. A finger of head sits at the top of my glass. As the head dies down with the amount of beer in my glass, I'm left with with a few bubbles on top that look mouth drooling hop oily. Oh, and the lacing on this is covering my glass. A good sign.  Smell: The nose is fantastic. A very strong citrus aroma is hopping out of this beer. A mixture of orange and grapefruit, but mostly grapefruit on this.  Taste: A nice blend of caramel malt makes its appearance first. Following the malt comes a wave of hops and their oils. A mixture of orange and grapefruit make their appearance. I'm left with a nice hop aftertaste which is mostly earthy, a blend of pine, soil and some grapefruit zest. Then comes the alcohol. Is it supposed to be shining through like this? I doubt it. The alcohol aftertaste is really showing its head, and this is only a high end six percent beer.  Mouthfeel: I really wish there was just a tad less carbonation on this. This beer goes down smoothly, but when it first splashes across the palate the carbonation is a bit much, and I wish it was just a tad less to make it a little more creamy.

Hops are very fresh tasting; grassy, earthy, spicy and floral all at the same time. Malt is imperceptible under the hop assault.

The quality Stone puts into every minute detail is extraordinary!!!! If only every American company could model themselves afer Stone...we'd find ourselves in a new era on the global stage.  As soon as the bottle is opened, there's no sense of balance whatsoever, unless your idea of balance is hoppy. On the nose, in the pour, in the color, lacing....all denotes hops. Just a brief hint of maltiness in the middle, then more hops in the finish. That malt and of course the IPA are the only differences between this and Ruination.

147,88,drperm,2.9,"Stone, what did you do? I'm disappointed in you.  Appearance: VERY cloudy, almost looks like a hefeweizen in my glass. It's got more dull-glow apricot than shiny pumpkin in the hue department.  Aroma: Syrupy up front, with a hit-over-the-head of grapefruit and tangerine hops.  Taste: Syrupy pine needles (or is that sap?) meet over-the-top dry (or is that raw?) hops of the extreme grapefruit variety. This is a dog with a loud bark. The bite, though, reveals it to be of the little-and-yappy variety.  Palate: How can a 6.9% ABV brew with a syrupy start be *thin*? I'm not sure, but this one certainly is. And the doggone grapefruit trope only contributes to the illusion that I'm actually drinking (thin) fresh-squeezed juice.  Overall: I love the Stone Brewery. Arrogant Bastard, Oaked AB, Levitation...but this one, not so much. You guys missed the mark here.

Incredible lacing. This beer really looks near perfect.  I could smell this one the second I cracked the top. Huge hop aroma. Citrus and piney, this is what makes American IPA great. Just enough fuity, alcoholy malt underneat to not be a total hop bomb. This is the definition of the style.  Taste is, of course, of bitter, orange and lemony hops. They are spicy, just a bit sour like grapefruit and balanced oh so well by a backbone of doughy, light and crisp malt. Fills your mouth with great flavor! I was in total happiness drinking this. I could barely put it down...  Great mouthfeel. Oily, but not overdone. Coats the whole palate nicely. Drinkability is HUGE. I wish I savored this bomber a bit more, in fact.

I had to pull a glass from my dishwasher, which needs to be cleaned of lime deposits, so all I'm getting is the lime smell from the terrible local water. The taste had a very pronounced hop bite up front, and it's missing the bad after taste that some IPA's have that I find unappealing. It's a very smooth ale, that might be a little light in the mouthfeel. But overall this is one of my favorite AIPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Lingering bitterness is pleasant  M: A medium-to-light bodied beer that's finishes cleanly with the hops. Lightly carbonated  D: I could definitely down a few more of these, a top-notch IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MisterSH,4.63,"12oz bottle with no freshness date. I like stone's labels but on an overly critical note, I must say the font they use on the bottle's neck is a little bit corny-looking.  Pours a straw/gold, with an exceptionally long lasting 1.5 finger head, leaving some of the most amazing lacing I've ever seen. This beer looks fantastic.  Aroma is dominated by resiny pine, with some citrus notes and whiffs of a fruity malt.  First taste impression is of spicy, pungently bitter American hops. Grapefruit is present , the malt backbone of the beer is strong and steps into the forefront in the second act, offering a bready, distinctly earthy finish that is crisp and refreshing.  Mouthfeel is on point, moderate carbonation, very clean, fairly light in body and not overly oily.  I have not had this old favorite in some time now, and tasting it again I find it every bit as delicious as I remembered. Exceptionally delicious, it is crisp and ideally balanced. I find the malt profile of this beer slightly unusual with a welcome earthiness, rounding things out perfectly and setting this brew apart from its peers. In my mind an exemplary American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mikel52588,4.1,"Appearance: An orangish yellow gold. Somewhere between a beastly 2.5- 3 finger length head, lacing remains and slides slowly down the glass  Smell: has a definite sweet and caramel, hop filled aroma, theres also a lemony citrus that really fills your nose  Taste: the bitter hops don't hide themselves at all, they come right for your taste buds, but leaves a nice creamy sensation on your tongue as the beer moves down your throat. There like a hint of sweetness underneath this strongly bitter ipa along with a citrusy flavor  Mouthfeel: its smooth, and the bitter hops come out more in the aftertaste with feel. The soapy carbonation tickles your tongue.  Drinkability: It has a decent drinkability depending on what you like, if you are into the less malty bitter ipa's you will definitely like this one. Even though it has a lot of bitter to deliver it still is smooth and creamy, which, to me, stands out. Id prefer it had a little bit more maltiness to it, but don't get me wrong its definitely good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,craftaholic,4.15,"Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz into a standard pint, the first thing you notice is the head. Easily 3 finger length with room to spare that turns into a thick fluffy soap-like lacing that slides down the glass like a slugtrail. The color is a translucent straw yellow with not a hint of carbonation in sight after initial pour.  Smell: The aroma is a nice bouquet of hops, herbaceous and citrusy they sure smell delightful. There are some esters that fight through but the hops reign supreme on this one.  Taste: Has a nice hop character which really pleases a hop head like me. The hops have it all from grassy to piney and even some citrus. There is also a side of grain and biscuit like characters that come out to play. Past the bountiful bitter lies a trace of sweetness which is then covered up like a bad habit upon notice.  Mouthfeel: Super smooth and quite creamy, leaves behind that signature 'bastard was here' stamp on your palate.  Drinkability: This is a staple IPA in my opinion, goes down easy and drinks like a big boy brew at only 6.9 abv%  Overall: Hopheads abound this is your beer, has enough bitter but isn't face puckering. Drops the bomb and laughs in your face for it. Prefer a less hopped beer well as stone would say. 'youre not worthy'",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ThatWineGuy,4,"I will have to be more careful when I scoop from the singles bin: this one was best before May 17, 2009 (about four months ago). Regardless, it turned out to be a very good beer just the same, just not a high spirited IPA I might have otherwise have enjoyed. Poured a hazy, orange-tangerine gold with a half finger white head. A cloudy centre remained with a good ring, spotty lace. Smell of citrus hops, sweet and fruity, bit of rind in the mix. Taste is still hop forward although grapefruit affect muted for the most part; still there is a discernible citrus taste with sufficient bitterness and plenty of biscuit malt in the finish. Mouthfeel still has a lot of liveliness, hoppy but with an even, balanced acidity and nice texture. Very drinkable. A nice IPA even though its' best days were behind it, love to try it again fresher sometime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,birchstick,3.23,"Reviewed on tap at Spitzer's in NYC.  A - poured a golden copper with a very nice head  S - smelled of sweet malt and a load of hops  T - the malts that are present are quickly overtaken by the piney, bitter hops. This was pretty unbalanced and too bitter to make it enjoyable.  M - goes down smoothly and a little thin  D - average drinkability. If you dislike super bitter IPAs, stay clear of this one; otherwise, I think you'l enjoy this one. Personally, I thought this was okay - it was very bitter at first but after a couple of drinks the bitterness became tolerable. Definitely not a bad IPA, just okay.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jrallen34,3.03,I drank this from a bottle into a chalice.  This beer pours a light gold semi clear with a big white and very good lacing.  Its aroma is very hoppy with light notes of honey and citrus.  The taste is just overwhelmingly hoppy. Thats all that dominates throughout the whole tasting instead of a very nice bite at the end. Just too bitter to be a great IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thespaceman,4.42,"Finally got my first Stone Beer down in Rehoboth Beach, DE - even though CT is now getting in Stone, I couldn't wait to give this a go.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass:  Appearance: A beautiful deep orange in color, a tall, soap like head sits atop this very pretty looking brew. Lacing and head retention are spot on all the way around.  Smell: Very flowery hop aromas, grapefruit, hop oil. Clean in the nose, a pungent like citrus element dominates throughout. No malt is detected, I love when an IPA smells fresh like this one.  Taste: Citrus properties like grapefruit and passionfruit are key players here, hops run rampant on the tongue and its clean and invigorating. Resinous, yet well reserved. Again, there isn't any malt detectible and this is how a real IPA should be. A nice tiny bite of alcohol in the finish really warms up your stomach upon sipping. The clean bite of the hops on this one reminds me alot of Hop Stoopid, except the IBU's on this one are far more reserved which makes this a more refreshing offering. Perfect all around.  Mouthfeel: Very generous amount of hop bitterness here, not over the top, but just enough to make your taste buds feel it. Medium bodied, sits very firm on the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: One of my top 3 IPA's of all time, it's a shame I am trying this beer so late (As of right now Stone is finally available in my neck of the woods) - At 6.9% ABV this is very drinkable. If you looked up the definition of IPA in the dictionary, this beer should come up. An excellent pursuit for the hop cravers out there with all the right elements to make this a regular in anybodys fridge. I can't wait to see what else I have in store from the brewers at Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,apbarwood,4.77,"A warm, orange-gold color with a rocky white head that clings to the side of the glass like few others. A generous amount of lace covers the beer to the last drop. The aroma is absolutely incredible. Unbelievably strong and showing a nice depth of citrus flavors, most noticeably grapefruit. The taste is a beautiful display of hop character with a juicy explosion of grapefruit and an unyielding dryness that is hard to beat. As it warmed up, the flavors really softened and blended harmoniously, but still packed quite a wallop. Despite it's relatively high ABV and strong hop bitterness, I found this extremely drinkable and pleasant. A perfect beer for summertime or spicy food or both. I'll definitely be drinking this again and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beer348,5,"I started the evening with a black butte porter (bottle) -- great beer.. then I tried a Stone IPA. I had never had it before but I could tell after the first drink that it was good. Actually it was a great beer , very easy to drink . Can't wait to try it again . Wasn't as good the 2nd time.. seems more of a summer beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lazyslacker,4.29,"I've been wanting to try a Stone beer for a little while. Poured into a pint glass, color is straw-yellow with off-white head about 3/4 of an inch thick. Bubbling is apparent at first. It's a little hazy.  smell - amazing hoppy aroma. very piney, a little spicy, kind of bready, like Columbus. Kind of nature-y. I can't describe it better than that. It's pretty complex. I don't have a good nose. But it smells very good.  taste - Starts with a light malty sweetness then a large burst of hoppy taste. Definitely a large amount of bitterness. Really hop-heavy but very tasty just the same. More crispy, piney sort of character in the hoppy taste that persists through swallowing and the after taste. Very dry over all.  Mouthfeel - let it sit for a little while and it gets much better than when it's first poured. the carbonation leaves it to some degree and it's smooth. Very satisfying mouthfeel - a little thick but not too much. Really feels like you're drinking something substantial. However, it isn't what you would call refreshing, really.  drinkability - Not great but good. For people who are really into hops it's great. For me personally a little too hoppy to have more than one at a time. Overall very satisfying. It's very tasty. You can tell it's a quality beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mwa423,4.47,"Had on tap at Bar Louie, dollar burgers on Wednesdays, can't beat that.  A- slightly hazy gold with a nice head with an excellent lacing.  S- A great but not overpowering hop aroma that makes your mouth beg for a sip.  T-very hop forward but backed up by a healthy malt backbone. This is the quintessential ipa!  M/D - fantastic, I can't say much else",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OlieIPA,3.59,"Picked up at Stone Brewing the other night and shared with fellow beer lovers.  A: One of the most impressive looking heads I've ever seen from a beer...WOW! This white butter-cream colored head, which had a soapy/rice cracker quality to it, helped enclose a golden malt body. Oh yeah...the lacing was minimal.  S: A lot of fatty/diacetyl and musky organic honey aroma. It really didn't smell like an IPA at all, due to the fact I unable to detect any strong or robust hop smells from it. It reminded of a pale ale more than anything...and an above average aroma at best.  T: Mild hop bitterness with sweet and wheat like malts to back it up; nothing to complex...but nice given that fact.  M: Nothing too much to complain about here...good carbonation and body seemed to fit the style.  D: Even though this didn't remind me of a west coast IPA, there was still a quality that was ""nice"" and easy to drink about this particular IPA.  Overall: Stone's IPA was one of those beers that got me into craft beer. Now, after a year or two into the beer scene...I still find myself enjoying this beer...just not as much I used too. A try it beer. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,burnerfinger,4.52,"AHHH what a treat.  A: Healthy thick head that tastes very hoppy. Settles down to beautiful lacing. Just right. Bright amber color, a bit cloudy when cold. (seems to clear up nicely when warm)  S: Slams you over the head with 100% hops. Really strong Hops aroma.  T: ALL HOPS. I really dont note the alcohol not the Malt. I've yet to try ruination, but I wonder how Stone will be able to get anything hoppier than this. hops at the start, hops down the gullet, and a marked late hoppy after taste that is more than a bit dry.  M: full body, Plenty of carbonation.  D: This is not going to be a sesson beer...but great to savor the full clear hops flavor. This has got to be the epitome of the IPA style. hophead's delight. additional note: this comes in at 6.9% - and the 1 pint 6 oz bomber gave me a decent buzz.

147,88,civilizedpsycho,3.82,"Poured bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Poured a dark gold color that was pretty clear. It did have a nice 1-finger head.  Smell: It had a nice hop aroma with some fruit scents which I couldn't quite identify, but noticed immediately.  Taste: Not too bitter as with some IPAs. On the contrary, it's somewhat sweet and smooth with some fruit in the background.  Mouthfeel: It had a thin, but fair body from the carbonation.  Drinkability: This is pretty good. I feel I've had some better IPAs, but this one is certainly a quality beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PizzaQueen1,4.5,"This is one of my favorite IPA's. It pours nicly with a great golden amber color, and if poured corectly, a nice pillow of foam for a head. The aroma is filled with citrus, florals and hops witch make that first taste a flavor explosion. Hops and Hops with a little citrus sweetness. Very Nice. As the beer warms it gets even better. It smoothes out with even my of that great sweet taste. Good feel in the mouth leaves you wanting more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,oldpinecone,4.07,"Poured into a pintglass.  Delicious delicious delicious.  Pours a great amber color with a nice 2 finger head that stays for a while and leaves great lacing.  Citrus smells were very apparent and gave me something to look foward to. It smelled like an orange, grapefruit and softball sized hop nugget were mashed together.  Taste was great. Super hoppy. Not as much citrus as the smell might have suggested but the hops were definetly kicking my ass. Great bitterness that stuck around. No malt tastes just pure goodness.  Mouthfeel was awesome. It was aggresive but perfectly balanced. Great for an IPA of this calibur.  Drink this beer all day and all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mklinger,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an English pint glass.  A: Deep golden color. Extremely clear with nice amount of visible bubbles flowing through. One finger head composed of larger than average sized bubbles in the foam. Head dissipated fairly quickly & left a little lacing on the glass. By appearance, there is nothing all the great about this beer. It's fine looking, but with large bubbles and modest head.  S: Quite nice aroma. All hops, nothing really noteworthy in terms of malt, but the hops, oh the hops, smell very nice. Lots of those wonderful American hop character -- bright citrus, more orange and lemon than grapefruit, slightly sweet. An appetizing aroma.  T: Like an IPA should be, the flavor is also all about the hops. A nice balance of bitterness, which is assertive, not whap you upside the head, but nicely assertive. Well balanced with the bright dry hopping flavor. Nice bit of malt to balance it out, too. Very nice!  M: Crisp, somewhat dry beer just as an west coast IPA should be. Nice degree of carbonation.

I now see it's stamped on the back of the bottle near the bottom - 09 15 09. cutting it close for my blood, but should still be ok.  A: golden with just a hint of amber, bright white dense head, drops down but leaves great lace.  S: pale malt, hints of sweet orange, spicy and earthy hops - not quite as hoppy as I'd expect from the taste, but probably toned down a bit due to age.  T: solid entry-way and classic IPA, one of my favorites, especially fresh. this example has turned a bit for my liking, but still good. crisp with orange and grapefruit predomination, minimal light malt sweetness to balance  M: nice and crisp, refreshing but not over-carbonated  D: super high.. very refreshing on the hot day",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MaxBrews,4.47,"Presentation: 12oz silk screened bottle poured into mug.  Appearance: Pours an actually pale color compared to most IPAS. Golden to yellow in color. Completely transparent. In the pouring process you form a nice foamy head that dissipates slowly into a rocky lacing that clings to the glass like crazy. Proper IPA stuff here.  Smell: You can really smell the hop oil on this one. Extremely floral, citrus-like, pine/pineapple. The smell is all hops. Fantastic smelling ones too.  Taste: This is a very hoppy beer indeed. You get a lot of citrus flavors, pineapple, lemon, orange. Its grassy and somewhat earthy. Its dominated by hops, but some how not too much. You don't get much from the malt, but with hops this good why would you need to. When it does warm up enough to taste the malt, its the standard high quality pale malt.  Mouthfeel: Standard IPA bitterness but not insanely bitter as you would expect from the flavor. A very pleasant beer to put in your mouth if you love big character, which I do!  Drinkability: Every company is pushing for their IPA to bigger and badder then the next. They all do it slightly differently, but stone delivers with a very hoppy IPA thats not overly bitter. It has all the flavor you want from an IPA, without any of the things many companies do wrong with this style. For me being introduced to the world of stone, I may have to reconsider my favorite IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JTWILDOATS,4.1,"Out of about thirty different IPAs that I have tried, this is my most favorite one. The light fruity aroma, accompanied by the rich golden hue already gives the drinker something great to look forward to (and we haven't even talked about the taste yet!). A thin layer of head stays present from beginning to end.  The taste grows as it travels from your pallet to your throat. The balanced flavor between richness and bitterness is something that many IPAs fail to achieve. This one though does everything perfectly. The bitterness immediately follows after the sip and resonates in the rear of your mouth for an extended period of time, something that is not commonly experienced.  The fairly high percentage of alcohol is not overtly present at the end of the swallow. The taste lingers until finally it concludes on its own volition. I reccommend this to anyone curious about IPAs, or are in need of trying something new and different.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Apellonious,4.28,"Pours a golden color, with a thin lace that hangs on the glass. Slightly cloudy.  A big sniff brings a grassy, hoppy smell, with some floral notes.  Tastes of strong hops, but not overwhelming. It has a sharp bite to it, but has an overall smoothness that makes it very drinkable. The mouthfeel is substantial, and the aftertaste hits the middle back of the tongue . Some slight fruity overtones (though not as prevalent as Stone's regular pale).  As the beer warms, it becomes sweeter, and more complex taste wise, but the hops are still all powerful . This the perfect beer for hop heads, or someone that after another long drudged-out work day wants that one or two beer buzz to take the edge off and settle in to relaxation mode.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BierFan,4.18,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Thick layer of off-white foam. Good retention. Clear golden body. Good lacing. Looks amazing.

Quite possibly the best American IPA I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Something nice and spicy in there as well.  T&M - Smack in the tongue with the piney hops. A bit puckering, but what a wonderful flavor. Some lemon zest and rind in there that purses that lips but also refreshes the tongue, priming it for the next sip. Medium carbonation for a smooth mouthfeel that is a bit syrupy and sticky as it warms.  D - My tongue and mouth say ""no more"" but the tastebuds gotta have it. Wonderful flavor and not too harsh in any of the flavors. Nicely balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Only a hint of malt and some sweet light fruit. Tastes outright heavily hopped, with notes of dish soap predominant. Maybe it's the mixture of citrus and resin, but whatever the taste is, it's unpleasant. Gets better as it warms and as the palette gets numb to it. Pleasant sweet malt eventually shows through. Medium body. I don't know what it is about the hops Stone uses---I really enjoy other IPAs and DIPAs, but both this and Ruination have had the same soapy quality, and I'm not a big fan.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Mild carbonation with fine bubbles.  S - Clear hops, with light fruits. There is definite orange notes, and a lemony sharpness coming through.  T - The first flavours are fruity, predominantly lemon. Then it's all hops, providing a leveled bitterness to the end. The taste is quite earth, and the grassy hops add to this.  M - Quite light and fizzy on the tongue.

147,88,katan,3.95,"12 oz bottle into a pint  A - Pours a filtered, clear, bubbling light orange color. Head formation is bright white, not strong. Retained in a strong film however.  S - A strong bouquet of american hops, floral, grapefruit, but yet earthy. Some spicy notes as well. Reminds me of some simcoe or amarillo.  T - Starts with only the lightest milisecond of a malt note which is immediately bombed by an outright bitter finish. Comes across very dry, some alcohol warming. American hops dominate the mid-stream, more earthy than the nose. Finishes with a mega flourish of bitter bite, dry, and lots of hop character. Grassy at times.  M - The dry overly fermented style bites the tongue pretty hard - causing a mouthfeel on the thin side. Carbonation bite is light. Aftertaste is mega oily from the hops.  D - Moderately drinkable - the abv is pretty potent for the style, and the hop attack is just a bit wearing to be a sessionable beer.

Wow, full on grapefruit in the flavour produces a hop explosion in the mouth. Even with the hop profile a little past its peak this beer still produces big time, resulting in pretty high bitterness. It actually still tastes really fresh to me (because of the dominance of the hops, and there's a nice resin aftertaste. Thankfully, the flavour is nicely balanced by caramel malts (what a classic combo grapefruit and caramel has become!).

Aroma: huge citrusy hop nose. i have yet to come across a beer that caputures the essence of fresh hops like this one does. magnificent.  Taste: wonderfully bitter with slightly malty undertones. the hops dominate, as they should.  Mouthfeel: smooth  Drinkability: too good. even at 7% abv, they're easy to drink. i may get in trouble w/ too many of these.  Overall: easily the best IPA i've ever had. like hop flowers in a glass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,greengorilla,4.92,"I poured this from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. It is a light golden color with a one finger thick white head with excellent lacing to the end of the glass.  The smell just knocked me out. It just makes my mouth water. The floral hops smell was incredible.  The taste followed the smell. It was hops from start to finish with a hint of pine in there somewhere.  The mouthfeel was very good too. This beer is incredibly drinkable period, but insane for a 6.9% abv. I was only planning on having one, but couldn't stop.  This is a great beer. I think it is the best IPA that I have had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,carolinabeerguy,4.32,"Appearance: Poured a golden amber with a 1 inch white head. Excellent lacing throughout.  Smell: Very strong hops with a bit of citrus. Very pleasant aroma with a hint of pine.  Taste: Very strong hops up front. Very nice bitter citrus flavor throughout.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and very smooth.  Drinkability: Excellent drinakbility. Too bad the handle on my 6 pack broke while I was checking my mail, breaking all but one of these bad boys. I'll definitely be buying more.  Overall: I'd rate this very high. One of the best IPAs I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thecarster1,4.33,"a- bomber poured into a pint, one inch head, orangey light brown coloring, not overly carbonated, great looking bottle with the definition, really nice.  s- not overly strong, wafts of grapefruit, pine, spice.  t- soo tasty, spicy, tangy, traditional grapefruit rind and pine but kicked up a notch, with a great backbone of caramel malt.  m- medium body.  d- so drinkable, easily one of the best ipa's i've ever had, am definately planning on buying some more to stock the fridge up, i could session this almost too easily.  this is the perfect beer for my 50th review!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DeathbySexyBT,4.58,A: Bright gold with perfect lacing and a perfect head that remains throughout.  S: This cask had Amarillos added to it and even the most novice of beer drinkers can smell them immediately. Fruity notes as well as herbs.  T: Hop spice up front. The beautiful thing about this cask is that by adding the Amarillos another dimension was added without obliterating the other flavors.  M: Bubbly and happy. You will feel and taste the Amarillo hops for some time after this beer is finished.  D: I marked the drinkability down half a point on this because I am not sure if I would want to drink Amarillo hops all evening.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Great, classic IPA look. 4.5  S Grapefruit hops predominate but there is an interesting sweetness there as well. It reminds me a lot of Levitation which I really enjoyed. 4.0  T Well the hops are delivered but in a reasonably balanced way. There is a nice sugary malt balance to the grapefruit hops that was suggested in the smell.  M Moderate as the hops beef it up.  D Good. I could have several of these.  Notes: Now I know why this beer gets so much attention from ""hop heads"" as it is delicious and drinkable while featuring the hops. At the risk of entering hyperbole, this is a masterfully done IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thain709,4.13,A - A clear golden body...poured a white rocky head that fell into a spotty cap...laced the entire glass  S - Solid piney hops...not as big on the nose as I expected  T - This is a pretty balanced IPA...the hops hit your tongue right away and they do not leave...there is a constant bitterness from start to finish...but there is a very strong malty backbone...the malts play a pretty big role in this beer...but they don't steal the show...when you let this one warm up the malts knock the bitterness down actually  M - Medium bodied...crisp and refreshing  D - A very nice IPA...balanced and crisp...making this a very sessionable IPA...but if I were to chose between this and Ruination...Ruination would win hands down,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells of a fresh cascade and galena hop w/ just a touch of yakima magnum and ripened honey dew melon.  Taste is a sharp blend of alpha and melon rind blended with a nice cara-pil malt. Really appetizing. This would be great w/ some spicey food!  Exceptional mouthfeel and drinkability. Could down quaite a few of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,david18,4,"A really good ipa, this is one i don't drink enough because it's so prevelant. I usually go for another ipa, if that's what i'm in the mood for, or another stone, if that's what i'm looking for. In any case, a very good ipa and one you should fully consider if it's available.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,drabmuh,4.6,"Stone IPA is one of, well, it is my favorite beer. I can drink a Stone IPA and completely change my mood. Stone is probably the best example of an American IPA available. I've made IPAs a focus of my beer drinking and sampling and I can say without hyperbole, this is a great beer. Of course it is better on draught than in the bottle, but I had a 12 oz bottle of it served in my Stone IPA glass. Medium head, strong aroma of cascade hops, dark yellow, clear (although sometimes the bottles are cloudy). Excellent mouthfeel, a great amount of hops but the bitterness is not overpowering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S-Nice pronounced hop nose with citrus clearly evident. Smells wonderful.  T-Crisp, spicy, bitter hop kick hits you right away, a very pleasant malty backbone is there but lingers in the background without overdoing it. Nice balance.  M-Once again crisp, yet creamy. A very nice combination. A great bitter hop bite combined with a not too sweet maltiness in the finish. Great mouthfeel.  D-Easily drinkable, I could have many of these in a session.  This is a very good IPA I have enjoyed (and will enjoy) many, many times.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,aaronxsubaru,4.35,"This is in my top 3 IPAs so far. This was very well balanced and very drinkable. i liked the citurs in it and the fact that the piney flavor was not overpowering. not sure about the pine-sol guy who gave it a D. I mean it has alot of hops which is on style, but i thought it was balanced well, and i've tried beers that tasted like pine sap, this is not one of them.  Go buy some and drink it. You will like it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brokensail,4.3,"A: Golden straw color with a small, very small, amount of white foam that dissipates quickly. Not much carbonation to speak of.  S: Lots of citrus, most notable is lemon. There is also a mild pine scent. Not much malt to speak of.  T: A wonderful and powerful bitterness. Very piney, but also slight lemony notes. Again, not much malt shining through.  M: Very crisp beer with a lingering bitterness.  D: Highly drinkable, but watch out for this one, it will bite when you're not looking at 6.9%.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S - Pine, citrus, and grapefruit with an earthy hop aroma. Hints of malt in the background.  T - Very smooth hopped taste with a citrus backbone. Plenty of pine and floral notes which round out the taste. Slight back end malt.  M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Bitter hops mouth feel.  D - Top shelf west coast IPA. One of the best. Great session beer even at 6.9% abv.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Been looking forward to trying this one...  A- Nice amber color, with 2-3 cm head which had good retention.  S- Smells like a solid IPA, very hoppy.  T- Incredibly well balanced malt and hop taste, slight fruity sweetness with lingering bitter finish that is not overpowering.  M- Medium carbonation but very very smooth, finish is dry secondary to hop profile.  D- Very good, wouldn't mind drinking this throughout the night, will be purchasing again soon. Personally I feel that this should be the gold sandard for IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kegger22,3.85,"Poured cloudy orange color with small head. I was not able to pick out much of an aroma. The taste was citrus and a hoppy bitterness (which I liked). I admit to not being a great IPA fan, but I did like this beer. So far, this one runs second to the AleSmith IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,oxnard111,4.01,"This is my first beer review so bare with me.  Severed on tap in a pint glass. Was served quite cold. I let it rest for about 15 minutes before smelling and tasting.  Beer poured a clear color a little lighter than honey. Pint glass was filled slowly to the top, so judging the head was hard. Once the glass was about half empty I was able to give a swirl and the head appeaedr about 1 finger tall. Head retention was good too. Stayed for good amount of time. Beer was a had a low amount of carbonation.  Smell was overall not very strong. Slight citrus aroma.  Mouthfeel was smooth. Pretty thin. Not thick or chewy at all.  Taste was great. Slight citrus taste. Slightly acidic with a background sweet taste. Bitterness was quite present. About a 5 out of 10 on the bitterness scale. Beer was very drinkable. Could imagine drinking this on a hot summer's day. I'm still learning about my other beer tastes and flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MVotter,4.47,"The Stone IPA pours into chalice a cloudy gold color with a thin cream-colored head.  The smell leads with citrus hops and even a whiff of malts.  The taste, like the aroma, opens with a strong hoppy presence, like a less-heavy version of a dipa ... and balanced with a slight roasted malt flavor.  The mouthfeel is medium and refreshing and an extremely pleasant experience ... nice effervescence and dryness, yum.  This is a very drinkable, tasty brew. The dry/hoppy quality make it a super drinker on an 88-degree summers day!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,terryt5231,4.65,"Great beer! This is the epitome of an IPA, in my opinion.  Drank this at Holy Smoke BBQ in Mahopac, NY. Bartender knows how to pour em, too.

Very happy and will certainly look for this bottled in my local beer store.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dstc,4.5,"Pours a clear, deep, golden color with a big, foamy, white head. Head falls slow and stays. Big lace.  With the first smell I took I noticed citrus immediately followed by the huge hop aroma.  Wow. Big hop taste. Sweet in the middle with a lingering hoppy bitterness in the finish.  Medium bodied and very smooth in the mouth, almost chewy.  Awesome. Very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,arnoldbrew,4.27,"Aroma- Nice golden/amber color. slightly cloudy/hazy. Poured with a 2cm head but faded quickly. Smell- Very citrusy, grapefruit, some pineapple. Taste- Hoppy, much like smell with the citrus and pineapple flavors. Nice bready maltines underneath the hops. Mouthfeel- Smooth and crisp, moderate mouthfeel, carbonation right where it should be. Overall- A very good beer, very hop forward which after reading the label is exactly what I expected "" . . big hop flavor . . . big hop aroma."" This is what I expect from an American IPA. Hoppy but not out of balance. Stone Brewing came through admirably.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jdmorgan,4,Pours an amber hue with a two-finger head. The smell is dominated by hop and citrus aromas with a bit of malt as well.  The taste has a bold hop flavor with some sharp citrus flavors as well. There is a medium malt body which is only slightly overpowered by the hops. The bitterness is medium/high in a pleasant way.  The mouthfeel is sharp initially with a clean citrus/hop flavor dominating. Carbonation is medium with a medium consistency. This is a fantastic IPA and I would tend to stay with it for a session. Another great beer from Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cvaypai,4.4,"Poured from bottle to tumbler.  Appearance - Golden-orange translucent. Looks like an IPA. 2 finger foamy head that has good retention as it slides down the glass.  Smell - Tons of citrus hops, probably one of the most citrus smelling IPA's I have had. Small amount of malt scent detected. Maybe a bit of pine, but the major smell here is hops.  Taste - Great citrus tastes, grapefruit, honey, lime, lemon, I catch it all in here. Great taste from a single ipa. For its bitterness and where it is from, surprisingly balanced. The malts are nice. Little bit of alcohol on the end.  Mouthfeel - Good mouthfeel, not amazing, maybe a bit overcarbonated. Good bitter bite for the style.  Drinkability - There is a ton of drinkability, really good session beer, I could drink a lot of these.  One of my staple single ipa's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goblue3509,3.92,Pours an orange color that is slightly hazy with a white fluffy two finger head. The head gives way to a little lacing. The smell is of hops with citrus much like pineapple juice and orange with a hint of floral. The taste is of hops with some citrus tons much of pineapple and orange again. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. The overall drinkability on this beer is extermely high.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Slatetank,4.23,"I had this IPA on tap at the Batdorf Restaurant in Annville, PA. Served chilled in a standard pint.  A - a mango nectar hued ale w/ 1 1/2 fingers of smooth snowy suds cap the beer. Mild haze w/ moderate lace on the glass the IPA has a fine bead  S - The scent of apricot + lychee w/ a floral note and grapefruit accent. The nose has a light herbal odor w/ a lot of citrus carrying the smell into west coast hop realm that is familiar and fragrant  M - A sharp hop bitterness is abrasive at first, but in a good way. Well seasoned w/ a spicy, highly bitter, focused feel but hey it's an IPA  T - A sweet tea like malt followed by a grapefruit rind w/ mellow tropical elements and grassy hop acidity that is lasting. The balance is not a word this Ipa ever heard of. The taste of dry apricot w/ a dry herbal/spiced taste that is crisp and allows for a lasting bitterness in the taste. The alcohol flavor comes forward as the glass nears 1/2 full, but still in check w/ a gently creamy malt layered under a dense array of hop flavors  D - A great West coast IPA one of the best w/ a dry and highly drinkable quality. The taste is still not intense for the sake of intensity -this is a classic example of an American IPA w/ a more bitter hop focus. I enjoyed this IPA it is easy to take large gulps of this, it is refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,krisandajt,4.15,"I am quite surprised I haven't reviewed this one yet... Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass...  Appearance: Pours a cloudy, light bronze-ish color with a nice inch of fluffy white head that slowly fades leaving behind some nice soapy lacing.  Smell: A nice subtle citrusy/grapefruit hoppiness, not overly pronounced but certainly enough to get your attention.  Taste: Like the smell, a nice bit of mildly bitter grapefruit mixed in with some very subtle malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, not over- or under-carbonated, with a medium body.  Drinkability: This IPA is one of my absolute favorites. I believe it emphasizes all the goodness that is an IPA without any single characteristic being overwhelming or offensive. This is one of my go-to IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,babaracas,4.47,"Pours a clear-ish amber with two finger white head, lacing but head collapses. Smell: full of citrus - lemon rind, bitter orange, grapefruit, pineapple juice, floral too!, with some malt sweetness in the background. Taste: also full of citrus - more grapefruit is prevalent here, orange, spiciness and a chill bready malt. Creamy and soft with a nice drying finish that is stopped short of puckering by the sweet malt backing up the citric hop punch. Fantastic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rapidsequence,4.47,"From a six pack.  Appearance: Slightly hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy little white head that leaves some sticky lacing in my pint glass.  Smell: Its just great. Hoppy- some sweet citrus and some grapefruit too. Like fruity hops candy.  Taste: Nice bitter punch with those hoppy citrus flavors. Its got great balance with the sweet maltiness. Goes down sweet and smooth and leaves some pleasing bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full for an IPA. Not syrupy or creamy. The carbonation is nice.  Drinkability: Hard to find much to fault it, really. Its great stuff. I'm pretty much a sucker for most of Stone's offerings. This one is a staple.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rugerj,4.45,"Beer pours copper in color with a nice 1 finger head that stays, wonderful lacing left in glass. The smell is all hops, sweet citrus, pine, grapefruit; they are all here and blend wonderfully. The taste is mostly hops with the citrus and pine flavors coming through; a touch of sweetness from the malt comes through ever so faintly and adds a nice subtle complexity to the beer. Carbonation was spot on and mouth feel was soft for the amount of hops in this beer.  A wonderful beer and one of my favorites. I can write nothing that has not already been said, a great beer and brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ExtraStout,4.5,"Pours a big, impressive froth that almost refuses to settle (which, of course, is a good thing). Leaves nearly enough lace to make it look like it didn't even settle! Copper to orange color. Absolutely beautiful hoppy aroma. Tons of floral and citrus character. In fact, it jumps out at you before you even finish opening the bottle. More citrus-like hop bitterness in the flavor, with some hints of spiciness and great malty undertones. Hops make it very smooth and crisp, and the bread-like maltiness underneath rounds it out quite well. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness as well. Dangerously drinkable! This is one wonderful brew. I'm loving every Stone brew I try with a passion! If you're just starting to love hops, this is a great step up from their pale ale if you're not quite ready for ""ruination"". And for the seasoned hophead, this is a wonderful treat and an exceptional brew all around! No matter who you are, try this! It will not fail to impress.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sophisticated,4.17,"A) Lovely orange-amber, minimal head but some lacing.  S) Citrusy hops, heavy on the pineapple, some pines/floral, but sweeter than some other IPAs, almost like a little caramel  T) Pure hoppy goodness. Starts sweeter, ends bitter. Definitely more of a citrus-hops flavor.  MF) Crisp and well carbonated  D) Extremely high, would never guess this had a higher than 5%ABV. I downed this extremely fast and wished for another!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TLove,3.99,"22oz bottle to a whiskey glass.  Appearance - Has a decent, very bubbly head with some light lacing and a clearish light orange color. Pretty average.  Smell - Grapefruit and lime citrus with some raisin and oats to round out the smell.  Taste - Sticky and smooth, with a light floral grasp and light citrus flavors. Well-balanced malts and the 6.9% ABV is barely noticeable.  Finish - Creamy and exceptionally delicate for its medium body. Strong hop aroma rolls in at the very end of the beer and into the aftertaste. Finishes remarkably well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mothman,3.97,"Poured into Sierra Nevada Tulip pint glass.  Pours a 2 finger beige head. Pretty good retention once it faces down to 1/4 finger. Leaves some lace patches. Color is a clear golden orange. A lot of carbonation bubbles floating to the top from the etching.  Aroma: At first I was smelling something I didn't like. But after a few minutes the aroma changed. Seems to be a nice smelling IPA. Pineapple citrus, very light floral hops. Now I am getting some grapefruit citrus. A big pine aroma as well.  Taste: A lot like the smell. Pineapple and grapefruit citrus, floral and pine hops, and a biscuity malt flavor. A pretty solid IPA. A huge hop flavor going on here.  Mouthfeel: Bitter, very bitter, but it is creamy at the same time when you let it roll around your mouth. Medium bodied. A fair amount of carbonation. Leaves the typical sticky hoppy aftertaste. A person really can't expect much else from these hoppy beers.  Overall, this is a pretty solid IPA. I have been going through a lot lately and this one seems to be one someone would consider a standard for an IPA. Definitely one to keep readily available for those hop heads. I could easily drink more of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,endincolorado,4.1,"Appearance- hazy pale amber with two fingers of off white head. Good retention. Nice lacing.  Smell- Fragrant floral and fruity aromas dominate the nose, followed by a nice, crisp pale malt to back.  Taste- a great balance of light, citrusy hops and some pleasant pale and caramel malt.  Mouthfeel- Medium-full bodied. Pleasant texture. Good carbonation.  Drinkability- A very drinkable IPA. Refreshing and versatile. Especially good in warm weather.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gtreid,3.8,"12 oz. bottle poured into my CCB pint glass.  A: Pours a clear, deep straw/gold color with one finger of eggshell white head that leaves minimal lace. The head does retain nicely.  A: Pine and citrus hops are balanced very well with the crystal malts. Lemon, orange peel, and some pine cones are prevalent.  T: Very nice. This is a hop forward beer that gets some balance from the malt. Again, I get the citrus with some pine, and some sweetness from the malt. Beer finishes very bitter, which is nice for the style.  M; Light to medium body, good amount of carbonation gives it a little tingle.  D and overall impression: Drinkability is high due to the fact that this is one of my favorite styles and the ABV is on the low side. Sessionable. I really like this beer so I could have quite a few of these. I don't think it is on the level of Jai Alai from CCB or two hearted, but a very nice example of the style. Skal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kadonny,4.3,"Poured from tap at TJs in Paoli into a nonic pint glass.  A: A light amber orange with a one finger fluffy white head. Nice glass lacing.  S: Piney earthy hops with a nice biscuit malt backround.  T: Hops jump first with notes of pine, herbal floral and orange citrus. Very hoppy up front. Middle is biscuity malt that carries the hops, but this beer is all hoppy and lovin it. Finish is bitter and lingering. Nice, different than bottle.  M: Medium, dry, bitter, prickly, no alcohol detected. Nice carbonation.  D: High, drink them all day.  Overall a little different taste than bottle (better), and still a damn fine IPA. Stone knows hoppy beers, and this one is no exception. Awesome.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ecoastman,4.15,"Many thanks to my beer buddy JZED for bringing this back from Boston while at the beer fest.  Appearance - an attractive clear copper ale with a nice head and light lacing. Fine carbonation keeps a thin head across the surface.  Smell - Complex with hops-o-plenty. Noticeably sweet citrus with herbal and perfumy notes. Not overpowering and one of the nicest aromas I've experienced to date.  Taste - Whoa...that sweet aroma didn't prepare me for that first taste. They weren't kidding about everything else in the world tasting bland after that. Obviously balanced towards the hop side for the extremists and sweet with nice citrusy grapefruit and lemon tones. There's a high bitterness in the finish as expected for the style. But after the first few sips the taste buds calibrate and you can enjoy the full flavour of this exceptional IPA.  Mouthfeel - Interesting since it starts with a smooth and creamy feel but finishes slightly coarse in the bitterness. The carbonation is well sustained throughout the drink.  Drinkability - I would definitely be tempted to have a second one but I couldn't make this into a session beer. But then again, I'm not a fully addicted Hop-head...yet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,alleykatking,3.83,Poured from 22oz bottle. I think this bottle that I had was a little funky. Review reflects this issue with this bottle.  A- Poured a clear deep yellow with a one and a half finger cloudy white head. Some sticky lacing on the sides of the glass after the head went down in a fashionable amount of time.  S- This is a good smelling beer. This is also a Stone smelling beer as well! Big huge citrus hop smell right off the bat with hints of pine as well. Bready sweet malts and a tint of metallic tinge to this bottle as well. Since this is my like 100th Stone IPA I realize the metallic tinge isn't suppose to be in there. Also the alcohol is suprisingly covered with the hops in this beer.  T- The citrus hops blast through the liquid onto the tounge as this beer rolls over the palate. Lots of citrus hops to be honest. The pine and malts come in next with a slight sweet malt with a semi bitter hop balance each other out nicely. There is something of an issue with this bottle as I sip on it. The taste of metal really shines through with the ending. It's very strong and I don't really like it.  M- This has a medium mouthfeel to it. The carbonation was good leaving this beer a nice dancing effect over the palate. Nice hop taste left on the tounge and pleasant hop aftertaste.  D- This is a very drinkable brew. It's a shame this beer was tainted when I cracked it. I love Stone and this beer is the only off one that I had pretty much ever from Stone. But I drink this and like it. You should too.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,biggred1,4.47,"Hazy peach colored body with a fat cream colored head of foam that melts slowly and leaves a good deal of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is really good on this one, fresh and resinous smelling piney hops with a touch of grapefruit rind and pineapple. The flavor mirrors the nose with nice hop bitterness that lingers long into the finish and just enough caramel maltiness to balance the flavors. Medium bodied with a slippery hop oily mouthfeel. A really great example of the style that never gets old, I can't begin to guess how many of these I've had over the years and it still tastes as good as the first one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeTheBall,4.32,"Poured a clear golden color with a decent one finger head in my Sam Adams ale glass. Medium lacing down the glass. Smell was very cirtus-like, grass, pine, hops galour. Taste was similar; very much up front with the bitter citrus flavor, remaining bitter all the way down, as a solid IPA should. Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable. Drinkability is good, as this one is very delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,washburnkid,4.37,"Another delicious Stone hopbomb.  A small white head covers a dark golden brew. Decent retention and some lacing on the glass. Aromas of fresh squeezed citrus, and bready malts to balance. Very floral and delicious...I can't wait to take a sip! And when I do, it's incredibly hoppy with tons of West Coast florals and herbals. I can taste such a great amount of hops...it really dominates my palate and not much else can pull through (in the true Stone style). Medium body mouthfeel offers my mouth tons of residuals, so that I can hang on to the bitterness. I would buy a 6er of this brew without thinking twice about it. Another great Stone offering that adheres to everything expected from a West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bsp77,4.65,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.  Appearance: Slightly hazy burnt yellow with foamy head and pretty strong lacing.  Smell: Pine and citrus, slightly sweet toasted malts. Some tropical notes.  Taste: Fantastic hop taste - mostly pine, citrus, mango and some grapefruit. Some mostly dry malts to counterbalance the hop explosion, but not too much. Persistent bitterness at end.  Feel: Very smooth and very dry. Medium body and moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: For being so hop-centric and bitter, this is unbelievably easy to drink.  This has now become one of my top IPAs, along with Celebration and Two-Hearted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,efhart,4.45,"Hey, this Stone IPA has become my standard beer in my fridge bought by the case. While I like really hoppy and bitter IPAs, this beer is bitter enough and so drinkable.

I find the aroma pleasant and the first and last taste delightful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BitterPachyderm,3.92,"12 oz. bottle (enjoy by 7/8/09) poured into SN pint glass...hazy piss yellow body with three fingers of white rocky head. Decent lacing and head retention...  I love hops! Huge splashes of grapefruit and notes of citrusy hops with a touch of peppery spiciness. Some caramel and pineapple as well...  Bitter little demon! A bit bready with the slightest bits of citrus that gives way to a nice bitter finish. Minute amount of malts peaking through...  Slick and buttery with a good bite of carbonation.  Definitely a quaffer. I could do a couple of these in a sitting.  Overall, I think this one smells better than it tastes. In a world of amazing IPAs, this one is a slight step down. A great brew, however, just not a world famous IPA in my book. Drink it fresh!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,supercolter,4.15,"Alright so this was actually a very good beer in my opinion except the taste was a bit lacking. Appearance is very good, nice billowing head with lots of lacing. Smell is very citrusy lots of grapefruit and lemon. There are some underlying dry hops as well. Taste was good but not great in my opinion. NOt one of the more bitter IPA's I have had. Mouthfeel was better, oily and slightly carbonated. The positive side was this was the most drinkable IPA I have ever had- it goes down so easy",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tr4nc3d,3.23,"Poured from a 22 fl oz bottle into my pint glass  Pours a very light copper color with a three inch slightly off-white head. Great head retention that leave scattered amounts of lacing all throughout my glass. This is one of those heads that go down in places(like rocky).  I pick up a slight citrus smell and caramel malts, biscuit, honey with a slight pepperness s  Minimal citrus flavor with the malt character mainly dominating this one. What is it with this? I seem to have been having bad luck with IPAs recently.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation.  Had better IPAs and wont seek this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZorPrime,4.77,"Tasted on June 15, 2009.  Omg... this is one of the best beer I drank. So nicely done.  A: Simply beautiful. A copper color with a tiny head. I bigger head would be great. S: Strong aroma of hops which make you think the taste will be a bomb of hops. T: Bitterness... I would say hops bitterness. The most surprising it was a medium intensity taste. The hops are piny with some citrus. Very nice tasting. D:Very easy to drink.  Again, Stone has achieved almost perfection with this beer. One of my top 5 beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,atpben,4.33,"Another Stone beer that I have had many times. Reviewing from notes taken at my last Stone beer night. Poured into a Stone Pint glass. Pours an orange-caramel into the glass, with a frothy head, and wonderful lacing. The aroma has all you'd expect: grapefruit, citrus, pine, and flowery. The taste has exactly the same qualities. There is a light caramel sweetness mixed with the huge hop presence. It has a very nice, refreshingly creamy finish that I loved. Truly, one of the best IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brenden,4.4,"The color is a bright golden-amber. The head is like a fluffy pillow that could have rested a reasonable weight without giving way and never fully dissipated, leaving small patches of thick lacing throughout the glass. It's very appealing already. Pure, clean floral and citrus hops are straight on the nose with a bit of spice. Hops bitterness is right up front...the pureness of raw bud is very appealing. There's a fantastic freshness in the citrus, heavily grapefruit, and pine resin. Herbal notes are strong as well and the underlying zesty spice is very nice as well. There are some grains and an herbal leaf note in a very dry finish with lingering hops bitterness that never fades. The mouthfeel is a nice balance of smooth and crisp and the body is moderate. Carbonation is light to moderate, very much present without overwhelming. I dare say this is a purist's brew and a standard for IPAs. ABV is a little deceiving, but low enough that this one can be sessioned with some frequency.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Anthony1,4.4,"Bottle poured into a weissen glass.  It pours a great ipa amber color with a fluffy head.  I am not norally a huge fan of IPAs but wow. This is a great beer. It has a hoppy smell with some mixes of fruits, possibly grapefruit, a bit of lemon. felt like a meduim beer but flowed so smooth. the after taste was strong, but not overwhelming hops like most IPA's. It was a great mix and kept me coming back for another sip.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nomomentwasted,4.38,"Session with this frequently, but this review was from a bomber from Stone, fresh brewed within a few days, poured into a pint glass. Not a huge difference between store-bought (granted I'm living in San Diego), but it's great on-tap, out of the bottle, etc.  Appearance: Great IPA color and head. Foam isn't overwhelming, but holds great flavor and smell as well. Definitely great, but nothing particularly outstanding or better than any other great IPA.  Smell: Good. Very nice. Light citrus notes in with the hops, and when I think IPA, it's what I think of. Having had a few more floral and fragrant IPAs of late, it's not mind-blowing, but still very good.  Taste: Great. Really like this taste. It's less bitter than some other IPAs out there, but still so delicious and well-balanced hop and barley character. The hop presence is definitely felt, but not overwhelming, just a solid and delicious beer.  Mouthfeel: What an IPA should be like, and really smooth. Crisp and opens up in the mouth well, with a nice swallow as well. Carbonation is great for the sip too.  Drinkability: Session-worthy much. Could drink this all day, but the ABV is more present here at 6.9 than I feel like Pliny the Elder is at an 8, but smooth and delicious nonetheless. Really just a fantastic IPA, and I'm more than happy if ever offered one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZimZamZoom,4.38,"Poured a bomber into a pint glass. A very nice, slightly hazy orange-amber ale with a thick light tan head. Seriously nice gooey-looking head with tons of sticky lacing left on the glass as it fades slowly.  A nice pine-spice aroma of hops, with a bit of the citrus touch as well. Some sweet malt and caramel backing this up, but it's mostly about the earthy hops. The taste starts with the big pine-hop bite, some malt balances this out nicely in the middle, and then the hops turn bitter and harsh towards the finish with the bitter kick lingering for upwards of thirty seconds after a sip.  Big bodied, viscous, and a fair bit of a carbonation bite in the back of the throat. Nice. All of this works very well together in this great drinkable IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bum732,4.79,"Pours an orangish yellow, nice creamy head that leaves great lacing. Smells of very floral hops, grapefruit, citrus, pansies, orange, cannabis. Tastes of hoppy moderately sweet malt with a nice citrusy bitterness. Same aromas picked up in the taste, not too much malt. Finishes dry with a resiny hoppiness in the back of the throat.  An absolute amazing beer, so many aromas and flavors from the hops. Just enough malt character to somewhat balance the beer, but overall, hops galore. Definitely my favorite IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ShrLSU,4.2,Pours a clear golden color with a frothy white head that clings to the edges in clumps. Some slight citrus and malt scents bring great balance. Taste is just like the nose. A little citrus and piney hops along with some great malt flavors. Overall this is quite a refreshing and prefectly balanced IPA. I'm excited that they are coming to Louisiana at the end of the summer!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ders,4.27,"I've had this quite a few times on tap at bars and have always liked it, but this is my first 6 pack because it's a couple bucks more than many other IPAs and I'm cheap. After tasting this again, I think it's worth it.  Appearance: Pretty IPA color. Nice head gone after a few minutes, but lacing is left.  Smell: Hops... Smells like an IPA.. but a little nuttier maybe. It's a good smell.  Taste: Taste like an IPA. Leaves a bite of bitter for quite a few seconds (perhaps minutes).  Mouthfeel: Nice and carbonated.  Drinkibility: I think after a couple it would start being too ""rich"" like many IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jbhuxley,4.35,"Appearance: Gold orange color. Two finger head. Nice web of lacing that sticks around to the finish.  Smell: Hops... Pine, citrus, Hops.  Taste: Hops are what you would expect. Pine and citrus. Great balance. Lingering bitterness. Not too dry on the end.  Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation. Fairly light in body.  Drinkibility: I can't leave this one alone. It is a perfectly balanced IPA. I could drink this one every day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hosehead83,4.47,"Poured into standard pint glass Hazy gold in color, big, fluffy two-inch head that beckons Aroma-Piney citrus and hops up the nose Taste-Big,fresh, juicy hops up front, in the middle, and at the finish! Nicely balanced throughout, just a delicious IPA. Overall this is a hop lover's IPA, and a good starting off point for a person who has never had a Stone brew (what are you waiting for??) as most of their other ale are quite assertive in character to say the least! Get Some!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nocheinsbitte,4,"had this for the first time today--not a big IPA fan, but this is a good one that will lead me to have others.  A: nice appearance. golden color, a little hazy. nice head with good lacing. A good looking bier. S: a very subdued smell. Other IPAs hit you from 3 feet away with the hoppy smell, this is inviting and subdued. T: The smell doesn't prepare you for the taste! In a good way! It is very hoppy, but doesn't leave a nasty aftertaste or extreme dryness. M: not tinny or high in acid content, a good mouthfeel. D: I could have a few of these at a time. As I stated, this is not my favorite style, but I would not turn down this bier...  I recommend this fine bier, one of the best IPAs I have tried. Do yourself a favor and try one. PRosit!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,charliedango,4.97,"Stone IPA is by far one of the finest india pale ales that I have ever had. It has the heavy hops one comes to expect from an IPA, but it's smooth and far less abrasive than other brewers takes on IPA. It's a drag that you can't get Stone in Illinois, but well worth the drive to pick up a few bombers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DiabolikDUB,4.12,"Poured from 12oz. Bottle into Snifter glass.  Pours a crystal clear glowing orange with a fantastic slightly off-white creamy head. Aroma has caramel malt, granny smith apple and touches of citrus hops. Flavor has more of the citrus hops upfront with some light malts and a very light bitterness that doesn't dominated. its light to medium bodied with a very light carbonation. Very nicely done IPA, doesn't really stand out from most but the aroma is unique.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JimmieFrisbee,4.45,"Stone IPA - 6/03/09  Clear gold in color, lots of bubbles racing to the surface. Monstrous frothy white head.  Smells strongly of citrus hops, almost to the point of having a ""bite"" to it. Not a whole lot else going on, but it's got everything I want in those citrus hops!  Very strong on the hops but not over the top. Not what I would call balanced, but certainly has a delicate nature to its intensity. Again, it is really the citrus hops that come through, not a lot from the malt in terms of flavor.  Medium to light body, plenty of carbonation - an easy drinker for sure. Exactly what I want for an extended summer evening.  I'm glad to finally get a chance to see what this beer is all about. Certainly didn't disappointed, maybe I wish I had found it sooner. Definitely a safe go-to for my citrus hop fix!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,d0ggnate,3.88,"A: Golden orange pour with a nice tight glass lace and single finger head layer. S: Floral hops. Dull lemons and orange. T: The cirtus in the hops is a bit more pronounce in the taste. Earthy and hay like. M: Crisp, dry. Great carbonation. D: A go-to IPA. Top notch west coast beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,slatetupelo,4.35,A- Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It poured a straw (yellowish/orange) color with lots of carbonation and a thin white head that disappeared quickly. Decent lacing.  S - Hops and a strong grapefruit fragrance  T - A good grapefruit taste that is only mildly bitter a little piney. The bitterness lingers for a minute but I enjoy it.  D - I tend to like IPAs with a good citrus or grapefruit profile to them so I really like this. I drank a few of these the other night without realizing it.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CarolinaCardinals,4.42,"Picked up a growler Thursday at the brewery for $8.  Beer poured a light orange with a nice white head. Nose is huge with floral northwest hops. Taste is grapefruit hops, pine, and a hint of mango and bread in the background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and is leaving a resiny layer on my palate. Drinkability is quite good, this is still one of my favorite IPA's!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kels,4.13,"Recently had an opportunity to try this on tap with dinner at the Cock & Bull in Cincinnati.  Appearance: The beer pours a lovely bright golden yellow with a short, quickly fading white fluffy head. Slight lacing and loads of carbonation in the clear liquid.  Smell: Not very much to tell at all. Hints of crispy malts, grains and slight hops come through, but not what I expect in an IPA. Really mild and not very hoppy aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Little hints of the alcohol come through light toasty, crispy malts and piney hops. The balance is very good while still allowing the bitterness to remain the focus. The feel is great - really full and rich and really enhancing the overall taste of the beer. It is bright and very well carbonated. Little aftertaste, and a fairly clean feel remain on the palate.  Drinkability: Very high. This is a really enjoyable, basic IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Florida9,4.22,"A: Dull gold in color. Very clear. 2 fingers of gooey off-white head which is slow to dissipate. Some lacing.  S: Big, dominate, in your face aroma of floral hops with some herbal notes. Like perfumed beer.  T: Grapefruit. Not as intense grapefruit as Smuttynose, but its definately up there. Starts off bitter on the back of the tongue. Some pine notes then finishes with a dry maltiness.  M: Medium body and medium carbonation. Slight bitterness.  D: This is a great IPA and another winner from Stone. Not as an intense a beer as Ruination, but still offers up a wonderful floral aroma and is packed with flavor for what I could easily consider a sessionable beer. It's amazing what these guys can do with some malt and hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,stewart124,4.38,"This pours a yellowish-orange with a dense white head. Looks to have lots of carbonation. There is a nice lacing as I drink.  The smell is very pungent and hints of citrus, yeast, and sweeter esters come out in the aroma.  Smooth and delicious body with a nice piney dryness in the finish. Lots of citrus bite on the tongue followed by a good amount of maltiness. There are nice notes of apple and pear in the sweetness but this is overpowered by the grapefruit and orange zest from the hops.  Very pleasing to drink and there is an superb amount of hops with just the right bite.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TexIndy,4.62,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Looks like a bottling code but no dating info lasered on towards the bottom of the front of the bottle. It was a hazy honey color with some carb streams and really great lacing. It had an average sized light beige head that slowly settled to a constant foam and thick collar.  The aroma was outstanding - a hop lovers aroma. Citric hops, pine resin with a sweet malt base. Really loved this one. The taste was also outstanding. Starts off with a good amount of hops and then does a slight build to a good but not overpowering hop bite and bitter finish. This has a ton of hops but one of the few that I could have more than one of at a sitting and not regret the tongue shredding. Great mouthfeel.  Overall, this is an exceptional beer and one of the best AIPA's out there. Stone comes through again and again. Highly recommend. Been a few years since I've had this but glad I tried it again. Will now be part of the regular hops rotation.  [RR-hops]",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BirdFlu,4.35,"Pours an orangish copper with foamy off-white head.. smells quite hoppy (of course), a bit fruity but the aroma is sort of subdued when you smell it after pouring, you need to smell the bottle to really get it.. A very fruity hop flavor, a bit sweet but, again, in a fruity way, not syrupy. A sweet aftertaste in the back of the mouth after swallowing. A good medium body. Super easy to drink, not heavy at all, could easily put down a ton of them. Its hard to judge which is better between this and Ruination, though..",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jonziefle,4.27,"Appearance: Poured a slightly cloudy dark gold, with a one finger white head. Reduces down to a thin, bubbled layer in not much time. Not much visible carbonation at all. Good lacing, but not extreme.  Smell: The nose is completely dominated by fragrant, fruity hops. Grapefruit and pine are the strongest scents, with other hop smells intermingling. The hops are strong, but not bitter or aggressive. Sweet, but not syrupy. Little in the way of malts; only if you smell deep down.  Taste: A nice hop bite to start, but, overall, the hops don&#8217;t taste as strong as in the nose; it&#8217;s a little deceiving. They&#8217;re good, and you can taste the grapefruit and pine, but more indescript than the nose as well. Malts are much more present in the taste, providing a bready backbone to the beer, as well as, lingering a bit at the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and very smooth. Good bite up front, with a good linger at the end. Quite easy drinking.  Drinkability: A very good IPA. Good hops, with good malt balance. I would have preferred the taste to be closer to the smell, in relation to the hops, but it doesn&#8217;t disappoint either way. Easy drinker; definitely sessionable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BigMike,4.15,Pours a glowing hazy burnt orange color. Two finger head.  A nice hoppy floral aroma and dominated by citrus. In particular grapefruit. Very smooth and bitter with a great mouthfeel. Rich and flavorful without being overly heavy.  The bitter finish is awesome! This is one of the better IPA's. I'll be looking for this one again for sure. At 6.9abv. i could drink a few of these badboys.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GarrisWH,4.42,"Poured from a bomber into pint glass  A - Pours a clear, rich, golden color with a nice thick, white head. Leaves very nice lacing on the glass.  S - Nice floral, hoppy aroma with a bit of citrus behind it  T - Fresh hoppiness with the grapefruit tones coming through most dominant. Bitterness is well balanced with a slight sweetness reminiscent of caramel. Complex flavor with a nice floral, hoppy aftertaste.  M - Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Nice, crisp, and refreshing on the palate.  D - Very drinkable brew considering its pushing 7% abv. The fresh, floral hoppiness makes it enjoyable to the last sip  Overall, a very nicely done IPA that I will have to revisit again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,quinlin,4.92,"A - Pours a fresh golden color, with a lacy head and nice retention on the glass.  S - Smells of citrus and pine.

D - An allround great IPA, ill definitely have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SirDrinxAlot,4.7,"Poured a hazy golden amber with a 1 finger head that left a sudsy lacing  Smelled of pine, orange peel, light malt, grapefruit  Taste is piney citrus hops with a good malt balance. Perfect hop bitterness.  Med/High carbonation with high drinkability.  A great IPA. Stone Brewing has yet to disappoint.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TommyW,4.57,"A- Golden body with a thick white head that sticks all over the sides of the glass.  S- Raw hops and some citrusy fruit aromas.  T- There is underlying malt foundation that pokes through with a little with some sweet, fruity notes. This mixes well with the citrusy hop flavors. The hops dominate overall though. The hop oils and citrusy flavor as well as the bitterness are prominent.  M- Smooth and crisp feel with a moderate carbonation.  D- An awesome IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,erikm25,4.23,A: Pours a pale golden with light toasted orange highlights. Bronzed and crisp. Head is full and fluffy white. Amazing sheets of lacing circling and clinging to the glass.  S: Delicious grapefruit hops with pine undertones. Grassy and earthy. This is fresh with floral aromas.  T: Complex hops tastes balanced against a faint caramel honey sweetness. Spiced tart apples with lemon tang. Herbal zest with a peppered bready backdrop. Finish is dry and crisp.  M: Light to medium mouth feel with creamy carbonation. Very refreshing with just the right amount of bitterness.  D: Very drinkable and a long time favorite. Not a whole lot needs to be said as this is one fine brew. Draped up and dripped out.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,anchordrinker,4.35,"A- Pours a pale golden color with about one finger's worth of head that dissipates a bit and then sticks around.  S- Floral and sharp citrusy aromas dominate  T- Grapefruit citrus flavors are dominant, with a biscuity pale malt backing. I think the balance fits the style really well.  M- Light-medium bodied, with a pleasant medium-high carbonation, and a really nice dry finish.  D- If you're into bitterness it is very, very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ArrogantDeadGuy,4.35,"A: pours the usual amber hue for a very unusual IPA. The head is strong with consistent lacing.  S: The smell is subdued, both slightly sweet as well as floral.  T: Awesome. A great hop statement, not as strong as I've come to expect from AIPA. The flavor and hop balance are further evidence of Stone's tendency toward reinvention without compormising old school standards.  M: Clean, crisp, balanced, all cliche but all true.  D: Very drinkable AIPA, not being strong for the sake of being strong. True artistry in this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mjaskula,4.08,"Served in a pint glass. Pours a clear gold color with some effervescence and a moderate white head that sticks around and coats the glass.  The aroma is strong, fresh, floral, and hoppy. Taste is full of hoppy bitterness and flavor with some citrus flavors as well. Not much malt for balance, but it's not missed. Mouthfeel is mildly dry, but will be easy drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeanBone,4.59,"Appearance: A slightly hazy, golden-orange colored body with a finger and a half of sudsy, off-white head. Decent lacing.  Aroma: An abundance of floral, perfumy, citrusy hops right off the bat. Beyond the hops, a sweet medium malt base and a few whiffs of booze. Damn, this smells good.  Taste: Up front, tons of grapefruity, piney, and assertively bitter hops lead the charge. Underneath, a solid caramel malt backbone keeps everything relatively balanced. Bright and tasty from the first sip to the last and never too bitter for the style. The aftertaste keeps the resiny bitterness going well into your next sip.  Mouthfeel: A slightly more full than medium body with smooth carbonation and a dry finish. Every now and then, a hint of alcohol burn.  Drinkability: As long as you're into hops, the only thing to slow you down is the almost seven percent alcohol content.  Verdict: As I had imagined, this is essentially Ruination's (relatively) little brother. In all honesty, this IPA is a lot hoppier (and a damn sight tastier) than many brewer's Double IPAs - just what you'd expect from the boys at Stone. Well done!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ocelot2500,4.32,Pours a hazy orangish gold with a big white head. Enough lacing on the glass.  Smell is of citrus hops with some spice.  Taste is the spicy citrus hops balanced with soft bread malts. Very nice and balanced.  A medium body with a good amount of carbonation.  This is very drinkable.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,br3wmeister,4.12,"A- Moderate sized almost white head that is thick and foamy with small bubbles texturing the top. The head becomes rocky as it slowly drops, it also leaves some good lacing. The beer itself is a lightly fogged golden color.  S- Lots of nice citrus, pine and floral hops are present in the aroma. The hops are accompanied by sweet caramel and vanilla aromas. Some spicy and fruity note also come through.  T- Some nice spicy, citrus and pine flavored hops are nicely balanced but sweet grainy malt. Nice hop profile and well balanced.  M- Medium bodied with a good dry bitterness.  Overall a very nice IPA not to much special going on just a well crafted IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,myown66,4.1,"Being as I am newly enamored with IPA's, I went looking for them at the local beer snob emporium. When I found that Stone made just what I sought, my search ended. What does Stone make that isn't good? Many other IPA's that I have purchased have brought disappointment, not the case with this one. While it didn't send my mind into a the frenzy that I was looking for, it definitely scratched the itch. Very well representative as a Double IPA, at least in the humble opinion of this beer initiate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MetalHopHead6,4.5,"12oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass.  Stone IPA pours a medium gold with a sticky thick three-finger head that leaves beautiful rings of lace.  The smell and taste are crisp, clean, and earthy, with subtle pine notes and a hint of citrus. It's extremely easy to drink (again, crisp) with the feel of sharp bitterness.  I tend to prefer ales that have at least one over-the-top aggressive characteristic; however, Stone IPA is consistent and strong in every area. It's an ideal IPA and the first one that would come to mind if I had to commit the rest of my life to just one. As appealing as that thought is, I plan to continue to play the field.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PDXHops,4.17,"Bomber, poured into an oversized snifter.  Glowing amber/orange body with a finger of creamy looking off-white head. Sadly, the head recedes to a ring and a skim of bubbles. Very little lacing.  Very mild and floral bouquet, surprisingly subdued considering the brewery. Some sweet and clean bready malt aromas as well. Small amounts of citrus of pine.  The pine and citrus are much more apparent in the mouth. Those 2 flavors bounce all over the palate- very nice. Some other citrus as well- hints of lemon and orange on the sides of the tongue. Just enough caramel malt flavor to provide a touch of balance.  Mouthfeel is medium-full, almost chewy. Drinks like a bigger beer than it is. Medium carbonation. Finishes fairly dry with a nice lingering trail of grapefruit and pine halfway down the throat.  Overall impression: Very solid West Coast IPA. For the first time, I feel that the weighting of the appearance is really dragging down the overall score of a beer. I can't give a beer with minimal head and lacing anything better than an 'average' appearance rating, though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Sean9689,4.28,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my DFH snifer.  A - Beautiful light gold/copper color with a nice white head. Lots of lacing along the sides, the head just sticks to the glass. Still a few bubbles of carbonation fizzing up after the head vanishes.  S - Slight hoppy/citrus notes on the nose.  T - Nice crisp citrus and hops melded together very well. Very refreshing. I get some nice sweet oranges on the finish with a slight bitterness.  M - Light in body, a good amount of carbonation, and very smooth.  D - Very easy to drink and a great IPA. A winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ProudBeerSnob,4.14,"Poured into a std pint glass. Good head that provides great lacing throughout the pint. Great hop aroma, a little sweet smelling. Hints of citrus upfront, only to lead straight into crisp hop bitter. Surprsingly drinkable. Yet another quality offering from Stone's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,yemenmocha,4.5,"Pours semi-hazy amber to golden color with white head that dissipates to a thin layer. Nose is mixed citrus, with some focus towards grapefruit. Palate is sharply hoppy at the beginning which is quite nice, light malt midway, and grapefruit-orange citrusy towards the finish. Refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LordAdmNelson,4.09,"A- Pours a straw color with moderate head with moderate retention and little lacing.  S- Big citrus hops. Definitely get grapefruit, lemon zest, maybe some tangerine. A little caramel-y malt in the background. Great aroma.  T- Big on the bitter hops. Piney with some carmel malt. Good, but not amazing.  M- Pretty good. Smooth, light carbonation. Moves along nicely.  D- Again, pretty good. Moves quick and tastes good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,merryjoulton,3.62,"Pours a light straw color with a weak head that dissipates quickly and no lacing. Smells strongly of piny, grapefruity hops. Maybe a hint of pear? Tastes bitter and a tad bit tart. Mouthfeel is good for a beer this size and I could drink many of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hardy008,4.17,"Appearance - Pours a clear golden color with a white foamy two finger head. Leaves a nice sticky lace on the glass.  Smell - Grapefruit, lemon, and hops. Somewhat of a sweet aroma is also present.  Taste - Bitter grapefruit peeling from the hops is the strongest flavor. Rich and creamy. A slight bit of sweetness lingers at the end.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, creamy, somewhat of a sticky feeling to it. Finishes dry.  Drinkability - A nice drinkable IPA. Normally not my favorite style of beer, but I like this a lot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bluetravlr,4.32,"A: Nice two finger head. Clear, golden color with visible carbonation. The head is quickly reduced to a thin but lingering film. Strong lacing.  S: Immediately noticeable upon cracking the bottle. Strong grapefruit scents with notes of pine. Slight floral aroma mixed with hints of bread. Sweet but earthy.  T: Amazing. Despite having a great hop profile this beer is crisp and clean; more so than the great majority of IPAs. Initial taste is of grapefruit, caramel and bread. This is followed by a terrific piney flavor while the caramel slightly lingers. No malts. Nicely mild, piney and bitter aftertaste with a few floral notes.  M: Perfect thickness and carbonation. The bitterness masks the sweetness nicely. For some the lingering bitterness might be a problem, but not for me.  D: Again, bitterness could make this a sipper for some, but the crisp, clean profile makes this a session beer in my book.  Terrific beer, and one of my favorite IPAs. Consistently good---one of my standbys. Obviously, I'm not alone in my praise for this beer so I'll stop gushing now. Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,McGIPA,5,"must start by saying this IS my favorite IPA to date..  Have to, Have to, Have to, pour this into a mug or glass!  A - looks like heaven would look like...cloudy because of the unfiltered process (which is my favorite) S - smells like angels - kind of piney...awesome! T - best tasting IPA to date (at least for me) perfect in every way! MF - great! D- simply amazing! I need to have at least one a week to stay sane...you will not be disappointed!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SpencerSauce,4.9,"Opened the bottle cap with the back of the blade on a machete like usual. haha seriously  A- looked golden with soo many bubbles. quite clear  S- like walking through a forrest of pine. Lots of pine and some citrus especially grapefruit. Hops are amazing  T- Grapefruit is most prominent. with pine and floral notes. The bitterness takes away alot of the taste at the end.  M- crisp and bitter.  D- easy, one of my favorite IPA's",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,seand,4.3,"Poured from the bottle into a mug.  A: Pours a light amber with about a finger and a half of white bubbly head. Leaves great lacing.  S: Sweet, light, piney hops.  T: Hoppy with some nice balance. The hops linger on the aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied and sticky, great carbonation.  D: Easy to drink, though at nearly 7% it's not quite a session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OldYoda,3.53,"Picked this up in a mixed 6. Can't believe I haven't gotten around to this touted IPA before this. Pours a nice light amber into a standard US pint with a modest head, a little bit more opaque than your typical American IPA.  Smell is subdued and a nice mix of malt and hops. Not nearly as assertive with the hops as some.  Taste is very nice and well balanced, although I prefer a more heavily hopped ale, this is certainly tasty.  Mouthfeel is outstanding, very smooth.  Drinkability is fine even at this ABV.  A very good IPA but to my mind not up to the standard of Bell's Two Hearted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bonsreeb85,3.67,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber...  A - 1.5-2 finger head with great retention. the color was a bronze color. also left a nice lacing on the way down. nothing to write home about, but an overall good looking beer.  S - all west coast citrus hop here. lemon and pine.  T - citrus hops, but not enough, the hops break and a yeasty breadiness comes through, too much if you ask me. but the beer closes with a moderate hop bitterness. could benifit from more IMO.  MF - light to medium body, with little carb. and very creamy, not bad.  D - this beer was very balanced, almost to a fault. i thought that the yeast/malt flavor was a bit overdone. this isn't to say that the hop bitterness was't there, just not enough for my tastes. that said however, if you are looking for an American West Coast IPA that doesn't decimate your taste buds, and is very balanced, this might be a good choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Cheers!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,drunkboxer1,4.37,"Had this with a greek style pizza. Poured into a pils glass. Hazy golden color, white head that stayed around, leaving a fair amount of lace. Smelled of American hops, big and kinda piney. Tastes of the same hops, but with a good malt backbone to back it up. This is bigger than a lot of IPAs and it shows. I don't think I've ever bought this before because I would have remembered how tasty it is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JonMich13,4.52,"A = Looks like most IPA's - amber orange with a lite off white head, sticky lacing.  S = Love the nose here. Very nice floral and malt aroma. Pretty strong as well.  T = Deliciously balanced with sweet sugary maltness up front and then a thick wave of hops kicks in and carries through. No overbearing bitterness. Just well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable.  M = Nice and not too coating. A little oily but not bad at all. Solid carbonation and slightly dry finish.  D = So very drinkable. I could go all night with this beer.  Very, very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,drink1121,4.15,"Excited to have my first Stone brew.  Pours a lighter amber with decent head. No real retention nor lacing, but a good color.  I would like a little more hoppy smell to an IPA in a perfect world, but still citrus and hops  Could also have more hope, but for an IPA, still well represented. Slight malty, citrus again  Fairly heavy carbonation for an IPA, but not in a bad way  Def. could have 3 of these. Good, crisp, good",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dalem,3.92,"Pours a clean, clear gold in color with not a huge head but still a sticky lacing on the sides of the glass through the entire beer. Though usually a hop fiend where I have to notice a pungent floral scent jumping out at me right off the bat or I'll already start having my contentions about how good an IPA gonna be even before it's first there's something nice and different about the subdued character in the aroma of this. It smells of citrus and pine along with some malt and I'm thinking something along the lines of peach but laid back, sweet and nice instead of brassy, bold and upfront. It's deceiving though because on first sip there is definitely a sharp hop tang up front. Not all pucker power though but like the scent-crisp and citrusy with that peach thing I mentioned in the backbone. Malt shows up in the middle adding a nice balance to the the sweety tarty flavor that surrounds it. The finish is slightly dry and kinda spicy with a bit of alcohol burn but nothing that would make ya think that this is close to a 7% ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CampusCrew,4.5,"Perfect IPA  appearance: golden amber hues, almost red  smell: loaded and more loaded hops, very plesant for a hop head  taste: like hops of course, this beer is loaded with it. I think this is one of my fasvorite IPAs.  mouthfeel: thin not thick. good carbonation and very tasty  drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with spicy snacks or meals.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Vonerichs,4.42,"Light copper color with a nice two finger frothy white head and good lacing.  Huge pungent aroma of fresh cut grass, pine, and grapefruit. It's like sticking your face in a fresh barrel of hops and you can smell this from at least one foot away.  Again, enormously pungent and piney. There is a fresh ruby red grapefruit citrus bitterness. Very clean and fresh taste. For a second I thought I found a sweet bready malt but the hops blindsided me again and I lost it. It may be in there somewhere.  Good mouthfeel, slightly oily. Medium carbonation and very clean. Finish is bitter citrus and only slightly dry.  Extremely drinkable. Tastey and alcohol is not detectable despite a relatively high abv.  Another great Stone offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jjanega08,4.32,A= Pours a beautiful dark orange color that's hazy and a small one finger head comes from it falling into a thin layer on top of the beer but it lasts throughout the drink leaving spotty lacing. S= Piney and peppery hops come from it. There's also a little caramely malt coming through behind the hops but not much. T= huge grapefruit in it. very clean as well. The caramel malt touches the middle of my tongue and is swallowed again quickly by the grapefruit pine hops. M= Smooth and crisp. Not too dry of a finish and very clean without a lingering flavor. D= Great. This is an awesome IPA. I'll be looking for this beer more often that's for sure.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thekevlarkid,4.25,"Off the tap at Sweetwater's in Burlington this beer was a hazy, rusty gold color. The one-finger, beige head displayed decent retention and good lacing. The aroma was well-defined and apropos to the style, floral hops, citrus hops, grapefruit and orange notes and a solid pale malt backbone. The flavors were totally on-the-mark for an IPA, grapefruit, pine, herbal notes, a slight spiciness, pale malt and a bold but not overpowering bitterness. The mouthfeel was semi-smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation excellent. A great go-to example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Amnoisis,4.37,"A - Golden a clear. 2 Finger head, retention with thick lacing.  S - Flowery and citrus are strong. Overpowers any malty aromas present.  T - Dry, graininess followed by strong hop sweetness and florals. Very smooth and clean, with a slight banana taste lingering. Very little ester or off-taste present.  M - Aftertaste is dry, but with remnants of citrus and floral nose. Carbonation is moderate high, leaving excited feelings behind. Good for this style.  D - Very! With a smooth aftertaste, it leaves you wanting more and most anything after. Great for hops lovers who desire something elegant but not extreme.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CHILLINDYLAN,4.5,"Pours a thick syrupy golden orange with a finger of beautiful bubbly sticky head that laces wonderfully down the glass.  Hops are very refreshing in the nose. A crisp piney-citrus that overpowers any other smells.  Tastes like it smells, loads of hops upfront and behind. Small bready malt backbone that balances the hops just enough to really push the hop flavors. Hops are fruity and spicy and linger with a fresh tangy bitter hop bite.  Mouthfeel is smooth and hop-resiny. Leaves you smacking your lips for another swig.  Drinkability is awesome, if you're a hophead. Not too heavy, alcohol is present but nicely masked by the hops. Great hoppy IPA that really showcases the hops. I could drink these all day long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cavedave,4.57,"Pours a perfectly cloudy amber/straw into my Duvel tulip. A thin off-white head of well-knit foam produces clinging sheets of lace after a gentle swirl.  Aroma is orange peel, sweet flowers, pine, herb, hints of biscuit and yeast. It is perfume, inviting my nose to stay upon the snifter's rim. The balance is magnificent.  How delicious! It is a bright expansion of complexity and satisfaction. Not an explosion, but an expansion, in the way of mind expansion. My taste buds react in joy to grapefruit pine flowers herbal spice yeasty sweet and earth tones which each accomplish shining in their own right while creating a beautiful symphony of living flavors that crest in a long dry finish. Each sip outshines the last as my tongue enlightens to this.  In the mouth it is marvelous, light, dry, perfectly carbonated, not resinous to detriment, just the feel to please an IPA lover.  Taste, flavor, mouthfeel combine to produce extraordinary drinkability. This bomber likely will be empty in five more minutes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,KeefD,4.47,"Pours a nice pale orangish-yellow color with a small head but left some nice lacing. Aroma is all grapefruit and light citurs olenty of orange-like citrus flavor backed up by a decent pale amlt backbone. No caramel malts her, just hoppy goodness. Taste is the samne. Bitter grapefruit rind, a bit of black pepper, sappy, semi-sweet, with a long dry finish. This is easily up there with the best of the AIPAs. I love these hop centric ones with less caramel malt and more hops. Yum.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ffejherb,4.27,On tap at Al's of Hampden on 4/17/09.  A - Clear golden/amber body with sparse carbonation and thin white head that retained as a patchy film and left some spotty lace on the glass.  S - Spicy and citrusy hops with sweet caramel malt with a mild toasted grain character. Some mild piney notes and a hint of alcohol emerged as it warmed. The aroma really opened up as it reached room temperature.  T - Straight up West Coast hop profile with a prevalent citrus character as well as some piney and resiny notes in the backend. Finishes with a supporting grainy malt character to ease the hop bitterness.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a syrupy texture with a bit of residual hop oils on the palate. Finish is moderately bitter.  D - Extremely quaffable IPA that is certainly a hallmark in the echelon of the IPA kingdom. This is a fantastic entry-level IPA for someone looking to delve into the splendor of West Coast IPAs.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gmann,4.12,"Pours a light honey color with tight white head that dissipated into a light cap and left some clingy lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of juicy grapefruit, light pine, a bit of a peppery spice and a honey malt. The taste is of juicy orange hops that quickly transforms into a piney and resiny hop bitterness. All of the hop flavors a supported by a bready honey malt. A pretty serious AIPA with a bigger malt presence than most. The feel is that of a moderate body, soft to prickly carbontation and a bitter finish. The brew is bigger than your traditional AIPA. Very flavorful AIPA, though the malt presence makes this brew heavier it helps balance out the hops and adds to the drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,popery,4.72,"A: Clear golden-amber liquid with a big white head and lots of lacing. It fits the bill for an IPA to a tee, at least the bill that exists in my head.  S: Wonderful hops produce a smell that makes me picture groves of oranges and lemons. It's fresh and clean without overwhelming. This scent nails West Coast IPA in the best possible way.  T: The flavor is hoppy with almost perfect bitterness. The malt backbone is there and provides just enough sweetness to express the hops at their finest, keeping the bitterness pleasant.  M: Creamy, sudsy, oily with hops.  D: I had to stop myself from finishing my glass before I even started writing the review. American IPA might be the single most competitive style right now in craft beer and Stone sets the bar incredibly high with their version. Stone is big (among craft brewers, anyway) for a reason. They make great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,natasharai,4.2,"Appearance: Poured with some foamy bubbly off white head, that dissipated leaving some nice lacing all down the glass. The beer is clear orangish-gold.  Smell: Delicious floral citrus hops, sweet caramel malt, very refreshing  Taste: Pretty intense for an IPA, citrus hops, bitter floral, some sweet malt, ending with a lemon citrus flavor and bitter after taste.  Mouthfeel: Bitter tingle on the tongue, nicely carbonated, light bodied, ending with a refreshing feel and some bitterness.  Overall: Pretty drinkable IF you like hops, a bit bitter but the hop flavors make up for that. This held up really well for 2 months in the fridge, the hop character is still very prevalent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gosox8787,4.74,"Bought a six pack of this beer, as I loved the other offering from Stone that I had (Stone RIS). As soon as I opened the bottle, the smell smacked me in the face, in a good way. Poured into a glass with only a small white head that quickly receded into a lacing. The beer itself was a nice golden yellow (not as dark as I would expect given the strong aroma) without any haze. The aroma, as mentioned before, is strong with floral and citrus notes everywhere and in great balance. Taste is also great. The hops hit upfront and give a grapfruit and citrus flavor that forms a nice base to this beer. Floral and piney notes also offer nice flavor to this beer. There is also a less noticable malty backbone which offers a nice caramel sweetness to this beer. The aftertaste is slighty bitter and very hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice bite of carbonation. Drinakability is great as for me as I cannot get enoguh of this beer. The alcohol is not even noticable.  Overall, probably the best IPA I have ever had. Strong flavors all in balance. Just an expectional example of the style. Would have every time I had an opportunity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MisterClean,4.03,"Sampled at a homebrew club meeting  A - Poured copper-gold with a 2 fingered white head. Dissipated moderately slow and left nce lacing.  S - Caramel, flowers, and grass.  T - Caramel, flowers, grass, and bittering hops.  M - Full-bodied, hop dominated, slightly dry.  D - Overall good. What you expect an IPA to taste like, nothing too fancy. A bit over-hyped, but an easy to drink beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brow1901,4.22,"A- A golden straw yellow color with a white head. The beer has excellent clarity. Not much head retention but good sticky lacing down the glass.  S- The smell is a bit more interesting. Obviously there is a bunch of hops. The hops are of the piney variety, although I do smell some grapefruit and possibly grape skins. Smells really good.  T&M- The taste is alright, in my mind it's really not hoppy enough, but it could just be a really balanced beer. But it reminds me of an overly hopped pilsner. Much like the smell the hop character is more pine and less citrus hops. The mouth feel is nice and light, and it leaves the throat dry.  D- Overall this beer is a good IPA but I didn't think that it lived up to the hype. I've had better ipa's. It's very drinkable though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PeterLemonjello,4.82,"Fantastic IPA. Great example of the style.  Appearance is a golden pale. Nice head and solid lacing  Smell is hops, hops, hops. Citrus dominate with some pine and floral hints.  Taste is hoppy, citrus, floral, bitter. Great balance between bittering hops and flavor hops. Finish isn't sweet but there is a dry malt flavor on the very back end.  Mouthfeel is very nice.  Drinkability is terrific if you are a fan of the style. If you don't like IPA's..this one isn't for you.  Great beer. It's simplistic: hops are hops and malts are malts. Not overly complex but everything is in perfect balance allowing one to enjoy this fine beer in all it's glory. Well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Infamous7100,3.15,"Please be aware this review comes from a non Hop Head.  Had this one on tap from the Cock and Bull in Glendale, Ohio.  A: Amber in color, possible mahogany. S: Very citrusy, a lot of grapefruit coming through. Some pine as well. T: The hops are huge. The citrus/grapefruit hits at first and the grapefruit sticks around and turns to the hoppy bitterness. M: The bitterness sticks around for a while and the beer packs a nice bite. The hops and citrus flavor mask the alcohol a bit, but the tongue feels the effects. D: If you are a Hop Head, this is a great beer. If you are not, it's worth a shot. It does what a good, hoppy beer should do. Satisfies your taste buds and hangs around on your pallete a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,donteatpoop,3.82,"A nice golder light-amber hued beer with a white head that leaves a nice lacing to the rim of the glass as i drink it down.  Full hoppy character by scent, no real presense of malt or anything else; grapefruity citrus effects.  The hops are very dominant in this brew, as to be expected given not only that it's an IPA but that it's from Stone. A pleasant upfront grapefruit-citrus followed by a kick of hops and a lingering dryness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BARFLYB,3.54,"12oz fresh bottle into a Philadelphia Flyers pint glass.  A- Stone's regular ipa is a light golden pale color with a nice milkshake head from a slow pour. Nice dense blotches of lace suround the glass.  S- A str8 shot of bitterning hops with grapefruit and other citrus scents. This gets a bit earthy as well with malt smells are at a minimum.  T- Like a lighter version of ruination. A huge wave of bitter hops with pine and grass but overall bitter with citrus. Some malts here and there, I guess?  M- Has a medium bold body with good carbonation within. Bitter up front and that does not go away at all, leaving for a long after taste. Goes down easy enough but the malts are almost non existent.  D- Perhaps it's just me but stones products always leave something to be desired and in this, the extreme bitter aftertaste is a bit much. Otherwise this is a decent ipa with a low abv",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

And let me tell you what, this first one has me really geared up rest.  Pale golden in color, with a bright head.  Smells piny and herbal, this is one stand out IPA  Taste is great, nice clean bitterness, with lots of flower/citrus notes. Smooth and well carbonated, overall a nice easy drinker. Its only too bad that I have to go all the way to WI for this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ROBORB,3.55,"Bottle poured into a regular pint glass this beer produced a hazy orange/gold color with a 2 finger head. There was some nice lacing present. The smell consisted of pine, hops, and citrus. I found the taste to be a bit of a let down as the malts far outweighed the hops. It was, however, very easy to drink and was still enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,alcstradamus,4.47,"A--Bubbly glowing amber color with a 2 finger head that dissipates down to a ring but leaves decent lacing down the glass  S--Big citrus and floral hoppiness that has me drooling to get a taste. Orange, grapefruit, even some banana in there. As big of a nose as most DIPA's, even the big boys. Great!  T--Taste is not quite on par with the nose but still, this is damn good. The big hoppiness is countered with an equally big maltiness that balances this one to the point of very little bitterness. Most of the taste is the floral hops and a slight caramel sweetness.  M--I really have no complaints here at all, this is the perfect balance between creaminess and carbonation that I look for in an IPA  D--This is so smooth that it is damn near chuggable, which isn't too smart at almost 7% ABV. A bomber might be too much at once though, I would rather just have 12 oz. and be done with it  Overall I thought this beer was spectacular. It may not quite be as good as the sum of its parts though, since the taste was the weakest aspect of it (although it was still good). I have had multiple others that taste this good, but none that are so good across all categories.

Taste: A very nice rich grapefruit and floral notes. There is a very nice malt backbone with just a touch of sweetness.  Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly astringent. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is bitter, but in a good way. I am big fan of Stone Brewing they have never let me done so far. This a very round well bodied IPA with great flavor.

147,88,Buschyfor3,4.16,"22oz bomber poured into a New Albanian Brewing Company pint glass.  A: burnt, glorious orange hue topped with a thin, bubbly white head about 1 finger thick that quickly dissipated. Rings of lacing appear on the side of the glass like notches as I slowly take on this IPA.  S: Good lord! A powerful floral aroma from hops; strong hints of pine; tangy, citrus notes, like fresh grated citrus rind; very herbal. This beer smells like it is about to wreck hoppy, spicy devastation on your tastebuds. I might be in trouble as this is my first real IPA!  T: As the nose foreshadows, this IPA opens with a surge of hop bitterness up front! Zesty, tangy citrus (orange rind, grapefruit) and pine flavors take hold of my tastebuds. After sitting and letting the flavors settle on my palate for a few minutes, I'm convinced that I just drank a gin and juice - piney, resiny, spicy. The finish is dry, kind of reminiscent of a spritzy wine. This beer is big, sharp, tangy and bitter; the malts are completely subdued by the strong-arm grip of the hops, and don't really contribute much in the way of balance.  M: The carbonation induces a prickly sensation on my tongue. Yet as I let this beer rest on the palate, I can't help but notice that it reveals a slightly syrupy texture.  D: So this is what IPAs are all about. Huge flavors, but at 6.9% ABV, only one bomber and I'm good to go - between the massive dose of pungent hoppiness and the nice alcohol presence, this is quite the assault on the senses. The only reason I dropped the drinkability on this beer is simply because of its effect on your palate - I couldn't taste much of anything else besides hops and pine for the rest of the night.  I've only really tried one other IPA (it was a Goose Island, and I polished off half of a bottle that a friend opened but disliked and I really didn't think much about it other than I'll be damned to let a craft beer go to waste at a restaurant). This Stone IPA was something else though. A good introduction to West Coast IPAs? It is a style that is clearly popular, but I'll have to seek out more examples to see if it grows on my palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Birmingham,4.33,"Aroma: I can smell the pine trees in this beer. There are hints of grassy and maybe some citrus notes.  Appearance: It's clear, medium gold with a tall white head. The head crashed quickly leaving thick lacing in the glass (gorgeous).  Flavor: It's a hop forward taste. The initial bitter bite carries through the tasting experience. I can taste the malt, but the flavor is balanced towards the hops.   Mouth feel: It has a medium body  Overall Impression: This is definitely an IPA; the hops smack me in the taste buds. I was surprised aroma was not stronger (the hops seem muted) until I looked at the ""Enjoy By"" date and it read 03/31/09. This was a bit surprising as I purchased the beer in mid-March (09).

This is followed by a light malty kick.  T- The taste is what makes this one a excellent session beer. Mild hop bitterness at first that smooths out at the end to a refreshing perfectly balanced finsh.  M-D- Very easy on the taste buds not one sign of anything that would offend my buds! Extra smooth finishing make this one of my choice beer to consume alot of.

147,88,greenjeff4141,4.92,"Pours a nice rich gold with not much head but good lacing. The smell is like being in a field of hops.  I took my first sip-- smooth as silk. Giant hop flavor, very mellow, and great balance. Not too bitter but tons of hops. Unnaturally easy to drink. Hands down my favorite IPA to date. If you don't like hops try a different brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeenJammin,4.32,"Stone IPA pours golden orangish color with a nice sized cream head. It has a pungent hop aroma with a bit of sweet malt. It has a very herbal, piney hop flavor. There is some citrus flavor in there as well. It rocks. Has a very crisp, refreshing medium mouth feel to it and it is pretty drinkable, although very high in abv for a single IPA. I would almost put it in the DIPA range if not for the brewery already having a different brew in that category.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,projectflam86,4.5,A- Pours beautiful orange color with a thick foam head that leaves nice lacing.  S- Strong hoppy nose with floral and fruity ester scents.  T- Hops come crashing through with the initial taste. Citrus flavors add to the complexity along with a bit of spice and little bit of pine flavor. There is some malt in the backbone to balance the hop bitterness.  M- Big and smooth. This one has some bite!  D- Wonderful all around brew. Lots of big hop flavor for the hopheads but it is balanced well with the malt and citrus flavors.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,aristeros,4.1,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. Two fingers of thick off-white head lingered and left thick lacing that followed the beer down the glass. Yellow, visible carbonation, can see right through the other side.  Tons of hops in the nose, some malts, some bitter citrus. Not overpowering.  Bracing pine hops, resins, and maybe a little biscuit, especially on the back end. Moderate carbonation impacts the mouthfeel, and hampers the otherwise good drinkability just a little.  Bitter fruit rinds linger, so you'll definitely want to cleanse your palate if this isn't the last beer you're drinking. Great pale ale, and I'm resisting the urge to go and get more of it right now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Nowhereman529,4,"A: Poured a nice golden color into the glass with very little in the way of head. Looks nice and crisp, not a bit of haziness.  S: Smell is nice, sweet hops, maybe a little pine thrown in for good measure.  T: Taste is straight up IPA, no frills, no punches. There's a nice amount of hops, but not overly hopped with just a bit of grapefruit tartness thrown in at the end.  M: Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Carbonation level is good.  D: This is a very drinkable beer. I could probably drink a couple of these on a summer afternoon. It's just plain good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,deltatauhobbit,3.8,"From a bomber.  Pours a hazy golden color with a slight orange tinge, ample head that fades at a decent enough rate and leaves some good patchy lacing on the glass.  Smell is hoppy but not overly so, decent malt backbone.  Taste has a nice balance between hops and the malt, not overly hoppy as to ""ruin"" your taste buds but enough to please, easy to drink, above average for an IPA although nothing truly stands out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Spikester,4.13,"Cloudy amber with a huge three finger head and good amount of lacings. Aroma is big bready and citrus hops. Taste is big citrus hops, grapefruit rind, some pine and resins. Malts are there but definately bringing up the rear. Mouthfeel is good very crisp, but slightly excessive carbonation. I may have served this a bit too cold. Overall an impressive IPA and just what I look for in a modern West Coast version. Drink 'em fresh for best results. Just had an old version and had to add these comments: Enjoy by date was July 4, 2013. so this is Oct. 17, 2013. Piney resins have assumed control of this beer. No citrus left at this point. A slight amount of malts remain and the beer is cloudy. Head was minimal but fair amount of lacing survives. So the moral of this story is drink fresh!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheTrevor,4.32,"This beer poured a cloudy copper color with orange highlights and a fluffy single-finger head. The smell is all different kinds of hops, it's herbal, floral, citrusy, and spicy along with a little bready malt. The taste starts off with some spicy hops that give way to some citrusy hops that give way to some piney hops that fade away into a surprisingly clean finish. The whole time there's also a sweet malt backbone that helps balance out the hops without overshadowing them. The mouthfeel has a little bit of thickness and and just the right amount of carbonation. One of the big surprises for me is how drinkable this beer is. Even though it's definitely hoppy I couldn't imagine holding on to a six-pack of this brew for more than an afternoon. A fantastic beer, a must try for anyone on this site.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,berserker256,4.44,"I'm pouring my bottle into a tall pilsner glass. (I need new glassware) This beer's got a bright orange/gold color and is quite transparent. Good and thick big-bubbled also. It smells awesome. Definitely hoppy but nicely mixed with a fruity paring and possibly a bit of bready. A little citrusy and spicey. An excellent combination of aromas. I don't think it can be improved upon. Heavy hop and pine flavor with a touch of sour. Not too much sour to be unpleasant, however. Contrasts of sweet fruit, bitter hops, grapefruit, pine, and malt all exist in the flavor to create a pretty damn good beer. Medium body, a little creamy, and a joy to sip down. Pine cone aftertaste... But that's expected with the style. This is one of the better IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,youngblood,4.15,"Pours a soft amber with very sticky white head that shrinks into beautiful lacework on the glass. Hop oils aboud in the nose, very nice florals especially. Could sniff this all day. This is a well balanced IPA featuring a gentle malt profile with bits of toffee and caramel. Leaves a nice citrusy after taste as the hop oil does it's work. Bit of pineapple maybe? Very easy mouthfeel and low ABV make this an excellent session beer. I want another now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Docer,3.98,"Grabbed a bomber at QFC. Poured into a tumbler glass... at an angle as I always do.  - Great mildly cloudy amber color... thin white head that dissipated quickly to a nice haze of lace. Just what a west coast IPA should look like.  - Nice crisp scent.. like fresh floral hops w/ a touch of pine, and a smooth n' sweet caramel malt profile.. smells balanced and smooth.. can't wait.. ok..  - Wonderful hop profile.. slightly bitter, cool n' crisp.. rather dry.. bit of pine.. some great citrus hiding in there.  - Slightly chewy.. but not so thick n' malty.. bitter, dry finish.. makes me wonder what a Stone ESB would be like :P  - Very drinkable.. bit bubbly.. not so much strength in flavor, hides it well. Session? Possibly on a night where I wouldn't have to get up early the next morning :-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnd513,4.5,This beer pours a nice honey color with a nice fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is very clean upfront with grapefruit and other citrus flavors. The smell is not upfront and in your face which is neither good or bad. The taste is much more agressive than the smell with big grapefruit and other citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is a tad thin for my likening but this beer is just so smooth and easy to drink that I hardly notice. I think I am simply comparing to other Midwest/east coast IPA's like hopslam or dogfish head that have that syrupy quality that I enjoy. Overall this is an exellent IPA that belongs to my long list of favoite IPA's. A must try.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,iuhoosier336,4.8,"What a great IPA. Poured from a bottle into a normal pint glass. The color is a light yellow, good head that remains, two fingers.  The smell is of hops and of slight citrus. The taste is earthy and very hoppy. Then the malt followed by the citrus. The hops in this one taste great. Good carbonation.  This is one great IPA and is it ever drinkable. A six could be gone by the end of the night easily but then I'd be unhappy without my Stones.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Beernoisseur,4.5,"Ah, the infamous Stone IPA. Long have I heard tell of its brooding and arrogant majesty.  But here it is, looking back at me from the other side of my pilsner glass. It looks fairly peaceful, perhaps even tranquil, with its constant streams of tiny bubbles continually supporting the pillowy head.  Today is my day.  Ok seriously, sorry about the fanfare. It's just that, being from Utah, there are many difficult-to-acquire beers that gain something of a legendary status (to me anyway). 90% of breweries don't ship here.  This looks like a pretty damn good beer. The color of fresh honey, with a towering off-white head, I hope these are just indicators of the goodness yet to come.  The smell is very fresh, and very tart. Outdoorsy, with pine and earthy elements. The hops are very present in the nose.  The flavor is a tad more subdued than I was expecting. The hops don't come right out and attack you like a pack of angry dogs. For some reason, the reputation of this beer, brewery of origin, and the design on the bottle all suggested that it would. however, it is certainly a world class IPA. One of the things I love about Stone is that they could give a damn about pleasing anyone but themselves. They don't make beers to win medals. They make beers that beer lovers will appreciate. Besides, who needs medals when you've got a fucking gargoyle on your label?  This beer is excellent. Now that my glass has had a chance to stretch its limbs, and warm up a bit, the malt is coming out a bit more. Some gently fruitiness is present around the edges. light sweetness accompanies. However, the hops and their characteristics are the captain of this vessel. Pine, grapefruit, and maybe a touch of herbal abound playfully, but not chaotically.  Mouthfeel is very good, the carbonation has maintained itself very well. Drinkability is spectacular. I would love to drink this again. and again.  and again...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jettjon,4.25,"From a 12 oz bottle with no visible freshness date, into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!). Slightly hazed pale orange color with plenty of carbonation from my SA glass. Nice thick two-finger cap of white-tan head fades slowly leaving a thick cap and ring. Nose evinces plenty of hops and citrus with a good bit of sweet fruit/malt in the background. On the tongue, the hops are certainly there but not overwhelming. Crisp and tart citrus hops with a bit of breadiness. Not a whole lot of sweetness, but the bitterness isn't overwhelming or sharp. Mid- to low viscosity; it's wet and even quenching in the mouth, again not sharp and biting. Creamy carbonation lends a soft and enjoyable feel. Maybe I'm jaded but I don't consider this to be much of a hop bomb; more of a fairly hoppy American style IPA. Drinkability is good even with 6.9% ABV. Alcohol is very well masked with only a slight burn toward the end serving as a warning.  Overall: A very good IPA, perhaps bordering on a ""double"" or ""extreme"" IPA. This one seems to be on the far end of the IPA spectrum, but taken in and of itself, is quite good. Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jacobseyb,4.53,"A=Nice honey colored appearance with healthy head when poured. Slight cloudiness noticed. Fine bubbles with sticky characteristics  S=Enjoyable smell, nothing extremely noticable, though it builds anticipation well  T=Great taste, slight bitterness detected though still thoroughly enjoyable.  M=Interesting mouthfeel considerable carbonation with tight bubble texture on tongue.  D=Thoroughly enjoyable and extremely drinkable, easily could have had several more.  Overall- Feel as if it lived up to expectation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,KenC411,4.01,"I heard tell of an urban legend. A beer so great that all bowed before its mighty taste. After ten reviews, I have finally decided to try some its glory for my self.  Appearance: Honey colored with a powerful two finger head that refuses to quit. Very few bubbles can be seen through the glass. With drinking, a thick lace forms on the side of the glass coating it.  Smell: Enormous citrus smell, like a mix of grapefruit and orange. A bit of buttery notes in the background. Unfortunately, the beer happens to remind me of the dish soap that I use, although I never have used soap in this glass. Though I do not think of it as the fault of the beer, but more of an unfortunate coincidence.  Taste: Amazingly complex. Initially it is sweet like honey, then the citrus taste bites in the back of the mouth. You can taste the alcohol a bit, though it is not off putting.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a proper amount of bubbles. The flavor dances around the tongue without forcing you to swallow.  Drinkability: A great beer. Blends honey and citrus in a creamy warming beer. One bottle is enough for me with the higher alcohol content and massive bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,swizzlenuts,4.42,A: THe beer is poured a cloudy golden colour and a nice finger's width of off white head.  S: The smell is filled with citrus hops and floral notes  T: The beer is slightly bitter with a huge citrusy/fruity flavour. The floral hops come through in the back with a slight bit of bready malts. This is pretty fucking good.  M: Medium mouth feel and good carbonation  D: I could take down a sixer of this quite easily!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,grayburn,4.38,"Another example of a wonderfully-hopped brew by stone. These guys have the hop profile down. Pours a light amber into the pint with a nice big head and some good lacing. Smells of pine and citrus, a great american hopbomb. The taste is the same, only more, the hops build upon eachother very well atop a nice malt backbone, I am quite impressed by this beer, no surprise anymore as far as stone is concerned. The mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer are both quite high. Very bitter, oily, just enough carbonation to wash it all away. Excellent beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FishGetter,4.15,"Served at cellar temperature in a SA glass. Pale yellow with slight orange hue. Restless head from an agressive pour. Sweet maltiness with an even amout of hop resins fill the nose. Slight fruitie esters can be detected also. Refreshing hop flavor that's clean and crisp! Great ballance of malt to keep the hop bite in check. Slight breadiness to finish. Medium body, heavier than what I expected, however did't take away from drink. This one's a Keepa!.

147,88,alovesupreme,4.22,"A white head sits with great retention and leaves sticky rings around the corners of the glass. Hop bomb. This is a piney IPA with a good amount of citrus. Once again Pine levels are extremely high for a normal IPA, with a splash of citrus such as grapefruit. A bitter hop finish that sits on the tongue for a long time. A full bodied IPA thats resinous and a little sticky and clean at the same time.

147,88,IMincedTheKing,3.2,"Pours the color of tea with a foamy, white, inch-tall head that dissipates slowly. Attractive lacing.  The nose is wonderful with a big smell of citrus and pine. Hoppy, sharp, and herbal. Not quite something I'd wear as a cologne, but oh-so-close.  The major flavor is of pine and citrus rinds, with a hop bitterness that I find slightly overbearing. Making everything worse is the thin, flat, and astringent mouthfeel; while it tastes okay, I can't get past the fact that I'd rather swallow it right quick and get rid of it (leaving a delicious aftertaste, by the way) than hold it in my mouth and pick apart the flavors.  Sadly, though it seemed promising, I don't see myself revisiting this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tim9887,4.3,"22oz bomber poured into a standard pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful hazy golden-orange. An inch of off-white foam. Very easy on the eyes!  Aroma: The hops dominate - a lot of citrus (grapefruit) character. The aroma has an almost floral hop quality.  Taste: Delightfully hoppy - has the same citrusy notes as the aroma. Very big emphasis on the hops and not so much on the malt although it does have a bit of balance - and that is in no way a complaint.  Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth, very drinkable.  Notes: By far one of the best IPA's out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BlackBearForge,4.42,"Pours a pale hazy golden yellow with a frothy white head fading to clumpy bubbles leaving a nice oily lacing.  Smell is very nice, clean grassy hops with a nice citrus grapefruit overtone with a touch of honey too.  Flavor is very good, lemony hops nicely balanced with a pale malt background. A bit tart and pleasanlty bitter with a mild grapefruit taste and a tad of resin. Very refreshing (of course I just came in from working in the garden so I could practically gulp this down!)  Mouthfeel is light, smooth and moderately carbonated.  Drinkability is very good, this may become my go to Summer IPA. I wish I had bought more than just the the one to review!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,callmescraps,4.07,"Good old Stone. It's been far too long.  Appearance - A light copper color. Plenty of nice foamy head. Very white head, very pretty looking beer. Great lacing.  Smell - Very nice hop balance. Both that nice citrus, with a hint of grapefruit, with a little pine mixed in. Great smell. Not an explosion, but very balanced and nice.  Taste - Very nice hop taste. It's very balanced. That pine comes in as well. With some sort of bread. It's got nice hop on the finish. The hops are there in the beginning and end, but the middle is a little bland.  Mouthfeel - Hmmm. It should be a little better. It's a little syrupy and flat. Just lacking some punch. It'd be nice if it was a little crisper.  Drinkability - Pretty solid. The hops aren't overwhelming so it's got nice balance. The finish is decent, it doesn't pack too much of a punch for 7% abv.  I love the way those hops linger. This is a very nice IPA. The hopping is nicely balanced, so it's quite drinkable. I like this beer an awful lot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,slumslum,4.25,"I picked this up while visiting friends in Virginia at the Total Wine and More.  First and foremost, I love a well brewed IPA. I enjoy a good Dogfish IPA, but I have to say this is a very close one for me. The Stone IPA is a very well crafted brew and has an amazing taste.  The Appearance and smell is like many other IPA... It poured with a decent head that really unlocked a well defined aroma. It is has a cloudy amber/gold color to it with. It has very few bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.  The taste is phenomenal... there is a very bold hops taste that leaves a very strong aftertaste in the mouth. If you are not a hops fan this brew might not be for you. I could taste a solid citrus taste as well.  Stone IPA is a very clean and crisp tasting IPA. As I had mentioned earlier the mouth feel is very lasting. After I had swallowed, the taste continued to linger in my mouth for bit afterward.  Given it's bold taste, I still feel that this is a very good beer and you could drink this for a night easily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cheapxceptbeer,4.79,"Thank goodness for the publick house, finally you can buy a great single beer without some jerk doubling the price on you, or the beer being 2 years old  A- Very pale colored, this beer starts off with a decent head which eventually vanishes, holds its lacing nicely, pleasant appearance but not the best quality of this brew S- It smells like a forest of hops, I can't explain it is the smell of a stone beer, ruination has that same smell, only stronger of course  T- Just citrusy hops that overtake the tastebuds, so good, not excessively bitter which makes it easier to drink, good balancing act by the malt but that is all, so fresh and delicious I ended up drinking this too fast  F- Slightly seltzery mouthfeel with a crisp carbonation finish, medium body, good for the style.  D- With its crisp finish, delicious taste, and a not too heavy feel I could easily have a few of these, but not worth having more than 3 as the delicious taste will be for not after you have burned your taste buds",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,joerodiii,4.42,"This is really an impressive IPA. I find most IPA's tough to drink more than one. This, however, could really be a session beer, in spite of the 6.9% ABV.  The appearance is somewhat cloudy, and there was minimal head. The aroma is very citrusy with some floral aromas mixed in. In spite of the high hop level, it is not a very bitter beer. The hop flavor far outweighs the bitterness. There is also enough malt present to prevent it from tasting like a hop tea and give it a really pleasant mouthfeel.  While the hops did not taste as fresh as they did when I had this beer on tap, it was still delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,buckobrock,4.24,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a 16 oz. pint glass  Bottled on ?  Consumed on 13 March 2009  A - Poured relatively hard into a 16 ounce, unlabeled pint glass. The head is somewhat delayed, and then rises to form a minuscule ""half-finger"" head. It's golden, very transparent - I can see the ACC tournament on TV through the glass - and the lacing is thin, having a hard time holding onto the glass. The carbonation is low, there's little bubble activity that I can see.  S - The first thing I pick out is pine needles, although not overpowering, it's just the first thing that sticks out. After a second whiff, I pick out some bread, a little orange peel, a slight lemon zest, and a graininess.  T - It has a strong malt backbone, but the malt is rather grainy rather than the mellow toasted malts I'm used to in an IPA. I sense some lemon zest, a lot of pine, and a little bit of biscuit from the yeast. The bitterness doesn't really come through until towards the end of the swallow. Upon second and third sips, I get a taste similar to butter or margarine. This beer is not as ""West Coast"" as a lot of other IPAs that I've tasted.  M - The mouthfeel is light to medium. It's very crisp, not as creamy or frothy as a lot of other IPAs. It's light on the tongue. These factors do contribute to a high drinkability, however.  D - Although not the best IPA I've had, it's a quaffable brew nonetheless.  Notes: I drank this side-by-side with a Bell's Two Hearted. Similarities include their reliance on citrusy hops for aroma and taste, while the floral hops are not present. Differences include the Stone's grainy malt backbone compared with the toasted malts evident in the Bell's brew.  Overall a solid, drinkable IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Patrick999,3.8,"Have been enjoying an awful lot of this beer on tap - I figured I'd pick up a sixer.  A - Poured into a goblet. Decent head, some nice lacing. Very clear gold.  S - Hoppy. Smells like soapy hop, too. Some really soapy hop. I swear, this glass is clean with no soap residue - that soapiness comes 100% from the hops.  T, F - Substantially the same as on tap. Perhaps I notice a little more grainy malt, but it's still really dry, and quite bitter, like sucking on a bar of Irish Spring. Lingering dry bitterness after it slides down your gullet. It's good, but...if you can't handle your hops, please give this one a pass. Medium body.  D - Hmmm, you know, I think I realize that I find this more drinkable after I've already had a couple other beers. At my favorite bar, this is my go-to beer, yet it seems less eminently drinkable here at home, in the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The taste is sweet with a blend of citric hops, floral hops, and some peppery feel to it as well.  I have heard many good things about Stone brewery and the IPA that they brew. I have yet to be misled by BA reviews in the past so I picked this up and gave it a try.  One of the best IPAs that I have ever tried, hell, one of the best beers I've ever tried.

Poured a orange with a very thing head. Smells of citrus and grapefuit just like I want it to. really nice fruit taste on the front end, not the biggest hop bomb, not the most complex IPA, but such a clean, structure taste it's hard to find fault in the simpleness. Here is a case where simple really works. Just a touch thin on the mouthfeel, not watered down, just a little thin. Still I could drink this all day and would be extremely happy the entire time. A classic that deserves every ounce of praise it gets.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,roscoehnj,4.22,Nice golden orange appearance with the bubble rising nicely in my tulip glass. Medium head but a little shy on the lacing.  Bursting with grapefruity hops on the nose - just like I like it.  Nice hit of citrus taste and a sharp hop bite especially on the after taste. Not the biggest IPA I've had nor the most complex but a classic nonetheless.  Mouthfeel is just a touch thin but that doesn't detract substantially from a highly drinkable beer. I will always come back to this one.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I like the look of this one. Strong earthy/piney hops dominated the nose with a hint of citrus(limelike?) to back it up. Taste comes out as it warms. Carbonation and light citrus hits the tongue first then a wave of piney hops bring it home. Hoppy-pine lingers throughout the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was good with a medium body and moderate carbonation. They go down with plenty of ease. I could drink this all night.  Note* I purchased these a couple of months after bottling and they were sitting warm on the shelf the whole time. The hops weren't quite as assertive as I hoped. I look forwarding to reviewing a fresher bottle someday to see what differences there may be. Regardless it was an excellent beer and can't wait for another sixer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mirish72,4.35,"Finally decided to give this one a try and picked up a 22oz bomber with my weekly Bigfoot purchase.  Poured into a Chimay goblet. I was surprised by the orange/tangerine color, but could instantly smell the hops and citric overtones. Almost no head, a really good looking beer.  Great west coast American IPA. Taste was satisfying but not overpowering, overall the beer has a great balance.  It was the first Stone brew I have tried, but it won't be the last. Up to now I have taken a pass because of the price and because I am not a fan of the packaging (I know that is lame, but when there are so many good choices you need some excuse not to try something new).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SeanRedd,4.29,"Golden tangerine body, no head, possibly my pour, with dotted light lacing as it drops. Awesome aroma of woody malt, spicy fruity hops. Spicy hop up front, bitter center, lingering bitter finish. Crisp and sweet at times with a zesty peel that boxes the sides of the tongue. Excellent clarity and a well hidden ABV. Hints of malt sap and grapefruit. Ridiculous balance and confident hop character. One of the best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A beautiful looking beer to say the least.  As I poured it into the glass I could already smell the flowers! It is so floral, overtones of pine and maybe a hint of citrus as well. I can smell the hops and its overall aroma makes my mouth water.  It is not too heavy, a nice medium body and appropriate carbonation. The taste is fantasic. So floral with overtones of citrus and as a lover of American IPAs I have to say Stone has the hoppie goodness down. It also features a solid balance of malt that makes the beer not too bitter but not too sweet. There is also a slight piney flavor, overall the beer is complex, enjoyable and everything an IPA should be.  I'd def. drink another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,taylorhamrick,3.77,"Pours out a very clear golden color with a nice 1-2cm white head. This one leaves great lacing, even after the head has fallen down to a little ring of bubbles. Looks really great, but it seems just a little bit lighter than I'd like to see an IPA. The smell is nice, some floral, citrusy, grassy hops. Actually quite a bit of hop resin in the smell. Almost leans towards a DIPA smell. Not really much maltiness to speak of, maybe just a whiff of sweetness. It's about what anyone would expect from an IPA. The taste seems to be a bit more bitter than a standard IPA, which is my main complaint, but there's enough of the hop flavor and aroma to fill in. This one isn't incredibly balanced, I can barely detect any sweet, malty backbone, and I can't taste the alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is nice, the bitterness makes you pucker and hesitate. I think this is lost somewhere between an IPA and DIPA, I like it but I'm not sure how well to either style it actually is. This one is very dry, like I would expect, with nothing standing in the way of the hoppy taste. This one really drinks well for almost 7%. You just keep taking drink after drink, and it is definitely worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This drinks like a double IPA without as much malts but still doulbe the hopping.  Mouthfeel is oily from the hops and the astringency on the tongue lasts and lasts.  Drinkability is so/so.

Don't know what the price is where you live, but for me it was being sold for $9.99 in the same place that was selling Sierra Nevada for $6.99, and honestly I don't think Stone is $3 better than Sierra Nevada. Like I said though it is a very good beer, great taste, extremely hoppy, which is what I want in an IPA, great mouth feel and color, overall extremely well done. It's just the price that gets me. If I'm paying that much for a 6, honestly I expect something more.  Great flavor and hoppy taste, but not liking the price tag.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma is subtle until I find enough room in the glass to swirl some head to life. Great hoppy smells that one expects from a West coast IPA.  Flavor is very hoppy yet balanced. Fruity and spicy in equal measures. Floral quality to it as well. Grapefruit and citrus come out as it warms.  Mouthfeel is good with medium body, light carbonation, and not too much burn from the bitterness. Drinkability is very good for the style.  I enjoyed this one from the bottle more perhaps because it was fresher. Either way, it's both smooth and drinkable without being boring. Still not as good as Ruination.

147,88,ncstateplaya,3.93,"Wow, the pour on this beer was simply amazing. The sun was shining directly into the glass, so the beer was a hazy saffron yellowish...a brilliant orange. Easily one of the coolest colors I have ever seen in an IPA. The head appeared creamy and white at about 1/4"" thick, but dissipates to form a gracious sheet over the surface. There was good lacing left in the glass.  Needless to say, this brew smells hoppy! A great pungent aroma, and maybe slightly musty. In addition to all of the hops there is a nice malt profile...lends a mellowness.  By all means this is a pretty bitter beer. No if ands or buts here, there is plenty of lemon zest to go around. The citrusy notes are complimented by loads of pine.  A medium bodied beer that fully coats the mouth. It is remarkably smooth and creamy for such a bitter IPA. There is a nice drying on the finish.  This beer is highly drinkable...its just so smooth. The bitterness is great and what I look for in an IPA. Damn shame the beer was gone well before I had finished my review.

Rather mild for an IPA, but quite nice.  T - Sweet on the tongue to start with mild citrus and breadiness. Bitterness takes over after that, leading to a dry finish with a serious alcohol kick. I was surprised by the ethanol - it seems much more noticable than in other 7% IPAs I've had.  M - Somewhat thick but smooth with moderate carbonation.

It's backed up by a solid malt aroma.  Tastes just how it smells. Loads of hop flavors with a hint of spiciness, yet the malt flavors still manage to make their way out and balance the beer. Ending is as close to being too bitter as a beer can get without being so.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a good thickness and the carbonation does a good job exploding the flavors.

You don't smell beers like this everyday.  T - Initially spicy and spicy in the end along with a nice bitterness that prolongs the hop flavor. The flavors are the same in the mouth, but are spicy where they were sweet in the nose.  M - Nothing offensive in the mouthfeel, an average amount of carbonation, not too watery, not too thick.

Nose is big on citrus - pineapple, grapefruit, orange all come through, sweet but clean.  Taste starts off with clean, lightly sweet caramel malt and lightly astringent hops, with a finish that allows the fresh citrus to really shine, and a lighter than expected bitterness lingering on the palate. The overall result is an utterly fantastic IPA - not overpowering, refreshing, flavorful, and one of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever had.

Smells of clementine juice, hop oils and lemons. Flavor is everything i would assume...perfect balance of citrusy hops on a nice soft malt backbone. Bitterness is there, but that's not the defining character of the beer, more of something that creeps in later, to remind you to take another sip. Its all about the delicious hop flavors and they get it perfectly right. mmmm. Smooth, medium body. Drinks like a dream. Excellent.

Couldn't decide on this or Ruination and chose this because of alcohol level. Well, that was dumb, as another 1% wouldn't have mattered. I'll have one more out of the six and be done with it tonight.

This beer can be described in three words: spicy, spicy, spicy. I drank two of these on Saturday night and that was about all I could handle. The spice is just slightly overwhelming for me. Maybe I'm not as much of a hophead as I thought. There is a very obvious scent of grapefruit. You can certainly taste the alcohol, and it does kind of hit you after a couple.

Appearance: Light coppery in color with a 1 and 1/2 finger pillowy head. Slightly cloudy.  Smell: Hoppy and bitter - perhaps a slightly floral bitterness in there as well.  Taste: Awesome - everything I hoped for. Wonderfully bitter but not like an extreme type of hopped beer, so it's got a great balance. Normally I'd expect a bit more of a citrusy flavor in there, but it seems absent to me in this instance.  Mouthfeel: It goes down quite smoothly, a little sticky and creamy in the mouth and definitely leaves the mouth feeling sticky. Perfect.  Drinkability: I live a good IPA, so I would put this high.

Very big beer in taste, but not too thick in any way at the same time. they really dialed in the hops to malt ratio on this one to make a very fine American IPA. Mouth feel is nice too...very soft pillow like carbonation, sits nice on the tongue and lets the tongue know it's still alive at the same time. Drinkability is...eh..a bit too high of an ABV to make it a session beer for me. After 4 I would be pretty drunk. I will definitely buy this again!  Notes: A wonderful AIPA! This is like perfect! A very impressive beer. Right up there with Titan IPA in my opinion",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jdklks,4.55,golden color with a nice white head that leaves minimal lacing.  smells and tastes of hops and citrus fruits. fruit sweetness up front with a bitter hop end that leaves you reaching for more. lots and lots of hops in this one.  medium bodied and has fantastic drinkability.  one of my favorite all-time beers. definitely recommended.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mullenite,3.92,"Very cloudy gold color with a 1/4 finger white head that made it's exit rather fast and left nice ring around the glass. Lots of sticky lacing despite this however.  Strait up hops in the nose, I'm almost afraid to try it as I wanted to review Vitus tonight as well. More citrus hops than I expected, I was thinking this would be very piney and floral for some reason.  Not as much of a hop bomb as the nose was leading me to think it would be. The hop presence is strong with little balance but not overwhelming. Some of the pine and floral tastes I was expecting in the nose do make an appearance with the grapefruit/citrus rind bitterness that was there.  A lot of sharp carbonation that I'm not too fond of but it doesn't really effect things too much. Fairly light bodied and easy to drink.  Overall this is a decent IPA, not my favorite but by no means is it as offensive and damaging to the palette as I thought it would be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Lambstrong,4.41,"It pours a golden hue and cloudy (unfiltered?). Slight white foamy head that dissipates rather quickly. Decent lacing.  There is an upfront intense hop aroma with citrus and grapefruit notes. One of the best aromas I've smelled in a beer.  This beer is beautifully balanced between the sweetness with lemon/grapefruit bitterness.  Lastly, this beer had perfect carbonation and the bitterness lent itself to a slight chewiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cpn920,4.25,Pours a golden color with a big frothy head that leaves great lacing on my pint glass. Smell is of citrusy hops and a little malt. Taste is good with a big slap of hops and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Very nice beer that is very drinkable.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pandashaver,4.32,"A - Hazy golden orange with 1.5 finger thick white head. Good retention and lacing.  S - Characteristic floral hops and citrus.  T - Great hop bitterness, perfect amount of sweetness to balance the hops and not destroy the palate.  M - Smooth and filling. Thick for an IPA, almost creamy. Good presence but not overly bitter on the palate, which is tough to accomplish with an IPA.  D - Being thick and full of character, I could only have a couple of these - but in the way you would a decadent dessert.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,KBoudreau66,4.33,"Pours a dark gold color with about one finger of frothy white head. Leaves lacing at the top of the glass.  Smells of piney, and citrusy hops. Undertones of grapefruit, and a subtle malts.  Has the a strong taste of piney/citrus hops up front. Malt undertones come through. Unbalnced, but delicious.  Has a medium body thats a little bit carbonated If you like delicious hoppy beer, this one won't let you down. In my top 3 favorite IPA's. Serving type: bottle",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sonicdescent,4.42,"Pours a see-through golden with one fingered white head with very active carbonation.  Scent of citrus and pine hops. Smells stronger than ruination.  Tastes of grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Very nice and rather robust for a ""regular"" IPA.  Medium body and low to medium carbonation. There may be a better combination, but this gets by.  Great IPA, very good on the drinkability scale as it is tasty and not harsh, if just a tad too high on the ABV scale for sessioning.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheDoorman,4.12,"As I review this beer, I am reminded that this is the beer that almost 10 years ago turned me craft. I am also reminded of how far my beer palate has come, and also how far craft beer has come since then. I remember this beer as the hop-bomb by which all hop bombs were to be judged.  Today, I note the pristine clear orange color of this beer with a nice white head, nice lacing, and visibible carbonation in the body. The nose is impressive. Hops are apparant as you even approach this beer. Florals, Citrus, earth tones. A nice belnd of hoppage. Perhaps some pine and freshly cut grass. The palate must be judged in two phases. Up front its a nice pale ale, in the back its hops really explode again. Up front, dare I say it is a touch watery, but the hops in the finish are subperb and bitter. Mouthfeel is light, oily, creamy, sticky and dry.  This is a fantatic beer. Whether good or bad, beer has come a long way since this beer turned me craft. Hop heads have a slew of double IPAs to turn to, including Stone's Ruination. When I am looking for my hop fix, the IIPA is where I usually turn, and when I am turning away from hops, IPAs don't really fit into the mix. Unfortunately, IPAs seem to fall by the boards sometimes.  A great beer with great hop action, but I will continue towards IIPAs when I need my hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dasenebler,4.42,"Pours a deep gold, with a modest yet natural, creamy head. Huge, delicious aroma of pine and herbal medicine. This is a liberally hopped beverage.  First taste bites you like sinking your teeth into a lemon, and I always love that first explosion of IPA flavor. The piney promise of the aroma comes through as well. Bitter, bitter aftertaste, but an adequate, malty/biscuity backbone balances things out. I've had it out of both the 22oz and 12oz bottles. Both are delicious, but the 22oz flavors seemed more delicate. Either way, you've got to try this beer. Creamy mouthfeel, not light, not heavy and very refreshing. Good medium-low carbonation. This beer is absolutely delicious, one of the best IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tittymcj,4.36,"Tried this beer after a recommendation from my good friend William Pang (Queens, NY).  Pours a hazy copper color, with a quickly dissipating head but excellent lacing throughout. The smell is of very strong floral hops, without much malt at all. The taste is very very strong. Lots of thick, bready flavor, but also a rather extreme hop taste, and a lasting bitterness after swallowing. It feels very light in the mouth and leaves a hoppy residue behind that stings for a while before the next sip. Low carbonation, but is easily made up for by the hop sting. Overall a great beer, very easy to drink because of the light, clean feeling it leaves behind. Definitely worth drinking on a regular basis.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,freeeekyyy,4.37,"a- Very light in color, even for an IPA. It's pale enough it could almost be a pilsener. Medium head, dissipates quickly, laces well.  s- All hops in the nose.  t- Very bready tasting. Refreshing and filling. Not a typical IPA, it actually seems a bit light compared to many, especially odd considering that it's a Stone brew.  m - Medium mouthfeel. Not super heavy, but it has enough substance to feel good in the mouth.  d - I could drink bottle after bottle all day. It's a wonderful, wonderful beer.  Overall, the Stone IPA is definitely worth trying and maybe even making it your regular ""buy every week"" beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Greggy,4.73,"Best by 11-24-08.. A little past, but I'll take my chances.  A- Pours a nice billowy, fluffy, thick white head with extreme lacing and great retention. The body is an orange/amber color with a hazy body.  S- I want to say this nose has some skunk on it, but I'm thinking it's maybe just hops. This is pretty unique for an Ipa. Big pear, pine notes, nice big hopiness with sweet malt peeking it's head.  T- Starts out with an excellent herbal character, almost clovy, with notes of orange, loads of pine and then transitions to an extremely dry finish which I'm just loving. Superb.  M- Light carbonation is good and the dry finish is great.  D- What a beer. Easily my new go-to IPA. Alcohol cannot be detected at all. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,yuenglings,4.05,"A: Served in a pintglass a light hazey yellow with a good thick head that left a nice laceing  S: A hoppy citris like smell to it  T: Like it smells sweet hoppy citris taste not bitter  M: Smooth and creamy, sweet at first ends with a nice drytaste in your mouth  D: Like all the brews i have tried from stone after you get a taste for the first bottle ya cant stop drinkin them",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,twbrewer,3.98,"A-Poured into a pint glass it has a clear golden color with a 12"" of off white thick and chunky looking head.  S-Smells of light,sweet,citrusy and clean soapy scent(yes soap,good soap)Floral aroma reminds me of a greenhouse.  T-Light and sweet hoppy flavor backed by a huge malt finish with more sweet hops lingering around to remind you this is a IPA.  M-Medium bodied beer with a clean,crisp feel,slighty dry finish.  D-This is one of the best IPA's I've had,not overly hoppy but enough that their presence is known.This is a must try for any beer fan.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gyle41386,4.12,"Poured from a bomber purchased at Green's in Columbia, SC, into a pint glass.  Pours a hazy golden with a fluffy white head. Decent retention with some sticky lacing.  Smell is of citrus and pine. I can tell from the scent that this is an aggressively hopped beer. Also some very light scent of sweet malt.  Taste is all hops, but not really bitter at all, which is quite a surprise. Nice dry finish.  Pleasant mouthfeel. Nice and creamy, medium body with good carbonation. The hops were not overly slick or oily, and like I stated before, the bitterness doesn't dominate.  This is just a damn fine IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SykDoc,4.42,"Poured from a bottle into a pint. This beer pours a reasonably clear golden color with a nice level of viewable carbonation. A bried head is formed that gets up to about an inch and then recedes to a full covered lacing.  The aroma is as expected with a nice combination of hoppy citrus and pine. There is a malty sweetness, as well.  The taste is, as it smells. There is a heavy level of hops although it is not overwhelmingly bitter. The malt again comes through mildly, but nicely. It finishes dry.  The mouthfeel is pleasant from the dryness and lack of too much bitterness. However, it does seem that it could be a little thicker to me. Carbonation is quite good for the combination.  Overall, this is a very drinkable beer if you like hops. It gives the exact components of a good IPA and I will enjoy this again when I can get my hands on it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,markaberrant,4.17,"A - slight haze, very light orange, billowy white head, leaves some ok lacing.  S - clean citrus and pine, tropical sweetness,  T - explodes with citrus and tropical hop flavour to start, but still a decent malt backbone in there, firm with a balancing sweetness, but it's quickly overcome in the finish with bitter grapefruit. Bitterness is not huge, but still no complaints in that department.  M - Creamy, but with a mild hop astringency, finish is dry and lip smacking, no alcohol presence, med body and carbonation.  D - a well executed IPA, though I'd expect a touch more bitterness for it's size.  Any complaints here are minor quibbles really, but this beer just doesn't have the intensity of their Ruination IPA, even though it's not that much smaller. I'd order the Ruination over this anytime, but it's still a very good second choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Rayek,4.12,"On tap at Que Bueno in Westminster, CO of all places.  A: Cloudy gold with moderate carbonation. Pillow like white head has great retention and leaves heavy lace.  S: Very fruity and floral, with scents of grapefruit, lemon and apples.  T: Lots of hop flavor without too much bitterness. Citrus flavors of grapefruit and lemon dominate, but there are enough other floral and fruity hop flavors going on to keep things interesting. Malt adds a slight caramel sweetness. Finishes very tart and dry.  M: Medium body feels oily. Carbonation level is right on.  D: A very nice IPA. I hope to visit this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,heinekenike,3.12,"I gave this low marks because the taste just was not there, but after reading other reviews, I realize I must have gotten a bad batch or something. NY is far from CA, I don't know...  Appearance seemed normal, smell very good. The aroma promised a nice, full hoppy taste. But the taste was lacking. A very light hint, and then a little stronger taste of hops on the aftertaste, but pretty weak for any beer.  Like I said, this was not the same beer that everyone else here tasted. I will definitely try this one again, and give a fairer review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Foxtrot,4.42,"Seeing as I've been liking IPA's lately, I thought I would give this one a go.  Poured from a bomber into pint glass.  This sucker poured a very nice straw/gold color with a decent a decent head and retention.  The aroma of this particular IPA is aggressive with lots of hop character, citrus notes and spices. Although it is aggressive, it is still very inviting.  The taste of this was for a lack of better words ""off the hook"". Starts out with intense flavors of hops and grapefruits. Very complex with a bread and biscuit finish that is so clean and smooth. One of the things I really enjoyed in this beer was the fact that the taste wasn't lingering for very long. Made take multiple sips to get the full effect.  The mouthfeel was good as well with decent carbonation and medium body. One of the best IPA's I've every had.  A very high drinkability, I could put away a few of these easy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,noknife83,5,"All bow down to the beer gods...Thank you Stone for this, this liquid poem of great beer. I wish I could put into words how much I love this beer. It is my all time favorite beer. Everything about it is great, the slight caramel taste it starts with, followed by a twinge of metallic, finishing with a slap in the face of hops...Also got to love the fact that its 6.9 abv. I love that 2 or 3 of these and I'm feeling really good...Thank you Stone...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brewnami,4.78,"Hands down my favorite IPA right now. Very clean, sweet, and hoppy. Nice citrus and hop aroma. Cloudy light amber color, almost looks like a hefeweizen. Moderate carbonation. I cant express in words how much I love this beer. If you don't like this IPA, buy a six pack of Smirnoff Ice and rent The Notebook.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Samminator,4.52,"A: Pale, hazy copper. One-finger head fades to a ring and sheeting lacing.  S: Brawny ""C"" hops - Pine Sol all the way. Aroma is so aggressive as to be a huge factor in taste; you can't get your mouth near the liquid without receiving a snootfull of hop aroma.  T: These hops are sparkle-bright. Almost no malt flavor detectable, though there is sufficient malt backbone to support the extreme bitterness. IBUs attack the roof off the mouth first, then the spiky tingle spreads over the whole tongue and mouth-floor.  M: What's the mouthfeel of hot sauce?? What's the mouthfeel of hydrochloric acid?? It's an unknowable entity; your brain doesn't register mouthfeel because your taste buds are being pulped and shredded. Same with this IPA - mouthfeel is simply not a factor here. Post swallow, a thick hop stickiness lingers for a FULL 25 seconds or more - remarkable!  D: I am enjoying this beer so much, that I was ready to rate the drinkability extremely high. Then I looked at my half-full pint glass and half full bomber and realized that this beer will take me a while, probably leaving me exhausted and not wanting another tonight.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BBThunderbolt,4.42,"Served in straight pint glass. A beautiful bright, clear gold color. Minimal head that dissipated quickly, leaving a very sticky lacing. Pleasing floral hop aroma. Flavor has a strong, smooth, even hop presence. This is not a bitter IPA, but still delivers a strong hop blast. One of the strongest points with this IPA is balance. The body is just slightly on the thin side.This beer has the backbone to stand up to the hops. This a very drinkable IPA that, due to the smoothness and balance can truly be sessionable. This is not a tongue-burner, you won't suffer from palate fatigue as with lesser IPAs. This is a go-to beer for me, it can always be counted on to deliver a great beer experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,superdedooperboy,4.03,"Always exciting to try a new Stone beer. Poured this one from a 12 oz. bottle into an oddly phallic-shaped glass that should perfectly enhance appearance, head formation, and aroma of beer. A great, strange $2.00 find indeed.  Pours a slightly-hazed golden amber with a billowing white cloud that settles slowly and leaves huge sheets of stick all the way down the sides of the vessel.  A bright nose is composed of citrus hop aromas, with notes of grapefruit and orange, with a hint of fruity esters, including notes of apricot.  Medium-bodied and nicely carbonated. A touch of sweet caramel malt flavor appears up front, driving right into a huge wall of hop flavors, with grapefruit citrus notes combining with herbal and somewhat fruity-bitter notes, all laid out over a bed of bread-like malt flavor. Finishes with a lingering bitter citrus flavor.  Delicious and an outstanding pick for a hophead. Highly drinkable, this one is yet another great offering from one of the most highly-rated breweries in the country.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JBogan,3.85,"Pours a hazy gold with a large white crown which left good lacing behind.  Smelled of hops and citrus along with a malt backbone.  Tasted of hops and grains, with a citric tartness at the tail end. The malt doesn't come into play as much as it did in the nose.  Mouthfeel was very good. Medium bodied with a good clean crispness about it. Smooth and refreshing going down.  This was a good IPA. Not the best I've had but certainly close to the top tier.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Clydesdale,4.5,"A: A somewhat hazy golden-orange color with a fairly large, fluffy and frothy white head with excellent retention. Lacing is quite good.  S: Spicy, intense herbal and somewhat grassy hops. Also touches of pine and orange. Orangey and other fruity, estery aromas as well. Some bready background malt is detectable also.  T: Big, spicy herbal hop flavor and bitterness up front. The hops are far from one-dimensional, however, with piney and citric undertones. Some darting, fruity ester flavors that are certainly appealing. A bit of biscuity malt and some grassy flavors at the finish. Some yeast, alcohol, and soft metal in the aftertaste.  M: Rather full-bodied and crisp, with a robust but well-controlled bitterness. Dry in the finish, as you'd expect. Fairly smooth, all things considered.  D: This tastes awesome, and is a big, aggressive beer. My first Stone product and I'll be very curious to try the rest of their line after this first foray. A sipper, but an easy sipper all things considered.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,HalfFull,4.08,"From cask, pumped into a pint glass. This brew pours a hazy golden yellow in color with a full inch of head, reducing UP to a half inch of head as the beer settles. I say this as the froth of the beer engine did resemble a nitrogen pour initially. Offers strong retention and good lacing.  Smell is very clean and hoppy, with a touch of malt undertones. The Centennial hop seems well suited to the cask as I've had other, more citric/floral IPA's on cask which didn't fair as well and seem better suited to regular draft.  Taste follows suit and offers a wonderful texture on the feel. Any bitterness is put on the shelf per se and well masked behind the yeast and cask influence. Nice drinkability but limited a bit by the underlying beverage. I've found Stone IPA to whither out before the end of the glass in the past, but the cask version does seem to hold on just until the end, but not by much.  Quite nice and much preferred over the more available standard draft given the body of the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnnybgood1999,2.98,"I went to Richmond and visited total wine witht the intention of tasting some brews I cannot get in Missouri-where I go to school. Anything from Stone was high on my list. This ale did not live up to its reputation. Apearance and smell were average. A nice hoppy aroma was very apparant signalling a good IPA. The taste was average as well. The ale seemed to possess no balance. The consistency was very light,which I did not like. It was hoppy enough for an IPA, but something did not click for me. Other IPA's, such as those put out by Great Divide and Avery, are more to my taste. I was excited about this ale and almost wonder if I got a bad bottle of the IPA and Smoked Porter, considering the rave reviews they recieve.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Monkeypaws,4.35,"I got to pick up a 6 pack of this on a recent trip out west. Great IPA, lots of hops up front and lingering afterwards. It is one of the lightest colored IPAs I've drunk, nice and bubbly in the glass.

147,88,sweetbrew82,4.62,"22 oz. bottle into a tulip; no freshness date  P: Pours deep straw from the bottle, and sits honey gold in the glass. Tall, statuesque white head thats rocky and comprised of medium-sized bubbles. Very good retention, and finally settles to form a halo with a thin film in the middle. Great lacework!  A: Toasty malts, mouth-watering pungeant hops that come off citrusy, piney, and a bit floral. Also some honey and grass underneath.  T: Obviously, the hops dominate throughout. But there is a nice, toasted bready malt spine that sets a solid foundation. Hop flavors consist of grapefruit, orange, lemon and some flowers. Some grassy notes are buried under there as well, and there is some honey that seems to flash towards the back end. Each sip is magnetizing! Finish is exquisitely dry and features some great hop bitterness to play off of some of the sweeter notes. Some hop oil residue is left on the tongue that leaves my whole mouth tingling on the way out. Absolutely outstanding!  M: Medium-full bodied, a bit creamy, smooth and moderately carbonated.  D: Drinkability is just plain great! How could this not be easy to drink? A 22 oz. bottle just ain't enough.  Notes: This is one fantastic IPA. Once again, Stone doesn't disappoint. Hop domination is the goal here, but the underlying malt makes it all possible. Delicious hop flavors just seem to dance on the tongue, but isn't one-dimensional due to the supporting flavors that add some depth. Highly recommended",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JollyToper,4.52,"Poured from a 12oz bottle purchased at AJ's Grocery in Scottsdale, AZ.  Appearance - Cloudy and golden. Not bottle conditioned. Very easy to get a nice two finger head. Shrinks fairly quickly but not completely. Leaves nice lace on the glass.  Smell - Wow! Hops! Very nice.  Taste - As promised on the bottle and expected from the smell, lots of hops but a little malt balance in the end. Would never guess that it was 6.9% ABV from the taste.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability - It's a big beer with lots of hops but very smooth.

S - wow. just from pouring I could easily smell the delicious bitterness of the hops. I am also picking some spicy esters behind the over powering hops.  T - one hardly notices the near 7% abv with this smooth and crisp brew. The smell and taste of hops combine together in the drinking experience (assuming you are not congested) to make something wonderfully uplifting for the palate, with a bitter, and then later spicy aftertaste  MF&D - a full feel to this beer, not as thick as a grade A syrup, but far from water; it lets you know you are drinking something good. the slight cripy-ness to the carbonation makes me (and even my mother!) coming back for more, very smooth and more than a pleasure to drink.

Most IPAs hit that one ""oh, hops!"" and is otherwise not that great. but this one had a great rounded hop flavor like a taste experience within the overall beer tasting experience. m- great, with the maltiness coming up after the hops and filling the mouth. doesn't leave any stickiness on the tongue either, just washes down extraordinarily well. D- really good if you're a hophead. i like to keep things in balance, so i doubt i could session this all night (and i'd end up on the lawn) but it's so good I'm sure people do all the time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,redneckchugger,4.18,"poured a tan amber, loads of white heads, cascading lacing down my duvel tulip. smells of grapefruit and pine needles,in other words hoppy, but the smell isn't as strong as i expected it to be. taste is all citrus hops, very little malt, very out of balance and i like it, much better than the smell suggests this beer goes down great, good example of the style, it will probally be a staple in my fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,caddybuyer,4.07,"From a 12 oz. bottle from a 6er  A-slighly veiled bright yellow/orange with a tasty looking thick frothy head that suds up nicely.  S-Hops, herbs and citrus, a bit of pine, and, oh...did I say hops?  T-Much sweeter in the initial sip than the nose would lead you to believe....a huge orangepeel/grapfruit sweetness with a pine backbone that is typical of Stone, with an aromatic hop kick that is neither harsh nor arrogant, but simply balanced. A treat.  M-Balance reigns here as well, a good medium body and carbonation.  D-Very drinkable, but I never met a Stone product I did not like. Unfortunately, the only one widely available in NJ in six packs.  I very much like this beer...the only thing keeping this from a higher rating is appearance and color...this is a bit lackluster...but close your eyes, and this is a true winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sgoodship,4.15,"Picked this up at the Liquor Stop in Highland, Indiana after a visit to 3F.  A: Yellowy hazy amber that is very yellow toward the bottom of the glass. Thin head stays throughout. Fluffy off-white head. Pretty good big lacing.  S: Not as powerful a hop smell as I was expecting. Hop profile is orange and grapefruit. Also has a syrupy sweet malt that becomes dominant as the drink progresses. The smell was fresh but so many talk about the strong hoppiness of Stone that I am worried that I go a bad 6.  T: Some fruity, grassy hops up front. Goes very quickly to a caramel malt and has a very subtle finish. Well balanced. A little watery at times. Again, I was expecting a wallop that never came although toward the end of the drink, it delivered a more piney bite. I'll re-review this brew in future if I find that this was a sub-standard 6. For now, all I can say is that it is a pretty subtle but enjoyable IPA.  M: Pretty clean and smooth. Light in body. Subtle level of carbonation that is just right.  D: I find IPA's very drinkable in general. The more balanced and subtle nature of this one makes it a very easy beer to session. I am going to get this in future to see if it has a stronger hop aggressiveness that was missing from my 6.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PintOHops,4.75,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a hazy yellow with just a touch of copper. An inch or more of head that seemed to last forever, spotty lacing & medium-high carbonation. Smells of very, very bright citrusy floral hops, with a wonderful spicy burnt/toasted aroma. A touch of raisins with some pine notes. A little dry as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of strong floral & potent hops, with a nice burnt biscuity malty aftertaste. Strong hop bitterness lingers well, there's a touch of raisin & piney citrus notes as well. As it warms, you can taste some dry alcohol (Not offensive) Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, chewy & medium bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - One could only drink so many of these heavily hoped brews. So id say about 2, but let me say that it is very, very good. This is a great example of an IPA. I absolutely love the intensely floral hopyness of this beer. I have not yet experienced it in any other beer. I love this beer, it very well might be my favorite IPA. Folks, you need, no! Must try this IPA!  Another fantastic beer from Stone Brewing Co, you wont be disappointed. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,LilBeerDoctor,3.88,"Reviewed on 6/28/08. Bottle. Pours a clear, light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of citrus and piney hops. Flavor of nice citrus hops. The bitter hops were balanced nicely with a strong malt base. Not as bitter and powerful as Ruination, more light bodied. The strong point of this beer was its nice malt/hops balance. Still, I would have liked to see a little more flavor. A very good IPA, though not my favorite. 7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,yesyouam,4.64,"This IPA is a hazy light amber with a fluffy and elastic white head that has great retention. The aroma is hoppy! It is tangerine peel with spruce. It is almost creamy on the tongue. The carbonation is appropriate and it leaves the mouth cleanly. The flavor is dominated by tangerine peel. Bold and bitter! Yes!

The pour: Classic golden orange haze, the perfect color for an ipa. Nice head to as well which settles beautifully.  Smell: lemon zest, orange  Taste: Big bite of hops! What else can be said. Finishes great with a nice overtone of citrus.  Drinkability: Yes. I enjoy at home to avoid repercussions. My favorite session beer to date. Goes well with or without food.  The only downside is the price tag. Would enjoy more if they were priced more along its peers (ex: dogfish). That aside, its worth every penny, therefore I splurge when the Gargoyle calls.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Citrus/pine hops, nice malt.  T: Big citrus hops (orange, some grapefruit). Also some nice piney hoppiness as well. Some spicyness in the back. Malts are there initially, then the hops take over.  M: A little thin for my liking. Good level of carbonation.  D: Good drinkability. Well balanced, not overpowering. Solid.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SerieDNo3,4.48,"22 oz. bomber poured into a mug  A: Pours a clear gold, with a creamy off-white head. The head dissipates relatively quickly, leaving a bit of foam in the centre, and beautiful lacing down the glass.  S: Piney hops, a slight bready aroma, and some citrus notes.  T: Crisp hops, with only just enough malts to provide balance. Lots of piney flavors complemented by some fruit flavors.  M: Crisp. Very crisp. Pretty much perfect carbonation, and a generous amount of hops, rendering this a very refreshing beer.  D: The 6.9% ABV is hidden very well. If it were a little lower, this would be a perfect session beer. I tried this awhile back, and was slightly underwhelmed, but that was probably not fresh enough. This is an excellent kid brother to Ruination. I'm going to be drinking a lot more of this in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,magictrokini,4.45,"One of my favorites. Average for Stone's standards; big hops flavor with citrus backing that does not let up. Crisp bitter end.

147,88,cadizkyguy,4.16,"I think this beer has the best possible appearance, that's why i gave it a 5.0 score on appearance. and the smell, taste, mouthful and drinkability aren't far behind. This is, by far, the best IPA i've had in quite some time. Again, the appearance, and the way it pours into a long fluted glass, makes you want to sit down and just stare at its beauty before taking that first taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nickfl,4.42,"A - The body is a clear, orange-yellow with a one finger, bone white head. The foam settles quickly, but leaves nice, sticky lace in its wake.  S - Earthy, spicy hops with some floral, juniper character and grapefruit as well. There is some malt in there as well, but it is hard to discern under the big, juicy hop notes.  T - Fruity, citrus hop flavor along with strong bitterness up front. Sweet, bready malt appears in the center in an attempt to balance things out but is quickly overwhelmed by the juicy hop flavors and strong, clean bitterness in the finish.  M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.  D - An excellent, easily drinkable IPA. The hop oils are center stage in this beer and while the bitterness is nothing to scoff at, they clearly made the right decision by going for flavor and aroma instead of just bone crushing bitterness. The hop aroma and, more importantly IMO, flavor have a crisp, fresh character that keeps the beer drinkable and avoid the muddy, mouth coating hoppiness that some big IPAs fall prey to. Overall, an excellent, and unusually drinkable, example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mmccllm,4.17,"Bottle. Wow, this is good. Hoptastic aroma. I want to bathe in this. Pour it all over me. Taste is amazing. Heavy hops, but not totally unbalanced. Very quenching. I could drink a few, and that's what makes a great beer. I will definitely be drinking this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bowersdm,4.45,"A - a very light shade of gold, much like the urine of a person who doesn't drink enough water. The head was small (1.5cm) and stiff. I would have liked a little more head.  S - hops, floral and citrusy/spicy  T - any touch of malt is only noticeable as a slight sweetness at the very beginning. Then comes a strong hop bitterness vary hints of citrus and spice. Finally, there's a lingering floral hop taste.  M - Good, I guess. This is my first IPA, so I'm not sure.  D - Great. This is a very easy drinking beer that I could put down quite a few times if I wanted to.

147,88,IBUnit63,4.75,"Well, since it's been a while and I've sampled many offerings since I wanted to re-review my favorite beer, Stone IPA. Text and stats on the original review follows. Long story short...it's still right up there...  12 oz. into Duvel tulip...  2+ finger butter/eggshell head tops a clean and still honey/copper body. Head is slightly meringuish with great staying power and a lot of lacing. What an IPA should look like.  Grapefruit is subtle yet strong with slight floral notes and mild caramel malt. That's what I'm talkin' about...overall citrus is dominant but not one-sided - aroma has Beautiful Chemistry in spades.  Caramel malt comes forward in an even keel. Hoppiness manifests itself in more of a bitter citrus tone than on the nose...with a little warmth there's solid balance but the citrus and malt do quiet down rather quickly.  This achieves almost perfect balance on the palate. Malt is clean but hearty and hops provide ample bitterness and citrus. Finish is strong and even-keeled. Husky but bright. Never gets old.  One of the most drinkable beers around in my opinion and my favorite beer to drink all-around. Excellent for all seasons - hearty enough for cold, light enough for warm. Quenches thirst and provides a strong but clean flavor profile.  --- Original review stats and notes:  A+ / 4.85 look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | drink: 5 rDev: +12.2%  Understatement of the year: Over-abundant flowery hop aroma. Very clean mouthfeel with undertones of ripe citrus. Although the hops are as plentiful as can be there is no unpleasant bitter after-taste whatsoever. Out of a bottle this is absolutely as good as it gets for an IPA and, in turn, for beer as a whole. Taking the last one of these out of the fridge is always a sad experience for me, until I get more!

147,88,AMoceri7,3.9,"So, I just so happened to get robbed the two days ago I bought a Stone Brewing Company Stone INDIA PALE ALE and instead 4 out of the 6 were that and the other two were Stones PALE ALE. Not paying attention to the bottle, pouring it into my beautiful Rogue Revolution pint glass eager to try it I had begun to rate a Pale Ale in the India Pale Ale category. Wasn't pretty, so my apologies to anyone who read it.  A: Gold, sheer gold. Great head and great lacing to the last sip. Enough said.  S: Hops hops and more hops, but there is a distinct GANJA smell to this. This is not a mistake for hops as other IPAs Ive had dont reek as bad as this one. Probably the most potent of the smells is the weed. Has to be, of course the legal stuff. I hope... Anywho, some malt sweetness with a faint yeasty fruitiness.  T: Undoubtedly chinook accounting for most of the bitterness. But crazily smooth. Very good, nice grapefruit hop bomb flavor. A bit watery mouthfeel compared to other IPAs I've had. Cant say this is balanced, but it kicks.  M: Great carbonation jumps across the palate nicely. Leaves a mild bitterness after sipping.  D: Under par, just couldn't do more than two.  Overall: Why drink this when you could have a solid Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA? Probably wont go out of my way to buy this again. But all in all, Good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The aroma is mostly hoppy, with pine and a touch of sweet malt. Not a real powerful aroma for an IPA, but very nice nonetheless. Tastes mostly hoppy, but the hops don't dominate the taste. The hops are nicely complemented by the malt and pine, and a nice bitterness follows. The taste is very well balanced and doesn't have a powerful hoppy bite. Light to medium bodied and doesn't leave a whole lot of stick in the mouth. This IPA is nice and smooth and goes down real easy.

147,88,bifrostguard,4.1,"A - A very light, translucent copper color with a tall off white head that sticks to the sides a bit.  S - Piney and yeasty.  T - Piney hops are present in the beginning and all the way down to the bitter end. I have not had another IPA quite like this. Usually there is a citrus element to west coast IPAs, but not in this one. Malt backbone is overpowered by the hops which leaves wanting more.  M - Pretty thin, but enough to hold things together and only adds to the drinkability.  D - Very nice session beer.

It pours a beautiful hazy golden orange color with ok head retention with very sticky, off white lace.  The aroma is impressive, with strong notes of pine and floral and citrus. And I detect some biscut malts, then nothing but hops wofting to my nose's delight.  The taste is a little hint of sweetness and a lot of hop flavor. The bitterness is there, but very soft. It is far from harshness. No grapefruit, mainly pine and citrus in the flavor... something like lemon juice. And also the biscut malts come through in the flavor.

It is really really great, can't say its perfect, as i prefer a little more intense nose, but seriously its great!

Feels great to drink not to thick or carbonated and after you drink it you feel like a hop breathing dragon.

Picked up a single at Discount Liquor on a recent trip and poured into Stein.  A - Pours liquid gold. One finger of creamy head that dissipates quickly to a complex lace. I was hoping for a little more head, but perhaps the bottle was old.  S - A delicious combination of hops, grapefruit, mandarin orange, pine, and the tiniest bit of malt. My only knock is that it may be a bit pedantic when compared to all the other IPAs created since.  T - Sweeter than it smells - starts off like tangerine citrus candy, then fades into a slightly bitter hop aftertaste. There's also some floral notes in there a well.  M - Just thin enough to be eminently refreshing, just creamy enough to match the depth of flavor. A bit of carbonation to tickle the mouth.  D - Highly sessionable, even at 6.9%. I wish this could be my staple beer like it is in so many other parts of the country. Whither art though, Stone?  Awesome, cheap, and available (outside Illinois) - what more do you want from a brew?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,sprucetip,3.98,"On tap at Skagway Brewing Company in Skagway, Alaska.  Extremely clear, pale golden yellow. Thick white head with decent retention and persistent lacing.  Floral, citrusy hop aroma, mainly, with a bit of malt noticeable. Aroma is pleasant, not overwhelming, but also not especially complex.  Grapefruity hop bitterness is prominent but not overdone. Bitterness fades some in the middle with the malt becoming more evident, then reappears at the back of the tongue, with less assertiveness, for the finish. Noticing the alcohol flavor at the finish as well. Balanced toward the hops, and not especially complex.  Moderate carbonation, a little tingling, and no discernable warming but with alcohol flavor. A bit thin.  Some may find the bitterness a bit sharp, but for many IPA fans, this could easily be a session beer.  This is a solid IPA. To me, not one to write home about, but very good. When my first homebrew IPA, based off a clone recipe for this beer, came pretty close to this I was stoked. But there are many IPA's I prefer to this one.

I did get a slight flowery aroma, obviously, hops are a flower.  The beer was fairly thick and I got plenty of the hops in my first taste. I really like this beer and there was not an overpowering aftertaste. The bitterness really comes through while drinking this beer.

Good head and lacing throughout most of the drinking experience.  Distinguishing hops aroma - there's no mistaking an IPA here, Ray Charles could spot that.  Good sweet malt taste but it is quickly overtaken by the strong hops. Hops dominate this brew. Oddly balancing, not overly bitter.  Very good mouthfeel, very refreshing. The hops stick around and dance around on your tounge. Medium bodied for such a high abv (6.9%).  Very drinkable if it weren't for the high alcohol content. I wouldn't have more than two in a night - I don't want that Stone gargoyle laughing at me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Soonami,4.67,"poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass  This is the beer geeks IPA. It's a hop punch combination to the face, with jabs of sweet and grass followed by a haymaker of bitterness. A slightly reddish hazy beer with medium, full body and pleasant carbonation. For me it's hard to really make out any of the malt characteristic as the hops are such an affront to my taste buds, but there is some sweetness from the malt and it clearly makes up the body of the brew.  I can drink a couple of these in a session, but then it just ruins my palette for any beer that doesn't pack the same wallop as this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jujubeast6000,4.1,"Reviewed 11/1/2005 (bottle):  The pour creates a body that is amber in appearance, and has an average off-white head. A very hoppy aroma with some floral scents. Has a malty flavor, is slightly sweet, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very hoppy taste. Damn good!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DavoleBomb,4.47,"Poured into a pint glass.  4.0 A: Vibrant orange in color. A little hazy, as if it were bottle-conditioned, but I don't think it is. Not a lot of head, even with a semi-aggressive pour. Decent amount of lacing considering the lack of head.  4.5 S: My my my, this is screaming deliciousness at me. Big citrus hop aroma followed by spice and fruity esters. Sweetness and bitterness marry as if you hybridized an orange with a grapefruit.  4.5 T: A lot of hop flavor, maybe even more than hop bitterness. I'm loving it. Grassy, citrusy, woody hops make up this flavor. There's a sweet and sour fruitiness and a biscuity character from the malts. Very good hop/malt balance.  4.5 M: Medium body, creamy as all hell. Very nicely done.  4.5 D: This is the kind of beer I want to drink when I hit up a bar. The beer is the centerpiece, not the people there. Big, bold flavor keeps me coming back for more.  I've never enjoyed an IPA so much that didn't qualify as a double/imperial.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zeff80,4.57,"A - Poured out a cloudy, burnt orange hue with a foamy, bubbly, white, two finger head. It left sticky patches of lace on my New Belgium goblet.  S - Aroma was fantastic! It was an assault on your senses of citrus and floral notes. There was an underlying roasted malt nose, too.  T - It tasted of citrusy hops that provided a mild bitterness. The roasted malt brought a caramel sweetness to balance out the hops.  M - It was crisp and sharp. A medium-bodied beer.  D - This is an outstanding IPA. It really is masterfully balanced for a great taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rye726,4.26,Pours a light brown with a lacy tan head. The nose has a nice collection of floral hops and sweet fruity malts. Well balanced flavor profile. The malt variety really compliments the bitter hops. Medium body is well carbonated. A great IPA from Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ruck304,4.32,"A legend has been born. I have finally found this wonderful brew after looking for it in at least 10 stores. Lowe's Foods! haha  A: Rich, cloudy orange/yellowish hue. Froth is even a slight yellow color that hangs onto the side of the mug.  S: Sweet smell. Definitely floral, can't place the fruit or the smell exactly.  T: A lot of flavor. Somewhat bitter, yet very strong. A great IPA. One of the strongest I have tasted.  M: Starts really smooth and then there is a quick bite. Nice and strong.  D: Great IPA. Reminds me of Sierra Nevada but stronger.  Reviewed on November 4, 2008 while watching McCain get whooped. This country is going to hell!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Pleepleus,4.33,Poured from bomber to Mug a dense cloudy apricot color with a thick cream head that settled to a 1/4 inch throughout with heavy lacing. Smells of sweet fruity hopsice. Taste is heavily hopped but the bitterness is minimal and it is very smooth. I will have this again and again. Stone is one of my top 3 breweries in the US and this one confirms their supremecy.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DeepSix,4.32,"Poured into a pint glass. Not sure how well I did this, because I believe they have yeast in this bottles, but I just poured the whole damn thing in, not sure if that's how I was supposed to or what, oh well. Light amber color but very cloudy (guessing that's the yeast) And about an inch and half of head and laced along the glass.  A lot of citrus smell with hops and minor tones of malt.  Damn hoppy but not too bitter, the malt counterbalances it well, but still keeping it as a true ""IPA"". A noted carbonation here, medium body and some bitterness here. Its more better in mouthfeel then the taste.  Damn god American IPA here, maybe one of the better I've had. Really wanna try it on tap, to get away from this yeast in the bottle thing I'm unfamiliar with. While a lot of other people are saying this is a session beer and/or they could drink a shitload of these. They should note the fairly high 6.9% ABV and probably limit themselves :) Its a great beer though and one could find it easy to overlook this logic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bacabuck,4.85,"Could this be heaven in a bottle? I think it might just be.  A: Rich, clear golden hue. Tall oatmeal colored head with tight froth that continues to lace down the sides of the glass  S: Big hoppy must with lots of yeast  T: Wow. Bold and rich. Finishes with a nice clean bitterness that you would expect  M: Smooth  D: Pour me another. One beer can easily turn into a session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MrHurmateeowish,4.77,"22oz bomber from The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours a hazy yellow-amber with a thin film of off-white head that leaves some lace. Smells amazing - orange, grapefruit etc hops dominate for sure with just the slightest hint of malt. Bright citrussy hops dominate the flavor - orange, grapfruit, and slight pith. Slight caramel and biscuit malt help to make the hops not overpowering. Nonetheless, hops dominate and create perhaps one of the finest hop flavors in any beer I've ever had. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. An easier drinker than expected, considering the ABV and big flavor. Perhaps one of the finest IPAs I have ever had. Phenomenal in almost every way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mugglesandhops,4.54,"I was able to get this on tap at my local pub, i have had it before in a bottle when i lived in california. The color is a orange almost red and smells citrusy with a hint of pine in there...i love stone and there ipa is my favorite so this is a great beer. the taste is great also",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,twiggamortis420,4.17,"Drank this one from a short pilsner glass. It's a medium-dark golden color with a surprisingly thin light beige head. A lighter color than most IPAs.  Citrusy hops are the most apparent trait in the nose. There are definitely some light malty scents in there as well, delivering a slightly earthy, biscuit like aroma. Nose is somewhat muted and more balanced than many a west coast IPA.  Mmmmm, more of a grassy hoppy flavor than the citrusy nose indicates. I taste alot of hay and biscuit flavors. A very approachable and drinkable IPA. I like it! I can see why they did the Ruination...while this might not satisfy the uber hopheads of the world, it is a very tasty beer and I could see this as a great introduction to the world of big, super hoppy beers.  I really like this beer. It is well balanced and highly drinkable. It will be hard to keep this on hand as it is oh so tasty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,xsists,4.52,A - Very light golden yellow. Quite clear. My pour had a small amount of head but it stuck around for a while.  S - Huge floral smell. Slight piney smell. Quite sweet.  T - Huge flavor. Very hoppy with a slight citrus flavor. Has great bitterness.  M - Light mellow feel that somewhat tickles your tongue. Smooth all the way down with a nice bite to finish.  D - Love this beer. Definately will pick up a 6 pack or two next time I goto the store.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BigJim5021,4.48,"Stone's IPA ranks neck-and-neck with Bell's Two Hearted as my absolute favorite beer. The only difference between the two is availability. At any given time, I can go to numerous liquor stores (or even my own workplace) and pick up a sixer of Two Hearted. On the flipside, I can get 22 oz. bombers of Stone's IPA at something like two liquor stores on my side of town. Oh well. I guess this stuff makes for an immaculate treat.  Like Two Hearted, Stone IPA pours a hazy copper with a slightly off-white head. The lacing is all over the place.  The aroma is goddamn glorious. Floral hops out the ass. If I could get air freshener that smelled like this, I'd gladly buy a case.  The flavor reflects the smell. The floral hops are massive and bitter and Jesus tapdancing Christ, it's delicious. And like Two Hearted, there's just enough smooth maltiness to balance things out. And man, oh man, is it dry. We're talking Oscar Wilde dry here.  Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and about as good as it gets.  At 6.9%, I would still drink this stuff all night if I could just get someone around here to carry the elusive 6-packs. I can never have enough of this amazing stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Reagan1984,4.77,"What a great beer.  Beer poured with a creamy white 2 finger head. The head did slowly fade back into the beer and left an 1/8th inch skim across the top. Nice ribs of lacing all the way down the glass. Very clear golden amber color. Slight visible carbonation.  Aroma was spot on. Spicy, Floral and citrus notes. (Grapefruit) very fresh scent.  Flavor was approaching perfection. Nice citrus spicy bite out of the shoot. Then a moment of spiciness. White pepper. Then a nice malt sweetness that is followed by the hop bitterness that lingers. Just a joy to drink front to back. A slight spicy tone sticks with the hop lingering effect. You can almost feel the hop oils on your tongue.  Mouth feel is light in body but BIG on flavor. Smooth feel to the beer and the drinkability is amazing.  This is among my favorite IPA's.  Greenflash, Smuttynose and Stone IPA. Don't miss any of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bluemoonswoon,4.09,"Thanks to MtGoat for including this as an extra in out trade. 22oz bomber, poured into an imperial pint glass.  A: Pours a clear and bright golden amber with lighter yellow highlights and topped with an inch of thick and creamy sandy white head. Head could stand to last a bit longer, but there is still some decent lacing here.  S: Sweet and fruity and intensely bitter. Bright fruit aromas shine thought like the sun: pineapple, sweet, slightly roasted malt, heavy pine and sweet grapefruit. Fresh or on cask, this beer must be ambrosia.  T/MF: Intense pine and fruit flavors coupled with a bright alcoholic heat, these are the first things that come to mind on my initial sip. Honey and heather also so up along with a sweet, almost sugary/ fruity grainy finish, I mean the finish almost tastes a little like Fruit Loops, I'm serious. There is actually some pretty nice balance being displayed here, I mean for a Stone beer, the hops are still the forefront of the beer, but the malty aspect is pretty strong as well.  D: A solid and highly drinkable IPA but I just want something more, maybe it's just heightened expectations for the beer, but I swear there are better IPAs out there than this one. I mean it is still a great beer, but there are better ones out there and closer to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma: Citrus hops, grapefruit...pine scents.  Taste: The hops give a good amount of bitterness balanced with a sweetness from the grapefruit side.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, coats the mouth, creamy and so on..and has good carbonation. Goes down very nicely  Drinkability: High ABV but still tasty and medium bodied so its easy to have more than 1.

D - Very drinkable, goes down well alone or with food",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sethmeister,4.25,"Cloudy and sedimented gold with a one finger frothy white head; some lace observed.  Scent is grapefruit and citrus hops.  Taste is grapefruit hops and hints of orange, lemon and other citrus. Light pine oil notes emerge as I continue to sip. Characteristic Stone west coast bitterness. There's a slightly sweet and bready malt underneath which engages as the beer warms. I think I may even taste a hint of pineapple somewhere in there.  Mouth is coating and creamy with a relatively low carbonation.  Drinkability is quite good.  Though a toss up, I think I might just prefer Smuttynose or Founder's Centennial; of course my Smutty's are fresher since they don't travel across the country. Regardless, a lovely IPA and one I'll certainly enjoy again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Cyberkedi,4.45,"Pours a nice hazy golden amber with a thick, buttery, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is hoppy to the point of being piny. Flavor is rich and seriously hoppy, pleasantly bitter and evergreenish with just a touch of caramel sweetness. Finish is edgy and lively. A hop lover's delight.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nc41,3.63,"This one is an edit just to be honest.  This one seems all over the place , perhaps it's me and exposure to more IPA's out there. At one time it was my standard IPA. Decent stuff I suppose, but I don't like the nose and the taste is onlt slightly above average. Honestly I prefer a simple Hop Devil to Stone, and Racer 5, and Modus, 2 Hearted blow it away. I'd take a bottle, but won't buy another 6, Ruination although a Double is far superior. Maybe it's just inconsistent or badly handled, could also be a Total Wine problem they buy in such volume no telling how long it sits is a hot warehouse or trailer. Maybe a Bestway trip is needed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,korndog,4.47,"I forgot how good this beer is. I just popped a bottle and poured a nice amber fog into a Stone IPA glass (go figure). I was mesmerized by the pale and crystal malt aroma which somewhat masked the hops at first. Honey notes. First sip revealed a perfectly balanced beer with a simple recipe behind it. The malt and hops were balanced beautifully with the yeast. I felt the beer was dry, but not overly so, which certainly highlighted the hops. It has a slight bready quality that reminds me of Anchor or Bear Republic pales. Perhaps they use the Liberty yeast. Not sure. Good beer; really good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Aichelberger,4.31,"I used a mug. And if you've ever googled the word ""beer"" (as we all have) and saw a photograph of the perfect mug with a deep amber/orange (slightly hazy) body and a huge frothy head that stayed almost forever... That's what this looked like. It was love at first sight. Hops immediately present in the nose with a rich body (chomping through all the remaining foam) and slick, full mouthfeel. For an IPA, this was not overly hopped. In fact, I commented on the remarkable hops presence that is perfectly balanced with a rich buttery malt underneath. These guys deserve their reputation. This beer is marvelous.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Casey10,4.27,Great IPA pourd to a unmarked chalice. Very smooth and tasty.  Very drinkable and any fan of IPA's will love this beer.

A excellent session beer by any means  Greatful that the Stone series is available in Maine.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Zadok,4.3,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber.  Poured the color of a mild copper with two to two and a half fingers of frothy head and lacing.  Very rich hop aroma, mainly a pine fragrance.  Interesting flavor and balance, the whole experience seems back loaded with only a tingle on the tongue until it hits the back of the throat and then once there it exudes and exceptional hop flavor with just a mild aftertaste.  Smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Definitely a quality IPA, not overpowering in the hop category but enough to let you know they are there. Several other subtle nuances that I cant quite put a finger on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ralree,4.67,"A: Pretty clear, with a white head that recedes quickly. Light gold color.  S: Really grapefruity with a strong hop backing. Pretty piney.  T: Well-balanced. The hops bring the bitterness beautifully, and the fruit gives it just enough sweetness to bear. Not as sweet as some other IPAs, but very good. A little more fruit would have actually been good. Bitterness coats the tongue well.  M: Perfect carbonation, very clean and dry, medium-light bodied, just a touch watery. A little astringent.  D: Drinks well. I could definitely go for this with or without food, but it would accompany a good meat and bread feast nicely, such as a good burger.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ThreeWiseMen,4.28,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear orange-gold with three-finger, soapy white head. Great bubble-bath lacing and good retention to boot.  Smell: Strong citrus and pine, toasted caramel malts, and crisp hop bitterness.  Taste: Caramel and warm bread, citrus (lemon, orange peel), pine, nuts, and oily hops. Very well balanced. Finishes fairly clean with a good dosage of hops.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a surprising amount of chewiness. Nice warming sensation. Creamy feel with average amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: A go-to IPA for any occasion. Represents the west coast well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,asabreed,4.3,"Bomber into a pint glass. I was surprised I hadn't reviewed this before, but alas, here it is.  Appearance: Lighter golden yellow with hints of copper and a rich foamy white head with nice retention.  Smell: Earthy hops, grains, and caramel malts. Nicely balanced, with some cherries in their and fruit creeping in as it warms, and the hops striking a nice point between flowery and bitter citrus.  Taste: A rich balance of earthiness, grains, and sweeter caramel malts and mild chocolate, along with the pungent hops, somewhere along flowery perfume, citrus rinds, and candied fruit. Long finish which features a balance of both very nicely.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, though on the lighter side, with good carbonation.  Drinkability: One of the staples, and one of the best-balanced IPAs out there, with lots to admire on both sides, and enough bite to keep the hopheads happy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lhaqq,4.13,"A: Pours a light golden/deep orangish yellow with an off-white head that dissipates gradually. S: Smells of floral hops and faintly of caramel/sweet malts. T: Tastes predominately of floral hops. Was expecting this part to be a bit more tangy than what I was met with, not that this was a disappointment. Has some sweetness to it that I was also not expecting, but not sure how to describe the flavor. The finish uniquely maintains both this sweetness and the hoppy bitterness simultaneously but independently. M: Not too think or thin--good balance. D: Good example of the style, will get again. Only had a half-pint with dinner at a cafe near my place, so I definitely want to revisit my review after another try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,icemonkey908,4.87,"pours a wonderful copper with a fairly substantial head. aroma is very pronounced, mostly citrus and floral hops.

147,88,cvstrickland,4.33,"12-ounce bottle poured into a large tulip glass yields a hazy golden-orange body capped with a thick lid of fine-bubbled, bright white foam. The head recedes slowly into a chunky sheet that leaves plenty of fine lacing spattered all over the glass.  The smell is sweetly hoppy, with leafy grassy notes and grapefruity citrus. The barest hint of sweet malt lurks underneath all the alpha-acid fireworks.  The taste is punctuated by a bright, citrusy bitterness that plays well with a dry biscuity malt backbone. A hint of sweet orange is layered in, deep beneath the mostly herbal bitterness that continually threatens to dominate the drink, but the brew is rescued from the imperious bitterness by a mild silky caramel maltiness that works hard to peek through the hoppiness. Fruitier and more citrusy as the drink warms, with a citrusy hop-oil linger in the aftertaste.  Medium-bodied with fine carbonation, Stone's IPA is all that I've heard it was, and everything it should be. Superb drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The taste has a bit of that grapefruit in it, along with lots of earthy hop flavors; a bit like dirt and leaves if dirt and leaves tasted good. The smooth bitterness shows up quickly and sticks around for a while. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a medium amount of carbonation.  Overall, this is a really good beer, though I wasn't quite as impressed as I expected.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Good lacing on the glass too as the beer was quaffed.  The taste was good; the hops had a nice inital bite, and then mellowed off. Good hoppy scent as well. Very flavorful. The hops were strong, but not overpowering.  Pretty good drinkability; I think 2 bombers would be my limit for it over the course of an evening.  Definitely an easy beer to recommend, and I'd buy/drink it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Not overwhelming, but nicely done.  T: Not as hoppy as I expected - I guess they save that for the Ruination IPA. Still, very tasty. Also had citrus elements and a tinge of malt.  M: A vibrant, high amount of carbonation and a smooth finish. Pretty full-bodied.  D: Like most of the Stone beers I've tried, this is very drinkable.

S - A pretty hoppy aroma, a mix of citrus and pine. There are also light caramel notes.  M - A light-medium bodied beer with a pretty creamy feel to it. It has a dry finish to it.  T - A little bit of citrusy hops followed by a barrage of piny hops creating a grapefruit taste and leaving a nice bitterness. There is also a subtle malt presence throughout.  A hop heads IPA for sure. It goes down very easy which makes it a great session brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerBelcher,3.98,"I would agree with others who've called this beer balanced. This is a really easy-drinking IPA that I could probably drink all night. I love variety and beers that are extreme, but I'd buy a six-pack of this to drink at a party or wherever...there's been a lot of talk about ""session"" beers on this site, and I'd nominate this one.  Pours an amber body with good head. Aroma is distinctly hoppy, but not over the top. There is some light sweetness and citrus notes. Flavor is hoppy with a significant malt backbone. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Very drinkable, but not too unusual or exciting. Still good though.  I'd buy this again and recommend it.

Beautiful light amber brew with a healthy 3 finger head that slowly dissipates.  S. Wow, this is where the beer starts to make itself known. Very aromatic floral hops, citrus hops and even a HINT of malt in the end.  T. Much as it smells, this has a strong, agressive hop presence. While the malt is there if you search for it, this is a hop bomb. The hop burps have been enjoyable as well.  M. Very clean finish. Moderate oily finish with strong carbonation.  D. Very drinkable. This would be a great beer with a very spicy meal. This will be a staple in my fridge!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sharp, crisp hops dominate the palette, yet give way to a subtle sweetness beneath. A definite hop-head beer.  M: Medium-to unexpectedly-light bodied. I like my IPAs a little thicker, but thats my opinion. Aftertaste/feel slightly reminds me of post-mouthwash gum tingle.  D: Goes down rather smoothly, though full of hop bitterness (which is boasted about on the bottle). Given it's 6.9% ABV, i could probably have 3 or so, then the flavor would probably become a little intense. An excellent sipping beer ideal for warmer months.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Even some nice sweet malts smell at the end of the nose.  Taste is a little tamer than most IPAs. Sweet malt base, breads, and a little yeast up front. Hops show up early in a little sweet fruit and then a bitter finish that fades quickly. Surprisingly the malts almost win here, but lose out at the very end.  Mouthfeel is great for the style. Seems light and bubbly with justa little hop slickness.  Drinkabilty is very high for an IPA.

Not as highly hopped as it's IIPA brethren but still reeked of centennials. The tasted was exceptional and the drink ability of this beer was incredible. I had one but I felt like I could have had 10. The bitterness imparted by the magnum hops was so smooth I couldn't believe this had as many IBUs as advertised.  The six packs in my area are a little pricey but it's worth the price. Get this one for a nice treat, you won't regret it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Strix,4.03,"Slightly cloudy pale orange with decent head and good lacing.  Smells of fresh, floral hops.  Heavy citrus hop flavor, mainly grapefruit, and even some lemon? Nice balance though - the hop bite is present without being overwhelming.  Mouthfeel oily, carbonation medium to light.  This is a very nice IPA. I just had the Ruination the other night, which may have ruined me for anything less luscious, as I prefer that to this. Can't go wrong here though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PatrickJR,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - A very pale amber, clear, with 2 fingers of head that settles a lot quicker than I'd expect. Lacing is on the high side of moderate.  S - Very nice aroma. The grassy and herbal elements from the hops jump out first. A citrus and earthy smell blend together giving the brew an impressive backbone. Some malt peeking through, maybe?  T - The great balance is evident immediately. A strong herbal, tea-like taste is backed by a solid grapefruit peel note. A slight malt sweetness rises for just a second providing a sublime balance. Afterwards however, the bitterness grows with a very orangy, tangerine taste. Finish is grainy sweet with earthy bitterness.  M - Moderate carbonation, medium to light bodied.  D - A little strong for a session brew, but a well balanced IPA without too much bitterness. Good stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ewright,4.42,"A: A nice clear golden brew with a thin layer of off-white head that leaves a bit of lacing on the sides of my nonic.  S: HOPS! Citrus hops, grassy hops, piney hops... it's all there. Massive hop aroma promises great things to come.  T: Nice bracing bitterness, but not overwhelming like the aroma. A little grapefruit rind comes through, but there's decent amount of evergreen notes as well.  M: Nice medium body as befits an IPA, moderate carbonation. Helps keep the hop fatigue at bay.  D: This is a nice, bracing west coast IPA. NC has been waiting on Stone for more than 3 years and Stone does NOT dissapoint!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AChamberlain,4.42,"This is my first review in almost a month and my 150th. To mark the occasion I have chosen Stone IPA, a very popular and well reviewed beer. This is not my first Stone and most certainly not my last. Poured into pint glass with a purty lite amber color and fluffy, frothy off white head. Nice small bubbles throughout. Great hop aroma, with a touch of honey. Strong biting hop flavor, bitter. Great mouthfeel, chews on the tongue ever so slightly. The bitterness and hop harshness is maybe just a little too strong to make this a super drinkable beer. Great overall though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brdc,4.45,"Small capped bottle poured into a tulip.  Amber-orange in appearance, it has a one and a half finger whitish head, with decent retention and lacing. Nose is hoppy as expected, citrusy and fresh, very pleasant, with some bready and caramel maltiness to balance. Light to medium bodied, but pleasant on the tongue, it is amazingly devoid of any signs of alcohol - I was surprised to see it is 6.9%. Predominantly hoppy, certainly hoppier thatn its APA, it still has a good dose of balancing maltiness. Not the hop bomb I expected; it does have less hops than alpha king, for the sake of comparison; but it is amazingly drinkable and pleasant.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,theghost3,4.32,"Appearance is copper with a thin white head. Smell is very strong of citrusy hops. The taste is incredibly abundant on the grapefruit hops there's also a slight yeast flavor. Very bitter, but not atypical of an IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp, very carbonated. This is a drinkable beer, but it is so bitter and carbonated, I recommend taking it easy with this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,morimech,3.92,"Pours a light golden color with a small white head that settles quickly. Some lacing is left on the glass during consumption.  The aroma features the hops. Has a strong citrus aroma with just a hint of light malt.  The flavor is likewise hop heavy. Starts with a citrus splash then finishes very bitter with resin qualities. Malt? What malt. It is just a vehicle for the hops. Very one dimension but a good one dimension.  Has a very good feel. The carbonation in this lighter bodied IPA is lively at first but let it sit for awhile and it settles down to leave a nice, somewhat creamy texture.  What is up with the almost 7% ABV? Not sessionable at all and with the overwhelming bitterness I am not sure I would want to anyway. Good for a bitter fix then move on to more balanced brews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SirSketch,4.26,"A - A quarter inch of white, lacy head that quickly turns to a thin film soon. Very inviting, very clean, golden amber in color. I've always found appearance a little hard to judge, but it was easy to give this beer a 5 in that category.  S - Big citrus hop aroma, grapefruit, along with complex and subtle grains.  T - Pleasing bitterness, grape and citrus notes, and and interesting sweetness. Lemon comes out as well. Dry aftertaste and some residual sweetness.  M/D - Unexpected light/ med body and medium carbonation. Very easy to put back. Even though it's over 6% ABV, I could easily drink many of these throughout a night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Sweet, orange aroma with a definite kick of hops. Starts off with sweet tangerine/lemon notes then becomes intensely hoppy with accompanying spice and Ting. Hops spread to the sides and back of the tongue. Cask gives the pallet a smooth rich texture with perfect carbonation. Lingers a long time on the back of the tongue.

147,88,DefenCorps,4.4,"12oz bottle received from largadeer in our most recent trade. This one's available locally but I've never seen bottles less than 6-7 months old so one with a best by date of 6th Nov is a treat. Into my Duvel tulip  A: Clear orange pour with a thin off-white head that recedes surprisingly quickly. It does leave lacing, though  S: Wonderful citrus hops all the way with oranges, tangerines, a touch of honey and pine. A thin malt backbone is present with a biscuity character. Very good.  T: Starts off bitingly bitter with a solid orange zest bitterness with a lot of juicy citrus hops. Tons of orange and a hint of floral hop character on the palate. The malt backbone, for all practical purposes, is virtually absent, allowing the resiny hops to form the backbone that carries this beer into a long, dry and bitter finish. Kudos, Stone  M: Light in body, resiny with hop goodness on the palate, carbonation that works with the hops and a drying, bitter finish - I really can't ask for more.  D: Incredibly drinkable, I just might have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Duffman,4.25,"Picked this one up at the Nova in Hudson Wisconsin, can't get it in Minnesota unfortunately. Pours a hazy straw color. Smell has a fresh quality to it, very brisk. Mild citrus notes are present. Taste is creamy and most pleasant. The hops are of course notable plus somewhat restrained, and not in a bad way. Strawberry perhaps? Some lemon zest for good measure and a touch of mint. The finish has a nuttiness to it. Mouthfeel is of a high quality. The medium and smooth creamlike body grips the palate with a kind of nonchalance. Smooth and easy drinking. All the factors come together beautifully yet it still seems short of magnificient. Lacking in the top-quality of the absolute best ipas (two-hearted, furious and masala mama notably). In the end though a really phenomenal ipa not far off the top.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,spointon,4.42,"I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.  A= This ale poured a very bright, slightly hazy pale golden color. Even with an insanely aggressive pour, the white head only started at about 1/2"" and quickly dropped to a skim. Decent sticky lace down the glass.  S= Aromas were bursting with pine/citrus hops. Very fragrant and pleasant for a hop lover such as myself. I also detected the cracker thin malt presence in the background.  T= The front end of this beer is all hops. I found the dominant hop flavors to be citrus, pine, and maybe a bit herbal. Dryness started in the middle and didn't let up until the alcohol warmth of the finish kicked in. I am sure there were some malt flavors at work here (the beer wasn't totally unbalanced after all) but they sure hid behind those puckering hops.  MF= Medium bodied, with a relatively light feel on the tonhue. Low-medium carbonation levels throughout.  D= I loved this beer, but only someone who loves hops and off-the-charts bitterness would. A great year round session beer despite the abv (though I wouldn't plan on evaluating any other beers after this has fried your palate).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dancinwillie,3.72,"Medium amber colored, with a big white pillowy head that seems to be sticking around.  Aroma is piney, and citrus hops.  A lot of big hop presence here. Piney resin, minty, herbal, seem to dominate. Some citrus, grassy flavor as well. This one also has a strong malt presentation as well. Very bready and a nice balancing act for all that delicious hop flavor.  Slick and oily, but the mouthfeel is a bit thin. Wish I could really chew on it.  Overall, a very good IPA. I could see kicking back with a few of these any day of the week.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GJ40,4.5,"Sampled from a 22oz bottle purchased at Bev Mo in Redwood City on a business trip to SF.  A - Golden with good clarity and a moderate off white head. Nice lacing.  S - Initially a mix of floral hops, yeast and malt but then it becomes all hops. Very nice.  T - A very compelling citrusy flavor with a real grapefruit bite. A bit tart and tangy. It has a good supporting malt foundation that stands its ground but knows better than to interfere with the hops. This is just my style.  M - Good body and a perfect low to moderate carbonation.  D - A fantastic beer. My first Stone experiences were with their Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard years ago. The alcohol was way too obvious in those beers and I didn't like them at all (that was then, I love them now).

147,88,bjoyce12,4.3,"One more review after more than 1300 prob won't make a difference, but this one is worth it. A prestigious brewery like Stone wouldn't let their signature IPA fall flat. Beautiful appearance, stong nose of hops, great hoppy taste followed by an exceptional hoppy kick. Not the absolute best IPA I've ever had(Flying Dog IPA, Smuttynose Big A are slightly superior), but this could be considered the IPA standard bearer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Like all Stone beers, this IPA is highly recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MP72,3.85,A- Nice burnt orange kind of color with a nice white head.  S- Smells very strong of hops and citrus  T-taste was real citrusy and pinelike very tasty brew indeed.  M- was surprisingly thin compared to Victory Hop Devil which I drink often. Very good mouthfeel though.  Drinkability was a little low for me there is an aftertaste that I dont care for and would stick to the hopDevil for regular consumption.  Still a great IPA and solid all the way.

147,88,association330,4.33,"A - Pours a deep golden amber with reddish-orange hues when held up to light. Features a two-finger head that becomes a thin, creamy cap over the course of about five minutes, with nice patches of lacing.  S - Floral hops, grapefruit rind, spices, malted grains  T - Hop spiciness up front with malted grains that add a touch of sweetness. It's followed by grapefruit and pine sap, which concludes with a yeasty, bitter finish.  M - Creamy and moderate, with a good carbonation level.  D - One of the most balanced IPAs I've had.

S- Really fresh tropical fruits mixed with the typical grapefruits, oranges, and lemons from the hops. The caramel like backing is staying out of the limelight for sure letting the hops run the show.  T- Citrusy again, explained close to the description of the nose, refreshing and light, but piney and oily at the same time; makes a nice compliment for each other and balances the equation. The bitterness is just right blending with the sweetness of the honey malts adding to the effect.  M- Light but oily in the mouth with medium carbonation. Just right for the style.

Citrus, bitter notes, grassy.  The flavor is also dominated by hops. Especially the citrus flavors. Bitterness and grassy notes are also noticeable. I can barely detect any malt at all, which is ok with me. I like IPAs and DIPAs to be super hoppy.  A dry mouthfeel from all the hops, but appropriate as far as I'm concerned.  Good drinkability, a great IPA here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,N8TheGreat,4.52,Served in a Pint Glass at 48 degrees. Poured a nice golden hue with a tinge of orange in direct light. Head was thick and white and left pleasant lacing. Rough but pleasant hop notes dominate a very inviting aroma. Taste is the expected and potent smack of bitter hops with nice hint of smooth malt in the finish. This is a classic example of an American IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,youngleo,4.1,"Poured into a pint glass. Ale was cloudy and gold with a little brown overtones. Head was about half inch thick, but had some real nice lacing. Left rings around the glass with every swallow. Every swallow left more bubbles around the edges. Smelled of floral hops, malt and citrus. Tasted a little dry, slightly bitter, and had that pine taste. It just tasted good. Felt good in the mouth. carbonation was good. I would drink these all the time and will buy again. I couldnt make this a session beer because of the higher alcohol content. It tastes so good you just want to gulp it down. But if you want to treat yourself, its worth it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,therealmccoy3,4.4,Very good drinkability. Reminds me of Sierra Nevada; good and hoppy. Has a high alcohol content.

147,88,itcomesnpints,4.62,"Golden amber with a pure white head that clings to the pint glass. The aroma brings the first notion that this ale is world-class. The hops jump out at you and pull you in for the taste, which is even better. The excessive dry-hopping produces a powerful IPA-worthy bitterness that somehow manages to be completely smoothed out by the mild malt character. Medium to light body with a serene crispness. This easily makes my top 3 IPA list. There should be a picture of this brew in the dictionary under India Pale Ale. Mission accomplished, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The mouthfeel was much softer than I was expecting for an IPA, but I like it. The softness adds a smoothness to the drinkability of this IPA.  Based on the nose the initial taste was not quite as ""juicy"" was i was expecting. I was anticipating hoppy for sure, and it's there, but it strikes a near perfect balance with the malt. Piney and nice a nice blend with the malt presence in the background behind the dominating hop bitterness. Grapefruit flavors emerge in the middle.

Mostly pine hops with slight citrus and a moderately sweet malt backbone  M,D: The active carbonation is great and the alcohol is hidden perfectly",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bounty628,4.42,"Stone IPA is brewed in the American style for an India Pale Ale and is remarkably solid IPA offering that you should try if you can find it. Fortunately for me, a smaller package store out here in eastern Massachusetts has Stone Brewing bombers on their shelves, a nice addition from the west coast to an east coast palate. The bomber version of the Stone IPA (22 ounces) is really the ideal way to drink this beer, so pick yourself up a couple for a nice weekend of quality beer.  The Stone IPA comes in with an ABV of 6.9%, so it certainly packs a nice little punch in terms of alcohol in the beer. Though it comes at 6.9%, there is a sensational drinkability to this beer and the alcohol remains off in the background and is not trying to ruin the taste by being too in your face.  Though this beer certainly could be simply a session beer and not one to serve with food, for the bombers that were picked up I decided to serve them with grilled salmon and it worked out perfectly. Seafood always seems to complement IPAs remarkably well and the spiciness of Stone IPA lent a welcome hand to the grilled taste of the salmon.  When poured, Stone IPA pours a rich amber to gold color that nicely fills the glass. Upon pour, there is more than a moderate amount of carbonation that really does not give way much but instead leads to a thick white head that holds true almost all the way through the offering. Since the large head holds steady for quite some time, needless to say there is a thick white lacing present along the glass, as well.  Stone IPA is a medium body IPA to pour and the quasi-cloudy nature of the beer remains throughout the drinking.  The rich aroma of this IPA is toward the top of the recent memory of IPA smells. An almost immediate smell of grapefruit and caramel malts are noticed once the beer is poured. From the nose alone there is every indication that this is going to be a good hop filled offering. Other citrus smells like lemons and oranges can also be found in the nose.  If you are not into hoppy beers or have no idea what a hop head is then this beer is one that you should stay away from. The taste of the Stone IPA is rich with an impressive hop flavor that is beautifully crafted as being the right balance of spice and flavor. While there is some pine noted, other than the hop taste of the beer, there are also subtle citrus tastes that also work their way into the offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Chaz,4.17,"A medium pour produces a pale tan head and a decent collar of lace. The brew itself is golden-amber in color, although I wanted to be lazy and just call it ""orange."" It's also a bit murky, with a fair amount of suspended yeast - looks good so far. Cascade hop character is fairly assertive on the nose, although there are other varieties here no doubt. I'm also getting plenty of fruit esters here, including honeydew melon and a touch of peach! It's smooth on the first sip, and the almost gentle carbonation on the mouthfeel veritably propels the malt character alongside the hops. There is the slyest wink of alcohol and an almost smokey character ascending into the aromatics -very subtle- and I am liking it. Notes of Golden Delicious apple co-mingle on the palate alongside the almost spikey, insistent hop notes, and overall this is a lot smoother and mellower than I'd anticipated (by their reputation I figured everything Stone brewed was an unrelenting hop bomb!) The finish is dry yet forgiving, as the hops do not overshadow some of the more subtle biscuit malt notes, which really take on more prominence as the drink progresses.  I am not a huge fan of American IPAs but I am definitely liking this one, and would certainly like to try it on tap. For the incredible reputation this company has achieved this is a rather laid-back and approachable rendition of the style, and that bumps my score up quite a bit.  Served chilled in a bulb.

147,88,gabeerfan,4.22,"Pours a mostly clear amber-gold. Bubbly white head that never fully disappears. It's a Stone beer, so the first aromas are of the hops. Grapefruit rind, pine and grass backed up by caramely malts. This is hop-forward, but reasonbly balanced aroma. Again, hops first. Grapefruit and pine dominate with some grassiness floating around. Caramel and brown sugar maltiness helps round it out. Medium bodied. Malts make the beer a little sticky and the hop flavor lingers a while. OK drinkability. Very good flavors but I don't know if I could drink this all night at 7% unless I was at home or somwhere that didn't require driving. A good representative of a West Coast IPA.

147,88,PatronWizard,4.26,"OK, time to try this badboy. Bomber to glass...  Oooohhh....pretty. Golden orange, thick white frothy head. Second best head I ever had (wink, wink). This head wanted to hang out and have a beer with me.  So that's what hops smell like! I'll be sniffing this puppy a lot.  So that's what hops taste like! Sweet bitterness...gotta have more (like hot-wings). Still tastes minutes after a drink.  I got lost in this beer, sipping, gazing out the window, forgetting all about my responsibilities, the damaged roof, the overgrown oleanders, the crying baby, the leaky faucet, and the head is still here whispering sweet somethings...  Man, bombers rule! I'm gonna finish the first glass before the head disappears. Finally I just drank the rest and left the lacy head for the second glassful. Decent level of ABV - this beer walks right up to you and kicks you in the balls - absolutely awesome.  Overall: quite possibly my favorite beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,flipshevanel,3.54,I enjoyed this far more than the Ruination IPA. The appearance was a bit cloudy with a nice light orage/amber color. The aroma had lots of citrus hops with the initial palate being very full. I did not care for the texture being very creamy and oily but the flavor was moderate in all areas with the bitterness not being to overpowering. I also liked how the alcoholic taste did not linger as much as the Ruination.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,soupyman10,4.33,"Had this one on tap for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and managed to find it again today. I remember the first time I bought a sixer of these (fairly close to when I first started drinking crafts) they totally knocked me on my ass. Now, the beer is great, although certainly not quite as stunning. It's got a solid look, just like an IPA should. Fairly weak lacing on a solid head. Flavor and nose are strong on piney hops, with caramel malt and some toffee and citrus in there too to round things out. This is a highly hoppy beer, no question, bitter and drying, but delicious. Doesn't quite reach the top echelon for me (Two Hearted, Hop Red Rye, etc.), but still a very drinkable and tasty brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tbn2,3.97,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  A-Pours a golden yellow with a slight haze to it. A crisp white head rises to the top, dissipates, and leaves moderate lacing.  S-A big blast of citrusy and piney hops. In the background I get a good balance of sweet and pale malts.  T/M-Just like it smells. The hops are in the spotlight. Their flavor starts off more like a fresh pine and then develops more to a citrus flavor. The malts sit in the background and provide a good balance to the beer. The best part is the carbonation. In combination with the hops, it gives the beer a crisp taste.  Overall this is another quality beer from Stone. Enjoy  Cheers...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bbothen,3.8,"Poured into a standard pint glass from 22 oz bottle.  Light orange/straw color with a 1 finger soapy/bubbly head. Plenty of sticky lacing.  Big aroma of piney & citrus flowery hops. Tangerine, lime, grapefruit, spruce. Yum.  Tastes like the aroma. Nice hop bitterness. Big pine flavors. Enough malt presence to even things out. Hops dominate though.  Medium bodied. Sticky. Oily. Lingering hop flavor.  Drinkabilty is good. Nice west coast style IPA. Others I enjoy more. But I'd gladly buy & have this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Pauly2X,4,"A- Hazy gold, one finger head.  S- Very sharp citrusy hop aroma.  T- Crisp clean hop bitterness throughout, just enough malty sweetness to bring balance to it all.  M- Quite light, but not watery.  D- Sessionable, at least compared to the ruination.  While this is a really good IPA, there's just something missing for me, or maybe the hype skewed my expectations. Regardless, I'm very happy that Stone made its way to Wisconsin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kinger,4.32,"Got a 22 ounce bottle from my favorite store and let it chill for a week. Opened it and poured my first glass. Beautiful dark golden/light amber color with good carbonation and a very nice looking head. Took a big ol' wiff and HOPS!, HOPS!, HOPS!....the hop aromas were jumping out of the glass, so I took a taste and MORE HOPS. Good character for this beer, Stone has a knack of brewing their beers to the maximum potential of the relative styles they make and this IPA delivers. Fresh tasting ale with complex hop flavors that seem to kick you at first but soon come together into one damn good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TeddyBG,4.25,"22 oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A: Light copper color with 1/2"" off-white head that dissipates. Good lacing.  S: Citrus and pine. Cannot pick up the malt.  T: Citrus up front with a hint of malt. Good bitter finish, that is not overwhelming.  M: Thick but not heavy. Very good carbonation.  D: I could have a few of these no problem. The 6.9% ABV is a little high, but I'll step-up to the challenge.  note: Not the best american IPA that I have sampled, but a very good one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Sticket,4.5,"P- a declared 6.9% abv in a 22oz brown bomber bottle.  A- pours a crystal clear, golden beige color with a modest fluffy amount of white head and good lacing.  S- fruity esters with strong herbal hops.  T- slight background of sweet malts covered with strong herbal hops.  M- smooth, just the right balance of carbonation to move the flavors and oils across the palate creating a wonderful experience.  D- a great beer for hops lovers, a great beer for beer lovers, this one can be enjoyed by all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,UA8,4.03,A- Golden straw in color with a ivory white head.  S- Light biscuity malts and yeast with piney hops and a slight citrus scent  T- The palate reads of citrus and pine hops which dominate the experience. malts are secondary yet somewhat there.  M- Medium in body and carbonation.  D- A nice consistent Ipa lacks somewhat in the malt category but doesnt hurt the experince all that much.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IPAs4lyfe,4.4,"A: Beautiful orange gold with a nice creamy white head, crystal clear appearance, lots of lacing.  S: Hops. Sweet citrus, grapefruity orange rind. Can't wait to taste it.  T: Honey-like malts at first, with a strong hop balance that leaves a delectable juicy, tart and bitter, somewhat dry aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Awesome.  M: Silky smooth, perfect carbonation, no complaints here.  D: If it wasn't for the 7% alchohol content i would be drinking these all night. Superb, really. I was impressed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GodOfBeer,4.39,"Pours a nice orange colour with a little creamy head with nice lacing.  Smells delicious, awesome floral hoppy smell, sweet pine and some citrusy fruits.  Very bitter upfront with some citrus and some malt sweetness but mainly hoppy, one of the hoppiest beers i've had, just awesome!  A slightly creamy mouthfeel, a very bitter beer that is suprisingly refreshing and drinkable!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PhxHorn,3.9,"On tap at Stone Brewery in Escondido. Color is a medium yellow with a small amount of white foam. Smells of citrus. Tastes of citrus and heavy bitterness, but the taste just isn't all that intense. I've had the stuff on tap before, and it was much better in the past. This time, it didn't do all that much for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,techdiver,4.45,"Pours a hazy golden straw with substantial white head that dissipates slowly.  Nose of piney grapefruit hops, very inviting.  Very smooth and creamy taste. Nice balance for an IPA.  Very drinkable. It's been a while since I had this. Good stuff, don't plan on waiting so long to have it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brianmerrilyn,4.2,"Yet another west coast brewery I've seen in the beer stores for some time but passed up for one reason or another. IPA's hurt my stomach to some extent but knew I had to try this one at least once to put on my beer dossier, so I tried out a bomber from the San Diego boys.  A: Poured into Cheers mug to produce an amber/golden color, 3/4 finger frothy white head. Crescent and spotted lacing to put a smile on my face and strong retention.  S: Powerful and pungent citrus of the grapefruit. At first I thought it was the abv stinging my nose hairs until the overall citrus boquet expanded. Pine, and citrus peels of perhaps orange and lemon to add the mix. I really enjoyed the esters from the sweet malts that come in a distant second but keep your neck bending to smell the beer one more time.  T: A measured hop strenght that I am not familiar with but quite happy to drink. The sweet malts along with a cracker foundation at the back end do a masterful job of ensuring the hops don't make the beer to acidic. In addition, a grass/wheat and herb presence comes about just when you thought you had all of the tastes recorded.  M: Medium to thick bordering on chewy with dry and mighty bitter finish.  D: I will pull for this one without reservation. Stone has changed my opinions on IPA's or at least the American style. While the hops were quite strong as advertised on the bottle, the remainder of the receipe was a perfect blend to ensure full enjoyment to the very last drop.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TonyT,4.57,"My Benchmark Calli IPA...This was the beer that made me fall in love with hops...Thank you Stone...If I ever make it out to Calli, I will be there...The Crisp finish with the high dryness makes you remember how it tastes the next day...after the gig....",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Beefeater57,4.25,"A: Solid gold color, white sudsy head with a lot of lacing.  S: Hops are very noticeable in the smell. A little earthy, but it has a sweet smell that is subtle but really nice.  T: A very complex hop character. The bitterness of the hops comes in layers and builds in the taste. Some malt sweetness comes in the beginning real quick then is taken over by the hops. The hops give a definite earthy character and the aftertaste leaves a strong bitterness with hints of mint.  M: Really good body, no complaints with the mouthfeel at all.  D: An excellent complex IPA. The hops are definitely there..I could smell the hops from my glass on the table. The high alcohol content (6.9%) keeps me from pounding a 6pk but it is really drinkable. Great example of the style...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ckaufman,4.45,"I've been enjoying this fine brew for a few years now, and since it happens to be one of my personal top ten beers, I felt it warranted a review.  This beer pours out with a slightly hazed golden copper colour and a nice foamy 1-2 finger head. Very nice!  The hop aroma is very distinct from the moment the cap is rendered from the bottle. Very floral as most ""left"" coast IPAs tend to be.  The taste of this ale is incredible. Hopped & bitter, but with a nice mellow malt backbone for balance.  Mouthfeel, for me at least, tends to be the weakest side of this beer. The density of the hops seem to dry the palate after a few pints.  Easy to drink... goes down smoothly and sometimes you forget the 6.9% ABV contained in this fine Cali IPA.  One of my favorites. Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,robbyc1,4.05,"Nice clear orange/yellow with a nice fluffy white head, leaves some lace on the glass, stays on for 3 -4 minutes.  Nose has grapefruit for sure, smells very fresh and refreshing, some nose of limes as well, no malt smell but good.  Nice grapefruit flavor, signs of limes, refreshing and balanced, not sweet, but little malt to balance the hops. In addition, the mouthfeel is not as heavy as I would like, (see Two Hearted). Nothing wrong, just not great.  Low bitterness so an easy drinker, again very refreshing, would take this over most summer styles, if I was on the west coast I could keep a six pack of this, but Bells and Goose have ones as good so no problem.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DrunkenMaster,3.38,"Growler from Consumer Beverages. Bright orange color with a nice head. I like the color of this. Aroma is fruity and floral with some sweet malts. Starts out with lots of malt sweetness but gets more bitter and dry towards the finish. Not bad, but a pretty average IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sorryaboutbrooks,4.53,"Poured beer into glass. Definitely a little cloudy for an IPA (maybe a chill haze goin on?). Pours a yellowish or light copper. Not much of a head, but keep in mind I use glasses washed in the dishwasher with detergent. Amazing citrus smell. First sip catches you off guard as it is not what you would expect, but it is a great unique citrus flavor. The citrus (orange like flavor) is not over powering, but balanced very well with the rest of the beer. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LunaChick,3.3,"For what it is, its a good IPA. But its by far not nearly what I expected. Medium golden color with about a 1 finger head that left lacing to the bottem of the pint. Smells strongly of pine, citrus and alcohol. What got me about this was there was no depth to the flavor. It was a big hoppy start and then very little in between or in the end even. The overall flavor was decent--nice strong hop flavor, bitter orange peel. A very easy drinking IPA--would be easy to have 2 or 3 even. Nice carbonation, soft mouth feel and generally a clean finish. I guess I like my IPA's to leave a strong flavor on the back of my mouth and this doesn't. Overall its a good beer but not one I'd regularly reach for.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cbros,4.2,"Got this in a trade with kylightzone, thanks brother.  Serving type- Bottle with no born on date poured into a regular pint glass. No activity present in beer after pour.  A- Poured a brilliant golden yellow. With a nice white lace that stayed around to the finish.  S- First thing that hits you is the STRONG hoppy alcohol smell. Also hints of herbs and spices but my rather untrained nose cannot decipher them specifically.  T- Once again the hoppiness hits you upside the head. You taste the hops throughout, which is a good thing because it helps balance out the strong alcohol flavor. Overall a great tasting and strong hoppy beer.  This is a great IPA and I am only sorry that I cannot get this around my area. I am just now getting aclemated into the stronger and hoppier beers and I can see why this is a good representative of the genre. I truly hope that Stone comes to NC soon like the rumours that are going around are stating. Otherwise I am gonna have to keep trading to get my hands on this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kbnooshay,4.3,Poured a slightly hazy orange color with a thick and frothy off white head. A good amount of carbonation stuck to the side of the glass. The frothyness of the head leads to some awesome clumpy lacing. Floral and pine treeish aroma. The flavor is similar but with an awesome breadiness to it. This is very well balanced. There is some malt in there. There is a pleasant dryness to the brew. The feel is kinda slick and moderate. For an IPA this is one of the the most balanced and drinkable ones ive had.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,roadhouse,4.38,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber bottle into a pint glass.  Very nice slightly cloudy golden-orange color with two finger off-white head that sticks around. Leaves some nice lacing down the glass.  Aroma is pretty straightforward for an IPA. Citrusy and piney hops. A bit of biscuity malt way in the back somewhere.  Flavors are basically exactly what I expected from the aroma. Citrus and pine again, somewhat grassy. Nice bitter finish with a little bit of biscuit malt.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Nice medium-light body in combination with good carbonation really lets the hops shine.  As for drinkability, let's just say that I could drink this stuff all night. It's hoppy as hell, yet still seems to be balanced nicely. Definitely one of the better IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ectomorph,4.32,22 oz Bomber poured into a Pint glass.  A - Pours a rich dark gold with small white head and decent lacing and retention.  S - Nice citrus hop smell in the nose with a slightly biscuit aroma on the end.  T - Really nice hop kick noticed immediately with the malt balance smoothing out the end. Makes for a great burp!  M - Nice and light with good carbonation tingle.  D - At just under 7% a couple of these bad boys will do.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Buebie,4.21,"Took a trip to Wisconsin for this.  Poured from a 12oz bottle with expensive looking screen printing on the bottle. Into a 12oz pint glass. Color is mildly hazy with a golden amber color and good carbonation rise from the bottom of the glass. Head is fluffy and white with a cream like texture. Retention is great and sticks around nicely with nice lace drapage.  Aroma's are big and hoppy, citrus, pine, grapefruit, floral dry hop aroma. Some malty sweetness but mostly big hop aroma.  Nice smooth flavor, well blended hops to malt. A bit bitter, but delicious. Wallop of bitter piney flavor mixing well with the other hop flavor of grapefruit and malty sweetness. Heavy on the hops, but the malt still comes around. Finish and linger of a spicie hop note.  Mouthfeel is definatly not watered down, good thickness with a tad bit of creamy like texture and a good dose of carbonation.  Great brew, definatly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pvsob,3.8,"A- Crystal clear amber with a half finger head that fades slowly leaving a thin film and some lacing.  S- Hops, some fruits, and just a hint of butter.  T- Follows the smell profile, but with a long dry hoppy finish.  M- Thin with some carbonation.  D- A decent IPA, but there are better examples out there. It's very balanced, but I think that I would grow weary of it after two or three pints. Still though, it's a good beer and worth a go if you haven't had it before. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ALESwhatCURESya,3.95,"A-pale golden body with great clarity. Topped with a fluffy thick head that leaves walls of lace.  S-Nice dose of herbal citrus hops. Not the huge fruitiness that I was expecting. In terms of IPAs, I have come across many more with a bigger, more well-rounded, hop punch. Slight doughy, malt in the background. Very clean overall.  T-Big tangy bitterness all the way through. There is a decent balance between the aggressive hops and a sweet caramel malt backbone. A bit tart in the finish.  M-Great hop bitterness, but the body was a little thinner that I like in a good IPA. Although the hops come on strong, they are not cloying.  D-Overall a good IPA, but there are a lot of good IPAs on the market. Nothing about this is bad, but it doesn't stand out more than the others. I am just a little torn about this one. The hype of this beer may have upped the bar a bit. Easy to drink and a pleasure for hop heads. Good, above average American IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeardedBoffin,4.12,"A brown bomber of this brew. Beer is an orange-amber color, slightly hazy, with a modest lonely centimeter of foam that quickly dissipated. A big citrus and hoppy nose on this one. Some malt does manage to get through. Medium bodied and smooth on the palate. Bitter throughout, building toward the finish. Pine and citrus hop flavors culminate at the end to assault the palate. Slightly balanced by some malt graininess, but mostly bitter.  A good refreshing American IPA. More bitter than most, but not in a bad way. Stone has another winner in this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bradybeer,4.1,"One of the first west coast IPAs I had back in the day. Pours a medium straw yellow with a white head. Pine resin and citrus hop aroma that plays out in the taste which is bitter, grape fruity, with some malt sweetness in the finish. Carbonation is medium, but I find the mouthfeel to be medium-thin. Drinkability is very good-but this is not a session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JMD,4.35,"A: Light copper with tints of orange. Bit frothy head that laces the glass on the way down. Very nice.  S: Big hop aroma. Pine, citrus, earthy hop oil. Carmel malt and bisquits in the background.  T: Big hop flavor to match the aroma. Grapefruit, lemon, some pine. Well balanced as the malt kicks in with some carmel and sweet bread. Delicious.  M: Moderate carbonation. Very smooth, but a bit watery.  D: Outstanding IPA. Could easily drink these all night long. I drove an hour to a liquor store in NY to get a six pack of this and it was well worth. Too bad we can't get this in CT.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A- Pours a clear, bright golden orange. Sizeable white head that turns into clingy, sticky lacing.  S- No surprise here strong aroma of 85 percent piney resin 15 percent citrus. Some hidden sweetness, like caramel.  T- The signature Stone in your face over the top hops is clearly here. The bitterness is once again mostly piney. Hard to pick up the balance of malts.  M- This is a strong component of this beer. Firm body with great carbonation. Very refreshing.  D- I don't consider IPA'S to be my session beer, but this one is very good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste - fruity notes followed by the spice of the hops. Well balanced with good aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Light and crisp. Very viscous (i.e., it goes down very smoothly).  Drinkability - High. I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile based on the ratings here at BA and am glad I finally did. Great tasting and with no chemicals and preservatives I can say I'm drinking healthy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DontCallMeSurly,4.47,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass.  An aggressive pour results in a nice white pillowy head of about an inch or so which sticks around for a few minutes. When I look through the glass I see a crystal clear straw-colored beer. Great hop character on this! Ohh yeah, this is something I can get behind! Flavor is big with plenty of grapefruit hops which provide for an excellent taste. Medium bodied with light carbonation helps this one become a very drinkable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JamesS,4.42,"Pours a great copper color with good head and nice lacing. It has a wonderful floral, hoppy scent that fills the air. It has a great taste, very light malty tones with a wonderful hoppy overtone, nearly too much, but it's great. It goes down very smooth. An absolutely wonderful IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Subtle hoppy aroma with hints of pine and citrus.  T: Opens with floral hops and spice, followed by a malty middle punctuated with notes of pine and citrus rind. Finishes crisp and dry.  A well-balanced IPA offering, but too subtle in character to be considered distinctive of the style. Not in the same echelon as Furious & Masala Mama.  M: Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated.  D: Good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A- Crystal clear golden amber with a head that reduces to a skim while leaving nice lacing  S- Nice balance of citrus/grapefruit, grassy, lemon and caramel malt.  T- This one does it for me. Great hop character, good underlying bitterness with the fresh aroma ultimately affecting the taste in a positive way. The malt back bone holds it all together very well.  M- Sharp CO2 that almost cleanses as it goes down  D- Don't kid yourself this is a big beer. With that being said it goes down easily. I don't see myself drinking this as a session brew but I love to mix in two or three if I am on a mission:)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lowbrau,4.24,"Appearance: Golden amber color. Thin white head with some lacing and plenty of large bubbles.  Smell: Cascade (?) hops up front balanced by a brown sugar or caramel like sweetness.  Taste: Very sharp and clean. Little malt character comes through, but the hops are excellent. Strong bittersweet floral notes.  Mouthfeel: Ideal lever of carbonation. Finishes very clean with only hops in the aftertaste. Dry.  Drinkability: It's delicious, but a bit of a palate buster. I'd like to drink more, but I think I'd lose the ability to taste them.  I think Stone beer only just became available in Wisconsin, and I was really surprised to find it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,demitriustown,4.22,"Seriously This stuff is wicked good! The aroma alone is absolutely gorgeous. A wonderfully sweet fruity hoppiness, roasted nuts, and caramel is indescribable. Appearance is an orangish/ amber color with a small white head. Flavor is big on the hops, pine, and a subtle caramelized malt note. Palate is bitter/sweet and last quite a while. Overall, This is one damn good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,eandolina,4.92,"The Stone IPA is simply an excellent embodiment of this beer style. The IPA is my favorite style and Stone perfectly nails it. You usually need to go to a brewpub to get an IPA of this quality. It has all the elements essential to an IPA. A good beer is much like a good woman; simple, clean, hard-working, and affordable--that is the Stone IPA.  Simply sublime!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Homerbag,4.22,"Pours an almost neon orange/peach body with thick head that stays until the end.  Smell is almsot a benchmark West Coast IPA. Very big punch of resiny pine and cut grass attack the nose leaving little room for much else. I like this, being a hophead, if you are not, stear clear of this. The taste is suprisingly balanced in comparision to the nose. Still very hoppy, but more of a citric quality, great grain and biscuit malt background make this easier to handle. Feel is a bit sticky, but right on for an IPA.  Very good and even though the ABV is a 6.9% I would like to call it sessionable from the ease of drink. Real good IPA here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jayli,4,"I have yet to run across a Stone brewing that I have disliked! The beer poured a light golden color with a bit of a head, about roughly 2 fingers. The head gives way to a lacing that remains throughout the entire beer. This is a decent IPA. Unlike some other IPA's the bite doesn't come until the very end. It's a great easy taste to it followed with the bite of a hops that you would expect from an IPA. This is a great beer, just one more from Stone to look for!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jdubjacket,3.57,"Hmmm... I love the Stone products I've been able to get my hands on. Brought this one back from Batavia, New York when I was up there.  Pours a very pale yellow. The color is a shade above Budweiser. ALOT of carbonation in this one. Poured down the side of the glass slowly, and this one still bubbled over. Smell was slightly underwhelming. Some citrus and hops, but it was relatively subdued. Taste was overly hoppy and was not as balanced as I was hoping for. Mouthfeel was too bubbly for an IPA. Overall, this is an average IPA at best, and definitely not one of Stone's best offerings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,elniko,4.59,"Poured from bottle into pint  A: Good looking deep amber, half finger of head with nice lacing. Good looking brew.  S: Wonderful smell, not overpowering with hops. Very fruity, citrusy smell.  T & M: I am biased going in because this is by far my favorite IPA that I have had. Perfect hops concentration, gives the brew the necessary IPA bitterness but also gives some fruitiness quality that makes this brew a step above the average American IPA. Mouthfeel is top-notch, this is a beer that lingers on the tongue and leaves you wanting more.  D: Highly drinkable for IPA, reasonably high alcohol content is completely non-apparent. I have yet to have a Stone beer that left me at all disappointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BretSikkink,4.35,"Slightly darker than amber, head is light and fluffy with great retention and lots of lacing down the pint glass. This one is clear, no chill haze.  Huge aromatics, strongly of classic west coast citric IPA flavors. This one is dank, great power that's extremely pungent and inviting.  The citrics are really lead by the grapefruit zest, also orange and lemon peel are in there. Piney dark side emerges as well, with a strong herbal component. The malts are out of the way but quite full. At least, full enough for me. Some may say unbalanced..  The finish is solid as well, slightly dry with a strong bitter flavor. Every bit as good as the bottle, and a joy to be had every time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BamaBeerBuff,4.59,"A: Pours a beautiful light amber with some orange and golden highlights. A large, three-fingered frothy off-white head slowly settles to a nice foamy covering. Some nice, thin sheets of lace all the way down the glass.  S: Initially I got some piney hop aromas, but after the head settled I was blasted with grapefruit, lemon, and pineapple flavors. Fruity esters from the sweeter malts blend nicely with the citrus hop aromas. It continues to develop and impress throughout--I'm constantly smelling and inhaling the aromas this gives off.  T&M: Herbal, grassy, floral and light citrus hops across a biscuity/bready malt base. Some non-hop fruity esters blend in, as well. A wonderfully complex, hop-tastic flavor. The finish is lightly drying with the malty sweetness cutting the hop bitterness nicely. Body is on the heavy side of medium with a light, zesty carbonation that really works well.  D: Stone IPA is a masterfully crafted beer. All facets of the experience are top-notch. The higher ABV limits drinkability a bit, but not much. I'd definitely try to session this one (don't know how much success I'd have, though!).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tdizzle,4.5,"Bottled on 5/30/2008 and consumed on 6/9/2008.  A- Poured into an imperial pint glass, this beer pours a clear light gold color with a moderate sized head that settles to a thin layer. Each sip leaves some cool looking lacing on the glass.  S- Spicy, crisp, and clean aromas of piney and citrusy hops are backed up by a bit of sweet malt and some alcohol as the beer warms. A very green aroma of pure, raw hops.  T- A moderate hop bitterness is balanced out nicely by some cereal maltiness. The finish is dry and the lingering bitterness on back of the tongue is rather mild, which adds to the drinkability. This beer is aggressively hopped yet extremely well-balanced.  M- The mouthfeel has a lush and full-bodied texture with mild carbonation.  D- Outstanding drinkability. This is the most sessionable IPA I've had, even with the 6.9% ABV.  A fantastic example of an American IPA. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FtownThrowDown,4.18,"On draft at the Dilly Deli. One of these beers that I've drank quite a few of in the past and never rated. Pours a light gold in color with a nice frothy inch of head. Smell is crisp, piney and floral hops. Taste is clean, refreshing and more floral hops. Not over the top, but a nice easy drinking, solid IPA. This is an easy warm weather beer. This is too easy of a drinker. Very smooth and nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RomanW70,4.17,"Shaker glass. Pours golden with a thick frothy head. Aroma of sweet malts and hops. Big malt taste right up front, followed by a big bitter finish. IO was expecting to be blown away by the bitterness, but they only present strongly at the finish. One of the best IPA's I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,marc956,4.75,"The long sought-after answer to my beloved Lagunitas IPA that I sadly can't get down here!  Just got a 22oz bottle at my local HEB, this beer has a ton of flavour and hops which isn't for all of us, but if you like good beer + don't mind the extra alcohol (6.9%) I highly recommend this one! Probably too strong for a session beer but if you are having one or two it will satisfy most any1's taste buds. Cool bottle too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JonathanL7890,4.15,"Got a 22 oz bomber from my local liquor store. Stone IPA and Arrogant Bastard are the only 2 Stone brews available in Texas, so I tend to take these beers for granted.  Poured a 1 finger head into my imperial pint glass. Color is light amber. Aroma is floral citrusy, powerful for an IPA. taste is just the right balance between maltiness and hop bite that I expect from an IPA. Drinkability: I could drink a lot of this but I usually get a lower abv ipa for a session beer.  Extremely well balanced. Stone, you haven't let me down yet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Goliath,4.03,Pours a clear golden color with a huge three finger white head. Great retention.  The aroma holds some great hop notes. A big piney/citrusy feel.  The taste is quite nice. A slight hop bitterness with some piney hops. Feels kind of earthy.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a subtle carbonation tingle.  Drinkability is fairly high. Low levels of alcohol and simple but pleasing flavors make for easy consumption. An enjoyable experience.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,armock,4.42,A - Poured a golden color with a white head that leaves lacing  S - Is of wonderful citrus hops and more glorious hops  T - Has a very good taste citrus hops with a touch of pine  M - This is a medium bodied beer with medium carbonation to it  D - This is one of the most flavorful IPAs that I've had I could drink this all night long definitely worth going out of your way to find,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,witster18,4.14,"Pours a dark hazy Gold with a 3/4"" head that holds moderate and then has some nice inconsistent spotty lacing. The bubbles are sticky and prickly like the hoppy taste. Nose has Lime, Grapefruit and well,..somebody droppped a canadian spruce in here.... Taste is very clean and crisp with a slight alcohol warmth with lighter colored malt and those fruits. FInishes bitter hop but cleans up very nicely. Easy drinker...especially in the warm months... actually the warming effect would make this a nice year round brew now that I think about it.... so glad to see this only .5mile from my home...and kept cold....  The IPA is my favorite from this brewery. ""oaked""ABA is my second favorite.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gford217,4.35,"A: Pours a clear, bright golden with a big puffy white head that lingers for quite a while. Lacing is really nice on this one.  S: The aroma is all about the hops with citrus hops, mainly grapefruit and lemon zest, and floral resiny hops dominating the nose. There is a noticeable, if light, bready malt backbone as well.  T: The flavor is a more subdued version of the aroma with citrus and floral hops playing their part. For me, the sweet, bready malt backbone is more evident in the taste.  M: Mouthfeel is fairly light but creamy. The finish is extremely crisp and clean with only a slight bitterness in the aftertaste.  D: The light and crisp mouthfeel on this one make it extremely drinkable and would be an ideal spring and summer IPA. I could see this being a staple in my fridge if I had access to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,montageman,4.85,Poured into a pint glass.  What is there that can be said about this beer that probably hasn't been said already? This has to be the quintessential American IPA. Perfect taste and near perfect everywhere else. Stone never ceases to amaze me. This will become one of my go to beers. Absolutely awesome. Highest recommendation.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beerthulhu,4.1,"A: Poured a coppery-orange with a solid 1 finger foamy white head that retained well leaving a fair to good broken sheet lacing behind.  S: citrusy with grapefruits and fresh flowers against a semi-sweet toasted caramel backing.  T: nicely balanced in regards to the malt and hops with some spicy citrus and grapefruit notes more focused more on flavor then tongue numbing bitterness. The hopping was sharp and clean in nature with light sweet toasted caramel. The finish was very smooth, even toned thoughout and pleasant as it faded off the tongue with a slight dry flowery presence.  M: crisp, dry and felt very nice.  D: Classic example. A good solid example and hard to go wrong here or find reason to fault. A worthy recommend and nice try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ibbjamin,3.78,"Paid $9.29 for a 6pack of 12oz bottles from BevMo in Gilroy, CA. Poured into a pint glass.  This beer pours really well, leaving a fizzy 1.5 inch white head after a gentle pour. Nicely carbonated. Light yellowish orange color. Quite cloudy. Nice lacing. Minimal head retention.  Smells quite hoppy for a single IPA. Citrus, orange/grapefruit with hints of pine. West coast style. Malts are there, but are well taken over by the hoppiness.  Taste is nice and hoppy - grapefruit citrus mainly, but the malts back this one up nicely - actually more than my nose would have predicted.  Medium bodied. Mild creaminess to the mouthfeel. Perfectly carbonated and VERY drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Bitter finish.  O/ M - Great IPA! Velvety, creamy medium mouthfeel and body. Very smooth for IBU of 70+. One of my favorites!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BradLikesBrew,4.35,"a: Golden yellow body, thin white head, patches of lacing.  s: mmmm....citrusy, herbal, grapefruity hops.  t: caramel malt is swept up by bursting citric hops. The flavor is perfumey almost, very herbal and piney. A terrific IPA, bitch-slaps the palate.  m: syrupy, creamy and smooth.  d: I'll quote todd here, ""Simply put ... this is one insane IPA, and not for the weak palate. To compare it to other IPAs would be silly, however I think this sums it up ... Once Stone comes into a new market it's like a challenge to other brewers in the area: ""I know my big beers are bigger and better than yours, but let's see yours anyway. I promise not to laugh."" Oh ... and this is just their standard IPA doing the speaking.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GratefulBeerGuy,4,"12 oz. bottle > 16 oz. SA glass. A long over due update to this review 2/11/19**  The color reminds me of a golden clover honey with a short, bubbly white crown that dissipated pretty fast and left moderatley sticky lacing behind and spot-on carbonation level.  The aroma is pungent with deep fruity and resiny hops, like pineapple, strawberies and pine trees. Mild but sweet pale malt way down.  The flavor is a big, tart and bitter hop attack...the palate needs time to recover after the initial first taste. There's a pine-tree resin sharpness that mellows slightly to become fruity, but mostly fruits high in citric acid's like pineapple. The malt profile is a bit low, that's why I love the Ruination, because of it's thicker malt that balances out the bitter, sharp hop effect. The feel is crisp but sharp, due to the elevated heat at 6.9% and the bitter hops. Still, there's a pleasant smoothness as it goes down. Good depth and complexity in the hop flavor.  This is a classic Left-coast IPA with very agreesive hops and plenty of tongue-numbing bitterness. A hop-heads dream I suppose.  ** The review above is easily ten years old, and as I sip on this now (2/11/19) It all holds true except for its ""extreme"" nature, which was very true then. These days, with the super bold New England styles and mega DIPA's, this seems pretty tame. Still a HOF'er, and a true classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,wardough,4.67,"Awesome. Don't pass up this well balanced IPA.  A: Pours a light gold, almost like a Tripel. S: Piney caramel. It's awesome. T: Malts, followed by bittering hops.

147,88,AZTEX,4.25,"I poured from a bottle into a glass. I got a pretty good foam that quickly broke down, but did leave some great crystalline cobwebs on the glass. This IPA is light gold in color, almost a honey color. The smell was not very complex but was very hoppy. The beer had a mild malty taste up front that finished with a strong hoppiness. Very refreshing. The mouthfeel was surprisingly rich (almost creamy) for a light colored, hoppy ale. A very drinkable ale. I'm sure I'll drink it again and now I want to try Stone Ruination Ale.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,everetends,4.13,"Got this at Midtown in Nashville. 22oz bomber poured into a shaped pint.  A: This beer poured a glowing, hazy orange with a nice, big head. The head created some sticky lacing throughout the glass. Looks so good you want it.  S: Big time hops. Lots of floral and citrus going on there. You also pick up on some clove and spice.  T: This one blew me away. It had a definite hops bitterness that came from the flavors of floral and citrus. The grapefruit and orange flavors cool it off with the malt. Still have a bitterness in the finish that really challenges the taste buds.  M: A nice medium carbonation that keep this somewhat light on the tongue and refreshing. The finish was a bit strange. It left your mouth dry and parched at times.  D: This was a great beer. I wouldn't drink more than a bomber in a sitting but I would keep a few bombers in the cellar. I am really looking forward to Ruination now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,hdofu,4.18,"Love the bottle... (my friend wouldn't let me keep the porter bottle we split :( ) This beer has Knox block color with a thick active white head. Smell is really tops as far as hops goes. This beer is heavy with hops but has a hint of sweetness in the finish, though nothing compared to dogfish head's 60 minute ipa sweetness wise, may also have a hint of sesame in the flavor. A rather heavy and slick feel to the tongue with lite feel of bubbles. This beer is pretty drinkable... too bad its so pricey. Yet again another enjoyable brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beachbum1975,4.5,"Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date. I love the gargoyle in all of Stone's beers. She pours slightly hazy with a ¼ inch white head with little sticking. Color is light orange/gold. Initial head does not retain long, but long spider legs hang around on the walls.  Smell: An abundance of floral hops, bright and fresh on the nose. Amazing smell.  Taste: Yum. Heavy, floral hops mixed with just the right bitterness. Wonder balance of roasted malts and tangy, bitter hops.  Mouthfeel: Slightly syrupy on the mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very. Excellent session beer - If you get the chance, try this. Superb example of an American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,fitzy84,3.69,"Had on tap at Moan and Dove. The drink had a murky orange color with a quickly thinned head and lacing. There was a sharp citrus and floral aroma strongly emitting from the drink. Compared to the smell, the taste was a bit weaker with the citrus still apparent. Medium body in general, giving it a good carbonation but nothing more. Overall, strong aroma flavors while other dimensions are just above average.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ben4881,4.37,"Stone IPA (India Pale Ale) Stone Brewing Co.  Appearance: This beer is translucent straw yellow color with suggestions or orange. The color is much paler than I expected. There is a frothy white head that dissipates quickly, but not entirely. Minor traces of lace stick to the glass.  Smell: Nothing complicated here. All I smell is piney hops. Nothing fancy, nothing unexpected: right on the mark.  Taste: Similar to the smell in that it's very well executed. The taste is smooth and refreshing up front with the flavor or oily organic hops. The kickback upon swallowing is slow, creeping, bitter, and piney. The aftertaste continually becomes dry and cottony while the pine needle flavor tingles and tickles the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Stone IPA has a light to medium body. Adequate carbonation gives it some levity and airiness. The aftertaste leaves a sticky cottonmouth feeling.  Drinkability: This is a solid IPA. Nothing overpowering and nothing complicated. This beer is a welcome companion on a long morning, afternoon, or night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bitzy,4.59,"Great IPA! I usually don't drink very bitter beers like IPA's, but this one really impressed me.  Appearance: cloudy golden color with a 1/4 inch head that slowly disspates, leaving some lacing on the glass.  Smell: Although the hops jump at you, the sweetness of backround flavors of citrus and cloves are apparant and inviting.  Taste: The different hops combined in this fabulous brew lend themselves to a sweet and floral twang that tickles the taste buds. The hops are delicious and balanced by the sweetness of the malts. Also, the bitterness is perfectly placed in the overall taste experience of the beer.  Drinkability: Although this beer is delicious, I could not drink more than one at a time. I split a 22oz. bottle with 2 other friends and slowly sipped it and enjoyed all its complexities.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rodcom,3.96,"good ipa. Smells like one as you open the bottle you are looking forward to a good beer. As you taste it the hops are right there on top and a decent follow through. However, there are just simply better IPA's our there including hop devil and dogfish that I have had. Certainly would buy it and you will not be disappointed, but you might do better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Stinkypuss,4.32,"A. 3 finger head with nice retention. Appears like a pale ale, which is what it is afterall.  S. Very notable nose of sweet juicy hops.  T. Surprisingly well balanced hops and sweet malt. Slightly sweet and a tad bitter. As it approaches room temperature the sweetness comes out a bit more and reminds me of pineapple juice. Just delicious.  M. Light and crisp, leaves the palate wanting more.  D. Just purchased a case, forgot how good these were.  Overall: Possibly my favorite IPA, the hops are top notch yet not overpowering. A very tasty well balanced brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Heavy and rich hop aroma dominates the nose. Citrusy and slightly fruity. The taste doesnt dissapoint. Suprisingly smooth thick hop flavor up front, followed by a noticeable malt presence in the finish. Alot smoother mouthfeel and finish than expected. A highly drinkable IPA! Overall, this was much better than I expected. I assumed that this would shred my tastebuds with all the hops, but it turns out that this is a very well rounded beer. Not that I have anything against extremely hopped up beers, but there are times when highly hopped but smooth beer sounds good, and this is it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,emerge077,4.15,"A classic west coast IPA. Golden orange body, with a thin cap of creamy foam that retains itself and laces well.  Light citrus in the aroma, fresh with a touch of green hops. It's not as pungent as I expected, but it's certainly pleasant. Pale malt and vegetal notes come out later as it warms up.  Bitterness is not to an extreme level, but it's up there. Not mild by any means, the bitter hop notes come out more in the aftertaste. There's some grapefruit/citrus rind, balanced by a tasty light maltiness. Very quenching and easy to drink, i've gone through two bombers this week, and Ruination is on deck after this one...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A classic IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,AKBelgianBeast,4.15,"A classic for a good session.  Stone IPA pours a slightly cloudy orangey yellow with good white head. Nose is balls out citrus hops. Taste pretty much follows, super west coast grapefruit citrus hops with somewhat of a malt backbone, but the hops overpower them by far. The mouthfeel is good, drinkability is pretty good too. Overall this is a great session IPA, but it is quite unbalanced on the hop side of things. Personal preference would be for just a touch more maltiness in here, but overall it is a great IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,paco1029384756,4.52,"Pour is a nice light golden/orange color with white head. Scent is big on hops with some orange peel, lemon, and lime and a hint of cinnamon. Taste is overflowing with hops, some spice and a faint citrus sweetness. The mouthfeel is great with the huge bitterness, pretty smooth. Drinkability is as high as it gets, just amazing.  It's hard to believe that this is an IPA; it is strong as hell, and it kicks the ass of almost all of the IPAs I have had before it. With it's alcohol content and drinkability, it is both a blessing and a curse to not have any more at the moment.

Beer itself is an orange amber, beautiful in color. Smell is all hops, piny resiny citrius hops. First sip perfectly echos the aroma . A very nice hop bite on the tongue, citrius and pine resin.

147,88,maximum12,3.6,"Thanks to TexasStout for this bomber of Stone IPA.  Appearance gets an appreciative nod not only for the gorgeous golden color but for that absolutely freakin' cool Stone bottle. You could leave a row of these up as art in your house with no one the wiser. Smell's a slap in the nads even a full arm's length away, all roses & hops.  This is a good IPA. There's lots of sweet in the back as the beer goes down further, the hoppy bite is there, & the malt in the background. It doesn't wow the tongue like it grabbed by nose, but good stuff nonetheless.  A little too much ABV for a session beer, not in my top tier of IPAs. I could drink a glass or two, but would switch out to something either more wicked or subtle.  All in all something I'm glad to have tried.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LoboLikesBeer,4.33,"A: Impressive silk screened brown bottle, freshness indicator stamped on glass. Aggressive, multi-staged pour to form pretty off-white ""ice cream cone"" head in a standard pint glass. Rich golden honey color tinted with amber, sporting a slightly sexy haze. Solid head retention, forming sponge like puck with sticky lacing down the glass.  S: After a couple of swirls to break up the puck like settled head, the nose released a sweet floral hop aroma, followed by some citrus notes, very pleasurable. After some whiffs there was a detectable sweetish malt base.... A harbinger of what was to come.  T: This is where this brew shines. Unbelievable hop profile, pronounced yet still subtle. Citrus, grapefruit up front followed right behind with wonderful floral notes filling in, then just the right amount of bitterness grabs your tongue. A malt backbone supporting the whole hop extravaganza is there but defiantly takes a back seat.  M: Decent carbonation, not as thick as I expected but certainty not thin, again the hops just stick all over you with their tasty goodness. Defiantly a pleasure to have in your mouth.  D: Well what can I say, with almost 2000 reviews at this time, I'm just adding to the legend, throwing another log on the fire. So here we go.... Extremely drinkable, a classic depiction of the style, west coast all the way, top notch hop profile that grabs you by the face, but doesn't over power, showing its complex hop flavor but not lacking in bitterness or ABV and just enough malt to not be forgotten. A wonderful IPA, and a fine beer period, I can see why Stone gets may accolades, well done indeed!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This is a good beer, and nicely exemplifies this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells of grapefruit, pineapple, grass clippings, pine needles, and honey, lots of hop character in there.

Lots of hoppy flavors, easy to drink, very sessionable, even if it is almost 7% ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GeoffW,3.93,"Poured a slightly cloudy straw/ golden color. Rocky white head with decent retention.  Smelled bitter with a lot of citrus and a bit fruity.  Taste was remarkably smooth for a stone beer, especially considering the usual comments about its ""big character"" on the bottle. Even though it was smooth, it had plenty of bitter in it. The result is a taste that is really nice and hoppy but without the face wrinkling overbearing quality that plagues many IPAs. The aftertaste is a lingering citrus flavour.  Drinkability was decent. This isn't my go to style of beer which means that I wouldn't want more than one of them in a sitting. Despite that, this is a damn good IPA, possibly the best IPA I've had yet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Cal I've only had it a couple times in the last 2 or 3 years since in my first couple experiences with it I just found it too ""grassy"" of an IPA. Well I don't know what has changed- my palate, or their recipe but this was a fantastic IPA. It had a bit of citrus in it which I never noticed before plus a load of pine. I will definitely be ordering this as one of my regular beers from now on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

There isn't much I could complain about in this beer.  Great ""C"" hop aroma and flavor. The bitterness is apparent but isn't crushing. There's a small malt backbone to it, but it's not sweet even for an IPA. It finishes dry. I'm left feeling like I can, and have, consume 4 or 5 of these.  What a great example of a West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Taste & Mouth Feel Full hop flavor; they really did deliver on their promise of lots of hops; mouthfeel is a little thin, with not a lot of carbonation; leaves a really nice bitter aftertaste; the malt side is just present enough, though is by no means in balance with the hops, which is totally fine; gets better as it warms (malts become a little more noticeable)  Overall Very nice! I wish I could pick this up whenever I wanted. The hops smell and taste are just so pleasing, it keeps me coming back, rushing this first bottle quite a bit!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Avryle,4.43,"A- Clear yellow orange. Minimal cream colored head  S- Citrus & pine hop with a note of malt  T- Similar to the nose. Stong cirtus & pine hops dominate with sweetness in the back  M- medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Taste lingers on the tounge  D- Excellent. ""More bottles!!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,clayrock81,4.22,"An organish-tint that is somewhat seethru and carbonates greatly. Received a rocky, two-finger head that dies quickly but leaves sticky lace patches. An unbelievable floral and earthy hop smell complete with fruits and spices mixed in. One of the few beers to actually make me turn away to catch my breath (it was like I had put my nose in a peanut butter jar; my breath was literally taken away). The hops dominate the tastebuds while only being slightly spicy and mildly bready, and this beer actually has a smooth finish. Don't know why exactly, thought I tasted caramel and/or butterscotch and the hops gave off some fruitiness (like apples), but a great finish to a great beer. Considering I can get this on the cheap at my local grocery store, this is a must redrink and I recommend it to any IPA drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GPHarris,4.5,"a - poured a one finger thick off-white thick and bilowy head into a goblet. left great sheeting and lace, coating the glass throughout. s - sweet and minty (wasn't expecting that) with grapefruit and other citrus aromas. t - this is very balanced. sweet and malty with an understated citrusy flavor in the beginning. piney hops and more citrus flavors really come through in the finish. m - medium thickness but really creamy and smooth on the palate. d - wow. incredibly easy drinking ipa from stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dmamiano,4.14,"Poured a little hazy. Medium straw in color. Nice big head left fair amount of lacing. Smells was a good mix of hops and malt. Very big and floral, and then again the caramel and crystal malts poked through nicely. Taste was a well balanced pale ale. Very hoppy, but well balanced with the malt of caramel. Grainy and good. Mouthfeel was good as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,blatherbeard,4.45,"Ok, after tasting the Ruination, i had to break into the regular ipa and i have to say that im am SO glad i did. The color and smells were almost the same as ruination, fruity, red orange amber.  But the taste is much different. I realize now that the Ruination was an imperial Ipa, i didnt realize that until i read the reviews after my review of it. I am a much bigger fan of this regular Ipa. Not so much hops and none of the bitterness. Nice smooth going down and very drinkable. Bit of a bite at the back of the throat after swallowing, but not in a bad way. Definetly more of a beer for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nasty15108,4.1,"Poured from a 1pt 6oz bomber into a pint glass.  A - Golden color with slightly darker hues. Thick white foam with good lacing.  S - Hoppy, loaded with hops. Hints of citrus and spice. Very floral, smells a little like perfume.  T - Hops galore, crisp with slight hints of citrus. Dry spicy finish.  MF&D - Thin to medium bodied IPA. Spicy and flavorful finish. Highly recommended. Paired extremely well with a spicy bowl of turkey chili.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnnyirishman,4.17,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Pint glass.  Apperance- Cloudy Orange color, with good head retention and good lacing  Smell- Big citrus hop smell and some grapefruit.

147,88,Pencible,4.13,"This poured a hazy honey gold with nice off-white head. It smelled like sweet pine and some roasted yeast. It tasted very sugary with some hops bitterness and mild yeast for balance. It was fairly watery with no carbonation and a gentle sweet aftertaste. Overall this was much more sweet than bitter for an IPA, but it was tasty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,philbe311,3.87,"A - Light golden ale, slightly hazy, pours with 1/4 inch head and leaves a delicate and inviting lace...  S - Smells like a text book IPA with the slightest hint of lemon and an even slighter hint of malt...  T - Terrific blend of hops... ""Biting"" in a very good way... A possible hint of grapefruit...  M - Smooth and creamy at first leaving a very dry and bitter feel in its wake... Very mild carbonation on the tongue...  D - A potent IPA... Definitely one to be savored and not rushed... Finely crafted and a joy to drink...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hokies,4.07,"A: Poured a clear light golden brown color with a one finger head and decent lacing.  S: Definite floral aroma with a light citrus and grapefruit aroma.  T: Very balanced IPA with a strong grapefruit taste at first that finishes clean with a light lemon taste that lingers on the tongue.  M: Smooth and creamy, very nice.  D: Very nice IPA but not a beer I could drink all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dnichols,4.5,"I was served this beer on-tap in a chilled pint glass at Sam's Saloon in Kennewick, Washington.  A: It poured a cloudy bright orange tinged and golden body with a one finger head that supported a dense lacing.  S: It has a distinct floral hop aroma with supporting aromas of sweet citrus and lightly toasted malts. Very well balanced and refreshing aroma.  T: It was another well balanced ale from Stone. The hops and malts play off of each other presenting a creamy, spicy, and citrusy brew that was hard to put down.  M: It was light to medium bodied, creamy, smooth and finished clean.  D: This is a masterful IPA...well balanced and smooth. It is a wonderful session brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,timbro81,4.09,Thanks to Beertracker for the opportunity. Pours a light straw color with decent clarity and a good 1/4 inch head that settles to a fine ring that leaves little lacing down the glass. Smells of big time grapefruit with a touch of floral hops. The nose becomes maltier as it warms up. Tingles the tongue with those grapefruits right away. Some lemon and grassy notes also discernable. A pleasant dose of sweet malts all around. Well structured. Smooth oily mouthfeel. The maltiness also becomes more noticable as it warms. A great IPA that is layered nicely.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brandoneast,4.05,I had this at Wild Bills Casino in Lake Tahoe. I found this IPA to be very well rounded with a malty slide. There wasn't much head from the bartender's pour but the color was medium amber and a spicy hop aroma. Taste was very balanced with a medium mouthfeel medium. Great finish!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rgb2807,4.82,"The color is light orange. This IPA is a winner, it's bitter but the malt comes through oh so nicely. Some nice citrus flavors come through with the hops. The balance is amazing, I freaking love this beer. The only problem is it's a little pricey on the east coast. Check out the Arrogant Bastard Strong Ale as well. This is a close 2nd in my favorite IPA (first is smuttynose). SO freaking drinkable, I could drink this all night, which might be a little dangerous.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ckeegan04,4.19,"Bottle into pilsner glass.  A - Golden color with good two finger head and excellent retention. Lacing was moderate.  S - Strong hop aroma dominates the smell. Picked up a very piney scent from the hops.  T - Very strong hop flavor dominates the entire drink. Nice bitterness at the end. Just enough malts (biscuity?) to balance it out in the middle. Hops are definitely the overwhleming taste though.  M/D - Good carbonation and very smooth. Nice bitter aftertaste leaves you wanting another.  A very strong IPA and an excellent intro into the Stone lineup. My favorite from them is still the Ruination, but this is a darn tasty beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,trackstar1043,4.12,"A - Pours rich deep redish-golden hue, rocky off white head that left large amonts of sticky lace. Impressive.  S - Storng and sharp aromas of hops, bitter bit with a spice lingering, much stornger that most IPA I've had.  T - Sharp and strong, mild alcohol taste, the spices and hops bit sharply at your taste buds, for a refreshing and impressive finish.  M - Full bodied but refreshing, it will leave your tounge tingling with its bite.  D - Very enjoyable, looking forward to next round.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jeremyd365,4.65,"Appeared very dark amber in the pint glass with minimal head.  It smelled strongly of hops even far from the glass.  It felt medium-bodied in the mouth and tasted very hoppy, not too heavy with little bite.  It was a very drinkable and great tasting beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HugoGrim,4.42,"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint. Classic IPA look, body maybe a shade light. Nice head retention, creamy white and bubbly.  Aroma is fairly muted. Hops dominate obviously, citrus elements, as well as herbs and some spices.  Hop flavor is wet and spicy, as well as Earthy and piney. Freshly cut wood is prominent. Strong bitter oils on the back of the tongue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cjgator3,4.3,"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with a nice sticky white head. The aroma is oily fresh citrusy hops with some malt. The taste is dominated by the bitter citrusy hops that are quite puckering and last well into the finish. There is a mild malt presence in the background, but it is hard to even the slightest attention to the malt before the hops demand your full attention. Overall, this is a fabulous West Coast IPA that I would highly recommend. If this was available here in FL, it would be a staple in my fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,callmemickey,4.23,A: Golden/straw color body with off-white creamy dense head with loads of lace...  S: Not as hoppy on the nose as i'd expect.. they certain are there... but no where near as aromatic as most other ipa's coming out of the west coast these days...  T: Slightly more hops going on in the taste.. slightly piney and oily.. some malts and grains hold down the fort in the middle of the profile... slight bitter finish  M: Smooth. Crisp finish. Moderate body.  D: Pretty solid all around.. Won't be my first choice when I want an arromatic IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,flannelman808,3.86,"Good IPA but not up to the fundamental stone standard of bitterness. Or maybe this is their attempt to attract the masses.  It's a light bodied IPA (I would argue a pale ale even) with some citrus character up front. A fresh pour of this is quite good and shows bright ruby red grapefruit with minimal malty sweetness to balance (read as not overly bitter but dry finishing). This is a good intro to IPA beer, A gateway beer if you will.  Also the price is right, and ya gotta love that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,erosier,4.47,"This beer pours a golden amber color with a medium sized but thick tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of very nice citrisy and piney hops. The taste is great! Very nice roasted malt backbone underneath a bold citrisy and piney hop flavor. The mouthfeel is nice - very crisp and dry finish. The drinkability is very good as well. I would definately have a few of these if I could. Well worth a try, excellent IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,alysmith4,3.98,"Tried this on-tap at the Old Dominion Brewhouse here in DC. It was delicious! Very similar in fact to the Dogfish 60 Minute IPA. I had a hard time telling the difference.  Appearance was good.. rich, golden color, with a nice 1"" head. The smell was nice, fresh.. of fruit, straw, and hops. The taste was excellent.. lots of hop flavor along with apples and pears and straw. Very fresh. I would definitely recommend this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hckyfn9999,4.58,"Pours a slightly orangish, golden color. A little lighter in color than most IPA's. Nice thick white head that has good retention and leaves a ton of lace. Aroma is hops. Citrusy grapefruit and pine lead the way here.  Taste is very hoppy. Grapefruit peel is very strong here. Its not pure hops though as some bready malt along with a touch of caramel help balance things out. Lingering bitterness on the palate. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth, pleasant carbonation level. Well worth seeking out while I was in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. Unfortunately its not available in MO, maybe sometime soon it will be. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CrellMoset,4.54,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville into a pint glass.  Appearance: Transparent orange amber with a sticky, one-and-a-half-finger head with great retention. Lacing is equally sticky, bubbles are active. The color really is very nice, a treat to look at.  Smell: Every hop scent imaginable is present here - I detect fruity esters (predominantly orange, but with some tangy lemon and pineapple as well), crisp pine, and spiciness floral herbs. Very pungent, I can smell it from quite some distance.  Taste: Spicey! Peppery, herbal hops hit first, with bright, brilliant citrus and sharp, sprucelike notes present as well. Moderate malty sweetness and a touch of earthy mustiness from the yeast, as well as the slightest hint of alcohol, rounds it off. Damn.  Mouthfeel: Probably the creamiest IPA I've ever had. It's very smooth, which is somewhat at odds with such a crisp taste, but it works surprisingly well.  Drinkability: A pretty big beer, large and in charge. Really very enjoyable, eminently sessionable, available in sixers or 22 oz bottles ... what more do you need? A world-class American IPA.  I do believe we have a winner. My new favorite IPA, I didn't believe it possible to pack this many distinct hop notes into one beer. Excellent dry-hopping - a very assertive, very fruity, very pleasant surprise. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BlankFrank,4.49,"The look of the beer is really nice: orangey amber with a great, thick white head that leaves lace all over the glass.  Grapefruit hops and some floral sweetness fill the nose. The smell really comes at you, but it's definitely welcome. I really don't think that there is a single flaw in the aroma, and I could sniff this all day.  From the appearance and the smell, the taste has a lot of hype to live up to, and it does. A very commanding bitter hops flavor dominates with crisp grapefruit, resin, and a little sweetness. Grains come in at the aftertaste to balance things out, followed by a some more hoppy bitterness.  The body is medium with an appropriate amount of carbonation. You can feel it as it goes down, which is nice.  This is especially refreshing on a hot day, and I could drink more than my fill of it. However, I don't think that such an assertive beer can be enjoyed to its fullest at just any time or place. Then again, I'm glad the intense flavor wasn't compromised so that anyone could chug it down like Bud, Miller, etc.  Stone has certainly set a high standard for IPAs everywhere. This will probably turn anybody into a hop-head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Vansmack,4.47,"Have to admit that this is one of my favorite IPA's on the planet. When you head out to Stone brewery, they take you on a wicked 45 minute tour highlighting why a Stone brew is different and made better than any beer.  They packed this sucker full of hops and it definitely will smack you on the side of the head when you taste it. Very hoppy, smooth, crisp beer.  I highly recommend this beer to anyone who is trying to move from a Pale Ale up to an IPA.  Hope this review helps.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Raymond69,3.97,"Appears a hazy straw orange. Small head , slight lacing.  Smell is citrus , slight pine.  Of course this is hoppy , with citrus, grapefruit and bitterness coming through. Slight sweet maltiness is in the background.  Mouthfeel is medium , hops leave a residual aftertaste. Decent carbonation.  Overall i nice beer I recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,macster,4.3,"A west coast treat for this craft beer deprived Florida boy.  Gorgeous pour revealing a slightly hazy bright orange-gold hue under a thick, tight white head.  Aroma of freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice into one glass, backed by a faint nose of lemon, pine needles and caramel malt.  Palate shows a fine and mild spritzy carbonation with a medium body which was perfect for the style.  No mistaking the big hop additions in the flavors; lots of citrus and pine in tune with the delicious aromas. A touch of sweetness from the caramel malts are noted mid-palate, but the finish is a crisp and bitter hop contribution; nice and long. These guys are good!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,andrewt960,3.92,"A- Poured a nice gold with a ever so slight orange look shade. It had a nice head, partly due to an aggressive pour. The head didn't stick around for the whole beer, and lacing is somewhat evident. S- Had a nice initial floral hop smell that was nice. A touch of malts, and even a bite of sweetness. The hops were def up front and stuck around the most. MF/D- not to bitter, and flavor stuck around for a bit on the tongue. The Hops were pretty crisp, and the malt was subtle, making it a very enjoyable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chiefydawg,4.29,"From notes in the past:  Deep straw-colored body. Somewhat cloudy with fairly active effervescence. Thin but busy looking white head.  Smells hoppy, fresh, and fruity, with a slight floral touch. Maybe even some sweetness. Somebody could write a review about the scent. Absolutely wonderful  Fresh tasting with a hoppy bite. Can taste some alcohol after the first three sips. After warming, still hoppy and pleasantly astringent, with the malt stepping up. The boldness seems to pick up as I go. Fresh and balanced to the last sip. A nice example of a tastefully heavy-handed IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jeremy13586,4,"A very nice light amber color when it hit the glass. Had a decent white head that stuck around for a little bit. Fruity hoppiness in the nose. A solid malt backbone to support the hoppiness of the beer. Perfectly carbonated with a medium body and a clean finish. A very smooth brew. If I wasn't so broke, I'd buy a case right now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,charlzm,3.74,"Bottled, consumed on 11/27/07.  Beautiful clear golden with lots of active carbonation. A beautiful one finger white head floats atop this brew.  Aroma: grassy, sweet, grapefruit hops.  Flavor: Lemony, grassy hops. Fleeting sweetness from the malt, then some peppery hops in the aftertaste.  If you're into hoppy beers, it's a good one. A real hop-head, West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ElGeordie,3.75,"Tried this one in a 22 Oz bottle. This is a very good true IPA. Pours a beautiful colour with a fine head that lasts. The hops are very fragrant and fruity. A fine beer, very drinkable. The only criticism I'd have is that it could use a little more malt to offer a more complex after taste once the hop flavour disapates.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bassmantin,4,"Pours a fairly light orange/yellow with a decent white head.  Smell is excellent. Floral and hoppy, but not too bitter. The taste is great. It's hoppy but not terribly intense. It's a bit too sweet for me (a self-confessed hophead), unlike the Ruination which much heaver in the hops. Nonetheless, this is one you cant' put down.  A great IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,calebmills,4.79,"Alright ill get straight to the point. I love this beer! Im already a fan of hoppy ales/lagers especially IPAs and this is by far one of the best out there in my opinion. Pours that classis IPA orange color. Smells of wonderful hops. The taste is great you have the classic crisp hoppy flavor and its not overwhelmed by the alcohol. I could enjoy this one year round for sure. When i compare it to the ruination IPA from stone i like this one better suprisingly because of the lower alcohol that doesnt take away taste from all the hops. But if your looking for a little extra buzz go with the Ruination. You wont go wrong either way trust me. Oh and this ones a little bit cheaper as far as i know. Once again props to stone. without them and other micro's we would be stuck in piss water hell with bud,coors, and miller",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tronester,4.8,"Pours a crystal clear golden orange, with a pure white, rocky head. Smells citrusy and piney. Taste is quite dry, with an herbal and citrus hop flavor, as well as a tiny bit of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation levels are low. I could drink several of these, they taste wonderful, one of the best American IPA's I have ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jscondon,3.93,"This beer pours a lovely golden hue with a decent head and a nice level of carbonation. The smell is not distinctly hoppy, i am thinking that this bottle might be oxidized because i do detect some cardboard. I have had the beer before and will give the brew the benefit of the doubt and blame the packy for poor turnover. When I drink the beer it is real nice, it has a flowery flavor up front with a mild middle and a decent hoppiness to the finish. Decent thickness to the mouth.  In all I think this one is pretty good, but I wish the bottle was not oxidized.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ams0286,4.38,"Personally I hold a special spot in my heart for IPA's. Unfortunatly due to the shortage of hops this year I am scared that premium IPA's such as Stone's will increase even more in price. This is one of those ""once it hits your lips"" beers, in fact you feel that way even before you taste it.  A - A golden slightly hazey color characteristic of the style with a thick, foamy, long lasting head. Lacing remains in the glass until the last drop.  S - This is where the pleasure truely begins. Immediatly hops come through with undertones of fruit (pineapple/citrus). This aroma is very fragrent reminding me of perfume. Along the same lines as Southern Tier Unearthly, however not as pungent and offensive, more appetizing.  T - Immediatly the hop bitterness comes through and then it is softened by the frutiness of the beer. Very smooth, mouthwatering and long lasting taste. As you continue to drink you feel the warming sensation, fragrent perfume continues to linger in the mouth. Not overly hopped and very well balanced.  M - The mouthfeel on this IPA is full bodied, almost boardering on syrupy. Carbonation helps to disperse the flavor and aroma however it is mostly covered by the hoppy bitterness.  D - This is deffinetly a big beer. It leaves you wanting more however it would be difficult to make this a session beer with such pronounced aroma and hoppy flavor.  This is one of the best IPA's I have had in a long time and I look forward to sampling their other varieties of IPA. I highly reccomend this to any hopped beer lover and I know I will be consuming several in the near future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,woemad,4.09,"12oz bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $1.93. No freshness date on the bottle. I've had this before a couple of times, but always on-tap. In fact, I bought this because I've never seen a bottle of it before.  Not a terribly promising pour. It came a slightly darker shade than most macro-lagers, with a skiff of white foam. Fortunately that foam then expanded into a decent inch or so. Spotty lace.  I may be crazy (most would say there's no question), but I swear this smells like lime. I'm used to IPAs with a citrusy charcter, but I've never got lime from them. Also a peppery spiciness is present.  The taste is a mixture of juicy citrus fruit and bitter hoppiness. A very shy caramel-like malt sweetness can be gleaned, but it's way in the background. Finish is pleasingly dry.  Mouthfeel is oily with hop resin, but the body is sufficiently light to not come across as thick or cloying.  A very tasty IPA that I could definitely have several of if the occaision allowed it. Needing to shove off for work soon precludes that, sadly. I definitely will drink this again, however.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jaxon53,4.32,"Served this chilled, in a pint glass, from a twenty-two ounce bottle. Appearance: Pours out a cloudy golden orange color. Beer was capped by a thick, frothy two finger white head. Head settled rather slowly, and left generous streaks of foamy white lace. Not a real lot of visible carbonation.  Smell: Great nose here. Tons of resiny floral hop aromas. Lots of thick citrus aromas, mainly grapefruit, and orange peel. Bready and malty with some yeasty notes. Maybe just a bit of pine buried in the background. Very earthy.  Taste: Nice juicy, yet bitter hops. Almost a medicinal like flavor to the hops. Also some grapefruit, lemon zest, and some orange flavor this brew nicely. All of this piled on top of a thick malty backbone. Finishes yeasty and smooth with a bitter hop bite. Not much noticeable alcohol. Pretty good flavor, and well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodies mouth fell that is quite pleasing. Nice bit of tongue tingling carbonation.  Drinkability: Pretty good drinkability. Very clean and crisp and quite refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

All I pick up is straight floral hops  T - This is a delicious balanced hoppy IPA. I love this beer!  M - Medium bodied with very light carbonation  D - This one is so very drinkable. I could drink these all day  Excellent beer that I really wish we had here in Georgia.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,1PA,4.79,"The nose on this beer makes my mouth water.  Well rounded with a nice finish. They balanced the bitterness very well. Even though is well balanced, it is still a bit heavy so 1-2 is enough for the night, but its all about quality, not quantity. I strive to one day brew 1/2 as good beer as this.  I hope they brew this in heaven.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ojclark,4.42,"Initial strong aroma of hops that settled down to a more subtle hop aroma after a minute. Poured with a golden color, and a frothy head that was still a half inch thick a few minutes after pouring. Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation. The beer coated the mouth for several seconds after each sip. This evolved into a pleasantly ligering aftertaste that was a good mix of bitterness and hop flavor. This is an excellent, well-crafted beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mrasskicktastic,3.8,"A - Clear copper to gold brew, a gigantic head and a good amount of broad lacing. The body of the brew is still, there are no bubbles of carbonation moving through it . . . interesting.  S - Hops. Predominantly a blend of fragrant pine and spicy white pepper with some citrus pith and faint earth. There is even a hint of cracked grain.  T - There are some bitter hops kicking in the foretaste even, although there is still a good amount of peppery hops and a touch of a light caramel malt. The bitter hops (still peppery) dominate the aftertaste with a hint of some honey and biscuits.  M - Pretty smooth, thin, a little refreshing, could easily be better (especially considering I was in one of those ""I could REALLY use a beer"" moods when I poured this).  D - Pretty good. Easy to drink and pleasant. I'll have again, likely. Stone is really up and down for me - but this one actually struck toward the middle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WJVII,4.32,"My BA friend (cdkrenz) brought this back for me from Vegas.  Poured into a pint glass this brew was a clean gold color that was minimally transparent. Very little head.  The aroma was overwhelmingly HOPS, but in a good way. It also boasted a sweet smell as well.  In taking my first sip I was expecting a very bitter taste, but there was actually a great balance of hops and a sweet maltiness. There was just the right amount of carbonation to give this a great mouthfeel yet leaving it with a clean crisp aftertaste.  This is a very solid IPA. You can tell this beer is made of high quality ingredients. I will look for more from Stone brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Matty1918,4.19,I've heard alot about this IPA and finally bought a rack to try. I like IPAs....they're my second favorite type of beer.  No freshness date on the bottle but it was stored in the beer cooler.  I poured the first bottle in a frosted pint glass....not much of a head ( the second was poured into the same pint glass and a much better head was expereinced) it poured a cloudy honey color.  great aroma...HOPS HOPS and more HOPS  A great first sip...a little bitter and you taste the hops with a hint of caramel malt maybe  A great IPA...I'll have to sample other brews from STONE,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chinabeergeek,4.3,"clear golden amber, decent head that slowly shrinks to thin layer. some lacing but a bit scraggly.  intense fresh, resiny pine aroma. hint of citrus rind and caramel, maybe slight yeastiness.  more pine in the palate, very strong, but gives way to some citrusy zest and then a faint malt background. bitterness is aggressive throughout, into a resinous finish that hints of fruit.  slightly thinner than i expected. hop pucker and astringency.  just wish there was a little more fruitiness and a little more malt. otherwise a bold american ipa",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hatch,4.25,"Pours from a 12oz brown bottle with a pry-off cap. Freshness date is present on bottle. I love these bottles.  Pours a somewhat dark, golden amber color with a white head about one finger thick, or more depending on how you pour it. Leaves a good amount of lacing that sticks around for a while on the way down.  Smells of citrusy, and piney hops. A lot of hops present in the nose, and a mild spiciness here.  Hops everywhere. In just the right amount too. Not enough to want to call it a double IPA, but perfect for an IPA. Taste of citrusy mainly, but with a lot of piney hops coming in afterwards. Has a good malt base to balance things out. Good amount of bitterness to finish things out. Alcohol isn't very noticeable at all.  Great mouthfeel; oily and creamy. Great level of carbonation.  Very drinkable for an IPA.  Notes: Probably the best example of an IPA I've ever tasted. I've had double IPAs before which lean towards the extreme side, but if you're not looking for extreme amount of hops, but still want a good fix, this is your brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JDV,3.8,"Rich honey to amber colored pour with relatively short lived head. Smell at first is big bold fresh hops, but in a matter of a couple minutes, the hops dissipated dramatically, and turned into a lightly aromatic honey and caramel with the faintest hint of alcohol. I've never noticed the hops aroma fading, or especially that quickly. Taste was actually rather smooth, sweet, and very mildly bittered and flavored from the hops. My girlfriend who can't normally drink IPA's from the bitterness actually liked this one. I was expecting a huge wack in the mouth from hops in this one after reading the bottle's description but it just didn't happen. I happen to like the milder side of IPAs rather than overly extreme, so it was nice, but I'd think some might be dissapointed. For 70 IBUs it was a cinch to drink, very enjoyable and worth getting again",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dsigmon,4,"A: blonde in appearance with big head and great retention  S: a little more floral than expected with some sour citrus and bready notes  T: hops bite a little at first but then the bread and citrus come to the rescue and balance this out for an incredible experience  M: very carbonated and dry, crisp and refreshing, not as heavy and oily as i would like  D: i would love to have a six of this after working outside, great crisp/refresing IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Lothar666,4.23,"A- Head was white, creamy and a full finger thick. This was set atop a beautiful golden orange amber body that was very cloudy. A sticky white lacing is left on the rim of the glass as I drink.  S- Strong citrus- grapefruit, orange and a bit of lemon. Pine and hops tingle in the nose.  T- Very clean taste with a delightful hoppy flavor. The grapefruit and orange that was present in the nose makes its appearance here as well, though the most obvious flavors were pine and hops. A most delightful session IPA; one of the best.  M- The delightful hop tingle makes this a much better choice than most session IPA's I have had. The mouthfeel is very clean and dry without making any sacrifices in strong hop flavors. Absolutely excellent.  D- It would be very easy to drink and enjoy several of these, as the abundant hop flavor never gets tiring and leaves the mouth wanting for more once the first brew is finished.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BMan1113VR,4.13,"Beautiful beer, a hefty golden color. Just barely cloudy. Pours with a small rocky white head that goes completely away. Good lacing. Smell is heavy if not harshly hoppy with pine and grapefruit. Also a myriad of other smells, rasin, raspberry or cassis, apple, a little oak and some honey. extremely refreshing taste. Starts bitter and ends with a sweetish note (for an IPA). Average duration. Palate was light, dry, and a bit metallicy, but only enough to stimulate the senses, still a joy to take down. Soft carbonation, very enjoyable brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DIM,4.17,"a: This one is a slightly cloudy medium golden yellow. It pours with a big white head that has decent retention.  s: Smells of citric hops with a bit of pine as well. Some sweet malts also.  t: As expected, grapefruity hops dominate. I like the fact that the hops are allowed to shine without much malty interference.  m: Lively and sticky, very nice!  d: I'll stick to locals to ensure freshness, but this is a very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Lothore,4.39,"A- Pours a deep, clear orangey tangerine color with a fairly small white head, not very much carbonation visible.  S- Smell is floral piney hops with a sweet, bready malt backbone.  T- It's easy to say there is strong hops all the way through this one but it seems that it starts off with a strong malt base thats sweet with light fruit notes and an earthy fullness and moves into a bitter piney hop flavor. The hop bitterness lingers long after the brew has been swallowed.  M- Semi thick, a bit resiny, perfect amount of carbonation.  D- This is dangerously drinkable. It's not that the alcohol is particularly high but I think the dangerous part about it is it is so tasty and easily sessionable. I could go through a few of these without even blinking an eye.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,athensbeermaster,4.35,"This sticky lacing monster hangs around for the entire show. The aroma has big grapefruit,pine,and some herbal notes. The taste: big sting of hops that has multi levels of flavor like Grapefruit and lemon with a grassy/ herbal overtone.This fades into a sweet fruity backbone that can only fight off the brutal hop onslaught that rides to the finish. The funny thing is this IPA is just there entry level beer available in 6 pks.Can't wait to try there anniversary ales!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,atrus138,4.52,"Had this from a 22 oz bomber. Poured a clear light amber color with a fluffy looking snow white head. Very sticky lacing. Smell is extremely sweet. Lots of fruity smells. I detect strawberry over top of the citrus genre of lemon, orange, and pineapple. Taste is as delicious as it is complex. Very fruity at first, as the smell indicated. Citrusy and sweet. Then it's the malt's time to shine, with a delicious bready flavor. To top it all off is the satisfying finale of bitter hops. Quite a show! Mouthfeel is perfect. Medium body. Heavy enough for the flavor to stick around, but light enough for it to not be a burden. Not too carbonated. Very well done.  Seriously, even Stone's standard fare is amazing. One of the best IPAs I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerTaster,4.65,"Pours light amber in color clear with no haze. Smell pinny zesty and a bit of a floral hop aroma. Taste is exceptional a touch of sweetness with a nice grapfruit, pinny, bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel medium in body carbonation was modarate. Drinkability I could have more than one this could be a new favorite IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WillieMoe,4.17,"If I had to just list off the top of my head, my top 5 ipas, this would assuredly make the cut.  It pours a light amber color, not to thick or cloudy.  now upon taking a whiff of this one, you are not bombarded with the scent of hops. No, no, the aroma is actually rather subtle. A slight hint of citrus is also present in the smell.  Although the your nose is not blasted with hops, your mouth will be. There is that bit of citrus in there, but the hops are what you taste the most.  This is a delight to drink. Of course I am a lover of IPAs, but this is probably subtle enough for the casual IPA drinker as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cerveza5150,3.8,"I've been a fan of Stone Brewing Co. for a few years and everything I've had from them has been excellent. So here goes with the IPA:  An excellent ale through and through. Also, every bottle is fairly consistent. Lacing is present all the way down the glass, but the only knock I would give is that the head is a little soapy and didn't have that great retention. Other than that, a solid ale from a solid San Diego brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,yourefragile,4.01,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Sadly, probably my favorite part of this beer this time around. A clear golden amber with a bubbly white head that is very sticky and bunches up on the glass. Slight greenish tint around eges. S: Nice aroma of hops, slightly bitter. Light citrus and floral notes. Slightly thin however, at least from what I was expecting. T: Hop bitterness is first thing that hits and doesn't let up much throughout. Not the type that digs into the tongue or destroys the palate. Any pine, citrus or floral flavors are very subdued. Slight malt flavor to balance hops and finishes with a dry, grainy taste. M: Light carbonation, relatively smooth, medium body. Overall left with a slightly thin feeling, like the smell. D: A great IPA and standby on tap. Very strong hop flavor but very easy drinking. Alcohol isn't really detectable in taste but has pleasant warming effect. Personally, I prefer Two-Hearted over this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pirate252,4.69,"Appearance - On the lighter side of IPA's that I myself have seen, between a light and amber color.  Smell - Quite possibly the most wonderful smelling IPA I have had, smells like a hop garden.  Taste - Wonderful, absolutely wonderful, anyone who likes IPA's should have no trouble falling in love with this taste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Drinkabilty is almost where i think it could be better, and by better I mean I just wish I could drink more of it. It is so good but the strength of its taste and alcohol content keep me from being able to drink it all day long like I wish I could",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,largadeer,4.03,"Appearance - Bright, pale amber with great clarity. Pours with a modest 1/2 inch of foam, but retention is remarkably good - my glass held its head until the last drop.  Smell - Fresh, resiny hops from a mile away. Floral, herbaceous, succulent hops. This is one of the brews that got me into craft beer, and the amazing hop aroma was a big part of that - simply outstanding.  Taste - Lots of hop flavor, but relatively mild bitterness. Although Stone is known for their intensely bitter beers, this isn't one of them; it has more of a fresh and floral hop flavor, with a pleasantly mild bite. Malts take on a definite background role, providing a sweet-but-subtle platform for the hops to work their magic on.  Mouthfeel - Slightly oily; the finish leaves a coating hop residue on the palate, lingering but mellow.  Notes - It's been over a year since I last had this beer, and I had almost forgotten how great it is. I think it took drinking a number of average-to-mediocre IPAs for me to realize how incredibly well-crafted this one is. Simply a classic of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beeritron,4.57,"This is one of my current favorites. Stone IPA pours a golden color with a moderate white head about 3/4 inch thickness. A slightly hazy beer that leaves a consistent lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell punches your nose with nice, hoppy notes of pine and citrus. There is also a slight alcohol presence noticeable in the aroma. A sweet malt smell lingers at the beginning of the sniff followed by a lovely fresh hop aroma. The taste has a bite to it from the combo of hops and alcohol. It has a nice sweet, malty taste and a great bitterness on the back of the tongue. The hops are aggressive and the bitterness level is perfect. This medium bodied IPA has carbonation that sits on the tongue momentarily before dissipating. This, combined with the alcohol, creates a spiciness that leave the mouth tingling for several minutes. The drinkability is very high and leaves you wanting more. I, myself, could drink a million.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,elmore,4.3,"Poured from a 12oz into a snifter. Golden, carmel color. Nice 2 finger head with good retention. Good amounts of sticky lace left behind.  Smells of citrusy hops with a touch of sweet malt, but mostly hops.  The taste is also definitely about the hops. I really like the hops profile. Difficult to explain as the hops have a strong prescence, but at the same time are crisp and light, and don't linger too long. Not too resiny and over the top. Dry, clean after taste with minimal malt sweetness.  Medium mouthfeel for an IPA. Carbonation appropriate.  A very good IPA. Stong hops prescence with not a lot of sweetness and a crisp, clean, dry aftertaste make this a very sessionable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zdk9,4.04,"A- Pours a weak pale yellow/orange color. A finger of beautiful bubbly head gives way to some tear drop lacing.  S- A great strong smell of hops- tangerine, sweet lemon. In the background is some sweet malt as well that makes the beer smell of orange bread.  T- A hops forward beer, with a delicious hop profile. Despite that the bottle warned of overpowered bitterness, I'm finding the taste to be well balanced, with some biscuity carmely malt finding a place among the sweet citrus hops. Not too resinous or sweet.  M- A little light here, as was the color. I could do with some more body, or more interesting carbonation.  D- Overall this is a delicious beer that certainly displays the hops, but in a balanced atmosphere that I truly appreciate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hornet2003,3.87,"Appearance: Not as amber as I was expecting...More a dark yellow than anything.  Smell: Whoa hoppy. I was wanting to get kicked in the teeth with hops and Stone doesn't disappoint on the aroma front. All citrus. I imagine this is as close to essential hop oils as you can get in a 12 oz bottle. cascade, chinook, the like...  Taste: Bitter. Very beautiful grapefruit flavors that leave a resounding bitterness on the sides...More sweetness after the hops have had their say...Overall, however, very hop-forward.  Mouthfeel: Great. no complaints. Perfect amount of carbonation and there isn't a sticky mouthfeel that you get with some other IPA's.  Drinkability: The hops assault your taste buds such that 2 is the limit to truly appreciate the flavors in this beer. After that, give yourself a rest and wait until your tongue comes out of its coma. Also, the alcohol(6.9%) can get you if you aren't careful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MuenchenerKindl,4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a pint glass the liquid is a nice gold with good carbonation. I nice 2 finger head is white and leaves some lace.  The smell is a full floral hoppy aroma with a slight lightly toasted malt in the base.  The taste follows, real floral and earthy hoppyness, very nice.  The mouthfeel is good medium body and good carbonation.  Quite a nice drinking beer but surely not the bast IPA I have had.  Prosit MK",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Poured a golden orange color with a thick white head. Smell is of citrus hops and pine mixed with yeasty malt. Taste is well balanced hop bitterness profile with a little grapefruit and pine again. Mouthfeel is medium body with great carbonation. I can drink this beer forever, but the next day sometimes it feels like my intestine is going to explode after a binger of this IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,n0315,4.37,"I'll be honest, I love hops. If you're differnt than me, this review is not for you, nor is this beer.  Starts out with a nice amber color with a STRONG smell of hops, but not overpowering. Head sustains for a bit, a nice thick white head. The taste as ALL stone brews do knocks you off your feet. Others say there is good balance, I would not say GOOD, but decent. Hops is insane through from the time it touches your mouth until the finish. A strong brew thats turns out to be a great IPA. I'll drink one to it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Proteus93,4.26,"A: A beautiful amber, just shy of a two finger, pretty caramel head. Lots of lacing. A very nice looking brew.  S: This one packs a nose-full. Sharp & crisp, piney, maybe the slightest bit floral.  T: Hops galore. Bitter hops all the way down, pine, a touch woodsy and again the slightest floral taste, as well as smell. Finish seemed a touch buttery, though I didn't notice other mention of that. Quite nice.  M: Pretty much perfect for my palate... touch of carbonation on the tip of the tongue which compliments the hops flavour very nicely. Simmers to a light fizz over the tongue, allowing for a good swish to take in the taste... and smooth finish.  D: Very high, overall. I could see the hops becoming a little much, personally, but otherwise it's a very smooth and friendly drink. Definitely something I will be getting again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cdkrenz,4.15,"I was with family in fabulous Las Vegas and was able to sample this fine IPA. I was served in a bottle with no option for a glass. I was at the Red, White & Blue in the Mandalay Bay Casino and Hotel on the south end of the strip.  Appearance - The bottle is classic with the label panted straight on. The graphics are white and green.  Smell - The strong aroma of hops fills my nose with each subtle sniff.  Taste - They aren't kidding when they say this beer has hops. It's firm and tasty. I wish I could have enjoyed more than just one.  Mouthfeel - It goes down very well. The texture is smooth considering it being an IPA, which in my experience tends to lean toward a course feel.  ~ I wish I could get this beer in Wisconsin. If I could the brewery would be on my list of must hits after tasting what they did with this beer. Looks like I'll just have to take another trip to Vegas and bring home a sixer next time.  Enjoy WJVII.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bloberglawp,4.42,"HUGE thanks to jasonjlewis for this bottle!  Pour a hazy orange hued yellow, big white head and a fair good retention and nice lacing.  Aroma of hops, citrus hops, piny hops, spicy hops and hopy hops. Flavor seems quite balanced, a firm bitterness is quite present from the start but does not come off as harsh. Burping this ale is quite a pleaserable experience!  Yeah, I'd do this one again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,aerozeppl,4.55,22oz bomber into my Arrogant Bastard Pint Glass.  A: Orange copper color with 1 finger of white head. Tons of lacing.  S: Citrus (grapefruit) hits you at first. piny hops next. Malt is in the back.  T: Nice piny citrus taste. What I like about Stone's IPAs is the balance. This is not a death hop bomb. Not being a hophead I want something like this every once in a while. Very well done. One of my favorite IPAs.  M: Med body with a slightly syrupy feel. Totally coats the mouth and throat on the way down. Carbonation is on the light side but works.  D: Very drinkable. IN fact for an good IPA this is about as drinkable as you can get. At almost 7% you would have no idea. Another great Stone beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,illidurit,4.18,"On tap at Naja's.  Amber color with a 1 finger head of white foam. Lace is very sticky and dense.  Aroma is of hops hops and hops. Piney and herbal, raw.  Taste is predictably hoppy with pine and spicy notes. A dry leafy flavor comes through as well. Malt is barely detectable as a grainy bready note. Good balance between flavor and bitterness.  Medium body and carbonation, dry bitter finish. Pretty definitive west coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bboven,4.42,"Pale copper in color, painfully clear with carbonation shooting through the glass leading to a huge head that leaves tons of lacing.  Smell is citrusy hops with just a hint of the malt.  There's some good malt in the flavor for a nice semi-balance, but the hops are in the lead. What's nice about the hops is that they are complex. There are some tart, citric flavors as well as just enough bitterness at the end. Great stuff.  Mouthfeel is a little high on carbonation but nicely drying and just a tiny bit sticky to leave you some flavor.  I can't get this in NC but my in-laws live in TX, so I buy this every time I'm there. Great stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Less syrupy than many other IPA D: Very good example of the style,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WaveRebel51,4.72,"Kudos to Stone for creating such a fine tasting IPA. The beer looks and smells great, but the taste was the memorable and unique aspect of the beer. Well balanced and the hop flavors were both subtle and substantial, if that makes sense. You can definitely taste the hops, but not in an overwhelming manner. Definitely recommended drinking and not only to IPA fans.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ryanbob,4.77,"Appearance was deep, slightly cloudy orange. Nice head that lingers on the glass. Smell was fresh hoppy and bright. Taste was fresh popping citrus and hops, very balanced bitterness. Some malty, toasty flavors in the background. Hops settle down for a clean aftertaste. Nice creamy mouthfeel, the beer rolls around and feels smooth. Overall a very drinkable, distinct IPA on par with the best I have ever had. I would definately recommend this beer to others, even those who are not huge hops fans.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,TheodorHerzl,4.82,"Pours a light golden hue with a huge two fingered head that leaves sheets of lacing on my pint glass. A fantastic floral bouquet filled with scents of citrus fruit, sweet malt, and a second dose of grapefruit scent just to make sure you know the hops are in your face. It smells like I have fistfuls of hops cones. The taste is really impressive with the citrus, floral, sweet malt, and bold hop character playing off each other and never really dominating each other. The flavor profile just melts together on your palate and makes for a nice drinking experience. This beer is medium bodied with medium carbination. Alcohol is very well hidden and I didn't really ever notice it. This beer is highly drinkable and should be on the list to try for all hop lovers.  Well done Stone, and I award you with always having a sixer in my fridge of this tasty brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mattster,3.43,"Opened 12oz bottle and poured into pint glass.  Nice light golden brown color, somewhat hazy but still translucent. Very little head that dissipates quickly, light lacing on top.  Smell is hoppy, slight citrus notes. Taste is even hoppier, also with a good hints of citrus and a little spice.  Little aftertaste, pretty pleasant brew. After consuming most of the beer, I noticed that it was stamped ""enjoy by 12/11/07"" but I've had this brew before and didn't notice any major change. Generally, IPA's are made to last for longer periods of time. I feel comfortable saying that this brew would probably still taste good a month from now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Starts off slightly in citrus and delivers a high level of bitter into your mouth. Gets smoother as time goes on. Smooth, but a bit strong on the mouthfeel. Highly drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NJBeerFan,4.34,"Poured half the bottle (1 pt 6 oz) into a snifter glass.  Appearance - About a 1 inch head. The color was a dark gold - light amber. There were many little bubbles supporting the head, which maintained for most of the time it took me to finish my first glass.  Smell - Very hoppy smell. There was a slight piney smell. After my first ""whiff"" I expected the beer to be extremely bitter.  Taste - The hops were detectable upon tasting. However, the smell of the beer gave me the beer would be much more hoppy than it actually was. The hops were more present as an after taste than overpowering on the first sip.  Mouthfeel - Very refreshing and surprisingly smooth. The beer was carbonated well, but not overwhelmingly bubbly, making for a light taste.  Drinkability - Very drinkable. You will have to watch out with this one as the alcohol taste is not noticeable and you can slug a few of these back before it catches up to you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,peck95,4.54,"this beer pours a golden color reminiscent of a wheat beer. There is an excellent head and good retention. I love the aroma of this beer its a perfect blend of pine and citrus. hops, spices and a slight pineapple taste, very good a good body pretty smooth with a slight detection of alcohol there is a slight malty after taste that dissipates after several drinks, this beer also lingers in the mouth reminding the brain of how awesome this beer taste and forcing the drinker to take another drink and then causing sadness when this beer is all gone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Note: This one looks like ""pee"". I like my beers to look darker. Wish this one was just a HINT darker.  Smells of grassy,piney hops. Lots of pineapple smells in this one.  Tastes like the smell but the taste goes deeper. A nice hop bitter aftertaste. Lots of spice in this one. As Jason says...this one is zesty. Some alcohol burn in mid pallet through the swollow. Mouthfeel is about perfect. A little sweet and sticky but not over the top, the hop bitterness balances the sweet malts that taste like pineapple juice.  I love this Stone. I love all Stone brews. Great brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,czfreeman,4.4,"My first Stone Brew!! Im so excited. pours out to a golden straw color. Big fluffy head, long retention. The first thing I noticed was the piney hop scents that filled the room.

Ahh, the smell of hops invades the nose with a bittersweet complexity that makes the mouth water. The smell fades to a honey-like scent after a few sips. The taste is no secret, a bombartment of hops that come at you from all directions, but pleasantly. Strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Biting in the mouth so you remember it sip after wonderful sip.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dsa7783,4.03,"My first-ever brew from the famous Stone company... their big, bold, aggressive marketing style works really well, and after sampling their IPA, I must say it is full of flavor and strong character that really shows... Appearance was a nice bronze color with light carbonation visible... aroma was hoppy, tinged by a faint smell of caramel and vanilla... taste strongly complements the aroma, being a solid brew with a strong hop character... slightly bitter finish but definitely full of flavor and really robust... I am eager to try more brews from this company, as I was really impressed with their rendition of an IPA... a good, solid brew... Recommended...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tolann,3.69,A - Amber/blond in color with a white head that disappears quickly. Clear not hazy. Few bubbles of carbonation continue to slowly rise.  S - Soft piny hops.  T - Very nice pine hops. Almost too easy for an IPA. Not too sweet.  M - Bitterness hangs on the back of your tongue. Light-medium body. Not dry and not overly carbonated.  D - Pretty easy drinking. This would be a good session IPA,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,happybear,4.2,Have enjoyed this in bottle (live on East Coast) and on tap in San Diego. Excellent IPA with good balance and hop bite. Head disappears quickly and a good session beer for the experienced. A few in my party in San Diego had to stop at one and return to their yellow fizzy beers. Always a good pick on tap or bottle.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,genog,4.62,"12 oz bottle  Pours a golden color with a rocky 2 inch tall white head. After a few moments this head dies down and leaves a great deal of sticky icky clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is of hops, and hops! Plenty of citrus aroma making me want to dive right in. Taste does not disappoint with some pine and grapefruit flavors. Mouthfeeling is just carbonated enough to make this one bitter, yet crisp and refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tilley4,4.4,"Man, these guys know how to make beer. This is one fine IPA here.  Nice hazy golden color with a nice tight head and great lacing.  Yep, smells hoppy to me. Very hoppy.  This actually wasn't as hoppy as I thought it was going to be. I was looking for a little more in that dept. but this is still a great beer.  Is this the best IPA I've ever had? Hard to say. I tried the Rocky Mountain IPA the other day and it absolutely blew me away with a hoppy kick in the teeth that induced me to buy two sixers of it but this is still a good IPA that I will be revisiting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,phantomwyse,4,"A: Medium dark amber, like a light maple syrup. Thick frothy head that builds quickly and is gingerly in going away. Intense layered lacing.  S: Sweet pine, and here's my absurd connection for this one -- smells specifically like white pine. Citrus notes.  T: Bitter pine up front, dark citrus at the back of the palette. Even an earthy pine taste aftertaste. Where were these hops grown exactly? Well balanced overall. Very clean tasting.  M: Stable and slightly prickly.  D: Highly drinkable, but at the AVB, it'll catch up with you.  I'm a big IPA fan - and while I think this is excellent, it isn't as great as anticipated, although it's very refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NCSUdo,4.33,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle  A: Rather hazy golden under a fingers worth of white foamy head. Nice lace and retention.  S: Citrusy hops, grapefruit and lemon peel, some oranges. Overally aroma is nice but seems to disappear a little quickly.  T: A pretty ""smooth"" citrus quality that seems to be blend again of grapefruit and some lemon peel, slightly piney, bitterness is there but nothing overpowering. Finish is bitter with some grapefruit mixed in.  M/D: Light to medium body that is slightly watery. Carbonation is pretty high as well. Smooth and easy drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,barleywinefiend,4.42,"A bombardment of hops, sweetness and malt. What a beer!! The best IPA I have ever had and I have had over 100 easily.The only thing that touches this is Harmon IPA Tacoma. It literally was the best of the best. Poured golden, yellow a thin head, excellent stuff!!!I had this bottle and I can only imagine how it tasted on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,letsgopens,4.54,"One of the most flavorful yet well balanced IPAs I can recall. The cloudy, golden/orange body pours with a snow white cap of foam that recedes and leaves a thin but persistent ring of lace.  The aroma is incredibly appetizing and very well pronounced. Bright with tons of citrus and sticky, bitter hops. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and lots of fresh pine. Caramel malt and a bready goodness.  Lots of crisp, sweet citrus; again juicy orange and grapefruit. A distinct note of pine and spice. The hops are all other the place; pine, floral, big and bitter. They really blend in well with the caramel malt backbone. Buttery with lots of cereal graininess. Clean and refreshing. Rustles up thoughts of summer time. So well balanced and flavorful.  Medium bodied but super crisp and refreshing. This beer delivers the best of both worlds as far as an IPA is concerned. Bready malt with piny hops. Almost sticky sweet/bitter with crisp refreshment. So well put together. One of the best representations of the style there is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,champ103,4.35,"A: A clear copper amber color. Large, white, frothy head that leaves plenty of lace. S: Oh ya, very nice. Plenty of hops with a complex aroma of different citrus fruits. Also has a hint of malteness to it. T: Great, a wonderful balance between the hops and malt (something many breweries forget). There is enough hops to satisfy the hop heads, but enough malt to satisfy the malt heads (like me). M/D: Mouthfeel is very creamy. Just the right carbonation and it coats the mouth well. Easy enough to drink. It was a little bitter and dry, and the high ABV for the style shows.  I really enjoyed this beer. IPA's are not my favorite. I prefer lots of malt in my beer, but this was really exceptional. Great balance, and very flavorful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pmcadamis,4.12,"A - A three finger wall of solid and dense foam rises above a clear light amber brew. The head is so dense and massive, that it's hard to see the individual bubbles. It just looks like a solid mass of white. Tons of nice crystal lace is left on the glass, and the head shows outstanding retention.  S - Ridiculously oily and dank hops! This has a lot of resiny herbal marijuana notes going on in addition to grapefruit and perfumed pine forest aromas. Smells amazingly fresh, like a big old handful of fresh hops.  T - This is heavily malted underneath the forest if hop goodness. Again, hop oily resin and pot make up the main flavor profile, while a load of extremely bitter grapefruit juice with a spritz of lemon rind keep it a little fruity.  M - Medium bodied, oily, and finely carbonated with a really bitter finish that isn't really dry at all.  D - Good. This is a pretty nice IPA, but I don't think that I like it as much as some other reviewers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jedimaster1,4.42,"12oz bottle poured into a Pawtucket Patriot Ale novelty pint glass :)  A: A picturesque golden copper with plenty of bubbles rising to its surface. It also has a soapy white head that dissipates as it is consumed.  S: Hops! Hops! And more Hops! The smell of hops whiffs through the space with a bit of malt to back it up.  T: What can I say. This thing is a wonderful explosion of hops upfront with a bit of malt sweetness to back it up. The hops are not overwhelming, but well balanced for this brew. It is definitely at the forefront and yelling to be heard. But it is not without complexity. A sweet malty citrus sweetness resonates at the end of every sip.  M: This is one smooth beer. There is a little lingering bitterness, but this is a good thing. Plus the hoppy burps make this one a gift that keeps on giving. Well carbonated as well.  D: Although it is 6.9% ABV, this is my session beer of choice. And did I say that it is uber smooth? ;)  This is the quintessential West Coast IPA. A brilliant brew. This is an example of why Stone is one of the utmost brewers in the nation. Great brew and highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Doomcifer,4.4,"Pours a bright golden color, pretty clear. Decent head leaves some lacing on glass. Smells very piney, some grapefruit, very floral and sweet smelling. Taste is extremely balanced. Piney, grapefruit notes, very hoppy balanced out by lightly sweet malts, citrusy....terrific. Great mouthfeel. Ridiculously drinkable. Immensely!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Traquairlover,4.32,"12-oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A = Clear, golden color. Small head, Medium amount of lacing.  S = Hops, white pepper, grapefruit.  T = More complex than I expected, pine flavors at first but they quickly give way to more complex citrus flavors followed by a more mellow malt, but finishing with a good bitterness and return of the hops flavors.  M = Medium to light body, good carbonation.  D = A very good choice for an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ifixufly,4.2,"Crisp, golden color that pours with a tight head that lingers into a light lace on the glass. Excellent overhopped smell and taste. No lingering aftertaste. Awesome beer for just about anything and anytime. I would recommend this beer to anyone that is able to take on a strong hoppy brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jkrich,4.62,"12 oz bottle with ""enjoy by 12/23/07"" stamped in very small print around the base of the bottle. The etching artwork of the gargoyle certainly gains your attention. The best by date should be more prominent.  This ipa poured a clear, golden color with a small, dissipating head that left nice lacing on the side of the conic glass.  When I opened the bottle, the smell of northwest, piney hops burst from the bottle and continued as I poured the ale into the glass. I thought I was smelling a Christmas tree.  With all of that superior hop flavor, the beer tasted incredibly balanced. Yes, the flavor of spicy hops dominated throughout, but the slightly sweet malt in the background certainly balanced everything nicely. I could still taste the hops on my tongue well after the first taste.  The ale was medium bodied with strong carbonation.  It is somewhat difficult to believe this ipa is 6.9% ABV; it is extremely drinkable. If not for the high ABV, this would be the ultimate session ale.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JohnGalt1,4.32,"12oz at the Boise Coop for ~$1.50... enjoyed out of a shaker pint... still listening to Digweed's Transitions V.3.  Shorter egg shell head that fades to good sticky lacing.... a nice mess of bubbles floats atop a clear straw color body... BTW... big lacing left for the entire glass.  Very noticeable American hops burst from the glass... pine... pineapple and grapefruit... with an endearing flowery portion. Not alot of maltiness to take note of, but thats probably not a bad thing on this one.  Flavor is off the charts!! big bitterness melts seamlessly into the mix of low sweetness and American hop notes.. Actually very hard to pick apart because it is so balanced. Yeasty fruitiness is definately there... Body is lite medium with prickly carbonation... but yummy.  I've had this brew dozens of times ... but never really thought to stop and savor... this is what people are talking about when they say West Coast IPA. Fantastic and remarkably drinkable... I really like bitter beers for the most part, but for some reason, my purchases tend to linger in the bigger body/maltiness range.... but Stone has this one perfected.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Durge,4.15,"A light golden brown brew with a thick white head and substantial lacing. An aroma of caramel and sweet pine hops, very appetizing. This is tastey stuff with a bitter hops base that is streaked with candied malt. It has a fine carbonation and a nice full bodied feel.. It's easy drinking but fairly heavily hopped with pine and there is a notable alcohol, but I find it to be a great blend. Another top notch effort from Stone!! IPA lovers definitely will need to try this one and should be pleased.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kwakwhore,4.23,"Clear golden pour with a tiny white head. Small bits of lacing down the glass. Exceptional clarity in this beer. Aromas are all about pine and hops. Not much else sneaks through. The flavors are bracingly bitter. A real hop bomb with some bready malts sneaking through once in a while. The mouthfeel is dominated by a refreshing spritzy carbonation. This is a refreshing beer, easy to drink. 6.9% is well hidden. I got one of these via trade(thanks to jcdiflorio), but I could easily have had another. This is a beautifully done IPA. If I had to pick one beer as an example of a west coast IPA, this is the one I'd choose.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SargeC,4.48,"Appearance: Powerful, hazy gold color with a frothy and rugged manila colored head.  Smell: Pungent hop aromas that include hints of flowers, citrus and pine.  Taste: The hoppiness is less than expected. But, the hop flavor is bold and set the brew apart from others. The complex hop flavors sit atop a nice clean malt base.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Perfect balance of dryness for an IPA.  Drinkability: Excellent IPA. Bold and hoppy, but maintains accessibility and drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,xare,4.32,"I'm sure I've had this beer before but I just never wrote it down or recorded my thoughts on it. Appears to be a hazy light orange color with a white head that goes away pretty fast.  Smells like pine needles and hops, which is actually quite pleasing. The taste is that of spicy hops, pine needles, and citrus scents combined to create this odd amalgamation of flavors.  Definitely has one of the best mouthfeels I've ever experienced, especially for an IPA. Goes down smooth but still pokes at you on its way down. Quite easy to drink but for some reason it doesn't feel very drinkable. I'll give it another try and see if the drinkability improves at another time.  Overall, this is an excellent IPA and one that I would definitely drink a lot of if I could acquire a stash of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mnstorm99,3.92,"22 oz. bomber Pours a nice cloudy orange with a small head that seemed to dissipate, but it did leave a little lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops and a nice malt backbone. Taste was of honey and carmel biscuits, the malt profile was great. I wasn't overwhealmed by the mix of pine, citrus and the floral flavors from the hops, I like the attempt at the complexity, but the complexity came through better in the malt. Great creamy mouthfeel, smooth and well carbonated. I could definatly drink one of these every so often, just not my favorite as the style goes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rxdrewthejew,4,"A: Slightly hazy, amber with more orange tinge in the middle. A bubbly one finger head leaving a bit of film and plenty of lacing.  S: Plenty of Stone's trademark citrus and floral hops.  T: The taste is well balanced with floral and citrus as well as a touch of sweetness, but finishes with a strong bitter blast as it moves towards the back of your tongue. Good balance but enough kick to please the hop lovers.  MF: Smooth and crisp with a mild carbonation bite. Well masked alcohol. Somewhat dry and the bitterness hangs around for quite some time.  D: I'm still more partial to their Tuination IPA, but this is clearly an IPA for hopheads. The hops aren't overpowering, though, so this can be enjoyed by all. This beer is better in the summer as it's quite refreshing, but with it being as cold as it is, maybe time to put it away for the winter...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mhaugan,4.3,"I have had this beer a ton but never reviewed it. This past weekend I went to King's Fish House at the Tempe Marketplace and was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap. Came in a shaker pint that had not been frozen before filling. The color is a light amber, not as rich as say a DIPA but nor should it. The aroma is hoppy, flowery and slightly herbal. The flavor is somewhat sweet along with citrus and hops. The drinkability is wonderful for an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,drseamus,4.47,"The body is a very amber, almost orange color. It was topped with a white head that fell quickly. The body isn't perfectly clear but is extremely bright. The aroma is filled with pine, citrus, and malt, exactly like a west coast IPA should be. The flavor is pretty heavy with pine and backed up with citrus. I personally prefer the citrus to dominate the pine but this is good. The balance in this beer is perfect. This is a classic west coast IPA everything is great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,blaje,4.12,"22oz bottle. Perfect serving for apprciation. Look: Golden yellow, small head after pooring. Disapered in two minutes. Nose: trong pine and citrus.

147,88,hiikeeba,3.87,"A-Pours up yellow gold with a creamy head. It is a bit hazy. S - Piney hops are pronounced, but not overwhelming T - Starts off with a bit of malt sweetness, swiftly replaced with hop bitterness that finishes at the back of the throat. Nice balance. M - Moderately full bodied, thanks to the carbonation. D - A very well made beer that could blow out your palate after three or so. But a 22 oz bottle is a perfect serving.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Riggsy,4,12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass.  Appearance: Pours clear and golden in color with a small but fluffy white head.  Smell: Pine and citrus hop aromas dominate the nose.  Taste: First taste is all citrusy hops. As the beer settles some malt backs up the bitterness and finishes with a sharp hop bite.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Drinkable and not overbearing. This is probably the standard for an American IPA,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jbphoto88,3.8,"Not a bad ipa but also not an amazing one. Everything is here but its not knock your socks off good. The color is warm golden tint with a nice thick head. The smell is citrusy and a little hoppy but not very heavy or offensive. The taste is layered, starting with mild citrus and ending with that typical IPA hops and bitterness. A good combination but nothing fantastic. Better then most IPA's but not the best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,orangedive,4.28,"Appearance - Coppery-gold. As clear as a top quality flat-screen TV.  Smell - Good. Hoppy. A little hint of citrus but the hops overpower most of it.  Taste - Excellent. It's incredibly balanced. I'm getting a little hint of coffee and more citrus than from the smell. A perfect amount of bitterness and hops. I could give this beer to my girlfriend confident it wouldn't crush her with bitterness. But the bitterness is still there--just very subtly.  Mouthfeel - Velvety smooth. Great. Can't think of better adjectives to describe the mouthfeel. Wonderful. Soft. Gentle but firm with my tastebuds--excellent.  Drinkability - If it weren't for the strong hop flavor, I would swear this is a ""session"" beer. Very easy to drink. Dangerously easy to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Overlord,4.25,"I can't believe I never got around to reviewing this, what I consider to be my ""baseline"" IPA, until now.  Pours a coppery orange/amber color. Two inch white head. Smells of pine, citrus, and maybe a hint of floral.  Taste is largely hops, with some sweeter citrus flavors mixed in, a bit of pine, and just a tad of malt. Not nearly as malty as most DIPAs, or even other nearby breweries offerings (wipeout IPA comes to mind).  Delicious, always refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zerofear13,4.52,"Grabbed this bottle from Community Beverage in Queens. They don't have too many Stone's, so I grabbed whatever I could. This brew poured into a pint glass a very murky copper gold, with a nice one and a half inch thick head. The head was very foamy and creamy, not just bubbly air. The brew itself does not look too appetizing, however, it smells wonderful. Smells of delicious hops, malts, and maybe fruits. The taste is heavenly. Not nearly as bitter and unbearable as other ""strong IPAs."" Great balance of hops and malts, and fruit notes. And the feel, it is wonderfully velvety smooth. Overall, if this were more readily available, I'd be on it all day. Easily one of the best brews I've ever tasted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Opethsprite,3.93,"This beer is a medium cloudy honey color in the glass, but without much of a head. It smells of citrus, alcohol, hops, and apricot. It's a pleasant, fresh smell. It tastes crisp and properly-balanced in terms of hops and fades to a sweet flavor alluding to the complex makeup. It's pretty dense in mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a good beer, and nicely exemplifies this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wheelinshirt,3.78,"Had what i think was an older bottle, enjoy by date was barely readable, i think it said 7/02/07. Color was a beautifully clear amber gold with thick creamy white head that laced the glass very well. Not really much smell as the hops have diminished over time. Taste was good and hoppy, grassy and piney but balanced by the sweetness of the malt. As badass as Stone tries to be, this beer is obviously well crafted and beautifully balanced. Body was medium and carbonation was just right, slid right down the throat. Could drink a couple of these, will definately re-review again with a fresher bottle to really experience the hop-punch-in-the-face smell.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,metallistout,4.5,"22oz bottle. Love the stencils on Stone bottles.  Pours an amber color with a nice thick head.  Smells very hoppy, like a botanical garden or something.  Probably one of the strongest (in a good way) IPA's I have tasted. Damn good. I have had The RUINATION, and that is a little stonger, but not by much.  This beer is not for a beginner. If you do not like hops, or even like beers with medium hop character then stay away. This is only for the people with the craving for a well hopped beverage, which includes me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,schoolboy,4.38,"Lately I've started to shy away from some of the IPA's in favor of more American IPA's. I think this one straddles the genres. I had previously sampled a big bottle or two of this very nice brew, but last night at Wilberts in Cleveland it was the best thing going off their taps. Thanks to a very enthusiastic waitress who kept them coming, I remembered the excessive quantity of these I drank all day today.  They go down easy for an IPA (like I said, lately they bite too much). The creaminess of the bottle was better balanced on the tap version. Very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,deanhead,4.2,"Appearance- Brilliant straw color, exceptionally clear and clean looking beer. pours an immense white head that quickly receded to one finger. The head clung for life to the sides of my pint glass.  Smell- Grapefruit, with some hints of pine, and alcohol.  Taste-Citrusy, dank, and bitter, yet not overwhelming. Nice dry finish. Very well balance malt backbone to compliment the hops, or perhaps the other way around. At any rate this beer tastes great.  Mouthfeel- light to medium Mouthfeel, very smooth beer.  Drinkability- this beer is dangerously quaffable. Too high of an abv to be a session beer, but surely drinks like a session beer. I'd love to keep a stash of this in the fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,littleshamrocks,4,"12 oz brown bottle with the enjoy by date barely readable on the bottom of the front of the bottle. Served in an imperial pint glass.  Pours a medium amber color with a decent sized foamy, white head. Clarity is somewhat hazy with good carbonation that you have to look very closely to see. Head is mostly diminishing, leaving a thin ring on top and streaky lace down the glass. The aroma is mostly hops, ranging from piney to grassy to citrusy and lesser scents of grainy-bready-biscuity malt. Taste is what you would expect from the smell. Mostly dominated by floral, pine, and grapefruit hop bitterness, with enough of a moderate malt backbone to help with balancing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very juicy, with lively carbonation and a lingering, chalky, slightly astringent finish.  Overall, this is a tasty, very good example of an American IPA. Some say that American brewers take classic styles an push them too far. I like the fact that Stone specifically set out to make an over the top, not very well balanced, beer with no apologies. Hopheads, this is a brew for you, and I would gladly have many more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,biboergosum,4.42,"22oz bottle, procured off-ramp somewhere in Idaho or Washington last month.  This beer appears a lot lighter in the glass then I had expected, but was still a nice clear, pale golden amber colour, with two healthy fingers of a puffy, foamy, and cloud-like creamy head, which leaves some spectacular coated lacing around the glass, almost to where it was opaque - cool.  Smell, oh, the smell - white grapefruit and navel orange citrus, acridly leafy and piney hops, all duly in attendance, right where they should be, alongside a gritty crackery, caramelized malt, um 'sweetness'. The taste follows through in concert, as the bitterness ramps it up a notch or ten, the pine outweighing the citrus for the most part, a bit of sour lemon arriving on the scene, and the maltiness playing the stunned post-apocalyptic shock victim.  Stone IPA displays a firm and taught body, nicely balanced, with sufficiently fizzy carbonation, and finishes near-dead dry - oh, and can an IPA such as this be called silky smooth? I put forth exhibit A in the affirmative, without really understanding why.  Wow. There are very few (ok, no, really) similar offerings to compare this to in my neck of the woods, so I feel like I've been enlightened, or something. The biggest thing I take away from this experience, however, is that I bought this at a Yoke's in Kennewick, Washington, during a recent wine country tour, and they even sell this stuff in gas stations south of the 49th - lucky freaking Yanks.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cbrakel,4.7,"Recently, this has been my default IPA.  While I miss the IPA by Smuttynose (not available in Southern California), this beer by Stone has provided a good alternative, along with their Ruination IPA.  The Stone IPA is very hoppy, with citrus (grapefruit) accents, and a well-balanced overall taste and mouthfeel.  Slightly bitter, as I expect from a good IPA, but a great overall taste, and pleasant aftertaste.  If you drink this often or exclusively, be prepared to be disappointed by the so-called ""standard"" beers! ;-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,twade,5,"Great IPA.It was a suggestion from a bartender at a great place in Boyertown Pa. called union jack's.It's down a dirt road and you would never expect it to be there.They have over 250 bottled beers and 25 or so on tap.I have had alot of great IPA's at this place ,but stone is my favorite.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ryan4,4.39,"This IPA has a very floral scent that is quite pleasent. At first drink this beer seems a little more carbonated than most IPAs I have had. Not lacking any taste, but certainly not too overpowering, it is very refreshing and is extremely drinkable. I definately recommened this as an everyday IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bunnyhustle,4.16,"Poured from bomber into pint glass. First thing I notice is the color, a crystal-clear golden orange. Excellent thick head with great retention, leaves behind tons of lace. Almost ""ring like"" as each sip it takes there is a ring left to mark the previous level. Smell is of piney hops (cant distinguish much more with a slight sinus issue). Taste is terriffic. One of the best IPA's I've had. Hard hitting hops, piney and crisp. Smooth going down and leaves a bitter and dry aftertaste. Also something I really havent noticed in some other IPA's which I guess must be the hop oil. A somewhat ""slick"" feeling present as well. Good carbonation leads to a light mouthfeel making this an easy drinker. Overall a great beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BigJTrucker,4.69,"Pours a surprisingly clear amber/orange color, with a nice thick head that settles rather slowly to leave behind a well defined lace on the glass. Smell is very hoppy, with equal parts citrus and pine. Most balanced aroma i can recall. Taste is faint citrusy hops, along with a sweet finish, pineapple perhaps? Hmm.... Mouthfeel is likewise excellent, very smooth, slightly sticky finish, not an obscene amount of aftertaste. Goes down way too easy. Before i knew it it was gone. Wow! Well done Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jmamay22,3.92,"The bottle (since the local bar no longer carries this on tap) sports the typical Stone arrogance and poetic comedy defining a gargoyle, an IPA and their philosophy.  Vigorous pour into a tulip glass produces a large creamy off white colored head that rests above a clear pale orange beer. Nice thick lacing, too.  Smells of citric grapefruit like hops. These hops are large and in charge and nothing else really comes into play, except for a lingering impression of a faint sweetness lurking in the background.  Tastes less hoppy than I remember on tap and the hops seem to fade instead of biting back at the finish. Grapefruit hints are there and its definetly for hop fans, but I recall this being better on tap.  Mouthfeel is medium to thin and the carbonation serves the hop oils nicely. Drinkability is great even if the abv is on the higher end for single IPAs. Enjoyable, but look for this on tap where I feel it would be better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheIPAHunter,4.82,"glorious 12 oz. presentation that's ultimately defined by its etching, in a standard format. once poured, an enviable copper consumes the glass topped off by two-finger head. retention is way above average w/ patterns of lacing marking their territory throughout the enjoyment. substantial effort was put into this offering.  hybrid of pine and citrus takes center stage. soft hints of floral spices linger in the background. this is the smell i often dreamed would result after a summer rainstorm. insane.  one of the most balanced tastes for IPAs to date. everything was measured w/ precision and it shows, better yet tastes, in this first-rate offering from stone. hops speak volumes as they should; the malt is sweet, not overbearing, yet the perfect compliment. balance is the operative term when summing up this IPA.  my mouth underwent a massage. the palate is pleased by an unparalleled texture, low carbonation and residual finish.  one of the best IPAs i have had and deserves any accolades bestowed present or future. hops aren't as complex as i would prefer, but i can't complain about a beer that defines balance and registers perfect enough to the taste, that it demands to be consumed all night long.  an elite IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hustlesworth,4.9,"i'm not gonna glorify this any more than i have to. the best IPA i've ever had. '06 vintage.  A- 1 1/2in off white creamy chunky build-able foam has great retention settling to 1/4in disc leaving lots of sticky lace in waves and tabby cat spots and stripes over the hazy vibrant orange apricot colored elixir.  S- bready and sweet with spicy fruity citrus and tropical notes, starfruit, guava, mango, melon, and banana come to mind. the best part is the milky toffee cream marshmallow in the thick dense aroma. it's unlike anything i've ever imagined.  T- bittersweet citrus, grapefruit herbal pine, orange cream with a tropical tart cranberry splash, grains, cashew, aromatic wood, lightly toasted malt, earthy meaty spiced pork, pine sap, and a warm creamy fruity buttery bakery fresh yum. this is way too complex, i believe it exceeds that arrogant bastard. herbal lemon pineapple resinous hop aftertaste lingers for a while before transforming into a smooth cured tobacco dryness that doesn't go away. perfectly blended and full of character.  MF- soft and creamy and silky smooth, medium carbonation, like a beautiful goddess is making love to my face.  D- the only things that would stop me from drinking this exclusively are: 1) availability 2) i still wanna try everything possible 3) i wouldn't wanna ""get used to"" the subtleties and amazing nuances this shit has got goin on let's have a round of applause for STONE (again) everybody.  EDIT: i dug another one out of my secret stash, this one has the date 21.1.05 debossed into the bottle so that makes it 3 years old! math! head was less vigorous, made about 1/2in settles fast but left alot of lace. where's it come from? same marshmallow milky toffee fruity hop aroma, but in the taste hops are more subdued, but much more developed and complex. as are the malts but the hops are the star from start to the long dry finish. cocoa butter sandalwood tropical fruit and alcohol! i really hop i can find some more of this shit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cichief,4.1,"Had on draft at Frisco's Grille & Cantina, Columbia, MD.  A- Pours a deep gold with a thick snow-white head of foam.  S- very floral hop aroma, citrusy, and inviting. A true West Coast IPA through and through.  T- Very refreshing, a very strong citrus-grapefruit flavor the hops are strong, but not astringent. Overall, very well balanced.  M- Medium to thin in body, well carbonated.  D- A fresh, hoppy beer, that is a welcome flavor. The alcohol and flavor aren't so strong as to prevent enjoying this beer all evening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBierBand,4.37,"Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass to form a perfect 1"" white head over a clear golden beer. The head stayed around and left very pronounced lacing all the way down the glass.  The aroma was VERY NICE!.... definately a nice floral hoppy smell with some nice malt to balance.  The taste was milder than expected.... of course it's no RUINATION... It was still nice and flavorful with a hoppy tinge nicely balanced by a toasted malt. There was also a bit of a tangy citrus to add to the complexity.  The mouthfeel was thinner than expected. Appropriate carbonation and a smooth feel to this beer.  Drinkability: Well, I was left wanting more.... I only bought a single 12oz. just to try it.... But this would be good all day long. I do prefer the DOUBLE IPA of Ruination though...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kenito799,4.72,"20oz pint poured ice cold at Suspenders, NYC Financial District.  In a frosty pint glass, I couldnt get a great look at this beer but the peachy amber color with rocky head looked nice. Lacing down the glass.  Wonderfully floral and sweet aroma wafted towards me, despite the overchilledness. As it warmed some (it was too good for me to let it last long enough to really get warm), the aromas became more complex, yeasty, fruity, piney, and a touch funky.  This beer is definitely in the running for my favorite American IPA. It is a kaleidoscope of flavor, all manner of hoppy bitter fruity piney flavors, balanced from start to finish with just the right note of sweetness...this is not a sweet beer by any means. It is a fabulously flavorful bitter beer. But sweet notes peek in just when they are needed to provide the perfect balance. Insanely drinkable. Now I know exactly what to drink when I am on Wall St.  Edit: From a bottle the promise is upheld. Notes I didn't mention: the fruit is definitely pineapple and grapefruit. Fantastic beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jockstrappy,4,"Pours a bright transparent copper color, with a fluffy off-white head that leaves a generous lace behind all the way to the bottom. Big floral hop aroma pretty much tells the story here....yep, it's an IPA. Taste begins with a subtle buttery malt flavor, followed by a serious rush of evergreen and floral hop flavors. Very crisp and to-the-point....no dickin' around here. As another BA noted before, the hop bitterness is very prominent at first, but fades quickly as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is a little sticky, with a hop aftertaste that lingers for quite a while...just keeps you sippin' away. I could drink this all damn night! Great IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PhageLab,3.93,"12oz single bottle. As always the flavorful text on the bottle is a must read. Features a definition for not only a gargoyle but the beer itself as well.  A - Very pleasing to the eyes, a glowing golden hue with hints of orange. Just a fingertip of head that rides all the way down. Nice lacing as well.  S - A lot going on here, almost too much for my sense of smell. The hops profile is ever-present, and comes off quite citrus-like.  T - It is entirely impossible to taste everything in one sip. Each time I can detect a different profile shining through, and the bitter characteristics fade as it warms up. Too bad I only purchased one! The complexity of this brew deserves more than one downing.  M - Very sharp, and yes, crisp. Body is medium/heavy, and fits the taste profile perfectly.  D - Quite well I'd say, I could definitely use another. I will revisit this one rather soon I can tell, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,snpub540,4.12,Poured almost orange hue with a clingy white head. It was a little hazy and had just the right amount of carbonation.  The smell was all hops just the way an IPA should be. Citrus and grassy aromas were dominant in this one.  The tasts was amazing. Grapefruit and pine were the main hop flavors. There was a dry and bitter finish that just makes you take another drink. There was a nice malty backbone to hold up to the hops and it was very balanced.  I could see this beer being a session IPA. It is not overly hoppy and the alcohol is subdued. This is my favorite example of an IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gallagherman,4.5,"I poured this from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass and had a golden hue - a bit lighter in color than I had expected. The head was about one finger thick and remained intact for some time. It smelled great, like citrus, and the hoppy aroma imparted a fresh, spring like quality. The taste is truly exceptional. A perfect balance of bittering hops and flavoring hops make this one of the best examples of an American IPA. Hoppy! The drinkability is great and could easily be a quenching session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brad007,4.47,Pours a medium golden color with a small head and some lacing. Aroma is nice and strong with hints of grapefruit and floral notes. Taste is nice and hoppy upfront with the aftertaste being one of grapefruit. Really nice aftertaste that is not too dry or bitter. Malty too as well. Very smooth and well-balanced. Goes well with the pizza I'm eating. Definitely one of the better IPAs I've had.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sessycuban,4.94,"Another Stone favorite that I've never bothered to review until now. 12oz bottle poured into my Stone IPA glass.  A - The beer pours a medium golden color. It is a little bit above standard for an IPA, with fluffy head and great lacing.  S - I'm getting pine, citrus, grapefruit especially, floral hops, and even caramel. This pretty much has everything one would want in an American IPA.  T - Wonderful! Hops, hops, hops. Lots of citrus with some carmel sweetness. The beer finishes slightly minty, with plenty of lingering bitterness. Very good.  M - The beer is medium bodied. You can either make this one a sipper or a swiller; it is very versatile.  D - This beer is incredibly drinkable. I, for one, am very happy that Stone decided to sell these in sixers. One of Stone's finest brews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mindsquall,4.79,"This poured a slightly cloudy orange with a finger thick head, lots of lacing. Smell is a hop bomb, a little piney with a touch of grapefruit. The grapefruit is prevelant in the taste, with a slight malty hint in the aftertaste, very tasty. Strangely this brew is actually refreshing and enjoyable to drink which is unusual for heavily hopped brews.  I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and will get more on my next trip south.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,John_M,4.23,"Had a glass of this on draft at Max's the other night.  The beer pours a solid orange color with a very creamy, persistent white head. The beer has very good head retention and excellent lacing. On the nose one gets a lovely aroma of orange citrus with just a hint of ginger in the background. This smells very, very nice. On the palate I immediately think ""West Coast"" IPA. The beer has very nice orange citrus with above average bitterness in the finish. The beer is not overly sweet, and the finish is light and fairly dry. The beer comes across as light, crisp and refreshing, just the sort of IPA you could sit down and pound a couple of pints. The beer has a nice mouthfeel, coming across as light and airy.... the finish is just seamless. Abv. is very unobtrusive, though you know the alcohol is there. Drinkability is quite good.  This is a very solid IPA.  Edit from 12/12. Tasted again recently at Piper's pub and Smokin Joe's in Pittsburgh, and as it has been over 5 years since I reviewed this beer, I figured an update was in order. What amazes me about this beer, is how consistently good it is. Even 2000 miles from where it was made, this beer was light, crisp, slightly tropical, yet refreshingly dry and bitter. This is a beer that is easy to take for granted (especially given all the other great beers Stone makes), but it's really something pretty special. Just an altogether excellent, well made IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MaltyGoodness,4.28,"22oz. bottle  Pours a clear golden color with a creamy white head that maintains. Nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma is loaded with citrusy hops with a slight grassiness.No malt smells detected. Smells very fresh.  Bold citrusy hop flavor, with just a slight grassiness. Medium bitterness, very restrained bite - very balanced bittering. No real malt character to speak of, but the delicious hop flavor stands on it's own quite well. Very fresh tasting.  Rather light body, well carbonated.  A very nice IPA overall, and another winner from Stone. Completely sessionable, this beer really showcases a bold use of flavoring hops while maintaining balance in bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pwoods,4.97,"On-Tap at Dilly Deli poured into a pint. Reviews based off notes.  A: Pours golden orange and coppery. 1+ finger head that reduces and stays at about a 1/4 inch. Patchy lacing.  S: Strong floral hops and fresh piney scent. Makes my mouth water thinking about whats coming. Alcohol stays hidden nicely. Slight nutty malt aroma peeks through toward the end.  T/M: Strong peppery spices and amazing hop bitterness. I love this in bottles but its AMAZING on top. Getting a piney/sappy bite. Nutty, buttery malts show their face just before the end. Medium body that turns slightly creamy at the malts and finishes bone dry.  D: If I hadn't had a big lunch, I would probably have to stop after 2 or so, but I could really drink this for quite awhile before experiencing palate fatigue. Extremely tasty and easy to drink. Without a doubt one of my favor brews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lackenhauser,4.45,Great golden color-somewhat on the darker side of gold. Nice white head on top with some great lacing on down the glass. Big aroma of fresh cut grass and grapefruit. Huge hop blast of flavor. Definate tongue stripping sensation here. Just a touch of sweetness to balance the hops. Great mouthfeel. Terriffic beer overall. I think this might shape up better then the Ruination for overall drinkability. Great beer-well balanced.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,evolbob,4.8,"I've longed for Stone for some time. An unexpected business trip to San Francisco gave me the opportunity to pick up the IPA and a couple of other Stone brews from BevMo to bring back to Georgia and enjoy. Enjoy I am! Poured from a 22 oz brown bottle, with the cool Gargoyle that ""wards off modern day evil spirits"" painted on bottle, into my new Sam Adams glass. This IPA is one outstanding brew for my taste. The hops are there but do not over-power my palate. The brew has the expected floral, grapefruit impact one would expect from an IPA. Do not have the lingering bitter taste and oily mouth-feel that I sometimes experience with other beers of the same type. The alcohol is faintly noticeable but masked well. Everything that I have read about Stone is true! I could drink this magnificent brew until I fell off the couch! Wish I had more than 2 bottles of the IPA ;( Wish I could get this in Georgia!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bluejacket74,4.38,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark gold color with not quite an inch of white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and hoppy (but not strong), mainly citrus (grapefruit and lemon peel) and piney hops, with a bit of malty sweetness too. To me it tastes the same way it smells, mostly citrus and pine hops with some malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and a bit slick. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's smooth and has just the right amount of carbonation to make this very easy to drink. I think this is a very solid beer, I'll definitely have to buy it more often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,irishkyle21,4.7,"All I have to say is I should have bought more than a six pack. This is one hell of a beer. It pours a light hazy peach color, great lacing while the head just sits above the brew like a crocodile stalking its prey above the water ( I just finished watching The Crocodile Hunter).  After a few whiffs of this IPA I know I'm in for something special. Lots of fruits ( citrus/grapefruit the most noticeable), some sweetness but it blends well.  The taste is just amazing I wish we could get a micro in Ontario to start brewing something along the lines of a solid IPA ( I know we do have some good micros and beers but comparing them is like comparing the CFL and the NFL). My palate picks up a piney, citrusy hop quality followed up by a sweet malt presence and a bitter finish ( not the most bitter finish out there but still your gonna feel the IPA bite).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OKCNittany,4.26,"from the Yellowstone/Boise notes (still)  A: Clear amber body. Huge, off white head with great retention & lacing.  S: Nice hoppy aroma. Could have been stronger, but very good anyway.  T: Wonderfully hoppy flavor - bitter and tart (all in a good way). It's a good thing this was the last beer of the night because my palate needs the recovery time. Despite all the hops, there's more than enough malt sweetness for balance. Fruity too.  M: Excellent mouthfeel - much fuller body than most IPAs and very smooth.  D: Dangerously easy to drink for 6.9% abv. Top notch beer. Suddenly all the bragging on the back of the bottle seems warranted. If you're a hop-head, this is hard to top.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Overall a very nice IPA, may be the best one Ive had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Ungespundet,4.4,"Thanks to Hotterthanhell for this bottle that made its way to München, Deutschland. It brought back nice memories of brewing in Texas. Pale ales in all varieties are a matter of taste and with every fly-by-night brewery trying to out do the next with more hops or gimmicks, I find it refreshing to drink an excellent example that is consistent and has proven staying power. I dont doubt that there are better pales in the U.S. but I could live with this one and never really complain. Unfortunately, or fortunately, the choices of Pale Ales in America has become a labyrinth in which there is little light and for the foreseeable future no end. This of course has advantages and disadvantages. This beer is one of the bright lights in the unending labyrinth of Pales. It serves as a reminder of what a great Pale is and why the have become so popular. I dont hesitate to call it a bench mark beer! On to the beer.  Pours up a billowy whipped cream head made of medium to large size bubbles that cling to glass beautifully and leave a plethora of lace. This beautiful Schaumkrone tops an orange tinged copper elixir that, due to the generous amount of hops used to dry hop it reveals a slight haze. The aroma is enticing with strong up front Pine and Woody aroma hops with hint of grapefruit in the background. Reminds me of a blend of Amarillo and Cascade hops we use to use at the brewery. Behind the initial thrust of crisp hops is the strong malt background rounded out with a slight fruitiness and alcohol thanks to the ale yeast. The ale hits the tongue bitter and coasts it nicely and fully with crisp citrus-like and pine-like hops. This kind of hop punch can only be obtained through more than generous dry hop addition. BRAVO! Behind the hops is solid malt backbone that features a slight toasted flavor and adds a welcomed slight sweetness. The bitterness doesnt really linger but rather tingles the mouth and throat while you experience all the flavors of this hop tea once again as you breathe out.  Zum Wohl!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PittBeerGirl,3.42,"A- Transparent medium amber body. An aggressive pour only produced a head of 1 finger. The tiny bubbles constantly rising to the top (which is great because I'm drinking this from a standard pint glass) give this one a decent head retention. Eventually a thin collar remains and no lacing is left behind in the glass.  S- Wonderful bouquet of citrus, floral, and earthy hops with a sweet caramel malt backbone.  T- A balance of herbal and citrus hop taste upfront with a weak caramel malt backbone. The finish is mostly herbal hops with a caramel malt sweetness. Lingering bitterness is aggressive and somewhat unpleasant. Also lingering is an herbal hop taste, caramel malt sweetness, and alcohol warmth.  M- Aggressive carbonation and oily body of medium thickness.  D- This is a decent IPA but not one of my favorites. I was surprised that the alcohol was detected in this medium ABV brew. This one is full of hop flavor and bitterness. I may revisit this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,seaoflament,4.18,"On tap at the Louie's Suds n' Sun at San Diego State University. The best thing on tap and it's something I haven't reviewed, plus it's another hot day and this one seemed like the right beer.  Poured into a clear plastic cup, hey at least it's a clear one. Golden color with lots of foam, a thin layer of foam persisted throughout its entirety. Great lacing too.  The aroma is a bit of a let down. I was expecting this one to be more intense but it's not. Maybe it is the plastic cup but I'm not picking up much here. I had to wait until I drank about 1/3 of the beer and let it get a little warmer to get some aroma. I wasn't getting much but it was a bit better with some citrus, pine and sweetness from the malt.  The taste has a nice bitterness with some fruit flavors in the finish. Some pine flavors begin to develop as I continue to drink it.  Mouthfeel and carbonation are both very good and the drinkability is pretty high as well.  I will have to review this one from a bottle since, for some reason, I wasn't getting too much aroma and I'm sure a bottled version, or a proper glass, would improve its score.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A- One finger head goes quickly to just a coating. Yellow in color and lots of tiny bubbles rising to top. Nice lacing.  S- A few hops in the nose but mostly a yeasty malt smell. The hops smell citrusy.  T- Lots of flavor going on in this brew. Definitely hoppy, much more so then I expected. A piney/citrus taste is turning dry in the finish. This one is for hopheads.  M- Slick start, dry finish. Hops put a nice tingle in the throat. Pretty good carbonation.  D- Really can't taste the alcohol.

147,88,domtronzero,4.2,"Awesome! I can't believe a beer of this quality came from less than 30 miles from my house! Pours a perfectly clear (leave the yeast in the bottle - this is LIVE beer) copper color with a beautiful, dense, creamy white head, leaving lacing all over the glass. The hops can be smelled a mile away. The centennial hops dominate the palate, with an exceptionally strong bitterness from Magnum (perfect for blending without a strong taste imparted). Taste is that of citrusy fruits, with a strong hop bitterness that perfectly balances the malty sweetness. Mouthfeel: Light and slick, with a pleasant tingling on the tongue. A sweet/citrusey aftertaste lingers in the background. Overall, one of my favorite beers. Goes great with Bob Sagat live (inside joke).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,sacrelicio,4.2,"Good, simple, ""pure"" IPA from the almighty Stone brewery. This IPA pours a light orange/amber color, like a glass of cold apple juice, into a pint glass, leaving a decent off white head. As I consume the beer, a good lace forms on the walls of the glass. The smell is of citrusy hops and not much else. Pure, clean grapefruit and orange. The taste follows the smell nicely with pure citrus and some alcohol. Quite bitter. The mouthfeel is light and adds to the refreshing quality of this beer. This ale is nicely drinkable once one gets used to the hop attack. Overall, this reminds me of my more familiar midwest favorite, Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Like Two Hearted, this ale has a simple, pure, and delicious character dominated by citrus, particlarly grapefruit, rather than a complex, malty profile.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,livingregret,2.38,"---This is a review of the beer while it is Warm!!!--- Serving Type: 22 Oz Bottle  Appearance: Pours a golden orange w/ a 1 finger head. Plenty of lacing as the head lingers right above the surface  Smell: Citrus, hops, pine...the alcohol does not come through in the smell.  Taste: While warm the drink, in my opinion, looses a lot of its subtlety's as the grapefruit overpowers almost any other taste. The bite from the citrus is a bit overbearing and removes the taste of hops. In the places of the hops is a extremely bitter taste  Mouthfeel: Luckily the beer retains it's very light mouthfeel, almost whimsical the way it smoothly rolls through the mouth. It does leave your mouth a bit more dry though because of the citrus.  Drinkability: As the beer warms up it looses it's drinkability because of the overpowering grapefruit flavour that blocks out anything else. YES IPA's usually have a high bitterness, but this one is quite smooth and enjoyable while cold. When it becomes Warm it destroys any previous thoughts you may have on the drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cswhitehorse,4.2,Stone IPA comes in a dark black brown bottle with an ominous gargoyle.  It is much softer than the outside bottle leads on. I was scared to try this one as I felt from the picture it could give a nightmare of two. The stone ipa pours a light orange color with a head that takes off quickly but leaves a quarter inch on the top. The smell is citrusy and light. The taste is really smooth. One of the smoothest American IPA's I have tried. Here in the NW this style seems to rule the run of the mill beer or supermarket store alleys. The mouthfeel is good but really soft and leaves right away. This beer tastes really good. I will definitely have it again. It seems to be lighter version of style.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MiguelMandingo,4.5,"This is one of my favorite IPAs, definitely one of my old standbys. I have been drinking this one for a while, and just now got around to reviewing it. Luckily for me, it is readily available in Texas. Unluckily, it is one of only two Stone products that we get here in Texas, the other being Arrogant Bastard. It is a shame, because Stone beers are soooo good  Poured a 12oz. into a DFH shaped pint glass.  Appearance  It pours out a transparent honey gold color. It produced a 2 finger head that slowly dissipated to a single finger head. The head leaves lots of lacing the further along I drink. This is a very beautiful beer.  Smell  It has a big scent. I detect a slight sugary sweetness, pine, and a lots of lemony, grapefruity, citrusy hops.  Taste  It has an equally big flavor. Citrus and piney hops are the dominant flavor. There is a subtle sweetness from the malt, but like a good IPA, takes a backseat to the hops. This beer has near perfect balance.  Mouthfeel  Great. It has a really great level of carbonation, leaving a dry finish. Light to medium bodied.  Drinkability  This brew has great drinkability. It is very easy drinking. 6.9% ABV is fairly light for me  I could (and have) easily session this one all night long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DavidSeanNJ,4.42,"Ahhh Stone IPA, a pleasure to sip and to review.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass.  A- A wonderful golden transluscent orange. Huge head- tons of lacing all throughout- beautiful to my eyes.  S- Smelled of citrus hops/pine.  T- What a smooth balance for an IPA. Those hops are big, strong, and upfront but provide an interesting mix between sweet citrus flavors and bitter flavors.  M- Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing- carbonation and burning alcohol sensation.  D- Drinkability gets huge points for me here. At 6.9%, you would never know. Unbelievably smooth- perfect example of the style.  This can always be found in my refrigerator. Does it to me everytime.

147,88,penguinjive7,4.45,"Very clear golden color with a nice white head.  Smell is of spicy hops with a hint o citrus.  The taste is very crisp and hoppy. The herbal, piny hops it first with the fruity hops adding immediately after. A nice malt presence envelops and cleanses the pallet to lead to a nice, smooth finish.  The drinkability of this brew is astounding. Quite possibly one of the smoothest IPAs I've ever had. Another top notch brew from stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,leviathan85,4.23,"A: Honey-ish with a thin white head. Great lacing however.  S: Lots and lots of hops, small traces of alcohol.  T: Again lots of hops, but a strong malt backbone to balance it out.  M: Fair amount of carbonation with a rather strong bitterness.  D: Very good, considering the bitterness. Great balance, and for such a hoppy IPA this one is quite drinkable.  Overall a great IPA. Tons of hops, but also a great balance that makes this a go-to beer for those looking for a very hoppy beer without and overwhelming ""hop-bomb"" characteristic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Will46andbrew,4.72,"A - Looks like a nice crisp clear IPA, on the light side, not too dark.  S - Sweet smell of hops! Love those hops. Smells fruity and sweet.  T - Very hoppy, but not over the top. Nice light IPA with plenty of hop power.  M - Very nice on the toungue. Smooth and tasty.  D - Extremely drinkable, maybe too drinkable. Very well balanced nice IPA, not trying to be something it isn't. I love Double IPAs, but this IPA is top notch.  Overall I was extremely pleased with this IPA. I would say for a plain IPA, it's better than the 60 Minute. I wish that I didn't have to go to MA for this beer, but it's worth the drive to Yankee Spirits! Can't wait to get my lips on this beer again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bitterbill,4.67,"Bought as part of a mixed 6Pack at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins.  It pours from 12oz bottle a clear gold with a large head of foam that shrinks to a fine broken layer with lacing.  The smell is an abundance of citrus hops and spice. When I take deep wiffs, I can also smell some sweet malt. It's a very good nose.  The taste is, well. yummy. Plenty of citrus(grapefruit) there, which is typical for a Stone brew but probably never boring, and about midway through, there's a more than ample maltiness that balances out this IPA beautifully. Man, this baby is packed with flavour and is so easy to drink....a world class American IPA if I ever tasted one. And that's with it coming straight out of the fridge. The flavours get even better as the beer warms up. The mouthfeel is great and it finishes with just the right amount of bitterness to leave me yearning for more. Superb!  Well, I've had this IPA many times before and I always ""assumed"" that I had already reviewed it. My bad.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,younger35,4.12,"Drank this IPA with some Thai food that I took over to my girlfriends house. Drank it out of a fruity ass pink glass (it was all I could find at her house!!).  Appearance- Pours a nice murky honey orange with hints of amber depending upon the light. Nice frothy off-white head that doesnt last long but leaves a nice collar and very light, spotty lacing. Smell- Bright and very floral. Lots of hops in this bad boy. Very raw, oily pine scent bursts out of this brew. Grapefruit, and sweet lemony cleanness combine for a very pleasing aroma that smells like a IPA should. Taste- Very bitter sweet citrus upfront that is bright and cheery. Follows with more of a earthy, almost dirty hop bite that is pretty tasty. Sweet doughy malts add a balance to this brew that is awesome. Bitter aftertaste that reminds me of taking a suck of a lime after a tequila shot (not mouth puckering, just very citrusy). Almost no hints of alcohol as the balance of the brew seems hide any trace. Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with a slick, oily feel. Dry finish that is almost numbing. Hoppy! Drinkability- This is a very solid IPA that I enjoyed quite a bit. It has the balance that is needed with the extraordinary amount of hops that are in this brew. As a daily brew to sit and sip on, this has too much hops for me. As a brew to sit and enjoy once-in-a-while or with some fantastic Thai food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,far333,4.3,"Golden colored with hints of apricot, tiny bubbles stream quickly from bottom to top reaching up to a one-inch high frothy dimpled head of chunky foam.  Big nose of flowers and banana, citrus and butterscotch.  Flavor is mildly sweet, initially grainy sugars and sweet malt, some ripe fruits riding along with the fresh hops. Hops are clean and crisp, not overwhelming, but get a little sharper as they move toward orange rind and pine in the finish. Pine sap lingers. Nice even balance of malt and hops, very clean. Alcohol doesn't detract.  Mouthfeel is initially slick, but bubbles tingle further down the tongue, becoming fuller and creamy. A little tannic, but not much. Very drinkable, very smooth. Good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Risser09,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into a wine glass  Appearance: Golden orange color with a 1 inch white head. Clear beer, with no sediment to speak of. Small amounts of lacing are left behind in the wake of the head.  Smell: Fresh and floral. Moreso than Ruination. Generous dry hopping is iin effect, with many varieties in smells like. Aromas are peach, grapefruit, strawberry. Undertones are Rose, cut grass, and honeysuckle.  Taste: Sweet but bitter in the forefront. Flavors of raspberry are actually there. Maybe some other berry goodness in there too. The taste is dominated by hops though. A pleasant, easygoing balance of flavors.  Mouthfeel: Like Ruination, creamy and easy to swallow. Not overwhelmed with carbonation but there is still plenty of bittering hops to go around in the finish. You basically get a nice sprtiz of carbonation and then the creaminess takes over. And, unlike other IPAs, there ISN'T A HUGE drying effect on the palate.  Drinkability: Great. Beers like this deserve to be imbibed until ossification. Seriously, it is a great beer that I would consume a lot of if given the chance. How much for a keg? ;-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,choyhosoi,3.75,This one has a very nice pour. The head dissapates slowly and you are left with orange-gold colored beer. The smell is filled with hops (fruity). The taste was smooth at first and went down with a hint of bitterness.

Juicy, hop resin; tropical and citrus fruit aromas: peach, apricot, pineapple. Light cream and vanilla sweetness. Cutting, warm alcohol.  Semi-sweet, creamy malt base beneath a juicy, tropical fruit: melon, peach, pineapple. A building, earthen-pine flavor that cuts the fruity-esters and gives a spicy, rough bitterness. The alcohol presence and hop oils re-emerge in the aftertaste.  A light, medium in body; creamy, smooth and wonderfully balanced/well-rounded.

147,88,atsprings,4.35,"22oz bomber poured into a Stone IPA glass. A slightly hazy pale orange with a decent slowly diminishing head that left spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus hops and sweet malts. Taste is a wonderful hop blend with a sweet creamy maltiness providing a great balance with hops only slightly overpowering, not at all too much for an IPA. The beer is actually light and crisp and very refreshing, the alcohol is very well hidden.

147,88,marksto,4.09,"Pours a dark golden color with medium head of rather large bubbles and medium retention. Nose displays big floral hop aroma, with citrusy grapefuit notes. Aroma is easily detectable with the nose 3-4 inches above the glass, nice. Flavor again displays the dominate classic american hop flavor with citrus and some pine with a lightly biscuity malt background.  A very nice example of an IPA from a brewery renowned for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ncvbc,4.57,"Pour was a nice light amber, leaving a medium white head and decent lacing. Smell was lovely. Grapefruit, citrus hops with some floral notes as well. Some sweet caramel malts in there also. Taste was much of the same. Juicy, citrus hop flavor with a good floral attribute that followed smell closely. Malts add a little backbone and make this a near balanced treat. Mouthfeel is thirst quenching. A little bittersweet tingle on the tongue that is great. Drinkability is also up there. Doesn't seem like a 6.9% IPA, more like 6 tops to me. One of my favorites within the style. I'd put it up with the Two Hearted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tpd975,4.47,"To be honest I have no idea where this beer came from. It may be one I picked up on my trip to Tennessee, or it may have come as part of a trade. Either way, I look forward to enjoying it.  A: Pours a nice golden yellow color with a head that looks like whipped egg whites. There are a few bubbles racing too the top, and some beautiful lacing left behind.  S: This one has a nice big aroma. I poured it into my De Verboden Vrucht chalice which let the aroma waft into the air. There is a wonderful citrus aroma here. I smell grapefruit, limes, and lemon, with an underlying touch of pine.  T: I love every Stone beer I have ever tried and this one is no exception. It starts out with a splash of citrus and the bite of some of the earths most wonderful hops. It finishes with a nice sweetness as it runs down my throat.  M: Medium bodied with a nice bite from the hops. The beer seems to run down the throat almost giving it a syrupy quality.  D: It is a very drinkable IPA. I started out pounding this bomber and had to tell myself to actually slow down and enjoy it since I had only one.  Overall: One of the greatest IPA's if not the greatest IPA known to man. It has a perfect balance of Malt and Hops, Bitterness and Sweetness. It is a damn near perfect beer. Stone blazes trails when it comes to their beers and this one blazed a path right to my heart. If I had unlimited access to this beer I would be a much happier man. There is no doubt Greg Koch and the boys over at Stone make some of the best beer in America.  As I finished drinking this beer I was left with one thought... I'm not worthy!

No real flaws as this is just hops.  Taste: Somewhat medium to light body. A crisp sharp hop bite that doesn't linger for long. Slight peppery and very citrusy. Malt is mostly for hop conveyence. Bittering, Flavor and Aroma hops are balanced to produce one of the best American IPA's I have had in recent years.  Mouthfeel: Crisp carbonation gives this something thin beer a little more body.

147,88,scottblaze,4.33,"Nice delicious looking light amber, almost clear ( very lighty hazy), good head retention, lacing that zig-zag'd as I drank all the way to the bottom of the glass and stayed there.  Delicate grapefruit/floral bouquet. Maybe a little pine. Had to study this a bit to pick it up.  Tasting, the hops begin their magic, a hint of chamomile and grapefruit. Bitterness comes on strong but interestingly does not linger long as if beckoning another drink. Nice hop/alcohol balance.  Refreshing, tingly,carbonated/hop bite.  If not for the 6.9 ABV, I could indulge on this a while. After a couple of pints, thought I'd better ease up, had to drive. An excellent summertime refresher.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Floral hop aroma that you would expect from an IPA. Pine needles. Grapefruit.  T: Big hop taste, grapefruit and spruce aftertaste. A very good example of the American IPA. Flavor, ingredients, etc. It's all there.  M: Smooth and easy, leaves a nice fruity hop aftertaste that lingers perfectly  D: Sneaky alcohol presence, but a good beer to chill out with after a hard day at work  O: Overall, this is a well-crafted IPA, solid on all fronts.

Some orange peel flavours are in there too.  Mouthfeel has an Avg. amount of carbonation, but it is finer than some others. Medium bodied.  Overall, it's a good IPA. Bold taste, but still drinkable.

147,88,MrMcGibblets,3.95,"ok, i've been waiting to procure this beer and have seen that in all the reviews it's hops, hops, hops. but as soon as i cracked this one i got a load of sweet, doughy malts. very nice aroma. the hops are present (but less so than the malt character) in the bouqet with some resiny citrus notes mixed in. the overall smell of this beer is very enticing. taste is a very nice moderate bready malt sweetness followed by a nice, moderate hoppy, crisp finish. well-balanced between the malts and hop bitterness. very tasty. medium-bodied with a spritzy mouthfeel. this is some real good shit and as my first stone beer i can't wait to try the rest of their offerings. Update: I like the color-more golden, pale malts, but there has been some sediment. Nose has not jumped out as much with the hops. Bitterness is a bit harsh and astringent-enamel removing. Still good though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Contra,4.32,"Stone's I.P.A. has all the quintessential aspects of an I.P.A., and has a light enough body to appeal to a broad audience. That's not to say that it's not complex. First impression is of peaches, with a follow up of pine. There is a healthy, bitter bite as it finishes. When I poured it, there were massive amounts of head, which subsided eventually. This gave off a sweet aroma. A very refreshing beer.  Overall, this will probably become one of my first choices for parties/BBQs. This is a rather bold I.P.A. with a lot of hops. Still, I think it's well-balanced enough to appeal to anyone who likes the style. Unless hops scare you, you'll probably enjoy this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SacoDeToro,4,"On tap at Stone.  Pours a rich golden yellow with a small white head.  The aroma is of intense citrus fruits and sappy pine resin.  The flavor of the beer has an assertive hop character that's both resiny and citrusy (grapefruit). The maltiness of the beer was lightly sweet and biscuity.  The mouthfeel was light, which aids to the drinkability of this great beer. The carbonation was tight and dialed in.  This beer is a very solid IPA and a great go-to beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Consistent with the style, the hop aroma is quite large - I got earthy, floral tones. Taste was magnificent - an excellent example of the style. Hop bitterness very evident without blowing me out of my chair as the substantial malt backbone is able to handle the large hop dosage. Warms as it goes down revealing its 6.9% ABV. Mouthfeel had a medium body and lively, but not overly carbonated. Overall, very drinkalbe. I'd definitely recommend to hop heads and anyone looking to gain an appreciation for what an IPA is supposed to taste like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wagenvolks,4.59,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a golden orange, clear brew with a fair amount of off-white head that leaves decent lacing. Aroma is intoxicatingly rich in sweet, piney hops and caramel. A bit one sided, but I gave it a full five anyway.  Taste is much like the aroma, but the hops are a bit less on the sweet side and pack quite the bitter punch. Some orange peel as well. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing, and has a lingering hoppy bite that lasts just the right amount of time. Definately a beer that's drinkable as hell, I could easily have 3-4 of these in one sitting. Fantastic offering from Stone, they haven't disappointed yet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Glazed144,3.94,"Excellent brew, what less could you expect out of Stone. Lacing like whoa, not the most powerful of aromas though. Nothing like ruination. Good balance, smooth beer. Mouthfeel was pretty good, but sometihng wasnt sitting well with me, cant put my finger on it. Tastes a nice bit of hoppiness but nothing to overwhelming. Bit of an alcohol presence unfortunately, which surprises me since Stone Ruination is nearly a percent higher, and I just finished one of those and tasted no alcohol. Oh well, very good beer nonetheless, but this will be my last today cause Stones other quality is they get you drunk fast...

Slightly sweet in the end, with some ethanol character.  M: Creamy, full-bodied, resiny, very enjoyable.  D: Very good for an IPA, and easily available at almost every corner liquor store in Huntington.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BladeRunner,4.3,"Pours a golden/orange body, with a small white head. Head is rather sticky all the way down.  Smell is of floral, pine and citrus.  Tase is strong in hops, but not as crazy as Stone's Arrogant Bastard. Some spice going on, and again piney aftertaste.  Mouthfeel has a nice crisp attack, with a bit of a bite. Though, it has an overall nice finish.  Drinkability is rather high I would say.  Another great product from the Stone Brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,0tt0,4.14,"12 oz. bottle decanted into a shaker pint.  Pours a honey colored yellowish with tones of carbonation bubbling up, capping with a 1/4 inch of thin but sticky foam that forms a reverse meniscus. The head is attractive, but otherwise looks tame. Grapefruit and orange hit the nostrils first with a bit of toasty, cracker-like malt peeking through. Again, nothing earth-shattering. Oh, but that first sip certainly suggests something out of the ordinary. The grapefruit hinted at in the nose is there in full force in a bitter, piney onslaught. The middle is a lovely, cracker flavored joy. For a brewery that prides itself on monster hops, I am surprised to see the amount of delicious malt that is present. Its a beautiful counterbalance. Ah, the appearance gets better as it goes along. this is some of the stickiest, prettiest head I've seen, with waves of lace latching onto the side of the glass. Lovely... The aftertaste is dry and sweet and fairly long-lasting. I've had Ruination, which is a hop-bomb to say the least. But this is remarkably balanced for a west-coast IPA. Definately a treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,3Vandoo,4,"I must agree with many reviews here, the Stone IPA is better than the ruination.  She appears in a golden amberish color with orangish flows, that stucks a nice foamy lacy head.  Smell: Hops,hops, hops more hops, are we in a hops farm, floral, piney citrus flavours come out from everywhere which ends up in a heavy malt flavour.  Taste wise, she is refreshing, of course hoppy, but with flavours, citrus, floral, herbal and piney flavours the hops, but quite balanced with the malt, quite balanced actually.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,walshclimb,4.23,"Pours very clear golden with thick, ~3"" head and very bubbly body. The head is long-lived, thinning slowly while drinking and leaving lace with large bubbles. The smell is clean, piney hops with some lemon-citrus and just a little bready. Nice balance of malt and hops on the initial flavor and is weighted, as expected, to hops. Lightly sweet, warm bitter aftertaste that is average to long-lived. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a slightly creamy texture, lively carbonation, and light to moderately acidic. This is a tasty IPA that I will definitely buy again. Not necessarily my favorite but it compares very well to others I have been tasting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dansting,4.5,Bottle. Poured a cloudy golden color with floating sediment and a thick white head. Strong lacing. Great hoppy aroma with nice citrus tones to it. Pleasant mouthfeel.

Smell: Wonderful - it's nice to get a beer that knows what it is and isn't afraid to show it. What you'd expect from a good IPA, fruity and lots of hops.  Taste:The flavor really comes out with this one. The hops are right there and the taste stays solid and doesn't change.  Mouthfeel:Smooth but still agressive.

Appears a slightly hazy golden yellow color with about two fingers of off-white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a nice lace on the inside of the glass. Smells of fresh citrus and fragrant, woody pine followed by sweet caramel malt. Tastes of sweet citrus fruits(orange and lemon), and bitter hops all followed by wonderful, sweet malts to balance it all out. Medium in both body and carbonation. This is a beer that I keep coming back to quite often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HotterThanHell,4,"Nice IPA with a real nice head and some fine lacing. Sometimes I wonder about brewers covering up their inadequacies with tons of hops, but this certainily is not the case here.  Very nice citrus mixed with woodsy aroma with a cloudy golden color. The taste is fairly typical in the hop department for an IPA, but taste beyond the hops and you'll find this to be an excellent beer.

147,88,SilentSabre,3.92,"$4,45/bomber at Kwik Liquor North Green River Rd. Evansville, Ind USA  I actually enjoyed this a bit more than I though I would. It poured up nicely with a cloudy pale orange body and nice looking white foamy head. Lace was extra sticky, and the smell was precisley where I thought it would be: freshly crushed pine needles and un-sweetend grapefruit juice. Taste, however, was much better balanced than was expecting. There certainly is a high level of hop character in the taste, but nothing like the aggressive hop profile I had envisioned. This turned out to be very well balanced indeed. Moderate hop presence up front with a substantial level of malt to iron things out, and of course, a hop sting in the middle. Finish was nice and smooth with a dry bitterness that I liken to biting the rind of a piece of citrus fruit. I must admit, I am indeed surprised with this one. A nice representation of the style that isn't over-done like so many others.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,2wheeledpirate,5,"This is the only beer I have ever had and even thought of scoring a perfect 5. And yes, as the tips suggest, I would say with conviction that nothing could be improved in this beer. It pours a medium brown with a thin head. The nose is pure hop and the first taste backs that right up. Then the pleasant surprise is a ""fruitty"" pop at the back end, but the bitterness of the hops still hang around. This is ""the"" beer for me. The ""stuck on a desert island with only one choice"" beer. Try it, you will not be dissapointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jamie2dope,4.35,"Picked this one up in Medford Square. Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass a orange/gold color, with a thick two finger heading. Aroma was largely a bouquet of sweet smells of citrus, dew, and even a hint of white vanilla cake. Although not as dominant, there was also a bit of grassy earth notes in the aroma as well. Taste was filled with citrus hops and grassy undertones. The balance on this beer is insane...hoppy but not overly bitter. Mouthfeel was also surprisingly light considering this brewery. I really like this beer. I still think the Ruination has a slight edge, but this is definitely worth tasting. Good job Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Osiris9588,4.32,"12oz bottle, no date. Pours a clear, pale honey color with a creamy white head. It slowly recedes into foamy ridges, leaving ample lacing.  Aroma: hoppy! Fragrant pine and grapefruit, along with slight nut and wood. Flavor is dominated by hops, along with wood, nut, grapefruit, orange peel, light spice, some biscuit action, and a light metallic sheen.  It's medium-bodied with mucho complexity--the hops dominate the ride, but their provide different sensations on the palate all the way through. Very drinkable for those partial to the hops. Another killer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Carbonation is noticable. Aroma is all citrus hops. Flavor is caramel malt with some spice notes. Undertones of grapefruit and pine are also present. You feel a nice spicy hop bite on your tounge. The beer is medium-bodied. It ends with a very dry, bitter finish. This is an above average IPA, but for me I would prefer a little bit bigger flavor to go along with the excellent hop kick.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,mithrascruor,4.05,"22 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange color with a dense, thick, foamy white head.  Smell: Has a nice lightly sweet citrus aroma, with a pine/juniper hop overtone that adds some bitterness.  Taste: It's quite like the smell, as far as the different flavors go. Well-balanced, though the finish and aftertaste is definitely on the bitter hoppy side.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied -- a bit too light, I think. Very minimal carbonation. Quite smooth, though it has that mild grainyness present in many IPAs.  Drinkability: Strong, but not excessive. And it's well-balanced too, so the hoppy bitterness of the aftertaste is offset well.  A nicely balanced beer from Stone. I would like it a lot more if it didn't feel so light-bodied and if it weren't so lacking in carbonation, but it's still one of the better American IPAs I've had. This is a must to try if you like IPAs, and recommendable in general as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,eberkman,4.55,"Poured a hazy-amber orange with a sticky, thick off-white head with excellent retention. The smell was dominated by piney, grapefruity aromas giving good anticipation of hoppiness. The taste was a knockout. wonderful grapefruity hoppiness balanced beautifully with a pungent malty sweet/sourness. Nice quenching, dry finish. Became much more bitter as it warmed up. Good crispness in the mouth. Not as sessionable as some other IPAs because of the slightly higher ABV, but enjoyable nonetheless. I look forward to having this again and again -- definitely worth the 20-minute trip to Julio's for this one!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Stoneman78,4.15,"One of the four ""Stone Core"" selections. Received from a friend, this is from the older Stone brewery in San Marcos, so it is a little aged. . .  A- Pours a clear light orange hue; large creamy white head that is mostly sustaining; moderate lacing throughout  S- Nose is dominated by citrusy hops and slight pine tones, classic west coast IPA. . .  T- Crisp and smooth taste; subtle hops initially followed quickly by citrus tones; aftertaste is rather short-lasting and the hops are not quite as bitter as similar IPAs; slight maltiness that is nicely balanced  M- Smooth and watery mouthfeel; nice creaminess and lively carbonation  D- This is a great example of a west coast IPA that is easy-drinking and full of hoppy goodness that is far from overwhelming. It falls a little short of its cross-town IPA cohort at Alesmith, but still a great choice!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jjayjaye,3.95,"Pours a clear light amber color with better than a full finger off white head that fades to surface fairly quickly. Some lacing present.  The smell is on the subtle side. Floral, sweet malt and citrus.  Medium to light bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated but uniform.  The flavor is lightly hoppy and on the sweet side.  Drinks like a session beer but at 6.9% ABV i won't be knocking these back. This one is nice but not living up to the hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnnydollar,4.03,"pours a nice somewhat transparent light orange. not much head but laces down the glass. nice dry hopped aroma.  The taste is balanced. for a hop head, too balanced. i was hoping for more bitterness, but without a doubt a good brew. the first flavors i taste are the slightly sweet malts, but then the hops kick in and make it what it is. a good american ipa.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,willjschmidt,4.13,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Bottle marked ""best before 06/27/07"".  A: Pours a clear light golden color with a solid off-white head. A nice 1/4"" thick head remains on the brew throughout. Very good lacing as well.  S: Lots of pungent hops in the form of mostly pine with a touch of citrus.  T: First to hit the tongue is a big smack of bitter hops. This is followed by a touch of citrus in the form of grapefruit and orange. Not as much fruit as some other IPA's. The aftertaste is that of dry bitter hops, it lingers on the tongue for quite a while and puckers the mouth. The hops/malt balance is decent, definitely tilted towards hops. A touch of malt sweetness as well.  M: Big, smooth, and slightly creamy due to the ever present head, nice level of carbonation.  D: A very quaffable IPA. It goes down easy and smooth even with all the dominant bitter hops present in the brew. A big IPA, not for those that not like hops shoved in their mouth. A very solid and very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scott,4.03,"V.07 Light copper, medium carbonation, and thin rimmed head. Nose is a pleasant, but subdued citrus makes you wish for more pronounced aromatics. Easy drinking with a crisp, mildly bitter and dry finish. Pine & citrus, light malt. Very nice, and you can't go wrong with this as far as a standard IPA is concerned. Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sstackho,4.14,12oz bottle. Pours a light bronze with notable carbonation. Aroma is divine with the smell of fresh hops - going so far as to remind me of the aroma of some cask ales. Flavour is heavy hops on the piney side. Bold and full hoppy aftertaste. Rewarding. RE-RATE: Just had a fresh bottle. Absolutely outstanding. The fresh hops weren't as piney as I previously found.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kajerm,3.37,"Bottle, pours pale amber and slightly hazy, with a big white head and signficant lacing. There are a lot of beers that smell and taste hoppy, but this is one of a very few beers that looks hoppy-- if you look at the glass closely, you can see clouds of emulsified hop oils; pretty cool, and maybe a little ominous.  The aroma is loaded with pine and citrus character-- the dry-hopping really shows here. As far as I can tell, they didn't use cool hops (although it smells like there MIGHT be amarillo in there somewhere), but this doesn't smell as mundane and straightforward as a lot of west coast IPAs.  Opens up with citric hop flavor and some nondescript fruitiness. The finish is intense bitterness that sucks your soul out through your tongue. Bittering seems even more over the top since this beer is so empty mid-palate, and because the malt backbone is light to nonexistent.  Mouthfeel is thick and resinous, with low carbonation.  I looked forward to relaxing with one of these (and pairing it with some spicy chicken arabiatta), but the balance is no good-- bittering is out of control compared to the rest of the beer.  It's a damn shame too, because it smells so nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DoubleJ,4.5,"On-tap at Heroe's last night. Same glowing appearance, but not as much head. The dry-hopping isn't as overpowering as it is from the bottle, but the flavor isn't as bitter, more sweet citrus. This makes the beer much more drinkable and refreshing on draft compared to the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gunnerman,3.8,"Poured a bomber into my arrogant bastard specialty glass, pours an orange rustic color with a fluffy foamy head that stays the entire time and leaves some lace on the glass. Smell is pretty hoppy citrusy and grassy. Taste is bitter like grapefruits and also some citrus hops in the mix, I do enjoy this brew but other bottles that I have had seemed to taste a bit better, this is still an extremly good brew and a damn fine IPA plus stone has the coolest bottles ever.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Graham21,3.65,"Pours a golden apricot color with a two finger head that recedes to about 1mm. Smells of hops and pine. Unlike the rich hoppy scent, this beer seems to be lacking on the IPA flavor. Its not as sweet as I expected and the malt was lacking . I did pick up coraiander, spices, apple, and citrus fruits along with hops and a bit of alcohol. The carbonation was good and the body was medium. Although not bad, being an IPA lover this one didn't do it for me",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,khiasmus,4.26,"A- Light golden, the perfect pale ale color. fluffy off-white head that pours four fingers thick and then lasts as a half a finger for the life of the beer... and laces beautifully.  S- Peaches, pine, some faint yeast, caramel, a hint of citrus and a very faint hint of alcohol.  T- Sweet caramel goodness up front, then light, piney, bitter hops in the back... a wonderfully well-balanced IPA.  M- Smooth, buttery, and then light and a smooth finish. Medium carbonation and a bit of astringency at the end of each sip.  D- Because of the balance, this is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Good in the hops, wonderful malt. mmm.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mobud,4.42,"poured from bottle into pint glass.  A- Dark yellow with light white head that slow disappears.  S- Slight citrus with a little pine underneath.  T- The citrus hop taste was first and formost for me. The taste stayed balanced and there was a slight bitter aftertaste that remained.  M- Medium. The beer did not linger too long and gave enough on the frontend that made it enjoyable.  D- Very. The 6.9% alcohol would prevent me from have too many, but the ones I did have would be fun. Another fine Stone product!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,StoneDisciple,4.27,"The Stone IPA is a great beer, but not the perfect example of an IPA. Poured into a glass it's slightly cloudy, with a golden tint. The aroma is citrusy with a good load of hops, although not as much as I expected. While clearly a hop-based beer, the IPA is lacking slightly in the truly bitter hops experience I expect from a west coast IPA. There is little (but noticeable) malt flavor, but the hop intensity just isn't there. The citrus and bitterness is prevalent, but the bitterness quickly subsides to a mild bite. Although this detracts from the expected IPA characteristics, it makes the beer very drinkable. Highly sessionable, but not the best example of an American IPA. Still a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scoobybrew,3.97,"This was poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It has a hazy golden color with a thick head that has decent retention. Citrus-like hops dominate the aroma, but there is some malt noticed. The taste is mostly spicy American type hops with a nice malt backing it up. It has a nice citrus-like hop finish. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation.  Overall, this is a very tasty IPA. It's hops are the star here, but the malt is very tasty as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cbreitro,3.93,"I love Stone, in part because they are not afraid to go heavy on the hops. Because of that I was a bit disappointed with their IPA. I guess they make it more in the British style rather than American, which tends to be heavier on the hops.  The appearance was a nice copper color, and it is clear, not cloudy like many IPAs.  The taste was very good, but I was expecting more of the hoppy bitterness. That being said, it is very drinkable, and if I was not expecting more bitterness I would probably rate it higher.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ultralarry2006,4.16,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle. Leaves about one finger of a white head that has excellent retention, and leaves excellent lacing. Body is a golden amber.  Smell - citrusy, floral, and piney hops fill the nose. Where's the malt ?  Taste - as promised by the smell. Citrusy, floral, and piney hops, and only the slighest hint of toasty malt biscuits. Very unbalanced in favor of the hops, although I do like it.  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, foamy with a great deal of hop oil slickness, and semi-dry from the hop bitterness.  Drinkability - this a very good AIPA, one that showcases the hops, if maybe neglecting the malt. It is also sessionable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Padron4KM,3.92,"22 oz bottle. Hazy golden with a thick lasting off white head and sticky lace.  Aroma is citrus and floral hops with a good dose of caramel.  Flavor is piney, grapefruity hops, balanced with some nice caramel sweetness.  Finish is long and mildly bitter. yum",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ttu94,4.2,great beer. I got it based on its beer advocate rating of 91. Pours a hazy gold with a good head. The smell has an almost orange aroma to it along with hoppiness. The taste is fantastic. More orange flavor and again big hops. It also tastes a bit creamy to me. Finishes very clean and crisp. I need to get some broken halo IPA from Widmer and see which I like better.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tempest,3.75,"On-tap at Kelly Cole's in Syracuse.  A different sort of IPA, which is very welcome. I didnt get any distinct malt profile of this one, but the citrus hops were an interesting mix of smooth flavor and powerful bitterness. This, with the lack of malt flavor, make the mouthfeel seem a little empty while making it more drinkable at the same time. Huh. Try it anyways.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Monkeyknife,4.2,Poured from the bottle a hazy yellow-gold with a thick head. Good lacing to the end.  The aroma is very hoppy with a combination of citrus and pine. The presence of malt must be noted.  The combination of citrus and malt is very nice. There is a strong bitterness present towards the end.  Medium bodied and lightly carbonated.  This is a decent IPA. Not the best I've ever had but not one I would kick out of bed either.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rmfyeah,4.6,"This beer is hop heaven Pours a hazy golden color with a nice head with laces that remain for awhile. You can smell the hops, it's not overwhelming for how present they are once you taste it. Taste is awesome. I love hop-upped beers and this is one of my favorites because its fairly easy to find. To say this bear has great hop characteristics is an understatement. Somehow finishes great- citrus and a bit bitter, but perfect. The mouthfeel is good, crisp up front, sticky and lingers on the top of the mouth well after your last sip. So good you'll want more despite the relatively strong taste and higher alcohol. Lovely.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ericj551,4.5,"Stone IPA pours a slightly hazy yellow orange with a thin head. Aroma is huge C hops, maybe Centennial and Amarillo, it is sweet and citrusy. Flavor comes on with sweet, fruity malt quickly followed by a nice rounded bitterness that leads in to more really citrusy hops. The hop flavor is sweet orange and ripe grapefruit. Overall a delicious and drinkable IPA, completely hiding its 7% abv. I've been meaning to pick this one up for a while now and I am not disappointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MICAMD,3.93,"A- A slightly cloudy golden/ yellow liquid fills the glass. Big streams of rising carbonation put on a great show and form a thick 1-finger thick white head. Leaves some great lacing all the way down the glass.  S- Very large amount of citrus with a dollop of pine tossed in. Very bready, with a bit of spice. Some noticeable bit of funkiness as well. Also hints of vegetable- sort of asparagus like.  T- Sweet, vegetable is much more noticeable in the flavor. Some bread, pine, citrus. Not a massive amount of depth to this and also not a huge malt backing- but hey, this is a west coast IPA.  M- This is what bothered me the most about this beer. It just felt so thin and light. Something felt like it was missing. Almost a bit metallic. But it was not cloying or harsh and did leave a clean aftertaste.  D- Overall a quality IPA. Not my favorite, but not disappointing by any means.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ndekke39,4.42,"Found his on-tap at a new restaurant in Columbus called Fabian's. I was impressed to find it there. Pours a clear, golden honey yellow with a thin white head. A tiny bit of retention and lacing on it. Smells and tastes aren't terribly strong (I have to admit that I'm approaching this beer having had Stone's Ruination and 10th Anniversary IPAs), but they're nice and balanced. Good blend of grapefruity hops, with a touch of honey, malty sweetness. Medium mouthfeel, a little carbonation - seems appropriate for the style. If you're looking for crazy hops, this is not the beer, but it's still a superior example of an IPA - well balanced, wonderful to drink. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kudashov,4.85,"Sports on Saturday could have been better . Red Sox lost , Yankees won . My horse "" Dominican "" had no shot at winning the derby pool and the NASCAR race was cancelled . Pour into a pint glass the copper color and the aroma of hops is inviting . The off- white head lasts . Amber color is clear when held up to light . I love the Ruination for the piney , hoppy , grapefruity flavor . Hophead ? I have been on a quest to try all the different IPA's from different brewers but this is where it might end . This is a tough call for me . Ruination or this IPA . Christ !! Drinkability is a 5 and this will be in my fists today when Curt Schilling takes the mound for the Sox . Mixed in with some golf , and the Rangers vs. Sabres hockey game .   Again , my sports day was not that great but finding a beer with this wonderful flavor turned my sports Saturday around ,",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BBM,4.35,"Poured a clear gamboge into a pint glass, with a frothy white head. Aroma was pleasant, of grassy and earthy hops, and a bit of sweetness.  Now this is an IPA. Where other beer try to lean too much on hops, Stone gets the balance just right. There is a plenty big hop character here, comprising much of the flavor. Citrus (a nice lemon zest, if I do say so myself), pine, earthiness, are all on the palate. However, this is offset by a wonderful maltiness that compliments these bitter flavors. Mouthfeel is also very clean, and there's a dry finish. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, I had no idea it was close to 7%. Overall this is the best standard IPA I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,quikfish13,4.17,"Straight out of the 12 ounce bottle this IPA poured remarkebly clear. Settling into my glass with a hazy orange tinted gold body and a foamy off white head. Highly carbonated.  Aroma was overwelming with hops. Highly sweet aroma that is very friendly to the nose. I can actually still smell the citrus hops from here with my glass sitting next to me. Orange and grapefruit come to mind.  Nice warm upfront bitternes in the taste that just kisses the tounge. More earthy and malty flavors come through in the middle with a smooth bitter and hoppy finish. Smooth with a nice bitter bite that doesnt take away from the rest of the beers.  A medium body feel for the mouth, not to heavy and not to light. Very smooth going down.  Highly drinkable, I'm trying to resist drinking the rest of this 6-pack before I go to work.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mebuzzard,4.33,"It was a night of drinking bottles of brews I have already had on tap. This was number 2, after Rogue Choc.Stout. Pours a nice, semi-hazed, crisp looking amber. Medium head, white, that oozed citrus aromas. Taste is very clean, not an overwhelming citrus flavor to it, but enough to convince you that it's an A-IPA. Floral whaffs also affect the taste buds. Really nice balance considering the style between the hops, malt and their by-product offerings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bozebus17,3.87,"Poured a very hazy light orange. There is little head or lacing to speak of.  Scent is all hops here. Smells crisp, and a bit citrus-like.  One sip of this and there is no doubt about it being an IPA. A strong hop bitterness washes over the palatte and makes it beg for mercy. There is little malt to speak of.  This beer is medium bodied. It feels slightly creamy. Alcohol is noticeable and leaves a tingling on the tongue. The finish is not clean and leaves a lingering bitterness on the tongue (I'm not saying its a bad thing).  A very good IPA, but one I don't think I'd drink all of the time. Be warned, this one is all hops. If you don't like bitter beers you'd better stay away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DGryger,4.2,"Appearance: Aggressive pour into pint glass yields coarse three finger white head above a hazy golden straw body. Decent lacing and head retention.  Smell: Heavy resinous hops with slight fruity notes. A little grassy as well.  Taste: Pleasantly hoppy without being overly bitter. Big notes of oily pine resin backed up by fruity citrus. Slight spice and pepper notes. Slight bitter tea with hone and lemon aftertaste. Interesting.  Mouthfeel: Very light and almost witte-like. A little too sharp on the palette, carbonation could be turned down a little. Crisp.  Drinkability: Quite drinkable, I think that this is a beer that I could get used to drinking on a regular basis.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,albern,3.65,"The beer is a golden orange with a very frothy head. There is more than lacing on the glass, almost clumps of left over head. The smell is aromatic, sweet, a bit citrusy, not too much hoppy smell. The taste is clearly imbalanced towards the hops. When the beer warms a bit, you can taste some malt, citrus, less hoppiness, some grassiness. When its colder, the hops are just too pronounced for my tastes. The mouth feel is a bit creamy, and you can feel the hop bite in the middle, end, and aftertaste. The aftertaste is not overwhelmingly bitter but you will know that the brewers didn't spare the hops. If you love hoppy IPA's you're going to like this beer. I'm becoming less interested in them, but it's just a matter of preference for me.

147,88,tommy78,4.1,"The beer's appearance is a clear, orange colour with tiny bubbles consistently rising from the bottom and a good amount of head at the top. The beer's smell is rooted in citrus aroma. You could barely tell of any hops in the aroma. As for the taste, the aroma translates very well. A sweet, citrus taste with a light bounce on the palate. The mouth feel reveals little carbonation. I found this surprising since halfway down the glass, tiny bubbles still rose to the top. Given that mouth feel is light, I could drink this every night in the warm Spring weather. Maybe that is why I enjoyed this brew when I used to live in SoCal. This IPA is highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,geexploitation,4.75,"Pours a just-shy-of-clear bright amber color, with golden highlights and a big, dense head of white foam that leaves tons of lace. Huge aroma of American hops -- citrus and pine sap and metals. There's a nice, sweet blood orange note in there. Only the slimmest hint of amber malts makes it through. On the palate, the mouthfeel is extremely smooth considering all the hops in this thing. Carbonation is biting but fine-bubbled. The taste is extraordinary, and precisely what you would want in an American IPA. It's almost harshly bitter, but the malt payload is enough to keep things smooth, albeit still massively imbalanced. In the midst of all those citrus and metallic notes is a notable lack of acrid fusel oils or any other detracting byproducts of massive hop bitterness. Overall, this is an incredible IPA. It's big and brash, but not out of whack in its flavors and aromas... huge, imbalanced, but still drinkable, which is a pretty remarkable achievement.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,udubdawg,4.45,"22 oz bomber. Can't recall having this one before.  Pours a slightly haze light amber/yellow color. A very large white head forms quickly at first, and more slowly on the 2nd glass. Retention on both was very good, with plenty of interesting patterns of lacing. Gorgeous.  Nose is fantastic, floral with some added citrus - some sweetness, but it is behind the earthy, grapefruit, citrus peel and pine aromas. Malt? - it doesn't stand a chance here.  Woah. Probably poured this a bit too cold the first time. Below the proper temperature this is heavily bitter, and much of the flavor struggles to come out and I'm wondering who snuck the ESB in my bottle. However once at the proper serving temperature the true flavor of this beer asserted itself nicely. 70+ IBU's? Every one has made itself known, yet the overall flavor is very good and far from one dimensional - it is fruity, with a sweetness that nicely accentuates that bitterness, and light bready malts that weren't noticeable in the aroma. No noticeable alcohol here. Finish is drying with more bittering - the overall flavor is more bitter than AleSmith IPA, but the finish is less bitter. This makes me enjoy the medium-bodied mouthfeel more, and there is ample carbonation but well short of harsh or spritzy.  In terms of the style, this falls just short of AleSmith in flavor, but I love the extra bitterness and that's about it for IPAs I'd perhaps choose over this. Crisp and refreshing as hell, can't wait to have another!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mikesgroove,4.03,"A - Poured a hazy bright orange with a big frothy pillow like white head. Very slow fade and nice retention left a good bit of lace on the top.  S - Smell was initially very sweet with lots of citrus hops. Light but not overly so that it would be a detrimentalal factor. Smell was not overly bitter and had no hint of any alcohol whatsoever. As it warmed a slight grain or bread like feel started to come out. Not bad, not over the top.  M & T - Very smooth crisp, clean and refreshing. Nice carbonation. The hop profile on this one is very sweet. Lots of orange, tangerine, creamy like flavors. Not your typical super bitter west coast hop bomb. Very drinkable and overall very enjoyable. Much balance to this as the malt character was really brought out to the fore front  D - Overall extremely enjoyable and totally sessionable IPA.

147,88,jdg204,4.63,"Finally pulled the trigger on a 6-Pack of my first Stone product, after having a hankering for some IPA. There was a lot of hype with these products, could this brew live up to the high standards?  Appearance - Just gorgeous, rich orange color with a deep cloudy textrue. Lovely, thick white head tops it all off.  Smell - Very nice floral, citrus aroma with a deep spicey undertone.  Taste - Fantastic bold grapefruity/orange flavor with superbly balanced hops. The hops really do a great job of balancing the sweetness/power of the fruit flavors with a great bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - The consistency of the flavor is great and the aftertaste really leaves the mouth satisfied. The brew really packs a punch without being too ""in your face"".  Drinkability - This brewhaha just flat out ruled. Definetly going to have to check out the rest of the Stone line of ales after this winner and on a side note the bottle is top quality too (etched graphics over a pasted label=top notch).

147,88,BeerTruth,4.39,"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appeared a very nice foggy straw color with thin head that died down a bit after pour. Lacing was quite sticking and grainy that retained throughout. Smell was excellent, I absolutely can't stop taking whiff after whiff of this brew. Such a clean and crisp scent of grapefruit with a hint of evergreen pine. I would definitely burn a candle with this smell! Taste wasn't what I expected from the smell, but it was still good. Hops are there, but not overpowering. Grassy spice with a piney zest. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth for an IPA, very subtle bitter bite. The yeasty finish balances this beer out almost perfectly. Such a good job designing this brew. Great IPA, I wish I tried it earlier but I was too distracted by Arrogant Bastard and Ruination. Stone ""wow's"" again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,awall422,4.39,"Got a bottle of this at East Gate Liquors in Wilmington last thursday. After finishign it off, I was glad I chose it. It poured a light orange, mostly yellow with a thick, creamy head. Lacing was nice and the aroma was great. Seemed mostly piney on my nose. Initial taste was bitter, but mellowed on the way down and was slightly sweet, but not enough to let you forget you're drinking a west coast IPA style beer. Really nice IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jbsteiny,4.48,"Mmm mmm. I love me a Stone IPA -- here's why:  Not much to look at -- brassy gold, foamy head which dissipates quickly. Smells fantastic -- citrus (pineapple/grapefruit) and pine -- the hops aren't overwhelming like some other IPAs because of the sweet sweet malt. Tastes nearly as good -- this is a real cornacopia of hop tastes -- spice, citrus, bitters, and more citrus (in that order), which somehow drops off, leaving you with a sweet piney, slightly bitter finish. A remarkable beer. Fine carbonation and a creamy body make it very drinkable. Three cheers for Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wingman14,4.25,"Pours a light yellow with a frothy white head that fades quickly. The smell is dominated by a floral aromas of hops. This one is dry hopped to give the added aroma to the beer. The taste is not as hoppy as the smell but still very large. The taste starts sweet and hoppy and is followed by the bitter taste, which isn't very strong considering the amount of hops in the smell and taste. A decent amount of carbonation and a great balance make this beer an easy drinker for any hop head. A great brew from a great brewery, check this one out! Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FlyFisher2782,4.15,"Brew starts off with a fantastic amount of frothy off white head and a beautiful lighter tint pale color.  Smell is dominated by the floral hop presence and the taste follows suit.  Pale, dry and straw flavored malt starting off follows into a perfect amount of bitterness for a stock IPA. Not overdone here. Carbonation was a little lacking perhaps because of a vigorous pour.  Overall a great rendition of its style, definitely focuses more on the floral hop variety and its dry malt backbone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AltBock,3.99,"I got their little 12 oz. 6 pack bottle version. It has all the usual silk-screened Stone artwork, except this one has a lime green square around the kneeling Stone gargoyle. The back has a silk-screened lime green square with the definition of the word gargoyle, information about the beer and Stone's Philosophy. Usually the back of their bottle just has silk-screened gibberish, but this one was kept down to a minimum due to the size of the little 12 oz. bottle.  When poured into a simple mug, the beer was a hazy metallic honey orange with a thin layer of white bubbly foam that was supposed to act as the head of foam. It fizzled away into a small trace of white bubbly rings and lace around the mug. When I first popped the cap, It smelled like I twisted the cap off a bottle of Pine Sol. I didn't know if I was suppose to drink it or clean the floors with it. When it settled in the mug, the strong aroma of Pine Sol was still there, as well as some citrus hops and a hint of citrus fruits in the background. It tasted like somebody started growing grapefruits on pine trees and you took one of those trees and shoved one into your mouth. It was that piney and citrusy! Behind the grapefruit pine tree was a few other citrus fruits, citrus hops, and just the slightest hint of toasted malt at the end. The mouthfeel was very crisp with a strong aftertaste of sharp pine needles and citrus hops. It also completely masks it alcohol content. Pine and citrus hops conquers all! Overall a very good citrusy and piney IPA. I don't think I've had an IPA that was so strong in pine and citrus. I think I should have bought their 22 oz. bomber bottle because this little 12 oz. bottle doesn't go very far. If you like eating pine trees, then give IPA a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Appearance: Dark golden with quickly dissipating head Smell: Hoppy and citrusy Taste: Blast of hops up front with the expected bitter bite towards the end. Notes of citrus fruit present. Clean is the keyword here; this beer also tastes quite balanced for its hop kick. The hop presence here is not outrageous, but strong. Mouthfeel: Hops bite you early, but the beer feels smooth. Drinkability: Quite drinkable, though I probably would not put down more than a couple of these in a night. This is yet another beer to savor and enjoy over a good conversation.

This is a beautiful beer.  S: I pick up strong hop aroma and some sweetness. I dont detect spice but this could jsut be me.  T: Extremely smooth especially for an ipa. This might be my new favorite IPA. There is a rush of hop flavor flowed by slight sweet/bitter notes. All well balanced and all delicious. It blends very well together.

Mouthfeel is smooth with a full crisp froth around the palate. The taste is of citrus pith, pulpy fruit, some bready grains, an aggressive bitterness, sprucey, and hot spicy hops. The subtle sweet malt balances well with a honey sweetness. The finish is dry, bready, floral/herbal character and a lasting hoppy spice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerZack,4.13,"Golden orange color only slightly hazy, fairly clear when warming up. Very appetizing look and smell. There are aromas of citrus and spicy herbacious pine over a sweet maltiness. Sweet maltiness and mild grapefruit leads to herbal spiciness in the hop finish. Nice soft mouthfeel keeps the hop acidity from being overwhelming. While not a well balanced IPA overall (definately leans towards hop bitterness), Stone IPA seems to be more balanced than many hop-bursting American IPAs. I find this IPA a little easier to drink than some of the more heavier-bodied IPAs... gets me the hop fix without filling me up on 1 pint (or 22oz bottle)!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Nose: Even in the bar, you can smell the citrus,mostly orange rind, pineapple, hop bomb.  Taste mimics the nose. Citrus hops dominate. Just a sweet taste of malt, but helps alot lending some balance. Bitterness is tamer than expected, but the hop flavors are all over. Fresh orange juice, pineapple, grassy. Fruity and earthy.  Mouth felt medium and creamy. Excellent.  Super easy to drink. Sampled in 2 different bars and nose was incredible, in both a crowded smokin' spot and an empty lunch crowd.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,matthewfuchs,3.42,"Cloudy bright amber in color. Powerful hops aroma, some citrus coming through. The taste is not as hoppy as it smells. I guess the bark is worse than the bite.

147,88,Absumaster,4.35,"Thanks to todd1 for this!  An orange, clear beer with a small, bubbly head.  Smell of grapefruit and oranges, spicy with some straw. There is malt there, but subdued and only supporting the hops.  Taste of US hops, spicy grapefruit and a slight resinous, oily hop taste. Bitterness is pretty clean. The malts are not upfront, but come in second to the hops. Maltiness is also mild and pleasing. The yeast gives a clean profile, no real fruitiness or spiciness. Carbonation is a little too much, rolling the beer in my mouth, a lot of gas comes out. Body is medium and the beer is slightly sticky, but not as sticky and full-bodied as other IPAs. Very good balance!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chrisms86,4.3,"Another delicious brew from Stone. To be honest I generally think their beers are overrated, so a good review means something extra coming from me.  Pours a cloudy yellow with a somewhat sticky head that sticks around. Appears almost flat with only a few sparse bubbles rising to the surface.  Smells strongly of hops (obviously). Really nothing too distinct about the smell, typical of this style.  Tastes absolutely delicious. It has that hoppy bite that comes with the style, but doesn't overdue it and there is a pleasant malt flavor underneath that carries very well. The bite is enough to tell you its an IPA but not so much that it isn't an easy drinker. Thin yet still frothy mouthfeel that along with the balanced taste make this one of the easiest drinking IPAs I've ever had. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

S: Spicy hops dominate the aroma. There is some fruit sweetness present as well.  T: As strong as the hops are in the nose, it's nowhere near as strong it tastes. It's surprisingly hoppy, even for an IPA. While there's a mild malt backbone, it's still a tad unbalanced... not a bad thing.  M: Not as thick as a DIPA, it's still pretty thick for an IPA.  D: I doubt I could have more than two of these. The tastebuds get a real workout with this beer.  Stone IPA is a fine example of the style.

Taste: hops definitely take the cake in this brew but there is also a nice medium maltiness that balances the brew out nicely. crisp fruity hop flavor, a little piney on the front of the tongue and then a nice sturdy hop bitterness on the back end. this is it for me when it comes to ipas. as kramer would say, welcome to flavor country.

147,88,MrHungryMonkey,4.15,"Light yellow/orange/amber color, mostly clear. A few particles of debris, look like hop or yeast. Moderate head, nice and fluffy/bubby, lasts for a while and laces appropriately. Nice carbonation.  Mmmm, American hops. Heavily citric and floral with piney and spicy notes. Under lies a malty sweet toffee/nut base. Light roasted sugar vibe. Mostly hops though.  Not as strong as the smell would let on. Medium bodied and smooth. Ample hop flavors and bitterness yield a tart fruitiness. Low malt flavor gives backbone without taking the spotlight. Nut, biscuit, grain, toffee/caramel, and toasted notes. Roasted barley flavor hiding deep within gives a woody feeling. Yeasty flavors, some kind of bitter & nutty & spice-like. Mild phenolic taste, maybe brought about through all those hops. Notable warmth, gives a sharp twang. Very mild carbonation and thicker than average viscosity to go with the smoothness. Finishes bitter and tart, medium dry. Slight metallic edge creeps into at.  Textbook American IPA. I am most impressed with the head which never died, 20 ounces into it and there are still small mounds of head covering the entire surface. Bravo. Smells heavenly. Taste is on the mark, well balanced and quite drinkable. I think I would like it better with a little more hop flavor and a little less bitterness. Overall, though, this is a nice brew. Subtle and surprisingly alcoholic. If you were to calibrate your tongue for AIPA, Stone would be the tare it seems.  With the last sip I consumed the head, this is the mark of a great head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,raid765,4.35,"Pours a golden haze, with an unexpectedly dense head that holds it own all the way down the pint glass. The smell reveals the lemony character of the hops, which are well placed and bold, but not overpowering. A subtle malt undertone creates a complex balance between the two that gives the beer a great drinkability. Carbonation is lower than most IPAs. The depth of the malt/hop balance, along with the smooth delivery, make for a very enjoyable brew. The aftertaste is a ringing endorsement of the lemony character present in the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SuncrestBeerMen,4.62,"A very nice IPA. One of my favorite and I have tried quite a few. Come to think of it, I think its time for another.

147,88,yelterdow,3.76,"As fresh of a bottle I could find here in North Jersey... enjoy by date of 4/10/07, purchased at Total Wine & More in River Edge. A steal at $4.99 for a bomber.  Served at fridge temperature in a pint glass.  Appearance- *Glugs* a hazy, pale gold color into the glass... the crisp, soapy head is snow white and persistent at two full fingers thick. Even after several minutes standing, the dollop of foam is still fat and stalwart... the lacing is sticky and wonderful.  Smell- Fantasic hop aroma from the dry-hopping... it's simple but strong and enticing. That's what it's all about here.  Taste- Surprisingly on the blander side... not at all like what I remember when sampling this last summer. The hops and malts are still nicely balanced with a bolder statement, but the resiny character just isn't there. It's easy drinking for a Stone beer, and the bitterness (as always) is drying and crisp. Great finish on this one.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lightly carbonated going in, it never gets interesting enough to best highlight the hop and malt features to its potential. It's a flavorful, fresh hop fix for sure... and the burps are frequent and quite tasty, actually... but not the gem of an IPA I recall not long ago.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jwaks,3.9,"Serving 12oz bottle  A finger thick yellow tinted frothy cap perches on a pale golden body showing a slight chill haze and light carbonation. Several rings of laces adorn the glass as the head slowly settles into a thick cover of course off-white bubbly froth.  A mildy aromatic nose reveals pungeant lemon, citrus zest and spicy floral aromas upfront with a hints of ripe melon and a dash of pale malt. This is well focusted showcasing the dry hops while not offering much else.  Flavors of juicy lemon and citrus zest are subdued throughout with faint ripe melon flavors and a bit of pale malt popping in the mid palate and finish. Greater concentration would be a great benefit.  Slick, well balanced and fairly full on the palate, this brew sports a great mouthfeel and a small kick of lemon zest and pale malt on the moderately long finish.  This goes down easy due to surpreme balance, palatable flavors and a silky medium body. Drink up!  This is yet another solid and enjoyable brew from Stone.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Citrus undertones definitely buttress the bitterness. Alcohol is masked very well. Definitely has a light feel to it. Great IPA.  Mouthfeel/drinkability: This brew is light and very smooth. Nice carbonation level. Definitely one of the few Stone brews that I could session. I could drink this all night.

147,88,rattech,4.6,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: a rich golden yellow with a really nice 1-2 cm head that dissipates down to a 1 cm head. It forms a really nice head, it is really a vibrant and appealing beer.  Smell: Pine and citrus. I smell a touch of sweetness. I have had a few IPAs this one smells quite appealing. The smell does get weaker a minute or so after the pour.  Taste: After taking the first taste, I realize it may be a bit warmer then it should be  my thermometer reads 51 F, so I suppose it is just a touch too warm. The hops are there and they add a nice citrus-pine flavor but there is also quite a bit of sweet malt as well. This beer is phenomenal, I was expecting it to be more intense then it is, but I was really happily surprised. There is defiantly a good touch of hop bitterness in the background.  Mouthfeel: Good solid carbonation, moderately thick texture, I would consider this to have a good mouthfeel  Drinkability: This is almost 7% ABV? Wow. I am not prepared to drink another one (no more in the fridge) and I only have 5 left next time I go back to MI I may be picking up another 6 pack, or a case this beer could easily become a new favorite.

Citrus and pine hoppiness is what i get. there is a little pepper to it as it warms in my mouth with a little bit of artificial fruit flavors. Aftertaste has a nice bitterness to it with just a touch of maltiness that barely lingers below the dominant hops. I also get a small amount of caramel sweetness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel. Body is crisp and medium. The balance is very nice in a way that the malts do not play much of a role in the flavor characteristics, yet stick out to make a very nice balance. Carbonation is a little bit lower than others.  Overall, a insanely drinkable beer. the lower carbonation makes this slide right down. a great and well crafted beer that doesnt prove itself by overdoing the bitterness (though they advertise they do).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Shiloh,4.3,"This brew arrived a nice cross between a golden/yellow and amber colours. The head is thin as is the full island lace, some glass cling is also evident. The body is cloudy and the carbination is of large bubbles which seem never ending. Aroma strongly of citrus, grapefruit and lime. The mouthfeel is of a full bodied ale and warming.

Hoppy, spicy, pine aroma. Not as citrus/tropical fruit as some IPA/DIPA's I've had recently. I liked that it had more of these other hop qualities in addition to the citrus. Much like smelling fresh American hops.  Taste is sweet, then quickly bitter with a piney hop flavor. This is followed by some bready malt and finishes dry and balanced.

147,88,cooncat,4.83,"Serving was from a 12 oz. bottle well within date, and served in a pint glass.  A vigorous pour produces a beautiful 2 fingered creamy head, slightly off-white, which produces great sheets of sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The color is a deep gold, very deep, almost to the point of copper.  The nose is wonderfully hoppy, and I detect loads of piney and citrusy (orange peel) hops. The nose is HUGE.  At the top of the glass, you are first assaulted by the strong piney/citrusy hop character, which, to me, is what you should expect from a good IPA. Carbonation is right on, not too fine, or not too bold, but just right. Midway through the glass, as the beer warms, a gentle hint of bready maltiness makes itself apparent. It is, in my opinion, a wonderful balance. As you finish, the dry hoppiness prevails, but it is not objectionable, and the bready maltiness is still there. The finish is ""picture perfect"", with no lingering bad after taste, and a fresh dryness one expects from a good IPA. IPAs are one of my favorite styles, and this one might be the best IPA I've ever had (and that's saying something!) Drinkability is exceptional. I could drink these all night long, but would savor each and every sip. A truly wonderful IPA experience to be appreciated by all.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RidiculedDisplay,3.9,"Probably my, what, fiftieth go-around with Stone IPA? Stone's beers (I'm not complaining) are extremely easy for me to come by. That being said, I recently held myself to stop my recent round of ""coveted rare beerz"" reviews and start reviewing those favorites I have tried, but didn't review. So this review is in that spirit.  Appearance: Pours with a one and half finger lively frothy head. Lacing is about medium-level quality - doesn't always catch, but when it does, it produces some wonderful patterns. The body is probably the let-down - no beauty to speak of, unless you like yellow straw. Still, it's a session beer, not a masterpiece.  Smell: Aroma is lightly and freshly hoppy. Grassy hops are the most prominent aromas, followed by pine. Citrus is very subdued, I've found, in Stone IPA relative to some other IPA's, but it's there. There's also a barley/straw/corn scented malt backbone that lightly holds up the hops. A clean aroma.  Taste: Citrus is more prominent in the flavor. Light orange rind, followed by some pine-y and slightly grassy hop flavors. A little fruity citrus backbone that melds with the existing malt. A bit more impressive than the aroma, but again it's light, clean, refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Essentially how a beer ""should feel"" in terms of carbonation. There when you need it, hidden when you don't want it to overpower your taste buds. Frothy.  Drinkability: A massively sessionable IPA that, I would argue, is the flagship session beer of the craft beer world. It gets the point across - this is a sessionable beer that does not yank or push, but retains a sense of easibility and likeability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beveritt,3.87,"Presentation: Poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass. The bottle displays the Stone gargoyle in the standard painted on label.  Appearance: Pours with about 3/4 inch of almost pure white head. This settles slowly into a thin coating of foam and a ring around the glass. The beer itself is light amber in color and fairly hazy.  Smell: Smells strongly of dry hopping. Floral hop aromas icluding lemon, orange and honey.  Taste: Upfront floral hops with a citrus bite. Good malt undertones, almost a little sweet. FInish is biiter, but not overly so.  Mouthfeel: Slightly less than average carbonation level. Body is average to a little thin.  Drinkability: A well balanced drink, suprising from Stone. A good example of the style without falling prey to the notion that everything must be extreme.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rallison,4.55,"A: Light golden color with a two finger white head that really stays around.  S: Wonderful citrusy hops are on the forefront of this. Very fresh smell also. Definitely smells like a West Coast IPA!  T: Very clean, fresh hop flavor. Definitely hop-forward with piney/citrusy hops. Not much in the way of a malt backbone - just enough to push the hops forward. Not aggressively hoppy - just enough to showcase them. Clean taste too. Very nicely done, and very west coast.  M: Lighter body, with a nice level of carbonation to carry the flavors. Dry finish. Makes this refreshing and very drinkable.  D: Eminently drinkable. You won't get tired of drinking this.  Stone's IPA is a classic West Coast IPA. There may be IPAs I enjoy more, but this is basically a flawless example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ArrogantB,3.53,"09/04/08 22oz  I had to re-review this to be fair. The only hop presence seems to be a very strong bitterness. Maybe I got a bad bottle but this sure was a disappointing IPA and I used to really like it.  12 oz bottle which I poured into a ruination mug. The color is dark yellow and almost clear. The smell is wonderful but not overwhelming. I think I can smell grapefruit, but better than grapefruit (cause I don't like grapefruit). The taste is slightly bitter and the mouthfeel is pleasant. This beer goes down way too easy and that is why it is one of my favorites. This is yet another winner from the good folks down in San Diego.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Georgiabeer,3.95,"Pours a light golden with a frothy white head that leaves some decent lacing. The smell is of orange and grapefruit citrus with a little bit of spiciness. The taste is mostly spicy hops up front and some attenuated malt at the finish. A bit grainy, but fairly balanced. The hop profile doesn't blow me away,but its solid. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and with a good carbonation level. Its a little rough in the mouth, it could stand to be smoothed out a bit. Good solid IPA, quite drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,guitarmage,4.42,"Appearance: Nice bubbly golden, slight chill haze, may have been the glass, white foam with decent retention.  Smell: If you're in the mood for an IPA, this hits the spot. Hop oils are about all I could smell, nice juicy hops.  Taste: Malt is not very present, the juicy hops consume the palette and stay for the whole ride. The hops are not too spicy, they're smooth and bitter, cut right through whatever you eating.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and full bodied, carbonation is fizzy and cleansing.  Drinkability: Top notch IPA, stands out for the hops, not much toastiness or other flavors, this beer is about the hops. It went very well with my rack of herb crusted lamb, it cut through the fattiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,westweasel,3.46,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber bottle.  Appearance - The beer poured out a nice hazy, golden, light amber color with a one-inch bright white head that sticks to the glass on the way down.  Aroma - I'm getting a soft citrus scent - grapefruit - and a light floral smell. the smell is predominantly biscuits and bread.  Taste - This beer is very well-balanced - It has a strong bitter aftertaste, that reminds me of noble hops. I'm also getting a light lemony taste. The majority of the up-front flavor is a strong malty bread taste.  Mouthfeel - Medium with a noticeable bitter dry finish.  Drinkability - Very good. I'm not a big noble hops fan, so I probably wouldn't drink many of these at one time. Good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tyrawlings,4.1,On tap poured into a pint glass.  A: Bright amber with orange hues around the edge of the glass. A huge fluffy white two fingered head stays for the entire pour. Sticky lacing is all over the glass.  S: Soft perfumed flowers. Citrus and pine resin. Wet hops.  T: Juicy wet citus and pine hops that blast into a medicinal or bitter herb bite. Grassy or earth like residue. Citus fruits are followed by a perfect blending of malts. Yeast or biscut like finish and more wet hops.  M: Smooth and very clean. Medium carbonation. Dry and clean.  D: This is a classic West Coast IPA. Rock solid in the balance catagory. Insanely drinkable! Highly recommended.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kevinhulit,4.29,"goldish-yellow in color with a mostly white head, then simmers quickly but not before you can taste its airy, piney flavor. looks very mellow, little carbonation.  smells good, nothing out of the ordinary for an IPA.  Tastes very good.... balanced, not too too hopped as i was expectioning (like an IPA Tripel or something), but hoppy enough.  great mouth feel, light or airy, and it coats everything (much like while in the glass also) which is nice because you don't have to chug it down for satisfaction, although i am..

147,88,GbVDave,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a gorgeous hazy amber with a 1 1/2 finger head that retains forever.  S: Strong grapefruit initially. As it warms aromas of orange, peach, and pine emerge. Mildly sweet malt in the nose as well.  T: Huge bitter citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange) up front. Nice resinous pine sap hop presence in the middle and finish. All this bitter goodness is kept in check by a sweet yet dry biscuit malt flavor.  M: Dry and oily. The hop resins coat EVERYTHING in the mouth. You taste this beer long after the last drop.  D: Whew, scary. Goes down too easy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,oakbluff,4.5,Pours out with a wheaty head- not much lacing to speak of. Smell is very floral. Taste is grapefruit and pineapple. Medium carbonation with a refined moutfull- smooth malts and that great fruit hops. Aftertaste is all hops.  All in all this is a class leading IPA. I could drink this the rest of my life and be a happy guy. Too bad the closest distriution is a several hundred miles away.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Eirerate,4.33,"Poured from a 22 oz. into a favorite mug producing a nice, thick, foamy head which stuck around for most of the drink. The aroma was a very strong citrus aroma (which though not my cup 'o tea was still pleasant. Mouthfeel was very pleasant with just a hint of alcohol warmth.

This beer fills the room with its aroma. Limes, citrus, and pine. This brew has an incredible aroma.  T:Taste follows the aroma with a huge hop presence. Citrusyand piney from the hops, and sweet from the ethanol.  M:Medium body with slick mouthfeel. Carbonation tingles on your tongue,, a nice complement to the hoppy bitterness.  D: If I had the money, this beer would be in my house at all times. A must try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,schusterbauer,4.5,"i've been holding off on reviewing this, in order to consume it a number of times, and form thoughts independent of hype. speaking of the hype -- does the beer live up to it? if not, then damned close.  appearance is classy, a pale apricot/brassy complexion, with a fluffy white head and significant lacing. smell is of very fresh, very citric hops, and toasted malts as an afterthought. taste is fresh, and pretty wonderful. the hops are bitter/strong/refreshing, but they don't mask the fact that the ale underneath is of fine quality, with plenty of toasted bread yeastiness. i wish i could try the ale in its early formulation, before getting its hop fix! light and crisp in the mouth.  interestingly, the toasty ale flavors seem to finish on at the front of the tongue, with the hops finishing in rear corners of the mouth. seeing that this is precisely how taste buds work naturally, i think this is a ringing natural endorsement of this beer and its ingredients.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mcallister,4.32,"Clear, clean, amber/copper with a thick frothy white head. Good retention. What you expect from Stone.  Sweet piney hops with a citrusy back burst. Hops are really sweet and flowery and gives the impression that this is going to be a resiny hop coating palate drencher. Can't wait! Hints of malt on the underlyings as well.  Very fruity. Full of ctirusy, floral hops with hints of grassy, pine on the back mid palate. Nectarine, mush melon, slight mango. Balanced by a thin layer of malt that endeavors a clean integrated finish. Speaking of the finish, nice length, not overly bitter, so fruity it gives the impression there is some RS. If there is it's not much.  Medium carbonated and prickly mouthfeel. Delicously drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheDeuce,4.97,"Wow...  Appearance-big headed goodness comes out of the bottle, light color head booms up but remarkably settles afterwards into the glass, good looking beer.  Smell-hoppy as all get out, alcohol is totally hidden by hoppiness no other aromas to speak of, smells like it was just brewed a second ago.  Taste/Mouthfeel-amazing, easy drinking, substantial hop flavor but no burn or rashness, balanced with a dash of malt, maintains a light texture but still substantial. Even those who don't like hoppy beers or are just starting on them would probably like this.   Drinkability-easy to drink, clean finish except for a small trace of hops, just how you would want to do it, 7% alcohol for those who don't know.  Overall-Simply put one of the best IPAs I've ever had, it's taken me forever to try Stone beers and now that I've had one I can't wait to try more. Astoundingly good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigreduw64,4.24,"Poured out of a 22 oz bomber into a wide bowled wine glass. Pours a golden amber color. The aroma is of straight up hops. It smells as though I will be eating hops, it makes me a little afraid for what it will taste like.  Surprisingly the taste is not as hoppy as the smell lets on. It is very balanced, but still has a strong hop flavor.  I enjoy this beer and when in the mood for an IPA this would be on my list of ones to buy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bringonthehops,4.72,"And now to write my very first Beer Advocate beer review...and about maybe the most dependable American IPA out there, nonetheless!!  Serving: 12 oz bottle (strong) poured into a Stone pint glass  Appearance: Quite clear, more so than I prefer my IPA's to be...butterscotch color with an off-white foamy head (my strong pour gave me almost 3 fingers).  Smell: Aaahh! This is what an IPA should smell like!! Grapefruit, with floral undertones. Before you even taste a sip, it's readily apparent that this beer is heavily hopped!  Taste: If you don't like ""bitter"" beers, you can stop reading this review right now. For the rest of you, here we go: this is what IPA should taste like. Being the average hop-head, I make it my mission to try every single IPA that I come across. Although I've technically had ""better"" IPA's, all of the ""better"" IPA's I've had have been specialty brews. This is the best regular-ol'-IPA that I've ever had. Bitter hops wrap around the tip of your tongue before exploding across the rest of your mouth. The only other regular-ol'-IPA I've had that rivals this one is Bell's Two-Hearted Ale (brewed out of Kalamazoo, MI). Since I live in CA, I have constant access to this brew. Despite this, I find myself always coming back to it (and that's high praise from someone who prefers to try something new rather than stick with ""the same ol'."" But this IPA is just so good you can't resist buying it again and again and again.  Mouthfeel: A bit lighter than some of my other favorite IPA's, but what's lost in body is made up for in drinkability. The hops are most predominate on the front palate.  Drinkability: Considering this brew clocks in at 6.9% abv it's quite amazing that you can find yourself dissapointed they don't sell beers in 7-packs! Very drinkable for an IPA -- I attribute this beer's easy drinking to the fact that it is only medium-bodied, and not heavy, like some other great IPA's.  If you live in CA and reading this review, you probably already know about this beer...if you live outside of CA and can get your hands on this stuff, do it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jmalex,4.35,"I shared a bottle of this once before, but now it's time to sit down with one of my own and really see what this beer's got.  APPEARANCE: Pours a somewhat hazy gold into my Stone pint glass. Not much of a head despite a vigorous pour. The head dissipates quickly but leaves a thin collar and large patch of lace.  SMELL: Bitter, pungent hops dominate the nose. Pine, flower, and grass can all be detected. This one smells like it packs some serious bite!  TASTE: Quite tame at first, but the hops aren't far behind. And boy do they show themselves! The same pungent smells carry over into the flavors with the addition of some bitter citrus. The bitterness quickly fades though, and transitions into a very clean finish.  MOUTHFEEL: Light bodied with a nice level of carbonation. This one doesn't leave a sticky film in your mouth like some other IPAs. Very nice.  DRINKABILITY: The clean finish and light body make this one very easy to drink. Maybe I'm so used to Double IPAs that this beer seems like nothing in comparison. But it's certainly far from nothing. This really is a great brew.  Stone comes through again. I've never had a beer of theirs that I didn't love and this is no exception. The hops show off their bitterness much more than their flavor and sweetness, and I can appreciate that. I'm just glad I had my own bottle this time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,flexabull,4.25,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet... here goes.  Pours a bright gold color, a bit of haze, a lot of carbonation, and a very nice head.  Beer smells very resin like, a bit of pine, and some floral aromas.  Flavors start with resiny pine hops, but it is quick and not overpowering. The hops then fade into a very creamy slighty sweet malt character. Finish is a bit tangy and crisp.  Mouthfeel is very nice, a very well rounded beer.  I forgot how good this IPA is. I need to pick this one up more often... especially now that the six packs are showing up here more often. Very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jokelahoma,4.57,"This one poured a very, very slightly hazy copper-gold color, with a fairly good sized head that stuck around for a good long while, and laced as it died. Nice appearance.  The nose of this beer is awesome. Even with my glass sitting on my computer desk and arm's length away, I can still smell the hops. There is little doubt this is an IPA. Hops are at the fore in the aroma, as they should be. Wonderful earthy, piney, vegetal hoppiness just overwhelms nearly any other aroma. Toward the end of the sniff, though, you get some sweetness that creeps in. It's got to be the malt, since you know, at 6.9%, there's quite a bit of that in here too. The smell is very appetizing and appealing, and definitely makes you want to drink it.  And wow, what an experience that drink is. Hops hit you immediately, and don't stop pummeling you throughout the entire process of drinking. They do, though, feel you're not being sufficiently beat down, so they call on their malty cousins to help finish the job. The aromas you get at first come through in the taste as well. The same earthiness, the same pine (which normally I do not like, but which works well here), the same raw vegetable... it's all here, and it's all at the forefront. Only about 2/3 of the way through the seduction of your tastebuds do you notice there's some sweetness there. Quite a lot, in fact. This beer isn't just hop juice. There's simply a lot of hoppy filigree on top of a good solid malt foundation. Placed together, you have a fantastic combination of flavors. This is, for all it's ""in your face"" hoppiness, a well balanced beer. Phenomenal.  Mouthfeel seems a tad on the thin side, but with a coating quality at the end of the drink that feels oily. A little more body and less coating would make this perfect. As it is, it's definitely passable.  Overall, this is one fantastic IPA. Very aggressively hopped, but not at the expense of balance or drinkability. At 6.9%, this is no session brew, but I've a feeling I could drink a lot of these before I realized I was hurting myself. I've yet to try a Stone beer I haven't absolutely loved, and this one kept that streak intact. Now I can only hope my travels take me into Stone distribution territory again soon. This is well worth looking for.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IgnatiusReilly,4.62,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle at home. The gargoyle is still one of my favorite brewery mascots.  A: Bright amber/gold with a little chill-haze. Nice thick head - lots of retention. S: Perfect for an IPA. All hops in the nose, pure and fresh - floral and citrus scents abound. T: Super hoppy, very bitter, piney. Lots of spiciness. The hop oil is the first to hit, followed by the strong alcohol - 6.9% is a lot for a straight up IPA. The malt sweetness comes through a little bit toward the end - some bready and sweet yeast flavorings. M: Oily and mouth-coating. Not so much a chewy feel usually found with a ton of malt. This one is more crisp. Very refreshing. D: Very easy. Only the high ABV keeps this from being a true session ale.  I love this beer.  I have to rank this as the best IPA I've reviewed so far.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChazMania,4.08,"Stone IPA was one of my early entree's into the hop world of which now I'm completely infatuated with.  A- this bottle poured orangy/peach color and nicely filled a pint glass with a 1/2 inch head.  S- crisp and floral from the get-go. I love this. My wife hates it....ok, more for me!  T- again, this was my entree into this hop fest world, and now I'm always chasing and trying any thing I can find in the DIPA/TIPA realm. When I'm chillin at home getting things done, this bottle always tastes good. It's in my top tier of single IPA's. (with greenflash, victory, alesmith, a few others).  M- crisp and refreshing  D- Can I have another? and another? and another?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Torchiest,4.24,"This is my first review.  Very light amber/golden color, small weak white head even with a semi-aggresive pour which disappeared immediately. Looks harmless enough.  Smells great, massive fresh hop aroma indiciative of the two weeks spent dry-hopping, somewhat fruity, grassy, floral, and pretty dank as well.  Extreme hop flavor, citrusy, sweetness and bitterness are very balanced, and in fact, doesn't seem all that bitter while drinking, although a hoppy bitterness lingers at the back of the tongue afterwards. Quite pleasant overall.  A bit thick, but smooth, and the carbonation is on target for the style. Nothing spectacular, but more than adequate.  This is very drinkable, one of the more drinkable IPAs I've tried. Goes down surprisingly easy for something which is approaching 7% ABV. Advise caution with this guy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,lehows,4.18,"Poured a light amber color with a small off-white head that faded down quickly. Stable aromas of floral hops, citrus, even some slight skunky quality in there. Taste shows more than the aromas with an even and refreshing hop bite (citrus, pine), perfect carbonation, very smooth and highly drinkable, especially for an IPA. Definitely recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,theopholis,4.55,"Appearance- Pours crystal clear light amber with a failry billowy head. Head has some staying power, but not to much. Very good lacing for an IPA.  Aroma- Interesting blend of floral hops and sourness. Can't identify the sour componant, but it smells great.  Taste- Very good balance between agressive flavoring hops, bittering hops and malt sweetness. This is a very sessionable IPA.  Mouthfeel- Thick for an IPA, but it works!!! Good carbonation level. Clings to the inside of your mouth, which is a good thing, because I love them hops!!!  Drinkability- Very drinkable for an IPA. The hops are very noticable without banging you over the head. One of the best IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Nipitato,4.15,"Picked up a bomber at Marty's Wine and Liqours in Allston, MA.  A:Deep golden color with nice white head.  S:Strong resinous hoppy aroma - piney.  T: High hop bitterness. Not resiny. Pretty clean taste for an IPA. Caramel malty backbone barely perceptable. Wish it was a little maltier. Hop flavor is citrusy but I also picked up a combo of pine/floral.  MF: Medium light body. Slightly astringent. Not too carbonated. Pretty clean and crisp for an IPA of such hoppiness.  D: I have no problem knocking a couple of these back. Arguably the premier West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,veech,4,"I haven't reviewed in a while so please forgive any rustiness.  A: Deep golden to light amber in color with abundant frothy head that is very resilient. Excellent lacing persists as one drinks their way through the beer. S: Hop oils dominate with a hint of pine needle astringence T: Very smooth but hoppy with bitterness that is balance. Minimal maltiness, but the hopped character is kept in check. The flavors are not just hops for hops sake in an IPA. M: medium bodied and smooth on the palate, very nice D: Not being a hophead I would limit myself to one a session, but could see how lupulin lovers could session this stuff. As expected, another well crafted offering from the boys in San Diego.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,StargherKing,3.72,"Color was a hazy amber color, lightening near the bottom of the glass and darker at the top. Head was full and fluffy, dissipated after a couple of minutes. Once poured, the beer had a slight floral hop scent, with a strong undercurrent of citrus, specifically something reminiscent of grapefruit. The taste was true to the description on the bottle, very bitter hops, with the grapefruit coming through as well. The mouthfeel was slightly crisp, with a good deal of carbonation. Considering the strong hop flavor, one would expect the beer to taste somewhat crisper, but it almost seemed dulled somehow. The drinkability is surprisingly good. I'm personally not a fan of the deep bitter flavor in this one, but I'm sure fans of the style would LOVE this beer. I would recommend it to fans of IPAs, but for me, I think I'll probably pass next time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Butch,4.62,"This is my first Stone beer. I cant buy them in Miss-sip because most (all?) of their beers are above the arbitrary 6.0% ABV law we have. My very good friend Derek is home for Christmas and brought me back a hell of a Christmas gift. Including two Stone IPAs.  Sampled 28 December 2006  The color to me was just IPA-Ale. I asked The Wife what color she would call that if she was picking it out to sew something and was talking to someone who had never heard of beer. She said dark honey so there you go. Dark honey in color.  The head was big and grand, and more aggressive than I expected. I screwed up the pour and had to let it settle a bit before pouring the last ounce or so. It eventually settled down to a nice disk that lasted the entire beer, leaving a nice but not thick lacing.  It smelled like all good IPAs should. Hoppy to the hilt. The back end showed that harsh bitterness that you expect.  The taste showed none of that harshness however. The smoothest IPA Ive ever had. Stone has a reputation for hyper-aggressive hops and flavor, but although this one was as strong as youd like it was still balanced well and the hops were bitter but not astringent. The kind of bitter an IPA should be.  A great beer. I cant say it was the best beer ever, or even the best IPA. Not that I think it isnt, but because I dont trust my opinion. Ive built Stone up in my mind so much that I just dont know how objective I can really be. I will definitely get more Stone every chance I get.  Butch",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,doppelmeup,3.46,"Honey yellow color with only a slight head. Lacing remains throughout.  Bit of skunkiness, reminding me of some pilsener beers I've had. Slight grapefruit. Not the best smelling IPA I've had.  Taste is ok. Moderately bitter with grapefruit flavors leading, followed by some sweet malt. As it warms, flavor improves.  Slightly sticky, slightly dry mouthfeel. ABV well hidden, goes down very easily.  Overall, a good beer from Stone but not all that memorable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,UncleJimbo,4.13,"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle.  This IPA poured a hazy, light amber color. The foam was flouffy and faintly yellow, and it persisted a long time and clinged to the inside of the glass. The smell was light floral hops with a little malt. The taste was malty and a touch sweet with moderate hoppiness. Alcohol was tasted, and there was a light hint of oxidation. The mouthfeel was smooth and hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. It was relatively clean. This was a good, easy to drink IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PhiloPsych,4.22,"Although IPA is not my favorite style, I must say this is a very good beer. Goes perfect with Indian food (which is what I paired it with for this review). The color is a pretty, clear, bright, light, pumpkin orange. The head is moderate and bubbly. It doesn't last long (though it doesn't dissipate immediately either), but leaves light lacing all the way down. The aroma is really great. The hops are very nice. The mouthfeel is full, almost creamy even, not watery at all. The carbonation is moderate with just the right amount of bite. The taste is somewhat complex, well-balanced, and overall just very well-constructed. This is a good example of Stone's good work.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brewcrew76,4.47,"A - Pours a clear deep golden pale orange with a thin white sticky head. A little too light and pale to stand up to the best IPA's.  S - Faint light aroma of resiny piney hops. Hint of lemon also present. The aroma could be a bit bolder but it does start to build nicely as the beer warms.  T - Piney, resinous, grapefruit with a mild bitterness that grows as you drink.  M- Light to medium and nicely carbonated. Bitter but not too dry of a finish.  D - This beer seemed a little light in the beginning but became a very nice IPA by the finish. It dinks a lot easier than a 6.9% ABV IPA also. This could easily be an everyday drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kendo,4.5,"A: From a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Smith's pint glass, it pours a slightly hazy (chill hazed?) golden coppery orange with a bubbly 1-finger white head. A small amount of bubbles rise to refortify the head and as I drink my way down the glass it leaves clumpy remnants of the head behind.  S: A wonderful aroma -- fruity hops dominate, with grapefruit taking hold of the wheel but ripe peaches in the mix somewhere, and finally -- especially as it warms -- piney hops make an appearance. It smells like a bigger beer.  T: Fruity hops up front, with grapefruit dominant again. But a solid malt backbone is there, holding things up. A little bit of spice at the end with a surprisingly dry finish. That fruity, citrusy hop flavor coats the front of the mouth while the dry tang covers the back, lingering long after each sip. Scratch that -- lingering is the wrong word. It takes control of the mouth and won't let go.  M: Creamy. Medium-bodied. Some bite at the end, but not in a bad way at all. Those hops at times seem to be rotting the enamel right off my teeth.  D: Are you kidding? The sixer of 12 oz bottles was a major mistake. Either I've got to pour myself another or I've got to stick with the bombers. This goes down REAL easy. The only shortcoming is the serious lingering fruity and dry hop aftertaste.That may slow down the non-hopheads and it makes you long for a glass of water.  Notes: I reviewed this from the tap a few months back. Sitting in my kitchen tonight, focused on what I poured myself from the bottle, I like this beer even more now. It's become my wife's favorite, and if only it were a little cheaper, this would be my ""house"" beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zuggy9,4.42,"This is a great all around IPA. IT pours a nice cloudy amber with decent head retention and a bit of lacing. The smell is rich with hops and very piney. A bit of citrus too. That taste is a nice balance of hops and malt, with some sweet caramel notes and profound hoppiness. It has a nice dry finish and pleasant mouthfeel. Very drinkable!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,notoriousdav,3.85,"Pours a nice light amber with two fingers of foam. Retains head very well. Very herbal on the nose. Taste is unmistakeably hoppy, like a pine cone dipped in soap, definitely makes you pucker-up. Anymore hops and this beer would be outta control, but they managed to get it pretty much right for this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jeffjfindley,4.47,"A gem of a session IPA. The color murky orange, the head of the two finger variety, and the lacing sticky. To describe the scent as hop-dominant would be an understatement of cataclysmic proportion. This beer smells pinier than my guest house did yesterday, after I wrestled a very wide Christmas tree out through the very narrow front door.  The taste brings forward a far greater malt presence than does the nose, and you'll find yourself gratified by a sweet flavor of caramel, along with a tart blast of grapefruit. The hop presence is profound throughout the quaff, and reveals itself in the mouthfeel with a bitter, lingering dry finish.  In my spare time, I like to go to my local homebrew supply shop, go to the freezer, and smell the canisters of hop pellets. A twirl of the glass containing this beer elicits a similar aroma, as though the hop oils are activated. This is also present in the taste. As with every Stone product I've tried, and I've tried most of them, they pull this off in enviable fashion resulting in a hell of a treat to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TechMyst,3,"I was expecting so much more. Run of the mill IPA for me. FFF pale ale had more hop character than this...gotta pad this...I didn't think much of arroagant bastard either, I've heard rave after rave for this BC...I must try more or another offering of this same brew, I wouldn't want to tarnish a good reputation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,isaac,4.69,"12 oz. bottle (well, a few) to my beer chalice.  A - A very pretty golden color with a thick, white head. lace is ample at sticks to the glass the whole way down. crystal clear as well.  S - Ahhhh. Hops. Cascade maybe and notes of fruit and alcohol. go stone!  T - Um, more hops? Some malt grains and biscuit-like qualities, but all and all this is a showcase for the very citric, tart, refreshing, quencing, wonderful hop. finish is clean.  M - Smooth, thin to medium body with a sort of drying quality in the finish.  D - 100% drinkable. everytime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,oelergud,4.8,"Beautiful copper semitransparent body with a huge white head rocky and fluffy. Great lace and moderate retention. Delicious hoppy caramel scent topped with flowers and light hay. Mellow mild malt, butter and spice. Up front mild malts quickly followed by a rough hop rush filled with complexity of hay, grass and flowers. Aftertaste is long lived and spiked hoppy malt, very well balanced. Thick, slick and smooth put still prickling the tongue. So very delicious and gone way too fast.  -Oelergud",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,akorsak,3.75,"Served on-tap at the Brewhouse Grille in Camp Hill, PA.  A: The ale is an amber color, almost a pale orange, with a small ring of head (1/2 finger) that does not retain for long.  S: The aroma is a grapefruity hop and grainy malt combination.  T: My initial review of Stone IPA slammed it (relative to Arrogant Bastard and Ruination). In hindsight, it comes across as Stone's easiest beer to drink. The hops are citrusy and strong, but not too strong. They allow the a biscuity malt body to shine through (one of the rare times that I've encountered the malts in a Stone ale).  M: The ale is well-balanced, allowing both the hops and the malts to have their time on the sun.  D: Stone's most drinkable ale, this one does not overwhelm the tastebuds or wear you out with an intense abv.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Finnman,4.22,"This beer has a deep golden hue with an aroma of grapefruit, gumball, and a slight hint of pine. The hops flavor is very pronounced and it balances out in the palate quite nicely. An easy beer to drink, despite the 6.9% ABV. A clear winner from Stone Brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gatch,3.71,"I've always loved IPA's and this probably tops the list and will stay up there. Very refreshing and very smooth. The hops are very prevalent but not overwhelming. It creates a very citrusy and piney taste.  Not really much of a head but the nose is great. It was hard to find at first, but my brother and I figured it was a little bit of citrus, mostly orange and lemon peel, and then of course the floral and other fruity aromas.  Priced very well, so I will probably have this in my fridge most of the time. In a glass, it looks like a Hefe, but drinks a lot better if you like slight bitterness. I cannot say enough about this beer but why should I have to, it's Stone.  Update: June 17, 2020; figured I’d buy a tall can of this because I have probably had this only a few times since this review in 2006. So it definitely didn’t become a regular beer for me and certainly isn’t at the top of my list. It’s actually worse than I remember, which I originally scored a 4.35; now it tastes like a mediocre pale ale with hop concentrate added. Maybe Stone couldn’t scale up? So sad how far they’ve fallen. I like that a small brewery grew into a competitor with the big companies but it’s never a happy ending. Canned 06/04/20 so just about two weeks old which means it’s fresh and still this average. I’ll likely never drink this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BlackAngus,4.29,"A - Light orange/dark yellow, cloudy. No head to speak of.  S - Pine and citrus aromas, also some maltiness.  T - Very hoppy, but not crazy bitter. Maltiness to back up the hops. Citrus and pine flavor.  M - Medium body, smooth and clean, nice carbonation.  D - Highly drinkable, especially for a great price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tjthresh,4.72,"On tap. Pours with hues of golden straw, and firey orange. Topped with a resiny frothy with head. Strong pungent hop aroma. Mostly pine, and then some more pine, and maybe some pine. I think I get some peachy notes too. Very clean bitterness. Crisp. First class all the way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MEANxOLDxTOM,4.3,"From notes. A-Golden bronze color with a very bubbly white head that fills the pint glass....I really enjoy when an IPA is not just a fizzy pale yellow that I get more often than not. S- Big citrus...pretty much all flavors of this type of fruit I could see orange, lemon/lime, and grapefruit....slight spice and sweet malt....crisp and slightly musky. T-Big hops, and again lots of citrus...specifically in the tip and in the finish. Light malts in body provide a nice balance....Considering how big this IPA is it does not have an overwhelming bitterness...very nicely done. M/D- almost high carbonation...refgreshing...excellent representation of the style....its what Stone does best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GregBrewski,4.92,"Served in a wiezen glass, quite a sight...plenty of bubbles rushing to the top, nice clear golden color, with a head that maintains its retention through out its brief life in my glass, nice white, fluffy head, that left layers of lacing from the very top to the bottom of the glass. The aroma changes with temperature of the brew, starts very floral and just hints of spice and citrus, as it warms up and gains more character it looses its floral tones and becomes a complex mixture of citrus, malts, and chocolates or caramels. The taste is tantalizing, I keep searching for more. Its a well balanced mixture of smooth malts in the front to the lovely flavors of the hops in the finish. Perfect in carbonation, a good body, and well concealed alcohol. This is an IPA that defines the style in my view, very well rounded, very hop-y, very tasty! Its not only a great session beer, but a beer that can be enjoyed at any time and moment (at least for us hop heads out there). Now, the challenge lays, were can I find more, good thing they come in bombers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,demcorhip,4.22,"Thanks to raider for sharing this tasty IPA at our TB IPA session.  Appearance A nice golden ale with a decent offwhite head. Low level of finely carbonated bubbles rising to their freedom from this brew. Nicely laced.  Aroma Big hoppy nose of grapefruit and pine overtop of toasty malts with a touch of caramel.  Taste Nice balance and contrast between the malts and hops. Bready malts with a toasty touch and an even lesser touch of caramel. Very nice hops with fruity pear and citrus flavours along with some pine. They do their best to pleasantly linger.  Mouthfeel Nicely balanced bold IPA. Good malt backbone with even better bitter, floral, fruity and resiny hops.  Drinkability Very drinkable, great session fare. May be too bold for the hop novice, but this is a tasty treat i'd love to drink again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,timtheenchanta,4.25,Very clear light orange with a pure white one finger head and thin webby lacing.  Very spicy hop infested nose with grapefruit tingling the nostrils.  Probably the spiciest IPA I've ever had. This is exceptional considering how little it tastes like the pine characteristic from most spicy IPAs. Pretty good example from Stone that's fruity and spicy and a nice one to have on hand.  Thanks Stone!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WeisGuy,4.4,"a - deep golden amber color, hazy, nice one-inch head with retention around the edges, decent lacing  s - floral hops, nice sweet maltiness, nicely balanced, no alcohol in the nose  t - very bitter piney hops up front, sweet caramelly maltiness in the middle, nicely balanced sweet and bitter finish that lasts awhile  m - medium-bodied, ample carbonation, hop oil coats the mouth well  d - very drinkable, I could drink this all night, though the abv might be a tad high to call it a session beer  Finally got around to reviewing this great brew. For me, it definitely lived up to its reputation. I wasn't expecting such a balanced brew. This is definitely not just a hop-bomb a la Ruination. I'll once again appeal to Mr. Koch to start distributing to NC.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RedChrome,4.22,"Slightly murky deep golden colored body. A white inch high, thick foam head took a few minutes to dissapear. Average amount of carbonation bubbling to surface. Thick clumps of lacing.  Increadibly strong aromas. A nice citric hops blend. A very nice lemon aroma gives way to a blend of tangerine and orange rinds. A very fainty earthy pine can be hinted in back of susbequent whiffs.  Very nice flavors hop around the mouth. First sip had an initial light roasted malt aroam before developing into a pine bitter finish. A hops citric aftertaste has a orange rind taste. Strong hops finish in additional mouthfulls.  An above thickness body clung to the sides of the mouth. Carbonation provides a nice tingle on the front of the tongue.  A great beer. This one is going to be one of my standard in fridge favorites. Would be a great beer with any chicken pasta dish. Kudos to the boys and girls at Stone for making yet another wonderful offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rarevos,2.65,"Poured into pint glass.  A: Hazy orange with a finger of fluffy white head that has good longevity.  S: Fruit (citrus: grapefruit, orange zest) and some light caramel malt. I'm getting some woodsy aromas as well. Not quite fully piney (like the Bridgeport IPA) but... herbal?  T/M: Oh, yikes. Way, way, way, way too phenolic. Malt and fruit suggested by the nose get totally overwhelmed by a pronounced flavor of Band-Aids. Extremely unpleasant, and somewhat greasy on the palate. I can tell that there's fruit in here, and I can sense the maltiness, but they both lose to the band-aids.  D: I drank most of the first pint, but poured the rest of my bomber down the drain. Ruination was a great beer, but this one...not so much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tcfishler,4.09,"Clear bright amber, with a small offwhite head that dissipates before long.  Big blast of hop aroma - green herbs with sweet spice. A little fruit is there in the background too.  On the palate, the hops hit right away, with pine, herbs, and grass. Carbonation is a little coarse, but mouthfeel is rich. Malt contributes body but not overt sweetness...I like that quality a lot.  Delivers most of the character of the Ruination IPA for a lower price point. In fact, I prefer the balance of this brew to the Ruination. A must for fans of grassy hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chadspivey,4.13,"A: lighter than I expected for some reason, impressive 1 and 1/2 finger off white head.  S: hard to smell anything but hops , but it still smells like a nicely balanced IPA.  T: hops mostly, but delicous. It's hard to pick out anything else, maybe some citrusy fruits, but very faint.  M: medium-bodied, can feel the bubbles. pretty nice mouthfeel, for an IPA.  D: I want another, I could probably drink three of these bombers, just keeps getting better with every sip.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MVassar,4.3,"Slightly cloudy, with a light honey color. Impressive, dense, off-white head that lasts and lasts. Tiny bubbles with delicate lacing.  Herbal, floral fragrance. A hint of pine and lemon.  Tons of flavor. Loaded with bitter hops, sweet caramel, and a hint of grapefruit peel. Incredibly well-balanced.  Feels perfect going down. Great balance of crisp carbonation and creamy texture.  Dangerously drinkable. Feels full and rich, but not too heavy. An elegant quaff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,vwcraig,4.33,"Hazy, golden-orange color. Big, impressive off-white foamy head.  Smells lemony and like grapefruit/ orange but also some sweet smells. Toasted malt smell, but mainly citrus fruits.  Grapefruit taste up front with a little sweetness switches to a big piney hop taste that lingers for a while. Big bitter bite in back of throat.  Medium bodied, slightly oily nice carbo  Very good all around drinker and IMO a staple in AIPA style. Will add to favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Realale,3.98,"Clear bright gold. Very fine white head settles to an incomplete cap leaving nice lacing.  Nice mix of bready and crackery malts provide a solid base for bright citric hops. Pretty classic AIPA here!  Bright and lively in the mouth. Medium body with excellent balance of malt and hops, both of which are distinctly American in character. Good length, ending with a snappy bitterness.  Carbonation is a little high, which dries the mouth, but that's a niggle really. Very drinkable, and my favorite of the ""standard"" Stone offerings by far.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Rudgers73,4.25,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22 oz bomber.  A- Golden yellow color. Big, rocky, dishwater head. Slow rising micro-carbonation.  S- The hops are very fruity smelling. A slight dry/bitter smell towards the end.  T- Bitter to start with lots of piny taste that blooms into a warming citrus taste for the end. I like when IPA's start bitter and end sweet versus the opposite. This is great.  M- I like the mouthfeel a lot. Lots of taste and complexity but not the lip-puckering resin taste like a lot of medium to strong American IPA's have that I've tried. Easy to drink.  D- A nice treat for a few that enjoy good IPA's. The price controls how much of this slightly stronger beer you enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mmcave,4.42,"Purchased during thanksgiving in Ohio at local wine and beer store. Poured into a pint glass. A nice rich white head developed, with decent retention. The lacing has coated the glass already. The body is a warm rusty, reddish, orange amber. The smell is wonder, vanilla mixed with floral aromatic hops and mild citrus. The taste is great crisp and fresh with a very pleasant mouth feel, but all the magic comes at the finish especially after the swallow the fruit really comes out. This one also makes my burps great.The whole brew emanates a very fresh and inviting presence. Its a really subtle nice IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChainGangGuy,4.22,"Appearance: Pours a light orange body with a medium white head.  Smell: Profusely fruity hop aroma, with brilliant notes of grapefruit and golden raisins.  Taste: Generous amounts of fresh hop flavors, none of which are overpowering. Grapefruit, pine needles, and juicy orange slices progress to a light caramel maltiness. It all leads to a short-lived, subtly bitter dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a fine, resiny texture.  Drinkability: Unsurpassed drinkability! An excellent IPA charged with great hop flavors and enough malt to remain well-balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ypsifly,4.3,"Undated bomber purchased at Merchant's in Dearborn and poured into a tulip.  Clear, light copper with two fingers of white just sits there and provides ringed layers of lace.  The nose is very much west coast citrus hops with just a bit of malty sweetness poking through.  Briefr flash of the malts upfront that is quickly replaced by a juicy hop flavor that is very citric with grapefruit and oranges. This almost tastes like wet hops were used. Very juicy and tasty. Not much for balance, but that is expected given the style and the brewer.  Medium mouth with just the right amount of carbonation and the hop oils do not make me pucker and they wash away clean. Very tasty and equally drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hoggerdog,4.52,"Appearance: Brilliant, light copper color with a two finger head that stays rocky across the top of the surface. Very good head retention that clings to the glass with muscle and lasts for the entire duration.  Smell: Strong and intensely aromatic hop pungency that reminds me of a damp, flowery meadow. Pine and citric hop character is evident after the floral rush. There is also an estery fruitiness that is similar to light fruit kind of like white grape or pear.  Taste: Malty sweetness and esters come through first but are almost completely overridden by the oily hop bitterness that explodes upon the middle of the tongue and lasts long into the finish. Fresh grain and hop linger in the back of the mouth.  Mouthfeel: Slick and oily from all of the hop resin present here. Medium body and a healthy dose of carbonation make this so darn smooth like licking pure malt syrup; which I have done for better or worse.  Drinkability: This is an exceptional IPA that I could have no matter what time of year it is. Despite the excessive hopping rate this brew was in fact quite well balanced. The alcohol of this beer is well disguised but after a few drinks seemed even more than its stated 6.9% as the warmth overtook me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,auntfloyd,4.27,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a Stone IPA specialty glass.  Pours a bright, clear, golden amber, with about two fingers of white head with good retention and a fair amount of lacing. The nose is citrus-y, pine-y hops, fairly spicy, enough to let you know what you're getting in to. The taste is bitter hops, fairly spicy, but not overwhelmingly so, with a smooth aftertaste -- pretty much the dead-on essence of an IPA. The mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is high, especially for a Stone brew and an IPA.  All in all, this is probably the best IPA out there. It should surprise no one that Stone does an excellent IPA, and it's no coincidence that this is one of their flagship ales, not to mention a personal favorite of mine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,msubulldog25,4.54,"It had been a while (over a year) since my last Stone IPA. I remember liking it alot. A refresher was needed. Bought a 12 oz. single at Beaumont Market and poured to a pint glass. Always love reading the back of the silk-screened bottles - this one in particular tells about the gargoyle on their logo and about their IPA. An essay-length report on both...  A: Surprisingly light gold color and clear. Frothy 1-finger off-white head dies down to a 1/4"" creamy cap. Lots of tiny streams of carbonation.  S: Oh my...that's so fine-smelling. Huge sugary sweetness meld with floral, grassy and citrus hops. Perhaps the sweetest, most fragrant and salivation-worthy IPA's...my Pavlovian response is to drool. Alot.  T: Lots of malty caramel sweetness mashed with juicy citrus hops. Goes from fruity to bitter in a sneaky way. I like the fact that this beer has hops but doesn't pummel the tastebuds into oblivion; having a malt balance is really nice.  M: I love the full flavor and rich mouthfeel, but could do with out the slightly syrupy/gummy residue it leaves on my lips.  D: Overall, an excellent IPA. Cherish this beer if you can get it. If not, find a way to get some. Among my favorites of all styles, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mattf311,4.47,"A great IPA! Pours golden / light amber. Smells of hops and citrus. The hops are balanced well with citrus flavor. Very hoppy but not out of control at all. Nicely carbonated and smooth mouthfeel. It is also very drinkable for an american IPA. A fantastic beer for a hops fix. If I have any suggestion, it would be that a bit more intensity in the hops. Don't get me wrong though, this is one of my favorite IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,number1bum,4.53,"Wow, this may be the holy grail of West Coast IPAs. Pours a golden color and is surprisingly opaque for a beer of such color, with a big frothy head that diminishes slowly and retains a nice lace throughout. Smell is primarily hops and it's oh so nice. Big hoppy taste up front that's beautifully balanced with malt. Very smooth and well-balanced, in fact. Hoppy, bitter finish that lasts long on the palate. Mouthfeel is fantastic; a bit thick and very creamy. I could drink this all night (or until I succumbed to the abv).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dherling,4.39,"Poured out amber, copper color. Small head, but good lacing. The nose is all about big grapefruit hops, citrus, sour, bitter, sweet on the end. Smells great.The taste is again all about hops, it definitely smacks you, followed by a little sweetness from the malt. Extremely hoppy, yet balanced. Mouthfeel is very good, and this is fairly drinkable, but a bit much for an all night buddy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,walleye,3.88,"got this bad boy from Ross. poured a nice amber with a off white head that left some good lacing. aroma big hops, orange and lemon, grassy, a sweetness that I cannot tell if it is honey or brown sugar maybe it is both. flavor dry hops, grapefruit with no sugar on it, pine, perfume and a slight ash tray taste but not in a bad way as it warms do get some sweetness. this is a good IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CharlieMopps,4.62,"A: Pours a nice deep gold, generous thick head with excellent retention and lacing down the side of the glass.  S: Inviting citrusy hop aromas, with an spicy side present that makes for an extremely appealing whiff.  T: Heavy handed with the hops, but produces a surprisingly relaxed aftertaste. Bit of spice directly up front, with not too much bite. An amazing balance is achieved for a beer that is presupposed to one side.  M: Creamy body with oily hop feel on the palate. Not a lengthy aftertaste, but refreshing and crisp to say the least.  D: Very nice-bodied IPA, so smooth it can be enjoyed one after another, just be mindful of the abv. Other than that, an absolutely amazing IPA, one that I think for its all-around great qualities puts it head and shoulders above many others.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jp32,4.31,"A highly unique india pale ale here. The appearance is probably the only thing close to average about this one. Copper tones with a good head. The nose is terrific! Pungent floral and citrus hops explode out of the pint glass. The taste is pure hops as well. It seems almost misleadingly subtle at first sip, until I swallow the large gulp and find a ferocious blast of hops! Not sure I've had a more powerful hoppy beer ever. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, but the thickness creates an almost slimey effect, not a bad thing, just unique. Drinkability is great for one or two, but the tremendous flavor of this one would catch up to me in a hurry.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,stouty1,3.18,"A: Poured into my nonic tumbler with minimal head and no lacing. Retained a small fringe around the rim. S: Flowery aromas gush at you immediately and then fade away to a hoppy smell.  T: Bland with a small hint of hops late in the drink. Not too much taste, probably due to the high carbonation washing away any flavor.  M: Fizzy with a left over dryness at the back of your mouth. Hard to swallow right away, this one needs to be dealt with by your taste buds first. Then the carbonation washes away everything.  D: Easy to drink if you can get past the carbonation. Did I say carbonation? My tongue feels numb and smooth. Not much warming from alcohol as one would expect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,treedoctor5002,4.25,"I've been dying to try some Stone because of the rave reviews so here we go... Pours a pale amber color with a very nice head that really lasts. The smell is a very nice floral/hoppy smell but it isn't overwelming. The taste is good with that typical herbal, bitter hop flavor. I would say it is above average but not out of this world. It is very smooth and creamy for an IPA. I could definitely drink a few of these. The alcohol is very understated. It has a good mix of sweet fruit flavors with the hops kicking in to warm things up. A good example of American IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Manosbeeroffate,4.8,"From a great trade with IntriqKen, thanks!! Pours a deep amber reddish color with a small head. Smells hoppy and sweet, nice combo.

147,88,grego,4.35,"I poured this from a 12oz bottle. The color is sort of a straw color with very little red. One finger of head lasted quite some time with nice lacing throughout. The smell is fantastic, hops and more hops. Very citrusy with some pine but not overwhelming. The taste follows the smell very well. Beautiful hops flavor, and again not too piney. Not sweet at all but has a nice balance. The mouthfeel is great, smooth to start and dry at the end. I could drink this beer all day and/or night. This to me is the best (so far) AIPA I have ever had. Gotta hand it to Stone once again for a great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wanker,3.5,"This beer is definitely for hop heads.It is a complex beer, with citrus and stone fruit flavors (peach and tangerine?) underneath a serious hop zing.  To tell you the truth, the hop flavor was so strong that it was difficult for me to finish my half of the bomber I shared with my wife. I liked the fruity undertones, but the intensity of the piney hop tastes killed the drinkability for me.  That said, I'm really a stout and porter guy, so ignore this review if your tastes don't run in the stout/porter direction.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Alkey,4.44,Poured from a 12 oz. bottle I am now ready to enjoy my first Stone IPA and write my first beer review.  I see a dark golden brew with lots of bubbles and spongy white head.  A really great scent almost a perfume of citrus and a lite floral aroma.  Strong tastes of sour fruit like grapefruit that mellows as my taste buds readjust to the initial shock with a sweet finish of orange and tangerine.  This is an IPA with lots of character and one that I'll be looking forward to exploring further.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,adammills,4.25,"This is one hell of a hop brew! A bit grassy, a ton of hops, yet it is not over the top for me, and I am more of a malty fella.

Very drinkable, awesome.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scruffwhor,4.43,"Thanks once again Kahn's of Indianapolis.  Appearance- Great, thick eggshell colored head. Concrete like retention and great foamy film. Sluggish bubbles slowed down by the resiny hops I bet. Great mild amber that for some reason makes me think of spring time.  Aroma- Great notes some slight citrus in the hop, but more earthy aromas and a medium scent of pine. Not overpowering in hops. I like the subdued nature of this aroma. Some mild malts balance out the aroma very well.  Taste- Starts with some pine needles and hop floweration in the front. The middle lets the malt give a hint of caramel to the earthy textures of the bitterness. A little resiny and sweet. Almost like tasting a mix of cascade hops in a light corn syrup.  Mouthfeel- A little resiny, but not boggy like some IPAs. This beer is pretty easy to drink on taste and palate. The alcohol limits it's sessionability.  Great beer. Can easily see why Stone is touted for their IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Sixpack595,4.07,"Pale copper colored body with slightly off white head. Moderately low cap of foam leaves quite a bit of heavy lacing. Strong citrus hop aroma overpowers everything with grapefruit and a hint of grassiness. Flavor is equally powerfull with a full hop bitterness, dry and fresh. Malt flavor is nearly totally overpowered, leaving only the slightest hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, almost oily and slick. Carbonation is a bit lacking, but not a deal breaker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,xav33,3.96,"Stone India Pale Ale 22 oz bomber Recent brewing, chiseled into 10/06 Medium pour in a tulip glass.   Poured clear amber with a huge frothy white mostly lasting head with excellent lacing.  Smelt of moderate bready cereal malt, grassiness, lemon rinds and grapefruit. Overall soft and inviting.  Flavor was upfront moderate to heavy grapefruit bitterness with light lemony sweetness followed by a slightly harsh pine bitterness and soft clean earthy feel on a long lingering grapefruit finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium, creamy, softly carbonated, with some moderate astringency and slight alcoholic warmth.  Overall, this is an excellent IPA with envigorating hops taste, but it feels like it could have delivered just a bit more on the malt sweetness on the finish to balance out the equation towards perfection.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beakerboy,4.43,"Part of Liquor Barn's ultimate Brew Crew Oct-'06- Pale Ales  Pours a slightly hazy orange with one finger of thick creamy head. There was a thin crown of foam throughout the entire drink with plenty of lace. The aroma is very complex, but primarily pine, citrus. The taste is great! when he beer fist passes over the tongue you taste the heavy malt flavors and the aromatic hops. The bitterness after taste is quite strong. It's great for someone like me with the worst taste buds in the world. It's a fairly heavy beer, lots of body. This is the second time I've has this particular brew, and the first I've drunk while dissecting it for beeradvocate. Lets hope the rest of this months selections are as good overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Cadyfatcat,3.33,"Cloudy straw colour with a nice bubbly and lacey head.  Smells slightly of honey with candy sweet floral hops.  Floral hop flavors dominate the entire experience. Hops are one-dimensional as well. Beer has some soapy flavors going on.  I know I am going against the masses on this one, but I am really not that impressed. I like a more dynamic hop character in an IPA, I found this one rather powerful, yet lacking in complexities. A good beer, but I have had far superior IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Frozensoul327,3.95,"A: Mighty golden color with a amber orange hue. Dense foamy head. Lots of lace.  S: Hops. Lots of 'em. Pine. Light citrus. Nice. Very fresh and inviting.  T: Lots of dry hops, mild and smooth malts, with sappy pine notes. Hits of grains and earthy vegetables.  M: Lighter than many. Goes down very easy. Smooth and silky, no dense syrupy feeling.  D: Good. A solid IPA. A real winner. Could easily be sessioned.  Notes: A fine IPA. Doesn't beat Two-Hearted Ale, but gives it a run for it's money.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,joe1510,4.35,"22oz. Bomber  I cracked open the bottle and immediately got hit with a whiff of hops. I have a feeling I'll like this one.  Stone's IPA poured a chill hazed tarnished golden with very lively carbonation rising from all over the bottom of my pint glass. Sitting up top is a nice 1+ finger creamy white eggshell head.  Smell is of hops. All hops. Big piney, oily hops. There is a citrus freshness that pokes its head out in the middle. There is a little earthiness at the end. As this beer warms, the malt that holds it all together comes through as a nice backbone aroma.  Taste is what I think an IPA should taste like. The malt in the smell is a nice sturdy backbone. The hops take center stage though. Hop oils abound followed by pine needles. There is that citrus again on the middle of my tongue. This all leads into a moderate bitterness that leaves me wanting more.  Mouthfeel is close to perfect. Medium bodied. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Goes down awfully smooth.  It would be very easy to drink these all night long. The bitterness leaves you wanting another drink right after the last. The abv is hidden very well. Dangerously drinkable.  This is what I think an IPA should be. Big on hops with a decent abv. This is in my top 3 favorite IPAs. Very good representation of the style. A must try.  Slainte!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,elricorico,4.12,"This review is from notes written when orrshow shared his bomber with me. Thanks again Mike.  In the glass this beer is clear orange, reminding me of the colour that orange kool-aid had when I was a kid. The head is off white and rocky, and leaves plenty of lacing all over the glass.  Bitter, hoppy, citrus, aromatic. Take any adjective used to describe hop aromas and insert here, you should be able to make it fit with this beer. Great smell for an IPA.  The first taste is not as bitter as expected, especially considering the smell. This changes the deeper you get in. Malt is very much overpowered by the hops. Floral and citrus, and a bit grainy.  The beer feels slightly oily on the tongue, and has a fair amount of carbonation. Good effect for the style.  This one is for the hopheads, not surprising considering the style and the brewery. Glad to have tried it, and would probably pick it up from time to time were it available to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dogfooddog,3.8,"From a 22oz bottle from BevMo in La Jolla...pours nicely with small white head. Nose is very hoppy, citrus and a bit bitter. After what I suspect was a light-struck bottle from another source, curious to try the IPA from this much-touted brewery.  Bitter hoppy taste, it varies some from citrusy and almost lemon-like to down-and-out bitter as my palate adjusts. There is just a hint of skunkiness as well, though given the location and lighting where I bought it I am not sure this beer has ever been light-exposed. While a pleasant example of an IPA, I think there are more interesting things out there, and will try some more things from this brewery before passing judgement.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

My mom picked up a sixer of these beauties and after they each tried it and hated it, I was bequeathed a fourpack. Score!  Pours translucent and well topped with snow whhite head on a medium rust color and oodles of sticky lacing. Nose is fresh citrus and pineey hops. Powerful but not overpowering.  Nice mellow bitterness that increases in sharpness as the taste fades. Dry and finishes well. Mouthfeel is smooth but almost pulpy in thickness. Highly drinkable althugh the abv will get you if you're not careful. Not for rookies, buut definitely another quality pproducct from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sleazo,4.59,"A-Pours amber/copper with minimal head, the lack of head prevents this from getting more than a four.  S-Hops, hops, hops. this is how a beer should smell, sticky piney grapfruit hops.  T-The hops definitely hits you first, followed by some sweetness from the malt. Very hoppy yet balanced.  M-Very good here too, it is the perfect consistency with good carbonation.  D-I could drink these all night. Enough for mee to get into some serious trouble.     This is my go to beer living in San Diego. It is a really well balanced beer despite the xtreme hoppiness. I will miss having this cost $7 a sixer when i move back to NYC. This is perhaps the best example of a West Coast IPA. I would love to distribute this in Europe and see how they woudl deal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,plaid75,4.47,Poured a murky medium copper hue with a one finger pillowy white head. There was decent retention and very good lacing.  The smell was 100% resiny hop. A strong citrus and peppery aroma. There was a nice soft grain aroma as well.  The taste was a spicy peppery upfront hop bitternes. Hints of grapefruit and orange sweetness as well. A good biscuity grain bill as well. Mild alcohol burn detected.  The mouthfeel was full and spicy.  Overall a superior IPA. This beer is the standard for AIPAs. I am glad I finally tried it.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,objectivemonkey,4.3,"Into a pint glass, pours a deep golden color with a decent beginning head, leaves a film and nice stringy lacing. Aroma seems a little one dimensional, not really a surprise, just wish there was more malt backing. Heavy on floral hops, a littel oily, grapefruit, like it. Taste is... well, quite tasty. Floral, bitter, aggressive, and slick, this is and IPA for IPAs, The key is, it isn't overwhelming, to the point of being offensive, but just on the verge that makes it great. Mouth is smooth, slick, full, warm but not apparently alcoholic. In sum, I still want Stone distributed here. Damnit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jasonjlewis,4.26,"App: great head and retention  Smel: Nice, pungent, citrusy, spicy smell. I anticipate a beer with balls.  Taste: not as hoppy as I expected. I thought this beer would be a lot hoppier and in my face. It's still nice and balanced. I guess I need to try Ruination. This isn't enough of a hop fix for me. This beer is very balanced. Almost too balanced. I expected a lot from stone. I think that's the reason why I expected more hoppiness. Flavor is piney and comes out more as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Clings to the mouth well, somewhat crisp.  Drinkability: An easy to drink, very sessionable IPA. Could down this all night.  I don't notice the abv of 6.9% at all I would have guess 5.5%",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,uberabr,4.19,"Pours a pretty light amber/gold with hints of red. Fluffy white head and gorgeous lace. The aroma really smacks you in the face. Simple but charming. A bold, grassy citrus. Tons of grapefruit. A definite hopp character.  Tastes great. Fruity with a good balance between hopp and malt. Might be a little too bitter for some, but I like it. Can't really taste the alcohol at all, I would have guessed it to be around 4 or 5 AbV. Fully body and goes down easy. Couldn't ask for much more from an IPA in terms of appearance, drinkability, and taste. The unique aroma bumps this one from good to great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bugsey,4,"Appearance is beautiful. Golden, bubbles, foam.  Smell is enticing. Bread, citrus, creamy malt.  Taste and mouth were outstanding. There is plenty to excite the tounge. Creamy malt and citrus bitterness. Just the right amount of carbonization to keep it lively without a sting. The aftertaste lingered in my mouth and mind. Give me more.  Drinkability was superior. I'm glad I bought six. Because I had a strong hankering for another each and every day. Very memorable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It's pretty damn good but it's a bit of a kick to the nuts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,czechsaaz,4.42,"Big nose of citrus hops, grapefruit and lemon peel. Not much other aroma characteristics can fight through it. After a few sips I do get a little bit of base malt.  Gold, pretty cloudy with a great pillowy lasting head.  Tip of the toungue, some sweet malty flavor. Then the hops kick in. Very fresh hop tasting with more of the citrus-type hop flavor. Higly bitter but not overwhelming. On the back end there's a really nice malt profile that tastes a little like bran flakes. Theres also a nice fruity yeast flavor mixed in. Overall a nice flavor profile between malt and hops.  Medium-full bodied. Very nice carbonation level that is lively in your moth without adding more bitterness effect.  Overall, one of my favorite IPAs. It's not insanely hoppy so it keeps me interested with the other flavors. Goes down pretty easy and pairs really will with spicy food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mattgert,4.85,"Excellent IPA. Nice citrus/hop smell, pours amber/gold with nice head and lacing to the end. Has a great bitter hop smack with refreshing citrus notes followed by a malt backbone to balance things out. For an IPA I think this is a little on the mild side for hop bitterness. Very well balanced and exceptional in every aspect. So glad to have found this one!... especially since Three Floyds is on standby in Cincy...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BassAssassin,4.72,"A: Hazy in appearance, and golden in color. Head starts thick and rocky, but slowly settles into a nice, thin lace.  S: Big grapefruit aroma. Hops are abundant, and smell spicy and citrusy. Slight smell of sweet malt.  T: Much like the smell, the first taste is grapefruit and citrus. This beer has serious hops. The intense bitterness is balanced by an underlying malt backbone.  D: Medium bodied with perfect level of carbonation. Crisp with a warming alcohol finish.  D: Very drinkable despite the relatively high ABV. An excellent IPA. It's the benchmark for the style in my opinion. One of my all time favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,eballard,3.3,This beer pours a golden amber color with a light foamy head that settled into a light lace. It has a sweet smell that tickles the nose with a spicy hops IPA tingle. This beer has a stronger bite then the Ruination IPA that Stone brews. It has a nice hops spice and a good blend of flavors but it doesnt have the same IPA qualities as its sister beer. Where that beer seemed strong and sweet this one is more crisp and biting. It is less forgiving to someone that doesnt know the power of an IPA. Its feel is hard and sharp. It cuts through your mouth with flavor and hits you with the IPA tingle. It finishes crisp and refreshing. In all this is a high quality IPA. It is not a masterpiece but well worth drinking if you like hops.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jhollick,4.38,"This poured a hazy light orange with a gloriously thick and clingy white head. Smell is pine, citrus, butter, grass, and a hint of chocolate. This is a thick IPA. It weighs heavily on the tongue and is very smooth in the mouth.  The appearance, smell, and feel do not disappoint, and neither does the taste. The taste has something for anyone...hop punch, sweetness, strong malt presence, wetnesss and dryness; its all there. The flavors are all big, but they're all working together rather than against each other. The malts offset the initial puckering from the hops, and then the dryish finish balances out the sweeter citrus, esters, melon, and chocolate type flavors. I typically find Stone's ""we're too tuff for you"" slogans a bit tacky, but in this beer's case, it may be warranted. This IPA is bursting at the seams, but in a good way. It is an explosion of flavor, but not so over the top that it can't be paired with foods. It would hold up pretty well to and compliment almost any meat dish.  This monster remarkably drinkable, especially given its heft, though it shouldn't really take too many to get you happy at ~7%. I had the DFH 60 Minute before this and crowned it the IPA by which all others are to be measured, but now I am not so sure. This is a stellar and unique take on the style. Bold, but not bold for the sake of shock value. Cheers to everyone on the West Coast who can get this without high effort and costs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bkett01,4.67,"Poured fresh from the kegerator in my living room with a big fluffy white head which died away within the first couple of minutes leaving a heavy lacing on my Stone Ruination pint glass. Appears a transparent light amber, no cloudiness at all. Smells of floral hops with a sweet hint of malt. Taste is a great balance between the two even with a strong hop character. Grapefuit hop flavor dominates over hints of orange rind and light toasted malt. This is far and away my favorite American IPA out there, just finally getting around to reviewing it. It does a great job of satisfying my craving for hops while being incredibly drinkable. At 6.9% it can catch up with you after a bit, but overall this is an amazing beer, and the IPA that I compare all others to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ruinationation,4.5,"This beer pours a light orange haze with a slight copper hue depending on the lighting. Two finger head thats fairly thick, especially for an IPA, that clings to the glass till the end.  Smells of strong hops and a grassy, piney, and skunky undertone. With a hint of what I can only think of is some type of melon with a little citrus. Mouth watering because I know whats in store.  Initial taste is a very hoppy one with a good malty following that carries a citrus mix the whole way though. Bitter bite lingers to remind you this is a stone brew. Good consistency, you know you've had some good beer minutes later. Hop bitterness lingers.  Drinkability depends. Six pack can easily be drank by one throughout a session, but it's nice to follow up a few of these with Stones Ruination IPA a true liquid poem.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JohnnyM2002,4.52,"A - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass at 45 degrees; a cloudy golden color with a thin 1 inch head.  S - Hops punch you in the nose, but the smell is very well-rounded with a grassy/piney background.  T - Starts with a dry, piney feel, but quickly gives way to a grapefruity-hoppy body. Finishes with a wonderful balance of hoppy-bitterness and, again, grapefruits.  M - Medium-feel with a good amount of carbonation.  D - Top-shelf IPA thanks to the classic Stone bitterness. This was my first Stone experience, and I enjoyed it before I knew how big the beer world really was. A very good introduction to the Stone taste and a wonderful IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,williamherbert,3.97,"A clear, yellow-amber color. Appears light-bodied and thin.  Has a very mild aroma. A slight hop aroma, but malts also coming through. Balanced scent, nothing overpowering. Has an underlying fruit scent; maybe apricot? Pleasant, but doesn't make me salivate for it.  Strong hoppy flavor. Malts are present, but overwhelmed by the hops for sure. Nicely balanced; hops are not as overwhelming as I expected. Malt is a nice, smooth counterpoint. Has a slight fruit flavor which I can't quite identify, but it works.  Thick and heavily hopped. Has a fizzy consistency that bounces off the tongue. Not a light beer, by any stretch. But highly drinkable. Has a very hoppy aftertaste, which means I probably couldn't drink two consecutively, but I could drink several in a night. Good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GimpyCane,4.46,"This is one of my favorite brews that I keep in the cooler all the time. Pours a light to medium body that had wonderful hazy golden yellow hue w/ a frothy 1 inch head that does not let down. What attracts me to this IPA is the intense hop and malt flavor. Starts off watery and bittersweet and ends w/ a long lasting dry bitter taste. Love the tartness it leave on my lips. The aroma is also great. A great blast of citrus grapefruit, malt and a slight hint of alcohol. Well- balance brew and goes great with a new york strip or prime rib entree, bbq or by itself. Enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Orrshow,4.22,Appearance  This beer pours a nice deep golden color complimented by a good amount of frothy off white head. The head has some staying power and leaves lacing all the way down.  Smell  First off I get some bread malt with tons of floral hop. Other fruity aromas arise with some malty sweetness and a touch of citrus hop. Very nice.  Taste  Little less bitter than I expected to start but as it warms the bitterness becomes more noticeable. There is a nice amount of grainy biscuit flavor to this beer as well. Citrus and floral hops flavors are there with some bread malt to add. The aftertaste from this one is mostly straight dry bitterness.  Mouthfeel  Good body to it with a nice toned carbonation. My mouth is a touch dry and sticky afterwards though.  Drinkability  Excellent. I had not problems here and it tasted great.  I really like this beer. Very glad to have it brought to me from the U.S. by my father. This just made me fonder of India Pale Ales.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,crwills,3.75,"Poured a mostly clear, deep gold into a pint glass. Small head, but good lacing that sticks around.  Complex aroma -- soapy citrus, pine, some definite watermelon (!) in there, and good spicy hops.  Taste is surprisingly muted. Big malty backbone with some unexpected sweetness. Some aggressive lemon hops up front, but they don't make a lasting impact. Well-balanced, I guess, but I was expecting more hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is OK. Aftertaste is a muted dull bitterness, and a little bit yeasty.  Moderately disappointed with this one, considering its reputation. Bought a six pack, and this was my first, so I may re-review later on.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dizzy,4.32,"Pours a hazy orange with sticky off white head, leaving some lace on the glass as it recedes. Citrusy hops in the aroma with some sweetness, it almost smells like an orange. Lots of citrusy hop flavor, malty sweetness and bitterness (especially in the finish). Medium bodied, but it does seem lighter bodied than I would expect. I like this, unlike some other stone beers, the bitterness seems balanced well with the flavors. I wouldn't want more than one of these, but this is a very enjoyable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,EPICAC,4.15,"I purchased this tonight at Downtown Wine & Spirits. I chilled it to around 45º F and served it in my NERAX pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a clear copper, with a thick, fluffy, off-white head that thins to a persistent film leaving patchy lace on the inside of the glass.  Smell: The aroma is predominantly hoppy, mostly piney and resiny. There are also hints of a malty sweetness, but this is subtle.  Taste: Nice and hoppy. There's a light balancing toasty and sugary sweetness, but this stands no chance against the hops. The hop character becomes dominant in the center and lingers through to the finish. The hops are predominantly citrusy and resiny.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation and oily.  Drinkability: Tasty and quite drinkable for such a hoppy beer.  Overall: A very nice IPA with lots of hop flavors and aromas that aren't overpowered by sweet maltiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bort11,4.63,"This is my very first Stone beer. Thanks to SkinnyElvis for this one.  Very cool silkscreened 12 oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Wow! This is a beautiful beer. The color is a warm hazy golden honey yellow. Active carbonation streamers dancing in the center. The head starts off as a bright white inch and a half cap and never recedes to less than a 1/4 inch. The lacing is a joy to watch. In fact, I think this is one of the most perfect examples of lacing I've seen. Each sip leaves a spider web on the glass. Small chunks of foam cling to the glass and slowly drifts itself back down to the beer, glittering in carbonation the entire time. Absolutely beautiful.  Smell is very grassy/piney bitter from the hops. Quite aromatic, I can smell it from a half arms length. Taste follows smell and then some. The bitterness is floral and citrus combined. Tiniest of malt sweetness lingers in the background. Added bit of spice for kick. It is very full and works itself from front to back of the mouth, leaving a crisp pucker.  I am left feeling bitter that Stone beers are still not available in Missouri",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dblinkhorn,4.35,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into my newly ordered Stone IPA specialty glass, and man does it look great in this glass.  Appearance - This beer pours a rich orange/honey color that is slightly hazy. The beer has many gently (not fast) rising columns of carbonation bubbles. The head is about two fingers thick and creamy in color and texture. It remains at about a finger thick cap of silky head floating on top of the brew. It leaves good lacing through the entire drink. Little alcohol burn on the nose.  Smell - Sweetness as well as a profound bitterness from the very high amount of hops in this brew. There are also some herbal and floral notes to the hops. There are obviously a wide array of hops types that have been added to this IPA. A sweet bready malt character can be smelled way in the background of the amazing boquet of aromas eminating from this glass.  Taste - Wow! Your tongue is barraged immediately with all kinds of hop flavors. The main mixture seems to be some mainly herbal hops paired with a dry- and bitter-charactered hops selection. Also mixed in, but of less intensity, is a mixture of some floral hops notes and a very slight bit of fruitiness (some peach definitely toward the finish, or especially if you quaff it.). There is a large overall citrusy character to the beer that pairs well with the dryness of some of the hops flavor. Again in the background is a sweet bready malt character that helps to balance (if only a little) the insane hoppiness of this fine beer. The aftertaste has some earthiness and an oily bitter hoppiness to it. There is little alcohol throughout the taste.  Mouthfeel - With a medium body, clean character, and a good smoothness, this stuff is a pleasure to drink. The carbonation contains and initial burst of bite to your tongue, but this quickly dies down to a perfect and complimenting level of carbonation for the rest of the taste.  Drinkability - The only thing that takes any merit away from this drinkability on this one is the very intense level of hop flavor and bitterness. While I personally take a liking to this flavor, I imagine the average beer drinker probably would only be able to drink one or two (at the most) of these babies.  Overall, probably the best American IPA I've ever had. A very unique brew among its rivals and it has a superb mixture of different hop types. A must have for IPA or hops lovers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Daehpoh,4.54,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass  A - Golden with a slight amber hue  S - A mouthwatering blend of grass, pine, orange and lemon aromas. This beer has perhaps the best aroma of any IPA I've sampled.  T - Crisp hop flavors jump out, followed by slight malty sweetness. The taste is somewhat tart with lingering hop bitterness. The malt is just too slight for a perfect balance, but it is close.  M - Medium to light. Carbonation throughout lends a lightness to this typically medium-heavy style.  D - Drinkability is very good. This is a relatively bold and flavorful beer, typical Stone, but still very refreshing. The 6.9% abv is hardly evident during consumption.  Overall, this is an excellent IPA and would certainly satisfy any hop-lover not looking for a roundhouse to the tastebuds from overpowering hop deliciousness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Generik420,4.32,"Have to thank Sidd for sending me a sixer of this. Poured into a traditional pint glass and first thing I noticed is the great orange hue and nice white head. Reasonable lacing left on the glass. The smell is very citrusy and floral hop aromas. One of the best smelling IPAs I have had to be honest, as the hop aroma was very evident, but not in the burn your nose hair kind of way. I found the beer to be very malty, semi-sweet, and with a solid hoppy punch on the back end. I though the hop profile was pretty much perfect as it had a great deal of flavor, but wasn't so bitter you were puckering up as you drank it. Has a very velvety smooth mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable beer, and one I just found is available neer me. Unfortunately with a $10.50/six pack price tag, it will be a rare treat.

147,88,cafemondegar,4.44,"As you pour it, the hoppy aroma is what strikes you about this beer. Did not pour with a big head - about thre-fourths of an inch. Excellent taste and mouthfeel - lives upto its promise of being deliciously hoppy. Drinkability is high - perhaps the best among all of Stone's beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Toddv29424,4.42,"Really a tremendous beer. At first it almost seems a little light, but as your mouth becomes acclimated to it you start to notice the subtle nuances. The smell is very floral and a bit sweet. The taste is a tad bitter, but for the most part the floral taste takes center stage. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both through the roof, especially after the first few sips. A definite must try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,henrysunset,4.7,"clean yellowish pour, lots of head of medium bubbles, scent is strong and floral, citrusy like canned grapefruit juice, smells sweet.  incredibly balanced flavour. not as sweet as the nose suggested, a little bit tart after you take a sip and wait. Amazing that it doesn't need some food to tame it. just a exceptionally drinkable, clean beer. Reminds me of the ""whoop pass ipa"" but toned down with less alcohol and strong flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jsbrendle,4.22,"This beer pours with a nice fine-bubbled white head over a good coppery colored liquid, very inviting. The aroma is full of hops (floral or grapefruity). The initial taste is also of aggressive hops (in that ""west coast"" sort of style). The hops are balanced with a good amount of sweet malt character. Very nicely done, big & bold but smooth. The beer suffers a little on drinkability because it seems to be too much (too hoppy, too malty) & too strong (perhaps a % pt. too high) to make a good session beer if that's what you're looking for. Still, a very enjoyable pint (or two, they're small) to have during an evening out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MDekker,4.53,"Glad to finally try this celebrated beer. It pours out a hazy orangish-brown, without much head. I tend to pour soft, though. A bonus for nice lacing as I consumed it.  The aroma is nice - not strong, but only with subtle floral and citrus hints, and a faint sweetness. It tastes goood. A delicious, subtly fruity flavor, with an underlying sweet note that balances the hoppy finish. And in the mouth, it is lusciously smooth and feels thick for an IPA, almost a little creamy. Just great. I could drink up more of this for sure. It ranks right up there with Bell's Two-Hearted as one of the best IPAs I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kkipple,4.12,"Picked this up in PA recently, brought a 6 pack down to share with friends. Ive heard a lot about this one, glad to finally get my mitts on it  First off, great bottle. Love the gargoyle motif Stone has going on. You can tell they really are in love with their own beer, given the lengthy self-marketing fluff on the back.  Pours a very rich gold-orange with 2 inch head. Zesty carbonation and a lingering, frothy retention on the foam. Nice.  Smell is sweet peaches, honey, and resiny hops. I get strong medicinal notes but its overshadowed by a strong piney hop smell.  Tastes great. Honey sweet malts, a fine leafy, citrus hoppy flavor, and a fruity characteristic dominate this beer. Great balance of bitter hops and sweet malts, like any good IPA. Can easily taste alcohol in this one. Finishes with a lingering, hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy and quite smooth.  This is smooth, well balanced IPA. I enjoyed the subtle peach and fruit notes that set this apart from most basic IPAs. If you like resiny, piney hops in your IPA this is one for you. It breaks my heart that you cant buy Stone beer in my home state of SC.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,peabody,3.65,"Pours out light amber like weak Ice Tea. Good head with nice lacing. Smell of orange and hop. No alcohol present but you know it's there. Caramel and hops. As it warms it gets really great tasting. When it is cold, it is very bitter. Grapefruit and a sweet dark flavor in the back. Leaves a film in the mouth but it is a nice mixture of hops and alcohol. Let this beer warm. I could have a few at a time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bouncingsoul1682,4.22,Very fruity smell...a lot like honey...very crisp and hoppy as well...I don't usually drink IPA's and prefer much darker styles but have heard great things about the Stone brewery and was not let down by this tasting. A must trust try for all those who enjoy a good IPA,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,vanrassel,4.5,"Will I ever drink the perfect IPA? Time will tell, but this is the closest I've come.  Every aspect of this beer was close to flawless, starting with its inviting copper colour and resilient, bubbly head. The aroma was definitely hoppy, but mixed between floral and pine scents  nothing too harsh on the nose. Slight evidence of caramel malt, but just enough that you know it's there.  The taste is predominantly hoppy, but this isn't a one-dimensional hop bomb. Yes, it's bitter, but the hop taste has a delicate complexity about it. It started citrusy and gave way to the pine notes before ending in an unbelievably crisp, clean finish  not the dry pucker overwhelming bitterness can produce. The carbonation is apparent, but not so much so that it takes away from a smooth, easy-drinking mouthfeel.  It's a great thing when a beer of any style can bring together all its elements so harmoniously, and Stone has done it here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ColoradoBobs,3.93,"Slightly cloudy light orange-amber body under an ample thick head that leaves decent lacing.  Smell is hoppy floral, malty and citrusy all at once. Nice aroma.  Taste is surprisingly citrusy. The hops bitterness is there, but it's somewhat more restrained than I had been led to believe it might be. Still, for me, it's a bit one-dimensional: just not enough malt backbone to balance the hop bitterness. True to style, I suppose, but just not my favorite style.  Mouthfeel is nice and round. Evident carbonation.  Easy enough to drink one, but there's a bit too much carbonation and long-lasting bitterness to drink very many.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goochpunch,4.5,"Pours a peach-orange-nectarine with a kind of thin white and frothy head that leaves patchy ""lace"" spots on the glass. I don't get a lot of malty aromas in this, but that's ok. The hops are good enough for me. Big citrus notes with some grass and a little aspirin. Alcohol is apparent, but doesn't beat you over the head. Taste is of slightly toasty malt with gummi worms and fruit loops from the citric hops. The only way I can describe it. Hops bitterness lays way on the back of the tongue like you swallowed a crushed up pill. That last aspirin bit makes me knock off a little from the score, but aside from that, this is delicious. mouthfeel is of moderate body with soft carbonation and it lingers just long enough on your tongue. Not cloying, but it doesn't wash away too soon. If it didn't cost $4 a bomber, I would keep this in the fridge pretty often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Deconstructionis,4.45,This is probably my favorite IPA. I tend to prefer APA's which seem generally more flavorful and satisfying but this is a world class beer by any standard.  A deep amber with a substantial head for the style it smells of crisp hops and and slightly caramel. The taste is of course very hoppy but better balanced with rich malt flavor than are most IPAs. The qualilty of the ingredients and skill of the brewer is unmistakable. It's a surprisingly light bodied beer with moderate carbonation and just the slightest of alcohol warmth in the mouth. Despite it's very bold presence it is a beer you will want more than one.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheLiterati,4,"Pale golden-amber color, nice frothy head. Hops are quite evident in the citrusy aroma.  To say its a big, hoppy IPA seems almost gratuitous, even patronizing. This is a good, solid IPA, aggressive without being overconfident, and is a great representation of the style. Definitely drinkable!  I chose this IPA for a beer tasting I recently held for some beer neophytes. They absolutely loved it, and have declared that IPAs  specifically Stones  are their new favorite beer style!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheFeintingGoat,3.7,"Picked up a bottle at Goldstein's Deli - Wilkes Barre PA.  My first Stone offering here and with much to-do a pouring was made. A - Starts out a peach-amber color then warms up to a light copper with hints of melted caramel. A decent head lasts reduces, but lasts through the sitting. The smell is of mild peach and hops, with some raw bitter honey in there too. Aromatic Bitters can also be found. When taken in, the beer is quite mild and almost coy, but in a few seconds the tounge is ""bitten"" by this gargoyle. The swallow is where this beer shines with mint, resin, and arid textures coming out to play. Coming back up is a nice hop movement, which you can really feel in the chest area. The bites and pricks of this beer become more evident when kept in the mouth (good thing). I wanted to like this beer and, for the most part, i was not dissapointed. The beer was a bit watery in the front, and compared to something like 90 Minute IPA, wasn't near full bodied--it needs something beside that punch, which the whole beer seems to reside around, to engage the drinker. This accounts for my drinkability deductions. As for drinkabiliy, it does leave the mouth a bit dry, which I'm not taking off for, as this is the aim of this beer: to be aggressive and attack the mouth. I wish there was a style points catagory, as the beer seems to be like a Gargoyle swooping through the night, jumping off, falling, and then spreading his wings to soar upward. I may have gotten a less then stellar bottle, and I'll definiatly give this a shot again (if I did or didn't), but I""m sure this tastes much, much better on tap. Nice beer, and makes me look forward to the Arrogent Bastard sitting in my fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Lancer211,4.18,"22 oz bomber poured into an insulated tumbler. (after being taken out of the fridge for about 5-10 minutes)  A - A nice reddish copper color. Lacing is extensive, head is white, w/ fine bubbles and lasts forever and a day.  S - Citrus.... but mostly hops. Hops hops hops.  T - WOW... talk about a good IPA. Hops up front, with a slightly malty finish.... hops all the way through, and yet somehow balanced... amazing.  M - Carbonation is slightly less than average. Goes down quite smooth, with a bit of that 6.9% kick that you'd expect.  D - Yeah.... sadly, it'd be much more drinkable if it weren't an IPA... that abv does you in. I don't think they offer a 12oz version, but if they did, that'd make it just a little easier to session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,51mmz0rz,4.35,"Served from a 22oz bottle into a mug.  A: Clear, slight amber color. Nice head, with awesome staying power. An half inch sits on top at all times. Great lacing also.  S: Piney hopes and sweet malt lingers in the background.  T: Complex piney hops, with slight sweet malt, which is soon overtaken again by Hop flavors. They linger and fade into strong bitterness. Slight grassiness on the finish, but not unpleasant. Overall it tastes great.  M: Pretty full, with good carbonation. Slightly dry finish.  D: Dry finish and lingering bitterness maybe hurt it a little. My overall impression is that this is delicious when I'm in a hoppy mood.  Though I knew he malts were there, I was hoping for a bit more balance, but I guess that's why this is an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rgrace99,4.35,Poured from bottle to tulip glass. Nice thick frothy head that reduces to a thin line of froth with lots of lacing. Nicely efferevescent with excellent mouthfeel. Aroma and flavor were a wonderful citrusy hop flavor with a little bit of sweetness in the end. The hop flavor isn't as aggressive as in Ruination but excellent and well balanced. High ABV is the only thing keeping this from being an excellent session beer. Another great offering from Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MmmIPA,4.72,"A-Very clear for a ipa.Nice thick creamy head.Alot of bubbles ,nice retention.  T-Nice and hoppy,very Citrusy and a faint aftertaste of a flowery taste.

D-Recomended to anyone that loves a nce no thrills ipa.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tonloco,4.43,"One of my absolute favorites.  Classic American IPA Golden Orange, if not a little more vibrant and Cloudy than most.  Very Hoppy, Citrus and Grapefruit Dominate.  Smooth, Delicious, and I always want more, but the 6.9% keeps it from being a session beer, usually 2-3 pints and you are done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dewey0603,4.48,"This beer pours a creamy golden orange with a frothy off white head. An outstanding looking beer. The smell is all hops. The citrus hop aroma totally dominates this beer. Grapefruit or orange are the citrus smells that are the most strong. The tatse is really in your face hops. The crisp bitter hop flavor is really amazing. Smooth and refreshing, this beer could be a session beer if not the higher alcohol. The m/f is light with all the flavors blending well. An excellant beer that should not be missed. Cheers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ellisdee97,4.72,"A: Pours a cloudy golden orange, nice carbonation. Light egg shell white head leaves a slight ring and nice lacing.  S: Strong musky hops with an excellent malt balance. Citrusy floral hop notes come through as it airs out.  T: Hops bite hard up front with a dry malt and hop finish. Sweet malt balance lingers.  M: Carb bubbles hit the throat, then hops dry it out. Last you get a sweet malt aftertaste.  D: Insanely drinkable for the amount of crisp hop bite. One of the best IPA's ever IMO, but for the style alone it is an IPA on steroids.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BlindPig,4.18,"A- 1 ½ just off white head. Could see quite a bit of carbonation. Had a copper color and was very clear. It looked really crisp. The lacing covered the top and stuck to side of glass. S- Very hoppy smell. Floral hops. Kind of fruity. Could smell a hint of pot in it. Little malt in background T- Floral hops first taste with little bitter bite. Didnt taste much else and had a medium bitter aftertaste. M- Medium body, medium carbonation. Full flavor. D- Very good but prefer the Ruination. Not bitter enough for me either.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tonistruth,4.52,"A- dark straw color with a two finger frothy white head. Retent is awesome, and there is plenty o' lace on the glass.  S- strog strong citrus scents, some pine smell in there too, if there was anything thing else to sniff in there i didnt get it cause i couldnt bring myself away from that wonderful citrus scent.  T- plenty of hop flavors in there including citrus, pine, and grassy. Malt sweetness as well. bitter citrus finish, very nice and intriquing flavor. Sad that it loses intensity of it gets warmer.  M- smooth with a near dry finish, medium to light body. fantastic  D- Hophead or not, try this beer its a masterpiece. Since Hop Knot by Four Peaks (in Tempe,AZ) is on tap only, i will be spending time with this IPA in between visits to AZ. Would love to put this and Hop Knot head to head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dfried,4.67,"Clear golden, slightly orange in color. Frothy 2cm off white head. Some sweet malt in the background of the aroma, but its mainly floral and citrus hops, along with some other fruity notes. The taste is very similar to my favorite IPA, Bell's Two Hearted Ale (regionally biased opinion of course.) Just enough pale sweet malty backbone to balance out the outrageously awesome hops. They are mostly floral and perfume-y up front, but with a lot of citrus, orange and grapefruit, as well as some apricot. A few pine-y notes come as the beer goes down. Great silky smooth mouthfeel. Awesome representation of my favorite style? Of course I could drink these all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jlmjl,4.36,"I dont love the bottle, actually, Ive seen these type clear labels (recently on a Heiny bottle), not my favorite. It screams new technology and cheap. the Gargoyle stuff is cute,  A - Very odd actually, its that cloudy. Lacing is minimal in the beer I just poured. It didnt have too much of a head either, although as I write this, it has clearly maintained its' 1/4 inch head. The one thing I noticed, it bearly has any carbination (until I give it a good swirl)  S - It smells hoppy, buy by no means overly hoppy. Im not sure if I smell a mild citrus or taste it.  T - Awsome. Again, no question your are drinking an IPA but the hops is not overdone. This beer has a great balance to it. You alos know you are drinking a beer with some booze in it. Awsome. The taste lives up to the hype  M - Creamy is the only thing that comes to mind.  D - I have only had two of these so far, but there is no doubt this is a session brew. Great choice, who picked up this beer ?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,riversider76,4.35,"Pours a nice rich gold. One finger plus head, goes into a nice lace. Smell hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Pine,and citrus hops. Very nice. Body is fairly light, with just the right amount of carbionation. Taste is a smooth balance of hops and malt. This i the best IPA I've tried to date. Wow!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,EvilKeith,3.62,"Poured into the glass a hazed golden caramel color. The head began as two fingers of frothy white foam, that fell to a wispy cap. The cap became a halo of fine bubbles along the glass. By the end of the glass the clarity had improved greatly and any remnants of head had disappeared. The smell is big up-front citrusy hops, grapefruit, and sweet malty goodness. The taste is suprisingly malty sweetness, piney, and dry bittering hops. Medium bodied, Moderate carbonation.  I am actually beginning to really enjoy IPAs. DIPAs I'm still working on. This was actually enjoyable and not overpoweringly hopped or dry. I felt the lack of sustained head or any measurable lace detracted from my numbers. Not bad overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,teg8612,3.88,"A-Pours an orangy color with a nice foamy head.  S-Not very aromatic. Mellow hop with pine and lemon zest.  T-Sweet, citrus taste with pine-hoppy aftertaste. Bitterness stays but never becomes too much. Very balanced and not over the top like many IPA's. Very smooth and I can't detect the high ABV at all.  M-Good carbonation. The piney hops come back for round two with each appreciative belch from this brew. Medium without the bitter aftertaste to weigh down the palate.  D-This isn't an IPA that scares me. I like hops but not in the quantities that most IPA's use. This is just right. Very drinkable and would be a session beer if the ABV wasn't so high. Bottle is just as good but has a more acidic quality in the hops and slightly quicker bitterness build-up. Both are good, I just prefer the draft..",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Liquids,4.27,"Clear bright orangey yellow, with a one finger head that holds. Notably vapid carbonation. Teh aroma reminds me of 60 minute a bit, sweet, with floral and piney hops...smells complex, which for hops is a good thing. Taste is grapefruity bit penetratingly bitter. Not killer in it's bite, but the bitterness does linger. It's in amount of bitterness here not type, thing more like a lot of lower alpha bitterness rather than less high alpha bitterness...and its, again, complex with multiple kinds of hops I'd guess. Similar in style to 60 minute bit more straight bitterness and less in aroma. Leaves a tang on the tounge but it's not so cascade-like where it might linger infinitely past the point of enjoyment. Mouthfeel is not overwhelming but a bit high on carbonation, good for most. When I let this one stick around and decarbonate thought, I realizzed that it tasted mostly like hop water. the malt here is not that present. The complexity of the hop profile is what shines, and the alcohol is well hidden. This has good drinkability for an IPA, but one is plenty for me. I prefer 60 minute, but to each their own.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MusicmanSD,4.51,"Honestly, I think this is more bitter than Arrogant Bastard, but hey! It is definitely the best IPA to have ever graced my lips. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber with Stone's trademark ripping on the BMC idiots into a hefe glass and was pure orange with a nice head. In fact, the top half was all cream. Upon first whiff, it is all hops, wondering if you can finish the bottle! But you do because of the citrus and hop character found in about no other beer. The taste is amazing. The hoppiness lingers a good 30 minutes after you drink it (the buzz is another thing!). I was amazed at how well the head held throughout a whole 22 oz. bottle. It never dissipated to a ring, but left a good 2 cm of off white on top at all times, and I was very impressed by that. The mouthfeel is great and bitter, a definite sipper over time. Thats where the drinkability takes a whack, but the taste is by far the highlight of the beer! I am fast becoming a Stone fanatic, and living in San Diego is living the dream! Everyone needs to try this. An awesome, possibly elite? form of an IPA. And if you plan on drinking the bomber, have someone drive home!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

As a side note he also did very good impressions of Fat Bastard, and did more and more of them as the night wore on. Back to the task at hand though. I've never had an IPA before but knew it to be very well hopped. This was no exception to the style and was a very good beer by my standards. It poured a nice goldish orange color and I was immediately taken in by the nice smell of citrus and hops. The taste was awesome. It had a very crisp feel to it and the hops definitely came through. This is a style of beer I think I could grow to love very easily if they are all as drinkable as this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A real treat from sip to sip.  Nice light mouthfeel with the finish of a big beer, it coats the tongue.  I could drink a couple bombers easy or tackle the whole six pack if I was so inclined.

Quite a few little bubbles can be seen racing to the top.  S: Very stong smell of sweet fruitiness and lots and lots of piney hops.  T: This is a very aggressivly hopped beer. There is a little bit of sweetness in the first taste, but it is immidiatly overtaken by the hops and dosn't come back. The piney hops are there from begining to end and even in the aftertaste, although the aftertaste didn't linger very long which kind of surprised me.  M: Extremely smooth, small bubbles rapidly dance on the tongue while you take in the flavor. Goes down very easy.  D: This is a damn good IPA and very easy to drink. It goes down so smooth and taste so good I'm tempted to chug it like Gatorade. This is the essential summer beer. Tasty and very thirst quenching. I couldn't ask for more in a beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Im an IPA fanatic and after a recent string of Belgium samplings, this was a nice homecoming. Stone IPA has a big pine/hop taste that balances well with a sweet malt and citrusy fruit flavor. This leaves only a slight bitter aftertaste when compared to the Arrogant Bastard and the Ruination IPA.  This isnt the ""death by hops"" experience many IPA fanatics drool over but it is an excellent IPA to be enjoyed by both fanatics and neophytes to the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The best description of it would be this: Hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops and more hops. Nice color, thick head sticks to glass. Excellent almost permanent retention. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste hops again. Although for the amount of hops it has, it is still remarkably balanced. Nice medium to full bodied feel. Carbonation on par. Drinkability is great as long as you like hoppy brews. Awesome IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BDTyre,4.5,"My first IPA from Stone. Maybe the Ruination is better, but I've not had it yet.  Decent colour with a thin, clinging white head. Orange-amber, but maybe a little too light on the colour. Floral, hoppy smell. Lemon and citrus notes, with a yeasty-bread and malt hint and a very faint trace of grassiness. Very pleasant aroma, light on the nose and not cloying.  Great taste. Malt in the background with a definite hop bitterness. Lemony/floral hops flavours with a definite bite. This would accompany curry or any spicy food quite nicely. A not-unpleasant hoppy malt aftertaste. I've had some ""big"" American IPAs, but this is by far one of the most well-balanced, great tasting ones I've ever had.  Decent mouthfeel, but sometimes it feels a bit too carbonated. Very drinkable, especially on a hot summer night like tonight. I look forward to one day trying Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jwc215,4.45,"Poured orangish/copper with a thin, but well-retained white head. The smell was of citrusy hops. Very clean and inviting. The taste was of crisp, citrusy hops on a background of creamy malt. It was medium to thick bodied. Although hoppy, it was very well-balanced for the style. The hops were smooth and tasty. (Were it not for a touch too much salt, it would be perfect tasting.) The feel was a bitter sharpness balanced by a creaminess that left a refreshingly bitter feel. The alcohol is very well-hidden. Overall, it is a smooth, hoppy - but, not ridiculously so - so the balance is wonderful - A great brew and a near-perfect example of the style. Very enjoyable!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BabaJohn,4.29,"It's official: I'm on a bit of an IPA kick. Had a delicious home brew at a wedding a week or two ago and tried a Stone at Sunset the other day. Enjoyed it so much I had to get another and review it.  Pours clear amber with some hints of deep orange. A nice head leaves shapes and patterns clinging to the side of the glass. The nose is straight up delicious with some fruity, herbal, IPA fragrances. The bitter hop taste is the focus of this beverage, though it is balanced a bit by sweet citrus. This taste keeps growing and changing as you drink. Mouthfeel = smooth and wonderful. Just a note: this is not necessarily a quick drinking beer and due to its intense bitter flavor some timing is necessary in regards to accompanying food and the beers to come. Im certainly contemplating breaking out a bit of cheese.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rkowalick,4.55,"Poured from a bottle into a glass mug. Gorgeous off-white clumpy head that made me smile with glee. A rich golden amber color, definately screams ""I'm an awesome IPA, drink me NOW!"" The smell was what I imagine a hops field smells like. Very grassy, hoppy, with that little hops citrus kick. The taste was AMAZINGLY delicious. The hops attacks, smooths, cools, chills, whatever. I loved it. it was so deep, citrusy, grassy, and all of the above. SO MUCH HOPS. The mouth feel was heavy, and dark. I loved it. The drinkability is way too high for something this hoppy. Glad I have 5 more, and a liquor store with half a dozen more six packs!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BradBLR,4.03,"First time I have reviewed this beer. Poured a lightish amber color with a white head. Head lasted for most of the beer with fairly good lacing. The smell was a strong hoppy smell, different from what I expect from and IPA, not the typical cascade hops.  Taste was a strong hop flavor, similar to ruination but lacking the malt of ruination. There were some hints of citrus and tart malt. The mouthfeel was good, carbonation was just right, and the thickness was perfect.  All in all a really great beer that will probably become one of my standards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Damian,4.13,"Poured a deep amber-yellow with a small white head.  Smell was quite hoppy with hints of pine, apricots, citrus and mild spices.  Taste was similar to smell but more pronounced - clean and clear, rich and flavorful. Alcohol was very well hidden and definitely crept up on me later in the drink. With so much hop flavor and such a generous ABV, it was incredible how it lacked the bitter finish and relative harshness of many other IPA's.  Moderate carbonation. Quite drinkable.  This beer sets the standard of a great all-around IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Golden2wenty1,4.48,"22oz bomber smuggled back to Madison from Lake Havasu Cit, AZ over Spring Break. Cracked open over the World Cup 3rd place match b/w Germany and Portugal.  Pour is a light, vibrant golden yellow with a generous couple fingers of snow-white head and lacing even Grandma would be proud of.  Nose is ripe with dripping grapefruit/piney hops, apricot, and husky malt.  Taste starts off with vanilla/caramel malt, juicy citrus/pine resin bittering hops and just a hint of that 6.9% booze.  Nice and light in the mouth, slick with moderate tingling carbonation.  Just a fantastic IPA here. Drinkable beyond belief, refreshing as all get out. Impossible to complain about. Stone, you distribute in Wisconsin RIGHT NOW!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,expatsteve,4.26,"Appearance: 1/2 head, with a nice thick cover remaining on the beer. Golden amber color, with medium/high visibility. Low viscosity.  Aroma: Grapefruit, honey, with light plum malts in the finish.  Taste: Nice blend of bananas, grapefruit and lemon. Hops are really well balanced, providing a great floral end to the flavor and good but not oppressive bitterness. Light body develops soy bean finish as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully smooth finish that I didn't expect from an IPA. Low carbonation is almost creamy in its effect, and further allows a full floral hop development.  Drinkability: This is the epitome of a session IPA - lighter body balances a full-flavored hop bouquet. Every mouthful was a delight, even for a non-hop fan like me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HoustonTX,4.58,"22oz. bomber, served into a Duvel tulip.  A - Deep golden color, which poured a frothy white head with excellent retention. Lacing was very prominent, and all over the glass.  S - Smell is quite hoppy, yet quite well balanced with florals/spice/citrus blending together nicely.  T&M - Hop bomb. Delicious cascade hops round out the medium body of this brew. Earthy tones, as well as floral, grassy, piney, and citrus flavors balance the hops wonderfully. Bitterness does not stay for long, and fades to an oily, yet refreshing mouthfeel.  D - Drinkability is high. Easy to drink. Nice ABV.  Overall, a top-notch IPA. This beer really sets the standard on the style, and brings it's own little bit of uniquness to the mix as well. Another fine offering from Stone Brewing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GregoryVII,3.65,"Dark straw color with a medium head. The scent was very zesty/piney. Mouthfeel is smooth. The alcohol was noticeable but not overdone or overpowering. Malt was a little on the light side of what I like, even for an IPA. The hop flavor was strong and refreshing; a little predictable, but it's done right so it is hard to find blame with that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,KyleVick4,4.37,"12 oz  A: Poured a beautiful thick head which did the guines cascade effect which thrilled me. Cloudy golden beer with a touch of very light copper in the center.  S: Oh man. This is glorious. All kinds of spicy herbal piney hops that are screaming drink me! I think the piney smells are the most prominent, with the spicyness close behind them. The smell is simply awesome. If I could give this a 6.0 for this category I would.  T: Spicy hops are for sure in the front of the taste. Followed by a quick refreshing herbal sting, then surprisingly a brief taste of malt. Very well done, wish it had a little more malt backbone though,  M: Surprisingly light bodied and maybe a tad over carbonated. Not a huge fan of the body, but I bet it would taste great on a hot summer day.  D: Mmmmm this is a tasty brew. I think I could drink another and another. The 6.9% abv is not prominent and I think I could bring the beer to my lips for the smell alone. Since it is a refreshing beer it helps the drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NolateM,4.85,"Poured into a pint glass. This beer pours shimmering clear-orange with a thick frothy white head, some decent lacing.  The aroma is citrusy and hoppy, bright with orange-zest.  The flavor is the definition of the IPA. Just the right amount of hops to put it a little bit over the top, just the right bitterness, just the right amount of more-than-subtle citrusy acidity, just a tiny bit of pine-like flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect, it goes down so incredibly smooth, finishes clean but still lingers just a tiny bit so you don't forget how great it is. It doesn't taste AT ALL like 6.9% alcohol.  This might be the smoothest IPA on the face of the earth. This is what it's all about. This is why I love India Pale Ale.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,spaceranger,4.08,"If you've tried this one nothing needs to be said. If you haven't - go get one right now. This stuff is what it's all about. Perfect appearance, perfect aroma, perfect mouthfeel and drinkable beyond 95% of everything that's out there. I love it, you'll love it, we all love it. Stone is king. Mmmm, delicious... I gotta go...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,InsolublePancake,4.55,"A- Nice deep golden color with a big, frothy white head. Much sticky lacing as well.  S- Hops aplenty. Piney, floral, citrusy hops. Pretty much every aroma that can be associated with hops is in here. If I try real hard I think I can make out some sweet malt, but not much. The aroma is all about the hops, and it is outstanding.  T- Signature Stone flavor. The hop profile is the highlight here, but with more of a spicy, floral flavor than citrus. Malt is surprisingly noticeable, with a bit of toastiness and sweetness coming through in the end. Bitterness is present, but not at all overpowering. In fact, the bitterness combined with the lingering hop and malt flavors makes for an extremely pleasant aftertaste.  M- Maybe a little thin, but that makes the beer all the more drinkable.  D- The malt provides just enough balance to make this beer very pleasant and dangerously drinkable.  Fantastic, one of my favorite regular IPA's. I absolutely love Stone's use of hops. This beer is unique, which is great in a world with so many similar IPA's. Highly recommended to anyone who likes hoppy beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cameraman,4.5,"When it is poured in the glass it is a lite amber color with hint a hint of yellow at the bottom. A nice head forms, an inch high, and dissappates slowly down the glass. A nice aroma of hops hit the nose with earthy, piney, floral aromas. The taste surprisingly starts with jolt of malt, then the hops begin to take over, with that bitterness one expects for an IPA. In the mouth it feels a bit thin, but it coats the palate evenly, and has nice dry finish. This is very drinkable beer, a hop heads stand by beer. I am just glad I have another one to enjoy, this is an excellent beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mcowgill,4.3,"A - slightly hazy peach color with nice head and lacing on the glass.  S - nice pine, citrusy aroma  T - Great hops explosion with hints of grapefruit and citrus fruit.

It's gotta be one of the better ones out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,errantnight,4.63,"On the short list of my favorite beers. This one was a 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a gorgeous, absolutely clear, and incredibly rich, gold. With lively head and lacing. This baby clings all the way down.  The nose is incredibly floral, with citrus and berry notes. This is what hops smell like! Ok, that might be a lie... but this is what hoppy beer smells like! When it's Stone IPA! I love this... it doesn't quite enter the realm of some more potent DIPAs (or other styles with more intense yeast notes)... but it's slightly sweet and so, so so enticing.  And this is the IPA by which I judge all others. It is clearly of a different beast than Masala or HopDevil (with their toasted malt flavors and richer flavor), on the light side of medium bodied and with very moderate malt notes. which really just provide enough body and hint of sweetness to bring out the hop flavors. This beer really exemplifies the glory of hops. There's floral (particularly rose) hints all over the place, the citrus flavor is very mild (I get very little acid/ester here, considering), and the finish is clean, and there's a slightly sweet aftertaste (the only minor notch I take off on the drinkability side, there are slightly ""cleaner"" IPAs... although when the beer tastes this good, I'm ok with less than clean). The carbonation is medium to strong, but it breaks mid-swallow and is EXCEEDINGLY smooth on the back end. Where I've found other IPAs to reach an almost oily consistency, this never sticks out to that extent, but really smooths things out.  A great summer beer, or spring beer, or fall beer, or anytime beer. There's enough complexity to pair with a wide variety of offerings (although I'll always be inclined to think Mexican as a top choice). An absolute must for any hop fan, or anyone who's past the all-macro stage.  Heaven in a bottle. And it tastes better (that I can detect) from a bomber. And it's better than that on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,normZurawski,4,"Good, well balanced all around. This is the best of the Stone beers available in NJ. Of those I have tried, this is the only one that doesn't overdo the hoppy bitterness. While it does have a bit of a rough finish, it's not out of line with what an IPA should laste like. Light citris but a little short of how I like it, especially in the aroma. Good solid IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Illinick,4.3,"A: Typical Stone gargoyle screen printed bottle with typical garb on back. Deep golden in color with a big, rocky head that dissipates to a slight head and ring. Good lacing throughout consumption. S: Citrusy hops and some spice dominant the first half of the whiff with some sweet maltiness coming through towards the end of the sniff. Some caramel notes in that malty smell also, as well as some herbal and pine notes coming through. T: Good dose of bitter citrus and citrus rind flavors paired against a nice malt profile that exhibits sweet malt and caramel flavors. Slight cake in there also. Oily hops, pine and some grassiness coming through in the flavor as well. A bit of spice in there too. Good balance of flavors with a respectable hop bite and malty sweetness - the malty flavors off set the 70+ IBUs well. Ever so slight alcohol warmth in there as the brew warms. MF: Chewy at times, medium and finishes clean and with a bite. Overall: A quality ""big"" IPA that is well balanced and provides a good bitter bite for a hop head. The malts are matched well against the citrus and overpowering hops and makes this brew easy to drink. The IBUs are above 70, but dont let that scare you-it is well balanced and finishes clean. Not for the novice palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kgotcher,4.32,"22 oz bomber  Nice pale, slightly copper color with a one finger white head.  Huge hoppy aroma, Fresh hops, earthy pine, even some citrus. Light caramel malt. Medium body, good carbonation, Bitter and dry finish, a bit mouth puckering.  Big hoppy flavor with nice light caramel maltyness managing to come through. Lots of bitterness from beginning to end tends to hide the malt profile but there is a bit of sweet maltyness.  A very tasty but highly hopped IPA. Hoppy bitterness makes it hard to drink much of anything after this. Kind of kills the pallate but in a nice way.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AlesRTasty,4.37,"Kudos to Stone for making this IPA, it's a good one.  A - Pours amber with white head and good lacing. S - Fantastic smell, like taking a wiff of a bag of hops. Just a non-modest hop aroma T - I actually expected more from the way its nose but still very delicious. Crisp, light and hoppy. M - I like my IPAs to be a bit more carbonated but this one was a typical carbonation level. D - If only I bought another one, that's what I was thinking when I was done.  If you like IPAs this one is one to not miss.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DaPeculierDane,3.81,"Brought back to Wisconsin from Ledgers in Berkeley, CA. 22 oz bomber.  Appearance: Fantastic head. Thick, creamy, cloud of sticky, floating goodness. Head rescinds to a quarter inch and cannot be reinvigorated because this beer lacks any visible carbonation. It is not, however, flat. The bodys color is beautiful peachy amber.  Nose: Dry pine. A little unripened grapefruit.  Taste: Hops. Tons of hops. Mostly pine. Caramel malt is barely distinguishable from the hops. Some toast and bread. Grapefruit zest and melon.  Mouthfeel: Not as bitter as the smell and taste would let on but bitter enough. Decently balanced. Medium body. Smooth but quite dry in the finish.  Drinkability: Very high.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

A great balance of malt and hop.  Mouthfeel: Nice, not too thick to drink in summer, not too watery. Very nice.  Drinkability: I could drink this all day (and night).  Notes: By far one of the best if not the best regular IPA in the land. It took 2 weeks to get the keg from CA to PA, but well worth the wait.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,trep,4.77,"Orange and crystal clear below a creamy white head. Leaves a good bit of lace as it fades.  Aroma is solid, fruity hop juices and floral aromas. A little bit of a wheatiness to it and no, i'm not talking the breakfast of champions...although this might qualify.  Smooth and sweet wheatiness initially that melds with sweet juicy hops to form an awesomeness that melds so nicely I can't even put it into words. Incredibly balanced.  Not too oily and not too full. Appropriate carbonation and body. Medium-Full, closer to medium. Such a tastey brew that I could drink day in and day out. The last time I had this was when I first turned 21 and now I can really appreciate all of the flavors and aromas that this one brings with it. Truely a world class IPA in a world that is dominated by over-the-topness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gbarron,3.55,"From a 22 oz. bottle.  A - light golden, clear. Head includes a plethora of different sized bubbles, leaving nice lacing, and solid head retention. Pretty beer.  S - great smelling IPA, strong notes of citrus, pine, fresh cut flowers. Well balanced with caramel, toffee notes of malt. Hints of higher alcohols.  T - one of the sweeter, maltier IPA's I've ever had, and a big surprise coming from Stone. Nice hop flavor of pine, fresh hops, but malt is a bit overwhelming. Definitely on the sweet side, with lots of malt sugar, caramel, toffee. Almost syrupy. Firm alcohol taste, also. Not very much bitterness.  M - medium bodied, carbonation is average. Sweet, sticky finish.  D - an interesting brew, but way too sweet for an IPA, in my opinion. Alcohol content is also prohibitive of having more than a couple in a session. This appears to basically be a smaller version of Arrogant Bastard. I know alot of people rave about this beer, but I think it's pretty unbalanced and not one of the better examples of an IPA. I'll pass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Nutleybeer,3.38,"Got a chance to try this on tap. Stone beers seem to be popping up all over now a days.  It had a typical, floral-like smell, which is common in most IPAs. Actually pretty strong, which made it so deceiving the flavor was quite mild and not as hoppy as I would have expected.  I am not the biggest IPA fan, but this was pretty good. As noted, I didn't find it overly hoppy, so if that is what you are looking for, you may want to try something else.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,shererjt,3.54,"Poured a hazy reddish-amber with a huge, billowy head and tons of carbonation. Nose was piney/citrusy hops all the way. Lots of fruit. IPA smell to the extreme, and one of the better-smelling beers around. Plenty of hop flavor and bitterness, though not quite enough malt to balance it. Still, very tasty if a bit over-the-top. Body was on the light side of medium, which I found rather interesting considering the hop wallop it packs. Drinkability was pretty good.  I like this one, though (apparently) not as much as some. The aroma is top-notch; just think it needs a bit more caramel sweetness to smooth it out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,neenerzig,4.73,"Ahh. The perfect and full bodied IPA. Stone IPA is special to me because it is the first IPA I ever had. Poured into my pint glass. The 22 oz. bottle pours a perfectly clear gold color with a nice thick white foamy head, about 2 inches thick that lingers for quite sometime. Eventually it settles to a very nice surface layer with excellent lace. There is definitely some hop bitterness going on here in both smell and taste. Nice, floral hoppy smell. Also strong citrus scents here. A crisp, frothy, creamy, and smooth taste. Flavors of hops and well... more hops along with some grapefruit. Also a slight bit of alcohol can be tasted as well as some malty hints. Just the right amount of bitterness for an IPA. A bit of a dry and bitter aftertaste. A nice and warm feeling starts to creep up after a few sips. Has a crisp and frothy, full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Finishes clean.

147,88,scottoale,4,"From the 22oz. brown bomber pours an orange-amber ale with an inch of off-white creamy head. A nice sticky web lacing left behind, as the ale disappears.  Spicy fresh hops, very citrus of lemon and orange and a light malt in the background. Smells very refreshing (and hoppy).  Slightly sweet, mainly of citrus as it fills the mouth, then turns tea like for a second or so only to be overtaken by the powerful bittering hops. The hops really shine in this IPA, as this is what an IPA is all about. Especially an American IPA and even more so coming from Stone.  Clean and refreshing with ample body and a creamish mouthfeel. Fair ABV and a great hoppy taste, drink this one up hopheads! Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smell is powerfully hopped and with some significant citrus.  Taste is gloriously bitter and crisp. This is a consequential IPA.You aren't left wondering where the hops are. Let it warm up a little and the flavors come to life even more.  Mouthfeel is satisfying. It always seems to be highly carbonated and active.  Drinkability is its strength.

The nose was nice and light. Quite hoppy. Herby and piney, some sweetness also. Both the appearance and smell really make you want to drink the beer.  The first taste is sweet up front. Nice and malty and spicy. Although very hoppy, I think the malt balances the hoppiness very well. There's a little citrus as well. This is a stronger beer, but not heavy in the least. As hoppy as it is, you'd think there would be more aftertaste, but there is not. Overall an outstanding IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I have drank at least one of these each day since I bought the case and I have to say that they all have bottled pretty well. The beer pours a rich amber color with a small head. Aroma is hoppy and quite citrusy. The taste begins with citrus fruits, with orange peel and grapefruit being the most prevalent. The aftertaste is clean with a nice hop bitterness, but not too bitter to be a bother. The mouthfeel is smooth with med carbonation. The drinkabiliy is high, I have had two or three at a time without losing the subtleness or balance of the beer. Perhaps the best offering from Stone to date.

147,88,edmundfitzoil,4.15,"Stone IPA poured from a 22 oz. brown bomber bottle and poured into a standard pint glass.  Stone's IPA poured a sharp golden copper with an inch of white, large bubbled head that stayed through half way down the glass and left large bubbled lacing around the top ring of the pour. Thousands of co2 bubbles slowly raced to the top of the glass; they just want to be free. They just want to be free. The nose is big, big citrussy hops. Stone's IPA was hoppy oily over my pallette with dry finish and nice, medium mouthfeel. Slightly unbalanced, this IPA is an ode to the hops, and I couldn't agree more. This is a solid west coast style IPA that sits up there with some of the best and remains readily available pretty widely around the country.  This one also gives great hop belches.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tonytuffnuts,4.67,"Bomber purchased from Kraig's Kegs.  Light/golden amber body with thick frothy three finger head. Head fades unevenly into a rocky, enduring foam, which leaves a sticky lace on my glass. The head's exciting, but the golden hue to the body doesn't do justice to its complexity.  The smell is so divine! I feel like I'm sticking my head into a jar full of hop pellets. But it's not offensive since the caramelly malt aromas pass when I really get my nose down into my glass. There's an uncertain fruit representation there too.  The malt isn't as powerful as its smell. Not as sweet as I had expected, but leaves sugars on the back of my tongue. There's a faint nutmeg spice that tingles on my tongue when I let the beer settle in my mouth. Masking fruits mute the hop bitterness toward the end, reminding me of a breakfast grapefruit covered in sugar. NOTE: Isn't as bitter as the bottle boasts.  Very oily mouthfeel. Carbonation's pretty strong--maybe the only thing I'd change because it numbs my pallate some.  I was more of a malt guy before I tried this and the Sothern Tier Unearthly. Now I'm psyched for summer and big bodied, hoppy IPAs. If you want to taste what dry hopping contributes to a beer, try this. This beer shows why craft/micro brewers are engineers: it takes such knowledge of hops to pick the right combination for a taste so seamless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Cresant,4.02,"Poured this 12 oz. undated AIPA, straight from the fridge, into a Stone IPA pilsner/flute.  Achieved a 1"" head that disapated to a lace ring rather quickly. Color was an opaque orangy brown that cleared as it warmed.  Aroma was citrus and bread. Cut pine wood and dried apricots. Nice, but not as hoppy as predicted.  Taste was juicy sweet citrus balanced by a crisp, dry, pleasantly bitter finish. Not as multidimensional as Bell's Two Hearted Ale, yet interesting and refreshing.  Mouthfeel was a bit oily with low carbonation. Nothing extraordinary.  Very drinkable despite the higher 6.9% ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SwillBilly,4.35,"Its about time I reviewed Stone IPA, I've had this so many times I can't even count. Well anyway, here we go. Poured from 12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Pours a dark gold, almost the color of hay Fairly clear with a nice, densely packed head. Ample lacing is left on the glass as I drink.  Smell: Hints of citrusy hops waft out of the glass, also fruity and herbal scents make an appearance. The fruitiness coming from an almost apricot like scent.  Taste: Those citrusy hops dominate the beginning, a slightly sweet, fruity middle transitions to a big citrusy, piny hop finish that is linges long on the tongue. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Not slick or oily.  Drinkability: Stone IPA is highly drinkable. An outstanding IPA that is worth seeking out. Nice and hoppy but it doesn't hit you over the head with them. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile, and I could definitely throw a bunch of these back, but the 6.9 % abv will suddenly make itself know. A fantastic beer that is always welcome in my DBF. Stone IPA is another reason why Stone is considered one of the best craft brewers in America.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pbr85,3.9,"Bottle to a pint glass A: Pours a hazy, golden yellow with a shining white head. Beer is hazy and difficult to see through. S: Hops (obviously). Piney and earthy hops. T: Pretty standard tase for an AIPA. Piney hops up front with a sourdough malt backbone. M: Very smooth and slick going down. You can feel the hop oils on your tongue. D: I'm a little underwhelmed with this, maybe I was just over-hyping it. Definetly would go for another IPA first, but this is still pretty good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,audiojon,4.25,"A solid brew that is an absolute standby. I am fortunate enough to be able to get this straight from the brewery quite often, but even when I am away from Southern California, I frequently find myself grabbing sixers of this. It's available at many supermarkets, fortunately, and this always does in a pinch. However, this is a beer that earned its stripes before heading to larger markets, and as such is worth a try whether you can get it everywhere or nowhere. Poured into my goblet, it glows a wonderful golden brown, with a nice creamy head. Scent is immediately citrus, very clean and very refreshing. The taste further refreshes, nothing is overwhelming, everything is perfectly balanced. This isn't a huge hop bomb, but it makes for a near perfect IPA. If you're looking for hops, head for Ruination, which we shouldn't forget started life as an IPA.  A delicious brew, I plan to quaff many of these this summer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChuckD,4,"12oz bottle poured into a Saratoga Brewpub pint glass. Minimal whitish lacing atop a cloudy, copper body.  To the nose, it's all about pine, fruit and malts. Very pungent, but not one jumps out at you. A harbinger of things to come.  In the mouth, the smells are verified in layer after layer of floralness, juicy fruits and butterscotch sweetness. The melding of the sweet malts and the hops almost result in a beer with no taste character.  The feel is full and substantial for an IPA. It covers your tongue and is perfectly carbonated. It finishes grassy and organic. Very fresh mown and green.  Musings: Obviously a highly drinkable IPA. The tastes are so well contrived that the result is close to being pedestrian. No over the top flavors here. What there is a high alcohol quencher that will easily get you in trouble.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IntriqKen,4.38,"Poured dark straw golden yellow with a 1"" head that melts ever so slowly to thick wonderful lacing. Aroma instantly of citrus hops. Taste is an incredible balance of malt and fresh, FRESH hops....ending in hop bitterness...slight grapefruit bitterness. Mouthfeel is warm and thick for this style. This may be 7% but it is highly quenching and very sessionable. I hate to keep rating Stone brews so high, but DAMN they are consistently good...VERY good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tawnos,4.25,"Appearance: Pours an amazing golden color, clear and bubbly. Two fingers of head cling lightly to the sides of the glass. The head persists for quite a while.  Smell: Hoppy and spicy. Grass and summer days mix with the flowery hop smell to give the perfect IPA smell.  Taste: Less sharp than expected by the smell. Subdued yet sweet hop taste leave a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. There is very little alcohol or malt flavoring present. Acids linger and the beer tastes more bitter in aftertaste than while drinking. This beer screams ""craft IPA.""  Mouthfeel: somewhat watery, fizzy. The after feel leaves you a bit dry due to the high hop acidity. Very typical for the style, well handled.  Drinkability: I could drink a few of these, but it's no session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mitchel,4.26,"Stone IPA pours a golden-orange color with a rocky white head. The head holds for a good while and leaves moderate lacing. It is a little hazy and looks almost viscous. The smell is great! Nice floral aroma with lots of obvious hops. It smells slightly fruity and again, hop-tastic. Yeah, I said it! What?  Well, it tastes hoppy. Hoppy goodness galore. It is nicely bitter, incredibly smooth and very crisp. There is a hint of grain and sourdough bread with a light sweetness. It finishes with just a minute bit of lemon. It is a strong beer but has lots to like in the experience.  I wasnt expecting to like this beer going into it but I was swayed by another great beer from a great brewery. This beer is incredibly hoppy. If you dont dig on the hops, stay away. If you do, check it out. It is fantastic. Damn those cool bottles. I would probably buy cat pee if it was bottled by Stone in one of those awesome bottles! Hmmm...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,malty,4.34,"Poured a slightly chilled hazy golden orange with a thick white 1"" head. Nice lacing.  Gloriously balanced sweet & tart scents of pale malts and lots of fresh hops. FRESH amarillo (?) & cascade (?) hops floating above a bed of sweet fresh whipped cream and vanilla. Probably the best smelling IPA for me to date.  The flavors of the hops are well developed and extremely fresh, lingering and tingling my gums way past the finish. The sweet malty flavors are a bit more in the background, different than what I expected from the smell. Citrus flavors and melon rind are prevalent with a juicy finish.  Mouthfeel is great. Fine carbonation that dissipates pretty quickly making this a highly drinkable ale. Medium bodied with a long flavorful finish.  Thanks to mattcrill for this gem. Wish I could get Stone in Michigan. I would definitely like to put a sixer of this in my fridge, alongside Two Hearted (it's that good). Bravo to Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheBungyo,4.97,"Pablo Piccaso would have trouble crafting a masterpiece such as this. The stiff white cream head finishes off this brew as you'd imagine a master chef with a perfect garnish would. Nose is massive pine, followed by a mix of grapefruit and caramel. I have to be honest, the smell is as devine as any beer lover could hope. Taste is a tour of hops ...pine, graprefruit, lemon, peach and finally caramel. This is probably the perfect IPA. Mouthfeel is suitably creamy and drinkablility is near perfect. A rugged yet sessionable beer that everyone with any sense will respect. Thank you Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,instrumentality,4.5,"This one poured out a transparent orange-caramel color with a thin (1/4"") head that quickly dissolved.  The scent was a mixture of fruity sweetness with a slight minty/piney layer.  The first sip burned slightly going in, but went down smoothly and crisply with gentle carbonation. Further sips proved easy on the palate.  The taste was easy on the palate; hoppy but not overwhelmingly so, and bitter without coating the mouth and leaving a lingering, uncomfortable aftertaste like some similar beers do. The flavor was a mix of hops and grapefruit (very subtle on the grapefruit--I hate grapefruits but I liked this).  This is not what I would consider to be a significantly complex beer; rather, just a nice, simple, hoppy flavor, well-balanced and smooth.  When I originally wrote this review I wrote ""I'm still on the lookout for an IPA with more prevalent flavors to compliment the hops. In the meantime, relative to the handful of other IPA's I've tried, this one is king.""  I've since tried several other IPA's with this in mind, and I've found that several of them do integrate other flavors, including caramel in one case and pear in another. I also drank about half a dozen 22 oz. bottles of Stone IPA in the intervening time. I now realize that the pure piney hop flavor of Stone IPA is superior to these attempts to enhance the complexity. I'm still keeping an open mind, but Stone continues to be the reigning champion of IPAs for me, and is probably the most drinkable beer for its strength of any that I've tried.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sacfly,4.52,"22oz No date Pours a clear golden color with a thick head of large white bubbles. Huge pine, yet sweet aroma. A touch of lemon citrus. Taste is more pine balanced with a sweet undertone of malt. Bitterness lingers long into the aftertaste. Sticky, resinous hops coat the mouth, but it is not astringent. This is what an IPA should be. Great craftsmanship in the design of this recipe. Infinitely drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SethB2,4.53,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours a semi-transparent orangish color with nice fluffy head that retains for what seens like forever. When it finally does calm a bit, it leaves evidence in the form of sticky lacing down the walls of the glass. Smells great. Grapefruit and pine hops up from followed by malty sweet goodness. Flavor is just as nice as the smell. Hops dominate, but this beer is exceptionally well balanced. Mouthfeel and drinkablity are both excellent. I would love to have another .. and I think I will.  I could easily give this beer fives across the board, and might update it later. Until then, I'm still searching for the perfect IPA, but I think I may have already found it. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,evanackerman,4.13,"beer pours a nice light orange, very clear, nice white head that lasts a long time.  aroma is totally dominated by American hops, smells very appealing.  taste is also dominated by hops, although not nearly as citrusy as many American IPAs, there is a nice malt element as well. overall a very delicious IPA  mouthfeel is medium viscosity, very nice.  Drinkability is pretty good although one or two is enough for me.  overall, one of my favorite IPA's very very nice, if i had access to this in Michigan i would buy it regularly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,doubleipa,3.8,"Deep orange in color with an nice white head that eventually just leaves a film. Medium carbonation. As expected, good aroma of pine, citrus, and resin. Quite a bit less than the Ruination. Overall, this is a good IPA, but not as good an IPA as Ruination is a DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,burnstar,4.53,"Pours a clear dark amber with a big rocky white head that leave fantastic lacing on the glass. Aroma is powerful citrus hops. Taste - wow this is some intense citrusy hop flavor! There is some great sweet malt backbone here too but I wouldn't exactly call it balanced but it's an IPA after all and it doesn't have to be balanced to be delicious - which it is. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and creamy, nicely carbonated. This is a great beer and is quite drinkable despite it hugeness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,artusory,4.1,"Pours light amber with a big white head that fades to a light cover. Nice lacing. Aroma is pine and grapefruit, with some malt underneath. The flavor is good on the citrus and pine with a nice caramel malt backbone. Good balance and very easy drinking. Not quite up to the level of the top IPAs however.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NJpadreFan,4.35,Stone IPA  Appearance- light mahogany brown with a touch of orange and a huge white head. Decent lacing throughout. Smell- sweet candy malt with a nice touch of grapefruit rind . Taste- Sweet malt blended with a pine hop. Strong pine with a citrus taste slighty overpowered by the malt. Mouthfeel- Sweet up front but a nice bitter dry pine flavor in the backend.  Overall- Another good IPA that I didn't fully appreciate in the past. I've since come around and can't get enough of these full bodied IPA's.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,funkmaster229,4.77,"Irecently re-discovered this beer and was reminded, as I took my first sniff in awhile, why this is my standard for american ipa. With fresh bottles easily accessable and exceedingly more bars carrying stone products on draft there's no excuse for any to miss out on this one.  color: straw to gold with a peachy hue. tight, white head.  aroma: slightly sweet initially, but immediately slapped me with fresh hoppy funk and a little estery zest.(chinook? galena?) In the back I find mixed nut and old hop/cheese notes.  taste: exploding with fresh and seperate malt and hop flavors. beautifully balanced in the mouth and at the finish leaving a brand of that hop profile seared into the brain for days. I love the fact that I'm intrigued, but not overwhelmed with complexity. One with a more tuned pallate could peel away at this one for a while, but you still can't help needing to just drink the damn thing.  In THIS style, I find myself hard-pressed to find a better beer. I think I'm going to need some cashews and stilton cheese with this one next time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wcudwight,4.62,"Many thanks to jhammerly for providing this much anticipated offering. Poured into an Imperial Pint glass. Pours a nice copper color with a 1/2"" sticky white head. Sticky white lace lines the sides of the glass. Classic IPA look. Smell: Wonderful floral hop aroma. Smells better than a new spring garden. Taste: The hops hit you up front and they hit you hard! Piny and grassy hops with a mild sweet malt and alcohol finish to kind of clean the palate for another gulp. Delicious! Mouthfeel: Sticky oily hop mouthfeel. Drinkability depends on how much you like the hop bitterness. If you are not a hop head then this would be a sipping beer. But to hopheads this is a gulping beer. Overall a highly recommended IPA that is the standard for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PBRstreetgang,4.25,"Pours golden with an orange tint and excellent clarity. A white, one finger head of semi-dense foam shows good retention and leaves sticky lacing. Big american hop aroma of chinook and cascade like grapefruit/citrus with a mild grassy tone; background toasted pale malt. First sip is sweet toasted pale malt, followed by a rush of herbal hop bitterness. Slightly fruity, but not estery at all which I like. The aftertaste is dry and bitter with a fresh cut whole hop flavor. The pale malt is simple but strong enough for a great balance against the complex hop character. The flavor is dry, bitter, sweet and fruity all at once. Mild carbonation and medium bodied for a smooth mouthfeel that breaks up the bitterness without being overly carbonated. The finish is dry with a hop resin taste and alpha acid bite, but it fades quick enough and retains a high drinkability. A wonderfully satisfying American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RonfromJersey,4.55,"Nice to be able to use the Stone IPA glass I got for Christmas for its intented beer.  Pours a bright gold with a bit of haze, topped by thick column of soft, very bubbly, pure white froth. Excellent lacing.  Nicely assertive citrusy nose - grapefruit, orange, lemon, bit of apricot.  Sweet caramelly malt gets a big foot in the door first, but very quickly the hops are there to slather on like suntan lotion on an Irish guy at the San Diego beach. That's not to say it isn't balanced though. Hoppy yes, but the malt side lurks about through to the finish.  Good mouthfeel, substantial. Excellent drinkability.  An all around winner of a west coast American IPA. As Bob Dylan would say: ""Everybody must get Stone.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cubedbee,4.05,"22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass, this beer is a cloudy golden color with two fingers of off-white head which sticks around for a few minutes. Very nice rings of lace left behind on the glass. Nose is full of flowery and perfumy hops, slight amount of citrus, and a hint of doughy biscuits. Taste starts out with a rather sweet malt and then hits you with loads of flowery hops giving way to a gently bitter finish. Very nice delicate hops meld well with the strong pale malt for a very drinkable balanced IPA. Hop bitterness seems a little too subdued at first, but builds as you make your way through the glass. Medium bodied, medium/low carbonation, and an absolutely silky smooth feel. This is a nice enough IPA, solid and balanced, but really is something you'd rather have in 12 oz bottles than in a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheSarge,4.43,"This is a most impressive IPA  Starting off with Stones IPA appearance, you can easily see there's lots of carbonation as it's poured. Once poured, the head easily lasts for two to three minutes, leaving a delicate ring. This IPA has a slight haze, but not cloudy at all.  Upon taking a big whiff, I detected a strong piney/spicy presence, as well as a bit toasty but not like a porter. There's a ""perfumey"" presence here too.  This tastes about like it smells. Theres a strong, bitter hop presence. I love hops more than a heavy malt presence, so I'm enjoying this quite a bit. I don't feel the oily presence from the hops, as other IPAs have. This feels very carbonated, but doesn't overpower or hide the taste at all.  There's no question that I'll try Stone IPA again. It reminds me of Rogue's Yellow Snow Ale, which I highly recommend as well.  TheSarge",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cproioi,4.18,A: Poured a straw yellow almost a copper color with a white head that left very thick lacing.  S: Very refreshing hops smell.  T: very crisp very nice IPA with a very nice hops taste with a slight balance of Malts. Very complex flavor that only improved as it got warmer.  M: Not too light not too heavy but a very nice inbetween.  D: I found it to be very drinkable. It left me wanting to have another so I can further pick apart the flavors of this well done IPA. I would suggest this beer to my friends.  P.S. Had to go and buy a bottle of this beer for further investigation. I'm glad I did I'm drinking it now at a slightly warmer temperature and with the pour it creates a beautiful white dense head that leaves great lacing. With it warmer the taste of pepper really stands out to me right now. The hops have a grassier/ pinecone like smell to them. Gives my mouth a nice little burn. Wow this is a good IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RJLarse,4.41,"I picked up a six-pack of Stone India Pale Ale while vacationing in Nevada. We dont get many Stone brews in the northwest so I grabbed some when I saw it. I poured this beer in to a pint glass.  Pours a beautiful gold color and is crystal clear. A rich, foamy white head forms, which is extremely resilient and sticky. The head produces heavy lacing on the glass. This is a very classic appearance. The empty glass dripping with lace is also a classic image.  The smell is fairly strong, floral and fruity. Aroma of citrus fruit is present, and also a whiff of biscuits.  The taste is robust, but not strong or overpowering and wonderfully well balanced between the citrus flavors and hops. The malt is very difficult to detect, but the bitter hops produce a bit of an evergreen, pine, fir or juniper flavor. The bitterness is very pleasant and not puckering or overpowering at all.  Mouth feel is very smooth. The beer is full-bodied but light, crisp and mildly carbonated.  This is a very VERY drinkable beer, with appealing aromas and flavors. The flavors are very well balanced. I wouldnt mind having several of these in a session. I would certainly drink Stone IPA again, and I wish I had bought more than one six pack.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CAMRAhardliner,4.38,"I love the Stone Gargolye motif. The beer flows from the cool bomber a dark gold color, lighter than expected. The pure white head is creamy and everlasting with spectacular lace trails. The aroma is on the sweet side with lots of floral hops, some pine (but not much) and a perfumey maltiness. not strong or very bitter at all.  The taste is a showcase of the sweeter, more floral side of hops. First theres a wash of lavender and rose water flavors, the middle reveals biscuits and caramel. Subtle bitterness reaches its peak in the deliciously balanced finish. The aftertaste is dry and herbal. The hop profile is low on citrus and pine (especially compared to Ruination). The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is smooth and understated. The alcohol is totally hidden.  This is a great IPA. Instead of the immensely bitter and piney flavors of other IPAs, it has a subtle, flowery hop profile. This is unique to me, and impossibly drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigdeuce,4.6,"This is absolutely the best IPA I've ever had!! Lot's of grapefruit flavor and multi-hops. Very well balanced as well, as it is very malty up front, followed by a tremendous bitter hop freshness. Awesomely smooth and drinkability is outstanding. Very highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Metalmonk,4.47,"Pours rusty-orange with a thick super-soapy head. The head dissipated to half quickly, but retained atop the body for several more minutes before totally thinning out. Very mellow carbonation. Stringy bits of sticky lace.  Great smell...orange and pear juice aromas come softly to the nose, with some grassy tones overlaid. Only a mild bit of hops far back. An earthy, super-fresh, sweet and inviting aroma.  Flavor-wise, there's a certainly a piney hoppiness going on, even a bit astringent, but you also get remarkable sweetness from balancing malts. It's nice to taste a hop-centric beer that doesn't sacrifice malt for the novelty of extreme bitterness. Well-balanced and incredibly drinkable. Plenty of depth. Nice job.  There's a most welcome creaminess in the mouth: slick and buttery...and then a bit of sting on the tongue after the swallow. Feels really good.  HAIL STONE! This is great stuff, and one of the best IPAs on the market.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,phisig137,3.84,"Pours a light golden color, with a quickly fading head. In stone's own words, it looks like ""fizzy yellow beer"". Does have some nice lacing though.  Smells of citrus and grassy hops. Also smells slightly sweet and sticky. Quite enjoyable.  Flavor is very round. Solid hop bitterness, but with a heavy malt backbone. Fairly light on the flavor hops, but some does shine through. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Drinkability is average for the style I feel.

147,88,RootedFool,4.32,"Pours with a curdled-white head, dense, over a full inch in height, and a hazy straw-gold body. The nose opens with a slightly vinous pinch that immediately deepens into fully blown hops (straight-up grapefruit rinds and cut grass) held down by a thin but sturdy ballast of cracker-like yeasts and caramel-dense malts. Taste: Razor sharp zip of hop bitterness -- as if anything less was expected -- blasts off from the tip of my palate and arches back, with finesse, all the way to my molars. The middle reveals more complexity as the malts nudge through, caramel in character, same as in the nose. Thins out for the finish, leaving only a high-pitched echo of hops spinning around the center of the roof of my mouth like one of those obnoxious rotating fire-crackers that throws sparks everywhere and terrifies the elderly relaxed and immobile in lawn chairs on the fourth of July. The mouthfeel is perfect: not viscous, not watery, it holds everything up but washes down without over-staying its welcome.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheManiacalOne,4.57,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: The beer is a light and mildly hazy amber color with a thick white head, which doesn’t fade too quickly and a thick lace.  S: Nice hops smell, but not too strong, with a little bit of citrus.  T: Good hops bite to start out, then gives way to an orange/grapefruit sweetness. Then the hops come back to stay in the after-taste with a slight hint of the alcohol. Although the flavors are distinct, no single one overpowers you. An excellently balanced taste.  M: Very crisp and very smooth (Stone Brewing Co. tends to put both of those qualities into their beer very well.) with a medium body and light carbonation.  D: This beer has all of the qualities that it needs to make it drinkable. It’s very tasty, smooth, not-filling, well-balanced and goes down VERY easy.  This is the 4th beer that I’ve had from Stone Brewing Co. and each beer that I try expands the respect that I have for them.

First off this is not what I would expect of the Stone beers I've had in the past previous Stone beverages have been ""extreme"" in flavor whether its the ruination,smoked porter or arrogant bastard.This appears to be a great session beer but hits you like a 10lb hammer when you aren't looking. My second game of Golden Tee was pint two and my handicao dropped about twenty strokes. On tap this pours a clear orange with a minimal head. I only had three of these on tap and I am happy that someone else was driving.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Phatz,4.32,"Pours a somewhat cloudy golden orange color. It had a fantastically thick, tight, creamy heady that had excellent retention. lasted nearly the entire duration of the beer and very heavy lacing.  Smell: The smell made me think immediately of grapefruit and apricots. As I reached further more and more flavors came through. The hops have a very pleasant floral presence but do not burry the sweet malt coming through as peaches or the like.  Taste: The hops here are aggressive but *not* extreme. They are all part of the flavor and used here with cause. There is nothing cloying here just nicely balanced hop and malt attributes making a very pleasant taste. The taste is like the smell; very fruity with suggestions of floral hops, a bit of pine, more grapefruit and sweet toasted caramel along with white grape juice and in the aftertaste a hint of granny smith apples before the grapefruit takes over again. The aftertaste leaves a strong hop flavor (nonetheless sweet as well) on the tongue that kept me taking the next sip quickly, it was so dry. WOW! I didn't realize this beer was almost 7% ABV till the bottom of the bomber and I can't remember how to spell. Obviously the alcohol was completely hidden in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth mouth feel that is medium in weight, smooth through the center and crisp on the ends. Very nice.  Drinkability: As I am *not* a hop-head, I do not find beers this aggressive to be sessionable for me personally. That said, this bomber went down very easily and I will definitely drink 22ozs of this again. Even though I really enjoyed one I wouldn't drink it all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mwc115,4.87,"I used to like crappy beers, or actually maybe I didn't even like them really... I just drank them. Until a friend got me trying some REAL beers and turned me onto Stone Brew. I've had their AB which is a treat, but recently decided to put Stone IPA on tap at my house because it's drinkability is better. This is a truely great beer. My most favorite part is the smell. After my first few glasses I can anticipate sniffing the hops and then getting a good taste of them afterward. If you want (with a tap anyway) you can make a nice head on the beer making quite attractive with a rich yellow/orange color. Has a nice smooth mouth feel as it slides down with a delicious hoppy flavor. Malt and alcohol are present but the hops mutes them. Definately has a bitter ending, which I've grown to like. It fades after half a glass, but can be quite aweful if you had anything sweet as it has a hint of grapefruit at the end. This is probably one of the first beers I take nice long draws from because it actually is that enjoyable. As a word of advice, I see this beer being hated by the average macrobrew beer drinker.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,loren01,3.9,"A: Pours a golden slightly cloudy color with frothy white head and lots of lacing down the glass. S: Smell is a very complex malty scent up front. Smell is very fresh and clean. T: More bitterness than I was anticipating it to have. You can taste the alcohol definatly. M: Medium bodied mouthfeel D: Pretty good IPA, loved the smell on this one. I prefer an IPA that is slightly less bitter than this one however",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PeatReek,3.17,"Very pale body, mostly yellow/amber with a hint of orange, and cloudy. Head is chunky and fizzy, looks to be dissolving pretty quickly down to 1/4"". Aroma: Hops! Piney and spicy, very very grassy. First time a beer's aroma has ever actually reminded me of a freshly mowed lawn. A little bit of paprika, and salt? That's the kind of spicy I mean. Taste mostly the same. Moderately thin body somewhat overwhelmed by the hop flavor and bitterness, with a significant fusel-""hot"" component. I'm a huge fan of Bell's Two Hearted so I thought I'd be all for a nice pale IPA, but... I'd have to pass on multiple pints of Stone IPA.  What is everyone else seeing here?? I'll have to give this another try at some point.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kpantz,4.01,"Executive Summary: Not as bold an offering as I would have expected given my experience with Stone, but then again, this isn't Ruination, nor should it be. A VERY quaffable IPA. I will definitely be going back to the well.  12 oz. bottle purchased in NJ (hooray!)  Appearance: Beautiful golden, slightly hazy appearance, with a light head that reduces to a nice film. Lacing is decent.  Smell: There's a bit of citrus hiding in the back, but this is an overwhelmingly piney aroma.  Taste: Not as bold up front as I would have imagined. The flavors are very subtle and seem to dial up as you complete your sip. No malt presence to speak of, but the hop flavors are nice. Again, piny with a splash of citrus. Bitterness aplenty on the way back. Alcohol is not noticeable. A very well-balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel: Light and nicely carbonated. Very appropriately matched with the taste here.  Drinkability: Very high marks for this one. No hesitation in reaching for several of these. Alcohol presence is well-hidden, mouthfeel is light, and the flavors aren't overpowering. This will be great on a hot summer night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,EStreet20,4.18,"Stone in NJ, finally!!!  12 ounce bottle poured into a Stone IPA specialty glass.  A - Pours a translucent golden color with a nice thick white head. leaves chunky lace on the glass.  S - Nice hops smell with a bit of caramelly smelling malt behind it. A little bit of an alcohol tinge on the nose as well.  T - Bitter and hoppy at first. A soft tea like malty sweetness. Finishes with barely any aftertaste leaving some bitterness on the tongue.  M - Smooth and slick medium to light body.  D - A nice drinking, easy to quaff IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DaggerEyes,4.8,"Poured out of a lovely 12 oz painted brown bottle into a pint glass.  Stone's IPA poured a sticky amber with golden accents. A small head rose up after a slightly hard poor but dissapated rather quickly leaving a thin ""soapy"" film coating the top of the beer and some faint lace stuck to the walls of the glass.  The nose on this is aggresively hoppy with hints almost a piney aroma to it, and faint citrus scents way in the back  The taste is extremly bold and refreshingly unique for a pale ale... Spicey on the front of the tongue with a powerful ammount of carbonation this beer finishes very crisp and clean.  Extremely exciting mouthfeel. Medium bodied with heavy carbonation in the front and a smooth exit.  A total pleasure to drink and a unique pale ale, that doesn't break the mold per se but sure does stretch one's personal definition of what the tastes of a pale ale are.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thepitch,4.21,"I have always been skeptical about the Stone beers, but the Stone IPA is starting to turn me into a convert.  Poured the beer into a pint glass, it had almost no head and the off-white head that did form was gone in less than 30 seconds. The color is a light, golden brown.  I love the smell of this beer. It is just oozes thick, rich, hoppy, DANK, aroma. One of the better smelling beers I've encountered (keep in mind California IPA's are historically my ideal beer).  The overall flavor is excellent. It is bitter, spicy, hoppy, dank, full-bodied with an aftertaste that lingers in a good way. No alcohol flavor, which is surprising considering how strong this stuff is. I would have ranked it higher, but I did notice a slight mildew flavor in the finish, which may be the brew, or perhaps a slightly off batch. Pleasant, spicy mouthfeel and good drinkability.  Solid Effort.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jwff,4.1,"Courtesy of the Flying Saucer in Houston, this beer is very dark for an IPA, but don't let that turn you off. If anything this beer gave me jungle fever (slinkin). Also has a nice head that lasts through most of the duration.  Smell is hops and HOPS. I like it, and while I'm talkin about hops lemme talk about the taste. HOPS. Hops are accompanied by a slight to moderate sweetness. Bitter ending, but good bitter. Mouthfeel is just right, nothing offensive.  Drinkability is good, but I had to quit when I did because LSU was out of basketball to play after beating Texas A&M. Don't know how many of these I could take because as I kept drinking I noticed I wanted to be drinking water more than beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Blakaeris,4.42,Pours golden to almost a peach color. Head is huge thick and leaves plenty of lacing.  Smell is fruity and citrusy with piney grapefruit.  Taste is big but balanced. citrus hops are the star while the maltiness is strong enough to add decent complexity. Fruit flavors are interesting and stronger than in the typical IPA.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied.  This is a great IPA. I really enjoy the fruitiness. I enjoy the complete hop monster IPA's but this is more complex and interesting.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JerzDevl2000,3.97,"Picked this up in New England on my way back from the EBF. I had the Arrogant Bastard on tap up there, and heard good things about this. I thought it was quite good, but just a tad overrated. Seeing the other Calfornia beers that I've had in the past, this had a tall order to measure up to, and nearly pulled it off.  Not the best of pours - the goldenrod color was lighter than I thought it would be and even though the head was great, it didn't make up for the less than stellar lacing. Obviously, there's a lot of hops here, but it's a bit too piney and soapy in the back. The front is quite enjoyable, as the maltiness plays off of the citrus and floral notes well, but it gets ovetaken too rapidly once I stopped fizzing it in my mouth and gave it a swallow. This wasn't bad by any means, but I wish it had a bit more subtleness and depth to it. Maybe I'm not used to the overloading and whallop of flavors, or then again, it just might be a taste and style I haven't fullly acquired yet.  This is a solid brew that got much better as it warmed up and as I went further and further down my glass. I say that about most beers I enjoy, but this one had that quality about it magnified by quite a bit. The ABV is felt here, and the carbonation is a bit lacking, but overall, this was fun to try out and I wish that Stone's other beers were available locally. I would welcome the chance to acclimate myself to their other offerings...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bashiba,4.18,"Poured a very clean orange/amber coor with a creamy off white head that had great lacing.  Smell was of course dominated by fresh green hop aromas, lots of juniper and floral smells with a touch of citrus.  Taste has a nice bit of the hop flavor with alot of pine and lemon with a very solid malt backbone keeping this very balanced.  Mouthfeel is medium thick with a bit of oilyness.  Drinkability is very good on this IPA, it would be a regular in my fridge if were available in my area.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mbunje,4.16,"Poured into a glass from a bomber. dark gold at the top fading to a golden color toward the bottom. Aggressive pour yielded about 2"" of sustained head. Lots of lacing as I drank it down. Smell is not as hoppy as the bottle claims. Flavor is, in my opinion, the perfect IPA. Hoppy flavor without an extreme bitter aftertaste. Leaves you wanting the next sip right away...nice and dry. Mouthfeel is hoppy oil and very smoot. Could drink 3 or 4 of these, but then i'd be....well I'd better get started. Another great job by Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beersabound,4.57,This is a great IPA. The aroma is in full and assertive; primarily citrus and floral. This is what I expect from an American IPA. The flavor is good and bitter with a little sweetness but definitely tilted to the hops. The mouthfeel is round and full with a medium body. This beer finishes clean but bitter and leaves me wanting more. Any hop head will happy with this one!!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tattooedtolley,4.3,"Appearance: A very orangish gold color with a white head. I made the mistake of allowing someone else to pour my first one and I missed out on the thick lasting head that my second one had.  Aroma: Hops and citrus. Not an overwhelming smell, but nice.  Taste: I find myself thinking of this IPA quite often when tasting other IPA's, thats probably not a good thing when it comes to reviewing but to me this IPA had a nice balance of the bitterness of the hops and a nice malty sweetness. The sweetness is subtle enough not to take your attention away from the awesome hops. Some grassy and piney hints.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp, I tend to like that in an IPA.  Drinkability: I was certinaly glad I had two bombers. A week later I bought a six pack and enjoyed them all.  I enjoy this offering from Stone. This was the first brew from Stone I ever had and I was sold after it on their brews. This IPA seems a bit over the top hoppy at first but after taking a couple slow sips the complex taste is exciting. I will never hesitate to purchase this IPA again, one of my current favorite IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mjc410,3.79,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter for my first-ever taste.  A: Light pour yields a bright amber-orange body with little head. The ale is very hazy.  S: Floral, citrusy hops, with a slight nuttiness. Caressess the the nostrils, but is very mild.  T: Mouth coating bitterness, but again, very mild. Nutty flavor is increased, along with great hop flavor. I actually expected more hop power though.  M: Good, tingling carbonation. Slightly thicker than it appears.  D: This competes with Hop Devil for my new favorite IPA. I thought it would have more potency than it does, but I'm actually glad that it doesn't. This makes it highly quaffable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,skillerified,4.25,"Yellow and orange hues emit from the glass as if it were almost glowing. A decent head of about one finger adorns the top of the glass. The head is bubbly and slightly off-white. Very clear and fairly pale (as it should be).  The bouquet is pine and citrus, a dash of pepper, and I even got some pineapple. Very fresh smelling with a touch of that nice fresh cut grass smell. I'm also getting a slightly malty smell that's reminiscent of sugar cookies. A touch of apple and some other fruit that's almost sour smelling (but not in a bad way).  Taste is warm and malty in the beginning. A little alcohol spice in the middle. Ends with an IPA's characteristic hoppy bitter bite. Overall, quite delicious, but doesn't quite live up to the smell and appearance.  Light to medium bodied with a rich smoothness that borders on creamy. Starts a little sweet, but fades to a nice bitter end.  A solid IPA. Hits on the IPA style's high points, but with a refreshing mode of operation. Certainly could have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jamesdergen,3.99,"Appearance: Pours a golden honey with a dense, pillowy off-white head that sticks around throughout.  Smell: Piney, somewhat floral hop aroma. Not much going on here.  Taste: A dense wall of hoppy goodness backed by a respectable nutty malt backbone. Not as overly hoppy as Ruination and much more balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: The alcohol is well-hidden but the heavier mouthfeel detracts slightly. No worries, though, I'm sipping this one mostly.  Not bad. I guess my standards are a bit high on this style as I can get Masala Mama on tap pretty much whenever I want, but this is a solid brew from Stone. Well-balanced but still awesomely hoppy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rustymoore,4.13,I love Stone's stuff more and more everytime I drink it. Pours a reddish amber in color with a thick creamy head. Smells of strong hops and citrus with a hint of pine. Taste is bitter and has a fairly strong alcohol flavor. Very crisp and refreshing though. Mouthfeel is very carbonated but more balanced than most IPAs. Very drinkable if like a good IPA as well as being moderately affordable.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DogFood11,4.37,How the hell did I not review this brew by now? Guess it was so good I didn't think of writing anything. Crispy light drinking but in the end it becomes dry. Flowery hop profile. A bit thin in the mouth for most of the pull. Highly filtered. waves of carbonation fill the glass.  Notes: One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Milder than the big freakshows,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,etaggie09,3.98,"Appearance: orangey gold, with an off white head that has great staying power. Wonderful Clarity. Where are the carbonation bubbles?  Aroma: Classically hoppy. Like a citrus earth perfume. There is malt in the background to give this beer just a nice thick aroma. Very wonderful.  Taste: Whoo, boy. This one is all about the hops. Interestingly enough though the malt comes through at the end. I've never had a beer that went from bitter to sweet. Very interesting. Its got a grassy hop flavor with a nice bitterness and an earthy malty finish. Scares you at first with the bitterness, but suprisingly, it isn't overpowering. Fairly well balanced actually. Hop forward most definately, but that is what the American IPA is all about. Man these guys at Stone sure do a great job. Some toastiness is evident as this beer warms. Gets a little sweeter too, which helps.  Mouthfeel: A Medium body with a crisp carbonation bite. Although, I would rather see less carbonation in this one.  Drinkability: I wish I had more than this bomber.  Notes: I have come to love IPAs and I must say that this is definately one of the better ones I've had. I like an IPA that has more sweetness to balance the hop bitterness, which is why I love Dogfish Head's 90 minute, but this one does a great job for the style. The appearance of both of the Stone beers I have had were superb, and their flavor is excellent. Definately one of the best breweries in America.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Optimat0r,4.43,"so far, this is the best IPA ive ever had. just a great all round beer. heavy on the hops, but not as...raw, as its arrogant bastard cousin, much smoother. pours a light, pure gold color...taste-bright, citrusy hops take the lead, and not much else is prominent, yet somehow it seems really balanced; it starts off really good and stays interesting throughout. as usual though with hoppy beers after a while i get all hopped out and dont want anymore. excellent mouthfeel;the aftertaste is hoppy but not as bitter as others in its class. im no hophead, but i will definitely pick up this one again on occasion should i feel the need for a hoppy beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,pjwilson,4.27,"folks we have a winner.  appearance: i'd to give higher marks here, i really would. However the beer just looks ""thin"". about like water. the head doesn't last to long in big form, but settles into a solid cenimeter that never leaves. the color is light orange....but again it's very, very clear. no trace of chill haze, a change of pace from anderson valley's cloudy beers.  smell: ah there it is. some nice creamy hops. there's not much malt besides base malt is this sucker...you can tell that by the color. This leaves us with the pure hop. werd over the campfire, these the hops are Ahtanum, an offshot of casade, like cascade but a little different. I like that. That last 5 ipa's i've had have had some sort of malt character, and I've complained in a big(great devide) to a small(green flash, ok the malt actually works in that one) way. My wish for a maltless IPA has been granted here.  taste: hops and nothing but the hops. like bitting into a hop. yet, there is a certain, refined holding back here, despite the label. The hops provide 100 percent of the flavor here, and yet they didn't go overboard. On the spectrum of malty ipas with 1 being super malty and 10 being hoppy this is a easy 10. And yet, I guess I grew to like some malt in my IPA's. However this is a kick ass ipa, this is why I love craft beer, the diviserity. oh yeah the actual flavor? more fruity that piney, tons of grapefruit. the heaviness of the hop flavor actually completely overwhelms the bitterness. This could be an older sample,(but it's still tastalicious. man this beer has the greatest aftertaste. (again, reviewed in style for a non-malty ipa. imho they are two different stlyes, malty and non-malty)  mouthfeel: well it's watery. funny thing is I can taste hop oil. no really. like the hops added some body. since this beer is a hop deliverly system, it works  drinkability: yeah, drink up. yes it's drinkable. the body is light, but within reason. when you set your glass down, you start thinking about another sip. remember those bitter beer face comercials? this was the beer. ok i'm bored half way threw the second beer, better to spread the sixer out, rather than try to drink a sixer in an eve.  My favorite stone beer i've had. wait, i forgot about the Russian imperial stout. anyways, the only ipa that is perhaps better than this, is Racer 5 or mabey the russian river ipa( a draft verus bottle comparison isn't fair). or green flash, or anderson valley. uh yeah all those are good... stone, once tasted never forgotten.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnniemarg,4.35,"Pours a clear golden color with a half inch yellow head. Head falls fairly quickly. Some lacing.  Strong aroma of Piney hops and lightly burnt caramel. Some sweet citrus.  Nice strong hop flavor but a lot more going on with this beer. The caramel flavor and sweetness are very smooth and balance the hops perfectly. The hops really stick to your tongue though and stay with you.  Creamy medium body.  This in my view one of the best IPAs out there. The hops in the aftertaste taste great on the first one, but I think sometimes it can add up to be a bit too much after a couple/few, which is the only (and very minor) downside in the drinkability of this spectacular brew to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Citrus west coast hops with a hint of pine followed by a solid carmel malt aroma. Has a medium body with enough carbonation to move things along. The hops of course are up front and last to the finish. Overall I'm a bit surprised at the balance of this beer. Not overly aggressive but no wimp by any means. It is a Stone afterall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,skizziks,3.04,"12oz bottle poured into a nonic. Thick antique white head starts off around an inch and fades to a bare skim on the surface. The beer is a slightly cloudy gold. Head leaves just a little spotty lacing.  Aroma is predominantly hop, backed by a mixture of fruit, apple, banana, a little fresh baked white bread. It's nice but all pretty faint. I really have to stick my nose in and swirl to get it.  Taste is almost all hop, a little like sucking on a hop cone (and I really don't recommend sucking on hop cones). An astringent bitterness right up front. Again, a little apple and bread under the hops. Just enough malt to let you know that this isn't just a fizzy tincture of hop, but not nearly enough to provide any balance. Finish is dry with more bitterness sticking in the back of the throat. It'll be there for a long time. That's not necessarily a bad thing in my book, but I wish there were more malt to fill things out. The result is that it all comes across as harsh and thin. I think I like what their yeast is doing, it would be nice if it had more to do. There is some sense of the alcoholic strength near the end, but very understated, doesn't seem like a 6.9% ABV.  Mouthfeel is thin, a little watery. It helps drinkability, but is a little unsatisfying. I doubt I'll bother getting another one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Tupperwolf,4.42,"Pours out that nice IPA color - A slight haze that could be from chill, a light amber with an eggshell head. The head fizzes up to a finger thick then relaxes to a nice eggshell scum, leaving behind curvy, intricate, lazy lacing.  Smell - woo, yup, that's my Stone IPA, for sure. The scent is like a fist made out of grapefruits punching you in the face while holding a slice of grapefruit, its squirting juice stinging your eyes and skin. Mmm! There are slight tinges of orange and lemon peel, but it's all citruis, both sweet and bitter.  As this warms, the creaminess, the smooth vanilla-ness of the malts really gets more and more refined and more tasty - it continues, despite the temperature, the be followed by a slap of deep, groovy hops, grapefruity as they smell.  Nice crisp carbonation is followed by a smooth, creamy mouthfeel that leaves behind a relatively crisp aftertaste for an IPA.  Yum yum. This IPA could be other companies' DIPAs. It's such a wonderful definition orf the style, it deserves to be recognized as one of the best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigbubba,4.5,"This beer is a nice bright bronze-orange. It is almost clear. The head is big and bubbly. The smell and taste are both great.

Good lacing  Smell: Fruitiness/biscuitty smells and piney hop odors  Taste: Fruitinesss and citrus and pine hops war for your attention, but in dignified manner. Not as in you face as most stone ales I've had & I appreciated the subtle yet powerful tastes showcased. Dry sweet/piney finish with hints of alcohol as it warms  MF: Extemely well balanced with good carbonation. Smooth and moreish  Extremely quaffable, drinks about 2abv lower than listed.

The copper color has a nice frothy head (yeah, I pour this shit right!). The hop character is full - some floral, some citrus. It packs a nice bitter punch - initially it's all hops but complex maltiness finishes with some sweetness. A loverly beer.  I know ""session"" beers usually refer beers under 5% ABV. I could session this beer all day and all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nlmartin,4.72,Poured from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer pours a very lovely copper coloration. The head was off white slightly honey colored. The head was thick and had good retention. Very nice streaks of lacing remain on the glass.  Smell: This beer is a hop bomb on smell. Spicy floral hops on a bed of malty citric sweetness. Dam this is good stuff.  Taste: The beer punches with intial spicy hops slightly piney notes. Then there is citrus goodness. This breaks into malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: The beer is meduim bodied and has a slightly oily texture to the mouth.  Drinkability: This beer is just an excellent IPA all around. The taste is very well balanced. I am looking forward to more.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma is fresh, floral and citrus hops, a hint of piny hops along with some stronger grapefruity smells present as well. Taste is a very balanced hop and malt infusion, yet allows a nice bitter hop bite at the end, tastes sweeter just before it bitters. This is an absolutely outstanding IPA, I love this brew. Mouthfeel is superb, carbonation is just where it should be, this brew slips off the tongue and leaves you wanting more. Highly drinkable, I could drink these all night long, given the chance.

When I first opened it, the taste was much more fruity and light than I expected given its overwhelming support as a top notch IPA. Definitely sweet and malty for an IPA, lacking in the resiny floral taste of my more favorite IPAs. Light and mellow, very drinkable and accessable. Very creamy mouthfeel, full bodied with a lingering moistening effect on the mouth and tongue. After a few minutes (head gone), the hoppy strength increased and really won me over.  One of the best IPAs I have had, surely a top 5.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Phyl21ca,4,Bottle: Poured a orangey color ale with a medium head with standard retention. The hops and their nice floral aspect overpower aroma. Taste is quite bitter with some lingering sweetness in the back of the palate. Good body and alcohol level does a good job of keeping this beer together. Not my favourite style to begin with but this was very enjoyable nonetheless.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bcant,4.32,"Stones IPA pours a very nice golden/straw color with excellent clarity and the faintest hints of red when shown to the light. It has a nice head, very easy to adjust depending on how it is poured. I poured a 1.25 inch rocky white head.  The aroma is so appetizing. Very strong hop smells: pine and grapefruit. But there are also some sweeter hints of a well balanced malt, I get some delicate strawberry notes.  This is a big complex, and well balanced IPA. The hop profile is long and intense but that does not mean that the malts are overpowered. Indeed there is a very soft, sweet almost buttery under-character to this ale. The finish is very dry and crisp; exceptionally refreshing.  Very soft and smooth in the mouth, almost viscous. The carbonation is not sharp and the alcohol is not biting.  Note: freshness really matters with this brew. When an older bottle is not going to be terrible it is really not the same beer as a fresh one. If you get it at a bar or store with low turnover/infrequent restocking you might not be getting the best Stone IPA available.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JayQue,4.64,"Another great IPA. This one pours a clear, light amber color with minimum carbonation and a 1 inch off-white head that melts down to a long lasting quarter inch. Lacing is very pronounced, like a ladder pattern on the glass. The smell was strong, some hops, but also the type of fruity smell that I usually associate with hefe weizens. No hefe weizen/astringent taste though. Definitely a hops leaning taste, but not an ""in your face"" hops flavor like Hop Hog or Big Foot. The predominant tastes were hops and citrus, not much of the SNPA type pine aroma/taste. Mouthfeel is what I would expect in an IPA. Drinkability is high!! No hint of the ABF, a nice balanced (I call ""leaning towards hops"" balanced!) taste. This is something you could cheerfully swill until it catches up with you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jakester,4.5,"This is from a case I bought at the Beer Mart in Reading, Pa. I drank it in a goblet. Expiry date on the bottle, and bottled date on the case. Great!  Pours a brilliantly clear golden amber with a one finger head of white foam. The head falls to islands and a ring, with great lacing. Carbonation looks low to medium.  Aroma is huge grassy/citrus hops, with smells of hay, grapefruit, and lemon. There is a big, bready pale malt aroma, and something very perfumy in there, also.  Flavor is big grapefruit, lemons, and grass, perfumy as hell, with a strong bready malt character. The malt is very clean and bright, not caramel-y at all. Hop bitterness is high but well balanced with the malt. Aftertaste is citrus and freshly mown grass. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy for its size. Full bodied, with a high level of residual sweetness. Resiny feel on the tongue, mouth puckers from bitterness. Wonderful! Finish is bitter and dries out a little.  One of the best IPA's I've had. Hops are in the spotlight, front and center, but the malt backbone is quite substantial. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bennetj17,4.01,"Suprisingly this poured with little to no foam head, although it appeared there was adequate carbonation going on in the glass. The color was golden, leaning toward copper, with just a faint haziness. The smell was rich. Sugary malt aromas blended with dank resiny hops. Mmmmm. The taste was not as sweet as I expected though, the flavor is mostly domintated by the hoppiness, leaving behind a strong bitterness. The alcohol is readily detectible at times also Mouthfeels is OK, somewhat thin and with decent carbonation. A very drinkable beer for hop lovers, but I was expecting more balance for a Top 100 selection...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Viggo,4,"Pours a clear golden orange, thick white head forms, laces nicely, with good retention. Smell is citrus, pine and floral hops, a little caramel and a little alcohol. Taste is caramel, some wheaty dryness, grains, then a whack of citrus and pine hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation. Has a considerable bitter kick in the finish, I was expecting a bit more from this one for its high rating. Thanks DrJay!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jed,4,"Presentation: Comes a brown, 12 oz bottle with the normal ""painted"" Stone artwork. As always, the label text is quite funny, if not as outlandish as it's big brothers Arrogant Bastard or Ruination. Enjoy by 1/19/06, so only has about two weeks left.  Appearance: Pours a very clear, light brown/orange copper. About one finger's worth of head, which quickly disappears. Tons of cloud-like lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Clean, herbal hop aroma, with surprisingly restrained hints of pine and citrus. Some spicy alcohol lurking in the background, along with bready notes.  Taste: Neutral mouth quickly gives way to a wallop of hoppy bitterness. As the beer warms, some malt sweetness helps to balance the taste, but the main flavor is still enjoyable citrus and pine notes from the hops  almost spicy at times. Finish leaves behind lingering, sticky hops.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with plenty of carbonation up front but nothing overwhelming.  Drinkability: The 6.9% alcohol can sneak up on you, given how addictive this beer is. Probably a bit heavy for a session, but it tastes good enough that you'll be drinking until you see the gargoyle.  My local bar rotated Stone IPA into their taps, so I've been happily drinking this in place of Racer Five for a few months. The bottled version lacks some of the initial bitterness of the draft version, possibly due to the freshness of this sample. While Stone gets more attention, and rightfully so, for bigger offerings like Arrogant Bastard, this more balanced but expertly crafted IPA sometimes gets overlooked. A strong offering worthy of the gargoyle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LPorter33,4.02,"22 oz bomber from Pop 'n' Cork, Mendon MA.  Appearance = Nice looking, clear golden honey colored with bubbles rising up, sweet frothy head that lasted a long time, very pretty lacing.  Smell = Hops explosion as expected..great subtle fruity sweetness there too, almost like pineapple juice.  Taste = Good tasting, delicious hoppy IPA. What I'd expect from Stone. This is up there with Dogfish head's great IPAs; a slamming of citrus hops with a piney aftertaste. Malt is a little lacking in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit weak; i'd have expected more carbonation. This is still an excellent IPA with good drinkability.  Overall = A top notch IPA for hop lovers. It's all about the hops and if that's what you're seeking, you will be greatly rewarded.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Backer2004,4.25,"Tried this out as part of the best flight of beers I've ever experienced at the Flying Saucer in Addison, Texas. Overall, one of the best IPAs that I've tasted. Too hoppy for the rest of my table that night, but just right for the style. Stone continues to do a great job with their brews and this is a perfect example.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,assurbanipaul,4,"Light golden, cloudy like a hefe, clears up after a while. Dry, hoppy aroma with a trace of orange rind reaches out to grab you before the first taste. Nice lacing on the glass.  Flavors sit very high on the palate, bitter, extraordinarily hoppy but not unpleasantly so. Slightly acidic and floral, pungent grassy tones behind the hops. Contains the whole spectrum of hops flavors, from orange to grapefruit to lemon. Aftertaste is mellow and gentile.  Mouthfeel is light but substantial. Drinkability is only limited by your tolerance to hops. An excellent example of a lighter brand of American IPA, the only drawback being it's almost a one-trick pony with the hops. I could session this, but only for a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nickss,4.57,"A nice golden-straw colored pour with a strong 1/2"" head.... judging from the constant stream of bubbles it looks as though this will be a fairly active beer in terms of carbonation. Nice chunky lacing clinging to the sides.  Huge hoppy profile in the nose. Smells of outdoors.... grass... hay.... as well as some lighter fruits... a bit of pineapple perhaps...maybe some granny smith apple.... all in all quite brilliant.  Tremendous citrussy hop presence.... gorgeous fruit flavor in the back-end... what a bouquet of flavour... tremendously complex and well balanced.... beautiful.  Bitter and tight on the tongue....yet the mouthfeel is not so thin... instead, it is a moderately weighted brew, which seems to perfectly fit the flavour. Perhaps a bit less carbonation would be my only suggestion.  Could drink this all day and all night... which says something for an IPA. Of course my palate would be crushed by the morning, but oh well, it is a sacrifice I'm willing to make.  All in all a fabulous beer.... and very fairly priced.... Stone continues to amaze me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Derek,4.05,"A: Golden-bronze, quite clear, with an off-white head. Not much retention, but it leaves a little lace.  S: Citrousy, floral, fresh hop odour over a hint of bready malt.  T: Predominantly hop flavour (west coast citrous & pine). Balanced to the bitter side, but relatively smooth & crisp, with a slightly assertive aftertaste. Bready malt, with some alcohol warmth (more-so as it warms from cellar to room temperature).  M: Moderate body is a little acidic and oily, carbonation is also moderate.  D: It's quite drinkable, especially considering the strength.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OStrungT,4.67,"This beer pours a golden yellow with a white head. The head fades slowly leaving thick laces.  This beer has a crisp grassy floral aroma. I detect a lemon like citrus aroma. It also has a good piney aroma.  This beer has a lemony taste. It is very refreshing. It has a piney, grassy flavor. The flavor of this beer is quite good. I might have to say that this beer might be the best IPA I have ever had.  This beer goes down smooth leaving a piney citrusy aftertaste. It is carbonated very well.  This beer would make a great session beer. It has a great non aggressive flavor, and it is only a little high in alcohol. This beer is very good and definately worth any price to get it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TastyTaste,4.92,"Appearance: Medium to light gold color for an IPA, nice fluffy head slow fading with good lacing.  Smell: Sweet floral hops, careml, piney, citrusy, everything you'd want from an IPA, very good.  Taste: Excellent, lots of bitter citrus, like grapefruit, some carmel sweetness. Finishes a little minty, with lots of lingering bitterness. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated enhances the bitterness, leaves a sticky mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Wonderful brew, a world calss IPA, one of the best I have had in a while.

147,88,connecticutpoet,4.1,"This was a lovely yellow beer with a one finger head that subsided to a thin layer of foam with excellent lacing.  Aroma was mainly citrus, a little pine resin, and a definite solid slug of medium bodied malts with a slight hint of roastiness.  Taste was one big wallop of hop resins... LOTS of alpha acids. There was a pine flavor once it started to die down. Malt was definitely in the background here.  Mouthfeel was DAMN good for an IPA... full bodied, a little astringent, but quite good.  Drinkability... gotta give it great marks. I liked it a LOT.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Naerhu,4.75,"A - Tight off white head and beautiful orange amber transparent body. S - Surprised by the robust malty aroma. Floral and resiney hops are everywhere, but I dont get the citrus everyone else is yabbering about. T - Rustic bread, caramel and gobs of hops. What makes this beer great is that its just as malty as it is hoppy. Zippy, this beer has real verve. M - Medium body mild carbonation. D - This is a perfectly balanced beer, quite unlike (of course) AB, DBA or Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SkeeterHawk,4.09,"Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy reddish orange color with only a 1/4"" head at first pour. The head was barely off white and was made up of small bubbles. It was gone in less than a minute, and wasn't maintained by the few bubbles rising.  Aroma: reeks of hops, and smells so floral and citrusy that you can almost smell the essential oils evaporating as the beer gets just above freezing. There are a few toasty notes from the alcohol, as well as a bit of spice from the alcohol.  Taste: To say that this beer is hoppy would be an understatement. It starts out with an oily hoppy flavor that pretty much stays with you the entire time. The finish is seriously bitter, but it isn't a harsh bitteness...which is a good thing. There is a bit if an assertive bite left after the beer crosses your palate, but in the finish, it is hard to tell if the harshness is from alcohol or from the hops. It does finish a little on the harsh side  Opinion: Well, if I said that this beer was my favorite, and likened it to the holy grail...I would be lying. It is a clean and well made beer, but I like to have at least a little contribution from the hops. Even DFH 90min IPA has a bold malt presence...where this one is just really hoppy. This isn't a bad beer, but I'll be sticking to the Bastard and some of Stones other products for the most part.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Terp96,4.82,"By far my favorite of all time and I finally had a chance to have it on tap at the Flying Saucer, Addison, TX (for $2.50 no less). What's not to like?  The appearance is gold in a pint glass for more reasons than one. A deep golden-orange hue to be exact. Very tight, one finger head with great lacing throughout the glass.  Smell is perfect and everything I happen to look for in and IPA. Piney, flowers, citrus; it's all in there. So much so you can't wait to take a sip.  Tastes perfect as well. The nose really adds to the experience. At first, you think this is going to be a hop bomb with minimal malt character but not so fast. The malty sweetness follows shortly behind and lingers through the bitter-dry but sweet finish. So complex.  Mouthfeel is great for the first two beers you have. Much more and the hops begin to paralyze your tast buds. This isn't even Ruination. I seem to be tasting this for hours after the fact and in a good way.  Drinkability is strong as well but after you have your ability to taste much of anything after a couple of these, you get half of a point deducted. Still, I would keep going on principal and at $2.50 a pint, why not?  I can't readily get this one in MD. However, it is the one beer I genuinely seek out when I travel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,phishgator,4.85,"This pours a bright gold-copper hue with a large foamy head that only dissipates slightly. The aroma that is giving off is a floral citrus, spicy combination that is truly delightful. The taste is hop bite upfront and moves into a smooth buttery sweet malt finish. the mouthfeel is touch down from perfect due to the bitterness left on your tongue; after three of these you will not taste a thing! That lends to the drinkability not being perfect for the same reason. This IPA ranks right up there with the best of them; I would say that if I could actually purchase it on a regular basis (I'm in FL) it might be my favorite brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Oxymoron,4.64,"The taste is hop-tastic. Noticeable hops are well balanced between bittering and flavoring. The bittering provide more of a grapefruit taste and the flavoring is a bit citrus with some pine aftertaste. Nice to note that there isn't an oily aftertaste. The malt is noticeable as well. Especially after your mouth adjusts to the hop taste. A good caramel flavor with a touch of biscuity taste. As the beer warms other fruity taste become noticeable as well. Some lemon and grapefruit. Also a touch of orange as well. Overall a fantastic flavor.  Just to note again there is no oily aftertaste, which is nice. A medium body and well balanced in the hops. Also good representation with the body.  This is much easier to drink then say Ruination. This is a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I sure hope Stone brewing will soon be sold in Michigan!!!!  A brillant, amber golden color. Quite hazy, with a good two inch thick, white fluffy head, that lasts. Lots of sticky lacing! Very strong hoppy smell, with a slight citrusy, fruity aroma. Lots of piney, hoppy bitterness on the tongue. Not as strong the more you drink. Smooth mouthfeel, with a slight oily texture that finishes clean. If you're a hophead I think you could drink this all night!! Very flavorful, yet bitter IPA. I'll have to make some trips to Toledo to pick up more of this great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Franchise,4.47,"This beer pours a golden honey color and leaves a very thick white lace that clings to the side of the glass. The floural hoppiness is ever so present along with the citrus, grapefruit, honey, grassy notes and cloves. This beer starts with a grapefruit hoppy bitterness on the palate then slowly takes you to a smooth sweet honey clove flavored finished with a mild citrus squirt. This beer is well rounded and amazing, by far one of the standards for American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,fromage,4.33,"Really an excellent beer... I've missed it! Great with burgers and fries with some kick!  Pours an amber gold with a giant white head. Lacing and webbing through the glass.  The smell has got some punch... tons of grapefruit, pine, and other citrus. Hard to catch much else.  Very sweet to balance the hops, caramelly and slightly bready.  Medium mouthfeel with sticky aftertaste. The bitterness lingers to cut off the sweetness.  Very drinkable. My first of these was pretty intense (a year ago), but they're really not so bitter (not even the ruination is). Excellent with barbeque and the like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BillyB,4.2,"Poured a nice straw to golden yellow color. Brilliant clarity. Nice frothy white head. Aroma was of citrus and piney hops with a slight pale malt sweetness. Nice bitter sweet balance for an IPA. Tasting first the pale malt sweetness followed by citrusy/zesty, piney hop flavors. You can taste the hops but it is not overly done. Medium carbonation. Smooth drinking. Overall very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

T: Comes in waves...First wave is very fruity but smooth with grapefruit, orange, then a bit of pine and bitterness followed by a fruity finish thats very fresh and smooth.  M: Very good mouthfeel, not too bitter but not too bland. The change in flavors after you gulp it down is amazing.  D: This is a very drinkable beer.

147,88,Celt44,4.47,Appearance is a golden yellow - rather light for an IPA. Poured a small head but kept its lacing throughout. Aroma - Medium floral and citrus scent - typical of most IPAs. Taste is exceptional - strong on the hops and with malt character intact. Hints of citrus - maybe clementines - they're in season now. Mouthfeel is smooth and not overly carbonated. Close to perfect. Overall a superior IPA - Definitely smooth enough to be a session regular. My second favorite after Southern Tier IPA.

147,88,sinistrsam,4.77,"I had had this brew before and loved it to death, but I had never reviewed it. I tried my best this time to give it an objective review. It poured a very clean and clear amber color with a foamy white head, disspapting quickly. It smelled wonderfully, with hops obviously leading the way to some malt and sweet/sour tones. It wasn't overpowering, and gave a perfect insight to the taste. It had an incredible, yes incredible sweet hoppy taste which I could see being a little too much for the non-IPA lovers. The main thing I took away from this was the balance which was exquisite. It was sweet yet somewhat biting and bitter at the end. The alcohol wasn't even noticed. It was refreshing and crisp. I really can't think of a better IPA for your money.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,oggg,4.2,"This orange hued IPA is not for the faint. The piney aroma is mild and doesn't really warn you of the staggering bitterness to come. Strong citrus and pine hit the tongue in a juicy blast of hop flavor; that is, if your tongue has been properly conditioned to tolerate the greater bitterness, which is slightly on the harsh side. Amazingly, they remembered to put in some malt, making this brew a joy to drink for hopheads.  Overall: bitter bitter juicy IPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DarkerTheBetter,4.03,Pours a dull orange copper with a big white head that falls quickly. Smells of mandarin oranges and pine with a slight grainy barley. Not as hoppy as anticipated. The hops present taste like juniper and orange zest. The malt taste like sweet caramel cornbread with an oat meal finish. Mouth feel is thin with a slightly creamy carbonation.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mentor,4.68,"Pours a strong two-finger off-white head over a crystal clear brilliant gold-sunset liquid. Smells pith grapefruit with some pine. Beneath is pickled pineapple and cotton candy sweet. Tastes hop bitter with grassy hop flavor with some grapefruit. As strong as the hops start the taste, the malt rises to dominate and provide a cool ending. An interesting transition. Late flavors are light caramel, canned pineapple, mild pear & apricot, and although I doubt there is any chocolate malt in here, I do find some chocolate flavor.  This is a wonderful beer. An up front struggle morphs into a reasssuring base that leaves me begging for more. Hops return in the aftertaste to dry the throat. The finish is just divine. Md body and moderately carbonated. If I had another I'd drink it right now. Sad to see my my glass holding just one more gulp.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,barknee,4.12,"SIPA pours a medium slightly hazy amber color topped with a 1/8"" frothy head. The carbonation is low, with lazy macroscopic bubbles ascending within the glass. The nose is one of just picked sweet apricot, peach and pineapple; exhibiting a tropical edge. The sweet aromatics give way to tannic well bittered hops and good rear palette bite. The contrast of the fruity nose and the bitter taste is unexpected and exciting upon the first sampling. The natural acids of the beaucoups hops, ignites the tongue with brilliant flavors of fresh pine and apricot. Although somewhat complex, the depth of flavor lacks the anticipated dimension that one might expect in a brew of this magnitude, perhaps limited by the acidity and / or the super-saturation of hops in the brew. This is a critical appraisal, but for this reason I can't award this product neither a 4.5 nor a 5 for its taste, as I would have been compelled to do otherwise. Perhaps the filtering of the natural yeasts contributes to the attenuated dimension here, and do believe that this brew may be a bit too ""squeeky clean"" and has its potential retarded because of this. Nevertheless a great creation! The mouthfeel is brilliant due to the copious acids and finishes dry with a creamy/oily component. This brew simply explodes with flavor, which easily lasts several minutes in the mouth. A well hopped IPA that is sure to please big time!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It has a rigorous carbonation of tiny bubbles.  S- The aroma of freshly crushed green hops with some hints of citrus and pine are very nice.  T- the initial taste is a nice pale malt that is quickly followed by the taste of big juicy hops with some notes of citrus and pine. Those juicy green hops last and last through the finish. They are balanced with a bold hop bitterness that finishes of the taste.  M- medium mouthfeel but with a big fizziness in the finish. No alcohol warmth or astringency.

I hate to agree with this guy - because I think he's a total numbskull - but I do.  22 oz bottle poured into a clean pilsner glass at 52 degrees. Very pleasing light amber color. What the hell is retention? Lacing...I don't really know...I have some homework to do...anyway, the head was nice and clean with large bubbles but, was I drinking it in the right glass? Head stuck to my mustache area in a satisfying way.  Smell is it's best attribute - coriander and hops - very pleasant and rewarding, as smell goes.  Taste is good, but more bitter than I prefer; aftertaste lingers, provoking curiosity and intrigue...many flavors; interesting but still a bit bitter. More tasting produces more yearning, but the result is the same with each additional taste - waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Mouthfeel is nice and thick; coats the palate.

Nose is all floral and fruity hoppiness, very inviting! The taste follows the nose with a powerful bitterness at both the front and the back -- a great achievement in itself. There is a honeyed maltiness and the taste of peaches and flowery esters. The mouthfeel is full and juicy, very satisfying. Great drinkability...too bad this stuff is so expensive as a sixer. A bomber is enough for me, though. And at 6.9%, there's really no reason for more than one 22 oz bottle anyway.

147,88,badturtle,4.03,"This is an interesting beer. It pours a nice dark gold, almost copper. The head is thick and quickly becomes a thin cap. It smells of citrus, orange mainly. Where's the hops? Oh, there it is, in the finish. I expect more hops taste in an IPA. This seemed a little sweet. The hops and malt were more balanced than I expected. Unfortunately, the alcohol is too strong. I'm about a third of the way through and I have a slight buzz. I can taste it over the other tastes. The carbonation is just right. It isn't too heavy. It feels just about right. The taste of the alcohol detracts from the taste and the drinkability. If the ABV was about 1-2% less, the taste would probably be a point higher and the drinkability would be 1.5-2 higher. I can't find date on the bottle, so I have no idea how old it is. It isn't bad, but this wouldn't be my first choice for an IPA.  Edit: As it warms, the taste and drinkability improves. I raised both by .5. I estimate the temperature at the end to be about 68-70 F.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Aroma of spicy, floral hops mixed with a bit of sweet malt. Notes of pine and black pepper. Palate is outstanding - bold, assertive hops grab hold of the tongue and don't let go. The lightly sweet malt acts as a great foil. Body is rich and creamy, nice and substantial with only a subtle trace of the syrupy character that shows up in big IPAs.

147,88,jaluria,3.97,"Pours a pale orange color with big foamy white head. Aromas are of grass, dried fruit, and hops. The tasts is of citrus bitterness and hoppy texture followed by a strong dry finish. Biting on the tongue, but very enjoyable for anyone liking bitter beers. Good drinkability. Overall, this is a good beer, but not my favorite IPA. I think this beers scores highly because of the reputation of the brewer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,theozag,4.25,"Pours and comes to rest a crystal clear gold color with a thick white head that lasts. This is one of those rare beers that seems to beckon as soon as it comes to rest in the glass. The carbonation bristles and fosters a steady head. The color and clarity of the body are practically gem-like. You're not going to find a more inviting IPA.  Aroma is strong and fragant with an almost floral quality. It's very clean and sweet, and the smell is literally mouth-watering.  Start is smooth and slightly tangy without very much flavor. But there is an inviting texture right from the start. Stone IPA settles medium-bodied and from there the bottle basically says it all. Flavors are (or could nearly be) taffey, white grape, wheat, and perhaps more subtle others. In two words this beer is all about ""hop bitters"" just like any quality IPA should be. Finish is melty smooth and clean with an oily and sour aftertaste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,orsulacp,4.57,"This beer had a clear gold color with an orange tint and a creamy white head. I loved this smell, piney and floral, a bit of fruit. The first sip gives a hint of malt then a slow build with the hops, citrus then bitter with clean finish. Not too bitter just right. Medium body with lots of carbonation contributes to the clean finish. This beer is easily in my top ten.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,danielharper,2.98,"Purchased from Woody's Smokes and Brews, Franklin, TN.  I drank this one a while back and took detailed notes, but never got around to inputting the data into BA. Mostly because, well, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to drive the review average down a bit for this beer.  This beer poured a dark yellow-orange hue with a thick white head. The head disappeared quickly, leaving but a tiny bit of ""soap residue"" at the top of the glass. A nice pour for an IPA, pleasant and inviting, but nothing overwhelmingly good.  The nose contains pretty much two things: a nice fruity grapefruit ester, with tons and tons of hops thrown in for good (?) measure. Hops dominated this nose more thoroughly than any other beer I've ever tasted.  Taste is very similar, with the fruit backbone completely overwhelmed by the overall hoppiness of the beer. To me, this beer was completely overdone with hops, with absolutely no attempt made to balance out the tasting experience with anything else. While tasting, I scribbled down a 3.0 for the taste, so that's what I'm giving it, but in my memory it stands a bit lower, more like a 2.0 or 2.5.  I found the mouthfeel here to be medium-bodied with a large dose of carbonation for good measure. About what I'd expect for an IPA, nothing special, nothing terrible.  I originally wrote down a 3.0 for the drinkability here, but I'm downgrading it a bit because I don't actively look forward to trying it again for awhile. I was expecting something really nice from this beer, but I was certainly underwhelmed by this one.  Just to be fair, I love, love, love Arrogant Bastard, find it to be one of the finest substances ever to touch my lips. That beer's just about as hoppy as this one, but it has such an invigorating mouthfeel and up-front splash of fruit that the hops seem balanced in comparison -- the extremes on both end mesh perfectly and create a brew that actually seems to strive to push the boundaries of what a perfectly-crafted beer can be. I'm not a hophead, so their IPA just seems to be, as another review put it, ""liquid hop juice"". Lovers of hop-bombs will love this one; I just happen to not be one of them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,becktone,4.35,"My Father once told me to never try an IPA because I wouldn't like it. He told me that it was very dry and incredibly nasty. After trying this beer I have decided to ignore the fact that my father ever told me such a thing. This beer is good as has turned me on to IPAs in general.  The beer pours to be a golden/amber color. The head of this beer wasn't big enough to create a problem when it comes to drinking the beer, yet it was also big enough to actually call it a head. In my opinion it seems to be just the right. The head retention isn't too bad, it dissapates quite a bit after one starts drinking it. The carbonation is visible in the beer and makes this beer look quite active.  This beer has a great smell. Infact it reminds me of citrus fruits. This IPA also tastes great. Although I smelled some kind of citrus I could taste none in the beer. The beer is dry and has a bitter after taste that just makes me want to keep drinking this beer. Although the beer may be bitter it feels great on the palate, the carbonation which makes this beer look so alive can easily be felt on the palate. It goes down fairly smooth and has a heavier feel on the palate than normal pale ales do.  Overall this beer is fantastic. I could drink this stuff all day. I will definitely be checking out some more IPA's in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Melchizedek,3.88,"Pours a somewhat light orange-gold with a fantastic rocky head that keeps on giving.  Smell is all nice fresh hops, largely citric. The taste is, as boasted, a hop assault, and it does the whole range from grassy to citric to resiny to fruity and sweet-tart sour candy. There's a bit of mineral undercurrent leading to a grainy, rather bitter finish, and the alcohol shows itself as well. Hop bitterness lingers afterwards.  This is good stuff, I definitely don't mean to knock it--but it is kind of one-dimensional. If you need a hop fix (and sometimes I do), this is a good place to go, and it's definitely quality, but I don't think it's really a go-to beer for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ghostwalker,4.77,"Mostly clear gold/amber pour. Very little head, (poured from a 12 oz bottle into an Ommegang chalice).  Nice hop nose that let's you know you are in for a treat. Aggressive, but not unwelcome.  Hop fiesta flavor! Nice grapefruity burst, sharp piney flavor also present. Definitely for hop lovers. I can't remember when I have had a better IPA. Probably never.  Sharp, crisp mouthfeel. It begs you to take another sip.  Drinkability is tops! 7% ABV and it goes down insanely easy. I could drink these almost exclusively with no complaints. Certainly will be one of my new session favorites, when I can afford it ($37 a case, $10 a sixer around here).  My love affair with Stone beer continues, too bad they are located all the way across the country. Luckily most of their line is available here in MA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,12vUnion,4.82,"Mmmmm....probably the best IPA I've ever run across. Everything about it makes me tingle. My girlfriend is laughing at me right now as I make full, sensual love to this beer with every one of my senses. The bottle is gorgeous. Standard brown bottle with a wonderful screen painted label. These men delight in their craft. So do I.  It pops with a little his, letting me know there's a little carbonation waiting for me. That little tease. Sweat drips down the bottle. I can hear it calling for me without it saying a word.  She tips over. She has a full body. Golden like sunflowers with a hint of dark mystery about her. She stands there waiting for me. A beautiful head on top a slick body. She's wearing nothing but a little lace around her stem. Shhh...you're making my girlfriend jealous.  She smells like everything I ever could have wanted. Strong citrus with a little floral scent on the way out. She smells sweet as an orange. I can't take the anticipation any longer. I seize her and bring her close to me. I take a little gasp before diving in.  She's a little bubbly. She tickles me ever so slightly. But over all...she smooth, real smooth. A buxom beauty to the end. She's got a great, full body that I can't get enough of. Sweet, hoppy. Thick and spicy. She's a party till the end. I can't take my lips off her.  We are talking about a beer here. So I don't feel dirty closing this with ""down she goes.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FLAbeergutinMASS,3.77,"Look at my review of Ruination I am reminded of how hoppy these Stone brews can be. I find this IPA to beer even hoppier than the Ruination. I know the character make up is different, but this is borderline absurd. I have been dabbling in East Coast IPA's which tend to have more pop than hop; so at this point I am kinda blown away.in an indifferent way.  APP. Doesnt quite match the wonderful fall New England evening I'm experiencing. No standout colors, looks very much like a straight up pale ale. Keeps its head character throughout consumption.  SMELL. Fruity and sweet. Can you really smell hops? If you are not supposed to, this one you can.  TASTE. HOPS. HOPPY. LOADED WITH HOPS.  M&D I like a hoppy beer, but this one is a bit ridiculous. High marks for what it offers, but I prefer, more defined characteristics in my IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rodrot,4.8,"This has to be the tastiest IPA I've ever had, and the most balanced. Floral hops hit you as soon as you pop the top off the bottle. The taste is resiny, and floral with a solid malt backing. This beer is too easy to drink at nearly 7% abv. I could see myself drinking 3 or 4 of these at one sitting. Definitely recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChrisA,4.62,"Stone IPA is the first brew to make me realize what I was missing. The complexity of flavor throughout really ballance a very strong hop profile. It enhances the hops and brings out all the various flavors. I never realized a beer could taste this way.  A little pricey, but worth every penny. A sure fire bet to be the tipping point for any drinker starting to indulge in micros. I'll still drink Titan IPA more often because I need to support the Colorado brewers. This is a hophead must.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,misterscooter,4.7,"This guy pours beautifully with a fluffy white head of medium build that slides down the side of the glass, leaving little behind. Lovely amber color. The bubbles are there to be seen but not blatant.  When you first smell this guy it is a kick you in the nose punk that tries to bully you away. But when you dare come back, you notice the hops and the citrus in there. Both distinct and both inviting and neither like your typical beer. Very unique and it gets you fired up for that first sip.  I've never tasted hops quite this good. Obvious, blatant and by no means overdone. These are quality hops that taste slightly bitter but more smooth and full of character. There is just enough sweetness to offset the hops and this makes the IPA one of the best I've ever had. I want another. Unreal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gruntlumber,4.6,"I'm reviewing this for my own beer profile more-so than for others to get any new insights as to what I think. I mean, how could I add any more raves to this spectacular beer?  In my book, this de-thrones Bridgeport IPA as one of my all-time favorites. It's a close match, but I have to give the edge to this beer. Stone comes as close as possible to the edge of being too hoppy without crossing that line. If a good IPA should be considered ""balanced"", then this is perfection. From the floral aroma to the citrusy hop bite and bitter finish, this is the best IPA, and the freshest I might add, I've experienced. Fantastic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goschool,4.42,"It's about time I review this IPA, and it's a good thing too since there are only 478 reviews to date. The color is clear copper with a two-finger white head. Aromas are floral and sweet with notes of pines and grapefruit. The taste is hoppy, although this stuff tastes pretty subtle compared to Stone's monstrous line-up, with citrus and sweet malts. Not a huge beer, but a superb everyday treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

The nose has a pretty nice hop note, very slight malt, pretty nice citrus note. The taste is very nice hoppy, very slight malt note, very nice citrusy. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, with a pretty nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty tasty IPA, for the ABV. Glad to have it available to me, now. Recommended.  Pours a clear golden amber color with a nice head, some carbonation, but not much lacing at all. Very hoppy with some sweet, citrusy scents. The taste is sweet and hoppy with a little bite at the end. Light to medium body. This ale is very drinkable. Glad to have found it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Not bad.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bumpon10s,4.3,"Appearance: A nice light tan ale with decent head and very slight lacing.  Smell: My nose is stuffed, but there is no mistaking the hops in this. An IPA to say the least.  Taste: Again, hops, lots of them. If you like hops (I do) this a beer for you. The 6.9% ABV is also obvious, but blends in with the hops very, very well.  Mouthfeel: As soon as it hits the tongue the carbonation explodes again. While some don't like this, I sure do, a coin flip I suppose.  Drinkability: This is one that deserves to be had often, but sometimes price, and most times availibilty here don't allow.  Stone really can't do wrong. I have a special bone in my body for IPA, and this tickles that itch. It's just a good beer, flat out. I wish I could drink this more often, but I don't see it as often as I'd like in the stores.

147,88,kirok1999,4.48,"Without doubt one of my favorite beers ever. Just hoppy enough to give it some bite, balanced by sufficient malt to give it the sweetness it needs to balance the bitterness of the hops. Smooth, creamy, hoppy, piney, citrusy, resinous, all perfectly balanced. Stone doesn't seem to make a bad beer. Not the overwhelming hops of Ruination, not too much malt to make it too sweet. Simply perfect. If you have any friends who insist Bud Light is good beer, given them a glass of this and watch the reaction.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hop2it,3.83,"Perfect pour. Light amber brown with the nicest white head of suds. Smells of sweet piney hops and a touch of mint. Oh my, this looks good.  This is a hoppy IPA without a substantial amount of malt body. The taste is dominated by a medicinal citrus injection. For the hop-fanatic in me this is a wonderland of bubbly bitterness that tickles the tastebuds long after I take a sip. For the IPA-lover in me it is too linear, and its focus on over-the-top hops denies the complexity of a malty base. Definately worth picking up again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bleedingshrimp,4.45,"This brew pours a nice strawberry orange, with a one finger marshmallow head which fades fairly quickly into a ring and island. The smell is citrus apple and a bit of pine. Taste is slightly sweet, big and hoppy as hell. Light ready malts with grapefruit and piney hops. Aftertaste is strong and hearty. Mouthfeel is surprisingly crisp and full. Great session beer and may I just say the burps are exquisite. A classic that'll never die.

147,88,MattBrooks,4.89,"I had tried this brew in a 22 oz. bottle a while back, and recently bought a six pack to try at home. It was a little late at night when I got home from work, went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle-opened it and took a swig. I suddenly thought to myself ""what am I doing?"" I grabbed a pint glass and slowly poured this delicate libation in. I brought the glass to my nose and took in the aromas. ""This must be what Bavaria smells like"", I thought aloud. This beer has a golden hue and a nose of FRESH hops to it. I was once again, amazed by Stone, it smelled so fresh! The mouthfeel is heavy and the taste is quite strong, starting off hoppy and light like most IPA's but finishing with a little bit more bitterness than I was expecting. Which was a good thing. A perfect brew for anytime of year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wedge,4.54,"Clear golden orange in color, a puffy white head receding into a super-sticky lacing. The smell is a wonderful thing: fragrant hops...hops ALL over the place, with a very subtle hint of alcohol and grain. Taste is also quite deliciously hoppy. Piney, herbal, with malt subtleties coming through near the end, a lingering bitterness prevailing. Mouthfeel is big and full with a mild tingly carbonation and dry finish.  This is a BIG IPA on all levels, not particularly overwhelming, just extreme in aroma and taste (which is certainly not a bad thing). This is what an IPA should be. Damn tasty...one should always have a few of these on hand.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GnomeKing,4.33,"Nicely hopped, just as you'd expect from a West Coast IPA. The hops have a kick and are perfectly chosen, tasting good from the first sip through the end of the great aftertaste.

This one kept on tasting like it did on the first sip. A knockout IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

It is very discernable and has loads of ultra smooth hoppiness. Smells of leaves, floral, spice, with some pine and a hint of biscuit. This beer smells like how I'd expect a beer orchard to smell; Delicious. As for flavor, this one has a variety. There is a stronger spicey hop taste then there is in the smell, followed by piney, leafy/floral sensations and then a bitterness thoughout the finish. At the end of the taste it almost turns dry, but instead smooths out. This beer is incredibly smooth, and slighty syrupy. The large hop spectrum smooths together real nice.  I could 'temporarily' substitute this beer for oxygen...one of the best IPAs that I've had. Mmmm.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kreuger,4.45,"Served in a brown longneck bottle that had something to say to my expectant beer mug. No noticable date . . . though at almost 7%abv and hopped into oblivion, I'm not worried.  A - Poured moderately Stone's IPA generated a tall, aggressive head; which eventually settled down to about 2 fingers of slightly off-white rocky foam. I had to wait to and pour a third of the bottle at a time. Beautiful slightly hazy amber/gold, with lacing all the way down the glass.  S - This smells amazing. Sweet malts and hops, almost fruity in aroma. And ooooh the hops.  T - And oooh the hops! This beer has such a big hop kick. The best balance between crazy hops and malt I've yet tasted. the malts pack enough body and sweetness to offset the powerful hop biterness. The balance is probably the best part about the taste, and it keeps me coming back for more.  M - Smooth. Very smooth, with just enough carbonation. This is a full bodied ale. Its solid and strong without being too dry or having too much of an oily hop feel. There is only a slight touch of alcohol in the finish, which is impressive at 6.9% abv.  D - If beer gets better than this I can't afford it. I can and would drink this all the time. Its that good. The only things stopping this from being an awesome session beer are cost (about 8$ a 6 pack) , 6.9% abv, and the heavy nature of the beer itself, it'll fill me up darn fast.

Any malty sweetness is nearly an afterthought.  The taste of this beer is driven by the hops (as is the smell). It's so wonderfully bitter, piney, citrusy, and spicy. After a little bit, Stone IPA becomes a bit more sweet and tart. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light; yet is quite full-bodied. Finishes very crisp, with a pleasant spicy/bitter aftertaste.

147,88,Domingo,4.32,"I was planning on picking up some of this over the weekend but luckily my local burger joint (the Cherry Cricket - for all of you in the Denver area) had bottles of it available. I'll be honest, normally I'm not a huge IPA fan. I'm trying to get more into them, but that final hop bite after swallowing really gets me most of the time. Having tried the ruination before, I was prepared for a major bite at the end, just like it has. This brew on the other hand doesn't have it at ALL. It looks terrific. A bright golden color with just the right amount of head. Interestingly enough, most IPA's tend to be darker...but don't let color fool you on this one! It smells VERY hoppy, but with a maltiness and even a little bit of tropical fruit. There's a hint of alcohol at the end as well. Call me crazy, but there's a cannabis sort of smell, too. Taste is amazingly smooth. It has a hop bitterness, but it's blended with the flavor of the beer, and not just that post-swallow bite. Hops give you a pineapple and even a little citrus bite with the initial taste and the finish. I could definitely drink a few of these in a row. I'd actually recommend this to a lot of people who drink BMC. It still has the familiar ""beer flavor"" that they're used to, but is so much better in every way.

It pours a brilliant copper color with a 3 finger head that leaves a very sticky lace as it recedes.  The nose is just awesome. Caramel, light cotton-candy sweetness, brilliant, chewy lupulin-infested hoppy goodness. I get a lot of grapefruity citrusy sweet hop over a very nice sweet caramel base.  Flavor is incredibly balanced. The caramel sweet malt is there, but not offensively sweet. It is overlayed with a light peppery, moderate pine and citrus hop. Maybe some chinook? The bitter is not big and offensive, but hangs on very well into the finish. Very clean. Very tasty.  The feel is moderate to thick. Carbonation is moderate.  Drinkability is huge. The hops compell me to drink more and more. I like the contrast of the malt and hop on this beer. Might be my #1 session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells of strong flowery hops with a tad of maltiness, I do love that smell. Tastes of strong bitter hops. Smooth mouthfeel. Not a hue hop fan, so I'm not jumping backwards to drink this.  Not much going on here, just another strong IPA. If they are your thing, than this is a good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sinistermadman,4.45,"Poured from the bomber. Pours a nice clear gold color with a burly head that sticks around quite well.  Smell: Hops, mild citrus notes along with a spicy nose and then even more hops.  This brew has a very creamy mouthfeel that is very pleasant. Hop bitterness is dominant and is coupled well with constituent ingredients. Has an almost floral taste in the middle that ends with a yeast laden aftertaste. Very tasty and quite drinkable. This brew could serve as the American IPA paradigm. Cheers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dwvarner77,4.48,"I've had this before, so i know i'm in for a treat. picked it up on a trip to kentucky to visit my buddy kmpitz; i can't find Stone in Illinois.  Pours a beautiful gold-copper color with a monsterous 3- to 4-finger ivory head that falls to a slight maintenance foam. Fingerprints of the head nicely line the inside of my glass. Aroma is pleasant, a woody character with a bit of citrus underneath. Flavor is a strong citrus hop, that build to a nice bitter, then fades smoothly. Dry-hop is evident, but the bitter balances well with the malt. Active carbonation gives the mouthfeel good character, and a bit of the hop bitter hangs on the back of the tongue. A great session beer, i could sit and drink this all night long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ommegangpbr,4.15,"Almost pine juice but in a good way. Juicy hops all around in smell and flavor. Has a sharp bite that mellows out into a smooth mouthfeel. Ranges from good to great all around. Easy to get, relatively inexpensive and excellent for the style. I may be judging this a little harshly in light of my having tried Stone's Ruination recently. It is distinctly possible that my palate has in fact been ruined for many other IPAs, but this little brother of Ruination has nothing to be ashamed of. This will definately satisfy a hops craving and then some.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scooter231,4.15,"Pours a pretty amber color, clear, nothing floating around in there. A nice head that disappates quickly to a thin rim. Smells hoppy. Very hoppy. Some citrus notes. Also decently piney and a bit of a hint of spices floating in the smell.  Tastes... hoppy and bitter, then gives way to a sweeter finish. Big flavor. But everything is well-balanced, nothing takes over and attacks you. Mouthfeel is nice and bubbly. Drinkable for sure. Each sip seems to get better and better.  I think Stone's Ruination IPA is overall a better quality and tastier, but this guy's not shabby at all. A good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,klewis,4.12,"appearance: Thin, amber color, frothy sustaining head, lots of lacing  Smell: Floral hops aromas, and maybe a touch of caramel. Very nice.  Taste: Excellent balance of malt and hops. Most of the hops presence is in the bitterness of the finish, not in flavor. Very interesting and complex flavors overall.  Mouthfeel: Good as expected, but nothing extraordinary  Drinkability: Great beer. I look forward to drinking lots of this in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mmmbeer,3.2,"12 oz. with no freshness date, but I've kept it for a several months to see what would happen. Served chilled in an enlarged flute. Pours an orangey color with a 1 finger tan head that leaves sticky lacing. Aroma consists of citric and piney hops with biscuity malts behind it. The flavor is the same but has an overpowering wet paper character that lets you know it is past its prime. It has a medium body and nice carbonation considering. When it was fresh it had a huge fluffy head and wonderful flavor - I will re-review when I get a fresh one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,joecast,5,"ok, i really should be going to bed right about now. but i cant wait. and what better way to end the day, than with a stone ipa??  pours a hazy yellow, with a slight orange hue. minimal carbonation. the head actually grows as the beer is poured into the glass. finishes off reaching about an inch, and slowly settles to about a centimeter (yes!! standard and metric!!). very stable. nice lacing. lightly tanned in color. somewhat enjoyable to watch as bubbles grow and burst, only to be replaced by more, smaller bubbles.  aroma? well, it hit me before the bottle cap hit the counter top. pine, followed by some pine, and finished off by a bit of pine. seriously there could be other aspects to the aroma, but i dont care. this smell should come standard with all new cars!  bitterness adds some heat to the flavor, backed up by some biscuit maltiness. sort of reminds me of arrogant bastard, but that was a long time ago. a fullness to the hops in bitterness and flavor that is admirable. leaves a lasting impression on the palate.  mouthfeel is full, without being too filling. good lord this is fantastic! . each sip increases the desire to take another sip. wish i had better access to other highly rated ipa's to compare this with. but until then, this will have to be: 5.0 - exceptional",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bobbyc881,4.38,"Adventures of South Carolina Guy at Brickskeller in DC:  I asked for a nice IPA, and this is what I recieved. Nice clear golden color, mild carbonation with a decent white head that hangs around the glass.  The smells lets me know about the hops included inside. Oh boy. Bit of citrus smell to go along....and some spices, although I can't put a finger on them.  Taste is powerful. Big strong hop flavor and bitterness. Very nice. Just enough malt to keep the hops from being overwhelming.  Reminders of the hops hang around for a while. Very drinkable beer, goes down nice for 6.9%. I could easily have another one of these, if there weren't so many others to try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Troyone,4.5,"Pours an apple juice color with a slight copper hue. One inch head that dissipated with lacing that sticks and minimal carb action.  Moderate toasted and nutty caramel malt smell with a moderate to heavy resin and citrus hop aroma.  Moderately sweet, bitter, and almost burnt toasted caramel malt taste with lots of resin, orange, and lime flavors in the hops.  Medium to full bodied, slightly syrupy texture, soft almost flat carbonation, and a smooth slightly metallic and alcoholic finish.  Drinkability is great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Naes,4.7,"This IPA is copper with brown tints. The heads is large, sticky and creamy (white).  The aroma is a mixture of citrus and hops.  The flavor is quite wonderfully bitter. Hidden in the after taste is a bit of fruitiness and something like an orange rind.  I think this one is perfectly carbonated for its style and quite smooth. It leaves a small coat on the palate and is almost chewy in the end.  Could I drink another? You bet I could, but I fear that the ABV will catch up to me a little too quickly.  As far as IPAs go, this is one of the better ones that I have tried. Not too fruity and the bitterness just makes me want more. This beer goes down way too quickly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bierschenker,2.9,"Big thanks to Mzwolinski for bringing this one over. I was really surprised to have a taste of this one. This is totally new to me.  Poured it in a robust Hoegaarden glass. Smells very fruity: raspberry and peaches. Combined with spices and malty caramel. It pours out a blond-amber coloured beer. Not a lot of head, but a good carbonation. A very bitter fruit skin taste with rich hops, unripe citrus is very overpowering and lingers on into the aftertaste. This is a full bodied beer, but totally not my taste.  Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mushroomcloud,4.46,"6-17-2005 Stone IPA is one of the flagships for American IPA's in my humble opinion. The beer pours out a beautiful gold color with the tiniest bit of orange tint. A 1"" creamy white head rests on top. The head recoils to about 1/8"" and leaves great lacing on the glass. This is how a beer should look!! The nose is a masterpiece. Pine, spruce, citrus, orange peel, something candied in there. Very appealing. The taste is wonderful with a bright hop explosion midway through the mouth. The citrus notes from the aroma carry over into the taste. The beer rolls over the tongue into a bitter, long hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and creamy and not highly carbonated. Stone IPA is wonderfully drinkable. It is ""The Nectar"". The English soldiers in India would have been ecstatic to pull this IPA off the boat!!  2020 - 1 month old and outstanding.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Vancer,4.35,"Hoo baby, the *light* Stone IPA. Whatta treat. Start to finish, excellent. Pour was a clear, amber orange with a frothy head, laced all the way! Then a citrus and floral bouquet graced my nose, followed by; lemon, citrus, foral tasty treat. Very tangy , charged and carbed with nice hop burps. Hmm, thought I didnt like the forals, but Ive changed. Wanting another and another.  One personal caevet: well, 3F Alpha King is very comparable, and I can get that one locally without the kick in the sack shipping charges.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,clvand0,4.45,"Pours a light amber color, very clear, with a small head that falls quickly and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is all about the hops - US West Coast hops - citrus, slight pine, and slight spice. Reminds me of the DFH 90 min, in that the nose says big hops and the flavor is much more smooth and mild than expected. Some of the hop flavors come through after swallowing, but there is a solid caramel character and some bitterness. The body is moderate, but still full and interesting. Drinkability is great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cracgor,4.64,"Appearance: Clear amber with red hews. The head pours off white. A modest size head forms of large bubbles. There is also a modest amount of carbonation rising through the glass. The head retention is ok...forms a somewhat thick collar that sticks to the glass just enough to remind you its there.  Smell: Sweet, oily smelling hops. A fruity grape and pine needle smell. Smells great.  Taste: Fairly bitter, but not way over the top like I expected from the bottle description. It is well balanced with the sweet malts, playing with the palate quite well. The hops leave a great taste in your throat. Aside from that there is again the fruity flavors which reminds me of grapes and something I can't place. Sweet and well balanced.  Mouthfeel: medium to full body. Slightly astringent, but not much. Dry and crisp a good feel.  Drinkability: not so overly hopped that it is undrinkable. This is very tasty and refreshing as long as you like bitter. MMM...can't wait till its sold in my state.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,maek228,4.2,"Appearance: A light shade of amber. Nice 3/4 finger head with decent cling.  Smell: Piney hops. Huge hop aroma. Complex.  Taste: Thick malts immediately give way to piney hops, hop oils....dude it is a monstrous dose of hops that leaves a wickedly bitter after taste that coats your mouth.  Mouhtfeel: Creamy yet scrisp. Medium to light bodied.  Drinkability: For IPA lover such as myself....this one could be sessioned",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,axisjones,4.5,"I had the honor of being poured a glass at the Stone Brewery straight off the bottling line.  Pours a yellowish gold with a stately head that holds the whole way. A sight to behold.  The smell is hopporific. A nice mix of pine and herbs coated on a citrus base. There is a hint of malt in the nose as well.  This is an IPA all right. Damn is it ever! While no where near the intensity of Ruination, this is more hoppy and bitter than your standard IPA fare. For a west coast IPA, Stone departs from the bunch while still maintaining the character and quality control of the region. This is not as outright piney and juicy, but has alot of hop flavor and a lingering bitterness. The pine is there as well. While this beer is more hoppy than most IPAs, it is remarkably balanced with solid malt complement, giving it a biscuity finish.  For my money, one of the better IPAs around. Great for singles, great for sessions. This is a great example of how to make a beer with more character, but perfect balance. Cheers to Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CRJMellor,4.57,"Fresh bottle from CMaruschak. Thank Chris  Pours a golden color with just a hint of cherry red. Big white head leaves spots of lace all over the pint glass. Aroma of pine, citrus and resin and some caramel. Flavors of citrus, big caramel kick and pine resins. Some bread notes really round the falvor profile out. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky and just below full-bodied. Excellent transitions between some malt and the incredibly bitter but tasty hop hits. Clean, powerful and very smooth. Pure beer. Drinkability is absolutely top notch. The standard to which all other American IPA's should be compared.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Sycodrummer,4.29,"Had from the bottle at Sunset Cantina in Boston, Ma. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass yielding a small barely there white head atop a dull yellow haze colored beer. No lacing throughout the sample.  Smell was very hoppy and fruitty. Strong citrus frangrances of orange, grapefruit, and tangerine.  Taste was very hoppy and with a crisp, strong (but not over-powering) bitterness to every sip. Some citrus to the taste; but not any one fruit overpowering the other flavors. Similair in taste to Smuttynose Finest Kind IPA but without the grapefruit. My main reason for not being crazy about Smutty IPA was the grapefruit and this Stone IPA delivers all of what the Smutty did without the grapefruit which makes it rank pretty high in my book.  Light on the palate with ample carbonation.  Drinkable for sure but not overly so. I could have more than one in a sitting but would not be apt to push this beer too much. Very enjoyable and as such enjoyed in respectable moderation. All in all, a very good beer and one I'll go to again soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,blitz134,4.35,"A nice yellow orange clear pour with a barely off white one finger head which stuck to the glass well. Smell is of wonderful hops...citrusy with tons of grapefruit and tangerine, somewhat like one of those fruit blend orange juices. This smells truly awesome, very sweet. Aroma doesn't tend to indicate too much of the flavor, maybe just a bit. Taste is nice and bitter with a good mix of hops which cover most of the typical flavors. Starts out sweet and citrusy, but not in the usual west coast cascade overload kinda way and then goes into a bit of clean straw and a bit of a resin bitter finish that seems to linger for a while. Nicely done. Mouthfeel is nice and full and slightly oily, just how I like it. Drinkability is excellent due to the nice hop blend and overall downright awesome flavor.  A must try. I like how this breaks the mold a bit of the overly cascade laden west coast ipas and goes for a similar sweet, citrus mix w/o relying too heavily on the grapefruit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MuddyFeet,3.85,"Was kind of surprised just now when I noticed I have never reviewed this beer. Pours a pretty pale copper. Perfectly clear. Lots of foamy head and substantial lace. Nose has more than just the hops that I was expecting, there's a nice malt base there too. Taste is a little piney, but very well balanced with the malts so the hops don't knock you over. The malts actually provide a pretty full body flavor to the beer. Not a dry finish at all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GeoffFromSJ,4.3,"A really great example of the style.  A gold, pilsner-like color. A lot of hops on the nose. I didn't discern any Cascades, which is a nice change of pace for a West Coast brewery.  I got a lot of hops flavors, including pears. At least, something that reminded me of pears. A lot of hops flavors dance around. Citrus, pine(?), etc.  Had with a nice hard cheese akin to an aged cheddar. Went perfectly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jacobier10,4.37,"On-tap @ Redbones in Somerville, MA.  This was the beer that accompanied my ribs on my first - and long awaited - trip to Redbones, and I couldn't have asked for anything more. Golden color with a soft one-finger head. Huge floral hop aroma. Very spicy with some cirtusy overtones. Great strong taste, but not so strong that it was overpowering. Great mouthfeel that could have very easily left your mouth very dry, but didn't. With such a high ABV, it brings the drinkability down a bit. This was a fantastic IPA that I would definitely buy again in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jpwild240,4.57,"A small bottle sits with slight condensation appearing around the bottom of the bottle. I crack it open with my copyrighted ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" bottle opener. The strong hiss makes me wonder if I shook it up too much on the 8-foot trip from fridge to computer. I pour it into a traditional American Bell Pint glass. Beautiful amber color with minimal white head seems inviting. The hop aroma is nearly overpowering! This reviewer has never experienced an essence of such strong hopping before. I'm almost a little intimidated. Almost. Regardless, I dive right in expecting something decent from Stone. Wow! Boom-pop in your mouth! Low carbonation but the wet hopped ale hits your mouth smooth but lingers long enough to encourage you to wait a tick before then next sip. Every sip hits your nostrils as the heavily-hopped brew is agitated. I should mention the malt, because it is done healthily in this case. It balances out the outrageous hopping without becoming too 'pleasing' to the palate. Beautiful white lacing appears around the glass with each sip. (Should one expect less from Stone?) Overall, the best IPA I've ever had. Forget my allegiance to the Stone brewing company... this is a solid, GREAT IPA. If you're in the mood for a hoppy IPA and haven't tried this yet, buy yourself a couple!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JackStraw22,4.41,"Appearance: Clear light golden/orange. Wonderfully big, white head, just huge. Great retention, and good lacing.  Smell: Citrussy and piney hops are the two dominant aromas at first. A little bit of malt, but mostly big fresh hop aroma. It really smells like a bag of oily, fresh hops.  Taste: Full hop assualt. Bitter, but not astringently so. The malt must be in there somewhere, but this tastes like liquid hops. I likes me some hops, so that's good. What sweetness there is seems to show itself after the initial hop taste and linger some. Usually I get the sweetness first, odd.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,garymuchow,4.35,"Bottle from my best youngest brother. Many thanks.  Aroma is a nice and pleasing. Flowery, sweet, fruity, complex and all are agreeable. Dark gold, clear. Head has a creamy look and an average settling time. Some lacing. Flavor, like aroma, is nicely complex. Hops present start to finish with bitterness in the middle. Most of the aroma characteristics present in flavor too. Nice malty fruitiness and sweetness up front. Wonderful softness despite the the bite of the hop bitterness. Smooth. Fluffy feel. Very nice example of style. Well done. The dryness and bitterness isn't always pleasant on the finish, but other than that...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Sammy,3.8,"A bit dry aftertaste a surprise but otherwise a nice drink. Can be session starter or go with food. Pine and citrus grapefruit. Prominent bitterness.  This is a new IPA, sporting a gargoyle emblem. A transparent bottle that really shows big bubbles in there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beermanbrian,4.45,"Pours a clear yellow/bronze color. Fair amount of white head that leaves nice lacing for the entire glass. The smell is all floral hops. Just what you would expect from an ipa but nothing too complex. The taste is where things start to get really good. Again nothing too complex, just wonderful hops bitterness but it's not overpowering at all. Very nice balance of sweetness to control the bitterness. Very smooth finish for such a hoppy beer. This one gets added to my list of favorites. Because of the nice balance you could drink a lot of these in one sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SupaCelt,4.3,Appearance: Clarity. A wonderoulsy liquid orange matter with pudgy bubbles that lollygag their way toward impact at the surface. An appetizing dollop of head perched atop said matter. Lace giraffes and dragons and parachutes are etched on the sides of my guzzler.  Smell: Luscious malty sweetness and hop perfume. Smells like a sweet slice of paradise. Fresh and crisp. Snappy as all get out. Biting fruity stingers.  Taste: This one makes me want to sing. Excellent base of sweetness with just the right bitterness descending towards the finish line. Wonderfully vivid in all aspects. Citrus florals for the palate. Great hops presence with a nice solid sweet backbone. Did I already say that? A great balance of powerful accessories. Pure and moitzi.  Mouthfeel: Great texture here. A sugary thickness makes this amazingly clear beauty feel so right.  Drinkability: I am so thankful I had the opps to snatch this in Indiana. I so wish we had this stuff in the Mitten. Delicious brew. I wish I were able to to put its drinkability to the test as well!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,edchicma,4.35,"Wow, I'm surprised I hadn't tried this brew yet. This is right there with Hop Devil and Hop Walllop. Pours a light amber yeloow with a great initail head and some of the best lacing I've seen. Smell is extremely inviting floral hops...highly rated because it absolutely makes you want to drink it! Taste is eqaully impressive. Definite strong hop presence that last throughout, BUT has an underlying smoothness that makes the experience very enjoyable. The hops linger on the back palate with a pleasant lightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a medium quality and drinkability is very good considering the strong hop presence...a must for hopheads!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,corporatejim,4.35,"IPAs are one of my favorite styles and I am really looking forward to sampling this one based on my experience with their Arrogant and Double Bastard styles. We can't get Stone in Minnesota yet, so many thanks to Fantome for gringing this back for me from his recent beer trip to Michigan and Ohio.  Pours a nice translucent golden color. Quarter inch head that quickly dissipated. Very nice hoppy aroma. Leaves a lingering thin lacing on the inside of the glass. Awesome hop bite upfront and finishes with a nice malty undertone. Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,canucklehead,4.07,"Dark gold with a big head this beer has one of the better big hop noses out there. The taste is very refined for the style , with the hops allowing for the malt to provide the midbody. The finish is not as bitter as I would have expected.

147,88,TongoRad,4.59,"Pours a hazy amber/gold with a modest yet persistent head.  Aroma- first of all, I can smell this beer at arm's length. Strong spicy/citrusy hops in spades, but also a ton of sweet caramel and hints of tropical fruit. Very fresh, very nice.  This is a hoppy beer for sure, but it is also remarkably well balanced. Essentially the flavors carry through on the aroma- but there is the addition of a rich, malty mouthfeel supporting a good amount of bitterness. Everything works well together and nothing about this beer is out of place.  Pour me another!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Litterbean,4.32,"Pours a great looking orange, with a one finger head and visible carbonation. Slightly cloudy, but still vibrant.  Candy-like smell. Sweet, sugary, and very hoppy. Its as if this brew was malted and hopped to the extreme, and it shows in the aroma.  Taste like sweet plums. I envision a nice box of raisins as well as I drink this. There is also some bready notes deep down, giving a hidden malt component behind the apparent maltiness. Hints of confectioners sugar pull through with a tart, biting, citric hop splash at the end. Probably my favorite hop-bomb of all.  Good mouthfeel, carbonation tickles a bit but adds to the flavor. A bit gunky on the intake, due to the amazing amount of hops put into this brew.  Drinkable, to be sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pikemark,4.47,"Bought a single at St. Mark's Market.  First thing I noticed was the tart grapefruit smell coming off, never smelled anything like it, esp. from an IPA, I knew this one was going to be special. The smell was almost phenolic. The head was very thick and chunky and the lacing was pretty good. It was a clear blonde color.  The taste was huge. Good on many different levels. The alcohol was well covered and the balance was nice. Hops were apparent but not overpowering. The mouthfeel was great,very smooth going down. Crisp finish. Only problem was the aftertaste stuck with me all night.  Shouldve def bought a sixpack, Probably my favorite IPA right now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gimmehead,4.12,"Pours a golden orange with a frothy white head, streaming bubbles and a very nice lace pattern. Smells of floral and citric hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, toasted malts underneath, and an earthy banana yeasty quality. Initial citric hop blast on the tongue, piney, good malt balance. Bitterness is not overwhelming, but does leave a lingering aftertaste. Slightly oily, moderate cabonation. Goes down pretty easily, but keep a palate cleanser handy if making this a session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Vol.  Appearance clear orange/yellow body with carbonation that drops instantly; massive and rather sturdy, billowy white head that comes forth in a big pour; fabulous lace  Smell  bitter and more bitter; big fat hops; a bit spicy; and a light dose of alcohol; this is what I want from an IPA  Taste  models the nose with more malts (caramel, bread crust) coming through midway but the citrus hops still run the show; pink grapefruit and grain aftertaste  Mouthfeel  moderate body for an IPA; smooth base and a crisp edge; very light hop sting balanced with a light oily sensation  Drinkability  damn thats a boatload of hops; theres easy turnover; the hop stick smacks hard but if you're the hophead, it'll spin you back around easily so youre ready to roll again  High Hop Tide Warning! Be the bitter! Get ready for a hop kick. This ones good from 50 yards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChrisBowers,4.4,"Probably my favorite IPA. Not for the faint of heart, this beer has some serious hops. All balanced with a nice maltiness and caramel characteristic. Pours a golden amber. Aroma his very hoppy, kinda oily in a good way. Very floral. Tons of hops present in the taste, all very well balanced. Very drinkable beer. Excellent after a bunch of sweet beers to cleanse the pallete.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerFink,4.92,"Decanting this bomber reveals a pale golden colored brew with a thriving frothy white head. Some patchy lacing is left as this ale is greedily consumed. Aroma is nice and strong. Probably the best nose to any IPA I've ever experienced. The prerequisite hops are present to a large degree - citrous and pine notes are tantalizing, dancing with an herbal quality. What sets this aroma apart is a sweet, estery, floral aroma - quite wonderful really. There is also some caramel and pale malt smell present. Do they sell air fresheners like this?? The taste does not disappoint that which the smell put forth. The lovely product of dry hopping is immediately evident. Lots of clean citrous, grapefruit, and some pine nip at the tongue. Assertive hops? Yes sir. However there is a wonderful balance by smooth malt and sweet caramel. True to the IPA style, the malt holds back and allows the beautiful hop character to shine. A little spice and herbal notes dance around as well. Although the malts take the back seat, they never leave entirely. The flavor is exceptional in the fact that it is all about the overall flavor - not just a kick-in-the-nuts blast of hops. The hops are diverse, and the malt character is expertly contrived. Finish is a great blend of dryly bitter hop oils and the faintest of sweet malt. A little alcohol warmth in the finish drives this brew home. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little thin. Overall, this IPA is so good, its probably sinful. Who cares - not me. I'll have another (and another).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nicechalice,3.85,"I love this beer, I always get it because I am lucky enough to have a Vons a block away that carries it in sixers for 7 something.

I can drink a lot of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bruachan,4.23,"nice brew. i felt the hops were not so completely balanced out by the malts. not to say that i didn't taste the fine caramel sweetness, but i could have used some more  fine piney bitterness (though it didn't linger) and a beautiful brew. i don't often hand out 5s but there was something striking about a bomber of this stuff poured into a nice huge mug. brillirantly translucent golden amber with a fine head",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Copper color with auburn in the middle and an almost golden color around the sides. Huge fluffy white head. Tons of lacing. I love it! Aroma hits me upon opening the cap. Lots of floral hops, almost like walking through a garden. I get a slight pine sensation in the aroma as well. The body in this beer is rather thick for an IPA and holds the flavors of the hops very well. The hop flavor is very floral and that is the showcase here but a nice little hop bitterness comes through in a citric way. Juicy orange and grapefruit bitterness provide an excellent compliment to the floral flavors. Malt also is detectable. It seems rather bready, almost biscuity, with a honeyish sweet compliment. Finish is medium and lingers with a pure hop flavor but is not really too intense. Very drinkable beer here and it seems like there is no way this beer is 6.9% abv. Another excellent Stone offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,froggyfrog,4.64,"This is my first time venturing into the Stone brew experience.  Picked up a 12 oz. bottle and decanted into my standard pint glass.  Appearance: Cloudy yellow/orange. Lookin' good.  Smell: Amazing. I can almost taste that hoppy goodness.  Taste: Wow, that's good. Not what I was expecting. This beer has a great hop character without being as harsh as most IPA's I've tried. This brew comes in all smooth malt and quickly gives over to a wonderful piney middle and a kick-ass centralized bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, nice carbonation.  Drinkability: Why the hell did I only buy one bottle of this. I'll be right back.  Conclusion: Less typing, more Stone IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LiquidBreadMan,4.07,"Stone IPA pours a cloudy copper/gold, with very little head. Beautiful. It's aroma is one of the most pleasing in my experience --reminiscent of lush grapefruit and spiced strawberries. Thank goodness the flavor isn't nearly as sweet as the smell. This one starts out with a sharp hoppy bite -- then it mellows with notes of peach and pineapple, with mandarin undertones -- and it finishes dry and hoppy. This is an excellent IPA with many pleasant surprises.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Chadbrew,4.4,"Cool looking gargoyle. Not much of a head on this but a beautiful golden color. Super smell, really sweet... honey? Floral but not overwhelming hops. Taste is hoppy, malty, and citrus. Good balance and not as sweet as it smells. Mouthfeel is medium with good bitterness. Finishes crisp and dry. Drinkability is excellent! Really nice balance and drinks like a much lower abv. Wish I could get this one locally.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Pegasus,4,"Appearance: Clear medium golden color with a profuse and lingering head, lots of broken lace, and fine streams of carbonation.  Aroma: Lots of mild floral hops noted, a considerable presence that is, dominant, but not overpowering. The hops dominate the aroma, but beneath them there is a strong note of sweet, honey-like light malt.  Taste: Opens with slightly sweet malts with notes of honey, this carries through much of the taste, the finish is dominated by a strong grapefruit hop presence.  Mouth feel: Quite full, almost syrupy, smooth and very full.  Drinkability/notes: A superb example of a style that is not a favorite of mine, as I prefer an emphasis upon malt rather than hops. But excellent, nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Kookiekwan,3.26,"This beer pours a hazy orange has a 1/2 finger head with decent retention and thick webs of lacing. The aroma was of grassy hops and not much else. The taste was spicy, bitter, roasted malt and it finished leaving a grassy hop taste. This beer was medium bodied and easy to drink.  Reflection: This is a pretty good beer but not what I was expecting from Stone. The hops never took over the beer it was very well balanced. Again great beer but not a great IPA in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DrJay,4.65,"Appearance: Clear medium amber colour topped by a white lacing of head from the pour. Excellent retention. Foam seemed happy to stick to the sides of the glass all the way to the finish.  Smell: Light malty sweet aroma with some biscuit and a little doughy. Lots of hops happening, with orange citrus, grapefruit, spice and some herbal/perfumy character.  Taste: Hops. Orange and grapefruit citrus, slightly resinous, assertive bitterness all the way through. Malt is present (biscuity and caramel sweetness), but takes a back seat. Piney at the finish. Brilliant.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation with some crispness to start, but becomes very smooth part way through. Some alcohol warming at the finish.  Drinkability: This stuff is great. Lots of flavour, nice balance (I guess you could say it's on the hoppy side), and exceptional finish. This is what I've always imagined an American IPA should be.  22 oz. brown bomber with no apparent best before date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,karst,4.83,"1st of 6 half liter Stones. Rare for these parts. Thanks OstrungT.  A rich amber pour with nitrous like fine fomy persistant head and lace. Aroma Pine - taking it outdoors to admire its beauty its aroma seemed more predominatly that of pears. Alcoholic aroma noticable. Other aromas similar to its taste. Strong beading of ""silent bubbles"" -those microscopic enough to move through a capilary as easily as a red blood cell.  Taste starting clean and crisp with sweetness offset by easily roused CO2 in middle ending in warming sweet caramel and perfect hops.  AFTERTASTE! I can only describe as a happy bee returning to is hive and doing an excited ""waggle dance"" on my tongue shedding hop resin and oils as it completes its figure 8s.  Reaching the end of this bottle is like loosing an old friend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rowew,4.42,"Growler filled at the brewery. Despite a day in the growler it still poured with a great head, and nice retention. Left a nice lace down the glass. Aroma and taste are predominately hops, but there is enough malt to make this a nicely balanced beer. Amazingly smooth for a 6.9 % ABV beer. If you are a hop-head, this should be a staple .. otherwise avoid it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,foXXtail,3.73,"This beer looks terrific. Fluffy dollops of white with excellent retention sit majestically on top of a hazy golden amber liquid. The head is so thick and clingy that the lacing it leaves form circles where the beer sat between pulls. The nose has heavy hits of spice and bubblegum with plum backing up.  This isnt quite as hoppy as I would have expected, and I was a bit disappointed by that. The hit at the front is mild and spicy. The taste ramps up though out the trip through the mouth, and lingers strongly in the aftertaste. There is a slight grassiness most prevalent in the aftertaste. Despite lacking mouth-punching hops: it is a very well balanced brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RedwoodGeorge,2.74,"The brew pours a pale straw-yellow color with only a minimal head. Very quickly the foam dies down to a small ring leaving no real lacing to speak of.  The smell was interesting, plenty of IPA notes of hops with a predominance of floral and grassy notes.  The taste was quite disappointing for a Stone brew. While there was a balance of malt and hops, the hops notes were anything but attractive. Instead of a bold, active hops note there was some light, lavendar floral taste. Not at all what I'd expect from an American IPA. I usually praise beers that are balanced and this one certainly has a good bready malt body to balance the hops but there's really no hops to balance.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, it's a medium bodied brew with enough carbonation to clean the palate between sips. There are no oily or astringent aftertaste to detract from the experience.  As for drinkability, I think it speaks volumes that I regret having bought a six pack of this before trying one. I'm about halfway through and my opinion hasn't changed - this just isn't an interesting IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beersarang,4.15,"Pours a golden just short of copper with a slightly off white head that leaves sexy, sticky lacing down the glass. The bubbles are big, and the head stays at 2mm forever. Bubbles cascade up through the beer, and it has a deceptive clarity.  Aroma, HOPS! and more Hops. After smelling a second and third time I detect some hops too.  Tasting time reveals: malts for about 1/2 a second then comes the piney, citrucy and oily hops that leave a resin on my tongue. Finish is of a mild alcohol warmth that is attacking my brain as I type. Leaves a lingering hop taste.  Mouthfeel, just thick enough for an IPA, and it is quite creamy. Way more drinkable than it should be. Thanks again Stone! You are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.  Note: As good as this is, I prefer ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mynie,4.35,"There are hoppy IPAs and APAs everywhere nowadays. Even AB has introduced a Michelob PA, and every craft brewery worth its salt (and plenty that aren't), feature a hoppy pale ale.  Why, after all these years, do so many people still regard Stone as the very best? I don't know. Not completely, at least. I wasn't there when this was fresh and unique. I've tasted far too many copycats before this one. My palette&#8217;s already been raped by Celebration Ale, Alpha King, and half of Rogue's lineup. I don't approach this beer with the same kind of reverence or fear that many do.  But I still love it.  Pours like a pretty PA. Nice head, dark orange.  Smells hoppy. Floral hops against a toffee malt backbone. Excellent.  Tastes very much like it smells. Big hops up front. Not the strongest you'll ever drink, but good. Floral and fruity--a huge, complex variation. But what really works for this beer, and what most of its imitators are lacking, is the perfect backbone of sweet malt that leaves a wonderful, rich taste your mouth.  Great mouthfeel, too. Thick but not slimy. And I could see myself drinking far too much of this beer, if I had easier access to it. Goes down as smooth as silk.  Wonderful. A classic in every sense.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JLShepard,2.94,"Aroma: Slightly spicy, slightly sweet, but with no hop to it.  Appearance: Pours a translucent orange-yellow with a 1/4"" head that quickly fades, leaving excellent lacing.  Taste: A slightly sweet start fades into a grassy hop taste that doesn't stick around long.  Mouthfeel: Thin, without being watery, with a nice crispness to it.  Overall, a decent IPA. There is some hop in the taste, though it's not as strong as I like and disappears too quickly. I was also disappointed by the lack of any hop in the nose. The mouthfeel isn't bad, though I think it could be a bit less thin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,charlatan,3.78,"Came in a 22 oz bottle. Decent head retention around the rim for this type of beer. Pleasant amber colour. Leaves rather impressive lacing.  Sweet citrus smell, but also yeasty on the nose.  Certainly doesn't taste as citrusy as the smell indicated. This has real body. Isn't particularly sweet either. Instead a very full, hoppiness ensues, with sufficient malt to make the beer feel heavy on the stomach. I have the feeling I am drinking some thing very substantial here. As the description on the bottle implies this is not for lovers of subtle, floral hopped IPA's. I like it, but 22 ounces is more than sufficient. There will be no more beer for me tonight.  I am left with a befuddling gingery taste in my mouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dgallina,4.38,"Pours a clear amber and orange with a significant and slightly chunky off-white head. The head slowly dissolves, but leaves a very persistent thick foam and a good bit of white lace. Smells of fresh piney and rosiny hops with slightly fruity edge. The aroma from my sample was slightly subdued, perhaps due to age. Excellent complex flavor profile. Begins with spicy hops, develops into a chewy and malty middle, and finishes with a swift kick of drying hop bitterness. As it warms, the beer also highlights a tantalizing creamy orange sherbet quality. Medium-strong carbonation, nicely creamy, and very easy drinking.  A fabulous strong IPA. Heavily hopped but well-balanced. Probably the best IPA I've had to-date. Too bad Stone isn't distributed in Georgia. At least Tennessee isn't too far for the occasional road trip...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bceaglejoe,4.2,"Purchased a 12oz bottle at Sunset Grill & Tap, Allston, Mass., on 4 February 2005. Poured into a 16oz pint glass.  Presentation: This poured an amber color with strong orange hues. The head was about an inch or so thick, and it kept pretty well in the glass. The beer definitely had a floral aroma suggesting hops. It reminded me of another Stone product, but this was somewhat more muted.  Tasting: This is one of the best-balanced IPAs I've ever had. The hop bitterness hits the front of the tongue along with citrus flavors. But this beer also goes down very smoothly across the back of the tongue. It had a sweetness to it that made the beer highly drinkable, and the mouthfeel is rather pleasant. Hop flavors don't overwhelm the palate.  This may or may not be a ""session beer"" due to the higher alcohol content. But it goes very well by itself or with some appetizers at the bar. I definitely would recommend this beer to anyone interested in IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,allengarvin,4.2,"Appearance is a bright, fairly hazy orange, with a snow-white head.  The nose is full of hop aroma, resinous and spicy. Fruity too, and some malt lightly detectable under a mountain of hop scent.  Flavor: Quite bitter, naturally, with a lot of hop flavor (grapefruit citrus, pine resin). Malt is present, a touch of caramel and a little grainy, and if you really look hard under that forcible hop dryness, some pleasant sweetness, which comes out more in a the long and lingering finish.  Mouthfeel: Moderate, in fact lighter than one expects. Good slightly-creamy texture.  Very yummy IPA. Unique, too.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GClarkage,4.51,"02/03/05- Purchased at Beverages and More in San Mateo, CA  Presentation- 22oz bomber poured into my Duvel glass. No expiration date listed.  Appearance- Beautiful lightly clouded golden orange color. Thick nitted bubbles which formed a nice 3/4 inch head. Above average lacing with a small ufo circle in the middle. Can't ask for much more than that.  Smell- A pretty subdued scent. You can tell there is pine and grapefruit from the hops and a bit of candied sweetness. Had to really stick my nose in though. It doesn't just jump right out at you.  Taste- Like the scent it is a subdued hoppy beer. But as you drink more of it and let it warm the true flavors come out. Not an overpowering IPA, but just about right if you want a great mix of hops and malt. One of the best balanced IPA's I have had. Good amounts of grapefruit and other citrus flavors floating around.  Mouthfeel- Perfect medium IPA-type carbonation. Super easy consumption.  Drinkability- Very...in one word. I can now see why this is tons of peoples choice for their favorite session beer. It's right in the middle of the hop range. Not super in your face (which can be good) and not on the watery thin side (which is almost always bad). If there was just a tad bit more hops (maybe another 10-15 IBU's) I would live off this beer. But, even the way it is brings great pleasure to my taste buds. Great brew as I expected from Stone. Haven't been dissapointed yet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,frazbri,4.05,"Slightly hazy deep golden body topped with and impressive white head. Citrus and pine aromas. Bread and grapefruit with a honeylike sweetness melded with solid bitterness. Full body with enough carbonation to lift the bitterness to the roof of my mouth.  Stone IPA is the modest little brother of Arrogant Bastard. It doesn't get the attention of its sibling. If it came from another brewery, this beer would be more garner more attention. As it is, it's a damn fine beer that just needs a little love.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Goldorak,4.6,"Translucent strawberry blonde, with a white cloud of of head that quickly gave way to clingly ring of lace, but with only a swirl the head came right back to life, giving away that incredible hoppy aroma. Pine trees, citrus, grassy, this thing has the whole nine yards. The first sip goes down dry and lip-smackingly bitter, but somehow the malt fights it's way through and holds on to the back of your palate after the first coat of hops saturates your tastebuds into submission. Maybe my sample was getting a little old (6-8 months I'd say), but I kinda tasted a little vanilla in the aftertaste, something I didn't notice when I had the first 2-3 from my 6 pack. Alcohol also makes it's presence known after about the half pint mark. For some people balance in a Beer is important, and I sort of fall into that catergory, but sometimes in life you find balance in inequality, order in chaos, yada-yada-yada. This Beer is the gold standard of American IPAs, and my personal favorite from Stone, regardless of the Bastards and the Ruinations and whatever. This one I could drink every day, I've enjoyed it this summer in the balmy heat of Florida and last night in the great Canadian winter. I'm a very seasonal drinker and rare are the brews that I crave year-round, but this one is on the list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CBFanWish,4.4,"When I drink any Stone beer, I have to put on Pantera (RIP Dimebag) as loud as I possibly could. For every beer that they make, Pantera has the perect song to go with it. For the IPA, it's F#*&ing Hostile. Why? because this beer really is hostile. A hoppy masterpiece. When you want a smooth, well-balanced beer, it would be in your best intrest to keep the hell away from this one. If you are looking for an over the top aggressive hop monster, you've looked in the right place. I love it. Pours a hazy orange colour with a thick white head. The aroma is grassy and very strong. The taste is as bitter as could be and is just full of grassy and citric tastes. I want more. Turn up the music!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,whartontallboy,4.38,"Pours an orange with an orange-tinted finger of head. The smell is straight-up hops, lots of floral hoppiness; you can already almost taste the hop bitterness with your first sniff. On further review, some fruity esters come through. The taste is about what you'd expect from a beer touting its hoppiness on the label: lotsa hops. Grassy hops are there all over your mouth; it's like having a hop bottle rocket explode on your tongue. Creamy mouthfeel with some hoppy oiliness in there for good measure; surprisingly smooth drinking for such an unbalanced brew. Finish is an extremely pleasant bread flavor that leaves me wanting another drink  Overall: Not my favorite IPA, and not one that my tongue could handle drinking every night, but a damn fine beer that I'll enjoy whenever I can get my hands on it. For those of us who like our hops, you can't beat it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kaszeta,4.32,"Bought as part of a mixed six pack at Papago Brewing in Scottsdale, AZ.  Pours with a dark amber body, and a thin tan head that lingers. Very floral, almost menthol-y hops aroma, but still nicely balanced. Taste is definitely an IPA, with a very strong hops flavor up front, but unlike most IPAs this definitely has enough extra flavors (bit of malt, bit of yeast, bit of caramel) to really round it out. Nice body, very refreshing. Very dry, crisp finish. Very drinkable, probably one of the best IPAs I've had. Between this and Arrogant Bastard, I think I'll have to get some more Stone brews when the opportunity presents itself.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,swamiswamu,4.75,"Two words: big and citrus. This one isn't the most complex IPA out there, but it should be held as the benchmark. Big citrusy flavor cascade down the tongue with a malt balance. A dollop of lacing floats on the beer and the sides. I took my dog for a walk around the block and when I got back the pleasant aftertaste was still there, like a tattoo. Is it the best IPA? Probably not. Really fucking good? Yes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cypressbob,4.44,"660ml bomber  Pours with a thick amber body, syrupy in consistancy, nice tan head with good retention  Woah, the aroma off this is fantastic, piney, dry hoppy nose. Some hint of alcohol, all very well balanced  Taste, straight away you get the strong bittering hops although its reasonably tame and balanced with a thick syrupy malty body. Yeasty dry finish  A fantastic beer, really amazing aroma and well balanced body....just have to get myself a bottle of ruination next",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,moocey,4.66,"22oz bomber  As soon as I hear the initial hiss from the bottlecap I'm enjoying more pleasant hop aroma than I thought could ever be possible. Wow. If I could give this beer a 6 for aroma, I would. It pours a pale, golden color - not as pale as a macro by any means or as filtered though. The taste of this beer matches the aroma with overwhelming citrusy, piney hop flavors. Stone must have thrown an absurd amount of northwest hops in this brew. There's an unusual amount of sweetness, but for an IPA, that's still not much sweetness. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 in taste is the bitterness. I wish this beer could be more bitter, but that's just because I'm an over-the-edge hophead. Perfectly drinkable as a session brew, but watch out!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brentk56,4.23,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy honey color with a huge head that sticks around forever and leaves lacing all over the glass  Smell: Smells like a bag of cascade hops; grapefruit, piney and resinous  Taste: Taste is overwhelmed by the piney, bitter hop flavors but there is a surprising amount of malt sweetness that lingers throughout; quite a bit of alcoholic flavor as well  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, almost syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation  Drinkability: Astoundingly drinkable!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,neonbrown82,4.6,"This beer was my second ever dabble into IPA, so when I first reviewed it, I didn't quite know what to expect, but I knew I loved it. It is not too bitter, but just bitter enough to satisfy my palate.  This beer is so beautiful I could just not even drink it and still be satisfied with the appearance, head retention, and aroma on their own. The pour is a clear light golden color, actually somewhat light for an IPA. The head is absolutely perfect, producing several impossibly small white fragrant bubbles that stay at about a half inch.  It has a sort of citrusy grapefruit hops character in the smell. The aroma is all about the hops.  Taste is very similar, though the malt is able to shine it's way through. Nice sweet malt up front with a touch of caramel. Lots of hops to balance it out. A good mix between bittering hops and late-addition aroma hops. Very piney and citrusy, but not overly bitter. A good introductory IPA.  Quite light in body with a crisp carbonation. Quite lovely. Very easy to drink quantity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,palma,4.92,"This is by far the best IPA I've ever had. Completely amazing. Read on to experience my experience... However, I highly recommend you get your own bottle so that you can appreciate one of the best beers in the world for yourself.  Light orange amber body with a thick and rich creamy looking head. Nose is all hops and very enticing along with a sweet citrus aroma. Taste complements the nose perfectly. The hop flavor is the best I ever tasted. Big piney oily hop taste along with a sweet grapefruit flavor. Very light malt taste hiding in the background. Ends with a smooth bitterness and a very subtle bready/biscuit aftertaste that makes you really want another sip. This beer is not harsh at all. Just easy drinking all the way. Oh this baby is good! I can drink these all night long. If you're not a big IPA fan I would give this beer a try. It might very well convert you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Crotor,4.64,"Pours a nice, clear light amber, pushing up one finger of head with some staying power, and releasing a big, resinous, piney hop bouquet.  Excellently ""balanced"" for a west coast IPA, with prominent pine and citrus hop aroma and flavor, but without punishing IBUs. Highly drinkable hop-juice, this is. And all backed by clean, solid malt. Goddamn. I do think this is my favorite IPA. It's emminently drinkable, delightfuly hoppy (and in a non-masochistic way). Kudos to Stone for some subtlety in this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Juggernaut,3.87,"Pours a very nice copper color, and has a nice white head that dissapated fairly quickly. Very good, strong hop aroma. You can definitely tell hops make up a big part of this brew, though there is also a very nice malty/citrusy smell balancing it out.  Taste is very hoppy, with a fairly strong up front bitterness flowing into very nice hop, malt, and slitely citrus flavors. Bitterness resides quickly and it has a good body and great mouthfeel, with great overall balance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GreenWBush,4.97,"A beautiful frickin' beer no matter how you slice it, on tap this absolutely kills.  Above most any Stone beer I've experienced the maltiness is damned divine: doughy, gooey, in the forefront.  But the malt isn't what makes this beer so sublime: its the hops, man. Citrusy nose only hints at the spectacular overload you'll get on the first sip. Wicked hop burps like this was pulled out of the tanks yesterday.  Wow. I forgot how damned good this beer is. Blew SNCA out of the water in a side-by-side tasting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dogbrick,4.07,"On draught at Barley's Smokehouse. I think this beer suffers unfair comparisons to Stone's other, bigger beers like Ruination. When trying this one I made it a point to judge it against other IPAs, not against other Stone beers. As such this is a pretty good IPA. Pours a dark amber color with a thick off-white head and nice lacing. The aroma is mostly hoppy, and after struggling a little I could smell some citrus as well. Medium-bodied and very smooth-drinking, with hops and spice at the forefront. Malt and a bit of citrus are in there as well. All in all, while not packing the punch of some of my favorite IPAs, this is an easy to drink and well-made IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dauss,4.32,"Presentation: 12 oz. green and white silk screened bottle.  Appearance: Golden orange color with a small white head that dissapates fairly quickly. It is definitely hazy, but probably just chill haze.  Smell: Hop aroma are extremely strong in this brew. Grapefruity, citrusy, piney, and a little pineapple. Also has this wonderful sweet malt aroma.  Taste: Chockful of hops. Upfront hop bitterness gently balances the intense hop flavor. Slight citrus and graininess in the finish. Bitterness subsides fairly quickly after the sip. Good body and excellent mouthfeel.  Notes: Lots of dry hopping, great hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness. 6.9% is not detectable in the taste, but you can definitely feel it. Great pale ale with good balance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Awesome beer, woo hoo",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,niknar,4.6,"Pours out a hazy copper-orange color with an excellent off-white head that creates thick, lumpy bubbles. Makes a great impression right out of the bottle! The aroma is strong with both pine and grapefruit. Hops and malt take a backseat, but are still present underneath. The taste is as big as the bottle and Stone Brewery's reputation. The hops hit with a huge bang right from the first sip. Some faint hop sweetness works into the fold in the middle, then disappears as the lingering hops slam your senses to a bitter / sour finish that is quite dry. Mouthfeel is just about right: full bodied but carbonated just enough to dampen the blow of the hops. One area this offering scores just a little lower is the drinkability. It's just a bit too sour to drink much. One bottle is probably about all I could handle at any given time. However, all things considered, this is a truly great IPA that is worthy the Stone name.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GeoffRizzo,4.52,"A rather light orange hue, thin yet well retaining head; pine and hops, hops and hops on the nose, intimidating as is the bottle. Creamy, twangy hops blast the palate, malt is there; very very well balanced; smooth and sharp, what an IPA should be. Grapefruit and orange in the tastings as well; whatever the ABV, its sneaky; read and heed; this is one darn fine IPA, the standard which all should be judged. Simple and to the point!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mitchster,4.92,"Clear, light caramel, forming a rocky, pancake-bubbled white head with very good retention and lacing. The aroma is just wonderful with the most intense pine resin odor I've ever smelled in a beer...just wonderfully aromatic and full of sweetly fragrant, floral qualities. Pungent and skunky like marijuana. Carbonation is moderate. The mouthfeel is wet, smooth and spicy with a medium body, leaving the teeth sticky with hop astringency in the finish. I like what it's doing to my mouth with the hop astringency. The taste begins with intense pine resin bite with a nice astringency and pungency, followed by a moderate pine resin bitterness lightly offset by malts kinda hanging out in the background. The finish is all about freshly crushed pine needles with a faint suggestion of thyme or sage. No off-flavors, imperceptible alcohol.  The definitive version of a West-Coast IPA...this is an awesomely pungent beast, yet balanced by beautiful malts, and is supremely tasty. It took me a while to get used to Stone stuff, but this is just one hell of a beer, and one of the top 5 IPA's I've ever had.Stupendous!  Update: It's been a while since I drank this and seeing as how I got a bottle in the 12 days of IPA, I thought I would update since they have tweaked things a bit. Now hopped with Magnum, Chinook, Centennial, Azacca, Calypso, Ella & Vic Secret. 6.9% ABV, 71 IBUs. Pours out a bit hazy with some flittering bits of hop particles suspended. The color is burnt orange. I am now getting lots of cat pee and dog pee. Like this beer owns a kennel. Mouthfeel is still quite smooth, it has a nice well balanced bitterness that doesn't beat you over the head, and there is a nice tannic green tea note in the finish. The very piney bitterness lingers a bit, but it's soft at first, lingers and stiffens up a bit....quite unique, and ultimately it finishes dry. The cat/dog pee thing is there the whole time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gbontrag,4.05,"Boy the just off white head won't quit. thin copper color. there's a glistening spruce forest in my mug from the smell of it. Ooh, needles the palate with a hop portfolio. Fantastic mouthfeel. There's grapefruit rind, and juice. White peppercorns. A malt wash, like a water color of malt. As it warms the malt is still present as a color almost as much as a sweetness. Hops mellow to a vapor. Man this is great with salty hot dogs and hot banana peppers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SCW,3.58,"You can now get stone beer on tap in New York City.  I'm going to take a page out of California hip-hop, cuz I gotta do it. Don't believe the hype.  Suprisingly light for an IPA, this beer is medium bodied at best. The head quickly dissipated and did not leave a trace as it lingered down the glass. The aroma? It was present, but then again, I would like to drink BEER and not grapefruit juice. Too many cascade hops (which, by the way, are the most mass-produced and hybridized hops on the market) make a beer taste more like a cocktail.  The taste was pretty good. The folks at Stone Brewing Co. really know how to achieve a nice balance with their beers.  I wish the beer were a bit more full-bodied and less grapefruit juice. They may be personal preferences, but let's face it.... has not the latest hop craze been a bit cultish and gimmicky?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cncbofh,4.79,"Pours with a nice head which quickly fell away. The color was a golden straw - reminded me of my younger days helping my uncle pitch hay in the fall.  The smell was unbelievably good - strong floral and citrus, cloves and grapefruit... a slight earthy sour smell that I just couldn't place, but it didn't distract.  The taste didn't knock me over with hops - but I literally shivered with goose bumps at the fantastic flavor. This is a well balanced IPA - a decent combo of bitterness from the hops, and a mix of citrus and floral tastes. Orange peels, lemon zest, grapefruit and the perfect amount of hops. The malt base is enough to keep everything together.  Excellent IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jvajda,4.15,"Apearance: Golden-orange color. Modest, frothy white head. Smell: Sour and bitter hop scents. Very fruity. Taste: Creamy and light at first, followed by a barrage of bitter, fruity hops. This beer definitely has that 'Stone flavor' that I I still can't put my finger on. Salty finish that is typical of an IPA, but not over the top. Overall, a very well balanced IPA. Mouthfeel: Creamier than I expected. Nice carbonation. This beer penetrates every crevace of the mouth. Drinkabilty: I might stick with this one for a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pootz,3.8,"12 OZ bottle (thanks Sam). decants a golden-orange color with a big sticky white head that laces the glass... minimal carbonation...scents of plumbs, musty caramel and ample floral hopping. Starts mellow with a nice whack of fruit laden malts....THEN the hops take over and make a complex floral/grassy/bitter mixture from those northwest cones melding with the ample cramel malts gives a buttery peach impression...finish is surpisingly thick with the bitterness restrained by the maltiness plays long on the aftertaste as a lingering bitter fruit impression. A big beer for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bultrey,4.3,"Balance. Ths beer is so balanced. Orange in color, with little yeasties floating around. Once again, I don't find anything out of the ordinary with Stone's beer, just a kick-ass IPA, with loads of West-coast hopping, brewed with perfect balance. Resinous, piney hops, with grapefruit, orange, and slightly floral notes. There is enough malt backbone to keep this from becoming one of those ridiculous hop monsters, but there are plenty of hops, enough to satisfy even the most discriminating of hop heads. Mouthfeel is rather delicate, and the bitterness left on my palate lingers just long enough for me to take my next sip. Drinkability is outstanding -- if ever there were a session IPA, this would be it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LarryV,3.16,"Pours a deep golden amber color with a nice head. Musty, citrusy aroma is inviting. Leaves a nice lacing down the side of the glass as you savor it. Nicely balanced with a creamy mouth feel. A nice IPA. However, I happened to do a side by side comparison with Wachusett's IPA, and the Wachusett comes pretty damn close to this in quality and taste, and is about 2/3 the price.  - Updated 12/16/2008 -  Maybe my palate has changed since my original review 11/01/2004, but I find it difficult to enjoy this beer these days. Aroma is a bit sour, reminds me of homebrew for lack of a better description. Huge hoppiness with a grapefruit like twang, but the problem is that it lacks balance. A more assertative malt backbone would make it less of a one dimensional brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,danadeny,4.12,"pours a nice golden, clear body with a small bubbly head. smells of a nice medium floral hops, and something that reminds me of fruit candy. Tastes pretty good. This beer has a great balance, the hops are not too strong, and dont overpower a light roasted malt flavor. Very smooth and very drinkable. I was expecting some bitterness from stone, but I am pleasantly surprised at the overall balance. This would have to be one of my favorite IPA's, a must try. especially since you would have no clue it is close to 7%",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Skidz,4.25,"Thanks to BuckeyNation for the opportunity! I've been waiting to try this one out.  Pours out golden yellow and sits foggy golden amber in the glass with a good sized foamy white head, nice lacings.  Smells good and malty. Doughy construction with plenty of hops backing it up. Very mild citrus aromas of oranges come though, mostly herbal and peppery hop aromas. Loose strands of alcohol flow from within.  Tastes lightly sweet up front but picks up on bitterness quickly. Green, leafy hop flavors make up the majority of taste. Scant amounts of orange oil and lime are found. Sweetness picks up again and alcohol begins to shine. Makes for a dry, well-bittered finish with bready flavors and hop oils lingering.  Very smooth and rich in the mouth. Crisp and well balanced carbonation. Medium-full body. This beer flows all over the place, very pleasant.  Easy drinking IPA. Not on the top of my list, but it is quite tasty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GDMFSOB,4.29,"Stone can do no wrong. This beer doesn't look like anything too special. I got a one-finger, sticky, white head when I poured this. And other than the somewhat thick appearance, this looks no different than any run-of-the-mill American ale. I almost enjoy smelling this hoppy brew as much as I like drinking it. The sweet, musty nose stays with you even when you walk away from the beer. The taste is just hoppy goodness. It tastes like it should be darker than it is. Great spiciness. The mouthful is oh so creamy and the aftertaste makes me want to crack open another. I think I will. One other note, it's difficult to review this beer because I can't stop guzzling it for long enough to make any thoughtful observations.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,santoslhalper,4.64,"Com'es in a 22 oz. bomber. Pours a very carbonated light copper with a pillowy head. Smells very fruit and hoppy. A georgous boquet. An amazing amount of hops greet your mouth at first, very overpowering and tasty. Finishes suprisingly malty for an IPA/ Round this brew off real well. Nice and bready. Feels creamy in the mouth, and wonderfully drinkable. Could drink this one all night, finding new nuances every sip. Excellent.  Thanks to HardTarget for sending me this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,twelvsies,4,"This is a fairly standard offering from Stone. Appears a very typical amber color with a nice puffy head and great lacing. Smells of course of hops, maybe a bit of fruit in there as well, which in my book is a good sign for an IPA. Taste is very hoppy, but not over the top as Stone often claims to be. Other than that classic Stone bitterness this beer doesn't stand out to me as being particularly challenging. This beer practically drinks itself, it's so smooth in the mouth. Maybe it's because I've been drinking a lot of good IPA's lately (I had a Ruination much earlier in the day) but this beer struck me as solid, yes, it's obviously a good beer, but it doesn't really challenge the style as much as thier other beers do. A good beer to drink nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,newyawker,4.05,"Beatuiful and pale with nice carboantion throughout the drink. Big, fluffy head which is white and leaves a lot of lace. The aroma is piney like a huge truck of hops was dumped straight into the biol. Taste is strong, a bit of alcohol and a lot of citrousy, astringent hop oils dominate the palate immediately. This is a good beer, worthy of a lot of admiration, but in the end I think its biting off more than I can chew. A little too bitter and carbonated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hibernator,4.4,I had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a pint glass.  Appearance is a golden orange. Fluffy white head and great sticky lacings.  Awesome floral aroma and strong hops burst through the nose. Aroma is powerful and distinct.  Taste is spicy up front with a citrus character. Very sticky and resiny mouthful. Sharp bite with a monster hop profile. Piney and syrupy.  I have had this IPA from Stone several times and I finally decided to review it. This is an awesome American IPA that really amazes me. Recommended for anyone who enjoys IPA's with a major hoppy profile.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mntlover,4.1,"Pours a golden copperish mixture with a nice white head that falls to ring of foam but laces nicley. Aroma is mostley floral hops with sweet caramle malt some citrus hints sneaking in. Taste is hops then sweetmalt takes over for an instant then more floral flavors with a bitter kick. This is a very balanced IPA malt and hops in the perfect blend being a Stone I was expecting hop overload but this is just a good solid IPA. If not for the bottle never would have guessed it as a Stone. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, it is a solid IPA, nothing extaordinary but very nicely done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,poundboy,3.9,"A true American style IPA. This is a style which I have only learned to enjoy very recently. Pours into my pint glass with an inch or so thick head which quickly settles into a thin coating which mostly covers surface of the beverage. True Gold in color. Leaves some lacing. You can smell the hops and even the apha acid in this one. The smell gives a pretty good indication of the taste. Hops dominate, which good floral flavors and plenty of bitterness. Smooth pleasant malt becomes apparent in the background as it warms. Overall a very tasty beer, did not enjoy it quite as much as Dogfish 90 minute, but pretty close. Gave it a 3.5 for drinkability because I can't imagine drinking more than say two of these in a night. Thanks Mrpicklerelish for the bottle",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,orbitalr0x,4.42,"Pours from the bomber a wonderful golden orange with a fluffy, bubbly white head. The smell is of bountiful citrusy hops....oranges, grapefruits, pineapple....with some floral tones as well. A bit of caramel in the nose as well. Fun to just sit here and smell.  First taste is well balanced, mouth puckering goodness. The hops are upfront with a nice malt backbone that brings it together well. A good amount of biterness hits the back of the palate. A mix of floral and citrus in my mouth with caramel sweetness that barely makes it out past the bountiful biterness.  Mouthfeel is spot on and makes this brew easy to down. Big gulps make me happy. Drinkability is very good as well. If I had access to this I could down a few in a night and enjoy every minute. Thanks to my friend kmpitz2 for bringing this one by for me!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goose114,4.3,"Pours translucent gold with a fluffy, sticky white head, with lots of bubbles racing to join it.  A symphony of hops fills the nostrils with a dominant piney, resiny note. A sharper hop tone than other examples of the style, done very forcefully and very cleanly. A joy to behold.  Smooth, mellow hop flavor that is as balanced as you want an IPA to be (or at least as balanced as *I* want an IPA to be). The pine and resin notes aren't as prevalent on the palate as they are in the air. The sweetness of the malt is there, but it's been beaten bloody and left to die in the street by the gang of vicious, delicious hops.  A creamy, slightly tingly feel in the mouth leaves you ready for the next sip. I can't imagine how it could be any better in this regard.  The alcohol content leaves this as an iffy choice for a session beer, unless your liver happens to be pickled; however, it's certainly one you can enjoy to kick off or wind down your evening, and one you'll definitely enjoy (unless hops aren't your thing).  As an aside, I really need to do a side-by-side tasting of this and Smuttynose's IPA offering, because each time I drink one, I swear it's better than the other. Hooray for both.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bierguy5,4.22,"From a 12 oz. bottle pours a clear very light amber color with a white foamy head. The head left a little too quick, however there was a nice amount of lace on the glass. The smell of hops hits you immediately. This is more of a grassy, or herbal hop smell compaired to citrus or grapefruit that is common. Although, there seems to be a slight citrus note in the nose as well. The taste again hits you with hops that are spicy and grassy. There is a good amount of malt that keeps this beer from being too out of control. Medium body, carbonation is moderate. The alcohol in this can sneak up on you after a few, but still pretty drinkable. Overall this is pretty straightforward, hops and hops, with just enough malt. Great example of an American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rlcoffey,3.82,"Pours an amber-copper color that is best described as orange. A couple of fingers of white head on top. Traces of lacing left on glass. The smell is an overpowering , yet wonderful hop aroma. Taste is of hops with a flavor Im not thrilled with. Okay, but not great. A little too much of the bitter aftertaste hanging around in the mouth. After finishing one, I dont really want another. I have 5 more to drink, and Im sure I will enjoy them, but its a very good, but not great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kmcnair,4.13,"Sampled in an imperial pint glass from the kegerator.  Light copper color, fluffy white head that lasts, nice lacing. Aromatics are very malty... almost worty with a floral citrus finish. Flavor is extremely well balanced between the hops and the malt. The bittering hops are up front and assertive but moves into a very hoppy flavor with a huge malt backbone, finishes slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is pleasant, medium and slightly dry. Very drinkable, the alcohol is a bit on the high end for a session beer... but thats okay, I enjoy it thoroughly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ncbrewerbun,4.15,"I didn't know that Stone made a ""normal"" beer? This is a very nicely balanced and easy to drink IPA.  The beer pours a golden/yellow color with a nice, inviting white head. Good citrus hop aroma -- and definite American IPA profile. As the beer warms a bit, malt balance comes through in the aroma. Maybe could use a little more malt, but not much. Balance is what makes this beer for me, so I wouldn't want to mess with it too much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TinusTime,4.42,"Had this on tap for the first time recently and Wow what a difference. Pours the same orange-copper colour. Not much of a head, but then again I dont know how long it sat before it was brought to me. The smell is lovely piney hops. Almost a bit medicinal in a good way. The taste is similar to the bottle, but the hops seem fresher and more pronounced. Mouthfeel is smooth with just the prickle of the hoppiness to let you know its still there. Drinkability is great. I could drink this off the tap all night. And WOW what hop burps.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,meathookjones,4.45,"This came in the typical Stone 22oz silk-screened bomber with the gargoyle on it. This poured out a light orange with a tall rising out of the glass head of off white foam. Scattered lacing was left around the glass as this was consumed. Strong floral aromas rose from the glass that was backed by and equally string citric piney smell. Completely hop dominated nose but not to the point of being over done, there was a doughy malt presence keeping it in check. Citric bitterness hit the tongue first with a slightly sweet malt coming though shortly after. The after taste was mildly bitter with an earthy hop bite. A fairly balanced flavor that keep the emphasis on the hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp with about a medium body. I could drink this stuff all day, one of my favorite IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,99bottles,4.42,"22 ounce bottle  Appearance: Poured into a pint glass, this beer has a nice lemony yellow and peach tinited color. The head needed a little coaxing, but I got an inch off a hard pour. Sticky, whispy white foam with average retention.  Smell: This is where it's at. This beer has a dramatic amount of hops in the nose. Sharp piney bitterness and sweet fruity floral scents lie in wait. Wonderfully dry-hopped.  Taste: Very nice. This has ample hop presence; it is initally very raw and bitter. As one continues to sip, the citric sweetness of the hops comes out and melds well with the malts. This is finely tuned to allow the blend of hops to really just stick out and do their work. A very nice, and clean IPA.  Mouthfeel: Good. Not cloying or overly syrupy, this has a good balance of hop oils and malts to allow it to go down smoothly.  Drinkability: I had no problem finishing the bomber. Would I buy more at $6 a pop? I can't say. I know I barely prefer HopDevil just for orginality, and it is much more affordable on this side of the country. Someone brings them to me though....watch out. Glug, glug, glug.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,deejaydan,4.29,"I really like this for an IPA, and I'm not a huge IPA fan. I love the lacing left on the glass and the overwelming aroma of hops. Citrusy and slightly piney notes from the hops. Taste is almost a pallate stripping assult of hops, but there is a bit of malt to be found there, but it's hiding well ;).  Overall, a good IPA. A bit more malt would really make this a winner for me, but overall, not bad at all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DrewBeechum,4.08,"Sampled from a bomber freshly poured into the 3 straight sided pints.  Aroma is piney, catty and depply resinous on a base of toasty biscuit notes.  Flavor matches and follows with a relatively thin toasted malt body competing to hold off the attack of a vigorous American bitterness.  Overall I like the balance of the beer (which is slanted decidely to the hops) and the crispness of the final product.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,heidelbeerg,4.07,"This is my first Stone product. The appearance is nice. Pours a nice golden orange color, slighly hazy with a smallish white head. The smell is fairly strong with hops, hops, more hops and maybe a acid like citrous scent. The taste is fantastic. I am not a hop head but this is loaded with hop flavor and bitterness and I enjoyed it. Wow ! Holy hops ! The mouthfeel is good. Much thicker than I expected. It really coats the tongue and mouth letting the flavorful beer be enjoyed. There is a long lasting aftertaste of well...hops. This is a good IPA. This would be hard for me to drink all night but two or so is just right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JMH_,4.07,"this was, by far, the 'safest' stone brew i've had thusfar, and probably the most disappointing. was it still good? of course, but did not live up to the stone 'hype' so to speak. i expected a hop onslaught, but maybe i'll get that when i sample the ruination later on in the week. this one seemed tame by west coast standards, dare i say more like an east coast ipa. it pours an above average amber colour. nothing special, but better than average. head is fairly thin, but sticky. carbonation is abound throughout the body. the smell is a nice blend of bread, hop, butter and a touch of pina colada. very nice but it doesn't stray much from what you'd expect from an ipa. the flavour is a nice balance between juicy sweet and hoppy. it starts off sweet, moves into the hop attack and then finishes with a dryness that still has hints of juicy sweetness interlaced. the hop burps are quite flavourful. mouthfeel was a touch thin but this was an enjoybale and highly drinkable brew overall. is it strange to say that i enjoyed this one while being let down by it at the same time? well, i was, but i'd still happily sample it again any day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mattcrill,4.57,"Served on tap at Chalkie's in Indianapolis, IN  Appearance: Served in an English Pint glass. A clear amber orange with a rocky white head. This is just a beautiful looking beer.  Smell: Citrusy, floral hops rip my nostrils! A hoppy, bitter smell dominates. Very inviting and a hop-heads delight to be sure.  Taste: Very consistent with the smell. A grapefruit, citrusy sweet taste initially and then a crisp and bitter hop finish.  Mouthfeel: Prickly, medium bodied, and palate blowing!  Drinkability: If I didn't care about my tongue, I would drink them all night! I don't consider myself a huge hop-head and I found myself loving this. It's really a finely crafted beer. Most people probably couldn't make a session out of it but it's refreshing enough that it would work for me.

The aroma is flat-out amazing... once again, I'm engulfed by fumes of new carpet smell (seems to be something each Stone brew I've had has in common with the next), grapefruity citrus smells and honey as it warmed. As expected of Stone, all tastes were huge as well... really spicy up front, honey-cereal sweet and citrus tangy in the middle and then a solid, dry bitterness that coated my tongue and lasted. Mouthfeel is slightly oily with medium body and carbonation, and overall, it's very smooth. One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Stone hasn't disappointed yet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,necoadam,4.03,"22oz bottle. Pours out a deep orange/peachy color with a hint of golden color in there with a nice amount of carbonation that stays with you until the end. Smell consisted of lots of hops. I noticed on the back that it's dry hopped as well. Some background malts can be detected as well along with some citrus notes. Taste was quite nice. Big hops come across first along with some piney notes, but once you think the hops are going to have a huge bite, some nice malts hide the hops along with some citrus notes. Almost juicy-like in taste. Medium body with the right amount of carbonation blending in. Overall a nice well rounded IPA. First Stone I've had and look forward to many more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beerceller99,3.93,22 oz. bottle. The smell of fresh cannabis bud took me back to the days of yore with hydros and grow lights. Poured with no head. The taste was grapefruit bittersweet with enough of a malt presence to keep the hops from overwhelming. The full body of this brew carries the flavors nicely. Probably the best of Stones widely availible beers.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,soper2000,4.3,"Ah Stone Brewing Co Can you do no wrong? By me; no. This one pours a lovely orange color with a minimal white head. Smell is very hoppy and piney though not as assertive as alpha king or dreadnaught. Flavor, at first is predominately hoppy but the aftertaste lets some malt and piney notes come through. Very nicely balanced as I can have 2-3 without any palate fatigue. Excelent drinkablity for a 7 percent ale. Although it won't top alpha king or dreadnaught as my go to beer when I'm having a hop craving, I will definately be returning to Stone's IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dukeofearl,4.42,"Pours a slightly hazy golden with copper overtones, with a medium white head that quickly settles into a nice cover with lace on the sides. Aroma is hops, oily piney, crushed juniper needles, with floral notes sharp and crisp. Flavor incorporates the aromas plus a nice, light, citrus backflavor (just a hint), with a finishing hop bite. A very nice, very enjoyable beer.  Edit (3/30/05): I just reviewed my review, and I don't have any substantive changes to the review itself, except to note that I have found (as a non-hophead), that this really has become my beer of choice when I am in the mood for something hoppy (which does happen once in a while). It just fits the bill.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rugger,4.94,"I love IPA's and especailly big ones, however I know this one isn't a big one, but it comes across as a great one. There is nothing that I can find wrong with this beer. I tried to find something that I didn't like, but I couldn't find it. Pours a beauty of a light copper color with a nice head and some nice lacing. The smell is of a nice hoppy citrus that when you smell you can't help but to say AAAHHH. The taste is smooth and hoppy which is what you want however here we have a nice balance and before you know it you are looking for another one. I only scored this one higher than the arrogance because it is a little lower than alcohol and I could probably drink several more of these before I started forgetting things. Stone Brewery I love you. Please come to Arkansas soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kosmoraios,4.37,"Pours an nice amber-orange color into my Duvel tulip glass. The head is moderate, and dissipates quickly, leaving a bit of a ring of foam. The aroma is excellent. Floral hops, with a bit of that ""good marijuana"" smell, for lack of a better way to describe it. Like dark hydro. The taste is great. One of the better IPAs I've tasted. Very hoppy - a good balance of hops. A little floral. Just the right amout of bitterness. This is how an IPA should taste, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is good, but a bit weak in the carbonation department, in my opinion. A wee bit acidic, also, but that is to be expected in an IPA. Very drinkable. Easy to put multiple glasses of this one away. I highly recommend this ale to anyone who enjoys IPA and ESB styles of beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jimdkc,4.08,"Pours a bright, golden honey color, maybe a bit on the orange side. Head didn't seem to be developing much, so I poured a bit more aggressively toward the end of the pour. That kicked up a decent foamy, white head which soon fell back to a persistent ring that left a good bit of lace. Smell was predominantly floral and citrusy hop aromas. Hints of fruit. There was also something else that I couldn't quite place in the smell that was a bit off. Taste was very good. Initially intense hop flavors: citrus, floral, herbal, and spicy... certainly Cascades are present, but also a good blend of other hop flavors. Hops give way to a bready, slightly fruity, slightly sweet malt backbone. Then the finish is a nice hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying. Not too thin, not too syrupy. I'm enjoying hops more and more lately, and this really hit the spot! Thanks to deejaydan for the sample!  Edit: I'm told Stone uses no Cascades in their beers. Perhaps I'm tasting Centennial or Amarillo... something is lending a citrus note. Whatever they're using... it's very tasty!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Creamy off white head, left a thin layer of foam, lacing clinging to the side of the glass.  Smelled floral, fruity, citrusy, tremendous hop aroma, very inviting.  Taste was very well balanced. Starts very sweet and fruity, but a whole load of hops rush into the picture. There's some spiciness from the hops. Also, there was something very earthy about this beer. This beer had moderate body, and the mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy. Went down really easy. As it warmed, the power of the hops was very apparent.  Wish this was available in Canada...if only it was.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Truh,4,"Dabbled in the dark arts with this one on 4/25/2004. 16-oz. pour at Anam Cara.  Nice, frothy one inch initial head. Very light colored for style; close to a hefe though clearer, almost light straw in hue. Nice hop character, grassy, with hints of long summer afternoons hanging about. The hops corral the taste buds, followed by a Double Bubble chewing gum sweetness, well balanced. After swallow, the hops burst up into the olfactory glands. Chewy hops overall to body, yet infinitely smooth. Could very definitely make this my session IPA.  Not as overwrought as other Stone offerings can be, this is one I would gladly sit down with for a few hours.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IronDjinn,4,"Many thanks to northyorksammy for introducing me to my first Stone product. 12 oz. brown bottle, green and white silkscreened enamel labelling, the blurbs on the back of the bottle are worth reading, the P.R. person comes across as having a personality and something to say with some substance. Pours out a cloudy marmalade colour, thickish foamy head which recedes to a ring and leaves some lacing. Hops are initially present on the nose, but seem to be biding their time, like a leviathan preparing to surface, grapefruit, pine and some spice, but enough malt in it's wake to not make it one-dimensionally overwhelming. Flavour is not as intense as I anticipated, some sweet malt at first triggers the explosion of hops that build and build and build towards and throughout the finish. Earthy and piney at first, then turning citrus, and the grapefruit rind on the finish. A well-contained IPA, the hops are not allowed to completely run wild and get out of control, there is method behind the madness, some direction. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. I think perhaps this would garner a higher rating if I had a fresher sample, but I'm enjoying this nonetheless, it holds up. Definitely worth further sessions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,carln26,3.64,"This IPA pours a bright copper/gold. It has a decent head that didnt retain all that long. A nice lace did stick around after the head deteriorated. The nose is a bright, citrusy hops. This smells fresh, and really gives you a live feel. The taste is a floral/citrus balance on the front. You really dont feel the malt until the back of the taste. Its very good though. . It has a light feel, and a good drinkability. This is high on my list of summer beers.  Had this on tap today at RedBones. I can't change much except the head was great, and the hops in the beer led to an even better retention of the head, and a nice lace. Great floral lead on teh nose. Maybe a little bit more of a bite from the hops than the bottle usually gives.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MattFrenzy,4.02,"Gorgeous screen printed bottle, but thats irrelevant. Light orange kind of cloudy appearance, thin white head. Smells of hops hops hops and spice. Mmmmm. First one knocked me on my ass, second and third became tasty, after the fourth I found myself craving, and the fifth and sixth had me singing praises of Halleluiah Stone!  What a great IPA. More drinkable than other beers of its style, for instance Magic Hat's HiPA. Alcohol is masked by the intensity of the hops. Dry and crisp, another beer that goes well with spicy food. Not overly carbonated, which is great. This beer is a work of art... now to find some ruination...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brewQ,4.09,"Undoubtedly a nice looking package ... poured a hazy honey color.  Lots going on in the aroma, fruity, candy smells (I'm a sweet tooth so those are positives). A challenging brew for those who try to id hops.The taste is also complex. Leaves even layers of lacing.  A full finish coats the mouth. This fits my expectations of an IPA well.  [ I see other have rated this higher- that is understandable. It is very good but did not knock me out].",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigchris1313,4.8,"The appearance? It's beautiful. Somewhere past yellow, but not quite orangish either.  Smell? Smells delicious. Hops and spice. Some sort of spice.  Taste? Hops + spice = Godlike. I love this beer. It just tastes incredible. It's this hoppy, spicy *thing* I just adore.  Feel? It actually feels like something. Not too airy, but not as thick as a porter.  Drinkability? This brew tastes so good that I could drink it until I got tired of life. I truly believe it tastes that good. Again, it all comes from the taste. Which actually comes from the smell...  Anyhow, in conclusion, it's my new favorite beer. If God were to choose a beer, He'd choose the Stone IPA. I firmly believe that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dave750,4.35,"A clear red-gold color with a steadily rising stream of bubbles. A low but tight white head disappears quickly and leaves a ring around the edge and a light haze floating on top in the center of the glass. The aroma is of zesty, minty herbal hops and black pepper. Caramel joins in later. A prominent bitter hop and grass initial flavor is joined by roasted coffee malt at mid-taste. A mild chocolate taste blends in as flavor fades.Leaves a lingering sweet hard candy flavor on the sides of the mouth. Moderately thick body with very good carbonation. Flavor pleasingly biased toward hops. Very smooth IPA goes down easy. Very drinkable",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,surfmeister,3,"Tough to review an interesting and very popular beer that you simply can't drink. In all the categories, smell, taste etc., I had the same reaction, ""wow this is really interesting, even complex"", but in the end I did not want another one. I am not a ""hop head"" so I don't relate to being hit over the head with the overbearing, piney, almost tree sap flavor of hops, which is what this beer is all about. I guess I'm one of those who appreciates the balance of flavors in beer and not too much of any one. Very hard to score this ""interesting"" beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,thinkbreakfast,4.06,"This brew had the head of an IPA, but the body was a little on the light and clear side. The smell was classic, however. The two Gods of Hop scents, Grapefruit and Pine, came through with authority. The malt also made a strong showing, in a supporting role. On the taste front, no hops are spared. Citrusy-bitter and just bitter-bitter, all over the place. The malt keeps the brew semi-thick. The aftertaste is excellently piney. A very solid IPA that I will drink again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,crookedhalo,4.27,"Pours an orangy amber color with a beige, fluffy head. Botanical, piney hop aroma with a bit of tea-like malt aroma, too. Balanced towards the hoppy side, this IPA is quite enjoyable. It's about 90 degrees outside and I could drink this all afternoon. A bit dry and a touch sweet in the finish, but wonderful. I like this IPA a lot. This flagship has some wind in it's sails.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigbeerdrinka,4.12,"This beer pours a dark amber fluffy white head about inch thick which stays forever.. Beautiful lacing on the glass..  Smell: Tones of wet grass, citrus hops, and other stong hops dominate the nose of this beer. Also some slight caramel malt flavors kick in at the end..  Taste: Strong citrus hop flavors combined with a solid bitterness.. Slight malt tones of caramel and biscuit (but I would have liked a little more..) Ending bitterness of this beer is fantastic..  Mouthfeel: Solid body with decent carbonation nice chewy mouthfeel...  Drinkability: For an IPA this has go some fricken IBU's.. but still super drinkable and balanced decently: Personally I would like a bit more of a malt balance...  Overall a great IPA but a little more malt balance would have truly made this beer perfect...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cbl2,4.44,"Appearance:  Clear light brown liquid with an ample amount of slow to settle white head. Nice lacing is apparent after head settles.  Smell:  I love the smell of Stone beers. They are always potent, and in your face. This is no different. Spicy hops predominate, though a crisp malt presence is evident as well. Possibly the best smelling beer I've encountered.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  At first taste, there is a hop explosion in the mouth, but once my taste buds recovered (midsip), this beer becomes startingly sweet due to some nice malts. There are some floral flavors as well. Overly bitter finish, but still the best IPA I've had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goodheflover1280,4.82,"This is my favorite IPA. I love this stuff. The appearance is a clear, light amber color. The smell is beautiful, those flowery hops coming through nicely. The taste...right on for an IPA. It leaves that trademark bitterness on the back of your tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean, refreshing. I like mine nice and cold, a perfect summer brew. The alcohol content is masked nicely, and the drinkability is good. This beer was my first IPA, and I've loved it ever since.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mobyfann,4.02,"Paid $1.69 for a 12oz. bottle  The appearence looks pretty average on the start with the lager-colored base and small white head, but the beautiful lacing during the drink was quite a nice sight. The aroma was really charming in this one; aromatic blend fruity-lemony and sweetness poured in a pint glass, one of the best smells I've ever had.  The taste is a lot of fruits, mainly acidic fruits also that sweetness is there too, it kind of feels like a little-mixed drink is in the bottle; quite interesting! The mouthfeel is nice on the palette, especially at a 6.9% ABV and the drinkability isn't as high, because it is that fruity, where more probably isn't better.  Final Thought: This was my first IPA ever, my first Stone brew ever; and it won't be the last... ever....",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chriscolby,4.17,"From a 22 oz. bottle.  A clear, light amber beer with a decent head. Grainy maltiness and ""American"" hop aromas mingle in the nicely-integrated nose. Spicy hop bitterness with faint harsh notes (not unexpected -- or even necessarily bad -- given the high hop rate). Malt character shows a hint of biscuit and a small amount (relatively) of light crystal malt or CaraPils. Mouthfeel is slighty -- and to me, pleasantly -- on the dry side. The carbonation (and likely the water chemistry) yeilds a sensation somewhere between prickly and creamy.  Good beer. It's very hoppy, yet Stone still keeps enough malt character in the mix -- even though the beer is relatively dry -- to make is a well-rounded beer. The hops are aggressive, and have just enough of a harsh character (for lack of a less value-laden term), to make this a bold hoppy beer experience. If your fizzy -yellow-water-swillin' friends don't ""get"" hoppy beers, this could be the one that opens their eyes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nortmand,4.5,"Very nice amber pour, with a pure white head. Mild hop smell for an IPA, with a definite malt presence. Flavor is very hoppy initially, but rounded by malt. Very balanced. Rich mouthfeel, but not overbearing, causing this to be very drinkable. For the price, one of the best IPA's out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,blitheringidiot,4.37,"Appearance? Its pointless. Like asking a hot chick why she broke up with her last boyfriend, who cares!!! Just enjoy!  OK, lets do this anyway: 6.9% ABV label. Ingredients: Barley Hops, Water & Yeast.  Quite cloudy golden peach hued pour, scant suds over the pour with a slick of a white head. Here & there lace down the sides.  Sniff sniffTotal fruit and caramel. Whew thats aromatic! Ripe oranges, tropical fruit like pineapple, lemons & pomegranite. Mmmm.  Total STONE house flavors of juicy fresh fruit cornucopia of lemons, oranges, hints of limes, bitter dry finish taste with lasting super complex fruit. The list goes on 'n on. I wonder what kind of hops are in there.  This is a damn good beer! A fist punch of acidic sizzle (not quite Ruination) blends with a mixed fruit cocktail of taste.  Last swigs: Fruity sizzle feel, with plenty of West Coast hops. Bold IPA in da house. Some quality breweries have a two or three tiered system of good, better, best versions of their beers. TROEGS has Pale (good) Hop Back (better) and Nugget Nectar (best.) STONE has IPA (good) Arrogant Bastard (better) and Ruination IPA (best.) This, of course, is all in appreciation of all beers. STONE is anti Cascade Hops.  A bit cloying and tang like to be an all nighter drinker. Cheers! Beer is good. Happy IPA beering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dithyramb,4.25,"Copper pour with a light white head. Stays attached to the glass until about half way down. Slightly lighter than most IPAs.  Very flowery nose, you can definitely tell the hop influence.  Bitter hop goodness. This is the most full-flavored beer I've had in a while. Nice malty undertone to balance it out.  Sticky on the tongue, but goes down nicely. Hoppiness stays in the mouth for some time.  Just tried this Friday in the overpriced bar in the Philly train station. It was a toss up between this and Magic Hat #9. This is my first time trying a Stone. This is a very nice beer, extremely full-flavored. This may come from the ""dry-hopped"" process. It doesn't have the citrus flavor seen with most IPAs.  I had to follow this up with nappy traffic to the shore. The hoppiness stayed in my mouth for some time. I'd definitely like some more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beertaster13,4.45,"I now pray to the gargoyles of stone. This IPA is a powerhouse, steroid pushing machine that is off the charts terrific. Of course had this in the standard 22 oz bomber bottle. Pours a cloudy hazy gold with a cream white froth of a god head. Smell is potently hoppy, hops blast your nose, might singe the nose hairs right off, cleary sinuses for sure. Light citrus as will. The taste is a perfect balance of bitter and smooth. Fruity tones and a hop blast that blends perfect with the fruit and malts. Feels full and crisp and could drink and drink and drink. The beer was so special the moment of putting it to my lips will last a lifetime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hustlemuscle,4.32,"Gold, with good carbonation. The head receeded quicly, but left thick lacing as a calling card.  Really nice piney and citrus hops greet the nose.  Man, this stuff is good. Nice blend of hops, but smooth, with the good ol' IPA pucker. Suprisingly full bodied, this bad boy is one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure to behold, and every trip to Columbus (55 miles) has me bringing back a sixer or two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Hunter,4.33,"Holy hops, batman!  The smell of it is there the moment you crack the bottle and begin the pour. Beer the color of burnished brass, under a thick eggshell head that pours fast and thick and hangs around. Very little carbonation, typical of the style.  Aroma is hops, hops, hops. Is there malt, or grains somewhere in here? There must be, with 6.9% ABV, but I can't get to them over the hops. At least it smells fresh and clean.  Hops in the taste, from start to finish. Nice bitter bite, without becoming acrid in the aftertaste. This is definitely an excellent representative of the style. you can almost imagine being a British soldier stationed in India, longing for the next shipment of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,silenius,4.42,"I don't really know what I can say about this beer that many others have not. I agree with most reviews. The beer pours a clear gold color with a solid head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. Pinpoint carbonation bubbles continue throughout the session.  The nose is hops and Frute Brute cereal. Not over-powering, but if you stick your nose in the glass, it is unmistakeable.  A very pleasant hop taste with a light fruity note that persists on the palate long after the beer has left one's mouth.  A solid effort that I will buy when I find it. Currently, it is not available in the Chicago market.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,JackTheRipper,4.47,"A: Clear amber with a slight head but sort of nice lacing on the glass. S: Overwhelmingly, unabashedly, (insert long superlative)-ly hoppy. T: Hoppy, hoppy, hoppy. Nuff' said. This one makes no excuses, and is bitter and citrusy with a nice long balanced finish. Hops rule. M: big and bold, crisp and dry. Carbonation and alcohol levels are spot on. D&N: This is what an American IPA should taste like. So good, I'm wondering why it took me this long to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IceAce,4.48,"Appearance: The body of this brew is a light copper color with a slightly off-white collar of foam. Lacing is excellent and clarity is over-the-top perfect. This is easily off the chart perfection.  Aroma: The nose holds the obvious hop notes (edit: Cenntenial & Chinook hops) with an underlying floral sweetness that makes the mouth salivate in expectation not unlike one of Pavlov's fabled pooches.  Taste: The dry hops are sticky to the tongue and the flavor is all-hops followed by support from the barley. The taste is sweet with piney overtones as this West Coast IPA flexes its mighty dry-hopped muscle. The Brits only wish they had shipped ale this good to India!  Mouthfeel: This brew provides something for every bit of the mouth as the taste sends the entire tongue into high gear. The C0² level and quality malt provide a superb base for the onslaught of floral hoppiness.  Drinkability: A great all-day sipper if you're in the mood for an IPA, although my guess is that the taste buds would be burned up after several pints (that's a compliment).   Authors note: I just learned today that Stone is a Cascade-free brewery...who would have guessed!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WesWes,4.24,The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is exceptional! It has a beautiful array of floral hops which penetrate along with a solid malt scent. The taste is good. It has an intense hop flavor overpowering it's malt core. It goes down smooth and finishes quite bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great IPA. The aroma is awesome along with a really good hop and malt flavor.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,taez555,4.2,"This beer poured a fully white head with a clear, slightly hazy, tan body.  The nose was just classic stone. Citrus, fruit malt, black pepper, sweet pepper, big malt, with a slight metallic overtone.  The taste was medium to full bodied. Big rich and malty. Spicy citrus hops add just the right depth of hop flavor as well as a very even bitterness. A perfectly drinkable IPA. Beautiful hop flavors and malt body. It takes a while to die down, the bitterness fades slowly.  I wish I could say more about this beer, its really a fantastic beer. One of the best IPAs out there. I think the only problem with this beer is that its overshadowed by its big brothers. Its amazing, but compared to the ruination? Then you have the others in its family, the double bastard, and the imperial stout. Stone has just set the bar so high this one gets lost in the crowd. A great beer though. One Id have over and over again if the ruination didnt exist.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RocketWidget,4.47,"Once again, Stone goes ahead and proves why they are one of America's finest brewers. Pours a rich opaque gold with light head. Smell is potent, thick with hops, tangy and sweet. Taste is outstanding. Lightly carbonated, the hops flavors dominate without overwhelming the tastebuds, which allows the beer's sweetness to shine. Aftertaste is primarily bitter, with a lingering sweetness. Absolutely delicious, would go great with a heart meal. Thumbs up!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Southernbrew,4.25,"Nice orange color with a small bubbly head.  Nose full of crisp, citrus and piney hops. So enticing, patience is wearing thin.  Wow, full body, smooth with prickly carbonation. Full of grapefruit and hop bitterness. Not oily like many IPA's, awesome. Slight flowery flavors follow up in the rear and finishes with a bitter dryness.  Awesome beer, finally a chance to try a Stone brew and it does not disappoint. Now I need to try that bottle of Ruination I picked up. Yeehah!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,budsboy,4.1,"Thanks be to Hustlemuscle for this 12 ozer.  Pours a clear yellow-orange with an off-white, frothy head, not too big, that hangs around a bit.  Smell is nearly all hops, citrus and pine. Not much malt scent, not much expected.  Taste is thoroughly hoppy, mostly pine with citrus overtones, biting bitterness near the finish. A cool but bitter aftertaste.  Much less oily than so many IPAs. I'd call this a medium-bodied beer with big beer intentions.  Very inviting brew that will make you thirst for another and another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Stimack,3.95,"Had this brew on tap at Mahars the other night. Brew poured to a very nice brown/orange color with a slight head that broke down to light lacing. The aromas of this brew were all about the hops as I notice a piney, earthy smell with hints of grapefruit. The taste is very much about the pungent hopiness of this brew as you can notice it at the front and end of this brew. In the middle I am able to get a great biscuit (?) malt flavor that seems to keep things in somewhat of a balance. Over all a nice brew, definitely west coast and different from the IPAs that I am use to but a very good brew. Will looks for this brew in the future!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BadBadger,4.13,A better than descent India Pale Ale. Wonerful hops. Pours a beautiful rich amber color. There is a nice off-white head. A slight fruity nature to the smell (and taste). Taste is good: bitter with a fruity tinge. Definitely worth searching out and trying.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,andyo,4.57,"What an IPA!  This beer was a delight to drink. IPA is my wife's favorite style of beer, so when I came home with this bomber, she was guite pleased.  Anyways, this beer poured a beautiful golden/orange color, with a nice frothy head. The head did not stick around too long, but it's healthy reminents beautifully coated the glass all the way till the last drop.  The taste was very crisp, sweet, and had citrus, floral, and grassy notes. The beer coated my tongue, yet was not too thick or too thin-very balanced.  All in all, a very nice beer! I wish it wasn't priced at $9.26 per six pack, though. Looks like this will be an occasional treat for me.  Cheers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

I am waiting for you all my life and you have come upon me like the mysterious women in red, or maybe my california dreamin,or-- whoops back to sober web reality. This beer makes me swoon with delight and give thanks to the gods of hops that are thee stone folks. to start with the mortal apects- color only does so much for me as this beer is a yellow-orangish color, circa psychedelic 1971. We quickly take it to another level. In the sublime sense, clarity is wonderful and the smell is a heavenly sweet smel of floral hops. Excellent carbonation and wonderful head and glass lacing. this beer imparts a perfectly balanced beer drinking experience. taste is sensational with strong floral sweet tones of wildflowers and fresh cut grass. The sweetness balanced with an intense but mellow bitterness lingers, and flows, lingers, and flows on the tongue and through the palate. Drinkability is exceedingly dangerously high. A top notch, memorable representation of the style. a session beer for professional drinkers, with a connesouiers character profile. Easily in my top ten. My current sublime trip of choice. cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Beaver13,4.1,"Stone IPA pours a golden color with some miniscule floaties. It has a huge, frothy, white head that lasts forever.  The nose is huge on hops (kind of on the grassy, piney side)! There are also some grapefruit tones. Very appealing!  The taste is hop juice up front, leading to some citrusey, bready malt. It ends with a big, bitter hop finish and aftertaste. It's medium bodied and fairly well balanced - though it obviously favors the hops over the malts. The slight malt and citrus help balance it well.  Overall, this is probably the best IPA I've had to date. It's a nose ahead of Avery IPA and Victory Hop Devil.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gasp100,4.12,"This is still the only Stone beer that I've managed to purchase by the case. I will have to pull the trigger on a case of bombers one of these days. This pours a creamy, orange-amber with a sticky, foamy off-white head and nice lacing down the glass. The smell is sweet citrus hop perfume with slight pine, grass and lemon. Oh what a wonderful bouquet! The taste is creamy, hoppy, soft, brittle... all of the above with a full malt backbone which tries to offset the hops, but just cannot win this battle. This is clearly a ""west coast"" IPA but so much more.... it's like a creamsickle it's so smooth and very nicely balanced overall. I wish I could find Stone products in quantities less than a case, but alas I will have to save up for my next foray into their wares. In the meantime, I have 23 more bottles of Stone IPA waiting for me in the fridge... gotta go!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,abcsofbeer,4.22,"Pours a light coppery, orange color with a 1/4 off-white head. The head quickly dissipates, but the lace delicately clings to the glass to the bottom. The aroma immediately hits you as abundantly hoppy, naturally, as that is the trademark of this beer.  The first taste hits your mouth in a flourish of hops and perfect bitterness. It would definitely turn off your ordinary beer drinker, but to the sharp tastebud, it is ideal. It has a lime-like aftertaste and the carbonation is very well balanced.  It finishes very strong and is good to the last drop. I will buy more from Stone and can only hope they are all this good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,wyllder,4.32,"A splendid IPA.  Appearance is somewhat cloudy, medium amber with a modest head. Smell is a nice mix of citrus hops with some earthiness to it.  Taste is exactly what you expect from a quality IPA: an initial kick of hops as it hits your tongue, balanced quickly by malt and a nice lingering hoppiness to the aftertaste.  Never had this in the bottle. On tap it has a similar feel to Victory's HopDevil bottles, though the Devil is a good bit more aggressive on tap. Overall, exactly what I would expect of Stone in an IPA. Well done!  Wyll-",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goindownsouth,4.72,"A beautiful 1 pint, 6 ounce bottle. I am sad to see it leave my fridge.  This is an awesome looking brew. The colour is golden, yet hazy, while the head was respectable, and left a good lace throughout the beer. The aroma is all about the hops and piney resin. This is some good stuff. I mean there is legitimate, bare-bones hop spice that would make any IPA-lover proud. The flavor is crisp and clean, with great notes of bready-like chewiness and fabulous maltiness. A fantastic IPA, and one I will be begging for in the future, as well. Beers like this are the reason I am happy to call myself a Beer Advocate.  Zum wohl!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Lupe,4.58,"Hazy golden-amber color with a frothy white head that leaves sticky rings of lace. Floral and citrus hop aroma with some herbal notes along with hints of fruit and sweet malt. Rich flavor with a good combination of hops and malt. The malt peeks out from the hops with, fruit, a hint of caramel sweetness, and lightly toasted bread. Big time hop flavor with citrus (grapefruit and lemon), pine, and grass, with herbal and floral notes. Tantalizing bitterness is not overpowering, but assertive and draws you in for another glup. Alcohol stays hidden. Finishes dry with hops in the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, smooth and creamy yet also crisp. Highly drinkable and very tasty. A great IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gentlebubbles,3.76,"on tap at Redbone's  I *know* I saw lovely, creamy heads on other glasses of this stuff! But for whatever reason, mine was served with no head, which is probably why I could only detect a faint, sweet scent  My taste buds were overwhelmed by luscious, grapefruity hops and the creamy mouthfeel.  I'm hard-pressed to distinguish it from the Brutal Bitter I've been drinking for a week. I will have to keep trying both of them.  So good it made me give money to a begger--and chat with him! That can't be such a bad thing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bruiser81,4.72,"This beer has a light orange color, almost completely clear. I poured aggresively but still didn't get a very large head. Still looks tasty though. The aroma from this beer is probably the best I've encountered or my sense of smell is really on today : ). First hit is a huge wallop of citrus. Has a little bit of grapefruit but it doesn't make up the bulk of the citrus. It also seems like their is a friggin huge bouquet of flowers in there somewhere. Light carmel malts and slight hints of pale malt as well, along with subdues alcohol spices. Taste is delicious. Seems to very well balanced. Strong malt presence up front. Slight hints of carmel. This is quickly met by a huge hop explosion which tastes strong at first but ends up smoothing itself off by the aftertaste. Hops are floral and sort of piney. Not as much citrus in the taste as in the smell but still some. Alcohol spices are somewhat present on the finish but lightly so. A medium-light mouthfeel. Extremely easy drinking. Big Thanks to Quaffer hooking me up.  I just got my hands on another one and it was every bit of delicious as before. Had to come bump the scores a little bit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,twilight,4.35,"Yum city, but with some reservation.  Pours a dark orange/ medium yellow witha head that ends up coating about half of the beer to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is malty, kind of like sticking your nose into a bag of dried malt extract, but it also has that sting of hops there in the background. Taste is- taste is malty, but immediately goes to the hops and just lingers there on your tongue, producing an aftertaste of sweet, sweet hop goodness.  I truly love this one, but it's even better on tap. The hops are much fresher and the taste is cleaner, but that's a different review. Still a great tasty brew, and I love having it at home.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,coasterfreak75,4.13,"The pour was light amber almost bordering on copper. It had a good three quarter inch head, thick and foamy, that quickly dissapated to a light beige ring around the beer. This ring held on throughout the glass.  The smell a mix of floral, fruit and spice. The tip of the nose picked up a light floral kick. The rest of the nose picked up an apple scent mixed with heavy hop spice.  The drink started with a slight sweetness, followed by hops, hops, and more hops. The hops were nipping at the tongue really from start to finish, but they weren't so overpowering that it was undrinkable. The finish was borderline clean, just a slight lingering hop taste.  All and all a very drinkable beer with great mouthfeel. As it warms it gets more and more character. What I liked about this beer was the fact that it was agressively hopped, but no so much that the hops took over the taste totaly. A very enjoyable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FormatKid,4.77,"I purchased a 22oz bomber of this from Ziggys in Chattanooga. I have to make a pretty decent trip to get anything over 6.0% abv but its usually well worth it.  This pours out a very lightly murky, pale yellow/orange. A beautiful bubbly head rolls up 2 ½ fingers high. Small zippy carbonation bubbles rise rapidly to the top. Lacing forms in rings and clings beautifully. Appearance is well in order for the style.  As soon as the bottle is opened the odors rush out and roughly massage and entice my sense of smell. God, I love the way this beer smells. Like standing in the middle of an orange orchid or something. A sweet malty smell is detectable in the background but those fresh, delicious smelling hop fragrances take center stage.  This beer absolutely makes my mouth water. Just enough sweet malt background here to keep this from tasting overly-hopped. Taste is astringent as it plays across the front of my tongue, then a mild sweetness glides over but is put in a choke hold by the diversity of hop flavors I detect. Apricot notes/strong citrusy fruity notes as well as juicy pine and floral flavors dance over my tastebuds. Aftertaste is dominantly citrus. Mouthfeel is refreshing and dry without being a cotton-mouth choker. No alcohol taste is present to me at all.  This is one of my favorite beers, definitely the best non-imperial IPA Ive tasted to date. To be honest with you I like this one just about as much as Ruination depending on what Im in the mood for. This one being a little more balanced and aggressively hopped yet still sessionable without destroying my taste buds or dehydrating my tongue. If I was rating strictly on enthusiasm Stone IPA would get straight 5s.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rajendra82,4.6,"Pale golden body with a massive beige head that refused to die due to nice natural carbonation. Aroma is floral, grassy, piney hops with an infusion of yeasty bready malt. The taste is a wonderland of hops with spicy-hot pine resin like quality to the beginning of each sip. Following that first assault by the hops, there are additional waves of grapefruit rinds, black pepper, marigold, and orange blossom. The malt adds a butterscotch like sweetness to the mix, and the yeast adds a grittyness to the mouthfeel. This is one of the absolute great IPAs anywhere. I look forward to the day when I can get this at my local store.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Zorro,4.2,Pours a hazy gold brew.  Smell is malt and sharp citrus like hops.  Taste is sweet from the malt and medium bitter. The hops level in this enough to start numbing your tongue. Tasty and not quite hopped to the point it is the only flavor.  Mouthfeel is good.  A drinkable brew it is almost too much in the hops department.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Globetrotter,4.2,"I like living outside the U.S. I spend a lot of time ""overseas"" and rarely regret it. There are times, however, when something happens that tells me, ""Lord, I need to go home."" Drinking Stone IPA is one of those moments. Purchased in the DC area by a friend, and hand delivered to Moscow by a colleague, I sit here on a rainy Saturday afternoon nurturing this lovely brew and thinking about all the great IPAs I'm not getting here. Sigh.  Pours a slightly cloudy light copper hue under an off white 1 finger head that lingers for a bit before settling to foam. There are some lace rings on the glass, but not much. The aroma is full of sweet flowery hopes - really full. Mouthwateringly full. The mouth is medium-bodied and slightly carbonated. The taste? Gosh, it's pretty good. Lots of sweet flowers and bitter hops, with a quite noticeable malt backbone. The finish is quite bitter, leaving a wonderfully crisp aftertaste that combines the malt with a hoppiness that makes you want to chew. Although I've had beers I thought were more bitter, this is definitely my kind of beer, and I can't get it where I live. Time to move!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,marburg,4.42,"This beer is succulent. It oozes like a ripe tomato.  Hazed. Head is kind of fascinating. Lightly clings to the sides of the glass like thin white crystals rising up from the beer. Piney intense hop nose backed with a bit of Cracker Jack.  Completely hoppy. Grapefruity all the way. Certainly crisp and appropriately taste bud annhiliating. But this has a real complex fruit presence, and the alcohol, perhaps, lends a hint of sweetness that more brutal, unforgiving IPAs lack. This is still a big beer, but somehow they manage to make it more quaffable. As a non-IPA lover, I say this is a damn fine IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ark57,4.12,It pours a bright orange color with a slight haze and a thin head. There is some decent lacing. The aroma has a lot of hops and some fruity grains. The bitterness is up front. The medium body is slightly grainy and sweet. It finishes with alingering dry bitterness. One helluva IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,travolta,3.69,"22 oz bomber  Apperance: Head was thick, white and laced very nicely. The color was inviting. It was gold or mild apricot. The head lasted a while, but not long enough. It gave way to a patch-worked head. Some think parts and some thin parts. the rings were nice.  Nose: Man! Stone brews have the best smells. This one was all hops malt and a bit of fruit and flowers. It was hoppy at first and sweet at the end.  Taste: Carbonation was not rough, but opened the palate very well. Again, I get hops, a lot of malt, and some fruits at the end. The end leaves you with an organic leafy type of taste in the mouth. Very nice.  Notes: This is sooo drinkable. Not too bitter, but very malty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerAngel,3.37,"Pours a hazed golden orange color with a modest but lasting off-white head. The smell is overwhelmingly citrusy hops as an IPA should be, but not far behind it is a nice biscuity malt and a light sweetness as well. The taste is , whew!, a very sharp citrus hop bite that hangs around but slowly lessens to reveal the fresh baked bread flavored malt that stands distantly behind. This is a medium bodied brew that finishes almost brutally dry.  Notes: This one is just about the hops IMHO. Have you ever chewed on hop pellets...this is what it's like. I tried it at 50 degrees and on and off all the way to 60 degress and I can't get more of the malts. If you like balanced brews, this one is not for you. These kinds of brews are not hard to produce. It is okay, but not real good. It is rather one dimensional to come from a brewery of this caliber. Shocking to me that it is top rated when there are so many more complex beers out there. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,proc,4.67,"An excellent IPA.  This one poured out of its 22oz. bottle to a golden-amber in the glass with a decent head. Some light particles of suspended yeast present in the glass. The aroma is that of grapefurit, hops, sweet malt and marshmallows...yes, marshmallows. The taste is superb and perfect IMO as far as balance between hops and malt. As hoppy as this beer is, there is an excellent malt presence that makes this oh so drinkable.  Yet another fabulous beer from this brewery. Greg...get this to Michigan, my friend... ;-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Quaffer,4.29,"22 oz. Bottle  Appearance: This beer was a glowing, golder-amber color. It was surprisingly light, not being much darker than some of the more robust macros out there, such as Stroh's. The clarity was amazing. A nice, two-finger, eggshell head rose up and lingered for a long time. As it settled it became rough and fluffy, until there were just some thick patches left floating on the liquid. These eventually thinned out as well, but there was always a thin cap of foam laying over the top of the beer. Lots and lots of lace was left behind, which was really cool.  Smell: Right after the pour, this brew was pure, unadulterated, raw hops. As the beer sat, this developed into a juicy, citrusy hops smell. This was joined by the aromas of caramel and caramel malt, roasted malt, and crackers. Add in hints of vanilla and orange, and the aroma became very full and complex. Nice and round and warm smelling. Extremely impressive.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and very smooth. It flowed easily through the mouth, with just a hint of a coating effect. There was no roughness at all, being silky, almost buttery, at times. Occasionally, I thought that this beer seemed almost too smooth for the style.  Taste: Almost immediately, after an initial hit of sweet malt, a big herbal hops flavor rose up to dominate the taste. The hops added a lot of bitterness as well, though it didn't compare to the amount of flavor that they provided. Underneath the hops were some sweet malt and hints of roasted malt. The more that I drank, the more the roasted malt came through, which did wonders to balance out this brew. On the finish, the malt flavor became more caramel-like without becoming any sweeter.  A great beer that was more balanced at times than others. Some mouthfulls seemed to be all hops, and others seemed to balance out perfectly. Those that fell into the latter catagory were absolutely wonderful. I just wish that the citrus characteristics of the hops that came through in the aroma would have made it into the flavor. The flavor was all herbal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Foxman,4.45,"It pours a rich clear amber, with ascending rivulets of carbonation. Two fingers of ivory head slowly settle down to a thin foamy pillow. There's stringy valances of lacing along the glass's sides.  On first whiff, a dense thrust of hops hits the nose, delivering dry citrus, flowers, and pine in seemingly equal strong parts. Far below, a sweet tinge of caramel glazed malt meanders.  Upon tasting, the hops fly in on many levels. A resinous deciduous character arrives first, with pine and a glimpse of juniper. A dry citrus note of grapefruit makes a swirling appearance. A fainter floral tone cedes to a gently overmatched toasted malt essence of caramel and biscuit. The malt's role is brief, soon stepping aside for a less distinct general hops bitterness at the finish. The malt is a real underling here, but the hops worrk very well as the boss.  Pretty much medium bodied, the oily hops lubricate every surface in the mouth, depositing clinging flavor everywhere. The heavy hops profile leaves a long-lasting glow as the tingle lingers.  Absolutely, the hops are where it's at. The malt provides a notably subtle sub-layer, but it's there only to keep the hops from sucking the skin from the inside of your mouth. Still, for all the hop oils present, the bitterness is deliciously manageable. No person who craves hops could stop at one of thse, and in fact, I'm not stopping and refuse to count how many I've had. How many just doesn't matter, because satisfying a hops addiction is a timeless, unquantifiable joy when this nectar is around to do it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pheurton,4.3,"on tap at the gingerman: slightly hazy pumpkin orange-tinted brown. big creamy off white head the stayed around the whole time. tantalizingly huge spruce hop aroma with light fruity esters and citrus in the background. this is a very appetizing beer to look at and just inhale. perfect level of carbonation...sturdy medium body that is nice and chewy yet still perfectly crisp. crystal/bready malt flavors hold up rather well to an enormous pine needle hop bite. citrus tones are there but take second fiddle to the resinous piney taste. dry hopped to perfection. finishes super clean and dry and enjoyably bitter. hop burps last for hours. this is one helluva an IPA, i think i enjoy this one even more than the ruination. seems crafted with surgical precision, a hop-head's quaffing delight. delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,krberg,3.95,"Nice bronzy color with a very small, white head that fades very quickly.  Smells like an IPA. Tangy hops, but not a huge amount of them.  Smooth. Great hop-malt balance. Where's the craziness? Sure this is a solid beer, but I'm left looking over my shoulder expecting to be blindsided.  Feels fairly thick in my mouth. Almost creamy. Feels almost perfect for the hop level.  No doubt about it, this is one damn drinkable beer. It never assaults the palette, thereby staying a pleasure to drink swig after swig.  Honestly, I was very underwhelmed by Stone's IPA. I guess I expected their signature (and wonderful) over-the-topness (yeah, I'll make up words, who's gonna stop me?). Once I got over that, I came to realize that this is a great beer meant for drinking, not knocking you on your ass. If this is locally available, you are lucky. If you are me, you have to drink 2 hours to get some more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,avylover,4.49,"Glad to see this in the 12oz bottles that have surfaced lately. Pours out a golden yellow with a stiff white head. Aroma of grapefruit and apricots. The hop flavor of this beer is tremendous, and should be a decent intro to hops seeing as the flavors are at the forefront, not the bitterness.Nice citrous hop blast with a mildly bitter aftertaste. There is some maltiness in there, but it provides a good base, not flavor. The Hops take over in this department. This is probably the best straight up IPA on the market for any hophead. Mouthfeel is slick then dry, and I could drink this all night. Top Notch!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Riggo,4.37,"For a west coast pale ale, a surprisingly light, clear, golden appearance--like a lager. However, it's quite handsome actually, with a creamy, pearl-white head, good retention and lacing. The nose on this one is gorgeous, with a perfume-like intensity. A strong smell of pine sap dominates, mixed with notes of grapefruit and perhaps orange zest. Very fresh, bright and green. The flavor follows suit with leafy, spicy, green hops dominating. Despite the intense green hop element, there is a certain ""butteriness"", along with fruitiness (bubblegum) and a sort of peaty quality. Finish is clean and bone-dry with a slight cookie-like aftertaste. Drinkability is good, despite the high hopping rate and high abv.  The ""green-ness"" of this beer reminds me of Dogfish Head 60-Minute IPA, but this one is much better balanced. Yeah, its pretty much a one-note song--hops--but its balanced nonetheless. Exciting stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HappyHourHero,4.32,"Wonderful citrus hop aroma, almost candy like, some grapefruit and oranges, damn! Half inch head, whitish yellow in color, leaves a smattering of broken lace above the clear, deep golden colored beer. The flavor is pretty intense, and actually increases after its swallowed. Light to moderate body with a pretty clean taste, the beer stops just short of being really bitter. Piney, citrus hop flavor up front , finishes like a bitter sugary grapefruit. At 6.9% abv it does a pretty good job of warming up my stomach. Theres a lot of flavor and aroma packed into this smooth drinkable beer, a really good (American) IPA. Hopefully once Stone is widely distributed in central NY the prices will come down because $5/22oz is a bit much to drink this often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,watermelonman,4.5,"This is a great beer. It's very hoppy, but it doesn't punch you in the face like many other beers that advertise themselves as such. Both the hops and alcohol content are potent, but very well blended. Drinkability is outstanding.  This is my favorite IPA to date.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gueuzedude,4.42,"Pours a clear copper color and is topped by a off white head. An immediate big hop aroma jumps from my glass and overpowers any malt presence that this beer might have. The aroma is grassy, herbal, citrusy, & it has a sweet hop nectar character. Quite simply, as I take my first sip, I know this is a hoppy bitter brew. The hops explode on your tongue. There is a balancing malt sweetness here that is required to carry this hop bomb. The hop character has strong notes of bergemot as well as some resiny overtones; this is just pure hop nectar. A very fruity beer, made more so by the citrusy hop character. Quite over the top in it's hoppiness. This beer is just damn good & I am so happy to get this on tap on a regular basis.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LuckySevens82,4.31,"Thanks again to JTFest for hooking me up. 22 oz bomber, emblazoned with the stone brewing gargoyle, somewhat unassuming, but I'm still looking forward to it. Pours a crystal clear orange. I'm having a hard time remembering having an IPA that was so clear. The head dissapates somewhat quickly, but the lacing stays. Wow, that is a great IPA. Bitter, floral and smooth. The smell is extremely hoppy and somewhat deceptive because the taste isn't that strong. Not quite as tart as some IPAs which is, IMHO, a good thing for this beer. This is just a great beer, I look forward to trying the Ruination to compare the two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ngandhi,4.3,"*In celebration of my new (and first) salaried job*  Served chilled with chilled San Pellegrino on the side.  Aggressively carbonated with a beautiful mousse on top, Stone IPA looks like the perfect pale ale.  The nose is citric and tropical in the tradition of west coast pales, tinged by an intriguing and mouth watering spiciness, with complimentary notes on the palette that open up to grain and a surprisingly balanced bittering. The finish is all mangoes, soon to wash out, with the bittering mysteriously missing.  It's unsatiating to get a beer from Stone that isn't so torturously bittered. This is, however, very much to style. The malts supply ample body, sweetness, and grain, but are a touch too concentrated for the hops. I'm picking hairs, however, between greatness and perfection.  Among American-style IPAs, this is one of the finest, but I would have liked to have seen more from the hops than the simple (and expected) fruits and less from the malt. More to the point, there's a paradox in this beer -- a touch too malty on the mid-palette, yet too thin on the finish.  But Stone IPA is only an interpretation of a style and to hold it to strict standards is foolish. Above all, this beer is confident -- more confident, I'd say, than their bigger beers because it is so true to form, so willing to rank itself against other IPAs. And that kicks ass.  Relax, relax. ng",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BitteBier,4.47,"Pours a slightly hazy golden apricot color. Topped off with a reasonable amount of head that lasts and laces in pretty typical fashion. A surprisingly well-balanced nose for an IPA (though after drinking an Arrogant Bastard Ale beforehand, everything is relative). Floral hops are offset by plainly detectable light malts. This balance carries over to the taste, where the hops and malts play well together. Crisp, clean and very drinkable, this is a really nice IPA all around.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AllThingsNinja,3.92,"This golden beer almost looks a bit too light under a modest white head. It offers a very hoppy aroma, which hints at the initial tastes - a symphony of well-blended hops. Unfortunately, the brew doesn't maintain it's complexity throughout the tasting, as it finishes thin and bland. For an IPA, the brew is a bit light but it is still quite drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Rastacouere,3.01,"It pours a clear filtered? yellow with a small white head, this could be a pilsner and giving it 3 makes me wonder if I'm too kind just because it's Stone. Aroma is hop essence literally.. with a hint of fuel and quite salty as well together with the more traditional citrus, lemon and grapefruity profiles. A good sniffing which appeals me by its originality. Taste surprises right away being very citric. I simply don't understand how so many people can love it that much since it's so distracting? Neverthless, there's a touch of honey malt and it's very clean. Talking about balance is totally out of place though and it didn't seem particularly pleasant. The body is honest, a solid medium body, but not as mouth-filling as other Stones I've had. Basically, this was totally blown away by the Lost Coast Indica we've had just before. Just altogether way too citric sour for my liking, possibly the tartest IPA I've had to date and while it's a characteristic I truly love in many belgians, it didn't seem to fit here. Thanks Martin!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,gotbeer,4.52,"Appearance- Golden, and kind of thick looking. Had a good head, and left almost a perfect lacing on the glass  Smell- Citrus, and hops- very nice   Taste- This is one for the hop heads. Great citrus hops, but balanced well with the malt. Powerful taste. Much better than most IPA's and has more character to boost. A big ale for sure with a huge hop profile.  Mouthfeel- Very heavy hop profile hits the mouth first, but this is balanced fairly well with the malt. Not for the faint of heart, or weak of taste.  Drinkability- High ABV, but it doesn't show in the taste. Great tasting, but be aware of the alcohol content.  Great beer altogether. It may be the best IPA I have ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

This is a great IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gusler,4.64,"Well, as I just received my set of Stone Glassware, one must properly Baptize them, so the India Pale Ale glass gets a Stone IPA.  The beer as it cut and runs from the bottle a transpicuous golden amber color, the head supererogatory, the texture semi-creamy and the color a bright white, as it slowly erodes the lace forms a sticky sheet to smother the glass. Hop floral at the start, the middle sweet malt, citrus crisp, fresh and ever so inviting, a true portent of things to come this nose, start is nicely malted, somewhat sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate.

147,88,Ilacquin,4.12,"First let me say that I am far from being a hophead, and IPAs are not my favored style, but I do like variety.  Appearance started out grand, deep orangish/gold color. A little cloudy with a thin white head that dissipated rather quickly.  Aroma is the first thing you notice upon pouring, even before the head begins to form. Definitely lots of hops here. A little flowery and for lack of a better term ""green"". Reminded me heavily of evergreen trees. Just a little malt sweetness in the aroma to balance things out.  Taste was suprisingly smooth for the amount of hops present. Plenty of hop flavor and bite, with just a slight lingering aftertaste that was not at all unpleasant.  Mouthfeel was suprisingly full, not at all watery or thin.  As I said, this is not my favored style, my tastebuds were a bit burned out on the hops by the time I was finished. Still an outstanding beer though, can't wait to try it again around mid-summer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,smcolw,4.8,"Golden in color, slightly cloudy in clarity, this brew lent itself to an awesome two-finger, cream colored head. The aroma is excellently balanced between the flowery (not bitter) hop and the coy, slightly sweet malt. Interestingly, this beer tasted opposite of most--the hop was up front followed by malt. The beer was balanced throughout the tasting.  This is a full body ale with wonderful carbonation. This may be the best IPA I've ever enjoyed. I am drawn to getting another even though I prefer variety.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RockyTopHeel,4.82,"Tasted at the Pop the Cap Winter Warmer Event, 1/31 at Tyler's.  I take pretty fondly to Stone's brews--that much is apparent. But what should I expect from one of their lesser-hyped, not quite monster brews?  The answer, I found out, is pure excellence.  Stone IPA poured a bold golden color with orange hues and a thin, quickly disappearing white head. The powerful floral aroma is detectable from more than a foot away, as pure hops brilliance dances into my nostrils.  This is a gorgeous beer. It has the perfect balance of hop bitterness, floral hop sweetness, and overall crispness, as well as true depth in an IPA. With every sip, I discovered a new, brilliant element. Simply awesome.  Bar none, this is the best IPA I've ever had. Wow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Smells nice a citrusy on the the pour, and it has a nice follow thouw when you go through it. All in all it has the prolific hop flavor that most Stone products have, and, all in all, it is a very nice brew, Find, and enjoy, it if you can",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jables,4.12,"Poured a light, clear copper colour, with a decent head. A little more clear than what I had expected.  Smells, well like an IPA should, clean and crisp of citric hops.  Taste is strong of citric hops with a lightly sweet malt background continuing throughout.  Mouthfeel I found disturbingly thin, not because it is really thin but because it was thnner than a well built pale ale, and I expect an IPA to have a heavier mouthfeel than an APA.  Overall this is a good, well-built beer, just not as good as expectation and hype. I'd drink again, most definitely, but I won't hold this up as the best IPA I've ever had, it's not.  Special thanks to Bditty for this bottle I got on trade.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,Suds,4.12,"The aroma: Wow.theres some hops in here. Floral, fresh, spicy, mustyshove a hop flower up your nose. Its really something. The hops hit you as soon as you crack open the bottle. Its a very attractive beer: pale golden-orange color, with small bubbles of carbonation throughout. Big white head that quickly settles into lace-producing wisps and rings. Taste is dominant hops. At times its tongue numbingmaybe the slick oiliness of the hops? However, theres an underneath sweetness and malt backbone. Its not what Id call achieving balance, but it adds a nice smoothness to the experience. Just enough to take the edge off the hops. The finish is moderately dry, subtle and floralthis is not an overly bitter beer. Well done. Full, heavy, substantial mouthfeel. Gotta have another",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

147,88,John1985,4.6,Deep golden color with a white fluffy head. Detailed lacing goes down the glass as you enjoy this fabulous ale. Spicy hopped aroma hits your senses like a sledgehammer. The flavor hits the perfect balance between rich malt and bitter hop flavor. The flavor has you by the throat but the funny part is that this is the most drinkable IPA I have EVER tasted.

147,88,waughbrew,4.35,"A light gold color with some haze floats a very impressive, creamy, sticky, retentive head. The aroma makes me giggle like a schoolgirl. Huge grapefruit with noticeable peach and some resiny pine. Flavor is all about the hops. Sure, there is some breadiness, very light caramel flavor, and a certain sugariness, but the hops are clearly the focus. Very fruity in a citrusy way. The bitterness is surprisingly not harsh in any way, rather well balanced. Feel is extremely smooth, a bit creamy, and a hint of slickness. Alcohol is present mostly in its warming sensation. In the end it feels like sugary hops are stuck to your teeth. As with most hoppy beers, I enjoy this beer much more when served rather warm.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93

Tastes of a floral plum currant hoppiness finishing with a bit more maltiness. This is very close to Arrogant Bastard with less taste of alcohol. Very full bodied hitting hardest toward the back of the tongue. more drinkable than the arrogant bastard.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bditty187,3.8,"Gold-copper-bronze hue with amber highlights, there is a slight haze to the color; the off-white head is creamy, about a finger in height. When the head collapsed a bubbly collar developed around the edges, sparser in the middle. As I sipped away, lace was created in good amounts. The nose casts no doubt as to the style of this beer, IPA. Hoppiness reigns supreme, grapefruit flesh up-front, rinds in the middle, flowers at the back, juicy throughout. Good potency. For those who enjoy hops you really want to take a drink, so I do. Hop smacking good palate, upfront it is very lightly floral but that quickly is dispelled but spicy hot hop bitterness with biting alcohol and citrus notes. The palate is plenty raw, a bit too much for my tastes because any attempt at balance is obliterated by the hops. I do realize that balance is not the goal of Stone. It seems to lack a little crafting, Im not complaining; as this is a very tasty beverage but a boatload of hops with little else doesnt really impress me. The hop burps dont let me forget what Im drinking, which is cool. The lack of malt characteristics are depressing, the hoppiness is so strong, so powerful it makes for a one-dimensional beer. The aftertaste is dry and cleansing, typical of many hoppy beers, this one is really well done. Stone IPA is very appetizing and more-ish. The high alcohol induces a pleasant belly warming sensation. All a whole this is very good IPA, plenty bitter, it freaking sticks to your lips(!), Id like to feel a heartier body, this one is hovers around medium, low and perfect carbonation, slightly slick mouthfeel. A solid IPA, it didnt blow me away however. Im glad I tried it.  12-ounce bottle, acquired via trade, thank you francisweizen!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Crosling,4.38,"Stone IPA pours much clearer and lighter than the Stone Pale Ale. Pours a light golden peach with a fine tantalizing white head that just coats the entire glass with sheets of beautiful lacing. Fuck, this is amazing.  Aroma is dry, crisp, spicy and fruity with pancake batter, citrus flavor and peaches. Obvious dry hopping (I hope) with some other tropical scents.  Honey, lemon, wheat grass, grapefruit with a sweet cedarlike finish. This is fantastic! I had never known what wonderful flavors that little hop flower could bring to beer until I tried this. I really enjoyed this!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,pio,4.54,"i usually don't review beer that i know i'd hate and on the other side of the coin, i don't usually review beer that has claimed a little piece in my heart. can you pick a favorite daughter? if you do, keep it to yourself. after reviewing or attempting to review some beer that i was let down by it's come to this. i digress. i like english style pales on the large better but thanks to these brewers i waver more and more. helpful bubbles hold a finely foamed head that is whiter than a very wise man's wisping coiffure. perfect (what is perfect?) orangish color. sheets of lace with ridges from where i took some volume away. a big thick book could be written about the scent of this beer. it'd be filled with adventure, romance, action, science fiction, death and beat ennui. a little something for everyone. evergreen, candy, citrus fruit, cheese, summer lawn, some (hazel) nut and woody tones and rounding out the bottom an astounding barley malt scent. wow! there is just so much to the scent. the flavor is just more bitter than people should be able to handle. a host of flavors. alot of evergreen and citrus, apricot notable. the main player here is the hop profile, it's staggering. i am, too, driven to the poetic. thou hops not a mystery such is the glass key but like a mad man comming to blast me. humulus, humulus are you not of the hemp family? run with me, i can love a bitter woman. sorry. the mouthfeel is right on, awesome. and i have to say i get this very often, so the drinkability in my opinion is very high. thanks for reading my review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,merlin48,4.3,"Clear amber pour with a persistent beige head and sheets of lacing. Aroma of pine and lemon zest. Mouthfeel seems light to medium bodied, with plenty of hops bite. Taste is well mannered, quality hops with grapefruit and lemongrass jumping out of the glass. Well bittered without being offensive, and there is a solid malt background. Finishes crisp and dry, very pleasant aftertaste. If I had any more of these, I could drink them all day. I don't recall a more drinkable IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rkhaze,4.35,"Pours a golden honey color with a bubbly dense off white head. Left sheets of sticky lace. Fresh smelling. Citrusy, almost soapy, clean hop aroma. There was a mild sweet character but not a lot of malt presence. The malts really come through in the flavor. Sweet and grainy with hints of caramel and fruit. Followed of course by the hops. Fresh and resinous with a grapefruit peel bitterness. Tangy mouthfeel with a medium, if not a bit oily, mouthfeel. Alcohol is stashed away rather well making this a very drinkable beer. Good job Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,filabrazilia,3.88,Pours a clear golden with a white head that retains its form throughout. Excellent lacing.  Aroma - Good hop and balance although not as rich as I would prefer.  Taste - Light malt flavor with a hint of grapefruit. A great hop finish that leaves the tongue satisfied.  Mouthfeel - Nice body and depth. Pretty darn full. The hops dance on the tongue and leave their mark after the last sip is taken.  Drinkability - This can be consumed all day long without any problems.  Not as good as the Ruination but a good offering from Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,benmiliron,3.4,"Paid $3.99 for 22 oz. Good smell, good taste, maltyness washed away by the dominating hops. You could drink a lot of this, but I'd spend your money on a cheaper IPA as this isn't anything terribly special. A great brew from Stone, but they've got many other far better beers than this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Stubbie1,4.8,"This beauty from Stone pours a deep orange color. A white head reached the top and left spotty lacing to the end of my beer. The aroma is a mixture of pine and citrus. Neither one overpowering the other, but making a nice mixture of the two. It is a fresh, crisp aroma with a hint of malt in the back ground. The taste is the aroma to a T. A floral rush of hops and a slight hint of malt, then a bitter after taste. A good bitter not a bad one, got to love that dry hopping thing! The hops cover any hint of alcohol in this brew, which makes it very drinkable and enjoyable to boot! Another great product from stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BuckeyeNation,4.65,"Stone IPA is a real looker. Gauzy medium amber with a large, eggshell colored, slightly lumpy head that has good retention and leaves copious rings and sheets of lace.  This is the most amazingly fragrant beer that I've ever smelled; it hit with both barrels as soon as I popped the cap. Its room-filling bouquet even elicited a comment from my wife. The nose is abundantly citrusy, with grapefruit zest leading the charge. So this is what hops smell like!  The flavor is out of this world. Is this what people mean by a 'wow' beer? Grapefruit, lemon and pine, with a tantalizing hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is ultra-smooth and is full and rich without being heavy. Drinkability is superb. Oh how I wish that I had easier access to this amazing IPA.  It was with some trepidation that I popped the cap on this bomber of Stone IPA today. I've been reading on this site about how it's an incredibly hoppy, bitter beer and that beginners (namely me) should tread carefully, perhaps starting with more gentle, less hoppy styles. I think of bitterness as something unpleasant. Well if this is bitterness, give me all you've got.  Far from being unpleasant, this is the best beer of any style that I've had yet. I struggled with whether to assign such high scores since there aren't too many craft beers under my belt at this stage of the game. In the end, though, I have to go with what I feel. I can't imagine that anyone brews a better IPA, or that there are many other beers (of any style) that are better than this. And so.... a hophead is born.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  I'm not going to re-review, but I am going to re-score now that I have quite a bit of IPA experience to reference.

147,88,ithacabaron,4.05,"Poured out a a somewhat hazy butterscotch orange in color, with a quickly rising and falling head. A thin layer of bubbles sticks around, and the high ABV allows this to leave excellent lacing.  The aroma is dried hops (think of smelling dried herbs as opposed to fresh herbs), light pine sap (including the light tar-like smell), and unidentified floral notes.  The mouthfeel is very light for an IPA, but this is not a bad thing. Rather, this makes it rather dry in character, and eminently drinkable (putting a bomber away is not a hard task). Additionally, for a thinner-bodied beer, the alcoholic content is incredibly masked.  Taste is much of the same tarred hops, a bit down and dirty, but with a delicate dried floral finish. Hops are just slightly more aggressive than I think they need be, but this is an IPA, and this is Stone, so, why the helll not?  All in all, very drinkable. I prefer the pure juiciness of HopDevil, but hey, if you give me a bomber of this, I certainly wouldn't say no.  I will certainly purchase this again if and when I see it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mschofield,4.67,"Pours a reddish amber with a thick rocky white head. The head lasts forever, and the lacing rings are thick and full. Citrus and floral aroma The hops hit you in the taste right away taking over from an initial malt flavor, very citrusy a lot of grapefruit, and some pine. The malt never goes away, but you have to look for it. Medium feel, very easy to drink, a little too easy given the ABV - I have drank 6's of this. It is bitter but very smooth.  HopDevil and this are right there with each other, I can't even say which one I like more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Imbiber,4.44,"Pale amber, with a bit of yeast/protein in suspension in this example. Flowery, hoppy aroma; white head which soon dissipates, but not entirely. Very hoppy taste - like an IPA should be - but not astringent on the palate; a nice, clean-drinking, flavoursome brew. Hops linger on the tongue for some time. To sum it up in one word: 'Yummy'!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WaltTrombone,4.3,"Yeah, Baby!!! Another awesome beer from Mr. Koch and the boys!  It poured with a coppery-orange body, and white head. Good staying power, and wispy lace.  The aroma was that grapefruit-y hops, and just a hint of malty sweetness. The first taste has you saying, ""Hey, I thought this was supposed to be one of those hop monsters!?"" About 10 seconds later, those hops sneak up on you, grab hold of your tastebuds and say ""Who's your Daddy?"" The hint of malt is just enough to take the edge of the hops.  The mouthfeel is just right, enough body to slosh around your happy tongue, it's almost creamy, and no trace of oiliness. The finish is citrus and hops, with just a faint cardboard and metallic taste that pops up about 10 minutes after your last swallow.  ""Please, Sir, may I have some more?""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,grynder33,4.32,"Took a long time to get a bottle of this to Wisconsin, but it was worth the wait.Cloudy copperish color, not much of a head, inviting hoppy aroma with a beautiful bittersweet aftertaste. Every swallow you got a new fresh bold taste of hops and eventually a nice bitter film coats your tongue. Wish it were easier to get.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dubblebock,4.25,"Man, this is really one bruiser of an IPA. I remember back in grade school, there was this kid I knew who liked to go around kicking other kids in the shins just for grins....you knew that kid, too...we all did. Well, that's what this beer is like, a good swift smack on the ol' palate. It gets your attention, it leaves you hurting a bit, it may even stick around after dinner and insult your taste in books and music, but it sure as hell livens up the day.  It poured a wonderfully cloudy orangeish-amber color. The massive head was a wonder to behold. It didn't overwhelm me with it's nose, and I found that to be surprising. I expected to be bowled over, but instead it merely hinted at the taste to come.  It tasted sweet at first, but that was only a malty ruse. The real kick hit me when the hops took over. Hard to understate how hoppy this beer is, and this is only Stone's entry-level IPA. Citrus and other fruit flavors mixed to leave my tastebuds stunned. It hit my throat with a real bitter twang. I had to stare at it for a minute or two after I had the first swallow. It was just like when that kid kicked me in the shins....I was a little shocked at first, a little amazed that someone would have the nads to come up out of the blue and do something like that. But you know, after I chased that kid down and kicked him back, it was all cool. We were pals. We had bonded. That's how this beer was for me.  Good mouthfeel. Not overwhelmingly thick or anything. Very drinkable for a beer this big, but I wouldn't recommend slamming back too many of these in one sitting. One bomber on a Sunday afternoon was enough for me, but I think I'll chase this guy down again one day for another kick in the tastebuds.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DarthMalt,4.02,"Have I reviewed this one yet?....NO! Have I drank multiple cases of it?...YESSSS!!!  Ahhh! But where do these hops come from, which so beautifully meld with the succulent, honey malts? North County, San Diego, apparently. So pefectly cogniscent of the American gourmand palette these days, this nasty, emasculated gargoyle commands a great deal of respect from both beer belly and wine connessiuer alike.  The perfumy nose, along with strong alcohol wafts of fermentation, ensure all potential imbibers that satisfaction is at hand. Crisp, yet secluded, carbonation gives yield to a honey-sweet foretaste, before rich, sappy hops jump out and start tugging at the dextrine jugular.  A bit rich at the end (like a high-powered, chocolate torte, after a seven-course meal), but then again, what did you expect?  Gourmet beer has a name.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,byrd,4.43,"Medium sized off white head with a yellowish hue. Tons and tons of carbonation streaming like mad from the bottom of the glass. Small frothy bubbles form a sticky head which holds onto the sides of the glass all the way to the last drop. The head remains for a very long time, and eventually recedes to a thick lace. Some particles (hops?) can be seen settled on the bottom of the glass. The aroma is citric with considerable juicy grapefruit notes and a subtle backing of malts. Stone IPA is wonderfully smooth from start to finish. The malt backbone is ever-present despite the tendency for this brew to lean towards the direction of the hops. The hops are always well in hand and are never overbearing. Theres a slight bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a finely carbonated mouthfeel. Great IPA that is incredibly drinkable. I could drink this one all evening.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HonestWeightBeer,3.82,"Poured a bright, clear tawny gold with a fluffy white head and some sticky lace. The smell is big and strong floral hops. Taste is malt with a strong hop presence, citric and alcoholic notes.. The bitterness is just right, crisp bitter bite. Mouth is medium and round, smooth but also sticky on the palate, flurry on swirling in the mouth, medium to well carbonated. On the strong side for an IPA, but that is to be exected from this brewery. Holds yur palate hostage. Good and well done, but you wouldn't see me drink a sixer of this, not exactly a session beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,LiamStLiam,4.2,"Poured from a 22-ounce bomber.  Pours a wonderful orange with a half-inch white head, and leaves tendrils of white down the glass as you drink. Cloudy and hard to see through.  Very sweet at first and loaded with hops.  An extremely intense beer and one you really have to pay attention .  The hops grab your tongue and pull it out. Long finish without much of the metallic taste.  Yes, it's as good as folks say.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tavernjef,3.85,"Color is a lighter shade of pale yellow, some hazy cloudyness with a finger high white head of looser thickness, fades and bubbles down to some bubbles along the rim. Lace in webby loose sheets. Smell is quite floral and sweetly hopped lending light pine, light grapefruit and a touch spicy. Not all that strong but very fresh and hoppy. Swirling brings out some soft caramel malts and alcoholic warmth. Taste is a calming smooth, subtle hoppy little treat. Solid floral and dried sense of hops with a good touch of pine and grapefruit mixing with peach notes. Nice light backing of soft caramel malts; a bit of toasted bread. Well balanced and the bitterness is well under check with nice lingering spicy dried grapefruit notions in the finish. Lightly creamy and a fair medium body feel with a crisp, clean subtle hoppy finish. Maybe expecting to much from this beer with all the high recommendations. Its a solid IPA for sure, but didn't quite make the impact on me with more of a mellower hop flavor then I was anticipating. Comparisons aside, this was very close to Town Hall's Columbus Pale. So as an IPA this was more like a great pale.  Thanks to Gusler for the Bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beerguy101,4.26,"Light straw color, small white foamy head. Aroma is spicy and fruity.A very hoppy beer, dry and crisp. Distinctive hop aroma. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are bitter and spciy. Beer is ""dry hopped"" for 2 weeks. A 60 IBU beer. Finish is clean and crisp. A nice bitter IPA. Good beer, etched beer bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,rastaman,3.2,"Huge lychee, grapefruit and pine aroma, hops are very aromatic and sharp. Some nice sweetish malts quickly have the shit beaten out of them by a huge hop attack. The hops would have been delightful, if they'd used them in moderation. A lot of alcohol in the finish aswell. I mean its got a lot of flavour and all, but i just couldn't helped but be bored by the hops, overkill in this case made me- not disgusted, horrified or shocked- but bored, and that really surprised me. I was really dissapointed with how uncomplex it was.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Gavage,4.59,"Finally got my hands on two bottles, and my expectations were high. It poured a nice golden orange color with a 1/2"" head. The head slowly disappeared to thin trails on top of the beer. The aroma was phenominal - strong floral with a sweetness that left me inhaling a few times before the first taste. The taste brought immediate bitterness that mellowed to a slightly bitter and sweet malt on the tongue. This lasted for a good minute or so. The hop and malt balance is perfect, even though both are bold. Being a regular Hop Devil drinker, this IPA is in an elite league.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ManekiNeko,4.7,"Served chilled in a pint glass. 22 oz. bomber.  Appearance: Clear golden yellow topped off with a modest frothy white head. Little to no retention, just a smallish crown on this king of IPA's. Nice lacing as I greedily consumed this ambrosia.  Smell: Largely piney hops with herbal hoppiness lingering in the backround. Citrus aromas are also prominent, largely grapefruit. INTENSE. Can be smelt from across the room, I bet... I didn't try this as I did not want to be parted from my glass that long.  Taste: I never thought I'd say this, but hoppy citrus sweetness, almost kinda grapefruit and orange-like. Then the bitterness kicks in. No hint of alcohol at all. I'm very impressed by the subtle flavors, despite this being somewhat of a hop monster.  Mouthfeel: Lightly creamy, lingering hop aftertastes, but it does not overstay it's welcome.  Drinkability: Hell yeah! And I'm not much of a hophead. Definite regular purchase. I hope the 12 oz. are this good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ElGuapo,4,"A hazy golden colored brew with a swirling cloud sitting just below the thick white head on top. It has a great nose of grassy bitterness. Hops are just bombarding me.  The initial flavor is not as hoppy as I would expect from the aroma, but wait, there it is. The bitterness starts to come in from the edges of my tongue. It has a great hoppy bite to it. Crisp, and very flavorful. Body is medium, and it is not missing anything in that department. Just a well-rounded IPA. Why can't I get more Stone in Jersey!?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HardTarget,4.57,"Aroma: You&#8217;ve just stepped into a hop factory. Cascade? Not sure, but fresh hops, with subtle hints of hops with hop overtones. Deep in the smell, there is a hint of malt that is quickly hit over the head with hops and told to stay down. Appearance: Well&#8230; pale. Light straw color that issued a sad little head, but left a ring of suds that impressed me with a light lace/tide marks for being so small. The second pour from the bomber I got more aggressive with the pour, and gained a fluffy white head, but clung to the side with lace and quickly died, and left the beer noticeably flatter. The head on the third (half glass) pour showed very large bubbles. Flavor: Hoppy, but not bitter. Mouthfeel: Silky. It doesn&#8217;t feel like a pale ale, closer to a bock in mouthfeel, but oh, so smooth. Liquid jello? It practically races down your throat. Overall Impression: I got this because I&#8217;ve learned to respect Stone Brewery, and it ranked so highly on the &#8220;Top Beers&#8221; list. It took me a while to get past HOPPY, but I started to understand that this beer, with hops, hops, and more hops, wasn&#8217;t screwing my face into a, forgive me &#8220;bitter beer face&#8221;. The balance allows the entire hop flavor to come through, but backs it with enough malt to leave no edge at all. The smooth finish encourages another drink, and another, so drinkability is only slowed by the sizable alcoholic kick that creeps up on you. This is a liquid celebration of the noble hop. If this is what British soldiers got while serving in India, I think I&#8217;d sign up. While not for the faint of heart, this is a must-taste for any hop head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mustard,4.09,"Presentation: 12oz. brown bottle; no ""bottled on"" or ""best before"" warning; purchased as a stray single for $1.39 from the West LA Whole Foods on National and Barrington.  Appearance: Pours a fairly clear, orange-tinged gold; fine, bone-white, half-inch head; sticky lacing; decent head retention.  Aroma: Largely of grapefruit, pine and sweet caramel malts.  Taste: Thick, toasted, caramel malts upfront; heavy, aggressive bitterness in the finish; strong notes of a) grapefruit and b) pine; medium bodied with a creamy, crisp mouthfeel.  Notes: Big, delicious IPA; everything you'd expect of a Stone IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,alexgash,4.39,"I'm getting the idea that Stone may be a good brewery. Another excellent, intense beer from those bastards. This one has an golden orange body with a medium-sized white head. Smell is ridiculously potent. I like. Strong candy toffee malts with an equally strong hoppy background. Taste is good. Malts up front, but not as sweet and toffeeish as the smell implies, with a sharp acidic hop bitterness carrying through to the finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,brakspear,4.72,"An excellent Westcoast IPA. Potent, hoppy, but extremely drinkable.  The body is clear and slightly amber with a fantastic bone-white head that laces well.  The aroma is an explosion of hops, citrusy but still tamed by a sweet malty nose hidden in the background -- beautiful.  The flavor is smooth and well-balanced, from the aroma I expected to be blasted with hop bitterness, but the generous malt background makes this IPA smooth and delicious with a perfect hot bite.  The body is generous making this beer surprising creamy on the palate, but not cloying. This IPA was so drinkable that I kick myself for not bringing another bottle back with me from my trip to the Westcoast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,elmocoso,4.8,"I don't know if it was just happened to be the context of last night, but this beer was nearly perfect. A beautiful brownish gold with and off-white head, consisting of loose, bulbous bubbles.  The aroma was exelent, too. A great blend of hops and malt and floral and citrus. It literaly made my mouth water.  Then the taste. Man, the sweetness of the malt enveloped the tongue, and then a blanket of bitterness charmed its way into all the corners of my mouth. The carb level was perfect and the whole experience was one I will difinitly repeat.  Drink. Enjoy. Repeat. This should be on every bottle.  Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RoyalT,4.73,"Appearance  Gorgeous, cloudy bright orange body with a monster head that kept well and laced the glass.  Smell  Strong hop aroma, announcing the seriousness of this brew. Theres a terrific mix of floral and citrus hop scents, giving this ale a wonderful bouquet.  Taste  Deep, passionate, hop flavor is the trademark of this one. The floral hops kick in a little more at the taste, but this is an exceptionally balanced ale. Theres also a good malt balance in this one. Amazing!  Mouthfeel  Light carbonation in accordance with the style.  Drinkability  This one went down smooth as silk. This is quality at its finest. Another excellent offering from Stone.  Update  This is a staple in my house, so I decided to revisit my review in 04. It really is an excellent ale. I was trying to figure out what kept me from 5ing this one. I think its the lack of a good, strong, lingering finish. The flavors just seem to drop off the table. Otherwise this IPA is perfect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Boto,4.47,"The beer pours a darker golden color. White head, but not too much of it. There is a nice citrus-pine/hop nose. Hops are fairly evident in the taste, but not as up front as some of their other brews. I was expecting more hops than I could handle, but even though they are strong, the balance is excellent. It has a crisp finish. A fine quaff!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Nytemare,4.18,"Appearance: Poured a nice golden yellow with a hint of orange. A little hazy, but it seemed to clear up as it went along. Nice 1"" head, white, that lasted quite a while. After it dissappated, all I had to do was swirl the glass slightly and it was back. Nice lacing down the side of the glass as well.  Smell: Hops hops and more hops. Overwhelmingly hoppy in the smell. Maybe some citrus and a mild malt profile, but thin compared to the hops.  Taste: Much more balanced than I expected from the smell. There is definately an overwhelming amount of hops, but a nice grassy malt flavor blends in nicely from behind. Smoother than I expected as well. Bitter, but that's what you'd expect. It's a beer that bites you back. The malt charactoristics really show in the aftertaste, but even there, you can taste the hops, and it lingers forever. I'm sitting here savoring the aftertaste and I finished it about 5 minutes ago. Yummy. Lots of flavor there, just hard to define.  Mouthfeel: Crisp. Very crisp. Not too thin, but not overwhelmingly thick or oily. Nice and clean.  Drinkability: Started out rather nice, but by the end of the bottle, it was getting a little hard to continue. Not that it's bad, but the bitterness really is strong as it starts to warm up. I spent a good 45 minutes drinking this. Just sipping it and enjoying the silence of children in bed and the wife at the gem. Me and sportscenter and Stone I.P.A. Not bad.  Props to a Jeremy, a friend of mine, for meeting me at the lake with this, Arrogant Bastard, 1554 Black Ale, and Porch Swing (reviews pending). I can't get any of them in Oklahoma, so I have to rely on other methods. Also, he just gave them to me. Gotta love free beer. This one, bitter, full of hops, but balanced. Could definately drink again, and will, but it's not something I could drink tons of in one sitting. One is enough for one night. Overall, impressed, especially since this is my first Stone brew to try, looking forward to cracking open that Arrogant Bastard this weekend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,tar,4.35,"I'd been looking forward to trying this beer for some time and was not disappointed. From the attractive painted bottle pours a nice semi-transparent light orange colored beer. A fairly thick (1 finger) foamy head tops off the beer and leaves some lacing on the glass throughout consumption. A fairly strong and pleasant aroma of hops is present and makes itself known during the pour. A very nice hoppy, fruity (citrus) taste, slightly milder than expected from the aroma, greets the mouth. Very smooth with a bit of an oily feel in the mouth. Overall this is a very good beer and certainly one I look forward to having again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hungryghost,4.24,"Had this at a bbq so could not tell appearance through brown bottle. Pleasant hoppiness, hint of pine in the aroma. The flavor is crisp, hoppy fresh and the word bright comes to mind. Not too sweet. A bright bitterness. This is a good thing. Overall a fantastic IPA. The full hop flavor is right on but does not deaden the tastebuds. Likely to wake your mouth right up. I would like to try this on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,CharlesRiver,4.47,"Had this on tap at Redbones after I had a Summer IPA. Poured a cloudy tan-orange color with minimal head that left a perfect lace. Hoppy, citrus sweet smell that was very inviting. The first thing that I noticed about this beer was it's balance. Sweet, malt, hops and citrus were all perfectly blended. Each flavor came to the front when it needed to. Extremely drinkable as I could have had many more. A great beer from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ChappyCubsFan,4.15,"A crisp hop bitterness with top notch malt gives this IPA an excellent finish. When I'm at the Stone tasting room, this is always the best staple brew going, although everything is excellent. This is the benchmark for a good, hoppy and robust California IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Rumrunner,4.15,"Pint glass  Pours a nice orange amber. Cloudy with a nice white head to start. Head disappears quickly. Pretty good lacing. It was hard to get the scents going. At first whiff it was very bland. The smell is hoppy and fruity with some pine and weak malts in the back ground.  Many flavors going on here. Very nicely done. A great hop bitterness. Fruit esters dominate this IPA. There is some bread and a slight malt interference for the background which give this IPA a nice smooth finish. Pine is also a heavy flavor and it gives this IPA a nice crispness.  The mouthfeel is very crisp and dry. This IPA goes down well with food, on a hot day or anytime you think it is drinking time. This IPA has great flavors and great drinkability. Very well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,blkknight02,3.85,"If you are a hophead this beer is for you - I'm not a hophead. With that out of the way: The color was deep amber. Very clear and high level of carbonation. The off-white head persisted throughout the pint. The aroma was pine, pine, and more pine. It's gotta be the chinooks! The flavor is the same as the aroma - resiny pine. It left a bitter taste on my tongue that reminded me of the old Foghorn Leghorn cartoons where he painted the dogs tongue with green paint. Way too bitter for me but then again most of Stones brews are. I', glad I only bought one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,DESTRO,3.93,"pours a wonderfull deep amber yellow with a nice little white head. smells like hops (duh) and more hops. piney and mouthwatering. and wow it tastes like hopes too. im still getting into the whole big ipa brews, but to me this has alot of ""oomph"" in the hop area. floral and piney with a dash of malt character. the mouthfeel is smooth and goes down nicely and makes for a delightful drinking experiance. this stuff is way good, but after a couple, its time for me to move on.  $2.99 a bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Boilermaker88,4.52,"Re-reviewed from first review dated 07-28-03. Previous marks were 4.0/3.0/2.5/4.0/3.0 respectively. Okay, I feel the conversion is now complete. I've just polished off one of what is now a staple in my fridge and feel this brew rates a re-review. Stone's IPA has a certain malty sweetness in the nose and also across the palate and this makes for a wonderfully citrus rind-drenched delight. Some pine flavor but now not as much as picked up initially - more hearty grapefruit peel with some floral notes. When all is said and done, the hops are laid down liberally on the tongue, slathering it, yet making the taste buds clamor for more. What can I say; I'm hooked.  07-28-03 review: Appearance: from a 12oz brown bottle, this IPA poured a clear dark golden color. Nice creamy head and lots of streams of bubbles. Good lacing also. Smell: citrus and pine woods aroma dominate. Strong indicator of things to come. Taste: faint malt flavor immmediately overpowered by citrus and pine tastes. Totally unbalanced in favor of hops, the bitter taste builds through to the finish and leaves a strong piney bitterness on the tongue. Feel: medium-bodied, smooth, dry feel. Drinkability: I tried to be as objective as I could with this and it does have its merits. However, the over-the-top hopiness just doesn't work for me. I was still tasting it two hours later so I didn't need to drink another. I'm at a stage where I like a more balanced beer so I don't plan on getting this one again anytime soon. If you're into hops, though, this beer's for you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jlervine,4.78,"Wow. Honey colored, thick creamy white, effervescent bubbling. Smell? Wow. Sweet malt hidden beneath a comfortable thick blanket of hops. The taste is malty with a nice heavy hop finish. Mouthfeel is sweet but not cloying, and pleasantly hoppy without being bitter. Very drinkable, very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mapman97,4.15,"I tried one of these this weekend after a long day out in the hot Texas sun fishing. Maybe I should wait until the next time I try one to give a review since any beer would taste good after several hours baking on a lake in Texas in July. Having said that I must say that from the fist sip to the last gulp this beer was wonderful.  The first sip was very hoppy, bitter but refreshing. After a couple more swallows I could detect some malty sweetness and the bitter had subsided to a wonderful warm feel.  The mouthfeel was nice with the tingles of carbonation and the tounge awakening hops. By the time I got to the last third of the bottle I had nothing but enjoyment from the carbonated lively mouthfeel and the malty sweetness off set nicely by the familiar crisp hops of an IPA. Good Beer!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PatandDavid,4.12,"What I have found with Stone is that they are very un-even on tap, at least where I am most likely to drink them in Massachusetts.  Sometimes they are malty, sometimes hoppy, sometimes a good balance.  Anyway, this had a nice orangey color, and the aroma was nice and hoppy, very pleasant and fresh.  There was some sweet malt undertone, but basically this was all hops. It was a bit bitter at the start, but as it warmed up became very pleasant. Very nice carbonation added to the mouthfeel.  Got a good one this evening. Always a brewery to check out and see what the beers are up to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,StevieW,4.7,"22 oz bomber while watching July 4 fireworks. I saved this one for a special occasion and it was worth it. What can I say that hasn't already been perfectly described. Hazy deep rusty amber color. Dense thick white head, full of hop bubbles so soft, it would be the perfect resting place for a butterfly with sore feet. Aromas of thick citrus, fresh whole hops, and smooth toasted malt. Taste is the perfection of the style, IMO. Striking hop bitterness, the corner of the inside of my mouth cringe, then bitterness lingers on the tongue. Riding along the whole time is a super mellow toasted malt backbone. Full bodied, flavors never waver. Medium bodied and holds together to the end. The perfect beer to match with any grilled food, IMO. Hop bitterness cuts through everything, leaves a dry snap finish, and your tastebuds aching for more. Brought this one back from a tiny gourmet grocery store, just down the street from the T-line in Cambridge, MA. The only beer they stocked was Stone and Concord Raspcallion. Does Todd do the ordering for this place ?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,GreatPondBrewer,4.67,"22 oz bomber Damn near perfect. I will never deny my love for hops and Stone has plenty of them! Reverse cascaded into a hazy golden much like a midsummer sunset with bubbly white head and plenty of tiny bubble lace. The smell was tart and bursting with Chinook hops, honey and a faint toasted malt. But the smell was dominated by hops. The taste was the same. Huge waves of grapefruit hop bitterness rolled on the shores of my mouth leaving my taste buds in utter shock there was very little aftertaste as the nectar flowed dwn my gullet. The mouthfeel was thinly carbonated and syrupy, more to my likeing. This stands as one of the better IPAs I have had, and that is not just because this is Stone, but because it is damn near the definition of a west coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,SheepNutz,4.25,"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a clear orange-amber color with 2 fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich floral hops, maybe chinook, with some citrus. The taste is very well balanced, with sweet malt up against fruity hops. The hops are not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is fairly nice, just a little carbonated. The drinkability is extremely good. This must be Ruination's little brother.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bigbelcher,4.7,An outstanding American IPA. Lots of hop flavor and good bitterness. Stone doesn't use the Cascade hops like many American IPA's use. Not sure what they use but it gives it a unique taste. If you are a hophead you will love this beer. Also available in bottles but draft is outstanding. Strong but not overdone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,stegmakk,4.5,Poured a nice deep copper with off white head...a good head retention and nice lacing made this an attractive beer Aroma was mostly piney hops (big hop flavor overall)... Taste was very hoppy from start to finish...pine earthy were bigger flavors ending bitter yet crisp...kind of oily/butter hint of flavor and texture as well... I didnt find much malt...but there might have been some in there to mix the flavors together...there was a touch of sweetness to it to so I think this is where the malt poked through... This now ranks as 1 or 2 on my IPA list...mmmm...good stuff,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,aaronh,4.95,"Pours a hazy orange-amber with an off white head. Good head retention for an IPA. The head fades to a thin film of foam on the surface of the beer. This is usually a good indicator of a malty beer. The aroma may be the sweetest floral smells I've ever experienced in a beer. I have a fragrant rose in my garden called ""Seattle Scentsation"". It may be the best rose aroma I've ever experienced. This beer reminds me of that scent. Wow!  The hop florals carry over into the taste as well. Very bitter, very good. And there is a substantial malt base to support all the hops. A hint of sweetness slides in the finsh, possibly caramel notes. Also a bit of ale ""fruitiness"", which I only noticed later in the glass. But the hops just blow me away. I'll revisit this beer at a later date when I'm slightly less in awe.  The mouthfeel is also very full for an IPA. The beer seems to expand to fill your mouth, and gets silkier the longer it's on your tongue. Mmmmmm, goooood. It finishes rather cleanly, with a good hop kick to cleanse the palate.  6.9% ABV? You have got to be kidding me! I could tatste no alcohol notes, and could drink this beer for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and supper and still want a few that evening.  I can't believe I waited a couple of weeks to try this beer after I bought it. I'm buying more on my next beer run. This beer could temper my desire to try new beers somewhat. It is one of the best I've ever experienced flavor-wise, and is very drinkable. Not just a hop-head's IPA. It's a beer lover's IPA. Dare I say it's my new IPA? It will be when I can get it.  ** 7-8-03** This beer is still awe inspiring. One of my favorties. Greg is a Beer God**",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,chilidog,4.5,"I agree with most of these reviews, Wow!! I think this is the best IPA i've had to date. Im not one to seek out this style just for the hops and abv. I found this to be so well balanced and easy to drink, I beleave I found my new home stocker of this style. It pours a cloudy orange amber with a one & half inch white head. Lace is very good and sticks all glass long. The taste is hoppy yes, but not over bitter, but rather smooth. Stone takes thier time in the brewing process, and it shows. From the first aroma of floral citrus hop to the mouth that is left alittle tart, but not dry. Wow, a very drinkable IPA to be had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AaronRed,4.38,"Nice golden color upon pouring this beer- the creamy white head has tight little bubbles that stay untilt the last drop. A clear hop aroma emerges as soon as I poured it. A nice strong bitter punch hits you as first, just to let you know there is an abundance of hops here. Citrus like flavors are balanced well with a slightly sweet malt and candy like flavors- but only for a moment. This beer is all about hops, but it backs off just enough to make this a great beer to drink anytime. Goes extremely well with spicey foods.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,FranklinPCombs,4.47,"The Stone IPA pours with a vibrant orange color, which is slightly clouded in appearance. the thick foamy white head leaves a thick, clinging lace around the glass. The first smell immediately presents a sharp hoppy scent surrounded by soy and citrus rind, with an underpinning of apples, pine and malt. The mouthfeel is smooth, although contrasted by the play of carbonation on the middle of the tongue. The taste is subtle, while not at all lacking. Starting with a fruity maltness, it builds to a hoppy bitter within about 5 seconds, with some citrus hints lingering. It blends to a bitter hoppy aftertaste which makes one want to eat something salty, which of course makes you want to drink more. This, of course, is always good. I put this ale high on my list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,usualpulp,4.6,"WoW. This is one amazing beer. I had been waiting for a while for more Stone brews to come to Texas, and got very excited when I saw the IPA at the store, sadly there was only one bottle left. The beer pours a nice golden color with a white foamy head. The beer is very bubbly and makes it quite nice to look at after it is poured. The smell of the beer is great, very very hoppy, with a fruit smell, possibly grapefruit. With the first taste the hops hit you like a hammer, then the fruit kicks in, all of the flavors meld terrific.The beer is dry yet wet at the same time, making this one great beer for hot weather. This goes on my list as one of my top beers. Hopefully more Stone brews become available here soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TXHops,4.53,"ABV: 6.9%  MmmStone IPA This was the first non-Arrogant Bastard Stone beer I tried. I bought a boat load of Stone on a trip to Arizona, and drank the IPA first for two reasonsI expected it to pale in comparison with the likes of Old Gaurdian and Ruination and because at the time (March 2003) it was due to be available in Texas within days. Well, its mid-June and IPA is finally here! Anyway, Im sorry I so under-estimated this beer, because it might just be my favorite Stone. The brilliant, clear gold body sports a stylishly-contrasted white, creamy head and a massive aroma of fruity PacNW hops OTHER than Cascades. The nose isnt one-dimensional either, just like the beer itself. Under the fresh, floral, green hoppiness is a touch of earthy maltiness and a soft, fruity sweetness. The flavor is identical, with the bitterness being far from assertive, allowing the hops to be flavorful, not astringent. The pale maltiness shows even more of the fruitiness in the flavor than it did in the nose. The velvety smooth fruitiness glides effortlessly past the initial hop smack and doesnt end until a touch of alcoholic warmth reminds me that this is almost 7% ABV. How a beer thats this hoppy can maintain this kind of balance and still be as quintessential an example of an American IPA as Ive tried, I honestly dont know. Masterful brewing, simply masterful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kindestcut,3.85,"The Stone IPA pours a clear gold, bordering on orange-yellow. The white head is small but leaves a visible lace as the glass is drained. This is a very bright beer.  The aroma is extremely hoppy and spicy. I can tell by the aroma (and the Stone name coincidentally) that this is a hoppy brew. Upon forst taste, I am amazed that the hoppiness is not more intense. Now, come on, I didn't mean that this is not an intensely hoppy beer. It is. I'm just surprised that the over-the-top Stone has brewed an IPA here that is rather well balanced, although very heavy on the hops.  I can taste a malt foundation with a tremendous hoppy body. The floral-citrus bitterness dominates to be sure, but there is far more flavor than you'd think. Although I am not a huge fan of overly hoppy beers, I believe I could have more than one of these. An amazing thing that I never would have guessed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,longpondbeerman,4.3,"I had to wait a while to get my hands on this ale; then, lo and behold, I go into Half Time Beverages in Poughkeepsie, NY (see beerfly reviews--this place is awesome!) and not only can I pick up bottles of this, it's also on tap. So I get a six-pack and a growler--I mean why not? Right now, I'm reviewing the bottled one, though they're not too different (a better mouthfeel from the tap, I think). Anyway, this pours a medium gold with a noticeable off-white head that left a modest intricate lace. The smell was complex--hops for sure, but balanced by just the slightest citrus and some sweetness, but I could not figure out from what. I was intrigued. The first taste was brash, good and powerful hops, but it mellowed quickly, too quickly even, as the finish I thought was nondescript. Nevertheless this has a pleasant, light mouthfeel (on tap there seemed to be just a bit more body). Very drinkable for an ale with such high alcohol content, so be cautious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WanderingFool,4.55,"Being a big fan of both IPA's and Stone I was psyched when I found a bottle of their IPA. It pours a slightly hazy golden blond color with a thin white head that faded to a ring around the beer. The aroma is mainly citrus, but I detect some toasted malts there as well. Each sip is packed with flavor. Toasted malts, citrus and a hoppy bitterness complete each sip. A slightly sticky palate and linger hoppy flavors remain behind.  This beer is very drinkable and hides it's 7% abv very well. I can't wait to get another bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beergeek279,4.77,"Served as a sample at the Penn Festival. The beer poured a golden blonde. The smell was of hops and more hops. The taste was very hoppy.........just about the perfect amount of bitterness. The mouthfeel was quite smooth. The drinkability was about as good as possible.........zero alcohol for almost 7%, and great sessionability.  Stone keeps making great beers, and next to the Bastard, this is probably my favorite of the beers they've made. Stone has created one of the truly great American IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Stingray5,4.03,"Pours a golden orange with a big white head that lasts and lasts. Beautiful spicy, floral aromas with hints of pine and grapefruit. Taste is all hops but with some nice, sweet malt undertones. Very earthy.  My second Stone experience, the IPA is a different beast than the Bastard, but just as respectable. I've been spoiled, and it's going to be tough to go back!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OatmattStout,4.37,"Hop head heaven. This beer had more hop flavors than any other IPA I have tasted. To start it poored a nice deep amber coloer and had a nice rich head. From the first sip you get a srucy, and piney and bitter hop taste. Oh yeah there is substantial malt backbone here to even off. This beer for me not being a true hop head yet but enjoying more and more powerful IPA's, started off bitter but by the end i thought it was great and was sad to see the bottle empty. I will have this one again when I can get it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,powoo19,4.03,"Tried at AOBF...Certainly different from arrogant bastard ale, but very nice. The light almost peach color is inviting and the head is nice thick white and lasting. The smell is a very fruity/citrus smell. The taste is smooth, with a hoppy ( though not overpowering) and malty taste. Again , goes down smooth and does an IPA justice. Happy Drinking!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kmo1030,4.42,"This is a great beer. I am new to stone brewing company ( i got my first 6 pack yesterday), but this beer was impressive. it is a hazy light orange color with a substantial not quite white head. the smell is awesome, something like citrusy freshly cut grass. the taste had a slight carmel nut malt flavor, that balances more than it first seems. hops dominate the middle and end coating your mouth with a big resinous spicy grapefruit flavor. Medium bodied, with a drinkabilty that, in my opinon is very high. i noticed it was very smooth for a bottled beer. a very, very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jeffboo,4.26,"It's hop time. This hop monster looks great in a pint glass, and I'm glad that the bottle will top it off for a little while longer, I love the looks of this one: very orange in color with big,puffy foamy top that sticks around for the ride. The bouquet is citrus and flowers, many different kinds, with a good amount of malt in the backround. The flavor follows the nose's lead with a good dose of malt balanced nicely with a floral,citrus hop flavor. A very complex hoppiness about it, the malt could use a bit of complexity, but hey , that's what the Arrogant is about. The texture is nectar-like, which I love but may be thick and chewy for some. A great beer for the hop fix!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,oberon,4.17,"Poured a really nice peach color with small but rocky head that stuck to the glass,wow the smell,first whiff is freshly mowed grass it hits ur nasal passages like a freight train.Very citruisy taste hits u first but the maltiness in the background really balances this out nicely.Iam sometimes leery about getting west coast IPA's but this one is nicely balanced.Stone has to be a world renown brewery by now their beers are just so world class.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jcalabre,4.72,"This is another world class beer from Stone. Take it out of the fridge, let it sit on the counter for ten minutes or so before opening it, then lavish yourself in the beautiful floral aroma of hops. It's readily available in six packs in my area, so I'm spoiled. It has the hoppy, citrusy flavors one would expect from a west coast IPA. I've used this beer on four occassions to introduce a BMC type to real beer. Each time was successful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,feloniousmonk,4.42,"The grim, growling gargoyle glares at you from the label, both offering protection from all things bland and dire, and also daring those not ready to indulge in a torrent of flavor to begone, and be untroubled by these blissful beers. Appearance: a perfect, peachy hue, and a good, frothy white head. Nose: somethin' else! A panoply of fruit, a citric cornucopia! Peaches and apricot, grapefruit, pineapple, melon, berries, and more, all in one little aroma! Alert and lively, zesty, generous, and gorgeous! Taste: superb! Fantastic flavor, yet none too bitter. A huge blast of hops jumps on the tongue, but not so severely. A firm body, also, excellent balance and malt backbone. More of a piney feel comes through as we drink, but it's a minor note among so many others. Finish is medium, but tasty and satisfactory. This is an IPA the way they are supposed to be! If these excellent ales were available in my area, you can be sure that my fridge would be stocked well with these! Tasty, and drinkable, and rewarding!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dwarbi,3.98,"Pours a creamy, white head, that's uneven and thick and provides excellent lacing. The beer itself is a nice golden color. The aroma is strongly hoppy, and it tastes much the same. The mouthfeel is a little odd: somwhat cakey and off. It stils feels good on the palate, and is very drinkable. This is a very strong and imposing beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Reidrover,4.53,"Bought in the ubiquitous 22 oz brown bomber..with as always the imformative back panel. Ok this is simply a marvelous IPA to just look at..a work of art it seems a shame to have to drink it! Hazy light amber colour with a fantatsic large creamy white head..even the carbonation strings seem perfect! Well the aroma of the hops is also great..its a treat to the nasal passages, quite flowery but yet not sweet smelling. well what can is ay about the taste but hops, hops,hops yet it alo has a creamy sweetness..that isnt completelly over whelmed by the hops ( this must be a Stone thing, I tasted the same in the 03-03-03 Vertical)..very nice. Great feel in the mouth with just the right amount of hop aftertatse to keep one coming back for another sip. Most drinkable IPA I ever had..very good indeed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TPoling,4.57,"Imagine walking through a field of flowers. See the cool colors amid the green. Take in the fresh scents. Now drink it. That is the essence of Stone IPA.  This India pale ale from Stone Brewing Co. is the second of the company's well-respected beer line to make it into Texas. It follows the strong and malty Arrogant Bastard Ale, which endears itself to drinkers by declaring the prospective drinker is not worthy to drink it and probably won't like it.  Stone IPA is a little less heavy on the malt and leaves a crispness that lets the Chinook and Cascade hops shine through. This would stand up great to Mexican food, with the hops cutting through the heat of the chile and is refreshing enough not to add to the heaviness of the abundance of melted cheese, meat and lard-laden refritos. The bad news is they probably don't sell this in the same places you can buy a No. 2 dinner.  The first time I opened this beer -- with great expectations of taste -- it took a full five minutes before it passed my lips because the scent was so intoxicating. Even my wife, who does not drink alcohol, was pleased with the nose. Car air fresheners could be right around the corner.  If I could afford a case of this stuff at $3.79 a bottle, this would be my summer drink of choice and share a special place of honor next to the assortment of hefe weizens that crowd the beerarator when the thermostat gets over 90, usually beginning in March.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BierReise,3.83,"Nice IPA but with the high ratings over this one I expected something more than exceptional. Has a nice marriage of malt/hop flavor and only a slight bitterness compared to most other IPA's I've had over the years. I still think the Alesmith beats this one though. I will definately drink it again, but there are many just as good as this one and better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,scottum,4.23,"Pours out a beautiful amber with a nice white head. I don't like this quite as much as ruination, but it is still an awesome ipa!

A nice big stone IPA for all of us!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,MJR,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a pale copper with faint gold edges. Good clarity. The head is a sticky, thin cap that leaves lots of lace on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is raw and pungent with hops leaping out of the glass. Pine, grapefruit rind, and a touch of citrus are the strongest scents. There's a decent malt backbone, but it merely serves to hold up the hop profile. I barely pick up on a whisper of caramel.  Taste: Hops, hops, and more hops! No surprise there... This one has a nice firm bitterness that tends to overwhelm the malt base. Is that apple I detect? The grains comes across as a bit fruity and more caramelly than anything else. There's a touch of alcohol on the tail end. Starts bitter, finishes bitter...a well done IPA.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat medium in thickness with a dry, crisp mouthfeel. Small swipe of alcohol on the finish. I really wish Stone would bottle-condition their beers...  Drinkability: Pretty good for the style. Believe it or not, I expected this brew to be bigger and with more hops... I much prefer their Ruination IPA to this. Still a damn good IPA though...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,dmarch,4.03,"Although this is a wonderful beer,this is certainly not the best Stone has to offer. Then again, at the time of this review there are 5 stone beers in the top 50 so that's not really that negative of a comment. It's a golen color with a large white head. The aroma and taste is all hops. No surprise there. In my opinion, this isn't top 50 material. I always expect something big from Stone, but this is just simply a solid IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Darkale,4.2,"Cloudy orange, full hops aroma, a short head with light lacing which revives with a quick shake.  Taste is not surprising. Hops, hops, hops! And just a bit less creamy sweetness than their Ruination IPA. But, still, more than enough malt to keep the hops from overwhelming the beer.  Aftertaste is a shade sharp and bitter from the hops, and lasts longer than the Ruination.  Hoppy, hoppy, joy, joy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BigHead,4.62,"I felt like I was strolling along a hop field when I pour this beer and got a hint of the aroma. Hops, hops, hops, the floral bouquet of the hops are awesome!! The beer looks great as well, a good head on top of the golden brew with a slight cloudiness. Oh man, the taste is gooood. The character of the hops just taste fresh and citrus aftertaste with a feeling of hops blossomming on the roof of my mouth. The citrus and floral tones feel like a slight burn but a good one. The beer is very drinkable and a great IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,johnrobe,4.49,"Outstanding! This brew and SN Celebration are my two favorite IPAs. It pours a light amber in the glass with a thin white head. The aroma is very complex, heavenly! Citrus, pine, grapefruit, and sweet malt wonderfully intermingled. You'd swear you're standing in a Washington hop field during harvest. Layer after layer of hops flavors dominate the taste. Pineapple and grapefruit seem dominant; citrus, pine, and spice mingle in the background. There's a nice malty backbone to this brew as well. Lightly sweet and bready, like hawaiian sweet bread. Hops nirvana in a bottle!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kbub6f,4.41,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), a couple of days in my fridge, reviewed 45F-65F.  A conservative pour gives up a medium-sized, dense, cream-colored head. The texture of this head is gorgeous: so creamy. This may be the nicest looking head I've seen. The beer is an amber/gold, with minimal visible carbonation.  Holy grapefruit, Batman! Hops out the wazoo in the nose. There's also a curious, coppery sour smell that isn't unpleasant. Strange. The front is grapefruit. The middle is full and surprisingly balanced against the extreme hoppiness. There's sweet caramel and cream. It gets almost a little chocolatey at temperature. The finish is hoppy, of course, but there are also some very nice roasty grains and a fresh, bready aftertaste.  This is absolutely outstanding. The malty balance puts it ahead of Ruination for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,IrishRedRock,4.34,"Quite the interesting IPA, and not what I expected. Being a Stone beer, I expected a whole load of walloping hops. Instead this is a fruitier, sweeter IPA. Definitely an exceptional brew though. It's light orange in color, with a perfectly even balance between hops and a very sweet citrus aroma.  The most notable comparison of another IPA I can draw to this is Samuel Smith's, due to its toned-down character, lack of a biting hoppy finish, and the sweetness. Flavors of hops, grapefruit, and tangerines all come to mind. Mildly carbonated mouthfeel. This is hoppy, but not nearly as hoppy as others are. The fruitiness gives it a more unique character as well, and I certainly love that. This is a damn tasty brew!  Thanks to NeroFiddled for the 2 bottles!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,RBorsato,4.62,"Golden with a full light tan/beige head, decent carbonation, and leaves nice rings of lace. HUGE citrusy grapefruit hop aroma and a huge citrusy grapefruit hop taste ! Full bodied, smooth, and creamy. Well worth buying again.  Much better than Stone Ruination IPA. Stone's standard IPA is much better balanced than Ruination.  (22 oz. bottle / $3.77)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cretemixer,4.45,"Slightly cloudy honey gold colored brew with a thick white head. The head fades to a thick layer leaving a solid, clingy lace. Crisp, clean hop aroma that smells like a pine forest with pleasant floral notes. Hop bitterness bites the tounge and an oily resin coats the roof of my mouth. Very nice. Aggressive hops, yet balanced with a sweetness too. Very crisp & clean like the aroma. A lingering bitter aftertaste reminds you that you've just had a ""real"" beer. Full bodied, nicely carbonated, and very drinkable for the true hophead. I can't wait to try the Ruination. Thanks again Gusler for the great sampler pack.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Maestro,4.47,"The head on this IPA pours a little thin. The nose is amazing. There is a pineapple hint and an overall fruitiness to the aroma. The first taste is very floral and hoppy. There is a wonderful hop presence throughout the beer. The is an ever so slight dryness to the beer but overall it is quite complex. As you move to the middle of the beer you notice quite a lacing on the glass as well as a sweet maltiness holding its own. There is a good amount of carbonation in this beer and it has some refreshing characteristics that would make it great on a hot summer day. The alcohol content is rather high but the beer doesn't seem to taste high in alcohol. The beer finishes smoothly and has a nice, floral hoppy aftertaste. Well done, Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,goz,4.52,"Light amber pour, with a thick white head that laces very nicely. First pour from the bomber had some large carb bubbles that trickled to the top pretty quickly. Aroma had a strong pine smell to it, like sniffing a freshly fallen pine cone. Taste followed the smell quite nicely, with lots of hops and a long trailing aftertaste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,nomad,4.87,"Thank you to Stone and the Blind Tiger for making this twist on this beer happen:  Poured a softly opaque orange with a slight gold tone, real nice to look at. No lace but a soft tiny bubbled head. Nose was extremely fruity, yeasty, and grassy, but calmly so, as these scents were much more well blended than the bottled version. Fabulously brilliant smells, truly. Taste was perfectly grapefruity, even a little sweet fruity, and was paired with the most well-toned hops Ive ever tasted. The biscuit flavor was perfectly between real chewy and real thin.  The cask conditioning took away the salty tastes, made the sour more complex (yeah for the magic of wood), and rounded all the other flavors and scents together. This casking brought the classic IPA characteristics to an astounding height and smoother blend, and turned my highly unfavorable view of IPAs around. This beer floored me like none other - this is what happens when you take a top (the top?) IPA and cask condition (oooh, aaah) it. BRAVO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Morris729,4.47,"Pours a reddish amber color with a frothy white head that fades into a very sticky and clingy lace. Nose is dominated by strong floral hops with some underlying notes of fresh grains and Juicy Fruit bubblegum. Very smooth and creamy and while bitter hops are the key players here, they arent overpowering. In fact, the taste initially is sweet bready malts and lots of fruit that gives way to some notes of pine and raw hop leaf flavors that remain in the aftertaste. This is one damn fine IPA. Im very happy to see this beer finally for sale here in the Dallas area, and Im sure it will be a frequent purchase of mine. I cant wait to cellar a few bottles to see how they develop.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BeerResearcher,4.32,"A nice representation of the style. This shiny copper IPA is loaded with fresh whole hop flavors. The aroma is almost totally floral hop based. The medium/rich malt body doesn't provide much competition for the hops, but it plays a nice supporting role, while offering a trace herbal, earthy character. Full grapefruity, pine and citrus bitterness lasts. Lightly sweet with some noticeable alcohol kick that melds seamlessly with the hops. Lasting White Head and nice sticky lace.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dantes,4.67,"Presentation: ~10oz. of rare cask-conditioned IPA in a tulip glass at the Stone 12 event. Served a bit cold. Cost: $5.  Appearance: Typical casked-beer appearance. Thin, loose head that quickly resolved down to a thin, patchy skim. The amber-tinged yellow body was appropriately cloudy, warming my heart in anticipation. Very fine beading that suggested subtle carbonation. This was one of my early samples, so I was able to hold this to the daylight.  Smell: A very rich, hoppy, herbaceous aroma arose from the beer. Not resinously piney, but more like fresh, clean pine-scented mountain air.  Taste: Having been warned by Greg, I expected a palate-assaulting wave of hop bitterness. I was immediately impressed by how refreshing and delicious this beer actually was. I am constantly decrying the tendency of some beers to try and out-hop or out-ABV the competition. This beer never forgets that it is meant to be a pleasurable experience. As expected, the subtle, cask carbonation really lets the flavor of this beer fully express itself. Clean herbaceous flavors vie with the malt backbone, resulting in a wonderfully balanced, distinctive IPA. Has a yeastier, deeper flavor than the draught, which lasted long through the finish.  Mouthfeel: Delightfully smooth, cool, and satisfying. Compared to the &#8220;regular&#8221; draught IPA that followed, this was smoother and tastier and a bit less brittle.  Drinkability: Frightfully drinkable. This brew is the workhorse of the line; more complex and satisfying than the Pale Ale and less over the top than the Ruination. The alcohol is undetectable (although 6.9% ABV isn&#8217;t all that high). An ultra-high quality session beer I could drink all day.  Greg warned me not to have this as my first beer at the Stone/Blind Tiger event as I had planned because he thought it would be too hoppy and aggressive to start with; so I took his suggestion of the Pale Ale instead. Big mistake. Although the Pale Ale was good, it was a bit one-dimensional and thin. In contrast, I thought that the Ruination tried too hard. This beer is everything a great IPA should be, and on cask it is even better than draught. Now, I will have to seek out the bottles. Along with the Oaked Arrogant Bastard, the star of the tasting.  Bottom Line: As Goldilocks said after trying the Pale Ale and Ruination, &#8220;This is juuust right!&#8221;",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,francisweizen,4.5,"NOTES: this is hoppier and a bit better in the 22oz bombers than it is in the 12 oz bottles.  One of the best IPAs out there IMO. This beer pours an amazing clear peachy colour with a minimal head. This beer has a strong aroma of hops, with some malts sneaking in the aroma as well. This beer tastes just like a strong APA should...like hops! This beer has a strong, fresh, citrus-y hop taste to it but the malt still comes through strong! This has a very creamy mouthfeel and an excellent drinkability as well... Stone, are one of the best breweries out there! Amazing! Cheers!, F.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,BittRnessabounds,4.32,"The color is the pleasant and appetizing golden amber that is common for many IPAs. The carbonation level was just about right to produce a good level of head after a slightly vigorous pour, and lace remained for quite a while. The smell was pure hops. There may have been more complex smells there as well, but I was too happy inhaling the hops aroma to notice. The taste was mostly hoppy with a bit of sweet malt to balance. The taste buds were awakened nicely by the hop bitterness, yet it all finished very smoothly. Overall this is a very good IPA, and if you are a hophead you will love it. Considering this is just Stone's regular IPA, I can't imagine what their Ruination IPA is like, but I can't wait to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WVbeergeek,4.75,"Magnifcant, how do they do it? Stone just knows how to make amazing beers that's all they make. I have never tasted one of their brews that I wasn't satisfied with. Pours a lucious copper tone with a screen of haze over it. My two finger head on the is a great complement of white clouds, and the retention is good here with lace already lining my glass I am ready to hop in. The hops are diffusing through the air coming for me like a trained asassin. Huge hop aroma with earthy tones I love it, some citrus and floral scents also intrigue my senses. First sip I love it, I am going to say right now this is my favorite all around IPA!!!! Yes, it's that good with the hops consuming most of my palate, the malt sweetness comes to save me from making a bitter beer face instantly forming a smile on my face. The hop resins make the mouthfeel a bit oily, but in a good way lubricating my palate to partake in one hell of a beer. Medium to light rediculously drinkable in every way imaginable. No off flavors only a hop head's dream beer is sitting in my pint glass right now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Admiraldinty,4.13,"I have somewhat mixed emotions on this brew. Poured a three finger foam (with good retention) over a copper-gold with some sediment. The aroma is at first citrusy (especially grapefruit). Also, some very pungent alcohol and hops, but there seemed to be some other scent that was present, that I just couldn't place, but I didn't enjoy.  Taste was obviously very hoppy, but it was also somewhat grainy. A very dry, bitter finish.  At 6.9 % abv. this one will sneak up on you. Overall, I very tasty brew, but I prefer Hop Devil to this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,AtLagerHeads,4.05,"Well, I'm not a hophead, but you've got to give it's due; this is an impressive brew. The color is a cloudy, peachy amber; pretty. No head on this to speak of; light lacing. The aroma is complex as it immediately screams citrus, yet has buttery caramel underneath. The taste is a rush of hops with a strong start and a longlasting, pleasant bitterness to finish. Flowery overall sense. This grows on you, but slowly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,WilliamPhilaPa,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a rich golden peach color with a fluffy, creamy, sticky white foam lace; with very good retention. Decent carbonation. On the nose the aroma of raw hops, and a hint of fruity esters. On the palate there is an intense hop assault on taste buds, sharp bitterness, light biscuit and grain flavor, light malt sweetness, pear, sour apple; fruity esters, and pine. Body is medium. Mouth feel is crisp, sharp/bitter, and smooth. A very good IPA... a hopheads delight.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,HopheadEd,4.42,"A hazy orange color that is just a shade too light for me, IMO, for an IPA. Great head, lasting and lacing through the bottom of the glass. Sweet citrus hop smell, slight alcohol, and a little hop aroma, to say the least. Hops lead off the first taste, mellow malts, and sweet, oily hops. Very nice, not overwhealming. Spicey, short and crisp mouthfeel and aftertaste, very nice and very drinkable. Stone is now my favorite West Coast brewery!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,freed,4.54,"This IPA followed an even hoppier one, though the virtues of this beer were obvious. The bright citrus color, the beautiful golden color, and the saliva abating qualities of an IPA ring true. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, but didn't realize what a kick it had until later.  It might have been partly due to the lack of moisture in my mouth, but this made for an excellent sipping beer. I wasn't in any hurry while I enjoyed this. I'm actually starting to salvate again right now. What time do they open?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mickstepp,4.35,"Another fine offering by the venerable Stone Brewing Company. Orange color with a big thick frothy head. Citrusy smell of hops with a little yeast background. Nicely structured with a medium bodied, creamy texture. Good strong hop flavor which is what I expect from a Stone brew. This is an American Pale Ale standard along with Burning River, Avery, Three Floyds, Hop Devil and other strongly hopped, refreshing and delicious examples of the style. A very drinkable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Dmann,4.77,"What a bold beer! Right from the get go I knew I would enjoy this one. It poured a light amber color with a great fluffy white head. The aroma of citrus and spice was in full force and smelled absolutly wonderful. To say this beer is hoppy would be an understatement...it is VERY hoppy. But this is a good thing because it is still very smoothe. Mouthfeel was perfect, and the taste was great. It had a bit of a pine taste at the beginning, then as it hit my tounge it flavors opened up and revealed a very spicy flavor, and finished with a little alchohol warmth. This reminded me a lot of Arrogant Bastard, but with more of a spicy flavor. This is a great beer and now they make it in six packs....awesome!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,purplehops,4.29,"Stone IPA pours an amber-orange color with an off-white frothy head that last for the duration. As you drink you are treated to a nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is citrus hops, floral hops, spicy hops, sweet hops, grassy hops, hop hops, and just a hint of caramel malt. Did I say hops? This is a very nice dry hopped ale. The taste starts with a very green hop bite and hints of malt and then finishes with flavors of spicy hops and biscuit malt like flavors. Perhaps even a taste of allspice. I'm sure this comes from the hops and not true allspice. The aftertaste is warm, smooth, and (what else) hoppy. There is a hint of alcohol flavors starting to develope in the aftertaste. Just enough to give you a warm glow after the fifth or sixth swallow. The mouthfeel is very smooth with no hint of an acid bite that one would expect from so many hops. Overall an excellent IPA. Hoppy, smooth, an alcohol punch, and pleasant in the mouth. I only wish that it had a wee bit more malt in its flavor profile. But hey, that's being very picky.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,zerk,4.47,"Stone brews up some of the boldest beers in existance... their IPA is no exception. Pours a crystal clear light copper, with a thin but persistent white head that leaves a fair amount of lace behind. Aroma is all about the hops... pine, citrus, and just a touch of toasted malt. The flavor is bold and balanced... grapefruit and pine hit you over the head, then once you regain your senses, you notice a nice toasted malt profile that lasts for what seems like milliseconds, then you notice the wondefully bitter finish. Not a single flavor is out of proportion. The moutfeel is very smooth and creamy with a medium body. With this beer, I can honestly say I've crossed over... I'm now officially a hop head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,OldFrothingSlosh,4.47,"My first sampling from the Stone brewery. Needless to say, I was more than impressed.  22 oz. brown bottle with all the printing etched into the bottle in green and white lettering. 6.9% alcohol. It's nice to know that the gargoyle on the label ""wards off modern day evil spirits such as chemical preservatives, additives, and adjuncts."" Who wants evil spirits in their....spirits?  Appearance: Poured a clear dark copper with a generous 2"" thick frothy white head. Stuck to the sides of my glass quite nicely.  Aroma: Hmmmm.....how should I put it? Hoppy. Yes. Hoppy. Citrus-laced hops nuking your nose. Does that adequately describe it?  Taste: As can imagine, the hops win the ""hops vs. malt"" contest in this offering. Very crisp and decadent hop character drenches this beer. If you don't like (an obscene amount of) hops, then avoid this beer. An outstanding IPA. Definitely my favorite.  Mouthfeel: Excellent.  Drinkability: For a 6.9% beer, I could drink this all day. There's a little warming effect from it, but nothing to keep you ordering another...and another...and another.  I can't wait to try the other Stone beers I recently purchased. With an arrogant bastard, double bastard, and ruination IPA waiting to be consumed, I may be bitter the rest of this year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brewzzle,4.54,"As one of my favourite styles of beer this certainly ranks up there with the best I've had.  The first thing you notice when you pop the bottle is the aroma, wonderfully clean with a very strong hop profile. The aroma just get stronger as it pours, in fact I was not sure if I would spoil the moment by actually drinking the beer. Well, I am glad I took a taste, it has well rounded body, full of malt, hop bitterness and too many other delicate flavors my palate couldn't discern. The overall feeling it left me with is that it is well made, everything in proportion.  If it weren't so expensive I think I could just drink this IPA and be completely satisfied.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,allboutbierge,4.32,"If you've been to D's in Pittsburgh a couple times Im sure you've met Mike, hes a regular there and he recommended this to me early tonight. This IPA gives an exceptionally strong floral fragerance with a hint of citrusy scents. Head is white, fluffy, and disapates rather quickly. Its color is lighter than that of other AIPA's such as HopDevil. Flavor is very hoppy. First sip just smacks your face with the taste of hops and lingers throughout the bottle. Very hoppy beer. Taste is slightly bitter but very pleasant and tasty. A hophead's beer...Im gonna have to try arrogant bastard soon, which was characterized to me as 'similar to this but on steriods'",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,putnam,4.5,"My first Stone product. Run down in Ohio by my pal John Neil. Thanks!  Gorgeous, viscous, brilliant amber liquid. Super rich, concentrated ripe grain aromas are overcome by deliriously fresh, sticky hop fragrances. The greens lean toward the ""lemonade"" side of the spectrum. Overt nose on this one. Fluffy on the palate. Perfect carbonation here. Intense flavors of sheep's milk ricotta, lemon, egg pastries, heavily toasted, and graphite dust...maybe even a little charcoal. Edgy, forward and commanding. Good entertaining beer. True to its genre. Maybe one of the best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Zraly,4.43,"This has exceeded my expectations.  For one, I'm not a huge hophead. I'm more of a malt gal. Just as I prefer particular genres of music, I prefer particular structures of beer...high on the malt, medium on the hops. My usual preference (in terms of music) is either heavy, moody guitar rock or old Delta-style blues. But, this is not to say I do not appreciate other makes of music...because I love music in general. So, when I hear Bach or Dr. Dre, although they are not in my ""favorite"" style(s) of music, I appreciate their offerings. They do what they do and they do it well.  Stone is like Bach/Dre to me; overly hoppy beverages are not my first choice. But, I know a good one when I taste it. And Stone's IPA is a case in point.  The head poured rich, creamy, and fluffy . The beer itself was a beautiful, deep gold with a touch o' amber. The smell was hop heaven...like I just opened a pouch of fresh hop flowers. The smell was also tinged with a note of citrus...which carried over into the flavor.  As well as the citrus note, there is a spicy undertone that comes along with the malt hints, it is a sweet spice, or a spice that would compliment a sweet flavor. (Perhaps it is cinnamon I pick up on?) What amazes me most is, beside all the flavor and hoppy goodness...this beer finishes incredibly smooth, clinging to the glass all the way to the bottom. It's crisp and snappy. And so damn refreshing.  This is a high quality brew. It doesn't get much better than this.  This beer goes exceptionally well with shrimp and spicy cocktail sauce.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,kelticblood,3.84,"Poured a light amber gold color.Wasn't much of a head,but left trace amounts of lace.Head dissolved quick to almost nothing.Has an immediate hop smell.Taste of hops is unmistakable and hefty.A medium body with an unusual high ABV for an IPA.The finish is very bitter with no presence of an alcohol taste.Leaves a dry feeling on the mouth.You'll be burping up hops for awhile with this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Viking,4.13,"Clear orange-amber brew with a few lazy trails of C02. Nice, thick white head. Head fades a bit quickly, but leaves plenty of lace on the glass, and atop the beer. Smell of piny-grapefruity hops is strong. I didn't notice any malt in the aroma. Taste is a wonderful bitter hop bit, citrusy and herbal with a bit of caramel malt to keep it from being 2-Dimensional.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,maxpower,4.28,"12 oz bottle, light orange -copper color with a white frothy head, nice lacing. Clean citrus-pine aroma, medium body malty with a strong hop profile, nice balance, One hell of an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jon,4.5,"Mmm... hops. This IPA pours a golden copper color with excellent clarity and a frothy, off-white head which holds up well. Nose is dominated by citric, floral hops. With 60 IBUs, the taste is big on hops, as well, with some nice malt support. Not overpowering, but rather fairly well balanced with a definite nod to the hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is smooth overall, and is fairly easy to drink for a brew of its ABV. Stone produces an upper-tier American IPA with this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,bewareOFpenguin,4.5,"Poured a nice golden color with a good head. The first sip signalled what was to come as the taste of hops filled my mouth. Not extremely bitter, but pleasantly biting. The ABV could be felt as I continued to consume. Quite a pleasant IPA, and I will be buying more in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Longstaff,4.43,"This is really a unique IPA. Pours out beautifully with a nice white head and golden yellow body. I expected more hop aroma but it was there along with a buttery malt nose. Light bodied while going down but the aftertaste is buttery with caramel, butterscotch, and vanilla flavors dominating. A cedery hop flavor is there and the bitterness complements the malt very well but does not overwhelm. When this beer warms it takes on belgian ale qualities which I am guessing comes from the type of yeast they use. A very fine IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,PhantomVodoo,4.32,"This is a top notch IPA. Aggressively hopped. A wonderful hop aroma abounds. Very good flavor with the hops dominating, yet very drinkable and not too bitter. If you're a hop-head you need to find this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,doerickson,4.32,"Light copper in color with a smallish white head. Hop aromas of pine and citrus fill the nose. Light carbonation. The hops bite you right away and don't let go, although there is some toasted malt flavor to keep the hops from completely having their way. I haven't tasted many American IPAs that were better than this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Todd,4.72,"Presentation: 12oz brown bottle. Fancy painted label with loads of definitions and the usual (nice bottle), but no freshness date. Poured into an Imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Clear, but thick looking, brillian amber with a good 2-3 finger clumpy, fluffy, creamy, sticky white foam lace. Excellent head retention! I recommend that you pour this beer hard, but controlled for max. eye candy.  Smell: Hop aromas are off the hook! Wonderfully aromatic, a bit pungent, with strong herbal / spice characters. Loads of thick fruity esters join the fun, too. I think Stone should bottle this scent and market it as a beergeek cologne.  Taste: First thing that hits the palate is hop spice. It's herbally and there's lot of it -- a bit piney, too. There's a background peak of grassy hop flavours, and a near puckering effect -- I know George Carlin hates this word (screw him), but this beer is ""zesty!"" and one hoppy-ass beer, to say the least. (drink this beer and burp ... gotta love that)  Mouthfeel is so damn smooth, very creamy, a bit syrupy and big all around.  Malt-wise, things get nicely balanced with a very full and rich body and moderate sweetness, in comparison to the hops. Middle fruity flavour, akin to pineapple. Big bready and yeast-like finish (a tad too much, but forgivable), going dry with residual hop flavours still kicking ass all over your palate.  Notes: Simply put ... this is one insane IPA, and not for the weak palate. To compare it to other IPAs would be silly, however I think this sums it up ... Once Stone comes into a new market it's like a challenge to other brewers in the area: ""I know my big beers are bigger and better than yours, but let's see yours anyway. I promise not to laugh."" Oh ... and this is just their standard IPA doing the speaking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,QXSTER1,4.82,"Massive hops aroma assaults the senses after pouring this appealing amber brew. Puts other IPA's into another category. The nose says all hops the taste says big, grainy, caramel malt underlying the big time Pacific Northwest hop profile. The hops are so flavorful, bitterness doesn't really come to mind. The citric, piney adjectives don't seem to capture all the different complexities available in this brew. Anyone who loves hops and thinks they've had it all should try this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,TheLongBeachBum,4.92,"After the Stone Ruination I thought things could not get any better. How Wrong could I be? the Stone IPA is even better than the Ruination!. The trademark 22 fl.oz bottle contains yet another masterful brew, with more charisma than the Annual convention of Conceited Egocentrics. It poured with a reasonable head, which quickly rescinded to a modest ¼ covering. Little carbonation once things calmed down, with the head later breaking up to reveal just a halo-head clinging to the edges. A Golden Amber Color that had a feint orangey glow at times. The aroma is totally inescapable unless you have no nose, or burnt out your septum doing Coke. According to the blurb on the bottle, this is because of 2 weeks of dry-hopping. It works and gives a very pungent fresh hop nose, extremely floral in character, just like walking through a Kent Hop field after it has rained (yes I have done this!). The hops continue into the taste. A stunning hoppy, citric bitterness introduces the beer. This is SO fresh, I expected to find hop cones inside the bottle. There is malt hidden in the background that defers to the higher authority of the hops, and a very mild sweetness does help to balance the beer at the end. You would not believe this beer is 6.9% ABV, there is little or no alcohol character to this beer at all  it is all about Hops. Just as it should be. The normal Stone IPA, as I now see I incorrectly referred to it before I tried it tonight, has a much better overall balance than the Ruination. Its Drinkability? Well, it is simply only limited by that of your own Capacity!!. This is THE sign of a truly Great Beer in my very humble opinion, and one which I rarely encounter. Simply an Exceptional IPA, which has the edge on its more famous stablemate Ruination I think. I am beginning to have the utmost respect & highest regard for Stone. I have limited experience of US Brewers, but if there are better ones out there I cant wait to try them!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,NeroFiddled,4.5,"The body is a hazy deep peach in color, topped by a frothy white head that holds well and leaves some excellent ""sticky"" lace. The aroma is of a fruity, sweet (almost sugary) malt, and bold floral & citrus hops (that combine with the sweetness to offer alot of pineapple - but also some lemon). The body is medium/full with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives a light zest on the tongue and then becomes quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor offers a blend of rich, sweet, fruity, and lightly caramel & bready malt, and loads of citrusy, floral, piney & grassy hops backed by a solid bitterness. It finishes with a lingering combination of sweet floral malt flavor and dry bitterness. Although the bitterness is hefty, it's not overwhelming, and the sweet malt remains evident throughout the glass. The alcohol is beautifully cloaked, revealing only a light touch of ""spiciness"" in the flavor. This is a really unique and exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out. Well brewed. Outstanding.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jackndan,3.78,"Stone IPA: Not Ruination, but rather Stone&#8217;s everyday IPA, bought in a six pack. Very nice amber color, with a very thick sticky head. The aroma was hops, the taste was a mildly pleasant hops tingle and the aftertaste was a very nice hops, with a slight residue of hops oils. Very nice, with a decent alcohol warmth as well. Very nice example of an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,sinistersteve,4.47,"I guess this is Stone's IPA light when compared to the Ruination IPA, but don't think this is anything light. Stone's IPA also has a strong hop pressence in it's taste. The appearence is a bit cloudy, yet still has that copperish ale look to it. The hop pressence is obvious in the aroma, so don't say you were not warned when you drink it. This is a good beer by Stone, although, I'm a bit confused as to why they would have 2 full-time IPA's on the market...not unless this is the budget version when compared to the Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,hyuga,4.95,"Pours a big, impressive froth that almost refuses to settle (which, of course, is a good thing). Leaves nearly enough lace to make it look like it didn't even settle! Copper to orange color. Absolutely beautiful hoppy aroma. Tons of floral and citrus character. In fact, it jumps out at you before you even finish opening the bottle. More citrus-like hop bitterness in the flavor, with some hints of spiciness and great malty undertones. Hops make it very smooth and crisp, and the bread-like maltiness underneath rounds it out quite well. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness as well. Dangerously drinkable! This is one wonderful brew. I'm loving every Stone brew I try with a passion! If you're just starting to love hops, this is a great step up from their pale ale if you're not quite ready for ""ruination"". And for the seasoned hophead, this is a wonderful treat and an exceptional brew all around! No matter who you are, try this! It will not fail to impress.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,marc77,4.3,"Slightly hazy golden - hue topped by a thick, heterogenous head that leaves lace. Aromatic citrus rind and pine hop nose perhaps from a Cascade / Chinook combination. Malt aroma is subdued, and only a light caramel sweetness can be discerned. The clean, but sharp hop bitterness upfront gives slowly gives way to honey - like sweetness and light bready grain, but hops nonetheless dominate overall. Hop flavor is wonderfully all American, being comprised of pine, grapefruit & even a hint of lemon. Although secondary to the hop profile, there's sufficient malt foundation to keep this AIPA from being one - dimensional. Finishes pleasantly bitter. A definitive American IPA. Hops dominate, but they aren't overbearing or astringent. Surprisingly ""balanced"" for a brew by Stone. Reminescent of Ruination IPA ""light."" Stone IPA is well crafted and very tasty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,cokes,4.59,"Wohoo! This is an IPA I can dig into! Pours a deep golden body. White head is thin. Fades to a laces and sticks around. There are actually hops specks in my glass. The nose is literally blasted with the aroma. Lemon and grapefruit. Pine and tropical fruit. Heavenly! Taste is big on the hops, but well-balanced. Starts with some grapefruit and pine, then segues to some carmel and toasted notes. Finishes up with some sap-like hops. Lingers in the mouth long after the sip. Fills the mouth with flavor. Nothing obscene or offensive. Just solid IPA goodness. Makes me wonder what some of Stone's other IPA's are like.  Thank you very much, Bighuge. This was worth the 250 mile trip in itself",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Brent,4.59,"Some beers are big, but this one is gigantic. Pushes the hops envelope with gusto! Fantastic aroma of grapefruit with a tinge of sweetness (pink grapefruit/tangerine?) Hops stake a claim in the flavor right from the start, but then back off just enough to let the malt shine through, then the hops settle back in for a slow, bitter finish. Not over the top with hops, but teetering on the edge. An outstanding IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,ZAP,4.24,"Smell is unbelievable...fresh and spicy with some floral notes...the incredibly complex aroma of this beer is definitely a highlight of it..I could smell this damn thing all night without taking a sip..Taste is very goo..Definitely leans to the bitter side quite heavily, but there is a good malt backbone with some soft caramel undetones...strong bitterness on the long finish...taste doesn't quite match the smell but still very good overall..",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,aracauna,3.9,"I probably should have drank this first. It seems almost boring after the Ruination. Less floral than Ruination, with an intense smell of a christmas tree sap. Smell almost gives me a headache. Stone makes pretty beers and this is one of them. Good head with nice retention, good color. Flavor is surpisingly malty, nutty. Hops strong from the beginning and very short finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bierman9,4.13,"This is a good example of what an IPA should be. Medium golden color, with a slightly off-white, frothy head, and real good lace. Has a strong, flowery hop nose...mmm! Mouthfeel was real nice, almost bordering on very good. Very nice flavor! Full hop flavor; smooth and floral, with a slight bit of hop-sharpness, too! And as it warmed a bit, a nice sweet, underlying maltiness showed through. Tasty! Thanks, Murph!!  overall: 4.15 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4.5  258",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Bighuge,4.42,"The appearance is a deep golden with orange tinting. A slight bubbly off-white head. Nice lace patterns develop on the sides of the glass as I drink. Citros, lemon rind, grafefruit and slight pine on the nose. This is a very balanced IPA in taste. the hops do not overwhelm, but rather, they are firm in their presence. The hop-attributed tastes are lemon rind, citrus and pine. There's some nice bitterness, but not quite enough for my liking. Very quaffable IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Mark,3.98,"Nice gold color, white thick head, and great solid lacing. First sip was very hoppy and refreshing. Piney, grapefruit aroma. One note of interst was near the bottom of the glass the hops were gone. good solid IPA though not spectacular.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Wildman,4.95,"This beer poured out a nice copperish gold color and formed a nice fairly white head, that when subsiding, left some nice lace. Aroma had elements of hops and some citrus. The taste had a substantial amount of hops and slightly bitter aspect to it, which is good in an IPA. Good beer",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,beernut7,4.25,Nice medium bodied highly hopped for flavor and bitterness. Nice malt balance and very conducive to repeated consumption.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,mickeymac,3.92,"As someone else said, this one is about the hops. Apart from the hops, however, I found the flavor a bit on the bland side. Nothing about this beer set it apart for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,John,4.35,"Clearly what we have here is a West Coast IPA. That's a good thing if you're a hophead (which I am...I think). But seriously folks, this is good stuff. Hazy orangish/peach color with beautiful rocky off white head when poured from the 22oz. bomber into my favorite 20oz. pint glass. Big hop aroma. Big citrusy hop flavor that turns a bit milder when it warms (it was a challenge to let this warm as I wanted badly to quaff it down). Some malt just peeks through and teases but is shut down by more fruity/estery citrus hop flavors. During any session, start with something less aggressive hop wise and work up to this, cause once you're here there's no going back.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,jonnylieberman,4.6,"Poured nicely from a 22 into my snifter. Gorgeous orange with red overtones. Frothy, barely off-white head. Quite thick.  Smells of raw hops. Also grapefruit rind, Starburst, cherries, earth -- quite excellent.  Taste: Bubblegum and buttered toast. Slight honey notes. Hops are everywhere but great malt balance. Perfect, quintesential bitterness. An shining example of the west coast IPA style. Truly excellent. Incredible coating aftertaste. Just delicious. Nectar.  Mouthfeel is the beers only sore-spot. Too foamy, too fizzy. A little thin, too.  I could drink this until the DoomsDay Machine goes off.  Old 2001 Review: Possibly the perfect west coast style IPA. Bursting at th e seams with everything you want in an IPA - Hops, malt and alcohol. All of it balanced really well with the hops winning out in the end. could drink this for days. Go Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jordan,4.75,"Heavy aromas of flowers, citrus fruit, and wild hops. The carbonation bubbles ever so slowly float to the top of the glass. Carries flowery notes as well as sweet malts, but the hops bitterness dominates the palate. So smooth and creamy and filling! A fantastic I.P.A. Would expect no less from Stone Brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
147,88,Jason,4.23,"Presentation: 22 oz brown bomber with a silk screen painted label of the ""Stone Brewing Gargoyle"" which wards off impurities that would otherwise taint the sanctity of the brew.  Appearance: Rich golden hued brew that has a very frothy white lace which sticks all over the glass.  Smell: Very aromatic ... raw hop and hints of fruity ester. Nice dry-hopping!  Taste: Intense hop character, both flavour and bitterness. A bit smooth and a bit crisp with some malt flavour ... a little biscuit and grain, some malt sweetness and fruity ester. Though the hops are very dominant and push their sweet and bitter oils onto the palate. Amazingly the after taste cleans up a little leaving some grain and hop leaf flavour in the finish. Gulp after gulp this brew seems to warm the body more and more.  Notes: Wow now this is an IPA! Well attenuated and very bitter, yet still a little malt character to balance. Seriously ... if you don't like hoppy beers than this one might not be a good pick. If you are a hophead ... than buy a case! There was only one thing this beer said to me ""Don't be a whimp, drink a hoppy beer!"" Also this a quite deceiving brew topping out at 6.9% abv.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",American IPA,93
