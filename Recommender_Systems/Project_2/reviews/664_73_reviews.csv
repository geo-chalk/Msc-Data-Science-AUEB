664,73,TurboMon_911,4.06,"(BBD 28 Dec 22) - Nitro version. Poured a velvety black color from a 14.9 oz. can into a standard pint glass with a creamy finger high head that receded slowly and left curtain lacing that clung to the glass as it dissipated. Aroma is earthy and grainy which is fairly standard for the style. Taste is chocolate forward but is not overly chocolaty and has hints of chicory, roasted malts & grain. Mouth is smooth, medium bodied with a clean finish and is very drinkable. Picked up for under $10 for a 4 pack and was quite pleased wit the purchase.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,woodchipper,3.58,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle dated 28 JUL 22 to a diagonally cut tumbler at fridge temp but was slowly sipped and allowed to warm. The body is opaque black with a short, deep tan head on top that fades but provides some quickly disappearing lacing. Chocolate is dominant in the smell as is the alcohol. Some dried fruit can be sensed also. The taste brings the dried fruit out more prominently; cherrys, raisins, all “chocolate covered”. This beer bridges between the sweet and the bitter. Overall the taste is reminiscent of a box full of a fruity alcohol chocolate sampler. Mouthfeel seems rather thin frankly, but it does leave your lips sticky. I am not quite sure about how I feel about this beer. It was worth the experience, but will not be a repeat purchase.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MikeWard,3.87,"16oz nitro can into a pint glass. Best before 9/19/22, so a couple weeks late on this one.  Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body, cream colored creamy head which persists throughout leaving a layer of lacing.  Creamy aroma, but smells a little off.  On tasting, not getting as much chocolate as I hoped, but a sweet creamy stout with a light roast at the end for balance.  Mouth just about reaches medium, finish roasty.  Overall, some flaws in all categories except the look.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,puck1225,4.19,"A bit surprised I had never reviewed this beer before.  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacing.smell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Clean, not overpowering taste. Rich, smooth feel. I wish I had another bottle!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CBlack85,4.01,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Wilmington Brewing Company Can Glass  The beer pours nearly pitch black with only the lightest ruby highlights, and about two fingers of dense light tan head that slowly recedes into a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a minimal amount of lacing  The aroma is dark & milk chocolate, coffee, and some roasted malts. Very pleasant and inviting.  The taste follows the nose quite closely. The chocolate is complimented with the roasted malts. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and more pronounced milk chocolate flavors. Light/medium bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.  Overall, this is a really nice beer, that is very smooth and easy to drink. Quite enjoyable",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,AlexandraDen,3.9,"Pours a very deep, dark brown. The look is black, but held to a light you can see the deep ruby shades going through. No beer so far that’s been nitro’d has the ability to pour as big a nitro head as Guinness — but Young’s comes very close, with a thick, dense finger tall head that looks a little more watery and a little more creamy than other nitro stouts. Hard to ever rate nitro beers low on the looks department.  Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, chocolate dust, cacao beans, roasted coffee, caramelized sugar in sticky toffee pudding, and light burnt and toasty malts. What can you say? It’s good!  Taste follows the nose, but is regrettably more watery with a thinner body than the nose suggests. They do not lie about the chocolate, dark chocolate intermingles with milk chocolate on the finish, which is a bit sweeter. Gentle bitterness from the roasted malt on the front. Earthy with a nice almond-esque nuttiness throughout.  Based on the style I’m almost tempted to say this is a lighter bodied stout but I’d say it’s square in the medium bodied category. This is straight up nitrogenated, there is barely even a tickle of the tiny bubbles on the palate. Not quite flat, however, this creates a very very smooth mouthfeel. As smooth as you can possibly get, even more than other nitro stouts. Semi-dry finish that leans to the sweet side.  I will be honest, I came into the review a little disappointed. I am used to Young’s like the picture on BA, the nice dark glass in the regular carbonation. Ironically, I actually love nitro stouts. But years ago when I first started drinking good beers, I loved to split Young’s with a friend. One of the first real chocolate stouts on the market, and it was so good. Not sure if I’ll ever find a bottled one again.  That all being said, this was still not bad. You sacrifice certain aspects and bolder flavours for the smoother ride of the nitro when you go for the widget can. This is still a remarkable beer, one that is actually pretty easy drinking for people used to stouts and nitros. Could easily have a few in a night. The flavours are subtle but varied and complex enough to make a great beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,defunksta,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly black, color with a moderate light tan head. SRM of 22-23. (3.75)  Aroma: Mild aromas of English cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa nibs, some earthy black malts. Smooth lactose. (3.75)  Flavor: Smooth flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. Some tobacco & smoke. This smooths into a milk chocolate, dark malt, and creamy lactose on the end. (3.75)  Feel: Lighter bodied. Low carbonation. Drinks sort of flat with tobacco bitterness and cocoa lingering on the finish. (3.50)  Compared to Founders' Porter 3/7/22: Pours a similar color, milder and lighter head. Milder aromas. More bittersweet chocolate, tobacco bitterness. Less chocolate, espresso, lactose. Lighter body.  Overall: An English Stout for sure with the bittersweet chocolate and tobacco notes intermixed with the chocolate. Lighter-bodied and under-carbonated in my opinion. Has the English flavors, but that was about the only thing I found enlightening about this beer. (Final Rating: 3.73)",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DanO1066,3.8,"4pk of 12oz bottles (Best before 23 JAN22) picked up at the Arundel Preserve Wine and Spirit: Hesitated a long time prior to trying this, ""Double Chocolate"" sounded like way too much chocolate. Frankly, could barely smell it and even that might have been ""peer pressure"". More, but thankfully NOT overwhelming chocolate on the tongue with some malt thrown in. A smooth drinker, but I don't think I'll be coming this way again anytime soon.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Christianriveraaa,4.78,The pour was a very smooth dark chocolaty pour. The smell reminds me of a very strong malt chocolaty smell on the nose. The taste was actually very surprising as you could taste the malts and chocolates. Over all this stout is very unique in it's own way and I would definitely enjoy a bottle every weekend!!!,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WlSH_YOU_WERE_BEER,4.23,"Pours a beautiful, inviting head with aromas similar to a chocolate milk, rather than chocolate itself. On the palate, the beer is much more straight forward with a heavy blend of both milk and dark chocolate qualities and roasted malts, much to my surprise of the rather subtle aroma. Moderate carbonation with a perfect lingering finish. Extremely creamy and smooth; like a Nitro brew. The smoothest beer I've had which actually blows my mind. Beautiful combination of a strong chocolate taste without being too heavy or sweet, which comes unexpected from the much lighter aroma.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BubbleBobble,3.76,"Pours jet black with a 0.5"" tan head, settling out to a solid ring, nice streaky lacing. Nose is chocolate milk, chocolate syrup, and light roast. Taste is milk chocolate, a bit of bitter baking chocolate, and some deeper roast notes. Mouthfeel on the thin side, but helps avoid this from getting too heavy. Delivers noticeable chocolate flavor without becoming overly sweet or heavy. Warrants respect for its subtlety.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,rapayn01,4.03,"I've had this beer in both cans and bottles. The cans I purchased locally in winter '19-20 and found that the taste was negatively effected. It was slightly metallic. While in London at a Young's pub in summer 2019, I had a 500 ml bottle. It was very nice -- smooth, creamy, with chocolate notes. I was surprised it was not on draft, but perhaps it was because it was summer. Still, it was a cool and rainy day in mid-June.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,InspectorHound,3.47,"Look: This was poured from widget can, so the bottle pour might be very different. Pours a rich dark brown on hair below black. Pours like a Guiness with all the seperation expected. BIg 2 finger tawny head. The head lasts forever still a finger high at 5 minutes. The head is dense and marshmellow like. Sticky as can be.  Smell: Dark chocolate, but so subtle. Maybe the head is holding it in but way to subtle to be appreciated.  Taste: Watery up front, both dark and milk chocolate, with hints of almond nuttiness.  This beer is a total enigma. Phenomenal look, disappointing smell, decent taste, and a mouthfeel that starts out weak but picks up some steam in the end. As a big fan of chocolate stouts, this is kind of disappointing. I'd say this beer is far too muted. It earns a B-  Feel: Very watery up front, but it finishes with a creamy dryness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Elemental19xx,4.01,"Pours similarly to a Guinness, just a lot darker. Smells mostly like cocoa, with a slight coffee aroma. The taste is very chocolaty, and with the bitterness of the beer, its like a very dark chocolate. Like an 80% dark chocolate. The beer is extremely creamy, and creates a wonderfully pleasant feeling. The perfect carbonation for a stout. Almost smoother than a nitro brew. This beer is very good and i would highly recommend it to a fan of stouts.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Teika_Takahashi,3.4,"Look: So dark that light can't pass through it. Like my soul :3c nice persistent foamy head Smell: Chocolate (DUH ITS CALLED CHOCOLATE STOUT DUHHHHHHHHHH), tobacco, Bailey's Taste: It has chocolate flavor, but is missing the creaminess that I personally associate chocolate with. Notes of malt and black coffee. Strong black coffee/dark chocolate aftertaste. Feel: Not much carbonation. Pretty smooth and dry. Would not go on a second date with a man like this. Overall: One of the better stouts I have drank, but I am not much of a stout cat. Its not too dry which I like, and the flavor is not intense so it is very drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,staubot,3.92,"Looks great. Dark with smooth creamy head. The Widget really does its job. Scent is too weak, even taking into account the thick head. I liked the roasted slight hint of chocolate taste but I'm not a chocolate and coffee beer enjoyer. I feel for the style the chocolate could have been group out more prominent. Smooth perfect bitterness feel.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,leaddog,4.18,"Appearance - Pours a jet black with two fingers of creamy tan head.  Smell - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, coffee bean, earthy and leafy hops, dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig), and earthy yeast.  Taste - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, and coffee bean upfront. The earthy and leafy hops come through next followed by the dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering.  Overall - A flavourful sweet stout that delivers on all flavours. I am impressed on how velvety smooth this beer is with all the bold elements in it. A stand out in this category and deserving of a try from those that haven't sampled it yet.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,BillAfromSoCal,3.97,"Bottle split between two pint glasses to share. Pours just barely off-black with two fingers of tan to dark tan head. It dissipates faster than I would have guessed, based on the thick appearance of the head. some lacing. Not a lot of smell considering this is ""double chocolate"". Not a lot of chocolate in the taste, either. A bit of bitter chocolate coming through. Nice balanced mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to let you know it is not flat. Overall pretty good....but sooooo many better stouts to choose.....",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rapscullion,3.68,"Youngs was my local brewery for a few years of my life. I still remember what a revelation Double Chocolate was when it first came out in bottle. I recently found this in can with a nitro capsule. It is not remotely the same beer. Pours a very appealling black with a creamy tan head. Follows with fabulous fragrant nose. Then it is all downhill, very thin and entirely missing the big chocolate hit. So disappointing. Search this out in bottle and give the can a wide berth.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,IPAs_for_days_13,3.93,"L: Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a one finger tan head. This brew was really cool to pour, all the carbonation seemed to fall in waves to the bottom of the glass. S: Very rich smells of dark chocolate, nice roasted grains from the malts, has a cream aroma as well. T: Taste follows the nose, has a nice bitter coffee like aftertaste. F: Full-bodied, very low carbonation, thick & creamy mouthfeel. O: Not a bad stout, much like Guinness. None of the flavors really stood out to me though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JRybacki,4.24,"Poured from a 16oz can with nitrogen widget, on a chilly fall day just before sunset. Nice thick head that you need to wait to form after pouring so the nitrogen can do its thing. Nice thick lacing left on the glass. Color is dark brown and really opaque. Aroma is chocolate first and subtle dark fruit. Taste is all chocolate and luxurious. Hints of that dark fruit show up in the background but chocolate is the overall flavor- not bitter but really smooth. Mouthfeel is really smooth as expected with nitrogen widget. So creamy and luxurious, but not syrupy. Overall, what a satisfying and drinkable beer! I have to admit i always thought this beer would be too syrupy sweet but of course i failed to recognize that Young's knows what they are doing. I can't wait to buy this again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,misteil,4.06,"just gonna do a short review here, very nice chocolate stout here, tonne of chocolate flavour, perfect winter’s night drink, has a nice not overwhelming roasted malt character, hint of sweet dark fruit and a decent bit of coffee flavour, but it’s milk chocolate all the way, smooth and medium bodied, quite drinkable for a milk stout, good stuff.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Wattie83,3.74,"Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass. Color looks black, but held up to light it's coming off as dark brown with a tan head that falls off to a light cap. Aroma is chocolate, roast malt, some black licorice. Smell intensifies as it warms up. Taste is chocolate, a bit of cream, roasted malt, a good bit of sweetness up front and then a bit of bitterness kicks in towards the end. There's a dose of grassy hoppiness in the end. Feel is light and a bit thin for me. This is a well carbonated stout. It finishes very dry. Overall I wish I could get the feel of the nitro version with the taste of the bottle version. This is a beer that gets better as it warms as the chocolate flavor intensifies and the carbonation falls. It's a fine beer though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,shambeano,3.84,"330ml bottle, best before 'Feb 21'. Poured into a tulip. Look: Black, though seemed to be a lighter black. Has about 2cm of tan head that subsides to a film pretty quickly, Leaves a little lacing. Looks alright. Smell: Roasted malt, a little dark chocolate, some coffee. A touch of sweeter milk chocolate as it warms up a bit. Chocolatey but not as much as I had expected from the label. Pleasant though. Taste: More chocolate comes through when tasting. A mix of Cacao nibs and milk chocolate. Like when you make a hot cocoa that isn't sweet enough. Here it is what it say's it is. There is also a bit of roastiness as well, and the finishing bitterness. Feel: a little thin for a stout, mid bodied. A touch of tingly carbonation at the front of the palate, but not only slight. A dry finish. Overall: Quite tasty, I was a little underwhelmed. It was good, but I probably went into it with expectations that were not met.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rug,3.94,"Best by 1/5/21  I have always seen this one at my local since I started going there. It took me a long while ti decide to pick it up as milk stouts are usually not my style, but it was calling me one day and I had to go for it  Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light brown head that settles to a cap quickly and leaves tons of lacing  The nose is surprisingly balanced; more like a standard stout in its' blend of sweet chocolate, mild coffee roast, and light earthy hops. The malt here reminds me of an amber in the way that it feels toasted  The taste starts with bittersweet dark chocolate, but there's not much else going on. It treads the line between sweet and roasty on the swallow, but the chocolate feels very authentic. A touch of grassy hops in the aftertaste  A medium body pairs with very light carbonation to lead to a fluffy and refreshing stout. Drying in the finish which clears the palate for the next sip  This is an extremely drinkable beer, almost dangerous. I would not frequently get this, but I could absolutely pound a few of these if I'm in the right move. Simple, but very good",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Chmacle,4.29,"This is like an alcoholic chocolate milk. The only thing stopping this stout from tasting like a milk stout is how thin it is. Not a complaint, but I think it might be more interesting with a thicker feel. The chocolate comes through at the forefront but not aggressively so. All of the flavors coexist nicely, creating a very cohesive and relaxed experience. Overall, this beer is laid back but indulgent.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MNAle,3.77,"Nitro can. Deep black opaque appearance topped with a tan, thick, creamy head as expected with a nitro gizmo. Great looking nitro cascade with the pour. The head lasts nearly until the end, leaving strings, spots, and sheets of tan lacing as you drink.  Aroma is chocolate with earthy hops. Semi-sweet malt aroma. Roasted coffee.  Feel is the silky smooth nitro presentation with a thin body.  Taste is dry with chocolate. Some roasted malts. I'd describe it as an Irish Dry Stout with chocolate flavor added. Quite nice, desert rather than dessert. The finish has a slight bitterness, and as at the beginning, dry.  Listed as a sweet/milk stout, but it is not sweet at all. It is a good, but not great, chocolate-flavored dry nitro stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,branham1989,4,Eagle Brewery’s Young’s Double Chocolate Stout 5.2% ABV 25 IBU. This milk stout pours a deep dark brown with a cascading khaki colored head that lingers for a very long time before leaving tons of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of faint cocoa powder/chocolate and roasted malt other than that not much is going on. The flavor is muted bittersweet chocolate with hints of coffee dark roasted malt with a slight tang before finishing with a faint bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy but too thin for my liking but it’s your typical nitro beer. This is not the best nitro stout I’ve had but it’s still okay. 5/10,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mothmanscott,3.96,"From notes 10/1/12: This review is based on the bottled version, not the nitro can. Pours a deep brown (looks black) and produces 1.5 fingers of mocha, short-lived, tightly bubbled head that leaves thin strings of lacing. Nose is dark roasted/burnt malts, semisweet chocolate, a hint of coffee and weak dark fruit. Taste is semisweet chocolate, creamed coffee, light smoke and char. Slightly bitter quality following mid-sip, subdued it increases in the almost watery finish and lingers into the bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied than expected (almost thin) with low carbonation it is smooth, creamy and goes down easy.

This perhaps has little more chocolate and coffe inside but also it is more bitter and has less sweetness inside.. And more carbonation that is good.

664,73,JerzDevl2000,4,"Had this beer a *very* long time ago and bought it again recently so I could review it on here. While not up to par with other Stouts that I've had as of late, this is a classic that almost felt like a Porter because of how easygoing it was and how dry and roasted the mouthfeel felt. If that's your kind of beer, then you have a big-time winner with this one!  Poured this out of an 330 ml / 11.2 oz bottle as the head filled up the remaining space in my pint glass. That was quite tan, full and bubbly as the liquid below it was like root beer while being just a bit thinner. Lots of lacing left behind, especially near the bottom of my pint glass. Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and bittersweet chocolate in the nose as all of these came through in the taste. Once this warmed up, it was quite nice and smooth on the palate while being drier than I recall, as this needed a bit of water to get everything down. A bit more lactose and sweetness would have been nice but this beer was just fine as it was since there was enough carbonation to keep this light and me on my toes...  Not a lot of booze here and the mouthfeel was somewhat cloying as the roasted undertone and slight stickiness lingered long after this went down. No date after the ""best before"" on the back of the label but this tasted fine as there wasn't any sediment in the liquid whatsoever. British in feel, this Stout's a must-have for anyone looking to indulge in the classics and see what a Breakfast Stout with chocolate and extra coffee would come across as!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Trailboss76,4.24,"Very dark brown. Minimal caramel-colored head giving off an aroma with some sweetness to it including hints of chocolate, caramel, and coffee. I am indeed drinking this one with sort of a dessert beer desire and am not disappointed. That said, it's certainly not soda-sweet but does have some nice subtle tones that take it out of the ""regular beer"" lane just enough. A little streak of bitterness counters that sweetness without being overbearing. I'd get this again for sure.  On another occasion (01/11/2019 Brits Pub - Minneapolis) , my take was: Super dark color, frosty head, malty sweet flavor. Not much aroma. Looks like a nitro when it’s poured with bubbles and stuff heading to the bottom. I drink it with pot roast and chips and that was fine but it is almost a dessert beer.

664,73,Harrison8,4.08,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty malts. It carries a light bitterness to the aroma, but it fades away as the beer warms a touch. Flavor profile is milk chocolate, cocoa nibs and caramel layered over roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty, caramely malts. It carries a distinct and notable bitterness, with the chocolate working to sooth that a touch. It becomes more balanced as the beer warms. Mouth feel is lightly creamy, with a medium-thin consistency. At warmer temperatures, the consistency thins out a touch with a more still texture as opposed to creamy. Overall, chocolate notes are pleasant with a light-bodied dark beer underneath.

664,73,LiquidAmber,4.1,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very, very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a one finger, ultra fine, light brown head with great retention and nice lacing. This was a can with a widget inside and the head is an excellent simulation of a nitro pour. Aroma of dark toasted and biscuit malt, milk chocolate; a hint of vanilla and coffee. Flavor follows, with slightly sweet, dark toasted malt, milk chocolate, a little vanilla and more roast and a slight coffee component in the finish. Luxuriously creamy medium body with great mouth feel. One of the classic chocolate stouts and deservedly so. A little lighter in flavor than I expected, but everything is mellow and well integrated. The chocolate is authentic tasting, but somewhat understated and the finish is a little drier than the initial taste. The creamy body enhances the balanced flavors and I would buy this widget can over any other format for that reason. Very pleasant and satisfying. Another beer that I've had many, many times, but never reviewed for some reason.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S - This is where the bulk of the chocolate hides, on the nose, especially when still chilled. Heavenly T - As it warms, those aromas of chocolate turn more oyster stout-like, and it does occasionally... F - lose a little CO2 carbonation as it warms, and seems watery by the end of the near-pint serving but still delicate.

The pour is black with some dark red tinges when held up to light. On the taste, I am picking up on the dark chocolate sweetness, some roasted malts, slight caramel.

Bubbly two finger light tan colored head settles to bubbly cap. Good area coverage of spotty lacing. There is a dark fruit component to both the aroma and the taste, which is quite comparable in expression to the different senses. Aroma also has dark malts and chocolate. Taste expresses a solid dark malt base, and lighter additions of chocolate and coffee. Sweetness on the light side. Thin to medium mouth feel. Very easy drinking.

A rather aggressive pour into a nonic pint glass yielded a ton of thick, soapy tan foam atop an almost ebony-colored body. Scads of sticky lacing as the head settled into a thick cap. This has a very nice roasty malt character, with lots of chocolate flavor as expected. There are also notes of tart fruit and dark roast coffee coming through as the beer warms toward room temperature. Medium light in body, not too sweet. Surprisingly dry finish, with a little lingering roasted coffee-bean bitterness. This is light enough, dry enough, and low enough in ABV to make it a great pairing with all kinds of food. Not overpowering, very drinkable. Although a little on the spendy side, it's worth an occasional splurge. Widely available in the U.S.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S: honestly, I expected more chocolate. Sam Smith's chocolate stout was overpoweringly chocolatey; this is not. That's not to say there is no chocolate here; there is - but it is subtle. This is also an old bottle. Chocolate smell is, of course, more pronounced as it warms. An almost almond-like note comes with it, and some coffee. Imagine a dark roast with a shot of almond syrup, black. Amaretto.  T: arrives malty, ever so barely sweet, slightly sour. Mid palate is roast and some floral English hop, turning slightly sour. Sweeter than Bell's Kalamazoo stout, less so than Left Hand.  M: lighter end of midweight, active but not overwhelming carbonation. Slick, but lighter weight and low ABV keep it drinkable.

The most obvious smell is roasted coffee beans and other toasted malts, alongside with the chocolate/cocoa scents to the brew. There's a hint of vanilla in there too. All of it smells very rich and sweet, the flavors dancing in the scent.  The taste has a prominent chocolate flavor, most notably milk chocolate however it's not overly sweet. Vanilla also is another key flavor. Others include cream, a staunch coffee presence, and slightly bitter hops. The myriad of different sweet flavors balance with the hops.

Smell: Balanced aroma of roasted coffee, toasted malts, caramel, chocolate, and cocoa as well, but overall the roasted malts dominate the others. I do not get much hops aroma.  Taste: Strong chocolate flavor. There is an interesting balance between the coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, and some bitterness from hops. The chocolate makes it sweet, but there is bitterness enhancing the taste and adding some complexity. There is a medium alcohol presence.  Mouth-feel: Medium alcohol, but with a very smooth and creamy body.  This is a nice, complex stout, and it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer.

The aroma had a ton of smooth sweet fudge-like milk chocolate tones. The flavor was the same with a semi-syrupy aftertaste of that chocolate. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with what I hate to say but a ""watery"" sort of finish. Carbonation did feel fine. ABV felt just as good.

664,73,DragonXero,4.78,"This is in competition for my favorite beer. I've noticed a lot of people talking about a nitro head and so on, but as far as I've ever tried this beer, it's been carbonated, the regular way. With carbon dioxide.  I've picked up a bottle of this for plenty of ""me"" times, because it's a great comfort beer. It's one of those fabled ""you can drink it a little colder than room temperature"" beers from England that we've all heard so much about. In fact, you really don't want it too cold, because the flavors are so varied and delicious.  Pouring this properly leads to a relatively weak head, especially for a relatively fizzy British beer, but you won't mind too much once you've had a few sips. The first whiff gives an almost woody inhale with a deceptively sweet finish, but the first quaff dispels the saccharine-sweet notion, replaced by a very-lightly sweetened, almost natural-tasting coffee flavor. This makes sense as cocoa and coffee aren't all that far off in terms of raw taste, with both being fairly bitter, robust pods originally drunk by dipping grindings with hot water. Both also contain caffeine, of course.  Others I've seen have compared this to Guinness. Why, I can only imagine. I'm guessing they may only have ever tried the Irish staple before and have no other stouts to compare this British great to. Perhaps in England this is served with a similar nitrogen bubble, but in the U.S., it seems to always be properly carbonated. It is a little flat compared to macro lagers, but against your standard pretentious microbrew, this is fairly carbonated. It's no soda, but it's definitely not a nearly-flat Guinness.  The mouthfeel, aside from the carbonation, is quite thick and creamy. It earns the term ""milk stout"". I remember as a younger man, hearing people often saying that Guinness is a meal in a can, but this stout is a 4-course royalty dinner in a bottle. You're not so much drinking as chewing this beer, which is actually rather enjoyable in this case.  Someday, when I don't feel like I'm wasting my money, I want to try this as a float. With Ice Cream. Until then, I'll continue to save up and buy a bottle when I get a chance. I suggest you do the same if you're looking for something tasty, different, and impressive. Dark as hell, thick, delicious, and still quite small. It's worth the ~5 dollars.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The beer was black enough that I could not see any ruby notes around the base of my tulip glass.  The smell was pretty basic with some bitter chocolate, like bakers chocolate, and some hints of coffee.  The taste was much like the nose with that bitter chocolate and some coffee. The chocolate was sweetened somewhat by the lactose and nitro that made it just a bit sweeter than straight bakers chocolate.  Mouth feel was a medium creaminess with a wet finish. And also note because of that nitro the beer, in my opinion, tastes flat and blah.  I did not realize I was getting nitro cans and was dissapointed when I went to get the beer out of the fridge and heard that widget rattling around in the can. Sorry to all the folks that like them I just think that nitro kills the beer. Give me carbonation over that flat nitro flavor any day of the week.

664,73,Lucaskowalik,4.27,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a snifter L- Darkest brown with almost no light coming through. Mocha tinged head typical of the style S- Rich and creamy chocolate, caramel, hazelnuts, espresso, actually smells a bit like a Caramilk chocolate bar. Also detecting a subtle pear smell. T- The most velvety chocolate on first sip accompanied by espresso, caramel, toasted nuts, and cream. Maybe too heavy on the malts though F- Incredibly creamy with a nice dry finish although i would prefer a more full body.

664,73,ajm5108,3.8,"Classic velvety nitro pour with lush head. Medium dry baker's chocolate on the nose with a little wet malt behind it. Taste is just some medium roasted malt and some milk chocolate. Understated, maybe to a fault as none of the flavors really assert themselves. That said, there is nothing off about it and it checks all the boxes, Could have been creamier on the feel.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,matcris,4.34,"Black, a little ruby edge up to the light, and a lasting tan head with good lacing down the glass. Nose is big Tootsie Rolls. The flavor is a little cola-like at first, then big chocolate kicks in mid-palate. A nice subtle bitterness takes over from there and you get a nice combo of bitter and sweet chocolate. Slightly creamy and oily, dry on the finish, average carbonation, and medium thin body. Overall, it reminds me a bit of Boulder's Shake Chocolate Porter, with that big Tootsie roll vibe. Nice stuff.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ZagZagg,3.27,"440 mL nitro can into globe  A: An aggressive pour yields a bodacious one and a half finger cream head with some light cascading. 100% opaque, deep granite. Very strong retention (impressive).  S: Light, creamy, mellow roasted malts. Has a particular dairy character, reminiscent of a milk stout? Undertones of caramel, traces of date following with notes of hazelnut. Prevalent coco essence blended with mulled raisins.  T: Does not betray the nose, sweet, almost as a coffee creamer. Repressed nuttiness, but teaming with malt character. A lot of milk chocolate play, with a certain level of pruininess. Not something I would call complex, and lacking a desired roasted facet. A little too much of a diacetyl profile. Finish is overly confectious, and overwhelmed by a lactic presence.  M: Way too light in my opinion, even if this was classified as a milk stout. Almost watery. The body is good, thanks to the nitro, light, frappe, easy drinking.  O: Not a favorite. There isn’t much else to say. Look to Left Hand.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Feel is medium thickness, tingly and dry.  Overall - Pretty OK chocolate stout, nothing too special about it to separate it from other chocolate stouts. I prefer chocolate stouts to be sweet, and this one doesn't have that level of sweetness I look for.

664,73,rodbeermunch,4.12,"Very dark brown look to it, has that oily edge. This might say ""double"" in the title, but I believe that is in regard to the amount of chocolate or chocolate malt going on here, not the abv or overall strength of the beer itself. Now that is out of the way, lets talk about the aroma, no the head, good 3/4"" tan small bubbled head. An aroma evocative of chocolate malt for sure. A little bit of barley behind that.  Taste, wow, the lactose in this and chocolate malt make for a very chocolate forward beer without the use of any actual chocolate. Right? This doesn't actually have the adjunct chocolate? Its chocolate malt and lactose, and they work well. You never have the roasty edge in this one, that's why I said oily and stuff. Pretty sessionable.

Smell is of chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, slight mocha roastiness. Taste reflects the smell. Initial chocolate and dark chocolate flavors lead into a pleasant roastiness that finishes with a cocoa powder flavor that lingers for a short while. Feel is a bit thin, carbonated fine.

The smell of Young’s Double Chocolate Stout is rich with roasted grains , malts and hops. There is also a nice amount of sweetness in the smell of this brew. More than likely from the chocolate. Now for the taste it is bold with flavors. You first pick up the smoothness of roasted grains ,malts. Then there is a nice sweetness smoothness at the end of this brew. There is alot going on in Young's Double Chocolate Stout. This brew has a real super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is.

There was so much going on that I'd never experienced in a beer before. 2 thumbs up!  Look: Black, like your ex girlfriend heart. Just kidding, she doesn't have a heart, do you... Elaine?!! but, I digress.  Very nice off white creamy head that stayed constant the whole time I was drinking from my grandfathers handle mug he won by winning a lawn bowls competition.  Smell: Ahhh, The fine bouquet of chocolate malt. Not too strong yet strong enough with just a hint of cocoa.  Taste. Once again that chocolate malt comes through, not overpowering and not cloying like some stouts can be. Rich and yet subtly sweet and smooth. I could drink it all day and night through winter.  Feel: creamy, very creamy. Almost like drinking the flavored topping you put on your ice cream. Not as thick of course. It has that hard feel to it though. Exactly what you'd expect from a good stout claiming to be a good stout.  OA: As I stated; this was my first chocolate stout. I found it very easy to drink, something even non-initiated stout drinkers could enjoy. The roasting is pleasant and not like your drinking a camp fire (which I don't mind at all) followed by the perfectly balanced sweetness of 80% pure cocoa. Great mouth feel and a pleasure to watch the lacing as it creates a terraced garden effect down the side of the glass after each swallow.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,travis3113,4.82,L: What a dark and tasty looking beverage. Super creamy head with some nice brown color to it. Almost black.  S: Aroma is outstanding. Tons of coffee and chocolate with great malt character.  T: Tastes wonderful! Each mouthful is an experience. It coats the entire palate with rich chocolate and coffee flavors with a touch of bitter on the finish.  F: Very rich and full feel. Not too much carbonation but not too little either like some other stouts. The only time there is a slight thinness is just as you are swallowing.... Time for another sip!  O: Very enjoyable overall.

It's a creamy, drinkable chocolate stout that isn't artificially or chemically enhanced. It's been around a while, so I assumed it'd be good or be living off reputation.

I rated the look slightly lower because I think the labeling could be more intricate, but the color and the richness of the flavor does match the typography. I drank this in the bottle because I often drink dark beers in the bottle. I drink this beer because I'm breastfeeding, and stouts are known to up milk production. the flavor and smell had a rich and chocolatey-espresso taste just as I expected, not too sweet or carbonated. it was an artificial but it was still pretty decent for my liking, although that's simply a matter of preference.

664,73,Secret,2,"I got the nitro cans, as some others did, and it must be emphasized- in fact it can not be emphasized enough- that it was a terrible experience. This stout did not live well in a can, and did not retain carbonation or head even in spite of the nitro. Went completely, and I mean COMPLETELY flat in seconds. I've had stouts that were not marketed as chocolate, which had more flavor of chocolate, and it was so tart that I couldn't help wondering how they even called this a stout. I've had lemon shandies that weren't this acidic. I might try from a bottle later, but based on my experience with the can, it would have to be almost an entirely different beer, to pay import prices. Unless you're living in the UK, where this cheap, or have some kind of youthful nostalgia, it is not remotely worth the (roughly) $15 the six bottles will cost you in the US.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,JoLight,3.81,"Appearance: Thin, khaki head that dissipates into a sizable ring of foam. Nice lacing. Blackish body, with hues of brown.  Aroma: Very strong, with emphasis on the upfront notes of sweet grain (it's heavy on the grain), and that sweet, typical malty stout aroma. I detect a minute amount of some kind of chocolate note half-way through the drink, and as it warms. But it remains mostly sweet, grainy, and dark-roasted.  Taste: the taste is light overall, and is slightly watery. It's very grainy—toasted grains, little maltiness. It reminds me a great deal of a hearty black lager, to be honest.  Mouthfeel: creamy, light side of medium.  Overall, I am slightly disappointed with this beer. I was expecting more chocolate notes on the palate.

APPEARANCE: pitch black body, as expected; rocky, creamy, substantial three-finger brown head; lacing webs and spreads like camouflage; handsome... AROMA: beautifully milky, creamy chocolate with some almond and vanilla; extremely peaty and toasty... PALATE: smooth as silk; a bit slick; mellow and purely drinkable--a nice, creamy stout that ends with a slightly gritty finish...TASTE: as chocolately and toasty as this is, it is the secondary flavors of hops that inject a nuanced dimension to the stout; lactic and chocolate, back at the end...OVERALL: having binged on this all night in a Brooklyn bar some years ago, I can attest first-hand to its sessionability; drinking a singular bottle in the comfort of my own home, I can attest to its deservedly solo treatment.. the only downer could be the price: $4.99 for a 16oz.er is a bit much, but if it's ever on tap and on special ...",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerWatcher,4.63,"Pours an opaque dark brown, bordering on black, with some slight deep red hi-lights when extremely backlit. Moderate, mocha head, settling rapidly to a thin film, which does not mute the aromas at all. And what aromas! Dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, and cafe au lait, are the most predominant on the nose. The mouth feel is velvety smooth, bringing tastes that fulfill the promises of the aromas. There is the addition of some medium bitterness on the swallow. This is the type of chocolatey stout I often crave, and this one delivers big time. In a word....outstanding!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Otowi,2.28,"This used to be a really good double chocolate stout.  Now they have added what they call ""real chocolate flavouring"", wich from what I gather is some sort of artificial flavouring, and it shows.  It pours pitch black, and has a chocolate and coffee armoa wich is quite pleasant. But it stops there.  The flavour is very artificial, and not what it used to be. This used to be a favourite, but not anymore, wich is a damned shame.  I do not know why they added artificial flavouring, but it has ruined a real nice beer indeed.  Hope they remove this bad artificial flavouring, and return to what this used to be, a great brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CraftBeerTastic,3.64,"Ba Review #288 Served On: 01/23/2015 Glassware: Duvel Glass Labeled AVB: 5.2% Date/ Code: 04/28/14  Got this one in a beer trade with a neighbor. Have wanted to hit this one up for a decade now.  Look: Pitch-black appearance. Initial 2-fingers of frothy sand-colored head with mostly big bubbles. Head reduced down to a thin coating within moments while leaving some random patches of thin lacing on the Duvel glass. Carbonation bubbles were scarce but present through the murky darkness.  Smell: Deep dark roasted cocoa bean. Creamy espresso coffee character. Faint hints of butterscotch as the glass was pulled away. A delicate confectionery quality was also detected, that of a chilled tiramisu. Most likely from the milk stout component of this brew.  Taste: Started with a thinner mouth feel than expected. Notes of dark chocolate and coffee upfront. The middle had some slight bitterness, like in a baker’s cocoa; definitely not overboard on the sweetness here. The finish was clean with some traces of chocolate and a dryness coming though. Aftertaste was similar to that of black coffee.  This was a beer that holds true to the English styles: nothing over the top, yet very high quality. Was expecting a little more mouth feel as the bottle claims oats were used and the word ‘double’ is in the name. Either way a solid brew for a nice treat during the cold winter months here in the Mid-Atlantic.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,johnnyapollo,4.16,"Creamy stout with hints of chocolate, small head from the tap at ""The Pub"" at Perimeter Mall in Sandy Springs north oh Atlanta.

664,73,WoodButcher,4.46,"This pours an almost black color. Hold it to the light and there are no hues that shine through. This is black like used oil. Mmmmm. The head is a dense tan, creamy with some larger bubbles that leave a lot of lacing on the glass.  Smell is a bit muted, but has chocolate and coffee tones.  Taste is like the nose, but much more pronounced. The coffee and chocolate are followed by a slight hop bitterness with some smokiness and mild tobacco. This is truly yummy and with low alcohol makes a fine session beer with some rich foods (or without).  The mouthfeel is fine carbonation, but with a nitro pour it is like silk. This is one great beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,interzen,4.48,"500ml bottle poured into a standard pint glass  Look: Opaque black with a bubbly tan/khaki head - the head has a fair bit of retention and leaves behind a fair bit of lacing. When I say 'opaque' I mean exactly that - hold it up to the light and you'll see nothing but blackness. It's a stout alright.  Smell: Roasted malts and dark chocolate - for me, the benchmark chocolate stout is Sam Smiths, and the Youngs doesn't have that in-yer-face chocolatiness that the Sams has, and it also has a few more dark fruity notes.  Taste: Roasted malts up front with the chocolate flavours following fairly close behind. Some slight bitterness but the chocolate/malt flavours are dominant. Again, not as full-on chocolatey as Sam Smiths but pretty damned good.  Feel: Good stout feel - carbonation isn't too excessive and it goes down extremely smoothly.  Overall: For me, Sam Smiths make the perfect chocolate stout - this runs it fairly close but doesn't quite match it in my opinion. It's probably worth pointing out that I'm definitely a stout fan and, along with the Sam Smiths Organic Chocolate Stout, this is going to become a regular on my shelf.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The taste was basically the same and had a sly coffee/chocolate aftertaste leading to the same sort of finish.

664,73,BeerDrinkersWorldTour,4.27,Appearance - Deeply dark with a heavy 2 finger head of dirty tobacco foam head supported by light streaming CO2 comprised of tiny bubbles. the head has good retention but eventually dies off to a sticky lace cover and clings to the side of the glass.  Smell - Very heavy chocolate aroma as you would expect from the name of the beer. Some toffee like aroma and some bitter coffee hints in the back end.  Taste - Deeply chocolaty and very well balanced between sweet and bitter elements. There are some burnt characteristics in here but the beer is essentially exactly what it promises to be. Also some very sweet Rum or Porte like elements are in here... I wish I could be more specific in this respect but I am not much of a drinker when it comes to anything other than beer but this one does reminds me of rum in some ways.  MF - Mildly metallic and astringent at the start in the mouth this beer is medium bodied and has plenty of tingle with a drying finish. The beer is also pretty creamy as it goes down.  Overall - A very good beer that seems to do more or less exactly what it is setting out to do.

There are also some hints of roasted malts. The finish is slightly bitter. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied, smooth and a bit thin on the palate; the finish feels somewhat dry.

Look: Very dark brown colour. Nice thick light brown head that disappears after a while leaving a thick lace.  Smell: Well, the name gives it away, it smells of chocolate and malt. Coffee also is quite strong (maybe even more than chocolate).  Taste: Bouchet and aftertaste of chocolate, here the coffee is less present. Very strong also the bitterness of the hops, that gets stronger during the aftertaste.  Feel: Reeeeally smooth and drinkable, despite being rather complex and bitter. Medium low carbonation. Probably the feel would benefit from drinking it at a lower temperature (well, I chose a compromise).  Overall: extremely pleasant, can be enjoyed with a variety of foods (I drank mine with french cheeses and a salad and it was fitting perfectly).

However, the smell isn't very robust; it's quite moderate by my standards. More malt would give the beer a better smell.  T: Very good. Mellow coffee gives way to milk chocolate. Many beers have a bitter aftertaste; this beer is the exact opposite. The aftertaste is one of solid milk-chocolate and this gives the beer a highly-drinkable quality.  M: As with many English pub ales, the mouthfeel is a little light for my liking. While the head is rich and creamy, the body is quite light and watery. Would've liked a much fuller mouthfeel.

Milk and cream up front and mid palate; a layer of roasted and toasted malts throughout, featuring chocolate, caramel, and toffee notes; very bitter dark cacao on the back end. There's a hint of sweetness, but very little. Bracing, earthy bitterness.  Fairly thin but oily mouthfeel. There's plenty of bite, but that's not what I'm looking for in a beer called Double Chocolate Stout. Fairly smooth and creamy.

Smell - It actually smells like a semi-sweet chocolate bar (I'm not kidding).  Taste - It tastes like a semi-sweet chocolate bar, too!  Mouth - Oily. A bit tart. Good carbonation. Substantial.  Overall - A nice, malty stout with just a touch of bitterness. Despite the big nose and roasted malt flavor, the beer is relatively light and easy drinking. The beer reminds me, a little, of a German Doppelbock.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,misternebbie,4.58,"revisiting this beer after about a year still one of the finest , stouts on the market, the double chocolate in name is a little misleading, chocolate is natural and faint. much better in the Nitro can ,than in the bottle.

Taste is, as the bottle says, silky rich and creamy smooth. Reminded me a little of a root beer float. However, there is not much real flavor behind all that silky smoothness. Malt, some dark chocolate and roasted flavors, but overall a bland feel to it. Good mouthfeel, but it really left my tastebuds wondering when the real flavor would hit. Some lingering finish, but no real standout tones. Probably the kind of stout my wife would like, since she doesn't drink stouts. Decent, but not memorable other than the rootbeer float like creamyness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kfh227,3.26,color - I'd say black if it were not. It is definitely a brown color but you can not tell unless you look at it in a glass for a while. No head. Very Opaque.  Taste - good. Not a great chocolate beer. The chocolate in it is not a good taste. I'll probably have it again but not soon.  Smell - Nose isn't working lately.  Mouthfeel - nice and heavy as it should be with this type of beer in my opinion.  Overall - One of the few beers where I put the mouthfeel as a bigger draw to have this beer again than the taste. I usually care about taste most and smell a distant second.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,djsnowman06,3.95,"“Chocolate malt and real dark chocolate are combined with Young's award-winning rich dark beer to craft a satisfyingly indulgent, but never overly sweet experience. Silky rich & creamy smooth.”  Appearance Very black and very opaque, with low levels of carbonation. Produced only a quarter inch of yellow head. The retention was okay; dissipated within a couple minutes, but a nice ring lace stuck around for much longer.  Smell Hard to say. On the malts, I got just a sweet, roasty chololate aroma, and the hops had very little leafy scent, if any.  Taste Whoa. The chocolate is very prevalent. Also some roast at the back and maybe some caramel or toffee. Again the hops were hard to detect, maybe a little leafy or grassy taste.  Mouth-feel Flirting with the heavy side. It had good carbonation for its style. A smooth drink with a touch of a buttery feel. Screams “Dessert”  Overall Impression I had this sitting in my fridge for 5 days while I went out of town. While I am impressed with this beer , I may have hyped it up a little in my own head, maybe a touch let down. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice beer. There is a little aroma of chocolate but man does it ever come out in the tasting. I also probably served it too cold; I really should set up a dedicated beer fridge. Even still, the aroma only intensified mildly as it warmed. Was not overly sweet and was certainly indulgent, just as the label claims. Would make an excellent dessert beer. I also think that it would be a fantastic beer on nitrogen, just to amplify the creamy texture they were trying to achieve. Overall I was very happy with this superb beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Gear54,4.31,From a bottle into a pint glass  A: pour is extremely dark with no light penetration. Two fingers if this head kaki in color. The head fades quickly for how thick it was. Sticky lace rings all the way down the glass.  S: roasted malts and tons of chocolate and sweet notes.  T: taste follows smell well. This is sort of like drinking smoky chocolate milk with carbonation. Not exactly what I expected but it's a really tasty extremely complex beer. The malts and smoke and coffee and chocolate complement each other really well.  M: my only complaint is that the flavors don't stick around longer. It would be a bit easier to rap your head around all the complex flavor if t lasted a bit longer in the tung.  O: fantastic!,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

But, no, this is actually chocolate beer. I usually like beers with fruit, funk, yeast, sourness, spices, or other unusual elements. And I like porters and stouts, with Old Rasputin being one of my regular faves. But this stuff? If you like the idea of chocolate milk mixed with beer, maybe youll like this. Me?

664,73,BrunoPettipas,4.42,"Had this beer late night on a sunday to get some strenght for the coming week. The label and the shape of the bottle really screams sweet promises of decadent stout. Poured the beer in a pint glass with a widget which keeps the head a bit longer with the constant streams of bubbles.  Small 1/2'' tanny head that doesn't stay very long. Color is deep black with the color taking more of a very dark brown when held up to a light. Seems pretty clear and opaque. First smell reveals a nice balance of smoked malts with some bittersweet chocolate mixed in. I get a faint nutty sweetness on the end.  It' got a good thickness. I might have liked a bit more but thats my taste. It does leave your mouth quite coated in stout goodness.  Now for taste, I get the smoked taste up front with the mid sweet chocolate following closely. I must admit that the first sip left me wanting for a bit more. I get a slight peppery end from time to time which is not so bad. A tiny trace of hops that rounds out the sweetness and add a bitter bark. Aftertaste is slight coffee with the chocolate coming back.  The chocolate caracter of this beer really intensify the warmer the beer gets so I would let it sit for a while if your just pulling it out from the fridge. I also found that the more you drink it, the more the chocolate creeps up on you. Really nice. It does deserve the name Double Chocolate.  Had some Bobbas Bounty loaded in a Kayfun while having this beer. It brought out some nice graham crackers and even chocolate.  Overall a good decadent stout thats well worth the reputation. Get one!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tlennon0815,3.99,"Youngs double chocolate stout surprised me in a very pleasant way! The appearance is that of a dark stout. Smell is roasted malts with very strong scent of a bittersweet chocolate. Taste is by far the best part, with bittersweet bakers chocolate coming up front along with the malt, with a slightly bitter hit at the end. The chocolate stays with you throughout the entire experience. Excellent beer for desert or with a hearty meal.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,dmgeng,3.69,"This was recommended to me by a dark beer drinking friend that said I had to try it.  A - Nice black color typical of a stout. Very clear for a dark beer. Awesome nitro induced super fine off-white head that seemed to stay forever and trail lacing down the entire glass.  S - Tons of chocolate both milk and dark with roasted and malty smells bringing up the back. The nitro can seemed to really accentuate the rich chocolate tones.  T - A very chocolately and sweet brew as the name suggests very similar to a hot chocolate that was cold or a chocolate milk shake without the milk or as much sugar. There is a roasted flavor that comes second and some alcohol third but the chocolate nature holds supreme. Only a slight inclination that you are even drinking a beer since it is really sweet and roasty. Some bitterness from the roasted malt but no discernible hops. A good desert beer if that is all you are going to have.  M - Thick mouth-feel it is sticky and cloying that coats your mouth in the dark beer. Really no balance and I couldn't drink more than one . Moderate ""nitration"" that makes it silky and smooth but the grain bill makes it sticky.  Overall, a good beer if you want a sweet cocoa inspired beer that is very novel. Similar to a milk stout with the sweetness and mouth-feel but is very chocolatey for a beer. It's definitely not my favorite but I know that there would be a time and a place to have this again. I did love the nitro can with plastic balls inside. Getting drunk while everyone is drinking a milk shake seems like a good time for this beer.

664,73,archyquaffer,4.5,"Poured out of a 440 ml (15 ounce) nitro-can into a shaker pint glass. There isn't as much pressure as opening a Guinness, so I go with a moderate pour which produces a solid one inch head, with the usual extra-creamy pale tan cascading head. The color is a very dark ruddy brown that scarcely admits the light of a Mini-Maglite flashlight.  Very strong and delicious chocolate aroma-flavor right off the bat, which smooths out as the beer progresses (but never really fades), allowing some nice roasted coffee and nutty flavors to emerge. You can taste some very obvious hazelnut and even pecan tones with some butteriness underlying it all. All in all, this is like eating a dank brownie made of organic goodness. Chocoholics will love this.  This is quite possibly the best sweet stout I've ever tried and I give it very high marks. It is hands down the best chocolate beer I've tried. Purchased as part of a four pack of 440 ml cans for right around 9-something. I want to pass on some kudos to Hennessey Market in Butte, Montana for bringing more variety in all good things, most especially in beer.

664,73,The_Stav,4.53,"This beer has a lovely dark brown/black color with a nice stout head, actually milk stout I believe. As the name suggests, this has a light and wonderful smell of chocolate. Tasting, the light chocolate continues along with roasted malts, maybe coffee.  It's a shame that we can't rate the bottle and the nitro can separately. The bottle is a fine brew, but the nitro can gives a much better mouthfeel with the nitrogen replacing much of the carbonation. The much lower carbonation (i.e. less carbonic acid) seems to improve the flavor as well. I much more enjoy the nitro can version and rate this at least a 4.5 (the bottle version is 4.0 or 4.25)  As the label notes, this is ""Pure Luxury"" and one of my all time favorites. Every now and then, it is worth it to me to pay the extra buck or two (for four-pack cans) to drink the Young's Double Chocolate versus the old standard Guinness Stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The head rose quickly enough that I couldn't pour the whole 500 mL at once. Had to sip and wait for the head to settle before being able to finish the bottle. Head seemed to retain pretty well, taking several minutes to come down to 1cm or so.  Smell over the head is an inviting, bready smell.  Taste: Unfortunately, a slightly metallic start, but the character was a slightly chocolatey breadiness, as expected. A little on the bitter side, but not by too much.

Some people hate on nitrogen being used in place of CO2 when serving beer, but I am not one of them.

The nitrous yields a super-smooth head which accompanies the body of the beer on the pour with the bubbles cascading downwards before billowing upwards and forming ranks as the pour finishes. The head is wonderfully creamy; it reminds me of the very fine foam you get when blending milkshakes. Sexy beer.  S – Cocoa powder, melted Cadbury’s milk chocolate, faint roastiness and a smidgen of malt.  T – Surprisingly bitter, definitely more towards the cocoa powder end of the chocolate spectrum. Not as sweet as Sam Smith’s. Sort of reminds me of a fuller-bodied, less-watery, chocolaty Guinness. Quite mild in flavour.  M – Insanely smooth as indicated by its appearance. It’s definitely creamy, but by the end of the glass the mild flavour and low carbonation flirt with blandness and sickliness.  O – I like this beer and I’d buy it more often at the right price. However for this to be a beer which really blows me away it would need to have a sweeter aspect, more intense flavour, heavier body to balance the smoothness of the carbonation which all in all would probably also involve a higher abv.

664,73,Bidcaller2,4.12,"I was recommended this beer by a friend and he was spot on. It pours a dark chocolate color that light doesn't permeate and has a nice tan light head that doesn't linger long.  The smell is what you would expect, of dark chocolate with a hint of coffee and a bit smokey. This stout has no bitter bite, is slightly sweet and very smooth. For a Stout it is light in the mouth and leaves no filmy residue.

S: The nose gives a massive blast of chocolate followed by toasted and dark roasted malt, sweet and milky(?).  T: The taste follows and is dominated by dark and milk chocolate notes, milky sweet and dark roasted malt. The finish dries out with some hop bitterness, but is very short and the flavor falls off a bit too soon for me.  M: Medium body and carbonation; silky and smooth.  O: A delicious sweet stout with a great body, especially considering its 5% ABV and is very drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Lacing was all over the glass...very nice  Smell- I got a slight cocoa-ish smell, but seemed to smell like any other stout  Taste- The taste was not what I was expecting at all. I tasted nothing chocolate, nothing really sweet, basically I got a beer that tasted like a re-labeled GUINNESS...not fond of the flavoring  Mouthfeel- Slightly reminiscent of chewing on a tire just after a 10 second burnout, like I said with the taste, the mouthfeel is the same as the taste, Guinness-like.  Overall, definitely would not seek this one out again, unless it has been changed to include some carbonation or gained some bitterness.

Just a tad bit of smoke  M: Silky smooth. Easy to take deep pulls and the palate stays clean because of the mild dry finish  O: A really really tasty beverage.

664,73,thecheapies,3.96,"Looks dark and milky. No light will pass. Head looks okay. Small, but gathers along the glass wall.  Sweet vanilla and dark chocolate and semi-dark and sweet maltiness. Lots of additives, I guess. Hints of dark cherry. Liqueury. Like a roasty cordial. Maybe, even, hints of black raspberry. It totally works for 'decadent'.  Nice and rich flavors with dark chocolate, dark fruit, light vanilla, roasted malts, and slight bitter hop; on the mind. Offers up some creaminess without the lacticity. Not particularly tangy, which I like in a milk stout. English toffee is grand, but semi-dry, with all of the sweetness coming from the vanilla and the chocolate.  Very soft, if not too light. The body is nothing to speak of, really, and the carbonation doesn't do a whole lot more. Just a simple drink, for a good beer.  How can you not dig this stout? It's tasty and aromatic and subtly decadent.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Appearance - Thick black, with off tan head about 1.5 fingers worth of head that recedes somewhat quickly. Good lacing left on the glass.  Smell - Sweet, dark chocolate dominates and a butterscotch undertone in there. Obviously smells like a luxurious dessert platter.  Taste - Chocolaty, but never overly so. Very nice and well balanced flavors, but a bit one dimensional. Slight bitter dark chocolate aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy, heavy bodied which works very well here.  Overall - Definitely a good beer that would gladly drink again, but personally I didn't see what separated this from many other stouts other than a slightly more chocolate-centric beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bareju,3.81,"Poured 500mL bottle into mug.  A: Very dark, opaque chocolate brown. Poured with a finger tan head, lingered. Decent lacing.  S: I can definitely smell the chocolate, but it's not terribly strong. Accompanied by roasted malts and maybe the slightest hint of coffee. Some other smells I can't quite put my finger on.  T: Bitter coffee followed by smooth chocolate and roasted malts, can taste a slight hoppy bitterness in the middle before it's quickly overwhelmed by chocolate, which recedes and leaves a pleasant bitter chocolate aftertaste. Very smooth and sweet. As the beer warmed, it became smoother and sweeter, which seemed to tone down and smooth the flavor profile, especially highlighting a nice milk chocolate flavor.  M: Medium body, good amount of carbonation as well. Leaves a light coating on the mouth, which carries the bitter hop flavors.  O: Solid, easy drinking stout. Does well to include chocolate flavors in an easy drinking beer. Could easily drink a few of these. I also think this would be incredible with nitro, I'll have to pick up some nitro cans.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Not much chocolate taste or smell at all compared to Smith's. However this is a very drinkable beer and I could have easily had 2 or 3 of these without any fatigue. The lack of any real chocolate taste or sweetness was the only letdown for me. The label was right when they say that this beer is not meant to be overly sweet. Was not sweet at all.

It pours pitch black with little to no head, but I had it in a bottle and not the draft can which would give it a nice creamy head. There is a chocolate aroma and a taste almost of chocolate milk but with a slight bitterness in the end. The bitterness lingers on the palate to give it a dark chocolate finish and keep it from being overly sweet.

Really has that gourmet dark chocolate balance of sweet and bitter. Leaves a sweet bitterness lingering on my tung to savor.

Pretty tasty imo.  M- Medium body that is a touch watery, was expecting something much heavier and full. You can fell the body, but it turns watery quite quick.  O- Ive only had a few chocolate stouts, but this one so far was the best. It was in a bottle dated 10-12 and this is 10-13, maybe the extra ageing added to the balance and flavor, because I did not notice any bite or alcohol burn, and It had quite a chocolate character.

664,73,spoony,4.14,"From a 500 ml bottle (date code was smudged and illegible) into a snifter.  A-The brew is dark, dark brown...nearly black. The head from my aggressive pour is two fingers tall and mocha-colored. Retention is good (roughly two minutes and there is still a cap) and there is some fluffy lacing on the glass.  S-The smell is pleasing and balanced. There are nice suggestions of roasted barley and oats, along with lots (double?) of milk chocolate and dark chocolate. There is a little bit of lactic sweetness, but compared to some chocolate stouts, this is one is on the drier side.  T-The taste, like the smell, has a good smooth hit of roasted oats and barley flavors. The oats, in particular, fit well with the rest of flavors and are not overdone. Chocolate flavor is also strong, but the beer fades towards slightly bitter hops on the finish, which keeps it from being cloying. The lactic sweetness is light to moderate.  M-The brew is lighter and more thin-feeling than many of the style. It is still a smooth drinker, but I wouldn't call it creamy.  O-What a nice dessert beer. It is sweet, but not syrupy or sugary, and the double chocolate is similarly dry and milky, without verging into bitterness or coffee flavors. This is not some massively complicated barrel aged monster, but it is a pretty delicious and easy-to-drink beer.

664,73,AmishLightning,3.7,"Appearance: Surprising little head for a stout. I guess the added adjuncts help to keep that down. It pours very thick, almost looks like a syrup going into the glass. Bubbles from carbonation make the beer look a lot thicker than expected. When swirled around it doesn't seem as viscous as expected. Pitch black color.  Smell: Lots of roasted malts with maybe an expresso-coffee hint present. Not a lot of chocolate flavors on the nose. Really not a lot of chocolate aroma at all.  Taste: Rather disappointing. I really expected this beer to be more of a dessert beverage. When you pick up a double chocolate stout you think DOUBLE the chocolate. Apparently young's doesn't see it that way or their normal chocolate stout has nothing to begin with. Most prevalent flavors are the roasted malts which are quite sweet and hints of expresso. The chocolate flavoring does appear if you get the liquid in the back of your mouth, but even then it doesn't really knock your socks off. More chocolate flavoring would be needed to please me for this specific beer.  Mouthfeel: Not nearly as thick as it appeared which was surprising. Quite thin for a stout. Moderate smoothness helped with the flow.  Overall: Not what I was expecting, but not in a good way. I was hoping for a choco beer and turned out with a normal stout.

Taste: Roast malt shows up first but is quickly followed by sweet, creamy chocolate. Slight bitterness from roast malt shows up again in the finish. I get a slight metallic astringency as well, but it seems to disappear as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, super creamy.  Overall: An old favorite from time spent in England, this is first time I've had this from a can.

S- &gt;80% Cacao chocolate and dark roasty malts with a smidgen of sweetness in the background; similar to vanilla.  T- Roasted malts and dark roast coffee up front with an appropriate bitter finish that resembles a beautiful dark chocolate.

664,73,whitty,5,This is my perfect beer. Dark rich beer that carbonates to a full rich head which delivers a strong and rich aroma of a proper stout. Its appearance also delivers on taste. A rich stout with a subtle chocolate taste if not also coffee. I have introduced many to this beer and have never had any complaints.

664,73,artoolemomo,3.66,"Appearance- Pours up a bunch of head in a slow but beautiful rush. The head appears to have good retention and is a light creamy beige. The body is a dark chocolate black that is opaque. And when I write that this has good retention, I really mean that this is downright obstinate. A good amount of lacing is left behind.  Nose- Very typical nitro can aroma. Small hints of smoke and roasted malts. Think Guinness. Stronger notes of chocolate and roasted malts from the can. Roasted notes become stronger from the glass as I await the stubborn head to dissipate.  Taste- Roasted notes with a slight sourness begin the flavor profile. A slight bitter chocolate flits around the edges. Slight coffee on the finish. A bit thin such that it lacks presence and complexity. Really pretty boring. Chocolate that tastes more of cocoa hangs around the edges and underneath the finish. Not bad but nowhere near impressive. An above average stout. Honestly, I would prefer a Guinness or a Murphy's.  Mouthfeel- Fairly smooth but also a little bit watery. The finish is dry and the carbonation is rather minimal. Probably the best aspect of this beer.  Drinkability- Very easy going. It's so smooth that it practically drinks itself. Only problem- Guinness and Murphy's are cheaper.  Overall- Above average milk stout. Nothing that amazes but still a highly drinkable beer.

Feel: I can't imagine how smooth this would be on nitro. Very mild carbonation, super smooth, easy drinking. Fantastic.  Brief review, but it doesn't need to be long...

664,73,Hermanater,3.86,A few points off for appearance but only b/c Rivertowne Northshore served it in a plastic frat cup. Little disappointed with that and it shouldn't reflect negatively on the beer so I offer the appearance score only based on what I've had from the nitro-can prior and the head from my latest experience with the beer at Rivertowne.  AP: thick and creamy head. I bet you could stand a spoon up in the stuff or even shape it. Very inviting.  AR: bittersweet chocolate is obvious to the nose as well as heavily roasted malt characteristics.  M: incredibly silky smooth. Milkshake like viscosity!  T: The chocolate stout that sets the standard for others. I highly recommend trying this from the nitro-tap if you get the chance.

Leaves consistent and strong lacing down the glass.  Aroma: Dark chocolate, a bit of sweet malt, some minor roastiness. I didn't get quite as much of a ""hit"" as I was expecting.  Taste: A bit chocolaty, almost like a good dark chocolate but with a touch more sweetness, but nowhere near as much as I would have thought. I little bit of coffee roastiness in the background, and slight toffee hints also. Had a weird and slightly harsh bitter aftertaste in the upper palate.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium-low carbonation. Probably a bit too thin for the style in my opinion.  Overall: I was disappointed to be honest, but my expectations were high. It is not a bad stout, that is for sure, however it falls short of the mark in too many areas. The aroma isn't nearly strong enough, the chocolate taste isn't nearly prominent enough, there is not enough sweetness for a sweet-stout, the body was too thin, and subtle but weird harsh aftertaste.

664,73,Kuaff,3.95,"I poured a bottle of this into a mug at cellar temperature.  It's very nearly opaque black, but not quite. A two-finger tan head.  The aroma is fantastic. Smells like really high-quality hot cocoa! Definitely on the milky sweet side of chocolate scents. Very enticing.  This is a pretty tasty stout, but it's a little unbalanced and leaves me wanting more. It has quite a bit of tartness (maybe a little too much), and while it's a BIT chocolaty, I'd definitely prefer a more intense chocolate taste. Hmm... maybe I'm just too accustomed to imperial stouts. It has a slightly roasty aftertaste, but once again: a little too subdued for my liking.  The mouthfeel is kind of weird to me. This stout doesn't feel all that... stout. It's pretty viscous, I guess, but the carbonation is oddly spritzy and airy, which kind of contradicts said viscosity.  I love the chocolate in the smell, but the taste just doesn't follow up on it. I think it's a good stout... just not great.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

That being said, this beer is beautiful in the glass. Pours with the nitro-cascade and leaves a half-finger creamy light brown head and excellent lacing.  Smell: Strong notes of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee, with assertive sweetness.  Taste: Oh the difference a nitro-can makes! This beer is fantastic in this format- really great dark, bitter baker's cocoa notes on top of roasted, almost smokey malts. The smokey malts provide some great counterforce to the sweetness of the chocolate, and the beer finishes surprisingly dry as a result. Really digging this brew.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and silky smooth, just like you'd expect from a nitro-can.  Overall: This is a great beer when had in the proper format- I'd highly recommend the nitro-can, as it's an entirely different brew (seemingly) in this format. The beer is drinkable and finishes with a curious bitterness and almost a pinch of red-wine like acidity, which really round out the complexities and make it an intriguing drinking experience with each sip.

Thick, dense head that stays with the beer throughout the entire experience leaving its rings among the glass as the beer disappears  Smell: Bummer here, I got a lot of the metallic smell from the aluminum can. (I also get this from imports like heineken and Newcastle though.. wonder what it is) However, a little smoky/roast smell is present  Taste: Espresso! and smoke! and bittersweet baking chocolate!

It is pitch black with a head smaller than I would hope for, but the lacing and visible carbonation make up for its lacking. The aroma is is of roasted malts, chocolate galore, and underlying coffee.  I may be beaten by saying it had a flavor very similar to a stout that I hold dear to my heart...Founders Breakfast Stout. The way that the flavors merry on the palate, alongside the weight and viscosity make it extremely reminiscent. Flavors of aromas mentioned and an addition of oatmeal and vanilla.  Overall this is extremely well-made and one that is going to be hard to resist when shopping at the store. Give it's availability, I can only think that this is consistent on a regular basis.

664,73,dar482,3.37,"Out of the can, it pours in a wonderful dark brown/black color with a light tan head. It’s a beautiful beer as the nitro trickles down in its wonderful cascade. There’s a solid one finger head that just lays there beautifully. It’s very thick. It’s like Guinness with its appeal and look.  Smelling it, there’s a sweet milky creaminess with a lot of dry malt powder. There’s that very familiar oatmeal stout aroma.  As for taste, the head there is so important. It just sit there like a floating half inch of cappucino head. My can is about a month away from it’s Best By, so maybe that’s the reason I don’t really get too much chocolate. The flavor instead has this burnt maltiness.  On the back end, there’s a bitterness at the end. It’s almost metallic in its astringency, but not very offensive.  The body is actually quite light, which makes it very drinkable.  However, do listen to the can. It says to serve it cool instead of ice cold. They’re right. As I waited, the chocolate flavor slips in a bit. However, you do then start getting that metallic bitterness. It definitely becomes a more well rounded flavor with it being cool. However, I just can’t get past the body and the bitterness at the end. The lack of chocolate is very obvious. I wouldn’t get this beer for the “chocolate.” It’s more of a Irish dry stout with some round oatmeal stout characteristics.  It’s not what I expected, but knowing what you’re getting, it isn’t a terrible beer either.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,zeledonia,3.38,"Tasted 19 March 2013.  Nice-looking beer. Beautiful cascading head, probably thanks to the little widget. About one finger of really really dense head, like the milk foam you'd get in a latte. Great retention, and even after it's faded there's still a fairly thick cap on the beer. Really nice, thick, dense lacing. Beer is basically black with a grayish hue on the side.  Smell is really rich, chocolatey, smooth. Also reminiscent of a latte or mocha, with that strong but gentle chocolate, mellowed out by the other elements. Definitely chocolate, not cocoa, as the sugar combines with it. Sugar cane coming through across the middle. Something about it reminds me of bamboo.  Taste is not bad, just kinda bland. A thin, half-woody half-roasty malt flavor. I only get a bit of chocolate in the taste. Mostly I feel like I'm chewing on sticks that have been sitting in the fire for a while. Turns bitter, a roasty burnt bitter with an herbal hint.  Mouthfeel is straight up flat. Medium-bodied and lighter than I was expecting. Slick and oily without the carbonation, and I don't like it. The nasty sibling of smooth. The lack of carbonation is a terrible combination with the rest of the beer's slipper texture. It's like it's seeking out all the crevices of my mouth, rather than resting on my tongue.  I was excited at first, but the taste brought my hopes down, and the feel dashed them.

In comparison to other Stouts from the UK it gives off similar complexities with that of Samuel Smith Oatmeal and Imperial stout. Note that there is a difference from the cans and bottles. The Nitro-Cans have less bold flavor and more creaminess that works as a session beer. The Bottle has bolder flavor that puts it back in the big leagues.

A - This is the first beer that's made me say ""wow!"" just by looking at it.

O- This beer lives up to its chocolate billing with great taste and appearance while melting into a wonderful finish resembling an Old Gold bar of Cadbury dark chocolate. This beer offers a great introduction to chocolate lovers and a great change of pace to beer drinkers.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Goblinmunkey7,2.94,"Appearance: Dark dark brown, almost black, but not really. Head is a light brown and starts of creamy and large. Drops to a small creamy cap and collar. Spotty notches of lacing. Pours pretty smooth.  Smell: Solid roasted malts. Chocolate malts and some dark chocolate fused with some lighter, sweeter chocolate notes. Almost like a burly Tootsie Roll. Underlying touches of English water. Rocks and chocolate. A touch of leafy hops. Lactose sugar, milky sweet. Pretty mellow overall.  Taste: Lightly roasted malt. Some chocolate malt. A touch of burnt, mild dark cocoa. Almost watery on the finish. Some backing minerality. Grassy. Old, stale coffee. Slightly sweet lactose. Very mild. A nice balance of sweet and roasty. A good amount of chocolate, but that's as far as it goes.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth with a touch of dryness on the finish. Moderate carbonation.  Overall: Using the word chocolate twice does not make it double.  A solid intro stout. Loaded with chocolate, but a little thin overall. Seems to lose more and more as it warms.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,timn,4.66,"This is one of my guilty pleasures (I say guilty because I can feel the calories accumulating when I drink this).  A: Pours dark brown to black, with a nice foamy head. Looks nice and thick.  S: You can immediately smell the chocolate, with some nice coffee / mocha and malt undertones. Really nice smell to start. Some beers don't live up to the name, but you can tell by the smell alone that when it says 'Double Chocolate,' that's what you're getting.  T: Tastes very much like it smells, maybe just a smidgen less: strong chocolate, with a hint of coffee and some malt. Probably the strongest chocolate taste I've had in a chocolate stout -- which again, would be expected by the name.  M: Wonderful mouth feel. Smooth and thick. Low carbonation. This sucker is almost like a beer shake.  O: One of my favorites. A very nice chocolate stout that lives up to its name. Feels like an indulgence when I drink it (truthfully I have no idea if it has any more calories than any other dark beer, but it feels like it... but then if I was watching calories, I wouldn't be drinking a Double Chocolate Stout to begin with).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,angrybabboon,3.44,"Consumed 2/3/13  Appearance: Dark, dark brown, but not black - pours with an average-sized, light tan head - keeps a decent cap, leaves some nice streaks of lacing  Smell: Yup, that's chocolate - cocoa and milk chocolate - some dark chocolate, too, but mostly sweet - some lactose sugar - lightly roasty, with some hints of coffee - not much else in terms of malts, lacking depth, but I suppose this to be expected with the low ABV  Taste: Reminiscent of chocolate milk, just less milky - dry, sweet cocoa and milk chocolate - dry and roasty - some dark coffee - minerals and rocks (probably the water) - lactose sugar, sweet, but not too sweet, decently balanced - lacking depth, as the aroma suggested  Mouthfeel: Light, smooth, nicely carbonated  Overall: If this is double chocolate, I think I'll skip the single chocolate  This does has a good chocolate aroma, and a decent chocolate flavor, but it's not what I expected. It's very light and drinkable. It does get slightly more interesting as it warms, but it's still underwhelming.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Utica_Brew_Review,4.66,"This beer is completely opaque and black. Smells like a nice marriage of dark chocolate and ale. This beer transcends the chocolate stereotype of a sweet chocolate milk ""beer"" and offers something truly unique which is an almost marriage of great chocolate taste with a quality ale. This isn't your kids' chocolate stout. Notes of smoked roasted dark chocolate. The chocolate malt definitely plays a center role. This beer sets the bar for a chocolate beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A: Pours a creamy brown with a nice waterfall effect leaving a 1.5 finger solid off white head. The head does not dissipate until you start drinking. A solid covering of lacing.  S: Rich chocolaty smell balanced with a roasty malt. Has a lactose aroma familiar to milk stouts. Hints of vanilla, can already tell this is going to be creamy.  T: As the names implies this is a chocolate stout. Right off the bat you get notes of dark and milk chocolate. This is complimented by roasted malt and hints of coffee. Slight hop bitterness on the backend and aftertaste.  M: A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, not super thick but by no means thin. Low carbonation. Love the mouthfeel on this.

Tempered and pretty well balanced, medium backbone with dark malts and a bit of caramel. Slight bitterness, milk chocolately finish.

664,73,MaximalC,4.06,"Pours seal brown with a healthy mocha head. A decent amount of patchy lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes. Aroma smells of both dark and milk chocolate. I don't know if my senses were just quick to acclimate, but the aroma doesn't seem nearly as present in the glass as it did right from the bottle. The front end brings a heavy dose of roast with dark chocolate. Milk chocolate steps up in the middle and lingers into the finish. A roasty haze lingers well after. Just enough hops are present to lend some balance. There's also a touch of alcoholic warmth that exceeds what its pedestrian ABV would suggest, giving this brew a bigger character than it would otherwise have. Mouthfeel is just right for the style and complements the flavor profile nicely. Warming certainly does this beer a favor, as the roasted chocolate elements become deeper and more present. Overall, Young's is a very solid chocolate beer that offers some depth and never becomes cloying. Certainly worth having again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Really tastes more like a basic stout with a hint of chocolate and a lot of roastiness.  M- Medium-high carbonation, slight carbonation tingle, medium bodied, does not really coat the mouth.

Smell has a lot of bitter chocolate come through, with roasted malt, something of a beeswax candle note. Straw notes, and some woody barn/field aromas, all pretty nice.  Taste is a full bittersweet chocolate opening, lots of sweet malty notes before some residual hop bitterness to counter. Plenty of smooth mocha, hazelnut, coffee, and earthy flavour. Plenty of lightness, straw and fruity notes, to make for a refreshing taste. Finish is smooth, on the dry side, and toasty. Pretty cool, tasty and balanced though perhaps not my favourite stout style.  Mouthfeel has a lot of malty body but is quite light, plenty of soft carbonation to make a mild refreshing bite. A lot of richness, smooth chocolate to offset the malt works nicely. Drinks really smoothly, coating on finish. Really drinkable.  A really tasty beer. Pretty hard to set down for too long, has a good offsetting bitterness to avoid the sugars taking over. Chocolate is somewhat of a complimenting flavour rather than the whole beer itself. Works pretty well, certainly interesting.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S – Chocolate, lactose, some caramel, and a little bit of coffee-like roasted barley. The lactose is there but it doesn’t smell overly sweet like some milk stouts I’ve had.  T – Sweet nearly all the way through with chocolate, nut, and caramel malt flavors, along with a good bit of lactose. Towards the finish, the taste picks up a mildly bitter hazelnut coffee flavor.  F – Medium-to-full-bodied with great carbonation, a silky and creamy mouthfeel, and a sweet and dry finish. Chocolate milk flavors linger nicely.  O – This is a really tasty beer. I’m not usually a fan of milk stouts as I tend to think that they’re too sweet and one-dimensional, but this one just seems to work very well.

664,73,Beerstorian,4.01,"I had this out of a nitro-can, which gave it the expected ""nitro cascade"" upon pouring.  The aroma was light chocolate at first, with earthy, roasted barley. The chocolate became more pronounced over time, and eventually dominated the aroma completely.  The head was creamy and light, with fantastic retention and lacing, for the entire glassful.  The first sip brought the incredible chocolate flavor I associate with this beer, as well as some light roasted malt. The back end has a pronounced toasted malt flavor--almost burnt.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  This is a great beer, and one of my favorites. I give it a slightly lower grade simply because as a Milk/Sweet Stout it has more chocolate to it than the guidelines specify, and not enough of the dark, roasted malt character that this style should have. Still, this is a fantastic beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Appearance is black with a nice consistent head, which reduces eventually but not all the way. Like Guinness Draught, this is easy drinking all the way. However there's a more complex flavor profile here - chocolate (obviously), roasted malts, and a slight coffee bean finish. Very smooth with little carbonation.  Not wowed by this but it is a solid dessert/nightcap kind of beer that will find its way into my fridge from time to time. For a taste of heaven, try it fused with Wells Banana Bread beer.

And it gets more interesting, luxurious taste of lots of chocolate, toasted malts, oats and hazel nut. Still there is some freshness to it. Medium body, creamy and silky with low carbonation. Aftertaste mildly bitter and toasted. And after all those flavors you still get drinkability, excellent beer. If you pair it with Tiramisu, you are in for a nice treaty. For the record, I still haven’t taste anything bad from Young’s.

664,73,Maxwell,4.01,"The beer pours a murky milk chocolate, with sheets of fine bubbles cascading up the glass and slowly turning the beer from a milk chocolate color to a more proper fine black, almost like the black of a tuxedo. The head appears on the beer at a good finger and a half width, and has no intentions of leaving. It is also the most uniform and beautiful head I have ever seen on a beer, with deep tan coloring, and a creamy, buttery texture, this beer is a looker, and most certainly a beauty in a glass. Lacing is thick, creamy, and sheet-like, covering entire portions of my glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and roasty, almost like a well milked mocha coffee. Roasted nuts play beside (what I assume are) lactic sugars and sweet milk chocolate, and caress the nose beautifully. The sugar does dominate the light roast, but they play together perfectly. The beer tastes surprisingly light, beginning sweet with light cloying lactic sugars before pulling strong milk chocolate as the beer opens and eventually turns to dark chocolate, black coffee bitters, and a wonderful hazelnutty taste that marries the flavors perfectly. The aftertaste is of French roast coffee and light chocolate. My only complaint with the taste is that it tastes almost watery at the beginning before the flavors build, and this does sometimes sit on the tongue beneath the flavors as you sip. On the mouth the beer feels medium to light in body, and creamy, with no carbonation on the tongue. The nitrogen nicely creates a satiny blanket with this beer, but it does suffer from being a little too thin. Overall this is a tremendous English Stout, with superb flavors of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, hazelnut, sugar, and everything else. It is highly worth trying, and though it suffers in score due to its initial weakness in body and flavor, it is a superb beer and a wonderful example of the style. My favorite chocolate beer so far, though Rogue’s Chocolate Stout does give it a run for its money. Try this beer!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Head stays a decent while, and slowly dissipated into a thin coating. Very nice lacing throughout.  Aroma was surprisingly faint, and I struggled to find much depth, but not in an unpleasant way.  The taste is a very smooth stout. Initially very even, with a gentle chocolate finish. Has a lingering aftertaste of burnt coffee which stayed around for a while.  It drinks like fresh oil over the tongue. Very, very, smooth and clean.  Overall, I was very pleased with this stout. It flows smooth as glass, has just the right amount of complexity, and stays on the tongue just long enough to remind you it is a stout, but it never seems to overpower itself.

T- The booze from the nose is not nearly as noticeable with the deep complex flavors of luscious chocolate cake coating the tongue then fading to lingering sweet brownie and chocolate chips.  M- Medium bodied but low in carbonation (or nitrogen as is the case). Not bad but a little higher in both respects would allow it to be more mouth filling and let the chocolate play some.

S - 3.5 - Smells of general stouty black malt smell plus a bit of chocolate plus a bit of sweeter malt.  T - 3.75 - That chalky black malt char taste really comes to the front, and the chocolate is barely sweet, almost of the baking chocolate variety. There's a hint of coffee. Not what I was expecting. Of course I forgot to let it sit out, so I imagine I'd get more chocolate when warmer. I actually like it the way it is though. I didn't really want something really sweet. Definitely better than average, but not quite as complex as some of the things I'd give a 4.  M - 3.5 - Thinner than expected. Even crisp. Has a slight chalkiness.  O - 4.0 - Between the char-forwardness, the not-very-sweet chocolate note, and the thin chalky crispness, this is a totally different beer than the thicker, round, mild, sweet chocolate confection I was expecting from and English beer called a double chocolate stout.

664,73,ThisWangsChung,3.7,"I said in my review of the nitro-can version ""There's a really nice stout underneath all of this nitro-can hobnobbery."" Let's see how true that rings, shall we? 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown color. I'd say it's about 98% opaque. The head is a two finger khaki color that fades somewhat quickly. As it recedes, though, it leaves decent rings of lacing down the side of the glass. Not nitro-can gorgeous, but I don't care.  S: Well, it's chocolaty. This is really evocative of brownies the way the chocolate mingles with the subtly roasted and sweet malts. Aromatically, it's simple, but the small handful of notes here are executed superbly.  T: It's what you'd expect here...a strong chocolate flavor to lead the charge. Some roasted malts and some earthy hops then balance the sweetness somewhat. Compared to Choklat, it's not that sweet; but compared to just about anything else, this is quite sugary. The finish has a touch of bitterness to it, perhaps suggesting a minor hop profile. No real complaints here aside from the low depth and faintly artificial tone of the chocolate.  M: The carbonation is perhaps a bit more than I wanted here. On the plus side, it isn't watery like the nitro-can version! The body is light and semi-smooth, and finishes slightly astringent (not dry...nononono, this beer is pretty much the exact opposite of dry).  O: This is a rock solid dessert beer with enough balance to make it a bit more versatile than one would expect. I expected more honestly, but that's because I wanted Choklat Jr. instead of something with more nuance and subtlety.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,GarthDanielson,4.03,"Poured from a bottle into a mug, the beer is a dark, opaque, near-black coloring with a thin, dense, creamy, off-white head that coats the top of the beer and clings to the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, with a deep roasting in the background and a touch of bitter dark chocolate highlighting. Flavors are rich and deeply roasted, with a light, dry body typical of a Milk stout. Smooth, rich, creamy milk chocolate flavors on the forward tongue are followed rapidly by a touch of bitter, dark cocoa nibs underlying flavor profile. Very dynamic whilst remaining in the realm of chocolate throughout. A hint of coffee/mocha comes in as the transition is being made to the aftertaste on the palate, which is mostly the dark roast and slight bitterness. Smooth, dry finish, with a touch of roast linger. Very tasty and very easy to drink, I have found that this beer does well transitioning newbies into the world of the Stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Some underwhelming cling, just a few splashes here and there.  S: Smells of dark roasted malts and raw cacao beans. Nice dark chocolate aromas with some supporting coffee notes and a bit of tart dark berry mixed in. Pleasing to say the least.  M: Tastes of deep roast grains with some nice caramelized sugars on it. I get oats, dark chocolate, and a bit of spent coffee. There is a nice moderate bitterness and a little bit of mixed dark berry. Alcohol barely even noticeable. A little bit of a step down from the nose. Not overly chocolate but nice.  T: Very smooth and creamy texture with moderate physique. Carbonation is lush. Rather wet on the finish and a bit thin/watery overall.  D: A long-established example of the style. Very approachable with some good roast and chocolate flavors.

664,73,knoxtennessee,4.11,"Had this on beer gas at the casual pint in downtown Knoxville.  A- Like all beers on the nitro it has a perfectly formed and everlasting head. Pitch black in color and very inviting.  S- Soft dark chocolate and roasted barley. A moderate sweetness and mild coffee undertones. That vague softness from the nitrogen really complements the sweetened mocha impression.  T- A moderately sweet rich dark chocolate flavor is followed closely by coffee and roasted barley. A small amount of estery English yeast character is detectable just before the dry finish.  M- Like most nitro beers this one feels a bit watery. It does however have a little more velvety malt body than most. Nicely balanced in the finish.  O- My absolute favorite nitro beer to date. Lots more character than other nitro stouts. Great chocolate flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.

Very aromatic but nothing strong.  taste: really creamy taste, you can definitely taste the chocolate in this one. No overbearing but just good, very good. I guess it has a very malty flavor to it. Has a really roasted creamy aftertaste.  mouthfeel: it's definitely smooth and very rich in texture. Has a very creamy luscious body to it. It's hard to explain it feels good.  overall: I always pick this one up at the local liquor store it's very good and I recommend this. Good dessert beer for sure.

664,73,uld2541,4.67,"The only reason I'm reluctant to give it 5's across the board is one that echo's another review from a fellow advocate; It's not that chocolaty....Appearance wise, it's a stout, so it's dark...really dark...but the thin, brown head gives it a pleasant appearance. The smell plays a huge role in the taste of the beer, if that doesn't sound strange, and the taste is very roasted and chicory with a hint of chocolate. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best stouts I've ever drank, but it's not a double chocolate kind of stout.

M: Thick, good level of carbonation, very drinkable.

You can't see through it, and there was really minimal foam on the pour. That died down to just a tiny bit of scum on top.  I really love the way this beer smells. You get a lot of chocolate (from nibs?). You also pick up quite a bit of malt and a decent amount roastiness. Of course there is some rich coffee presence.  The flavor is a little more understated. You get more of the coffee roastiness. I like the way the chocolate is there, but it is not overwhelming. There is very good balance.

A: Typical dark hue for any stout, but a particularly thick, creamy tan head that fizzles about halfway into the glass.  S: Dark chocolate, cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of the sweetness from chocolate milk.  T: Same flavors as above. Medium hops. Complex chocolate notes as it goes down (think chocolate coffee cake). Cocoa powder and coffee hits you immediately, as you swallow a sweet milk chocolate flavor fills your mouth, which finishes with dry hops as all the others fade in your mouth.  M: This is where this brew shines. One of the most velvety beers I've ever had. Literally feels like drinking rich, homemade chocolate milk.  Overall: Exceptional beer.

664,73,doktorhops,3.73,"Wells & Young's, so far has done London proud with their special ale, but quite average with its banana beer, hopefully their double chocolate stout will pick up the baton and run hard (into a wall of Olympic metaphors).  Poured from a 500ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Presents with a chocolate body (that's shut up irony right there), and a tan 0.5cm creamy head. Looks appealing... and chocolaty.  S: Rich smoke and chicory assails the nostrils. Soon followed by dark chocolate (let's count how many times I use the word ""chocolate"" in this review), hint of dark fruits and water... yes, water.  T: Has the element of chocolate straight away. That being said the chocolate taste could be richer... a lot richer. Other than that we have the usual stout/porter suspects; chicory, smoke, coffee grinds and a hint of vanilla. Not bad, not stand out either.  M: Slightly more watery than expected, reminiscent of Guinness in this respect - mid to light body and carbonation.  D: As a stout it meets expectations well enough. As a double chocolate stout? Needs more chocolate. Apart from that we have a half decent stout that is unfortunately not as good as Coopers or Old Engine Oil, and doesn't live up to the double chocolate flavour it implies. Chocolate.  Food match: Will it match chocolate? Of course it will! Silly question actually... aside from chocolate it would pair equally with venison or game meats, rare steaks and trousers.  Note: 13 times if you count ""chocolaty"".",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Hoppsbabo,3.88,"A: Black with an attractive light beige head.  S: Smokey like a porter. A bit metallic.  T: The chocolate is not obvious but it surely adds to the silky rich and creamy smoothness (as described on the bottle). Tart but not overwhelmingly so. Not metallic, smokey or particularly coffee like, just smooth chocolatey maltiness. Nice floral aftertaste.  O: It's alright.

664,73,matttttYCE,3.71,"Poured slowly into a pint, the head on this comes to about two fingers of light tan creaminess. The beer is a deep dark-brown, near black. Lots of lace and head retention is very nice.  The aroma leaves a bit to be desired, with light watery roasted malts, bitterness, cocoa powder, light coffee and dark chocolate, along with some sweetness, almost light lactose sugar.  Much the same as the aroma, with lighter roasted malts, sweetness, and bitterness that compliment nice cocoa powder and slightly bitter chocolate notes with hints of coffee, caramel, dark fruits, sugar, and a subtle hopping.  Mouthfeel is the definition of smooth. The carbonation is low and smooth, consistency is just stupid creamy, while the body is light but coating the mouth, like a nitro or nitro can should be. The finish is smooth, subtle, and a tad bitter, but nice.  Overall a very nice offering in the milk/sweet stout category, especially if you're looking for a good nitro, not from the tap. Actually this is probably my second favorite nitro can or bottle behind Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout, which is now my all time favorite and go to for smoothness, easy drinking, or nitro.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It tastes great, not too chocolatey. Overall, I'd give this a 4.5 because I think it'd be better with a stronger smell and taste.

This beer doesn't really give off much when it comes to aroma. Cocoa bean, watery roasted malt. Maybe some lactose sugar. Maybe the canned version does something to tighten the nose? It's fine, but not expressive.  The taste is better. Lots of milk chocolate, a small bit of watered-down Maxwell House, a sort of dairy note, and sugar sweetness. Again, not complex. But this beer isn't going for complexity.  The mouthfeel, given what this beer wants to do, is also perfect. It's smooth as...nah, it's not smooth. It's smoove. Smoove.

Overall good example of light ABV stout",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,VelvetExtract,3.48,A-The body of this beer is clearly light judging by the lack of viscosity. It should be lighter due to the lower ABV. Dark brown but light does penetrate to a swallow margin. Head is tannish and of respectable stature. Leaves clumped lacing rings.  S-Lighter nose is heavily concentrated with chocolate and lactose. Not overly roasty. The nose stresses milk chocolate (specifically chocolate milk) and powdered cocoa. Not rich but the aroma is decent.  T-No surprises here. Milk chocolate. Lightly chalky. Shallow notes of dark chocolate. Roast is also skinny. Sweetened cream and even some vanilla milkshake.  M-Light bodied. Plenty of carbonation for the style. Easily imbibable. Not creamy and lacks muscularity. High drinkability leads to a lack of fulfilling feel on the palate.  O/D-To stress simplicity: this beer is akin to a chocolate infused Guinness Draught. Light bodied stout that can fill a role in certain situations. Took me too long to try this.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

I would have expected a dark chocolate and coffe bean bitter finish, but this was a nice suprise.  Probably too much carbonation. All fairly thin given the style as well.

Smell – Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, toffee, cocoa, everything I would expect out of the style. Smells delicious!  Taste – Follows the nose to the letter. A creamy mixture of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, a hint of coffee, some cocoa, and a hint of roastiness. I really enjoyed it, though it tasted excellent~!  Mouthfeel – Rich, creamy, well balanced carbonation. You taste the chocolate all the way through the finish of the drink. Love it.  Overall – Excellent beer, good representation of the style, everything I wanted it to be plus a little more. Highly recommended, would absolutely drink and buy this again.

The head settles to a creamy film, but leaves next to nothing for lacing.  S - Mild chocolaty character. Semi-sweet dark chocolate and light milk chocolate, but mainly just subtle cocoa. Mild hops? This just doesn't smell all that fantastic to me.  T - The taste does little more to build on the aroma. Mild unsweetened dark chocolate, subtle cocoa, and that's about it for chocolaty flavors. It's not rich or creamy or sweet or anything like I expected. I don't mind that the roasty more abrasive flavors have been turned down to the bare minimum, but without any chocolaty or sweet flavors coming to fruition, this stout feels boring.  M - Decent creaminess from the body, but nothing special. Carbonation is a bit high for the style. Medium bodied.  D - Like an average stout, but neutered.

Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with low carbonation.  It's definitely a classic example of a milk stout that brings the chocolate.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Darkmagus82,4.33,"Poured from nitro can into pint glass  Appearance – Pours a light brown color at first with the nitrogen/carbonation bubbles well mixed with the brew. Quickly however there is a cascade of the carbonation upward through the brew, leaving a deep brown nearly black body color with a nice tan head. The head never fades and is persistent throughout the drinking experience.  Smell –The smell is of a bitter-sweet chocolate aroma with bits of a milky aroma. Very nice.  Taste – Smooth lightly sweetened chocolate meet the tongue. There are light roasty malt flavors and a slight breadiness, but these are very light in comparison to the semi-sweet chocolate. A milky sweetness then comes into play at the middle. These however are lost again to a more dark chocolate flavor which lingers on the tongue at the end and leave a very satisfying cocoa flavor on the tongue  Mouthfeel – Creamy and smooth, soothing the mouth with a wonderful silky feel throughout the taste experience. Great for the nice chocolaty flavors.  Overall – The nitrogen pour fits this beer perfectly and I would always recommend it over the non-nitro version. Great flavors and smooth body make it a great drinking experience. Delicious and smooth. Wonderful!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MadCat,4,"CANquest 2012, part two! Figured I would get a nitro-can review in here, and try something new.  Appearance: Once the nitro settles down a bit, the beer is very black, and has a continuous one finger tan head that leaves good lacing  Smell: Sweet roasted malts, with come notes of chocolate and a hint of coffee  Taste: Starts off chocolatey, then moves to some roasted malts, coffee, and a little milk  Mouthfeel: As with any nitro brew, it is thick, but super smooth  Overall: Pretty good, but not my favorite. A good way to get a sweet stout fix though, as it is easier to find than most milk/sweet stouts. I feel like nitro is a good application here, even though I can't tell you for sure what it is like without it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Porterfanatic,4.43,"Served from a nitro-can into a pilsner glass.  Nice thick head with great lacing that clings to the glass well after the beer is gone.  Smells of an unsweetened chocolate, roasted coffee, and a very nice malt package that backs it up.  Tastes just like the smell, with much more roasted coffee and chocolate coming out as it warms up.  Mouthfeel is great, thick enough to fill you up, creamy almost, but not overly so.  overall a great stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Cozzatoad,3.86,"A- Very dark brown, almost black colour. A nice couple fingers of light brown (actually reminds of chocolate), soft looking head. Decent retention and lots of quite thick lacing on the sides of the glass  S- Sweet buttery malts with maybe some notes of caramel and a quite distinct roasted/smoked feel to them. A note of chocolate on the back of things  T- Much more on the chocolate side than the smell suggested. Sweet chocolate malts upfront, reminding of milk chocolate, again with a nice roasted touch to them. More chocolate notes on the palate, this time a bit more on the bitter side (dark chocolate), along with maybe some liquorice and coffee notes as well. Finishes on the earthy side, with a touch of clean, refreshing bitterness and a light leafy hops note. Nice bittersweet combination  M- Super soft, creamy mouthfeel on both tongue and palate, where flavours fully spread and may still be clearly felt after some seconds. Just a gentle touch of soft carbonation texture on the tongue, to bring a bit of life. Great mouthfeel  O- Definitely enjoyed this. Maybe not the most complex beer out there, but full of real chocolate flavour and actually quite refreshing, wich is nice to be found in a stout. Felt a bit heavy on my stomach",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,dbrauneis,4.06,"A: Pours an opaque jet black in color with the normal nitro-can cascading head. The beer has a finger tall creamy light tan head that has great retention properties (barely any reduction over the drinking of the beer). Significant lacing is observed. Nitro-can beer shave such a cool effect when poured.  S: This beer has a mild aroma overall but there is a nice amount of complexity to the smell. I can detect some dark roasted malts, light elements of coffee, lots of milk chocolate, and just a hint of char.  T: The flavor really follows the smell with a really wonderful milk chocolate sweetness upfront There is a nice amount of complexity and the flavor is well balanced. There is a really nice balance between the milk chocolate sweetness and the dark roasted malts. There is a very light bitterness in the finish.  M: Medium bodied with light amounts of carbonation. Extremely creamy.  O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and very enjoyable. The beer has a pleasant smell and a great flavor with such a smooth mouthfeel. I could easily session this beer and I really enjoy it.

664,73,Glibber,3.91,"Had this one on tap at the Brickyard in Boise after a night of beer tasting. Ducked in to have some desert and tried the double chocolate stout. Normally not a big stout fan, but this one was impressive. Not black, but milk chocolate colored with a very thick and creamy head- poured on a large stemmed glass. The chocolate taste was unmistakeable, and along with some roasted hints and very mild bitterness there was not too much of a coffee flavor found in so many Stouts. I do not drink this style much, but was a pleasant beer that I would try again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,musicforairports,3.53,"All black in color. Nice head and some lacing.  Smells of burnt caramel and bitter chocolate and coffee.  Coffee and chocolate flavors, light caramel. Other roasted notes. Quite decent, but not exactly robust. Rather light on the chocolate for the name, in my opinion, and I have no idea what the ""double"" refers to.  Medium mouthfeel--on the lighter end for the style, but adequate. Decently carbonated.  This is a fine stout. I'd take it over Guinness any day, but it's nothing too much to write home about.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MammothTarantula,2.66,"Poured from the bottle into a Samuel Smith pint glass.  A: Poured a rich, dark, chocolatey brown. Billowing tan two finger head that quickly dissipated. Looked absolutely gorgeous for the first 15 or so seconds after pouring. Light lacing left on the inside of the glass, but what was left stayed tight.  S: Sweet malts with light cocoa undertones. Reminded me of a softer version of the scent left in the glass after drinking chocolate milk as a child.  T: Here's where things started to disappoint. The taste is just like the smell, but very, very watered down. It feels like half the beer got flavored, and the rest didn't.  M: One of the lightest stouts I've ever had. Very thin and watery. Light carbonation fades very fast, even before swallowing. Leaves a lot to be desired.  O: Not awful, but by no means good. If offered one, I would drink it, but I wouldn't buy this again.

664,73,daBoLTman,4.27,"500ml bottle poured into my bro-in-law's Duvel tulip glass.  This is my first review of any beer on this site, so please take it easy...  Appearance: Poured a deep silky smooth blackness, almost abyss like, with a 1-2"" white creamy foam head. The head died down to less than half-an-inch while I let it sit for a moment, and stayed with a nice little tiny white head while I drank it down.  Smell: Immediately to the nose I got the chocolatty (s?), almost like smelling a Hershey bar whiff right when you open the package to your nose, and then followed by the sweet malty/vanilla type second hand.  Taste: This is the highest I rated it among it's ratings at 4.5...if you are a good stout lover like me, this will fill up your mouth with your tongue tasting what your nose got, just with a little less punch: light milk chocolate flavor & more toasty and roasty malts than what's in the nose in the beginning, and surprisingly a dark bittery chocolate in the middle, finishing with a nice smooth vanilla at the end.  Mouthfeel: Mmmm, buttery smooth. No real strong hint of carbonation, just silk and creamy texture down your tongue, and throat.  Overall: I would recommend this beer to anyone wanting to try a good ""stout"" beer for a first one. It was enjoyable by all in the room as everyone I was with (5 of them) said it was the best dark beer they ever tried. It was sweet, not overpowering on the ABV %, and could be enjoyed by sipping, or gulping it down.

664,73,StoutHunter,4.2,"I picked up a can of Young's Double Chocolate Stout last week for $2.59 at The Lager Mill. I have been meaning to try this one for a while, but I usually choose a local Chocolate Stout instead, so I decided it was time to stop messing around and try this beer, lets see how it goes. No visible freshness date. Poured from a 440ml nitro can into a imperial pint glass.  A- The can looks good, the colors work nicely together, it's got a classic look to it. It poured a nice dark black color that didn't let hardly any light through and it had two fingers worth of creamy tan head that died down to a thick layer that stayed till the end and left some nice sheets of lacing. This is a good looking beer and the Nitro made it look even better, this beer is easy on the eyes.  S- Wow, the first thing I notice is the chocolate, it's really in your face and bold, just the way I like it and it has an aroma similar to good chocolate syrup. The only other aromas that I pick up are a little bit of sweet malts and a very slight amount of alcohol. There is no skimping with the chocolate when it comes to the aroma, this smells just how a good Chocolate Stout should, I really like it.  T- The taste seems to follow the nose but it isn't nearly as bold and robust as the aroma. It starts out with a good amount of chocolate that tastes like a mixture of milk chocolate and cocoa powder. After that comes some sweet malt flavors that gives this beer an English Stout finish, with hardly any bitterness and a sweet malt, and chocolate aftertaste. This is a nice tasting beer, with just enough chocolate flavor to live up it's name, I like it.  M- Very Smooth, Very creamy, slightly dry, on the thick side of being medium bodied, and it had a nice amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was pretty close to prefect and the nitro worked really well with this beer and it really brought out the creamyness of this beer.  Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a very good Milk Stout, it had just enough chocolate flavors to stay true to it's name and the aroma and mouthfeel really put this beer over the top. This beer had really good drinkability, it went down really, smooth, wasn't too filling, and the taste really held my attention, I could drink a few of these in a session without getting bored. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel, they were about as good as gets for this style of beer. What I liked least about this beer was that the flavor wasn't as chocolaty as the aroma was, it wasn't a big deal but if the flavor matched the aroma it would be perfect. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's not too expensive and is a real nice representation of a proper Chocolate Stout. Even if you remotely like Chocolate Stouts this is worth a try and is a true representation of the style. I was really impressed with this beer, I have passed this beer up many times, mainly because it's so available, but after trying it I for sure won't be passing it up again. I think some brewers need to drink this beer to know what a true Chocolate Stout should taste like, lately I have had a few that have not been that chocolaty, when you claim your beer is a Chocolate Stout, the chocolate should be the main focus, and that's exactly what is was with this beer and that's what makes this beer so special. Lately I haven't had great luck with English beers, but this beer broke the trend and reaffirmed to me that there are some great beers coming out of that country. This has to be the best Chocolate Stout I have ever had, a new favorite and it made for a good first impression of this brewery, this may finally inspire me to bite the bullet and try that banana bread beer. Good job guys, this is one great beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Enjoyed at The Yard House (downtown Denver)  Side note: I have amazingly fond memories of this beer as it is one of a few that turned my palate to dark, robust beers. Every time I have it, it reminds me of my first pint of it at The Flying Saucer in Nashville way back when. Delightful!  From notes.  A: Dark chocolate brownie. 1.5 (creamy off-white head) fingernail head.  S: Chocolate, hint of roasted dark malt, more chocolate, vanilla, and (again) more chocolate.  T: Bold, sweet chocolate and cream up-front with a touch of roasted dark malt and vanilla. Darn good!  M: Full bodied with smooth, creamy, just-right carbonation.  O: As mentioned, I have wonderful memories of this beer and must thank it for assisting in my palate development (thus the perfect score for the overall rating). I even bought a couple of cases of this and had it as a side beer at my wedding back in 2009!

The head is thinner than I expected though retention is very good and it leaves nice lacing as it recedes.  S - Semi-sweet chocolate, milk and heavy cream, and light roasted barley. Inviting, but too mild.  T - Bold roasted barley body plays nicely against fruity but nicely bitter chocolate. It's got a raw cacao note working for it. It's adequately sweet and creamy. I love the build, but wish the flavors were still more bold.  M - Full bodied, creamy, and an awesome dry finish.  D - Its a really good stout, but I find it to be just too mild to be great.

Lacing left on the glass is clumpy, splotchy, and streaky.  A lightly roasted single stout aroma blends with a not-overpowering dark chocolate/cocoa aroma. To me, it smells a lot like cocoa powder. A little bit of toffee and a chocolate-banana bread that I once enjoyed jump out of the glass, too.  A slightly twangy, roasty malt flavor lands on my palate at first, followed by a cocoa and toffee, and finished off with a good balance between decadent dark chocolate and a slightly acidic roasted malt flavor. Solid.  The mouthfeel is mostly roasty and acidic- just slightly biting, but with a nice medium-bodied creaminess to counteract. It's a pleasant, soft feel with just enough of a bite.  Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable, sessionable stout.

Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied, just as one should expect from a nitro can. Overall, the strong alcohol presence in this one severely limits its potential for me.

Soft, supple roastiness with chocolate dominating the rest of the nose.  3.5 T: Again, soft roastiness and chocolate. There isn't a whole lot of flavor and I think it's more from the nitro rather than it being only 5.2%. Still, it's not bad.  3.5 M: Light body with a ton of creaminess and super smooth.

If you like cola like I do, then it looks very inviting with it's carbonation, gleaming dark brown body, and darkwood colored head.  S: Now this is where it's not at all like Coke. As the name inplies, Initially you get an amazing semi sweet cocoa smell. Then you begin to notice the roasted grains smell, almost like a slightly burned toast, but in a good way. That's followed up by a very slight hop, well I suppose spiciness is the word? Either way, it's wonderful.  T: This beer tastes great. Let me start of by saying that. The only reason that I didn't give it a 4 or better is because I've tried some incredible stouts before, and I'm pretty conservative with ratings. This beer has all he right things for this style, they're just done better by other beers. Still very good though.  M: Nothing super special. refreshing enough though. It's not dry like a lot of stouts tend to be, which is a good thing.  O: A really good beer that isn't super expensive like a lot of premium stouts tend to be.

Great lacing all the way down.  S- Very faint. Only thing I got was a slight burnt malt scent and a hint of chocolatey sweetness.  T- Was somewhat disappointed here. Lighter burnt malts flavors throughout were the dominant flavors. A hint of sweetness at the end was there, with a hint of dark chocolate. Finished very clean with the slight sweetness and burnt malt flavors.  M- Very, very smooth and silky. Creamy on the palate with a fair amount of weight, but still very sessionable.  Overall, I was a little disappointed that this one didn't have more dominant chocolate flavors.

After it all settles, it is a black body with a thick, creamy, light tan.  The aroma is predominately of chocolate and cocoa, with some coffee notes as well.  The taste follows the nose, with it fading from sweet chocolate upfront to lightly bitter cocoa and then to a bitter, coffee, slightly chalky like finish.  Creamy from the nitro-can, but fairly devoid of carbonation. It then finishes quite thin and watery feeling.

664,73,magictacosinus,3.95,"Poured into a pint glass from a 500ml bottle.  Very thick, creamy appearance with a generously sized head. Dark and murky, with barely any light passing through. Carbonation seems plentiful. Definitely gives the appearance of scrumptious, inviting ale as described on the glass.  There are definitely notes of chocolate in the aroma, but for me, I picked up a lot more on the roasted malts and coffee-smelling notes than anything else. Indeed, the chocolate seems to provide sweetness, but it seems that malts overpower it completely here. Others I tried this with disagreed about the coffee, but no matter what, it's definitely a complex and lovely-smelling stout.  Despite all the varied flavors in the aroma, this stands to indeed be a balanced, well-tasting stout. The roasted notes are huge, but the combination of dark chocolate, coffee, and even vanilla flavors produce a fairly unique and tasty beer that must be tried for fans of this style. There's some light bitterness here, but this beer is all about the malts and roasted flavors, with a hint of caramel/chocolate sweetness. A little too thin for my liking, though, as I usually prefer my stouts to be creamier and fuller-bodied than this.  A surprisingly well balanced stout of high quality and fun experimentation. Not as ""chocolaty"" as I expected it to be, but definitely a good brew recipe. Any fans of stouts should try this one. Especially since it's nearly seassionable!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Chaz,3.15,"Pours a dark brown in color (black to the naked eye) with a rocky head that's just on the brown side of tan ; ) Head drops very gradually and leaves a decent amount of lacing behind. Judging by this first appearance in my globe, this ought to be a very good drink indeed!  Nose offers a blend of distinct impressions, with notes of light vanilla and lighter confectioner's (candi?) sugar, burnt toast, toffee, and espresso. What surprises me a little is that for a beer with ""Chocolate"" in its name there's precious little in the nose, only the lightest dusting of cocoa. Also worth noting is that I think of chocolate as being sweet (or at least bitter-sweet), and despite the lighter notes of sweet things I've already mentioned, this one doesn't ""smell sweet"". Hmmm.  Definitely bittersweet on the first sip, and with a light mineral aspect kicking in the background -- strange. Notes of chocolate become gradually more pronounced as this warms, but the vanilla and other notes (as were evident in the nose) are also more prominent.  Bitterness is more pronounced that I recall from past go-rounds with this beer; perhaps the change is due to the new brewery and owners of the Young's brands? I haven't had this one in years. At any rate, it's not a sweet beer as such now, and the bitterness stands out. There's a lighter 'sour' note that I get from this (although it's a reasonably fresh bottle) that I never noted in the past.  Lighter-bodied for the style, but the flavors really do fill the palate. Seeing as this is listed as a Milk/Sweet Stout, Double Chocolate seems like a rather tepid example of the style...  Altogether -and while it's not a bad beer at all- there are more interesting (if not 'better') examples of Milk/Sweet Stout out there. It's definitely worth a try if you're just getting your feet wet in the style (especially as there are a lot of distinct style variations on stout nowadays -- especially stronger ones).  Likewise, despite the slight changes I note from my impressions of past samplings (and I now see that I've reviewed this on Nitro as well!) it basically hasn't changed: I recall selling several case-loads of this per week at retail, and just because I'm not so impressed with it doesn't mean that others are not!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Slightly sweet considering your eyes play tricks on you but extremely tasty beer.  Mouth: Med-heavy carbonation, one of the crispiest beers I have had in my life.

Overall, this is the first time I've had the bottled version of this beer, and the truth is I like it more than the can, which is perfect.

The flavors are very milky and creamy and the sweet lactose is very evident. The MF is smooth and rich, very creamy on the palate and satisfying.

Slow reverse cascade effect as the head settles, creation a high contrast line against the black stout, as a result of the finely textured nitrogen bubbles. Long lasting foam, solid head retention on display here.  Who put hershey kisses in my Guinness... hollow milk chocolate sweetness, husky roast barley aroma.  Watery thinnish body, some creaminess from the nitro, still fairly flavorful though. Hershey kiss milk chocolate, mild coffee with cream and sugar, somewhat sweet though not overly so.

664,73,cmq103,4.08,"Poured from a nitro can into an Philadelphia Eagles pint glass. You gotta live the nitro!! What an awesome presentation as the cascading action does its thing. I love just watching this beer prepare itself for consumption.  Appearance: As noted above, this beer has one beauty of a pour. Jet black with a 1/4"" creamy beige head. This one looks outstanding. Lacing is ""spot on"", clinging like there is no tomorrow as my glass is emptied.  Taste: Roasted malt, mildly bitter semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, some vanilla tones with a hint of molasses in the finish. There is really no hop presence at all in my opinion, though it has a slight bitterness on the tongue after the swallow. Outstanding  Smell: Light roasted malts and milk chocolate dominate. Not overwhelming by no means, rather just enough to mentally prepare yourself for the first sip of a double chocolate stout.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, as expected for the nitro style. Super smooth and creamy texture, exactly how a sweet milk stout should be. Even though it's a little thin on the tongue, the mouthfeel gets my highest rating.  Overall: Wells & Young Ltd really nailed this style. What a great sessionable stout. I could easily see having a few of these in one sitting. Much better than Guinness in every way. I've had it on nitro-tap, nitro-can and in the bottle. On tap and from the nitro-can is the way to go. Much better than the bottle version.

664,73,beerdrifter,4.2,"Been drinking this beer forever, and finally decided to sit down and review it. Dark black-brown pour with two finger tan head with decent retention and good lacing. As you would expect, lots of roasty dark chocolate and cocoa in the nose, along with hints of espresso, vanilla and caramel. The taste is much the same with the chocolate definitely the star, but not to the point to where it's too much. The roasted malt becomes even more prominent as it warms, with an almost smokey hint to it. Reminds me when I toured the old Ram Brewery outside of London and they had us taste the roasted barley. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick and oh so smooth. That, coupled with the low ABV, makes this incredibly drinkable.

Mouthfeel - This beer is creamy silky smooth, a really nice mouthfeel, carb is medium but not sharp at all, foamy smooth.  Overall - This is a delicious beer, not thick and mouthcoating which makes this highly drinkable and enough roastiness to be refreshing and nearly palate cleansing.

A: Pours a 1.5 finger head of lovely cream, good thickness, and pretty good retention. Colour is a solid black.  Sm: Chocolate, nuts, and heavy cream. Moderately strong.  T: Very creamy but the chocolate is unfortunately restrained. Slight nuts. It's a bit bland and simple for a chocolate beer, but it's still pretty good. I preferred it on nitro-draught. Balanced but badly built.  Mf: Creamy, smooth, and wet. Sort of suits the flavour, but not really.  Dr: They should just brew a cream ale and be done with it.

The flavor of the nitro can leaves something to be desired; things are smoothed out to the point of blandness; very light taste with a pleasant milk chocolate note and mild sweetness. Not much else; definitely not as tasty as the bottle, which I feel to be a little overrated to begin with. Would love to try this beer on tap sometime.

As I understand this is the macro brew of the bunch, sometimes, things are more popular for a reason. This is the case here. This beer is smooth, easy to drink, sweet without being overbearing. The Double Chocolate is certainly not just a market tool. I prefer beers of this style to have low carbonation. I'm not sure if its the nitro can or not, but this is very low carbonation. Has a very cool Guinness cascading effect when poured. Allowing the beer to warm a little does great things for both the taste and smell. Exactly the beer I hoped to find for the style.

Retention is fantastic, lasting the entire period over which I drank this, and the lacing is generous and thick as well.  S - Right at the front of the aroma is the rich, sweet chocolate that this stout is known for. It's not a bitter chocolate, but rather like flaked, milk chocolate. There is a touch of hops as well, but for the most part the malts are the show for this beer.  T - Unfortunately, while nitro does wonders for the appearance and smoothness of a beer, it does tend to mute some of the flavors of a beer, and it's noticeable here. The first few seconds of the taste are mysteriously bland and watery, and only until the mid-palate comes around does most of the flavor come in. Again, it is full of chocolate, but there's little else until the finish, when some floral hops come through. A little disappointing to be honest.  M - The mouthfeel is moderately light-bodied with decent carbonation. Amazing, frothy head and the nitro lead to a velvety soft feel on the palate. However, it is exceptionally light for a stout and even thin and watery at times. This has a direct effect on the taste, so I have to dock it points for that.  D/O - Drinkability is moderate. While the look and smell are nice on this, the taste and body are lacking. I have had this beer a good amount of times in bottles and this is my first nitro-can, so I am not sure if my memory of this beer is skewed or the different vessel, but I will have to try this again out of a bottle to refresh myself.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The creamy head just sits there forever.  Aroma is rich chocolate/bitter cocoa. If I didn't know this was a beer I'd think I was smelling a box of chocolates.  Taste is a little muted. Not really thin, or watery - the rich chocolate is there, as is the bitter roasted malt. It's just kind of faint. Gets a little better as it warms, but the taste on this one is never as good as the aroma.  Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy thanks to the widget.  Overall this is a good chocolate stout but not the best I've had. It lacks complexity, just a little boring.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,rangerred,4.11,Served in a pint glass from a nitro tap.  Appearance is jet black with a creamy tan head. Typical of a nitro pour.  Smell is very much like chocolate milk. Not a whole lot of malt detected in the smell.  The taste is very similar to the smell. Sweel chocolate with a small amount of roasted malt. There is a very slight bitterness but I believe this is more from the malt rather than hops. Not much hop character present at all.  Overall I really like this beer.

Some lacing remains. Smell is rather mild. Some coffee notes mixed with light chocolate, underwhelming however. Taste is not as strong as I hoped. A bit of watered down chocolate, but smooth. A bit one dimentional. Didn't pick up any malts and just mild milky quality. Feels a bit watery on the tongue as well, wanted more of a creamy/silk feel. Overall- A decent stout that was good, but not great. Needs to be more complex with fuller body and taste.

Nice looking pour: dark, opaque, and a consistent frothy tan cover at least a half inch thick. Good retention and some stickage, too. Actually, this a very nice looking beer.  Smell is of lightly creamed coffee and a dark chocolate cordial. Not overly aggressive or lively, but also rather pleasant in a tame sort of way.  Tastes like Lindt dark chocolate with the liquid filling. There enough of the cocoa and light dark chocolate notes here to distract my brain from the milk/sweet stout designation, which is not a personal favorite. Hint of roasty sweetness comes through at the end.  Mouthfeel if light and creamy due to the nitro. The body is slightly too watery to be ideal, but the creaminess certainly helps.

The head that is there is a nice tan head. The body is nice and pitch black. Carbonation is lightly present on the head. The head even decently last and it also laces quite nicely.  S: Dark chocolate is amazingly present with toasted malts also present. A light alcohol smell is present, but nothing strong.  T: The roasted malts I feel as if are the main kicker to this Stout. The dark chocolate, bittersweet, comes off at the tail end of this Stout and it stays around for quite a nice pleasant time. When at room temperature the roasted malts are still strong, but a slight alcohol taste comes through. Overtime its bittersweetness becomes its flaw and after awhile it begins to turn me off after it warms.  M: The creaminess to this Stout is pretty amazing and for a Dessert style drink this is exactly what I desire. The carbonation is mildly there, but it's the creaminess that gives this drink it's beauty.  O: The first time I had this drink it tasted as if it had a powdery chocolate taste, baking chocolate. This time around it's still good, but still not great. I won't go out of my way for this drink, but it's still definitely worth trying.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

There’s a sweet chocolaty aroma, obviously, but I’m also picking up something akin to the smell of stale, burnt coffee. If I wasn’t concentrating I would have never noticed it, and it’s not present enough to be off putting, but it’s not the welcoming roasty coffee and espresso notes I associate with a stout, especially one I enjoy so much. Interestingly enough I don’t pick up on the bitter coffee when I drink it, only the chocolate sweetness that’s smooth and sippable, without being overpoweringly strong.

Carob finish and slightly numbing mint and bitter chocolate linger, dry overall. Medium verging on surprisingly light, silky, some chew, some fizz.  Impressively not just chocolate, but some complexity. Maltesers/Whoppers come to mind. Smooth, balanced and drinkable - a bit compulsively so.

Black and milky with a tan head clinging to the glass.  Not much on the nose. The dark chocolate and vanilla are there, but very faint. Not much there regarding aroma.  The taste is very dry. The dark chocolate is pronounced initially, with a vanilla bitterness that finishes it off. Very creamy and full bodied. Extremely smooth. Think of a chocolate Boddington's and you would have this beer exactly. It is definitly dark chocolate as the cocoa flavor is bitter and dry. Not sweet at all. A very decent stout, but not as sweet as I would expect a milk/sweet stout to taste.  I don't think I would order this one again, however I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.

The 4 inch head fades down to a finger or so that stays to the last.  There is a nice sweet chocolate smell that comes out first but doesn't overpower. The nose also has a faint coffee note with the malt and alcohol. The aromas are nicely balanced and serve to entice very well.  Flavors come out similar to the smell. Up front is a little sweetness with a cola like taste and then there is a mouthful of stout: bitter chocolate, light coffee, malt, alcohol.  As you might expect, it is very low on carbonation and the warmth of the alcohol is prominent. It is a bit thin for a stout, but I thought it seemed right for the flavors somehow.  Stouts are in my top 5 style choices, but Young's isn't going to make my top 5 stouts. It isn't hatable, but not lovable either.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Pours black as night, with a finger of creamy, puffy tan-coloured head on top. It doesn't last terribly long, but it leaves behind plenty of lacing. The aroma is nice but very faint, with notes of milk chocolate, coffee, and brown sugar.  Great-tasting pint of beer. Roasted malts, oats and milk chocolate provide the bulk of the flavour, with toffee and baker's cocoa notes as well. Some coffee grind and earthy hops toward the finish, with a bittersweet aftertaste. Much more balanced than the phrase 'double chocolate' led me to believe. Medium-bodied, maybe a bit too thin, but a very creamy mouthfeel. Mildly carbonated.  A great stout, but not a flawless one. Very satisfying, highly recommended, and something I'll probably purchase again some time.  [Updated Dec. 10 2013]  I picked up another bottle, dated 03/09/2014 - not the first time since my last review, I might add. While this doesn't blow me away as much as it used to, it's still one of my favourite sessionable milk stouts from the limited selection available in this market - and the price isn't bad either ($3.50/bottle). It has plenty of cocoa and milk chocolate flavour, while remaining balanced enough to be consumable in large quantities. A very good beer, but not a great one.

Taste: The chocolate tastes more bitter than it smells, but it leaves a very sweet sftertaste. The coffee taste isn't as noticable in the taste as it is in scent. There is a hint of sweet cream and malts in the aftertaste as well.  Mouthfeel: This is an incredibly smooth stout. It's nice and creamy with only a slight bit of carbonation, almost to the point of not being noticed. It's slightly thicker, but that's alright because that adds to the overall smoothness of the stout  Overall: I hadn't had Young's Double Chocolate for almost 2 years up until I had it today.

Dark chocolate is heavy in the aroma followed by a touch of cream and dark roasted malts. Sweet to the nose, very pleasant.  Light in body with a nice full flavor of both dark and milk chocolate. Dark roasted malts give it a good baseline for the chocolate malt and dark chocolate flavors to come out and shine. They give it a creamy sweetness that is somehow refreshing in feel. A light touch of coffee or hop bitterness resides in the back and tingles a little, giving it a crisp finish that actually does really well with this style. Creamy in feel, but with a higher carbonation level that increases drinkability, which is very also high for this beer. At 5.2%, it would be extremely easy to knock back a few of these.

S: A nice, not overpowering mix of burnt caramel, chocolate, and (maybe) olive brine.  T: Ahhh, very nice. Toasted, almost burnt malt is the up-front taste.

Smell: Rich, minty, sawdust tones over a heavy milk chocolate foundation. Slight bitterness. Just a touch of toasty oats.

Color is almost black with a dark head. Even on my last sip there was still almost a finger's worth of head left.  S- There is a great chocolate/coffee smell from the second you open the can. Only a small amount of ""beer"" smell, with a bit of maltiness.  T- This was like nothing I've ever had before. There is an intense chocolate flavor up front with the maltiness trailing behind. I had to slow myself down while drinking it because I kept wanting to get another sass. I believe it may have been too cold at first because it certainly got better with each warming sip.

The aroma reminds me a lot more of coffee (cappuccino, perhaps) than chocolate. The aroma is pleasant, but isn't this supposed to be a chocolate stout, not a coffee stout?  At refrigerator temperature, I was disappointed by this beer as it tasted more like a coffee stout than a chocolate stout to me. It was at warmer temperatures that the dark chocolate tastes started to shine through. The best aspect of this beer is the thick, creamy mouthfeel.

664,73,pBRale,4.13,"Nitro-can poured into a snifter and compared to the bottled version of this beer.  Appearance: Dark black pour with an insanely creamy light cocoa head. The head is so creamy and dense that instead of foaming up, the head foams down into the liquid portion of the beer a good 1.5 inches, stirring up thousands of tiny bubbles that slowly rise and settle into the head, which is about 1/4 of an inch, but very dense and stiff. The retention is absolutely unparalleled, as I finished this beer with almost as full a head as when I first poured it, no exaggeration. Incredible. The lacing is equally as impressive, as a blanket of lace drenches my glass wherever the beer passes over. This is a truly amazing looking beer and fully deserves the 5.0 rating for appearance.  Smell: There is but a hint of roasted malt (the bottled version was much more pronounced), but lots of sweeter toffee-like aromas and loads of dark chocolate. Much more chocolatey than the bottle version, and there is no coffee detectable here. There are also some sweet fruits--especially caramelized banana that I am smelling as the beer warms up a bit.  Taste: The taste is largely of dark chocolate all the way through. It has a nice toffee sweetness near the end, with a bit of the aforementioned fruity taste as well, though it is just a hint. The finish is exceptionally smooth.  Mouthfeel: Only a medium body to medium-thick at best, though that's pushing it. The feel is super creamy--this is a VERY smooth beer. The finish is soft and creamy and is so smooth it is hard to tell both where the finish begins and where it ends. Carbonation is very mild in this beer, which in my opinion could use just a bit more. However, the creaminess of the beer can certainly help counter this quite a bit.  Overall: This is by far the smoothest beer I've had. Personally I would prefer a bit more carbonation. The taste is good, although I definitely prefer the bottle over the can as far as taste goes. The can kicks ass in appearance, smell, and mouthfeel though, so I think the ultimate young's double chocolate stout would be one with the taste of the bottled version combined with the mouthfeel, appearance, and nose of the nitro-can version. Either way you cut it, this is an excellent beer and certainly worthy of a comparison between the versions. I can't believe how different the two beers are--it's hard to believe they are the same beer. I would definitely be interested in trying out this beer on tap/nitro-tap as well to compare with these versions.

First sip brings on a wave of creamy chocolate and just a hint of roasted barley. Roast character seems to add a hint of tobacco but otherwise this one is pretty sweet. Chocolate ice cream in a can?

M: It is medium bodied and very, very smooth. It has a velvety and creamy quality to the feel that is quite pleasant. Only complaint in this aspect is it might be a little thin.  O: It wasn't as sweet as I initially thought it would be, but in spite of not meeting my expectations in this aspect, it was still a very good stout that I will certainly revisit again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,aficionado,3.67,"Dark brown clear body with little lacing.  Chocolate malt balls and wet coffee grinds on the aroma.  Nice dark chocolate flavor. Smooth, yet bitter coffee follows along with some tabacco. Finishes with a really nice mellow milk chocolate flavor that lingers.  Thin body. I would like this to be a bit thicker and sweeter with more flavor. Overall though, it's a decent beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Scotchboy,3.83,"Nitro-can poured into a New Belgium globe.  A: Typical, textbook nitro stout; opaque black body, creamy one-finger tan head sticks around and laces in solid sheets of browns all over the glass.  S: Roasted malt, tons of bitter bakers chocolate, cocoa, and milk chocolate...a fair amount of hop presence that comes off as earthy and bitter. Some coffee in the nose as well.  T: Loves the flavors of dark chocolate, hops and coffee (in that order) but I really think the nitro muddles the flavors here; it's almost watery at first and the flavors really aren't prominent like they should be.  MF: Creamy but still watery in a way. There is a decent amount of dryness as you finish, which I really enjoy in a beer like this.  O: As chocolatey a beer as you'll find this side of Choklat; however this beer showcases the dark, roasty, bitter side of chocolate and isn't ad sweet as other chocolate stouts. A good beer overall, though I'm not a fan of the nitro.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,paulozanello,4.04,"This one is a flagship beer for the Style. The malt bill is Pale, Crystal and Chocolate, also with a blend of adjunct sugars. Hops are British varietals Fuggle and Golding. And, of course, real dark chocolate and chocolate essence (hence the ""Double"" title) to round up things.  It pours a very dark brown color, almost black. One can still see through the pour and if looked against the light, there are still some red hues. The tan head is amazingly creamy and persistent, leaving a good amount of foam on top of the beer for what it seems like forever. Lacing is also spot on.  Aroma is mainly of dark chocolate, cream/milk and cocoa. Less intense are roasted dark malts, cereal grain and a touch of vanilla. Very nice but lacking a bit of power.  Taste is way more centered on roasted dark malts that jump up front right away. Some caramel and bitter cocoa follow also with lactic and coffee notes. English hops then kick in with that slight bitter and earthy character towards the end. Finishes drier than most stouts thanks to hop and roast bitterness. There is no residual sugar and alcohol is not perceptible.  The mouthfeel is stellar and for sure the best part of the beer. Creamy, smooth with medium to low carbonation and body. It is definitely bigger than a Guinness but it still maintains that smooth quality without the Nitro help. Full marks.  Overall this is a textbook beer on this style: every so-called beer drinker should taste it to see what a sweet/milk stout is supposed to be: light, drinkable, creamy, with lots of flavor and balance.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The retention is so good that I could go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and it would still be there. It looks like a wonderful layer of cream. The smell has a nice roasted bitterness to it. There are also some chocolate and coffee aromas to it. The taste is roasty and dry. There are flavors of chocolate and coffee flavors just like the nose. The finish is roasty and slightly dry. The mouthfeel is excellent. It has a medium body and good carbonation. It has a super creamy feel to it. It is roasty and a touch dry. This has great drinkability. I could easily down some pints of this. Since the head never goes away and it is so smooth it is like having a layer of cream on top. wonderful.

S - Definitely smells like a Stout, but with a faint aroma reminding me of chocolate syrup. Smells delicious.  T - Very good. The chocolate character is strong, but not as overpowering as it may be on other chocolate stouts. Stays true to its dry stout characteristics, which barely avoids being overwhelmed by the sweet chocolate.  M - Feels very light and creamy, almost like whipped cream.

Taste is, well, look, it's not gonna taste exactly like chocolate milk as the name might imply. But it's still very smooth and chocolatey, with notes of coffee bitterness.

Smell: Hot, dark chocolate. Very sweet chocolate malts. Roasted chocolate. Just heavy... chocolate.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Very sweet malt flavor that was separate from a very dark chocolate flavor. It wasn't like a milk chocolate flavor, it was reminiscent of baker's chocolate surrounded by sweetness. Not syrupy like I anticipated. Chewy. No heavy aftertaste that is sometimes received with choco stouts. Light carbonation that decently balanced out the heavy chocolates.  Overall: Good stout. Lacked complexity that I enjoy. I am fairly certain I sampled this before on tap while travelling in Atlanta and I remember it having a much fuller body than what I experienced from the bottle.

There is almost a burnt coffee and/or chocolate flavor to it-- perhaps its just dark chocolates? A catch a bit of hops to give it a bit on an imperial accent. Sandwiched in the sweet and bitter is a big dark malt that holds it together.  Mouth: Totally smooth. Mouth is almost left with that mucusy feeling you get when you have had some milk. A bit heavy I thought.  Overall: I really have not developed a taste for this style yet much to my own frustration.

Aroma of dark roasted malt with hints of burnt grain, coffee and molasses, accompanied by distinct overtones of sweet chocolate and caramel.  Tastes of roasted malt with a subtle sweetness and nicely rounded finish. Notes of burnt grain, coffee, cocoa, molasses and dry stewed hops. The 'chocolatiness' is less obvious on the palate than the nose. A bitterness upon swallowing; reminscent of plain cocoa and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, though a bit thinner than expected. Aftertaste of roasted malt and bitter cocoa.  Rich and flavoursome. Plenty of dark flavours going on, with the chocolate blending nicely into the mix. I sort of expected it to dominate the flavour profile, but it matches the overall character well.

This beer is in a completely different category. Only tried one other ""Chocolate Stout"", the other by Rogue.  Picked this up at a fantastic store Total Wine in Kennesaw, Georgia. Definitely one I was looking forward to trying.  Diving in...  A - Dark and sticky. Not much of a head, but there is a small layer hanging in there on the top. Can't get much of any color besides black...a little brownish color there too. So rich looking.  S - Smells a little metallic, which seems to be evident on my nose in most stouts. Picking up the alcohol. The bitter chocolate is very present as well.  T - Picking up on the roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate. The alcohol is present...strange. Almost like drinking an iced and carbonated coffee drink. I couldn't drink too many of these...a little too rich for my liking.  O - I respect this beer enough that I would definitely drink one with my friends. Although, if I had to be absolutely honest, I wouldn't buy a pack of these for my own pleasure at home. There are others that will please my palate more.  Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10. The only other stouts I've enjoyed more is Samuel Smith's Oatmeal and Rogue's Chocolate Stout.

Lesser notes of caramel and a vanilla finish. No real bitterness to speak of from hops, most comes from the dark malt. It is a dessert beer in my opinion, so the fact that there isn’t a bitterness to balance it out is fine by me.  M - The beer feels thick upfront but feels lighter after the initial sip.

664,73,output01x,3.96,"Poured from a 440 mL. nitro-can (Best By 02/10/12) into a pint glass.  A slow pour yields a 2-finger tan-colored head that looks more like a whipped topping than froth. The body is a near-black brown with minute traces of mahogany red when held to light. The head never dies and always maintains at least a 1/2-finger coating. Lacing is too thick and massive to stick to the glass sides and constantly falls back to the head.  While subtle, the nose is by no means weak or lacking. With delicious aromas of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, and vanilla, the nose is practically pleasurable.  The taste starts off with sweet cream. As the beer is held in the mouth, a roasted bitterness starts to come through. Once swallowed, milk chocolate, fresh coffee, and almond butter flavors trickle over the taste buds. After a moment, these flavors start to fade to a dry coffee aftertaste.  Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation, this beer will always be one of the most drinkable stouts on the market. The body has a good thickness to it but is not sticky or coating in the least. The carbonation is not fizzy at all (except for the foam from the head that sticks to my upper lip) and gives the beer an excellent creamy, easy-drinking mouthfeel.

There are some toasted malts, also some dark chocolate, even a little bit of coffee, but WAY too subtle.  Taste: Yep. Exactly what I want a Sweet Stout to be. First there is the smokey toffee malts that set up the stout experience. Then from the middle of the mouth to the finish there are definite notes of semi - sweet chocolate and cocoa powder mixed with caramel malt. As the flavor degrades a sweetness from the bread-biscuit malt takes over. Absolutely no bitterness or hop flavors. Delicious.  Mouth feel: Okay, not exactly chewy, but it is still a medium to full mouth feel. Maybe that is not such a bad thing, because it encourages more drinks, allowing more of that beer to get in my belly.  Overall: The taste on this sweet stout is spot on. I really believe that the taste should serve as a bench mark for this kind of beer. It is unfortunate that the nose lacks what the palate gets.  Also, the mouth feel could use some fine tuning.

664,73,BarryMFBurton,4.14,"Young’s Double Chocolate Stout has intrigued me ever since I first stepped into a liquor store. Imported, funny-shaped bottle…and who doesn’t like chocolate? I finally picked it up on a random beer run while waiting for my car to get out of the shop. Now’s a good a time as any to try a classic brew like this, right?  A: This one pours a very deep brown; it’s almost black. The head is superb, bubbling up like a thick, beige whipped cream. Excellent retention and some really spectacular lacing give this one of the most sophisticated looks I’ve seen from a stout. It’s one of those examples of timeless beer beauty.  S: Mild, British malts take the stage first in this one; they come off rich and earthy, a textured and complex juxtaposition. The dark chocolate is there, not surprisingly, but it comes off as a more balanced agent than I would have expected from a “Double Chocolate Stout.” I’m not complaining, though; the fact that the scents are so gentle makes me instantly think of a British pub drink. It’s alright for the style.  T: Wow; it’s almost like I can feel myself being transported to a small, family-owned pub in England with every sip. It must be the water, because I’ve never had a feeling like that from an American beer. It’s a uniquely bitter, mineral-like tone, and it’s the first thing you taste in this beer. Hell of a start. The bitter character of the water works incredibly well with the roasted barley and leafy hops that come next. These toffee, roasted coffee, and tart lemon/lime flavors become the focus of the majority of the body. Chocolate is merely a supporting character, which is great: a semi-sweet nod to the palate is much better than an oozy chocolate sweetness. All these flavors, plus a slight hint of dry yeasts, combine to form a lightly dry finish. The chewiness of the grains sticks with you for a while, as does the hop bite.  M: Very, very traditional in the feel. It’s light and a bit watery, but there’s a bubbly pop that makes up for it.  O: I can definitely see myself coming back to this beer. It's classically delicious, with more than enough complexity to satisfy me in many different situations. This is what I think of when I imagine a traditional English pub beer: smooth, light, and uniquely bitter.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Reminded me of when I left motor oil laying around in containers until I could take it to a recycling center. The smell to me was too much. I like chocolate,but to me this was a cheap Kahlua imitation. Very hard to bring this to my lips. Forturnately the taste was much better,a nice balance of sweet and bitterness.If only the odor was different. The bottle date was 3/19/11.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,rudzud,4.06,"Picked up a can of this at Julio's. Cant believe it took this long for me to try this.  A - Pours into my Duvel tulip an oily stout pour with that great creamy nitro head. Super rich and creamy two finger head that leaves very nice side lacing and never really fades.  S - Some nice chocolate and roasted malts on the nose. For being a ""double chocolate"" would like to see more.  T - Wow, this is really, really nice. Nice creamy, rich milk chocolate along with lightly smokey roasted malts. There is a very slight hop bitterness with this. Delicious.  M - The problem with most nitro beers is this, a horrible lack of mouthfeel. This, while nice and smooth and creamy, is super low carb. Feels flat and watery on the tongue.  O - Overall this is a delicious milk stout. While I love the look that nitro gives a beer, I would rather have an average head but some legitimate mouthfeel. Still, would gladly buy again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,socon67,3.87,"A - Pours dark brown to black in a chalice. Cream colored foam is then, and no lacing.  S - The scent of chocolate was more noticeable is it warmed. There are also underlying smells of malt and licorice. A subtle bit of smoke is also hitting the nose.  T - Pretty good, but a bit disappointed that the scents don't translate as much to the taste. This guy has a milk chocolate malty flavor and a hint of sweetness. I equate it to chocolate pudding. But the other more subtle scents are not to be found int he taste.  M - Light bodied given the style, and minimal carbonation. Solid but would like a robust back end.  O - Probably the best of this style and a great stout for food. It is an extremely drinakable stout and perfect for a stout drinker looking for something in hot weather and other situations where a heavy stout is not ideal.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CFHMagnet,3.81,"A. A lazy pour got just over a finger of milky beige head that looks like cream on top of a mocha or other coffee type of drink. The body is a deep dark brown, almost like a cola when you look closely and see the bubbles in the glass. Head retention is great, as it doesn't seem to shrink smaller than a half-finger. Pretty nice lacing as well.  S. The main aroma is chocolate, but I also get roasted nuts and a bit of sweet malt.  T. The first impression is chocolate milk, but each sip builds on this beer's character. Sweet malt is rather understated but the roasted nuttiness noted in the nose does show up and slowly build. A faint coffee shows up in front after its had a chance to warm a bit.  M. Full bodied, this beer is a mouthful. Although carbonation is noted on the glass, it has absolutely no bite. The beer isn't sticky at all, and isn't overly drying either. It is very creamy though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,TheRealBigC,4.16,"On tap at 775 Gastropub  Really nice creamy head with excellent retention. Obvious stoutly thick, dark body.  A decent chocolate fragrance comes through, especially when you get your nose in that head.  Very chocolatey taste, as one would hope, with a little bit of bittersweet and a little milky sweet, but there are plenty of complexities in the beer to make it fun. Very creamy, thick mouthfeel. A 20oz. of this can go down pretty easily but it's thickness can sink in your stomach pretty well and one is definitely enough.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T - Raw coffee beans, and dark chocolate not as much as I wanted, but as the beer got almost room temperature I could taste it more and could feel the dark chocolate linger in my after taste.  M - A little bit too much carbonation for me and a slight watery finish.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S - Smells like a roasted coffee  T - Maybe I just got a strange bottle, but I couldn't taste as much chocolate as I expected. I got mostly toasty coffee flavor with just a slight bitterness.  M - Could use a little more carbonation in my opinion, but otherwise good.  O - Overall a pretty solid beer, I would definitely buy it again.

T: Starts with a slightly bitter chocolate taste. In the middle the chocolate sweetens in a milky chocolate taste. On the backend, there is some more milk chocolate and vanilla with a slight roasted taste as an undertone.  M: Was not as thick and rich as expected. Leaves a slightly slick sweet taste on the palate.  O: I am not a huge fan of brews on nitro, but this one was tasty. A great example of a milk stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mebuzzard,3.98,"I don't think I've seen this one on a tap that isn't nitro...wish I would someday. The nitro smoothes it out toom much, taking away the chocolate bitterness a bit. At the same time, the nitro head makes the beer look fantastic! Dark and light contrast.  Chocolate aroma is present and seems to dominate, but the roastiness is there, with some minerals. The taste is quite good, perhaps a little loose. I feel the nitro also thins it out a bit.

664,73,BobZ,3.95,"Pint bottle (16.9 oz) poured into my Duvel Tulip. Time to finally review this beer having had it on tap multiple times; I decided to finally pull that old bottle out of the cellar.  Appearance: Dark brown, a very nice tan head of about 1” that recedes to a 1/8” and hangs around. Very nice sticky lacing. Smell: Very big on the chocolate (no surprise) almost smells like Bosco or Hershey’s syrup mixed with a bit of roasted malt.  Taste: Sweet and chocolaty without being “overly sweet”, not cloying at all. Nice notes of bitter chocolate on the finish. This beer executes the chocolate stout style very well, rich chocolate flavor yet well balanced. I think I may prefer this beer to Southern Tier Choklat. Great dessert beer with Cheesecake  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated clean on the palate and smooth.  Overall: A solid example of a Chocolate Stout the right beer for the right mood or perhaps time (dessert).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Hojaminbag,3.66,"Young's double chocolate has the typical nitro-tap-stout look to it. Cascading brown runs into a darker brown body. The body is opaque, and the head eventually settles into a very solid looking brown slab. Retention and lacing are both predictably great.  I've always felt that nitrogen kills the aroma on beers, and whether it's all in my head or not, I would say that happens here. Faint chocolate and dark malt.  The flavor has a good bit of chocolate, but it manages to avoid becoming one-dimensional or overly sweet. After the chocolate, a little bit coffee comes through, and then some sweetness from dark malt. Just a hint of roast.  Big smooth mouthfeel.  It's possible that this is the first time that I have tried Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which is surprising considering it's the type of beer you can find in a lot of places. Maybe I've been hanging out in to many beer bars that think it isn't exciting enough to have on tap. Whatever the reason I haven't tried this one, I'm glad that I did. Pretty good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,sevefan,4.12,"Bottle from Beers of Europe.co.uk  First experience of this stout after reading so so many reviews. So here goes as my first pint glass is 75% finished....  A. Jet black with a biscuity beige frothy head - not a creamy head like I was expecting. Lacing is very slight on glass and head has almost gone.  S. I can smell bittersweet rich chocolate, Cadburys Drinking Chocolate, brown sugar, smoke, leather and hops.  T. I taste a hoppy, sweet chocolately flavour. Bittersweet with perhaps slightly more bitter than sweet. Forgive me but any burps that I have had are chocolately!!! After taste is more hoppy than chocolate.  M. Thinner than I expected but very smooth and easy to drink.  O. A very nice stout and definately up there with the Meantime and Saltaire chocolate creations. A bit disappointed, expected a bit more chocolate for my liking. I have 7 more bottles to get through, perhaps my review will be altered by that time...looking forward to them all!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T - You know that expensive bitter dark chocolate claiming to be from exotic far corners of the globe? Like that but tastier. A vague red grape flavour coming through with a trace of coffee. Nive balance of bitter and sweet. Very tasty.  M - Smooth but not as creamy as I had expected. Seems more carbonated than the stouts Ive had.  O - Love it. Wouldve been incredible I think with a slice of mudcake and a dollop of ice cream. Pair with a desert and dont drink it too cold.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,aeolianshredhead,4.46,"A- Quite good looking. Very dark brown with a big brown head which retains fairly well.  S- Smells fantastic, with a very appealing milk chocolate scent followed up with beautiful dark fruit and coffee hints. Truly excellent.  T- Fantastic notes of milk chocolate laced with coffee and a nice hop presence. The dark fruit on the nose isn't quite as prevalent as I thought it would be but still, it tastes great. Quite sweet.  M- Double-edged sword here. For the style, it seems to have a too-thin, watery texture. However, if it was thicker, then it would not be so sessionable. Carbonation is at a pleasant level.  O- Perfect for a winters night. Tastes fantastic and highly drinkable. I am truly impressed by this. I suppose the weak mouthfeel is the only discernible hiccup.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,oline73,4.18,"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. This has been one of my favorites for a long time.  Appearance: Pours almost black with a very little bit of light coming through around the edges. A finger of very nice looking thick tan head fades fairly quickly to just a layer on top of the pour.  Smell: Not very strong. Smells a bit like a chocolate bar, but with some roast in there as well. A bit sweet.  Taste: Initially there is a nice sweet chocolate flavor. Good amount of chocolate flavor given the fact that this isn't a very strong beer. There is also a slightly bitter roasty flavor that I'm mostly picking up in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with very smooth carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall: Like I said before, this is one of my favorites. The body could be a little thicker, but not a lot to complain about. Of course I'll have another.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,annawees,3.78,"Poured from on tap in to a pint glass.  The beer is a lovely espresso shade, but the head does not linger. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and toasted malts and the level of sweetness would be comparably to a very high-end dark chocolate bar.  Unfortunately the stout is very thin and it left me wanting something with a richer creamier texture to complement the flavor.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,HumanParaquat,4,"Pours a rich dark brown, almost black in color. Develops an impressive brown paper bag-colored head; about three fingers. Leaves good lacing, but the head dissipates fairly quickly.  A simple, yet pleasing aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts and coffee.  A perfect trifecta of chocolate milk, coffee and beer. Chocolate flavors are everywhere on the palette, along with subtle vanilla notes...even a hint of gingery spice up front. Well balanced with a dry, bittersweet coffee finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit higher in carbonation than I'd like, but still creamy and velvety smooth.  A very delicious stout. I'd like to see how the bottled variety compares to a nitro-can or on tap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Color is real dark, nearly opaque with very little chocolate/creamy tan colored head Smell is of lots of chocolate and possibly some dark fruits..not much coffee or oats spilling over either. This is a really good chocolate offering. Smell is heavy chocolate and lots of malt. Mouthfeel is slippery but not as thick as most stouts I enjoy, but reminiscent of the thin-body of a guinness or something. This was the only drawback.  Overall - can't go wrong with this one. Awesome offering this one is.  Cheers",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bayougutter,3.63,"Poured the darkest of browns with no light peeking thru. Nice two finger head that left rather quickly but leaves good lacing.  Smell is chocolate milk, roasted malts, dark fruits and some coffee.  Taste is chocolate milk thruout with roasted malts and some coffee ground bitterness. Not bad.  Mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout and a little flat at the end of the drink.  Overall this is a different but good take on a chocolate stout with good cocoa and chocolate flavors as the main charactors, a little thin but.... it has sone good points. worth a try.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GregSVT,4.08,16oz can with the widget into a snifter  A: Pours a translucent dark brown with a very nice tan creamy thick head that never fades to anything more than a large layering and leaves tons of lacing on the glass.  S: The nose is mostly creamy chocolate milk and slightly roasted malt. There's a slight coffee aroma in there as well.  T: The flavors are the same as the aromas. Big chocolate milky flavors with slight coffee and vanilla flavors as well.  M: It's very light bodied but extremely creamy from the nitro widget. I'd like it to be a bit fuller in body but I think it works.  O: Out of the bottle this thing is atrocious but from a nitro tap or nitro can it's wonderful. Amazing how good carbonation can save a super thin stout. I'd like a bit more from the flavor and aroma areas but they are no where near bad.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,fountainofyouth,3.8,"I had this once and was disappointed, but I decided to give it another go. Poured from a 16.9oz bottle to a Nonic glass.  Appearance: Very dark brown, completely opaque. Even with a moderately paced pour, there's almost no head. A thin film of off-white bubbles forms. Surprisingly, there's enough to leave some lacing.  Smell: Not overwhelming, but pleasant. I smell malt up front and a touch of hops. Finishes with sweetish chocolate. Maybe a little bit of booze.  Taste: The taste is bolder than I remember. (I think the first time may have been a can, whereas this is a bottle.) There's bittersweet chocolate up front followed closely by familiar dark, roasted malt. The front of the mouth is pretty sweet, while the finish is bitter. (The bitterness comes from the malt -- there's almost no hops to speak of.) Lingering acidic/metallic flavor is a small minus. Overall, it's sweeter than a dry stout, but doesn't have the lactic flavor of a milk stout.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Carbonation is light but prickly. Feel is slick.  Overall: Much better than the watery crud I got from the can. I'd love to try it on tap!  EDIT: I just tried it in can form again. It's got a widget, so there's a really impressive nitro feel to it. Unfortunately, it does rob a good portion of the flavor. Good, but too watery.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T- Chocolate comes through here, but doesn't overpower the malts and roastiness here. Really good subdued chocolate flavor.  O- A classic that you can never go wrong with, great for dessert and a good way for me to convince my girlfriend to try some beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Knapp85,4.23,One of the ultimate dessert beers on the market today. This beer poured out of the nitro can as a milky brown color that surged into a deep blackish brown color. The head was creamy and thick like a Guinness typically looks. The smell is of some roasted malts and a ton of rich chocolate. The taste is full of chocolate too. The mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth. Overall this beer is kickass when drank at the right time.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,psuKinger,4.09,"Nitro-Can poured into my Pittsburgh Pirates pint during the Pirates-Cubs game. Bucco's are currently up by 8; my hope is this beer does just as well:  A: Pours an awesome, cascading creamy dark color with a thick off-white head on top that neared settling in about 30 seconds or so... Impressive.  S: Muted notes of creamy sweetness... ""roastiness"" barely detectable. I don't really pick up much chocolate in the nose.  T: Big creamy sweetness sits on top of a delightfully light and smooth roasty beer. To be honest, this is a pleasant surprise for me. Lots of creamy sweetness, and the chocolate, although not dominant, is present in the creamy sweetness.  This beer has a lot of enjoyable gentle approachable flavors. Nothing ""big"" or ""bold"", and sometimes that's a nice thing.  M: Remarkably light and creamy. Lots and lots of ""creamy head"", but with no ""distracting"" carbonation, that really works for this beer. Very cool.  D/O: Very drinkable, surprisingly well even on a hot summer day. Overall, this beer doesn't ""punch you in the mouth"" like some stouts but is just super sweet and simple. Genuinely enjoyable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Kartoffeln,4.18,"A: Pours coffee-black with a big, rocky tan head of creamy carbonation that gradually settles to a thick cap of fine foam. Leaves plenty of lacing.  S: Cocoa powder, bittersweet dark chocolate, caffe mocha, roasted malts, and a sweet hint of molasses.  T: Chocolate malt, cocoa, and a mild sweetness like icing sugar give way to robust flavours of dark chocolate and roasted malts with notes of coffee, nuts, butter, and toffee. Faint, slightly herbal, earthy hops come through in the finish.  M: Full, creamy body with minimal carbonation; somewhat chewy and slightly sticky. The long, bitter finish is nuanced - hops, bittersweet chocolate, and roasted malts all discernable - and balances the chocolatey flavour quite well.  D: An excellent stout characterised, but not dominated, by its nuanced chocolate flavour without it feeling too sweet or like a novelty. Quite drinkable despite the full body, it's a twist on the usual meal-in-a-bottle stout: instead, it's dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

This pours a black color with a light brown finger width thick head with tiny nitro induced bubbles. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate, the smell is pretty mellow though. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy as expected from the nitro can. The taste is more watery that I remember (an effect of the nitro can or the past best date beer?). The main taste is of chocolate and roasted malts with a smoked / chocolate after flavor with a slight bitterness which lingers for a while. This out of a can is smoother and more session like than I remember from the bottle but its also more subdued and not as tasty. I'll stick to the bottles from now on.

A very tasty treat, and easily among the best couple of chocolate brews I've ever had (right next to Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout).  Re-review 5 years later:  First, this bottle was aged over 3 years past it’s “best by” date, so take that into consideration.  Appearance: Foamy black/brown with sudsy foam.  Aroma: Cocoa and some roasty malts. Not bad.  Taste: Very mild but definitely chocolate here. Body is quite light and watery, but definitely tastes of chocolate and cocoa powder through and through.

I get the roasted malts, cocoa, and coffee followed with a sweetness that is undeniable. There is also a slight nutty and buttery yumminess to the brew.  Mouthfeel - This brew is medium to heavy in body and the creaminess is heavenly with little carbonation.  Overall - You really can't go wrong with this Choco Stout.

Single finger of light tan head falls in a minute or two to a broken sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.  S: dry cocoa up front and really not too much else here. Some hints of roasted malts and coffee, both of which are quite faint. Smells quite sweet.  T: Milk chocolate with hints of coffee, raisin, charred toast and a bit of dust. This is a good milk stout. I wish they didn't highlight the chocolate aspect of the beer so much because this is actually quite well done for a milk/sweet stout. The lactose really sweetens the ale and adds a silky feel; well crafted.  M: Heavy and velvety with resonating silken finish on the upper palate and tongue.

Dark fruits in the background give it a fruit side note. Simple but aromatic and strong.  T - Lots of coffee in the taste more so than chocolate. There's a good hop bitterness to balance out the dark chocolate sourness. That roasted coffee still pushes through in the end. Should of been called dark coffee stout.  M - Medium bodied, smooth, carbonation is bordering high but feels right.  I haven't had this one in a while but I'm impressed.

Slightly spicy with a good hit of pepper but otherwise it's very coffee-like.  M - Mildly spicy at first but after that it's quite smooth & soothing.

Smelled quite chocolately with a roasted scent and hints of coffee. I also believe I picked up a faint note of molasses.  Taste follows the nose. A roasted, very chocolatey flavor Never really gets that bitter at all. Has a respectably creamy mouthfeel. Smooth and quaffable. I could knock a few of these down and do it gladly.

664,73,PreacherBrewer,4.33,"A - Guinness-like presentation. Waterfall/Cascade effect when poured. Pitch black with a creamy kaki head.  S - Milk chocolate candy bar. Glass of Milk.  T - Loads of chocolate right off the bat. Roasted barley in the middle. Chocolate milk after-taste comes from lactose.  M - The creamiest beer I've ever had. Wow. Thick, smooth, perfect.

664,73,DoubleSimcoe,3.84,"Young's Double, nitro-can bought at New Beer Dist. in NYC for $2.75. My first in the style! Very curious...  Appearance: Damn gorgeous! Just like a nitro-tap, it pours creamy, luscious and smooth. Take your time admiring the head form up and become a thick two-finger crown that lasts and lasts. I bet if I left and came back after a few hours, that massive head would still be there! And the lacing, oh my. It's like the Great Wall of China. Color is an incredibly deep black, if you can get past the outrageous head.  Smell: Some nice (if not complex) roastiness, like vacuum-packed coffee and commercial-grade chocolate (Ghirardelli's). A bit of milk and a ton of sugary sweetness. A dessert beer!  Taste: Again, nothing terribly complex here, but what a nice taste! Smooth cocoa powder and a tad of bitterness, roasted aromas, sugar, chocolate cake from an American diner. Judging by the label (""chocolate flavor added""), I thought this would taste fake and artificial. Not at all.  Mouthfeel: Obviously, super creamy and smooth to a fault. Very sweet and chocolaty as it goes down, delicious! Reasonably low (and adequate) carbonation.  Overall: This is a great beer. I had my reservations- a lot of folks don't like these nitro-cans, but what's not to love? You get the yummy richness of a nitro pour and all the flavor. Plus the alcohol is low and the taste is great so you have an off-the-beaten-path session beer here!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,claspada,3.87,"First nitro-can review? Who knows.  Aromas of lightly roasted malt and cocoa powder, not too much of either. No hops or real in-depth caramel or anything else really.  The tastes follow the nose with sublte roasted malt and moderately sweet chocolate. As it warms the above flavors become slightly more pronounced.  The nitro-can pour makes the mouthfeel nice and creamy and full with ample carbonation. I have had the bottled version as well, but this is much better.  Overall, Young's Double Chocolate Stout is nice sessionable stout. One of my go-to beers when I need something that won't put me to bed. The perfect winter day drinking beer. I have mixed it half and half with Wells Banana bread beer, which is an excellent anytime after dinner beverage.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jgurley,4.58,"Nice black color with a small head and spotty lacing. Smell of dark roasty malt and cocoa. Delicious milky chocolate and malt taste. Dark roast, coffee, but not sweet.

664,73,Stunner97,3.66,"Appearance- pours and absolutely beautiful billowing foamy head and just nice cascading look, nitro beers to me are always a real victory when it comes to appearance  Smell- is of definitely faint chocolate but alot of coffee notes to and roasted malts  Taste- the flavor is not overally rich or complex to me but non the less pretty good, the chocolate is there but not as overwhelming as you think it would be, as on the nose I really got even more off the coffee roasted malts even more then really chocolate, simple flavor but nice  Mouthfeel - very creamy and smooth, light bodied  Drinkability/overall- this beer was not quite as good honestly as the last time I had it which i believe was out of the regular bottle and not nitrocanned, i wonder if the non nitro version has bit more flavor despite not as good mouthfeel and such, the beer was quite drinkable but not something I would go to all the time as was just kind of more simple then i remembered, all said and done though this is still pretty nice beer",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Thin legs of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and chocolate syrup in milk. Taste is of roasted malt and chocolate syrup. Mild cocoa bitterness on the palate quickly fades. Due to the nitro-tap this beer is very thick and creamy. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but not one I would get too often. I am glad I got to try this one on nitro-tap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,yeahnatenelson,3.96,"Appearance -- Pours an impenetrable dark brown with a finger of everlasting creamy beige head. No highlighting to speak of, the look of moonless midnight.  Smell -- Most definitely the least appealing of this beer's assets. Off the bat there is a whiff of metal can. Additionally there is some condensed milk sweetness, charred roast malt, Yoo-Hoo. Not terribly aromatic, and the metallic smell is a distraction. Meh.  Taste -- A pleasant abundance of roast character - coffee, burnt toast, but not ashy. And then there is the chocolate. Bittersweet, bordering on milk chocolate. Not overly sweet, very much in proportion with the black malt bitterness and earthy, mildly vegetal hops. Finish is cocoa and black malt.  Mouthfeel -- Medium-full in body, with gentle creamy carbonation. The lactose has added even more of a velvety feel beyond the effects of the nitro widget. I can't imagine any better feel for the style.  Overall -- Really an exceptional example of the style. The lactose is used to great effect, rounding the sharp corners of all of that patent malt. And the chocolate! Vibrant chocolate earthy/sweet flavor, but without an overwhelming amount of malt sweetness to may this seem cloying or decadent. Played pitch perfect.  Don't get me wrong, I feel that I've had better milk stouts, but very few.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WankelEngine,4.25,"Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a pint glass  A: Very dark opaque brown bordering on black. There is a bubbly tan head with excellent retention and moderate layered lacing.  S: Smells strongly of chocolate with a backbone of coffee. The smell reminds me of a sweet mocha but less potent.  T: Very strong chocolate taste but not overwhelming. The chocolate flavor from the malt is sort of the classic roasted flavor, but there is also chocolate flavor from the real added chocolate. This contributes a dryer, darker chocolate than the malt alone could. In the background there is a dry herbal taste. The aftertaste is short and mild.  M: Very smooth and surprisingly light with mild carbonation. Easy to drink.  O: Dominated by chocolate but not overly sweet.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,SkunkWorks,3.75,"Had this on tap and in the bottle, time for in the nitro can! Tall boy poured into a Stone Imperial pint.  Look: black body with a solid finger's worth of mocha colored, Guinness inspired head, that retains forever but doesn't leave any lacing behind. Looks like something out of a Guinness commercial.  Smell: light chocolate notes with some roasted grain but not much else. A little lighter on the chocolate than the other two versions I've had for some reason.  Taste: I can't help but feel that the nitro-can affected the taste somewhat. This tastes closer to a dry Irish stout than a milk stout, think a stronger Guinness with a bit of chocolate in the finish. Its still good but not as good as the other versions I'm afraid.  Feel: medium body, creamy but very sparse carbonation. The carbonation is oddly low, especially for a stout of this size, and so it will have to take a hit here. Still, makes for an easy drinking, sessionable desert brew.  Overall: decent, but not extraordinary. I think this beer is best on tap. The remaining beers from my 4 pack of nitro cans will be reserved for their original purpose; cooking. Cheers!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Treebs,3.03,"Poured from bottle to pint glass.  A: Pours a darker hued brown with 1 finger bubbly off-white head. Leaves a thin lace ring around the edges of the brew.  S: Bitter/roasty malts come up big in the forefront. Some slight chocolate is present but you really have to search for it.  T: Only a slight roast is present with bitter chocolate and a semi sweet vanilla but it fades pretty quickly into a watered down coffee with a sugary afterbite.  M: Easily drinkable. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation. There really aren't any discernible flavors after the drink has gone down though.  O: I wasn't very impressed with this brew. The flavors were there but they didn't grasp my taste buds and linger like I want a beer like this to. Still ok, but not my favorite.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Brittmb29,3.95,"On tap at World of Beer Coconut Creek, FL  First full pint stout I've committed myself to and i wasn't disappointed:  A- Dark Black/brown body w/ no light penetration. great thick tan-white head ~3/4""-1"", still settling up as it was served. Served cold in a 12 oz (or 16, not positive) magner's cider glass.  S- Head gives off coffee aromas with some malty sweetness, smell develops as beer warms to more appropriate temperature; then more chocolate and espresso notes notes come out.  T- First sips after receiving beer and letting head settle are a bit harsh, on coffee w/ too much head. However this beer is not best ice cold but a little more warmed up, cool - lukewarm was the best flavor because the beer only improved as it finished. roasted coffee balance by 'chocolate' flavor, best described as a mocha flavor and the milky sweetness only adds to the mocha affect. only malt and roasty profile NO hop flavor which was what I was looking for in the stout for that night.  M- Creamy goodness from the head once it warms up, as it is very dense when ice cold off draft. The body of the beer however was on the thinner side of stouts w/no carbonation which was fine because it delivers strong flavor and the head compensates.  D- Very drinkable w/o too high ABV, could have easily had another. plan on drinking this again as it's easy to find on draft and in can/bottle at my WOB. Not so sweet even though its chocolatey.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MrHassellYaHurd,3.7,"Pours a deep garnet-brown with a creamy off-white head. Very reminiscent of a cola.  The smell is intensely chocolatey; not unlike the chocolate syrup for ice cream, as well as of bitter cocoa powder. There is a malty sweet aroma, as well. This beer is fairly simple, but quite pleasant to the nose.  The backbone of this brew is of a gently sweet malt and a slightly bitter roasted flavor, with the semisweet chocolate flavors bringing it all together.  Light to medium-bodied, grainy texture. Great drinkability.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ash111,4.8,"I love this beer. It's one of the first beers I remember loving, and I've never looked back. It pours an opaque black with a thick head, typical of a nitro can. The head is a thing of beauty all by itself (and with a good bar tender ordering one of these becomes an experience in and of itself).  Taste is wonderful. Coffee, chocolate, malt are all present. Mouthfeel is a little watery for a beer this dark, but oh well.

664,73,TheHoppiest,3.74,"Had this one at the Chocolate Bar in downtown Cleveland. This was the only beer offered that could even be half-way decently paired with their chocolate-dominated menu.  Poured from a can into a mug. Pours a deep dark brown with a thick, creamy tan head that remained throughout the entire beer. The nitro-can really worked well to maintain the beautiful head on this beer.  Smells of barley malt, with a hint of dark chocolate.  Has a thin malt taste, with definite bitter dark chocolate notes. The chocolate taste is bitter enough almost to qualify as a baker's chocolate taste -- a bitternes that surely is helped along by the hop presence that finishes this beer.  Has a medium body mouthfeel, with a dry finish.  Decent beer, especially considering this is out of the can. Definitely need to let it warm so that the taste can really come through.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bobhits,3.98,"Why do I keep going into coffee/espresso stouts and tasting chocolate and chocolate stouts and tasting coffee/espresso?  This one pours a rather thin and light mahogany which turns black in the glass and leaves Guinness levels of head, lacing and retention. Simply lovely looking head and lace with a touch light and thin body.  Smells of deep dark roasted espresso with dark bitter chocolate well in the back ground. A coffee forward nose to say the least.  Bitter, that’s the word for what I’m tasting here. Simi sweet chocolate opens this one, but it soon turns to a dash of hops and then a simply in your face coffee bitterness I haven’t experienced before. I think this beer shows for once a place where better flavors are created with less alcohol. The big coffee stouts put in so much malt that things balance. This one leaves things nice and bitter, the way the beer gods intended. As I drink this the coffee dies and the chocolate strengthens.  Perhaps the only flaw for me is the mouth feel. The carbonation doesn’t hold up past the pour and the body is somewhat light and watery. That said I think it does the job required.  I’ve had this before and simply doesn’t recall it being this good. Maybe it is the larger bottle, maybe this one is fresher, maybe I’ve gone mad. Either way this just really great beer and worth of the praise. 5.2% has simply never been this dark and this good (please read a beer this dark has never better this good at that abv, not that this is the best 5.2 or less abv beer, it isn’t).

For some reason, it looses something when bottled that is captured when canned. This has a slightly sweet, milky and definitely chocolatey flavor.

Mid profile the roast builds into a cleaner bitter char note, as sweet chocolate pulls out from behind the malt to balance the mounting bitterness.  M – Medium full body.

Taste: Starts with a very sweet chocolate taste ending with a bitter coffee/chocolate note.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and creamy mouthfeel.

Pours dark brown to black with a typical cascading nitro effect, ends up with a one and a half finger tan head that leaves some walls of lacing behind and retains exceptionally well.  Aroma is of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and some bread. Rather subdued but this is typical of nitro beers in my experience.  Flavor is nice chocolate, most akin to semi-sweet chocolate chips, there is some coffee, roasted malt and caramel there as well but the chocolate is the star of course. Fair sweetness, zero bitterness or alcohol.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied but very smooth and creamy thanks to the nitro pour.

Poured from the 14.9 oz. nitro can that I bought at Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio for $2.25 last night into my Brewery Ommegang Westvleteren style gold rimmed goblet. Stamped on the bottom of the can: BBD 10Feb 12 10:42 PD 10/02/2011 G4 Side of the can states: “Best before see base of can” so that leads me to think that it is best before Feb 10, 2012 but I am not sure what the other date (PD?) is.  A Pours an absolutely silky smooth head with maybe the smallest “nitro can” bubbles that I have ever seen. I mean really, only once before have I seen a silkier, smoother looking head and that was on a nitro Guinness. The body is jet black and it took several minutes for the head to settle up on the top. The look simply could not be improved upon. 5.0  S Dark, dark roast malt with a dark chocolate background. It does not, however, have the nice deep, even soft smell of my favorite from this style. 4.0  T Dark roast malt, the chocolate is there as it was in the smell but it is more thin tasting than I would like. I have found that to be the case in English beers and I think that this one falls in line with that quality. I have tasted better in the style and better Stouts with Chocolate added. The one within the style that I liked better was Samuel Adams Cream Stout. The chocolate stout that comes to mind is Southern Tier Choklat but there are probably others. 3.5  M The possibilities suggested by the excellent presentation were not realized in the taste but the feel remained welcomingly smooth. 4.0  D One and done for me but I did enjoy it.

S: Dark toasty malt aroma, chocolate, charred molasses, bittersweet mocha, coffee, an extremely complex aroma here.  T: First sip reveals a big blast of chocolate, followed immediately by roasted coffee and finishes with more dark cocoa. Subsequent sips produce less chocolate up front, but it does make its appearance mid-stream, along with some milky hints.  M: Somewhat watery consistency, but low-medium carbonation adds some creaminess. Finish is dry with a slight bitterness to clean things up.  O: Outstanding!

Has a big fluffy three fingers of tan head that slowly resides to a nice thick ring leaving lots of spider lacing throughout the glass till finish.  Smell- Lots of roasted malts hit you right away paired with chocolate of course, and a hint of bitter coffee thrown in there as well  Taste- Just like the smells the taste comes through right away with a big thick wallop of roasted malts, then the bitter coffee comes into play balanced by the sweet chocolate and finishes off with more roast.  Mouthfeel- This stout has a medium mouth feel that is very smooth and creamy, very good carbonation that leaves a nice little top of bubbly foam right till the finish.  Overall- A very good stout, looks sexy, smells sexy, and the taste is there to match. Very good carbonation for a stout as well, I was pleasantly surprised by that not to mention the whole experience itself.

Head retention is exceptional, with considerable sticky lacing all around. The nose is attractive, but this is really the only place this beer falls off a bit. Nevertheless, I get an attractive nose of light vanilla, milk chocolate and coffee. However, on the palate this beer once again flirt with perfection. The beer has something of a burnt toast flavor, which is quickly overwhelmed by cherry vanilla and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is as good as it gets. This beer is light, soft and creamy, with a nearly endless, smooth finish. Drinkability is just stunning.

Overall: A nice beer to drink on any occasion, and because of the low ABV one does not have to worry about getting overpowered by this beer. The price is also a plus!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MaltsOfGlory,3.7,"Pours a small one finger light light brown head. The head is super creamy and isn't going anywhere, as would be expected with a nitro beer. The body is pitch black, no hues of red or anything, completely dark, completely non-see through. Overall it looks pretty damn good, but it is a nitro beer, so it should look good. The smell is very nice, sweet chocolate on the nose, I also get a noticeable deep malt smell and perhaps a sour smell, like there would be in a Guinness, so I don't know if that has to do with the nitro or not. Overall the smell is chocolaty, it's a pretty good smell all around! I've had this in the bottle and I think I like it more, the nitro version has that Guinness sour taste to it, kinda an unpleasant taste, I mean it works in Guinness because it's not a Guinness without it, but I don't know if it works in this beer. It's very smooth and creamy, but the sour just interrupts what would be a huge chocolate flavor. I wouldn't mind having a big chocolate punch and then a mild sour taste, but as it is now it's 50% sour, then 50% chocolate. Overall I get a nice malt taste, and a nice chocolate taste, but unfortunately a decent sour taste. Overall, the taste is ok, not a good as I was expecting though. Mouthfeel is hard to describe, because anyone who has had a nitro beer knows that it is a unique mouthfeel. It's a very thin beer, but at the same time it's really creamy and smooth, with almost no carbonation. So it's not a bad mouthfeel, in fact it's good, just not as big as you would expect with a stout. The drinkability is actually pretty high, the beer goes down pretty easily Overall on this beer, good beer, and it's actually gotten more chocolaty as the beer has progressed, but still not what I was hoping for. Good beer, but not great.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,alankwak,3.65,A: Pitch black with super head retention and lacing.  S: Dark malt aroma and not much on the hop side.  T: Definite chocolate flavor along with roasted barley/black patent favors. A touch of coffee as well. Some rye notes as well??  M: Full mouthfeel. No holding back here.  O: Very nice stout with a strong chocolate/coffee and even licorice flavor hidden there somewhere. Roasted malt supply a fair portion of the bitterness.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mjrod2142,4.38,"14.9 oz can poured into a standard pint glass  The pour produced a perfect creamy head you'd expect from a tap at a bar. The aroma was just like that of a Guinness. I really had to try to pick up a faint chocolate smell.  Upon the first sip, however, I got an immediate chocolate flavor. The creaminess was excellent and the mouthfeel is very smooth for a canned beer. Whatever inserts they use in these cans really work.  Nice roasted malt, rich chocolate and classic stout flavors all combine to make an excellent beer. Highly recommended.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,KYBrewgrass,3.95,"A- 4 Basically black in color with light showing brown at only the edges. There's a big fluffy tan 2 finger head on the pour that dissipates to a 1/4"" throughout. The bubbles aren't all that uniform but there's smooth sheet-like lacing that looks nice.  S- 4 There's a dominant aroma of bittersweet chocolate. This is surely a combination of the chocolate, malts and hops used in this brew. Reminds me just a little of powdered hot chocolate mix. There's a tad bit of coffee in this scent as well.  T- 4 Like the aroma suggested, I taste chocolate and malt. A little bitterness is provided to keep it from being too sweet. Nice taste overall but not as complex as I'd hoped for. Reminiscent of chocolate milk at times.  M- 3.5 Medium in body (possibly just below) with ample carbonation, this is surprisingly light for the style. It is damn near watery, which I didn't remember about this one. I'd like a bit more creaminess. It is still smooth, however.  D- 4 This beer looks good, smells good, and tastes good... Yet there's something missing that has me lacking excitement over it. Regardless, it is solid overall. I'd be able to drink a few of these for sure because it has as light feel to go along with its good flavor.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S - The smell is very chocolatey, with hints of vanilla and coffee. Not super-intense and a bit weaker than in the bottled version, yet still nice!  T - Loaded with milk chocolate notes up front, with hints of vanilla, then going into a roasted flavour, followed by a slightly bitter finish. This is sweeter than the bottled version and tastes more like milk chocolate. Slight hints of coffee can also be picked up.  M - Light-to-Medium body. Creamy, smooth; feels amazing on the palate. Not very dry, no hint of alcohol.  O - I was immensely pleased with the nitro-can version. It's everything it claims to be and more!

664,73,sendsilk,2.53,"I used to like this beer. It has been several years and I bought one today just to revisit it.  I didn't smell much chocolate at all, hell, I smelled no chocolate. Maybe it's in the flavor! Nope, not there either. I think they forgot the chocolate in this brew. It is called DOUBLE chocolate so I really expected more from this thin, watery concoction.  There are plenty of other decent chocolate beers out there, pass this one by and pick another one up.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BigTomZ,1.91,"Poured a nice black with a thin tan head. Not much light gets through.  Smells like a chocolate stout with a bit of coffee. Has a sort of chocolate syrup aroma to it.  Tastes like there is chocolate in this beer, but I can't get past this artificial taste it has. There is this weird chemical metallic taste. I could only get through a few sips of this beer.  Mouthfeel was pretty thin for the style.  Overall I did not like this one bit. Lots of people seem to like it, but not me. I didn't like it the first time. Then a few months later I picked up another bottle and got the same result. This beer has too much of an artificial taste to it. I love me some chocolate stouts, but this was a drain pour.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jampics2,4.03,"16.9oz bottle into a pint glass. A generous gift from my parents, thanks so much! I remember loving this back in the day but honestly haven't had one in years.  This beer's strong suit is visible - the appearance! It's got a nice opaque black body, off white 2 finger head and great lace. Looks like a chocolate milkshake with whipped cream on top.  The nose is rather weird. That's due to a touch of yeastiness or chalkiness and a touch of metal that throw me off but dissipate as it warms. Caramel sweetness and cocoa powder are the rules of the day.  I really like the taste, as it's simple and smooth. A few layers of chocolate and caramel, coupled with dark fruit and milk chocolate. Once again, the metallic bitter finish stops the beer from scoring higher.  The mouthfeel is medium-bodied plus but could be more viscious. Still, this is a great, creamy feel and a wonderful brew overall.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerFMAndy,3.81,"500 ml bottle poured into a Sprecher nonic, 5.2% ABV, 23/04/11 (I'm assuming is best before).  A - The thick-feeling beer pours out into the pint clear but almost jet black. Short-lived cascading leads through great retention from the three-finger tan head to ring after ring of sticky lace.  S - Dusty, dry cocoa with molasses notes surrounding the bittersweet chocolate and heavily roasted malt aroma. Burnt bread in the background. A little lactose sweetness pulls through for balance.  T - The lactose sweetness and chocolate get lost through the overly roasted black malts. Burnt bread and bitter chocolate with cocoa. Chocolate presence in minimal.  M - The smooth entry leads to a medium body and clean swallow with an acrid, lingering bitterness through the finish.  O - This beer is much, much better from the nitro can than it is from the bottle in both taste and mouthfeel. The chocolate seems lost and the lack of the creamy mouthfeel doesn't help the cause.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mjn5036,3.91,"16oz nitro can is opened with a loud, elongated hiss. It is poured immediately into a large tulip glass. The beer leaving the can is a dark, Coca-Cola brown; almost black. As it hits the glass it turns into the classic nitro pour that I have grown to enjoy immensely. As the head slowly shrinks in size, a deep, dark, opaque liquid takes its place in the glass. The head is quite nice looking as well; it appears to be three-toned in color and look thick and impenetrable. Great head retention and a moderate amount of lacing as I empty the glass.  The nose is hard to pick up on in this beer. It is faint, consisting mostly of dark roasted malts and a light dusting of coco powder. I honestly think that the head on the beer is keeping the nose from truly opening up because as it settles I can smell a bit more.  The taste is quite similar to the nose. It is mild chocolate well balanced with a bitter roasted malt backdrop. It is light in all facets - lightly sweet, lightly roasted, lightly bitter notes. I was hoping for a bit more sweetness out of this considering its style.  It is light bodied in that it is extremely easy to drink and almost water-like, but it is very fluffy and seems very creamy in the way is fills your mouth with a small sip. Carbonation is well enough. It is incredibly smooth on the palate.  Overall this is a tasty stout but seems a bit more subdued in most categories than I was hoping for. Still a really solid beer though, now just wishing I had some dessert to compliment it. The price of the four back is a bit more than I would want to pay again but I hear this is phenomenal on tap so I will keep an eye out for it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Fun to pour, and watch settle.  S - Like the can says, chocolate. Cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, amaretto, whiff of alcohol.  T - Certainly a lot of chocolate flavor, but nowhere near as much as the nose would lead you to believe! I was surprised by the slight bready sourness up front. Bitter bakers chocolate, doesn't linger long. Roasted coffee beans and alcohol fade quickly.  M & D - Smooth & creamy. Very little carbonation. Would make for pricey Irish Car Bombs.

Smells are of dark bread and dark, roasted malts. The aromas of sweet chocolate and caramels are strong, with a faint earthy hop presence as well.  The taste is a rich, slightly sweet, chocolate experience. You get the roasted malt flavors associated with a stout balanced well with the sweetness of dark chocolate. It also tastes of full, dark grains as in a loaf of bread.  Smooth drinking, full-bodied beer, with light to moderate carbonation. The aftertaste is bittersweet.

T: Wow, chocolate jumps right out. Accompanied by notes of coffee, almonds and dark malt. Incredibly smooth and balanced throughout the entire experience.

Strong roasted barley flavors, right on the edge of bitter but not overboard. Flavors are ""light"" and very drinkable.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with low carbonation, very nice.  O: Good.

The aroma is dry cocoa and powdered chocolate milk mix, with roast and coffee notes.  The chocolate in the aroma fails to deliver in the taste which is mostly a minerally, metallic roast. There some mild milky sweetness underneath with a tartness in the finish. Chalky. Lighter in taste than I would like. Some toffee comes out as it warms.  Body is a little light for a stout. I'd prefer something a little heavier, nice and thick and rich. Like chocolate.

The beer itself poured out like thick dark coffee, the liquid is very dark brown to almost black. Looking through the beer is like looking into the night sky, zero light passes through, a testament to the thickness of this beer. I found average head retention, though it never fully dissipates (could be due to the glass...did the wife clean it last I wonder????)  Smell: A rich coffee smell hit me upon breathing in, also with a hint of chocolate and possibly dried fruits and nuts to top it off. The coffee smell was more and more apparent upon each sip, though this is not a bad thing, in fact it heightened the experience. Very strong smelling beer.  Taste: Tastes just as it looks and smells; thick and rich! A sort of creamy coffee/cappuccino/coco tasting beer, though not overpowering. The initial fades out to a subtle enjoyable coffee aftertaste. A great taste experience.  Mouthfeel: Nice and thick in the mouth, with a creamy texture, though not the creamiest I have experienced.

Appearance - Poured this stuff into a plain pint glass, and it poured out a good three fingers or so of creamy mocha head. This stuff was pitch black, I couldn't see any light shine through it at all.  Smell - mostly really toasted grains and coffee, as well as some smell that made me think of hot chocolate.  Taste- Lots of coffee and toastiness, as well as some citrus notes hanging around in there. Not much chocolate for my experience, I don't think there was much of it if at all, I was slightly disappointed, hence why it gets a 4 here.  Mouthfeel- The head was very light and actually chewy.

Drinkability- I thought this beer was really nice, though the lack of chocolate notes was a bit of a disappointment, I think that the overall smoothness of the beer as well as the interesting mix between the coffee and mild citrus flavors were really interesting and made up for it.

Entire beer went from a cream dark brown to black, once the nitrogen dies back, from the bottom to the top, very slowly. The head stays on the glass after every drink.  S - Freshly cracked, the aroma was a nice, chocolate (smelt like chocolate milk to me) and malts are very pronounced. Enjoyable.  T - Super nice creamy nitro head. Awesome. Nice chocolate tones without the sweetness. I taste cocoa, dark & milk chocolate, some malt, cherry, and a small amount of hops. Pretty nice, but seems like it is missing something else, maybe more malt. I think the chocolate should be even more pronounced in the finish if possible..the finish is pretty thin. Aftertaste is decent, of roasty (dark) chocolate. Sweetness is more pronounced at the bottom of the glass as it settles. Cherry is easier to pick up from this point on.  M - Head is creamy. Stout is not. The weakest point of the beer. It's thin. Water thin.  D - I would buy it again, but it is not a stout I would go look for. I do like the chocolate but it just seems to be missing more flavor to me. I bought a 4-pack, and after two, I was good. The fourth was in my fridge for a two weeks and I am drinking it right now.

I recommend Sonny Rollins trio recordings in Europe 1959 or watch a Tottenham free flowing soccer match!,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,SuperSpy,3.81,"Poured into a pint glass from a large brown bottle with a best by date of 22 July 2011.  Very dark. It looks a bit creamy. A three-finger thick, tan head. It has big bursts of bubbles that make the top look like an English muffin cut in half.  The aroma has dark roasted malts, a hint of dark chocolate. The aroma is very weak though.  Incredibly creamy and chocolaty. There are flavors of roasted malt, cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, chocolate malt and a bit of alcohol. It's balanced out by a nice hop flavor toward the end that lends to a bitter chocolate finish.  This is a mighty fine stout. There is plenty of chocolate flavor and it's multidimensional. I don't know that I could really enjoy the sweet, roasted, chocolate flavor all night, but it's great for a pint now and then.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,waffle611,4.31,"My first review!  I bought a 4-pack of nitro-cans of this beer, mainly because of all of the positive reviews (and since i like stouts usually).  A- This beer pours an excellent cascade. It is pretty opaque, and leaves about a 1 finger creamy white head with great lacing. Beautiful  S- I admit that I'm new to smelling beers, and I haven't quite developed that sense properly, but I can definitely smell chocolate! Perhaps some malts?  T- Chocolate chocolate chocolate. The flavor is great, especially as a dessert beer. Can taste some malts, but really huge ammounts of milk chocolate and some bitterness. Cannot taste any alcohol.  M - It's very creamy and smooth. Very enjoyable.  D - What I would consider the weak-point of this beer. I could probably drink 2-3 in a night, but it isn't exactly a sessionable beer, or a ""lets get drunk"" beer at all. I could see getting sick of the chocolate.  Overall I like this beer quite a bit.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S: Strongly metallic with some chocolate milk notes. I suspect the copper isn't typical, but it's undeniably present.  T: Sadly, the metalleity extends to the taste; happily, it is a minor component. Very creamy, with serious chocolate-milk notes. The aftertaste is sweetish.  M: Cream coats the mouth. Substantial.  D: The metallic component completely ruins the beer for me.

Smells wonderful; of relatively sweet dark chocolate and dark roasted grain complemented perfectly with a hop feel in the nose. Feels incredibly smooth...just wonderful. The head is soft and the body is silky, a sexy beer really. Tastes of a delicious dark stout, dark and coffee/toffee-like with a strong hop presence which is balanced with the delicate flavor of dark chocolate to provide just enough sweetness to make this beer a great late-night/ after dinner beer. Wonderful and absolutely enjoyable!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Two fingers of head is common, leaving behind a ton of lace before it settles as a stalky film.  Smells like chocolate, toasted malt and cream. It's simple, but rich and extremely enticing.  The taste explodes in my mouth every time I have this beer. It sure tastes like cocoa or bakers chocolate, but it also has a strong cherry or raspberry-like fruit backing and an almost sour dryness on the finish to balance things out.  The mouthfeel is creamy and hearty. This beer slides down my throat, makes me feel it then makes me want more.

664,73,KajII,3.82,[Best served in an English pint]  Poured a muddy black with a large light brown rocky head with average retention and good lacing. The aroma was of burnt chocolate malts and a light doughy yeast with strong notes of dark chocolate and coffee. It tasted lightly sweet and quite malty in the beginning and finished about the same but with a strong bitter/sweet chocolate flavor that stayed on the palate for a very long while. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy yet watery in texture with a mild carbonation. Overall a brew with lots of chocolate flavor but not much else.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S: Cocoa and roasted malts. A very chocolate aroma. Smells of desert!! YUM!  T: Roasted chocolate malts. Reminds me of hot chocloate that has been cooled but with an alcohol flavor.

Black with brown 2 finger head tiny bubbles  Smell - Very pleasant as one would expect..malty, chocolatey, caramel and a very slight smokeness  Taste - Very balanced as usual from a UK brewer. Chocolately, smooth and slight crispness at the end. Nothing in the flavorings that puts this in the top of the world though but just a smidge underneath.  Mouthfeel - Slightly watery for a stout but decent none the less.  Drinkability - Very drinkable stout and light ABV makes this a good session stout if that were ever possible.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,ChugginOil,4.27,"Appearance is dark with a slight red on tilted edges. One fingers worth, of foam. Sticky lacing  Scent is that of sweet cocoa and bready malts.

Very delishous  I could drink this all day! Yum",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mancer,4.17,"The bottle poured out a dark brown to jet black color with a 1 1/2 finger high light brown head. The head dissipated to a thin and sticky lace, just covering the top of the beer. The initial aromas were of light tobacco, sweet malts, and some chocolate. The initial flavors were of pipe tobacco, sweet malts in the middle ground, aided by some dark chocolate. It finished with a light roast that sat pleasantly on the palate. Overall it had a light to medium body with light to medium carbonation.  This was a pretty good beer. With a name like Double Chocolate, you would expect this to be a chocolate explosion, but it is not. There is a hefty amount of sweet pipe tobacco going on and it is the primary flavor of the beer. I don't think this is a beer that I'll frequent, maybe something on the odd occasion.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeardedRiker,3.62,"I tend to prefer stouts with a good chocolate taste. Wait, check that. I prefer stouts with a good cocoa taste to them that adds to its body with roastiness/bitterness.  When I left work I picked this one up to add variety to my beer selection. I got a big 3 finger head that was frothy and creme colored. The head died down fairly quickly revealing the dark chocolate color of the beer. At the very edges I could see a bit of color change to sort of ruby brown. It smelled strongly of cocoa, coffee, roasted malts and toffee.  Taste was very similar with chocolate being very noticeable. It was sweet but very cocoa-ish. Roasted coffee added a nice finish that was also a little bitter (coffee bitter). Roasted malts brought some sweetness to the finish as well. I would have liked to have had a better middle to the body but in all this was a decent stout and the name says it all with the pronounced chocolate flavors.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Duckmancgy,4.62,"Upon opening the first thing you notice is the smell of chocolate and malted barley. Not overpowering chocolate but a nice tinge to the sweetness of the barley. Pour is nice, appears very black in the glass with about a half inch or so of lighter tan head. Smell at this point is a bit stronger on the chocolate but still nothing overpowering.  First taste is not what I expected, its very smooth through the mouth and during swallowing, hints of chocolate - honestly expected more, but not that its bad. In fact its a very balanced flavour profile. Nothing sticking out that is more dominant than anything else. The chocolate is a nice touch but the ""stout-y"" espresso flavours still come through.  When the glass was finished all I wanted was another one. Not as much chocolate as Dieu de Ciel's Aphrodisiaque, but what can you do.

664,73,Brunite,4.38,Presentation: Poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Black as night with a 2-3 finger tan head. Looks almost like a nitro-pour. A nice tan head.  Smell: Roasted barley and dark chocolate aromas.  Taste: Mild sweetness like a dark chocolate bar. This is not a sweet milk chocolate. Also strong on the roasted barley flavors. Also some faint licorice flavors to round things out. I originally looked for more of a sweet chocolate flavor with this one but repeated glasses over time have made me look for a more subtle cocoa flavor. The chocolate IS more pronounced in the bottle vs the can.  Mouthfeel: Chewy...smooth.  Drinkablity: Very high. This is delicious and satisfying. Not overly sweet but certainly satisfies a craving for dessert.  Overall: I love this stuff. It gives a little more than a standard Irish Stout. Not a ton....but enough. Found the bottle 4-pack for $7.99....so I stocked up. One of my favorites!,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Appearance: chocolaty, kinda like a lighter version of crude oil. Not unpleasant at all.  Smell: chocolate, earth, malts, a hint of caramel and coffee.  Taste: Wow. This beer floored me with its taste. It reminds me of a really good chocolate coffee with a hint of caramel. Maybe creme brulee. Kinda reminds me of a much less boozy Bailey's Irish Creme.

Flavor is mildly roasted with almond notes. Small amount of herbal hops, enough to dry it out. Definite chocolate undertone. Not the most complex but not bad.  Much lighter body than expected, almost watery. Low carbonation and fairly drying.  Not what I expected. Could use a little more flavor and depth.

Poured mostly black, just a bit of translucence around the edges, with about a half-inch of dark khaki head that had moderate retention and lace.  There is certainly a strong chocolate scent upfront and some nice roasted notes in the background. the chocolate coats the tongue and lingers at the back of the tongue. Underneath that the roasted grains give a solid base for the sweetness.  The body is solidly full without being heavy. Drinkability is very good, but that may depend on your tolerance for sweetness. Overall, a very good brew that's worth your time. Grab one soon.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,OneDropSoup,3.93,"Got this one in a Valentine's sixer from my wife!  Poured into a shaker pint: Hard black with just some deep crimson highlights around the very edges. Half-finger of creamy, khaki head, you know the look. Say what you will about nitro, it sure pours an attractive stout! Leaves gauzy sheets of lacing.  Nice hazelnut coffee smell, chocolate's just there but pretty restrained.  Mildly roasty taste, some nutty coffee again with plenty of cream, some tannic fruit skins, & a little herbal note, kind of like anise. Finishes sweet & with a little cooked plum & light cocoa. Flavors are good but very mellow, nice & smooth without anything standing out too much. Aftertaste is cafe au lait.  Medium-bodied, but honestly, kind of flat. Sticks around nicely afterward, leaving a nice reminder without getting too sweet or sticky.  I feel like this is a little wimpier than I remember, experiencing a lot fo things being a little more ""washed out,"" though that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nice to have a flavorful stuff that's in moderation, not overdoing it. I could have another, for sure.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It pours a clear dark sienna topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, and a light air of coffee. The taste simplifies things even further (somehow), highlighting the roast and the (now dark) chocolate. It's tasty, but -- and I hate putting it like this, but I can't think of a better way -- still kinda boring too. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish.

664,73,alleykatking,3.98,"Poured from 16oz can.  A- Pours a deep dark brown color. Two finger light tan head shows great retention. Huge web style lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Big time chocolate and light roasted malts in the beer. This smells very rich in the chocolate. Light nutty tone to the middle of the beer itself. There seems to be a light citrus hop in the ending of the aroma too which doesn't seem to fit but isn't an annoyance.  T- Roasted malts come in first with the chocolate malts right behind. Before the middle of the beer though there is a big rich chocolate flavor with hitns of nutty flavors. The middle of the beer kind of washes away a small bit of the flavor but the chocolate comes right back with a nice crisp hop bite in the ending. This adds a little bit of bitterness to the overall sweetness of the beer.  M- Medium/Light mouthfeel. Carbonation was good for the beer altogether. Chocolate flavors were mostly what was left on the palate. Aftertaste was a lot of light alcohol, watery nothingness (if that makes sense), chocolate and light roasted malts. Flavors were balanced actually quite nicely. No real off flavors to speak of but it had a off feel with watery tones at times. Light alcohol drying on the palate.  D- This was a good drinking lighter stout. As far as chocolate flavor it does deliver but I was looking for a little more to it. A little one sided at times in the mouth. The ABV makes it a muti-beer drinker. The overall feel to it doesn't make you feel full so having a couple would be no problem.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Shrews629,4.1,"Appearance - A nice, dark brown/black color with some ruby highlights around the edges. A light tan head with very nice size. Good retention and some nice lacing. The head was mostly creamy and smooth. It settled to a nice ring on top.  Smell - A nicely balanced aroma of a milk chocolate, roasted malt and dried oats. Some of the oats might be giving off a roasted grain type of aroma.  Taste - The taste revealed the chocolate of course, but it also provided the roasted malty oats that also had the flavor of some type of Belgian grain. Slight touches of a plum flavoring. All very well balanced and good. Only minor touches of bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium to medium/full mouthfeel. Very, very smooth and easy drinking. A touch of chalkiness. Covered the palate ok, but I was expecting better. It was nicely dry and creamy.  Drinkability - I must say that this beer is very good and very enjoyable and very easy to drink. However, considering all the hype that surrounds this beer and all that I've read about it, I was expecting much more. Some reviews put this on par with the Rogue Chocolate Stout, but for my money, this doesn't even compare to the overall satisfaction of the Rogue.

A: Pours completely opaque with a dark, reddish brown ring at the edge of the glass and a good finger or more dark tan/light brown head that slowly fizzles into a still generously foamy layer that laces nicely upon sipping.  S: Deep, dark, round scent. Dense dark fruit and deep roasted dark chocolate that are finished off quite nicely by heavy, sweet pipe tobacco.  T: Deep, dark fruit back up front again - almost sour, but wonderful - then thick, rich, near burnt dark chocolate with a mildly bitter hop taste upon swallowing.  M: Coats the mouth slightly, but is not overly creamy, until swished around the mouth slightly, at which point the agitation releases a fresh burst of foam, flavor, and a very mildly alcoholic tongue bite.  D: A wonderful specimen of a stout with a flavor that demands to be tasted again and again.

A little bit of licorice, thought not as much as the nose suggested. Has a good deal of sweetness, both milk chocolate and molasses. Very slight earthy hop presence that is well hidden.  M: Medium carbonation, very light body, definitely too watery for my taste. Not creamy, not smooth or velvety, pretty disappointing body for a stout.

Some licorice in the background on the finish. Super balanced. Can this get any better?  M - Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with relatively light body. Not necessarily watery, but a bit lighter than I typically like my stouts. Probably the only drawback (if there is one) about this brew.  D - Wow, does this ever go down easy. Super easy, in fact. Yup. Uber-drinkable. Thank you sir, may I have another?  Mmmm, stout, with your stouty stoutness. Nice chocolate flavor without being overwhelming.

Looked delicious and I couldn't wait to try some. Aroma was somewhat disappointing. Slight chocolate milk odor, but very faint overall. Taste proved much better than the smell. Started off nice and sweet with nice chocolate and maltiness. Finished dry with a more roasted flavor and hints of coffee. The finish was nice and kept the sweetness up front from becoming too much. Mouthfeel was excellent, smooth and creamy. For as rich as this beer could be, the drinkability was good as it did not feel super heavy, and the flavor was balanced enough to keep the sweetness from catching up.

The depth of chocolate flavor is beyond many other chocolate beers, in that it's not one note.

664,73,weizenbob,4.32,"500 mL bottle, best before 24/11/10. From the label: ""Chocolate malt and real dark chocolate are combined with Young's award winning rich, full flavored dark ale..."" I love that they're taking the stout's chocolate attributes to a literal conclusion. This Luxury Double Chocolate Stout was poured into an oversized wine glass. An aggressive pour yields a finger-tall mocha head that dissipates fairly quickly. Spotty lacing touches the glass. In describing the color of this stout, one must ask himself, ""How much more black could this be?"" The answer is none more black.  Unsurprisingly, the nose is full of chocolate. Subtle roasted malt aromas are quickly overtaken by the strong scent of Hershey's syrup. Coffee liqueur comes to mind next. In fact, it smells much more alcoholic than 5.2% ABV should suggest. Simply put, this smells exactly like you would imagine stout with chocolate would smell. It's a pretty simple combo, but despite the lack of complexity in the nose, it is quite pleasant, if a bit literal.  The flavor is indeed sweet, though not nearly as sweet as the nose would suggest. It's not nearly as chocolaty as the nose would suggest either. If this had been a blind taste test I would have thought that I was drinking a great roasty porter. Roasted malts take center stage and fade into a mild coffee-like bitterness that slowly takes on the essence of dark dark chocolate. It's rich but not the least bit overpowering. The alcohol remains hidden beneath the roastiness. It finishes with an aftertaste of more roasted/chocolate malts. It's simple but effective.  The mouthfeel is fairly standard for a non-imperial stout. The body is fairly light. Carbonation is not very heavy but does add a nice prickly effect in the mouth. Drinkability is also high as Young's Double Chocolate Stout drinks like a porter. It's a smooth, full flavored stout that debunks the myth that big flavor comes only with high alcohol. American brewers take note.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I give a Schlitz for Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout. It is quite tasty but it is also pricey. If I could buy it without the import price I could see myself drinking this regularly.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JMad,4.28,"I poured a bottle of this into my glass mug...  The beer was opaque, black with a thick, lofty coffee colored head that had medium sized bubbles.

This was so smooth, it's rich, robust and full bodied, leaves a dry feeling in the mouth.  I really enjoyed this stout, it is one of the best I have ever had.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CuriousMonk,4,"Poured from bottle (no date) into an english pint glass. Pours a dark black opaque color with a huge tan head. Very sticky lacing that coats and hardens in the inside of the glass. Very chocolatey of course- aroma is slightly nutty- with a taste of milk, chocolate and almonds. Very mild carbonation, otherwise a nice drinkable beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Haybeerman,4.27,A: Dark brown; almost opaque. Poured a 2 finger cascading brown head that dissipated slowly to a thick skim. Broken lacing.  S: Chocolate and toasted malts. Hop citrus in the background.  T: Toasted malts and chocolate up front; not quite as robust as in the smell. An even bitter balances the beer nicely.  M: Medium to full body. Low to medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.  D: Very flavorful and really easy to drink. Balance sets me up for drink after drink.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bworley,3.86,"I poured this into a tulip and was surprised by the head. A full 3 fingers that gradually reduced to about a cm about 1/2 way through with several rings on the glass. I think the smell is a little tinny. Not alot going on there. On the other hand, the taste is great. You can definately pick up on the mocha aftertaste. This stout also feels nice like creamy cocoa with bubbles. with the 5.2 abv, i could see drinking this one for an evening, or at least have one with anything called death by chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,snaotheus,4.35,"16.9oz bottle poured into a 22oz stein because my wife couldn't reach a pint glass. Also, I didn't get the full 16.9oz because my wife took four tablespoons for some crazy chocolate truffles she's making for the super bowl.  Pours generally very stoutly, but with a surprisingly large and fluffy beige head. Head fades at a medium pace, leaves clumps of lacing stuck to the side of the glass. Beer is almost opaque, but noticeably translucent around the edges.  Smell is powerful, easily detectable at arm's length. When I concentrate on it, I get a lot of coffee in the aroma. Chocolate is there, but to me it's hidden behind some roasty malts.  Chocolate really comes out in the taste, but there's still some coffee hint, sweet and thick and chewy. Very pleasant beer.  Mouthfeel as mentioned above -- thick and chewy, but amazingly light and fluffy at the same time. Very good, very enjoyable beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mindlucent2007,4.16,"The pub can pours a very dark brown with a gorgeous quarter-inch thick and rich, light tan head that settles in to an eigth inch which stays in tact throughout.  Nutty and sweet, chocolately aromas. I notice a little spicy accent to it as well.  The nutty characteristic reigns in this brew, but definitely chocolate takes hold at the same time. Nothing overpowering in this great stout.  Low carbonation and an smooth velvety feel.  I can't see an occasion when you couldn't break one of these stouts out. A great brew by itself, but it can also compliment many dinners and desserts (or be a dessert by itself). I didn't think anything held a candle to Youngs Oatmeal Stout, but this brother is definitely on the same page. It's extremely drinkable and is one which I thoroughly enjoyed.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,snogglethorpe,3.88,"Pretty much as advertised -- bitter chocolate, not too sweet, opaque, black, delicious.  It's not an ""oil can"" stout, in that the mouthfeel is a little lighter than some, but it's absolutely satisfying, and super drinkable.  It contains actual chocolate, and sugar, so the taste isn't a surprise, but it isn't excessively sweet.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Not for the taste directly or the mouthfeel but rather the appearance, smell, and extreme drinkability make this a must-have.  I love stouts. This particular stout is a little light and more thin than I prefer. It has little complexity and is highly chocolaty (double chocolate well of course). But what I love about this beer is in it's drinkability. And you won't find a better looking glass full of beer - pitch black, creamy head (nitro-can but the bottles and on tap have a beautiful top as well), nice lacing... what else can you want? Reminds me of that line in Spinal Tap: ""How much more black can this album be? The answer is 'None. None more black.'""  A very delicious, fun stout, that will be enjoyed by novice stout lovers and as a novelty by serious stout lovers. Stout lovers will probably crave something with more depth, power, and complexity but you can always enjoy this as a sort of ""stout light"". Pretty yummy really.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,nickthetick,3.99,"A: poured into an american shaker (at the bar) opaque black with a dirty khaki head that hangs around for the entire beer. The head leaves a beautiful lacing, one of the best I've ever seen.  S: not a lot on the nose except for smooth sweet dark malts and milk chocolate.  T: heavy up front with the espresso and a light chocolate malt follow up. There is a little bitterness that tries to take the form of dark cocoa but the sweet malt really won't let it.  MF: thick creamy and chewy. Slightly effervescent.  D: good example of a milk stout that I stumbled across at my local brewpub/beer bar but I have not heard of it before.

Poured into Duvel tulip , poured dark black with one finger head that dissipated quickly leaving a thin creamy tan lacing,decent carbonation.  Smell - Light chocolate hints with roasted malts.  Taste - Bitter chocolates with some toasty malts,coffee and maybe a slight hint of vanilla cream.  Drinkability - creamy chocolates with enough balance of toasted malts make this a very drinakable beer - as it warmed the chocolate flavors really showed through- nice aftertaste in the finish.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Decent lacing down the glass.  S: Chocolate is the dominate smell, which is not surprising at all. Nice malty smell as well.  T: One of the most amazing beers I have had to date. Smooth and creamy with an amazing finish. Some roasted coffee towards the back.  This is an amazing brew. Chocolate smell and taste. The appearance was nothing spectacular but everything else measured up. ( I have decided now that a beer REALLY look bad to receive low marks in the appearance category.)

664,73,Bonis,3.34,"A - Black... Not the darkest I've seen, but it looks like a decent stout nonetheless. Nice pillowy off white head.  S - Smells kinda like a Guinness Foreign Extra with generic chocolate added. Mostly malt forward with a touch of chalky bitter hops that I don't care for at all. This is being consumed well before the best by date, but something about the aroma just doesn't seem right to me, or I just don't like it.  T - When I think of a ""double chocolate stout"" this is not what I expect. Ok, so I guess I'm really not a fan of european stouts, and I've already tried some American imperial stouts like Choklat and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout (which doesn't even add real chocolate to their beer, yet they achieve a better chocolate flavor compared to this beer), but this beer just doesn't do a whole lot for me. It's nice. It's better than many I've had. It has a decent roasty character. It is full of flavor like a stout should be, but I come away fairly unimpressed. It's been over a year since I've had this beer, and it just isn't as good as I recall.  M - Pretty full bodied, perfect carbonation. Could be the nicest aspect of this beer.  D - A pretty easy drink, but I expect that at it's abv. Again, this wasn't quite as good as I expected it to be, but it's a relatively good beer and one I'll enjoy again. I think I prefer it from the nitro can.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ADWnyc,4.23,"Enjoyed on tap at Stout in New York City. One of my favorite winter beers.  Pours a delicious creamy brown, foretelling the chocolate that waits you. Nice tannish head.  Smells of rich chocolate and coffee/espresso.  Ultra creamy taste and excellent chocolate finish. Smooth and full of finesse.  Could easily substitute as a dessert at the end of a meal, probably not a beer you would drink back-to-back, as it is very filling.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Fenris244,3.68,"Been wanting to try this brew, yay for pint nite!  Black in color with a ridiculously thick and sticky foam head, amazing retention(I'm half done with the glass and the head persists...)  Chocolate, cream, coffee and bitter aromas abound.  Chocolate flavor is definitely there as well as coffee and metallic/mineral undertone. Bitter malts on the finish.  Unbelievably creamy, never had a beer this creamy, I have to say it inhibits the drinkability of the beer. Neat beer something I could get every now and again but not to often.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,spinrsx,3.95,"500ml Bottle  Appearance - The beer pours a black/brown colour with a very large frothy light brown coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for several minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - chocolate, hops, malts, coffee, roasted/toasted notes  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and feels fairly thin. Perhaps I am just used to the more powerful chocolate beers. I can taste lots of chocolate malts, coffee and some light hops. I can also pick up on a roasted/toasted flavour. The beer finishes with a coffee/chocolate aftertaste.  Drink - This is a highly drinkable chocolate beer that is very tasty. If you're a fan of the style it's worth checking out for sure.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Chincino,4.02,"I had this beer today as an after dinner beer at the Yard House in Dedham, MA. I chose this beer in lieu of dessert due to the fact that I thought it would be chocolatey and filling like a dessert.  I had had this beer before, but not in awhile. It was poured into a pint glass and its color was so dark brown that it appeared almost black.  The aroma was rich and strong of coffee/espresso and chocolate. There was a 3/4 inch foamy coca-cola color foam at the top.  This beer was smooth and creamy. I definitely could only drink one of these beers in a sitting.

664,73,glid02,4.25,"Nitro-tap at Mac McGee's in Atlanta.  Pours one shade from black with a one-finger cap of fine tan foam. The head slowly recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of lightly roasted malts and strong dark chocolate and cocoa powder. It's up there with Rogue's Chocolate Stout as far as chocolate in the nose.  Tastes very similar to how it smells, although the chocolate isn't quite as robust. Smooth roasted malt and large chocolate malt flavors kick things off and the flavor profile skews quickly toward chocolate with the addition of robust milk chocolate and cocoa powder. The chocolate flavors smooth out midway through the sip, carrying through to a mildly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a heavy thickness with soft carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.

664,73,Naugros,4.08,"I've been unlucky in finding a stout made with chocolate that tastes like it has been made with real chocolate AND taste good AND not have chili peppers in it. So someone told me to try this one and was surprised that I had tried it yet. So here goes.  It pours a deep, dark brown with a mocha-colored head with great structure, really good retention and spotty lacing. There is definitely chocolate in the smell, but it's not promising for tasting like real chocolate. It smells like the chocolate flavoring used in cheap candy. There are also roasty elements that remind you that this is more than just about the chocolate...this is a stout...and the roasted malts hint at coffee.  Bittersweet chocolate greets your tongue immediately along with the roasty/toasty malts. It's not overly sweet and that's a good thing. The chocolate does not taste like flavoring; it does taste like real chocolate was used despite the label stating that it is natural chocolate flavoring. The coffee flavor asserts itself again, but tastes a wee bit burnt.  A thin-feeling stout, but that's not uncommon for British non-imperial stouts. Unlike other stouts with chocolate flavoring, it doesn't leave with the sense that you just ate some third-rate penny candy. Instead the finish is of overly roasted coffee.  Still not the beer I'm searching for but the closest thing so far. Does anyone make a stout that delivers real chocolate flavor with a velvety mouthfeel? Am I looking for an alcoholic chocolate shake? Yes! Is that too much to ask? :)",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The beer had a rather nice appearance. Dark black with a never dissipating off-white nitro head floating on top, the Double Chocolate Stout was immediately inviting. The taste was another story. Sure I'm aware that the name of this brew is a Double Chocolate Stout, but it seems like this barely even qualifies as a beer. The overwhelming chocolate flavor is, of course, the first and predominant taste one gets when sipping on a nitro fueled chocolate stout. There's a slight bit of bitterness and malts that let you know that this really is a beer, but for the most this is just a glorified milk shake.

664,73,Smakawhat,2.65,"Poured into a pint glass given off a very nice 2 finger head of a perfect light brown. Minimal lacing with a dark brown walnut body. Ring and bubble marks stay throughout leaving a nice light brown easy circle.  Smell of faint milk chocolate, some minor cream whiffs. not much else though, but it's quite pleasant.  Taste disappoints a bit, with a very soda pop tingle like carbonation on the tongue. Aftertaste is almost exclusively watered down club soda and carbon dioxide. Where is the flavor in this beer where did it go on the palate from what I smelled before? There is an extremely faint note of whipped chocolate on the end but it's nearly impossibly to detected because of all the fizz. This is also very wet in body. Malt where art thou?  Don't want another one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Sachsenfreude,4.02,"appearance; black, no chance of seeining through it. Thick and creamy beige head with outstanding, sticky lacing, that nearly covers the side of the glass. Head retains from start to finish.  smell; bitter dark chocolate and lactic coffee aromas. Some roasted sweetness. Very well balanced but overall kind of weak.  taste; fresh sweet cream, very lactic but the sweetness is not cloying because a dark chocolate bitterness bites and fizzles to a roasted malt and burnt finish. A chocolate aftertaste lingers with some hops and alcohol.  mouthfeel; surprisingly light and predictably creamy. Very smooth and slick in the finish. Little carbonation.  drinkability; This beer goes down so smooth and refreshing.

A: This pours a completely opaque pitch black color with a billowing, two-finger, light khaki head with great retention and decent lace.  S: The nose is of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, hazelnuts, and caramel.  T: The taste is also that of dark and milk chocolates (surprising, I know), with some creamy dessert undertones.  M: The body is medium-thick and quite creamy.  D: This makes for quite a wonderful dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,FanofHefe,3.83,"On tap in a pint glass. Dark black body with a nice sticky dark tan head. Good lacing and rentention.  Light aroma of roasted malt and chocolate.  Pretty tasty blend of chocolate and malt. No doubt, the most chocolately brew I've ever had and pretty darn tasty. Good for dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Seanstoppable,3.85,"Picked this up earlier this year in Ontario at the LCBO. Best before March 4, 2011.  Pours a matte black with two fingers of thick, chocolate hued head. Plenty of lacing left on the glass.  Scent is a sweet mocha flavor.The chocolate nature of this is pretty apparent.  Not as chocolaty as I would have expected, though chocolate is there. Very sweet up front. Slight coffee taste at the back. Somewhat creamy aftertaste.  Honestly, this reminds me of a cross between Dieu du Ceil's Aphrodasiaque and the Peche Mortel. Certainly not a bad thing. Good as a desert, not so much for general drinking.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Axismundi,3.81,"Tried a pint of this one over @ Blokes and Birds in Chicago.  Appearance - The place was a little dark where I was at, but when I held the glass up to a candle, there was no light coming through. Solid dark brown maybe even black. Slightly less than half a finger of dense creamy head on top, leaving spotting lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell - Dark chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Pretty straight forward  Taste- Mostly dark chocolate up front & slight caramelized malt flavor. Not as sweet as I expected, since the beer and logo for the beer reminds me of something from Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory. A faint flavor of alcohol is present (as suggested by the smell) as well, but isn't a bad thing (it is beer after all). The whole flavor experience in the mouth is a surprisingly short, clean one. None of that lingering roasted flavor that is sometimes present in some stouts.  Mouth feel - Extremely smooth and creamy. This stout certainly shines in this department. The low level of carbonation and creaminess of the beer make it feel somewhat viscous in the mouth. Lovely.  Drink-ability - Pretty agreeable beer to drink. Pretty filling as well, could only drink one pint of this, or less. The alcohol flavor in there, too, may have reduced the drink ability for me, personally. Not exactly refreshing either.  Overall - I'd give it a B+ or A- because it's pleasant to have tried this, but stouts are not my most favorite style of beer, but it seems to be of high quality and thoughtfully made.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,IIKaRuII,4.23,"Poured into a guinness glass, an amazing dark almost not even see through color. The head was an milk chocolate color. Smelled like chocolate milk, with a little bit of roasted malts. The head tastes exactly like chocolate milk, and then the fullness of this beer comes out and is amazing. Has a nice coffee after taste This is a wonderful stout that drinks a little like you would expect milk too. probably the most impressive part of this beer is its lacing. you can see lacing throughout the entire drink of this beer.

664,73,RJLarse,4.2,"I bought a couple of Imperial Pints of Young's Double Chocolate Stout in a grocery store. Poured into an American pint glass.  Pours a black walnut color and is nearly opaque. The head is a creamy light brown color, resembling a chocolate shake.  Smell is a semi-sweet chocolate aroma, with an earthy note. Peat perhaps or some sort of grain.  Taste is decidedly chocolaty, with a hint of coffee bitterness. The chocolate flavor is more milk chocolate than dark.  Mouthfeel is very good. Full bodied and smooth but not cloying.  Very drinkable and very sessionable brew. It's particularly good in the winter season. Reminds me of a now retired beer called Snow Plow from Widmer.

The beer was dark brown smelled vaguely like chocolate and a little more malty. The beer tasted very good...like bittersweet chocolate with a nice lingering chocolate finish.

The aroma is malty with hints of chocolate initially but with time and as the beer warms up, chocolate takes over completely. So is the case with taste, initially when the beer is cold, the taste is predominantly malty, with hints of chocolate and a dry finish, but as it warms up, the chocolate takes over. Rich, creamy mouthfeel, a delicious brew. Drinkability is very good. This is one stout I can have anytime, anyplace. Highly recommended.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A: Just like every other stout, it is very dark black with hints of redwood around the edges where the light tries to come through.  S: I get a scent of roasted malt, not astringent or burnt but a mellow roasty maltiness.  T: Hits you with chocolate right up front. Its very pleasant and followed by the malty sweetness which is then evened up by the hops. Nice and well balanced.  M: This beer is a little heavy on the palate. It coats the mouth with a nice richness and the carbonation prepares you for another swig.  D: Its a stout true to form so after half my bottle, I'm getting full. If it were a lighter style, I would be downing them like no one's business, but then it wouldn't be a stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A glorified Guinness here.  M - So silky and smooth. Really something how this one goes down.  D - Good drinkability. I can imagine throwing these back around a poker table with my friends in winter. Nice. Overpriced a bit though. Might be because it's imported, but $9.00+ for a 4-pack of these is way too much for this beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

M: A body that's a bit on the lighter side but not too light. Very creamy and smooth. Coats the mouth nicely.  D: Easily one of my favorites.

664,73,TheBrewo,4.06,"We pour a brew of the darkest brown. It puts up a mocha colored head of two fingers which, while receding, leaves thick circular lacing. Very little shines through the edges when held to the light, so no sediment or degree of carbonation can be assessed visually. A swirl and a sniff reveal a sweet beer, with chocolate and roasty malts, light medicinals and alcohol, and a metallic aroma, likely lent by the additional chocolates used. The flavor begins with huge roasted malts. These combine through the middle with smooth chocolate and coffee notes. The latter flavors remain for a slightly bitter and chalky aftertaste. There are also mild hints of cinnamon and the metals from the nose trailing on the backend. The mouthfeel is slick, smooth, and somewhat coating. The generous chocolate leaves the mouth on the dry side. Carbonation is low to medium, and the body is medium, yet seemingly lighter. With the low abv and the pleasurable feel, this beer drinks respectably.  Overall, the best thing about this beer was strong delivery of chocolate throughout the taste, and the pleasing, creamy mouthfeel. The beer looks great when you first pour it, with the head shooting up, and lingering for a bit. If there is a category in which the beer lacks, it would be aroma. There is a tinge of slightly unpleasant metal, which does smooth out as it warms up, but it could have been a bit stronger and more complex.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,willPS21,1.74,"I'd rather drink a 40 of old english.  I was served this beer on accident basically, as the bartender allegedly (he didn't) tried to inform me that they were out of the Bells Expedition that I was ordering. It came about 58 degrees, and was quite disgusting. Maybe its the symptom of unknowingly picking up the empty milk carton from the fridge door, maybe its the symptom of being unknowingly served a glass of warm yoohoo guiness and a splash of coors original and samuel smith and simple syrup which has been whipped to enhance the milky bubbly texture.  In all honesty, I am being harsh, but I suffered through it. Wait no I didn't. I took about 5 ever-shrinking sips and then asked for my money back, but that wasn't happening, so the glass sat all alone in no mans land on the bar, looking just pitiful as I ordered proper beer all around it. The function of that beer until close was a general obstacle, maybe a drunk-o-meter.  In all fairness I think basically adding ice would help out the effect in my situation, and in retrospect I wish I had tried it. Maybe some tobasco as well, and a raw egg. Now, I suspect I don't like milk stouts to begin with, especially the darkies. THAT is an aquired taste, very British. I don't know one milk stout done by the great American brewers, ie Russian River, Founders, Bells, Stone.. and that's a large number of beers. Anyhow, I will make an effort to try it in a can/bottle. and make sure its near frozen to start, and I will work to be more open to the style, as I suspect it's very good at what its trying to be. Also, there's a chance that my glass or the tap lines were dirty or polluted somehow.  Yes, if the guy would have exchanged my glass of Double Chocolate for a OE 40, i would have taken him up on it.  Also, I've had TWO friends get stuck with the moo thunder, and I will bet that that's far worse. I hear its epically rough. I want to do a side by side comparison and I will modify my review if necessary. If not, a 40oz backup plan is fairly cheap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

As I lift my fine crafted sniffer glass to my mauve colored quivering lips, my mouth begins to release bountiful droplets of clean paleted saliva awaiting the arrival of the chocolatley goodness.

S - Chocolate syrup, dark chocolate nibs, roasted coffee bean shells, white pepper.  T - Pure bliss (or luxury, as labeled on the bottle). This drinks smooth, creamy and mellow with tamed carbonation that's a perfect compliment for the delicate flavors this entails. Milk chocolate mid-palate with some light alcohol esters sticking around on the finish.  M - Smooth, creamy and mellow.  D - At 5.2% I was surprised to see alcohol here, so I knocked it down 0.5 point. Dangerously drinkable for it's flavors but I wish those heat esters would mellow out a bit more than they are.

Tasted very sweet on the front of the pallet. Some dark and caramel malts. A little bit of coffee to finish off.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, like silk.

664,73,flipper2gv,4.45,"A: Near pure black color, but I've been able to see some brown in it. Aggressive pour gives a good nice 2-3 inches beige head, really creamy looking. Retention is ok but lacing is quite superb for the abv. Really good looking beer for sure.  S: There is a lot of sweet chocolate in this. Definitely smells like a good glass of chocolate milk. There is also strong amount of maple syrup smell in this. Slight roasted malts smell but not as much as most stouts, a bit of coffee. Vanilla and brown sugar are in there too. Light nuttyness. I differ with other reviewers and thought this one smelled quite strong considering it's a low abv stout.  T: Well the taste is much more balanced than the smell. The roasted characteristics are much more present, giving a good roasted malts and dry coffee smell. The chocolate is still there, but I expected a bit more since it's called the ""Double Chocolate Stout"", but it is right up there with most milk/sweet stout. Again, for the sweetness, there is some amount of brown sugar, toffee, maple syrup and slight vanilla. There is also definitely oatmeal in this too.  M: Medium to heavy feel with medium carbonation. Fits the beer quite well. The feel is, like with most milk/sweet stout, very creamy.  D: Superb drinkability considering it's a stout. The taste is very balanced and interesting.

It was a transcendental moment for me. Anyway, the body is opaque and the head is super creamy and tan in apprearance. The head stuck around for a long time and left decent lacing.  S-Eh, kinda bland. The nose is vaguely sweet, but that's about it.  T-The first quarter of the brew was kinda boring, tasted a lot like a more burnt Guinness. But once the beer warmed up, the choclate notes really came out, especially on the finish.  MF-Holy crap, this is without a doubt the creamiest beer I have ever had. The head was omnipresent, therefore getting through it to the beer with every sip gave a very creamy feel.

I do smell a decent amount of hops upfront, which is strange for me for a stout.  A decently thick creamy body. Hardly any carbonation at all. It feels really light in the mouth, reminds me of whip cream.  The taste is all roasted chocolate malts and a slight bitterness in hops.

Not bad, but not exactly what I expected or hoped for.  Taste - It's a nice toasty flavour, but again, the chocolate doesn't come through as much as I had thought it would. Don't get me wrong, the chocolate is there, but it comes in a much more subdued way. You get it on the finish, but it doesn't hold on, and the aftertaste is more milky than chocolatey.

664,73,ryan1788a5,3.74,"14.9oz Nitro can poured into a Guinness Imperial pint.  A: Pours a dark brown/black with some lighter ruby coloration. This is a nitro beer, and it has the famous ""cascading bubbles"" effect. It is fun to watch, and I'll admit it never really gets old. Very creamy and wet looking khaki-colored two finger head. Typical nitro stout appearance. The head lasts forever. In fact, it neatly deposits itself at the bottom of the glass when the beer is gone. Tons of foamy, sticky lacing clings to almost every inch of the glass.  S: Creamy milk chocolate, faint burnt smells, roasted malt, and some coffee.  T: Slightly acrid burnt taste quickly gives way to luscious milk chocolate. Coffee comes out a bit too. Finishes with milk chocolate and some roasted malt tastes.  M: Rather light on the tongue, but with that full, smooth, and creamy nitro mouthfeel. Think Guinness Draught, but a little thicker.  O: A decent beer, but the nitro mouthfeel coupled with the candy bar milk-chocolate taste just makes it all feel a little too artificial. I would like to try the bottled (non-nitro) version to see how that compares.  Edit: Some three years later I finally got around to sampling this from the bottle. As expected, I'm enjoying it quite a bit more. On nitro the milk chocolate character of the beer is played up a lot. in the bottled version a lot more roasted barley character pulls through.

664,73,Bouleboubier,3.72,"As if I was in love with them before, I'm really starting to loathe nitrogenated beer. I've had this beer twice in the past 10 days on-tap, straight CO2, and it was wonderful. Like quite nothing else I've had. Tried it in the can today (first time in awhile) and was sadly dissatisfied. Luckily, the same joint where I bought this has it in conventional bottles, so I'll atone for this insult to my tongue.  I will continue to rave about the look of beer served like this. Entertaining cascade effect, thick, off-white creamy head lending desserty meringue sheets of lacing. With the nearly pitch black color, it creates a stark, arty contrast. Love it.  The aroma and taste are (naturally) severely muted here compared to the regular drafts I had previously. The biggest casualty perhaps is the decadent dark chocolate flavor, unlike any other brew. A good bit of hoppy bitterness and the soft roasty/toasty biscuity malt remains, but without the chocolate, this is hardly the complete package. But for it's style, I'm happy to find only the slightest sweetness (in either of the servings I've had so far), whereas I've come accustomed to tasting a more sour, sugary sweet character taken from the lactose.

664,73,rtepiak,4.15,a great style for the nitro can and a wonderful chocolate feel of creaminess. look is eye candy out of the candy and has a delicious tasting head. nose of carob and cocoa. this is in the palate obviously with a cocoa added quality to it. not extremely thick and rich though. besides the noted chocolate the beer as an interesting toastiness about it. a tad sour licorice smokey. and a mild mineral chalk feel.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Dreadnaught33,3.87,"A: Awesome pinky size head that will not go down, lots of lacing left after each sip and a jet black color. What more do you expect from a draft (nitro) stout?  S: Had to really get almost into the foam to get a good idea of the aroma...chocolate, dark fruit, malt and very faint hop bitters. Faint, unfortunately, but good when you get it.  T: Like a malted chocolate milkshake, a little hop bitters and some slightly toasted malt to round it out. Very nice.  M: Very creamy and smooth, excellent feel as you'd expect for a pub draft.  D: Nice stuff, and easy to drink as a draft. No more than one pint of this will do though, it's just a little too sweet and chocolatey for too much of this.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Adamthome1,4.36,"500mL bottle, best by 3/26/11  Pours nicely with a good head which has good retention throughout.  Smell is dominated by sweet milk and dark chocolates, really not much else there, no caramel or coffee smells like I expected to go along w/choc....Pleasantly surprised with that  Mouthfeel is extra creamy, as if I 'd added milk to the beer...has creamier, more balanced flavor than many so called cream stouts  Very smooth to drink, flavors remain constant with smell...very mild caramel and coffee hints, texture is very creamy which is perfect with the milky flavor...not overly carbonated and only 5.2% alcohol, the only thing double about this beer is the chocolate, not the alcohol. I like this, nice to have a smooth drinking specialty stout for a change.  Not overly sweet but sweet nevertheless, pair with some chocolate or chocolate inspired deserts.  Do yourself a favor and let the last half of the beer warm to 60 degrees F or more, brings out the texture.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,gopens44,4.2,"A - Dark with a generous foaming head. When I say dark, I mean no light escaping through the glass. Thick, but not horribly so.  S - Coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. Maybe a touch of caramel that may have been more molasses in nature once I drank it, but it came across initially as caramel  T -Very nice. Smooth and lives up to the chocolate name. There is plenty of complexity here beyond the obvious. The coffee taste was held in check by the molasses flavor. The chocolate taste was similar to that of dark chocolate, but maybe not as bitter.  M - Creamy, smooth and of mid to low carbonation  I'll drink this every time I have a chance! I'll need to come up with some stout rotation though!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Like a warm mug of hot cocoa.  T- Chocolate again. Aftertaste lingers for awhile. This is a good thing.  M- Very creamy. Can feel the alcohol a little.  D- Love this beer.

664,73,LumpyGuitar,3.94,"Had this in a bottle with a breakfast of ham and eggs.  Poured a solid black with a thin tan head. Retention was poor, and lacing was average.  Smells of dark roasted malts, and bakers chocolate.  Taste is strong, chocolately with a bit of sweet molasses. Bitter dark chocolate overtones.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy but not sticky. Heavy in body, carbonation is almost nonexistant.  Drinkability is good. I could easily have another of these and they go great with coffee and breakfast.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jgnam,2.87,"I had this on tap once a long time ago, remembered it being decent, and having enjoyed many chocolate stouts since then, I decided to revisit.  My first shot was the can, and it was a big disappointment. Mouthfeel was extremely watery; like Guinness Draught. The flavor was very feint compared to other chocolate stouts, though it was still at least slightly better than a macrobrew. Appearance was better than expected as the large can does not allow the same careful pour as a bottle; this caused extra foam, which mixed into the beer creating a rich creamy mocha look which was unfortunately not in keeping with the taste.  I decided to give the bottle a shot the next night thinking that maybe the can was just not the real deal. The mouthfeel was slightly better, with a heavier, grainier carbonation and slightly thicker consistency. Flavor was still very subdued, the chocolate notes seemed to get stronger towards the bottom of the glass but were still a mere fraction of what you get from other chocolate stouts. Appearance was not as forgiving as from the can; a careful pour produced virtually no head, exposing the stout's relatively meager consistency.  On the upside, both the can and bottle forms of this beer were at least fairly quaffable, owing to the watery consistency and unnoffensive (if unrewarding) taste. It was easy to drink but each sip left me unsatisfied, looking for more.  All in all I don't understand why this brew has been so well reviewed. The can version tastes like a mix of 2 parts Guiness Draught, 1 part Bell's Double Cream. The bottle feels like maybe a 50/50 mix. It's not the worst stout out there, but it's a far cry from other highly rated stouts. Bell's Special Double, Old Rasputin and Founder's Breakfast Stout all have a much more successful chocolate presence than Young's, aside from being far richer in all other respects. When you bring Southern Tier's various chocolate brews into the mix, there is not even a sliver of contest.  I can see how if you're used to Guinness and Murphy's, and haven't tried a lot of richer stouts, then Young's might seem more familiar and easier to take. If it's on tap and there aren't any other microbrew stouts on the menu, I might do it (I also remember the tap version being MUCH thicker). However, the fact that so many experienced beer fans have rated it so highly baffles me. Young's is also a little pricey; why pay more for a mediocre beer?",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TheStig,4.63,"a: Opaque and black like India ink; pouring it from a bottle into a glass produced a finger of full-bodied light-tan/ivory head.  s: Chocolate is most prominent, primarily because it's actually included in the recipe-- no hunting for smells or tastes here! A lot of ""roasted"" stout smells here too-- a coffee-type smell (as someone who lives off of coffee, this is close to coffee, but it's not.) is secondary.  t: A perfect balance of stout bitterness and chocolate sweetness. I wonder if they used unsweetened chocolate-- it's got the same bitterness and subtle sweetness of this stout. Now that I think about it, if you've ever had a piece of 99% dark chocolate but in a creamy liquid form, this beer is the closest to that.  m: Full and smooth, rich and creamy. It's a proper stout with the appropriate ""heavy"" feel. Like a chocolate beer milkshake.  d: Perfect. I'd drink this a lot more if it was more available in my area, but the secret is out about how great a beer this is.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TheSeeker61,4.65,A- Poured with an inch creamy head. Black like oil.  S- Nice chocolate caramel smell.  T- a smoothe chocolate taste from the beginning to the end.  M- A medium mouthfeel. Went down in a silky way.  D- Enjoyed drinking this one. Because of the low ABV for a stout could session these. Looking forward to drinking this one again.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,lordofthewiens,4.1,"In a pint glass the beer was jet black with a moderately-sized tan head. It had a pronounced chocolate arom, with a bit of roasted malt. Chocolate taste, both sweet and dark. A little bit of coffee. Surprisingly dry mouthfeel. I drank this on a night where much beer and many varieties of food had been consumed, and still found this to be very flavorful.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jorg2619,3.97,I have not revisited this beer in some time so I bought a four pack of nitro cans. This stout is jet black with a white head that dissipates slowly into a thin line. Chocolate is the smell with a hint of lactose and some hints of roasty malts. The taste is pure chocolate in the center that is coated in coffee or roasted flavors. The mouthfeel is very disappointing to me. I did not remember the thin watery feel of this beer. The thinness distracted me from the perfect flavors.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ngeunit1,4.41,"A - Pours a really pure jet black color, with a really crisp finger-think line of head that just stays in place the entire time.  S - Notes of roasted coffee beans with a feint smell of chocolate also present.  T - Chocolate taste but not as strong as one would expect based on smell, though it is fairly present at the end. Malty the whole way through from beginning to end. The aftertaste is a bit bitter almost like a coffee aftertaste, but less sharp. Really balanced taste from start to end.  M - Amazingly smooth and creamy. Medium to medium-heavy body.  D - Rich and complex, while still staying smooth and easy to drink. An amazing stout that keeps body without sacrificing drinkability.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Evocatus,4.13,"Pours a dark coffee color with a tan head, pretty much what a great stout looks like. Cocoa armoa was definitely there, as well as some roasted malts. Very low in bitterness, somewhat of a mix of dark chocolate and black coffee. Good thickness, could be a tad thicker, but I won't complain. Great desert beer as it's easy on the pallet , but it's also pretty pricey. Best for semi-special occasions/meals.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kwjd,3.96,"Pours a dark brown colour with thick tan head. Tons of lacing around the glass. Smells of mild sweet chocolate and some roasted malt. Flavour has a nice bitterness, balanced with the sweet chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel. For a low alcohol stout, this packs a ton of flavour. One of my go-to stouts when I don't feel like drinking an imperial one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,teromous,3.94,"A: The standard black color a person would expect from a good stout, that pours a thumb's width of head that lingers about 1/2 the size of a finger. The head lasts at least 2min, maybe longer but I couldn't wait to drink it. It laces a nice light tan curve off the glass right onto the surface of the beer as the head dies down.  S: There is very little smell, but the chocolate scent is there and I pick up a hint of roasted grains. Nothing spectacular here.  T: It has a much stronger chocolate presence than other chocolate beers I've had. Long after drinking the beer I can taste the dark flavor of the chocolate. There is zero bitterness in this beer.  M: It doesn't have a very strong mouthfeel. The chocolaty milky sensation happens after drinking the beer, not while inside the mouth. It coats fairly well, but it's not as milky as I'd expect. Also it doesn't wake up the mouth with any real sensation. As aforementioned there is a ""wow"" factor but it's after drinking.  D: This one is very drinkable, and it's because it leaves me craving the chocolate flavor after each drink. The low alcohol content (5.2% ABV) means you could drink this for a while before feeling the effects. It would make a good holiday beer when not wanting to get overly imbibed but retain the chocolate stout flavor.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bsp77,4.16,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Imperial Pint.  Appearance: Jet black with a root beer float head that really lasts, leaving great lacing behind. Possibly the best looking Stout I have ever seen.  Smell: Roasted barley, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel and English spicy hops. While the dark chocolate is the main scent left after sitting in the glass awhile, it is slightly more subdued than expected.  Taste: In contrast to the aroma, the dark chocolate is very apparent in the taste, and augmented nicely by roasted barley, coffee, molasses and rich dark fruit. Ends somewhat spicy and bitter, with a slight metallic cast.  Feel: Moderately low carbonation, very creamy smooth body that is just slightly too light. Somewhat dry finish.  Drinkability: Simply a delicious, session-like Stout. Surprised it took me so long to try this.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rasolante1,4.13,"Appearance: Dark black appearance with a creamy brown head. The lacing was beautiful and stuck to the glass until the last sip.  Smell: Grainy, chocolately, slight roastiness, and a touch of sweetness. As the beer warmed I detected hints of maple syrup.  Taste: Lots of chocolate notes. The roast really comes through in the flavor giving it a great coffee character.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth mouthfeel. Low carbonation and body make for a very silky and creamy feel.  Drinkability: I could drink this beer everyday! The alcohol and body are not too substantial making it a very easy drinker. This is one of the best stouts out there!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TheKingofWichita,4.12,"Another classic brew. A great brew as well. Pours a deep brown color with a tan head (that never leaves) and insane amount of lacing. Smells wonderful, like a chocolate milk shake with coffee notes. Tastes of milk chocolate with chocolate malts and a little coffee bitterness to lessen the strong sweetness. Mouthfeel is great with a thick oily body. Drinkability is high.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,steveh,4.03,"Another past favorite, if not as far back as many others.  BA has this listed as a Sweet Stout, though I'm not sure the addition of chocolate wouldn't make this a specialty beer of some sort -- nonetheless.  Chose the bottle because I've always liked the body and character better than the nitro can. Best-by date of April, 2011.  A -- Opaque, inky black with a dense, long-lasting, dark tan, chocolate milk colored head. Mag-Lite® thru my glass shows ruby highlights.  S -- Creamed coffee and cocoa notes, some earthiness -- whether from hops or roasted malts isn't apparent. Light roasted malt character back.  T -- Roasted malts up front that blend into a coffee and cocoa bean character. Some candy sweetness balanced with the bitterness of the roasted malts and maybe some English hops -- Goldings, I'd guess. No real fruit esters to find through the roasted malts and sweet chocolate.  M -- Medium to medium-heavy body with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  D -- Very easy to drink, but more than two would probably become filling. Rich and satisfying, nonetheless. An eye-opener for people who think beer can't have character.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,thagr81us,4.03,"Served from tap into a SweetWater 420 shaker. Poured dark dark brown with a one finger off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The flavor was of roasted malt, cream, coffee, slight caramel, and a nutty note. It had a heavy feel on the palate with no carbonation anywhere to be found. Overall this was a nice brew. However, the flavors were kind of light at least to me.

This is the beauty of the nitro-bottle. Absolutely fantastic.  S : Very feint smell, chocolate note, but a bit of roasty malt as well.  T : Surprisingly roasty. Chocolate is present, but not overpowering, and largely on the finish.  M : Creamy and smooth. Quite nice.

Leaves a nice aftertaste of more bitter chocolate and again, coffee. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is light which I prefer for this style. Not too heavy so drinkability should be okay.

I'm hit with sweet milk chocolate upfront, and then the dark malts make themselves known. The finish is of bitter dark chocolate with a touch of earthy hops.  Full-bodied with mild carbonation yields a rich and creamy mouthfeel.  This is very easy drinking, but also very rich... one is plenty!

664,73,Clamwacker,4.53,"Oh yeah! I found the slightly-larger-than-a-pint bottles of this at my local grocery store and had to give it a try. This has been a hot and humid week, so after the sun sets and it starts to cool down, a nice stout really hits the spot.  This one pours almost completely black into my snifter, with a finger of brown head that dissipated rather quickly, leaving rather nice lace. There's something about certain high quality beers that makes the little wispy head that remains more beautiful than others, or perhaps that is confirmation bias. Either way, after the initial smell and sip, the remaining bubbles formed the continent of Australia in my snifter glass.  The aroma is incredible, deep cocoa aroma gives a very slightly sour note, backed up by grainy malts. The chocolate by far overpowers any other aromas.  The same goes for the flavor, initially. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! A milky chocolate flavor hits the front of the tongue, but the aftertaste has more of a bitter chocolate flavor, like the expensive ""85% cocoa"" chocolate bars you see at the store. Once warmer, there is a fruity, peppery essence behind it, but it quickly moves out of the way of a renewed rush of chocolate.  The feel is terrific as well. Smooth and creamy, lightly carbonated, and as my glass warmed it only got better.  It is very drinkable, but not something I would want to open more than one of in a given night. The flavor is just too rich, it would be like eating a big dinner, then following it with cheesecake, and then, for some reason, following that with tiramisu. Unthinkable! Savor this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Nice thick head that slowly fades leaving some nice lacing.  S: Tons of chocolate and deep, roasty malts. Not overly complex, but very pleasant.  T: They say double chocolate and that's no lie. The chocolate hits you right up front with a very intense flavor. As it fades I taste first coffee, then a vanilla flavor. It's a really good flavor, but I can't help but feel that it's a bit lacking. Like the aroma there isn't enough complexity to keep me really interested for two long.  M: Creamy, not overly sticky. Very nice and pleasant.  D: Overall a good beer. I would definitely try this one again.

This doesn't hold a candle to the best chocolate stouts: Rogue's Chocolate Stout and their Double Chocolate Stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BBP,4.14,"A- Very dark and thick. Light can only get through a quarter of an inch of it. Not too much head this time. Next time I would do a complete hard pour to create some. Still maintains the head quite well.  S- Chocolate first and foremost. Some malts. Almost a tinge of raisin. Coffee and vanilla.  T- Chocolate and malts come after you and get a solid hold on your tongue for a while. After it sits for a bit the malt flavor starts to expand on your tongue leaving hints of caramel, coffee, and vanilla. My only complaint is that it could be a bit less sweet and a tad more bitter. The taste improved as it warmed up as well.  M- Seems quite full and thin at the same time. It's like the body is thick, but it escapes down you without leaving too much of a trace. Considerably creamy, and has a very smooth feel. Again I'd recommend a hard pour, as more carbonation would do this brew well.  D- Very smooth and easy to down. Leaves a good amount of flavor behind, and is fairly elaborate. I would recommend drinking this somewhere between fridge temp and room temp. That being said, I don't think this is the beer for a hot summer day, but something I'd enjoy more during the other seasons.  All in all, I found it quite good. Definitely redeems stouts for me, seeing as my first stout was guinness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,QuestionableScum,4.25,"Appearance- Black body with a tan head that is somewhat soapy.  Smell- Malts, dark chocolate, roasty smell, with some coffee as well.  Flavour- The initial flavour is sweet and malty with some molasses overtones, however the flavours fades into a smoky coffee/bittersweet chocolate finish. Also as I continued to drink this I noticed some milk chocolate along with the malts that became more predominant as the beer got warmer (I thought after leaving it out for 35 minutes I would be okay, but next time I would leave it out for 45 minutes). Overall the flavour of this beer is great, really enjoying it.  Mouthfeel- The mouthfeel is fairly heavy bodied, but it does not come off as chewy, but is rather somewhat oily and a little sticky, but still quite smooth.  Drinkability- For a stout this is quite drinkable, but definitely not a session beer. The heaviness of this beer, gives it the characteristic of being a meal in a glass, and therefore one needs only one of these.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,WinthrHOPHEAD89,4.37,"Poured into a glass goblet.  A - Pours a one finger dark brown soapy head that dissapates rather quickly, although leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Complete opaque black complexion that you can't (or at least I could not) see through. Other than than pretty standard appearence for a chocolate stout.  S - The smell of this beer is very warm and inviting with LOTS of fresh chocolate in the nose. Not as potent as the Harpoon: Chocolate Stout or as rich smelling as the Southern Tier: Choklat but still a very appealing and delicious aroma in the nose.  T - Before taking your first actual sip you can taste the chocolate on your lips from just the head alone, just like the Harpoon. The taste is pure chocolate up front with no real bitterness on the finish. The taste seems to be more of a milk chocolate (although I don't know for sure), and doesn't have a bitter chocolaty taste, ala bakers chocolate, like the ""Choklat"", EVEN after it warms. All in all, VERY very tasty!! One of the best chocolate stouts, as well as stouts in general, that I have ever had the oppertunity to try.  M - The mouthfeel of this is fairly soft. This beer is medium bodied and doesnt have the thinness of most stouts (ALA Guinness, or Murphy's), but doesn't have an overpowering syrupy quality to it like Harpoon's Chocolate does.  D - The Drinkability on this beer is about medium. Im sure the average stout drinker would have no problem with this beer, but this beer is certainly NOT for the average beer drinker.  Final thoughts: Phenonminal Beer!!! Would definitely recommend, and would most certainly buy again!!  ...I'm curious as to how this tastes from the can, for this review was done from the bottle.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

This beer is slightly sweet on the nose with the slightest hint of dark chocolate. The first taste you notice is bitter, dark chocolate which sweetens into a taste that resembles chocolate milkshake.

664,73,HURTemHIZZY,3.92,"Pours a near black, with a one finger tan head that dissipates to a ring in a minute but remains at a nice sized ring until the brew is finished.  Smell is delicious. Nice blend of dark chocolate, coffee, slight hoppy undertones, a bit of milk chocolate, and a nice note of vanilla. Love this aroma.  Well a lot of times I can say that the taste follows the aroma, but unfortunately that is not the case here. The taste is still good, just not as good as the aroma. The milk chocolate and vanilla are completely gone, and the coffee is toned down a ton. I get mainly bittersweet chocolate and underlying hop notes. Maybe some earthy notes as well.  Nice creamy mouthfeel, with a bit of carbonation that complements it nicely. Nice drinkability as well, fairly low abv with a good amount of flavor and a nice mouthfeel.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S- Not much smell, but when I did catch a whif, it was like a freshly opened dark chocolate bar.  T-More bitter than I expected. Very little chocolate taste, more of a coffee taste to it. This coffee taste only increased over time as I drank.  M-Smooth, thick, and slightly oily. With the creamy head it was very pleasant  D-Decreased over time. First few sips were great, but as I reached the end, became harder to finish the beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jeranbrews,4.05,A - A thick foamy milk chocolate head that settles in yeasty clumps above dark brown almost opaque body.  S - Initial smells from the bottle and the beer itself are light fluffy milk chocolate pastries. Chocolate cookies with chocolate frosting. Might be too sweet for some people. Malty roast flavors also present along with faint yeasty smells. Let it warm up to something closer to English room temperature and the sweet bakery smells come out even more  T - Yep it's chocolatey. The beginning and the finish are sweet milk chocolate. In-between there are some smokey roasted flavors and some paju hops maybe Irish moss.  M - Not too fizzy but also not as thick as I would imagine for a malty English stout. Just a bit of bitterness hangs around.  D - The sweetness with bitterness of this beer keeps it from being good anytime.

Excellent stout!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,StarshipPoopers,4.03,"A - This stout has a very appealing appearance. The colour is very opaque, a very rich dark brown and almost black. The head is definitely impressive on this, I gave it a hard pour and got 3 or 4 fingers of head. The head looks very smooth and bubbly and is a nice mocha colour, it starts to dissipate quickly. Settles down to a thin film over the surface with nice retention. Lots of head lingering on the glass as I drink it, certainly a very nice feature.  S - Dark chocolate is the most evident smell coming from the glass. Notes of coffee are also present. Has the smell you would expect from a stout, nothing really jumps out as unique but it's a good solid smell.  T - A rather dark and roasted chocolate flavour is certainly the most prominent flavour. The chocolate flavour is slightly bitter. I was expecting the chocolate flavours to be sweeter, so I was pleasantly surprised to find the slight bitterness that comes with darker chocolates. There are strong notes of coffee flavour to it as well. There are also more subtle flavours that are harder to detect thanks to the prominence of the chocolate and coffee. The aftertaste is nice, a long lasting taste of the beer's original flavour.  M - Nice and smooth, but it could be a little bit thicker. All around though, it is pleasant to let linger and is a beer that you can enjoy and take your time with. Certainly an enjoyable feeling that surpasses a lot of other beers.  D - In terms of quality, this certainly has great drinkability. It's one of those beers that you want to drag out for a long time. Each swig is enjoyable and it took me quite a while to finish this just because I enjoyed it so much. In terms of quantity, one or two of these would be enough for me.  I am very pleased with this beer, I will certainly be trying it again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

You would think that from the smell it would be too much but definitely not an over-bearing beer.  Mouthfeel: Smooth. Funny, because at first glance people tend to think this is like drinking mud but thanks to the carbonation and balance very, very smooth and easy to drink.

Whats nice is the chocolate isn't overpowering as I can taste roasted malts balancing really well with the overall flavor.  Mouthfeel: It's more carbonated then I expected it to be, but thats not a bad thing considering it breaks up the heaviness of the beer.

Carbonation is very low.  Taste is like taking in a mouthful of cocoa. Very chocolatey in the front. Unlike some other chocolate stouts, the chocolate here has a sweet character, almost like a cold hot cocoa. This sweet cocoa continues into the finish, where some dryness and roasted dark chocolate assert themselves. Finish is rather dry, but pretty clean.

664,73,StephenRich,4.25,"In Ontario, Young's double Chocolate Stout is my go to beer when I'm looking for a creamy, sweet, roasty chocolate stout. It's soothing, satisfying, and very savory and balanced with chocolate malt and smooth hops. For me, it's an excellent, if not close to perfect balance. There certainly are chocolate stouts out there with more chocolate character, but in terms of balance, quality, and pure enjoyment, time and time again the Double Chocolate Stout beats everything available in Ontario.  The Double Chocolate Stout is brewed by the historic Wells & Young's Brewing Company in Bedford UK and has won several awards in international beer competitions.  Wells & Young's does put it perfectly themselves, ""Chocolate malt and real dark chocolate are combined with Young's award winning rich, full flavored dark beer to craft a satisfyingly indulgent, but never overly sweet experience."" It's all true; Wells & Young's combines Pale Malt, Crystal Malt and Chocolate Malts with Fuggle and Goldings hops, and pure dark chocolate to deliver a creamy and luxurious stout with balance and elegance. I do love it.  I get it at LCBO's in individual 5.2%, 500 ml dark bottles bearing a purple and pale gold label with Yong's standard ram's horn logo upfront. The Double Chocolate Stout pours smooth and black forming a short but firm tan head. The beer is almost pitch-black with a slightly amber hue. The nose is light and creamy with roast, dark chocolate, and slightly crisp hops.  Once I smell the chocolate on the nose, I'm instantly excited to taste the beer. It coats your palate cleanly and evenly with a creamy and luscious texture pouring light roast, bakers chocolate, and cocoa everywhere. It's got light sweet chocolate on the tongue, which balances out across the palate with roast and dry malts, than touches of floral hops that clean away the creamy stout. It actually creates a very refreshing and at the same time satisfying beer.  It's so balanced and overall delicious that it makes an amazing pairing with a huge variety of foods. Almost anything with chocolate is an obvious choice, but its immaculate with all varieties of cheesecake (especially classic New York Strawberry), any creamy and lightly funky cheese, grilled red meats, pastas with avocado or pesto, fish and chips, French onion soup, and more; the perfect balance of sweet, bitter, roast and savory just plays so well with so many dishes. Not to mention, try making pancakes with the Double Chocolate Stout rather than using milk or cream, and you will be in beer breakfast heaven!  The Double Chocolate Stout is with no question a game changer for me; it's one of the early beers that convinced me that real beer can force your palate out of hibernation, and it's one of the first beers that I offer to newcomers who are looking for excitement and to be entertained by their beer.

T= immediate dark chocolate, something along the semi-sweet line rather than just uber-Swiss dark, nice dry coffee, toffee notes, something giving a rather bright nice taste on my tongue that I can't quite identify (maybe a hint of mint).  M= very nice, somewhat remniscent of the aftertaste of a high quality real-chocolate hot cocoa that doesn't just use milk chocolate; dry coffee traits lingering, plentiful salivation following it closely.

664,73,Walken,4.5,"Young's: Double Chocolate Stout (Best by: March, 2011) (Tasted 08/09/10) 16 oz. can, poured into a becker.  Appearance: Once the floor show is finished, I am left with an opaque, black beer with brown edges, topped by a creamy, solid mass of tightly knit mocha bubbles, frothy on top, great retention and lacing. Odor: Powdered cocoa mix, muted acrid roastiness and a non-descript fruitiness. Consistency: Medium bodied beer, malt and soft nitro carbonation make it seem fuller than it is though. Dry, slightly minerally character going on. Fat & sassy all around. Flavor: Hot cocoa and general malt/lacto-ish sweetness play against a light kiss of hop bitterness and a solid roasted back-end that comes close enough to balancing without obscuring the overall flavor. Finish is bittersweet chocolate, lightly fudgey.  Fantastic beer, then, now and hopefully, always.

The smell consisted of a slight chocolate aroma with hints of caramel and a unpleasant metallic. The taste was average and muted. The flavor did not jump out of the glass like in the case of an imperial stout. However, it was pleasant and suprisingly dry. Mouthfeel, however, was a bit thick without the pleasure of a thick, rich taste. It coated the mouth with a dull sensation which lessened the desire for the next sip.

664,73,rawthar,3.48,"11.2 oz bottle into a tumbler.  A- A bit disappointingly thin, not entirely opaque. Perhaps I'm spoiled by all of the Imperials that I usually drink. However, the tradeoff is that the head is a little more persistent and creamy than the typical high gravity guys.  S- Grainy chocolate malts dominate the added black bitter chocolate. Those are definitely the bulk of the aroma characters, but not as intensely chocolatey as one would expect. Opens up nicely as it warms up.  T- If you're looking for an intense chocolate experience, this is probably not it. The front comes off like watered down chocolate milk, and could really stand to have the volume turned up a bit. Lactic acid comes off a hint sour in the middle. Redeemed by what seems like a generous amount of tasty hop bitterness on the back end, which adds an interesting complexity in light of the other two major components. Added another .5 after it warmed up. Gets exponentially better with a little time to breathe, mostly attributable to the hop punch.

Hops are somewhere in there, balancing out the sweetness of the chocolate with a bit of bitter, but they don't seem to be meant to do anything but provide balance. You'd notice their absence more than their presence--a very subtle use.  M and D: The feel is good. Very creamy but with a slightly thinner finish than I'd like it to have. As for drinkability, I'd stick to one or two. It's not that it doesn't go down easy at first. It's just that it is basically a meal in a bottle.

664,73,bigbodybussey,4.12,"I had this on tap at a local Pizza joint. This is my first shot at a beer review, but here goes.  A - served in a pint glass. A very dark beer with a moderate amount of tan/cream colored head.  S - The smell resembled hersheys cocoa powder with a slight amount of hoppiness.  Taste - Some immediate cocoa flavors that were followed by slight coffee and vanilla undertones. Definetly a bittersweet chocolate flavor. There was not a great deal of hoppiness to the beer.  M - It was a lighter to medium bodied brew with slight carbonation.  D - This a unique beer that is better paired with a desert course. It goes down smoother than expected and is an overall great beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,SFLpunk,3.86,"16.9 oz brown glass pry-top bottle. Neck stamped ""21/11/10 A, L328 20 . 31""  Appearance: Poured into a tulip pint with lots of thick creamy tan head atop an opaque cola brown/black body.  Nose: Smells like oxidized chocolate bars (you know, when it gets that ash-y look to it), but not in a bad way. Bittersweet chocolate, vanilla extract and some faint hops maybe?  Palate: Medium-bodied and not as creamy as I expected. Chocolate malts dominate the real chocolate and it's definitely in the bittersweet/baking chocolate realm of things. Some dried vanilla bean flavors and malted rye or ""crunchy"" grain flavors too.  Notes: Honestly, not as good as I remembered it being. I think the nitro-can makes all the difference for this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer and a real deal too with how ""cheap"" it is, but it's not as full and rich as I'd like it to be. I miss the nitro-cans.

Very creamy dark stout with a wonderful head, it makes for a very appealing glass. The smell is slightly sweet with malt and a very light chocolate note. Taste is malt, chocolate, slight burnt toffee as it warms up. Mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy and smooth. Drinkability is very good, although as a stout it tends to fill you up after only a few.  This is a beer you will go back to again and again even if you previously were not a particular fan of stouts. Note that this tends to be a little more expensive in certain areas, I typically see it for $9-$10 for a four pack of nitro-cans.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The taste is also rich, dark chocolate. This is the first ""dessert"" beer that I ever tried and have loved it since. The mouthfeel is creamy but a bit watery. I have also tried this beer in a bottle and in my opinion tastes completely different. This is just a great, easy drinking beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The heads recedes at a quick pace and leaves no noticeable lacing but stops at a nice thin film.  S - Mild chocolate powder aromas are very pleasant. Good sweetness in the nose followed by some mild roasted character. Not as strong as expected but still chocolatey.  T - Nice chocolatey powder sweetness and some chocolate bitterness as well. After the chocolate part there are some nice roasted notes that aren't too overwhelming and balance well with the chocolate. There is a bit of a dry finish with a nice lingering chocolate sweetness to the beer. There is that lactic quality that most milk stouts have.

664,73,AlCaponeJunior,4.13,"Pours as motor-oil black as they come, with a nice brown head that dissipates into a thin layer after a bit, but leaves plenty of nice lacing.  Smells of sweet dark chocolate, but less so than I expected. Also has overtones of roasted malts, but nothing too distinct beyond that.  Now the taste is quite nice. Subtle roasted malts, smoke, sweet prunes, and coffee accent the pronounced, but not overbearing chocolate taste. It's almost like drinking a milk chocolate beer with a lingering dark chocolate aftertaste. I really didn't notice much in the way of hops or bitterness other than a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Feels almost like a milkshake in your mouth it's so thick and creamy. Not a whole lot of carbonation, but then the style doesn't demand it. Fairly dry.  Drinks down easy, not nearly as heavy as you'd expect for such a thick and creamy beer.

A: Big rocky dark tan head over a deep brown body. Good lacing and a creamy cover.  T: Dark roasted malt dominates, with just a hint of bitter chocolate and nuttiness. Good brew, but gets docked for not delivering the flavor that the name suggests.  M: Creamy. Medium body with low to medium carbonation. Very smooth.  D: Very sessionable brew with a good flavor and pleasing mouth. Would work well with food or solo.

Thick, creamy tan head, seriously one of the best I've ever seen. The head diminishes but hangs around for the entire glass with a lot of lacing. Just beautiful to look at after the pour.  S: Faint chocolate with some bitterness to the nose. Some roasted malt. Nothing really jumps out at you here.  T: Roasted malt with some chocolate dominates the nose. A touch of bitterness at the end but not much. There's a little hop flavor but it's not pronounced, nor should it be in my opinion.  M: Smooth and creamy on the tongue. Chocolate milkshake anyone? I'm loving the smoothness of this beer, it's just fantastic.  D: Super smooth and creamy, great roasted malt and chocolate flavor. This is a really easy beer to drink and enjoy.

Some big but thin lacing.  S- Not much. Mineral water and a hint of chocolate but it's still relatively cold. Almond liqueur or Amaretto is starting to come out. Halfway through the glass and it kind of smells like a chocolate whisky.  T- Prune juice and red wine tannin. Some wooden barrel in here similar to whisky. A bit watery which I was not expecting. There's obviously some chcocolate or cocoa powder in here but not enough to call this Double Chocolate.  M- Medium mouthfeel. High carbonation. Dry finish. I'm undecided about this and having a hard time figuring out if I enjoy it or not. It's not the smooth creamy feel I waslooking for but it is a crisp refreshing one though.  D- Very good. Taste is fine and feels pretty light.  Reminds me of a schwarzbier which wasn't what I was looking for when buying a Double Chocolate Stout. Not rich enough. A good beer but disappointing.

Stays near a finger from start to finish and plasters the glass with lacing. Looks very impressive as expected, but I could never give a nitro a 5. It would just not be fair.  Smells very much like a dark chocolate Hershey bar. Some cream and a tiny bit of leafy hops. The chocolate scent is great and authentic.  The taste is a disappointment. Tastes very tinny right off the bat, not sure if this has anything to do with the can. The chocolate is obviously there but seems very watered down. It has a bit of a Hershey bar/chocolate milk vibe to it. The hops are grassy and a little bit earthy. A touch of caramel. Flavor is best in the aftertaste to me. Finish is sweeter and more enjoyable.  Head is very smooth from the nitro, but mouthfeel is too watery thin for me. Carbonation is high too.  Milk stouts aren't my favorite style, this one to me wasn't much better than the few others I've had.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Durge,4.38,"Found on tap at the Fredericksburg Pub in Fredericksburg, VA this creamy looking beverage is a thick black color with a big, finely constituted tan head and very nice lacing. The aroma brings out a very tasty chocolate malt and just a hint of leafy hop. The flavor is a very chocolate malted clone with a subtle charcoal aftertaste. This stuff is velvetty smooth and medium bodied for a very sensually creamy experience. Sweet but balanced with a pleasant grass/leaf/citrus hop background. With all it's creaminess it offers a bit of an aqueous touch, with minimum carbonation, that adds to the decided drinkability of this nice brew. I've had this in bottles before, it seemed more syrupy and intense than this, but this may be better, and more sessionable.

S - Dominated by a light sweet aroma of dark chocolate.  T - Very chocolaty and mildly sweet flavour throughout with a dark chocolate and hop bitter finish. There's also some toffee and coffee in the flavour. The chocolate is omnipresent but not overpowering the drink. Overall it's extremely delicious.  M - Very smooth and creamy with a crisp finish.

The smell is of potent milk chocolate, cocoa, with a bit of cream.  The taste follows suit, there is a strong finish of chocolate, I instantly think of M&M's when I try to describe the flavor of chocolate. There is some roasted malts in there as well, but the chocolate dominates.  The mouthfeel is smooth, no detectable carbonation due to the stout style. Very dry aftertaste, everything is in accordance to the dry stout style.

Turns to a very pretty black. Nice thick lacing.  S - Heavy milk chocolate aroma dominates. Very sweet smelling. Slight coffee notes.  T - The flavor is a slow build. Very subtle hits of milk chocolate up front, then coffee starts coming in, dark cocoa finishes it up. Nice coffee/dark chocolate aftertaste.  Not very complex but a great beer nonetheless.

664,73,GilGarp,4.2,"500 mL bottle, best before 24-11-10.  Served cool into an imperial pint glass.  Double Chocolate Stout has a deep dark color, nearly black, with creamy bone-white head. Sturdy head and some nice lacing makes for a good looking beer.  Aroma is mostly roasty with a slightly sweet dark chocolate quality.  Flavor is actually pretty well done. I had this beer many years ago and was less than impressed. In the spirit of beer advocacy, I thought I should give it another try and I'm glad I did. There is a good balance of flavors between bitter chocolate malt and sweeter dark chocolate. Lots of character and taste for something so low in alcohol. This is a stout that doesn't need to shout to be heard.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is just a little over zealous. I would imagine that it would be fantastic on cask - softer on the tongue.  Overall a very solid English stout that deserves a try from any serious beer advocate, as over 1,800 of us already have.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The taste of chocolate is so over powering here it seems to be pushing out all of the other stilts in this brew. However, I can pick up the slightest flavor of burnt coffee at the end.

664,73,bamadog,3.97,"Review is from notes taken on 5/16/2010 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is dark brown/near black, and looks a little bit like fresh brewed coffee; starts with a 1 and 1/2 finger tan head with decent retention; body is entirely opaque; a nice curtain of lacing is left behind.  Smell: Quite nice, deep dark semi-sweet to sweet, powdery cocoa and chocolate; a nice robust roastiness as well. The smell is amazing.  Taste: Good, but not as nice as the semll and it's a little bit of a let down, overall it's still good though; dark bittersweet chocolate with a mild roastiness; there's a mild presence of an earthy hop bitterness hiding out in there as well.  Mouthfeel: A little thin and watery -- not necessarily off for the style, but if this was thicker, it would be so much better; a dry coating is left on the mouth; carbonation is present, fairly soft, yet fitting for the style as well.  Drinkability: I went with the 3.5 here -- overall it's not bad, but the taste isn't nearly as good as the smell; the ABV is moderate enough to allow for a couple, but the sweetness and overall weight wouldn't really make me want more than that.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The color of the beer itself is more of a very dark brown, rather than black, but I still can't see anything through it. The lacing is there, but it isn't super thick but it is clingy...oh well, can't be perfect I guess.  S- Well the first thing I smell is rich dark cocoa and agree with Jason Alstrom....there is a powdered hot chocolate aroma here. Aside from the super chocolaty smells and general roasted aroma, there are some mild earthy hops noticeable. Very nice smelling beer!  T- This has a great taste that is primarily of dark chocolate....it reminds be of a burnt almond chocolate bar, with a mild nutty flavor of almonds mixed in there. The finish has a good bitter flavor, somewhat from the hops, somewhat astringent from the chocolate malt used. Very nice.  M- This is a full bodied beer....thick and creamy with mild carbonation, although more than I would have thought there would be. However, it is just like chewing on a 70% cocoa chocolate square....very luxurious indeed!  D- Very drinkable. It is well balanced between the bitterness and the sweetness and I could find myself in trouble enjoying a few of these.

664,73,BeerKnights,3.15,"In summation, this beer was like the movie Cloverfield. We had been on a stout drinking stint for about a month or so, when we finally decided to end it with, what we figured, would be the ultimate stout. We weren't looking for the strongest, but the chocolateliest. The pour was great. The smell was good as well. However, once the beer hit our tongues, it was less satisfying than Cloverfield was after all the hype. While this beer was full, we found the flavor lacking. The complex and intricate flavors of the drink were a debater's wet dream, but in the end lacked ""umpf"". The taste could be best described as subtle at first, with a malty, chocolately flavor, that grows to a fuller stouty flavor that still has chocolate and malt infused. However, the taste is extremely mild, and even takes a bit of concentration to notice, making it a bad drink for nights where one has little moderation.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

So much creamy milk chocolate, yet it still tastes like beer. Really that's all there is to it, chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. But it's a natural, smooth, and tasty chocolate that mingles with the beery stout character perfectly.  One of the best, if not the best, pure chocolate beer out there.

Would go great with a peanut butter based dessert. Mild sweetness, maybe a hint of burned coffee.  Mouthfeel - carbonation overall is mild but its enough to take away from the flavor. This is an excellent example of why porter's and stout's should be enjoyed at room temperature.  Drinkability - nope, not for me.

664,73,SpdKilz,4.25,"New Beer Friday! I bought this near a year ago at this point and just never got around to actually drinking it. I was in a very ""hoppy"" mood for about a year and am gradually going back to my stouts/porters.  Appearance - Pours a nice, dark brown/black color into my Bell's tulip. Held up to the light, almost zero is able to penetrate the sides (let alone the middle) of the glass. About two fingers of mocha colored foam are achieved with a moderate pour, and it slowly dissipates leaving great looking lacing.  Smell - Cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, slight roasted coffee beans, malts. I am looking forward to drinking this.  Taste - One of the most chocolaty (appropriately) tasting beers I have ever had. This tastes freaking great right now. Bittersweet chocolate, slight dry cocoa, coffee, heavily roasted malts. Reminds me of the chocolate covered espresso beans you can buy, but better. Ironically I am not a coffee drinker nor do I eat chocolate that often, but put those into a beer and I love it.  Mouthfeel - A bit lighter than I would have liked. I heard they have nitro cans of this (versus the glass bottle I have) and I need to try it that way to get the full body of this beer. I feel if it had a bit thicker viscosity it would be much more fitting. That said, it is not ""light"" bodied by any means - I just expected it to be a lot more chewy.  Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. At only a hair over 5% abv, this is an after dinner beer you can drink for the entire rest of the night. I will for sure seek this out next Christmas for my whole family to enjoy...and enjoy it in large quantities. I should not have put off trying this beer for such a long time, but I'm glad I finally was able to have it. Will buy again if in the mood for such a type of brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kjyost,4.44,"Pours a beautiful opaque brown / black with a light tan / mocha head. The appearance though suffers due to a lack of lacing through out the drinking. The beers smells wonderful with aromas of roasted malt, but dominated by chocolate. The body of the beer is fantastically balanced, so perceivable bitterness, but enough there to remove any residual sweetness and let the creamy chocolate flavours come through. Rich and creamy. Great looking and tasting.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BreworFerment,2.97,"I think I was more disappointed by the fact that I was EXPECTING a chocolate explosion but it was more like an espresso bean only half covered in dark chocolate. I think I was psychologically thrown off by the false advertising. I liked it but I was hoping for more chocolate. The other thing that threw me off was the over carbonation. The body was lighter because of it and it was weird for a stout. It did pour beautifully though. Waterfall cascade of small bubbles like Guinness poured from a nitro tap. Once I got over the labeling though I really liked it. It just wasn't what I was expecting. Highly quaffable, low abv for a session stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,wolfinthemirror,3.75,"My first sweet stout, so let's see what's in store.  Pours very dark, pretty much black with an off white mocha head, about an inch worth. some nice lacing.  smells bitter in the sense of roasted malts, Not getting much chocolate in the smell at first. but as it warms, it really begins to reveal a deep rich chocolate aroma  I was expecting something a lot sweeter with a bigger chocolate presence for it being ""Double"" chocolate. It is there, but subdued. very malty and I get some notes of bread or cake.  medium bodied, has some milkiness to it, very smooth with light carbonation. seems lighter than the impression it gives.  This was a good beer to try once, but I don't think i'll be in a hurry to get another one. A nice beer to sip in the evening.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mountdew1,4.4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark opaque brown with a very thin light brown head. Aroma was milk chocolate, a la Hershey bar or hot chocolate. Taster alternated between milk chocolate and dark slightly burnt chocolate. Neither was overly sweet or bitter. It felt a bit thin in the mouth and slightly over carbonated. Very easy and pleasant to drink.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ktrillionaire,2.97,"A - It pours similar to a Guinness Draught, with the most insane puffy foam lacing.  S - Very little going on here. Slight roast.  T - The feel is a taste feature; creamy like a ice cream float. It has a generally mild flavor with a little roasted barley and chocolate. There is also a little cherry coffee syrup flavor that creeps up, very unwelcome.  M - Very creamy.  D - Not my favorite. It has quite a few good aspects, unfortunately taste is not one of them.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,metter98,4.03,"A: Poured black with a tan-colored head. It's very difficult to see through this beer when holding it up to a light but there appears to be a moderate level of carbonation based on the amount of bubbles rising to the surface. S: There's a gentle aroma of chocolate with some notes of roasted malts. T: The taste is both creamy and somewhat sweet and filled with flavors of milk chocolate. There are also some hints of roasted malts. The finish is slightly bitter. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied, smooth and a bit thin on the palate; the finish feels somewhat dry. D: It's very easy to drink and goes down very smoothly; this is definitely a sessionable beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Jesstyr,3.5,"Got my hands on a pint of this at Ginger Man in South Norwalk where it was recently put on tap.  Overall I found this beer good, but not great - not quite up to the reputation that I expected from the reviews here. Appearance was what you would expect - deep dark chocolate, but there was a too much foamy head, that disappeared, but didn't balance well. Nose was primarily coffee, with a hint of chocolate.  Generally this brew shows the chocolate taste, but it reminds me more of a coffee stout. Didn't really get the sweetness you'd expect with the style - instead it was exceptionally dry, and not particularly flavorful. Body was thick and meaty, but dry, and that made this one a tough one to enjoy much of.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ovaltine,4.37,"App: Looks like a stout.  Sm: Smells like a stout - and a great cup of hot chocolate. I offered my sample to the guys that were with me. They fought over it.  Ta: You smell the cocoa, the taste doesn't carry quite the same punch, but it's still very good.  MF: Like a stout - soft, rounded edges.  Da: This was my 3rd beverage after a Founders Dry-Hopped Pale Ale and a Founders Double Trouble DIPA. It fit perfectly at the end of that little session, and would be great with a stogie and a campfire.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,jimhonnaker,5,"The still, deserted night of an Appalachian night that bleeds warm, wet Carolina clay at the edges of the glass. The head is considerable, but not as creamy as you would think. It sticks around for a bit. The smell is of cocoa, pure and simple. At times, the scent of dark cherry or plumb pokes in for a visit, but it's most likely the imagination. It hits the mouth with a cheery lightness and burst of milk chocolate that dissolves into bubbly roasted-malt bitterness. The finish is of dry, dark chocolate.  For me, drinking beer is about an experience. This is what most art is about. There is no more delightful experience than a glass of Young's Double Chocolate. Sitting quietly and sipping it brings peaceful and wise thought patterns to the surface. Its pleasant texture is soothing in an almost spiritual way. It is a robust, sensual and soulfully satisfying experience.  Consumed from a tulipesque Aventinus man-glass.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Head remains to the bottom of the glass, lots of lacing too.  S: chocolatey, cocoa, malty  T: excellent! Although excited about this, I was unsure of the chocolate + beer combination, but all my fears were assuaged! This is an amazingly satisfying beer. More sweet than bitter, including just a hint of cherry, but a subtle bitterness in the finish.  M: very smooth, moderate to heavy body.  D: amazing beer!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,feelmefoam,3.37,"Pours a beautiful dark chocolate color that doesn't allow any light to shine through. Because it was in a nitro-can, the tan head is about an inch high with beautiful cascades of foam running up and down the inside of the glass. Decent lacing, this is really nice to just sit back and watch for a minute.  The smell isn't as great as I had hoped; right off the bat I get whiffs of chocolate milk and some slight roasted malts, but it's not nearly as strong as I'd like it to be.  The flavor, while good, needs to be a bit more assertive as well. A sweet, chocolate milk base with roasted malt and some chocolate covered coffee beans for a bittersweet taste. Still, I didn't feel as if it was as flavorful as it could've been. I've definitely had better chocolate stouts.  The mouthfeel is the worst part, for me. I like the look that comes from the nitro-can, but I really can't deal with the oily slick feel that comes from a beer with almost no carbonation in it. Maybe if it was a bit thicker and more flavorful, but it's not.  The drinkability takes a bit of a hit from the mouthfeel and slightly weak flavors, but it could definitely be good if it picked it up in those two areas. I think I'm going to have to give Young's another shot, but in the bottle next time. It's a looker as a nitro, but I don't care much for the mouthfeel.

Regardless of how you pour, you will get a thick, creamy, tan, two finger head. Then you get the fun of watching the rolling waves of the head roll back and dissolve into the beer. Comparable to irish stouts such as Guinness and Murphy's.  S - Makes your mouth water! Bitter sweet and milk chocolate mixed with a slightly more subtle roasted coffee.  T - Like sweet, sweet chocolate! The milk chocolate taste is instant, followed by the taste of the roasted coffee beans, malted barley, and a hint of oats.  M - Not as thick as you would expect, but definitely not thin by any means. Very little carbonation.  D - This is the perfect dessert beer, that's about all I can say. A perfect finish to a nice dinner. Delicious!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Musition12,3.4,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Purchased from my local Whole Foods.  A: Very dark brown with a respectable 2-finger tan head. Good lacing.  S: Aroma consists of both bitter and milk chocolate with some coffee beans. Alcohol noticeable.  T: Milk chocolate is the stand-out flavor at the outset, but as the beer reaches room temperature, the chocolate gradually becomes quite bitter. Roasted coffee and vanilla extract support this chocolate-centric brew and there's also some piquant alcohol present at the back of the tongue.  M: This is where the beer left me pretty disappointed. The body is unfortunately very thin, so while the dark, rich tastes are indeed pleasant, the mouthfeel doesn't give them any chance to cohere and leave a lasting impression on the palate. Also, the alcohol is too warming, heating up my throat long after I finished. In the end, not too enjoyable.  D: Goes down easy, but mainly due to the watery body. I would rather reach for a SN Stout or Rogue Chocolate Stout as a sessionable stout before this one. I'm just yearning for a little more ""oomph"".  For how light it is in alcohol, Young's Double Chocolate Stout had the potential to be a new stand-by stout.

A head quickly forms at the end of microscopic bubbles that cascade down the sides of the glass and the lacing in out of this world, it completely coats the glass. I can't tell what the aeration of the beer is, its too dark the bubbles are too small, but the head retention is great, there until the end.  Aroma is overall weak, but I can smell mostly chocolate. Its more chocolaty than I remember, smells good.  Beer is smooth and medium to full bodied. The flavor is primarily sweet with tons of chocolate. Its not as bitter as you'd expect a chocolate beer to be. It finishes cleanly and drinkability is high. I expect some roast from my stouts or some bitter from the grains or in this case the chocolate. I know this is a sweet stout and they achieved the sweet for sure. I really enjoyed this beer and I would recommend it to everyone.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MbpBugeye,4.6,"This is one of my first stouts I tried a while ago. Its time for a revisit.  A- You cant beat the look of a nitro'd stout. Crack the can and you get a crazy, sci-fi sounding hiss and a gurgle. Pours out looking like chocolate milk. Super cool cascading effect at the nitrogen pushes air out of the way. The head settles into a super super dense cream that sits about two fingers high. It leaves not what you would call lacing, its more of a thick coating on the inside of my big ol' Guinness pint. The beer is black but its actually quite clear. Plenty of red highlights showing through.  S- Yeah I think that intense cream of a head blocks some of the aroma, but I cant prove it. You still get lots of chocolate syrup on the nose, and I mean LOTS. Also some vanilla, malted milk chocolate, and light roasted malts.  T- Chocolate-y for sure. Its not the most intense chocolate flavored beer Ive had (Choklat might hold that title), but it is a great beer. Dry powdery cocoa and chocolate syrup. There is also a milk sugar sweetness mixed with a light roasted flavor. This beer is as close to a milkshake as you can get.  M- The beer itself is actually quite thin. The nitro makes it feel very creamy though. It leaves no prickliness or biting carbonation at all. This beer is semi dry and finishes very very clean. Probably the cleanest stouts Ive ever had.  D- SO SO SOOO drinkable. Its not like a beer. Lighter body so its not heavy on the gut, nitrogenated so its not all bubbly and filling, low ABV so it doesnt make you drunk, sweet but not too sweet and finishes clean so you end up drinking faster than you meant to.

664,73,ThreeWiseMen,4.01,"Poured into a Guinness imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Nitro-infused beers are so fun to watch. Cascading layers of carbonation create a tumultuous-looking body at first, but after thirty seconds or so a 3/4 inch layer of dense tan foam sits atop a calm brown-black body. Beautiful. Only a sliver of light shines through the bottom edge of the body; otherwise, it's opaque. Head retention is fantastic, and the lacing is thick and notch-like.  Smell: Chocolate malt and cocoa come out first. As it warms, red currants and caramel emerge. Lots of bread-like aromas in there too. Not overpowering or surprising, but solid.  Taste: Chocolate and roasted malts upfront, caramel in the back. Very mild, flowery hops come in to clean up the finish. The chocolate flavors aren't as powerful as one might think, but they are predominant. Nicely balanced and very smooth.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy - loaded with soft, nitrogen bubbles. The head is really foamy and nice. The body could be a bit heavier though. Pretty clean. Easy.  Drinkability: Young's Double Chocolate is very drinkable, especially from the nitro-can.

Smell was mainly heavy roasted malts and chocolate a slight sweetness as well.  Taste is simply awesome. As stated above roasted malts and chocolate. A beautiful creaminess kicks in that really bring's out the milky chocolate taste in this beer.  Mouth is probably the smoothest stout I have ever tasted. So silky so smooth and so full bodied.

Rich, creamy and a mix of sweet and chocolate bitterness.  T - A lot of bittersweet and milk chocolate flavors. The beginning is sweet, and then it gives way to a more bitter chocolate. There is also very minimal hop taste giving a miniscule earthy hop bitterness. Hints of espresso and licorice also are present.  M - On the lighter side of medium body. Decent carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy, but just a touch watery.  D - Good drinkability. Smooth and creamy and a lot of chocolate flavors but not overly sweet or bitter. Drinkability probably relies a good amount of how much you like chocolate.  Notes: Very nice beer that combines the bitterness and sweetness of chocolate well.

664,73,Chadpaq,4.27,"Scooped a bottle of this from my local Harris Teeter. They always come through with some sweet brews.  Starting things off: Appearance. Well, it looks appetizing enough, and true to its name. Looks to be the Chocolatey sort, perhaps twice as chocolatey as your typical chocolate item! Hence, the ""double"" in the name. Looks? Check, and I'm ready to consume.  But first, give it a couple whiffs. After all, smell is 20 percent of the equation! Smells like the darkest of chocolate bars. Perhaps a high-grade hot chocolate mix. Godiva ring any bells? Additional hints of coffee and licorice round it out, and is that a hint of fruit at the end???  Ah, the taste. The TASTE. Delicious. I love chocolate, and this beer certainly doesn't disappoint. Tastes like it smells: Chocolatey goodness.  But the mouthfeel. Lacking a bit in this department.

The smell is lots of chocolate, obviously... But there's also some dark fruits, possibly dried dark fruits. I also get hints of hazel nuts. It actually smells a bit like a Swedish Christmas.  The taste is also lots of chocolate, but a dryer tone than in the smell. The dark fruits is still there aswell, but all in all it's a lot thinner taste than I was expecting. The aftertaste is dry and coffee beans become dominant.  The mouthfeel is very enjoyable. It's oily and low carbonated with a smooth feeling to it.  Unfortunatly I didn't get much from this beer.

Aroma is mild sweet with some hints of roasted, some milk chocolate.  Taste is sweetish first, reminds of creamy milk chocolate with burnt flavours, slowly drying, even chalky finish and long lasting aftertaste full of the most bitter chocolate.

S- The smell is sweet, definitely picking up on some dairy. Milk chocolate mainly, not really picking up much bitterness or roastiness.  T- The flavors are mild but very enjoyable. Milk chocolate and some mild bitterness in the finish. Lots of chocolate and Cocoa carry through in the aftertaste.  M- This is probably the lightest body I've had in a stout, but it doesn't hurt it at all IMO. This is silky smooth.  D- This one just kept on getting better with the more I drank.

Smell: Even as I pour I get a wonderful chocolate aroma coming from the beer. On closer inspection, fairly dark chocolate, vanilla pods, freshly roasted coffee beans and roasted malt. As the beer warmed the smells become more pronounced and creaminess is added.  Taste: Again dark, high cocoa % chocolate, roasted malts and roasted coffee beans that leave a lasting bitter note.  Mouthfeel: I find the beer a tad (and I do mean only a tad...) light, I prefer my stouts to be heavy rather than medium. The carbonation is moderate, smooth and very pleasant.

The foam lingered for a bit and then faded down to a small cap of foam. Little bits of lace noted throughout. The aroma was mild powdered cocoa and a hint of roasted barley. There was a chocolatey sweetness throughout. The taste is that of a nice dry stout, minimal roastiness, with a nice, mildly sweet chocolate middle and a bitter chocolate finish. The beer had medium carbonation and felt a little thin. This is probably the weakest aspect of this bottled version. This is a wonderful treat of a beer nonetheless.

664,73,Arenbeer,3.86,550ml bottle into snifter glass  A- Poured like a guinness. Dark brown/black body with a fluffy light brown 2 finger head that wouldn't quit. Took up most of the glass in the pour and it stayed that way throughout leaving insane amount of lacing as it went down. LLAB  S- Kind of dissapointed not to much going on with this one as expected. One I could get through the head the smell didn't really increase any. Average stout aroma of roasted malts with a sweet light chocolate backround. Thought it would smell like chocolate milk but had more of a burnt bitter stout smell to it.  T- Once again average bitter stout with a slight sweet chocolate finish. Not to complex and not as much chocolate as expected. Even when it warms up alot the bitterness comes out more than the chocolate does which kind of dissapointed me. But definitely something different and worth trying.  M- Got to say the mouthfeel was pretty decent however. Solid body with lower carbonation combined with the fluffy head make this brew insanely easy to drink. It's almost as though someone brewed a regular stout then put a scoop of chocolate ice cream in it to make it more drinkable. A Chocolate Stout Float perhaps.

664,73,ShinerStArnoldTX,3.94,"I picked this up at Planet Liquor in Baytown, Texas. A small amount of dust had started to accumulate on the bottle, I wish I could have rescued the rest of them. Luckily, the brew still tasted pretty damn good.  Appearance was black, dark amber if you put a light through it. Head was a brown-tan color and very puffy; it dissipated relatively quickly but left lacing from top to bottom.  Aroma was pretty light but pleasing nonetheless. Obviously lots of chocolate notes, but also some bitter hops and alcohol. The taste was very much the same, but with more of the hops bitterness. My palate is not developed enough to identify the hops or even describe the quality, but there's a hint of bitterness upfront, then a flash of stronger bitterness, with a chocolatey finish. Not much is left of the taste afterwords, just faint chocolate.  The mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly chalky, which I liked. Medium bodied, much lighter than I expected, but in a chocolatey beer like this, I think the high drinkability is genius.  Notes: beer may have been somewhat past its freshness, also, the taste changed a lot with temperature. The colder it was, the more chocolate I could taste (I had it in a glass as I took notes and drank what as left out of the bottle later, it was more chilled then).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,deleted_user_345250,3.35,"I need to preface this by saying that Young's is one of *the* transformative beers in my drinking history. Twice (Bier Markt in Toronto, Ginger Man in Dallas) I've had the draught version and twice I've been staggered by its rich and flavorful uniqueness. Unfortunately, the bottled version just doesn't stack up.  Bottle pours a chestnut-black, nearly opaque and topped by a small still head the color of the filling in a Three Musketeers bar. The head halves quickly and leaves wispy lacing as you drink.  Held to the standard of the draught version, the smell barely registers. Certainly not the overwhelming aroma of hot chocolate that I remember. Instead, I get a bit of coffee, a bit of red wine and some bitter cocoa only after significant warming and re-agitation.  Taste-wise, again, nothing compared to the draught version. Rather than the rich and velvety milk chocolate flood I remember, there's a comparatively meek thread of bitter baker's chocolate among an otherwise unspectacular stout. Again, there's a little more cocoa present after warming and re-agitation, but nothing unique.  None of the thick, coating mouthfeel here and ultimately, without its massive milk chocolate backbone, this becomes just another stout.  Fairly disappointed, though I will remain a devotee of the draught.

The smell is phenomenal right before the beer hits the palate though.  T: The taste is obviously strong on chocolate, especially in the aftertaste/finish; however, unfortunately the finish is a little funky tasting. The beer is a little more watery than I expected, or at least it isn't as full as I had hoped it would be.

Taste: Burnt chocolate, roasted grain, some sweetness. Bitter twang of hops. Goes down smooth. Honestly, it was a bit of a letdown given the intense chocolaty smell, to be greeted with a taste that had more in common with burnt coffee that cocoa.

664,73,UWagner,4,"A: Poured from the can in a milky brown stream, appearing as if I poured a can of Frappuchino into a pint glass. Over the course of a minute the milky nitro bubbles rose to the surface, leaving an opaque brown ale topped with a thin but dense, tan head that has persisted for the last 15 minutes. The head trailed thickly down the side, taking about 15 minutes to dissipate into spots resembling those of a leopard.  S: Chocolate, more chocolate, and then coffee. That's it. No complexity here.  T: Heavy chocolate flavors, which gave way (somewhat) to subtle coffee flavors. In other words, it was like drinking a moka frango, but translated into a sweet stout.  M: Very thin, despite the bold flavors. Kind of a letdown at this point.  D: Slightly chilled, this stout is a bit more drinkable than at room temperature. Not to say that it isn't drinkable at room temperature; it certainly is. Chocolate lovers, however, will find that the alcohol flavor is nonexistent if it is chilled, and that the chocolate flavors are enhanced. The light mouthfeel may be a plus for some chocolate fans who are more concerned about the rich chocolatey taste. The light mouthfeel makes this an easily drinkable, chocolatey ale.

A pillow like foam was seen forming in the glass, I quickly poured this with vigor the correct way with the can sticking inside the glass. Once that was done a cascading brown foam hurricane formed eventually leaving a perfect tan head on top. Excellent notches of lacing.  Very chocolate rich up front with roasted malts following. The chocolate is a bit bittersweet and also syrupy rich with sweetness. There is a touch of cream in the distance. The aroma is bold but I CAN tell this is not going to be overkill like a certain chocolate stout brewing company in upstate NY.  If you read above that pretty much is ditto for the taste as well. It pretty much tastes like it smells. Besides the nice smooth rich chocolate the only difference is the malt addition seems to shine a bit more in taste. A very light chocolate milk for adults.  The feel is killer out of the CAN, probably the smoothest stout i've had in awhile. The nitro really does wonders. It has a good less than medium build with just some light watery spots here and there. For 5.2%, the body is amazing. I don't think it CAN get better than this.  Well, I'm sold, this did the trick, a lovely chocolate stout out of England in a CAN. I think I found a contender for a case pick up for the rest of the winter.

664,73,WynnO,5,"Hands down, IMO, the best ""first sip"" on the planet! If heaven has a taste, a first sip from one of the puppies IS IT. Also the best chocolate flavored beer EVER. I have had this on tap at least a dozen times in half a dozen establishments, and it has never let me down.  The nitro can is good too, but CHECK YOUR DATES please; I have found old cans in places where the stock doesn't move, and the taste was not up to par. Personally, I would avoid the bottle though---something gets lost there.  Don't let the ABV fool you---this is not a macho session beer---it's far too rich.  It pours beautifully from the tap (and nitro can), exactly like a Guinness. The resulting head is thick and creamy with a perfect depth. I have sat and pondered this feat several times :-) All I can say is if there was ever a perfectly ""engineered beer"", this would have to be it.  I personally like it at the same temp as a properly tapped Guinness. The richness of the flavor seems to decline with the as the temperature drops. If you pour this from a nitro-can, I recommend allowing it to settle, and then let it sit another couple of minutes. Why? I can't say exactly.

664,73,Kylito87,3.55,This is my first experience with a Chocolate Stout. I have always wanted to try one and I saw this at Arista Foods today for $2.99 so I figured why not. So Heres We Goes.  Appearance- Black with a Big creamy tawny head. Lots of sticky lacing along my glass. Pretty strong in the knees.  Smell- It has very sweet chocolate and toffee notes up front and behind that is some smokey dark chocolate and roasted malt and coffee notes.  Taste- It tastes like a stout! It is definitely not as sweet as I thought it would be. I thought it would be more like an oatmeal stout but this is really balanced. It has a sort of sweet taste up front but not overpowering. Than it gives you this finishing bitterness like dark chocolate. I am not detecting much hop essence here.  Mouthfeel- Almost Viscous more solid bodied than some of the stouts that I drink. Also more carbonation than I would of thought as well. I was expecting a very flat minimaly carbonated beer here. This stuff is like Velvet. Almost chewy and very rich. It has a sticky mouthfeel that dries up nicely  Drinkability- Well this stuff is rich. I mean I finished a 500 ML bottle myself but I don't think I would want much more. This is a very smooth pleasant sipping beer. I think it would pair nicely with a spicy meal of a fine cigar.  Overall- A very eye opening experience. I always thought that sweet stouts and chocolate stouts were kind of girly and prissy beers but this is so good I wouldn't care if someone made fun of me for drinking it. It is so good that my girlfriend (who only drinks Bud-light and Corona light) said it was definitely interesting which means she kind of likes it usually when she tries a beer of mine she makes this face like a kid taking medicine. That is a huge step and I think that I can start weening her into appreciating good beer with more complex concoctions like this she is by nature a whisky and wine girl. This was like I said my first experience with a Chocolate stout and it has made me want to seek out more examples of this style.

That being said its a great beer and I will definately drink it again.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jlb307,4.35,"First review in a looong time. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. I've had this since early September and the bottle has a date of 3/31/10 on it, so it was just right.  Poured pitch black with probably the thickest head I've ever seen on a beer. Tan and creamy and clung to the glass throughout both servings. Loaded with the smell of dark chocolate and oatmeal and some dried fruit notes. Great taste pretty close to the aroma with a long, semi-sweet finish with a touch of brown sugar on it. Very smooth without a trace of alcohol makes this very easy to drink too quickly, but definitely one you want to savor.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,NOOGIE,4.28,"Look: Poured nitro-can into pint glass. Great mixture of the beer in the glass. You get that swirl look to it. Deep black color, and rich creamy head, which takes a long time to dissipate.  Smell: Lots of chocolate. Also nice spicy notes, with lots of malty smells and oats.  Taste: Nothing hidden in this beer, but chocolate. Sort of like a Hersey's Dark Chocolate bar. Good mellow roasted coffee taste.  Mouthfeel: What you want in a chocolate beer! The chocolate stays in your mouth, well after the drink is done.  Drink: Surprisingly smooth, only a hint of bitterness at the end.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kingcrowing,3.7,500ml bottle poured into a tulip.  Pours a very dark brown/black with a super thin light brown head. Nose is very lightly chocolaty with some maltiness.  Taste is very roasty and chocolaty without much bitterness. Not as much chocolate as southern tier choklate but it's still a good beer for what it is.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,qazelisc,4.09,"Pours a dark brown-black with a tan head and nice lacing.  Lots of chocolate in the nose (duh); cocoa shells, cocoa powder, dark bitter chocolate, roasted malt, floral hops maybe under all that chocolate?  Chocolate lovers rejoice. Taste is the same accompanied by slight coffee, vanilla, raisin. Hard to taste the hops, more like a watery Ovaltine than beer, but a nice delicious dark chocolate flavor, more bitter than sweet.  Very smooth but somewhat thin and watery. Not quite stout enough, however, that's probably the intent. A personal preference here for a bit more malt body.  Tons of chocolate, thin body and low alcohol make this too gulpable, like the aforementioned Ovaltine. My 3-year son would love this.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BillyBoysPie,4.12,"On tap at Sergio's World Beers in Louisville.  In a pint glass, black with ruby notes and a dense cloud of pale tan head. Lots of retention and lacing.  Smells, as advertised, like chocolate. Some malt presence, but mostly the chocolate variety - logically.  Milk chocolate flavors and some depth. No coffee or the like, just sweet, milk chocolate. It's a bit like a milkshake. Not in a bad way, just factually.  The low carbonation is nice for the density of the beer. Not overly sweet, but a velvety drink.  It's a fine beer, but not one I'd be having unless I had the crave.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,afausser,2.68,"A: pours an almost black dark chocolate with a finger or so of fizzy tan head (with both decent lacing and retention). Looks decent, but not too impressive for the low ABV.  S: Very metallic and slight roasted malt. Also a bit milky and doesn't really smell much like beer.  T: Again, metallic. Creamy, but very slight chocolate--not at all what I would have expected. I'd honestly rather have had chocolate milk.  M: Smooth and light, but a bit oily and thin-bodied. Not sure that the body works very well with the style.  D: Not very drinkable at all. Had with lunch (so I should have been thirsty, right?) and almost left half the glass on the table. I thought I'd try this one though it hadn't jumped out at me to buy in the store, and I guess my initial instincts had been correct. I'd heard that this one was supposed to be decent, too. I wonder what went wrong.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Minotaur,5,"This is my first 5x5 star rating. This rating is based on Young's Double Chocolate on tap at Ship Inn, Milford NJ. There was simply nothing more I could have wanted from a stout.  Instead of elaborating on the excruciating details I will state how this was exceptional even compared to the bottled version.  There was a finger and a half dough-colored lacing that sat atop a full pint of pure black. The lacing sustained through out the entire draft.  The aroma was licorice, deep bitter chocolate, grainy malt and a bit of earthy floral aroma. Notes of cavendish tobacco.  The flavor was dry and smooth compared to other stouts. Dark, hints of deep cocoa and earthy licorice. Some vanilla and a bit of toasted flavor came through.  Thick, bready mouthfeel. Smooth, endlessly drinkable. Nothing else I could want from a stout. Simply the best stout I've had and superior on tap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WhiteOak,3.75,"A- Dark brown/black. Big expansive dark head.  S- Mouthwatering aromas of fresh cocoa powder, bakers chocolate, and chocolate covered raisins soar from the glass.  T- Chocolate biscuits, beautiful roasty (but not charred) malt. Chocolate covered almonds. Very pleasant long lingering cocoa finish.  The weight of malt and level of dryness here has been well-configured, with richness without sweetness.  Nitro-can, to me, provides a different texture & mouthfeel, but from bottle or can, the Double Chocolate is good stuff to satisfy a combined beer & chocolate craving.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Jeebs,4.17,"A: Pours a very dark brown with a large 2 finger tan head. Lacing is decent, but less than expected.  S: Chocolate dominates the smell, I'm not getting much else from it.  T: Tastes of dark chocolate and malt with a hint of coffee.  M: Medium bodied with a creamy smooth mouthfeel.  D: Nice smell and flavor with a creamy finish leads to good drinkability. It's not a beer I would drink every day, but good none the less.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Ottertude,4.03,"The stout poured an inky black into my glass with the usual nitro bubble cascade show. Looked really good with a small tan head that left nice lacing.  It smelled of dark chocolate, cocoa, and a touch of coffee. Tasted of roasted grains, chocolate and coffee. Pretty much like the aroma. If these are flavors you enjoy you will dig this stout.  A thin but creamy mouthfeel makes for an easy drinking experience as this pint disappeared in a hurry. This stout is a good choice on a cold winters night.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,brewerburgundy,2.89,"Best Before 10 March 2010 printed on the bottom of the can.  Purple-brown, very dark, the only light coming from the bottom dip of the wine glass I'm drinking it from. Poured out a mix of foam and beer. Head is knit like 600 thread count sheets and perfect stout tan/khaki/beige. I'm close to scoring this a 5 for looks. Wall-like lacing.  Milk chocolate, malted milk balls, chocolate soft serve. Plain old Hershey's milk chocolate. Plum. It does one-dimension well.  Very much the taste of the nose with hints of fusel alcohol even at pretty cool temps. Falls towards the chocolate soft serve, which I don't fancy. the can, as I know it's fresh and free of tap line contamination, has more flavor than my experience with this on tap. If a soft serve vanilla beer showed up I'd be game.  No carb prickle whatsoever. Essence of smooth, beating out Black Butte Porter and Firestone Walker DBA, two that set new standards of smoothness in mouthfeel for me recently. Creamy. Can tend towards chalky.  I just don't think this is an excellent brew (deserving of an A). I can't bring myself to. A for average in my notebook.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JustinJTisdale,4.04,"Poured with absolutely no head. Smell reminds me of roasting coffee beans and dark chocolate. A little too ""chocolatey"" (if thats a word). Smooth rounded finish with the same chocolate espresso highlights as the smell.  I would probably drink it again but based entirely on the price and convenience in getting it. Overall a decent stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,steve8robin,3.32,"Got this one as a Christmas gift...  A: Black with hints of ruby highlights with little to no head.  S: Very heavy chocolate. Not much else going on. Smells good.  T: Eh, very watery with hints of chocolate flavor. Kind of 1 dimensional in taste.  M: Heavy carbonation leaving no sticky flavor. Not good enough to be called a stout.  T: Goes down perfectly easy, but for some of the wrong reasons.  All in all, this is a great crossover brew. If you are trying to convert from a mainstream beer like Bud, this might be a good choice. If you currently enjoy craft brews, then I would not recommend.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,sudsellier,4.15,"Poured on-tap with 100% nitrogen delivery.  A: Filled the pint glass with midnight capped with a creamy, albeit thinnish, head. Lattice stayed the entire glass, though.  S: Chocolatey-roasty-malty-sweet. Like walking into a confectioner's shop.  T: Silky milky chocolate. All this flavor simply by roasting the grains and not by adding chocolate like some American brewers do. Excellent. Slight notes of sweet smoke and creme brulee (why do have that as a descriptor in two reviews now?).  M: Oh, man. Using pure nitrogen makes this one slippery little devil. This is sex in a glass. Honestly, I've never ever had a beer this super-smooth. Check that... not smooth, but smoov. This beer is Rudy Ray Moore-Superfly.  D: Yes. And lots of it.

[Aroma] - Malty sweetness that is usually more present in the porter style. Roast malt is downplayed next to the sweetness. Hints of dark chocolate follow the malt before a slightly metallic finish.  [Taste] - A short burst of biscuity breadiness with malty sweetness followed by faint notes of roast malt and dark chocolate. Finish is slightly metallic.  [Mouthfeel] - Thin and watery upfront followed by a short period of creaminess. Finiishes slightly thin. Carbonation is medium-low.  [Drinkability] - Very drinkable due to the thinner mouthfeel. This is however, a turn-off for the stout style. A slightly bland chocolate stout. Sounds english to me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,magine,4.5,"Poured into a mug.  Pours a dark brown color with a tan big chunky head. Head settles to a lace island and leaves nice lace.  Brew smells of dark chocolate, slight roasted malts.  Brew is very smooth, with a dry finish. Has huge chocolate flavor. Roasted malts are present in the aftertaste. A thin not heavy mouthfeel. Very good tasting brew.  This brew is almost like a dessert in a glass; awesome chocolate flavor. This brew is a top notch brew. Maybe the best of its style I have had.

Ends off with bitter/roasted flavours for a nice finish.  M: Medium-light bodied and medium carbonation. Leaves a slightly bitter and sweet feeling in the mouth. This is to thin for my liking, but it's just my preference.  D: I don't there is anything exceptional about these beer, but it is well made. Price point is also good.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Josievan,4.23,"Appearance: Liquified fizzy chocolate! Deep brown with a dark massive head.  Smell: Chocolate malts, but it's not an overly strong aroma.  Taste: The wide range of chocolate taste in this beer is impressive. It starts off with the sweeter milk chocolate then shifts into the more bitter dark chocolate on the finish. This leaves a pleasant slightly bitter aftertaste. The taste is very authentic; you can tell the chocolate flavor comes largely from the malt itself.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and rich, just what the doctor ordered for this style.  Drinkability: This beer could have ended up too sweet to be very drinkable, but that's not the case. It's an easy-drinking milk stout.  Notes: A superb beer because of it's chocolate qualities, but also a great beer simply for its genuine and well-done stout characteristics. It's a fine dessert beer, to be sure, but don't relegate it to that purpose alone. Think of it too when you just want a good stout, chocolate or not.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,cassanoj,4.16,"I'll preface this review by saying that this is the only beer I've ever found to taste better out of a can than a bottle.  Poured into a pint glass. Black, smooth and creamy. Frothy mocha head. Looks like a chocolate cloud.  Smells like um, chocolate! Also, some citrus and some roasted grain.  Taste is of chocolate and malt. Incredibly smooth. The head does a lot for this beer. Adds so much creaminess to the beer. There's a nice bitterness to this beer, too. I am impressed.  Mouthfeel is good when the head is present. Smooth with the right touch of bitterness. When the head dissipates, this beer becomes a bit thin for me.  Overall, rather impressed with this humble brew. Had it two times from the bottle and wasn't impressed. From the nitro-can, I let it warm up a bit and the beer really came through for me.

Thin tan head that settles rapidly. Perhaps a stronger pour would pump this baby up.  S-Strong chocolate notes, but seems a bit unnatural. Sweet malts.  T-A processed bitter chocolate taste begins the journey, backed by bittersweet malts and a slight hop bite on the back end. Not creamy, not sweet, not savory...pretty bland and one-dimensional.  M-Decent overall mouthfeel with balanced carbonation and a medium feel.  D-Not at all. A huge letdown, and I just don't see what the fuss is about. Been drinking a lot of great stouts this week, and I was really looking forward to this. Bummer, as it is widely available and nice and cheap.  Artificial tasting, lame, and unappealing. Not a horrible drainpour, but, at least based on BA ratings, way overrated. Read a blog on the net recently where Raspy Anniversary Stout was compared to this.

664,73,icetraxx,3.28,"[Review from memory] A: The nitro-can poured into a beautiful cascading waterfall in my Guinness tulip glass. As black as the night. Two/three finger head, this beer produces a virtually perfect appearance for the style.  S: Smells like roasted malt, some caramel and chocolate in there as well.  T: Overly roasted, even carbonized, burnt flavor detracts from the subtleties the same way a beautiful cut of meat can be ruined by burning it. Chocolate and a scotch whisky like peat flavors are noticeable. The delicious flavors of the Maillard reaction have been reduced to a carbonized-blackened flavor. I am assuming the brewer intended the ""blackened"" flavor. Some may like this carbonized flavor the same way they may like blackened food, I don't. Hop bitterness is moderate, most of the bitterness comes from the over roasting.  M: Largely like a thicker Guinness. The nitro-can gives lots of body.  D: I can drink one and then want something else. Too much burnt malt for my liking.  O: A beautiful beer that was ruined by overly strong carbon flavors which mask any of the desirable flavors of the Maillard reaction. I love this style and can see why some love this beer, but the carbonized flavor makes this a deal breaker for me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,goldbot,4.1,"A: This beer pours a dark, opaque black with a thick, frothy chocolate milk colored head. Moderate lacing and head retention.  S: Loads of dark chocolate on the nose with some coffee notes (the same coffee notes you would expect from a good dark chocolate).  T: Just more dark chocolate and coffee, without much of the bitterness you find in richer dark chocolates or coffees. No hop presence that I could detect.  M: Slightly watery, but just barely. Light body and carbonation. A very rich and creamy feel.  D: Too good. Like light, fluffy, rich chocolate cake. You know you shouldn't, but it's so easy to have too much.  This is a delicious beer. This is what I would call the epitome of a ""dessert"" beer. That is, a beer you have FOR dessert, not with it. It's only downfall is the lack of complexity, relying instead on sweetness to satisfy.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

After a very aggressive pour there is about two fingers of head that leave a heavy amount of lacing. The smell is incredibly sweet, like smelling a pot of choclate. The taste istself is much more mild. Not nearly as much choclate taste. Still sweet though, but with more of a raoasted malt aftertaste. OMG the lacing around the head is ridiculous, it looks like spackle around the edge of my glass. It's very thick to drink, but also very smooth and dare I say, milk-like.  It's a very reasonably priced bomber $2.99, and I enjoyed drinking it, but it's not my personal preference.

This is a great example of a milk stout, the chocolate seems to be more of an afterthought in the taste.  M/D - The mouthfeel is quite thick and rich coating the mouth and tongue.

Smell: Smells strongly of bittersweet chocolates with hints of espresso and roasted malts.  Taste: Starts slightly bitter but finishes with strong chocolate, coffee, and roasted flavors. This is one of the chocolatiest beers I've ever had. However, I have this sinking feeling that the nitro is dulling this flavor out.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, and smooth.

Its a well balanced stout with little to no hops present and plenty of roasted flavors. The high chocolate content follows the intital roasty flavors and finishes like a good coffee / Swiss chocolate combo.  M - Great. Again this was a nitro pour and that helped to make it real smooth. I thought it got a little swishy towards the end, but overall a solid mouthfeel.  D - Pretty high. I'd have this again for sure.

Taste is of acidic roasted malts, dark chocolate, and espresso. Decent depth, but nothing mind-blowing. I feel like the nitro is dulling the flavours.  Mouthfeel is a little drier than expected. I was expecting something pretty heavy a la Milk Stout, however the creamy-ness from the nitro makes it slip along smoothly.  D- Very drinkable, not thoroughly enjoyable though. I was expecting a little more ""umph"" in the flavour department--whether that's due to the nitro, or just the beer I am unsure.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,NYCWheatFanSC,2.33,"I was really let down by this brew - and I didn't even have any, let alone high, expectations going in. Poured well with a solid, yet quickly receding head. Smells like burnt nesquick. Tastes like chemical chocolate powder in water. WAY to thin of a body for the style. Overall, it seems like they went for some chocolate powder flavoring instead of properly malting a beer of this style. Would not return to again, especially at $6 for a bottle - I could have had 3 Victory Storm Kings for that!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tofulegend,3.33,"appearence - brownish creamy head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Deep brown color. smell - a lot of chocolate and dark malts. I also think im picking up some hints of mint. taste - again, a lot of chocolate and roasted malt. more sweetness than body. aftertaste is slightly bitter but overall a bit short on hops in my opinion. Chocolate feels a bit artificial. mouthfeel - really could use a bit more body. if it wasn't for the roasted flavors I would say that it feels more like a dark lager than a stout. drinkability - the sweetness of this beer would probably put me off after a few ones.  Overall - Nice brew but I could really use some more body here. Also, more chocolate malt and less chocolate flavoring would be nice. IMO Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a way better chocolate stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Cresant,3.54,"This came from a 14.9 oz. nitro can into a Guinness tulip. Dated 07 Mar 09. The pour created a creamy upwardly cascading head of fine foam. The huge tan head receded but a solid cap remained throughout. The body was clear of sediment and very dark brown.  Smell was roasted grains and chocolate.  Taste was chocolate but not too sweet. Light milk chocolate, not bittersweet. Lightly of caramel. Not complex but very tasty. Not overdone, very drinkable.  Mouthfeel was creamy but somewhat thin. I will return to this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,rootbeerman,4.23,"Poured from can into pint glass.  A: Pours very dark brown almost black, similar in appearance to Guinness. Finger thick light brown creamy, long lasting head. gives a nice beer mustache S: sweet malts, along with heavy chocolate sweetness.

664,73,JohnnyBarman,4.4,"Pours a very deep black, leaves a one inch thick tan head that sticks around as a thin layer throughout the sample. Lots of lacing.  The smell is terrific, milk chocolate, caramel, malts and light coffee. Very enticing.  The taste is even better. Truly terrific stuff. The chocolate doesn't dominate this beer; it enhances it, works with the other subtle flavours to produce a satisfying finish. Shaved dark chocolate, a bit of caramel, coffee and malts. Sweet, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, carbonation is a little more than I'd expected, but I tend to like slightly higher carbonated stouts anyway, so this was a big plus. No chalkiness to speak of. Not overly dry.  Just a terrific beer, one I will get again and again. Although I was worried that the beer would simply taste like chocolate, I was most happily corrected! A real winner (the only drawback being that I doubt I could drink this brew for too often at a time)",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Vinny71,4.62,"A- Jet black with a beautiful tan light cocoa head that fades to about one finger. I was expecting a denser and thicker head for this style.  S- Chocolate and mocha with roasted malts.  T- Absolutely supreme! Sweet chocolate then a hint of of coffee ending in a bitter sweet finish  M- Wonderful. Creamy and satisfying.  D- My favorite stout. Very rich but not too heavy. One or two of these is plenty, even as good as it is because of the richness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Nice roasted coffee aroma then some roasted barley. The chocolate aroma is very dry and complements very well.  T- First its a traditional stout with the right amount of roasted character with plenty of roasted barley. The chocolate is a sweet flavor like Hershey's syrup. Like a piece of chocolate decadence cake. Then a dry coco finish. Lots of sweet malt in the backbone  M- This is a full bodied beer by feel not by weight. Good amount of carbonation. Nice chocolate finish.  O- This is a good standby chocolate beer. Wonderful for a chocolate craving.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,natelocc787,3.9,"Poured darkest of brown, like one shade from black. There is a lot of chocolate in the nose. It's a very milky, cocoa chocolate. The taste is supreme, nice chewy mouthfeel with little bubbles. Very silky texture. Fudge in the taste with cocoa nibs, Swiss mocha and Hershey's milk chocolate. Very drinkable as a beer but the sweetness and overall character make this a 1 bottle at a time type brew. Not the kind of beer you would want to drink 2 or 3 of, still very drinkable for the style though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ArrogantDeadGuy,4.14,"A brilliant coffee cascade and the brew carbonates. The chocolaty head caps a nice black brew and sticks to the top of the beer 'til the end. The aromas are really quite absent, which is surprising given the representation of flavors. The bitter chocolate notes are married well with coffee, toasted nuts, and mild malts. The coffee aftertaste is very pleasant. This offering is a nice comforting winter choice that is not too heavy for the style and is overall a very good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mosley1212,4.37,"One of my favorites, wanted to buy one so I could review it.  A - Pours a jet black, very opaque, with a small, tan head that goes away quickly.  S - Smells delicious. Very rich with a dark chocolate smell. Can also get a bit of malted hops smell underneath it.  T - The chocolate explodes in your mouth with each sip. After the sweetness of the chocolate dies down, the bitterness of the dark chocolate kicks in and stays with you.  M - Produces a very warm feeling in the mouth, it is one of the best tastes around.  D - A bit too sweet for me to have many. I love this beer, but only in small quantities.  If you haven't tried it, try it!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ZorPrime,4.38,"Thanks to Bobsy for sending me one bottle of this. I was dying to taste this one. Finally!  A: Dark black with some red notes on the edge. The head is creamy with some big bubbles. The head is beige. S: The smell is very intense dark chocolate with light notes of roasted malts. T: Dark chocolate first, then I get the dark chocolate bitterness. So nice. The taste stays in the mouth for a long time... I like it. I don't get very much any hops or roasted malts. M: The beer is creamy feeling in the mouth with the presence of some carbonation... Less carbonation would make this one perfect! D: I could drink this all night! So good.  Cheers!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Onenote81,3.36,"Bottle poured into my mug. Pours a dark black with a big frothy tan head on top. Great retention. Leaves some nice sticky webbing on the glass. Smells of cream, vanilla, milk chocolate, and roasted malts.  The mouth is thin and wet. I expected this to be a bit thicker. Carbonation level is moderate. Flavors of chocolate milk, vanilla, white bread, and a bit of nutty finish. This is pretty good and unoffensive. Not a bad beer to help convert some to darker brews. Chocolate not as predominate as I thought. I'd have it again, but it's not as great as I assumed.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,curasowa,3.8,"This beer is a great looking pour. Dark, dark brown in color with 1 finger of creamy head that hangs around all day. Smells very sweet and creamy, like a milkshake, with subtle hints of roasted malt and malted milk balls. The taste is initially sweet and creamy before fading into a slightly bitter, roasted finish that is slightly lingering. Body and balance are good, although the sweetness boarders on excessive and hurts the drinkability a bit. Other than than minor complaint, this is a very tasty beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,taxguyjase,4.03,"I got two versions of the beer - the bomber that was carbonated and the can which contained the nitrous pill.  The color of the brew was a nice pitch black dark color, with a toasted tan creamy head that sticks around for the party that will be coming to your mouth. You could definitely smell the chocolate, but not doublely so. There were some good roasted coffee notes too. Upon getting around to actually taste the beer, the coffee flavor was far more pronounced than the chocolate was, which is fine, just a bit odd when it's a ""double chocolate"" stout. You'll get some toffee flavor in there as well. The beer was very smooth with little aftertaste. The nitrous version was far more smooth and also less filling (the joy of nitrous), so you feel like you could polish off the four pack of cans in one sitting. Either way, this isn't a heavy beer - don't expect to feel like you just drank a loaf of bread. I would surely get this beer again. Just a note, I found this at Kelly's for $10 a 4 pack of nitrous cans, but found the same 4 pack at Sunflower Market on San Mateo & Academy for only $8.50. No reason to pay $1.50 more for the same beer if you can avoid it.  Appearace - 4.5/5.0 - Nice, pitch black, dark color; toasted tan colored head with good retention Smell - 4.0/5.0 - Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, not overly strong, but enough to get a nice aroma going Taste - 4.0/5.0 - Roasted coffee, toffee, subtle chocolate (odd for a double chocolate stout). Smooth, but with a sharper taste at the end. Feel - 4.0/5.0 - Smooth, little aftertaste, not a heavy beer, mid body for a dark beer Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Indeed, if I'm in the mood for a chocolate stout, would definitely think about this one again - I preferred the nitrous cans over the bomber.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,craftaholic,3.93,"Appearance: Had on tap in a pint; pours a thick jet black hue with a creamy finger length tan head; leaves a moderate amount of lacing down the glass.  Smell: The aroma is the liquid equivalency of a chocolate tootsie pop. Its not over powering but that chocolately and roasted malt scent encompasses the entire nose.  Taste: There are plenty of sweet roasted malts and touches of semi-sweet chocolate. The temperature really affects this one because as time went on this one got better and not in the sense that my palate became numb but rather it was served too cold.  Mouthfeel: Quite light for a stout, isn't as thick and chewy/creamy as I would have liked.  Drinkability: While it is quite tasty I wouldn't session because I feel I would grow weary of the non complex nature of this brew. Definitely will drink again just not in large quantities more of with/as dessert.  Overall: Got the indian shooting the star on this one, liquid tootsie pop that tastes quite good but don't over indulge because the flavor will weigh on you unless you have a severe sweet tooth when it comes to beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A: Very dark brown with 1-2 finger oatmeal-colored head with good retention and a few spots of lace.  S: Dark malts and dark chocolate aromas with light herbal hops  T: Dense chocolate flavor with medium bitterness and mild acrid finish. Hops are more lively than the aroma suggests.  M: Somewhat thin for the style. It misses on the creaminess of the best of the style. Carbonation is low. Aftertaste is more bitter and chocolatey.  D: A good sweet stout with heavy chocolate which unfortunately loses some of the creaminess with the chocolate addition. A good but not great brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Nice foamy head that stays around throughout the drink.  Smell: You get a hint of the sweet chocolaty taste, but it is not too overwhelming.  Taste: Nice strong chocolaty taste with a tad of a bitter aftertaste. Overall a very good balance of the chocolate and stout.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and what can come across as a watery feel, but it's not that bad.  Drinkability: I would say this has a high drinkability especially for the novice beer drinker because of the sweet chocolate taste, it can be very easy for them to branch out from piss water light.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JWolf,3.84,"Poured from nitro can into pint glass.  This was my first chocolate stout.  A = Dark, almost black, with a thick, creamy tan head. Head started out on the thin side, but as the drink settled, the head thickened up and rose to about 1/2 inch. Reduced to 1/4 inch midway through the drink. Lacing isn't really lacing. It's more like a wall of foam on the side of the glass.  Of note: Watching this drink settle was as enjoyable as drinking it. It was mesmerizing watching a dark tan cascade of fine bubbles run down the insides of the glass like a waterfall. Simply beautiful, much like watching a Guinness Stout settle.  S = Sweet, chocolatey, bready. Expected more/stronger, but very pleasant.  T = When it first hits your mouth, it's smooth and sweet with strong creamy chocolate flavor. Also a little reminiscent of pumpernickel. Followed by a bitter chocolate aftertaste, almost like baking chocolate powder, with roasted coffee overtones. The only knock here is that it was a little thin. I expected a thicker, heartier beer.  M = Is it possible to be creamy and watery at the same time? More like milk when I was expecting milkshake. As mentioned under Taste, I expected this beer to be heartier, more chewy... in short, more stout.  D = Overall, a very tasty beer that I am enjoying very much as I write this. I would definitely come back to this one on occasion. Definitely worth a try.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Smell: Roasted sweet malts and dark chocolate. A slight whiff of sourness-- I often get this from English stouts. I expected more here.  Taste: Roasty and bitter chocolate. Bitter, powdery chocolate. Like Bakers chocolate almost. Briefly sweet in the middle, then a long bitter chocolate finish.  Mouthfeel: Actually feels big for its size (its only 5.2%. Creamy and quite nice.  Drinkability: This stuff is OK. At almost $5 a bottle, its not a great value. I expected a sweeter chocolatey stout. Its very English.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,RiverDog,4.4,"A- Very very dark. No visibility through when held directly up to light. Almost like pouring a thinner motor oil. Poured a finger or finger and a half caramel colored head that slowly but surely softened to leave a thin caramel film for the duration of the drink. Leaves a beautiful lace on the opposite side of the drinking edge.  S- Awesome, bold smell. Smells like a rich chocolate coffee. Slight roasted hint.  T- Instant chocolate. Roasted burnt taste on the back of the palette. Leaves a great roasted aftertaste. Very subtle hint of hops.  M- Sharp on the palette leading to...  D- Drinks just as smooth as it pours.

Head is only about a finger thick, but it retains almost completely for the duration. Lacing is tremendous. Really a beautiful looking beer. Unfortunately that's where my praise ends.  Nose is fairly faint. Coffee and chocolate. Taste is the same. Mediocre. And the mouthfeel is even worse. Flat, watery and just generally nasty. It tastes like old, bland watered down coffee. Medium bodied and next to no carbonation.  Completely unimpressed. This is one of my favorite beers when it's from the bottle, but the nitro can serving just completely ruins it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

(S)- Rich dark cocoa amidst coffee and molasses. Smells alot like hot chocolate.  (T)- Tons of rich chocolate in front of medium roasted coffee. Tastes like a mocha.  (M)- Dark & rich chocolate flavors with a good carbonation level. Slightly dry, bitter, and sweet.  (D)- A good chocolatey stout that is easy on the palate.

I've never had that happen before unless I was being careless which I was not this time.  A: Dark, almost black, looks like Coca-Cola. Nice tan head.  S: Smells like Chocolate (duh?) and coffee.  T: Tastes like dark chocolate, coffee and something else, burnt almonds?  M: Lighter than expected, carbonation was perfect for this kind of thing.  D: Super smooth, makes you think about it.

664,73,butti001,4.5,"Served in a Pint-size bottle. Drank at Bado's pizza and ale house on Beverly Road in Mt. Lebanon, PA. Price: $5.75/bottle  Appearance: Poured like a thick dark cola, almost a rich-dark brown or ruby color. Nice thick tan head.  Aroma: Chocolate, Chocolate, and more chocolate. Sweet Cocoa and roasted chocolate malt. The English and crystal malts grab your nose and invite you to dive into a sweet stout that you have been waiting for.  Mouthfeel: Almost a drying effect from this brew. Creamy and quite thin for a high gravity beer, viscosity relatively low. Not overly carbonated. Smooth drinkability.  Taste: Seems like Young's isn't as dark and roasty as other stouts and has more of a sweet, decadent, chocolate flavor. Seems like in most stouts, there is a tug of war between chocolate, coffee, and bittersweet fruit notes, but the chocolate definitely seems to win in this battle (due to the addition of unfermentable sugars that stick around). The malty sweetness is counterbalanced by a subtle hop accent. Additionally, there is not an overkill of alcohol at 5.20% but is still present in the taste.  Summary: One of the best stouts I have had in quite awhile. Incredible mouthfeel and drinkability. I would reccomend this to anyone who appreciates a sweet stout that's not yet imperial strength.. Perhaps a little to decadent to have frequently, but overall, great. I'll buy again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The smell interestingly enough reminds of chocolate rice milk. There is also a bit of sweet/sourness floating around.  The taste is much like you would think. Lots of roasted chocolate malts. I can taste some of the regular chocolate as well. Some bitterness and a sweetness that I would associate with the addition of lactose, which is common in many sweet stouts.  The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and the body isn't too heavy. Drinkability is good. All in all, this is good chocolate stout, but nothing really seems to stand out. After having had Southern Tier's Chocolate and Ommegang's Chocolate Indulgence I would recommend those over this.

Smells only a little, but what's there embodies Hershey's chocolate syrup sweetness with a hint of malt.  Tastes like a Belgian dark with the sort of dry, grainy maltiness you'd expect there. Delightfully bitter. Appropriately carbonated (tingly, but not needles) and with more of an unrefined chocolate taste than what you get from the smell. Medium-bodied. A little chewy. Sweet enough to be smooth. Not thirst-quenching but very drinkable. Lingering malt flavor rounds it out.  It's pretty good overall.

A - This definitely looks more like a traditional stout than an irish stout as the can did. Black as night, nice tan head great lacing.  S - Smells like a good stout, bits of chocolate are there, and deep malts  T - Muchhhh better! Its complex, and very roasty, with very bittersweet dark chocolate. Theres faint burnt coffee notes that show up in the finish and in the after taste. As with the can, for being a double, the chocolate was not as pronounced as i would have thought...not that it takes a way from it though.  M - Its got a good medium to full bodied feel to it.

Appears a nearly impenetrable black with a good finger or so of light tan head that fizzes away leaving some peripheral bubbles. Lacing is not bad with some sticking on the sides.  S- Most definitely chocolate malts on the nose. Can't quite get much else other then a musky chocolate malt smell.  T- Wow! Chocolaty creamy goodness. Also a fairly strong coffee taste. I could best describe this taste as almost a chocolate mocha.  M- Smooth on the tongue and the chocolate maltyness hangs on the tongue along with the coffee notes. I get a very slight warming alcohol taste going down.  D- I actually liked this beer. I wouldn't think that I would like it since it sounded super chocolaty and sweet at first but now I see it is balanced fairly well. Will pick this up again next time I am in the moon for something creamy and chocolaty. Maybe next time I will get it in the can since it seems that isn't bad either.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Lars3,2.82,"I am very disappointed by this beer. I was expecting much much more chocolate, but there is only a slight smell of chocolate and a bland aftertaste of chocolate. I see many good reviews of this beer, so I'm think I got a bad bottle. I bought two bottles, if the second tastes better I'll do a second review. It was dated September 30, 2009. I don't know if this was the best by date or the bottled on date. If it was the best by date it could explain why I disliked it as much as I did.  The appearance is the best part. I poured a 500mL bottle into a 25oz snifter and the head came right up to the top. The color of the beer is nearly black, with a billowing chocolate colored head.  It doesn't smell very good. I can smell the chocolate and a hint of alcohol, but the chocolate should be more pronounced.  It doesn't taste very much like chocolate as I said above. In fact there is a burnt nuttyness that is more prominent than the chocolate.  This is not what I expect a stout to feel like in my mouth. I know the distinctions between a stout and a porter isn't clear, but I tend to associate thicker beers with stouts and the thinner version with porters. If you asked me what this was I would have told you a porter. It is just a bit too thin for me.  Considering how thin this beer is it goes down real easy, so I can easily see myself drinking 2 or 3 of these... if I liked it more.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Slightly chilled.  Pours a very dark black/brown, with noticeable carbonation action, an enthralling brew. The head is slightly off white and very creamy.  Smells like a chocolate milkshake. There is also a little bit of alcohol and roasted malt in the scent.  This is the creamiest beer I have had, a very nice mouthfeel, with a taste of dark chocolate and roasted malts.

Liquid is an impentetrable and inky darkness, just barely brown (I've yet to see a truly black beer). Small but steady canopy of wheat colored foam (with a tan gradient under the top layer), with good retention, and a tall smattering of lacing.  Roasted malt is the primary aroma, with a touch of coffee and chocolate syrup. Very mild hop scent.  Chocolate is more prominent on the palate as is the roasted quality of chocolate malt. Toffee, toasted almonds, coffee, and a hint of rooibos tea rounds things out. Slightly tart, bittersweet finish. Very nice.  Tingly mouthfeel, with decent carbonation and a touch of astringency. Fairly light bodied.  Rather than a dessert beer, I would say this is better paired with food...one of the few beers that I would actively seek out on nitro-tap.

664,73,vacax,3.74,"Pours black with a one-inch creamy, viscous tan head. Cascading nitrogen effect delights the eye after the initial pour. Retention is next to infinite and lacing is nearly a complete coat around the glass. Say what you will about nitro's effect on the rest of the scorecard, but this looks fantastic.  Smells of chocolate syrup, chocolate malts, and a hint of dark fruit, all rather muted beyond the chocolate. Tastes like cocoa, roasted barley, chocolate covered raisins. Tastes good, but flavors are also somewhat muted. A good stout needs a more intense flavor. Revenge of the nitro?  Has a fine carbonation with a very creamy medium body. Overall this is a pretty nice little treat. Food for thought, the nitro-cans cost around one-third less than the bottles.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Cant really recall when I first found this one.  a: poured from the 1 pint bomber into my goblet. very thick light brown head of 2 fingers settels but does NOT dissipate.

Deep maple syrup brown.  s really smells like chocolate. nothing much else  t: again with the chocolate. no bitter hops noted here  m super thick and luxurious...carbonated a bit more than lightly.  d: easliy drinkable nice specific style. this is a great ""special purpose"" beer  FOLLOW UP: as this warms the chocolate flavor Really comes out.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Blitzstyle,4.17,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Really nice and black coloring, with a tan/chocolate colored head that really sticks around. Great lacing on the glass when swirled.  Smelled of chocolate powder that you would use to mix with milk to make chocolate milk.  Taste very creamy and surprisingly lite. Wonderful chocolate taste to the brew that goes down very easy. Very smooth.  Very thin and light not a thick feeling ton the tounge at all. Goes down smooth as silk.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Some chocolate present as well, but not nearly as much as in the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full-bodied. Very smooth, but some bitter bite. Very easy to drink.  Drinkability: Avery good stout. Decently sweet, smokey, and &#8220;chocolatey&#8221;, but not as much as a milk/sweet stout should be. Very smooth and easy to drink.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,morimech,4.06,"The beer benefits from being on nitro. Has the wonderful looking cascading head that settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The beer itself is very dark. The aroma consists of dark, chocolate malt with hints of floral hops. Rather timid with its aromas. Definate chocolate qualities in the flavor. Roasted malt compliments the chocolate as well. It is sweet in the front with hop flavor and bitterness in the finish. Love the English hops. Not as chocolaty as I was expecting but rather a nice sweet stout with a lot of balance. Even with the benefit of nitro this beer feels thin but it maintains a nice soft texture that is pleasing. Not every stout has to be an ABV monster and this is a perfect example of less is more. Very easy drinking.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S- Oddly enough, it smells like someone added lots of cocoa and chocolate to a stout. Very nice smell, I wish it was a little stronger.  T- Strong cocoa taste. Kind of a one trick pony, but it does its one trick very well.  M- Medium body and smooth. I like stouts to be a little thicker though.  D- Drinking the whole bottle is not a problem. The flavors and smells get better as the beer warms. I hope I can find this beer around my area so I can drink it again.

Sweet at first...then smooths out a bit and with the gulp, it becomes slightly salty, with a nutty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is not strong at all, but very flavorful...This is a great representation of a milk stout.  Drinkability: You know a beer is good, when my girlfriend will try out a ""dark"" beer and actually like it. Score one (hell, make it two) for Young's.

664,73,HalfFull,3.75,Poured from an Impy Pint bottle into a large wine glass. Shows a deep brownish/black with a somewhat robust tan head.  Nose is chocolate and rich yet nowhere near as creamy as the nitro tap will deliver. Offers decent retention and lacing nonetheless. Rich chocolate nose encompasses a rather light bodied beer. Smooth and decent drinkability.  In the end I would recommend this beer on Nitro tap. Offering a much preferred texture and clarity of flavor.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jdg204,4.15,"Third and final brew of a great dinner at Porters Pub. Had my eye on this one for a while and the time seemed perfect.  A: Deep brown body with a lovely tanned head that bubbles to life from the bottom up to the top but disipates pretty quickly with good lacing.  S: Milky, rich, malty chocolate and coffee aromas.  T: Sweet chocolate milk shows up to start with a touch of coffee tossed in for balance. Touch of bitterness to finish it off and provide a nice balance.  M: Medium, creamy body with just a touch of carbonation.  D: Rock solid brew that I was glad to have finally tried. Have to admit I'm a much bigger fan of Bell's Cream Stouts (Kalamazoo and Double Cream) but this chocolate milk/ low carbonation take was interesting. Not a must try but definitely worth a shot for its uniqueness if you're a Stout lover like me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TheMadJack,4.48,"Poured from pint bottle into pint glass.  Beer is dark brown and lets no light through. The head is a warm buff color and thick, almost lathery and stands half an inch above the rim of the glass by the time I'm done pouring. The head settles down to about a half inch and leaves a similarly lathery lacing on the side of the glass. There's even lacing where I've been sipping the beer, which I've seen to usually be the one place generally devoid of such phenomena.  Yep, this is definitely a chocolate beer. Dark chocolate dominates the aroma, with hints of smoke and coffee.  First taste is dark chocolate, with a faint bitterness completing the comparison. The ""double"" becomes apparent as the bitter fades to a creamy milk chocolate flavor upon swallowing, as much a scent as a flavor. This beer is really dependent on olfaction for the full effect. I find myself inhaling deeply with each pull to enjoy every bit of the chocolate. The beer warms well. It becomes considerably better, in fact, as it shakes off the chill of my fridge (kept, out of necessity, just a touch too cold for serving beer, but not so cold that all I can keep are lagers). As it warms the beer shifts more towards the sweeter side of the dark and milk chocolate flavors, and the milk chocolate dominates the nose. The beer is never overly sweet, and some of the stout nature comes through at all times - not flavors, but a heartiness, warmth, and slight bitter that says ""stout"" without smacking you upside the head with it. The finish is surprisingly clean. I almost expect to need a glass of milk on hand, but each sip delivers it's dose and fades away clean within a few seconds, leaving you to enjoy at your leisure.  The beer has only enough carbonation to maintain a head and to bring out that slight amount of bitterness I mentioned. Otherwise it is satisfyingly heavy and smooth.  Normally I find that it is difficult for me to drink sweet beer in quantity. Perhaps it is the stoutness of its character that makes this one an exception. Yes, it is chocolate, and in that manner there is a sweetness to it, but the focus seems to be more on the savory qualities of chocolate and there is just enough bitterness to the stout to keep the palate fresh. On more than one occassion have I put several of these away, one after another, in the course of an evening. Definitely a treat, and definitely a good one to have on hand for dessert, for the holidays, or for a cool evening.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,alkemy,3.91,"This is very dark...basically completely opaque. There is a dark mahogany on the bottom edge of the glass...and this is when held directly in light. Rich and creamy looking tan head. I didn't really notice any appreciable lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate. Bitter cocoa taste is most dominant. I also get some smokiness along with a hint of coffee. Has a pretty dry finish. I had the 16.9oz. bottle and thought it had a little too much carbonation. It gave it the illusion of being thick and creamy, but I would have prefered it just be a thicker viscosity. Still this is a really good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BigJim5021,3.75,"The nitro can gives this the awesome looking cascade effect. Little tan waterfalls roll down the side of the glass. When all is said and done, you've got a damn-near black stout with a big, thick tan head that leaves so much lacing it's not even funny.  Aroma is, well, pretty much nothing. A little bit of powdered hot chocolate and some faint roasted malts. Easily the weakpoint on this one.  The taste is chocolatey and toasty. Neither burnt nor astringent, but still has some decent bitterness.  Mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy. I find Guinness to be a little on the thin side as far as stouts go, but this stuff doesn't suffer from the same problems.  I could probably down an entire four-pack of these puppies in a sitting, but I think that it might get just a tad old by the end.

Pours a very deep opaque mahogany with the tan head reaching its peek at about two fingers. Displays some nice, sticky lacing.  Ridiculously sweet but not overwhelming scent of dark chocolate, roasted malts and a bit of coffee.  Dark chocolate, roasted malts and a touch of black licorice followed by a dry, nutty hop finish.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth, creamy and just a tad bit heavier than skimmed milk. Tooo easy to drink.  Overall, an excellent stout. Perfect amount of sweetness and a pleasant dry hoppy finish to balance. They didn't try to make it overly sweet which is the downfall for me in most stouts I've had.

Starts smooth and slightly sweet on the tongue with a very milky light texture (not at all unlike skim milk). Definitely easy to drink but without a certain weight to it i find myself wanting (probably thanks to too many imperial stouts). Finishes dryer than expected with a lot of dark chocolate quite long in to the finish.  All around a very pleasant stout and dangerously easy to drink.

Feel: Light, mild but ever-present carbonation.  Drink: The light body makes it very drinkable, and the interesting flavors make you want to drink more! A preferable stout for sessions.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,LordAdmNelson,4.03,"I love this beer, I can get it cheap at a local bar. The look of it is extremely dark with chocolate head. Decent lacing, this one looks good. It smells like smei-sweet chocolate-covered coffee beans. It tastes even better, with a nice balance of dark chocolate, a bit of hops, and some coffee and smoke notes. Delicious with a coating, medium body, this one goes down smooth. It lingers nicely, makes for a good night.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,damndirtyape,4.35,"Single bottle (1pt, 0.9oz) poured into a tumbler with a best by date of 10/31/09. When poured I got a light brown head with very fine bubbles that died down a bit, but still covered the top of the beer as I drank it down. Lots of lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer itself is black - opaque in the glass but you can make out a shade of brown that a tiny bit of light will get through.  Smell is quite nice. When cold you don't get much of anything, but as it warms up it begins to smell like a chocolate liqueur - creamy dark chocolate and alcohol.  Taste - that's the whole point of this beer isn't it? Bittersweet chocolate up front and a tad of coffee at the end when cold which becomes more cocoa in flavor at the front and less coffee at the end as it warms up. Nothing is overpowering in one direction or another - it's nicely balanced and not cloying or too bitter at any one point.  Mouthfeel - Thick and creamy like one would expect from a stout. Not Guinness thick, but nice. A very faint amount of carbonation on the tongue.  Drinkability - This is one to have with food. I had it with a burger and fries for an adult version of chocolate shake with the meal. And it did not disappoint. However, given the price of the beer this is one for special occasions, not a routine brew - despite it's high quality. So while I greatly enjoyed it I can't rate it highest on drinkability.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It is a little bit bitter but not too much. There really isn't much of a hop presence in this one. I can still taste the chocolate when I breath out. Delicious.  M: Not nearly as thick as I was expecting. I thought this was going to be one of those brews that leave my mouth really flemmy but it's not.

It leaves a lingering taste of dark (70% or more) cocoa in your mouth. If you love beer and you love chocolate (like me) then this is a must try. There is very subtle coffee notes at the beginning, but man this is a fucking awesome beer!  MF - Very heavy beer but what can you expect from a stout like this? My least fave part of the beer.

664,73,tkarsies,3.47,"On Nitro-tap at Bodega in Columbus, Ohio. Served in a standard pint glass. I am surprised I have not reviewed this beer before but here goes.  A: I am a sucker for the cascading with nitro beers, especially a stout. This looked great--1 minute cascading left an opaque, black beer with a 2 finger tan head. Lots of lacing with permanent rings from every gulp.  S: Like many nitro beers, the smell is not quite the same as the non-nitro version. This is no exception. Smells faintly of roasted malt with some chocolate on the nose.  T: Tastes OK. The dominant flavor is chocolate, like the bottled version, but muted. Not unpleasant but not as strong as other versions.  M: Thick and creamy. Typical nitro stout mouthfeel.  D: This was easy to drink. The nitro does take away some of the potential cloying nature of this beer.  Overall this was a better nitro experience than some of the other beers I have had on nitro. The chocolate flavors hold up, and although they are decreased some, this may actually make the beer a bit more drinkable. I would try this again, although with 49 other draft selections at the bar I was at, it may take awhile before I get to it again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Poured into a lucious 20 oz. Young's Glass, this stout is still settling when the waitress brings it to the table. Beautiful frothy head that lasts throughout the entire experience--matched with an equally superior lacing the coats the entire inside shaft with a mosaic of creaminess.  Tastes eactly as a brew in this genre should--creamy, sweet, and it feels like a milkshake. What I really appreciate about this stout is that the sweetness does not come across as overpowering or artificial.  I could drink these all night long--and in fact, I did.

664,73,mintjellie,4.3,"This beer is completely opaque. It's just black, and even held to the light, no colour highlights show. It pours with an enourmous tan head. The head has good retention, but doesn't leave a whole lot of lace. It smells of sweet chocolate and roasted malt, with a fruit character coming out as it warms. This beer has a nice subtle cocoa flavour to it, balanced nicely by bitter black coffee. There's a touch of sweetness to it, like molasses. As it warms, the coffee bitterness becomes a bit more forward. Chocolate? Coffee? It's damned near perfect and sublime and so much greater than the sum of its constituent parts. Like cafe mocha, chocolate covered coffee beans, or chocolate cake paired with coffee. Unless you don't like either chocolate or coffee to begin with, it's impossible not to like coffee and chocolate together. It feels smooth, but somewhat light in body. It doesn't leave me feeling full. This is a good thing, because it means you can easily have more than one. Trust me, you'll want more than one.

Incredibly creamy looking tan head, which never dissipated When poured from the nitro can there was a cascade of carbonation running all through the glass. Such an amazing looking beer. I couldn't wait to put my lips to it.  S - Very nice smell. Not incredibly powerful, but a great smell nonetheless. Wonderful bittersweet chocolate smell. Some sweet chocolate aroma with some bitter cocoa notes. Simple but complex at the same time.  T - Much of the same of the smell. Very good sweet/semi-sweet chocolate flavor to it. The aftertaste is a little more bitter, especially on the back of the tongue. Sort of a malty flavor to it. Very smooth flavor!  M - Seems a little thin to me, but I seem to say that about a lot of beers so maybe I just expect a substantial mouthfeel. Other than the head, the carbonation left pretty quickly leaving no carbonation in the mouth. I would have enjoyed a little more to the mouthfeel, but it was still okay.  D - Pretty good.

A dark breadiness that calls pumpernickel and B&M brown bread to mind. A dry floral hop finish that leaves light graham and charcoal.  A quenching feel that makes this one a good dessert beer as well as an autumn refresher. Lighter like a good dry Irish. Tingly carbonation scrubs the whole mouth.  So easy to drink and be satisfied.

664,73,superdedooperboy,4.45,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into an imperial pint glass. According to the bottle, this one is best enjoyed before Halloween, 31/10/2009.  Pours jet black, virtually opaque, not letting any light through. A thick two fingers of rocky tan foam issues forth, falling slowly and leaving a delicate ringing and webbing of lace ont he walls of the glass.  The nose is dominated by rich, delectable notes of bittersweet dark chocolate and an underlying roastiness from the roasted malt. Quite appetizing.  Medium-full in body, with a somewhat lively carbonation, creating an altogether different sensation than the nitrogen-infused version: the prickly, scrubbing carbonation takes away a bit of the rich, creamy chocolate flavor that lies within and serves to highlight more the roasted malt and bittering hops. Finish is dry and a bit roasty, with a lingering chocolate-espresso aftertaste.  Superbly drinkable and excellent combined with coffee ice cream with dark chocolate chips. Still, the carbonation detracts a little from the overall impression as opposed to the nitro version, which is much more dessert-like. Overall, though, this remains one of my favorite stouts, and is a wonderful dessert beer and perhaps a great intro to good beer for those uninitiated out there.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,deleted_user_357747,4.71,"Four can pack of Young's DCS, from the corner liquor store. Poured into a Samuel Smith tumbler.  Pours a lot of head (my bad; bad pour), cascading tan head, almost three fingers deep. Perfect black, with just a hint of light at the bottom and edges. I love just looking at this beer! Perfect!  Smells strongly of malt, chocolate, burnt something, alcohol, some coffee. A little weak for my taste, I wish it had a more powerful stout smell.  After digging through about six inches of thick head, I finally reached the sweet nectar underneath. Oh my GOD, this is a delicious beer! Big chocolate and roasty malt character, but not overpoweringly strong. To be sure, for a stout, and from a stout enthusiast, this is a relatively ""weak"" stout, but screw the style requirements, this beer is fantasico! Complex, with a certain almost ""vegetably"" smell to it, like a garden, maybe herbs, I can't pinpoint it exactly. Superb chocolate flavors, seamlessly intergrating with the fantastic lingering malt. Wow! This is my new favorite sweet stout!  Mouthfeel is not what I expected; I expected a BIG mouthful of burnt malt to fill my oral orifice. To be sure, this milk stout is surprisingly thin. All milk stouts I have had, they were characteristically thick and chewy. This makes Guinness feel like a slice of bread in your mouth. But this isn't a bad thing, in fact, I think it helps it become more of the desert beer it's meant to be, low carbonation, silky smooth.; the flavor is important here, not so much the ""stout-ness"". No points off for changing the style to the intent of the brewer.  Drinkability, for a stout, is dead on. Enough complexity of flavor to make it a rewarding sipper, but light enough and low alcohol to render feasible an entire hot afternoon, cracking can after can after can of this delicious, fantastic, amazing brew! Great job, W&Y's!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,magnj,3.92,"A - deep brown body, 1 finger brown head.  S - milk chocolate dominates, no detectable yeast, hops or other malt profiles.  T - tastes like chocolate milk so much that a child could easily consume this unknowingly. Otherwise there is a nuttyness in the finish, mild toasty coconut, somewhat bready in the end.  M/d - silky and creamy and while intensley chocolatey it is not too sticky sweet.  Good beer but one sided for me and it would be hard to have more than one of these unique pint sized bottles a sitting.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,r0nyn,4.13,"Poured from a pint bottle into a mug.  The color is inky black and totally opaque; nothing is visible even when held up to a light, which I found rather impressive. A thick head formed at the first pour dissipates quickly into the smallish layer that stays with the beer throughout the rest of the time. Smell definitely lives up to the name, with scents of dark chocolate and mocha wafting over the top of the glass.  As soon as the beer hit my tongue I could taste the chocolate as advertised. I definitely tasted dark chocolate swirling around my tongue along with hints of coffee as well. The sweet flavoring lingered for mere seconds before the malts asserted themselves. The finish introduced the bitterness, but there was barely an aftertaste of it left in my mouth, which is great for me since I don't usually care for the bitter stuff. Just enough light carbonation to tickle the taste buds on my tongue and keep them interested. The feel of the beer is heavier than other beers, as to be expected of a stout, but I found it much lighter than the weighty clout Guinness packs. This doesn't really detract from the overall experience as it's light enough to have multiple (but not too many) servings of.  Overall, it's an awesome stout that smells and tastes great. I can easily see myself drinking two or more of these in one session without getting that filled-up feeling that Guinness typically gives me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A: Pours a jet black body - and I do mean jet: completely opaque, with not even the slightest glint of translucency when held up to light - topped by a half-inch of rock-solid beige foam. Man I love the head on a nitro stout. The only reason this didn't get a 5 for appearance was the lack of the gorgeous cascading action that you get from a Guinness - say what you want about the beer's flavor, there simply isn't a better looking nitro stout than Guinness. This is pretty damn close, though.  S: Deeply sweet dark chocolate, and not much more. Of course, I wouldn't expect any more from a beer that bills itself as a ""luxury double chocolate stout."" Quite inviting.  T: Some of the sweet chocolate from the smell up front, followed by some mineral dryness and finally a dark, roasted finish with both chocolate and coffee notes. Fairly complex, but not as rich as I was expecting.  M: Disappointingly thin and watery, but with luscious nitrogenation.  D: Just fine. The smell alone keeps me coming back for more, and the thin body and dry, roasted finish keep the chocolate from getting cloying in any way. I could throw back a few of these without difficulty, but I'm not sure I'd really want to.  Notes: My hopes were high with this one: I'm a huge Guinness fan, and was really looking forward to trying a nitro stout that would offer the same smoothness and drinkability with a richer, thicker, fuller flavor. While I'd readily admit that this beer both smells and tastes somewhat better than Guinness, its watery body alone kept it from being a truly memorable brew. Definitely worth a shot, though, and I'm not at all sorry to have three more of these in the fridge.  Cheers!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The falling bubbles, the swirls, the creamy head that doesn't just have a harsh stop to it but sort of melts into the beer. It's black body with a sandy colored solid head. Saying this sounds disgusting but in reality, it looks like solidified bacon fat.  S: Smells sort of like burnt bread to me. But in a good way? I don't know. It isn't too much coffee or roast, but it isn't malty sweet. Maybe a little malty sweet. No hops. Hmm, maybe a sort of cooking bread smell. I don't know, I'm just not that into it.  T: I can see where they get the Chocolate part, it has a very cocoa taste to it right away. After that, I don't know. I've let it get a little warmer and still it's odd to me. I've never had a milk/sweet stout that I can think of. I get no fruitiness, no hops, no sweet maltiness. I really don't get that much taste at all I suppose. It's not dry, I don't know. Maybe comparable to very thin chocolate milk or coffee? Not offended, but not impressed  M: Creamy and smooth, yummy.

While it is being poured, it looks and smells reminescent of dark chocolate milk. As it enters the glass, it has a much lighter brown color from the nitro that is not yet released from the liquid. After it settles, it takes on a nearly black color with dark brown around the edges. Boasts a 1 finger silky cream head that is slightly tanned. Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass after every sip. The head remains solid until the very end. Mouthfeel is very light and carbination is somewhat tingly. A very easy drinking beer.

S- A surprisingly dry smell, but with that roasted, dark chocolate scent all at the same time.  T- GREAT! Like a dry Irish stout, but with a bittersweet chocolate taste. Not as thick as chocolate milk, but had that taste to it. Lots of coffee, maltiness to it as well. It just seems to have more in common with a dry Irish stout than it does with a milk/cream stout. Nothing like the Sam Adams Cream Stout. That is more of a porter to me, and tastes nothing like this or a Guinness-type stout.  M- Real nice. Just like a dry Irish stout. Real soft and creamy, not heavy like the beer looks like it would be.  D- Easy to drink do to how light the body of the beer is. It's easy to drink with whatever you're doing.  *- WOW!

Forms a huge bubbly head that dissipates within a minute or two and just forms a rim around the stout in the glass. No real lacing through out drink duration. The smell is full of roasted malt, cocoa, milk chocolate and coffee bean. The intensity gets better and better as the stout warms up; your patience will definitely be rewarded.  The flavor and taste is also great and complex, as many flavors are presented throughout your palate. At first, the milk and dark chocolate flavors are apparent, with roasted malt characteristics then appear towards the middle and then lastly followed by the cocoa powder, which is incredibly palpable on the tongue. Big noticeable flavor characteristic to this brew. Incredible.  The mouthfeel is quite thin and light-bodied. A decent amount of carbonation going on in the mouth; thought I'd be a bit thicker and chewier before trying, but no complaints here. The drinkability is very, very high.

Mid sip reveals some roasted espresso with a good amount of bitter hops taking over on the finish. The linger is crisp with a touch of oily chocolate that pleasnatly soothes the palate. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy with tiny little bubbles that give the beer a crisp mid-palate, making way for an oily, mouth-coating finish. This stout is immensely drinkable. A good amount of complexity for a milk stout with a manageable 5.2% ABV makes this a very enjoyable session stout. Despite it's weight, I feel that I could easily throw back a few of these.

664,73,Buschyfor3,4.18,"Enjoyed a YDCS off a nitro-tap (hells yeah!) at Flanagan's Ale House, Louisville. Just recently added to their tap rotation.  A: Classic. This looks like a thick, creamy stout; good cascade effect off the nitro-tap. Head looks like chocolate milk, uber-thick, super rich and creamy. After cascading for a couple good minutes, the body settles to a dark, mahogany brown. Killer head retention and sticky lacing.  S: Nose is all kinds of chocolate like you'd expect - nothing really different or new from the can/bottle version: milk chocolate, dark, baker's chocolate, some semisweet/cocoa powder in there too. The underlying stout has some considerable roasted notes, prominently some coffee bean and heavily burnt toast.  T: Again, delicious. If there is any change from bottle to nitro-can to nitro-tap, its that the flavor profile comes across a touch ""sweeter"" when pulled off a nitro-tap - or perhaps its that the nitrogenation mutes the roast/bitterness from the malts so that the chocolate seems more prominent. But I digress, all of the flavors seem to meld together quite coherently, starting off with the chocolate top note - you get a sweeter milk chocolate/powdered hot chocolate flavor a bit more prominently (especially if you take a sip right off the milkshake-creamy head). Once you get into the body of the stout, the roasted malts begin to release with a slight bitterness and roast coffee/toast flavors. Works quite well.  M: Goodness this is even silkier and ridiculously creamy/smooth; this stout is already creamy to begin with, but off the nitro-tap it is even a step above what you get from the nitro-can if you ask me.  D: Deadly. All too easy to finish a pint in under 5 minutes (it is, after all, 4.9oz less than the nitro-can). Super sessionable stout - pleasant sweetness, with just enough of a bitter roast balance and little hint of the booze means that you can get away with a couple of pints before you start feeling it.  I have to say, this is still one of my favorite sweet stouts of all time. Still the beer I have in my fridge most often. Still my go-to session stout that I can have a couple of and not worry about feeling worse for wear. I wish I had a tap of this at my house.

664,73,ATSJer,4.74,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout 1 pint .09 US fl.oz Room temp bottle (large glass)  Appearance: the pour was average though for the size of the bottle it created a chug as it poured which really built the head up, easily I would say 3 fingers, with still more in the bottle. The head was almond colored and had a medium density, but dissipated to a ring by the time I took my first sip. The head has a light cling to the glass, but I noticed some heavier spots near the top where the head reached but the brew itself did not. The stout is ink black in the glass, though you can see just a hint of clean dark amber on the bottom of the glass when held to the light, other than that it is beautifully opaque with zero light showing through the middle of the brew. I can see very little evidence of carbonation on the top. Just looking at it I'm intrigued.  Smell: One of the first things that I noticed other than just how excellent this smelled was the toffee or caramel sweetness and the noticeable alcohol aroma, this had a heavy underlayer of dark malts what I can only imagine are chocolate malts, I also smell a bit of spicyness not nearly as prominent as the Bison Chocolate Stout. In other brews I've smelled hints of sweetness, but here it is especially prominent; as I continued to drink I began to recognize a building in the sweetness and a lessening of the alcohol smell, that with the malt base really had my nose going.  Taste: Sweet toffee right away as it hits my tongue, but not candy bar toffee more of a refined flavor, this mixed with the malts is excellent. I'm a big espresso lover and the deep rich flavors light my taste buds up, as does Young's stout, combine that with the well balanced level of hops with the deep cacao weaving through it all and the taste is simply the best I've experienced. There was some alcohol taste at first, but the more I drank the more it seemed to diminish. The finish has a nice bite from the hops reminding you after all that you are drinking a stout, but then the malts and chocolates remain and flood up your nose giving you an after-taste you don't want to lose. Young's stout is a very robust full bodied brew that will honestly leave you wishing there was more in that oversized bottle.  Mouthfeel: The stout is thick on the tongue and in the mouth it rolls well and has a bit of effervescence from the carbonation but it does not make the brew foamy. If anyone accuses this brew of being watery then they must drink their brews with a spoon, the thing that I noticed most is that the feeling is much thicker in my mouth than it looks. I did notice a light buttery taste and film in my mouth afterwards from the diacetyl (stuff that makes butter feel like it does), but it was not heavy or unpleasant.  Drinkability: Well what can I say, other than I was three fourths of the way through before I decided to slow down and sip the last bit savoring the flavors. This is a dessert beer, I can see drinking this on special occasions or when fine dining with a rich meal, or simply enjoying a bottle during a night with friends. The size of the bottle, alcohol content 5.2% abv and the robust flavors keeps this from being a session beer, but if what you want is a brew to settle down with and work with while letting your senses run wild then pour yourself a Young's.  This by far is the best stout I've had to date and I simply find it hard to believe that it gets better. On my next stop though the liquor store I'll be picking up another for a nice quiet night home.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,flagmantho,3.88,"Had this beer from the 440mL draughtflow can. Poured into a glass for a thick, creamy head.  Appearance: extremely dark amber with a thick, creamy head. Quite appetizing.  Smell: chocolate is the most prominent scent, to the exclusion of other characteristics; however, it is intriguingly appetizing.  Taste: malt is well-balanced with bitterness at first taste, though the finish is quite bitter indeed. Chocolate flavor not quite as prominent as the smell, a fact I quite like.  Mouthfeel: slightly creamy, but surprisingly thin for the style despite the nitro can.  Drinkability: the bitterness of the finish detracts a bit from what would otherwise be a well-balanced beer. This reduces the drinkability a bit in my opinion; perhaps paired with a relatively non-sweet dessert this could work quite well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,katybee,3.63,"Excited to try a new beer flavored with one of my favorite flavors, chocolate, I was a bit let down by this one. Perhaps anticipated something much more sweet. Perhaps the beer definition is something more akin to the color and type of maltings, not so much the actual flavor as compared to a candybar or chocolate Kahlua....  The beer poured smoothly, with minimal tan head which quickly dissipated. No mentionable lacing. Very little carbonation at all . But the thickness of the color was astounding. It was an opaque dark chocolate color...I held it up to the light to see if there was highlights, but none. Very similar to CocaCola or dark coffee...or soy sauce. Yet clear; no cloudiness.  The smell was minimal. Bare trace of hops, if any. The emphasis of the taste was definitely malt. Perhaps like a malt liquor, but without the alcohol and without the carbonation. Smooth, rounded, slightly bitter, traces of cocoa flavor perhaps roasted malts. But there was also something that reminded me of the barley sauce used for fish and chips, and again a soy sauce character without the saltiness.  It was drinkable; probably would be great with fish n chips or a burger or a contrast to a strong salad dressing, and great alternating with a sweet pop like Pepsi.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MikeBrandman,4.63,"Poured from a nitro-can into an imperial pint glass.  A - Pours a deep black that's opaque even in direct light. No visible suspension, carbonation, or haze. Just black. I didn't get much head on this, only about half a finger. What was there is a tan, milk chocolatey head that, thankfully, sticks around. Not much lace to speak of.  S - Smells like chocolate and alcohol. Not much else to speak of unless you know your chocolate really well, I suppose.  T - The taste is where this really shines. It tastes like a chocolate drink while your drinking it and a chocolate bar as it lingers in your mouth afterward. Slightly bitter, but not too strong. Taste is a little watered down, but the fact that it's so thick and lasts so long makes sure you don't get tired of the flavor.  MF - So creamy and rich. Feels like melted chocolate easing down your throat. The head that lingers really compliments the taste and mouthfeel well.  D - Dangerously drinkable. At least, the first one is.

After further discussion with a beer expert BA member Littlecreature, he recommended trying chocolate cake with the youngs double chocolate stout.  surprising i have eaten a chocolate muffin and had a lager and that was not a nice mixture.  but eating a chocolate cake and having a stout works well for awhile, but as you get to the end of a schooner of this stout and the cake.  even if i didnt have the cake, i dont think id be able to drink too much of this beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Kind of thin for a stout, but the nitro-effect gives it some appearance points. Also, the head lingers very nicely - and some cool lacing. A bit of cocoa-pebbles style chocolate on the nose, but that's all. Taste is a thin but sweet stout - makes for a decent session. Good in lieu of anything else in that you can easily drink a lot of it. Smooth cocoaey notes, but a bit watery. That fact is made up by the fact that it is super creamy and smooth.

Great flavor, reminds me of yoohoo which I used to love as a kid. Carbonation is good but I can't help thinking how much better it would be with a nitrous kick.

664,73,Magpie14,4.21,"A: the first glance I was fixated on a silky chocolate moussed head. This cap was rather dense with good retention. The body was mostly black, as far as I could tell. Maybe some deep orange browns existed in and around the bottom of the glass as well as the edges. Body looks solid and the cascading golden ripples only augmented its appearance. Milk chocolate colored spider web lacing was everywhere at the upper 1/3 of the glass  S: has a robust chocolate malt as the focal scent with softly roasted grains. The nose has really only one dimension and seems a bit laid back. I can pull some metallic whiffs after a few sips  T: chocolate flavors lend more than just regular cocoa notes. I started to taste a rich double chocolate truffle and imagined a bitter cocoa shell with a creamy milk chocolate center. The roasted notes hang around in the back and lend a good hand in stabilizing the chocolate notes. I still find this guy pretty chocolaty based, not a bad thing. I even pull out some faint dried/stale ground coffee beans and a shot of lactose sweetener to help add to its velvet-ness  M: in some ways as close to liquid gold as possible with a close to full body. However, I might make a stretch to find that the body might sit on the lighter side for a stout. This is not a problem, just me being picky and trying to find something wrong with the mouthfeel  D: I don't know, this is pretty tasty. I have rarely seen a nitro tap of this let alone the purple label double chocolate on tap. Good stuff!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ToasterChef,4.27,"Served on tap at Novare Res, poured into my Uprising chalice. As one would expect from a stout, this is a very dark beer with a slightly off-white, creamy head. The aroma is of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is of chocolate and coffee. I first wrote that there wasn't much bitterness, but as the beer warmed the bitterness became more pronounced; it never got very strong though. Also, there isn't as much sweetness as you'd expect. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a good amount of carbonation. It is near perfect in my opinion, thanks in some part to the nitro tap. In summary, I recommend that you try this beer. Don't let the Irish control the market for European stouts.

664,73,WildMaverick1200,4.46,"So, I love stout, love chocolate.... I saw this bottle at the liquor store, and though somewhat expensive, the combination just seemed to make sense. Came with best before Jan 2010 date, which is as fresh as it gets.  Pours an absolutely beautiful dark brown which eventually becomes black. Creates a fluffy brownish head which shrinks eventually but stays there for quite a while and leaves some lacing. ""Look Ma', no nitrogen!"". It's hard to beat the look of that espresso-like beer.  Strong cocoa smell, with some hop aromas lying in the back. It reminds of a traditional bitter chocolate drink.  Taste brings dark chocolate and hop acidity, and later some sweetness from multiple malts. Leaves a combination of a sweet finish and some hops to contrast. Exactly the same slightly bitter aftertaste I get in that chocolate drink I mentioned. Quite pleasant.  Excellent creamy consistency, and a bold, medium body. Just a pinch of carbonation to let you know it's actually there. The head contributes to a creamy feel in your lips while you're sipping. Wonder what it's like with some nitrogen....  Ah man, this is one awesome brew, it just somehow lifts the good spirits in you. Nothing overpowering, and a decent ABV make for a perfectly drinkable Stout. Excellent for dark chocolate lovers like me. If you like chocolate AND stout, this will be like palate porn for you.  Extremely recommended, and, enjoy your chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It pour chocolate syrup brown with a thin tan head up top. Taste was matly and chocolatey but not so much as to be overly sweet but sweet enough to make it pleasent for those looking for sweet. Was pretty thick and smooth going down. Overall I'd say it was really drinkable. A good beer,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S - roasty malts, candied brown sugar and chocolate, dash of coffee. Almost reminiscent of fresh baked cookies; A very decadent aroma.  T - Milky sweetness plays the backbeat to the upfront medley of chocolate, toffee, roasted malt and coffee. Not really that sweet, but enough to give it the dessert beer vibe.  M - Very peppy on the carbonation, adding a lot of levity to the medium-light body. A very ethereal stout.  D - Mmm...Oh so smooth and easy drinking. Low ABV and great taste make this such an easy sessioning choice or to compliment dessert. I kinda wish I had a brownie sundae or chocolate cake to go with this.  overall - A very pleasant treat.

Leaves sudsy, spotty lacing. Classic stout appearance, just a little thicker looking. Smells of fruity over ripened plum, raisin, dates, prune, black cherry's, very sweet & grainy malty notes. Toffee, chocolate & coffee notes, kind of like a Tootsie Roll aroma, rich and chocolaty overall! Very, very intriguing & inviting aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of syrupy molasses, toffee, buttery notes, sweet rich chocolate & toasted malts, coffee & dark chocolate like bitterness, again, as in the aroma there's some Tootsie Roll flavors in there! Some tart grape & raisins, wonderfully balanced, rich and sweet overall. Mouthfeel is semi creamy, bit of bite of carbonation on the tongue, smooth, just a tad silky, and medium-full bodied, but more on the medium side.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I don't know where to start, this beer is so decadent, so overly indulgent, such a treat, such a dessert! This beer pulls off a wonderfully rich chocolate aroma & flavor, and just like the bottle says ( It's never to sweet!) I wouldn't mind having a pint or two for dessert, nearly flawless flavors aroma, I would of appreciated more body though. Still, an indulgent treat, who needs chocolate cake?

Smell: It has a sweet malt smell with some roasted odor and a bit of chocolate. This has a pretty solid nose.  Taste: A dark chocolate flavor for sure, with some coffee like bitterness and a little bit of coffee flavor. It also has some just creamy milk like flavor. Basically, if someone split up milk chocolate into its various components this would be it.  Mouthfeel: Not super thick for the style. Just medium body and medium carbonation. It however is very creamy.  Drinkability: I mean this is a pretty good beer, but I was expecting something thicker and a bit less creamy.

This is a nice treat after a meal or with sweets.  M - Some mild carbonation, but mostly a creamy mouthfeel. Good example of how a stout should feel.  D - Not a terribly heavy beer, which in combination with the sweetish taste makes for easy drinking. This beer doesn't fill you up, but doesn't skimp on the flavor either.

Kinda like a dark dark latte Can I get a spoon so I don't get it in my mustache?  Smell: not very strong, but you can defiantly smell a sweetness and chocolate roasted malt.  Taste: Sugary Sweet, with a roasted malt character that actually tastes very chocolately unlike many stouts that claim to have a chocolate flavor. Not overwhelming or densely complex, just smooth, sugary, and sweet.  Mouthfeel: barely carbonated, so its smooth very smooth, especially with all its milk like froth that clings to the glass.  Drinkability: Smooth and not as stomach occupying as one might thing for a beer as dense is this. However a pint or two of these might be a bit too much for me because of its dessert like sweetness.

The smell at first was pretty strong, not only the chocolate but kind of roasted malt smell and it had me wondering if it was just going to be like a strong stout. After tasting it though the taste was quite different then the smell. Taste like chocolate for sure, almost like chocolate milk just with a beer kick. Really nice taste though, and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. I poured it from a bomber so the first glass went by pretty fast and I will have no problem finishing it off right after.

Not too much hoppyness in the taste as the smell indicated. A little coffee taste, but mostly chocolate. Mouthfeel: It's pretty thick, but not too much. Very little carbonation - I think it could have used a bit more. Drinkability: Pretty good, this never struck me as very heavy. I don't know what the ABV is, but it seems pretty low. Overall: I thought this was decent. I may have served it too warm, but there didn't seem to be a very strong body to this one. Chocolate came through the most, but it lacked bitterness.

664,73,biboergosum,4.13,"500ml bottle. I have shared this with every woman I have known since discovering it (including my mother), and to a one, they have been enamoured with it - just sayin'.  This beer pours a rather opaque black, with slight cola-hued edges, and a few fingers of very puffy and creamy brown head, which dissipates fairly slowly, rendering some spastic splotches of northward-reaching lace around the glass.  It smells of lightly roasted caramel malt, thick, rich dark chocolate syrup, like when you've squeezed the Quik bottle just a little too strongly, mildly toasted, oily nuts, and condensed milk. The taste is mildly bitter, dark chalky cocoa, a bit of understated morning coffee and its associated creamy adjunct, roasted bready caramel malt, a further toffee sweetness, like in those mirror-world UK candy bars, and a slightly tangy, fruity hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel is quite smooth, as expected, even though the carbonation is a tad higher (i.e., greater than zero) than anticipated, the oats kind of getting a raw deal. The body comes across as nice and full, giving a hefty gravitas to this reserved choco-beast. It finishes on the sweet side, the chocolaty milkiness lingering with serious intent.  With a more than reasonable ABV, this goes down oh so very, very well, even in the absence of a nice dessert.

On top a caramel-tinged, beautifully creamy, and dense nitro-assisted head that leaves brilliant curtains of lacing. Gorgeous presentation.  Aroma: Tons of milk chocolate and roasted malt. Not much else comes though, but that's okay.  Taste: Sweet, roasty malt with plenty of big notes of British milk-chocolate. Notes of toffee and coffee are also present, though in much lower amounts. There's a little hop bitterness towards the end to offer a bit of additional depth. Not thin, but not amazingly intense either. The aftertaste is sweet and roasty.  Mouthfeel: A body that's perhaps a little fuller than medium with smooth, light ""carbonation."" The ""carbonation"" level seems to be a little below the already low levels typical to beers served from a nitro-can, making it just a little flat. Coats the mouth a bit.  Drinkability: With moderate alcohol content, a relatively mild flavor profile, and a smooth mouthfeel this makes for a very sessionable brew.  Verdict: Young's Double Chocolate Stout is popular for good reason - it's a solid, sessionable Stout with a nice focus on chocolate flavors. As for whether it's better carbonated in a bottle or nitrogenated in a can, it's a tough call for me. While I certainly appreciate the smooth mouthfeel here, and feel that it compliments the flavor profile well, it just seems a little too flat to really top the carbonated version. It's pretty much a toss-up - but if forced to choose, I think I'd go with the carbonated bottle. I certainly didn't expect that!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Stavage,3.93,"Black. Holding up to light...black. Okay maybe dark caramel around the edges. The head is light chocolate brown and frothy, I get a nice big head which leaves a nice lacing.  Smell is nice roasted malts and grains, dark chocolate and a touch of strong espresso. Very nice.  Taste is nowhere near as chocolate as I was expecting from skimming through reviews but this is not a bad thing. There's all kinds of bitterness going on here. Theres the more grainy obvious overall bitterness of dark roasted malt which in itself consists of a dark chocolate bitterness and espresso bitterness. There's also a very very mild hops bitterness I think, but theres enough going on I'm not entirely sure what exact contribution the hops is making. Also the more obvious chocolate flavours of the added natural chocolate extracts are noticeable in the aftertaste. Has the same kind of astringency one gets with espresso or dark chocolate (or stouts!)  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Though lets be honest you want a good stout to be at least this smooth and creamy.  It's as drinkable as any decent stronger stout I've had. Pleasant sipping and heavy. There was no battle to finish it, though I certainly wouldn't entertain having a second.  Overall a very nice stout. Very solid contender that hit the mark.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,youngleo,3.43,"Poured to a big 3 fingered head. Head was caramel in color. Brew itself was almost black in color. Had some decent lacing that left thick rings around the side. Smelled of chocolate, a little hint of alcohol and burnt malt. Tasted like chocolate and burnt malt. The sweet of the chocolate was on the edge of being over powering. Left a sweet aftertaste in your mouth. Didnt feel thick in the mouth as you might expect. Carbonation I thought was good. This wouldnt be a good session beer.

Straight up chocolate, dark chocolate with a little milk chocolate also. Some deep roasted malts towards the end.  Mouthfeel - Not to thick, just right. Leaves a thin syrupy film in your mouth. Just lightly carbonated  Drinkability - Not a session beer for sure. To much flavor in there. A great dessert beer.

The thick chocolatey syrup is carried to the top by the abundant tiny bubbles, mixing with the more pale top half. Thick, rich, never-ending milk chocolate head. Smells just like hershey's chocolate syrup, and little else. Tastes just like it smells, with an addition of uber rich malt. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and fairly viscous, coating your mouth. Mine had very little carbonation, more carbonation would have definitely helped me enjoy this more. One was plenty enough for me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Palate carries a huge chocolate influence, perhaps one of the few beers that just is like chocolate itself and not a mere resemblance. Carbonation is not bad.  Finish is sweet, almost too sweet. Good dessert beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,biegaman,4.57,"On tap at Cole's in Buffalo.  Black marble with some mocha highlighting. Despite being afforded the odd sneak-peek at colour, Double Chocolate Stout is opaque and uncompromising to light. Its head is thick and predominant, in this case a consequence of the nitro-tap but similar observations are made from bottled samples. Lacing drapes downward like a water fall.  Here's a word of advice on Young's Double Chocolate Stout: let it warm up. It may seem an unusual recommendation to casual beer drinkers but ales (like wines) benefit from air; don't judge this one until you've given it time to breath a little. You'll notice a lot more chocolate flavour emerge.  The aroma showcases cocoa and chocolate. It is that simple. It smells like a finely conched Swiss milk chocolate and also imparts subtle hints of mocha and coffee. The chocolate comes in many forms: chocolate-covered wafers and biscuits are vividly sensed in the nose. Roasted dark (chocolate) malt can also be made out.  Each sip gratifies the palate with never ending notes of chocolate. Again, like a finely conched Swiss milk chocolate it is remarkably silky on the palate. Its texture is also quite biscuity. It has notes of bitter cocoa and mocha and also the impression of sugary hot chocolate powder; it is the epitome of bittersweet.  Young's have authentically replicated the flavour of chocolate like no other (with the only possible exception of Southern Tier's first batch of Choklat.) I don't know how they get it to taste this way, I don't know what they use, but I couldn't care less. I can't say enough - this tastes authentically like chocolate! And it's delicious each and every time I have it.  Few beers can procure flavour like Young's Double Chocolate Stout. It isn't complex but it need not be. If you have a sweet-tooth (or bittersweet-tooth) for high-quality Swiss milk chocolate then meet your match. There is something about this chocolaty biscuit profile that I seem to never tire of. I feel it deserves a spot right up there with the world's tastiest.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,iNHaze,4.37,"Pours very dark chocolatebrown/black with ruby highlights against very strong light. Had an OK head which didn't stick around too long, think I need to try this again from a nitro-can or nitro tap. Excellent lacing though.  Smells definitely of chocolate, both of chocolate malt and of actual dark chocolate, without smelling sweet. Also, a definite character of roasted barley in the mix.  Tinge of floral hops up front, but this is quickly washed away by a very smoky midsection, I'd assume from roasted barley. The smokiness in the middle warms you up to a nice, rich chocolatey malt character, and a lingering bittersweet dark chocolate finish. Has a very slight chocolate aftertaste. The charcoaly, oaky smokiness in the middle is actually very pleasant and helps to balance the beer, which manages to taste very much of expensive dark chocolate without being sweet.  Mouthfeel is actually on the light side, with definite sparkling carbonation on the tongue.  Very drinkable. You don't have to have a sweet tooth to appreciate chocolate, and this beer delivers on exactly that; CHOCOLATE. I've always been a porter/stout kinda guy, and this beer would be a great way to end a day.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Has 1.5"" of mocha-colored head that takes several minutes to recede, leaving nice sticky lacing clumps down the glass.  S: Has a typical stout aroma, but heavier on the chocolate (of course), with roasted malt and coffee coming in lesser quantities. Not a very pungent aroma though.  T: Dark chocolate, lightly sweetened and with a contrasting bitterness that blends well into the understated roasted malt and espresso flavors. And yet, the beer is not super-sweet. Not a strong flavor, either.  M: Medium-low carbonation that gives the beer a nicely silky, velvety feel. The flavor is not sticky, which is a plus when you're dealing with something that is purposely sweetened. But it's hindered by a slightly thin body.  D: This is a decent beer, and it comes at a decent price... That's about it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The head dies down a bit, but some foam on top sticks around, leaving great lacing.  S: Hints of chocolate and milky espresso.  T: Cappuccino and chocolate flavors, with a reasonable hop background. Nice, not too intense.  M: Smooth carbonation, on the light side of medium bodied.  D: Drinks easy, and has a pretty reasonable ABV. Could probably go through a lot of these.  This is a very good beer, and one I will purchase again in the future.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Appearence - 1/2"" thick head that is light and creamy looking, dark black and completely opaque.  Drinkability- Exceptional. I feel this would be paired excellently with some Black Forest Cake or strawberries. --  I feel this stout hit's its name pretty neatly on the mark and it lives up to the product the bottle is trying to sell.

Malty, toasty, yeasty...and of course chocolatey. But all in harmony. A very well sorted stout in that they let the chocolate take care of the bitterness that otherwise would have been provided by the hops. I feel that some of the IPA guys make a mistake here and end up with a hoppy mess. This is a smooth and balanced presentation that shouts chocolate without being overly aggressive or confining itself to a dessert niche. It is also very much a stout.  M - creamy with enough fine carbonation to keep it from too much milkiness.  D - The chocolate, though wonderful, is not an all night affair.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S: Roasted malts and a very slight chocolate aroma.  T: Very malty but thats about it. Not much to this beer. I did not pick up much chocolate and it was no where near as sweet as the name implies. Maybe I just had a bad bottle but to me it had a bitter and almost sour finish to it which doesn't seem in line with the majority of the reviews. Not much going on here.  M: Smooth and very thin. I was expecting a thicker and creamier texture. Carbonation was excessive.  D: Very smooth and drinkable. Not exactly what I was expecting in a beer of this type.

T - Incredible. Absolutely incredible. In fact, I like it so much that I feel that no chocolate stout, with the exception of Rouge, can even remotely compare. Considering this brew is a fraction of the cost of Rouge and tastes better its a God send for stout connoisseurs. I cannot even begin to explain the complex, rich nature of this brew. Delicious.  M - Somewhat thick, yet smooth and refreshing.  D - Far too good. I could drink this brew exclusively for the rest of my life without a doubt. However, I will admit that the bottled version of this brew does not even remotely compare to the nitro-can. Truthfully, if bottles are the only Young's available, I will choose the oatmeal stout over the double chocolate every time. This is because that in the bottle, double chocolate gains a bitterness that I dislike. Nevertheless, this is my all time favorite beer.

Powdered cocoa, sugar, and a little alcohol aroma. Surprisingly not as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Dark chocolate is definitely there, cocoa powder, some sugary sweetness. But, there's a lovely, smokiness that comes in early to cut the sweetness. Subtle herbal hops round out the flavors. Thick body. Motor oil consistency. Velvety smooth from the nitro widget.

After letting it sit out of the fridge for 5 minutes or so, poured from a 14.9 oz nitro can into my Sam Adams glass. Lacing blanketed the side of the glass.  Appearance: Dark brown, with an awesome cascading effect from the nitro, that slowly built up to two fingers of smooth, off-white head. The head lingered for quite some time.  Smell: Milk chocolate, a 'tang' like that in Guinness that I just can't place.  Taste: Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate, backed by only a hint of bitterness. A mix of bitter and sweet chocolate - mostly bitter up front, with a slight sweetness in the background. This one absolutely needs to be served warmer than fridge temperature to really appreciate all the flavors. Some roasted notes are in there as well. It's not a sweet beer though, and it's very easy to drink.  Mouthfeel: The nitro makes this incredibly smooth, but a tad thin. Feels just like milk, and it makes the whole thing taste just a little watery.  Drinkability: Very smooth, and very easy to put this one down. It's a great beer for people who don't like beer.

Smell is rich roasted sweet coffee/chocolate. Very powerful. Reminiscent of a hot cocoa or chocolate bar.  Taste is weet like a chocolate bar, back with malt. It is sweet throughout, but perfectly balanced, and bitter only at the very very end. Remarkably light for a beer this rich and dark - not overpowering in the mouthfeel at all. Lightly carbonated.

The 2 fingered tan head is thick and creamy with good retention.  A: Double Chocolate is right! Sweet, creamy milk chocolate dominates the nose, while roasted malts and coffee barely manage to put in their 2 cents.  T: Flavors are pretty much the same as the nose. Tons of sweet, rich chocolate that smothers the palate. Roasted malts are there along with some coffee, but nothing in this brew gives enough variation to the overwhelming chocolate. This tastes very one-dimensional with no depth of character to speak of. Just too sweet and cloying for me.  M: This almost feels too light and watery to be a stout. But if it were any fuller, that cloying sensation would be even worse. So, I guess the mouthfeel is at fault to a benefit.  Notes: This one is just too sweet and one-dimensional for me.

Dark brown, with lots of red and tan highlights when held to the light. About an inch or so worth of dense nitro head, light tan, not quite white. Excellent looking beer.  S: Nitro, bitter chocolate, almost a lactose sort of sweetness, the nitro really masks a lot in the nose, which is sad, but the underlying smells are pretty good.

The mouthfeel is very thin with medium/high amount of carbonation.  Overall, I really didn't like this beer. It seems very simple and not at all what I expected.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,badmandy,4.38,"Poured into a pint glass.  Rich, dark color with a tan head that melted down leaving slight lacing. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt. Light in the mouth with not much carbonation.Taste Is superb, with some hops at the front and rich chocolate throughout. Not too bitter. A beer you can drink all night if your up to it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CHL,4.4,"As a stout, this is mild; not heavy, only lightly roasted malt. The malt isn't terribly bitter, and the hops don't interfere with the incredible chocolate tastes, although both of these elements contribute complexity, along with trace fruitiness in every sip. Very smooth, very accessible.  I don't even like chocolate, but I think this is the best dessert-appropriate beer I've ever had. Love it with spicy food.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Brenden,4.41,"The color is a deep, rich dark brown. The nitro can pours an incredibly thick, fat head that leaves thick lacing evenly in the glass. Very nice. The smell is of rich dark chocolate right off with some toasty grains and sweetness. Taste is much the same with more malt and some hops presence coming in the forefront along with the chocolate. There's even just the subtlest underlying fruit in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is great: malty thick, amazingly smooth and rich with great body. Carbonation ends with less than it began with but gives a good feel overall. A prime example of a stout in itself with rich complexity. A must try.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Offa,4.78,"This is a declisious, full- bodied stout with a good smooth, rich feel and suprising complexity.  Almost black, it has a huge, dark brown head that shrinks very slowly and never vanishes, leaving good lacing down the glass.  The aroma is chocolate, toast, prunes and raisins.  It has a pronounced chocalate element, but this is not overpowering and the beer has good balance of sweet and bitter, chocolate, toast, and rich, caramelized fruit, especially prunes. The body is rich and thick yet amazingly lively and the finish refreshingly light but tasty and complex. The chocolate is noticeable but mostly adds a richness with a little chocolate element to the overall chracter, and thankfully does not overpower the drink. It thus retains a well-rounded, complex character with nice subtle notes.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TheHammer,4.43,"Appearance - Came in a puprle pry off bottle with a logo that resembles a ram. Poured with a solid thumb of creamy looking head the sustains and laces very well. The beer itself is a dark brown, nearly black as night, but I can see little bubbles of carbonation. I can't think of anything bad to say, as the only way it could be better is if it was poured with a nitro tap.  Smell - Chocolate dominates the experience, which isn't surprising considering the name. Smokey roasted malts are in the background, with a slight almost fruity hop undertone. It could be a bit more diverse, but it's great so far.  Taste - Very nice flavor, as it starts with a light chocolate and then blends seamlessly into a richer bitter chocolate with slight touch of coffee taste. The experience ends with a slight kick of the hops leaving a fruity chocolate aftertaste that is reminiscent of black forest cake. Just a slight bit too bitter for my liking, but it is a stout, albeit a far tamer one then normal.  Mouthfeel - Nice head, solid carbonation, goes down smoothly and leaves a nice subtle aftertaste that does not build as you drink more. My only qualm is sadly the carbonation starts to die down around the 1/3 left mark. Still I'm a fan.  Drinkability - This beer is quite light, even if it is a stout. It doesn't sit heavy on the gut, and it goes down quite smooth. However, is it a little bit sweet which would make me only want a couple and a bit too bitter to be that amazing. Still I'd gladly take one of these any day.  Final Thoughts - I think this is pretty much the best dark beer I've ever had thus far, be it stout, porter or dunkel. I find it even more pleasant then old engine oil. This drink I would recommend to anyone who isn't a big fan of darker beers but wants to try something new and give them a second chance. Thumbs way up on this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WakeandBake,3.95,"A super dark brown color with loads of light tan head,and lots of lacing when it finally receeds. Aroma of dark chocolate and almost burnt malt grain. Flavor is dominated by chocolate, both milk and bittersweet, with some coffee behind that and again the echo of roasted malt.

Very sessionable and fun to try.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,almychristopher,4.43,"this beer pours a pitch black color with only minimal highlights when back lit, the off white head is creamy and smooth as only the nitro can could produce, and seems intent on sticking around. the aroma gives a nice bit of chocolate malt considering the head, that said there isn't a lot else going on there. the taste follows with great chocolate flavor and a nice sweet finish. the full body and nice carbonation make this a beer I could drink to excess.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T: Definitely chocolate, but it's not too sweet and it doesn't overwhelm the underlying roasted stout flavors.  M: Nice and creamy, kind of like chocolate milk.

T- Nice sweet chocolate taste with hint of coffee and roasted malt.Minimal bitterness left at aftertaste  M- Very light,compared to other stouts, but still creamy and nicely carbonated  D- The sweet,light,and creamy taste help this to be extrememly drinkable  Overall this a great delicious stout that is like dessert in a nitro-can!!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,ElGrecoVerde,3.8,"A chocolate beer through and through. It even looks chocolaty.  Flavors are highly roasted and mostly sweet. It's more of a milk chocolate flavor rather than bitter dark chocolate, which is one of the only things keeping this brew from being among my favorites.

Milk chocolate to be exact. Little bit of coffee. this is a pleasant tasting beer.  M - For a stout, this is light, carbonation is a little to high as well.

664,73,Kendo,3.66,"A: Poured from the nitro-can into a pint glass. It does the whole cascading thing -- chocolate brown on top, cascading down to a black body. A tan 1-finger head rests on top. Leaves good lace down the glass.  S: Not much in the nose -- cocoa powder and some weak roasted barley malt.  T: Cocoa powder and chocolate over roasted malt, with a hint of coffee. Finishes with a slightly metallic, burnt char sort of dryness, but the lingering taste is still of chocolate.  M: Thin and light in heft, though a moderately creamy feel to it.  D: Very drinkable.  Notes: Years ago, before the advent/discovery of Rogue Chocolate Stout, Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence and, the ultimate, Southern Tier Choklat, I would've felt this was a great chocolate dessert beer. Now, my tastes have evolved to the fuller-bodied RISes and the more highly chocolatey goodness of those beers. As a result, this one's been knocked down a peg or two in my book.

A - A nitroed Double Chocolate Stout is the beer by which all others will be compared -- in terms of looks, that is.  S - Good smell. Nice roastiness, some of that choco-goodness. Very enticing.  T - Very good. Just the right degree of roastiness, some caramel, oatmeal, capped off by a kind of Cadbury chocolate in the nose. Sweet stouts best watch out.  M - Perfect.

T - this is an amazing dessert drink. the initial taste is a bit bitter powdered cocoa with some sweet malty/chocolate hints. the finish is more bitter cocoa, then the after taste is wholly a sweeter chocolate.  MF&D - the feel is too thin, the bottle was thicker, and more of a sipper than this. this is like a sweet guinness, with out any of the (lame) dryness. along that line, the beer is really easy to drink. the only thing that keeps it back from being a chugger is the sweet flavour, nor would i want to have more than two of these, I think.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

What beer doesn't look good from a nitro can or bottle or tap? The cascading effect is always fun to watch and there is always a nice perfect size frothy head that stays on the beer the whole time. The head on this one is a nice capuchino like head that stays about 1/2"" thick the whole way down the glass. Nice sticky lacing as well.  Smell is of sweet milky dark chocolate. There is like a roasted coffee/capuchino smell to it as well.  Taste is of semi sweet chocolate and an abundance of it. It has some nice roasted coffee flavors as well. The combo of the semi sweetness and the bitter chocolate and coffee flavors is nice.  Mouthfeel is a little low on carbonation but most Nitro beers are. It gives it a very smooth feel to it that is pretty nice.  All together a nice brew that will be enjoyed for a long time.

Light grassy hops.  T: Semi-sweet chocolate and roasty malt. Chocolate stays throughout and is joined by grassy hops and a dry hop bitterness. Vaguely reminiscent of semi-flat chocolate soda with roasty beer flavor and hop bitterness.  M: Velvety-creamy, though oddly light after the head was gone. Low carbonation and a bittersweet finish.  D: An all-around tasty beverage. Great with raisins. Healthier than a milkshake, and it tastes like beer! Great semi-sweet chocolate flavor balanced with hops. Not a session beer though.

Finish lasts about 5 mins; starts out strong with the roasted malt then progresses to bitterness (same bitterness as after drinking black coffee).  M: Light mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Very thin, very watery. Could have been better with some more body.  D: Tasty beer, the mouthfeel could be better but a very drinkable beer.  Overall I'd say this was a solid beer.

There is some underlying date and fig flavors along with the coffee and dark roasted malt. Sweetness borders on cloying, but the malt roast balances.

A - Huge three-fingered mocha foam that dissipates quickly and leaves a fair bit of lacing. Near-black dark brown color, with a touch of red-brown at the edges when held up to the light. Only the lack of retention keeps this one from a perfect score.  S - Smells like milk chocolate. There's the faintest bit of ""beer"" (malt barley) and dark fruits in the background. It smells good, but it's kind of a one-trick pony.  T - There's a bit more roasty coffee bitterness in the taste, while the chocolate is more of the baker's variety. The flavor is actually quite mild, and there's minimal aftertaste.  M - This is thin and quite carbonated - not a recipe for success in my book considering the style. There's a tiny bit of residual stickiness.  D - The low ABV, thin body, and solid flavor make this almost chuggable. I think the carbonation would get to me, but not until after a couple servings.

664,73,Jmoore50,3.53,"I had a bit of this with a buddy tonight who bought some. I was skeptical, and it turns out I was right in my prediction. Nothing special, doesn't even touch the taste of Rogues Chocolate Stout, even though there were some similarities.  The appearance was brown, not thick at all. I was expecting something like chocolate syrup, and what came out was a thin 'brown ale' type consistency. This was not a good start to what turned out to be an average brew.  The smell was hard to pin point. It smelled obviously like chocolate, but not like a good hearty chocolate like Rogue. It smelled like a crisp light chocolate with a bit of hops in the aroma as well. The carbonation, when poured, brought out the smells, but nothing overwhelming. I also smelled a buttery oat smell that got to my nostrils also.  The taste was average. Nothing punching me in the mouth. It is only 5.2% and the 'Double Chocolate' was an overstatement. Nothing came out to me in this brew. It was crisp, but not in a good way considering I wanted something gooey and the look of syrup. What they should do is add TONS of more chocolate and age it in a...bourbon barrel for a year and resell it, then it might be worthy enough for my tastebuds. Overall an average brew that I will not buy.  J",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Taste upfront has a slightly roasted coffee taste that is not really bitter at all, cocoa, milk chocolate, dark sugar, slight cola like taste. Goes down smooth  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation, very mellow and smooth with a slight dry coffee aftertaste that lingers for a couple minutes.

Once settled its a nice medium-dark brown with a one finger creamy smooth tan head.  Smell is non-distinct. Some roast malts, some chocolate and some booze but not a whole lot of anything.  Hard to get a clean first sip due to the awesome head retention.  Tastes like chocolate milk. Some roasted malt flavor comes in but mainly a sweet milk chocolate taste.  Ugh, I have a milk mustache thanks to this thing.  Clean finish with a dark chocolate and roasted malt aftertaste that balances well with the sweetness.  Fairly soft but noticeable carbonation, thick creamy mouthfeel just like chocolate milk.

Pretty balanced and flavors are quite tame.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The head holds nicely as I drink the beer and leaves a good bit of lace. Really nice look  The aroma is of milk chocolate. There may be a bit of caramel in there, but chocolate really dominates.  The flavor is up front with chocolate as well. I almost want to compare this to chocolate milk. Chocolate malt and caramel malt make an appearance, but the ""natural chocolate flavor"" really dominates.  The beer displays a nearly full body with a low amount of carbonation. Really smooth and creamy.  Overall, its a tasty beer.

A very great stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S..Certainly a chocolate presence, but I was not blown away by the scent.  T..The taste however, was incredible. ""Double Chocolate"" stout is correct; this beer is chocolate in a glass. Tastes of good quality dark chocolate, but not too sweet as to be like a dessert beverage or liquor. Good malt quality. This is what other chocolate brews should aspire to taste like.  M..A little light/thin, but certainly not bad. A heavier mouthfeel would be nice.  D..Easy to put away since the ABV is only 5%. I could make this a short-session beer.

It's creamy and rich and not at all ""watery"" like I've heard other people say. Sure, it's not as heavy as a typical stout, but that doesn't translate to a let-down. We've come to expect a more roasted or unsweetened-chocolate taste from our chocolate stouts, but Young's is a bit gentler, more rich and creamy.

Bitterness is firm but balanced. Thick creamy mouthfeel with a lingering roast/toast/bitter chocolate aftertaste that fades dry.

Lacing was there but not very notable. Appeared thinner than I expected but the creamy head made it look tasty.  S - CHOCOLATE - hence the name...  T - Once again...Chocolate. Very malty. Delicious. At times I forgot I was drinking a beer. Reminded me of the Molten Cake at Chili's (best dessert EVER). ABV is fairly low, and there is no indication of any alcohol at all in this brew...(might be a bad thing?)  M - The thinness kind of took away from the mouthfeel, but it was still silky and smooth. Wish it was a bit more full-bodied however.  D - Could put away a few of these, but im afraid the calories may be high (though I can't say for sure as I havent researched it.)

Roasted malts as well.  T- compared to the nose, the taste is kind of a let down. I was expecting something along the lines of Choklat from southern tier, but this falls short. It starts out like a chocolate tootsie roll pop, but the flavor ends abruptly and finishes rather bland.  M- too thin and watery for a stout. The carbonation level is very high as well. Disappointing.  D- more of a novelty that I would try to convert some non beer drinkers with.

I think the expectations and anticipations were raised after seeing the brew on so many dessert menus around the city.  Poured out not very heavy. Wasn't very sludge-like or thick. Smell was of the chocolate and roasted-malt flavors, but not very strong. Taste was a bit watered down. I really expected Young's to be a bit more sugary and heavy on the chocolate and sweet notes, but it just wasn't there. I was a bit taken a back. But then I guess that makes sense. Do you really want a super thick and heavy brew to drag down your light dessert?  Overall, I don't think it's the premier dessert/chocolate brew. It has great flavors and smells, but I think it has been greatly overshadowed by the likes of Southern Tier Chokolat and Redhook Double Bock.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Leaves behind thin but extensive lacing.  Smells deep and dark, with definite chocolate scent from both the actual chocolate and the chocolate malt.  Tastes a lot less chocolatey than it smells. The chocolate is very mild and there isn't a whole lot of taste at all to speak of. Much more bland than I had imagined.  Feels very thin in the mouth. Many stouts of this kind are thick and chocolatey, but this one goes down like a very light ale. There is quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue and definite hop bitterness in the aftertaste.  This is a fantastically drinkable beer, especially for a double chocolate stout. Very light and low in alcohol content.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Appearance: Dark brown, opaque, almost black in color. Pours with lots of head which recedes to thin layer over the beer and nice lacing visible. Persists for a very long time.  Smell: Chocolate shines through strongly, with a bit of malt background and a hint of hops which is almost not detectable.  Taste: Chocolate, almost like chocolate milk with a bittersweet aftertaste that hangs around for quite a while.  Mouthfeel. A bit thin but smooth and full, i.e., somewhat light in body, but the carbonation is also light and persistent.

664,73,thekevlarkid,4.18,"Off a nitro-tap at American Flatbread this beer was an opaque brown. The head was two fingers large and receded down to a perfect cap that left nice curtains of lacing down my glass. The aroma was purely of chocolate with only a hint of roasted malt behind it. The flavors were similar, dominated by huge chocolate, both milk and bittersweet, with some coffee behind that and again the echo of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was ultra-smooth, the body slightly watery and the carbonation delicate. If you like chocolate in your beer you have to try it, there are few better examples if any and it's rightly one of the best milk stouts in the world.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

But then the mouthfeel kicked in. It actually feels a bit too watery for my taste. After a few sips, it starts to taste and feel like a really nice ale... with chocolate milk flavoring added. You know, I really wanted this one to be a wonderful stout. I expected to absolutely love it. But I would pick a porter or an oatmeal stout over this one when I want a chocolate flavor.

Appearance - black and opague. Not a drop of light gets through. The carbonation provides a great creamy tan head that receeds to a thin layer with great crystalized web lacing all around the sides. If Guiness looks like a meal then this looks like a dessert.  Smell - sweet coffee, cocoa-chocolate (duh) and cherries. There's a touch of a dank aroma presumably from the hops.  Taste - similar to what you smell. It's not as sweet as I anticipated and has a slightly acidic-sour finish which I didn't expect. This acidic note gives it a tiny cola-like character finish.

It pours similiar to a Guiness. Let things settle down before trying.  The head is so thick, but smooth as you take your first sip. A rich creaminess, almost unexpected, hits you. The flavor is pleasant. A mild bit of roastiness comes thru first. Then, there is second wave of flavor in the back end; here is where you get hit with the chocolate. As the sip fades away in your mouth, the chocolatey essense passes in full forth, but never too sweet or overpowering.  A really enjoyable drink. As crazy as it sounds, there is a bit of Yoo-Hoo in the flavor. Not enough to scare anyone off, it is good. Quite drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

This is a smooth slightly sweet stout with no bitter aftertaste such as what you get from a Guinness (yeah, I know, a different class entirely, but I'm trying to draw a comparison of sorts).

A: It poured black as night with nothing more than a very thin layer of tan head, reminds me of Old Rasputin.  S: WOW! What a wonderful bouquet of nutty roasted grains, chocolate malt and a very obvious, out in the open, ""HEY LOOK AT ME!"" dark chocolate aroma. I'm looking forward to this!  T: Almost exactly what I expected. A mildly sweet stout with a very obvious cocoa overtone. Just lovely. Especially alongside a slice of devils food with a dark chocolate ganache frosting! (Trust me, I tried it. It really REALLY brings out the flavors in the brew and brings it to an entirely different level)  M: It strikes me as a little watery, albeit smooth and creamy. A mild carbonation and medium body, not bad.  D: Oh, my goodness... I guess I'm just not used to chocolate stouts! I've only tried a few stouts in general, and this came as a welcome surprise. When I drink dark beer, I expect something that'll put hair on your chest. This beer struck me as mildly sweet, chocolately, nutty, and absolutely delicious. I did note that it hits the palate a little watery, but I think it lends to the drinkability as some stouts tend to come on too thick. I could drink 3 pints of this in an evening after a slice of chocolate cake!  This was my first chocolate stout, and I'm intrigued. This has convinced me to try others like it. Highly recommended to those who normally find stouts too strong for their liking, as I found this a little mild for my taste, but still a fantastic beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Three plus inches of tan head build and settle quite slowly. Keeps a chunky head and leaves some splashes of stick here and there.  Smells of milk chocolate as well as some grain. The chocolaty note is there and is nice but it's a somewhat weak nose overall.  Taste also has some initial chocolaty flavor but then seems to go bland on me. There is some grain, as well, with a light sweetness, a bit of coffee and just a touch of bitterness. Not as much sweetness as you'd expect. It does improve as it warms and becomes a more flavorful. Finishes with some chocolate in the finish along with a bit of grainy bitterness.  Mouthfeel is pretty light, with a nice creaminess but it's a touch on the thin side. Could have a bit more body while maintaining the low abv and drinkability.  I've had this on tap before although this is the first time from a bottle.

Almost too sweet to drink. I thought, did they change this beer? So I picked up a bottle more recently to compare. The version on tap must have been messed up, as the bottled stout tasted more like I remembered. So the bottle is what I will review. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark brown color, bordering on black. Decent tan head, some lacing. Roasted barley smell. Very rich, dark chocolate stands out in the flavor. Dark and bitter to the point that it subdues the sweetness, in a good way. I like the fact that it's not overly sugary, but has a nice mix of sweetness and roastedness. Also a bit dry on the palate, so I would not describe this beer as creamy. Easy to drink, and low in abv.

Burly nose flush with chocolate, toffee, and pipe tobacco. Honest to goodness, if this doesn't smell like a sweet bag of Captain Black. Stellar.  Wonderful taste--chocolate, tobacco, molasses--and very smooth. Though technically a sweet stout, this has a decent bitterness to it. I wish the chocolate taste lingered in the mouthfeel as much as the aforementioned tobacco flavor did, but this is delightful--unique, flavorful, and definitely enjoyable.  I expected a lot more chocolate with this and, though that was present, it was more the balanced distinction of Young's Double Chocolate that caught me off-guard.

Some leafy hops and a bit of lactic milky sour/sweet flavor. A bit of metallic aftertaste.  M: Velvety smooth and creamy, with medium body. A somewhat dry, roasty finish.

Taste is chocolate, cocoa and roasted coffee malts.  Wish this was more full bodied, didn't seem all that thick and creamy to me...rather more thin and chocolaty. Maybe a little thicker as it warmed, which also brought out the creaminess a little too.  Little carbonation.  Very drinkable, and at 5.2% ABV...it could be possible.

664,73,Beer-Zombie,3.5,"pours up super dark brown with a small tan head. decent lacing too. the nose is dark chocolate, very dry, dark roasted malts. the taste is the same as the nose. the chocolate I taste is very dry and not sweet at all. crisp hops in the finish, med to full bodied, low to med carbo. a classic brew...",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Finkel,3.51,"When it's poured out, this beer looks spectacular. Not gonna lie: this is definitely one of the better looking beers I've ever seen. With a dark chocolate body and mocha head that looks as comfortable as a Temperpedic bed on steroids that only make it softer, I was extremely impressed. Lacing smothered the sides of the glass in very peculiar ways, which only intrigued me more.  The aromas of this brew were very, very simple. Semi-sweet chocolate essense and malt closing up the rear. That's it.  The taste was identical to the smell with a tiny hint of roasted flavoring. This beer is very blatantly uncomplicated and the brewers did this purposefully. You're not meant to drink this beer and think about for too long. It's meant to just be enjoyed (during desert would be ideal) for what it is.  Additionally, the beer was creamy in its texture. This beer really wasn't my style, and a bit hard to finish, but nonetheless, it was relatively enjoyable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DmanGTR,4.53,"A - poured pitch black with a massive 1.5"" fluffy tan head that retained well with thick lacing in a pint glass  S - dark chocolate, cocoa powder, expresso, hints of toast and molasses.  T - an immaculate blend of chocolate, toasted chocolate malts, coffee, and cream.  M - full bodied, lightly carbonated. Silky and creamy smoothness  D - Extremely drinkable. Enough said.  Overall - Surprisingly tasty and silky stout. The sweetness is not cloying in any way. A nice coffeelike bitterness with dark chocolate makes for excellent balance. A great appetizer beer or a dessert beer. I could probably see it as a session beer too. Reviewed from notes.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,KeefD,2.41,"Pours dark brown, almost black with purplish red highlights around the edges. One inch tan colored head and some nice lacing. There's a lot of carbonation bubbles sticking to the glass which gives it a cola-like appearance. Aroma is slightly sour at first, but notes of chocolate and bitter roasted malt bring up the back end of the nose. Taste is metallic, slightly sour, and only hints of dry dark chocolate, and some underlying roasted malt. I'm not sure how they call this a ""double chocolate stout"" as chocolate seems to be the furthest thing from the front. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. This is just not a good beer. The best before date is 6 months away and there was a nice hiss when I opened the bottle, so I don't believe it has gone bad. I think it's just not good. Maybe I'm just not crazy about British stouts in general. I would not buy this again, even though I only paid $2.50 for it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,instantlunch,4.45,Poured from a nitro can into a pint glass.  A: Very black. Can't see any light through it at all. Poured a perfect 1 inch light brown head and waves pulsed down through the glass.  S: Chocolate. Lots of it. Reminded me kinda of nestle quik. Smells like dessert.  T: Very chocolately. Slight coffee bitterness at the end but only a little. Very smooth.  M: Full thick but good. Like nestle quik.  D: Very smooth. Could easily drink a few.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Macca,4.45,Listen I love this beer. One of my all time favourites and I don't think I possess the words to do it justice.  It pours black with a huge solid beige head. It looks like a meal in a glass.  The aromas are of roasted malt and chocolate. Everything that I like in a stout but with that extra choc-iness that sets it apart.  Oh chocolate heaven. I seem to get to hits of it. A milk chocolate burst up front and then a more bitter darker wave later. Not sure which is from the malts and which is from the chocolate additive.  A creamy mouthfeel but I would like just a touch more. Perhaps a bit more Guinness like?  I really want to give this straight fives but I know that there is probably something better out there. Now I just need to find it!,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BierFan,4.02,Poured from a 14.9 ounce (440ml) nitro-can into a Samuel Smith pint glass.  Appearance: Black with a 1 inch creamy cappuccino colored tan head. Great head retention and lacing.  Smell: Roasted and coffee from the malts with a little bit of chocolate sweetness.  Taste: The taste is much like the smell except that the roastiness comes through a lot stronger in the taste. Mouthfeel is fairly full but desperately needs some carbonation.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,alovesupreme,4.2,"Pours with a marvelous head that sticks around for a while. Body is an opaque brown. Smells like a frappachino from starbucks, or a milkshake. either way not beer, but delicious none the less. This beer tastes fantastic, not to many beer characteristics, but great none the less. Chocolate, sweet milk drinks like a Friendlys fribble with whip cream. This is were im torn. Head is flawless, very rich and creamy, body on the other hand is rather watery and very thin. I understand this is not an RIS but even so... Fantastic beer that I will probably drink again in the near future. Those crazy Brits have done it again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AdmiralDiaz,4.01,"Very dark stout close to black but small traces of dark brown. A very nice tan head with good retention and a nice amount of lacing. Not a very strong smell. Smells malty with less of a chocolate scent than the name would lead you to believe. The taste is very similar to the smell, malty with a bit of chocolate and small amount of coffee bitterness. As the drink gets warmer the chocolate begins to emerge more as does the alcohol. It was nice to have a chocolate stout that wasn't overwhelmingly chocolaty. Not too thick with moderate carbonation. The drink changes a bit as you drink so it keeps it interesting. As said before its not too thick and not overpowering make for a very drinkable beer especially for the price! A no brainer to buy again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Grathan,3.88,"I really enjoyed drinking this. I could tell from the aroma when I first crakced open a can this beer was different. It almost smelled like candy. The whole nitro stout thing is very similar to the Guiness beer, but the taste is even creamier and the aftertase is kinda similar to milk chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jushoppy2beer,4.01,"This brew is aptly named, as it comes across about as chocolaty as you could imagine. It's an attractive beer, deep brown to black with a nice thick foamy light brown head that persists remarkably well and forms a solid layer down the sides of the glass. The aroma is chocolate. The thick mouthfeel helps to spread the sweet chocolate over the palate, but there is a nice slight hop finish that clears the palate a bit. Moderately drinkable, but I could not go for more than two at one sitting. Great brew for cold weather.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,nokes,4,"Poured into a flared pilsner glass...hey...it's what was available. Looked suitably stout-like with a reasonable tan head that bubbled down pillowy-like and mottled in colour.  Can smell the chocolate, and the roastiness...smells good. Not as chocolaty as I would have thought, though, given the name and the fact that ""natural chocolate flavour"" is on the ingredients list (albeit last).  As with the smell, the chocolate is pretty understated. I was expecting (maybe even hoping?) for a bit more. Balanced and even, though...a good beer. I like it, but it's not amazing. It feels nice in the mouth, smooth but not as full as I find myself wanting it to be. Not over-sweet or cloying at all...definitely good in that way. A person could drink a fair bit of this without any problem.  In general, I like it. A nice beer worth trying for sure.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,LordHammer,4.33,"Had two of these on tap at Jon's on South Street in Philly.  A: Solidly black with about an inch of cream colored head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass.  S: Mostly chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of roasted malts. Smelled delicious.  T: Exactly what the name would suggest. Chocolate out front, followed by a layer of vanilla, and then some coffee notes from the grains at the end. No discernable hops, which is perfectly fine.  M: Thick, as it should be, but not too heavy to be drinkable.  D: I had two, and could easily done several more if not for having to go to a concert.  In all, a lovely beer that is all it claims to be. Definitely something I'll have again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,joerodiii,4.05,"I first had this beer on tap last July and was blown away by the chocolate flavor. It seemed to be missing from the can, though.  This beer poured dark with slightly less head than I would have expected from a nitro beer -- prpbably due to the fact that its temp was about 34* when I poured it. It had an inviting aroma, ever-so-slightly roasted with some chocolate. (Much less chocolate than expected).  I could easily see this being a session beer as it was not too much of anything, not too sweet, not too bitter, not too chocolatey, not too ""roastey."" Overall, a well balanced stout with a moderate amount of chocolate. I look forward to drinking it again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Formed a creamy light tan half inch head with a continual cascading effect. Moderate lacing.  Smell is raosty chocolate and slight noble hops.  Taste is interresting. Much like a dry irish stout with chocolate undertones. Roasty, crisp and dark chocolate with a clean finish. The creamy head is a bonus.  Full bodied and very drinkable.  Enjoy!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Wackyfoot,4.75,"Maybe the best palate of any beer I've ever tasted, just creamy chocolate with a hint of coffee and malt behind it. Tastes like a candy bar or maybe hershey syrup.

664,73,ruckus232,4.25,When poured into the glass this had a really dark brown color with a nice frothy head.  The smell had a coffee/roasted scent but with a nice hint of sweetness.  The taste was very similar to the smell but the best part was how it had a very smooth feel in your mouth. It was not flat but it had a mild carbonation which gave it a great feel.  This had a really nice flavor and feel but was filling so probably would be best in small amounts after a meal.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Delicious toasted malt and chocolate flavors, almost creamy. Cocoa flavor comes in the second wave and finishes nice and clean. Wonderful stuff.  Mild carbonation allows this to coat your mouth. Nothing cloying or off. Again, a well made brew. Overall, you can kill a 6 of these and enjoy each to the last drop. Fine brew overall.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

I got a lot of dark and milk chocolate.  Taste: Delicious. I would want this with dessert for sure! Its good by itself as well, its nice and focused. Its got tastes for dark chocolate, a little bitter cocoa and coffee aswell. I taste sweet roasted grains and malt too.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and medium viscosity.

Light chocolate brown descends and becomes a darker brown with a thick thick, foamy light tan head (so much prettier than Guinness haha). Aroma of nice bitter chocolate, tootsie roll.

Billowy head with tons of lacing down the side of the glass.  Hints of dark roasted malt, mild coffee, and chocolate dominate the nose and flavor profile. Hops are well balanced with the malt and are barely noticeable. The body is medium-thin.  Very drinkable chocolate stoudt that you could session with.

664,73,khiasmus,4.14,"Invert-poured into a pint. beautiful cascade and tight head just like a Guinness. Body is pitch black, and of course the head is perfect and leaves a solid sheet down the walls of the glass.  Aroma, once again much like a Guinness- not a whole lot gets through that mammoth head. There's a bit of sweet cream, just a hint of chocolate, and some roasted grain, but it's all muted, like someone calling you through a rolled up carpet.  Flavor has some good stout elements, hints of roasted grain, and a good bit of lightly bitter chocolate. The sweetness is almost that of lactose, like a good cream stout. A bit of earth hints at a hop presence in the finish.  What can one really say about nitro mouthfeel? It's almost like cheating. So smooth and creamy, you'd think it was a double chocolate pudding instead of beer, and yet it's very slightly dry in the finish... which makes it ridiculously drinkable.  This beer is better than I remembered. Do yourself a favor and pick some up. Very well crafted and great for people that have only had Bud and say they ""don't like beer.""",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Wow! maybe there's something to this little widget! The aroma is of faint roast. It's a bit muffled from the dense head. This beer always serves as my personal high mark for how good the palate of a beer can be. It's the smoothest thing ever. It's like drinking a melted chocolate bar.

A little bit of roasted bitterness in the end. The feel is a tad thin for a stout but has an excellent silky texture, carbonation is soft. The stout is sweet but not dessert sweet.

664,73,KickInTheChalice,3.93,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Dark, nearly black. Upon pouring, it leaves a decent size oatmeal colored head, which surprisingly does not stay very long. There is a small lace decorating the glass as I drink it through.  Smell: A lot weaker than I would have imagined, given the ""Double Chocolate"" name. The smell does not even suggest that much chocolate. It is caramel, roasted malt, chocolate, and a very small amount of espresso, in that order.  Taste: I found the taste to be rather pleasant. The malt is what hits me first, with a roasted, nearly burnt malt taste. Then a quick dose of caramel. Chocolate finally bursts through but is not an overwhelming flavor. There is a little bit of coffee or espresso at the end, as the hops give it just a slight kick. The subtlety is a pleasant surprise; it has a great, smooth, chocolaty taste, but I am able to grasp the other flavors as well.  Mouthfeel: Relatively low carbonation, but this is one very smooth beer. If the intent was to make this smooth and creamy to emulate a milkshake, this was a success.  Drinkability: This is a stout that is light enough to have a few, with a flavor that would expect you to. A good tasting stout, and definite props on the smooth chocolate taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Lacing, however, is totally out of control on this one.  Smell - chocolate is there, as you would expect, but not nearly in the front of the odor; primary smell is alcohol, then a cocoa scent.  Taste - chocolate, then chocolate, then alcohol bite, then more chocolate going down and a blooming chocolate after taste. The chocolate flavor is similar to the chocolate of a good milk shake; probably the fact that the best milk shakes are malted.  Mouthfeel - is fine. Beer goes down smooth, and is comfortable in the mouth. Given the taste, a *more* smooth texture might be expected, but then again, this isn't a milk shake, it just tastes like one.

The head is so whipped creamy, light and fluffy, off white in color. 1 finger thick of retention, with thick all around cover laceing the entire surface of the glass. Black as night in color.  Aroma of a cocoa poder mix, chocolate cereal grains and hints of lactose like dairy aroma.  Mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy, with little to no carbonation. Its like drinking whole milk, same texture. Starts sweet, switching quickly to a Bitter chocolate upfront with a metallic water flavor. Smoked peat porter likeness in some of the flavors, hemp hop flavors, finish dry and bitter with coffee and chocolate going back and forth over my tounge.

Smell: A nice aroma of chocolate and roasty aroma. A hint of yeast, esters and bready elements also appear. This one has a fudge brownie aroma throughout with a nice sense of bite with the alcohol tinge.  Taste: Mmmm.. this is like chocolate milk! Nestle chocolate milk, with a nice hint of dark roasted malt and hint of spice. It sounds bad but a little kid could have created something like this, almost like mixing Nesquick with carbonated elements. But what an enticing brew nonetheless.  Mouthfeel: Decently carbonated, felt nice in the finish with the taste, not too overbarring, this brew is light to medium bodied yet has a great complexity on the tongue.

S - Smells roasted like any typical stout, but no hint of chocolate whatsoever. Didn't really like the smell on this at all. Didn't smell bad, but didn't make me want to dive right in.  T - Slight roasted bitterness, and now the chocolate is coming through in the taste. Tastes like a beer chocolate milkshake, very drinkable.  M - Creamy mouthfeel due to the nitro, I don't mind nitro though. Turns a lot of people off, but it really helps this beer in my opinion. Wouldn't mind doing a side-by-side with the nitro and the bottled version of this beer.  Notes: Great session beer, something I could drink all night long. I know it's a different style, but I session Guinness often, and this kicks Guinness's ass.

Like a nestle kiss, the chocolate smells almost artificial. It's not horrible. I just wish that it wasn't so sweet. On the other hand, the experience is fairly clear early on.  The taste is a tad sweet but better than the smell. There are some good beer flavors, malts, hops, pushing the chocolate forward. The finish is surprisingly dry, almost acrid in a not unpleasant way.  The feel is, sadly, a bit thin. There's not enough creaminess to it. I would love to have one on tap at some point for a point of comparison. The drinkability mostly suffers for me because of the feel. It's just not something that I really would ever want a second glass of. It's not bad, but it's definitely dessert beer and not dessert flavors in a main course beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,gameface23,2.96,Bottle. Pours very dark brown with a thick tan head. Weak aroma of bitter chocolate. The taste was like chocolate coke or doctor pepper with chocolate syrup added. Both the aroma and the taste was somewhat lacking. It seemed to have very high carbonation. The entire experience reminded me of drinking soda.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Guzzler78,4.03,"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. A nice 3/4 inch creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and a nutty hint.  Taste great. Roasted malt flavors as well as chocolate and vanilla. A somewhat bitter finish like chocolate flavored coffee.  Mouthfeel is creamy with a nice rich roasted feel.

T - Up front you get some bitter chocolate and coffee with a hint of vanilla. Sweet, but not overly so. Smooth finish with a little bite at the end, and not much aftertaste.  M - Creamy, rich, and smooth.  D - Great drinkability here, but the richness would probably limit me to no more than 2 per sitting.

664,73,treble,4.07,"I poured from a bottle into a pint beer mug, although I also have had this from the can. This beer looks like many stouts, it's very dark in color, brown almost black, and the head is tan, fluffy, a couple fingers wide. The head never completely disappears as you drink but a ring of foam remained til the end. Very sparse lacing, oddly.  The smell of this beer is really nice...wow! Definite cocoa, smells like hot chocolate mix a little, sweet, and with hints of coffee. It doesn't really taste as sweet as it smells, though, there is quite a tinge of bitterness, more of the coffee flavors come through. Not bad, I don't exactly want my beer to be sweet like a hershey bar, but this could be smoother, less tangy.  Not bad mouthfeel, the liquid itself has a kind of creaminess, like a milk stout, but the carbonation throws it off. I liked the consistency more toward the bottom of my glass when the majority of the bubble were tapped out. They are too big, in my opinion, I feel in this area, also, things could've been a little smoother.  The beer is drinkable. It's not offensively chocolate-y and I could drink a couple of these, not a ton of them, but really good drinkability, especially with mexican food or barbecue.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,donkeyrunner,3.38,"Pours a large, whispy coacoa colored head. Spotty lace all the way down. Smells of sweet chocolate, toasted malt and warm milk.  Mainly tastes of milk stout sourness, sweet dark chocolate and chocolate malt dryness. Thin body and a coffee mouth dry finish. Bitterness becomes less pronounced as the beer warms.  Good, but I was expecting something grand. The prominent bitter, sour, and sweet seamed to combat each other rather than unify the taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Taste is as the description says, chocolaty. There is a nice toasted malt flavor as well. I actually expected this beer to be sweeter, but it is quite nice as is. A hint of earthy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat of a disappointment, I really do not like nitro, the beer tastes rather flat. Drinkability is good though, an entire 16oz can is nice, but I personally find that to be enough, as the chocolate does begin to tire you.

664,73,Yimosan,4.25,"Excellent chocolate stout!  Color: Tootsie roll dark with a thick and creamy beige head.  Aroma: I definitely get the chocolate, caramel, and malt candy. It reminds me of a combination of Rolos with Whopper chocolate malt balls.  Flavor: Dark chocolate, not sweet at all...kinda like Mexican mole.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, it coats your mouth nicely and the finish is fairly long.  The low ABV makes it real easy to drink.

S: Dark chocolate and a little bit of dried fruit, smells sweet like a chocolate milkshake. T: Dark chocolate, a little bit of roasted malt provides a counter to the sweetness. The yeast definitely left a bit of sugar behind. The roasted malts and their astringency become more apparent as it warms up. M: Creamy, rich, mouth-filling, smooth, slightly drying on the tongue, a low level of carbonation. D: Goes down very easy, reminds me of a warm/melted chocolate milkshake. Doesn't come across as ""heavy"" or filling. This would probably be a great introduction to stouts for someone who ""doesn't like dark/heavy beers"".

There was a nice balanced sweetness that was just perfect!  M- Smooth and creamy. The texture was medium to full bodied.  D- Highly drinkable. Almost a sessionable beer considering the lower abv.

Beautiful carbonation action and foamy head, with great retention during the drink, due to the nitro widget. Aroma is of chocolate, vanilla, blueberry sweetness. Mouthfeel is not as heavy as it looks, with no carbonation. Taste is vanilla and roasty bitter chocolate up front, with some fruity sweetness detectable toward the back, a very smooth finish with little bite. Drinkability is extremely high due to the smoothness.  This is a great beer. As a craft beer enthusiast whose gateway beer was Guinness Draught, I particularly enjoy this beer since all the characteristics it shares with Guinness are enhanced.

Thick, Thick, Thick head that NEVER leaves. Incredible!!  Very good stout that lives up to its name. I love the bitter chocolate taste which is not too strong. Really good!  The beer is very thick and smooth. Not overpowering but just the right feel. I like that fact that this is a bitter Stout instead of a sweet stout. Too often, American Chocolate stouts mess this up. Too sweet. Great approach.  The only thing that I have a problem with is the fact that this beer is so thick and rich, there is no way I would be able to drink more than 2 of these in one sitting. Like a desert drink.  I will for sure have another one of these in the near future. Excellent.  In my book, beats Rogue Chocolate Stout hands down. Not as sweet.

664,73,atomicbolt,4.01,"Split a bottle of this with a friend. This was my first chocolate stout, I had high expectations and Young's delivered.  Looks yummy right from the pour. Very dark brown, almost black, with a big, thick topping of brown head. Smells pretty good - some chocolate, like you'd expect, with some typical stout roastiness and coffee. Still, not the big whiff of chocolatey goodness I was hoping for.  It's got a really nice taste to it, and just like I was hoping for, a big hit of chocolate. Creamy, smooth, roasty bitterness like a good stout, and then that sweet chocolate and coffee taste. I was expecting a big, thick milkshake-level mouthfeel, but it was actually quite thin. The plus side is that it makes it very drinkable, as I could see myself easily pounding back a few of these (well, if they were more widely available around here). Still, I could have hoped for more thickness and creaminess to make this into a real treat.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The beer pours a thick rich brown-black with a dense creamy head that stays to the bottem of the glass. The aroma is rich of chocolate and malt with a slight hint of sweet milk. Minor vanilla notes come through towards the end. Flavor is ultra rich chocolate with a toasty roasted malts tht give way to a slight balance of hops that dry out the sweetness just a bit. The balance is dangerous because its not so sitcky sweet like some of this style that it impeed drinkability. Super smooth in the mouth, thick and creamy all the way to the bottem of the glass. It goes down so smooth its easy to keep drinking this beer. 2 of my favotite things: beer and chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Initially I thought there would be intense chocolate on the nose, but it did become more evident as the stout warmed up. T: Wow, all chocolate initially...like a chocolate sundae, then came the burnt smokey flavours. Some cocoa bitterness, but no real hops bitterness. Tasted more like a porter. M: Smooth, creamy, very carbonated...not that stout thickness, more watery than expected. D: For a stout this was a good lolly drink, very easy to have more than one, light & not viscous.

664,73,stephens101,3.27,"Had this on tap at Mcnellie's Pub, midtown OKC. Pours black with shades of brown barely coming through. It's topped with a two-finger creamy tan head that lingers and lingers, being kept alive by the insane carbonation bubbles that rise from the middle of the pint glass to the head. This goes on for about 3-4 minutes until finally the head starts to recede but sticks around somewhat even as you drink the sucker down. Thick stripes of lacing are left when all is said and done. Damn, it's a beauty, but there's not much going on aromatically. Some roasted malts are noticed. Tastes of dark chocolates, but not as bold as expected, being a ""Double"" Chocolate Stout. I might have approached this expecting something else. Some cinammon and nutmeg are involved though, with some redemptive hop goodness in the end. This is a very full-bodied brew, that just happens to be drinkable as well. Not much more I can say.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A - Nearly opaque with the edges giving way to light. Ruby red highlights surround the center as if it were a gem. Incredible straight line separates the head of the beer from the body. Just an all around good looking stout.  S - Sweet milk chocolate, herbal, earthy hops and just a hint of roasted and caramel malts. It's kinda lacking in the roasted aroma but makes up for it when it comes around in the background.  T - sweet milk chocolate, roasted grains and an ever so slight herbal hop charecter that brings this beer together. Low coffee notes, rich in chocolate and caramel sweetness.  M - smooth as silk, glides right down without being cloying or viscous.  D - the sweet charecter of this stout, i imagine, could be distracting after a few.

S: Smells strongly of both milk chocolate and dark chocolate, almost the smell of walking into a candy store or chocolatier. T: Taste is also of milk and dark chocolate. The dark chocolate taste gives way to a coffee-like bitterness and finish. M: Coats the mouth and goes down smooth. D: A bit thick and sweet to drink to many, but would probably have a couple.

S- Roasted malts and chocolate with the chocolate being the dominant aroma. Almost milk chocolate smelling.  T - A very bittersweet chocoalte taste at first but becomes much more complex as it warms. Very important to let this one approch room temp before drinking. Once warmed the tastes are as follows: A sweet roasted malt taste up front before a wave of simisweet chocolate with hints of bitterness washes over the tongue.

I walk by this beer every time I am in the beer store. Went to the store with my fiancee and she asked about it. I told her what I thought and she asked if we could split it anyway. So I went ahead and picked it up. We split the bottle at her apartment. This beer is much better than I remember it. Pours a deep brown with a creamy head. Smell is exactly like sweet chocolate.

The chocolate malt aroma jumps from the glass as some earthy fragrances, perhaps something woody.  WOW! At first sip, I noticed strictly roasted malt, but the second the beer hits the middle and rear of the palate, the chocolate sweetness erupts. There is just a hint of smokiness and hops, but very faint.  Thinner mouthfeel than the appearance would suggest, nice and creamy and light in carbonation.

Bubbles explode at the top and the head retains quite well. Some lacing as well.  SMELL: Sweet smelling pure chocolate. Some malted barley but not much. Aroma is not overly strong, but smells good.  TASTE: The pure chocolate is there and in the right amount. Some roasted barley malt is there as well, but the chocolate and malt is more noticeable in the aftertaste, which seemed to be delayed longer than most. It's quite chocolaty and tastes very nice.  PALATE: Medium body, thinner than expected actually, but goes down smooth. A little sticky.  DRINK: The chocolate is there and it tastes exactly what you think it would taste like, but it's not overwhelming. Very drinkable.

664,73,PerzentRizen,4.07,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is a great beer with plenty of character. I think this one suffers for me because the chocolate flavor is not derrived from the malt, but from actual dark chocolate that is added to the brew. I think many other breweries are able to gain a deep, rich, frothy, chocolatey character to their chocolate stouts without actually putting chocolate in the beer.  I poured mine into a duvel tulip glass. The head was around 1 inch then dissapated to nothing - not even lacing was found. I had this one out a bottle, but I have had the same out of a nitro can. I actually think the Nitro can does better, although I rarely think this.  The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and honey. If I already did not know better I would say this beer is going to be sweet. I is surprisingly less sweet than many other chocolate stouts and almost every oatmeal stout.  The flavor is good. It is much less rich from a bottle. I think this beer can be served just a few degrees below room temperature; otherwise the flavors hide and you will not taste the complexity of this decent beer.  The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy when warm but thin and watery when cold. Again, serve this beer near room temperature for best results. The finish is smooth chocolatey and the best part of this worthy stout. At 5.2% this beer is highly drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JayQue,3.9,"Good looking stout. Dark brown, dense no light getting through. Medium size tan head with spotty sheets of lacing. Head retention is about average. Head and smell together reminds me of a milkshake  Nice smell of semi sweet chocolate and malts. Tastes pretty good. The chocolate is pleasant without being overwhelming or too sweet. Probably has something to do with the balance between malt and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin. A lot of stouts, including Guinness are a bit thin but between the smell and initial sip, I think I was looking for a milkshake here.  Drinkability is good. If this beer was thicker and had a more pronounced or sweet chocolate taste, I would probably mark it down for drinkability.  A good dessert beer or to accompany snacks.

The taste is of chocolate,coffee hints and roasted malts.A bit of sweetness. The feel was thin,light carbonation and a light body for the style. Mild bitterness in the finish ,but really smooth. I will say that it was quite creamy and that was good.  Notes: It was just not what I expected,so watery and thin.

664,73,TheycallmeTim,4.46,"Nitropour at Jimmy's No. 43 into a nonic imperial.  A--Holy crap is this a beautiful beer to look at. Solid still black, looks like a painting of a beer, like the body is a solid more than a liquid, when you behold it. Head has no air in it to speak of, and is three solid fingers of tan creamy goodness. The cap was built like a Warwick shithouse, and went nowhere for the entire tasting. To say there was lacing is like saying there's foam on your car when you wash it.  S--Typical wet malt with caramel and some sour behind what is predominantly a pronounced candy corn aroma. Weird but true, and I'm not even saying this because the cold weather is coming on.  T--Like a cross between toffee bark and ice cream made from dark Belgian chocolate. Basically a toblerone on LSD. An unholy experience not soon forgotten. Other than that you get some bitter metallic on the finish, but just a hint.  M--Fantastic. A milkshake with nearly zero carbonation and as it warms it switches from heavy water to mother's milk.  D--Could take two at a time, as it's not sweet so much as richly good. Drink this with a plate of gravy and some steaming Yorkshire pudding.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,wiseguy142,3.23,"Pours with a really impressive creamy, rich, thick old paper colored head. There are some initial downward shooting nitrogen bubbles but they quickly give way to a relatively inactive black mirth. As I drink it I basically get a thick, constant coating of lacingo along the glass. I think I would have enjoyed maybe a little more ""brownness"" out of the color to really give me that chocolate feeling. Aroma is sort of like chocolate covered blueberries- fruity and chocolately. Really really low carbonation. Sort of a weak, non-assertive stout flavor with some faint chocolate notes. A little bitterness in there as well which is about the only thing going on in there that really catches your interest. Otherwise fairly watery. Mouthfeel is of course extremely smooth, as is normal for the style. I don't think the nitro can is doing it justice in terms of carbonation though- I'd just like to see a little more going on there.  All in all this is obviously extremely well made, I just happen to find it slightly underwhelming.

Very nice  S- Got a lot of cap-metal smell but Ill try to ignore that. sweet roasted caramel malts and sweetened chocolate.  T- Taste was very good but I would prefer something a bit more ""upfront"". Some chocolate and alot of sweetness. Very palatable Im sure this would be good for even a non-beer drinker.

664,73,dnichols,4.13,"A: It was dark and creamy with a moderate tan head that retained well.  S: It was chalk full of dark and chocolate malts. It had an underlying milky aroma reminiscent of a chocolate latte or heated chocolate milk.  T: It had a sweet chocolate flavor with hints of dark bitter chocolate. The dark roasted malts were dominant. The alcohol was well hidden.  M: It was a thin to medium bodied brew with little carbonation and a wet bitter finish.  D: It is a nice medium bodied brew with pleasant flavors and a low ABV making it a decent candidate for a session brew. However, the sweetness might cause one to cut the session short in favor of a less milky sweet beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

D: I would try this beer anytime, I am not sure what kind of food I would drink this with.

Lacing is much more impressive.  The nose is light, but unmistakeably cocoa powder.  Taste is very chocolately, much like a cup of instant cocoa. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, for a milk/sweet stout. Drinkability is up there, as you could enjoy several of these in an evening, just relaxing and having some nice dark chocolate with it.  This is definitely worth picking up, and enjoying on a cold Winter evening, along with some dark chocolate.  Na Zdravje!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,eweneek83,3.78,"Appearance: As with most stouts, it has what at first appears to be a jet black color. When looking at it up to a light, there are more shades of dark ruby and brown. The head is a dark tan color; head formation, retention, and lacing are all excellent.  Smell: The dark chocolate scent is quite strong; it sharply pierces the nostrals. The roasted barley is also noticable, but the chocolate smell is most dominant. Maltiness also compliments these aromas nicely; it's not too strong, but adequate.  Taste: Wow - a chocolate stout that actually tastes like chocolate! You can really tell that the flavor is actually *dark* chocolate and not a just *chocolate* knockoff. The bitterness is relatively tame for a stout, but the malt flavors compliment the dark chocolate tones nicely. The flavor is full and well-balanced - an excellent stout specimen.  Mouthfeel: It's not quite as thick as a standard stout, but it's still pretty creamy and a bit chunky. It just sits really well on the tongue and teases the palate.  Drinkability: Since it's not incredibly heavy, this beer goes down quite easily - even for a stout. The brew is easy to throw down at both cold and room temperatures. It's obviously more enjoyable at the warmer temps, but it's hard to be disappointed.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JRed,4.23,Opaque looks with creamy dark head makes this brew very appealing. Sweet chocolate aroma is welcoming after a filling dinner. A beautifully delicious dark chocolate flavor that is rich and a bit creamy. This is a wonderful Godiva swamp that feels amazing to dive into at the end of a day. The essence of mouth-watering dark chocolate is captured wonderfully. This is a fantastic dessert beer that is as rich as it is satisfying.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,vancurly,3.48,"Pours a dense, deep, dark glass, heavy beige head and lacing. Chocolate is the dominant note of course. Bottle states chocolate malt and chocolate essence.

664,73,MP72,4.47,"Poured into a Bass Ale Tulip Pint glass this is one black brew with a nice tan head.  The smell of chocolate is pretty evident.  Taste is not as sweet as one would expect but the chocolate does make a bold appearance and more so as it warms.

Drikability is very high , I really enjoy this beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Greggy,4.13,"A- Pours an ultra creamy sticky head over a black body. The body has an amazing cascade effect due to the can widget. The head really stays put and doesn't recede much.  S- This has a serious chocolate, almost milk shake on the nose as well as a big vanilla cream, slight caramel and graham. (Think smores).  T- Notes of dark chocolate, cream, slight graham, and a mineral component dryness in the finish.  M- Due to the nitro, the beer comes off a bit thin in the taste department, but the trade is an ultra creamy mouthfeel. Zero carbonation.  D- Overall, I enjoyed the taste of this better in the bottle, but the appearance really was better in the can. If I were to buy again, it'll be in the bottle. Regardless, this beer is pretty drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Pencible,4.13,"This poured pitch black with tan head. It smelled surprisingly mild and earthy, like bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. It tasted like dry cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate and earthy malts, and a bit of pine hops. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had an oily and sweet aftertaste. Overall this was very much a dark ale with bitter chocolate flavoring, rather than a thick and rich stout. However, this dry character allowed for more subtlety, and made it very clean and drinkable. Not as delicious as I hoped, but very well constructed.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,rjimlad,4.25,"Pitch black with a thick tan head that was quite persistent. Awesome aroma with a chocolate/Nutella thing happening. I immediately wanted a Ferrero Rocher.

The head also sticks around for the duration. Good clingy lace on the glass as well.  Smell is sweetness: a little malt and a lot of chocolate. Smells like cocoa powder. Taste is roasted malt and then the sweet chocolate takes over. No dark chocolate/bitterness is present. It's all sweet milk chocolate.  Mouthfeel is really my only complaint about this beer. Very, very watery on the palate. However, it does have a milkshake-like finish to offset the thinness. Drinkability is way high.

Light roasted malt up front with sweet chocolate and mild hop bitterness.  m: mouthfeel is absolutely ideal. Smooth as can be and as creamy as a milkshake.  d: dessert in a can. a world-class sweet stout that delivers the chocolate in spades. This is one beer that deserves it's reputation.

664,73,dancinwillie,3.65,"When poured, this looked like a deep, rich brown. However once in glass, dark black. Dense, cratered, rocky head, that drops to a tight covering, leaving some attractive lacing.  Aroma is chocolate and a bit of a roasted scent, that I associate with porters.  Velvety chocolate coats my tongue. Very rich, and creamy. Also some of that roasted scent translates into more of a bittersweet taste. I don't notice much hops, but doesn't really detract from the taste. This one is not too sweet, the bitterness seems to come from the malt, but I could be misinterpreting that. A somewhat chalky taste on the finish is a little distracting, but not entirely unpleasant. I have tasted this beer a few times before, but this is the first time I've tasted any chocolate, I'm sure due to the fact that I quit smoking around a month ago. Way better than I remember it.  Mouthfeel is a little thin. Also the carbonation seems like if it was lower, the beer would only benefit.  I wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting, and probably won't drink one on its own anytime soon. I may try and pair this up with a desert, nothing with too much chocolate though, as that might be a bit of overkill.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The coloring is a really dark brown, closer to black. You cannot see through this beer. Good sign.  The aroma is strong with chocolate. There is a malty scent, with vanilla and mocha. No hop scent is immediately available.  Obviously, tons of chocolate on the taste. Chocolate (dark) on the initial taste, not even mellowing as the flavor goes on. Also, maple, vanilla and butterscotch are there as well. Very malty flavor.  The mouthfeel is the only detractor. It feels overly fizzy and lacking of body for being such a dark beer. Better than most, just surprising for this type of beer.  Overall, it is a great drink.

664,73,TheVrolok,4.4,"Appearance: Pours dark brown/tan but settles to a dark black once the massive beige cascading ends. Upon pouring you can expect even an inch of beige foaming head with some lacing that will quickly settle.  Smell: A sweet roasted chocolate smell with a hint of bitterness to help balance things.  Taste: Rich, sweet chocolate throughout, a bit of roasted coffee and bitterness toward the end balances out the sweetness of the chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, minimal carbonation, smooth, soft. Maybe a bit watery at times, especially after its warmed up a bit.  Drinkability: This is more like a session beer for me, with how creamy/rich it is I don't sit and chugs these. At the same time, I think it gets a bit watery/more bitter as it warms and I don't care too much for that either. It's a good one to drink cold, but you can only have a few. Filling.  Note: I have this brew on tap, in bottle, and in nitro can. I'd rank my preference from most to least as tap, nitro can, then bottle.  On tap you get what this beer was intended to be, and I think pretty close to what you get from the nitro can. Bottle is good, I actually think there's a bit more of the chocolate taste but it heavily lacks on the creamy mouthfeel/smoothness.

Inch and a half tan/brown head after a fairly aggressive pour. Head dissipates quickly. Decent lacing that lasts.  Smell is sweet, malty and chocolaty as expected, but there are hints of hops to balance this package out. Not a very strong aroma for a stout, but what is there is very pleasant.

Went well with the beer. Not overwhelming.  The taste goes through a few phases. Starts with the toasted flavor, then a slight bitterness, which gives way to the ever so slight dark chocolate finish.

Not so, and if you haven't had this go and buy it and drink it as soon as you get home (there's no need to literally drink and drive). Poured into my pint glass and received a thick, black body with a two-finger tan head that left a ring of lace down my glass the whole time. A good malt smell, mostly chocolate (of course). Extremely smooth and creamy, this has an immense chocolate flavor. If you have a sweet tooth then this will wet its whistle, as this beer is almost akin to a chocolate milkshake when it comes to the taste.

Flavor is a medley of dark roasted malts, a nice oat smoth moutfeel and a almost shocking sweetness.

Taste is more complex than the nose. It's dark and very cocoa-y. Rich and ever-so-slightly bitter on the back palate, but man that bitterness is just there to emphasise the rich potency of the brew.

The head comes alive like a good stout should as it rises to a perfectly carmelicious pillow-topped goddess. The smell is immediately chocolatey, like a hershey bar blended with a guinness. The taste is pure chocolate heaven but it's not as overwhelming as you would think given the name. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick but ends in a tad bit of acoholic sharpness which goes almost unnoticable. I probably could sit down and drink this endlessly which is probably good that I purchased a single bottle.  If you're on a stout kick but don't want to dabble too much in the realm of chocolate, try Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout or Sam Adams Cream Stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GoodKnight1220,4.83,"Poured from a bottle to a glass.  Poured black in color, with a 3-4 finger tan head, and had good lacing throughout. This is the best looking beer I've poured.  Heavy sweet chocolate, toasted marshmallow, smells like smores.  Taste is like heaven, wonderful sweet chocolate right upfront and fades to a very slight roasted malt and minimal bitter finish, asks you to keep drinking.  Mouthfeel was very very smooth and quite creamy.  Could drink these till I pass out on the floor.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,theghost3,4.1,"This stout poured black with a medium light caramel head. Smell is a strong balance of chocolate and chocolate malt with roasted, espresso-like malts. It borders on chocolate milkshake. Nice chocolate flavor with toasty malts; bittersweet. Mouthfeel is smooth with some acidity and an odd sort of powdery feel. This is a very rich but drinkable stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,timbro81,4.25,"Greeted by a screaming widget as I cracked open the pull tab. Nice. Wonderful reverse cascading bubbles. Color is Black topped with a creamy white collar that is 1/2 inch in depth but settles to about 1/3inch. Smell is amazing!, like rich hot cocoa but without the heat. Rich and dense but not over the top. I can smell it as it sits on the table in front of me, amazing. Mouth feel is light, maybe more than I would like, and finishes a bit dry. On the tongue it is fairly mild, upon swallowing the chocolate comes into play. Not as big as the nose, more like a watered down cocoa, but still very respectable. Head and shoulders above the bottle version. Why would I ever drink Guinness again if I could have this glorious nectar?! A must stock from now on.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ClavisAurea,4.07,"This can be bought at Central Market in Poulsbo, WA. They have a problem keeping it on the shelves though.  Consumed in a pint glass.  Appearance: great stout ""waterfall"", rich and dark like a stout should be  Smell: wow, holy chocolate, I would think this is more of a porter from the chocolate and coffee notes  Taste/Mouthfeel: rich cream and luxurious chocolate interlaced with coffee and more cream; when the can said chocolate, I didn't know what I was getting into. It felt a bit empty in the finish considering all the workup before. Kind of a let down.  This is the favorite beer of my wife. I like it but I need something that features chocolate, not showcases it in my beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,roadhouse,3.36,"Poured from 16.9 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Pours an opague black with red highlight when held up to light. Two finger tan head that leaves a couple spots of lace.  Aroma is dominantly chocolate (big surprise) along with some sweet tones. Maybe a little woody as well.  Taste is chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. It's almost like taking a bite out of a bar of chocolate. Maybe some hops at the end.  Medium body, creamy, good carbonation.  I was pretty disappointed with this one actually. Based on the good things I've heard about it I thought it would be better. It was alright, but I think it was just too much chocolate for me. Obviously it's supposed to be that way, but I think I just prefer a regular stout. I'd rather just eat a chocolate bar.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,PatrickJR,4.08,"Poured from 16 oz nitro can into pint glass.  A - Dark opaque brown, nice cascading effect from the nitro thingy. 2 fingers of tan head stick around for awhile and leave some lacing.  S - Chocolate and roasted malt, not much else, maybe some diacetyl.  T - Big roasted malt character hits first, and smooths out into rich, bittersweet chocolate. The brew gradually dries out with a great roasted chocolate and woody flavor along with a buttery component.  M - Full bodied and smooth as can be. No carbonation from the nitro can.  D - A great stout to put back. The nitro can makes it even easy.  I can often appreciate lesser beers packaged in nitro-cans, but in the case of this beer, I don't think it works as well. The lack of carbonation really screws with some of the flavors going on, and for that reason I'll be limiting myself to purchasing bottles of the stuff. Much better in my opinion, but still a fantastic beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,shark262,4.17,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Large head (3 fingers worth) that is more foamy than dense. Head dissipates after a few minutes, leaving excellent lacing on the sides of the glass. Black, opaque with medium carbonation edging to the surface.  Aromas of chocolate, slight roastiness, dark caramel. Very appealing to the nose.  Liquid tastes slightly astringent when first hitting the palate. Roasted chocolate flavor follows as the aftertaste. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness throughout - not cloying.  Much lighter in body than I would have expected. Carbonation level seems a bit too high for this style of beer, but does help in carrying the nice flavors around my mouth.  Very tasty and memorable beer. I could see this being paired with multiple foods/desserts or alone for a nice nightcap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,briman,4,"Served from bottle into standard pint glass.  Pours dark brown, almost opaque with a hint or ruby highlights around the edges. Nice 1 inch brown head, excellent retention, settling in to moderate lace.  Aroma is cocoa, chocolate, with some roasted malts. Moderate aromas, nothing overpowering.  Flavor is bittersweet dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt. The finish has kind of hot chocolate type flavor, not bitter.  Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Chocolate is evident, but is not overly sweet. Well-balanced...this is a beer where everything melds together, and nothing dominates. Slightly creamy, but not really coating. Might lean towards a desert beer for some, but still sessionable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Reagan1984,4.43,"Well, this is a truly awesome beer.  Comes with a big creamy off white head that lingers like there is no tomorrow.  Lacing is huge.  Aroma?? Chocolate. No surprise here.  Taste. Incredible roasted, chocolate taste that is totally creamy. Is this beer or ""Hot Chocolate"" that has been chilled and served cold?  Dont' care, it's awesome.  Roasty, toasty chocolate taste, is a perfect balance to the mild hops and the creamy texture.  If you are going to have a stout, have this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,sstackho,3.24,"500mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours black with a small white head. Excellent lacing. Weak aroma. First taste is a bit tangy from carbonation and I can tell that I need to leave this beer to warm a bit before reviewing further. Now that I've let it warm, it is better, but not signigificantly so. Slightly creamy, hints of chocolate, but not a particularly strong flavour. As it warms even further (1.5 hours out of the fridge), it does improve and the flavours become more pronouced - particularly the chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Aroma is very malty, a nice hoppiness to it too, chocolate of course, coffee, and s slight Pale ale scent to it. Taste is very chocolaty almost like a fudge, big roasty maltiness to it too, sugar, very creamy, almost a bread type note, subtle hops backing, and a faint coffee texture. Palate is somewhat dry, sticky, full bodied, quite long lasting, and a little carbonated. Overall, This is really good for a sweet stout.

Can really taste the dark , bitter chocolate from the onset. some toasted malt mixed in the flavor . Has that stout feel and taste but doesn't hit as hard , Mellowed out by the chocolate.  This is a good beer to finish a meal, a good dessert beer. I could see the sweetness getting to you after one beer.

S- deeply roasted malt, coffee grounds, smoky burnt wood, and extra dark chocolate. behind all the roastiness are subtle english hops and some dried fruit.  T- interesting taste. very smoky and roasted flavors with an unexpected dryness. charcoal grilled dark fruits, maybe some anise, and coffee. the chocolate adds more of an earthy bitterness than an actual chocolate flavor until the finish where the throat seems to be coated in melted bittersweet chocolate. earthy very herbal hops and heated granite come out in the finish as well with strong roasted barley flavor.  MF- as thick and creamy as i could imagine, it seems as if bitter chocolate syrup made up 1/3 of this beer. all the smoky roasted flavors give a warming sensation that makes me think of burning charcoal. very low carbonation just adds to the viscosity.  D- a good stout, but i'm not really a chocolatey kind of guy. it's a good dessert drink or something for a cold night, but it's almost death-by-chocolate. not sweet at all, it really captures the essence of cocoa.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S - Dominated by roasted malts and chocolate. Sweet on the nose. No bitter balance.  T - Starts with a balance of roasted malt and some bitterness. Mid stream is fairly flat, with a continuation of the initial malt notes. Finishes with a dark malt chocolate flavor, similar to that of a dark chocolate candy bar.  M - Interesting on this beer as its both creamy in texture but does carry a fair amount of carbonation. Coats the mouth in a pleasant way. An intriguing mix.  D - A nice slow drinking stout - doesn't appear to have the overbearing characteristic that would prevent me from enjoying a few of these in a night. Although the sweetness would probably stop me after a while.  A good beer to drink on a cold day - which today it is not. Wonder if this would be an interesting backdrop to some hot chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DontCallMeSurly,4.05,"I think it was a 16oz bottle I poured into a snifter although I'm not sure of the exact amount. Anyways, a vigorous pour generated a very rich, brown head of about 3 inches. The beer itself poured a jet-black color with ruby edges. Overall lacing is pretty sticky and the bubble patterns in the beer are kind of cool to look at. There is plenty of bittersweet aromas, roasted malts, dark chocolate....and the faintest metallic smell. I'm not sure what that last one is all about, but the rest are pretty damn good! Oh wow. This one tastes like a (not so) hot chocolate! Upon my first sip I'm met with cocoa, lots and lots of cocoa, which are at first very sweet, but then gives way to a nice bitter chocolate taste.

A large, rocky, and mocha-colored head composed of large, erratic bubbles settles slowly to a thin foamy covering, leaving some nice rings of lace in its wake. Nice appearance.  S: Roasted black malts, bittersweet chocolate, and a light fruity ester aroma that blends in with the rest, adding some additional sweetness.  T&M: Dark roasted barley (a-la Guinness), bittersweet dark chocolate. The feel is rather unimpressive--too watery and thin for a stout. A fuller body and some creaminess would go a long way in helping the flavors hold up and substantially improve the drinking experience. I'm tempted to use the word ""watery"".  D: Fuller body would help flavor hold up better, hence increasing drinkability.

Not the most complex aromas, but inviting to say the least.  T&M - Starts with roasted chocolate malts witha carbonation bite. Sweet dark chocolate in the middle. A dry roasted chocolate finish with a slight acidic twang. The mouthfeel is light and smooth - I'd like it to be a bit heavier. A little watery as well - the flavors don't endure that well...this disappoints me. Low carbonation, which I like for the style.  D - Pretty clean flavors...I can definitely appreciate the chocolate.

I can detect other aromas in there, but hard to tell what they are as the chocolate smell seems pretty dominant, one of the other aromas is almost like cinnamon gum or something similar. Overall a great aroma.  Taste is fantastic. Lots of nice roasted malts, and of course the chocolate flavors.

Tastes of a heavy chocolate dose in a cup of very light coffee. Just sweet and tasty goodness. Like you squeezed beer out of a chocolate bar.  Very nice and creamy in the mouth. I like a little creamier taste, though. Took a little off of the rating for this. It's very good, just not great.  This remains one of my all-time favorite beers.

S: A swirl brings forth aromas of sweet chocolate and roasted grains. A good yet simple smell. You know what you're getting into.  T: Oh wow, a wall of milk chocolate hits even as your taking the sip in. This is sweet chocolate as opposed to the the bitter chocolate taste some other stouts/Impy stouts have.

M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish.  D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not as filling as most stouts, mild kick, very good representation of style.

It poured a rich chocolate brown almost black with a nice firm head that lasted till the finish. It smelled of coco moreso than plain ole chocolate and also with an ending hint of alcohol. It went down smooth and finished well. It felt nice on the palate and without any over whelming flavors that might distract you from its overall appeal.  I liked this beer very much but I cannot see this as the type of beer that you have in your hand the whole night.

Mouthfeel: I poured quite a lot o the carbonation out in the big pillowy head so it wasn't flat, but not overly carbonated, either. There was a nice all-encompassing feel, though with bitterness at the back and sides, and sweetness in the middle. Sounds snobby to me as I read what I just wrote....  Drinkability: This is pretty rich but the lower ABV makes is a pretty easy drinker for a chocolate brew.  Overall: I really enjoyed it. Always do when I buy it.

Taste was that of fresh chocolate milk with a silky smoothness from the nitrogen bubbles leaving a creamy film in my mouth.

First thing I did was take a nice sniff of the beer and noticed the distinct sweet chocolate aroma. The beer has a nice thick brownish head which remains until the last drop. The flavor is more than can be described in words. Trying to best capture the taste (in words), it has a sweet chocolate and coffee flavor with light carbonation.

D - Could definitely drink this pretty regularly",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,madvoice,4.47,Poured a really dark chocolate colour with a coffee coloured head that was thick and creamy and left lacing down the glass. The aroma is very chocolate caramel with a hint of coffee. You can really taste the chocolate and the malt with a slightly coffee taste as well. It is so incredibly smooth and creamy with a light carbonation. This has got to be the most orgasmic beer I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. It was quite expensive for the bottle but in my opinion worth every penny. I'm kicking myself that I didn't buy a few more bottles. I will most definitely be buying more of this.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,rolandolopez2,4.58,"I have had this beer before from the bottle. Decided to try from the nitro can this time. I open the can and notice the immediate aromas of chocolate. I can also hear the nitro start to release. I feel the same as that dog when the dinner bell rings! I need to taste this right away. Pours into a tulip glass very nicely. I feel like a child on Christmas eve. I can't wait to taste this. Color is dark and head is a nice ream color. First sip, WOW! So smooth. This is the feeling of true beer love. I can taste the chocolate malts with a tinny bitterness. it just gets better and better with every drink. I'm now to the last drink. I should have purchased more!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Not a cheap beer, but well worth every penny",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Leebo2007,4.02,I typically do not like Chocolate Stouts but this one was really good. It had more of a deep belgian choco/espresso taste. It had a great color and head.

664,73,PBBC,3.97,"I drank this side by side with Youngs Oatmeal Stout  I was surprised how similar the appearance and mouthfeel were for both beers...  However, Something about this stout is extraordinary... unlike other chocolate stouts that seem to be almost acidic or overhelming with concentrated malt flavors... this stout seems bready, buttery and thick, but not syrupy at all... The bittersweet notes are very well balanced... I would love to drink this with chocolate chip cookies.... in fact, this stout tastes alot like chocolate chip cookies, sweet, bready, roasted, bittersweet.  And excellent dark beer to give to a new-beer drinker.... not overwhelming.... Just delicious",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Ecliptica,3.98,"Saved this one for last on my last stout expedition and somehow left the report write-up 'til a week later. Let's hope my notes are decent enough.  Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. The brew poured, of course, an almost opaque black, reminiscent of all the other stouts and porters I've been drinking lately. The difference in this was the thick, sticky tan head that laced the glass throughout. Very impressed by the appearance.  Smell is chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. There's a touch of caramel and hops, but Young's was right in calling it 'double chocolate stout'.  Taste is pretty much exactly how it smells. As expected, there is a burnt malt flavor with a nice milk chocolate-y front. The burnt malts also give way to a slight bitter aftertaste reminiscent of coffee and, as the brew warms, the alcohol becomes more prominent.  This brew is incredibly smooth and decently full-bodied. Expected it to be thicker than it actually was, but the milk chocolate rather than dark chocolate feel perhaps made it a bit thinner. Carbonation was excellent - even in my 35 degree refrigerator (had to let it warm up for a bit so as not to get a flat, cold beer).  I have friends who absolutely love this and consider it their favorite beer, but I think my tastes lie more in the cream stout and dark chocolate stout flavor than this milk chocolate variant. Regardless, it's an excellent, excellent beer, but for the ABV and price, I'd probably pass on this less I really had a craving for this milk chocolate flavor. Highly recommended anyhow, and I'd love to try it again with ice cream or dark chocolate truffles.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Nice big brown head that slowly falters to a nice lacing.  S: Good smell. Chocolate, roasted malt, cream, caramel and milk.  T: Chocolate, cream and malt rounded out by a little bit of coffee bitterness on the after taste.  M: A little lighter/thinner than expected.  D: Alcohol is lower than expected and makes this a drinkable beer. It is sweet but not too (once again as the bottle claims).

Smell is surprisingly a bit light - definitely chocolately, with some malt. Taste is quite nice: very rich, sweet dark chocolate. Some hints of roast and coffee, too. Aftertaste is pure milk chocolate...yum! Mouthfeel is a bit thin but it's sooo smooth. Drinkability? Well, this is hands down the best stout I've tasted. Actually, I've never really liked stouts before (prefer ales and lagers) but this could easily become a staple for me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Wetpaperbag,4.27,This is a yummy beer. I like the creaminess the nitro gives. I was not expecting to have as much chocolate flavor. Although I was kinda wishing for more.

664,73,MusicaleMike,4.37,"Served at room temperature in a goblet. Freshness date reads ""Best before: 8/31/08""  A: This sweet stout pours with a thick, dark beige head which sits on top of its dark black body. The head recedes slowly to a thin lace on top. There is some lace left on the sides of the glass.  S: Instantly there is the smell of chocolate. The roasted malt smell is there, giving off hints of coffee and toffee. There is a very faint hop smell after the first few sips.  T: The taste is delicious! Very much like a chocolate milkshake. The taste is very present and powerful. It is sweet, but ""never too sweet"" as the label reads. Indeed, it is balanced by a light bitterness. The hop flavor is really in the background, but it always keeps the sweet in check.  M: Unbelievably smooth. Very creamy. I couldn't think of anything better for this style.  D: The relatively low ABV and the delicious taste make this beer very drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Slatetank,4.38,"Poured from the 16.9oz bottle into a nonic slightly chilled. The shape of the bottle is ergonomic and eyecatching I like the new packaging.  A - A rapid cascade of medium brown gets swallowed up by dark cocoa brown and the result is a head of about 2 fingers that has a pillowy top and leaves ringlets of mocha foam lace.  S - The aroma is both sweet + mineral, yeasty and malty w/ a pronounced cocoa puff like sweet odor w/ a hint of pine scented hops.  M - A velvety smooth yet sweet cocoa powdery luxuriously soft feel.The carbonation never overhwelms the chocolate and dark roasted malt . Luscious fullness and there is enough hop to support the sweet and roasted feel left on the tongue w/ a slightly nutty bean texture.  T - Light Fruity taste w/ cereal-like chocolate malt and cocoa w/ a brownie nutty taste blended well w/ woody notes of English hops. As it warms the black malt comes forward and the overall flavor is only a slight chalky/burned light char quality w/ cocoa riding out until the finish. It is very much as the label suggests - Chocolate + stout.  D - A rich beer for the 5.2% it contains. This has excellent potential for drinkability like sessionable stouts, not just as a dessert but as something not overly sweet I could drink a pitcher of this ale. This is world class and the blend of chocolate is really well done. Deserves the reputation as one of the best chocolate beers out there.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The drinkabilty is scary, downed two cans in about 30 minutes and could keep that pace going for some time.

Nothing too complicated but it's pretty good. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter in body and thinner than most but if you're considering as an English version, it's fine.

Surprisingly very little chocolate.  Taste & Mouthfeel Good roasted flavor up front accented by a nice level of carbonation. Bad coppery aftertaste though. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Not a strong level of chocolate flavor, which is really disappointing. I really can't get past the unpleasant aftertaste with this beer. I like it when it's in my mouth, but not after I swallow it.  Overall As the beer warmed, it became smoother and more drinkable. But overall, I was really unimpressed with this beer. I would definitely give it another try and hope that this bottle was just a bad example.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Thin mouthfeel, little to no carbonation. A bit watery, I felt like it was lacking some complexity. I'd say it's worth a try, a little too sweet for me, but it is decently drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Balanced by a coffee-like bitterness that comes more from the heavily roasted malts than the hops.  Full bodied and smooth. Nice carbonoation.

664,73,lacqueredmouse,4.29,"Deep brown body with edges of tan. Reasonable beige-brown head of rocky, coarse bubbled foam, fed by a rather large amount of carbonation. Head sits down after a while to merely a collar of bubbles. It's not a magnificent looking stout out of a bottle - no doubt a nitro-can widget might help this.  Dark cocoa and powdered sugar on the nose, very sweet and aromatic. The chocolate character is definitely most noticeable, and it's really very good. Dry and dusty, but sweet - so sweet. Delicious.  Taste is also very good. Rich, toasted entry swooping down to a sweet, chocolatey back palate. Dark cocoa powder again, hints of condensed milk and a wonderful sticky kind of smoothness in the mouth. (Does this have oats in it? It does!)  What a great beer! Genuinely pleasant, sweet and rich. It may not look like a magnificent stout, but that's certainly what it is.

Thin layer sticks around the whole way through with some lacing  Smell - The aroma is that of a typical stout. It smells good, but not really any different than most stouts.  Taste - Chocolate. Double chocolate. The name is what it is. Some coffee notes but mostly chocolate.  Mouthfeel - Very creamy and rich.

The cascade was not as pronounced as in some of the lighter-colored beers that I have tried of late, but it could still be seen as it occurred. It settled into a thick, deep-tan head like the top of a milkshake. The beer itself was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights. The nose was very chocolaty. The first sip that I took filled my mouth with a milk chocolate taste along with a powdery feeling, like I had inhaled Quik or something like that. The mouthfeel was thin, but the chocolate taste was amazing! The finish was also deeply chocolaty and I wished that I had a dessert to accompany this beer.

Cellar temp - it will warm up quite a bit over the course of the drink though. Into a wine glass it goes.  Big creamy tan head. A few bubbles in it to remind you it isn't a nitro pour. Yep, perfectly black. Nice. Lace on the glass. No complaints here.  Nose is a little too restrained right now - probably too cold. Less chocolate and more grain - sour oats. Toffeeish pale malt. Espresso out back. No scores to this yet until it is nice and warm. Dark fruit coming up. Getting a bit more herbal now - roasty smoke too (time for a sip). A bit metallic. A little funk comes out too. Definitely note the chocolate now - it is a bit powerdery and cheap though.  Hits the tongue with milk chocolate. Palate is complex! Wow. Oats mixed effortlessly with chocolate and coffee - a lot of sourness on the sides of the tongue. Aspirated it gets quite chocolately, like a candy bar. Finish is more dark chocolate, coffee and mouth drying. Smoke comes out too. Chocolate, chocolate, I want more chocolate! Needs a bit more punch for me to love it - feel is a bit watery for something called a 'Double Chocolate Stout'.  Perhaps I'm being overly critical here.

664,73,Mindsquall,5,"A surprising find at the LCBO, this poured a dark black with a nice tan head, now what makes this lovely black creation so special is that it has the virute of being the only beer I have ever seen that light cannot penetrate at all, I even put it in front of a lamp and nothing gets through this. Also as I drink it, it's leaving tons of nice lacing on the glass. The smell is really delicious, the roasted malts make the base but the chocolate makes the substance. Flavor is wonderful, roasted malts with a enough chocolate to complement this stout perfectly. By far the smoothest stout I've ever had, it goes down nice smooth and silky, the bottle called it luxurious and let me tell you that is no lie. Drinkability? Hell I could drink this all day all night and never get tired of it.  I've never given any beer a perfect score.

Filled with massive amounts of dark chocolate with malts in the background, specifically hints of caramel malt. Simple but great. Taste like really dark chocolate. They made sure this beer wasn't on the overly sweet side. Finishes with a slight bitterness. Good carbonation. I expected a creamier/thicker mouthfeel.

664,73,Natural510,4.28,"Pours from 500ml bottle pitch-black with a beautiful 2-inch head which retains nicely and leaves a very visible lacing on the glass. Lacing would likely be even more pronounced from a nitrous pour. Smells of sweet dark chocolate, much like a Godiva bar. Tastes of dark cocoa, to be sure, but not overpowering. The bitterness of raw cocoa is tempered by a subtle sweetness and a slight nutty quality. There is a hop nuance, but the malts playing in the background behind the cocoa make up the major element of the brew. Mouthful, other than the bitter snap of raw cocoa, not as noteworthy as the other qualities. This is an extremely drinkable chocolate stout. Well-balanced all around, no quibbles or shortcomings. It certainly could've been made too sweet, but Young's did not go that route.  It can be had morning, noon or night...in fact I'm drinking it with pancakes after working the night shift.

The chocolate taste comes over a tad artificial, and I can't help but think a dark chocolate profile would go better with the roastiness of the stout rather than the milk chocolate they seem to have gone with.

I didn't detect the cocoa in the first smell. After it warmed up and I got some air into it, cocoa was all I could smell and I was very ok with that.  Tasted at first like a sweet stout, good roasted malt, little caramel and a hint of espresso. After a couple sips, the cocoa became the dominant flavor. Very fun to drink. Lactose was also very apparent in the flavor and mouthfeel.  Great mouthfeel, nice and silky, but didn't stay in your mouth so I wanted more and more of it. Amazing drinkability. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants a nice winter or spring stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

I don't know if it was because of the can but I had a strange metalic taste initially but after that there was a creamy chocolate, nutty slight coffee taste.  Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  I'd like to try this on tap or in a bottle. a very good stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,cbleary,4.43,"Enjoyed from a 14.9oz nitro-can into a nonic pint glass.  The beer poured with a deep black body and a big fluffy latte-colored head. This beer is a delicious treat. It smells of roasted malts and dark chocolate on the nose. The taste is a pleasant and dense blend of nutty bitterness and chocolate sweetness on the finish, remaining well balanced and never cloying. It has a surprisingly thin mouthfeel, but it is not overly so and it only adds to it's incredible drinkability. A great dessert beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,gfreed,3.58,"Very dark, not too chocolatey but a bit too much vanilla in both the nose and the taste. Something to drink after dinner or with a big bowl of ice cream. Good for an adventure or for a change from your usual dark beer. Would go well with a summer evening.

664,73,saintwarrick,3.95,"This brew is almost completely black, very opaque, with a lacy light tan head. Aroma lives up to the name, lots of cocoa and cereal with some caramel.

664,73,Oxymoron,1.96,"The decline of the Ram. Pours a richer black color which seems viscous but when you swirl it doesn't have much sticking power. A tan colored head with good retention and lacing.  The nose has a mostly sour chocolate nose. Not much malt or beer-like smells at all. Maybe a hint of roasted malt. Some lactic and some-what oxidation aromas.  The taste is a bit off as well. A stronger malt presence comes out with a creamy chocolate flavor dominating. Some light astringency in the back end. Some phenolics with a cherry and pineapple flavor. There is a oily (not hop) that is off from the typical nitro flavors. A nasty off flavor that gives almost a DMS or off yeast flavor. Not good.  The body is smooth and although has a light feel, is still has a presence to it. Overall, I don't get it. This is not a good beer and what some perceive as nitro, I feel is more of an off slick/oily feel. Not a fan.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Sweet & Delicious!  MF&D - The only downside to this stout was it was a little thin. I would have liked it to be a little heavier.

664,73,Kemmerlin,3.72,"A: Poured a really thick and creamy looking foamy head. The color was of very dark chocolate.  S: Honestly the smells were of sour chocolate probably do to the yeast but not very pleasing and affected the taste.  T: As stated in the smell catagory, the smell actually hurt the taste. It actually was really good once you got past the taste or held your breath as to not breath in when taking a sip. The taste was of semi-sweet Nestle chocolate chips with super malt flavors and of course a chocolate finish.

664,73,SIRIUS2,4.71,"Poured from nitro-can into a pint glass  A: Deep dark brown in color with the slightest hint of opacity when held to the light. The head was the classic nitrogen induced dense foam with a light brown color, eventually creating about 1/4"" of head that stayed very well. Awesome.  S: Less prominent than I expected but very pleasant, predominantly chocolate - both malty sweet and the real thing, like high cocoa chocolate. There is also the slightest hint of coffee but it's more of a mocha smell. Aroma alone gives an impression of elegant sweetness.  T: Complex, and tasty flavors of chocolate malty goodness on a thick rich wave that eases its way across the palate. The creamy texture is absolutely perfect. There is a hint of sweetness but it really isn't sweet. Somehow, there is a balance between sweet and bitter without the apparent presence of hops but leaning toward the former. Nice long linger of bitter chocolate taste, perhaps with the slightest bit of coffee at the tail end of the finish.  M&D: Creamy and chewy texture that just envelopes the tongue with solid complex flavors. A long pull is most enjoyable, with great mouthfeel and satisfaction. Highly drinkable, especially with the moderate ABV. This is one fantastic brew!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kbeals,4.28,"Beer pours out an opaque black with a finger and a half of brown sugar colored head. Beer has dark chocolate smell with coffee as an undertone. The tase was superb, with the creamy chocolate coming through nicely and a taste that lingers long after finishing the beer. The beer was very creamy and smooth, almost has a rich feeling to it.

S - Holy glory at the aromas coming from this brew. Coffee, chocolate, cocoa powder, and deep dark malts. Vanilla accents trail in at the end. Alcohol is very subtle.  T - Light coffee, caramel and dark malts. Extremely balanced and extremely tasty. Dark chocolate bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.  M - Light and creamy that slides down the whole way.  D - I would drink one of these any time any day. Excellent brew extremely balanced in all aspects. I encourage anyone who has a chance to try this to do so.

664,73,wagenvolks,4.16,"Nitro-can into a Lowenbrau beer mug.  To start, this is one of my all-time favorite beers. I've had it on-tap numerous times and have reviewed a bottle.  Cracking open the nitro-can releases a sasisfying hiss, followed by a fizz from the widget at the bottom of the aluminum. A slow pour presents a black body with dark amber highlights capped by a creamy, beautifully retained ochre head. Nice cascading formation, and the seperation between beer and foam is as sharply defined as the best Guiness pint. Aroma is a little muffled compared to the tap and bottle, but still classicly YDCS, with cocoa powder, vanilla, and roasted malt.  The flavor is heavier on the dark chocolate than I can recall from the bottle & tap. Excellent bitter finish, not quite as smooth as the other mediums, but still excellent. There might be a slight tinge of metal in the aftertaste, but the nitro-can is a great way to experience Young's claim to fame. Although I do believe I'll favor the bottle next time, the nitro-can of Double Chocolate Stout is not a disappointment.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Cyberkedi,5,"Color is a deep, opaque sable with a decent, fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is delightful, strong and smoky with firm undertones of chocolate and coffee.

Highly recommended to all stout/porter fans.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,charlzm,3.53,"Consumed 12/26/08.  Dark, dark brown pour with a fine one finger tan head. Aroma is light chocolate and dark roasted malts.  Beer is not particularly flavorful. There are some weak chocolate notes, subtle roasted malt, vague sweetness, some aftertaste bitterness.  Smooth and thin, but not overly so for either characteristic.  Overall, nothing special here.

Cascaded from the bottom to the top much like a Guinness poured from a tap. Solid film sticks to the walls of the glass long after the sip is swallowed.  The smell was a mix between a chocolate egg-cream and cocoa, with hints of coffee.  The taste was phenomenal. Like drinking desert. Strong taste of dark chocolate with tastes of coffee and toffee after the swallow. Sweet but not overly sweet. A perfect mix of flavors.  The mouth-feel was creamy, and chewy. Not overly thick but enough to stick around after the sip is swallowed.  A very drinkable stout. The best I have ever had from this category. The definition of a dessert beer.

664,73,deapokid,4.87,"Swirling to a head like soft-serve ice cream with the look of Hershey's chocolate and the aroma of a cafe mocha, this chocolate stout has never ceased to amaze me and is definitely one of the ten best stouts on the planet (bold but true). Pouring out a white-head atop a mountain of rich black goodness, this exceptional experience coats the tongue with flavor and somehow manages to be refreshing and hearty at the same time. This was one of the first stouts I ever had (roughly seven or eight years back), but it still is one of the most complex, tasty and down right drinkable. The highest recommendation!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,becktone,4.44,"Eye: This beer pours thick and black. Maybe some russet highlights in there, hard to tell, the light doesn't diffuse through this beer all that well. Head is a shade lighter than milk chocolate brown, is creamy, has excellent retention, some thicker lacing would be nice. I would prefer a head that is just a tad larger though, just a bit.  Nose: Nice aroma! Huge chocolate aroma, with roasted undertones. Dark fruity notes as well-the more I smell it the more it smells like raspberries, though I can't quite tell/be sure. Also hints of coffee in there. Some residual sweetness as well, not quite as potent in others I've had, especially with the vanilla cappuccino aroma. Still this is one of the best smelling beers I've ever been about to drink. Its that dark fruity, sweet aroma that just does it for me. Aroma reminds me a bit of some raspberry hot chocolate I had not too long ago. Damn fine aroma here.  Tongue: Huge chocolate flavors again, finishing with some roasted flavors that give some bitterness to the brew. Coffee tastes/coffee bean bitterness is in there as well. That raspberry hot chocolate character I mentioned earlier is there as well. Also some lactose character, sweetness that seems to come from milk. The finish is a quite astringent bitterness from black/roasted grains that just sits on the palate drying it out. Very nice, this is a damn fine beer.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: I am quite surprised at the feel of this beer, it is much lighter and less smooth than I expected. I was expecting something very velvety, but this is not quite there, sure its smooth, but I think that higher levels of carbonation take away from it. All in all feel is a bit rough around the edges. As I also mentioned it is much lighter in body, it feels a bit weak, like it should be heavier than the medium-light that it is. Though I think it may need work in appearance and mouthfeel this is still a great beer, I recommend it to everyone. This is one of the big boys out there, you should try this before you die. I could sit around and drink this all day, though I feel that my appreciation for it would become much less if I did so. This is a brew that I'll not hesitate to buy again. However, I am wont to buy sixers over single bottles...at the price of about $3.50-4.00 it is getting towards pricey, I think I'd rather buy a sixer of Kalamazoo, in fact I know I would. On the other hand, when I'm in the mood for something with extreme chocolate flavor, this is where I'll turn. Very satisfying, very refreshing, if you love chocolate than this is for you.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BattleRoadBrewer,3.62,"This is my first try with a nitro can. Didn't really know what to expect. The widget was near the top of the can, it spurted for only a second and didn't seem to add much, maybe it was supposed to be closer to the bottom?  Anyway, I started an aggressive pour into a 20 oz nonick. I was shooting for an inch size head, but it only made it up to half an inch. Got the characteristic living downward bubbles, though, similar to a draught Guinness, but not as dramatic, not all the way down to the bottom.  A quarter inch of head persisted to the bottom of the glass along with generous lacing, excellent!  Aroma in the fresh pour was really roasty and inviting. I had high hopes. But the roastiness dissapated, and the aroma turned weird, sort of chocolately but with a note of artificial vanilla.  Flavor is dominated by chocolate, on top of the flavor of a sweet stout and the body of a dry stout. Nothing off or wrong with the flavor, in contrast to the disappointing aroma. No notable caramel, but there is a hint of toffee.  Mouthfeel is thin, not any body here, just like a dry stout.  Drinkability is pretty good. I've had this on draught, it was truly an exceptional beer from the tap. In fact, they should probably not do the money/market share grab and only offer this on tap instead of sullying the name with inferior canned and bottled product.

664,73,alysmith4,3.82,"This is one of the most interesting beers I have ever tried. It tastes just as the name implies.. like a stout made with double doses of chocolate. Dark chocolate at that, and it was delicious! The use of the chocolate lead me to believe that it was fresh actual chocolate added to the beer.  I wasn't impressed however with the nitro-can (I never know how to pour properly with those things) and the mouthfeel and level of carbonation suffered because of it. It was an excellent dessert drink however, and one that I would definitely recommend.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Smells like a fresh mug of hot chocolate, but better. I'm almost getting a sugar rush just whiffing the thing. Taste is a lot weaker than the smell and offers different perspectives. It's a lot more bitter than the smell, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Tastes a lot more like baking chocolate than hot chocolate. Mouthfeel is a lot lighter than I was expecting from a stout.

T: Not nearly as chocolatey as it smells. Burnt roasteyness dominates the flavor with a touch of bitterness. Chocolate dominates the finish, not overly subtle or overly strong.  MF: Thin and carbonation is a bit harsh for a stout. Long lasting roasty chocolate aftertaste.  D: Flavor is solid but not nearly as smooth as I'd like from a stout. Easy drinking beer with modest alcohol. Not really a warming beer, and I think it could be drank pretty much any time of the year.

Tasty, but fairly one dimensional.  Somewhat thin and watery mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate. I remember this as being more carbonated and creamy from the tap.

Dont get me wrong, the hoppy, malty beer smell is ok, but in a flavored beer, i need to smell the flavor along with the taste. Very nice mouthfeel, not watery, not too thick. Alas, the taste leaves something to be desired, for a chocolate beer. Still a great tasting beer, do not get me wrong, just not the chocolatey taste i was hoping for in a double chocolate stout. Now if it were a double stout chocolate, id get it. Too much of a bitter taste in the foreground for me, but the aftertaste does make up for it.

A glorious massive tan head emerges, no hills, no valleys, no peaks, just perfectly topped off my pint glass to perfection. The liquid is an oily inky black- sleek and watery, almost like a guiness. Smells of cocoa and malts. Tasted just like a heaping of dark black chocolate, mild roasted malts- clean and balanced. Slight carbonation, nothing overwhelming. This is one of the more easy beers to drink that I have ever had. I also feel as this beer could surely bridge someone into the world of craft beer. Awesome brew, will buy again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,erosier,4.25,"Pours a nice black from the bottle with a thick, creamy tan head that laces the glass very well. It smells of roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is excellent - a nice roasted malt base with a good sweet creamy chocolate taste at the end that is very pleasent. The mouthfeel is excellent - velvety and not alot of carbonation, just the right amount. The drinkability is pretty good but I wouldn't have more than a few of these because of the thickness that it is.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,windigo32,4.35,"A: Pours a dark brown, almost black that doesn't let any light through. Creates a creamy tan head that stays on the top in decent proportion.  S: Smells like a mix of chocolate and coffee.  T: Taste is very similar to smell with dark coffee and chocolate tones.  M: The head is very smooth and velvety. The beer itself almost lacks carbonation, and doesn't feel quite as thick as you'd expect from the look of the beer.  D: When I'm not in the mood to try something new, this is one of my standbys. It goes down very smooth and easily.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,86sportster883,4,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout, out of the can, is a very good beer but not a great beer.  It pours opaque black with a thick creamy tan head.  The smell reminds me of chocolate milk made from sweet Bosco-like chocolate syrup.  Chocolate and roasted malt flavors dominate making this stout less sweet than the smell would indicate.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style and the low carbonation contributes to a slightly watery feel.  In the end, Young's DCS finishes moderately dry and the overall experience is pleasant. Next time I'll grab a bottle rather than a can.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rayek,4.08,"Fun stuff. The chocolate gives this stout a unique personality.  A: Dark walnut color. Dense cream color head. Left a heavy lace down the glass.  S: Cocoa and vanilla up front. Reminded me a lot of a cup of hot chocolate.  T: Light coffee taste with a lot of chocolate. A little burnt bitterness plus earthy oatmeal comes through. Very well balanced. The flavor starts out a little weak, but builds the longer you let is swirl in your mouth.  M: Thick, creamy, yet a little watery too.  D: Again, fun stuff. This is a very drinkable beer. I could see myself drinking several of these in a night. The body is light enough that it doesn't weigh you down.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The chocolate tastes like a hersey's candy bar chocolate. Very sweet chocolate notes but is very light in flavor and body with some cocoa notes. Not as robust as I thought it would be considering its labeled a double chocolate stout. A nice light body stout with decent flavor just not as robust as I hoped or expected from a british brewer where chocolate and coffee are dominate in culture.

Smell: Dark chocolate all over.  Taste: Chocolate and coffee. Slight bitterness.  Drinkability: Very good. Excellent with a chocolate dessert after dinner. With an ABV of only 5.2%, you can have more than one in a session.

664,73,saztheorybook,4.33,"A big surprise to find this in my rural Japanese haunt. ""Only 24 bottles,"" the sign said. How could I refuse?  I'm not a stout drinker for the most part, but boy, was I ever floored by this! The beer was nearly pitch black and the head was a color like chocolate ice cream. The head didn't leave much for lace, but it was the first thing I drank and the last thing, too. The first smell was overwhelmingly of chocolate syrup with only a little bit of roast to off-set it. The taste was much the same--it seemed identical in flavor and mouthfeel to chocolate milk. There was no hint of the alcohol (until I stood up) and the carbonation was nil, which really worked in its favor. I was floored, but and for /1000, I was not disappointed. I would definitely split a six pack of it with my girlfriend on any quiet night in.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JDV,3.78,"Pours a rich dark brownish black, with a light brown thick, medium lasting head. Smell is of Rich semi sweet chocolate. Taste is very smooth, creamy, with some light roastiness, and of course some rich bittersweet dark chocolate flavors. Not overly thick, but still very full bodied, and just what I'd want in a stout. Finish is of bittersweet chocolate. Overall, a great beer that is well balanced for my taste. Would recommend.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

(homer simpson drool noise...)  dark like cola, great nitro head. seriously, does a nitro ever LOOK bad? ;-)  sweet chocolate toffee aroma with vanilla undertones. gentle and dessert-like. hint of spice that is almost cinnamon-like.  taste is similarly gentle and smooth. roasted malts complement the chocolate and vanilla. bitterness is subdued, making this a great dessert beer all its own.  feel is ever so slightly watery, but easily made up with the nitro smoothness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,rye726,4.18,"The color is lack with some faint browns around the edges. Perfect frothy, creamy, tan, 1"" head. Excellent retention.  This double choco stout smells like chocolate, and lots of it. Some roasted malts and fuggle hops, but it is mostly a bouguet of truffles.  The flavor has slightly more complexity. There is a significant malt composition centered around burnt black and chocolate. Traces of molasses and caramel.  This is possibly the smoothest and most easy drinking beer I have ever encountered. Young's uses relatively quality chocolate, which I beleive is crucial in this style. There are absolutely no off flavors. Perfect with salty pub cuisine or as a cure for kottonmouth.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DrainBamage,4.25,"Pours a black color with very little head, only a little lace that clings to one side of the head. Not much smell here, a little sweet malty aroma is about it and no sense of chocolate. Goes down smooth, lightly carbonated, and minimally bitterness. The taste is unbelievable though. It's almost like chocolate utopia in a bottle. The hops and malts are perfectly balanced. There isn't a chocolate stout out there that beats the flavor in this one, IMO. Although, there is basically no head and smell, this is still by far my favorite chocolate stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mudpuppet,4.03,A- Poured at the Ginger Man in NYC. Poured into a pint glass with a strong 3/4 inch tan thick head and a black thick body.  S- Some chocolate on the nose obviously. Very light nose other than that.  T- This is a good dry stout. I get some dark roasty malts with a mild chocolate flavor. The chocolate is not overly strong it just is a light to medium background note.  M- Thickish brew with a medium carbonation. The bubbles were very small because of the nitro tap.  D- I know that it is categorized a sweet stout but I think it is a dry stout with chocolate flavor. Good drinker for sure though.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,joeack,4.48,Poured this from a nitro can. Formed about a one inch creamy head and as was brown black in color. Could smell a hint of chocolate. The taste was initially of a stout but then the chocolate really came through. This beer is very enjoyable and drinkable and i am looking forward to trying it again very soon.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Brad007,4.88,"I decided to rate this beer again but from a different serving type (nitro-can).  Color: Motor oil black with a luscious, creamy head of foam. Looks very palatable!  Aroma: Smooth and creamy with a strong chocolate presence in the nose. As it warms up, the chocolate aroma becomes even more potent.  Taste: Smooth and creamy upfront with a hint of coffee followed by creaminess and then chocolate towards the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, luscious and smooth. Goes down very smoothly as well.  Verdict: A beautiful example of the milk/sweet stout category. Tastes even better from a nitro-can than a bottle. It also beats out comparable stouts in nitro-cans that I have sampled.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BubbaSteve,4.16,"After only being recently able to get my hands on this beer, I decided to give it a try. Now, in all honesty, I was a bit worried. The idea of actually putting chocolate into a beer struck me as a bit ""gimmicky"" for lack of a better word. Now that I have tried it...I am going back for more!  First, while it is characterized here as a ""Sweet/Milk Stout"" I honestly didn't find it to be so. The sweetness simply does not jump out at me. The chocolate does and IMHO is the star of the show. In my reviews that I do for the store in which I work (part-time...it is a labor of love) I often refer to stouts as having ""chocolate notes"" so I shouldn't have been surprised at how well the chocolate works here. This is one great stout! Pours a rich dark caramel brown, beautiful creamy head (say what you will about widget beers...they do pour great thick heads)that stays with you through the whole quaff. The aroma was lighter than I expected but pleasant with malty and chocolate overtones. Where this brew shines is in flavor and mouth feel.  The chocolate comes through wonderfuly. Added to the roasty notes of the malt, it had a cappuccino-like taste without as much bitterness (though there is enough bitterness for good balance)the malt comes through nicely. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk and excellent. I found it to be a bit less heavy than some other stouts and feel like I could drink a few at a sitting. All in all, a very superior stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AMo,4.03,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout pours a nice robust, dark, brownish black. The smell is pleasantly mild of chocolate and malts.

Smell: Chocolate at the front, not overpowering, strikes a good balance with the caramel/roasted notes.  Taste: Wonderful. Sweetness of the chocolate/caramel, followed by a note of hops, and the earthy roasted, malty tones in the aftertaste. Nice progression of tastes, and a very nice balance between all the tastes.  Mouthfeel: Perfect level of carbonation, and about as creamy as you can imagine. Exactly how a stout should feel.

Looks a lot like a Guinness with a darker head. Opaque in clarity.  S - Definite chocolate smell. Smells like a milk chocolate bar. Some caramel scent. Fun sweetness, makes you feel like a kid.  T - Slight chocolate after taste. Warm cocoa up front. Taste doesn't linger much.  M - Very smooth. Light bodied. Goes down like nothing but not very impressionable.  D - Light compared to it's appearance. An easy drinker. It doesn't fill you up and is nice enough to drink more.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

I thought the idea was absurd but they were mighty tasty with this brew. Anyway, I used the other bottle straight for this review.  A - Blick -a-dee- Black with a nice creamy head that lasted.  S - Mocha chocolaty delight.. Yum, absolutely the best part of the brew.  T - Roasted chocolate bean. They should serve this at Starbucks. A nice dark chocolate makes the sweet malt stand out.  M - Medium bodied although a bit too carbonated.  D - Very easy. Smooth and satisfying. Even great with vanilla ice cream!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Observed a very cool display, looking much like sand art until the beer settles to a consistent one finger beige head on top of a coal black body. Good retention!  Smell of Chocolate Ovaltine Powder Mix, with hints of roasted malts and coffee. Very smooth, sweet and creamy, with some dark chocolate and coffee bitterness, on the finish.

664,73,PEBKAC,2.74,"$8.99 a 4-pack at Bev World II; BB: 24 Feb 08  I love nitro. Sure, it's gives the beer an unnatural look & feel, & the sound of the widget dancing around has probably resulted in more then a few kids loosing their fingers, but so what. Nitro delivers.  As I pour this one out slow, I manage to get just about the whole 14.9oz inserted before the head takes off. Slow & steady, the insulating foam goes forth. Once it reaches the lip it stops like a well trained dog. Good doggie, here's some beernuts. :) *gurgle*  Being familiar with nitro, I play with the head, seeing what I can float atop it. ...and... Lego bricks don't float. So I plant myself on the couch while the tan suds settle.  Twenty five minutes later, I dive in. ... Yoo-hoo & brown sugar immediately come to mind. Something like vanilla & hazelnut (but a little more artificial) creeps into the background. I don't smell anything else.  The obvious thinness of it you notice immediately. I feel like I am in fact, drinking that skim milk, chocolate flavored drink we call Yoo-hoo. The paltry added creaminess from the nitro just reinforces the thought of how much I dislike lowfat milk. On my third sip, I notice that artificial vanilla/nut mixture that doesn't sit totally well with me. The backend brings in a dark mixture of hot chocolate & stale coffee. Everything tastes very bland.  I could drink it again. Whether or not I'd pay for the so-called privilege is another question. :|",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tkach,4.17,"This was recommended to me after hearing the store owners replaced the Brookyln Brewery chocolate stout with this. As always was excited to try a new beer and was quite satisfied with the results.  Appearance was pretty good, definate look of a stout with a nice elegant creamy head to it.  Smell was great. To me it was the perfect combination of a rich chocolate and a nice full stout beer. I'd like to see a friends reaction making them smell it blindfolded..  Taste. I really liked it. It has taken me a while to build up a good taste for a stout beer and this was a major stepping stone for me. It will certainly make you appreciate a delicious beverage.  Mouthfeel was great, there was a slight bubbly sense to it and the richness it gave out was amazing and unique.  Drinkability was good for a late evening desert beer.

664,73,bunnyhustle,3.76,"Poured from bottle into mug. Pours virtually black but some mahogany highlights around rim of mug. Thick, very thick, mocha colored rocky head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is lackluster. Really not much here, some baking chocolate, very powdery, other than that there seems to be and off smell, almost yeast like. Taste was much better. Chocolate, as expected, is rich and full, almost syrup like. Some roasted grains and malt, but mainly chocolate. Somewhat bitter taste left in mouth. Thick and full mouthfeel, low carbonation. Overall a good beer once I got over the smell. I like the lower ABV, it makes this easily drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,RblWthACoz,3.7,"Pours an opaque black. The entire glass was one unsettled bit of stout that had to calm, which took a minute or two. Thick tan head. Nose is a mild chocolate with standard strong malt characteristics in the mix as well. Flavor is smooth with a subtle chocolate tone that lingers and gently caresses the palate. Feel is thick with a decent carbonation. It is drinkable, sure. But for a double chocolate stout, I am not blown away. I had this before in the bottle and wasnt entirely wooed by it and wanted to give it another shot since I figured my palate might have not be en mature enough to appreciate. But yet again, I am just not getting it. I know this is an extremely popular brew, but am I missing something?

664,73,deltatauhobbit,4.61,"Pours very creamy and thick, very black. A large cream head, tan colored, starts out about half an inch and stays thick throughout the pint.  Hard to smell past the cream top, could make out hints of coffee and chocolate (obvious) though.  Drinks very smooth, can't get past how smooth. Strong chocolate taste, not too bitter, slight coffee hint, but certainly the chocolate is the dominant flavor. Extremely sweet.  The creaminess of the stout stays in your mouth long after drinking with no unpleasant bitterness lurking about. Highly sweet, not for those who prefer a bitter stout.  Because it's so smooth, I could I drank it faster than I normally do with a stout, but because it's so rich and full, it's hard to drink more than one or two at a time.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It had a very creamy looked and stuck to the sides of the glass. The beer is very dark with a slight reddish look when the light hits it right.  Very strong roasted coffee aroma.  The taste is unbelievable. It has a malted chocolate flavor with a slight hint of coffee flavor. I also pick up a little cream flavor towards the end, then a roasted malt aftertaste.

The flavors of lucious chocolate with a very slight bitterness and mild roast character are paired with ample residual sweetness.

It looked stunning poured into a Youngs ale glass in one of the nicest old london pubs Ive seen in three years of being here. The medium bubbly head was white/brown and settled nicely. I've never had anything like it before. Incredible chocolate presence (tastes like cadburys) - but it still manages to be a stout somehow. Other notes are present in the taste, such as raisin and coconut. The drinkability is exceptional, I would have expected it to sit in your stomach. Nonetheless I probably would not have more than 2 of these in one sitting. The stout is very lightly carbonated.

S: It smells primarily of chocolate, with subtle notes of raisins. There is also an oak-like aroma as well as an ever-so-slightly vinous quality.  T: It tastes like it smells, with dark chocolate being the primary taste. There are also faint notes of coffee, and, as it warms in my hand, a milky taste, which complements the chocolate and coffee very nicely. It is robust and smooth and sweet, but not overly so.  M: The mouthfeel is really the only thing about this beer that I have qualms with. It is really thin, and even worse, it's kind of tingly acidic.  D: The drinkability is awesome.

I am also quite drunk. hehe I did try the Young's on its own first, though.  Poured into a wine glass. Head stuck around pretty well. Good lacing.  Smell - Not as chocolatey as I would have liked, but hardly bad. More coffee-ish than chocolate, I'd say.  Taste - Really nice, like a good mocha. Chocolate and dark roasted coffee flavors. Some hop rounds it out to balance.  Mouthfeel - Good pop, goes down easy. I can't complain.  Drinkability? Not difficult to drink this on its own.

The scent is roasted sweetness - pretty much what you'd expect, except that there is less than I'd like.  I'll just say that I'm biased against stouts. The roasted flavors aren't my favorite. This one is my favorite so far.  First impressions -- incredibly smooth. Full bodied. Amazing mouthfeel, one of the best.  Tastes like slightly roasted malts, but not too drastic. Much better than most stouts. It's not overwhelming.  I've gotta say that for a ""double chocolate"" flavor, I don't taste a whole lot of chocolate. Not complaining really, just surprised.  Very strange thing to say, but this ""milk stout"" does in fact remind me of milk. It's almost the consistency of milk.

Very chocolatey aroma with some coffee notes and something else dark in there. Nice smell.  Fairly good taste to this one. Not quite as sweet as I was expecting from the smell, but it was still nice. Very dark and smoky and burnt taste. I may have drank this too cold. A bit of a flat taste at the end, but I think it was just too cold.  Nice stout that I will definitely try again when it isn't so cold.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,madjr80,3.98,"I have to say that this stuff is absolutely awesome. It is like drinking a Starbucks mocha mixed with a fine stout. Two things that I love so much! It is very sweet with hints of grains mixed with malted chocolate. It is a beer that you really want to enjoy slowly from a nice pint glass. I wouldn't want any more than two of these in a sitting. Make sure it isn't too cold, because you won't taste all of the ingredients.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,largadeer,3.97,"Appearance - Pitch black with a huge, dense, tan-colored nitro head and lots of sticky lace. Head retention is remarkably good. Even amongst nitro beers, this one looks better than most.  Smell - The weak point of most nitro beers is the nose, and this one is no exception. Chocolate and burnt grains are faintly noticable but there are no subtleties at all here.  Taste - Milk chocolate, cream, molasses, coffee, burnt grains - a rich, complex and changing flavor. Slightly dry in the finish, with long-lasting dark chocolate and espresso notes.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with a lot of richness and body provided by the head. Heavy on the palate.  Drinkability - An exceptional stout, but too rich to be a regular for me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,montageman,4.18,"Poured into a pint glass.  Widget cans provide the best pours. Viscous pour capped off by a creamy, thick head. The appearance of these beers is a thing of beauty. Young's is no different. The smell is a nice mix of chocolate & roasted coffee with some slight fruitiness in the background. Taste follows with a nice sweet chocolate flavor that is extenuated by the coffee notes. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy - very nice for this style. This is an easy drinking stout. A perfect dessert beer. Highly recommended.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,dkoehler42,3.87,"This beer is a good dark chocolate stout. It pours with a darker head than most beers, and is dark as expected. But this beer actually does smell and taste like chocolate as well. If you're looking for a beer to abuse, this isn't it. This is a beer to drink with dessert or if you want a good tasting beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,westweasel,4.4,"Poured from a nitro-can into an imperial nonick pint glass.  The beer poured out a very dark brown with about a 1/3"" creamy tan head that lasts all the way down the glass. The strongest smell is milk chocolate, with some caramel and just a hint of roastiness.  The taste is wonderful if you are a chocolate fan. I can taste both milk and dark chocolate flavors. There is just enough clean bitterness so that the beer is not overly sweet.  The mouthfeel has the illusion of fullness from all the creaminess in this beer, but it is thinner than you would expect. About medium.  I find this beer extremely drinkable and and enjoyable. You have to like chocolate to like this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Halcyondays,4.25,"16.9 oz., 500 mL bottle, bought at my local Ralph's supermarket for $2.52,  A: Pours a very dark brown, with a thick tan head, which leaves really nice lacing on the side of the glass.  S: Robust chocolate smell, smells a lot like a freshly served piece of chocolate cake.  T: This is as close I've come to drinking a liquid chocolate bar. This beer literally tastes like a chocolate milkshake, though it does have the bitterness of a dark chocolate bar which I like. A little bit of coffee flavour is mixed in there as well, but it is minor.  M: A little to thin as a stout, pretty light-bodied, but very creamy, ultimately satisfying, but not great.  D: A very good tasty stout from Young's, I forgot how much I liked this one, haven't had it in a few months. A really tasty beer, any fan of chocolate will enjoy this.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Foxman,4.05,"It pours an inky tar black with the requisite nitro-cascade that inverts into two fingers of creamy caramel colored head. Thin rings of lacing step the inside of the glass.  The aroma is sweet and cozy, with dark roasted malt, cocoa, medium roast coffee, and even a touch of vanilla  Upon tasting, the malt is sweet as milk chocolate and dark fruit, and also bitter with a nice roast char and black coffee. Hops are intimated, but never really clear, as a mild spiciness does suggest their presence. The malt is residually sweet and milky, and the finish is a lingering tide of earthy bitterness, with a crisp end note. It's a very comfortable flavor profile.  A bit short of medium bodied, it has a creamy swell to it that fills and coats the palate, leaving a fine parting glow.  I'd had it years ago, then had it again recently, and I know now why I remembered it fondly. It's got the fresh, homey feel of some real comfort ingredients. It's almost like sipping a cup of warm cocoa, except not quite. It goes down smooth, finishes clean, and makes the next one an expected pleasure. It's a testament that not every stout has to blow one's doors off in order to make a strong impression.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,sbe1,4,"A nice novelty stout, if you will.  Appearance: Black as pitch, as they say, with a short, nearly toffee colored head that dissipated into a thin foamy ring around the glass.  Smell: Chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, very nice.  Taste: Creamy and some sweetness with a mild dark chocolate and roasted malt bite.  Mouthfeel: Substantial, but not as much as an oatmeal stout or even a Guinness. Creamy and smooth.  Drinkability: Very good, but you might get tired of the chocolate after awhile. However, I wouldn't consider it a chore to go through a nitro four pack (or two).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,HomeBrewJunkie,4.68,"Upon tipping the bottle toward my glass a black liquid with viscosity resembling milk dribbles into it. Very very little light shown thru. The most gorgeous tan/brown head I had ever seen. Usually something so beautiful runs away from me fast, but its retention was impressive. It even stuck around my glass awhile with some nice lacing. This is one sexy brew.  I am a recovering chocoholic and this brew caused me to relapse. My nose was filled with the sweet aroma of chocolate. It smells similar to hot chocolate or chocolate milk. A slight hint of alcohol, and dark malts.  It really tastes like chocolate, double chocolate at that. It is almost as if I am drinking a special dark chocolate bar. I never thought a beer could taste so much like desert. Great stout too by the way, but the chocolate makes it that much better.  I mentioned milk before; the mouthfeel is similar to chocolate milk. So silky smooth it goes down like a tall glass of Oregon Dairy Chocolate Milk.  Probably the most drinkable beer I have ever tasted. It goes down so easy it should be illegal. I have had a few stouts in my day, and a few chocolate stouts and none so far have had the drinkability of Youngs Double Chocolate Stout. I will seek this one out again, and its recommended to any stout lover or chocoholic. Not the cheapest stout you can buy but well worth it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,brewdlyhooked13,4.88,"Appearance - black as can be with a melted ice cream top of a half-finger or so. Light mocha in color, it ain't budgin' and hangs around throughout the entire half-liter.  Aroma - chocolate syrup, roasted coffee beans, in copious amounts. Simple yet elegant, robust, and wonderfully resilient.  Taste - roasted malts at the fore, a touch of grassiness, quickly followed by a stronger, burnt flavor of grain and coffee beans. The swallow brings the chocolate flavor into the mix, dark and bittersweet without too much sugar. A mellow kiss of hops to complement the mild grain char taste on the aftertaste. The finish is roasty and chocolatey.  Mouthfeel - a heavenly smoothness that goes hand in hand with the silky chocolate flavor. The carbonation is understated, giving the feel that much more glide.  Drinkability - this has been one of my favorite beers for several years now. I took some to a father-son campout and everyone who tried it loved it. I'll be bringing more to share around the campfire next year.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AaronHomoya,4.16,"Nitro bottle does a great job of giving the smooth, creamy head. Near black color with thick, tan colored head.  Aroma is of roasted malt and chocolate.  Taste is a delicious mix of roasted malt and sweet malt with dark chocolate and a creamy, vanilla note. Nice finish.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and super creamy thanks to the nitro.  Quite a tasty beer that is smooth and easy to drink. Perhaps too rich and chocolatey for everyday drinking, but definitely nice to have.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Head was about a finger's width thick  S - Chocolatey--more of a bittersweet/dark chocolate but I was getting a few whiffs of milk chocolate at times.  T & M - Bittersweet chocolate to begin with followed by some coffee and ending with hops for balance. Very very smooth.  D - Being so smooth, this stuff goes down easily.  A highly recommended brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,Traquairlover,4.2,"This was a 14.9 oz nitro-can drunk from a Guinness pint glass.  A = Beautiful foamy tan head over dark mahogany. Just looking at it makes my mouth water.  S = Very strong chocolate smell, but some tartness, so like bittersweet chocolate, not sweet milk chocolate.  T = As strong as the chocolate was in the nose, it is nothing to the wonderful chocolate taste. Tastes like dark chocolate sweetened just enough to not be unpleasantly bitter. Also, definitely some slight bitterness in the taste that lingers on the back of the tongue as a slowly fading aftertaste. Very rich and malty.  M = Luxurious and creamy. This is almost like drinking beer flavored cream. Outstanding feel as it hits each part of the mouth. Eventually you have to swallow, but it is definitely worth savouring the feeling in your mouth first.  D = After the high marks I have given the other aspects of this beer I almost feel guilty only giving it a 4 for drinkability, but the truth is this is so rich, it is hard to imagine drinking too much of it. Definitely worth a try and a nice thing to have on hand for guests who appreciate good beer, but not necessarily for a normal relaxing after work sort of drink.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,aerozeppl,3.69,"From a 14.9 oz nitro can into a pint glass.  A: Pours black into my glass. Very thick mocha head with quite a bit of lacing.  S Big surprise here: chocolate. Not as strong as you would think though. For the style the smell is rather faint.  T: Rich chocolate hits you at first. Then you get a really nice roasted malt in the second rush. You can actually ""taste"" the creaminess of this beer.  M: Silky in a word. With the nitro can it is almost like having it on tap. It is thick but also very drinkable. Other stouts taste like liquid steak this one is liquid chocolate.  D: For the style this is a really refreshing and drinkable beer. I always seem to have a few of these in the fridge because my gf loves this beer. The best desert beer I have ever had. I have heard of pairing this with chocolate or strawberries. That is pure hippy crap. This beer stands on it's own. I would recommend people get this in the nitro can instead of the bottle.

Smells like almost pure Nesquick powder with a little dustiness from the hops. Pretty delightful.  Tastes like a smoky dark chocolate. The chocolate is front and center, but the typical stout characteristics give the beer a more complex bitterness than just dark chocolate.  Creamy, mellow carbonation makes this great to sip slowly or let big gulps roam on down the throat.  I like the fact that even though this beer is huge on flavor and smoothness, it's not got a huge ABV like a lot of these kind of flavored stouts. You can feel like you're spoiling yourself without having to deal with a huge buzz.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JArami,4.2,"I tried Young's Oatmeal Stout the other day after entertaining a craving I had for a good stout. This Double Chocolate Stout is glorious.  A: Very dark brown, so thick you cant see through it. Good stout looks, very creamy head, three fingers (i poured it into my wheat glass as my other glasses are too small, oh well it looks nice).  S: Hops at first, then the dark chocolate sweetness and dark roasted malts.  T: A balanced bitters. The chocolate steals the show, but roasted notes of caramel and toffee show through.  M: The carbonation is very smooth and ushers the dark chocolate to your nose. Not too thick or chewy. I'm a Dunkel Weizen guy, so I don't like to have to chew through my beer, this Stout is just right.  D: Exquisite, rich, and chocolaty, but not so sweet you'll wish you hadn't had the whole pint. Very drinkable after a hearty meal.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Sweet malt mix in, but mostly chocolate. It smells sweet. Oh, did I mention that it smells of chocolate?  This beer tastes very chocolatey. Chocolate up front. Chocolate in the middle, and chocolate in the finish. It has a sweet caramel like flavor as well.  This beer is thinner than I expected. It is carbonated well. It leaves a... you guessed it, chocolatey aftertaste.  This beer would probably make a good session beer. It tastes good, and is not high in alcohol.

Good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Upgrayedd,3.53,"From a four pack of nitro cans. I really love the ever-present head that comes from nitro. It also has a really smooth carbonation. I'm not a big fan of chocolate shouts with actual chocolate added, but if I was, this might be my favorite. The first sip is really when it hits you...the chalky chocolate mouthfeel really dominates this ale. About halfway through the glass I couldn't taste the chocolate anymore, and only then could I detect a tiny malt and hop presence. This one goes down really easy even though I like to savor each sip to see if I was going to get malt or chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,PittBeerGirl,4.06,A- This has perfect appearance. Body is a solid opaque deep rich brown hue (very close to black). No light penetrates through. Beautiful 1 finger creamy tan head sits on top of the dark body with perfect retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass. As a side note-this is only the 3rd nitro I have had. The other two were the over publicized Guiness and Boddington's. Nirto really does a lot for the appearance and mouthfeel.  S- Strong smell of chocolate. Chocolate syrup comes to my senses first. Hints of toffee deep in the background.  T-Much milder than the smell but still dominated by chocolate. Lots of chocolate malt upfront with a slight roasted character. Finish is consistent with the initial flavor but more of the chocolate-milky taste of a milk stout comes forward and a bitter roasted flavor becomes somewhat more prevalent. Seems much to sweet at first but the sweetness mellows with each sip.  M- Little to no carbonation and medium-thick body. Very smooth and creamy. Easy to swallow.  D- This is definitely one of the sweetest beers I have come across. I was taken back at first by this but it slowly grew on me. When held in the mouth the bitterness and roasted characters are more prevalent and bring more balance to the brew.

Very smooth in your mouth, not very carbonated.

It seemed a little bit watery to me with no carbonation. Maybe this was because it was on tap and the keg was low, I dont know since this is the first time trying this one.

664,73,BuckSpin,4.18,"Presentation: 14.9oz nitro can (production code of W7DB14A?) in a Guinness pint glass  BAside: Why breweries use production codes based on the German WWII Enigma code cipher is beyond me...  Opened with a sound that can best be described as something a Star Wards droid might say in disgust! Poured silent, very thick & viscous, velvety smooth.  Nose is initially dry, full of crackers & bread. I was expecting to be blown over by a chocolate bomb. There is chocolate present in the aroma, but its subtle, soft, distant. Actually its quite nice. The bread/cracker qualities continue to rise at it warms, and the chocolate aspect shifts from milk to more of a dark. There are even some aspects of a nut quality peeping thru! The head slowly formed for minutes, finally becoming a finger's worth of super thick, ultra tight, mocha hued cream (as opposed to foam), flat as a board. Looking straight down, its almost like looking at a mocha latte. It has great retention and has only settled to a pencil's worth of the same with solid, paint-like sheeting coating the glass.  Black in a good mood almost doesn't do the body justice. This is one of the darkest beers I've seen in a long time. Its practically black, just a peep of some dark mahogany at the glass bottom if I hold it directly to a light. This is a very pretty beer.  Silky smooth, sweet with milk chocolate and echoes of sweetened coffee, its almost a bit pornographic in mouth feel. Its sooo smooth. Nicely dry but not chalky or abrasive in the least, its actually quite mild in taste but what is there is damn nice. Malts have a nice roasted quality and even hint at some bread qualities.  Incredibly easy to drink, its going down very nice...and quick! Growing a little more bitter on the palate, the bitterness is reminiscent of what you taste in good, black coffee with no acidity. It stays silken & smooth throughout, an great beer as far as mouth-feel. The finish is a little drier, sweetly-bitter, a little nutty, echoes of semi-sweet baking chocolate, and leaves a clean, mild caramel-chocolate aftertaste that lightly paints the mouth.  Damn enjoyable. I honestly don't know how anyone couldn't like this. This would be a great transitional beer. Its like drinking dessert! That said, this might be one of the best dessert beers I've had. Chocolate is obvious, but also anything with nuts, caramel, coffee, cakey, etc. It might also (this will sound odd) work with a really creamy, smoooth cheese. Could be sessioned like mad. Again, what's not to like about this? One of the easiest to drink, smoothest, sweet beers I've tried. Definitely recommended!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Creamy tan-light brownish head with good lacing throughout.  Has a definate milk chocolate aroma. Some creamy buttery notes that you would expect when smelling milk chocolate from a bowl. Just chocolate notes I get. No roast or hop at this point.  Along with chocolate(but only slightly now) comes the roast, coffee charcteristic flavors from the malts. Minimum dryness at the end from the hops or roasted malts I suspect.  The best part of this is actually mouthfeel.

S- The aroma was sweet and full of chocolate. There were hints of something like a Turkish coffee and perhaps some fruit scents.  T- More roasty and chocolate flavors with some cream notes. There was a light bitter balance, possibly from the hops, the addition of actual chocolate in the brew, or both.  M- The soft head and tiny prickle of carbonation made for a very smooth and creamy feel.  D- This was an easy drinker on a cold, damp evening.  Overall- A great representation of the style.

Aroma is a bit dusty and musty off the top, like an attic, then moves into some rich milk chocolate mixed with a bit of bitter cocoa/dark chocolate. Caramel, vanilla, and some husky graininess round it off. Subtle but delicious.  Taste is very rich with lots of chocolate and caramel in the forefront with an almost rye-like graininess coming out as an afternote. Lactic sourness helps to balance things out a bit, roasted malt is subdued but there. Finish is fairly wet and musty again in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with a medium carbonation, just right for the style. This is a well-balanced and extremely enjoyable example of a style that can easily get too sweet for my liking. Well done.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Throwrug,4.41,"This beer pours jet black, with an average sized tan head which disappears quickly. The smell is out of this world -- coffee, chocolate and caramel. The light carbonation gives it a very silky feel, and it goes down nicely. All in all this is a great tasting stout. Not bitter at all, and extremely flavorful. Even my wife, who hates stouts, absolutely loved this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,LittleCreature,3.88,"Appearance - 4.0 Poured almost two fingers of beige head that gradually reduced to a thin layer over a solid black body.  Smell - 4.0 Chocolatey! I can smell hot chocolate, milk chocolate and chocolate topping, as well as lots of roasted, slightly burnt malt. As it warms, the chocolate smells get stronger.  Taste - 3.5 Not as much chocolate as the smell, but there is still a fair chocolate hit. Quite sweet, although not as much as the Cadbury-esque label might suggest. Roasted malt, rye-bread and a moderate bitterness, coming from the hops and the burnt malt. Finish is a little dry with plenty of flavour. Well balanced and very good.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 About perfect for a stout in my opinion - low carbonation, moderate to heavy weight in the mouth and very smooth and creamy.  Drinkability - 4.0 The fact that this beer is not over-sweet, and is only 5.2% ABV makes it sessionable for those who appreciate the style. I would love to try it on tap.  OVERALL - 3.9 I'd like to try this as a float with a good vanilla ice-cream. It's definitely the most enjoyable stout I have tried, and was worth the exxy price ($7.99!). I've heard it's even better on-tap in England (where it would surely be cheaper too, lucky poms!).  Re-review: on recent drinking, I don't like this beer as much as I initially did. Too much of a chocolate topping flavour and aroma, could stand to be a lot more subtle. Still good, but not great.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,wesleyhighley,4.92,"One of my favorite beers. I really enjoy drinking this with a piece of chocolate to nibble on. If I had to choose one keg to put into my apartment, this would be it. It's got a great pour, doesn't sour at all and finishes really smooth. I'd pay twice as much for this beer!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GratefulBeerGuy,3.91,"14.9 oz nitro can&gt; mug  This one starts off dark brown with a mezmerizing cascading effect and finally settles into a totally opaque blackness and a two-finger, extremely tight and thick, creamy head that's perfectly smooth on top and isn't going to be going anywhere anytime soon! The retntion is perfect and remains thick until the end. Looks wonderfully creamy and thick. I would say the aroma is that of a double chocolate oatmeal mudslide malt that has very aromatic chocolate, oats, cream and vanilla with slightly nutty and spicey hop effect way, way down deep. The flavor is a mocha-chocolate and cream malted wonder, very roasty and nutty with a big peanutbutter finish. It's a thick and smooth full body with a very smooth vanilla flavored head that still has at least 50% of it's original depth. The aftertaste is a smokey, semi-bitter and dry herbalness and my lips are becoming sticky! This is actually very light at 5.2% and the nitro can only adds to the smoothness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JamesS,4.07,"The nitro can is a nice touch, the beer came out wonderfully with a nice thick head. Has very nice chocolate overtones, what I thought of as dark chocolate, compared to other chocolate beers that had more generic chocolate scents. Very nice taste, a nice sweet stout, with nice swirls of chocolate in it. Goes down smooth and easy, it would be very easy to drink a few of these in one setting if they weren't so thick.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It is soft and frothy with plenty of large and small bubbles. The head only amounts to 1/2 inch.  Smell: Huge infusion of chocolate. Hershey's syrup mixed with a nice chocolate fondue. Malt is present in the background and perhaps there is some cherry cordial but the chocolate is so dominant in the aroma!  Taste: Again, huge in the chocolate department. Thin and milky tasting. This could be the closest a beer has come to becoming chocolate milk. There is a malt profile and no sign of hops. This beer is much different from what most people are used to drinking. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Thin and not very carbonated. The beer is very coating in the mouth however, perhaps because of the frothy head. No alcohol is present, which is very comforting in a stout.  Drinkability: Awesome. I love smoothe, drinkable stouts that are low in alcohol and have plenty of flavor to offer. While not the most complex of beers, this definitely holds a niche and I will certainly try again, maybe in bottle form. Nicely done.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S- Very sweet smelling with a definite English-sense to it. Not all that potent, but thats alright.  T- Wow, now that is some chocolate. Very rich and flavorful. Tastes of cocoa powder and chocolate bar. Very unique.  M- The carbonation is great. The richness kept my mouth watering.  D- A very unique experience.

T - Roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate with a mix of milk chocolate in there as well. Sweet and pungent finish as it warms up a bit.  M - Medium. Right in line with the style.

664,73,Figgy,3.18,"This poured very dark, which to no surprise, gave a rich brown but light head that reminded me of Chocolate Mousse. It gave a slight chocolate smell and had me curious as to what the taste was going to be. I was let down here. There was a chocolate taste, but it was somewhat an empty taste. I didn't want an overpowering chocolate syrup taste, but this was just disappointing. It needs a little more sweetness, although I still would not want to see it too rich. It was more like a Mole' sauce than rich sweet chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tpd975,3.89,"While on vacation in Miami this is the best beer the corner market had stocked. Have had it before but had never reviewed it so here goes.  A: Pours dark black like any stout with a nice thick khaki head. There is minimal lacing. It's your average looking stout.  S: The aromas from this glass are quite nice. Chocolate, Chocolate, and more Chocolate. The chocolate aroma is nice and sweet, milk chocolate. Warm this baby up and you would have the makings of some nice cocoa.  T: The aroma matches the taste. Tons of nice roasted malt comes rushing at you with a wallop of chocolate. The chocolate is semi sweet in taste and makes this beer rather enjoyable.  M: Medium in body drinks like your average stout.  D: Not real drinkable to be honest. It's nice as a dessert but not one you would sit around and pound. If I had some ice cream handy I would turn this into a wonderful beer float.  Overall: Nice chocolate stout. I like Rogues version better, but this one is very good nonetheless. If enjoyed as a dessert beer in moderation it is really quite enjoyable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Overlord,4,"You've got to be in the mood for it, but if you are, this is one grand beer experience.  Pours a dark, dark black with a thick, leathery head. As you may imagine, the taste is pure chocolate. Heck, you could probably use this for a modified root beer float. Some coffee notes, maybe a hint of dark fruit, but there's sweet chocolate, roast chocolate, and bitter chocolate mixed in here.  Delicious, but despite what you may expect, it's not that drinkable (surprising, I know ... but a beer this chocolate flavored exhausts you after a while).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,BucBasil,4.24,"Appearance: Opaque black or very very very dark brown. No light shines through. A perfect finger of creamy tan head sits atop this brew due to the nitro widget or whatever that thing is inside the can. Whatever it is, it makes for a great looking beer.  Smell: Amazing deep smell of hot chocolate with cream. Chocolate syrup is evident, as well as a nice roasted characteristic. I could sit and smell this beer all day. Amazing, and gives me a flood of memories of winter days by a fire slowly sipping hot chocolate.  Taste: A bit different from the smell, revealing more of a dark chocolate note, or a nice roasted coffee. Has a bittersweet finish that sticks in the back of your throat.  Mouthfeel: Oh so creamy due to the nitro widget. I couldn't ask for a better mouthfeel. Goes down perfectly smooth, like a melted milkshake, allowing for a great progression of flavor.  Drinkability: As good as this beer is, and as much as I love the flaovr and the aroma, I couldn't drink a lot of these due to the sheer heaviness of it.

The flavor in the mouth is a cocoa lovers dream. It's so creamy and smooth as the chocolate flavors carress the mouth and bring lingering caramel malts to the tounge.

The nose is of coffee,rich chocolate,slight toffee,malt and yes,more chocolate,it really comes through,i guess that's why it's called double chocolate,very nice enticing aroma. Taste's like black coffee with a hint of licorice with a little bitterness in the middle and dry towards the end,not much chocolate in the taste though. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and creamy smooth with a little dryness comming thru. A very enjoyable beer, especially after dinner or a late evening relax mode drink.This one is actually quite easily to drink,but to me,it does not taste as good as it smells,hey...it still tastes good,don't get me wrong,but the aroma is...appetizing,delicous..Top Notch...very good beer,,well worth trying.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Really active and fairly quick cascade that left an incredibly smooth and uniform tan head... Smell roasted barley and coffee with undertone of the chocolate to come... Tastes pretty much as expected. The choclate comes through nicely, more than is hinted in the nose... Silky, smooth, but not cloying. quite drinkable for a sweet stout.

664,73,kernalklink,3.76,Very sexy-looking brew- deep dark brown pour with the nitro head which is lighter in color than i expected. Huge roasted malt aromas along with some mocha. Big chocolate flavors- king of like hot cocoa made with water instead of milk- but not bad. I like the slight bitterness which come through the slightly sweet chocolate flavors. There is a tannin like astringency in the finish- like bittersweet chocolate and a hint of tobacco. Extremely smooth creamy mouthfeel; the brew slides down so very easy.

Very easy drinking and light on the palate, not quite the heavy mouthfeel and bold flavors that I had expected, but I am still pleasantly surprised.

It slowly dissipated, though, and some lingered. A little lacing. The aroma is chocolate - sweet and creamy, with a note of licorice, too. However, the taste isn't as rich as I was expecting, although it's still good. I can't quite place it - the dark, roasty, chocolatey notes are there, but they're subtle. It feel light and clean, for a stout - there's no strong alcohol to punch you in the face. The hops come through in the finish too, although I couldn't detect them in the nose. It somewhat creamy, and mostly just nice in the mouth. All these features make it easy to drink, too, although not intensely compelling.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T: A smooth, chocolate taste, with the chocolate being more evident in the aftertaste. A nice, dry finish that is typical of stouts. Very good tasting.  M: A nice, smooth mouthfeel that was very silky.  D: Definitely a drinkable beer. The bartender claimed that this stuff filled her up, but I could have drank it all day long.

Very interesting style and was quite impressed with the beer overall.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mortarit,3.31,Lately I have been craving Chocolate Stouts ever since I had that unexpected one from Rogue.  I know that Youngs is a English style which is known to be smooth so I thought about trying it in a chocolate stout.  For the record I think Rogue is better. The chocolate was more present in that one.  As for this one it stated double chocolate which I don't get that impression when I drink it. I am trying to let it warm up a bit too.  Head retention is minamal.  CO2 is really low which I sort of like because it not over demanding.  The after taste is sort lendering. (Bad)  So far it has been a good one but I know their better ones out there so I might get back to this one.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Hemi,4.34,"A - The lovibond is right on the money for a sweet stout, medium to low lacing, and has a decent amount of head for a stout but not more then expected. S - Doesn't have much nose but enough to smell the chocolate and malts. Barely any hop aroma. T - Great tasting. Has a very nice balance of Chocolate but not to the extent of overpowering the other malt profile. I love the fact its not overly sweet as some sweet stouts are however this would be on the minimal range of residual sugars for this beer style. Best taste come out at cellar temperature (55 degrees). M - Has a great mouth feel. Has a bit of a thick feeling however not over powering and may still be used as a higher ABV session beer during the colder months. The carbonation bite is a little sharp for this style but I like it. D - This beer is absolutely fabulous. I recommend ANY stout lovers to try this.

The head lingers for some time and has ample lacing  Smell: A wonderful chocolate smell w/ some caramel mixed w/ it. Not overly sweet smelling and almost no hops.  Taste: I don't believe I have given any drink a 5 for taste but this gives you what it offers. It taste like a light chocolate mocha w/ hints of toffee. Not overly sweet and has slight dryness toward the end as if roasted coffee. This taste better than I imagined from the smell and no hops showed. Fantastic  Mouthfeel: Very light feel that easily glides throughout the mouth. Goes down creamy  Drinkability: Once again this drink is fantastic.

S: Sweet malt with chocolate undertones. T: Milky chocolate taste from the onset. Ale begins to finish a little bitter, but cocoa flavor lingers. Not overly sweet taste, closer to a dark chocolate without the overly bitter bite. M: Very creamy, full, and mouth-coating. D: Few full, milk stouts are able to be imbibed in multiples. This is no exception. One is plenty.  Tasty and enjoyable.  Personally, it reminds me of slowing drinking one of those ominous shots that involve Guinness, Bailey's, and Jameson.

I poured it into a glass and it was about the color of cola with a thin, almost burgundy-to-brownish head. You can really pick up the chocolate aroma. There was a strong presence of chocolate flavor as well. Not sweet milk chocolate but more of a Hershey's Special Dark kind of semi-sweet chocolate. Normally I like beer that just tries to taste like beer but this stuff was pretty good. I liked it. I wouldn't drink it all night, though.

This beer was poured from a can.  The appearance was dark, real dark. Like tar or super strong coffee. It also had a beautiful head, one inch thick or more, with the color of nugget. (think three musketeers ). The head never evaporated, stayed to the last drop.  The smell was also appealing, coffee, caramel, sweet. Even though it""s a stout, there was very little hop flavor, slightly bitter, which I didn't mind. Caramel notes on the tongue, with the perfect hint of chocolate.

Not thick or chewy, but smooth like velvet. This beer was very easy to drink. Like I said "", smooth "". You could easily drink one and not feel overpowered by flavor or alcohol.

S: Like a dark chocolate candy bar, with roasted aroma. Hints of alcohol.  T: Like heaven, haha this tastes better than it smells. Immediately, I thought liquid dark chocolate, with roasted coffe tones. I didn't notice any hop tastes, if they're there its drown out by roasted chocolate. But I love it!

664,73,Atlas1,3.91,"I love crackin' open a nitro can. It reminds me of tennis balls, but usually tastes so much better.  At first pour, the Young's DCS looks like, well, like a chocolate milkshake. Thick and creamy and rich. Then, as the beer settles, it begins to take on more of a definitive stout appearance. Thick and black as night in color with a full-bodied, tightly-packed tan head. When held up to the natural light of the window, nary a peep of light shines through. This is definitely, in a word, stout. The aroma is a bit subdued, but it is all chocolate. Seriously, it's like sticking my nose in a chocolate malt. Pure chocolate and coco. Oh my, and it's quite tasty too. Smooth and clean, it passes easily through the mouth and glides effortlessly down the throat. Lighter than expected, with lots of fruit notes which blend well with the chocolate flavoring. Dry up front, then sweet, with a roasted bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, but silky and smooth.  This is a great beer, even if you're not a huge chocolate fan (which I'm not). Easily consumed year-round, in my opinion, although I'll be more inclined to buy more of it when the weather cools off a bit. Relatively mild ABV is nice too. And it's light enough in texture that you won't feel like you're drinking a loaf of bread as happens with some heavier stouts at times.

Beyond that, there's a thin measure of smoke, spice, and bitterness.  Taste: The taste is brimming with dusty, bittersweet chocolate flavor and sweet maltiness. Hints of espresso and smoke help to round out the flavor. There's a quick burst of dry, hoppiness midway, but it quickly settles into a chalky, chocolaty finish with a sour note on the end.

Let it settle and it's black as night, with that carmel colored head topping it off.  Dark chocolate on the nose. Which is the best smelling chocolate if you ask me. Theres a slight graham cracker smell there too.  It has the taste of hot chocolate with some milk. The milk finishes it off.  It's frothy and creamy. The head retains and laces well.

Maybe it's my untrained nose, but it smells more of cocoa truffles than chocolate malt. Granted there is both in here, but this smells like a glass of chocolate milk than a beer. Still, smells good.  T: The taste isn't what I expected from the smell. The flavor sweet actually comes from the malts, with the cocoa taking a slight bittering role. No hops here that I can pick up. There is a hint of cola flavor that hangs around at the swallow.  M: A little thin for my milk stout preference, but it carries the flavors well enough.  D: All around an excellent night cap.

664,73,CWiggins,3.05,"I've had this beer before on tap at a local Mellow Mushroom restaurant. At the time, I was bowled over by its rich, creamy, bittersweet chocolate flavor. Just tonight, I revisited this classic example of the Milk Stout style, but in a can. I can't say it lived up to the earlier experience. While the brew exhibited most of the same characteristics as its on-tap kin, it just didn't have the same intense flavor profile. The beer poured its dark, dark brown color into my Sam Smith pint glass. While pouring, I heared the ""widget"" bouncing around in the can. This certainly provided a full, dense head and a nice creamy texture to the beer. The aroma was mainly of dark malts; there was very little else to be noticed here. My memory of the taste was of dark malts with a bigand I mean bigdark chocolate flavor. In this version, the malts were certainly present but the chocolate was subdued. It felt as though I were drinking Guinness with a bit of chocolate added. I definitely noticed an improvement as the beer warmed. The creamy mouthfeel of this beer is fantastic, even with the flavors stunted. I'll have to try this again on tap to see if an anomaly has occurred or if there is a real difference between the two.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,nightcrawler,4.22,"Not sure of the difference between the can and bottle, but my sample came from a 14.9oz purple & orange nitro-balled can. When I popped the top, I thought the can was going to overflow by the sound of the nitro. It was quite loud compared to other nitro cans I've used.  But the beer was still strangely 'dead'. The head was thin and I didn't get the mouthfeel I would expect. Not sure of how old the cans were, so that may have been a factor.  That being said, I really enjoyed the taste. Lots of heavy dark flavors on the tongue with a slight sour/bitter in the back of the mouth. A swish-swish-swirl-swirl brought lots of chocolate to the forefront.  I would also say that the serving temperature should be closer to 60deg. The warmer the beer was, the more flavors escaped with the aroma and the better the subtle hints came out during tasting.  This beer would be close to the top of my list when Im thinking of an aromatic stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,josiahschlender,3.96,"Nitro-tap, nice pour into a pint glass at Henry's 12th Street Tavern in Portland. Color is brownish-black, thick tan head has excellent retention all the way to the end. ""Lacing"" doesn't do this one justice. It more leaves a thick foamy coating on the whole glass. (Due to the nitro?) I'm not sure I've seen anything like it before.  Smell is sweet malty, definite milk chocolate, just a little bit of dark roast malts but mostly sweet.  The closest thing I've come to drinking a Hershey's bar in the beer world, for sure. I don't taste much of the bitter, baker's chocolate. It's more the smooth, sweet milk chocolate, with just a bit of dark roast barley and an almost indiscernible amount of earthy hops. Just enough to remind you that it's a beer.  The nitro probably makes this already smooth, creamy stout all the more so. Medium body, sticks in your mouth. I think the ""lace"" is doing the same thing in my mouth, it lasts.  To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of the milk and sweet stouts I've tried but this is my favorite. I like a more bitter, hopped, drier stout. Despite that, this is a quality beer that lives up to its name, my tastes aside. Perhaps part of the reason is that it's hard to pair a beer like this with food for me, except maybe as or with dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Poured black with extremely thick bodied head that sticks to the glass the entire session. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate. The chocolate taste and feel is reminiscent of a milkshake or chocolate milk. The slight coffee bitterness afterwards, leaves you wanting more.

This beer poured pure black with a rich head that clung to the sides of the glass all the way down. Held up to the light, it was totally opaque, nothing came through, no glow even. It smelled like dark chocolate as its name implies with the hint of biterness that goes along with dark as opposed to milk chocolates. In the mouth it felt full and velvety and coated the throat as it went down. A delicious dessert beer, maybe it was because I had worked all day before putting it down, but when I was done, I was sleepy!

664,73,sleazo,4.13,"Can purchased from Key food on Mcguiness.  A_Hard pour produces a cascading effect similar to a nitro stout from tap. Dark brown almost black and opague, no light getting through in this. The fluffy cappacino foam couloured head sits there pretty steadily. It coats the side of the glass. Beautiful.  S-This smells a little like kahlua. Coffee with a little chocolate milk. the sweetness and milk smell definitely come through in the smell.  T-This tastes like an coffee ice cream and chocolate milk shake. It doesnt taste as good as the smell but it is still good. There is some roasted malt flavours going on as well, hop character is undetectable to me. The choclate is probably like a mild dark or a bittersweet.  M-A little mighter than i would want, but there is a ncie creaminess to it. The excellent head retention almost acts like the whipped cream atop the shake. This is my first time having this in the nitro can.  D-As always this is a great dessert beer. It goes well with any sort of dark chocolate. I have always loved this beer, it is definitely different in the nitro can.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,smcreator,4.22,"A: Dark black with thick brown head that sustains during consumption. S: Smells of the milk or dark chocolate taste. Very nice aroma, but a smidge sweet to be using as your go-to favorite smell. T: Tastes very smooth and malty. Much like chocolate, especially as the beer warms up. If served too cold I would imagine you could not taste the complexity or the chocolate flavors. M: Very smooth as if you were drinking chocolate milk. D: This beer is a good dessert beer as it is super sweet. It would be difficult to consume a lot of unless you were doing so with another flavor that was really bitter and salty to cancel out the sweet chocolaty taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Weizenmensch,3.88,"A: As it's pouring into the glass, the brown, viscous liquid settling to a black stout with a dark tan head interests me. The head retention is very good, perhaps not as dense as it would appear if pulled from the cask, but this is an enticing beer to look at.  S: My nose is a bit blocked, unfortunately. I could smell the chocolate as I was pouring it, now I can only detect sweet dark malt, a delicate, faint hop sweetness, and vapours which are probably alcohol (I poured this quite warm, maybe 15C). I don't know if it's just my inability to detect anything but the aromas, while pleasant, don't seem to be especially complex.  T: Stronger than your average milk stout (with chocolate added rather than milk in this case), but an extremely hearty beer nonetheless. I can taste the oats (a really underused and underappreciated grain in all dark ales) and an almost orangey surprise hits me while swallowing, on the back of the tongue. I'm appreciating this more by the second. A gristy grain-fibre flavour on the roof of the mouth near the palate rounds out this beer. Nicely balanced, although this ale succeeds by offering several obvious flavours rather than myriad semi-identifiable ones (I often have that problem with good Belgian dark ales). Finally, there's a nice peat flavour invading my mouth. I had an Ardbeg the other night and this reminds me of that.  M: Smooth. The body is very viscous and calming, almost the consistency of soothing cough medicine (thankfully without that flavour).  D: I wouldn't drink more than one per night, because of the cost (A$7.10). But there is nothing cloying about this brew and if I had the opportunity to drink it on tap, I'd order several.  Overall: A good beer, not necessarily exemplary of the style, but definitely a thumbs up. Personally I prefer milk stouts to be weaker in strength - 5.2%abv is a lot for any English ale, let alone a mild stout. I suppose this isn't just 'any' English ale though, it's an experiment in brewing, and the result is a success.  A few years ago I tried quite a few Young's beers in England, and didn't think they were anything out of the ordinary (at least by England's ale standards). This one is the exception - I will look out for Young's more now, even though there aren't too many that make it to my part of the world.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,brendan13,3.95,A - Pours as black as black can be with a nice thick 1.5 inch beige head. Patchy lacing is left down the glass. S - Chocolate is the first thing to hit the nose but not overwhelmingly so. Roasted barley lurks there too. T - Again chocolate comes through backed up with some coffee and roast barley. A slight sweet nutty flavor is there too. M - Smooth mouthfeel but a little lighter than what I was expecting. D - A very nice beer indeed.

S: Definitely chocolate...however the hops and malt aromas add nicely to the overall aroma (after the chocolate rush subsides). T: The first swig is all chocolate...2nd is everything but the chocolate (which is a great tasting stout in its own right), but the 3rd swig through the end is the whole package. The flavors of the malt, the chocolate and a nice touch of hops make for a well blended and rich stout. M: Very creamy and smooth with light carbonation.

T: Rich and bitter dark chocolate and coffee dominate the front end of this brew. Sweet caramel malts and roasted grain are followed by a soft dark fruit presence and a biscut like taste. Burnt chocolate and more roasted coffee finish slightly dry.  M: Smooth and rich. Minimal carbonation. Slightly dry.  D: A nice desert beer.

Aroma is sweet, creamy chocolate and astringent roasted malts. Taste is more chocolate, nice and creamy with dark roasted malts apparent. The bitterness seems to come largely from the dark malts.

The smell is good, but not amazing.  Taste: Creamy, malty, with a good taste of chocolate milk. There is a touch of bitterness but the flavors are fairly muted. There are nice coffee background flavors, but overall - a little above average.  Mouthfeel: Velvety and...thin? With the smallest touch of carbonation.

Carbonation seems pretty active and the nose riding in all those big fat bubbles is of dark malts, bakers chocolate, and yeast. The flavor is un- sweetened chocolate up front with a grassy hop finish. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin, and also quite crisp and dry. It's not a bad stout, but when you're used to a bigger flavor it's a bit of a letdown. It's certainly worth a try, and with an alcohol by volume of only 5.2% quite sessionable as well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

While light, it has a nice toasted flair with a milk chocolate and coffee backbone.  T - unfortunately, the taste does not match, certainly not in intensity, with the wonderful nose. It falls flat here, and I firmly believe, unless you are just a chocolate stout fan, this is an average tasting beer. It's initial presentation is slightly sweet, with a faint chocolae undertone, and an ultra short finish.

D - Keep in mind this is a nitro-can from across an ocean. I wouldn't think the bottle is better, or even as good, but would love to have a shot at this brew fresh from the source. This is not a sipping beer, it is a pub beer t go enjoy in a group, and maybe in high quanitities. That's the place for this, because most people can't have 10% ABV beers and make it more than an hour or so of lively company.

I had this when in NYC at this resturaunt called Max Brenner, a place specializing in chocolate. For a while I thought drinking Corona and Hieneken was the greatest thing ever, thank god I found this website. Anyways on to the beer! I was served this in a 1pt 6oz bottle with a frosted glass which I let warm up a little. It poured a nice dark black reminding me of guinness. Not much head but about 1/2 head was retained and left lacing on the glass. The smell, although a little hard to remember was of roasted malts and chocolate, I think I wouldn't mind having an air freshener of this smell. The taste was very unexpected. I've drank alot of Guinness because my best friend loves it and buys alot of it. But this is not as bitter and nutty, its very smooth and reminds me more of a dark ale than a stout at first. But then again I'm new at this, so I'm still finding out what to look for when I taste a beer. I very much liked the taste, it went well with my sandwich and chocolate cake desert. I'm not really sure what mouthfeel really is supposed to mean, but if I had to I'd say it was very smooth, perhaps a little thicker than most lagers/ales but not so much that it absolutely dominates your mouth. I coud definately drink several of these, its definately great with deserts or just by itself FOR desert.

M & T - Wow, very first impression was of a chocolate ice cream flaot, very much a dessert beer in taste, wow. A bit thin on the feel though, would have throught it would have been a bit more robust. Nice carbonation made it feel frothy when going down. As it warmed, hints of root beer and hops started to present themselves and round out the taste profile very nicely.

Tan or biege head, that lasted for a few minutes, but didn't leave much lace.  Flavours of chalky dark chocolate, and some roasty toasty malt. Not a really sweet Beer (a good thing). Not too astringent either.  Mouthfeel was nice. It was velvety smooth. Low carbonation. Med-heavy bodied.

It is a kind of rusty brown that kind of waterfalls down into the rest of the body. If you have not seen how this one pours, YOU NEED TO CHECK IT OUT. Something that I noted is that it is not as dark, in color, as most of the stouts that are on the market. It looks creamy and delicious; almost like a milkshake.  Smell- Most notable aromas are of dark chocolate and cream. There are hints of nuts, possibly almonds, and coffee.  Taste- Hands down the most delicious beer that has ever hit my palate. NO SHIT!!!! I never thought I would say that about any single beer. Seeing as how the cream stout is my favorite beer style and that this is (by far) my favorite stout, I could fairly call this my favorite beer.  Mouthfeel- Thick and creamy.

Any guess what the aroma is predominantly of? Yes, it's chocolate. It has a lightly roasty smell, but chocolate predominates. Even that is somewhat more subdued than expected. I decide to ignore the beer for a bit and let it warm, which improves the aroma (and flavor) markedly.  Flavor again has a good deal of what you'd expect. There is a light vanilla flavor and a pleasant bitterness, though I wish there was more of a roasty quality. Also glad this isn't sweeter, though I guess if tinkered with you could make that work with this beer too. It's good, not great, and as it is not that sweet it can work as more than just a dessert beverage (although I rarely recall having it as anything but) Hard not to be disappointed in the mouthfeel. I recall liking the bottled version even less in this respect. In a word - thin. Maybe they found a fuller bodied beer was too much due to the strength of the chocolate, but whatever - I still wish there was more to this.  Quite drinkable...one glass, that is. Another?

The taste is complex with a full array of flavors; not just chocolate as the name suggests, but also a slight toffee and (I think!) slightly nutty. It is very smooth and rolls around in your mouth. It has a strong malty taste but is balanced with just the right touch of hops. I highly recommend getting this on tap - the canned and bottled versions, even with the widgets, do not do this justice.

D- Once in a while the beer is fine, but I wouldn't make it a habit.  I have had this before in the UK, and several years ago in the US. I was expecting it to have a stronger flavor. It must be the recent Imperial Stouts I sampled recently.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,PhiloPsych,4.16,"I had this on tap at Yardhouse in Irvine, CA. On their menu, the ""Double"" was omitted from the name, but this is the only relevant listing I can find, so I assume this is the beer I had. I had it with a ham and pineapple pizza and back-to-back with Bayhawk Chocolate Porter so that I could compare the two.  The head was very thick, dense, and frothy; it remained all the way to the last drink and left not lacing, but a thick frothy mousse all the way down the glass. The first thing I noticed with my first sip was the mouthfeel. This is a very, very creamy beer--it certainly does justice to the style of ""milk stout."" It almost felt like I was drinking a pint of cream. Almost as quickly, I noticed the very nice sweetness of the beer. Sweet cream would be an apt description of this beer. After a few more sips, the roasted malt flavors became more noticeable. Chocolate and coffee notes were subtle, but there. As the beer warmed it came to taste somewhat more complex. This is a very nice, good beer.  The sweetness and roasted malt of this beer went very well with my meal. I preferred this to the Bayhawk. I would have liked to compare it to the Young's Oatmeal Stout that they also had on tap. I had had taster size portions of both before and am glad I came back to this one; I'll definitely come back both Young's Chocolate and Oatmeal sometime again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,YankChef,3.79,"Drank from a 500 ml bottle.  Smells of deep, dark chocolate and sweet milky aromas  Taste is rich and complex of dark rich chocolate. Malt dominates and hops are barely even noticable on the palate.  This was definitely a sipper as it was very rich and creamy. Still an enjoyable brew although i was a little bit let down i was expecting a little more from this brew.

I poured it the ""Guinness way"" and the head looked okay for a minute but faded very soon.  Aroma: Dry. Roasted malt.  Taste: Smooth and deep. If I really concentrate on it, I can taste some dark chocolate, but not much. Not a lot of coffee flavor, which is what I generally like in the style. It tastes a lot like a cigar, really.  Notes: A friend brought me this one from Atlanta  Thanks M_D! The taste was overwhelmingly like a cigar. The Wife didnt really care for it, but I enjoyed it.

Delicious and hearty chocolate and dark crusted malt bread.

Pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with tan highlights; one finger of tan head that dissipates quickly.  Rich chocolate on the nose, some hop edge, a little bit of bitter alcohol. Taste follows up wonderfully, predominantly malty, just the right amount of chocolate sweetness in the center followed by a nice balance of mellow and dry English hops. Smooth and silky, but not remotely syrupy - eminently drinkable, especially when colder (as it gets warmer, the finish gets a bit astringent). Some nice warm powdery chocolate lingers.

Poured into a pint glass with a thick (1-2 cm) and very long-lasting and very creamy head that's off-white in color. The color is black, with some hints of red-brown under a light. Smells fantastic of sweet milk chocolate - like you stuck your nose into a bag of good milk chocolates - that's the dominant smell - hardly any roasted malt or smoke smell. There's some lacing, but not a lot. It has a great mouthfeel - creamy and delicious and hardly any bubbles - like drinking a glass of milk.

An excellent balance of roasted malt flavor with the chocolate background. Thick on the tongue leaving behind a malt & chocolate coating.

The scent is entirely chocolate syrup.  Tastes like hot chocolate with underlying dark fruit. Some vanila and molasses. There's a roasty bitterness here which balances the beer and causes it to taste less sweet and chocolatey than the name implies. Very slight hops at the finish and some unsweetened baking cocoa which can get a bit chalky.  Mouthfeel is a silky, creamy medium. I'd prefer a thicker bolder mouthfeel but this is quite good for the relatively low abv.  Drinkability suffers a bit because for some reason this beer fills me up more than any other. I've never drunk it and desired a second.  Not my favorite chocolate stout but certainly not a bad one. I think the bitter chalky aftertaste and the slightly syrupy quality throw me on this one. I prefer Sam Adams Cream stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Let it sit and a mellow dark chocolate flavor comes out. This beer looks great though. And you're really into appearance, the thick lacing and head on this can't be beat.

664,73,kajerm,3.16,"Well, I asked for it and I got it-- Young's in a nitro can. Poured opaque jet black with a creamy, thick, majestic nitrogen head. The bubbles sink in the glass, and I point this out to my girlfriend. She is in awe. She hasn't had much Guinness.  Chocolate and coffee notes dominate the nose; the estery banana notes I picked up in the bottled version are nowhere to be found. The beer has a nice creamy mouthfeel (thanks to that miraculous little widget.) The flavor profile is essentially the same as in the bottled version-- dark malt, chocolate, and coffee up front, hops (and maybe some black malt bitterness) in the back.  But there's trouble in paradise. The nitrogen seems to have blunted the flavor somewhat, making this beer much less intense and less viscerally satisfying. It gets worse. About five sips in, a coiny, metallic note came out and started to crowd out all the other flavors. This is, at least for me, one of the nastiest faults a beer can have. I don't think it came from the can, but whatever it is, it's unpleasant. The metallic taste didn't completely ruin the beer for me, but it came pretty damned close.  I'm going to give this another shot (I've got two left)-- hopefully it will have just been an off can. I sincerely hope that I have a good reason to rerate-- I had high hopes for this beer.  RERATE: Dammit. This beer looked even more stunning than it did yesterday, stubbornly opaque with a great big off-white head and lacing that defied at least two major laws of physics. The first few sips were pretty nice (but still more muted than the bottled version), but the honeymoon ended around sip four. This beer still tastes like pennies.  Now there's only one ray of hope left-- drink it on tap...",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,BeerSox,4.63,"14.9oz nitro-can into mug.  This is such a fun beer to watch out of the nitro-can! The enite beer starts out tan with a quarter inch head at the top. Slowly, the light tan head stars cascading downward, as the midnight black color of the beer rises to the top. The head becomes thicker, to about an inch, as the beer keeps turning black. After a few minutes, the beer is solid black with a thick solid frothy head that does not quit (so far it has lasted for about 5 mintues without dropping a millimeter). Web like lacing along the glass.  A little bit of dark malt aroma is hidden behind a strong dark chocolate scent.  Delicious and creamy chocolate flavor mixes well with the bitter burn flavor of the malts. The sweet chocolate battles with the bitterness of the malts. A little bit of hop twang is tasted in the finish. The beer is full bodied and incredibly smooth. The finish is lightly bitter with a bit of sticky hop bitterness.  This is one fine beer! The nitro-can gives it supreme creaminess, however I enjoyed the flavor a little better out of the bottle.

T- Here the chocolate becomes the tour de force as if a delicious Hershy bar had been melted into the beer. The malt and cream are also pretty powerful. Hops bitterness comes out slightly in the back of the mouth and more in the aftertaste which lends some dark fruity flavors of prunes and blueberries. But mostly milk chocolate sweetness  D- It covers your mouth in milky goodness as if you had a sample creamer.

There is not much smell, but who cares! Just drink it already!  Smooth, smooth, smooth. The nitro carbonation is hardly noticeable until you think about it, this is a heavy stout, by the looks of it, but it feels like cool liquid silk. Drink this beer cool, not cold! The sweet chocolate taste and mild bitterness from the roasted barley are in perfect balance.  Yes it's a stout, but I can see one drinking this anytime of year.

664,73,hammer09,3.83,"This is my second review of this beer. Having tried this a second time, I'm now convinced that the low rating of my first review was likely the result of sampling an off-specification batch or perhaps a beer that was too old.  Appearance is typical for a stout, dark brown to black with a moderately creamy head. However, head retention was on the low side.  Unlike my previous review, there is a definite aroma of chocolate infused with this beer, although a bit subtle. Other smells included toasted and roasted malts.  Taste is good with a nice balance of chocolate sweetness to the beer's roasted bitterness.  Mouthfeel is creamy and lightly carbonated, typical of this style.

Let's see...None of the reverse-cascading head effect so loudly touted on the sides of nitro-cans, but what we have is decent nevertheless: dark chocolate brown body with a modest but sticky, crater-marked dusty tan head. Soft cocoa aromas along with some slightly sour black roasted malt scents. Reminds me of chocolate flavored licorice whips. That soft, chewy cocoa flavor is present at various points throughout the taste, but it is also interspersed with some dark-roasted graininess that borders on burnt. Some mild dark berry notes are in there, too, along with some well-placed and well-restrained residual sugars. Just sweet enough to remind you that it's a lacto-stout, but nothing too overbearingly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth enough, remaining full-bodied while never feeling too heavy on the palate.

Not very big (once the cascading stops), but it looks like it has a lot of staying power. Not as much lace as I expected.  Aroma- Not much aroma at all. I got a rush of malt sweetness and molassass when I opened the can. Some nice toffee overtones to. But there just ain't much there.  Taste- Nothing overpowering. But a nice burnt /sweet malt taste that you know is there. You get a failry strong chocolate back there in the background in all parts of your mouth. No flavoring hops at all (not that I expected any), but the bittering hops are very mellow and perfectly balance out the malt sweetness. You also get notes of sweet coffee and tofee towards the back of your mouth. Very nicely done..  Mouthfeel: Lots of body, and very creamy. This stuff is impressive.

The head was a light brown, and thick and creamy.  S- Chocolate and roasted malt. A great preview to the experience the beer offers.  T- Chocolate creaminess, roasted malts, and a hint of coffee. Leaves an aftertaste very similar to that of hot chocolate, which was predicted given the name. A very tasty treat.  M- Very thick and creamy, even for a stout.  D- It goes down smooth, but at the end of this beer I am always ready to move on to something else.

The stout is a brilliant brown, with a frothy head that unfortunately lacks the retention you'd imagine after initial pour.  The smell is one dominated by coffee, but a cheap roast at best.  Tasting it, it's definately very chocolate, but also has strong coffee and dark ruit flavours. I'd almost recommend they name it a coffee stout as opposed to double chocolate stout; the caffeen flavour is far more prominant in my opinion.  The mouthfeel is a little less smooth than expected, and due to my dislike for coffee and the similarity in taste to Cadbury's Fruit & Nut chocolate bars, I don't paticularly appreciate the aftertaste either.

The beer poured a dark brown, almost black, forming a thick 1/2 inch creamy head that never let up, with a nice cascading affect. Thick rings of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is of nice chocolate, just like chocolate milk. The taste is very creamy, sweet, and chocolaty. Nice roasted malts all the way from start to finish. The mouthfeel, IMO, is just right for this style of stout. From my experiences, milk stouts, normally have a lighter mouthfeel, than you would expect from a stout like Sierra Nevadas or Saint Arnolds. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer.

T: Sweet and chocolatey with a mild roasty finish. Mild for a stout, and the 5.2% correlates with that.  M: Mild and very smooth, but watery past the halfway point of the drink.

Smell: A roasted chocolate and molasses aroma.  Taste: A nice mild sweetness that blends with a slightly roasted huge chocolate flavour that balances well with malts.

664,73,Andreji,3.95,"I found the double chocolate stout to be a very special beer. We were having this nice couple of chocolate-related beers and along came the dcs. Pour was very american stoutish with nice little head. smell wasn't too chocolatey, much rather seemed coffee filled but still attractive, some roasted malts were also evident.  The taste is very well structured, with an initial strong dark (and bitter) chocolate feel immediately followed by a rush of overloaded roasted coffee (sort of an espresso feel if you catch my drift). Ends in a bitter sensation. body isn't too full, much less like eating a chocolate bar and much more like drinking a cup of coffee with a dipped cote d'or inside or something.  overall a beer worth buying over and over, but it may be a bit too heavy for regular use.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ChazMania,2.12,"bottled. dark pour with a thick consistency.

It has a smooth feel to it but it still lacks something, it simply doesn't caress your mouth like a some beers do; it feels cold and leaves you longing for something more. It does have a good taste to it sort of sweet with a good bittery aftertaste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Pretty good lacing remains around the glass. Mouthfeel is a liitle thin and the taste doesn't quite meet the expectation the smell sets for it.

664,73,ZimZamZoom,4.55,"On tap at the Yardhouse in Scottsdale, AZ.  This poured deep black with an incredibly creamy tan head. The head stayed with me all the way to the bottom of my pint. Some amount of surging (for lack of a better term) going on between the beer and the head until it finally settled at about two finger's worth. Really quite beautiful to behold in the glass.  Smells of roasted coffee, roasted dark malts, and sweet chocolate. Mmmm.  Taste is about the same. Delicious is the word that comes to mind. Just so smooth and creamy, I really struggle to find the words to describe it!  Mouthfeel is out of this world. Creamy, smooth, thick and wonderful.

Light brown/ tanned head small streams of bubbles flowing up the side of the glass. Wonderfull head and retention. Perfect lacing in a symetrical pattern. Perfect.  Smell: Pretty faint compared to what I was expecting. Some burnt malt, stout-like aroma. Faint hops aroma, crisp ut a littel disapointing. Improved as it cooled revealing more burnt malts.  Taste: Heavy burnt /bitter malt profile hits you hard. Sweet chocolate in the background while a nice beefy coffee hit presents itselfs. Hops balance the massive malt profile pretty well. A touch of alcohol. Wonderfully complex stout. Love the heavy bitterness. Not as chocolatey as I predicted but so damn yummy still. Theres a wonderfull sweet coffee like flavour across the back of the pallate. Aftertaste is a combination of charcol bitterness balanced well with a hop profile.  Mouthfeel: Thick and packed to the brim with body. Invitingly dry the way it gets you to drink even more though you know it will just make your mouth dryer. Sweet up front with a balanced bitterness easy as to drink, low carbonation. A little oily/buttery.  Drikability: A beer this flavourfull couldnt get much easier to drink.

Once the beer settles you are left with a creamy light tan head of supper fine nitro bubbles. The beer itself is pitch black. When they say Double Chocolate they mean it. Smell is of milk chocolate. This is the sweet chocolate too, many times a chocolate beer has the bitter bakers chocolate smell and taste but this is very sweet. Some roasted dark malts peek though. Taste matches the smell but gets just the slightest knock in score for just being a little too sweet. Mouthfeel is velvety (according to my wife). I would have just said very smooth.

Smell is pure milk chocolate with a hint of coffee beans. The taste is only slightly disappointing. It is to be sure 'double chocolate'. In fact, it practically tastes like a chocolate milk shake. At first, it seems thick and satisfying. Definitely sweet. But somehow it weakens as it warms, and becomes more and more watery...somehow...? This is one that gives a great first impression, but loses character over time. Not the best chocolate stout in the world. Good mouthfeel, and relatively drinkable. Worth trying.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Basically, this looks like a huge espresso (perhaps... an americano?) with a dark dark brown body and a small, unwavering, off-white head with lacing so thick i wouldn't even call it lacing. coating is more like it.  S - Smells like hot cocoa from a powder-packet, booze, and some roasted notes.  T - Rich, creamy chocolate with noticible, almost burbon-like alcohol presence. Some ""hello!""s of bitterness from the hops and ""hey there!""s from the roasted malts in the finish, but, mostly, boozey cocoa. also, there's a slight medicinal quality during the second or third breath after the swallow. weird. That flavour seems to grow and grow the longer i drink this.  M - Smooth, medium bodied, creamy. Low carbonation. Real nice.  D - I thought i could drink this forever at the beginning of the glass, but, by the end, i wanted to pour it out. it's the sweetness that makes this beer hard to finish. like cream soda, i'm always excited for the first few sips, but then i get sick of it. quick.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Excellent retention and lacing  S- Faint chocolate here but not much - perhaps too cold, so let the beer warm. As it did warm, a waxy 2nd rate chocolate smell came through. Not exactly Lindt. Some roasted malt and a faint smokey cigar hint as well.Perhaps a faint touch of cinnamon or apple strudel aswell  T- Much better as the beer warms, quite Luxurious. a Nice balance between chocolate and roasted malt. From previous reviews i expected this to be nothing but chocolate, i didnt find this. Notes of burnt toast bitterness and cigar smoke qualities  M- Low carbonation, nice creaminess, medium to full body  D- Gets tastier at a warmer temperature.

Taste was very dark, slightly bitter, yet still with some sweetness to it. Perhaps my palate just isn't refined enough, but I didn't really notice much chocolate flavor. Slightly nutty with extremely vague hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel was very heavy, not syrup-like, but close. This might turn some people off, but I didn't mind it.

The pour from the half liter bottle into my Fuller's nonic raises a two finger medium tan head, significantly darker than its nitro brothers. The head settles slowly, leaving impressive lacing as it does. The body is a virtually opaque brown-ruby. The nose is like smelling a milk chocolate bar with stout spilled on it. There's a hint of roastedness, and a good bit of sweetness. Perhaps just a bit of coffee, too. That lovely sensation comes through so well in the taste: creamy just like a cadbury bar. The chocolate fully dominates the flavor, with just a little bit of acidity. I feel that more flavor comes through than on nitro. The mouth manages to be quite smooth without the nitrogen, and has a very fine but noticeable acidity.

Appearance: black opaque pour with minuscule nitro bubbles building up a tan milky, resilient creamy head that maintains its own all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Smell: semi sweet chocolate morsels and dark roasted malts.  Taste: chocolate tootsie rolls, black coffee, raspberries. Hop bitterness in the swallow. Not dessert sweet, but full-bodied.  Mouthfeel: silky smooth, very mild carbonation, thick and chewy.  Drinkability: goes down easily like a melting chocolate bar. While the alcohol is rather mild, I wouldn't drink many of these at any one time. Could get chocolate overload. Definitely a great dessert in itself.

Starts nice semi sweet and ends chocolate bitter that has a short duration taste.  drinkability: smooth and tasteful. Can drink this all day long.  Overall, my wife and I really enjoyed this brew. The chocolate aroma is very intoxicating. We could not stop smelling this stuff. The flavor is right on cue with what you are smelling. You can have it with dessert but my wife and I had it with homemade tomato soup and a grilled turkey and cheese sandwich. It felt as if we were drinking a yoo-hoo. I know strange but what can I say.

A nice pour produced a full two finger head, slightly tan, perched on top of the dark brown beer.  Smelled of chocolate, Not much else.  First sip: This tastes like a chocolate seltzer water. It is not the smooth texture that I was expecting, it was more like water, like sombody dropped a hershey bar in my budweiser. It was very carbonated. A beer should be carbonated, but this was weird.  Taste: Not much up front, I had to search for the chocolate in the background. I found a metalic taste in the aftertaste. Like it was from a can.  There was a decent amount of lace on the side of the glass.  There must be something wrong. I love stouts and this was not up to par.

664,73,Umbra,4.77,"Sampled on tap at Max's. Pours super dark brown, just about as un-transparent as one could get. Dark tan head with loads of retention and lacing. Very full roasted malt and chocolate nose.  This is the smoothest, most drinkable chocolate stout in memory. Flavor is gigantic, full of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Finishes surprisingly dry, which helps with finishing it. As with real chocolate, which was probably used in the manufacture, the vanilla brings out the fullness. Perfect carbonation and flavor make this one very drinkable. Had at the same time w/ a Brooklyn choco, and this one was hands down better.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,auntfloyd,4.3,"Served from a 500 ml bottle into an imperial pint glass.  Pours a totally opaque, deep dark brown, almost black, with about one finger of dark tan head, with excellent retention.  The nose was chocolate and roasted malt. Nice.  The taste is smooth roasted malt at first, which is followed by a big taste of milk chocolate, and slightly bitter dry finish. This is a chocolate beer through and through, and the slightly sweet flavor gets it absolutely right. This beer is made with actual chocolate, in addition to chocolate malts, and it shows.  The mouthfeel is good, very smooth with good levels of carbonation. Very drinkable.  This is one of the best chocolate stouts, and one of the best stouts period. Not as overpowering as other chocolate stouts (like Brooklyn), and better for it. A great beer, especially in the wintertime.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,umfskibum,4.52,"Appearance: Almost pure black. CREAMY head, really a thing to behold. The head stuck around for a while, and nice lacing as well.  Smell: Woah nelly. Some bready malt, but smells more of chocolate - almost like a chocolate milkshake. Really a rich scent. As Ron would say, it stings the nostrils.  Taste: Not just chocolate, but milk chocolate. The good kind. A little bitter, but again, milk chocolate dominates the taste. The roast malt taste comes through in the end, but it is really just a complex, tasty chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel: A little thin for the rich taste, but silky smooth. Pleasant carbonation that isn't over the top.  Drinkability: Not a beer I'd want to have more than one or two of at once, but definately something I can see myself craving again. Well worth having, and could find its way on to many stout-lovers' list of favorites.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mynie,4.35,"Pours a very dark red. Quick poor from a nitro tap, so there's no head. Nice lacing, though.  Smells of nitrogen and incredibly rich, sweet chocolate.  Tastes of nitrogren and incredibly rich, sweet chooclate. This actually tastes much nicer than it sounds. The chocolate is straight up milk chocolate--none of the dark chocolate bitterness here--and it blends well with the clean, foamy flavor of the nitrogen.  Not exactly the most intense or layered of stouts, but the pure sweet kick makes for one hell of a desert beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

This is an exceptional brew. It has an almost creamy mouthfeel and the chocolate stands out in the flavor but doesn't overpower the taste.  It also is giving me a bit of a buzz. It's a full English pint and I'm sure the alcohol content is well above 5%.  Overall, I'm glad I picked it up.

Mouthfeel: Creamy goodness.  Drinkability: I think this is more sessionable in cans than bottles.  I had not had this one in a while, and last time it was in a bottle. I'd say the bottle brings out more sweetness and chocolate than the can version. A very good sweet stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Slight vanilla, cocoa, and a hidden soft roastiness under the chocolate. Taste is more bittersweet chocolate than the cocoa nose. The roasted malt is more evident along with a balancing bitterness. Not too sweet yet very chocolatey. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and satiny. Good sized fullish body to hold up the double chocolate.  Mmmm Chocolate.

Big, spumescent cocoa head floats on top eventually dropping down to a thin, bubbly cap that holds up well. Smells like chocolate. Real chocolate. Sweet, rich, and creamy. Dark, malty flavor doesn't quite match the smell in richness, though its still good. Plenty of bittersweet chocolate. Silky mouthfeel but it isn't as heavy as I'd like it to be.

S - Smells like chocolate milk, cream, hard chocolate candies, rootbeer, and malted milk balls. Hints of vanilla and sugar also. Cream cheese notes also.  T - Heavily creamed and sugared coffee. Rich milk, whipped cream, very sweet and sugary milk chocolate yoohoo flavor. Sweetness becomes more dark and bitter towards the dry finish with a bit of roasty grains. Could be a little more roasty and stout IMO to balance the overpowering sweetness.  M - Slick and sugary. Full bodied and creamy.  D - Pretty good as a desert beer, but too heavy and sugary to consume more than one of. I will surely rrevisit this fine chocolatey brew, but IMO the sweetness and sugary milk chocolate flavor is a bit overdone.  I think that next time I will get this in a bottle. It seems that other reviewers feel that the bottled version is less thick and sugary. IMO those are the exact qualities that I feel are overdone in this brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Also had pretty good lacing throughout. The smell was excellent and strong of bittersweet chocolate and chocolate malts. The taste was also excellent. Was chocolaty throughout and had just a little bitterness in the back. I would rate it higher if it had just a little more bite to offset the sweetness. Mouthfeel was good - just a little watery. Would rate higher if were a little more creamy. Overall, a great beer that I would never turn down and would definitely have in avail on tab. For home consumption, a good quarterly treat.

Great retention.  Smell: I first ordered an Aventinus, but the keg had kicked, so I got this instead. I was disappointed until I took a whiff of the aroma. The head unleashes a flurry of chocolate and toffee.  Taste: The taste didn't quite live up to the nose, but it had a lot to live up to. There is chocolate, roasted malts, and a light English hop presence. No toffee though. Oh, well.  Mouthfeel: The body was soft and creamy like other nitro beers.  Drinkability: This is tremendous. It's actually better with nitrogen than it is in the bottle. I still don't get it, but I'd rather drink it then ponder the mystery.

Malty flavors, some coffee as well. Sweet, but not cloying.  M - Medium bodied, creamy, I hesitate to say ""sensual,"" but will do so nevertheless.

Taste is sublime, smooth chocolate with a light bitter hop twist, the hops really do a good job of not making this brew not taste like a liquid candy bar.  This has been one of my favorite beers ever since I started drinking good beer, and is hands down the best from Young's, IMO. Do seek out this brew, as I have yet to have a Chocolate or Milk Stout that can come close to the taste and drinkibility of this one.

This one seemed like it would start off decent enough, but really kicked in with the flavors and mouthfeel, which were quite delightful.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Realale,3.05,"Deep brownish black. 1"" light tan nitro head doesn't move during the consumption of the pint, apart from what sticks to my upper lip.  Nose is brown bread maltiness, with nicely integrated dark chocolate notes. Not overly complex, but quite nice. Sadly, it's the highlight.  A bit of a let down in the mouth. Initially, just some non-descript maltiness, but things start happening in the mid-palate when the chocolate malt notes kick in. Pretty short but slightly sweet finish.  Nasty undead nitro mouthfeel. Despite being something of a novelty brew, it's fine for matching with not too sweet chocolate desserts, which is the context in which I had it. I wouldn't want two in a sitting though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Envious,4.45,"From the multicolored can to the mysterious sound of the nitro-capsule I was expecting the unexpected. I was not disappointed. A liquid dark chocolate poured into my glass. It's appearance, aroma, and taste fully reinforced this initial image. My fiance, who is not in any way a beer fan, insisted on trying this one after the smell drifted in her direction. Our mutual assesment of this brew is that double chocolate is no gimmick, but a straight up statement of what's in store. Very smooth and creamy, sweet with a heavy aftertaste this full bodied stout is one we'll enjoy again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,brdc,3.95,"It pours a very dark beer, with a smooth tan head. Complex smeel includes bittersweet chocolate, coffee, burnt sugar, caramel. Taste is mostly sweet, a nice chocolate but has hints of caramel (Caramilk, the swiss/canadian chocolate comes to mind) and a lightly bitter coffee that gives it some balance. Medium body, definitely lighter than you would expect, but that also increases its drinkability. I could easily have three or four of this delicious beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,wanker,3.85,"I'd describe this beer as ""complex"". Complex in terms of having a variety of interesting flavor components. Every part of the tongue is stimulated - sweet, salty, bitter, sour.  My palate isn't sophisticated, so I couldn't pick out any chocolate, but I knew what I was drinking was something extraordinary.  I enjoyed the beer. Even my wife, who isn't a beer fan, commented that ""it really tastes like something, not just bitter.""  Mouthfeel was pleasant, but it didn't rise to sublime level of its sibling, Young's Oatmeal Stout.  I'd certainly order it again, but if I had a choice between this one and a Young's Oatmeal Stout, I'd go with the oatmeal (Alas, I think the oatmeal has been discontinued).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T - Tastes like an Irish Car Bomb shot, stout with a shot of whiskey dropped in, really not enjoyable, little chocolate taste in the finish which makes it kind of nice but the rest of the experience kind of cancels it out.

Smell is that of, guess what, chocolate. It was what I imagine Charlie would have smelled opening up a Wonka bar. Absolutely delicious but not overwhelming.  When the beer first hit my lips, it seemed as though I had a milkshake in my hands. I also picked up hints of root beer. Mmmm... a root beer float. Of course, there are the usual roasty malt flavors with some caramel hints as well.  Mouthfeel is nice with a medium/full body.  Drinkability is also good, but you may not want to go all night on it... unless your regular dessert is ""Death by Chocolate"".

Super dark (opaque) color, no light comin' through this one. Nice tan creamy head. Smells of nice Colombian Andes coffee with Toblerone.

664,73,nouseforotacon,3.66,"Tall, 440mL nitro-can of Young's Stout with a widget. I love milk/sweet stouts, especially as the weather gets colder. High expectations for this one.  Pours out a thick, jet black bottom with a cascading rush of carbonation. Deliciously creamy looking tan head that floats atop the body and maintains its one-finger height. Mmm.  Soapy, chalky aroma with some coffee notes. Sweet malts and a slight alcohol presence. Touch of cream on the nose. Decent.  Creamy foam head hits the tongue first. Very milky. Some dark chocolate notes linger around. Initial hop bitterness that fades out after the first couple of sips. Brew really gives way to coffee/chocolate, as they dominate the taste. Some sweet malts, but not much of a really defined malt profile. Tasty, but unfortunately a bit too watery. Strong coffee in the finish, pure coffee beans.  Not bad, definitely drinkable and enjoyable. Coffee bean finish leaves this one a little dry at the end, but mouthfeel is mostly watery. Creamy foam head leaves me with a little bit of a much welcomed illusion.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DieselSnorter,4.67,"I picked this up on a recommendation. I'd never had a chocolate stout before, and I was anxious to try one. Not knowing what to expect, my mouth was awaiting something along the lines of a fizzy YooHoo.  It poured pitch black , which is exactly what I expected, along with a nice heavy head that was just shy of a cooked marshmallow color. The head stayed around for a good long time and left heavy lacing all the way down.  The smell was amazing. So much going on, and it was all dominated by one of my favorite things, chocolate. I thought it was fantastic and kept smelling the glass and bottle over and over.  The mouthfeel was a thick and creamy, and turned foamy as I held it in my mouth. Not a lot of bite from the bubbles. I think it suited the flavor very well.  Taste: Okay, this is far from a fizzy YooHoo. But I really enjoyed it. It has a lot of the flavor of a traditional Stout, but there are hints of chocolate. After you swallow it down, you're treated to a nice rush of chocolately flavor aftertaste.  I found it very drinkable, other than the fact it left me feeling bloated and full. I found myself wanting another one the next day. I don't think its the perfect beer but I really, really enjoyed it. I couldn't believe that two great things could be mated together so well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerRun13,3.93,Super dark. A slight reddish/brown shows through where it's thin. A super thick multiple inch creamy tan head sits on top with a very light pour. Heavy cocoa aroma. Very much like baking cocoa powder. A touch of roasted malt. More of a milk chocolate flavor. Maybe some hops in there to provide a touch of balance. Full bodied and strangeley carbonated. Very silky texture and soft on the palate. Almost to silky plain for my tastes. I may prefer the bottled version a bit more simply because of the mouthfeel difference. Still is a very nice beer.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Excellent aroma of walking into a candy shop with the sweet smell of fresh chocolate and caramel in the air. Taste was more muted than the aroma, but still very much sweet chocolate. Finish was a little watery, but overall, a stout beer well worth drinking.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,xoqx,4.47,"Poured in the light, this looks like dark coffee or root beer cascading into the glass. Once there, it seems pitch black and has a substantial foamy head that is a gradient from nearly brown near the beer fading to a tan near the top. The head retains well and leaves droopy lacing that eventually settles back down into the beer save a few islands along the edge of the glass. The smell is of chocolate and deep malts from well roasted barley. There is anise and plum and herbs and rooty confectioners chocolate all up in my grill when Im smelling this. There is just so much in the nose here. The taste is so balanced and fantastic, I dont know where to begin. It rich and creamy and properly carbonated with chocolate very pervasively, but not overly strongly exploding across the palate. There are deep rooty essences and a non-descript fine bitterness throughout, nothing floral. It tastes like powdery chocolate, but totally no artificial. And I want to gulp this beer; dangerously so. This is a superb after dinner beer. The mouthfeel is creamy and crisp, soft and dark, but very present.

If you've ever walked in to a real chocolatier's shop, this brew offers the same olfactory experience. In the glass, it looks like strong coffee with a creamy two-finger head -- quickly subsiding. The flavor is. . . wow! It's like I've raided the fridge and started eating chocolate sauce by the spoonful. Absolutely delicious. The finish is something I could get used to. . . chocolate coffee with a slight hint of bitterness.

664,73,jtell,3.43,Pours a black thick beer with a fluffy white head. Smells of chocolate and malt. Tastes basically the same. Not nearly as rich as I was expecting it be.

Think it would go really well with some vanilla ice cream though.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,cmmprez,4.53,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is most definitely a comfort beer for me. Upon opening the can and pouring it out I can already sense my body relaxing and am anticipating its smooth texture and sweet taste. I know it's been stated many times before but it has the appearance of Guinness Draught. The aroma is similiar to a malted chocolate milkshake (of course). Upon initial tasting, you palate is overwhelmed by the silky texture and chocolate taste. It really does remind me of a milkshake. As it warms in the glass, the chocolate fades and the bitterness comes out more. The smooth mouthfeel changes to a more traditional average to thick viscosity of a stout. The aftertaste leaves a mild roasitness behind mixed with faint semisweet chocolate. After a glass of this, there is no need or want of another. This is great for a dessert beer!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MikeyHamilton,4.08,"Trying to broaden my beer horizons so to speak, I hit up the liquor store on my way home from work in search of an Irish Stout that didn't rhyme with ""Guinness."" Not surprisingly, this particular liquor store didn't offer much in terms of selection. In fact, they offered just three different types of Irish Stout - Guinness (no surprise there), Murphy's and Young's Double Chocolate Stout.  Familiar with both Guinness and Murphy's (they're constantly on stock in this household) my choice was an easy one - I had a one on one date with Young. This is neither here nor there, but I paid $9.99 (before tax) for a four pack. Naturally, I saw it selling for $8.49 at a different liquore store two days later. Go figure.   If we start with appearance, the beer has a thick, creamy head that settles quite nicely. Its color is similar to Guinness in that it is, well, black. There's no way in hell you'll see any sort of light permeating through this beers thick body.   Smell wise, I noticed hints of chocolate and mocha. No surprise there. The chocolate aroma certainly stands out but it isn't overpowering.   This is a perfect case of taste mimicking smell. I noticed definite signs of chocolate and mocha on my palate. The good news? The beer wasn't so rich that I felt like I was drinking a dessert. In this case, the name ""Double Chocolate"" is a bit deceiving. I was pleasantly surprised, as I'm not a huge fan of that which tends to be too sweet.   No big surprises in the mouthfeel category. The beer is smooth, thick and creamy. Silk-like even. It's what you would expect from a good Irish Stout. Furthermore, the beer is crisp and reasonably carbonated.   Drinkability? I sipped (and I stress the word ""sipped"" because this is a beer that you'll certainly want to take your time drinking) and finished two in a little over an hour. You'll want to pace yourself on this particular beer, savor the chocolate and mocha aromas and flavors, and let your palate have a little bit of fun.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

It's not a terribly powerful aroma, but it's there.  T: Hell yeah. This is rich, creamy, smooth and tasty. Up front is some milk chocolate and moves into a very VERY VERY light bitterness. There's a mild roasted flavor as well that piggybacks this. Finish has some hot cocoa thing going on. But the focus is the chocolate, bar none.  M: Silky and creamy.

Poured black with a dark brown ruby edge with a large creamy mostly lasting light brown head with good lacing.  Smelt of moderate pure real chocolatey goodness with slight dark chocolate malt undertones.  Taste was upfront moderate bitter dark chocolate roastiness and light milk chocolatey sweetness followed by a moderate semi sweet chocolatey desert feel that lingers perfectly. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, slightly dry, fizzy with light astringency.  Overall, holy shit, somebody threw some vanilla ice cream in my beer and it tastes like a chocolate milkshake beer float and I think I like it.

A thick, creamy head whose lacing bear-hugs the pint glass on its way down just adds to the spectacle.  English chocolate, malt, English Chocolate, malt, English Chocolate...you get the picture (to be perfectly honest, I am actually picking up a slight nuttiness that I haven't noticed in the past, although it certainly plays second fiddle to the headliners). There needn't be anything else going on because my glass smells like dessert which is just fine by me.  Chocolate malt is the most obvious flavor on the initial sip although, unlike the nitro-can or on-tap incarnations, I'm not getting much of the actual dark chocolate. Interestingly, I'm getting bitter hop & coffee notes, almost like a mocha porter. And while the bottled version isn't quite as creamy as the aforementioned types (which is akin to saying Donald Rumsfield isn't quite as evil as Dick Cheney), it's ""Luxury"" moniker is still well-earned. Excellent.  Right amount of carbonation coupled with a good, thick body makes this right on target for the genre.

Super chocolatey aroma - dark chocolate, a little milk sweetness, just like cutting blocks of chocolate when baking. There's a hint of roasted malt too, but it's quite subdued compared to the caramel maltiness. The flavour has a lot more malt in it, some caramel, that complements the chocolate. On the bittersweet side more than milk chocolate. Fairly quick finish with a bit of cocoa. On the creamy side, medium bodied with slightly lower than average carbonation. Also a bit dry.

Since my knowledge of beer and brewing, as well as my palate, have been immensely sharpened since then, I felt this was worth revisiting. This poured from its pint sized bottle, nearly black with only a razor thin line of light shining though. The very edges are a dark reddish bronze colour. There was a thick, foamy, khaki coloured head that faded away into a 2 mm blanket of sand coloured frost with thick, wonderful lacing about the edges of the glass. I found very little sweetness in the smell, but rather lots of bitterness, such as bitter baker's chocolate and coffee beans. There were, of course, some malty aromas. Taste was quite sweet and chocolatey. There was, however, a strange characteristic in this that seemed to remind me of scotch. I can't place it, and it certainly wasn't offensive or too powerful, but upon each sip, I thought, ""hmm, scotch"". Strange, eh? I felt the mouthfeel for this was very, very thin and light. Perhaps that will allow for me to consume more of this delicious stout, but quite honestly, stouts of this sort, I like to almost be able to chew. I am very glad I chose to revisit this, and I will most certainly buy it again. The only thing I could find wrong with it, was that I was exceptionally lightweight for the style. *Note: I paired this with Ghirardelli ""Espresso Escape"" premium dark chocolates made with 60% pure cacao and finely ground espresso beans.

There were hints of garnet around the edges where the light made it through. Once the nitro frothing settled down, the beer developed a nice, thick, and very tight head that lasted a good long while.  The smell reminds me of opening a bag of milk chocolate chips. There's that ever so slightly bitter chocolate aroma, a bit of waziness, and an enticing sweetness. There is just flat out no hop presence I can detect anywhere in the nose. Just a slight bit of darker malts, and the above mentioned chocolate.  The taste is also similar to a chocolate bar. It's sweet, yet not overwhelmingly so by any means. It has all the desired characteristics of a good sweet stout, with the added cocoa flavor as a bonus. Any hopiness here is relegated to a bit of bitterness. I detected no hop flavor of any sort. The bitterness seems to come mostly from the malts and chocolate. Surprisingly balanced, given the style and the adjuncts.  The mouthfeel is thickish, but oddly thinner than one may expect. This would probably be better were it a bit more creamy and chewy. It's good as it is, but there's room for improvement here, in my opinion.  Very, very nicely done. A great twist on the style.

A bit of airiness takes away from the richness just a tad.  Overall, it's a wonderful dessert drink. It's nice in a can, especially the appearance.

664,73,Rudgers73,4,"If you want a dark, rich, chocolate drink this is the one.  Poured from a bottle into a tall glass the head is made up of big sticky bubbles. It settles to almost nothing and the first thing you notice is the overwhelming smell of dark chocolate. This is a heavy, sticky, sweet milk stout and is quite similar to Mackeson's XXX.  You wont need dessert if you drink one of these.

664,73,EStreet20,4.18,"14.9 ounce nitro ""draught"" can poured into a 20 ounce nonic pint glass.  A - A cascading nitro pour leads to a nice sized head the color of coffee with cream sitting atop a nearly black stout.  S - Powdered chocolate milk mix or chocolate syrup really leads the way and largely dominates the aroma. Quite nice.  T - A whole lot of chocolate flavor on top of a sweet stout with some dark malt characteristics and a tiny hint of roastiness.  M - A great creamy mouthfeel that is extremely smooth. The carbonation is nearly nill as it all feeds the head.  D - Excellent. The smoothness and cremy mouthfeel make this one go down so smooth despite its extreme sweetness. Great after dinner beer.

Almost black, with the faintist hints of amber on the sides. S: Cocoa powder and mostly sweet malt...not intense for me. T: Delicious roasted malt. Dark chocolate bittersweetness. Not candy-like - it's very rich with a good bitter & sweet balance. Hints of ripe fruit (cherries/raspberries). M: Fuller mouthfeel...this beer seems to coat every surface in my mouth and cling to it. Extremely creamy. Fairly light in body. D: Delicious with dessert or by itself.

664,73,nesta,4.12,"This is among my favorite beers. Very rich, dark color, with a positively delightful cocoa aroma. The beer is smooth, almost velvety, and rich with chocolate, cocoa, and hints of coffee with cream. An important high point in this brew is that its very rich without being overly sweet, making it a bit more drinkable than many other rich beers. Still, it is very rich and very filling....I couldn't see myself enjoying more than two of these before switching to something else, which is the only reason I rated the drinkability below the 4.0 mark. This is simply an exceptional beer, and one of the brews I most frequently recommend to people who claim to not like beer (when they've only really tried bud light and miller) or to not like dark beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Neehan,4.37,"First thing first... this beer is excellent.  A very dense, dark pour with a very thick (3 finger) tan head that shrinks a little but does not disappear. You will notice a wonderful, sweet smell of malty chocolate and coffee. The same sweet chocolate and coffee are tasted, but they are perfectly balanced by bitterness to avoid making this overly sweet. The aftertase is of more chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with light carbonation and goes down very smoothly. This is a very drinkable beer, and one of the most drinkable stouts that I have tasted.

Some light bitterness comes through in the finish, but the aftertaste is dominated once again by creamy chocolate.  M - Medium body with a palate-cleaning carbonation.

It poured very dark with a nice tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate almost jumping out of the glass. Very agreeable. Just enough carbonation to fizzle in your mouth. Plenty of chocolate there too!!

664,73,Generik420,4.82,"Tried this for the first time this weekend. I usually am not in the mood for a stout style beer, and was really buying this for the bottle. I am a homebrewer and had 11 Young's bottles and wanted a half case for bottling my brews with. This was all they had from Young's so a little reluctantly I bought it.  I have to say, I was amazed at how good this beer was. First thing I noticed was the chocolate flavor. It is very pronounced and I found it very enjoyable. This beer goes down very smooth and didn't have a very harsh roasty bite that many other stouts have. Each sip begged for the next one to follow soon after. After a sip, I felt like I still had a chocolatey residue coating the inside of my mouth that faded away slowly. The hop flavors were fairly absent, although I can't imagine wanting the chocolate flavors to compete with hops, so in my mind it was balanced the way it should be.  After drinking this lone bottle, I longed for another. This beer will definitly find its way into my normal beer rotation.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DogFood11,2.93,"Black body below a brown head that leaves traces of lace. Carbonation is subtle but enough to give the palate a sting  Chocolate of course, is the prominent theme here. Not the bakers variety. This is more like a rich dark chocolate that oils down the palate and really makes it difficult to pick up anything else. Its that strong! of a taste. It is a good beer, don't get me wrong, I just think its rather boring to be honest. A melted chocolate bar without any balancer.  Hersheys chocolate to the point. Squeeze some hershey's on a batch of vanilla Ice Cream and you have Young's double chocolate.

The smell is a lovely malty sweet followed by a ton of chocolate when you first take a swig. The beer does not disappoint even as you get toward the bottom. I really enjoy this in the colder months since it is quite rich and heavy, its a bit too much in summer, and it only makes you think you are putting on 20 pounds per glass.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,gmfessen,4.2,"Poured this beer out into a pint glass, beer was a very dark chocolate brown color, with a very nice head on top. The head stuck around for several minutes, eventually leaving a small creamy froth on top. The smell was definitely of chocolate malt. Sweet and pleasant like a candy bar. The taste was also nice, although not as strong as I had expected. The mouthfeel is very creamy; the beer has a healthy body and a smooth finish. Overall, this beer is definitely drinkable and I would recommend it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Lots of chocolate and buttery hints in the aroma. Some malt scents and a tart aroma are also present. Inviting but forgettable.  Tastes of chocolate, coffee, butter, sweet and roasted malts are balanced by a bitter, tart hoppy presence. The aftertaste is slightly too tart in my opinion and perhaps slightly metallic.  The mouthfeel is excellent, as this drinks like a draft beer. Nice, thick, full-bodied and creamy.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Looks kind of like ice cream The body of the beer is black with some ruby highlights. The only thing keeping me from giving this a five is the fact that it really dosn't look like beer, more like a milkshake or something.  S: Smells good, very chocolatey, but dosn't really smell like a beer. Smells more like Nesquick. There is a hint of alcohol to the nose.  T: I was glad that it didn't taste as chocolatey as it smelled. I was actually especting this to be stronger than it was. Slighty bitter with a sweet roasted malts and chocolate dominating. Has a bitter coffee like aftertaste. Chocolate tastes pretty artificial. Reminds me of Guinness mixed with Nesquick.  M: Completly flat and kind of watery. This is killing it for me.  D: Watching the head form on this is definiatly it's strongest point . Taste-wise it was a decent stout, but I really can't stand how flat and watery it was.

664,73,Gueuzedude,3.38,"Best by date February 2007, Sampled August 2006 Pours with a creamy, almost mousse like, light brown head that I am able to contain to three-fingers thick. The beer is opaque and not quite devoid of color; there is a touch of brown to round out the deep blackness. The aroma smells like sweet chocolate liquor in some ways. It is not as sweet as an actual chocolate liquor and there is only a hint of alcohol, but the chocolate note is definitely there. A touch of burnt grain character is here as well as some spicy beer like notes that I can't quite put words to.  The taste is fairly light, and could in fact use a bit more creamy, mouth coating heft to it. Lightly sweet, with a chocolate note up front that quickly moves to a light-roast black coffee note. Some lightly spicy bitterness is here, but most of the bitterness seems to be contributed from roasted malt. The finish has a burnt grain acidity to it as well as a lightly burnt bitterness. Chocolate flavors are definitely noticeable and even linger long into the finish, but seem to not be at the depth that my memory of this beer remembers.

Nose is of chocolate, sort of half dark and half cocoa powder like Nesquik. Theres some malt there as well. Taste is a lot more mellow than I expected, milk chocolate flavor with mild coffee. Mild malt dominates. Overall the flavor is mild and not bitter. Finishes on a nice slightly bitter coffee finish. Mouth is very good: fully, creamy, and fluid. Drinkability is very good.

664,73,gueuzeonhigh,4.03,"I was skeptical of this beers double-ness seeing the cans ""Double"" moniker plus packed in a nitro-can made it all the more intriguing what this beer acutally is like.  Poured a bible black opaque with a tan tight celled sculptured head.  Sadly the head was short lived and sank back to the depths with a diminutive ring hugging the interior circumference of my glass.  Nose was slight, nondescript.  Flavorat first an explosion of chocolate coffee flavor intertwined with hops and toasted malt. Yet, just as with the head the flavor dissipated as fast as its flavor debut took the stage.  The flavor profile is thin with a fast curt finish. It left me wishing there was more underpinning. This would have made the beer far more appealing as there seemed like lots of possible flavor avenues the wonderful coffee-chocolate start could travel through..  Nevertheless the flavor start made the beer an enjoyable treatsort of beckoned me to take another sip.  Mouthfeel produced a comfortable cleansing experiencea smooth but thin libation.  Drinkability was most congenialI could quaff the entire four pack in one sitting.  Still, I believe this beers most prominent fault is its thin flavor body.  Im not certain what benefits the nitro packaging produces on this beer. The nitro packaging seems to effect the same results as with the other similarly packaged beers Ive experienced.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Avagadro,4.17,"Drinking this out of an imperial pint glass. A nice chocolate-milkshake colored head formed with the pour and fell to a thin film on top of the brew. Color is that of the darkest chocolate bar and opaque when held to the light. The aroma is well presented, and dominated by the sweet unfermented sugars left in the brew. Chocolate is very present as the name suggests, but there is a creaminess and roastiness also present. The taste is very fit to the style, sweet. Nice and creamy, possibly due to lactose used in fermentation. Flavor is dominated by the creamy flavor, followed by a hit of chocolate malt, and comes together beautifully with a bit of roasted malty bitterness. mouthfeel is thick, almost like whole milk, leaving a film inside your mouth. Drinkability is mixed for me. I would definitely buy this beer again, but it is not a session beer. I don't think I could drink more than a pint of these in one sitting, but this is not a bad thing. I definitely suggest giving this beer a try. If you've had it and want another beer like it, try Bell's Special Double Cream Stout.

It tastes simply great. I do get a slightly bitter finish with a wonderfully chocolate aftertaste.  Mouthfeel  The body is pretty good. Thick and velvety.

It is like biting into one of those dark chocolate bars that is 80% (or more) pure dark cocoa. Makes sense, since that's what this beer is made from!

The chocolate aroma was quite intense, yet it smelled more like sweet milk chocolate than the actual dark chocolate that is used in the brewing process.  The beer tasted quite chocolatey.

The emphasis was on chocolate and the beer emulated that emphasis to a tee. Some roasty expresso was present in the smooth flavor, but mostly it was chocolate.

664,73,JayTheFinn,4,"Fours across the board on Young's Double Chocolate Stout for me. It's just a good solid sweet stout. Nothing more, nothing less.  Dark in the glass with a decent tan head. Good chocolate scents. Fairly full body. Nice and creamy with the right amount of carbonation for my tongue. Quite drinkable.  It seems like you can get it just about anywhere, but I had this one at the Mercury Lounge, a beerbar in Goleta, California.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Gattopardo,3.96,"Admittedly, a can is probably not the best means of delivery for this beer, which I initially tried from a tap, yet the experience was not significantly diminished. I found a four-pack of Young's at Trader Joe's in 14.9 oz cans, each stamped at the bottom with a freshness date of February, 2007. In short, I have great affection for this beer. The pour is exceptionally creamy with a brown mocha color. After it sat a bit the thin rich head separated from the dense black below. Strong scent of porter and chocolate. The chocolate taste is very present, followed by a pleasant stout bitterness that effectively leaves the mouth feeling somehow cleansed and ready for another sip, althouth the former did seem to diminish as the beer cooled. The creamy, silky mouthfeel and the flavor makes it perfect to drink with a chocolate dessert. In all, a unique experience in beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,weeare138,3.65,"Appears a dark black with a cascading, fluffy, light tan head that settles into a 1 finger cap. Solid streaks are left around the glass. Smell is of light caramel and chocolate malt...maybe a hint of dehusked carafa in there. Taste is similar to the smell with the mild caramel and dusty cocoa coming through and playing lightly along the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-full bodied with a grainy feel on the tongue. Mildly sweet start and light bitter ending make this one an ok selection but not groundbreaking by any means. I've been wowed by this on draft a few years back...either my memory is going or this nitro-can doesn't hold a candle to the brew on tap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Sosh,3.58,"Appearance - Black, with a tan head. When I held it close to light, some dark reddish brown was seen.  Smell - Beer and chocolate, but nothing REALLY stuck out.  Taste - Coffee was the biggest factor, the chocolate was merely an aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - A bit bubbly. It really felt like Bud Light (or something of that nature) as far as the carbonation went.  Drinkability - Smooth going down, but I did feel a little full.  I guess I'm glad I got this, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. Overpriced, I think.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,cjgator3,4.12,Pours pitch black with a 1 1/2 finger mocha colored head. Smell is of sweet chocolate and dark malts. Mouthfeel would be better if it had a bit less carbonation but overall pretty good. Taste is dark roasted malts with a small touch of chocolate. Chocolate is not as prevalant in the taste as it is in the smell. Overall a good stout even though I was let down a bit by the lack of chocolate in the taste.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Metalmonk,3.91,"Boy does this one look fantastic. Ebony color with a head sitting on top that's the creamiest cap I've ever seen on a beer. Hardly looks like bubbles, more a nougat-like fluffiness, total cream, and just as velvety when it moves over the lips. The head stays on top throughout the entire drink.  Smells of chocolate and roasted malts, sweet but pretty laid back.  Tastes of frothy chocolate milk and toasty malts, which deepens with a finish of mild hops bittering. I know it's proper for the style and region, but I don't like the flat mouthfeel, it lets down the flavor characteristics. Still haven't acquired a liking for the kind of flatness many English beers have.  A nice dessert-y stout that actually isn't too heavy to session or enjoy with a meal.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MagicLantern,4.23,"Poured into a Pint Glass.  A: Super thick head prevented me from pouring this into a pint glass on one try. Almond head and easy 4"" thick. This is no joke. Very slow recession. Great retention. Lace clings heavily to glass and evenly caps beer and just doesn't want to fade. Big bubbles in lace suggest heavy carbonation, but no visible carbonation in beer because it's simply to black.  Black beer with slightest red translucence when held up to light.  S: Milk! Creamy milk with slight hops and spice. Wow I loved the smell of this beer, it was like a real desert.  T: Everything suggested by the smell came true when tasteing it. Smooth milk chocolate malt with a slight spicy bitter end. Clear and distinct taste of almonds. Low carbonation, slight spice. A very dry finish.  This is a desert, a fantastic chocolate desert. Finish a mean with this beer.  M: Smoothe creamy, balanced. Slightly watery. Big flavor, but not heavy. Almond over chocolate finishes beer and coats mouth with a pleasant residue.  D: Very pleasant chocolate. A very situational beer. I gave it high drinkability because in that situation, be it after dinner or as a snack, this is fantastic. At the end of the meal how many do you want to put a way? It's a desert, it's a great desert. But you can't have chocolate all of the time. I dunno, maybe you can. I suggest complimenting this beer with cookies or cake.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,benwiley,3.76,"i have to rate this NITRO CAN version of this amazing stout as substantially lower than the bottled version. this nitro can just did not deliver the amazing pure chocolate decadence that the bottle so fully conveys. i dont know. i just know that the bottle is an absolute let down compared to the bottle. now, i am FULLY AWARE that the nitro can produces a better head. absolutely true - the head on this can's pour lasted pretty much the entire glass full and tastes terrific. but, all in all, the bottle version has a MUCH BETTER flavor through and through. i mean it. start with the bottled one. have one and realize the greatness. if you the have a nitro can you will see the difference clearly. the can pretty much delivers a DULLER version of the same great beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jasonjlewis,4.9,"This beer retained a slight amount of foam head at the top for quite some time and it is incredibly complex and choclatey and stout and bitter and sweet and awesome.

664,73,CarolinaCardinals,3.81,Had a pint of this at the Young's restauarant on the Thames River.  Beer poured black as night with a great tan head leaving generous lacing. Nose was of sweet chocolate malts. Taste was malty with a very sweet finish. Mouthfeel was smooth but kind of thin for the style. Drinkability was sessionable at 5.2 abv. An enjoyable beer that one has to try.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,acrawf6,3.99,"Pours out a deep dark amber, pretty much black- small light getting through the sides. Nice tan head rises with good lacing.  Smell. I small hoppiness, bit metalic. Has a dark euro lager aroma that i am not liking. It is slightly sweet, but not chocolatey like the nitro can is.  Taste. Nice. Good roasted malt taste, a sweet powdery milk chocolate taste. But it still maintains a decent amount of hoppiness. Aftertaste is heavy of coffee tastes (creamed coffee).  Mouthfeel is good. Nice and creamy. Not a very full body, but thick enough. Very nice balance.  Overall. I was hoping this would be one of those, ""oh my god, i love this beer!"" beer, but it's not. However it is still a very enjoyable beer. I like it in the bottle rather than in the nitrocan",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,soulgrowl,4.15,"Appearance: Opaque coffee brown with a sparkling, quivering, coffee-stained head that retains very well. Luxury, thy name is Young's.  Smell: Rich chocolate syrup, milk, candy sugar, caramel, and deep, dark raisin and fig tones. Slight mocha and hazelnut characters.  Taste: Mild dark chocolate, toasted almonds and light marzipan in the beginning. Delicious dried fig character. Vague but noticeable spicy hops. Dry, carbonized finish. Almonds make a triumphant return in the aftertaste. Long-lasting cocoa flavor really sticks around. Overall, pleasant and well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body and somewhat powdery on the tongue.  Drinkability: This is a really flavorful but not aggressive brew, sweet but not sugary, and light enough to work into the middle of a session. Pair with brownies!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,brentk56,4.16,"Appearance: Pours a black color with a creamy tan head; tiny bubbles galore, great retention and good lacing  Smell: Smells like...chocolate milk  Taste: Starts out with a sweet milk chocolate flavor; after the swallow some modest bitter elements kick in, providing a slightly balancing effect  Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy; very low carbonation  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, although the flavor is not as interesting as the bottled version",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Globetrotter,4.6,"Found, to my great delight, in a Moscow supermarket. The brown half-liter bottle is broad in the shoulders and features a brown and gold label featuring two rams going head-to-head at the top, with another full face etching of a ram behind the words. Chocolate is an ingredient. Best before 8/22/06, I couldn't wait more than about six hours to open it on 5/7/06.  Pours a rich, very dark but clear burgundy under a one finger dark tan head that settles fairly quickly to thick film, then lingers forever. Not much in the lace department, though. The nose is strong of rich milk chocolate, with a touch of coffee behind. The mouth is thick and luxurious, with moderate carbonation. The taste is sublime: the chocolate is readily noticeable right up front, but is nicely balanced by espresso and a touch of caramel. I had expected more roastiness, but I'll settle for bathing in the sweet and the bitter that make this brew so enjoyable. The chocolate wins out in the aftertaste, although even here there is enough of the coffee to keep you thirsty. Very nicely balanced, wonderfully tasty brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Drew966,4.53,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout pours almost jet black with a tan head from a 14.9 ounce nitro can. I've had the bottled version before, but this is my first try of the nitro version. It smells good, particularly for a nitro beer. Chocolate malt is apparent in the nose. Taste is interesting in that it is different than the bottle in my opinion, chocolate and coffee notes still dominate, but yet this seems like a different beast than the bottle. Mouthfeel is typically nitro smooth. Highly recommended. I'd like to try the bottle and the nitro can back to back.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Folderol,3.27,"Beautiful nitro thick creamy tan head over a black body. Has a lovely way of settling to a creamy solid chunk that won't spill out of the glass if you tilt it. Smell is generic mild hop and roasted malt. First sip is almost all head. Similar to Guinness cans in that respect. Actual beer isn't that impressive - seems a bit flat, even compared to Guinness nitro. Flavors are all very subdued. The chocolate is very subtle in the aftertaste, hop bitterness is pretty low, and there's not a lot of malt flavor. Watery consistency overall due to the lack of bitterness, dryness or sweetness. I'd call this an interesting alternative to Guinness if you can find the cans, but not a very interesting beer. I imagine the bottled version has much better in the aroma & mouthfeel and possibly flavor as well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,ChrisA,4.3,"Those nitro cans are just great. The perfect creamy head topped this beautiful stout. A nice strong chocolate scent on the nose. The roasted malt is very evident. Coffee, chocolate, and a hint of alcohol on the palate. Clean finish with a touch of hopiness. Very drinkable. I was a bit worried that this would be too rich for the middle of the day. However, I could easily down a couple of these at any time. It's good to branch out and try something other than Guiness, Murphy's or Beamish.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,shererjt,3.9,"Poured a deep ruby red to black color with a creamy, light brown, long-lasting head. Smell was rich, roasty malt with some chocolate in there as well. Probably a miracle that there's any chocolate detectable under all that roastiness! (Guess that's why it's ""double"" chocolate.) Up-front chocolate in the flavor, and it's not particularly subtle. Otherwise, medium in body and punctuated by a nice roasty flavor and some lingering bitterness as well. Fruitiess was moderate, and had a nice, creamy mouthfeel. The drinkability was also very good, though even if you are a stout lover you probably wouldn't want to drink pint after pint of it. Does leave you wanting more, though, and not overly heavy.  Quite a good beer and solid all the way around. A favorite beer from one of my favorite breweries.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,scottoale,3.85,"Pours a very, very dark mahogany brown from the funky shaped, 500ml. brown glass bottle. Light brown head of two-fingers sticks around for a while with very little lacing.  Very sweet nose of black patent malt and chocolate with some bitter coffee in the background...smells rather dessert like, almost like Kahlua.  Tastes of sweet chocolate and fruity, plum and raisins then tapers to a bitter coffee finish. Good balance of malt and hops with a nice chocolate aftertaste.  Pretty big in body, smooth mouthfeel with the alcohol burried by the rich flavor of this tasty brew. While being easy to drink, I'd recommend this as an after dinner dessert beer, as in one or two would be fine.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,crookedhalo,3.88,"Pours up a rich, dark brown with some cola-colored highlights around the edge of the glass. Creamy chocolate-skim-milk-colored nitrogenated head. Some black patent malt showing through the chocolate and carob aroma. No real discernable hop aroma, but an immediate hop detection, notably Target, upon first sip. It starts of with a light bitterness (similar to how Guinness finishes) and then a mid-palate transition to a mild lactose sweetness with roasted malt and chocolate, and back to a light astringency in the finish. A nice milk stout. You know this beer is good if it can get my homeboy Lee laid.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,zeff80,3.95,"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle. A deep dark color with a thick tawny head. You can definately smell the chocolate in the beer.

It was a little dry in the mouth and rated fairly well in the drinkability category.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,plaid75,3.06,"Poured a rich black hue with a creamy off white two finger head. The stout featured good head retention and thick lacing. An overall nice and tempting appearance.  The smell consisted of a slight chocolate aroma with hints of caramel and a unpleasant metallic smell.  The taste was average and muted. The flavor did not jump out of the glass like in the case of an imperial stout. However, it was pleasant and suprisingly dry.  Mouthfeel, however, was a bit thick without the pleasure of a thick, rich taste. It coated the mouth with a dull sensation which lessened the desire for the next sip.  The poor mouthfeel and dull taste detracted from the beer's drinkability.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,clabaugh,4.06,"Appearance: Poured a syrupy, black liquid out of a majestic looking 16.9oz bottle. Topped with a pillowy head colored a faint tan. Definitely does not skimp on the head, as it presents a full three fingers. Lacing is thick and abundant.  Smell: Thoroughly malty, and loaded with chocolate aromas. Very similar to chocolate syrup.  Taste: Decadent chocolate, and toasty malts. A subtle hop presence supplying a refreshing bitterness. A sort of milkiness, and a certain sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light-bodied. Very smooth and creamy with an ever so slight tingling.  Drinkability: Fine flavor, goes down easy, but not quite as complex as I would have liked. A greater diversity of flavor would have me running back for more.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,pweis909,3.52,"Looks like your basic stout. Dark. Tawny head. A bit lighter than some I suppose.  Smell the chocolate? A little. Not as chocolatey as I expected for something billed as ""Double"" chocolate (chocolate malt, and, apparently, real chocolate).  Taste the chocolate? Yeah, a little. But it seems like I've had other brews that give more chocolate vibes (most recently, Summit Porter).  Feel the chocolate? Well, it's a nice smooth creamy feel.  Do I want to drink a lot of these?

The aroma was incredible and I was fully expecting a thick, creamy chocolate beer...Maybe it was just my usual expectation for something that's chocolate, but there is a definite bitterness to the beer that turned me off. I cringed a bit every swallow, and to me, that's not what I'm looking for in a beer. I think if Young's made this beer a bit milder, it would become an excellent beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tozerm,4.41,"The bottled Young's is ok. The nitro-can is better. But if you try this beer on the proper nitro-tap setup at the right temperature...wow. Much like the mainline dry Irish stouts it has a tremendous ""floor show"" in the glass. Cascading creaminess. It had a extremely rich and thick head that added that finishing touch to the beer. The beer itself looked almost like blackstrap molasses in color. Wonderful undertones of chocolate malt. I got a hint of coffee on the nose. This beer goes down like a chocolate malt. Yummy for my tummy.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Tupperwolf,4.42,"Poured into my Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip from the bottle; I've been shying away from Young's ever since my first try of their Oatmeal Stout, which I didn't like at all. I've wanted to buy the Double Chocolate, but only recently stumbled across it in bottles instead of cans.  It's damn dark, and capped with a minimalistic head that leaves behind tiny spots of lacing; Poor retention, but an appealing shade of black.  The smell is warm with rich, decadent coffee and chocolate tones, a sweet dark brown kind of smell; There are slight hints of rummy alcohol, but the bittersweet caress of chocolate takes center stage.  Warming to the proper temperature allows all of this beer's strong, rounded flavors to burst forth. Definitely, definitely a chocolate flavored beer. But don't be scared! It's a chocolatey BEER, and there's definitely beer in the flavor, too! Rich, slightly roasty malts, bittering, slightly acidic hops, dark coffee and smooth cocoa.  Minimal carbonation save a bit of zip, a very slight tartness from the alcohol, but very smooth, very cool-feeling in the mouth even at an appropriate temp - it tempts me to drink deeply. It can be appreciated just as easily in deep gulps as in lazy sips.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

S: Cocoa and bittersweet chocolate with some alcohol notes.  T/M: The taste is almost the same as the smell but some kinda wierd milk/lactic acid twang in the finish.  D: Very smooth and should appeal to those who might be afraid of stouts.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Phatz,4.51,"Pours black with a very creamy light chocolate brown head. Great retention and fantastic lacing. This a beauty!  Smell: From the moment I cracked the cap there is a fantastic dark chocolate aroma. I could appreciate a bit more aromatics but it is very good.  Taste: This is truly one of the most 'chocolaty' chocolate beers I have EVER had! Truly a work of art! It is not cloying in any way. It is remarkable easy. Roasted malts and hints of caramel and toasted butterscotch accompany the chocolate. Just a very subtle hop character keep the beer balanced.  Mouthfeel: Soo smooth and so creamy! It it thick and a bit chewy! A real treat.  Drinkability: This beer is so tasty ever single sip BEGS for more! I have had cases of Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Even before BA I split a case of this beer with another BA friend of mine. At that time it was the best beer I had ever had. I must admit, I am now even more aware of just how amazing this beer really is. I highly recommend it!!!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jongillin,4.25,"Right, I am reviewing here, my favorite style. So admittedly I might be a bit biased. I am also generally a huge fan of Young's stouts anyway.  This one came from the can, which of course is not always as good as on tap. However, it has a great appearance. It has a nice dark color (as any stout should). And amazingly enough (sarcasm added) it has some what of a chocolate like color to it.  The smell: You can definitely pick up some milk scents and the usual stout malty scent. However, (again: surprise!) you do get a hint of Chocolate in there. The presence of Golding hops are also noticeable.  Taste: Fantastic. Not too much more to say about that. You pick up all the flavors. The hop flavors are nicely balanced and their bitterness is countered well with the chocolate. It has a slightly more dark chocolate taste than a milk chocolate. But, that should not be a surprise considering that Dark chocolate is more bitter.  Mouthfeel is really smooth. It is thick but also well rounded. Full bodied leaving nothing to be desired.  Very drinkable goes down easy and is very tasty.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Almost cloying, lately it's been fading to a heavy metallic taste. Never noticed it before, maybe it's the aluminum can.  M - Can't beat nitro for thickness. If that's what you like.

Sweet and chocolate malt presents are strong. With a faint hint of coffee.  Chocolate upfront in the taste, followed by an acute burnt coffee aftertaste. Wasn't as great as I expected though.  I was a little dissapointed in the mouthfeel also. Thin and watery, and a bit too over-carbonated.  Meh, not really what I had expected.

I am generally not impressed with how non-bottle-conditioned british products arrive across the pond, but this beer has high ratings and I am happy to try a stout with promise - check my reviews before this product.. My bias is thus divulged.  Nose is with notes of chocolate and a sour bitterness typical of across-the-pond beers. On this alone the beer is in trouble - sourness seems to work on british products in bottle but is not a native part of taste.  Taste is sweet with some hop sourness culminating in a roasted sweet finish. I am not impressed with this beer and am not sure why it is so highly rated. aftertaste covers some bases with roasted sweet chocolate notes but the beer unfortunately meets my expectations for what happens to a british product over a few months in the bottles without any yeast to help it along.l  Being honest, I poured it out. There are more interesting things here to taste than a sour stout which is no inspiration.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

T: Subdued flavors of dark chocolate and espresso with a mild saltiness on the sides of the tongue. Mild wine-like tannins in the finish. The flavor is very good, I just don't think that there is enough of it.  M: Lightly carbonated and with a medium body, the label advertises correctly: ""Silky smooth"" ""Rich and creamy""  D: This is a good beer, but probably not one that I would make an effort to find.

It was full of a sweet chocolate aroma with the hint of bananas in there as well, very interesting. A very chocolaty taste that gives way to bitter malt after a little while in your mouth. After you swallow this bitterness is much more pronounced but not overbearing. This is a very smooth drink that would compliment a good chocolate desert after a hearty meal, or perhaps it could be the desert. I'll be looking to try this one again on tap.

664,73,rmp5s,4.41,"First tried this beer on tap. The nitro-tap does wonders for this beer. Gives it a wonderful tan head and an amazing cascade for a good 30 seconds. This is honestly the only beer I LIKE to drink BEFORE the head goes down any. Usually I'll wait for the head to go down some/all the way before drinking it...this beer...that's one of the best parts. Wonderful mouth feel, wonderful flavor with just a hint of chocolate...definately not overkill, one of my favorite beers.  Found the beer in a big specialty liquor story by my house in bottles a while back. I was really happy but I wondered if it would be the same out of a bottle. It wasn't. It was good, but it didn't have that wonderful head on it. I was sad. Not to mention the one bottle was...like...3 bucks or something like that.  THEN...I found cans of it just a week ago. I IMMEDIATELY grabbed them and gave the cans a light shake...I know cans sometimes get nitrogen infusers in them and this is what I was listening for...I was greeted by the marble-in-a-spraypaint-can sound I was looking for. 4 22oz cans (I think...maybe 20 oz...) was almost 9 bucks. Stuff's not cheap but it's so worth it. Pop the can, let it sit for a second, pour into your fav beer glass and enjoy. Just like out of the tap...just costs half as much.

664,73,UberWasser,4.58,"Pint from tap at Old Chicago in Tucson.  Pours a deep black color with a very thick tan head that stays a few mm thick from the first sip to the last.  The smell is subtle but has some nice notes of coffee, mainly, plus a bit of a chocolate undertone. One first sniff one must wonder where the double is in this stout.  Taste...oh, there it is! Your tongue is enveloped in a fantastic velvet mouthfeel as pronounced flavors of chocolate flow over it. It is a bit of a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate flavors. Following that comes a subtle coffee-like bitterness that gives just enough balance to the chocolate tastes. This beer is so tasty and well balanced that I think I could start with a pint of this with my cereal in the morning and drink another and another, slowly, as the day rolled on by. I would be hard pressed to get tired of it.  Bottom line...I really enjoyed this beer. It would make a great desert on its own but begs to accompany some fresh berries.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,rousee,4.23,This beer never fails to impress. Its a lot better on draught than nitro-can but still when you get right down to tasting it---absolutely fabulous.  Pour is black and has some cascading effect from the nitro-thingey. It lvs some bubbles on top that would be considered a negative at a bar until you get right down into this.  Smell is dark mallt and bananna. There is some very pronounced chocolate but its supposed to be there too. Some metallic elements to the aroma which is causing a slight downgrade.  Taste is a lovely smooth blend of fine aromatic dark chocolate with some milky elements too as it should be for this style. A real fine example of the milk/sweet stout. It holds up well for a longtime too. Mouthfeel is quite pleasant. A fine beer---definitely recommended.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ccs,4.95,"Yes, on nitro-tap. Fred's Rivertown Alehouse--I bow to you!  First, it took about 20 minutes to get the beer once they poured it...it was so thick. Appearance: Nearly black with a gorgeous, thick tan head on it that extended beyond the top of the glass. Smell: It hits you in the face--CHOCOLATE! To be honest, it was a reminiscent of a thickshake. Taste: chocolate, sweet, rich barley. Amazing. Mouthfeel: Silk, it was so pleasant compared to what I was expecting. You see such a head and appearance, you expect it to be heavy, but it was like drinking velvet.

The huge tan head leaves lots of lacing as it slowly settles.  Smell (when properly warmed) is slightly metallic, with a hint of chlorine (yuk) along with roasted malts. It's a very sharp smell for a stout. Sweet cocoa and some yeast round it off.  If you like cocoa, you should love this one. Bittersweet chocolate malts stand out in the flavor, along with coffee and cream. Not overly complex, but what it does it does very well.  The mouthfeel is rich and tingly all over the tongue. It's got a nice roasted malt and chocolate aftertaste, and not at all sour as some stouts turn out. This is a rich, filling and creamy brew. Second to Rogue's Chocolate Stout this is the best I've had, but being as Young's is cheaper, I may just be drinking more of this....",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Jacobier10,3.59,"Opaque black color with a small, fizzy tan head with good retention. Maybe it was just the bottle I got, but I could barely pick up an aroma off this beer. Very faint roasted malts. After being unsatisfied with the aroma, the taste came and saved the day, bringing the malts to the foreground. The flavor of chocolate and roasted barley malts coat the inside of your mouth and it all ends with a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Drinkable for a stout, but not my favorite so far. I would like to try it out of a nitro can, however, as I can see it's potential for being a different beast out of the can.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Greenfloyd,4.35,"There are certain beers that can follow up a hearty meat & potatoes meal like a rich slice of chocolate cake...this is one of those beers, and it does it's job well. Let's not get the wrong idea, we are not looking at a quasi-mocha, overly sweet latte replacement, but an easy to drink, versatile stout.  Upon the initial pour, you'll find a lightly tan, slightly foamy head (as opposed to the creamy texture of a pub's pour when you order a pint of the black stuff), resting on a black coffee base. It's a stout, and it looks like one, simple as that. The nose, if you will (and I will) actually does have a hint of sweet chocolate, laced with the aggressive use of Goldings and Fuggle hops. The taste is rich, yet the body is not overly thick, some better stouts of course, being a meal unto themselves, this one not to overbearing after a feast. Again, the hops presence shines through when drinking, but the bitterness commonly associated with a stout, seems to be generated more by a dark chocolate than anything else. Apparently the style isn't just a catchy name. The beer finishes just like it started, mildly hoppy and expressive.  If dark is your pleasure, than pleasured you will be. Unfortunately, as in most imports (especially from the UK), the bottle drank in the US, as opposed to one poured in downtown London, loses something in the translation, but is still well worth the price of admission...enjoy.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Great as session brew or with a bowl of spicy food or some dark choclate, highly recomended",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bighoppymonster,4.33,"Pours a deep dark opaque black with a very luxurious looking thick, creamy tan head. Roasted maltiness in aroma with strong hints of chocolate as well. Tastes the same, except this time the roastiness takes a back seat to the chocolaty flavours. Extremely smooth and creamy. Drinkable? Thats quite an understatement. I can't get enough of this stuff and I've already had four cans. Good thing I bought two 4-pint can packs. Damned tasty brew!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kmcnair,3.59,"Thanks to the nitro widget, this pours into my glass a velvety milk chocolate brown of cascading bubbles, after a few moments of settling, this becomes an opaque black with a very thick creamy light tan head. Some subtle toasty chocolate notes are present in the aroma, but not much else, no hops to speak of. Sweet milk chocolate flavor, mocha latte, smooth bittering with no hop flavors, sweet finish. Nice creamy mouthfeel, very smooth nitro-carbonation, medium bodied and leaves a light coat on the palate. I remember days where I would be excited to find this on tap at a local pub, its definitely lost the excitement factor as my palate has matured, however this is a nice throwback to the guinness days.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,goochpunch,3.61,"Poured pitch black with a healthy, khaki-colored head. Smells of black malt and dark chocolate. Nothing too exciting. I'm not going to wax poetic about this beer: tastes like a tasty milk stout with chocolate added. with a finish of some noble hops Good enough for me. Mouthfeel is fairly silky, but with a combination so decadent as beer and chocolate, I hoped for a richer, chewier beer. One of these is good for a nightcap, but it's a bit filling to reach for another.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,RoBotGod,3.74,"Excellent beer for the style. Huge dark, tan head on this one. Very heavy lace that followed. Only thing that really threw me off on this was the nose. Usually I get a ton of chocolate aroma, but on this one I didnt really pull anything. The chocolate flavor is good and well balanced. I get more of a dark chocolate flavor, rather than the normal light brown.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,doppelmeup,4.18,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Beautiful three inch tall foamy head, light tan. Thick lacing on the glass as I drink it. I love watching the bubbles come up through the beer. Very dark, with hints of garnet coloring.  Smelled of cocoa, similar to a chocolate truffle. Slight notes of coffee.  As the name suggests, very chocolatey flavor. Again, like eating a dark chocolate truffle, only drinking it instead. Slightly bittersweet, very rich. My bottle is a little bit on the warm side, and I think it would be better if it were slightly colder. (Since it's a larger bottle,I'll chill the remainder and have it later.)  Very light carbonation. Thick, reminds me of a very thin chocolate milkshake. Nice finish, leaving the palate with hints of chocolate, as if you had had a dark chocolate Dove chocolate square.  I liked this a lot, but I don't think I could drink a lot of these in a row. It would be an excellent choice with dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rezzin,4.13,"A - Pours a rich dark brown, almost black. Tan head.  S - Sweet chocolate, coffee, and even a little toasy/roasty? None if any aroma from the hops that I can tell.  T - Chocolate is definitely there. The taste is very well balanced from what I can tell. I'm not much of a stout drinker but this one makes me want to come back for more. Roasty/toasty sweetness with just enough chocolate without going overboard. Pretty good.  M - Smoothness that just covers every part of my tongue. Full bodied without being chewy or overly heavy. Little carbonation.  D - I decided to try this one after having Young's Oatmeal Stout. As mentioned earlier I'm not a big fan of stouts but after these two, I'm starting to have a change of heart. I guess I can thank Young & Co's Brewery for the eye opener! I would definitely buy this again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,hopsaplenty,4.07,"16.9 oz. bottle. Best before October 06  Pours with a huge dimpled espresso colored head of small bubbles that are crackling loudly. The head slowly settles leaving long sheets of thick lacing. The color is a deep, dark black with some cordovan hues at the margins. Impenetrable. Rich cocoa powder and bitter chocolate dominate the smell along with some coffee and roasted notes as well. The flavor is dry cocoa powder and bitter chocolate, along with a modest maltiness underneath, but this is restrained. It is all about the chocolate flavors. It is not sweet, but rather a bit drying. Medium bodied with a light, prickly feeling on the tongue. This was enjoyable on its own.  Just for kicks I poured some over vanilla ice cream and the flavors complimented each other nicely.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,PBRstreetgang,4.42,"Pours opaque black, with ruby highlights. The magic of nitrogeneration creates a super creamy, pale tan head that holds a half inch to the finish; lacing will coat the glass. Malto dextrin, roasted barely, and chocolate malt are strong in the nose, with a faint molasses aromas in the background. Sweet dextrin and a huge roasted flavor upfront, followed by a soft wave of unsweetened bakers chocolate. The aftertaste is a touch dry, with some creamy dextrins holding on, but lots of roasted bitterness that creates a good balance without any need for hops. The carbonation is flat, the body like whole milk, and the mouthfeel is very...very creamy. Some residual chocolate and dextrin sweetness is matched by roasted notes in the finish, but the drinkability still reaches session caliber.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Slightly sweet but balanced with a little bitter from.... hops ?..malt ..?? too subtle for me to tell...doesn't change much with warming....it is good though.

664,73,geexploitation,4.32,"This classic brew pours deep and dark -- almost black -- with a dark tan head. The heady aroma is composed mostly of chocolate and espresso, with no hop aroma. Not a lot of complexity there, but what is there is most delectable. The flavors get a little more complex. There's bitter chocolate, expectedly, and a ton of sweetness in the malt. This beer really sets up on the front of your tongue and stays there. Although there's not hop bitterness too offset the sweet flavors, there's plenty of malt bitterness that does the job perfectly. Overall, a smooth, tasty beer. Not for everyday consumption, but definitely a nice treat now and then.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,maddamish,4.55,"A milk chocolate brown in color. Minimal head that stays with the beer all the way to the bottom of the glass. This is one of the smoothest chocolate stouts I have had the pleasure of drinking. Absent of any bitterness, this beer is crossover friendly and palate pleasing. Tasting notes would include chocolate and a smooth malt presence that is never bitter.  Notes: An old standby by that I often pick up when I go to the store. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Guinness fan. They will never go back.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Capped with a foamy tan head that fades to sticky lace.  It smells like chocolate, who knew? Aside from the obvious chocolate there are also hints of coffee. As it warms a light hickory smokiness and hop spiciness is noted.  This is way drinkable. I must admit that allowing it to warm was a bit of a challenge. I will buy this again and recommend to others.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bennetj17,4.2,"Pours dark black, with a thin, dark tan head that quickly turns to film. The smell is mild. It is sweet with chocolate and coffee notes. The taste starts out like marshamallows, kind of dry, and then more coffee and chocolate flavor comes through. Slightly toasty. The mouthfeels is semi-thick, very smooth, with nice carbonation. Nothing exceptional about this brew, but it is so well-rounded that it is highly drinkable and recommended.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,vanrassel,3.73,"This beer poured a dark coffee colour  almost opaque. The head was tan, about one finger high and left thin lacing down the glass as I drank.  I could pick up hints of chocolate in the aroma and also a bit of coffee. The taste was more of the same: it started sweet, but I thought it finished with a bit of coffee bitterness. I agree with earlier comments that people shouldn't worry about this being too chocolatey.  This beer was a little more carbonated than I would have liked and I found it sitting quite heavily by the end. A nice beer, but a niche beer. If I wanted to sit around a quaff a few pints of stout, I'd have a hard time topping good ol' Guinness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,scooter231,3.53,"Dark dark dark, opaque, even. Rich looking with a pretty head. Smells chocolatey and espresso-like with a hint of toastedness. A little lacking in my opinion. Taste is kind of watered down chocolate coffee with a shot of espresso. It's... okay. Tasty but not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Mouthfeel is on the creamy side but too thin. A nice dessert beer, but... there are better ones out there.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,HugoGrim,4.16,"Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into an imperial pint. Notched calander states it is best before March of 2006.  Jet black with very little ruby light poking through. Great looking burnt cream head, but it left quickly. I'd like to try this on draft or in a nitro can to see how it effects the head. Some nice lace develops down the glass.  Scent is roasted malts and dark chocolate. As it sits in the glass and warms a bit it opens up into a warmer milk chocolate/coco bean aroma. It's like the scent went from a truffle at first to the smell of the Hershey Chocolate factory after it had a moment to settle.  Bitter dark chocolate flavor. Quite smooth. Just a hint of black coffee... like a mocha espresso loaded with chocolate liquor. Aftertaste of a lighter chocolate... like coco. I am liking the balance of smooth, subtle sweetness of the chocolate malts and the harsh bitterness of the dark chocolate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The aroma is dark chocolate with some roasted malts coming through. A slight woodie smell with sweetness throughout.  The taste is suprisingly mild. Definite chocolate with some slight hops bitterness. Some nuttiness. A smooth stout. Basically, tasted like a liquified brownie.  The mouthfeel was quite light and chewey. Overall, this was a nice brew that I could drink in moderation, not something I could sit around and drink all evening. Nice with chocolate or fruit dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Just a touch of roast and no discernable hops.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is low, and the body on the heavy side of the medium range. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy.  taste: Flavors of chocolate dominate. Cocoa power, chocolate syrup, chocolate milk...however you put it, chocolate. Not to say that it is cloying, though, as there is enough roasted malt flavor and a light hop bitterness to provide some balance. The only thing I'd like to see is a little more complexity of flavor.  drinkability: easy, especially for a stout  Watery at times, could use a little more character in the aroma and taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,chOAKbarrell,4.3,"I decided to pit my two favorite chocolate stouts (Young's + Rogue) against each other and see which came out on top.  The Rogue is better looking. This Young's has a lighter-colored head, more of a tan than Rogue's deep mocha. Young's is slightly transparent in the pour, although both beers are opague when held up to light.  The alcohol scent is pretty present in Young's, but fortunately there is a lot of other things going on there too. I smell sweet malt, roastiness, a bit of coffee.  The taste is so extremely smooth and well rounded. Truly a delight to drink. I dont taste much bitterness or hops. The only thing is, I dont know if I'd really agree with the ""double"" in the name. I taste more roastiness than anything.  Mouthfeel is pretty creamy. Seems low in carbonation as well (not a negative point).  Young's Double Chocolate Stout is an excellent beer and one of my favorite stouts, but I have to give 1st place to Rogue. Using real chocolate is the key that gives it the edge, I believe.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

I had to push through the head to get to the black richness beneath and found the familiar roasted goodness. At 5.2%, it is rather easy to drink. One would expect a heavier beer, given the color, but this is one great sessioner. The aroma was exceptionally clean and slightly toasty. This beer is simple and very good, much richer in flavor than other stouts. And the chocolate tastes are just out of this world. I could have easily had several of these at one sitting, despite the thickness and meal-like qualities. Overall, a very good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,musingmonkey,3.86,"I wasn't overly impressed with this beer. I'd wished to try it alongside of the Brooklyn offering, but that was not stocked when I purchased this.  A deep black upon pouring, with a 2 finger, almost brown and bubbly head that lasted well into the drink, leaving some thick lacing on the glass. A thing of beauty :)  Smell was roasted malt, a little coffee, but sweet, not burnt. All of these fragrances were rather subtle, and I suspected I'd chilled the stout a little too long. I think was confirmed by the taste.  Based on its name I was expecting some chocolately flavours to be readily apparant, but they were next to undetectable until about my 4th mouthful. This is a sweet, and smooth drink, the sweetness not quite balanced by some bitter, malty tastes. I must admit that as the beer warmed the flavours and complexities mounted. Yet, I felt a little let down by the time I'd finished.  Mouthfeel, however, was wonderful. It was creamy and very smooth, giving me no troubles in taking some hearty gulps.

Head is a light tan color and looks a little fizzier then the head from the glass I had on-tap. It faded a lot faster too.  Scent is faint dark malt, caramel, and chocolate. It's a weak scent though.  Taste is also much weaker then I expected. There's a soft malt flavor and a little chocolate. A faint hoppy flavor ends it.  Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy. Not bad, but not particularly impressive either. Much better on-tap.  It's drinkable, but there are better sweet stouts out there.

Wait... just a hint of bite at the end of the sip, more of an aftertaste, really.  Mouthfeel: Nice and light for how sweet it is; this beer is not at all syrupy.

664,73,SkeeterHawk,4.17,"Appearance: Pours a super dark black color with a large inch+ tan head at first pour. The head was really creamy looking and stayed around for a while. I can't tell if there are any bubbles rising to maintain the head.  Aroma: Sweet and rich chocolaty aroma. It has a really ""soft"" character to it that may be an oatmeal addition or something. It is a very clean and presentable aroma.  Taste: The flavor starts out with some noticeable sweetness, but it doesn't take the chocolate long to kick in and steal the show from then on. The malt and chocolate last until the finish finally kicks in a few seconds after drinking. The finish has a bit of dry bitterness that tastes a bit like eating part of a square of unsweetened cocoa.  Opinion: I really like this beer. I especially like to drink it on tap mixed with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale like a ""Black and Tan"".

664,73,studentofbeer,3.85,"pours a dark brown with red highlights in the light. darkish brown head that sticks with the beer nicely.  aroma is milk chocolate and cocoa, chalky, bit of black cherry,  robust coffee/chocolate taste. they could make a nice starbucks drink out of this. finishes with a rich bitterness. clean and smooth throughout. not as sweet as something like the mackeson XXX stout, but still sweet enough that i wouldnt want to make it a session beer like a dry stout. relatively light on the tongue and smooth, even from the bottle.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,stevecee2003,4.52,"This tasting poured from a tall can, with widget inside.  Presentation: Pours with a slightly slow thinkness. Gives a nice, but not too big head. The body is very dark. The head being light light brown in color, which settles into a small but effective head. Makes for a very nice lace.  Smell: There is a strong hint of coffee, and of course chocolate. But at this point coffee and burnt hops over-ride the initial smells.  Taste: At first taste chocolate slams right into your senses, with a coffee after-taste. This ""widget"" version has much more chocolate taste, it must be said. It seems in the bottle chocolate is good, but in the widget-can chocolate is much more prevelant.  Feel: Feels OK in the mouth, but not remarkable. Not a great session beer. Like a Hersheys chocolate bar, I can only take one or two. But for sheer taste it is very good!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,nomad,3.82,"Young's Double Chocolate has a love cult and I've heard its followers moan in exultation by just a mention of the name. So far my only interaction with this beer has been ignored nitro-taps and stale nitro-cans in the back of the cooler for a few seasons. Too cold, too flat in flavor, too bulldozed by forced gas.  It was with interest that I recently found a fresh pint bottle of this beer, and in new graphics and bottle shape for 2005. Its black with brown edges, starting with a chunky mocha head but possessing no persistence. At times it would leave lace, not often, though.  Smells of thick dollops of caramel over baker's chocolate and coffe-inflected chocolate malt. Sweet and puffy like a stout souffle, yet nutty and alive.  Not complex but a session beer of easy malt, soft yeast character, softer mouthfeel, and plenty of chocolate in both barley and cocoa forms. Nutty in the finish and balanced mostly by roast bitterness but with some earthy hop underneath.  Finally without nitrogen and finally understood, this is a great session stout. I don't know what I was expecting, I think the nitrogen is a major minus for my funny palate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,andjusticeforale,4.3,"This slides out of the bottle like ram's blood, leaving a tan head that quickly dissipates.  The smell is burned caramel fondue.  This is a silky terrific mouthfeel - almost like Guinness, verging on flat. Then there is the most subtle milky cream smokiness that finished like cold unsweetened coffee and a bite of a bittersweet chocolate bar. A dryness then hits your mouth ans you must drink more. This occurs until the glass is empty.  This is not an in your face brew, that you have to choke down with a smile while you swear its great; this really is great.  For once the writing on the bottle does not lie- this beer is a silky luxury.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bahumutx,4.42,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a very dark brown with a slight amber highlight. Has about a 2 finger creamy head.  Smell: Roasted Malt, Chocolate, Coffee. Also pick out a slight Alcohol smell.  Taste: Starts of with a chocolate taste that moves on to roasted malt and ends with a coffee taste. There is also a sweetness that lurks throughout but it is not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Thick and slightly chewy mouth feel with the right amount of carbonation to go along.  Drinkability: Very drinkable.  This is my second Youngs beer and I like it a lot. This is a great stout which is very rich and creamy and would go great by itself or with dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,fromage,3.47,"A nice sweet stout, though a little pricey. I think I'd take left hand over this just for the price of a bottle (don't think I can get any others around here).  Looks good coming out of the bottle and into the pint glass. Near black with a good tan head. Not much lacing or head to soon speak of.  Smells great--deep roasted chocolate and coffee, creamy, with some molasses. Occasionally got a hint of cherry?  Taste is dissapointing and doesn't follow up on the smell. Some carbonated attack and a bit of nutty, bready malt, but just not a full taste. Slightly astringent finish, so it's not too sweet.  Mouthfeel was average. Hoping for something a little fuller and chewier.  Good drinkability, but like most dessert beers, I'd probably be fine with just one. Plus I don't see the taste reward for the volume I'd be drinking!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,ToggleEyes,3.85,"poured out very dark with a small 1 finger head. The head was a dark kaki color with very small bubbles, kind of like pond foam. The can says to serve cool not cold. I let it sit out for about an hour an I think it might have been a little too long, my stout was a little undrinkable. The aroma was definately dark bitter chocolate with malt undertones. To me it also smelled earthy. The mouth feel was very smooth almost milk-like, not really what I was expecting but still ok. The taste was great. it tasted just like it smelled, aslo some honey and hops. It would be hard for me to drink this all the time but it makes for a nice treat every once in a while.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,edmundfitzoil,3.98,"I poured a 16.9 oz. brown bottle and into the trusty, Baldwin-Wallace College standard pint glass.  The beer poured a very dark brown color with a finger of tan head that dissipated to a thin, bubble film and left fine lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is very solid with a nice, big dark chocolate nose. The flavor has the chocolate again, some alcohol hints there (with only 5.2%?) and some faint fruitiness. This is a full bodied brew, but this beer's drinkability is drug down by the sweetness and body. I don't know how many of these I could suck down in a sitting, but what a pleasure it is to drink to drink just one. Going to cupboard to grab a chunk of dark chocolate now...",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DarkerTheBetter,4,Pours a dark brown with slight orange highlights. Smells of chocolate and espresso with some citrus. Tastes of cocoa with a nice malt sweetness and a white grape sourness with a pure chocolate finish. Its full in the mouth but slides quickly across the tongue with light carbonation.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Frozensoul327,3.03,"Can't say I was much impressed with this one. Poured out to a dark black coffee color that seemed much thinner than other Milk Stouts i've had. Lower carbonation yielded a small cream colored film on top of the beer. Aroma was chocolatey and sweet, with some roasted malt afterthoughts. Taste was average; some chocolate mixed with roasted wood notes and some heavy malt character toward the finish. Mouthfeel was too light for my taste, but had a touch of a chewy element to it. Overall, an average brew. I've had better, but this one isn't a bad example of the style.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JanM,4.12,"Pours with two fingers of lattecolored foam. The color is thick, dak brown,almost black. A distinct chocolate aroma with some flowers too. The taste is pretty straightforward chocolate with a bitter hoppiness in the end (or perhaps dark, bitter chocolate?). There is a note of coffee beans there as well. Maybe not as full-bodied as I had expected but surprisingly refreshing. Great stick your head out beer! I don't like the new, ugly bottle though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,KroMagnon,3.73,"Typical nitro-can pour, looks great, black beer with a tan head. The aroma was mild, with hints of grainy maltiness and chocolate clearly present. The flavor was mild too; there was a hint of roastiness and a bittersweet character but not as strong as some bigger porters. There was some hop bitterness at the end with a stronger bitterness from roasted barley. Overall the beer wasn't as heavy as expected, it struck me as maltier than a Guiness Draught but not quite as roasty-bitter. Thanks to my buddy Brad for setting me up with this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,wl0307,4.32,"Revisiting this beer today (25/11/05), this bottle's BBE date is 13 JUN 06. A: in a goblet it pours a dark mahogany hue with a thick and fluffy tan head which settles quickly to a very thin layer of bubbles. The fizz is interesting, making a constant hissing sound and bringing to the surface lots of giant bubbles. S: dark chocolate dominates the note, but not too astringent as real darkest chocolate, as the texture is rather creamy and soft; lightly roasted aroma follows, mixed well with a tinge of vanilla (powder), sourly sweet ripe black plum note, a little fruity perfume and a stream of earthy hops at the back. Overall the nose is very balanced and enticing, not bold nor exciting but really solidly chocolaty smooth and complex--if I may, it's like a pot of chocolate mousse placed on top of a cup of warm coffee. T: it's like a mouthful of chilled chocolate milk with chewy bits of chocolates!! The flavour successfully merges the dark chocolaty edge with the lightly roasted maltiness and nuttiness, underlined by an implicitly imparted dark fruitiness with its slightly tartly-sweet edge, and a slightly woody touch on the sides of the tongue. Not much sticky mouthfeel nor much sugary sweetness is evident in the aftertaste, and the finish is just moderate, with residual aftertaste of a cup of very light coffee. M&D: silky smooth and even creamy on the mouthfeel with a healthy kick of tiny fizz in every sip; the body of this stout is ideal, ever so light that the semi-rich chocolaty maltiness receives a sort of balance in the overall structure, and makes it all the more incredibly easy-drinking, even like a session stout! At 5.2%abv., this beer is a true winner in terms of balance and drinkability. A very solid brew!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kmpitz2,3.9,"Pours a solid deep brown color with very light ruby hues to let me know its not black. Nose is cocoa, slight creamyness, light roast. Solid. Flavor followed that same path, dominated by cocoa and sweeter chocolate. Feel is moderate with a moderate to active carbonation. Just shy of thick. This is a solid beer all around, but drinkability is not as high as I would expect. Should be smooth and easy drinking, but the cocoa keeps me from being able to drink it like I want. Still, very nice.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,daliandragon,4.3,"A highly regarded product from Young's, back in my old stomping grounds in SW18, Wandsworth. Color is a very attractive coal black with auburn outline and a beautiful bouquet with milk chocolate and malted grain sharing the honors. The head is thick and darker than most stout heads. An honestly original aroma with sweet and wholesome tones both. You can almost taste the lactose through the aroma..nice. A high malt count in the taste with a full smack of roasted malt right on the top of the mouth. The aftertaste is very smooth and mellow but with a sweet resonance. This is pretty mint. If you like stouts or chocolate, you will likely enjoy this.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DrZarkov,3.83,"Appearance was nice. Very rich looking. Smell was nothing too spectacular but definitely a little above average. Taste is quite pleasent. Strong chocolate flavor and a good amount of sweetness, but not too sweet. This is one I would recommend to just about everybody. Nothing is too overpowering or strange about this beer so I think many people will like this beer regardless of their favorite style.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mitchel,3.71,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout has a great soft, uneven tan head that holds for a short while and leaves a lots lacing; it pours a deep dark brown/crimson. The aroma is very understated in my opinion. It has very wispy tones of chocolate and coffee. I was assuming big, bold fragrances.  Not very sweet compared to what I was expecting. I find that I would like it to be somewhat sweeter, but the malt is great in this stout. It has suggestions of cocoa and brule sugar. Not too hoppy (is that a word?).  I was presuming it to be thicker, but it is nice. Not as sweet as I expected, but again, nice. It is overall a much understated beer considering what the makers could have done with it. I could drink it for an entire night because it is very smooth and not too pungent. As you can see, I came into this beer having many expectations, the wrong expectations. This shows you that you need to have an open mind and dont judge a beer by its label.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,canucklehead,4.4,"I have had this beer many times but now is the time to write a review. What I love about this stout is the chocolate is apparent in the nose and flavour but rather than making it sickly sweet, it instead works with the malt and coffee notes. This is a big beer that tastes fuller than its ABV suggests. The finish is actually quite dry and you never feel that all the flavour is too much. Less bitterness than St Ambroise and less alcohol than most stouts of this caliber.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Taste: strongest part of the beer. as soon as you ingest it, the chocolate and hops rush to the top of mouth. leaves a very crisp cocoa aftertaste. as a chocolate lover, i am glad to see how Youngs did a good job replicating that cocoa taste in the beer.  Mouthfeel: Smooth around the mouth.  Drinkability: I could sit here all night and drink this beer. Very drinkable.

I have tried it out of a bottle as well as a nitro can, which I recommend because it leaves a nice thick medium-dark head, and it is really good either way. The color is pitch black with a chocolatey aroma. Tastes great, again with a chocolate aftertaste. It is smooth on your tongue. I recommend this stout to everyone.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

A: Virtually opaque black garnet. with a huge bumpy rumbly dark tan head that sticks to the glass. Pretty. The sight says, ""CREAMY""!  S: Burnt sugar on double cocoa-powder coated figs, all roasted and toasted. Malty malty malty. Very little if any hops noticeable to my nose.  T: I repeat: ""Burnt sugar on double cocoa-powder coated figs, all roasted and toasted. Malty malty malty."" However, there is a bit of hop balance here, with a metallic note. Despite all the sweetness, there is a definite dry finish. Nice. As the glass warms, some peppery notes rise, and the roasted bitterness comes along as well.  M: Not as creamy as I expected, but nice enough. Smooth, but not chewy thick.  D: Very drinkable. Very. The sweetness balances the bitterness just right.  Overall, a very enjoyable brew, worthy of its well-deserved accolades. I'll have another, please.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

My nose really isn't picking much up here. What I do smell is real good. Only after a while can a get a sense of roasted malts ~Tastes thick and creamy, very smooth, great experience all the way down. ~Chocolate and roasted malts are present right away, backs into a suble esspresso after-tone. And i say after-tone because I don't want to say aftertaste, for its more sublte than that. This seems to be a beer of subtle joys, for I like it a lot (er, always liked it a lot), and it balances the tastes quite well. ~Don't know that I'd sit down with a case of this, but it is a solid beer, very fun to drink, and generally puts me in a good mood.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Proves that the store keeps fresh stock, and/or that lots of people buy this.  Poured a great dark dark brown, almost black, with a cream-colored head that stuck around (maybe because I didn't give it time to diminish...), with some great lacing.  I smelled heavy-duty dark chocolate up front, followed immediately by toasted nuts, clean hops mixed with roasted malt. Sweet Lord...  The taste is not what I expected at all, which is not a bad thing. I didn't taste as much chocolate as I anticipated, but tasted plenty of toasted nuts and roasted malt for my liking. Nice hop presence throughout, balanced well by all of the toastiness.  This beer was lightly carbonated, and poured right down my throat with the consistency of silky chocolate milk. If only I knew as a child how good the adult version of ""chocolate milk"" would be!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Shovelbum,4.03,"A 500 ml bottle. I love the different raised ram motifs on all of Young's bottles. Label has a best by date.  A robust creamy tan head over a black body. Good lace and head retention. Dark chocolate is dominates the aroma, but notes of roasted malt and vinous fruit poke through as well. The dark chocolate also seems to prevail in the taste, but is not nearly as pronounced as I had expected by the smell and name of this beer. Also taste some nuts and a slight hop bitterness. A tad smoky as well. Medium bodied-- definitely not as thick or sweet as I anticipated. Light and crisp in the mouth with a slightly drying finish.  This is definitely not the beer I thought it was going to be. A meatier body with a touch more sweetness would have helped its cause, but as it stands it is not overpowering and eminently drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mattdavis452,3.38,"Pours a beautiful, dark color with a fine head, about one to one and a half fingers' width. Laces somewhat thick, due to frothy head. To be honest, the head on this beer was almost exemplary with its frothiness.  Smells of chocolate, which is quite convenient considering it has chocolate in it.  The taste and mouthfeel really go hand in hand for this brew; I couldn't get away from how rich it is. I wouldn't recommend it for a session beer, since I had a hard time finishing it. Basically, it's like beer's answer to cheesecake. Both are tasty, but extremely rich.  Therefore, the drinkability is quite low in my book. Just too rich. However, the chocolate taste was good; just take this beer in small samples.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

There is ample lacing. The smell is the only ordinary thing about this beer, for it is minimal and hints of chocolate. The taste is complex, with a strong chocolate presence, competing with brandy, vanilla and malt. There is even a faint hop presence on the tip of the tongue, which never manifests as an overt flavor due to the sweeter flavors which predominate.

Taste is bitter, again reminiscent of espresso. But, espresso which has been dusted with dark cocoa powder, the kind used bake. Nothing sweet about this stout. Just roasted, dark, rich flavors.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little too much carbonation for a stout (not so much that it ruins the beer though). Overall, this brew doesn't live up to its name.

After pouring I held the glass in front of a light bulb and nothing made it through the stout. It pours well with a light brown head and a chocolate smell wafting up from the glass. The smell is of dark chocolate and coffee with roasted malt in there as well. The taste is very good. Chocolate mixes with the bitter stout flavor then gives way to the slight coffee undertone. Aftertaste is chocolatey and sweet. The chocolate is not overpowering and doesn't come on too strongly. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, but smooth.

Taste strongly of chocolate and coffee with a great roasted malt taste. There is a nice hop profile that compliments the malt and chocolate.

Part of it, I am sure, is that I just finished a nice bit of Islay scotch so my tastebuds were dulled but. . . I mean, where is the malt? Stouts should have a certain amount of unfermented sugars lingering. Sugars that provide a texture, the produce a mouthfeel. It was silky, there was a nice chocolate bitterness, but, but, but, why?

664,73,WTexas,3.57,Appeared dark as night with a healthy foaming head. Initial aroma was delightful  a cocoa scent that reminded me of a robust chocolate liqueur. A pleasing flavor of malts and chocolate throughout the pint. Most notable was the superb integration of the flavors. This chocolate stout did not possess the beer+ added flavorings characteristic of some flavored brews. Mouthfeel was smooth but not especially creamy. Light carbonation helps the flavor remain pronounced. I may wait until I finish sampling the other Youngs products that a local distributor is now handling before returning to Double Chocolate Stout. A nice beer to end the evening with.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mitchfor3,4.62,"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle purchased at Trader Joe's for $1.99.  Incredible pour - deep, dark black with reddish hues and an oh so appetizing looking chunky tan head. Good lacing.  An absolutely delightful aroma - hints of chocolate but nothing too strong - a hint of raspberry. A great, great smelling chocolate stout.  Wow, this is some damn fine beer. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever had with just enough bitterness in the aftertaste to carry you from sip to sip. The creamy head adds to the thick, thick texture. The chocolate is really subtle - hinted at and perceived but unlike some chocolate stouts, is well short of overpowering.  I love this beer!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,hoffman,4.47,"I really liked this one. I the beer an apologie for a bad pour....therefor I cannot comment on the head of this beer only to say that the consistancy was creamy and full and that the lace was nice sticking to the glass during the entire session. The beer is an opaque brown nothing earth shattering here but a nice looking beer in the glass. The smell is very prominant, sweet malts are almost exclusive with some hop presence to sting the senses. The taste is sweet and there are not just hints of chocolate but full blown taste at the outset. A very nice balance of sweet and smooth/dry and bitter. The finish is a nice bite to balance the smooth cream of the initial flavor. Very creamy feel nicest part of this one I would say. I like this one as well as any I have had so far from the sweet stout class.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BEERchitect,4.27,"I had higher hopes for this beer. Albeit good, I was expecting more. The beer exhibited good roasted barley qualities with solid bittersweet chocolate aromas with a twinge of lactose. The flavors were solid, but mellow. Not as rich in the lactose and chocolate as I expected. The body is where this beer really fell short with me. It wasn't as silky or smooth as I expected. The texture was a bit grainy and bitter (not from hops) and became watery into the finish. The chocolates never stood out enough to earn the name ""Double Chocolate"". Nevertheless, a good beer, I just expected more.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,xduderx,3.72,"A: a dark blackish with some carbonation  S: smells of coffee and chocolate  T: very typical stout flavors of coffee and chocolate, but as you drink this the aftertaste begins to feel like you've been eating chocolate cake.

664,73,rhoadsrage,4.17,"(Served in an imperial pint glass)  A-This beer pours an inky black opaque body with a creamy smooth dark tan head that has a faint hint of purple in it. A few bubbles stick to the side and it looks like a good carbonation.  S- Deep roast grains with notes of chocolate, coffee, and earthiness permeate. A slight sweetness and tartness are in the background.  T- The smooth taste of deep roasted malt and some creaminess make this very drinkable. Some notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate come through as it warms up. A faint bitterness at the finish might be hops but they are hard to detect.  M- Medium-full mouthfeel is enhanced by the creamy texture. No astringency or alcohol warmth.  D- This is a very nice stout. The taste is a bit watery but the smell and mouthfeel really make up for it.

664,73,Dukeofearl,3.48,"Pours a deep, dark, deep, dark, deep, dark brown though which no light will ever penetrate. Upon the top, a very nice thick, rich looking tan-brown head.  Aroma is chocolate laced with semi-sweet condensed milk, coconut, nuts, bittersweet chocolate, and just a touch of tartness from hops or yeast. Very pleasant, although there is one very hidden off-putting aroma that I can't identify. Maybe I'm trying too hard.  Flavor is bittersweet chocolate (not sweet enough in my opinion) and toffee-malt. I lose the coconut and milk in the flavor, and the mild-moderate hop bite overlain with the chocolate just isn't right to me. My girlfriend really likes the taste of this, but I just don't get it.  Mouthfeel is very creamy, thick, and enjoyable. The flavor reduces the drinkability to me.  Overall, this is a decent beer, but the appeal of Young's beers in general eludes me.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Lightly colored tan head, made of very fine foam, maybe 1/4"" thick.  Smell: Chocolate of course, maybe some coffee also in there.  Taste: Tastes like a pretty good stout. Stouts aren't my favorite style, but I like them once in a while. This one definitely is sweet and smooth, with nice chocolate in the aftertaste.  Notes: Bought for $2.50. Not bad at that price. I'll try it again I suppose, but there are other stouts higher up on the list.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

First sip: toasted. Second sip: toasted stout. Third sip: stout. I get the chocolate, but not in the milk-chocolate way I was expecting. After I let it warm up a bit the chocolate comes through stronger. It tastes good though, maybe chocolate is overstating it a bit, but a pleasure to drink.  It is silky smooth (yes, true to the label) and very sweet. I will definately try again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,battlekow,2.59,"I reviewed Young's Double Chocolate Stout once before, but I don't think I was ready to appreciate it at the time; however, now that I've delved more deeply into the world of stouts and porters, I think I'll give it another shot.  This is probably the best-looking beer I've ever had. It pours an almost opaque black that's capped by an extremely creamy chocolate-colored head. But the best part is the effect given by the carbonation as it's reabsorbed into the liquid: it looks like an hourglass, the brown bubbles ""falling"" down into the black abyss at the bottom of the glass.  Smells of coffee and chocolate, but not very strongly. Tastes and feels watery, like Guinness meets Newcastle. Very disappointing. Again, a very slight bit of coffee and chocolate, and a pleasant roasted bitterness, but there's just not a lot here.  Well, when I saw what it looked like, I was sure I was going to love it, but not so. Beautiful, thin, and boring--Young's Double Chocolate Stout would be popular in high school.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Naes,3.79,"Pours black with a tall tan head that laces well Its aroma is roasty and malty. The flavor is not quite what I expected, judging by its name. Its mostly of roasted malt, yet has bitter and sweet chocolate near the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and is quite creamy.  Dont be scared off by its name if you are not a fan of super sweet stouts. I passed this one up many times due to its name, but now I see the error that I had made by ignoring this one. Definitely worth checking out.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Enola,4.23,"This beer poured out a very dark brown. Not quite black but dark enough. It had a three finger head when poured with good retention. The mouthfeel is fairly good too. It has a little bite to it. Not as smooth as some beers but I would buy it again. The smell is sharp as well. I really like the thick, creamy head. The drinkability of this beer is somewhat decreased by the bite but overall I would recommend it to a dark beer type of person.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,abcsofbeer,4.35,"Poured out a black as used motor oil color with a light brown, creamy head. There was very little lace left over. It appears to have ample carbonation. The bottle indicated a best b4 March 06.  The smell is like pumpernickel bread at first, followed by burnt malt and coffee beans. There is also something sweet in the smell too.  The taste is chewy toffee with a burnt malted flavor and bitter chocolate. There is a slight aftertaste of hops. This stout is very good.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AltBock,4.16,"14.9 floz. nitro can  Appearance: When it was first poured, it was black on top and brown on the bottom. When it settled it went with the jet black color with a small amount of ruby highlights. It had a creamy tan colored head of foam the measured somewhere between 1 to 2 inches that left lots of lace. When first poured, I also saw the carbonation bubbles pop on top of the foam. A true delight! Smell: It had an aroma of sweet dark chocolate, little caramel, and some burnt coffee. It smelled like it says on the can, double chocolate. Taste: It had a pleasant taste of dark chocolate, malt, and some roasted coffee beans. If you like coffee with chocolate in it, this your beer. Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and with a dry roasted coffee aftertaste. This beer gets better when it warms up. Drinkability: A wonderful milk/sweet stout that you can drink all day, due to the low alcohol content. The price was also reasonable at a little less than $2 for a 14.9 oz can of this delicious beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jaluria,3.75,"Pours a dark, opaque color with a lighter head and good retention. I detect aromas of different varieties of chocolate and cocoa. Very pleasing. My first taste is a blast of chocolate and expresso. As the brew warms, the other characteristics become apparent; a slight nutty flavor with more distinct coffee undertones. I get a rich, bitter-sweet aftertaste that leaves me wanting more. The lower alcohol content for this beer prevents the 'warming' sensation typical of this style. Overall, a very good beer with reasonable complexity and a taste that can be overpowering at times, that's why I'm not scoring it as high in the taste department.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Fugazme,4.2,"Best Before 2/06  Very black beer with a thick, creamy tan head about 3/4"" thick...  Sticks great to the glass. Good lacing.  A very nice looking beer with a good combo of large and small bubbles.  Super aroma. Chocolate, maple, hops, dark roast coffee, caramel.  Great dark chocolate flavor. A touch of hops. Dry finish.

Lightly/moderately sweet/acidic/bitter, milk chocolate, and caramel malt taste with some coffee and a resin and orange hops flavor.  Medium bodied, dry and creamy texture, no carbonation, and a smooth slightly metallic/astringent finish.  Very balanced for a nitro and seems some what light for the nomenclature however has a balanced finish and good for a session.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,malty,3.85,"Pours black with dark ruby edges. Dense beige head settles to a solid 1/2"".  Sweet milk chocolate pudding. Dark roasted malts with a bitter twinge. Dominant chocolate notes once again.  Sweet milky chocolate (catch the trend?) with a faint bitter finish. Not much roastedness comes through in the layers of chocolate flavors. There is a nicely appointed semi-dryness to cap things off.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but still very creamy and lush nonetheless. Medium body with a long, lingering finish.  Drinkability is good. I wouldn't mind having a couple of these, but I believe the sweetness might become a tad bit too much.  Overall a very flavorful and definitely chocolaty stout. There are no coffee flavors (maybe mocha latte) in this stout, just layers upon layers of chocolate. I remember having this on tap a couple years ago and liking it more than this nitro can.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bubrewer,4.47,"16.9 oz crown top bottle. Best before 8/05; sampled in 9/05.  Impressions start with the bottle, and this one feels heavy and solid. As a homebrewer I'm glad to have it for refilling later. I'm a puzzled, however, by the CAMRA logo on the neck - as far as I can tell, this is not a bottle conditioned beer, and I thought fermentation in the serving vessel was a requirement of CAMRA.  That's enough rabbit chasing - what about the beer?  There is no nitro-widget in this bottle, so it is delivered as yeast intended. The tan head hangs on like mousse and is creamy and smooth all by itself.  Creamy, coating mouthfeel is delightful. The taste first reminds me of a chocolate covered coffee bean. Roast malt shows up next as sort of a coarse bitterness, but it balances so wonderfully with the sweetness of this beer. I'm sure there are hops in this beer somewhere, but to my palate, they are overshadowed by the dark malt and dark chocolate.  Although the bottle lists this at 5.2% ABV, it drinks a little bigger. There is a slight pleasant alcohol warming that I usually only notice in bigger beers.  Although I think my words are not capturing the moment very well, this is a really great beer that would be welcome in my kegerator any time. well, more so in the fall and winter, I think. It is a little rich and thick for the Florida summer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,neonbrown82,4.09,"I've had this beer several times in the bottle and enjoyed it (though I have yet to review it), so I was interested in trying the nitro can variety. Ooooh, that sound. Cracks open with a Star Trek airlock door hiss followed by a nitro released whistle. Bad ass.  The beer pours with a great creamy chocolate head due to the nitro. I love watching the nitro separate out into the espresso looking foam. The beer itself is a nearly opaque black. Looks great.  The smell suffers a bit from the nitro, it seems. Smells very mild, but has a light chocolatey malt character. Smells like a Guiness Extra Stout or a Newcastle, almost.  The taste like cocoa. The nitro seems to affect the taste negatively until well after the pouring, particularly until the beer begins to warm up a bit. When the nitro is still fresh, the beer can be held in the mouth yet not tasted until the swallow. As it finally warms, however, it is rich and sweet.  The mouthfeel is very velvety and rich. Leaves a foam on the upper lip with each tip of the glass. Becomes less creamy and velvety as the nitro dissapates.  A good drinkable stout. I prefer it in the bottle, but the nitro is an interesting change of pace.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,EmoBeerGuy,3.88,"This wonderful beer has been my beer of choice for the past month or so. I hated the idea of nitro stouts after too many bland, off Guinesses. This has restored my faith and must be what Ireland was after when they came up with the idea.  The fullness of the malts along with the ridiculous cream and the finishing sweetness make this beer a truly satisfying yet strangely drinkable beer.  Recommened, and readily availble.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Melchizedek,4.13,"Beautiful stout, opaque black with a nice lingering half-inch head, heavy lacing down the sides of the glass. Smell is mellow but rich, with roasty, coffee-chocolate aromas coming through.  This is wonderful in the mouth, with a smooth-as-silk, creamy texture. The taste is layered, with a bit of up-front sweetness and alcohol over a strong roasted-grain background, creating an overall impression of a strong coffee with a shot of dark chocolate. Finishes much drier, with a perfect lingering bitterness again reminiscent of good coffee--it makes the mouth water for more. I was sad to see the last of this go down.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,nickss,3.86,"Pours a deep deep dark brown (near black) with a large puffy tan head.  Aroma gives hints of chocolate, not as much as I remembered. A hefty bit of malt, with a bit of berries on the tail end.  Strong mocha bitterness in the taste... lots and lots of chocolatey yumminess in this one.  Mouthfeel is moderately thick, but I was hoping for a bit more creaminess here.  All in all, quite inoffensive and drinkable, but I'll stick with the Choc. from Rogue.... a bit more complex IMO.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Taste: Cocoa powder, hazelnut, light roasted coffee, and a touch of heavy whipping cream. Nicely blended and maybe a little light on the flavor. Finishes with a powdery sweetness.

The taste is a lot blander than i remember, it may be the can or this sample may be old, but this is watered down and not as chocolatey as i remember it.

Head is about an inch thick, rich and creamy tan/off white. The head hold up very well. pretty average for a stout from a nitro-can.  smell: you can really smell the chocolate! I also detected slight prune aroma as well as the slight touch of alcohol. Smells of toast.  taste: My favorite part!! The chocolate does not hit you right away, but after it fades into a nice toasty after taste you can taste the dark chocolate, almost like a cooking chocolate. Slight bitter alcohol taste on the back of my tongue. very desert-like, I could probably only handle a couple of these at a time, but a very pleasant beer!  Mouthfeel: very smooth and creamy, light on the palate, you'd expect such a chocolately stout to be a bit heavier...  Drinkability: I'd say it's average to above average... it's a great desert beer but one is probably enough!  This is a great beer!

Huge head, almost like it was shaken or something, took a while to pour acutally. Smell was subtle at first - malty, a little sweet, with failt chocolate/coffee notes at the end. Nothing spectacular...until it warmed a bit, and it got amazing. Authentic chocolately, coffee-infused mocha. Taste followed a similar pattern - subtley malty with hoppy balance and choco/coffee notes that became so much richer as it warmed. Detected some slight alcoholic notes, but nothing major. The heady pour made me worried about over-carbonation, but it was perfect along with the smooth creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is stellar, I could drink this all night for sure.

The body is black with ruby/brown coming through at the edges when held to light. The smell has chocolate, coffee, a roasted character, and a milky sweetness along with a bit of hops. The taste follows this but with hop nuances - mostly pine and floral - and a nice bitterness that lingers. The flavor isn't too strong but it is strong enough. It has a medium body with a nice carbonation and is somewhat creamy. Delicious.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ypsifly,4.03,"Nitro can with a best by date of1/24/06 ink jetted on the bottom of the can, poured into an imperial pint.  Thick ass nitro head with that trippy cascade effect. Black as expected with the inside of the glass coated by a thick, very light tan sheet.  Nice pairing of malt and chocolate in the nose. Not very strong at all, but pleasant.  The taste follows along the same lines as the nose, malty upfront with chocoalte joing in midway and taking over into a rather dry finish. Nice velvety mouthfeel. I could drink this one all night. Good after dinner drink as well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,SetarconeX,3.88,"A nice looking brew that's just a few steps away from perfection. A lovely jet black stout color, with a decent froth, though the carbonation is rather light. The scent is probably the worst feature, being a tad astringent, which carries over slightly into the taste, but not too badly. For the most part, the taste is wonderful, a nicely toasted stout flavor with a hearty amount of chocolate. It lacks the harsh bite that comes with most dark stouts, and goes down remarkably smooth, making it really about the most drinkable stouts I've had in a while. Highly recommended.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BamaScholar,4.57,"Had always heard great things about this brew, and it does not disappoint.  Pour was fine...perhaps it was the milk content but this stout wasn't quite as clingy as some others. *However,* this brew smelled and tasted absolutely delicious. The chocolate character is not a strong one and it is a mild, hazelnutty flavor indicative of the European tradition.  The chocolate/buttery richness is delicious but hurts the drinkability slightly, as one bottle is plenty filling.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Ricochet,3.85,"A nice, deep rich, stout. I just know I would like this more if it were from the tap, but the bottle is what I had to deal with so here goes...  It was very dark, but not completely black for a stout and it smelled complex, almost like bitter chocolate bars but no surprise, there was a little hint of alcohol . Mouth was typical sweet stout. A little thin and watery but foamed nicely. Tasted like a richly roasted chocolate malt, with a twinge of the alcohol with a plesant choclate finish and slight bitterness. Good stuff.  Drinkability: Average for me. I probably would pick some of the other/local beers I've reviewed rather than getting this based on price, but this was a good stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerNutta,3.38,"Poured a dark brown liquid with a head that lingers.  Smelt of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts.  Taste pretty much the same as above. Roasted malt flavour accompanied by a smooth chocolate/coffee finish.  Not overly carbonated so that the flavours can be enjoyed. If I had any complaints is the fact that it was a little watery.  Not a bad beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bceaglejoe,3.93,"Presentation: Purchased in June 2005, poured from a 14.9oz nitro can with production date (2 March 2005) stamped on the bottom. There was a little nitro widget in the can. Poured a creamy, milk chocolate color that turned to a pitch black. A neat ""reverse cascade"" effect brought about a finger-thick head with good retention. It was definitely a good-looking beer. The scent was of chocolate and lactose, with ever-so-slight roasted malt characteristics.  Tasting: Hints of sweetness came across on the front of the tongue, followed by roasted malt flavoring and chocolate on the back. I detected a slightly ""metallic"" taste as well - perhaps it was the effect of the can, but I'm not sure. It took a little away from the beer itself. Just the slightest hop bitterness came across. It was a thick beer with a decent viscosity and a full body. It left a good aftertaste.  I think this beer really does a great justice to the Milk / Sweet Stout style. I would recommend it for those who are interested in trying a Stout for the first time and want a little sweetness as well. It also would go well with food. Perhaps it's better on tap or in the bottle. I'd recommend those styles before the nitro can, but this isn't bad by any means.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JackStraw22,3.45,"Dark black body, nearly completely opaque, but not quite. Decent head, stuck around some, no lacing. Huge roasted malt aroma, very nice. Sweet, creamy cocoa comes through as the glass warms. Some hops in the nose was well, but just a hint. Only drawback is the mouthfell. It is quite thin for a stout, a little dissapointing. Sweet and milky, chocolate is obviously in the forefront. Clean bitterness balances the beer nicely. Worth a try, but lots of other stouts I like better.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mushroomcloud,3.88,"The stout poured a dark black with just the slightest red in the edges when held up to the light. There was a small 1/2"" creamy head that disappeared too quickly(nothing beats seeing this head rise up when poured on tap!). There was some light lacing on the glass. The smell was predominantly roasted malt at first, as the stout warmed up some of the chocolate aroma started to come out. The taste, I think, was delicious. The liquid has a creamy, velvety mouthfeel. The brew has a medium carbonation. The first taste is a earthy, roasted flavor. As the beer hits mid mouth the sweet milk chocolate flavor envelops the tongue. A nice roasted bitter finish lingers around for a long, long time. This beer is the bomb on draught, and it is very good from the bottle. Very drinkable stout, I enjoyed this one after dinner while watching Band of Brothers for the third time. Very nice beer from Young's and probably still my favorite English brew yet.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,danielharper,4.03,"Purchased from Midtown Wine and Spirits, Nashville, TN.  Pours from the nitro-can the way all nitro-can beers do, slowly turning from that dark brown color into the black, black body with a pure-white head on top. The head is extremely creamy and no bubbles are immediately visible; it almost looks like a layer of milk on top of the stout. The head sticks around for the entire length of the beer, even if consumed slowly. Very nice presentation.  The smell is quite sweet, has a milky, vaguely chocolatey aroma that is pleasing to the nose. As the beer warms, this becomes more pronounced -- I'd recommend letting this one almost reach room temperature before pouring, unless you're taking your time with it and give it time to warm in the glass.  Taste is good but not exactly great. I don't know if it was the nitro can, but my beer had a kind of metallic taste at first, although that aspect went away as I got deeper into the beer. Chocolate and coffee notes noted, but somehow muted -- this tasted more like an ordinary stout than a sweet stout to me, although the hop bitterness was also minimal. Relaxing and soothing, especially after a long day when I just need something to help me relax. Best by itself without food or as a dessert pairing.  I've read other reviews of this that describe an almost chewy mouthfeel, but for me this beer was thin and watery. Not unpleasant, for the thinner mouthfeel did make it easier to drink, but I think a stout should generally be a bit thicker than this. It may be that the nitro-can affects the carbonation and, thus, the overall mouthfeel here.  A very drinkable brew. I only had one at this sitting, but I'm hoarding the other three for another time -- this beer isn't available in my area, and I'm not planning another trip to Nashville anytime soon.  I'm going to try this beer in bottles first chance I get, and I think it might be better on-tap. While the nitro-cans improve the overall experience of Guinness and others, I suspect that this one would be better in a bottle -- when I have a chance to try it, I'll review it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bark,3.98,"The colour is pinch black, the head is pale brown, two finger thick, uneven and stable.  The smell is a bit bitter with an apparent note of cocoa powder and some cream. Maybe there is a hint of coffee too? Could have been stronger, though.  The taste is very creamy with a fine, bitter taste of chocolate. There is also a bitter touch and some cream-like sweetness. The aftertaste got notes of bitter chocolate and cappuccino, but not very much of beer.  The carbonation is rather simple, more like a standard lager, it could have been creamier.  A nice and different stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,garymuchow,3.98,"Aroma shows a thick dark roast malt. Nice. Less of the nitro can aroma, so I'll give it extra credit. Great show! Great cascade. Thick firm creamy looking head. Black as night. Lacing. Less impressive flavors than appearance and aroma. Farily simple with a strong nitro presence. Dark malt with less roast than aroma. Adequate dryness in the middle along with a bitterness that remains through the finish. In time it takes on a chocolate quality, but not really that much. Nice creamy feel in the head and body. Smooth and silky (as it says on the can). Medium overall feel. Overall a nice drink. Just wish the flavor would match the other aspects.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The taste is dominated creamy chocolate, smoky malt, and a nice little hop twang that lingers in the aftertaste.  The mouth feel is very creamy and drinkable is lost perfect.  Overall, this stout is near perfection, Dark chocolate is dominate but the balance the this ale is what I look for.  Thumbs Up!!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,elricorico,4.53,"This beer pours near black with a thick foamy tan coloured head. The head recedes some but never really fades away.  The smell is more like a dry stout than a sweet one, though, as the beer warms, it takes on more and more of a chocolate flavour.  The taste is excellent. Lightly sweetened up front with a bitter chocolate finish. All flavours have some staying power and leave me very satisfied.  Mouthfeel I would say is as good as it can get. Creamy with light carbonation. It is perfectly complimentary to the taste. Drinkability is off the charts, as I can't imagine myself turning down this beer.  This is one of my favorites, and I tend to keep at least one bottle around at all times to treat myself.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ski271,3.98,"On tap at Zeno's in State College, PA  Appearance: Black with a medium-large, creamy, light brown head that has great retention and clings to the glass leaving thick rings of lacing. VERY inviting.  Smell: Dominated by chocolate. Nice roasted malt smell.  Taste: Wow! Now thats chocolate! Sweet and malty, but a little hollow-tasting. The finish is lightly bitter but not as big or long-lasting as I expected.  Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected as well. The nitro pour give it that wonderful velvety texture I love, and it really works with the sweetness that it makes you almost reluctant to swallow.  Drinkability: I had heard that this is a good beer to go with desert, and I agree that it would go well with a brownie or chocolate chip cookie, but I think it could qualify as a desert itself. I enjoyed it, but prefer a heavier stout, but that's just a personal preference, so I guess I need to take that into account when rating it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,beersarang,3.95,"Pours a black that is pretty damn dark with an also very dark tan head. Quite nice. Head is creamy, with huge sheets of lace down the glass. Nitro for sure.  Smells like dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate envelope the nose.  Roasty toasty barley hits the toungue, with just a dash of flowery hops that blend into the malt background, probably kent goldings, chocolate presents itself and fades into more dark roasted barley. Finishes a little dry and astringent.  Creamy creamy creamy, just the right amount of nitro carbonation. Overall very good and pretty drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Chadbrew,3.95,"The bottle has a best before end of Feb 2005 on it... oops. Should have checked that before I bought it I guess, oh well let's see how it fares.  Appearance - A very dark almost black beer with only highlights of red around the rim of the glass where the light manages to penetrate. There is a quarter inch of fluffy off-white head that diminishes quickly and is replaced with some decent lacing.  Smell - Lots of malt and chocolate with hints of coffee and roasted grains and nuts.  Taste - There is the taste of coffee and bitter-sweet chocolate. My overall impression is that it is very dry. The finish is rather bitter also.  Mouthfeel - The body is good, not great. Rather thinner than I had expected.  Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. I enjoyed sipping this beer and trying to uncover all the subtle little flavors this one has.

Lots of sweet chocolate jump out in the taste, along with a little roasted grain. Some hops are apparent in the finish, but definitely take a back seat to the sweet creaminess.

The nose has all the requisite stout aromas, but I detected a sort of burnt cookie aspect to it, hence the lower score. The taste is pure heaven. It really is chocolatey with excellent bitter counterbalance. Tried with a slice of chocolate decadence at dessert - a great combo. In the mouth it is like a tailored jacket for your tongue. Almost too rich, it would be too filling to drink more than one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Aromas of dark chocolate, hints of milk, treacle (sweet malt I guess) and rum soaked raisins. Not so much sweetness in the taste, more like dark chocolate with a little extra bitterness thrown in. Slight burnt taste towards the end as well. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy as expected, but became a little watery as the beer warmed and the carbonation receeded.

664,73,bearrunner44,3.83,"Appearance: Pitch black with a sticky, dark tan head. The beer left a nice layer of sticky foam along the sides of my glass. An above-average looking stout.  Smell: A sweet, rosey aroma with hints of malt, cocoa, and a touch of alcohol. The smell is typical of English stouts.  Taste: It's a tad over-carbonated for a stout. The main flavor is a light, roasted bitterness that's present throughout most of the beer, and it finishes with a floral, alcoholic sweetness that, while subtle, was a little too cloying for my taste.  Mouthfeel: A little overcarbonated, but it has a nice body to it.  Verdict: Overall, this is a nice, roasty stout. The sweetness in the finish ruined it a little for me, though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Sweet milk chocolate aroma with a chocolate malt note. Some pear adds to complexity. Medium to full body. A well blended combination of real chocolate, chocolate malt, roasted barley dryness balanced with hop bitterness. So drinkable I have nothing written down. I remember wanting a little more complexity from the stout side and being well satisfied by the chocolate not overwhelming the stout.

Aroma is dark chocolate, roasted malts, toffee and chicory. Taste is strong on the dark (bitter) chocolates and the roasted chicory-like malts. There is a tad of hoppy bitterness just under the surface. There is also a bit of toffee-caramel sweetness. Not too sweet.  Mouthfeel is smooth and oily, with nice carbonation.

There's grass and roasted malt up front in the nose, then something vegetal and cabbagey. Then the brew goes through a series of chocolate phases. The first appearance is of hot cocoa (!) which fades into bittersweet chocolate, then a slightly coffee-ish chocolate thing. The taste undergoes a similiar transformation, but dark chocolate mostly holds court with roasted malt, with a surprising hop element circling around the periphery.

The first third of the can came out chocolate brown, but then it switched to midnight brown. The aroma is a bit smokey, but very chocolatey and surprisingly slightly hoppy. The flavor as also very surprising. I was expecting more smooth and chocolate milk-like. But I got more dark chocolate with a very nice hoppy kick at the end. There were also slight burnt malts happening. The mouthfeel is rather heavy and very rich.

Without being to heavy on the chocolate, it still lives up to its name.  Mouthfeel is up there as well, finishes fairly dry with a lingering black malt taste.  Drinkability is average.

And the smell is pretty strong, too, right after the beer is poured. Also, a healthy malty sweetness that says ""England."" The chocolate smell tends to fade . . . bummer.  Taste - This beer has a definite chocolate taste, but it is not overdone. Rather, the chocolate blends well with the malty sweetness. There is a certain crispness to this beer as well. I would guess that hard water might contribute to this, but I really don't know for sure.  Mouthfeel - While this beer feels a bit lighter than other stouts I've had recently, it is no slouch. The label says it best ""Silky Smooth Rich & Creamy.""  Drinkability - This beer is really smooth, and thus is highly drinkable. There is no strong lingering aftertaste, which is not a bad thing.

Aroma: Lots of chocolate-caramel... toffeeish, maybe even fudge-like. Sweet and appetizing.  Flavor: The name of the beer is dead-on. Wonderful chocolate flavors, both creamy, smooth milk-chocolate along with more bitter dark chocolate. Hops are almost imperceptable, disappearing into the background completely, but it's never cloying, just perfectly in balance. Finish is surprisingly light, but lingers nicely.  Body: Medium-full, with rich and creamy mouthfeel, very chewy.  I'm more of a fan of lighter beers, and only drink a few stouts, but this beer is so well-crafted that I become completely enraptured with every time I drink one, and forget my normal prejudices. Truly wonderful.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,beveragecaptain,4.36,"Poured from a 440 ml nitro can. This beer is nearly black. The tan head is quite large. You know how you can tell a beer has a nice head? When it is 2 inches high when you pour it, and there is still 2 inches of head in the bottom of the glass when you finish. Aroma is chocolatey, and it improves as the beer warms. One of the best chocolate flavors I've experienced in a beer. I could not detect any hop flavor. The creamy mouthfeel brings out the flavors in this beer, and also makes this beer go down so easily.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,carln26,4.42,"Deep brown to black color with a creamy tan head (nitro tap). The pour led to a thick creamy sheet of lace down the side of the glass. All chocolate roast malt aromas, a mild hop aroma (accenting the cherry) appeared in back. Taste is dominated by chocolate and cherry with the slightest bit of hops. The roasted hops used in the brew definitely combine well to bring out a berry aroma and flavor. Creamy, velvety mouth feel. Give me more!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bultrey,4.7,"This is the classic example of a beer brewed with chocolate. It's just a notch above others I've had, like Sammy's Choc Bock or Rogue Chocolate Stout.  This is such a beautiful color, nice frothy head, art in a glass. Bittersweet roastiness up front followed by a biscuity chocolaty flavor, as if you melted good milk chocolate over a cookie. It accomplishes this, however, without being syrupy -- in fact, it's rather light on the palate and incredibly refreshing and easy to drink. If there's such a thing as a session sweet stout, this is it.  God I love this beer. So does my girlfriend. Don't know if that's good or bad.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Sycodrummer,4.8,"Poured from a 500ml brown bottle into a 12oz. tulip glass this beer was very dark. More so that other stouts and a deep 2 finger light tan head formed that would not quit.  Smell was of caramel, strong black coffee, cocoa, and chocolate. Very inticing and made me want to dive right into the sample.  Taste was incredible, very well balanced and creamy on the palate. Chocolate malts cuts through the taste but is not over-powering like SA chocolate bock.  Very easy to enjoy, though also rather filling. Despite this, I could have easily enjoyed more than the 500ml offered from the bottle. A great stout and a great beer that I will be sure to have time and time again. Would be perfect with a chocolate dessert or alone as a dessert in and of itself. IMO as chocolate stouts go, perhaps only surpassed by Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Opethsprite,4.76,"The description on the bottle reads ""silky"" ""rich"" ""creamy"" ""smooth""...and blissfully, all of this was delivered by the beer. The $2.99 I spent on just over a pint was well worth the investment. Great winter beer.  Appearance: A creamy, caramel head rests on a nearly opaque, nearly black beer with strands of gold and amber.  Smell: Chocolate with a little orange, followed by a little bit of coffee.  Taste: Very complex! Starts with a bitter chocolate and followed by the slight coffee taste. As it warms slightly, the chocolate becomes less bitter and more sweet, and the coffee is more pronounced in the finish. Solid malts.  Mouthfeel: Extremely thick, smooth, and creamy. Just a little carbonation.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, save for those who are repulsed by the taste of coffee, as my mate was.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Viggo,3.8,"Pours very black, with a tan head about one finger thick head. The beer laced well throughout the glass. Smells roasty, with some coffee, and chocolate notes. Taste was lighter than I expected, malty flavour with a nice chocolate note at the end. Really thought it would be a lot more chocolate like, but the double chocolate name is quite deceiving as its a quite subdued chocolate flavour. Has a nice and smooth mouthfeel with a little bitterness. Beer has pretty good drinkability, could see myself downing a few of these. Good beer but i was a little disappointed in the chocolate content.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Kookiekwan,3.98,"This beer pours black has a two finger tan head with good retention and thick lacing. The aroma was of burnt chocolate. The taste was chocolaty sweet at first sip and then moves to a bakers bitter chocolate finish. This beer was medium bodied, very smooth and drinkable.  Reflection: WOW! This is what a chocolate stout should taste like. They didn't pull any punches with the chocolate and they still made a very refreshing and drinkable dessert beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Gagnonsux,4.15,"Appearance is black with light-brown head. A nice layer of cream resides on top and remains throughout the pint. Smell isn't very strong, but fairly rich. Aroma is more of real chocolate than chocolate malts. Taste is rich and smooth. Dark chocolate tastes are the strongest, though I think they should be even stronger. Mouthfeel is very creamy and enjoyable. Drinkability is great for such a dark beer, this isn't as heavy as I predicted. I really enjoyed Young's Double Chocolate, I think it could be beer nirvana if the chocolate flavor was even stronger. A great beer for dessert!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BigBry,4.55,"500 ml bottle. Nice for a dessert. Black liquid - very little light gets thru, with a tan brown head. Aromas of coffee and chocolate is present - like a bitter, baking chocolate. As it warms up, the chocolate becomes even more pronounced. Amazing smells. Can really taste both chocolate malt and and dark chocolate or cocoa as well. Creamy, with a full body, smooth as velvet. Dry and slightly bitter aftertaste, like dark bitter chocolate. Not an every day drink, but awesome for a special occasion. Two thumbs up.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kegerator,4.38,"Very nice stout. pours out a deep deep mohagany/black with a nice 1 1/2 inch head that retains very well and leaves decent lacing throughout. smells of chocolate as would be expected, and some deep roasted coffee aromas as well. taste was very nice, chocolate goodness up front with a slight bitterness to finish. mouthfeel was somewhere between guiness and storm king. not as thin as Guiness but not near as heavy as storm king. all in all a very drinkable and enjoyable stout. i will definitley drink this again",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AlexJ,3.85,"This marks the first time I've had the pleasure of drinking this beer fresh from a nitro-tap instead of a pub-can, what a differance! -Pours dark black with a tight, silky-smooth, froth of head that remains throughout the tasting. Moderate lace that disssapears by the time I'm finished -Sweet aromas of chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate. I also detect a distinct banana-marshmellow aroma that is quite appealing, followed by a toasty coffee aroma. -Taste is sweet and roasty, dominated by deep chocolate flavors and ripe, dark pit-fruit. There's that banana-marshmellow thing again-must be the nitro. -Mouthfeel is silky and smooth, with a surprisingly light body. Overall very good and drinkable. Probably too sweet for mass-consumption, but great for dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,aquatonex,3.83,"Woo ha! Chocolate in beer!  Pours black with a little light peeking in. Very dark and rich looking. Thick head that has very good retention. Smells of faint malts and chocolate. Heavily carbonated, could do with less (took some points for that in taste, it left me gassy the rest of the night). Otherwise, is an almost bitter, heavy malt flavor with significant chocolate tastes that become more prominent as you're finishing your sips. Very nice, true chocolate taste. Goes down alright, except for the extreme carbonation causing you to almost regurge. Overall, I'd get it again, but I'd have to prepare myself for the bubbles. Also, was expecting a little extra sweetness.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,soulfly967,4.08,"I had this on tap at Smokin Joe's in the Southside of Pittsburgh. Beautiful black body with great tan head and excellent cascading action due to the nitrogen tap. The smell was of toasted malt and dark chocolate. The flavor was nice and malty with a subtle dark chocolate aftertaste that became more apparent as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Man, this is an excellent beer! Not quite as good as Rogue Chocolate, IMO, but it is still a top notch brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The flavor of chocolate becomes much more apparent as the drink warms.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy; not a bit of harshness.  Drinkability: Very tasty.

The color is an ice dark brown to black with no light coming through. The nose is full of dark chocolate, alcohol, and malty sweet scents. The flavor is a bit sour and very roasty at the beginning. Notes of raisin, tangerine, and caramel. A big contribution of chocolate malt gives it a good base for other flavors. Unfortunately I found that this beer had an unpleasant sourness to it that hurt the overall flavor. It is a bit watery at the end as well, not as creamy as expected for the style.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,cncbofh,4.07,"Two-stage pour into my goblet yielded only a minimal tan head. Head was creamy but dissipated quickly. Dark colored beer.  Smell of raisins, oak, and slight alcohol. Very malty smell that was inviting.  Taste was damn good. Lots of wood and chocolate. Slight sweetness probably from the extra sugars (lactose?)... definite taste of roasted barley and chocolate malts to give it a slight bitter edge. Very well balanced. Not a chewy full-bodied beer like I expected, but rather the mouthfeel was silky smooth and went down very easy.  A staple sweet stout that I will return to many more times.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,far333,4.11,"Deep dark brown with chestnut and ruby highlights. The widget did its work - the beer cascaded for a few minutes and left a half-inch cap of thick finely bubbled foam that hung around for the duration. Aroma is light and reminds of sweet malt, some chalky cocoa, a bit of roastiness. Flavor is thin at first, but gathers pungency as it travels. Cocoa yes, but it's light and allows other flavors to rise up like raisin, cherry, bitter coffee, and smoke from a smoldering fireplace. As the glass warms, resinous bark flavors and hints of whiskey arise. Like it says on the can, drink it cool, but not ice cold.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Appearance: Large light brown head, dissipates at a moderate pace, leaves a ton of lacing on the glass. This beer is pitch black, hard to tell what color it is even when its held up to the light.  Nose: Nose is chocolately with a touch of coffee.  Taste: Definite dark chocolate flavor, full of dark roasty malts with some coffee in the finish. Light sweetness, yet finishes dry. Bitterness is very low.  Notes: A wonderful chocolately stout that never disappoints. I usually drink it on nitro-tap or nitrocan. I feel that the bottled version has a thinner body, leaves a slick mouthfeel, probably from the lactose or dextrins, .

664,73,asabreed,4.5,"4-pack of cans picked up for about 7 dollars, and completely worth it in my opinion.  Appearance - Absolutely opaque with fantastic head that should definitely come from all nitro can brews. Also you have to love the magic that happens from the pour as the beer does the magical reverse climb up the glass. Head also keeps reappearing as the glass gets tipped toward your mouth.  Smell - Burnt, dark chocolate all the way. The sweetness and milkiness is evident from the smell also. They need to make a candle of its smell for sure.  Taste - Just what you expect from the smell. It's balanced well and the maltiness is not overpowering. Unsweetened, dark chocolate. Obviously gets better and more flavorful as it warms too.  Mouthfeel - Coating. Full-bodied but not extremely thick.  Drinkability - As with most stouts like this, I like to have one with some kind of dessert or just have this as a dessert by itself. It'd be a shame to drink all 4 cans in one session, also. But it's nice to kick back and have one and drink it for about an hour.  One of my favorite stouts overall. A 4-pack of the cans is surely worth it if you're looking to try it. Never had it in the bottle, and knowing how delicious it is in the can I don't know if I really want to.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,LarryKemp,4.08,"A dark, DARK black liquid with a strong tan, long lasting head. The head left lace on the glass as the drink filled my soul.  The creaminess filled my nose as well as the anticipation of the chocolate to come. Chocolate and cream. Chocolate and cream. Nothing else was in my nose.  The flavor of this beer is more like a chocolate shake than a beer. The high sweetness blasts through the finish and lingers on the tongue. The chocolate flavors dominate all else. No other malts. No hops. No off flavors stand a chance against this chocolate monster. There is no balance between this flavor and any other.  The mouthfeel is a little light for style but is very creamy. The carbonation is slightly more than light and plays with the tongue. The sweetness from unfermented sugars does enhance the mouthfeel.  This stout may not be for everyone, but the sweet chocolate is so dominate that nothing else is exactly like it. Long after the beer is gone, one can still imagine EXACTLY how it tasted. This one I hightly recommend.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,KoG,4.56,"Dark black body with a generous amount of creamy tan head that stayed throughout the drinking. Left a bunch of chunky lacing that stuck in place.  Smells of semi-sweet chocolate and coffee with a bit of roasted barley.  Taste is excellent. Chocolate and coffee with a bit of grain, leaves slightly bitter like dark chocolate.  Mouth is unbelievable, smooth and creamy the whole way. A definate pleasure to drink.  If this stuff wan't so expensive I would buy it all the time. At $3 for a pint bottle, it's better than just about every stout I've had on tap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,MobBarley,4.6,"Pours black as midnight with some auburn highlights. Luxurious milk-chocolate head that sticks around for good. The smell is creamy and chocolaty with an underlying alcohol aroma. The taste is sublime with an oatiness right out of the gate followed by a nice astringent alchohol and bitter hop note. The finish is absolute creamy chocolate bar supreme. Mouthfeel is big and creamy and envelopes the whole palate with its broad range of texture and flavor. Drinkability is good but the sweetness becomes a little too pronounced upon warming. Fantastic stout, this is, and a true rival to the Rogue Choco-Stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GDMFSOB,4,"This beer's got more chocolately goodness than a bag of Hershey's Kisses. The head is the same off-white, creamy head you get from a Guinness or any other nitro can, but the color is definitely a few shades darker. The nose, taste and aftertaste are all dark, rich chocolate, with some espresso and faint alcohol accents. The mouthful is rich and creamy, and the lack of carbonation makes this stuff go down like a warm glass of milk. A tasty alternative to Guinness Draught.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,NYbeerwolf,4.8,"The apperance of motor oil, nice and dark. Head was a light tan color that faded slowly. Smell was of chocolate, malt and coffee.

Good rich chocolate smell that over powers everything else. Taste as expected, like drinking a chocolate covered cherry. More alcohol on aftertaste then I might have expected. It's real clean on the tongue. Leaves the mouth quickly. I expected it to hang around longer. All and all a real treat.

I'm not a huge stout fan, so maybe I need to try a few more in line with this beer. I have had a few other chocolate stouts and enjoyed them more than this one. It poured with a nice head and very nice lacing alnog the sides of the glass. Smells of deep dark chocolate. The carbonation ruined it for me though. Way too much for my taste. It was still good, but I'm used to the smoother ones. This one was rich and creamy, but the fizz was a bit too much for me. I also drank it a bit too cold I think. Just took it out of the fridge and drank it. Maybe I will try this one on tap if I can find it and re-rate.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The flavor is full bodied, as roasted malt is nicely balanced with a strong sweet chocolate tone. Coffee and a very mild hint of bitterness rounds out the flavor.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy at the start and ends smoothly. Feels like your tongue is coated thickly and the chocolate flavors last long into the aftertaste. Extremely drinkable and would go great with a nice chocolate dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,99bottles,4.23,"Apperance: From a nitro can into a pint glass, this is a sexy beer complete with cascading nitro fizz that settles into a pefectly tight white head with a perfectly rich black body. Guinness-esque.  Smell: This beer has a very round stout smell to it comprised of mostly roasted barley, with some nice hints of chocolate and cocoa.  Taste: Again, awsome stout flavor. Very smooth and rich, very sweet and unassuming. This drink as easily as Guinness, and has some more flavor to boot. The chocolate is there as is the tastes of coffee and roasted grain, even some faint burnt flavor. The finish is slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, very creamy. The nitro can does a great job recreating the pour of a nitro-tap.  Drinkability: Very easy to sip, very satisfying, not so unique that the flavor would slow you down after a few.

It is slightly sweet and noticeably bitter. The big malt from the nose eases up at the taste but is still prominent.  Mouthfeel  This one is almost medium-bodied but doesnt quite make it. The lasting bitter character though makes it seem a little bigger than it is.

Maybe nitro cans are gimmicky, but I think this puts on a good show which results in a great looking beer!  Smell was of roasted malt with chocolate. Taste was more of the same, roasted, almost burnt grain with smooth chocolate notes. A pleasant amount of sweetness is present with just a hint of bitterness.  Very smooth mouthfeel and moderately thick body which blends well with the creamy head as you drink. Just a bit of carbonation is apparent.

Tastes dark chocolate, dark chocolate and dark chocolate. This really is like a chocolate cake in itself, sweet, a bit bitter, long lasting and delicious.  This is a heavenly delicious beer, but sadly for me too heavy. First time i drank it i could barely finish the bottle, the second time 2 bottlees managed to sweep through. The drinkability is really 5 but since i think its to heavy it gets a 3,5.  This is perfect to any desert that's based on chocolate, to a chocolate cake or just as a desert itself.

Smell is a little weaker than I'm used to from a stout but nice aromas. Consists of dark chocoate,malt, coffee & hops. Taste is, of course, dark chocolate (my favorite),roasted malt, coffee, hops and a hint of alcohol late. Good balance. Mouthfeel is weaker than might be expected from a good English stout and the amount of carbonation is a bit higher. Have to say this is a light-bodied beer considering the style. If it were a bit chewier, more meaty, I would rate it much higher. Quite a creamy feel in the mouth though. It's a fairly smooth drinking beer, one I've had repeatedly and will have again in the future. The chocolate is much more noticeable than in other stouts & I really like that. Also, the coffee is not so heavy as in others and I like that too. A really well balanced beer.

664,73,RedwoodGeorge,4.07,"I've been drinking quite a few sweet stouts lately and was very excited to find some large (500 ml) bottles at Trader Joe's. After experiencing this unusual stout I'd say it was well worth the wait.  The pour was pretty much like any other stout - dark red / nearly black with a minimal tan head. The carbonation level was reasonably low which left little head or lacing on the glass.  The smell was certainly interesting and inviting. There were the typical roasted malt notes of a stout with additional hints of coffee. While very faint, there were notes of hops and yeast as well, creating a well-rounded nose.  The taste was interesting, though not the 'wow' that I expected. Major notes of coffee and malt with only a hint of chocolate. This a a pretty dry 'sweet' stout so it leaves a nice clean palate with a subtle hint of hops. As the glass warmed to the room, the flavors changed considerably and much to the improvement of the drink. Where there was once only bitter coffee notes were now complex dark chocolate notes with an unmistakable hint of vanilla. Young's manages to pull off a very delicate balance - this still tastes like a stout. They could easily have gone overboard and ended up with chocolate pudding but instead we have a very nice drinkable beer.  While this is a nice tasting brew, I can't imagine having one very frequently. It's a bit of a novelty act - chocolate flavored beer - and it pushes the boundaries just a bit far to be something I'd want to drink on a regular basis. Being the confirmed chocolate addict, I'll certainly keep one around for those rare moments where a chocolate stout would compliment a meal.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Black as night with a head a solid tan color with a silky smooth texture to it and a a razor sharp edge between the head and body that I've never seen in a beer before. Hard to tell how much carbonation but the head is thick and has great retention, lace is pretty decent as well. The smell is very close to chocolate milk mixed with bailey's cream, very sweet and mellow. A faint hint of hazelnut. Taste very chocolaty yet the hops aren't faint at all, the aftertaste is of burnt chocolate beans, hazelnut and very subtle vanilla. This beer is a delight to drink, or maybe I should say eat, as the head as well as the body has a firmness and fullness to it probably thanks to the nitro. This is a beer you can drink all night, you wont get tired of it and you wont get drunk easily thanks to the low alcohol%. I had heard great things about the Young brewery and my expectations were definitely fulfilled with this fine brew.  -Oelergud",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,CortexBomb,3.78,"Pours out just like one would expect a stout to, pitch black with a tan head on top. Smell is strongly malty with a definite chocolate tinge hanging around as well.  Taste is a softly sweet and creamy chocolate with a lingering, yet not over the top hop bitter. Not quite as depthy as I like my stouts, but still quality. Like most stouts it gains more character as it warms, so I would suggest letting it acclimate from fridge temperature for a skosh before partaking heavily.  Mouthfeel, well, lighter than I prefer for a stout, but it has some thickness going for it so I can't knock it down too far. The drinkability on this one is quite good as well.  For the price this stout is pretty impressive though it definitely falls short of other Milk stouts like the Bell's line (Kazoo & Double Cream) and Mackeson.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,fdrich29,3.96,"14.9 fl. oz nitro can ""Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout Draught"".  Poured into a glass this stout has no equal in the appearance department. Pitch black body with a smooth, clean tan head. It almost looked too good to drink (almost being the operative word there).  Smells like Ma's kitchen when she's making chocolate cake. Tastes like a light fudge. After a few sips the heads still there, looking as good as new.  The head tingles the lips when it passes and chocolate goodness fills the mouth (half way done and the head is still hanging on).  A very nice treat of a beer. Not something I'm going to go out and buy on a regular basis though. Actually my non-beer appreciating girl friend brought home a 4 pack of these beers one night because she thought chocoate beer might be nice. She had one and really liked it. She likes Youngs, she likes me...what can I say? The girl has good taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Juggernaut,3.9,"Poured a deep dark brown color with a rich foamy head, and was full of wonderful smells of carmel, chocolate, and coffee.  The taste was very good, a little bitter at first but subsided into a slite chocolate/cocoa taste, all while still holding a creamy malty stout taste.  Very good, one I would definitely recommend and will be getting again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,taez555,3.88,"This beer poured a thick foamy tan head with a black body.  The nose was sweet with some bark, wood, chicory, chocolate earthy coffee smells.  The taste was medium bodied. A very sour chocolate milk taste at first. Sort of like sour chocolate milk or warm milk. Basically a very creamy taste. It actually starts sort of like a milk shake. Chocolate and creamy, then after a LONG pause it hits with a bitter, coffee, chicory overtone. Really quite interesting and bizarre at the same time.  Quite an interesting brew. An alcoholic chocolate milk with stout overtones. Bizarre but yummy at the same time.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,baiser,3.93,"Poured a dark, dark brown, with a foamy tan head. The head resided faster than expected. Left a small ring of lacing around the glass.  Smelled of sweet caramel, roasted coffee beans and slight chocolate aroma.  Taste was very nice. At first, the taste is quite bitter, almost like something was burnt. Then a slight chocolatey sweetness comes through. This beer is very smooth, full bodied and best savoured as an dessert drink.  One complaint was that the carbonation was a bit much. Made this stout a little less creamy than it could've been. But overall, very finely crafted.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mntlover,4.38,Pours a midnight black with a big fluffy brown head that falls to a finger size cap that leavves a light lacing down my glass. Aroma is roasted malt some coffee aromas and chocolate of course along with some citrus from the hops. Taste is great and stouty roasted malts lightly sweet with a touch of chocolate and lightly bitter coffee flavor and a dose of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is great smooth and creamy as it rolls around your mouth like drinking velvet. Drinkability is wonderful just a touch of chocolate to complement an already wonderful stout unlike another chocolate stout that seemed to be all chocolate. I would highly recommend this stout could drink these all night.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Not at all as sweet as I expected, very complex with lots of different chocolate flavors (dark, milk), a little bit of coffee and a nice hoppy finish. No fruityness or figgyness which is a good thing. Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Creamy mouthcoating mouthfeel with tingly but restrained carbonation. Absolutely delicious chocolatey finish that lasts a while. This beer was way better than I expected. Very rich.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tjd25,3.83,"Very fluffy and silky head; it seemed to fade quickly at first, but a finger of head remained on the beer for the time I had it in the glass. Quite impressive. The body is of an intense dark brown color.  The smell shows sweet notes of chocolate and cream, but citrus and straw also appeared together with a liquor aroma.  The chocolate flavor was not as developed as I expected. Sure, it tasted like chocolate, but with very sweet citric notes, hints of wood close to tartness, and light hints of cherries and flowers.  The mouthfeel was smooth and extremely creamy, rather rich than thick, quite enjoyable. Slightly floury, nicely warming. The label says it all: ""silky, rich, creamy and smooth"".

Dark chocolate again in the front, of course, but some nice surprising fruit, too. It persists through the full, thick, milky middle. Finish is light, fresh cocoa. Excellent. This is proof that you should revisit the classics from time to time. I remembered this beer as pure sweet chocolate... a little too sweet for me. But this time it was just right.

664,73,wyllder,4.11,"Had this on-tap at the Moan & Dove, Amherst MA.  Is there any way to improve on the appearance here? Like a Guinness, it pours an opaque chocolate brown bordering on black. The head is big, thick, creamy and absolute delight to siphon off before getting to the real stuff below.  Smell is heady, with hints of coffee and caramel. But this beer isn't about hints, it's about chocolate and that's here in plenty.  The taste.. Here I'll have to say I had several beers before this, including Arrogant Bastard and Hopdevil so my experience is tainted. What I tasted began as a creamy-smooth stout with hints of alcohol & hops and a backbone of sweet chocolate malt. By midway through the glass it was all chocolate. The aftertaste reminded me of a dark chocolate yogurt, the bitterness of the chocolate balanced against the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel was wonderful, in a smooth & creamy sort of way.  Highly drinkable, provided you like chocolate.  Damn good stuff.  Wyll-",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The smell is a little malty, not much else I can detect.  Very smooth with a burnt coffee flavor. I'm not catching much else but maybe as it warms up. Yup, as it warms up, more of the chocolate flavor comes out in the smell and taste. Very nice.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. No serious hop bite.  This is a highly drinkable beer.

Nose is intial muted, but allowing to to warm in the glass the wonderful aromas of dark melted chocolate with hints of cherries filled the room. Beautiful stuff, that was intense without being over the top.  Flavours were more of roasted, dark malts with the chocolate only peering thru. However, after waiting 30 secs the aftertaste was that of having eaten some deep strong chocolate.  The palate didn't live up to the aromas, yet it was still a classy drop from start to finish, and went well with desert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WetCoaster,4.09,"Appearance: Pours a pure black; takes strong backlighting to bring out the true color, a very deep garnet. Good finger of thick rocky, tan head. Excellent head retention. Thin lacing. Carbonation not visible, very mild.  Smell: Apple yeast esters at first. These are soon overwhelmed by a wonderful aroma of dark chocolate, dark fruit, roasted malts, and hints of vanilla. Terrific.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Immediate surge of unsweetened chocolate and sweet malts. Bitterness comes in to finish, biting and a bit smoky. It's fairly straightforward, but quite tasty. The mouthfeel is thin, but the carbonation is controlled, giving it fairly smooth texture overall.  Drinkability: It's pretty light and certainly tasty, but the strong chocolate flavor would make it tough for me to drink too many--it's dessert.  A fun, nice beer. Not the richest or most complex stout you'll run across, but it's one almost anyone can enjoy. I liked it a lot.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Bit of coffee in there too.  Lives up to the name. Quite a load of chocolate malt up front that starts off a little bitter then rolls over and gets quite sweet. Licorice and anise in the background. Nice burnt malt ending with that wonderful stout glow that just kind of lingers like cigar smoke.  Nice and full with a slightly dryer feel than a lot of stouts.  Highly drinkable.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Hunter,4.05,"Nice label, classy and simple, colored in rich purple. Expiration dating on back label with the government warnings.  Head pours thick and fast in the pour, sitting a dark brown atop a black, black beer. You won't need to agitate the brew to bring the head back - it's not going anywhere but your lips. Lacing is thick and tenacious. Only the strongest backlight reveals any sort of color, and even then its a dark brown-red. Lovely, mysterious, and thick.  The chocolate is in the nose, to be sure. Smells of pure, bitter chocolate and barley. The malt is there, lurking behind the chocolate. The aroma is inviting and promises a good payoff in the taste.  And Lord, it doesn't disappoint. Big mouthful of bitter chocolate supported by the sweet malt beneath. Mouthfeel is thick, smooth and silky, and finishes in a tight bittersweet kiss of smoky chocolate. This one lives up to its name. You'll almost want to pour this into a brandy snifter and sip it by the fire on cold nights. This is not something to drink every night, but when you want something dark, rich, and extravagant, you'd do well to try this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DPMomutant,4.1,"From a $2.99 500ml bottle. Best by Feb 2005 notched on the back label, I like that.  Medium-sized head shows up late in the pour. Turns out creamy. Looks like a bit of retention and lacing here. Body is as pitch black as the beer gods say a stout should be.  Smell is subtle. A big whiff catches mostly roasted malt balanced by cocoa. A bit of fruit catches me at the end of it.  The taste is a nice combination of coffee and very fresh chocolate. The chocolate really stands out in the aftertaste. Not too sweet or too dark.  The mouthfeel is a surprising bit of carbonation at the very beginning. Kind of forces you to move the beer around the palate to capture that flavor. Finish is not as smooth as others but helps bring out the aftertaste. Almost like it was done on purpose. By no means harsh though.  This is probably best as a dessert beer but it isn't too extreme that it can't be drank in a session. A bit on the expensive side, though. Then again, it's about the price of a Bud in a bar so this isn't such a bad home beer.  Try it, you'll like it.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ChrisBowers,3.83,"Sampled on tap at Nathans in Washington DC. Poured a classic nitro stout black with white creamy head. Smelled a tad sour, I am wondering if this maybe had been around for awhile. Taste was good... sweet, chocolatey with a touch of maybe hazelnut.

Overall, this is an easy to drink stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,HardTarget,4.15,"Aroma: Chocolate covered hops. Appearance: Black as tar, thick lasting nitro induced suede head that left traces of lace. Flavor: A great stout that has chocolate in the middle and end. A bit heavy on the chocolate, it really drowns out the rest of the beer, but I dont mind a bit. Too much chocolate to me is like saying its too good. Mouthfeel: Wonderfully creamy and medium-heavy body Overall Impression: Only thing that slows down drinkability is the weight of the beer. It is filling and satisfying. I went to the fridge asking Dessert or beer? I had both with this gem. Try, and share.

When poured into an imperial pint glass, the body is deep brown in color and borders on the verge of being completely black, but indicates chocolate colored highlights when held up against the light. Other than the highlights at the edges, not much passes through the dense liquid. The head is a towering layer of foam, at least two inches thick initially, and has the color of a chocolate milk shake. After it dies down, it leaves a rich brown lace around the glass. The aroma is pretty mild, and the chocolate smell is clearly present, but does not overpower the other roasty aromas. Taste is sweet, but not cloyingly so. The chocolate is supplemented by flavors of raisin, rum, and dark roasted coffee. The aftertaste is dry, and has a bit of bitterness to it. The beer is a bit thin on the palette for a stout and has an earthy to chalky mouthfeel.

664,73,psyco1,4.45,"It poured a foamy tannish-black from the nitro that settled into a nice black with a 1 inch tan head.  The smell was first of the roasted malts then a big chunk of alcohol covered chocolate hit me in the nose. wow  The taste was chocolate, then chocolate then some more chocolate. Almost like a beginning, middle and end....only the end had a bit of roasted malt flavor peeking in too. Then there was a chocolate aftertaste.

The aroma is actually quite excellent, smelling malty and a little chocolatey. The taste doesn't quite live up to the beer's billing, though, because it seems a bit too sweet and the alcohol taste is not covered up by the malt. A bit more effort with the malt and this could be an excellent beer; however, it is still a relatively good beer and comes recommended to stout fans.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,IceAce,4.25,"Appearance: An agressive pour into a beer-clean .5 liter glass resulted in one finger of a tan, creamy collar of foam. The nitro bloom lasted less than one minute and revealed an opaque black glass of brew. This beer is so dark that there is no hint of color, even at the bottom of the glass.  Aroma: The nose is dominated by the same smell as that of unrefined cocoa with a nice malty undertone.Although the aroma is a tad understated...it invites one to want to dive right in.  Taste: No doubt that the chocolate malt dominates...but not in a sweet chocolate way. The taste fulfills the promise of the nose;cocoa...and lots of it in a very good way. This beer serves notice that chocolate does belong in a beer when in the hands of a very competant brewer.  Mouthfeel: Rich, robust, and dare I say...luxurious. Smooth, complex, and a very nice pleasant mouthfeel.  Drinkability: It is hard to project just how this outstanding brew would play over the course of four or five...but I am willing to give it a shot!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeefyMee,4.02,"Appearance: Good but not overly impressive. Looks pure black at first glance. It's actually slightly transparent. Head was nice but short-lived.  Smell: Huge chocolate aroma. The label says dark chocolate is used but it smells like a milkier chocolate.  Taste: The chocolate hits first in a great way. Then, there was sort of a cheap beer and slight alcohol flavor that was not so pleasing. This didn't last long however, as the aftertaste kicks in in all of its chocolatey glory.  Mouthfeel: Disappointing here. Feels thin and kind of watery with agressive carbonation that does not serve the beer well. This one would be twice as good if there was a vast improvement in this area.  Drinikability: If I kept drinking these, I might eventually get sick of the chocolate, but I would probably be delirious by that point. I would also have a significantly lighter wallet.  Beef Notes: A great beer and one I would love to find on tap. This is the third most chocolatey beer I've ever had behind Rogue CS and SACB. I've had it in the can and the bottle seems to be better. I'm sure I'll be drinking it again sometime.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The nose is mostly cocoa. The taste is mellower than the nose. Very smooth and drinkable. Somewhat bitter finish. This is a fine tasting beer.

664,73,jazzyjake,3.91,"Young's Double Chocolate Stout (DCS) has a very nice pour from the can - with the inverse bubbling that fascinates me! It has a deep brown color that is nearly opaque and a nice tan head that persists through the entire glass. The foam is nicely creamy and adheres well to the glass. Use a nice wide glass to get your nose into the experience.  On the intake it has a pleasing palate-drenching quality with a taste reminiscent of Kahlua. The beer is deeply malted without the burned taste for which I criticize most American stouts. The carbonation is not oppresive and it goes down easily. The aftertaste, however, got increasingly (and not pleasantly) bitter the more I drank and eventually overpowered the initial complexity of the malts. Too much hops? I downgraded both the taste and drinkability because of this attribute.  This is a beer I like, but would only drink one of, preferably the last beer of the evening. Drinking more than one accentuated the bitterness and lost the sweet maltiness that I initially enjoyed.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Taste is quite similar to the smell, nice rich chocolate with just enough bitter to keep it balanced. The chocolate definately comes out more as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is good as carbonation is low, and this helps the creamy chocolate flavour come through. While its a tasty treat I dont think I would have more than one in a night.

664,73,Dmann,3.72,This one did not impress me as much in the bottle as it did on tap. The beer poured a usual stout black with fizzy brown head that faded quickly into nothingness. The smell was much weaker than the tap version I had but still had hints of chocolate and coffee. The taste is what really suffered though. The chocolate flavors and the roastiness were still there but were quite subdued compaired to the tap version. Maybe I just got a bum bottle?

Aroma is very malty with rusty crystal malt tones lifting almond, brown chocolate (nutella?), and vanilla flavours. It's actually unpleasant to me when fresh, but at room temperature, it gets tolerable although definitely not a beer I particularly enjoy. It's very sweet, nutty and with honest chocolate milk peaks, but rather tart and cloying with metallic astringency. Pretty thin bodied although quite creamy and smooth.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,avylover,3.68,"Dark beer, nearly black with some brownish/ruby highlights. The aroma is mainly of some bitter chocolate and some rather unexpected hoppiness. Perhaps I need to let this warm up a bit. The taste...although this is a stout, quite honestly it taste like Bass pale ale with some chocolate thrown in. Same creamy vanilla flavor, light hops, but with milk chocolate in the finish. Ice cold at this point, i'll be back when it warms a bit...  warmed up a bit...The chocolate is more pronounced and sweet. Also some black currant type flavors showing up. Noticeable buttery diacetyl taste here. This is somewhat complex once warmed up, but still tastes alot like a beefed up Bass ale. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with tiny bubble carbonation. Medium bodied. Drinkablity suffers from the heavy diacetyl flavors, but still quick drinkable.

It reminded me of a Polish liqueur whose name I cannot recall. Began with a ""D'.  The chocolate taste came over the top and finished like coffee. Finish was malty to say the least.  Even as a dessert brew I'd find this drinkable only within the category. Just personal preference I guess.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Naerhu,4.53,"As opaque as my refried black beans, with an esprosso crema like head.  Rich, thick chocolate aroma.  Thick chocolate souffle flavor. This is the most chocolately brew I have ever had. Very low in bitterness, however that low bitteness has length. Very low in sweetness for the style.  Big broad creamy mouthfeel.  500ml gone in 15 minutes with nothing to show for it. No wonder they do not brew smaller sizes, I cannot imagine how fast 330 ml would disappear.

Very light carbonation remaining to give the flavor a little pop, but it's very understated.  Overall: Good after-dinner beer, very dessert-like with the chocolate tones.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Edwin,4.25,"Served in bottle at Epic Bar & Grill.  Appearance - Nice and dark black with a tannish head. An excellent looking brew.  Smell - This is another one of those Stouts that make me hungry. A chocolate blast initially mixed in with some roasted notes and some coffee and nuts mixed throughout.  Taste - An awesome mix! Obviously, the chocolate comes out full throttle, but not in a way that you feel like you're drinking a Hershey Bar. Very good balanced taste. Some nutty tones really help this out as well. A tad of coffee and roasted malts come through as well.  Mouthfeel - VERY smooth going down. Not an unwelcome visitor on the tongue. Perfect amount of carbonation.

Very malty, but there is some hop bitterness lest you despair. When this beer warms it is truly amazing, if you don't let it, it is truly unremarkable. It has a dark/semisweet chocolate taste and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Goes excellent with chocolate cake, and with creamy milkchocolate. Always a shame when the last sip is consumed. The only drawback is that the drinkibility is low, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  --Joey",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,watermelonman,4.28,"This poured to a great darkness along with a nice head that lasted throughout the bottle and left a nice mild lace.  The chocolate overtones of this great stout are present but not at all overwhelming. The beer is very well balanced considering how much flavor is in this bottle. It feels great in the mouth, coating like a candy bar. It's a bit dense, but it remains drinkable.  This beer is an excellent way to cap off any good night.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BrewMan82,3.4,"Pours like coffee and cream! Cafe color fills the glass, then settles out slowly and beautifully in waves of white and tan to a pure black with a thick white head. It looks like a chocolate shake with whip cream! It does smell slightly of chocolate, but I found the smell to be masked by the intense thickness of the head. Initial taste is quite flat and slightly thin, with pronounced bitterness. It is silky smooth and creamy however, and the bitterness is balanced and slowly melted away by a strong milk and dark chocolate aftertaste. I did not detect any alcohol taste. The mouthfeel was severely damaged by the thinness and lack of carbonation. Is this the nitro coming through? The head did stay intact at about 3/4"" till the bottom of the glass. Overall it was ok - nice dessert drink but I will probably not try it again anytime soon.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Beaver13,3.72,"The Double Chocolate Stout pours an opaque midnight black with a fizzy brown head that quickly dissipated to a collar and completely disappeared before I finished.  The aroma is kind of yeasty initially settling into malts and a big sweet dark chocolate smell with some vanilla notes.  It has a smooth creamy mouthfeel. The taste is dominated by chocolate. There is a slight metallic bitterness, but the sweetness definitely overwhelms it. A little too out of whack on the sweet side...I would have preferred a little more hops for better balance.  Overall, I think this would make a terrific dessert drink. It's probably not something I'd drink a lot of or frequently though.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,filabrazilia,3.58,"Pours a nearly pitch black with a creamy brown head. The lace clings to the glass like curtains. A nice looking beer.  The aroma is rich and malty with a pronounced dark chocolate presence. It's like unwrapping a big dark chocolate candy. It's a shame I'm not as fond of dark chocolate as I am of milk. However, it is pretty nice.  The taste is like biting into a dark chocolate candy bar--strong, bitter and very definitely chocolate. This flavor seems to dominate the taste and isn't as balances as I would have liked.  This is a creamy smooth beer that is pleasant to consume. The texture is rich and full and is something like a dessert beer. A complex range of textures bathe the mouth in delightful beer goodness.  Despite the dark chocolate assault on the senses, this is a decent beer that I would try again.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,SeanChouffe,4.7,"A rich dark brown/black color with a light brown rocky head. Clingy lace and little sign of CO2 (due to opaqueness). Aroma is malty, chocolaty, roasted grains and coffee. Background is very earthy. Flavor is creamy and sweet, a roasty full flavored middle with a smooth hop finish. A light hop bite lingers, but is not overpowering. Mouthfeel is full bodied creamy and smooth.  IMHO: A great, thick full flavored stout. Well balanced and easy to drink.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Winter,3.99,"Pours black in color with a creamy tan head that lingers throughout consumption. Aroma started off vinous, then became that of sweet chocolate, roasted malt and powdered cocoa. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, smooth and creamy. Sweet chocolate front turns dark chocolate in flavor as the hop bitterness arrives midway through. Along with the bitterness comes a dryness that lingers into the start of the finish. The finish turn sweet again with flavors of chocolate milk.  Probably one of the best chocolate beers out there. I'd take this over Rogue's Chocolate. Great dessert beer that pairs naturally with chocolate desserts or a fine treat all by itself.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

I could not detect much aroma on this beer, just subtle notes of chocolate. Once you dive in and taste this beer the chocolate smacks you in the face. This is basically a chocolate milkshake in the guise of a stout. The taste definitely lends to this beer being consumed as a dessert. The mouthfeel is typical of a nitro beer: smooth and creamy. Drinkability is lacking as I would not want to have more than one of these in a night. I'd like to call this a niche stout, it serves it's purpose well when looking for chocolate and it is interesting, just not one of my favorites.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,PatandDavid,3.88,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this one before! I always have it a couple of times a year at least, as it is such a treat. Anway, dark and opaque when poured, the overflowing head quickly dissipated. I thought the aroma was more coffee-like. Basically I find the taste to be smooth, and reminiscent of a tootsie roll, although one made with darker chocolate. A wonderful treat that chocolate lovers should enjoy. Good stuff.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,KingSlender,3.73,Youngs Double Chocolate pours a dark brown to almost black color. A distinct chocolaty malt aroma extends from the freshly poured brew and the head stand tall and thick with a nice tan color. This is a very good stout with a strong malt presence. The consistancy is not too thick as the head would suggest. This stout is very easy to drink and goes down smooth as silk. I like the very apparent chocolate tones in this beer and would compare this to some of the better stouts that I've tried throughout the years.  The King recommends drinking this beer with a salisbury steak (extra gravy).,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,UnionMade,3.58,"The beer is a deep reddish brown, pretty much black, topped with a creamy, ivory colored nitro foam. Typical nitro head retention, hardly dimishing at all, leaving rings of belgian lace all the way down the glass. The beer itself is clear, shining a burgundy red when backlit. The aroma is dominated by roasted malts and a milky chocolate scent. The malt is strongly chocolatey, as well, adding to the experience. A bit of coffee and toffee, with mild estery fruit. Hints of pear and plum blend with a faint undercurrent of herbal hops, my guess is goldings. The flavor is surprisingly rich for a nitro pour, sweet, smooth chocolate bears throughout, with a distinct milky chocolate flavor, reminiscent of Cadbury's. Light coffee roastiness, with a bit of toffee sweetness, add to the flavor. A touch of plm fruitiness seeps through the middle, sort of like that Cadbury's chocolate with the fruits and nuts in it. The finish is moslty a bittersweet roasty malt, softened some with the mildly lactic chocolate. A touch of tinny nitro flavor adds a light astringency. Not much in the way of hops. Lingering chocolate in the aftertaste. Prickly nitro carbonation, deadening the flavor a bit, from what I remember of the bottle. Medium bodied, with a silky, creamy mouthfeel. An extremely easy drinking stout. I'd recommend this for anyone that's a novice to to the style, as the chocolate and nitro softens up the roasted bittersweetness considerably. Not something I'd want every day, but it's worth a pint when available.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,RasputinsRevenge,3.98,"Found this at a very reasonable price ($4.99 for the 4-pack of cans) at the local beer store and decided to give it a shot. I think I had one on a previous occasion at the Flying Saucer in Addison, TX, but couldn't recall whether I liked it or not.  I enjoy all types of stouts/porters/etc, but there is something that especially draws me to the ones offered in a nitro can.  I really don't have anything too negative to say about this beer, it looks great and smells good. The only reason I gave it a slightly lower rating for taste is because the chocolate taste seemed a little too ""rich"" at first. Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it's over-powering or ""bad"" at all.  It's probably not something that I'd have more than one of in a row, but I'd say that if you like the style, you will probably enjoy this.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JimsArcade,4.3,"The classic nitrogen cascade forms in the pint glass leaving a one-finger thick head. As it pours from the can, I am surprised at how translucent it is: it looks exactly like brown bottle glass. Once it fills the glass, though, it's practically pitch-black. When swirled, the head never sticks to the glass.  The first sniff is overwhelmingly bitter dark chocolate with a backbone of chocolate malt. It smells as creamy as it looks. Bringing the aroma into the mouth, it is like I am about to drink some chocolate milk. I feel like a kid about to get a treat.  As I take my first sip, the creaminess and smoothness are even better than its appearance and aroma suggest, which is saying something. Hops are noticeable but subdued. Chocolate malt takes the forefront in the initial sips. I am reminded a little of Kahlua when I swirl it in the mouth: there is definitely a hint of sweet coffee in the mix. Mid bottle, as it warms, chocolate flavors become more pronounced, but not sweeter: it's somewhere between unsweetened cocoa and German chocolate cake. The beer finishes just as creamy as it started.  Of all the nitrogen-delivered stouts I have had, Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout ranks at the top. It's an amazing brew from start to finish that just pleases so many senses. (I highly recommend pairing this with chocolate: the beer takes on a wonderful new complexion when paired with it.)",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,RocketWidget,4.23,"A fine showing from Young's. Pours a dark black with some reddish elemnts if held up to the light. Moderate to mild off-white head. Smell is ok, nothing especially worth noting. But taste is quite good! Malty and sweet, I taste hops, sugar, dark chocolate, and coffee flavors. Good carbonation. The mouthfeel lets you know that they really used alot of dark chocolate in there, as my mouth feels like I have just eaten a really dry dark chocolate bar after swallowing. What seems like cocoa particles resides in my mouth. Very tasty and very drinkable, an excellent chocolate stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Smell: Smell doesn't have that flavor of chocolate like one would expect with a DOUBLE chocolate, but aroma isn't a big thing with me.  Taste: Taste is more of a mocha cofee taste that anything chocolate. I find it great however as this is my favorite and my wifes favorite.

Never before has the word ""Double"" lived up to its fullest capacity as on this brew's moniker. Call it Triple Chocolate next time, Young's marketing dept. Jeese! On with the review...  Appearance wise, ""Hey, barkeep! I didn't order a Guiness...did I?"" Yupper. Looks like that marbled, rolling, eye candy pour. Must be a Nitro. Don't Nitros just have the coolest look? After seven years in the restaurant biz, I always say, ""If it looks good, it BETTER taste good."" Yes, it does.  Not too high of marks on the aromatic scale, but that's fine. I wasn't drinking this baby with a straw up my schnozola. Capiche? Smelled pleasantly creamy.  Here is the dumbest review entry I have ever written. Ah-hem - It tasted superflously chocolately. But let's go one step beyond. Smooth, velvety, sweet, rich dark chocolately, chocolate. Easy drinkin'. Here is my rub. Ever notice with these niche flavored brews (i.e. Pumpkin Stoudts) that the intensely hot flavor disapates 3/4's of the way thru. Boo hoo. The low carbonation style drinkability was delightful. I had zero lace, but this was a bre-pub. Dirty glass?  I reccomend Brooklyn Chocolate. It also has a cocoa-kick, just in time for Valentine's Day, too.  Beer is good. Happy brewing.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CBFanWish,4,A fantastic stout. Everything a good stout should be. Almost black in colour with a thick frothy tan head. It had a strong chocolate aroma with a slight coffee scent. The taste reminded me of Ben and Jerry's Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz. It was a fantastic coffee flavor with strong chocolate tones.

A complex mix of roasted coffee and more chocolate seem to be the backbone, but some fine English hops bitterness never let this become overly sweet.

My fridge is too cold to keep beer as I barely smell or taste much at first, and the body seems rather thin for a stout. Crystal and dark malts sneak up on my palate only after a swallow.

The mouthfeel was very light and lacked body & richness. As for being a ""double chocolate stout"" i would say that Rogue and Storm King live up to that name sake more so than this beer. The drinkability is poor b/c if i want a stout, i don't really want something this light and easy drinking.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Additionally, I detected nearly no malt or hop. In the taste department, CHOCOLATE and lots of it. Also present: caramel (as in candy, not the malt). Nice hop finish resulting in a wonderfully balanced beer.  This is a thick and rich beer.

664,73,jahred,3.51,"Had this beer for ""dessert"" after another beer, hoping that it would finish off the evening nicely ...  Pours dark black, with a medium brownish head that seems quite bubbly.  The scent? Maybe it was this bottle? This batch?I didn't get much of a scent. There was a slight, sweet malt scent, but not much else. Disappointing, definitely.  The taste? Like a creamy, malty milkshake in the back. Up front, not much. There's a sweet, lingering malt aftertaste that sticks around as well. As I keep sipping, there's more vanilla than chocolate. Maybe it's a vanilla-chocolate milkshake? Maybe cream soda? And the aftertaste gets a bit hoppy, with metallic notes as well.  The Double Chocolate Stout is certainly easy to drink, but it was not as thick and balanced as I'd hoped - and I didn't really detect much chocolate. As a dessert beer it was interesting, but overall a bit too sweet as well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Shiloh,3.75,"Very interesting product, has a quality all of its own found in the taste as well as the nose. Black as coal with a thick tan ring and thin island lace. Full bodied with, I believe to be a light carbonation. Nose is a combination of chocolate, coffee and nuts. The taste equalls the nose and is very smooth going down.

664,73,Dubblebock,4.2,"Man, this is one great beer. I picked up a couple of bottles at my local package store when I went to bring in a supply of some of my favorites. The pint and 9oz. bottle set me back $2.19. What an absolutely incredible investment. I enjoy good stouts to begin with, and the appeal of the added chocolate just made this a more tempting treat. Slight hop bitterness on the back end.  Pours well, with a half-inch head that doesn't hang around too long. Beautiful coloring, though. Dark and creamy looking, no light shining through at all when I hold it to the bulb. Nice nose, chocolatey and malty.  The first taste is a wonder. The malts really combine well with the chocolates. Very smooth character, carmel flavors abound. Gets a coffee-like taste to it as it warms a little. This is a rich beer, and I would not recommend slamming this one down, despite the fact that it's relatively low in ABV. This was great before a meal, but I would also recommend it as an after-dinner treat.  Good, hearty mouthfeel. This was almost a meal by itself. Very drinkable, despite it's richness. Not sure I'd make it a session beer, but I could drop a couple of bottles of this with no problem at all. Slowly though, taking the time to savor the experience.  Most excellent.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Smell: Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, surprisingly delicate in the nose.  Taste: Deeply roasted coffee, hints of chocolate, and a taste that I can only describe as something like Jose Cuervo tequila in the background. Nothing is too overpowering, all the tastes, while quite forceful, are very nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel: This has to be the smoothest beer I've ever had. Carbonation is next to impossible to detect, and for a beer with only 5.0% ABV, what alcohol there is really makes itself known. This beer packs quite a wallop in this category.  Drinkability: Not something I'd want to drink more than one of at a time, but a very nice offering nonetheless. I suppose if I were having a chocolatey dessert, this beer would match quite well, but sitting here drinking it and eating a piece of sharp cheddar cheese, it's not quite the same.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Beautiful beer, and that everlasting nitro-head is a pleasure to look at, but not as much so as to sip and get the incredibly creamy mouthfeel. Huge toffee in the aroma along with a good deal of cocoa and some mild hops. Roasted malt greets your taste buds, and of course the generous amounts of chocolate and toffee. A nice mild English bitterness complements these perfectly. Again, wonderfully thick and creamy mouthfeel. Light to medium body, but rich for an English beer.

I recently tried it on tap at the Yardhouse in Denver - and it is even better on tap than in the nitro-pack can. Especially in a tall ½ yard glass! Talk about a creamy, solid foam head - it never goes away! The massive clouds of foaming brew forms slowly as the soft brown cascades of carbonation struggle to the top. When the beer settles down, it is an opaque coffee brown  and the aroma contains coffee. And chocolate - with a hint of vanilla. But surprisingly the taste is more of a stout experience than sweet.

Chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts with a hint of vanilla and a nice hop bite. This tastes great!

The head retention is almost ridiculous: tons of lacing, and about a finger of head at the bottom of the glass after the beer.  Aroma: Obvious chocolate, toasted malt, a very slight hint of alcohol (far less noticeable than Brooklyn BCS), and some grainy sweetness.  Taste: Big, chewy roasted malt and chocolate flavors with some coffee bitterness and caramel sweetness in the nose. Just a little bit of hops. Dry finish with nice, lingering chocolate aftertaste. Chocolate flavor is never cloying or overpowering. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: Perfect. Very smooth, extremely creamy.  Drinkability: Neither a session beer nor a sipper, but it's easy to drink three or four of these without feeling the alcohol or any heaviness.

Head is a deep tan.  Smells of coffee, chocolate, hops. The smell is by far the best thing about this beer.  Taste: This is a good stout, just the right balance of smoothness and bitterness. My favorite part is the slight chocolate aftertaste, very pronounced and yet not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: this is just a smooth beer, it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Drinkabilty: This is where this beer kind of falters. It takes me a long time to drink one of these because of it's thickness.

It had a wonderful appearance and a nice smokey/roasted taste, followed by a truly delightful chocolaty aftertaste. But it was a bit thin in the mouthfeel department for me. I guess after some of the wonderful American micro brewed stouts I've tried, I'm just partial to a ""bigger"" beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Jables,4.42,"Pours pitch black with large dense tan head.  Smells of roasted malts and tootsie rolls.  Flavor is roasted malts, chocolate, a little alcohol, and chocolate again. The chocolate is not overpowering, but rather a silky smooth character that caresses the tongue and teases of rich chocolate cake.  The mouthfeel could be thicker but maybe the slick, smooth feel contributes to the amazing drinkability.  Fast becoming one of my favorite beers, I am looking to try this on nitro-tap.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mickeymac,3.63,"Poured from a classic brown Young's bottle with the purple label, it's very dark brown, almost black. The head was minimal at the beginning and gone after a few sips. The aroma is mostly chocolate with just a hint of ripe fruit. The taste is quite chocolatey but somewhat on the bland side: inoffensive but not outstanding in any way. The mouthfeel seemed slightly thin for a stout. If looking for a chocolate stout, I'd pick Rogue over this any day of the week.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,budsboy,3.98,"Black in color, almost opaque, big foamy tan head. Chocolate is first to the nose, slight fruit scent. Taste is wonderful, bittersweet chocolate and chocolate -- the lable doesn't lie -- but there is some complexity there. Great dessert. And sum-mooth, oh my. This is becoming a staple in my diet and the taste really grows on you. It's my comfort beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,beergeek279,4.13,"Served into the nonic pint glass at the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium. The color was black, with a nice nitro head. The smell was slightly sweet. The taste was a rich and fantastic sweet milk chocolate. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth. Drinkability-wise, could definitely have a few of these.  One of the best nitro stouts that I've ever had. A rich and delicious chocolate make this a real treat. Quite good, and certainly one that I'll have again!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kwalters,4.32,"This is one fantastic stout! I picked it up on a whim and enjoyed it as an after dinner drink. The chocolate is definately in there in a double dose, as the name suggests. The appearance, scent, and taste are all heavily influenced by chocolate. And as Martha would say, ""That's a good thing"".  I'd be very hesitant to call this strictly a desert beer, as it would go well with hearty meals too. It's very drinkable and will probably find a permanent home in my fridge.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GuinnessSmurf,4.35,"This is one of my favorite beers. As the title suggests, its a dark, warm chocolate malty beer. Pouring it into the glass, a tan/ brown head rises graciously to the top of the glass, leaving plenty of lacing as it generally runs down into the glass forming a dark black beer. At first taste, this beer might seem too sweet, especially for non-stout drinkers. However, the aftertaste has just the right balance of hops to make this otherwise 'all malt' flavor very drinkable. Although it is a very heavy beer, it is easy to down about three of these...especially since the ABV is pretty low.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ComradeCanadia,4.59,"I heard about chocolate stout when I first started coming to Beer Advocate, and immediately wanted to find it. Lo and behold, a liquor store near my place started carrying it not too long ago! This is my second review as I think I like this even more after consideration.  Appearance: Pours nice and BLACK, or at least so brown that I'm not telling no matter what light I hold it up to. Chocolatey head was smallish and vanished quickly, leaving... well nothing.  Smell: Lots of cocoa, hops, chocolate malts, that sort of thing. I could smell this stuff all day. This smells like a very fine dessert that's been dusted with unsugared cocoa.  Taste: I won't lie and say I've sampled a huge variety of fine beers, but as it stands, this is the best beer I've -ever- tasted. Wonderfully complex with a great cocoa flavour afterwards. Sort of like if you've powdered, unsugared cocoa over a dessert of some sort. Coffee is also very predominant, and a nice hoppy bite as well. Not too sweet at all, which was a fear of mine here. There's more to this beer, but I just don't know how to put names to all the flavours yet.  Mouthfeel: Not bad, not bad... needs a bit more carbonation, but no complaints. Pretty good. I expected this to be creamy like some stouts, and instead feels like a slightly heavy beer.  Drinkability: On a second review - I realize that I was unkind to the drinkability of this delicious brew. I could chug this all day... I was just far too full to drink one of these my first review. Oh god this is good.  Notes: My favorite beer period, and I'm sure there are tons of better beers out there, but I haven't tried them yet. Heh. This is an awesome beer to introduce to people who think that Budweiser is the be all and end all of beers, even people who hate beer love this stuff.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,CRJMellor,3.62,Pours a midnight black with light tan head. First thought with the aroma was mint chocolate chip ice cream in a glass. Further aroma noted was some light roasted coffee notes and touch of hop profile. First taste was milk chocolate with a little bit of roasted coffee taste. Definitely real chocolate in there. Mouthfeel is good but the chocolate somewhat detracts from the other flavors that are in there. Simply too sweet for my palate but I'm sure it is the classic example of this style.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mrpivo,5,"This is my absolutely favorite beer. Young's has done a fantastic job combining chocolate malt and real chocolate into this wonderful stout. The addition of chocolate doesn't make this stout overly sweet by any means. The nitro charge creates a dense milky brown head and creamy appearance to the stout upon initial pour. After the nitro bubbles in the stout settle out you're left with this magnificent head that remains throughout the glass. As it's drank the glass is coated with beautiful lace.  An additional note: I've had this in both bottle and can form and personally feel that this stout is better from the can. Not only do you get the nitro charge, but the taste out of the can is better.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mschofield,4.6,"We've all heard of milk stouts, well this is a chocolate milk stout. Dark brown-black with a light-brown three finger head. Laces very well in rings that web together. Very strong chocolate, milk and roasted aroma the taste is obviously chocolate, and it's also pretty sweet, and the roasted grain comes out here as well. Chocolate taste builds even more in the aftertaste. Very flavorful beer. Creamy, Smooth, and Rich feel. Incredibly drinkable, especially after a day of shoveling snow.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,dpend,3.85,Poured a deep black with a hint of light coming through here and there. Nice frothy head that held and laced well. Aroma was not released until the beer warmed a bit. I then could smell rich chocolate and roasted malts. Hops were present but barely detectable. Taste was roasted chocolate and coffee and a nice hop finish. Beer was a lot thinner than I had imagined. This is very drinkable stout and not as intimidating as one might think.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ALEBOY,4.5,"What a beer! Would go down as one of my alltime favourite stouts! This beer was so good that as soon as we finished it we went back to the shop and bought two more. Beautiful tan head on top of a richly coloured dark beer. Big bitterchoc / mocha aroma. Flavour like the finest bitterchocolate around, very rich and creamy. Highly Drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BuckeyeNation,3.93,"Semisweet chocolate brown with ruby highlights, topped off with a medium tan, rocky head that slowly subsides to a fat disk and leaves a moderate amount of lace.  The nose is roasted malt and chocolate, but is too subdued. The flavor consists of roasted malt and moderately sweet chocolate. It becomes much more vivid as the beer warms. I'm enjoying the bottom half of the bottle much more than I did the top half and will be sure to let my next bottle get closer to room temperature before diving in.  The mouthfeel isn't bad, but it's a trifle lighter than expected. I like my stouts to be thicker and creamier. It could be smoother in the mouth as well, but to be fair, it does even out as it warms.  Young's Double Chocolate Stout is a pretty good version. I'll definitely have it again. Note to self: next time, let it warm to near room temperature for maximum enjoyment.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ViveLaChouffe,4.17,Pours a pitch black with a dense creamy brown head. Smells of sweet dark malt and bitter chocolate.  Tastes smoky and creamy. Smooth and milky with underlying sweet chocolate flavors. Milk chocolate is what I am tasting. Slightly bitter as it warms. A dry finish and the bitterness lingers after the swallow. easy drinking for a stout. Very smooth and sweet. A really good stout and that's always a good thing.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ngandhi,4.21,"There's no dessert fit to stand up to Young's Double Chocolate. Rich in chocolate, yes, but incredibly rich as a beer, too. Though the stout is COMPLETELY dominated by chocolate malt, its presence as a beer is understood and respected. This would never diverge from stout and fall into the fruit/spiced/chocolate/coffee/nut/etc beer category. The chocolate upfront is deeply complex and reminiscent of my vacation in Paris. But what makes this a great beer, beyond its chocolately appeal, is an intense hop/yeast fruitiness that follows; it turns this brew into the stuff dreams are made of. The milky chocolate reappears in the finish followed by green, tannic hops.  I hate nitro cans, but the nitrogen head in Young's Double Chocolate intensifies the chocolate malt goodness and I would go so far as to argue that the tastiest part of this beer is the foam. This crushes all competitors and completely defines the style.  Relax, relax. ng",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mustard,3.73,"Presentation: 16.9oz. brown bottle; ""best before end"" warning -- in this case May 04 -- notched on the rear label's left periphery; purchased from Trader Joe's for $1.99.  Appearance: Essentially opaque in hue; large, chocolate-colored head; a gentle cascade effect upon the pour; thick, sticky lacing; very good head retention.  Aroma: Predominantly of cocoa... and nicely so.  Taste: Lightly sweet upfront; predominant flavor characteristic is that of milk chocolate, but not overwhelmingly so; clear notes of fruit and grain throughout; ever so faint sour quality; finish is predominantly bitter and roasty and balances things out nicely; medium bodied with something of smooth and almost silky mouthfeel.  Notes: Far from the ""decadently"" or ""sickly"" sweet after-dinner beer some would make it out to be; highly drinkable and well-balanced.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Boilermaker88,4.75,"Had this as my dessert beer for Thanksgiving and just found my notes. Poured from a bottle, it lacked the cascade effect but still had a nice, thick, creamy beige head and left some skeletal lace in the glass. The smell was like sticking my nose in a dark chocolate shake. Plenty of chocolate aroma with some coffee and roasted malt notes playing a supporting role. The taste was simply awesome: chocolate in all forms. Initially a milk chocolate flavor was dominant but as things progressed, a more bittersweet dark chocolate flavor pushed its way to the fore. As with the smell, some roasted malts and coffee flavor were present to provide an excellent balance. The feel was medium-bodied, velvety smooth and rich though not quite as smooth as from a nitro-tap. This beer is rapidly moving up my favorite beer rankings. Its so very easy to drink and goes great with a variety of desserts. A superb beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Quaffer,3.7,"16.9 oz. Bottle  Appearance: The tawny liquid of this beer filled my pint glass, forming a column of pure ebony. The tan head rose up to two fingers and settled down very slowly. It was fluffly at first, but finally flattened out into a thick, creamy looking layer. This, too, thinned out to become just a thick ring around the circumference of the glass. The lacing was minimal.  Smell: The unmistakeable smell of chocolate was very prevalent, but it did not overpower. It had a semi-sweet characteristic to it and was combined with roasted malt, a light fruitiness, and a hint of yeast. Straightforward and great smelling.  Mouthfeel: All other characteristics taken into account, I found this beer to be relatively thin and light. It just limped into the medium-body category and was a little rough in the back of the mouth. There was a slight creaminess upfront, but it was minimal.  Taste: Upfront there was definitely a sweet chocolate presence, though it was quick to surrender the spotlight. An overly strong tartness and a nice, dry hops character came to center stage quickly afterward. Though the chocolate continued on into the aftertaste, it was definitely a secondary player. Also on the finish was some nice roasted malt that blended well with the other flavors.  A good beer that I am glad that I finally got the chance to try. Maybe I was expecting too much from this brew, but it let me down a little. Don't get me wrong, I'll buy this beer again now that it is regularly available here in Wichita. But it really didn't bowl me over like I was expecting it to. The mouthfeel was lacking and the flavor had too much tartness for this type of beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,sulldaddy,4.35,"Had some of this left from Thanksgiving desert. 1 pint 9 fl oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  I poured the brew into my glass and the super dark brown color was immediately evident. no lite getting through this brew! There is a tan creamy head formed of very small tight bubbles. The aroma is sweet malt, coffee, and of course chocolate. Almost a scent like chocolate milk. The beer is very smooth and viscous with a rather heavy body. Very mild carbonation. Amazing head retention! After 10 minutes still about a cm of head in my glass. Very pleasant finish leaving a roasted and chocolate flavor on my tongue. No hint of alcohol flavor or aroma. I have paired this brew with vanilla ice cream and coffee very nicely as a dessert. It is a very good brew to convert non beer drinkers.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,FFudnam,4.12,"Beer was served out of the 16.9oz bottle.  Appearance: Pouring the stout from the bottle, I notice it is definitely dark like a good stout should be, although maybe a little thin for my liking. Created a decent, fizzy head... not creamy as I might have expected from a ""Luxury"" stout. Left a nice lace in the glass as it was consumed. And consumed it was!  Smell: Sweet malt, smooth... very smooth qualities in this one. Lots of chocolate, some coffee, slightly astringent alcohol/hops smell. OH I love it!  Taste: More chocolate, a little more coffee, sweet malty body, some caramel notes, raisins, rum, bananas.... tasty stuff! Finishes with a tight bitterness. Lingers on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Although I thought it poured thin, it actually is a little more full than I expected. Creamy smooth, with an appropriate amount of carbonation, and a clean finish.  Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. Appearance, smell, taste... all conspire to make this a great session stout. What can I say, I'll never turn a YLDCS down.  Although not one of my all-time favorites, this stout ranks high on my list. The flavors, scents, and textures are right. This beer needs a kick of hops or something to make it truly incredible.

Good with pastries, etc. Not the cloying chocolate of some similar beers.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Ellbert,2.76,This was definitely not what I expected. I expected a lot of chocolate but did not find that. I got a lot of burnt coffee flavors and some sweet malt but no chocolate. It wasn't even in the nose. The apperance was wonderful. Nice Head and dark color. Drinkablity was not very good since the flavor was off. It had an almost metallic taste that really turned me off.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,grynder33,2.73,"One of my bigger disappointments in tasting new beers. Color was ok small head malt aroma, with the smallest hint of chocolate. Taste was about the same, and that started drying out pretty quick.

664,73,winomark,3.15,"Appearance: Deep black with a thick, foamy chocolate head.  Aroma: As the name states, a creamy chocolate nose backed up by some mild coffee notes.  Taste: Slightly smoky, but lots of chocolate throughout. Dry, but flavorful finish.  Mouthfeel: Flavorful, but not overpowering. Slight richness from the chocolate.  Drinkability: Quite intriguing, but not for me. The ""real dark chocolate"" both enhances and takes away from this one IMO.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GreatPondBrewer,4.4,"Classic nitro pour with a huge, lasting tan cascade that settled atop a viscous looking black body. Smell was a cross between sweet creme and the inside of a chocolate chip package. So much sweetness. The taste was astounding. It was like drinking a carbomb without worrying about the alcohol at all. It had huge flavors of caramel drizzled cappucino, extra sweet chocolate milkshake, no astringent grains at all. This was pure velvet and a perfect after dinner drink. Drinkability is a little low as the amount of this I could drink is very small before I develop a major cavity.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,DagFishHead,4.97,"Appearance: Black-hole-black body. Lush, thick, tan head with bubbles that are just a bit too course for the style (bet the nitro can looks better, I know draught does). Still pretty. Preface: I've spoken to a number of people who were disappointed by this stout, calling it watery and flavorless: IMO, they were drinking it too cold. When this beer hits it's temperature, all hell breaks loose in terms of chocolate (both cocoa and malt). Smell: Subtle hot cocoa (mildly sweet, milky but not lacto acidic), hint of espresso. Taste: Lush baker's cocoa and semi-sweet malt, slight smoke, light dry hop finish and subtle bitterness sneaks up to top it off. Mouthfeel: Full, rich, creamy, silky... the word ""luxury"" on the label is appropriate. Bottle carbonation slightly heavy but soon settled. At proper serving temperature, this stout defines mouthfeel. Drinkability: Smoothness and low ABV make for an easy session.

664,73,dedalus,4.68,"absolutely my favorite stout.  this poured out of the nitro can looking deep, deep black, and leaving a pillowy, cream-colored head. the lacing was clingy and bubbly.  the nose was all roast and cocoa, with just the tiniest hint of hops. as the beer warms, more chocolate emerges in the nose, and it's sweet chocolate, like the syrup you use to make chocolate milk.  the mouthfeel was exemplary, just perfect. smooth, creamy, silky, no carbonation bite. mother's milk to a newborn.  the flavors are subtle and austere, especially at first when the beer is still very cool. light, gentle roast and a hint of chocolate. when the beer starts to warm, though, the chocolate really starts to make its presence known. not too sweet, but just right. just enough hops to keep the sweetness from getting any big ideas. this beer caresses your tongue with flavor, rather than bludgeoning it like a lot of beers. now, those beers have their times and places, but when a young's double chocolate is around, they'll have to sit in the backseat and be quiet. this beer reminds me of an anecdote i once heard ... stevie ray vaughan was playing a show with bb king, and stevie was going nuts, just letting loose with all his masturbatory guitar pyrotechnics, and then came bb's turn to solo, and he just played one note, and sustained it with his tasteful vibrato for the full 12 bars. and stevie knew he'd been shown up. a lot of beers are like stevie, hammering you over the head with huge flavors. and a lot of these beers are great. but sometimes you want to be given the benifit of the doubt, sometimes you want a brewer to trust you enough to be able to appreciate the flavors in a good, subtle, restrained brew, and young's double chocolate is a beer that allows you to do just this. smooth, creamy, silky, and more drinkable than any other stout i've come across. if you want something that's easily quaffable and tastes good, you got it. but sip it slowly and you'll find that these simple flavors of roasted malt and chocolate echo and reflect one another, resulting in a taste experience that is simply fantastic. some drinkers might suggest that this brew could use a little more hop balance, and it would be interesting to see how just a bit more bitterness might affect this brew. but why mess with perfection?  you owe it to yourself to try this stout. stellar brew.  cheers,  s.d.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Doesn't have any bitterness to it, making it that much more drinkable. This in one fine beer, so smooth and rich. It has more flavor than the oatmeal stout that I just drank.

Hints of dark roasted malt and chocolate all over. Goes down so easily it's scary. Be warned - this one will quickly become one of your standbys if you are into stouts. A fine example of the style.

Poured from that hardy 500 ml Young's embossed brown bottle, it is a velvet pitch black, creamy tan head that gracefully falls down to a thin cap. Nose is of powdered cocoa and baker's chocolate, with a foundation of roasted malt goodness. Flavour is a silky combination of chocolate and roasted malt, no more or less.

Tastes of chocolate malt with some very pleasant sweetness--not overly sweet as one might expect from ""double chocolate"", but well balanced. Some flavors of ""roasting"" are also present. This is a very smooth beer which feels slightly oily in the mouth.

664,73,Jarod,4.18,"440 ml nitro can Can labeled - draught  This beer poured a dark chocolate brown with black highlights, soo deep that no light could penetrate. The cream that sat on top was the color of light tan, cocoa powder like. It was thick, rich, creamy and sticky, almost a marshmallow type consistency. So sticky that when I touched the top it pulled up and left tiny pyramids all over the top that stayed firm, and on my finger it left a tiny Hershey kiss. The cream had a lasting ability that stayed to the last sip and past. It created a sheet like lace behind. **I tasted the foam, out of curiosity, and it tasted just like cool whip or just fresh whipped cream. The aromas that came from the glass were of roasted chocolate, roasted coffee, dark chocolates, cocoa powder, and had some musty appeal to it as well. The tastes were creamy and rich. Flavors of chocolate milk hit me first, then slowly the roasted coffee came to the front, as well as some bitter hops and bitter chocolate, then roasted and slightly burnt chocolate came in as well as roasted dark malts, I also detected some faint fruits in the back of the throat, but taste was mostly dominated by chocolate and coffee - roasted. The aftertaste was on the bitter side &#8211; coffee and chocolate and slightly dry. This beer was light to medium bodied. Over all a good combination of sweet, roasted, creamy flavors in one glass. I really enjoyed this beer, and it represents its style well. Only thing I would have liked to see in this beer, is more body, alittle thicker.

664,73,Darkale,4.04,"Huge, thick tan head, with a black body that is so dense no light can enter nor escape. Thick lacing. Aroma is awfully light; I really can't pick up much at all. I might have started out with the beer too cold. By the time it was warmed up, I was having too much fun drinking it to worry about the aroma.  Tastes like a chocolate milk shake, and that is not meant to be a criticism. Light and frothy in the mouth, deeply chocolate. They were not kidding when they said ""double chocolate.""  A fun beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rumrunner,4.23,1pint 0.9oz bottle. Good looking bottle.  Pours a nice dark brown. Small light creamy head. It dissipates quickly. Not much lacing. It smells of roasted dark chocolate. A bit of chicory and air on the nose.  The taste is roasted dark chocolate. Then there is a crisp hop fruit flavor. I also noticed some chicory coffee and an ending mild chocolate flavor. There is also an oak flavor that is very hidden. I noticed this on about every other sip. A bold venture in to the world of chocolate.  It feels crisp and watery with a fine drinkability. I like this stout but not on a regular basis.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kindestcut,4.38,"OK, I am becoming more and more a Stout guy. When I first became a BA I was a little afraid of the dark. As time has passed (and it hasn't been that much) I have become convinced that real beer is supposed to be dark, flavorful and a massive experience for the taste buds. This stout fits that bill.  Now, it may seem that when I say massive taste experience, I'm talking Imperial Stout, however, I see the Imperial as the psychotic uncle of the Stout. It's a completely different animal. Nuff said. This stout is tasty without being over the top.  The Young's Double Chocolate Stout was presented to me with a minimal dark tan head. The beer was as black as night. A nice-looking beer.  The aroma was of chocolate, obviously, although not at all over powering. I also could detect roasted malt. A very sweet-smelling beer.  The taste was just wonderful. For a sweet stout, I would expect it to be a ""dessert"" beverage. However, I could drink this all night. The Young's has a strong chocolate flavor along with a foundation of roasted malt, smoky and delicious. I can also detect faint hazlenut.  the mouthfeel is wonderful, as is the case for me with most stouts...a smooth, silky experience that screams ""drink me!""  And I did...over, and over, and over....",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Elemental,4.52,"An excellent Beer! Its thick and dark with a big brownish head that hangs around throughout the pint. The aroma is inviting with its sweet, chocolately , coffee aroma. It has a nice sweetness that complements the robust chocolatiness of this stout. Once the sweetness wears off there is a nice bitter aftertaste from the hops that seemed almost non-existant during the beginning of the sip.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WesWes,4.11,"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick light tan head. The nose is of chocolate malts and not much else. The taste is good. There is a good balance between base and specialty grains. The chocolate taste is present, but not overpowering. The thick head adds a creamy finish. The mouthfeel is great. This is a medium bodied beer and a real drinker. An excellant stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,granger10,4.08,"What a great looking beer. Big head but not out of control and a dark chocolaty appearance (hence the name). Taste is dominated by chocolate (name, again). But other flavors are there. I detect roasted grains in it along with a decent amount of hops. It seems thin for a stout but it is also creamy which I like. A good beer for dessert or any time a chocolate craving hits.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,RenoZymurgist,2.75,"Dark black beer poured with a nice head that subsided quickly. Aroma is very mild with roast malt and chocolate the most apparent. Taste is very intriguing yet seems to lack the luxury the label proclaims. Rich chocolate with roast barley and a touch of hops, this beer should be on nitro to showcase the flavors. For the bottled version the carbonic acid produced by artificial carbonation fights the smoothness and makes this a rougher beer than it should be.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,UncleJimbo,4.13,"This stout poured from nitro-tap a jet black color with creamy, light brown foam that coated the glass. The smell was a modest but distinct dark malt with a hint of chocolate. The taste was lightly sweet malt with some chocolate and cocoa, and a low hop presence. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and low carbonation and a dry finish. This was a very nice stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,xgrigorix,3.15,"Half liter brown bottle with freshness date clearly marked. Dark black with brownish highlights, and an appropriate tan head. Nose is of chocolate. Light / medium bodied. Tastes of burnt grain, fruity hops, and a chocolatey finish. A bit perfume like as well.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Tballz420,4.25,"This nice stout pours out of the nitro can a light brown color, but fades to an opaque black color as the head slowly builds like a reverse waterfall. Atop it is a 1/2 inch creamy tan head. It has a nice chocolate aroma. Its a very smooth, creamy tasting beer, with loads of roasted chocolate flavors. This is a damn good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TheDM,4.46,A very nice chocolaty aroma arose from my pour of a brown head full of large bubbles and a opaque dark brown body that left a clinging lacing as it receded down the side of my glass. Ultra smooth initial taste followed by a mild chocolaty sweet aftertaste. It was extremely smooth and very much to my liking. Wow,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,woemad,4.32,"Don't plan on tossing back a lot of these. Its really more a desert beer. Best to open this one at cellar temperature. I had mine in the fridge. When I opened it, it still hadn't warmed up to the right temperature yet, and took until mid-glass for the flavor to be appreciable. It had a nice tan head with good lacing. Not much scent beyond dark malt (it was still a little too cold.By mid glass, you could notice a chocolaty scent in the background). Creamy mouthfeel, as one would expect with this kind of beer. When warmed up to proper temp, has a nice toasty malt flavor and there is a very tasty chocolate flavor in the background and in the aftertaste. There was a hop presence, but it is relatively subtle. Reccomended after a nice, satisfying meal.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Redrover,3.82,"16.9 oz brown bottle. Classic label & packaging.  Beer pours a very dark brown with a decent head. Surprisingly, not much lacing.  Beer smells of chocolate, some malt, a bit of coffee and a touch of alcohol.  The taste kind of surprised me. I was expecting more chocolate taste given the smell. The chocolate taste is there, but very subdued. An alcohol taste also makes itself knowen and you get a bit of malt sweetness. Not a bad beer at all!  Carbonation seems perfect for style. Very smooth and easy going down. I'm not sure I would want to drink more than one or two, but it is enjoyable.  I like this beer, I happen to like Rogue's chocolate offering better.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JohnnyDuvel,4.15,"This is as close to a candy bar as beer could be. Not much in the way of bitterness, and the mouthfeel is a bit watery. For overall effect, this is a bit thin for a stout. On the other hand, the taste is excellent, and the drinkability high. If you like 'em sweet, this will do.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jcalabre,3.25,"Originally sampled on 3 May 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. Thiss starts out w/ all the right intentions, but disappoints at the end. It starts w/ a nice chocolate nose, tan head w/ a dark body and some up front chocolate flavor, but finishes a bit thin an watery. The body of this beer is too thin to make it work.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jeffboo,4.33,"A classic chocolate brew from London. This pours a nice deep black with red highlights and a very puffy tan foam. Aroma of chocolate, fresh roasted coffee,and sweet milky malt. The body is a silky milk smooth, with a quick chocolate begining and a bitter chocolate and espresso middle finishing full and roasty. A very nice mix of stout and chocolate. The perfect dessert drink.  Sidebar: Blended 60/40 with New Glarus Raspberry Tart: A reddish black brew with purple head appear. Aroma is Raspberry with hints of coffee and chocolate. The full body supports a chocolate covered raspberry flavor that finishes with sweet roasted malt. To make a dessert beer better- fruit + chocolate= delicious. Highly worth the effort.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,alexgash,4.33,"Smuggled a couple pint bottles into Utah two weeks ago, and finally drank one last night. Had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed! Pours a dark brown with a medium creamy tan head. Smell is dominated by chocolate [shocker]. Wow. A little too cold to start with; not much carbonation. Taste is also dominated by chocolate and sweet roasty goodness. Very smooth--exceptionally smooth. Surprisingly drinkable for a such a sweet, chocolatey beer. I could drink a few pints of this. I would love to try this on tap. One of my favorite stouts, but not quite as good as the Kalamazoo and the many imperials I love.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Jon,4.25,"This stout pours a deep brown, almost black color with a creamy tan head that settles into a small ring. The nose features notes of caramel, roasted malt, and surprisingly, chocolate. As the beer warms up, the taste is divine, albeit somewhat one-dimensional. Dark chocolate is the main event here, although notes of caramel, cream and sugar run their courses, as well. Drinking this is almost reminiscent of sipping a chocolate malt. The feel is incredibly smooth and velvety. Only minimal carbonation is present here, and it's hard to detect. For a stout with so much chocolate character, I thought this might be too much to handle, but upon review, it's quite drinkable, and a real treat overall. Luxurious, indeed.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,yosh,4.47,This beer was a true treat! It was a creamy beer and went down very smooth. The taste was exceptional and lasted all the way through the drink. The chocolate flavor added a lot to the beer. I'd drink it again anytime. The price wasn't too bad for the size of the bottle.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Reidrover,4.19,Ok bought in the wonderful Youngs 16.09 oz brown bottle..great simple purple label. Well this is one of the best looking beers when poured that I ahve seen so far..almost pitch black beer ( some faint mahogany hints when held to the light)..and a massive creamy coffee and creme colour head bee-U-tee-ful. After all that the aroma is rather subdued..some raosted malts.. but its a fresh aroma. MM lovelly tasting stout starts of with some sweet malts and then gets all creamy and finishes with some great milk chocolate ..wonderful sipper. Fantatsic feel on the tongue very smooth and creamy A most drinkable stout..very nice stuff indeed.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,TripelJ,3.53,"I had to put my two cents in as far as this beer is concerned (with respect to the nitro can.) This is one of my favorite beers, belittled by the medium in which it is served. The draught can version of this classic stout, has far less character than the bottled version, so much in fact that I would recommend it as a baby step up from guiness. I tried this twice at my local pub to be resolute in my decision--I am. Try this in bottle long before you bother with the nitro can. I respect the physics of the nitro can and belive it should be reserved for guiness and mass-marketed english pub ales.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Indybeer,4.32,"Pours a deep dark brown, with a frothy head that lingers and leaves delicate lace on the side of the glass. The aroma of chocolate and malt dominate. The taste! Now this one goes down smooth with just the right combination of hops, malt, & chocolate, with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. One of the best stouts i've had.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,SheepNutz,4.35,"I had this in a .5L bottle poured into a Young's pint glass. The color is a deep black with a nice 1 finger of tan head. After a few minutes, the head dies down a bit. There is a tad bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a delicate mix of chocolate and roasted coffee. The taste is a bit chocolatey in the middle of the tongue, with only a small bit of hops in the back. There is a bit of a coffee taste to the finish. The mouthfeel is a little bit soft for a stout. The drinkability is pretty good for a stout though. This really makes a great dessert beer!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BierReise,4.1,What an awsome stout this is. Beautiful dark choco-brown body with tight fluffy beige head. Smell is immediately chocolate and roasted malt. Smooth as silk on the palate and clings to the inside of your mouth. Taste is bitter chocolate with hop overtones. This is by far one of my favorite stouts.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,clvand0,4.62,Cool cascading effect. Very smooth and tasty with a creamy head. This pours a very dark color with a small head and moderate lacing. The chocolate is very evident in the flavor - which I love. I would like to have this beer again and again because it is so drinkable and smooth. I love it.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerBuilder,4.3,"Pours to a dark brown color with ruby highlights. It forms a thick, creamy, light brown head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma just hits you with a huge fudge, dark chocolate smell. There is a bit of roasty malt and alcohol in the end. The flavor is wonderful, with a bit of roastiness up front, then quickly you are hit wit the sweet, dark chocolate flavor. This is a full-bodied beer with smooth, silky texture, and a dry bitterness in the finish. I found this to be an excellent beer. Would be great with desserts.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,fattyre,4.47,"This is -finally- my 100th. I picked this one because it is a mutual favorite of both Bunnyhop and myself. This beer pours a clear very, very dark reddish brown with a very creamy (luxurious?) moderately large tan head. The mouthfeel is very silky and oily- quite nice. The smell is a tempting chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is very pleasant chocolate and roasted malt with a very mild hoppy finish. This is a very enjoyable stout that makes a wonderul drink after a meal yet I could probably(though I have never tried) drink it all night. One of my all time favorites.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,feloniousmonk,4.63,"Color is a solid black, with a large, lush, lovely brown head. Aroma: soft and creamy, with a subdued cocoa content, sweet and mild. On the palate, however, things take a change for the decidedly better! Niiiiiice, oh, so, nice, with substantial chocolate feeling, although it doesn't actually come in strong at first. At the end of the swallow, there it is, that real chocolate essence. WOW! Ever so tasty, and I'm not even such a chocolate nut, but you've got to give it up, there it is, and it tastes great!!! Hops are minimal, here, and malt is king! Texture is smooth, and taste is sublime! You never forget the chocolate, for the flavor subsists, and is sublime! Fully integrated, perfectly balanced, this is one excellent stout, with an excellent addition of flavor! Another great one from Young's! The delicious flavor never ever ends after the bottle empties, but the flavor lingers long after! (I've had it in the nitro-can, too, and it was not enhanced by that gimmick!)",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,stegmakk,3.27,"This looked beautiful...dark balck with a dark tan head and good lacing  The aroma was a little off...some roasted malt and chocolate, but there was a slight metallic nose to it...  Taste was only average...I have had better choc stouts...slight bitter at first...there are hints of chocolate, roasted malt  Mouthfeel was good...thick but not a meal...  I could drink this for a while as long as I didn't stick my nose in it to smell it...overall ok...not bad...but not great",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,tavernjef,4.18,"Color of this yummy chocolate is deep, brown, almost black like a dark chocolate candy. Nice tan head, frothy foam about a finger high, fades a little leaving patchy lace. Smells of very sweet and rich chocolate with a nice creamy lightness, notes of ginger spice and nuts. Taste echoes the smell, its got a good amount of chocolaty flavor thats sweetly bitter but not overbearing. It stays nice and silky smooth the whole way through with a good chocolatey twinge thats quite nice in the finish and feel. Some faint notes of hop presence and ginger and is medium to heavy bodied. This is a great stout for having around Halloween and the winter Holidays when everyone starts eating more sweets. Super yummy stuff.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Garin,4.42,"It poured a nice thick, rich creamy dark brown. The head started out quite light and puffy, but it quickly reduced to a thin foam. Nutty, malty, roasty, chocolate aromas were obvious immediately. The flavour was rich, malty, and chocolatey, with a nicely bitter followup. I felt it looked richer and thicker than it actually was. After several bottles of this, I'm starting to crave just a little more body here, and this is about the only concrete criticism I can offer.  Overall, it was definitely an intensely enjoyable experience. The chocolate was pleasantly present in both the aroma and taste, without overpowering the malts. After a few bottles, I've come to enjoy it even more. This beer has entered my regular rotation as one of my favourites, and I expect it'll stay there for quite some time.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Scooter77,4.2,"This is such a great and complex stout. Pours a deep, dark brown color with about a 1-inch head. The head slowly fades down leaving a nice, sticky lace on the glass. Aromas are full of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. The taste complements the aroma perfectly. Theres a slight bitterness upon first taste, but it matched exquisitely with the roasted malts and chocolate. This beer is exceptionally smooth, creamy, and easy to drink. It's absolutely delicious.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,rockdick,4.4,"One of my new, favorite beers. Wow! I'm drooling just thinking about the complex character of this brew. It pours a pretty thick, tan head that lasts a while. Smells and tastes of a sort of bitter coffee-like flavor with lots of character. Feels nice and creamy in the mouth. Very drinkable, just not too many at once. I'll be getting a sixer next since the one I tried was just a pint bottle.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Sigmund,4.68,"Black (actually very dark ruby) with a good tan head and nice lacing. Aroma is all chocolate and roasted malts. When you expect something cloyingly sweet (chocolate in beer - ""uff da""!): Surprise! - a perfectly rounded and well balanced flavour, loads of chocolate but never sickly, just the right roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer is a real treat - I would be happy to drink it each and every afternoon, but just one bottle a day!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,goz,3.8,"Pour is deep black, large medium brown head, slowly diminishes to leave good lacing. Aroma is strong on the chocolate, and some roasted malts in the back. Flavor starts almost like hot chocolate, ends with some mild roasted bitter maltiness. Body is full and strong. Not something I would drink every night, but quite a tasty brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,JISurfer,2.7,"Eh, this was ok. The look was great, the smell was great. Then there was the taste. There was no taste what so ever. I got nothing out of this. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I was very disappointed. It was kind of waterd down tasteing, but had some hints of maltiness. Other than that, I don't have anything else to say.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AtLagerHeads,3.85,"Very deep dark reddish brown appearance poured from an equally dark and beautifully shaped and labeled bottle. No head to speak of, but what little was there was tan and thin. This is a very chocalately beer as would be expected from its name. The label boasts silky smooth, rich and creamy, and that is no overstatement. This is very rich beer with a clean chocolate sense in both taste and smell. The unexpected finish comes from a strong final rush hop bitterness. Much less than expected aftertaste. We drank this after a nice meal and found it to be a perfect desert finish to the evening. Surprisingly enjoyable after an initial sense of being too sweet.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Stubbie1,3.35,"Pours a dark black leavin a thich off white head. The head stays a bit and leaves a thick spotty lace.  Aroma: A faint smell of roasted malt. Nothing more, nothing less.  Taste: Again the roasted malt flavor and a bit bitter after taste. Some coffie flavors did come out but I was hoping for more of a chocolate, roasted flavor. Not bad in taste but nothing worth buying again. It did go down smooth. Over all a O.K stout. After reading the other reviews, maybe I had a bad bottle. I will try it again to be fair.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Ahhdball,3.16,"I was looking forward to this but was somewhat dissapointed. It poured nice with a rich thick head that left a very nice lace after a few drinks. It took maybe 2 or 3 drinks for me to get the chocolate tatse but once I did I thought it tasted like un-mixed cocoa. Y'know, the flavor at the bottom of a hot chocolate? It wasn't sweet like a dessert beer should be. Maybe I got a bad batch but I really wasn't impressed with this one.  On another happy note though, my father-n-law enjoyed it. What does that mean? Well to put it bluntly he's a ""Bud-man"". I try to get him to taste beers with me but he normally sticks to the norm. Maybe with this there will be some hope!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jackndan,3.29,"Youngs Double Chocolate Stout: A deep black stout. The head is tan, not very tall but thick and long lasting. The aroma is very slight, it takes a lot and huffing and puffing to get a sense of the beer. The chocolate taste is there, but to me this beer is dominated by a smoky, almost burnt malt taste. Not as smooth as others of the style I&#8217;ve had, with some prickly carbonation. The aftertaste is there, but not a whole lot different than the first sip. Not worth the price I paid.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,marburg,4.63,"This is one of my favorite stouts. I've always loved it -- and loved it in any form: bottle, tap, nitro can, whatever. And I just had it last night for the umpteen-billionth time. Mmmm.  Looks like a picture-perfect nitro pour should. Now close your eyes and sniff. You're walking through the Swiss Miss hot cocoa plant. If you're not, I fear your olefactory senses may be gone! Deep chocolate aroma. Thick creamy white head. You can smell the milky, creamy texture before it ever even hits your lips.  Then you taste it. And it's death by chocolate! Milky chocolate flavors compliment the stout perfectly. Milkshake goodness. Like eating a chocolate mousse. It's a food group, not a beer. Light hop undertones to balance a little bit.  Easier to drink than water, and if I could breathe it, I probably would. It's extreme chocolate flavor is it's savior and it's lone problem. There are simply times when chocolate doesn't go with what you're eating or times when it gets a little too sweet for taste. But make no mistake. This is one of the better chocolate stouts available.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WaltTrombone,4.28,"A creamy dark beige nitro head sits regally upon an opaque dark brown/ black throne, and refuses to abdicate all the way down to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malt, with a hint of sweetness. The taste is a Solomon-like balance of dark malt and semi-sweet chocolate, with fleeting notes of cherry, raspberry, and burnt metal. The head leaves clingy tendrils down the glass as you drink. As it warms, expresso flavors join the malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin, almost watery, with little carbonation. Some other reviewers think this brew is too sweet or gimmicky, but I am not one of them. One of my current favorites!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,canoehornpoint,4.17,Pint bottle with freshness dating. Gotta love a pint bottle. ABV reads 5.2%. Listed here as 5%. Pours deep dark with carbonation bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass. No head but I didn't expect any. The aroma is a complex blend of chocolate and roasted sweet malt. The taste is a milky chocolate smooooothness that almost overshadows the stout taste but not in a bad way. You can really feel the body on the back of the palate.  Personal notes: I expected this to be too sweet for my liking but I was pleasantly surprised. There is nothing really in excess here but rather lots of flavor in the right amounts.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,AudioGilz,3.86,"I already reviewed the bottle. This can obviously makes the nitro cascading effect and a wonderful thick off-white head. The liquid is opaque. This stout is so super smooth. I yearned for stronger chocolate in the bottle, and I yearn for it here too. The bottle seemed to have more overall flavor in it. This can seems kind of bland in a way. But it's not bad by any means. Nothing about this beer is ""strong"". And that is definitely a plus when it comes to drinkability. I could easily and probably will drink the three other cans right after this one.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,SamuraiJack,4.2,"Oh how I wish this were a cheaper bottle!! These days it's my favorite stout, but the ""luxury"" on the label sadly applies not only to the luxurious nature of the brew but also to its cost. First pour is black, thick, creamy with a gorgeous tan head with tight but consistent bubble size. Gorgeous aromas of dark chocolate and toasted malt give a clue at the flavour to come. This is an incredibly smooth stout that flows over your tastebuds in a soft blanket (rather than explosion) of chocolate, dark roasted coffee, cream and balancing sweetness. Both the hops and the malt are there to provide the foundation, but never unbalance the overall flavour. Unlike some chocolate stouts, there is no false note in the aftertaste, leaving one able to savour the beer over time. A great stout to have with desert - or AS desert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Rocko,4.28,"This stout pours a darkbrown color, almost to the border of black. It's head is brown and quite dense, after a few minutes the head fades to about 5mm and stays like that the whole glass through. Very nice appearance! My bottle said it had an abv of 5.2% not 5.0% as it says on top.  The smell is rich of chocolate (of course :p), coffee and raisins. After the first sip I noticed it had a pleasant bitterness in it too, not TOO surprising was it? :) The sweetness is not overpowering either, it's very balanced in this matter. The most significant tastes is chocolate and coffee. Very thick pleasant mouthfeel.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,OldFrothingSlosh,4.12,"Presentation: 1/2 liter amber bottle.  Appearance: Sinister-looking black color. Very active bubbly head with a rich coffee color. Quickly wore down to a thin but sturdy quantity. Lovely lacing of the glass.  Smell: Unwrap any chocolate bar and inhale. 'Nuff said.  Taste: My oh my, but this is one smooth brew. The chocolate flavor is captured very well in the taste (though I guess I thought it would be more ""chocolatey""...).  Mouthfeel: Supple smoothness and creaminess make for a lovely sensation on the palate.  Drinkability: Since this is such a well-balanced beer, it is very drinkable. The combination of the chocolate bitterness and the alcohol complement each other nicely. Overall, just a notch below the Imperial Stouts in my book.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,doho95fu,3.98,"Love the look of a black stout as it settles, and this brew does that nicely. Thick tan shaving cream head and deep brown black body. The smell, not surprisingly, is of chocolate. What is different about this chocolate brew and others is that neither the smell nor the flavor goes overboard with the chocolate. The other noticeable characteristic in both flavor and smell was malt, again not over powering in either. The only weekness for this brew is in its mouthfeel - I like a stout to feel thick in the mouth, and this brew seemed slightly on the watery side. This, however, is overall a very drinkable and solid stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,kunzbrew,4.03,This brew pours a jet black with a thick creamy root beer type head that stays for the duration. A thick lace is left behind as the first few sips are taken. The smell of milk chocolate pour out from the top of the glass. The first sip reveals a pleasant chocolate coffe flavor that is nice and thick like a milk shake. This is a very nice brew to have with desert after a nice filling dinner.  Cheers,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,WanderingFool,4.31,"Appearance: Black like a leather bikers jacket with a thick ivory foam head. Some lace is found on the side of the glass, but most falls back into the beer. Smell: Chocolate and malt are most noticeable when held close to the nose. Taste: A milk chocolate taste dominates and is followed by a more mellow malt flavor and an ever so slight bitter finish. The aftertaste is that of milk chocolate. Mouthfeel: Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer feels like a smooth, cool, velvet blanket sliding over your tonge. However, I find it slightly thin for a stout. Drinkability: A great dessert beer, but leaves you feeling full after a pint or two.  This is a terrific chocolate stout. I find myself thinking of this beer often and can remember its chocolaty flavor days later. It reminds me so much of chocolate milk that I forget I'm drinking a stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,zerk,4.25,"Pours black with some ruby highlights. Has a thin but persistent head that leaves a fair amount of lace on my glass. Aroma is rich and malty, with an abundance of chocolate... almost smells like malted ovaltine. Flavor is a wonderful mixture of malty sweetness and slightly bitter chocolate... very smooth and rich. Hops play a role of balance... barely noticeable, but doing thier job. Has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and is full bodied. An excellent dessert beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,GeoffRizzo,3.15,"Poured like a typical stout, black in color with a thin foamy head. The smell was initially of chocolate and somewhat of a burnt odor. Initial taste was of chocolate, slite sweetness and a bit creamy. The creamy flavor stayed on the palate throughout. A bit of a dry aftertaste, which is expected after a stout.  A Guinness with some chocolate flavoring is my overall impression. Nothing fancy for a stout, but drinkable on a cold winter night.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,PhantomVodoo,4,"Pours a somewhat opaque dark brown to black. Nice brown head. I detect dark roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma. Smells like chocolate milk with alcohol. Taste is not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated. Tastes much more like dark bitter chocolate although some milk chocolate sweetness is present. Malt sweetness is well balanced by the hops although the sweetness edges out the bitterness in this battle. Good mouthfeel. Not overly sweet with good drinkability (I'd actually like to see a little more sweet milk chocolate flavor in this one). Overall, a good beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mitchster,4.18,"Vertical pour of this slightly less than ruby red/jet-black liquid forms a beautiful yeasty thick meringue pancake of a head. Beautiful to watch the downpour of thin bubbles sheet down the glass. Low on carbonation (or should I say nitrogenation), as most nitrocanned ales are. Aroma is suprisingly close to Guinness nitrocan, with an added dose of sweet milk chocolate. Mmmm...velvety smooth texture, amazingly rich pillow-soft mouthfeel, crisp clean finish with a hint of grain, freshly shelled walnuts and cocoa powder. Hops are only there to balance, never becoming intrusive. The only downside to this heavenly brew is the subtle metallic and cardboard notes in the aftertaste. These become more prominent as the brew warms, but don't really become a bother. Thank god they are only subtle, for this brew is highly drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Morris729,4.18,"Pours an almost black color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a nice sticky lace that coats the sides of the glass while drinking. Nose is fresh coffee, sweet roasted malts, and milk chocolate. Smooth, creamy, thick, and chewy in the mouth with tastes of bitter dark chocolate and a sweet maltiness. A very nice stout that goes great with dessert.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,cretemixer,4.07,"Pretty nice pour. Deep brown, almost black in color with a dense velvety mocha colored head. The head hangs in at about 1/4 inch and doesn't change until I drink it up at the end of the glass. Smells like Bailey's Irish Creme--chocolate milk with an alcohol kick. Tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, some malt character too. As the beer warms closer to room temperature, the tastes intensify a little. Mouthfeel was pretty thin for such a rich looking brew and carbonation is low. A good dessert beer.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,yen157,4.15,"The head settled into a fine tan lace that was sticky as hell. It smelled of milk chocolate and coffee. I started thinking I was picking up on some hazelnut aroma after awhile, but chocolate and hazelnuts are a favorite combination of mine so Im not sure if I really smelled them or was just imagining the scent. The chocolate addition was evident throughout the flavor profile of the beer. The only element of the beer that made me forget about chocolate even for a second was the delicate hop bitterness.  It was incredibly silky in the mouth, a real pleasure to drink. The beer was more like chocolate soda or Yoo-hoo then I remember. The last time I had this one was early in my days of drinking good beer. It seems my memory of this one are better than the real thing, but thats fine with me. This was still a different, enjoyable stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,nixhecks,4.39,"I recently tried Rogue's Chocolate Stout and was really impressed, however this one blew that out of the water. The main reason for this was probably the nitro charger in the can which gave the beer a ""icecream-ish"" mouthfeel, and also lended to quite a show while waiting for the head to form in the glass (which remained the entire time and was very creamy). Definite chocolate taste, especially in the beginning. Slight bitterness showing towards the end but overall quite a treat. As one user described Rogue's stout as ""chocolate milk for adult"" I would describe this as the chocolate shake for adults.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BitteBier,4.35,"Pours almost completely black with just hints of ruby/amber on the edges. A substantial foamy, tan head with some lacing. The smell is dominated by creamy chocolate scents with a hint of underlying roasted notes. Taste is quite sweet throughout the drink, starting rather light-textured and even a bit hoppy. A rich taste of chocolate truffles comes through toward the end, culminating with some dryness. As in the smell, roasted grains are present but somewhat muted. The light but rich taste and dry finish lends itself to a nice mouthfeel and a better-than-average drinkability for a stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,ethosx19,4.6,"Double chocolate? It has chocolate, but I always want more. Beautiful black body and chocolate aroma. Taste is rich and smooth chocolate with just a little bitterness at the end. One isn't enough, I'd like another.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mrjimcat,3.65,"The nitro can version of this stout was purchased along with the bottle for comparison and review. There was a distinct difference in taste with the nitro can version. There was much less of the luxurious mouthfeel with a nice chocolate taste. The can version was good in its own right but drier and of course, more like a pub poured pint. It also seemed less complex in flavors.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Gusler,4.06,"The archetypal stout color Ebony, the head planetary in size, creamy texture and the lace fine sticky sheets to cling to the glass, a nice light chocolate color for both. The aroma of coffee, toasted grains, chocolate and sweet, as can be, quite a pleasure. Start is sweet, the top thick and chewy, the finish passably acidic, the hops pertinent to the style, dry long lasting aftertaste, and a World Class Stout in my book.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

664,73,CharlesRiver,4.15,"Smooth, creamy and silky. What a great stout. Not an overpowering chocolate flavor as it does not come until the end. Very dark in color with a beautiful tan head that lasts and lasts. I am sure that this would be even better on tap. A bit dry in the middle but evens out in the end. This is one that I will go back to.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Amdahl,4.28,"This is a very black beer. There is a 1/4 inch of creamy, tan head. The aroma is dominated by cocoa and roasted malts. This beer tastes just as it claims to be, Chocolate, Chocolate, and more Chocolate. Its almost like drinking a chocolate silk pie. Very rich, but not sweet. This is a light bodied beer for a stout. Nice lace goes down the bottle. I could drink quite a few of these.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerGlassesCollector,4.25,"Just the name of this beer makes you want to drink it. Luxury Double Chocolate Stout pours a deep brown colour topped by a dark tan head. The aroma of this beer consists of chocolate malts. Taste couldn't be anything else but chocolaty. Chocolate malts dominate the taste. Excellent, luxurious brew",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Zraly,4.17,"The beautiful smell of chocolate really defines this stout. The head was a dark tannish tint.  The flavor of the beer came across with a full chocolate flavor, yet it was able to maintain a sense of mildness in the finish. An interesting paradox in the realm of aesthetics. There is a slight hint of coffee as well, somewhat reminiscent of a mocha latte...milky smooth, bitter but not overpowering. Also, I get a slight alcohol taste, a nice touch to round out the characteristics of this brew.  I'd say that this is a complex yet polite stout. It would make a most excellent choice for a dessert beer with its pleasant, ""chocolate cake"" after taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,bditty187,3.53,"Luxury Double Chocolate Stout is not nearly as luxurious as I had expected. The chocolate in the nose wasnt all that potent and its aroma was too powdery. The backdrops of aroma were very nice, liquor and black licorice. The palate was powdered chocolate, licorice, roasted malt, and some faint, yet noticeable, hops. It finished dry and a tad thin. The beer poured almost black with a tan, creamy head not all that big. No lace.  This beer is enjoyable and Id recommend it and drink it again (most likely).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,jtw5877,4.35,"Pours a deep dark brown with a white/tan head, aroma of dark roasted malt. Nice malt flavors with chocolate and caramel tones, a little bit of hops. A very good stout. I would recommend this as a very solid stout.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Lupe,4.53,"Pours black as night, no light can come through. Big creamy tan head that heaves wispy lacing all the way down. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Some sweetness that goes with a slightly burnt/roasted flavor. Big chocolate flavour, not milk chocolate but dark. Some hop flavor to balance the malt with a slight hint of licorice. Finishes slightly dry. Very easy to drink. Incredible.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,brakspear,4.3,"A former Supreme Champion beer in the UK, I think it is probably best to drink it in the US from a bottle rather than the nitro can. While the nitro can many give it a creamy smooth head, the colder serving temperatures required by the can mars the great chocolate flavors and aroma in the beer.  The stout pours inky black with a moderate tan head that lingers and then drops back to a generous collar on the inside of the glass. The aroma is mild chocolate, from both the chocolate malt used and the actual chocolate added to the beer. The taste is smooth and silky chocolate with a slight hop bite in the finish to balance the wonderful sweet flavors in the beer. This is a highly drinkable specialty stout for cooler temperatures and when you are looking for a beer to sip and enjoy.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,aaronh,4.03,"Just love the way the nitro-can beers seem to have the head cascade down through the beer and back up to the top. The head on this beer takes well over a minute to settle out from the nitro can, and it stays thick and creamy throughout the entire time you drink it. When it is too cold, there is very little flavor. As it warms, the chocolate and earthy hops aromas arise. The flavor exhibits a bitter, dark chocolate or cocoa taste with roasted malt and a very thin yet creamy mouthfeel. It has a nice bitterness on the finish with a hint of sweetness and that dark chocolate note. A good beer with not as much chocolate as I presumed it would have, which is a good thing.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,putnam,4,"Beautiful chocolate beer here. Just made for a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Not sweet, except for a supple slither of alcohol sweetness in the mid-palate.

664,73,Mick,4.72,"This is really good stout. Very rich appearance, nice head and less milky than other stouts.

This is great all around stout for die-hard fans or first timers.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Jason,3.71,"Outstanding head &#8230; all canned nitro brews are like this right? Smells of powdered hot chocolate, hint of alcohol, kiss of roasted grain and some sweetness.

I prefer this on tap so much more but this is not too bad.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,HopheadEd,3.98,"Great color, that's the first thing I noticed. So dark it's black, with a great head, tannish white, about an inch, that stays almost to the bottom. A true bishop's collar. Just a light presence of malt and chocolate in the aroma. A little more noticeable in the taste. Lace throughout, with a pretty good finish.

664,73,mzwolinski,4.33,"The worst thing you could do for yourself is drink this too cold. I didn't let it sit long enough before sampling last time, and it had been a while since I'd last tasted it. As a result, I was unpleasantly surprised at a somewhat weak and astringent aroma, combined with a less than pleasant finish. And I once thought it was a great beer!  After 10 minutes or so, the beer really began to show its character. The combination of roasty chocolate malt and real chocolate began to come through in the aroma, and the decadently sweet flavor picked up a nice, slightly hoppy finish.  There's a real danger of over-doing it on the sweetness in a drink like this, but Young's managed to balance out this beer quite nicely. The chocolate is wonderful, and something you won't find in many other beers, but the body is fairly light (perhaps a bit too light for a stout) and the finish is dryer than one would expect. Perhaps a bit thin for something billed as a luxury double chocolate stout, but it works! Very drinkable.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,beernut7,4.23,I was looking forward to this beer all night. I have been looking for a good solid robust stout for a long time and I figured Young's wouldn't let me down. Was I ever right. The deep dark color and thick foamy lasting head were the introduction I was yearning for. The first taste of this heavy bodied brew was just liquid heaven. The smooth roasted tootsie roll chocolate flavor is jsut what I was hoping for and made my day. The mellow latent bitterness helps balance out the sweet to create a fantastic stout.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,stcules,4.62,"Toasted, but not so intensive. You can found in the smell the chocolate... but you must drink it for tasting the real soul of this beer! Dark and bitter chocolate.

The appearance is what you would expect, black with an enormous brown fluffy head. For some reason, I found the smell to be a bit off, and IMO it certainly did not fit with the thick sweetness of the beer. This stuff tastes delicious however...the chocolate is clearly present as is a sweet flavor of coffee and vanilla, but none overpower the beer. And its smooth as silk. Oooh mama.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Complex and enjoyable, but not for every occation.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Bighuge,3.18,"This dark ruby colored brew pours a huge brown head, foamy and rocky. Aroma is of cocoa bean and java. You can actually taste the chocolate in this brew (maybe because they actually use real chocolate in the recipe). Can taste baking chocolate. Bittersweet is predominant. Coffee and vanilla bean tones also surface. Pretty light in body for a stout. Maybe medium at best. I used to think more highly of this beer years ago, untill I started getting a taste of what the truly high quality stouts taste like (i.e., Kalamazoo).",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

Young's Double Chocolate, on the other hand, actually has a chocolate aftertaste. And this is a beer that actually *looks* like it's good for you -- it's a rich brown (almost black), sweet and thick tasting. Just the thing for fattening you up.  Nowhere on Young's website do they mention the Double's caloric count, nor do they mention stout's storied history as a Victorian ""fattener-up"" for expectant mothers. They *do* mention why it tastes like chocolate:  ""Pale ale malt, crystal malt, roasted barley, chocolate malt, special blend of sugars, Fuggles and Goldings hops, real dark chocolate and chocolate essence. Melted chocolate bars are added to the boil and the essence is added after filtration.""  And gad, it's good! It rivals Young's own Oatmeal as my favourite stout.

The aroma is of a slightly sweet dark malt like bittersweet chocolate. The medium body and restrained carbonation level give a soft, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is very lightly sweet with just a touch of roastiness against a light bitterness. Well balanced but somewhat lacking in character for it - not very much punch. The finish is light and leaves a pleasant, lightly dry and roasty aftertaste. Immensely drinkable. I once felt that I preferred the nitro-can version because it has such a soft, silky-smooth and creamy character, but I now feel that the bottled version is more enjoyable as it appears less sweet and slightly more complex.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90

The taste, well there's definitely chocolate in it..and surprisingly, it is rather good.

Dense gray-tan head does not diminish, but rather sticks around the whole way down. Nose is mostly chocolate malt and faint roastedness. Suggestions of smoked dark fruits (plums mostly) are present as well. Taste is big on...well...chocolate. In correction to a previous review. Real dark chocolate IS used, in addition to the choc malts. Results are extraordinary. Some vanilla and roastedness in here too. Traces of grapes and plums, along with a dollop of butter, just for good measure. Grasping bitterness at the closure, without an expressed flavor. Just enough to wipe the palate clean and demand a follow-up sip. I would like it just a little more creamy and firm in the mouth...but still nice as it is....if just a hair on the thin side.

Wonderful dark brown almost black color and a medim tan foamy head, plus an interesting smell of chocolate that was almost overpowering.

Still good, though.  overall: 3.8 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  77",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,marc77,3.95,"When held up to light this brew is as dark as a stout can be without being pitch black. It's actually very clear with no haze and exhibits a very deep garnet hue. Beautiful creamy light brown head with excellent retention. Sweet (real!) milk chocolate aroma is nicely combined with a chocolate malt note. The Young's signature yeast pearish fruitiness of course adds to the complexity as well. Medium to full body that is almost oily. Although the aroma may suggest that cocoa may dominate the flavor profile, the combination of real chocolate, chocolate malt, roasted barley dryness and hop bitterness meld well. This is a flavorful stout and is highly drinkable like most of Youngs brews. I do feel, however, that this brew has been dumbened down in the last couple years. It could be my imagination or changing palette. In any case, get it in the bottle. The nitro/ CO2 widget in the can kills the taste.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Thrasher,4.7,"On tap. Amazing. Unbelievably creamy and smooth. Delectable and tempting, like candy. A sweet, crisp, milky and wonderfully balanced brew. Alcoholic kick nestled comfortably within the chocolate. Dense head, thick lustrous body like the best the UK has to offer. I got some surprisingly fruity sensations that I couldn't quite identify, but loved anyway. Some beers just make you shake your head and say wow; this was one of those for me. (I later tried the take-home versions. The bottle's good, but the can is a disppointment.)",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,John1985,3.88,"Black opaque color, malty aroma, soft semi-sweet chocolate taste, malty aftertaste. Full bodied, satisfying and smooth but not great. I agree with the other reviews that it was like a tasty chocolate milkshake.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Jordan,4.06,Mmmm.. Gormet chocolates and a bit of roasted nut. Malty & smooth. Burnt cocoa flavors balanced with alchohalic notes. Very filling.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BKotch,4,"Young's best stout in my humble opinion. Great tan head and almost black color. Roasty, chocolatey smells and flavors with only slight dryness in the finish.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,John,4.66,Smooth and luxurious indeed.,Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Todd,4.25,"This is a crazy yummy beer! So damn chocolatey, rich, creamy and smooth ... the complexities are making me drool. And on top of that it's an outstanding stout. A perfect pairing with any dessert, chocolate or on its own. Now available in cans.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mattmaples,4.9,"Yummmy, Yummy, and Yummy. Sweet smooth, by far the best chocolate flavored beer I have ever had. Some have been too dry from too much cocoa powder and some are too damn sweet. This one had a great chocolatey flavor was well as a fine upstanding beer character.  Make no mistake it is not the Chocolate Barley malt giving it that flavor, they throw in chocolate bars in the boil and add essence after filtering. It is a tasty specialty brew.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,mevans05,4.76,"This is a smooooove stout! Chocolate malt gives this beer the taste of a dessert... that you can begin the night with or end the night with. Smell strongly of caramel, with a chocolate malt finish. Medium body. A delight. Can't wait to try the Young's Oatmeal Stout!!!",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Mark,5,"I revise my opinion which was given under anonymous previously. This is the second best stout, giving way only to the incredibly smooth delicious Oatmeal Stout from none other than Youngs. Very pleasing to look at as well as drink. Leaves solid sheets of lace on my Young's glass. These two beers have made me love winter time. Love it on a cold winters night after dinner, with chocolate peanut clusters",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,Brent,4.76,"Very rich, almost like a milkshake. Best as an after-dinner drink.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
664,73,BeerAdvocate,4.45,"Presentation: 500ml brown bottle embossed with a ram and adorned with a purple label.  Appearance: Black and thick with a creamy, bubbly, tan head.  Smell: Roasted and chocolate aromas.  Taste: Extremely smooth and creamy with a chewy, nicely odd, mild sweetness that mingles with a slight burnt/roasted chocolate flavour (big chocolate flavour). An underlying hop flavour balances the malt, showing up about half way thru the taste with a hint of licorice. The mouth is left a bit dry with a lingering note of astringency.  Notes: Hands down, and incredible stout and deadly in its drinkability. Unfortunately a bottle goes for about $3-3.50, making it a brew for special occasions.",Eagle Brewery,"England, United Kingdom",Sweet / Milk Stout,90
