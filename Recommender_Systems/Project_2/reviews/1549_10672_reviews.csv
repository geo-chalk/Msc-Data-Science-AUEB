1549,10672,bowmanad3,4.79,"Review: Look: Black as night. Like motor oil or tar. No head. Smell: coffee, whiskey Taste: incredible. Dark chocolate, coffee, cherries. Feel: impossibly smooth for 14%. Very thick and dense. Creamy syrup. Touch of alcohol burn at the end but does a great job concealing it. Overall: this is a sipper. If you like big stouts and whiskey, you gotta try this beer. Not an every day or after work beer, more of a treat. 5/5",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SpaceCamp,4.47,"L: Pours a dark brown, almost oily and black, into a tulip glass. Forms a moderate mocha head that dissipates fairly quickly. When held up against the light, it is an extremely dark chocolate color.  S: Bourbon barrels, vanilla, oak, raisins, burnt sugar, coffee.  T: Wow. Bourbon and booze. Coffee and roasted malts. Chocolate fudge. Char and a hint of cherries towards the end. Surprisingly sweet in the finish. Incredible.  F: Full bodied. Coating and delicious thick texture, like velvet. Low carbonation.  O: This is one of the better barrel-aged imperial stouts I've had. Hefty ABV and yet smooth and drinkable. Great flavor. Aromas are maybe the weakest link, but that's nitpicking.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,robwired,4.6,This 2022 iteration had no head . Small foam float and lacing. Nose: raisin chocolate coffee bourbon. Flavor: chocolate first then vanilla and bourbon barrel char.

1549,10672,DumbRunner26,4.8,"2022 version. Opaque, but no head. Somewhat fizzy. Honestly I was expecting more on the appearance. Vanilla and bourbon aroma. Wow the bourbon is very noticeable. I love the smell of whiskey, so I love the way this beer smells. The flavor is out of this world. Hard to believe the beer that set the standard for the style is still the standard. Vanilla and bourbon flavored with hints of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, perfect. This is an excellent beer. A true workmanship and craftsmanship.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DarkLordScott,4.84,"Glugs pitch black with a modest layer of foam. Aroma is bourbon (the danger level bourbon - I swear there were klaxons going off), chocolate and dark toffee. Taste is dark fruit, chocolate and bourbon and is oh so nice. From the first sip, this is a sit back with a silly grin on your face kind of beer. Your belly warms from the inside with the swallow and visions of bottles of beer dance in your head. Very, very nice. Do not miss this beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Neelbeer,4.68,"Incredibly rich beer; if aristocrats drank beer, I imagine this is what they would drink. Thick, chocolate followed by vanilla, has that boozy, soy-sauce thing but not too much. Whiskey and toffee. It's definitely an extravagant beer; I wouldn't want to drink it every day. But as dessert (it's almost a meal in itself), it's a real treat.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dwillie733,4.81,"Great tasting borbon stout. The mix of chocolate, bourbon and vanilla work well for a great tasting beer that has no aftertaste. While a little pricey, good for a special occasion.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DavetotheB,4.59,"2022 edition. From a 16.9oz bottle into a snifter.  Pours a fairly thick black with a tiny amount of tan head that fades into a ring on the edge of the glass. No lacing to speak of.  Smells very boozy-strong barrel presence. Also chocolate, coffee and vanilla.  Taste is mostly barrel/bourbon when cold. On warming, this beer really opens up-chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla and light roastiness. Very well-balanced taste.  Drinks so smooth. Thick and full-bodied. Warming from abv. Bourbon aftertaste.  Fabulous brew. Glad I got to share with my dad and sis. Reality is, this is nice for a treat but cost prohibitive-$14/bottle where as you can get KBS and variants for about half that.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,OfficerVZdiver,4.39,"I love this. 2022 is the first I’ve had the privilege to have. Very strong, bourbon like, and smooth.

1549,10672,LeBron_James,4.9,"Finally released the 2022 in my area.  Pours motor oil and is pitch black in the glass. Small head that leaves some lacing.  Smells of chocolate. A ton of chocolate like it's almost overwhelming. I have no idea how there aren't adjuncts in here. Chocolate gets amplified by huge bourbon sweetness. A small amount of barrel comes through. Zero ethanol.  Taste is like a rush of chocolate with mixed in bourbon and oak vanilla. Very pleasant. Lots and lots of umami in here but just barely below the soy sauce threshold which is great. The barrel isn't that present but it's there in the background and on the finish. Great taste.  Very little carbonation which makes this huge gravity beer shine so well. It's like chocolate milk thick with that coating quality you want from good whisky. Really enhances the flavour profile.  So this was $30 for me because the alcohol monopoly just charges that for some reason but honestly it's worth it at least once. The half litre bottles are great and the 2022 release is actually my favourite ever, which might be a hot take. I'm always blown away by how much chocolate comes through on these but the 2022 integrated that flavour better than ever. I think the carbonation was also really excellent this year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Christianriveraaa,4.72,"Look: Poured from a pint and 6 oz bottle - Jet black pour into a 8oz tulip glass. No head risen to the surface on this one. Looks a bit thin for a tough 14.3%. Smell: First smell I got was the bourbon followed by the chocolate, coffee aroma. Definitely getting some toffee and slight vanilla in there as well as hints of dried fruit.. Very nice! Taste: Tastes JUST like the description! Very rich, huge baking chocolate notes with some slight vanilla in there. Getting the chocolate taste first followed by toffee - then the vanilla. Man this is so good!! Feel: Medium bodied to heavy but very little carbonation. Very smooth easy sipper. Overall: I was hesitant paying the amount I did on this bottle but MAN I'm so glad I did. Many beer lovers said this was the beer that turned them into serious beer drinkers and I see why!!! Definitely gonna be buying this tomorrow to store it for a year to see where this can go. This is definitely top three barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and I'm looking forward to trying their coffee version as well!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,cheesetogo,2.85,"Absolutely disgusting. Mouthfeel is beyond thick, my friend aptly compared it to cough syrup. Stuck to the sink when I drained it.

1549,10672,hmf05,4.86,What else can I say about this that hasn't already been said? One of the best beers in the world. Tastes like a chocolate bar. There is definitely coffee and bourbon as well.

1549,10672,5toutman75,4.56,"Bottled 8/13/22  Consumed 11/27/22  How have I never reviewed a BCS yet?! The one and only original bourbon barrel aged stout! This has always been the beer that one should compare barrel aged stouts against as they have continued to produce a high quality product for such a long time. My review is in comparison to so many other barrel aged stouts that I've had now. But I feel that this should get extra marks for being around for so long and helping me love a good craft beer. It probably also accounts for at least 25 lbs on my frame. So how's the beer? Well I opened a 12oz 2022 release that has the marks of a Willet barrel, so this isn't a ""regular"" BCS. Next time I open one of these, I'll open it with a regular 500ml bottle to see how they're different. Look: It looks super thick and dark. When I first started drinking this, I thought it was motor oil and looked gross. Now I think it could look even thicket. It's still a beautiful beer for a stout. Smell: Here this one is a bit lacking for me to be world class. I'm not smelling a lot! I smell bourbon (which is great) but I don't get a lot on the nose. Other ba stouts have surpassed BCS now. Taste: This Willet barrel version is superb as always. The base version doesn't get the props it is due since Goose is always releasing some other variant for an insane price. Some other variants are better (the two double barrels '19 being the very pinnacle, blantons, and birthday coming in a close 2nd for me) but don't lose sight of the base version! There's a ton of barrel which I LOVE. It is sweet (more than a regular Russian Imperial Stout) but balanced and definitely not a pastry stout. It'll finish more dry than sweet which is a nice trick. The beer is also filling as a stout should be. The finish is long. It's a beer that people who don't love bourbon should not like. Feel: Thick, gooey, sweet, and full. It could even be a bit fuller for me, but that's a personal preference. Overall: A world class ba stout. I'll try to add updates comparing the other easter egg barrels if I get a chance. This Willet barrel shines though with a bit of spiciness on the tongue and tons of barrel character.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mothmanscott,4.52,"This review, written November 27th of 2022, is based on a properly cellared bottle of 2019 vintage:  Pours a murky, prune juice deep brown or black. Passing a bright beam of light into it reveals little in terms of clarity or highlights. The pour produces a short finger of foamy, shortlived mocha head that leaves little in the way of surface cap, collar or lace. In my opinion it is the low point of this beer. Aroma is rich chocolate, sour coffee, vanilla/oak, bourbon and leather, with hints of anise as well as dried raisins and other dark fruits. There's a very faint hint of something maple like. Alcohol is detectable in the nose but remarkably subdued for such a high ABV. It does however become more evident as the brew warms. Taste is extra rich, dark semi-sweet chocolate, Hershey's Chocolate syrup, brown sugar, toffee woody vanilla, bourbon, dried fig and prune, earthy hints appear with light pepper in the finish; a mild bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Alcohol becomes apparent by mid-sip and blossoms from there. It is most likely responsible for, or at least a strong contributor to, the earthy presence and runs the spectrum of flavor/spice, warmth and bitterness all melding in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, very smooth, silky and at the risk of being redundant creamy. Very warming in the mouth & throat especially in in the latter half of the sip & aftertaste. Its reputation is well deserved.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Kentster,4.68,"2021 Vintage $30 CAD bottle of beer to go with a hockey game? Why not! Yeah it’s tasty! But not as tasty as the 2020? It’s incredibly deceptive at its 14.4%.

1549,10672,KurtisTMcCafferty,5,"Stouts, especially Imperial Stouts, are my favorite style, so I try them whenever I can. Even though Bourbon County changes slightly every year, for me it is the zenith, the benchmark against all others are judged. The viscosity is delightful; other Imperial Stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. And the complexity is amazing. I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. People are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer! Every year, my friends and I buy up as much as we can get our hands on. And if you can find it on tap, I like it even better.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Deude_of_Mann,4.84,"This review is based on a 2020 label date opened in 2022, stored under dark refrigeration. This beer ages well, no doubt.  Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head.  Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here.  Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""  Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)  I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate.  I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Mikecap42,5,"A: when pored the appearance is as black as can be. This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.  S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.  T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer.  M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,  O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank.

1549,10672,adamette,4.3,"Goose Island Bourbon County Stout Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle. A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5 S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5 T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5 M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5 D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The only even slightly negative thing i could say about it is that it may be a slight bit too thick to drink at any time. If i was full i dont know that id enjoy one.

Taste is heavy on the bourbon, with figs, honey, and chocolate, followed by roasted malt and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak come and go. The bourbon really dominates, more than just about any other BA stout I’ve had. Feel is a bit oily, and the alcohol warmth approaches that of a wine. I understand why it’s a classic.

S: Nice aroma akin to the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. The mixture of malty stout and bourbon is heavenly. T: This isn't an overly complex stout, and it delivers very well on what it promises. Malt, bourbon, and stout. This isn't too say that nothing else is going on. There are underlying flavors that play well together, and the concert of all the flavors together are well-balanced. F: Thick and smooth! Matches the look beautifully. O: I love this beer. I scored it shy of perfect because I want there to be even more of everything I described.

1549,10672,CastleBravo,4.32,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!  Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.  The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else.  This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me.

This is nothing but a coca-cola Chinese version of the most disgusting beer i have ever had, I bought 1 bottle of the Cherry Stout and Brand Stout.

1549,10672,highdesertdrinker,4.64,"The original and I’ve reviewed a few variants over the years but not this one amazingly. It pours a dark brownish black with a decent tan head for a big stout. It smells of whiskey, and bourbon, barrel, wood, vanilla, anise. Tastes the same; barrel, bourbon, vanilla, anise, some hops that round out a panoply of flavors. It’s the original, huge, badass stout and still one of the best. I’ve enjoyed catching up with this every Black Friday for several years and it never disappoints. It ages well but drink it fresh, cheers",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,aklavall,4.98,"2021 vintage. Pours jet black with half a finger of tan head.  Smells absolutely amazing and complex. Hits me first with dark chocolate then fades into vanilla and dark fruits like plum.  Taste follows the nose, hits with chocolate, vanilla, and plum. Has some acidity and tartness almost like a wine.  This is definitely the most complex beer I've had. Lots going on but in a good way.

1549,10672,brewskis,4.56,"2021 vintage. Bottled 8/31/21.  Pours pretty much pitch black with less than a finger of dark mocha head that dissipates quickly. When swirling it around the glass, it fully coats it and leaves tons of alcohol legs. Looks like your classic BCBS.  Aroma is also your classic Bourbon County smell, but I get a lot more dark fruit than expected. Almost port wine-like. Blackberry, fig, date, plum, caramel, oak tannin, bakers chocolate, molasses, some oatmeal raisin cookie, tobacco, roasted malt, some vanilla, bourbon.  Taste pretty much follows the nose, elevated dark fruit and all. Blackberry jam, plum, fig, raisin, some caramel, toffee, burnt sugar, charred oak tannin, bakers chocolate, bittersweet chocolate chip, molasses, tobacco, roasted malt, vanilla, fairly smooth bourbon presence but there is some heat as expected fresh. As always, has a nice balance of sweet to dry notes. As it warms, the chocolate, sweeter notes, and barrel come through more, leaving the dark fruit in the background.  High medium body to low full body. Slick, oily, sticky.  Another great vintage as I knew it would be. The consistency year in and year out (other than the nightmare 2015 infected release) is excellent.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

No lacing to speak of. With every sip, a slicked caramel oil is left clinging to the inside of the glass for a moment.  The aroma is complex to say the least. I get raisin, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, and oak/charred wood. My grandma has a place in Arizona and she occasionally will bring me home some dried dates. That candied, dried fruit aroma is there as well.  Taste follows suit in much of the same aspects. Dried fruit on the front, morphing to a burnt sugar/caramel and vanilla, and settling on barrel and alcohol notes on the finish.  The feel of this beer is thick and oily. Mouth coating in the best of ways. I love it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,ZenAgnostic,5,"2020 vintage marked on label. Drink by 22JUN25 printed on bottom of back label, so I've got 4 years to finish it. Bottle picked up at liquor store for $10.99. Poured into Duvel tulip.  Appearance - Absolutely pitch black body; not even a single ray of light passes through, even with a phone's flashlight held touching the glass on the backside. Fine lacing with a fine and even stick. Bottle says to enjoy in a snifter -- close enough. 5  Smell - Strong alcohol at first, but still alluring because of the dark roasted character. Almost a little winey. Perhaps little too sharp at first, but mellows and rounds out to perfection after a couple minutes in the glass. 5  Taste - Amazing balance. Was expecting something as sharp as the nose suggests it would be, but it's actually much more smooth. Sure, there's a lot of alcohol up front, along with dark smoky malt and even some lighter, sweeter fruit and vinousness. That bourbon comes in smooth. This is almost like a barelywine without the harshness. 5  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Warm and gets even warmer in the back of the throat and chest as well. 5  Overall - Delicious. Deserves its best in class score for its style. Not exactly as delicious as a KBS or CBS but has no faults to speak of, and a lot of strengths going for it. 5",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Scent is very, very bourbon heavy along with notes of burnt sugars, vanilla, and molassess. Taste is much more on the sweet (caramel, butterscotch) than alcohol side, although the high ABV really bleeds into the aftertaste.

The original bourbon barrel aged stout that so many others have copied. I finally found it in a local shop I’ve never been in before and they had six on the shelf. $15. I am drinking the regular flagship 2020 vintage so the bottle isn’t very old. Poured out into a snifter as suggested a deep dark brown with very little head retention. Smell is absolutely delectable. One of the best smelling beers I’ve experienced. It’s very richly bourbon, sugary, maple syrup and molasses. Just wonderful. Really makes me want to drink it. So I do. And it’s fanfuckingtastic. Rich fudge, maple, chocolate, vanilla, smoked out leather. And a huge chord of warming bourbon that fills the mouth a good half minute after swallowing. And mouthfeel is thick and juicy, moderate carbonation. Overall I’m impressed, and I love big stouts like this so I’ve had a fair number to compare it to. This brew is like an old rich guys high backed leather chair sitting in front of the fire wearing an ascot and smoking a fine cigar kind of delicious.

Equal proportions in the taste, sweet and savory, complex albeit comprehensible. Bourbon's mellower compared to a new bottle, the soy sauce develops over time.  Very smooth mouthfeel, enough malt and oatmeal to give it medium body. There is an echo of bourbon in the finish.  Three years seems a good age, it's balanced to me. I sipped and savored it.

Taste: betrays the nose in a good way; bourbon is still heavily present, but so is a delicious chocolate sweetness, despite no additives of my knowledge. Not quite as flavored as KBS or something like that, but as a result tastes more ""natural."" Very well balanced between boozy and dessert.  Feel: Super thick, as expected from a 14+% beer. Regardless, it goes down smooth and there is little in the way of alcohol burn  Overall: Among the best when it comes to BBA beers.

1549,10672,SaltofOH,4.33,"Bottle dated 9-08-17. GLBC Snifter.  A: pours a completely opaque black, with the thinnest of dark brown lacing that fades quickly.  S: rich, roasty malt with a load of boozy, savory, smoky sweetness. That savory/umami note really comes out in aged RIS’s for me, and this is no exception. The typical hotness of a bourbon barrel aged RIS is absent.  T: sweet, roasty, bourbon, dark roasted malt, alcohol, umami. Drink it too fast and the alcohol becomes more pronounced. Truth be told, I love RIS’s, but don’t really love BBA stouts. The bourbon tastes and beery tastes don’t mesh well to me, especially with age. Too young, and the bourbon is too strong; too old, and the stout takes on that soy sauce/umami character.  M: velvet-smooth delivery. Lacks the warming alcoholic punch of some other BBA RIS’s I’ve tried, even though the ABV is higher!  O: I was saving this for a special occasion, and figured it’s 2020, so YOLO, and I want to drink less in 2021, anyway. High alcohol, complex, almost certainly will leave me feeling like crap tomorrow. Great for what it is, but I’ll pass.  Glad I tried it, glad I had the experience, but beer and bourbon are different animals for me; I enjoy them both, but not together.

A: The beer is a pitch black color with a dark brown head that raised up quickly and dissipated just as fast.  S: Wood, bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, slight hints of coffee, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, burnt sugar - one step past caramel.  T: I winced the first time sipping this, expecting a huge bourbon taste, but it was a bit more mellow than I expected. The bourbon character is there, but balanced by more malt and toasty notes like caramel and bitter chocolate/cocoa powder. I thought it would be a bit harsh in the finish but it really smoothed out and left a pleasant caramel or dark chocolate taste in my mouth that I really wasn't expecting. A good tasting beer for sure.  F: Coating. A bit of a burn in there for sure, leaving a tingle on the tongue after drinking.  Overall: This was a well-balanced beer, and deservedly one of the best. I thought it was actually more mellow than many other bourbon barrel stouts, which seem to be all the rage right now. The mellow character actually works in this beer's favor - definitely present but not overpowering. That goes for the alcohol content as well - it is apparent, but not in your face, making a surprisingly drinkable beer. I think I actually prefer this one over KBS for that reason, a lot more is going on than just the bourbon barrel.

1549,10672,hoptheology,4.43,"2020. 14.6%, Drink by 22 Jun 2025.  Pours an impressive black as night body with an even more impressive lasting 2 finger head. I can't believe how much head retention this has. It's not going anywhere. I'll bet they used more black patent this time. Due to the head retention despite its ABV & barrel aging, I must give this a 5.  The aroma from the bottle is sharp and biting, bringing loads of caramel and almond, with undertones of smoke, blueberries, molasses, cannabis, and dark chocolate. From the glass it's ironically more metallic. Swirling brings that marvelous head back. I can't say enough about it. I still get lots of heavy caramel from the glass and a new note - booze.  Flavor is very different from years' past. Sweeter. A little ruder. Molasses and dark chocolate hit first, with smoke intermingling. Medium palate brings fig and raisin, with slight nuts, a whisper of caramel, and finally a finish of - wait for it - fruitcake. Lingering elements of smoke come out here and there - breaths of what I would call a, ""dark chocolate cigar"".  Feel is slick and smooth, a little thinner than years' past (perhaps on par with 2016 and 2017), but the oatmeal creaminess is still there. Has a very resinous finish, coats it on thick, much like a Russian Imperial Stout would, with lingering boozy heat and light stickiness.  Overall, another absolute banger in the BCBS anthology - though this one is a bit strange with its fruitcake oddities. I did like 2019 a bit better, and it looks like I skipped a few years with posting my reviews. I'll have to update that as I'm sure I have it written down somewhere. Solid beer, absolutely buy it, but try one bottle before you stock up endlessly on 2020's iteration.  5, 4.5, 4.25, 4.5, 4.5   2016 :  Black of course, no head  Aroma of maple, brown sugar, molasses, fig, and whiskey.  Lots of bourbon and honey sweetness with mild dirt, molasses, and dark cherry.  Feel is thinner than last year with some serious burning.  Last year's was better but this ain't no slouch.  3, 4.25, 4, 4, 4.   2015.  Black as black can be. Diminutive head forms and fades away real quick. Appearance ends up looking like Coca Cola. Eh.  The aroma is intoxicating, and I mean that literally. Smells like a straight shot of Jack Daniels. Trailing behind are syrupy sap straight from the tree, melted sticky plum, and french pressed coffee aromas.  Wow. If this isn't complex, I don't know what is. Quite possibly the most complex beer I've ever laid lips to, and out of 800 some odd trials, that's quite a feat. Oddly enough it's still easily drinkable, and by that I mean sippable. Bourbon County manages to do away with lingering bitterness or off-flavors. A total array of chocolate, cream, milk, caramels, sugared plum, coffee, dried figs - all swirling at once taking turns like the Knights of the Round Summon in Final Fantasy VII. This is a beer that if you simply take a shot glass sized sample, you get the full gammut and you know right off the bat what this beer has to offer. If you don't like this you either hate stouts or you've got a bad batch (known to happen). The fading flavors are perfectly done morning coffee, a touch of acidity, and bourbon-soaked plums.  The feel is nothing short of substantial. It just destroys the palate with syrup and a stickiness rivaling caramel apples. This is a palate wrecker in the sense that it doesn't scrub your tongue, it invades it.  Overall Bourbon County seemed to be not worth the hype until I laid lips to it. I paid $13.99 for this bottle and I feel it was a bit stiff, but on the flipside you could spend that on a 12 pack of Budweiser and not get 1/4 of the experience presented here. I'll be having this again next year.

1549,10672,TooManyGlasses,4.81,"2018 version (15.2% ABV) consumed on Black Friday here in northern Alberta - 2020 released today - so many reasons why it is out of reach for us north of the 49th at this time so decided to enjoy a cellar treasure. Pours a thick black with a scant half finger of short lived reddish brown head. The smell is intoxicating - boozy yes but wonderful notes of caramel, chocolate, coffee, vanilla and oaky notes with the bourbon - just a hint of smokiness. Taste follows with rich and creamy bourbon soaked vanilla, caramel, sweet coffee, and chocolate. Hints of the oak and a subtle smoky note appear as it warms. The alcohol is not hiding but not in any way overpowering. Rich thick and smooth full mouthfeel - carbonation muted but perfectly present - a boozy warmth envelopes the palate leaving with a creamy delicious sweetness.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Craigah508,5,"Just tried the 2020 bottle, and by golly that was amazing.  I poured only a little into a glass, about two shot glasses worth just to see it and drank the rest out of the bottle.  It was a dark deep brown in color with a khaki head, it smelled of oak and chocolate, with a slight alcohol aroma.. the whiskey barrels I’m sure.  It was viscous and heavy but easy to put down... and while it had a whiskey smell it wasn’t an overpowering alcohol taste.  It filled your mouth with strong flavors of chocolate, earthy qualities, and woody features.. finishing with the slightest alcohol taste.  Probably one of IF NOT the best beer I’ve had. Recently having tried and geeked over the Christmas Bomb by Prairie artisan beers for taking that title, this godsend by Goose Island was extremely drinkable, while Packing a good punch.

Chocolate, toffee, coffee, tobacco and smoke, bourbon with that sweetness that isn't overpowering. There's fruit that layers under this, raisins and dark plums or cherries. This opens up and changes as it warms from the fridge in your snifter. The alcohol is there if you really look for it, but if you're enjoying it and not paying for it, you may miss it.  Taste: mirrors the smell, less complex than the smell, but because the smell has just so much there. There's a soft alcohol at the end of it, but hidden and subtle unless you're sensitive to it. Has layers that unfold with warming toward room temp, smoky and wood, tobacco, bourbon, sweet fruit.  Feel: Thick feel that coats your mouth and lingers enough to enjoy but isn't heavy. Carbonation is there, but just a bit to lighten it. Can make other beers seem light and watery in comparison.  Overall: one of my favorites, even though this type wasn't my thing before it.

It is complex and young at the same time, which gives great anticipation of trying this aged next year. Goose Island does not lose a step, year over year, on creating a fantastic stout.  2020: It still had its soft/tangy/dark fruit profile but was much more nuanced than when tried last year.  2019: The strongest of the three, really bringing the booziness. It is also has the highest carbonation in its young age. The wonderful BCBS profile is there and really taps into the dark caramel profile. Rating: 91  2018: My favorite of the three. So much dark fruit in this batch and it has a thick, full body. Most complex as well, with a beautiful syrupy finish on each sip.

1549,10672,Rug,4.52,"2019 vintage, best by 6/29/24  Here we are. A beer that sits amongst the best of the best, currently at number 24 on this site. I've actually sampled this before. It was my friends birthday and I wanted to get him something nice, so I grabbed him a bottle of this, but that left me without enough money to get a bottle for myself. Needless to say, my generous friend poured me a bit and I loved it, though I did not review it  This beer pours a velvety black with just a finger of brown head that quickly fades to a ring, leaving legs behind instead of lacing  The aroma really is something to marvel at. Intensely complex and constantly toeing the line between sweet and roasty. For starters, I get sweet bourbon, vanilla, chewy caramel, and oak. Some less obvious notes include medium roast coffee, raisin, maple syrup, dark breads, and a surprisingly small trace of alcohol  I don't think this beer ever really settles down on one set of flavors, rather it redefines itself throughout the entire bottle. Starting off with smoky malt, sweet bourbon and a touch of alcohol heat, this lets you know its' strength. However, this mellows out nicely on the swallow. After that, notes of caramel, raisin, cinnamon, dark chocolate, and coffee are wrapped up in a smooth, buttery oak. Again, every sip here seems to be unique, and I picked up on additional flavors of walnut, banana, plum, and nutmeg  Obviously this is a full bodied beer, borderline decadent dessert. When you pair this with an almost complete lack of carbonation (other than the tingle from the alcohol) you end up with a beer meant to be savored. Rich and chewy in the finish, coating the mouth completely after every sip  Absolutely indulgent stout right here. It's crazy that one of the highest rated beers in the world is so readily available (and reasonably priced at $10/0.5 L). I intend to pick up more bottles when I see it around and need something solid to fall back on. I plan on keeping this review going with every new vintage I have. Cheers!!  ————————————————————  EDIT 11/28/21: 2021 vintage best by 8/4/26  I’m happy to have found a fresh base BCBS this year, having only had one with a year of age on it before. Let’s see how that changes it  The pour is similar this time, but leaves much better lacing, bumping from 4.25 to 4.5 in my head  Honestly the nose here is almost exactly the same as what I described above. I would have to have them side by side to say for certain, but I think the bourbon is a little more prevalent in this one  Holy hell, this is way hotter in taste when it’s fresh. A bit less of the smoke I got in the last bottle, but everything else here is similar just stronger. I think I definitely prefer it with a bit of age on it  The body is pretty much the same, but the heat does detract a bit  Yeah, I think 1 year is the best time to drink this (of what I’ve had so far). I don’t think it’s really batch variability as I’ve heard they’re pretty consistent across the years. I know this year had a 14% version and a 14.4% version, this one being the 14% version. Also this beer moved down a spot on the top rankings here, from #24 to #25",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I’m embarrassed to admit that I spent too many of my formative beer drinking years drinking light beers and run of the mill pilsners and lagers.  Came upon this beer last winter and the bottle captured my eye. It had to be something special right? I brought the bottle home and ceremoniously poured it into a snifter.  It poured a dark velvety almost obsidian color with almost no head and very little chestnut colored lacing.  On the nose you get hints of banana bread, chocolate and bourbon.  As another reviewer wrote, the taste is sublime and ever-changing. This beer will taste different with every sip as the beer begins to acclimate to room temperature. You’ll taste bananas foster, cacao, vanilla and coffee, all in various tones. The ABV is almost undetectable and makes this world class beer a true champion belly warmer.

Immediate bourbon if you have your nose close, chocolate... toffee? Sugar? Some sort of perhaps vanilla? Eye opener. Taste: Oh my. Can I buy InBev stock now? Ruined most other beers with first sip. Do not rush this one... sip. Your tastebuds will be busy breaking down everything... till your next sip. Surprising how well the bourbon is wrapped in this craft beer. Mouthfeel: This one sticks around long after the last drop, pleasantly. Overall: A delicious velvet wrapped hammer with lingering pleasure long after the bottle is empty. Dangerously drinkable, the high ABV is well hidden. Interesting to note the taste expands as it warms. This is not a chuggable brew, nor should you want it to be.

1549,10672,just1cho,4.28,"*Bourbon County Brand Stout 2019*  *Poured into a Teku glass from a 16.9oz bottle*  This beer poured pitch black into my glass and had a khaki colored lacing. Unfortunately, the beer had no head. I'm not sure what contributed to the lack of head, but my guess would be the high ABV.  The aroma on this was a lot more balanced than what I initially expected; a very barrel-forward beer. Upfront, I got notes of bourbon, molasses, burnt brown sugar, and a sharp soy sauce aroma. The soy sauce was a bit off-putting, but I tried to ignore this obvious oxidation off-aroma while trying to pick out all of the nuanced aromas from this beer. Unfortunately, I didn't get a whole lot of complexity from the aroma since the soy sauce was a bit too strong in the front end. But, I was able to get some nice and mellow milk chocolate and dark fruit notes in the back-end.  The taste followed the nose, but w/o the soy sauce. Notes from the barrel were a lot more prominent here in the taste than on the nose upfront. Supported by a strong oak, bourbon, and espresso-like roasty backbone throughout, the beer definitely showed a lot more complexity in the taste than the aroma. The strong bourbon taste upfront eventually evolved to prominent notes of burnt brown sugar, dark fruits, dark chocolate and earthy espresso in the middle and finish.  The feel on this was satisfyingly full bodied, almost sticky-like, with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer was smooth to drink but definitely was very boozy and bitter, with a long bitter aftertaste. The notable alcoholic taste will constantly remind you to sip and enjoy this beer over-time.  Overall, I really enjoyed drinking this beer. But, the constant soy sauce aroma that wafted into my nose every time I went to take a sip really knocked the experience down a little bit for me. I would definitely drink and buy this again, but hopefully one w/o the off-aromas.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This award winner pours a rich obsidian with a nice head of brown foam that settles to a thick ring, thin light film, and displays some very nice lacing.

Smell- Caramel/toffee type malts, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, bourbon and oak, roasted nuts, licorice, toasted dark bread and dark fruits (raisins and dates), a bit of vanilla, light spice notes.  Taste- Rich caramel malt, bourbon and oak, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and dried dark fruits, licorice, roasted nuts, burnt sugar, light spicy hops and a bit of cherry.  Feel- Medium/heavy bodied with an incredibly smooth, creamy texture. Moderately bitter finish, soft carbonation on the tongue.

1549,10672,PathofChaos,4.97,"Appearance: A jet black so impenetrable it repels the light. Nimbus foam rises from its secretive depths and looms like a mocha thunderhead over total darkness. Then, much like a powerful storm, those thick clouds vanish as quickly as they arrived, leaving a sparse, drizzled lacing in their wake.  Bouquet: Dark fruits and powdery baker's chocolate dominate, followed by a dreamy blend of vanilla latte, caramel macchiato, and newly sanded oak.  Feel: A lush, full body of heavenly satin. Imperceptible carbonation. Finishes with a dry, bourbon heat that warms your chest after each swallow. Absolutely decadent.  Taste: Cocoa-dusted figs, Arabic black coffee, and an assortment of dried stone fruits like plums and sugar dates. Spiced rum and plump raisins present themselves at the mid-point. Then the indulgent ensemble is paraded into greater complexity by creamy vanilla, sticky toffee, and a warming, bourbon-kissed oak that glides on by like a hazy summer breeze.  Overall: Divinity in a glass. Blatantly worthy of its World Class score on Beer Advocate. Its character matures gracefully when aged, but its sweeter flavors are more prevalent if enjoyed fresh. When aged, a black licorice flavor begins to seep in.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste follows the smell. Very sweet and quite boozy. Chocolate is more present in the taste than the smell. The booze doesn’t hit as hard as I expected, but it is still strong and maybe just a little overpowering. That said, this is easily in my top 10 favorite beers as of right now.  Feel: a bit syrupy overall, but it is quite smooth. Carbonation is low. It’s not an easy drinker at almost 15%, but it’s not ridiculously heavy either.  Overall, my goodness this is an amazing stout.

The taste is decadent chocolate fudge with additional notes of toffee, dried fruit, coffee and vanilla before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is very full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. There's a little boozieness, but it's well integrated and fits the style.

I wish I would have let it sit for a while to give it time to age into its fullest potential (or had the change to drop on two of them) but I'm going to give this one a shot as is.  Look is black with a brown/tan head which receeded fairly quickly. Smell is of sweet malt, bourbon, and maybe a little bit of plum.  Taste is outstanding, although I'm a little bit out of my element having not been drinking for months. Heavy malt and bourbon flavor, little bit of that dark fruit/plum thing that I had picked up on too. That bit of alcohol burn one is to expect from such a big barrel aged beer. Medium dry finish. Low but present carbonation, which was noticeable in the dissipating head but not so much in the feel.  Overall really satisfied with this 500ml beer. It is the definition of a one and done for me, a little expensive but definitely very high quality. Would have liked to see what cellaring could have done to develop the beer. Still, what a great choice to reign in 250 reviews. Cheers folks",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Whyteboar,4.89,"This is currently my favorite BA Stout, I've had one fresh (2018) and one (2017) that had been stored a while in the cellar and both were quite good. Not sure if it's a Founders Brewing thing or what, but their BA stuff seems too 'hot' or bright when fresh, but tend to age very well. Goose Island however seems to have the knack of getting it right from the get go. Not bright/harsh/hot and full of discernible and enjoyable flavors. The price (and availability) keeps me from buying more, but when I do open one from the cellar it's always very appreciated. By the way, it's my observation that different years releases taste different, and the same beer will taste different in a different year. The beer changes and your palate changes. So I hope at some point this site will allow multiple reviews for a given beer because they are not necessarily the same year to year.

When poured, it gave off a 1 1/2” head comprised of even and tiny carbonation bubbles. The body is rich and rather think. Pitch black in color with no separation on the sides of the glass with swirls. The smell after pouring presents more of a cherry taste. But, it still smells as if the beer has definitely been swimming in a barrel for a long time. For, it gives off a hint of burnt oak behind the primary flavors. By the third sip, one can detect more of a hint of bitterness sliding along with chocolate and a nutty flavor. It goes down smooth. No notes, tangs, nor barbs. The initial sweetness eventually gives way to more of the expected taste of bourbon with each sip. Heavy yet light taste all the way around. Overall, this is one of the smoothest beers I’ve had in a long time. Not sure if I can wrap my head around the dominant cherry flavor though. For, I tend to prefer a more bitter beer.

Strong bourbon aroma. At nearly 15%, aroma is incredibly boozy. Taste is very strong. Hige hits of bourbon, coffee, and chocolate. Incredibly roast. Would not believe 60ibu.

It caught my eye at the store and I love stouts. Alright, so I poured from a refrigerated bottle into a regular glass. Poured with very little head, and upon finishing the pour and turning the glass upright again is when a small medium brown head showed up. It was smell and dissipated to one side of the glass quickly. 3 mins after the pour there is no head whatsoever. The beer color is black, straight black. During the pour it looked beautiful, like crude oil. Sitting here next to me without the head, it looks exactly like a glass of Pepsi.  Smell - honestly I mostly smell raisin/dark fruit and malts. I am getting a whiff of dark chocolate in there as well. I don't smell coffee or caramel. Taste is - upfront - dark chocolate and raisin. Finishes with a toffee vanilla kind of mix as it rolls back of the tongue. The feel really is astounding, it is SO smooth and silky! I have never had a silkier beer than this. It's probably my favorite part actually.  Overall, I like this beer. The flavors are complex and you taste them in waves, making for a pleasing experience.

Brandied fruit, figs, some vanilla and oak. Fair amount of hops bitterness on the backend. Relatively clean finish.  Mouthfeel: thick, thick, milkshake like. Moderate carbonation. Coats the tongue but not cloying, finishes pretty clean. Perfect.  Overall: this is still the standard for BBA stouts",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Yooper_textured_flavor,3.63,"Have been waiting to try this but very hard to find in the UP of Michigan. From tap in snifter.  2019 from keg at local grill.  I am slightly disappointed, as many other stouts have more layers of flavor and overall higher quality. Strong boozy flavor and somewhat hot at 14.7 abv. I suspect this will age better and be much more in line with expectations after cellaring if you get this in a bottle.  Not a huge amount of flavor separation found in other stouts (CBS, KBS, Epic Baptista line, Avery) but solid nonetheless. Thickness is up front. Flavor is secondary. For all of those who are detailing the different flavors and notes.......we didn’t have it in this batch. Two ordered with friends and all had the same results. We drink and cellar a ton of high quality stout (I have 80+ bombers of CBS 2017/2018 and 6 cases of 2017/2018 KBS, 100 other bombers of a wide range of breweries). This was good. But not up to the hype.  Try it and see. I suspect the aged bottles are a better and more complex flavor.

1549,10672,Pegasus,4.53,"Appearance: Deep, dark amber body, with a modest, very dense tan head, with superb persistence. Thick, absolutely unbroken, fine-beaded lacing adorns the glass walls.  Aroma: Very strong notes of bourbon, wood, and alcohol dominates the aroma. The nose is profoundly spicy, with vanilla, dark molasses, brown sugar, and oak wood being extraordinarily prominent., but, most especially sweet, vinous alcohol, and vanilla beans.  Taste: Opens with strong notes of oak wood and sweet alcohol, soon followed by brown sugar and molasses. Coffee notes are present, in modest amounts. The oak-like wood provides a gracious backdrop, which lingers throughout the taste, as do the sweet undercurrents of alcohol. As the taste draws to a close, the strong notes of molasses and alcohol intensify, bringing the taste to a memorable close.  Mouth feel: Smooth, extraordinarily full, and absolutely gracious, no less than stellar in its presentation.  Drinkabilty/notes: A beer that would stagger the drinker by its utter greatness,, all the while being attainable for most, due to widespread availability and a reasonable price.

1549,10672,Nuttin_but_the_best_Clark,4.5,"First off let me say that I'm not a stout guy normally. It's too syrupy and one gives me a buzz and two gives me a headache usually. However, I am sucker for chocolate so I find myself drinking stouts on occasion. My favorite is Founders' KBS which adds a little liccorice/Basil taste into theirs. I also like Belching Beaver Chocolate Peanut Butter stout.  At $12 per bottle (and the bottle looks bigger than the content is) for a little over a pint, this stuff better be great. It is the OG chocolate stout having been one of the first premium 'wait in line' seasonally released beers. This is before Budweiser bought them out which drove a stake into the heart of craft beer lovers everywhere. Thankfully the process of making this seems not to have been too corporatized although they do crank out quite a few more bottles these days making it less hard to find.  Each year varies and each year has 2-4 editions. Mine is the 2018 standard edition. I understand 2018 was a good year for this. It has a bitter chocolate taste with a little creaminess. The bourbon barrel comes through with a molasses taste followed by a bit of medicinal alchohol notes. It's smoother than some bourbon barrel aged stouts but lacks a bit of that licorice punch of KBS. I think those who prefer a sweeter creamier stout will like this. The cheaper stouts almost have a salty soy sauce aftertaste to them but not this.  The mouthfeel is fantastic and makes it fun to drink. The light head is not bubbly and soapy looking, its more dense although not too heavy or thick. Scent wise you get chocolate, coffee and toasted coconut. It looks great in a glass ... blackish brown.  Overall, this is well balanced and fairly smooth and no one note steps out and overpowers the other notes. It's not offensive but at the same time there's nothing unique about this and sings to me that I should buy another bottle for $12. The reputation and name here is what makes the price so high and I don't feel as though I have to buy another bottle. At $20 for a 4 pack, it would be good. At $50 for a 4 pack, I'm glad I tried it but don't need to stock it for regular drinking.  The upside is such a high ABV means that one gets me a bit floaty and buzzed up ... in fact one of the nicer buzzes I've experienced from a single bottle of beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste of purple grapes soaked in the bourbon oak barrel. Big vanilla and caramel components, with a supporting smokiness. Rich dark roasted malts.

The 2016 vintage presented as thinner and with dark fruit expressions. The 2017 vintage lacked the warmness and smoothness of the 2018 vintage.

1549,10672,beersampler6,4.51,"Review #600  Delicious imperial stout that really lives up to its hype - although I gave it almost straight 4.5s all the way through, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't going to reach the 4.6-4.7 range beer that I was expecting, especially given that this was a 2016 vintage that I'd specifically aged a few more months just to wait as long as I could. Looks great, nice deep dark rich black color with a little tan lingering head and just a hint of some spotty lingering lacing. Would have given it more points if it had nicer-looking lacing, but I gave an extra 0.25 for the richness of the color and of the tan head. Smells great, lots of dark mocha fudge, vanilla, medium roast coffee, roasted nuttiness, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, fig, oak, bourbon and some toffee. Aromas blended well together and the smell was just heavenly. Taste follows the nose, and again that rich chewy fudge, vanilla, oak and bourbon is just so well-balanced. There was a little alcohol upfront as the beer warmed, but not aggressively so, and the very high ABV always felt deceivingly well-hidden. Smooth, rich, chewy, thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just enough carbonation to match the depth of this stout. I really enjoyed it, wish I had more bottles to sample and savor at a later date, and couldn't recommend this beer more highly. It paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert.

There's dried fruit, ripe plums, grapes, vanilla, oak, brown sugar and smokey, roasted malts.  Taste: It's extremely sweet but with a hint of bitterness. There's vanilla, cinnamon, roasted malt, dark chocolate and a slight alcohol bite on the back of the tongue.  Mouthfeel: It's thick, rich, oily and with a distinct silkiness from the sweetness. It's not cloying at all and the carbonation is low.  Overall: A strong and complex beer that needs time to be truly understood and appreciated. It's also very versatile and pairs well with a wide variety of food and desserts.

Taste is rich and smooth up front with just a touch of boozy heat on the back end. Bitter chocolate is much more prominent than in the nose, dark fruit much less present. Chocolate is in fact quite dominant. There seems to be a bit of detectable barrel (although it's faint enough for me that I can imagine it is psychosomatic) and with a bit of wine-snob aeration in the mouth the bourbon is easily detectable. Mouthfeel is amazing. Truly lovely body that is certainly dominant on the palate but doesn't seem to build up too much. Overall I am genuinely impressed. This is one that you hear so much about that it is hard to go into it without preconceptions.

1549,10672,DamonsCorner,1.34,"I tried. I truly did try. My father had the misfortune of purchasing one of these during thanksgiving of 2018. Immediately disposed of it after drinking. However, as I’m into much stronger stouts than he is, I figured I’d give it a shot.  Hands down the worst substance to ever neglect my tongue. Taste was of pure soy sauce, with hints of vanilla bean and cheap bourbon flavoring. 2018 is an absolute bust.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jpkand,4.39,"Pours a jet black with slow forming light brown head that looks dense and delicious. Aged oak, caramel, vanilla, and slight applewood smoke on the nose.  On the palate I first noticed the wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. Bourbon hits in the front and the mid, with a sweet smokiness on the end. It's a strong taste, and if you're looking for a bourbon barrel stout you shouldn't be disappointed. It's big and festive, great for the season. Would go very well as an after dinner beer if you're skipping dessert (with a sweet, I'd find it too cloying).  Even though I feel like I'm more over the bourbon barrel craze each year, this is one that makes you stop and appreciate the arc of American craft beer in the last 15-20 years",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,BB1313,4.49,"2018 vintage. Bottled on 9/17/18. 16.9oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours almost black with some brown hues; dark khaki head that fades nice retention and lacing. The aromas are balanced, but pretty bold. The bourbon comes through along with some chocolate. Hints of caramel along with some mild hints of vanilla. It has a chocolate chip cookie vibe going on. Some char and peat most in the mix. Some oak. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose, but are even bolder. Once again everything is balanced, but bold. It's on the sweeter side, but it's not cloying or over the top at all. The bourbon shines without dominating. More chocolate, caramel along with some hints of vanilla. More hints of oak/wood in the mix. There's a subtle spiciness in the finish. Low bitterness. Very nice malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is definitely hidden, which is very impressive. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. It's fluffy, creamy, velvety and very smooth. This beer is the epitome of being dangerously drinkable.  This is an awesome stout. It's worthy of the hype. In a way it's simple, straight forward and not flashy. It's just just simply executed at the highest level. It's scary how smooth it is. Balance is honestly the key with this one. The craftsmanship is top notch. This is definitely an elite barrel-aged stout. Great stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Retroman40,4.57,"Deep brown color with a nice brownish head that gives way to significant lacing. The smell and taste are vanilla, chocolate and oak with just a hint of bourbon in the finish. The 15.2% ABV adds absolutely no ""heat"" to this beer.

The old factory picks up a lot of things, and hard to decypher, but has chocolate, vanilla, some smoke along with the ABV coming thru a bit. Taste nicely follows the nose...in just about the same order with a great smoothness to it...with ABV.

1549,10672,JJKBeerLvr,4.87,"Sampled December 2018 from 16.9oz bottle in snifter style glass. There is a bottled on date of August 12, 2017 date on listed on the bottle.  Appearance: Very dark black, dark color, with a dark tan head of 1 finger. The head lasted only a short length of time, and did not leave much lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Strong bourbon, oak, and caramel aromas. There are also roasted fire aromas, along with some coffee, vanilla, and hops in the aroma. Nice combination and balance between the bourbon barrel, hops, malts, and other aromas.  Taste: Pronounced bourbon and caramel flavors. Also coffee and burnt malt flavors. Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. It is very smooth. There is a hint of sweetness like chocolate that may be due to the oats and malts, but it has an excellent taste. Light hop flavor as well. The bourbon barrel flavors provide for a unique stout.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, with strong alcohol which matches with the 14.1% on the label.  Overall: This barrel-aged Stout is an excellent imperial stout. It has strong flavors as well as alcohol, and the mix of oak, malts, and hops makes for a unique and interesting stout. Probably the best barrel-aged stout I have tried. I would buy this again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,depechemode1983,4.44,"Pours black with a very thin dark brown head that is gone afte the pour is finished. No lacing to be seen.  Smells like soy sauce primarily. But you also get bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, wood. There is a lot going on. Oddly enough I dont get too much alcohol considering the ABV.  The taste consists of large amount of dark fruits and vanilla. Good amounts of oak and bourbon. Sweet chocolate. And a fairly high alcohol warmth.  The mouthfeel is full bodied. Its thick, viscous and extremely smooth. It coats the pallet nicely. Carbonation is soft.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Viaduck,4.81,"I’ve been waiting a long time to try this beer, a 2018 15.2 edition. I was elated when I got an email from BevMo, their daily spamming is annoying but news that they have beer that I’ve been impatiently waiting for is the only reason I tolerate it. A hard pour produced a modest head that soon dissolved to a ring around the circumstance with a very very dark body. Very pretty aroma: chocolate, alcohol, dark fruits,licorice, oak barrel, bourbon & plenty more to entertain the nose. Taste is quite sweet with a slightly bitty finish. Flavor, it’s a chocolate chip cookie dunked in bourbon with lots of char & barrel flavors, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel & so much more. Feel is moderately thick & silky smooth. The tongue didn’t find any carbonation, which always seems to run inversely to ABV but sure did enjoy the flavors. Not much heat detected either but once it reaches the stomach, it feel like someone lit a match. Overall this is one of the greatest stouts ever made. I’ll be headed back to BevMo to try the other 2 variants they have there.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,cardfan212,4.29,"2018 edition. Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a goblet.  Look - Pitch black, like used motor oil. No head or lacing. Very still. Slightly menacing looking.  Smell - Chocolate chip cookies immediately come to mind, but it's quickly covered up with vanilla, oak, alcohol, all the normal bourbon smells. Some hints of mushrooms, meat, bell peppers, and soy sauce in there too if you keep your nose in it long enough. An interesting mix of scents.  Taste - Starts with the usual bourbon suspects, slides into black licorice and soy before transitioning to a sweet chocolate that fades over to bitter chocolate. Ends on a tiny bit of herbal earthiness and a spicy alcohol warmth. Each sip is like a little journey.  Feel - Thick, oily, creamy, viscous. Coats you mouth, and has an almost chewy texture. No real carbonation to talk about.  Overall - Everybody already knows this is a good beer, and I definitely cannot deny it either. I'm glad it only comes around once a year though, I feel like I might get tired of it if I always had it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SierraNevallagash,4.56,"2018 Vintage poured into a 5oz stem at about 48F. This particular bottle states 14.7% ABV - weird - I have another that says 15.2%  Pours a thick, used motor oil blackish brown. Midnight black in the glass, with subtle mahogany highlights on the very thinnest edges. A vertical hard pour yields barely a centimeter of mocha head, that dissipates very fast, leaving nothing behind. A still, black abyss.  Nose is just delightful. Fudgy cocoa, caramel, vanilla, some currant/cherry/cranberry/dark fruit, definite bourbon, barrel char, oak, and extra doses of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Smells like the perfect BBA stout.  Palate begins as sweet dark chocolate. I mean massively sweet. But it's not TOO sweet, because you get that lovely char that cuts in. Lightly tannic barrel char. You get the immediate notes of bourbon, which is organic and restrained. Dark fruit comes in big, with cherry and currant coming to mind. Some fig and dates. These fruity notes take center stage and occupy the mid-palate, offering beautiful contrast to the dark chocolate base. Then, after the chocolate covered cherry middle, you get that bourbon, that char, that oak, some smoke, some vanilla, some tobacco, all immediately after the swallow. These linger and fade, leaving bourbon, oak, and vanilla as the lasting impression. Absolutely wonderful.  Mouthfeel on this is full and rich, but it's not in a syrupy way. No, it's not quite...sludgy. it's more like a sweet liqueur. It's a little viscous, but at the same time, very liquid and fluid. Hard to describe. I've had some THICK BA stouts before, and this isn't like that. It feels more...fluid. nevertheless, a great feel.  Overall, this is just a remarkable barrel aged imperial stout. It shares my #1 BA stout spot with Bell's BA Expedition. Both are unique. There's just something about this that just seems so refined and perfect. Well rounded and nuanced. It's big, bold, sweet, complex, smooth, and just an absolute treat. A bottle is a lot to drink at once, but only because of how rich it is. I will seek this out ever year. It's just that good.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Lots of legs when swirled. Super dark black, but a clean, clear black. Tight carbonation. Nose is awesome. Strong bourbon, sweet pit fruit, vanilla. First sips are equally awesome. The bourbon is boozy, sweet, with loads of vanilla, oak, char. Velvety smooth mouthfeel, crisp, full, with a great long malty aftertaste. Alcohol hidden well, but hits you fast after.

An experience to one's own preference. That is what hurts the brand when switching between brewmasters. They tend to forget what brought them to where they are. This year slightly misses the mark with body but makes up for it with barrel.  The last few years haven't been to kind to the brand name when compared to the past.

Went in on the Black Friday scramble for everything I could get here in Ohio. Tried the 2018 regular already and it is still incredibly impressive.

Incredible depth and complexity while almost seven years of age have smoothed out and tamed the beast. Shockingly together without any hints of oxidation or falling off.

Rich desert character on a fairly light body makes for a drinkable, yet flavorful beer at this ABV.

1549,10672,jrc1093,4.26,"Bottled on 8/31/17  Pours a near-jet black with complete opacity. A soft, dark beige head forms and fades with a lasting hiss reminding me of a freshly-cracked soda. It leaves a thin ring, and shows a steady effervescence persisting through the darkness at the surface.  There are heavy aromas of milk chocolate, malt, booze, and barrel upfront. Further inspection yields a really pleasant whiff of fresh graham cracker, followed by some fig and the slightest hints of raspberry and cherry.  I'm tasting plenty of barrel and hefty notes of oaky chocolate malt from the get-go. The intensity softens, eventually allowing soft notes of fig, molasses, and toffee through to even things out.  The mouthfeel is slick and oily, but maintains balance through a restrained carbonation that weighs it out nicely.  I was excited to finally crack this open, and while it certainly didn't disappoint, I can't quite say it lived up to it's lofty reputation. For myself, it's possibly a victim of the great level of adjunct diversity in BA stouts nowadays, resulting in what is still undoubtedly a refined profile getting a bit lost in the shuffle on the wider flavor spectrum of today's stouts. Still, though, it's nothing to turn your nose at; it's high-quality stuff that's clearly been polished to a level worthy of a higher tier.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Looks like there's going to be zero head but a good finger nail's worth froths up from the ether before quickly forming an eclipse-like ring around the edges. Looks the part, as I'm prone to typing. Foam ring is very clingy. Smells fucking HYOOOGE. Just a big, crazy malt monster of a beer. If I were more versed in bourbon I could probably pick out what brand barrels they use. Which is a roundabout way of saying that's there's lots of barrel character on the nose. I remember this being wicked sweet, but it's remarkably well-balanced. Still sweet, for certain, (it's got fudgesicle vibes) but with enough roast-y bitterness and bourbon accents to not be too cloying. Thick, chewy, viscous mouthfeel with a boozy warmth in the belly.

So I went in thinking it would be your run of the mill bourbon stout overfluffed by hype, with overpowering flavors singular flavor. But boy does it deserve the praise it gets.  Look is pitch black with almost no head as to be expected with this level of percentage. Smell is mostly of chocolate and coffee with a subdued bourbon smell.  First sip proves to be very drinkable , hints of coffee and chocolate with an aftertaste of smooth creamy bourbon with some carbonation. Goose island has done an amazing job of hiding this percentage, it was surprising I was expecting it to be a 9-10% but was shocked to see the tag say 14.7% for this batch.  Overall an amazing beer, tastes like a bourbon stout should without an overpowering bourbon taste. Definitely would recommend to anyone interested in getting into bourbon stouts. Very drinkable despite the percentage which is one of the things that blew me away along with that sensuous hint of bourbon at the end. It gives the right amount of hints of coffee, chocolate and bourbon without one flavor overpowering another, taste seems well balanced. Even those with high standards of stouts will enjoy.

This one was very expensive (€17 for a single 50cL bottle) and kind of exclusive in France. I recently rated KBS as my favourite beer ever after having it for a few times and loving it each time more for its balance. I recently had CBS, it was great too. This is one is over the top. This is a fantastic beer and almost the perfect beer for me. It's gourmet, balanced, tasty.  It pours a pitch black body with a nice mocha head, no lacing.  The smell might be the best one I've ever smelt. Just from the bottle I was like «huuuum, huuuum» for an hour with the coconut and chocolate character of the smell. The bourbon is preominent in the aroma and flavour. The taste is overall simple and perfectly balance with some nuts (amaretto) , chocolate, coffee, bourbon, astringent, a bit sweet. Really roasty. Semi-dry, this beer has a low carbonation but a very enjoyable cocoa powder-like mouthfeel. The, also, amazing thing about this beer is that it's 14.1% abv and it's not boozy at all, it's very drinkable. As it warms up it's a lit bit boozier but nothing over the top.  Overall this is a wonderful beer. I really love it. It's plain and simple. It's a beer and it's gracious.

The mouth feel is what gets me most, making it so balanced and smooth, reminding me of others that are the best of the best. It reminds me of skull splitter in refinement, as it was a brew that took me to a new level in mouth feel.

I don't care about aroma of a beer so much as the taste. That being said, this beer does have a strong aroma. I get a lot of chocolate malt and bourbon.  Now comes the best part: the taste! And it's wonderful. Initially the candied raisins and dark chocolate hit your palate, then comes the roasted malt and some marshmallow. Lingering in the background (but not weak at all) is the bourbon. It melds so well with the base beer. The finish is long, thick, and full of that decedent chocolate. The best I can describe the taste is chocolate-covered raisins soaked in bourbon.  This beer has an oily texture that coats the mouth. It's big and creamy, and the stickiness lingers, but not too much.  Overall this is probably the best imperial stout I've tasted. There are BA stouts that over-do the bourbon, and some that under-do the bourbon, but this one seems to have the perfect ratio.

Night and day difference between a cold pour and a properly warmed up bottle of BCBS. Drank around 50 degrees BCBS is fantastic.

Lots of caramel and chocolate flavors, vanilla, toasty coconut, sweet tobacco. F. Fuller body, really coats the inside of your mouth, a bit warm which is nice. O.

1549,10672,AyatollahGold,4.47,"I've had this beer several times over several years, but have never reviewed it. So today I will review the 2018 release. Bottled Sept. 17, 2018. I always like them fresh anyway. Pouring from a 500 ml. bottle into a goose island tulip (that I seem to only use this day each year, let me get the dust off). This beer pours out much lighter in color this year from what I remember of previous years. Despite being heavier in ABV this year (bottle states 15.2%). Forms darker in the glass but still has highlights. Forms a very active and quickly dissipating crown. The smell is huge boozy dark fruit like raisins, plums, digs and black cherries mixing with oak and slight chocolate. People saying this year is dark fruit heavier compared to other years, but just going off of smell this is what I think of when I think of bourbon county. The taste comes in with smooth chocolate and slight vanilla before leaning on the dark fruit side of things. Tobacco element as well with some char notes. The mouthfeel coats with the sugar sweet notes while being dry from the oak and leaving a char like element behind. I love this beer but feel like a lot are coming for it. It's not such a standout anymore among barrel aged beers, even though it paved the way. The one key difference in it to me is the char element it always has vs. finding that in other stouts. But other than that, it's becoming more of a nostalgia beer rather than a I truly have to chase this because of the quality compared to others beer. Just the way the world turns I guess. Not a bad thing.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste begins as chocolate, quickly fading to bourbon which gives way to black licorice, soy sauce. No heat though bourbon bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is thick and milky, drying quickly.

1549,10672,Victory_Sabre1973,4.72,"2017 Bottle  Pours a thick, black color. The head was minimal, but a nice shade of brown. Retention was poor. The nose is rich with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and notes of the barrel. Taste - Is rich. Got some vanilla, chocolate. A nice warming heat on the backside. Full bodied, and a nice feel of the barrel. This is a world class beer, and third time I've had it, world class every time.  EDIT: 2020 vintage VS 2021 Vintage - 14.6% 2020 14.4% 2021 Both pour the same, though the 2020 vintage's head is a bit darker than 2021. The Head lasted a bit longer in 2021, though, there's more of a residual head in 2020. Carbonation rises in the glass in both vintages. Nose is similar, but 2020 is a good bit stronger. Lots more toffee, caramel, licorice, vanilla, coffee, raisin aromas. Taste - 2021 - It is mellow at first, then the flavor really kicks in. There's lots of caramel, toffee, vanilla, coffee, licorice, raisin, plum, and some cola, with the rest of the barrel notes. Taste - 2020 - The flavor kicks in up front harder, and mellows out more on the backside. Similar flavor profile to the 2021, though, like I said, more up front. The body 2021 - smooth body, and thick. It is a sipper because there's a bit of heat from the alcohol on the back. The body 2020 - Burn hits right away, and keeps going throughout. Not as smooth, but just as thick. Final verdict: Both are amazing beers. Is there a winner? Gosh, I really don't know. The 2020 is packed with flavor up front, and mellows out, while the 2021 is mellow at first, then the flavor kicks in hard. There's more ""heat"" from the 2020 than the 2021, in spite of the almost identical ABV. You'd think the heat would have mellowed over the past year, from the ABV, but it hasn't, and is stronger than the fresh. It's interesting to see the differences between 2 identical beers, though different vintages. I'd say that 2021 just barely wins this contest, but both vintages are amazing.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

As if to warn of the high ABV the medium brown head is thin and leaves only spotty lacing amongst the ample legs of alcohol.  The smell of alcohol is not as high as I would have guessed and the mellow notes of caramel and bourbon are rather soothing. There is also a touch of soy sauce and and a constant but subdued aroma of vanilla. The alcohol while present is not a detractor.  The taste, as well as being damn good reflects the nose well. Sweet caramel and warm bourbon front to back with a small amount of soy sauce are constant. I get a light sweetness and sometimes raisin or prune but very light. The finish is smooth and warming. No oak flavor but I do get some charred wood character in the aftertaste.  Mouth feel is good too. Thick and soft it has a little bit of viscosity and not much carbonation.

1549,10672,DavidR_9,4.71,"Bottled Aug 2017, into snifter.  I gotta say I’m loving this a lot more than last year’s release (and mine weren’t infected). It’s a beautiful beer. Starting with the presentation - I love this bottle. It really communicates that a special elixir lies within. The pour is just what you’d expect, plus the unique and lovely dark brownish-orange looking head that fizzes out quickly to the edges of the glass. As opposed to last year’s super heavy vanilla and caramel notes, I’m getting a lot more dark chocolate, coffee bean, sweet bourbon, and charred oak - followed by a even helping of caramel and a hint of vanilla - and back to that nice charred woody character with the slightest hints of super ripe stone fruit. This brew masterfully and distinctly touches on all those flavors you expect out of an imprrial barrel aged stout and then exceeds that. This is so smooth. It hides the 14%abv behind a wholesome, chewey, and perfectly carbonated brew that continues to lightly fizz on your tongue to the last gulp. Finishes with a small bit of heat that truly elevates the whole experience.

1549,10672,CaptainHate,4.64,"I can't believe I didn't write a full review two years ago because drinking it was a transcendent experience. I was listening to a disc of small group improv that night and there was a trombone-tuba-woodwinds trio performance that I'd never bothered really listening to before because it previously was just random sounds. I was transfixed by it; it sounded like pure musical genius. Obviously BCBS was the causal factor in producing such an extremely positive reaction.  That was two years ago and I have no written notes to compare it with. But based upon two years of consuming *many* barrel aged stouts, including subsequent BCBS variants, this is the gold standard against which all should be compared. Regarding the look, maybe some carbonation has been lost in that there wasn't a prodigious head over a dark brown body, but this is still plenty lively. The smell and taste are just wonderful with plenty of flavors like vanilla, caramel, malts and who knows what else just swirling around. There is still some boozy heat but not nearly at the 14.7% level. If anything it seems hidden in the smoothness. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, with it adhering to my teeth so that minutes after a sip I'm still tasting it.

1549,10672,wmartin,4.74,"I'll dare to review this one. I've had exactly one of this particular beer, a 2017 sample, and it was really great. And that's all I'm going to get for awhile as 1 was the limit at the place I got it. Life seems so unfair sometimes.  I'd start with the bottle/label design, which I think is inspired. A perfect match for the beer found within. Imagine what it must taste like from looking at the bottle. That is what it tastes like. The beer comes with quite the pedigree, and I had some idea what it would be like, and it was pretty much exactly as I expected. Perhaps the finish was a bit of a surprise, but it is very much the sweet, molasses, malty, alcoholic, smooth, barrely beer that you've heard about and it looks like. The dark translucent liquid that clings to the sides of the bottle are a tip-off of the imperial stout/malty goodness contained within. I don't need to drink beer anymore, I can just look at it in the bottle and go ""ahhhh!"".  But seriously, this starts out molasses forward, becoming complex molasses/malty/alcohol, and finishing a bit on the bitter, hoppy side. A terrific ride, really. You get the dark fruity flavors and a strong dose of bourbon barrel flavor. The 14% ABV is a bit eye opening, but it works well. It is not completely hidden, but does enhance the flavors of all stages, from the initial sweet impression through the hoppy after taste.  Actually, I'm wondering how legal this brew is. It is so good, it must be addictive. I had one bottle, and I need to go into rehab.

Jet black with oil top/hue, looks like molasses on top. Smell very sugary and bitter notes, mostly a burnt ash scent mixed with artificial chocolate. A lot of the alcohol is rising out of the glass. Taste is a dark chocolate at first that evolves to a sweet charred caramel and flan taste that is absolutely lovely. I get very smokey notes with toasted marshmallow, flan, campfire, s'mores, faint cherry, and charred oats. Mouthfeel is also quite pleasant, very mellow and refreshing, this beer is incredible.

Now drinking 14.7% abv version it makes huge difference. 1st let's look at 4.03 rating of 14.1% with both poured into cellar and at cellar temp:  Not bad but don't understand the hype. Much better bourbon stouts exist these days. Perhaps it was something years back before the bourbon barrel craze. Its good but never will i chase again. As far as flavors go I get bourbon and dark fruit but is a bit watered down. Just too many better bourbon barrel stouts these days. This one lacks flavor and depth and will never seek this one out again. For what you get there is definitely better cheaper options that taste better.  Now 14.7% abv version:  L: Dark as night, thin head that dissipates quickly, super syrupy thick.  A: bourbon barrel, dark fruit,vanilla, and chocolate  F: thick slow sipper that blasts you with bourbon yet super smooth with a generous bourbon bite on backend.  T: bourbon, dark fruit, vanilla, chocolate, just straight up delicious  O: I understand there are abv laws that would not allow a 14.7% abv but my answer to that is get those bills dismissed.

1549,10672,Holderness,4.5,"Arrived home a couple days ago to discover my roommate had acquired (for free!) a bottle of 2016 vintage BCBS. Needless to say I was surprised. Appearance is that of a high-ABV stout: quickly dissipating brown head, pitch black appearance, and alcohol legs up the wazoo. Aroma and flavor profiles are largely dominated by rich chocolate and bourbon notes, with layers of candied dark fruits, oak, caramel, vanilla, and barley malts. The minimal carbonation prevents the mouthfeel from being totally velvety, but it is very mouth-coating nonetheless.  90/100  EDIT (12/1/2017): Had the 2017 release with some friends. Pretty similar to the 2016, except this year's version has a much more significant dark brown head that sticks around for a little while. The bourbony char character is really prevalent  EDIT (10/9/18): Snagged a chance bottle of 2017 at the Fort Point Market a little while back. It's been a while since I last had BCBS and revisiting it I'm as impressed as before. Really rich, barrel-filled aromas and flavors, a nice thick mouthfeel, and some really interesting smoky/caramely nuances. Looking forward to the 2018 batch  EDIT (2/14/19): Finally managed to find a 2018 bottle on the shelves.

1549,10672,Libeertarian,4.72,"From notes taken 05/10/17:  I really wish I could get my hands on some of the special once-brewed variants of this beer. One of these days, I'm sure.  Bottled October 6th 2016, so it’s a good seven months old. My intention was always to wait for at least six although if I had been able to pick up a few more than four of these I would have liked to have reviewed it fresh as well. Three more to go, in this batch at least. I’m thinking next reviews will be two years from bottling, then 3-5, then perhaps more than 5 years although it says best aged up to 5.  Dark brown to black, seems opaque and where thin enough to be semi-clear there is a definite fine haze. Rich orange-brown head, one finger and fine and foamy, but very quickly gone. Smells like a raisin-spice cake, made with rum or brandy or bourbon, and a hint of licorice. And that’s just in the bottle still. In glass, more licorice, almost banana-nut cake, some dark chocolate, faintest roastiness, and I can begin to detect ever-increasing overt oaky bourbon notes, burns my nose after a while. No vanilla yet apart from what oak has imparted. But now, on the pallet, I’d say it’s one of the main flavors, more than is distinct bourbon, more than anything else that comes standard in a stout. Vanilla and faint dark chocolate and a hint of dried or dark fruit tartness up front and throughout, followed quickly with the addition of pure booze, stronger chocolate, light licorice, and the faintest deteriorated hops, which is good here for the balance, though might be responsible for detracting from more distinct bourbon notes. Finish is molasses to the maximum, sweet and dark and rich. Overall, booziness is closer to brandy, fortified wine, or spiced rum. Full-bodied, oily, viscous, creamy, smooth. Carbonation is fine and gentle but does spritz up a little as ale is sloshed over the teeth and tongue. Extremely hot but mostly in nasa passage and on tongue, the texture must be such that the lips, throat, and cheeks remain unburnt. Overall, a treat, but almost too much of one. Very sweet, very alcoholic. I’ve had less than a third of it, and combined with the other two beers I’ve hd so far today, I must set it aside for later. Just barely the best Stout of any kind I have ever had, and there were a few non-barrel-aged ones, albeit still imperials, that almost beat it out. Based on what else is still out there, I’d wager there are better ones still, whether strictly imperial or any number of barrel-aged variations.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

From the bottle it pours almost flat. It sits there calmly like a well aged Belgian quad, with almost no head or rising bubbles. It is black but the light shines through the thin corner edges to reveal a red-brown tint. Aroma is interesting and complex consisting of heavy bourbon barrel character, figs and dates, warm fruit, molasses, vanilla, some warm spice like cinnamon or nutmeg, not much coffee or chocolate. Again, a little reminiscent of a Belgian quad but without that characteristic Belgian yeast character. Taste initially pretty much follows the nose, packaged in an oily and slick and resinous body. As it warms and breathes, milk chocolate notably and surprisingly makes itself prominent. I can’t say the finish is sweet or bitter. Just balanced. Alcohol is noticeable but not unwelcome.

I plan on doing this annually, so it will be interesting to compare notes on a particular vintage from year to year. The 2011 BCBS was a 14.5% ABV.  Poured like oil from a 12oz bottle stored boxed in my cellar. Little to no head with mild carbonation. The nose hits you before you finish pouring. Heavy bourbon notes with a mild alcohol aggression that was much more mellow than I expected. Plenty of chocolate & roasted malt. It was the most complex nose of any that we tried & was the benchmark for all that followed.  This is an impeccably well produced beer. Flavor profiles had married beautifully, one not trying to outdo another, rather working harmoniously to deliver a smooth crafted beer. Carmel notes, plenty of bourbon, a bit of smoke (probably from the malt or the barrels). Truly just an extraordinarily well balanced beer.  Finished as smooth as it started on the front end, no lingering alcohol notes to disturb the complexities left behind. Lots of chocolate notes on the back end that linger and leave you smacking your tongue trying to savor what's left.  I'm sitting on 5 bottles, willing to part with up to 3 if interested in a trade.

1549,10672,MaltsOfGlory,4.21,"2016 batch  500 ml bottle  Pours about two fingers of brown head into my willi becher glass. The head is somewhat pillowy, not creamy. I can hear it fizzing away, I don’t like that. The body is just completely black, even when held up to the light. We’ll see how the lacing goes, because the head disappeared all too quickly. So far it looks ok.  By the nose I’m pretty sure I wont like this beer. I just can’t handle all this damn soy sauce. Umami Umami and more Umami. I wouldn’t call this an off flavor, or a bad flavor, I just can’t stand it for the most part. Anyways, other than that there is a substantial woody aroma. Perhaps a little bitter chocolate. Some very nice caramel and vanilla coming through once I agitate it. Syrupy on the nose as well, as would be expected with 13%. I’m not really sure how to grade this. There are nice parts, and again, nothing that I would classify as “off”. I’ll say 4, I can’t knock it too far based on my personal preferences.  Damn, that is one hell of a flavor. Sweet caramel up front. Bitter and boozy as well, but not over the top, they are supporting flavors. I wanted to say cherries on the nose, but I didn’t get that aroma enough, I feel like that is definitely here on the flavor though. A little chocolate hanging out in the background. Very syrupy, but not in a fake way, just super thick and sweet. Surprisingly there is barely any Umami or woodiness. Really just a super complex and amazingly good flavor. It’s hard to pull everything out because so much is going on. Finishes with a little burnt malt, and then a long lingering butterscotch. Maybe some plum/dark fruit going on as well.  The mouthfeel is…interesting. As stated there is a substantial syrup characteristic that comes through just as heavily on the feel as it did on the flavor. Thing is, I don’t know if this is a good thing or not. It definitely adds character to the beer, and I don’t dislike it, which is more than I can say for extremely sweet beers. We’ll just call it a wash. The carbonation is very low. Somewhat dry and bitter for how sweet it also is, well balanced on the flavor and the mouthfeel. It’s not perfect, but it’s a well balanced mouthfeel, with character.  I would like to give this beer a 5 for drinkability, because for 13% it deserves it. Unfortunately that’s not really how drinkability works. So, I’ll say a solid 4, all things considered. It go’s down damn well, but damn well for 13 %.  Overall this is a great beer, the flavor really surprised me, it’s darn good. A little bit of that soy sauce started coming through as it warmed, but overall, great beer.

1549,10672,JayORear,4.93,"Since I recently reviewed BA Ten Fidy somewhat negatively against BCBS, I thought it would be only fair to review BCBS on its own, just to make sure that my memory of the beer isn’t tainted by nostalgia. I was lucky enough to find a hidden stash at a local bottle shop two months after release, so here goes with the ’16 version.  Appearance: yup, I’m reminded why I always go back to this beer as a BA stout reference point. Deep, fudgy brown with a single-finger head that dissipates into a beautiful film across the top of the beer. It’s not showy or overly fluffy, just . . . elegant. The smell is exactly matched to the appearance, offering heady chocolate, vanilla, fig, and bourbon notes that make you realize that most adjunct stouts are basically trying to replicate what base BCBS does without having to add anything. Again, balance and refinement rule the day. Taste is complex and ever-changing as it warms: sweet vanilla evolves into a charred and bourbony chocolate that, in turn, drops into something approaching a deep, fudge liqueur. The journey through the bottle is like tasting three to four different world-class stouts, all of which are flawless. Mouthfeel is rich, oily, and viscous, what BA Ten Fidy wishes it could be. Every sip is like dessert, a decadent treat you want to never end.  Overall, what more can I say? The only thing that keeps me from ruling this BCBS a “perfect” beer is that, as good as the mouthfeel is, it’s been slightly better in previous years. I’ll always remember 2012, which honestly felt like warm brownie batter on the tongue. Obviously, this beer hardly needs my recommendation, but if you’re at all on the fence about trying to obtain and taste it, you’re crazy. It’s the beer to try before you die.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,woodychandler,4.86,"I generally eschew chasing after limited releases and such, but when a buddy gifted me a 2016 bottle recently, I was not going to turn him down. I was in Chicago around Thanksgiving 2014 & I stopped in at Binney's (Clybourn) to try & score some CANs, et al, but the place was such an absolute zoo that I walked out, empty handed & disgusted. It is just one example among many of why I started The CANQuest (tm) in the first place.  From the bottle: ""The original bourbon barrel aged Stout""; ""Since 1992""; ""Stout aged in bourbon barrels""; ""Chicago Made Imperial Stout""; ""Intense aromas of charred oak, vanilla, caramel & smoke""; Brewed, barrel aged & bottled by Goose Island Beer Co. Chicago, Illinois""; ""Develops in the bottle up to 5 years""; ""[signed] Brewmaster, Jared Jankowski"".  I Pop!ped the cap on the relatively big bottle and commenced a gentle pour simply because I have never had a bottle of BCBS. Usually, I go to PHL during Thanksgiving weekend & have some on tap. This was a new experience for me. I am becoming proficient at doing an in-glass swirl, this time raising a finger of foamy, deep-brown head that seemed rather anxious to fall back to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had the coconut smell that I always seem to get from bourbon, accompanied by dark chocolate, light smoke and caramel. It was a liquefied Girl Scout Samoa cookie! Oh, I am a sucker for them & Thin Mints. This was gonna send me, especially at 13.8% ABV. Mouthfeel was thick, viscous, oily, like BP had dumped a load off of a rig into my mouth. Mmmm. The taste was much like a Samoa with the chocolate leading the way, followed closely by coconut and caramel as well as light smoke. OMFG! This was quite tasty and dangerously easy to drink.

Objectively this is a very good Bourbon barrel aged stout. That being said, it makes me realize that I'm not a BBA stout fan. It's still tasty and enjoyable but has just a bit too much heat for the aromas and flavors to be super enjoyable. I have another bottle that I'll hold onto for a year or two in the hopes that the bourbon barrel character mellows a bit.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Of course, if you just wanna pound one , this stout is delicious. Bet you can't pound it. It's too good for that. Feel is velvet..... I don't think I have ever used the word velvet before in a sentence. So yes , it is velvet. Keeps getting better so drink it slow.

It is topped with less than an inch of tan head that disappears quickly leaving virtually no lacing.  It smells like a bourbon dessert. I smell chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and roasted malt.  The taste is every bit as good. The bourbon melds into caramel and vanilla flavors, while the roasted malt yields chocolate notes. The bourbon is still recognizable in the finish with a mild booze flavor.  Full, smooth, and viscous mouthfeel  This is my first BCBS. I get the hype now. It is a phenomenal beer. It met and perhaps exceeded my high expectations. This is a rare beer that lives up to the hype.

1549,10672,BethanyB,4.55,"A still, ebony lake Is lined with a quiet rim of contrasting beige froth. Serene and full of promise.,The aroma is unsurprisingly oaky and smoky with plenty of complementary vanilla and hazelnut, but surprisingly peppery as well! The complex foundation is built of plums, figs, And milk chocolate. Both balanced and full. As Mary Poppins would say, practically perfect in every way. So, let's taste it! The bourbon's woodsy sweetness comes through straight away. It mixes with fresh maple syrup, whose stickiness is balanced by the drying characteristics of tobacco laced with cocoa powder. Soft pastes of plum, dark cherry, and strawberry create a real complex jam. Unlike other bourbon barrel stouts, this is a beast with a real heart. The mouthfeel is smooth jazz creamy with a light carbonic bite toward the finish to let the juice burst just enough for a celenaratory kick. A surprising jewel from an iconic brewery which is apparently still on top of the saturated craft game.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Aromas of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, cola, dark chocolate, caramel, sweet and toasted malts, licorice, raisins, cherries, and other dark fruits.  T: Taste follows the nose somewhat. Leads with sweet caramel and cola followed by bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Finishes with notes of cherry, raisins, licorice, and toasted malts with a slight lingering bitterness.  F: Full bodied, medium thickness, creamy, and smooth with a small amount of carbonation.  O: Overall, this is a great BA Stout. This was my first time trying this one. The flavor profile is very complex and interesting. Lots going on in this one. At first, I felt it was overly sweet, but as it started to warm it began to balance out the sweetness and fruitiness with coffee and bourbon. Only wish I would have had time to sit and let it warm longer.

1549,10672,avas,4.32,"2015 vintage dated 10/1/15.  A: Beer comes in a pitch black color with pretty much no head retention save for the thinnest little ring of tiny mocha bubbles. Major alcohol legs staining the glass.  S: Very bourbon-forward, definitely the most intensely bourbon-y nose I've experienced. Lots of vanilla, oak, smoke, and dark fruits, mostly cherry. Little bit of dark chocolate and caramel as well. Extremely pungent as expected.  T: Wow. Huge dark fruits and vanilla up front, followed by nearly as intense notes of caramel, dark chocolate, oak, and burnt brown sugar. Even some molasses on the aftertaste. It's so complex, with each flavor coming in a wave that unapologetically attacks the palate. There's a lot of sweetness, but not too much, as the drying alcoholic note really cuts through it on the finish. As it warms, I get a little soy sauce-y thing on the finish,  M: Really slick, almost oily mouthfeel that just glides across the tongue. Not particularly full due to lack of carbonation, but feels heavy on the tongue. Burning alcoholic sensation in the back of the throat, but this isn't nearly as boozy as the 13.7% would suggest.  O: I'm still making my way into the barrel-aged stout world, but this was definitely a step in the right direction. This beer packs a TON of flavor into a deservedly large package, and the flavor profile is one of the more complex I've experienced in a beer. While the nose is somewhat lacking IMO (too barrel- and dark fruit-forward), the taste is a wonderful melange of vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, caramel, molasses, and oak. I look forward to revisiting this as I build my appreciation for the style, but as it stands now, I think it's quite delicious!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This beer is the blackest of the black. People throw around the words motor oil all the time, but this is the closest to motor oil I have ever seen. No head.  The bourbon is ever apparent alongside the oak. There is a dark fruitiness on the nose that you cannot deny. This is probably my least favorite part of the beer.  At first, the taste hits you with that immediate sweetness, but it quickly envelopes into vanilla and bakers chocolate sweetness which surrounds and dominates the mouth and throat, with oak coming in to match.  The feel is boozy and oaky with a touch of creaminess and lower carbonation. Swallows sweet and just a touch boozy depending on how big of a sip you take.  Overall, if they could kill that initial odd sweetness but keep the rest of the flavors, this could potentially be my favorite beer of all time. This is world class, and I'm not one to rate on hype nor anything else aside from how much I enjoyed it.

After having many barreled aged stouts, I can see why this is the Platinum standard.  Look - Pitch black. Looks like motor oil. Half finger of mocha head. Goes away quickly.  Smell- Dark rich Plums and Berries, Vanilla, Oak, Smoke and some pine!!!  Taste fallows the nose.- Big dark strong fruits and berries, Vanilla, light smoke.  Feel- Thick sticky mouth feel, Very warming.But very very drinkable. Would love as a night cap.  Overall- I have never had a other version prior to this. But this beer has probably ruined any other barrel aged stout for me. The flavors are so complex. I came in to this very unbiassed. I kinda figured with so many other bourbon barrel aged stouts, that would average. But damn, I was wrong.  I am aware of the 2015 batch infection.

1549,10672,Zoomslowik,4.4,"Review was done while drinking the 2016 vintage. Recently had 2012 and 2013, which would rate similarly (2012 was a little more bourbon heavy). Haven't had them recently, but 2014 would be a little higher (more chocolate/fudge base) while 2015 would be a little lower (less balanced, basically caramel and bourbon, not obviously infected).  L- Basically black, slightly brownish tinge. Slight mocha colored head, but it fades to a thin ring that eventually disappears.  S- Bourbon is the most prominent. Some vanilla and chocolate.  T- Like the smell, quite a bit of bourbon in the flavor. It's supplemented by milk chocolate, caramel and a little vanilla. A little sweet, especially when it warms, but not enough to ding it.  F- Medium-low carb, which works for this beer. Smooth, rich but not super thick. Some alcohol burn on the finish.  O- An old standby, especially in Chicago. Very tasty, especially if you like bourbon. It's probably not worth the lines, but it's better than a lot of barrel-aged stouts that cost more (BCBS is fairly easy to get at $9.99 for 16.9 oz).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Removing the cap indicated a secure seal, but this has very little carbonation. This is not ideal for the appearance, but the low carbonation seems about right for the smooth, full, warming, high ABV body. Boozy and woody (a touch too woody, IMO but not all vintages) aroma with dark roasted grains and molasses. Sweet bourbon dominates the rich flavor that also suggests dark dried fruits including dates. Moderately woody with faint vanilla and coffee in the finish. Mild bourbon barrels and dark bread in the aftertaste. 6 month old version on tap was too hot.

Despite an aggressive pour it produces almost no head, which quickly recedes to some slow-moving lace on the side.  Smell: I can definitely smell the alcohol, which is fine; I like bourbon, why do you think I'm drinking a bourbon-aged stout? Dark fruits, cherry, fig. Roast, malt, char. Soy sauce? Something savory.  Taste: Cocoa, but also vanilla. Wood/oak...can that be a taste instead of an aroma? Not that I'm prone to munching on wood or anything. More dark fruits. Bourbon. People often praise big, high ABV stouts for hiding the alcohol. This...doesn't, but it's not bad. It's got the bourbon sweetness. The taste gets better across the middle of the tongue and it leaves a strong aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Not very carbonated, and I like carbonated. It's the reason I don't like nitro beers. I have to swish it around a bit to feel the bubbles, but they're there. Thick, but not heavy; very pleasant body.  Overall: Does it live up to the hype? Probably. I had this once before when I was drunk and thought it might be one of my favorite beers ever. I hate feeding into the hype, but it's probably deserved.   2020 version:  Appearance: black, what did you expect?  Smell: wet dog? wet cardboard? this thing just smells wet, and not in a good way. bad bottle?  Taste: luckily doesn't follow the smell. these beers have never been subtle, always some of the hottest, most bourbon-y BA stouts i've ever had. baker's chocolate, leather, pretty dry this year, but also jesus always a lot of bourbon. not that i'm complaining. bourbon MUCH more apparent as it warms; i know that they say to not drink beers too cold as it may supress the aromas, but this is one that you may want to drink before it warms up too much, otherwise the booze can be overwhelming  Feel: syrupy. dark, thick, what did you expect?  Overall: i'm drinking this in a flight next to the ""special 2020"" (oatmeal, maple syrup) and the london fog 2020. initially i thought ""maybe I prefer the 'special' to the original?"".

Unlike the rest of humanity, I found it unbearably sweet and syrupy tasting (that's the bourbon barrel kicking in I suppose) - way over the top. Undrinkable, in fact. Did I get a bad batch? There is nothing on the Goose Island web site to indicate that I did.

The bourbon was not as dominant as I thought. There is an awesome sweetness in there that makes this super drinkable. The 16 was slightly less sweet, maybe the aging.  Both were super smooth for the ABV with a little afterburn.  Overall both were fantastic.

The aroma is a bit less nuanced than I remember with chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit, oak and some alcohol spiciness. Not really getting much vanilla though.  The taste is huge bourbon and alcohol spice along with chocolate, dark fruit and some vanilla. Not getting a lot of the barrel though.  The palate is full with a lingering alcohol spice that warms the throat going down. It doesn't linger as much as you would expect from a 14.5% beer.

1549,10672,woemad,4.57,"16.9oz bottle of the 2015 vintage purchased at the Total Wine on the north side of Spokane, WA, for $9.99. I was there for other things, saw they had it for a fairly reasonable price and thought, “Oh, what the hell…” According to the stamp on the back, this was brewed on October 22, 2015. This is my first ever BCBS, by the way. Probably only my 2nd or 3rd Anheuser Busch/InBusch/whatever product of the last several years. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a problem with the way AB-I does business, specifically the crowding out of other products on shelf spaces, but this is a kind of benchmark beer, so I want to try it at least once and judge for myself the hype vs. substance argument that whirls around this beer.  Poured into a River City snifter, this was an extremely dark brown that appeared black as a moonless night. There was briefly a sudsy head that was colored somewhere between dark tan and mocha, but it fled quickly, leaving no lace behind.  Sweet and boozy nose to this, but it’s not smelling like a candy or booze bomb. I get chocolate and bourbon, in sufficient amounts to assuredly dominate but without being cloying, and not a whole lot else at first. As it warms, there’s a little bit of vanilla and something like really restrained toffee. Certainly, there’s no trace of the dark fruit aromas that frequently turn up in a RIS – barrel aged or not. Fairly subtly, restrainedly (no idea if that’s even a word, but spellcheck isn’t freaking out) complex for a big, barrel aged stout without seeming like there’s something crucial missing.  Bourbon and chocolate lead the parade past the tastebuds, wearing a cloak of vanilla and tobacco, with maybe a tiny pinch of smoke. As it warms, the boozy warmth one would expect of a 14.3% beer does begin to creep in, but, to use a word I’m beginning to identify with this beer, it’s very subtle.  Full bodied, with a velvety-smooth, coating mouthfeel. Feels like a dessert!  All the talk of this vintage being infected made me hesitate opening this numerous times, so I wound up sitting on it for something like 9 months. I wonder if that helped it to mellow out. I stumbled across it by chance when I walked into Total Wine to buy something else, so I only allowed myself a purchase of one. I wish now I’d bought two and hit the other one first thing, so I could do a comparison. As it stands now, this is a subtle beer that also manages to be HUGE at the same time. It would make a great dessert or a nightcap, and is in a small enough bottle size a person wouldn’t run the risk of. I’d say the positive notoriety is deserved for this beer. It’s subtle smoothness makes it a world class drinking experience. A lot of people say AB-I can’t brew a good beer. Personally, I stopped believing that a long time ago, their sins are more from being the McDonalds of beer than being incompetent, but this beer is proof that they can brew a beer as good as anyone.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pours an oily viscous black. Thin mocha colored tan head is momentarily visible before disappearing. A thin tan slick is noted on top of the beer after the head dissipates.  Smell is a pungent musty barrel aroma with strong note sod vanilla in the aroma. Undertones of chocolate, roasted malts, char, bourbon, and generic dark fruit. Strong booze aroma at the end.  Taste is a lovely array of flavors. Lots of bourbon and barrel notes are there up front. Strong vanilla notes from the barrel are also present. Lovely smooth chocolate and roasted malts give way to a char note with some smoky tobacco like notes. This is a bit hot, as there is a slight alcoholic burn on the finish, but its not harsh by any stretch. some molasses like flavors are present and provide a nice mild sweetness.  Mild carbonation - about what you'd expect for a barrel aged beer. Lovely velvety feel on this beer. Nice weight to it - the beer that went into the barrels must have been like syrup.

Faint but distinct aroma of bourbon. 1st sip, brings a smooth taste of chocolate, coffee, bourbon and a touch of honey! OMFG this is one smooth stout! Leaves a lingering aftertaste of sweetened dark chocolate on the tongue. 14.3% abv, but youd never know it by how smoothly and gently it boes down...nothing harsh about this baby at all!

It's as it should be, a bit of the bourbon has settled into the dark smoothness. NOT AFFECTED. Otherwise the same expected world class offering. 3 down 3 to go.  **2016 reg update** Oct 16 bottle date. Aggressive pour lent to a hefty head. Smell is mainly vanilla. No alcohol standing out. Taste is...different than a good 2015, alcohol makes it apparent it's BBA. Sticky vanilla fudge. Feel is super creamy like drinking through a room temp chocolate milk with a layer of melted marshmallows. Overall it is much less complex than previous releases I've had, but is good-if I'd never had it before I know I would be a fan.

Smell: O no! Not a good start. Bourbon smell is completely absent. Smells like rotten sour fruit mixed with an athlete's foot soaked sock.  Taste: I cannot lie and say I took more than just one sip of this beer because I physically could not drink it. That one sip made me want to haul. Tastes like a wine gone extremely bad.  Feel: Body is still nice and thick but the flavor ruins any chance of me enjoying the consistency.  Overall: Considering the fact that we've had such bad luck with the 2015 Bourbon County line-up, I was very optimistic that our BCBS's would not be bad as well. We cracked this opened because of all the news floating around that some batches were infected. Unfortunately the rumors are true. The fact that we got all our variants at the same store makes me wonder if all our bottles are drain pours (Please not the rare! Please!!!!!). Just put the remaining regulars in the fridge.

Aroma hit those big bourbon notes first and foremost without being hot or abrasive. Oak behind it.  Taste bourbon, rich, tad of sweet, lots of chocolate, even wood charred. Easy to drink, thicker consistency mouthfeel wise.  In many ways it is the archtype of bourbon barrel stouts. Price keeps going up per oz, but hey what can you do? Infections don't help scores either, but thus far, the 2 I've drank in '15 were just fine.

I read/skimmed a thousand ratings of this and only found a few that made sense to me. Looks great. Ink black. Poured into a tulip with no head at all. Smelled musty. Taste was overly sweet and I wondered if it was attempting to be a sour gone bad. Compared it to Brer Rabbitt molasses and that wasn't it. Compared it to Sorghum and it was spot on except BCBS is much darker. Felt oily and syrupy. Looked for the strong bourbon flavor and alcohol that are mentioned in so many reviews, but don't find it. I like a good bourbon and this shows none of it. Lingering medicinal taste on the tongue. I'll never recommend this to anyone and I'll never purchase it again.

1549,10672,dbl_delta,4.63,"2015 vintage bottle into snifter. Pours an oily black with minimal tan head that dissipates quickly. Initial impression is OMG - dark chocolate, coffee, booze, caramel, vanilla...and bourbon. Good stuff. Nice cozy alcohol burn (maybe I shoulda cellared it but frankly I couldn't wait to try it.) Medium-thick mouthfeel. Definitely a sipping beer - at 14.3% ABV this will drop a rhinocerous in its tracks. But it would drop with a smile on its face. Too bad this is so hard to find. I scored one of the two remaining bottles from the ""back room"" of my local bottle shop, and that was pure luck. I've had the ""Rare"" and prefer it ever so slightly, but it's a close call.  Update for 2017 release: Draft at BrewVino in York PA. Pours an opaque motor-oil black with essentially no head. Initial impression is molasses, roasted malts, charred oak, and bourbon. I'm not getting as much caramel or vanilla as previous years. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly thick; carbonation is light. Finish is boozy and warm. Definitely a slow sipper - the various flavors emerge as it warms. I actually prefer the 2015 release (very slightly) over 2017, but 2017 is certainly exceptional.  Update for 2018 release: To be fair, I no longer recall the 2015 version in all its particulars. Even if I did, I was a lot less familiar with BBA Imperial Stouts and was probably easily impressed. And I was impressed. This year I bought a growler, and once again, I'm impressed. This is an excellent stout. It's better at room temperature. It's a sipper. Treat it with respect. And enjoy.  2019: Growler into pint glass. Man oh man. Get you some of this.  2020: Yaaaass. Better'n ever!  2021: Chocolaty. Coffee. Roasty. Boozy. The mouthfeel is maybe a little thinner than previous years, but I'm not gonna dock it for my notoriously sketchy memory. Cellar it? Nah. Let it warm to room temp and that's plenty of time to let it sit. It's so drinkable it's dangerous. Variants? We don' need no steenkin; variants! The basic unadulterated BCBS is exceptional. Looking forward to next year!  2022: Bottle into pint glass. Very similar to 2021, I could use a little more heft to the mouthfeel, but the overall experience is top drawer. Smooth, flavorful, and boozy - what more could you ask for? This embodies what I look for in an American Imperial Stout. It's slightly different every year, but it's very good every year. I bought a single, but my bottle shop is offering growlers of 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022. I briefly considered it, but thought naah that sounds like a lost week. Or two.

I found this new 2016 to be so boozy and unbalanced that it was undrinkable and I question the people giving this beer (when fresh) a high score because I wonder if we're tasting the same thing. It needs time to balance out and grow complexity. Hopefully some time will help it develop.   2012 drank in 5/16: About as good a bourbon stout as I've ever had. Bottled 11/7/12, drank in May, 2016 (3.5 yrs).  Look: thick, opaque, looks like melted dark chocolate. Pours like... I don't know. It looks thicker than it is. It sticks to the glass when I swirled it around. Could have a little more head in addition to the thin lace around the edge.  Smell: incredible. As it warmed it opened a little more, and rich mocha, dark stone fruit, and bourbon came forward. But not over bourbonized.  Taste: spot on for this style.  Feel: smooth, slight carbonation.

Pour is black and opaque, with a small amount of espresso-coloured head that quickly dissipates. It looks like black coffee. Smells very different, though - raisins and rum dominate, with a backdrop of sweet malt.  Taste is incredibly sweet! You can definitely feel the heat of the alcohol in the aftertaste. The recommendation to age this beer for 5 years should have been worded like a requirement - but unless you age it, the sugars are far too predominant.

1549,10672,Beginner2,4.37,"I've had this Iconic AIS at several junctures in my career. While the recipe seems to stay the same, I have changed. As I age, I'm less a fan of the AIS... which has some irony. But as I return to Bourbon County now in 2020, I am glad that at least it can be bought in stores. Ten years ago, I had to find it on the secondary market; since it lasted only about 1-3 hours on Chicago's shelves after it is released. Today, BCBS has competition who also over-charge. Cult brews may be great to set a standard; but, for me, that is not true at any price. Cult brews also breed competition. But in fairness, I can only conclude a good AIS must be expensive to make.  Looks were never a big deal in my dealings with Bourbon County. Opaque and no suds never were my stimulant. Smell is full of vanilla and bourbon and all that good stuff. Tastes are a rich chocolate bittersweet. Desert seems best at two years. (I've aged bottles too long and they get slightly sour, like an old English Ale.)  I should note that during Open House Chicago 6 years ago or more, I went in the Goose Island warehouses that store BCBS. The Smells were inviting on the street and intoxicating inside the warehouse.  At any rating, Bourbon County is listed on the ""1001"" and it deserves to be there. BCBS is the pioneer, the shoulders upon which others stand.  There are lessons in life from beer. And from aging a bottle of Bourbon County too long, the lesson is: don't hang on to something precious for too long.

Pours almost black with hardly any head, but the growler had lots of foam pouring out. I'm sure it would've been much better right into the glass.  Smell is very boozy. Swirling the glass helps to diffuse the evaporated alcohol and let you smell the beer itself, which is delightful.  The taste is fantastic. Really well balanced, which is not easy in a 14% beer. The first few sips are dominated somewhat by the alcohol burn, but then all of a sudden it starts to open up and you can taste the roast and chocolate flavors.  Nice and full mouthfeel. It's very full bodied, but it doesn't hang on in your mouth too long.  This is a great beer, but it definitely tests the definition of beer. Sipping a few ounces of this feels great, and if I wasn't afraid of ruining it, I would try just pouring a little and saving the rest in the fridge to see if it keeps well.

Dark brown, almost black in color. Minimal head.  Smell: Bourbon, with sweet notes, possibly caramel or chocolate or vanilla even, it was hard to pinpoint.  Taste: For a beer that has a 14.4% ABV according to the bottle, this drinks extremely smooth and easy. Bourbon is most certainly in the front, with subtle chocolate and other sweet flavors. It plays extremely well, not one aspect overpowering the other.  Feel: On the thicker side of things, could be just a tad thicker in my opinion, but maybe I'm just being picky.

1549,10672,LeRose,4.26,"It pours black, thick, oily. In the snifter there is no head, just a very light ring of coffee colored bubbles that vanish.  Aroma - I can smell the bourbon from the counter top. Closer sniff...massive dark fruit, a molasses like sweetness, vanilla, alcohol.  Taste - initially very sweet, heavy on the figs and dates, that brown sugar or molasses flavor, vanilla, bourbon. As it warms, more notes show. Cherry, oak, some bitterness and a coffee aroma. As it warms, the sweetness subsides some and it becomes less boozy. The bitter helps clean things up as the malts come out of hiding with warmth. A little charred taste - almost but not quite smoky. More coffee on the nose than the taste, and a pleasing hint of pipe tobacco. There is a small amount of licorice - not my favorite flavor in a beer, but it is not very strong.  Feel - There isn't much coating on the tongue, but there is a stickiness on the lips like.  There is a lot going on, and it all seems to play nicely together. It certainly evolves. There is no doubt that this is a well made beer. Subjectively, I dont find myself loving this beer. Objectively, this is just that damned good...no doubt, end of story. Subjectively, I am enjoying the flavors as they morph and emerge, but it doesn't make my ""gotta have it"" list. Great beer, just not my cup of tea.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DJChaseTheBase,4.88,"Had this in a snifter on draft at a local bar/restaurant. The body on this is so full you feel like you're drinking a bourbon shake. On top of that their is plenty of bourbon tastes w/ caramel & chocolate tastes lingering around. What an amazing stout, I never knew stouts could have this much pow to it. This beer is so solid and everyone has to try it!! Perfection of a bourbon aged stout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,davidperez,5,"The first liberating gasp of the beer (that moment where the cap barely releases a modicum of pressure), revealed a massive coconut with some roasted malts perfume, reassuring me that my hype was not to be let down.  Served in a snifter, it pours a black ink, thick, seemingly oily. The pour induced the formation of a small dark brown foam, not enough to cover the whole surface area, and evidently not enough to form a head. Such foam had low retention. This beer leaves no lacing. Instead, after a swirl this beer coats the glass with a transparent, oily layer, exactly like tears of wine. After some more time of gentle swirling, you can actually see that the beer paints the glass with a tender and subtle brown hue, akin to the effect of a red wine of an intensely pigmented varietal on its glass. Bourbon County Brand Stout is beautiful to the eye.  This bouquet is superlative. Massive coconut, assertive alcohol reminiscent of bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel, cherry and raisins, charred wood, slight hint of tobacco, slight hint of coffee. These particular set of elements present in the bouquet set the tone for a clearly sophisticated beer.  Magnificent flavor. It overruns your palate with a complex sweetness and a hot spirit-like component. Notes of caramel, coconut, vanilla, molasses, subtle chocolate and coffee, slight hint of raisins and cherry. Moments before reaching the finish, you sense the vestigial bitterness coming from the roasted malts, and the tobacco/smokiness becomes present too, giving this beer a subtle twist right before fading. The aftertaste is bourbon-like, and it has a strong vanilla component, which lingers pleasantly. Despite the assertiveness, almost aggressiveness of all the flavors in this beer, the aftertaste doesn't last that long. The mouthfeel is also delicious. Oily, silky but mostly chewy, this liquid caresses your palate while delivering all of its notes. Warm. No carbonation present, which, needless to say, it fits perfectly in the equation.  After emptying the snifter, you corroborate what could be seen when the glass was full with some gentle swirling: this beer treats the glass as a canvas, and paints its walls with a light, translucent, brown hue.  Great depth and complexity.  Bourbon County Brand Stout, epitome of a world class beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Uscjojo,4.9,"Black with a small tan head. looks like black motor oil. The smell is chocolate, burnt sugar, dark fruits, coffee, bourbon, and roast malts. The taste is amazing! chocolate, vanilla, burnt sugar, coffee and bourbon. The bourbon is definitely present. Feel is thick, clings to mouth and heat from bourbon. This is my favorite stout!

1549,10672,Bleer,4.28,"Yum. Shocking I know.... I do love this beer and will always go out of my way to find it. However, I do find it a little on the harsh side when compared to the bourbon county coffee or say a KBS. Jet black, boozy nose, little to no head, again a little more harsh than I prefer on the alcohol taste, and very warm/warming. I would love to try again after it ages a year or two!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell: Roast malt, bourbon, vanilla, coconut, coffee, tobacco, a bit of bourbon soaked ripe cherry and raspberry. It's all great, but a bit muddled by the pervasiveness of the borbon as tends to be the case with fresher vintages of BCBS.  Taste: Tons of dark fruit in the front palate, prickly non-bitter roast coffee, vanilla, bourbon. Lacking the strong chocolate that I've had in past vintages. I'm really surprised about the vanilla, bourbon soaked cherry flavors. TONS.  Feel: Thick mouthfeel. 8.5/9 out of 10. Viscous.

Smell - lots of sweet/dark fruits… good amount of chocolate and bourbon coming in as well. Taste - taste is on point with the smell. Definitely strong sweet/dark fruits at first followed by milky chocolate and bourbon with a hint of toasted coconut/vanilla. I personally can't find a ton of vanilla on the backend like some people say, but I can tell its there. Feel - very slick mouthfeel but not too thick. Overall - Awesome beer. Very sweet with a slight alcohol burn, balanced quite nicely. I'd say its worth the hype.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

No lacing, just legs. 5  S - Bourbon, barrel, chocolate covered cherries, raisins, and notes of vanilla. 4.5  T - Each sip is a little different, but basically: super sweet intro of caramelized sugar and a sweeter bourbon character. Mid way the alcohol kicks in with notes of dark chocolate, cherries, dark fruits, wood, and hints of vanilla. Every other sip or so I get a whisper of coconut, right before the roasted coffee settles in as the aftertaste. Maybe just a touch of earthy hop. Became much more balanced as it warmed. Flavors mingled and mixed together perfectly. Hard to put down. 5  M - Thick. Viscous. Sticky. Heaven. 5  O - Fantastic. My best advice is sip it while it's cold so you can enjoy it when it warms.

Luscious full body this beer is almost a meal in itself and almost perfect. I shared it with a buddy before a concert last night and all we had to drink it out of were red solo cups.

1549,10672,TheSixthRing,4.44,"Bottling date of 10/20/15  Appearance - Pours black with a brown, quarter finger width head that dissipates quickly to reveal a mostly barren surface.  Smell - An array of strong chocolate character with healthy bourbon backing it up. Vanilla and dark fruit. Caramel. Oak.  Taste - Follows the nose. A mix of dark and milk chocolate and cocoa, beset by a prominent but not overbearing bourbon character. Notes of vanilla and oak. Molasses. Faint coffee roast hits mid-taste. Fair amount of almond character. Coconut hits near the finish, catching the wave of chocolate and boozy bourbon warmth that rides well into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with low carbonation. Thick, near syrupy texture, but it goes down stupid smooth for a 14.3% BA stout this early into its development.  Overall - A classic and perhaps the Standard bearer for the style. Much respect. Excellent balance between the stout aspect and the heat from the bourbon barrel aging, resulting in a brew that's ready to drink right off the assembly line.

Smells of bourbon, dark bitter chocolate, coffee, and faint generic bitterness. Lots of soy in the mouth, combined with hot alcohol booziness. Not my cup of tea. I bought a 4 pack of this at the time, the others here were done at a tasting along with the coffee version from 2011? I think, Yeti in a 3 year, and Mephistophiles in a 3 year.  2011: Same look as 2012, less head however. Lower carbonation, but not much different. Somehow a bit thicker in body. Less alcohol heat, less bourbon flavors, but still soy saucey.  2010: Much improved over the other two - almost no carb, very thick mouthfeel .

The bourbon burn is held well within check. Mouth feel is exceptional. It feels bold and robust, creamy and smooth, thick and filling. It's a pleasure to drink for mouth feel alone.

Very restrained roast with dark chocolate notes, bread and toffee. Sweet boozy chocolaty finish.  F: Body verging on full with a chewy feel, medium-low carbonation, leaving a bit of mild warmth and a slick mouthfeel in between sips.

1549,10672,AlarmClock314,4.71,"2017 version, bottled on 8/4/17, 14.1% ABV, 16.9oz bottle. Appears black with a small sized brown head. Smells of bourbon, oak, vanilla, cocoa, roasted malt, and molasses with a hint of earthy hops and dark fruit. The taste follows exactly with bourbon, oak, roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, and molasses. Medium sweetness, bitterness, and light dryness. A little bit of alcohol is noticeable in the taste and there's some warming. Rich mouthfeel and lower carbonation. If my memory serves me again, this year seemed a little sweeter and stronger on the bourbon, oak, and caramel notes.  2016 version, bottled on 9/6/16, 14.5% ABV, 16.9oz bottle. Seemed to have a little more carbonation/fizz, but everything else pretty much matched the 14 and 13 versions, if my memory serves me right.  2015 version, bottled on 11/11/15, 14.3% ABV, 16.9oz bottle. Lots of tart cherry and raw cocoa powder. The beginnings of a bad bottle for sure, but it was fresh enough to be acceptable. I wouldn't recommend trading for this year's batch since there have been way too many bad bottles.  2014 version, bottled on 9/16/14, 14.4% ABV. This bottle was not as sweet as the 2013 version. Also had a bottle dated 10/24/14, 13.8% ABV. This one seemed a bit more or a bourbon bite.  2013 version, bottled on 8/29/13, 14.9% ABV. Cellared for roughly 2 years. Pours black with a small sized brown head. Smells of mostly cocoa and bourbon. The taste follows closely starting with cocoa, some vanilla and molasses, then ending with oak and bourbon. Great intensity and flavor profile. No noticeable alcohol in the taste but some warming. Thick and luscious mouthfeel with lower carbonation. Like a bourbon chocolate dessert. Aged very well.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma: Rich rich aromas full of bourbon, oak, caramel, salted chocolate and vanilla.  Taste: Much like the aromas it was full of bourbon, oak, caramel, salted chocolate and vanilla. Stunning, heavenly goodness.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, thick motor oil like richness. Low carbonation. Nice light burn as it goes down.  Overall: Wow, this was amazing… a brilliant sipper.

1549,10672,bwood06,4.47,"16.9 oz. bottle into a snifter  A - Beer pours an opaque black color with no visible carbonation. Head is non-existent after a slight fizziness erupted on top, even with a hard pour. Looking at this beer is like looking into the depths of space if space didn't have any stars. Slight motor oil resemblance right around the top edges where the beer meets the glass (surface tension area). 3.75/5  S - Aroma is heavily dominated by vanilla, bourbon, and oak. Very deep dark malty aroma that features ultra dark chocolate and a hint of espresso. The aroma is very heavy and syrupy, like straight molasses. Very grainy and earthy overall, but quite sweet. 4.5/5  T - Vanilla and toffee sweetness hit my palate right away with a quick transition into the oak and bourbon notes. Quite a bit of char and smoke go along with the oak and bourbon. Leather, molasses and vanilla dominate the middle of the tasting before a subtle and slow transition to a deep roasted espresso and ultra dark chocolate finish. 4.5/5  M - Very rich, heavy, creamy, and syrupy. Sticky throughout the entire profile. Carbonation tickle on the very front of the beer. Warming sensation on the back of the palate and the throat upon swallowing. 4.5/5  O - One word...wow... Other than there being no head whatsoever, this beer is very hard to beat and is an explosion of flavors. No flavor is subtle here.

Mouthfeel is excellent, not too much or little carbonation, not too sticky despite the sweetness.

1549,10672,SHDoyle,4.73,"Description: Darth Vader dressed in a ninja suit dark black appearance. Looks silky as it pours and with absolutely no head. Smell is bourbon foremost (shocker) followed by wood/oak and some sort of a dark fruit (grape, raisin, maybe even a hint of raspberry) and a touch of vanilla. Taste is similar to the smell, as bourbon takes center stage with some dark fruit acidity behind it. It's a roasty flavor without any discernible sweetness aside from the bourbon. The finish leaves a noticeable smoky, woody flavor as it goes down. The feel is rich and velvety and this one coats the mouth without being syrupy.  Suggested food pairing: Bacon wrapped shrimp or a juicy beef brisket  If you like this beer then you should also try: Ten FIDY  Overall: 4.75 (This beer is excellent and I would definitely drink it again) This was my first foray into the Bourbon County lineup and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't quite as bourbony as I expected which I actually think was a good thing as it should some more flavor complexity and wasn't one-note.

1549,10672,beerthulhu,4.87,"-2015. Enjoyed in a snifter. Bot. 21oct15. Consumed 12.25.15. Warmed to recommended drinking temp by style.  A: A dark viscose pour produces a darken cherry-mocha capping of 0.5inches with a very audible sense, fizzling to a rather quick demise and patchy covering.  S: Boozy bourbon and chocolate mingle in harmony with a soothing sense of campfire minerality and charred woodiness. Fresh coffee roast is abundant, fresh, wet, silky dark aroma, with some dark fruit of plums and black cherries about. The strength and retention rate is is very nice and lingering.  T: Thick chocolate slurry, with a big bourbon flair and campfire minerality. The coffee roast is oily, wet, and fresh and of the darkest level of intensity, just the way a real coffee drinker likes it. Spicy dark fruit and liquor, roasted barley with hints of burnt brown sugar, caramel-vanilla and scorched barrel woodiness. Roasted pine and spicy hops close things out.  M: The mouthful is creamy and viscose, thick chocolate-barley, that sits heavily on the tongue with a roasted bitterness that glows on the inner cheeks. Heavenly coffee roast feel that lingers on long after the swallow.  O: After several fruitless years of searching i was able to secure a bottle and received one for x-mas. The price tag ($20) and wait was well worth it in the end. A lot of hype surrounds this beer and rightfully so. I rarely give out 5's, but in the end the flavor, intensity, coffee aspect, bourbon flair, and thick viscose mouthful and nature was so overwhelming and perfect in execution, i do not think the human tongue could detect any minor improvements if they could possibly be made. Just like you can't make a beer any hoppier then the tongue can distinguish or beyond the means of alpha acid saturation, i believe you can't make a bourbon barrel aged stout any more bigger, bolder with such a refined drinkability nature as this one. As everyone has their own individual tastes, this is just my personal opinion. This was highly polished with the 14.3% feeling perfect here adding dark and beautiful alcohol tones to the mix. I thought about aging one, but think the late fresh coffee additions after barrel aging would mellow, and this is what makes this beer such a standout, not the base beer, but the barrel aging technique and cold coffee infusion and care that goes into this production and aging that makes it worthy of seeking out and waiting in lines.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Pantalones,4.81,"Written from notes when I had this on Christmas. My first time ever drinking this beer; 16.9 ounce bottle from the 2015 release, with bottling date of October 1st, 2015. Pours with much glug-glug-glugging noise into my tulip-type glass.  The appearance of this beer is... black. Like not just really dark brown, but pitch black. Even the foam on top (which fizzes loudly at first before shrinking to a ring around the outside and a few traces) is pretty dark brown. My little LED flashlight can't penetrate this beer's darkness at all. The foam fizzing away to almost nothing so fast is a bit odd, but otherwise this looks really nice.  Smells sweet, a bit vanilla-ish, and sometimes I pick up on something a bit nutty or woody? Certainly smells different from other stouts I've had, but smells very good. After drinking a bit, I'm picking up a bit more stouty roastiness in the smell. And as a random side-note, apparently bugs LOVE the smell of Bourbon County Stout -- I had to swat three little fruit flies that I wasn't aware were in the room shortly after I started drinking it, as they had started to hover around the glass (and still-partially-full bottle) and I really didn't want to end up drinking some bugs if they decided to dive-bomb it.  Taste... wow! Just a little sip and I got some definite woody/nutty, sweetness, a bit of vanilla, and then a really nice roasty/chocolate/coffee blending together at the end. Burps are like a chocolate milkshake almost immediately after drinking any of this. There's so much going on that I'm having a hard time describing it all -- something about my second sip really reminded me of pecan pie, for example, and I got just a hint of alcohol in there, too. Something reminds me of maple syrup, too. This is by far the sweetest, chocolatiest stout I've ever had! Actually, this is at least as good as the image of ""what a big barrel-aged stout will taste like"" I had in my mind before drinking one, probably better actually. For literally being better than I could even imagine, the taste of this beer earns my first-ever 5/5 score on here.  Definitely feels thicker than most beers I've had. Okay, probably thicker than *all* beers I've had! Even a little sip feels pretty substantial, yet it tastes so good that more than a little sip works too. The alcohol is more noticeable in the mouthfeel than anywhere else, with a bit of warmth the first couple times the beer touches your lips and some definite stomach-warming going on, but for a whopping 13.7% ABV it's almost completely hidden -- I've had 7-8% ABV beers that had more perceived alcohol.  I was actually afraid I'd not like this beer, if you can believe that; I'd never had bourbon or any bourbon-barrel-aged stouts before, and I wasn't sure if any beer could ever live up to the reputation that a beer like this one has (even for someone who doesn't really buy into ""hype."") Now I'm glad I grabbed three bottles when I had the chance -- though two will be shared with family or friends (good Christmas present, huh?), I'll still get to have some of this beer again without having to wait until next Thanksgiving!!  Absolutely DOES live up to its reputation. This is really, really good stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Sabtos,4.39,"Appearance is black with clear mahogany edges and a quickly receding soft mocha fizz that leaves clear legs on the glass.  On both the nose and the palate I get very well dialed in and balanced notes of chocolate, raisin, maple and smoky nutty oak with bourbon that mellows as it warms. It continues to develop as you dig into it, and the complexity makes it apparent how expertly crafted this is, with a deft, balancing touch allowing plenty of room for char, nougat, granola, vanilla, Tootsie Roll, and sweet toffee. As it warms and on the finish, coconut, date, and even hints of dry red wine grapes come in.  The nose hints at a little more heat than actually translates on the palate, which is a nice, comforting surprise. Feel is thick but smooth, almost sticky, but mostly velvety, and actually reducing in heft the longer you sit with it.  I have had a wide variety of vintages at this point, both fresh and at different points in their cellar life cycles, and with the exception of a 2015 draft that potentially had early signs of infection, Bourbon County Brand Stout is an astonishingly consistent gold standard for a style that is more hyped than ever, and Goose Island continues to hit it out of the park despite one significant speed bump of a year.  ---  I've since opened another bad 2015 bottle, and for the record: green olive brine.  ---  I can't help but note, as of 11/22/17, I got to be one of the first in Ohio to ever enjoy one of these on draft during Thanksgiving week, and got to do so as a side by side with this year's first ever Knob Creek Reserve, and there was no contest: this was markedly better. BCBS is unquestionably an expertly crafted barrel-aged stout. This is especially true when considering the fact that it is an originator of such an explosively popular sub-style, and still stands out amongst a younger class of competitors after all these years. This is one to be envied for decades to come, despite the current ownership, and even the QC issues.  ---  As of 2018, their insane consistency remains strong.  ---  My 2019 experience was notable in only that there was nothing new of note, so as Thanksgiving weekend 2020 comes around, I do find the need to make some new remarks here.  The consensus seems to be that this is a unique year, with dark fruit being the predominant flavor descriptor over all else, and I'm in agreement. Not so much in a bad way, but it's more exclusionary than collaborative than it has been before. There's also a Jack & Coke character, with some peppery Maker's Mark qualities.  Overall it seems as though it's been imparted with a bit of a younger spirit via lower quality barrels than past vintages, as if from a fresher liquor that allows for less barrel cohesion, which makes it seems a little less expertly produced than years past, for me.  ---  At the end of 2020, I did a side by side of July 2016 vintage Black Note with a 2013 Bourbon County.  I found the Bell's to have less carbonation than the Goose Island, which is a little odd with the BCBS being 3 years its senior. Additionally, the Bells was more chocolatey, smooth and easy to drink in that regard. It's very nutty with a neutral wood that does not increase any booze. There are additional notes of cigar and a hint of this strange, musky evergreen cologne that my old lady seems to have translated convincingly as honey, but just continues to strike me as some kind of aftershave or deodorant, no matter how faint it is.  Either way, the Black Note is a far more stout-forward beer, whereas the Bourbon County contained much more barrel booze, as well as far more actual bourbon character, bringing with that heat plentiful ribbons of vanilla and coconut. It's almost rum-like, and certainly less stout-forward, but the craziest thing of note to me is that I find absolutely no dark fruit at all, especially since more recent vintages have already started to exhibit raisin and prune characteristics. It's got a lighter body with a nice effervescence that's overall very pleasant and lifting for such a big, deep beer, making it very drinkable in its own way.  There's really no loser here, as both bring quite enjoyable experiences to the table years down the line, but for the record, I gave the edge to BCBS while the old lady stood behind BN.  ---  At the end of February 2021, I opened a 2014 vintage that had an amazing charred maple quality to it. As I found this quality paired with additional notes of Riesen and an underlying peppery barrel heat exhaling a delectable hint of decadent smoke, I couldn't find a single flaw and loved every drop of it.  ---  In 2021, while it's intensely dark fruit forward this year, it's not unenjoyably so. In fact it's quite pleasing where barrel char ribbons thru the malt expressing cocoa dusted date & syrupy molasses. Medium of body, it's frothier yet stinging on the finish. After time, tho, that heat does amplify an unusually acrid bitterness on the back end that BCBS doesn't normally exhibit.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Appearance is straight-up motor oil, with a wisp of a tan head that quickly settled to a thin ring. Everything about this screams ""Bourbon."" Bourbon and barrel dominate the profile, with huge aromas and flavors of molasses and licorice. Not much in the way of char, but there is a ton of alcohol heat.

I can understand all the hype now and can see why it has become so hard to get a hold of. We didn't even get any in the St. Cloud MN area, if it wasn't for Jason I would have missed out yet again. This is a truly world class example of it's style. As a man who's favorite brews tend to be BA Stouts and Barleywines I can say this has rightfully earned it's place in my top brews hierarchy. Even as I have evolved my palate and really become a lot stricter in what I think of brews, this one really stands out to me as wow that wasn't a beer that was an experience. To sum it all up everyone should seek this one out, find someone to enjoy it with (I shared mine with my Bro) and experience the experience that it has to offer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DevWand,4.05,"(Review for the 2015 bottle) First time ever having the BCBS! Although I'm a tad bit disappointed with the initial tasting... I'm definitely looking forward to tasting the brew again, after it ages for a bit.  -Looks like black death; so spot on for a stout. Although absolutely no head at all,,, :( I like head. -Smells like a 14% should smell: You can definitely pick up the booze (in this case a nice bourbon smell), but the molasses/black licorice does a nice job mellowing the alcohol out. -Tastes almost like it smells: Strong bourbon notes, and a (overwhelmingly) strong molasses finish. Picking up slight vanilla, black licorice, (maybe) some carmel.  Solid beer, although a bit too hot for me...(also I find the molasses to be potent as hell)). Welp can't wait to taste after aging, just hope the other flavors decide to show up after having some rest time. Will update after said hibernation!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,spacecake9,5,"I acquired enough of this that I decided to open one now. Poured into a small snifter. A - Pours black with very little head. S - Aroma is molasses, black licorice and booze which I find to be wonderful. T - The flavor is similar to the nose. Definitely molasses and black licorice but also a little chocolate. The booze is just perfect. M - Thick mouth feel, very little carbonation. O - I'm a big believer in letting this beer sit for a year. All of the 2014 bottles I've opened have been awesome. This is a great beer and I can't wait to taste it once it gets a little shelf time on it. That being said, I've had 3 bottles now and I'm convinced the 2015 version is perfect.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Czarkazm,4.55,"Bottled 10/15/2014. 13.8% Pours a deep chestnut brown color, not a completely opaque beer but looks thick and oily nonetheless, with a minimal toasted khaki head that recedes to nothing. The aroma hits you as soon as you hear the hiss, decadent fudge, bourbon, toasted coconut, burnt caramel, oak, vanilla, sweet tobacco, dark fruits, heavy roast, and ash. The body is full but a little thinner than the previous versions (haven't found the '15 yet), not too carbonated, sticky and mouth-coating but nicely balanced between the sweetness, bitter roast, and alcohol heat. There's a savoriness to this beer. Flavor has everything you want in a big barrel-aged stout but I still think this one isn't on par with the other vintages. Dark roasted espresso, black malt, molasses, raisins, bittersweet chocolate, leather, coconut, big barrel character, brown sugar, and licorice candy. I wonder how my 2012 and '13's are doing? Also makes me realize that, despite the price increase this year, it's probably worth grabbing a 2015 vintage, if they're still around...",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The tan head is rather small, even after an aggressive pour, and lasts less than a minute.  S: 4.75 Smells of sweet bourbon and vanilla with moderate roasted malt presence. The aromas really open up as the beer warms to 60 or 65 degrees; more vanilla, molasses, licorice, marshmallow, and coconut start to come through.  T: 4.75 Classic bourbon barrel aged stout – the prototype really. Nearly perfect. Sweetness kicks things off with vanilla, marshmallow, bourbon, caramel, and coconut. Gradually, the roasted malt takes over, first brining bittersweet chocolate and licorice, then moderate levels of coffee. The finish is slightly bitter, blending nicely with a last bit of sweetness and dark berries.  M: 4.75 Thick and rich. Pretty low level of carbonation – great for the style.  O: 4.75 Not sure why it took so long to review this beer. I guess I thought I’d rate if fresh, and wow is the 2015 is great fresh (as were other vintages).

Thick body with fair amount of astringency – not syrupy and leaves a pleasant, sweet malty finish with the barest hint of a bourbon twang. Increases in complexity as it warms. . .

So at a club price of 8.09 a bottle two cases came home with me.  Look: not as black as you would think. Imagine brown ink. Has a small head that dissipates quickly.  Smell: bourbon, spice (maybe the fusels showing up), oak, toasted oak, caramel, and lots of chocolate.  Taste: Being an avid bourbon drinker, this was everything I wanted in a bourbon beer. It has all the pleasantries of bourbon but without the heat. There is some heat from the alcohol, but, boy is this a sweet bomb. If it wasn't 10 bucks a bottle I would make an ice cream float out of it.  Feel: Amazingly they are able to capture some of the same oiliness that my favorite bourbons have. There is thicker viscosity to this beer. Not chewy, but thick.  Overall: Glad I got two cases, this is in my top three beers.

As it warmed, tons and tons of aroma coming out. Vanilla, Coffee, Chocolate, bourbon, I was most surprised by a cinnamon scent. ~5  T: Followed the nose pretty closely, minus the cinnamon. lots of sweetness, as expected and the bourbon was perfect, not overwhelming at all. The chocolate and vanilla were both prevalent. I also picked up some raisin as the beer warmed. The very last sip was above room temp due to my hand warmth and I could really taste the malted barley and cereal flavors. Everything was in perfect balance. ~5  F: I found it to be very smooth in the mouth. It was far from thin but moved easily through the mouth and down the throat. Medium to full body. I think it worked well though, nothing about the beer was harsh. ~4.5  O: This may be up there with the best beer I've ever had.

It was poured at around 70deg and as it sat in the glass and what little carbonation dissipated the legs that developed were mesmerizing.

Complex and satisfying sipped for over an hour.  The Feel : thick on the tongue and filled the mouth, no alcohol burn at all, but warmed the chest.  Overall : I felt like I should have been sitting in a hunting lodge by a fire after a long day riding and enjoying a good cigar, not sitting in my office. This is truly an elite beverage.

From the tap there is more of a noticeable head as you would expect. The aroma on this beer is amazing. Right up front there is a ton of bourbon and alcohol followed by all the notes a stout should hit. The taste matches the smell. It is a little hotter from the bottle than from the tap.

1549,10672,jmasher85,4.73,"This year is my first trip to Bourbon County. I got 2 bottles of this one plus a Rare, Regal Rye, and Barleywine after about 7 hours of waiting in line...not too shabby. I also got a nice BCBS 2015 Spielgau tulip snifter for free at the event, which of course I am drinking out of for this review.  First things first, the hype is real! Okay, maybe not wake up at absurd hours and freeze your petunia off on a holiday weekend real, but this is quite possibly one of the thickest, mightiest, most intense and all-encompassing stouts I have ever had, on par with Founders KBS and Avery Uncle Jacob's. What I wouldn't give to someday do a side-by-side and see who the real winner is...  It pours an opaque black hole with a thick head about a shade darker than my khakis. Immediately the smell pours forth, and there isn't a whole lot that I'm not getting here. On first sniff, there's the obligatory rich chocolate, bourbon, and oak. Smelling more deeply gets molasses, figs, dates, barbecue smoke, and a lot of roasted barley, and a gallon of booze. A hint of vanilla, but not much despite it being written right there on the label.  Sidenote, my cat did NOT like the smell, and he usually tries to steal all my food.  Normally I'd notice flavor before mouth feel, but the first thing I noticed when I was sipping this was that it feels like you're sipping oil. It's so thick, slippery, and sticky that it just sits on your tongue and lips and never goes away. Possibly the thickest, oiliest beer I've ever encountered.  But look out folks, because Bourbon County is Flavor Country! If you've ever tasted a barrel-aged stout, this is similar but a million times more so. (If you haven't, try a few before trying BCBS or you will spoil yourself forever of them.) A ton of alcohol burn makes it tough to put down more than a small sip at a time. Seriously, trying to get a big gulp would probably just trigger your gag reflex, that's how thick and boozy it is. But tons of bourbon flavor, but still tastes like a stout, chocolate, caramel, toasted malts, a hint of salty soy sauce...  Overall, this is one of the most stout stouts I've ever had. I totally get it. Is any beer worth disrupting your life for? Who knows? I had a ton of fun getting mine, but not sure if I'd do it again, especially these days where equal or almost equally good options are starting to appear and are less exclusive. But don't let the hype detract from the fact that this is truly and world-class imperial stout that deserves the highest honors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

An aggressive pour yields a finger of mocha brown head that quickly fades away into a thin ring that leaves splotchy along the glass. The nose is a mostly sweet blast of bourbon and vanilla, butterscotch, and caramel, with faint bitter cocoa, dates, and raisins. The flavors just melt in your mouth. Bourbon candy. Sweet yet balanced, creamy and smooth. The flavor of bourbon without the heat. Butterscotch, caramel, and brown sugar. Tons of vanilla. Plenty of dark chocolate, toast, and coffee behind the butterscotch-bourbon-vanilla sweetness. A smattering of dark fruits like dates, prunes, and raisins to compliment it. The mouthfeel is not thick or sludgy but is very oily, slick, and creamy. Drinks insanely easy for this high of abv.  I'm overjoyed that I was finally able to snag this.

1549,10672,do_ob,4.51,"250th beer review!  2015 edition. 500 mL bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a medium-dark brown and settles pitch black in the glass. About 1/2 a finger of dark tan head initially - this quickly fizzed down to a thin skirt that hung around the edges. HUGE aroma on this beer. I could smell it as I was pouring. Strong notes of bourbon, chocolate, burnt wood, molasses, caramel, vanilla, and maple syrup. Not a strong roasty malt smell, suprisingly. Awesome balanced aroma, and thankfully not overly boozy. The taste follows right along, not missing a beat. Delicious, sweet carmelized bourbon, oakey bitter coffee and chocolate, sweet vanilla, sticky molasses...wow. Notes of vanilla and caramel become more pronounced on the aftertaste. Great feel on this, too. Nice and dense but not to the point of being overly chewy. Incredibly smooth for 13.8%. While it is a tad hot, I'd say 8 months in the cellar would even this thing out to perfection. Incredibly well balanced and crafted.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Arkrebel,4.72,I have always been just marginally interested in Goose Island beers. Their 312 and Honkers Ale are usually pretty safe choices when found on tap but not necessarily what I would call the top in their respective catagories.  Having said that the barrel aged Bourbon County Stout really impressed me. The flavor is complex enough that several sips are needed to really get the flavor profile.  My wife is not nearly as adventurous as I am in beers. She typically universally does not like the stout varieties. She tried this one and while it's not her new favorite beer she did try more than one taste and was impressed by the complexity of the flavors.  I plan to get three more of these as soon as I can. Two will be opened and shared on a beach in Florida preferably with a nice robust cigar. The other I will try to cellar for a while but I make no guarantees.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smooth chocolate and bourbon vanilla with light oak and raisin and a chocolate linger. Silky smooth with a milky full body.  Extremely smooth and well balanced flavors.

What little there is laces lightly to the glass then disappears within thirty seconds. It is a deep deep brown, on the verge of black, like used engine oil. Swirl it lightly and the sugars coat the glass and make legs.  The first smell is just overwhelmingly heaven. It smells of primarily of chocolate, with roasted malt and grain mixed in for the perfect stout nose. As it breathes, the bourbon shows up in the nose, masking the stout.  The taste is heavenly! The bourbon is there, but unbelievably balanced through the palate. After the swallow, the warmth creeps in with a taste of bourbon. Sip slowly and savor the roast.

1549,10672,DoctorD,4.47,"2015 bottle - very rich stout with a surprisingly balanced bourbon taste. I am not a huge fan of bourbon-aging because they usually are hot and taste like someone dumped a whiskey in a beer. But I can see why this is highly rated - it's smooth and the bourbon tastes like an integral part instead of something tossed in at the end. Full, lingering taste with no bitter bite or hot aftertaste. I would prefer GI had kept the 12oz bottle format instead of the 500ml bottles because this is pushing the limit of how much I would want to drink in one sitting. There are so many bourbon stouts out now that, while perhaps not as smooth as this, don't require an adventure to obtain them.

The color is absolutely jet black with no head or lacing to speak of, which is why I only gave it a 4 for ""look."" I assume that's due to the high ABV. What an aroma! Bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, and smoke. Maybe a little molasses, as well. I've never smelled a beer better than this one. The taste is huge: bourbon forward with a strong alcohol burn but the chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and raisin blend beautifully. This is a delightfully full-bodied stout; it's almost chewy, the way fine stout should feel. The 13.7% ABV hits hard; I wouldn't mind if it were a little less boozy. Putting aside the controversy of Goose Island's ownership, BCBS continues to merit the hype.

Smell is incredibly boozy and bourbon-rich, with sweet toffee, vanilla, candied fruit, and sherry notes. The taste is where this beer really goes to eleven. The booziness amazingly becomes somewhat masked. What takes over is a luscious, sweet, rich vanilla silk with toffee, dark fruit, caramelized maple syrup, rich oak char, and malt for days. The aftertaste is the best part, with waves of each aforementioned flavor taking turns. The feel is, unsurprisingly, thick and rich and syrupy. I was worried the hype would be much greater than the product, but this is a fantastic beer. Clearly not something I could drink much of in one sitting.

1549,10672,teromous,4.07,"This is a review of the 2015 vintage. The bottle says ""21OCT15 1704 14.3 ALC/VOL""  Appearance: No real head. It starts to form a very thin dark brown cap and it instantly fades to a hair-thin ring around the glass with what looks like an oil-slick of miniature bits of foam on the surface. No head means no retention and no lacing. The body of the beer is pitch black.  Aroma: Not much aroma here...there is a very faint sweet bourbon scent but I nearly have to submerge my nose to pick it up. Alcohol is apparent on the nose but this is negligible given that this is a 14.3% beer. Overall the aroma is much weaker than the majority of Imperial Stouts that I've had.  Taste: The beer is full of strong dark chocolate flavor that has a nice rich wonderful presence. The bourbon is there as well which really rounds out the overall profile of the beer and complements the chocolate character. It has a light toast at the end but it is very well balanced...not acrid at all. While the bourbon is present the beer doesn't come across as boozy.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is very thick, rich, and smooth. That smoothness is cut a bit by alcohol burn but at 14.3% that really can be expected. It's a slow drinking sipping beer. Carbonation does feel low as the beer is still and brings no life across the palate. The beer is slightly sticky and lingers on the palate long after drinking  Overall: It is a very nice Imperial stout. Although the beer is already aged I noticed most people waited a year to review the previous batches. I wanted to see how it stacked up fresh. The appearance and aroma were sub-par or average at best but where this beer really shines is in the flavor...which is where it counts the most. The overall drinking experience was enjoyable.

No head on my pour, so no lacing, just a film of alcohol on the glass, but still nice aroma and BOOZY (not a bad thing)!  However, the sweetness intensity is more than I can handle! Way too heavy on the maple syrup/cherries/molasses, dominate the flavor profile for me, with maybe a hint of vanilla. Not getting any other notes?

Smell is instant bourbon, tons of barrel, hints of booze, malts, smoke. Taste is superb, if you want a bourbon bomb, this is it. Never too sweet, but backbone of tons of malt, molasses, chocolate, segues into the notes of bourbon, lots of wood, smoke, barrel, char. Finish lingers for days, never seems to escape your mouth. Some carbonation to break up the fan fare, definitely heavy body and very sticky in the mouth. Bourbon bomb, period, very well crafted.

Rising bubbles are small in size and subtle in quantity. Lacing is thin and very subtle. 3.25 SMELL: Very strong aromas of molasses, plums, raisins, and figs entangle with mild aromas of vanilla, bourbon, and sweet chocolate. Subtle aromas of sweet coffee, oak, and hints of bitter roasted malts support the obvious sweet goodness. 4.5 TASTE: Initial taste is of very strong flavors of molasses, plums, raisins, and figs along with strong sweet chocolate flavors that are immediately followed by mild borubon and vanilla flavors. Mild flavors of sweet coffee and subtle flavors of oak step onto the palate right after. Hints of bitter roasted malts enter lastly as all previous flavors persist, except for bourbon flavors, which grow slightly stronger. 4.75 FEEL: Medium-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a slight dryness. A heavy, but welcoming alcoholic warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat. 4.0 NOTE: Why have I waited so long to try this??? I know. It's because I don't like bourbon. But this was EXTREMELY sweet (I do have a gargantuan sweet tooth) instead of being extremely bourbony like I thought it was going to be.

Poured into a snifter - a nice black color, with a tan head. Instantly my smelling senses were hit with bourbon, vanilla and coffee.

Smelled of bourbon, boozy, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, toffee, burnt sugars, tons of barrel character, oaky, coconut, vanilla, marshmallow. Taste followed the nose to a tee with the exception of sweetness: this beer was over the top sweet for me and had a strong of fusel alcohols left in there even after a year in the cellar. It needs more time to mellow out. The taste was a bit too sweet for me on this one but it certainly has enough residual sugars to last for many years to come in a cellar under proper conditions. The rating is high because it was an excellent brew but I believe it can get better.  4/14/2016 2015 vintage served in a teku  Appearance: I do like the new bottle size. The beer poured a jet black with very little head and no lacing. Thick as motor oil.

Very refined, chocolate, sweet malts, bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coconut, oaky, delicious, a little boozy  Overall: there is a reason this beer is rated so high. There is nothing wrong with it at all. I would like more carbonation but that may happen as the beer ages and thins out. Some have reported off flavors but I find none at all. Well done Goose Island.  03/2017 2014 Bottle served in a snifter.  Still the king! Age has barely touched this one. This is world class and has serious pedigree.

The lacing is next to none. Smell is hot bourbon/alcohol, heavy chocolate, caramel, vanilla and sweet dark fruit. Taste is similar and less boozy than the smell with some nice smokiness on the finish. Sweet for sure, but not at all cloying. Feel is full, thick and coats your entire mouth with the slightest burn from alcohol on the back end. Overall this is a fantastic beer, but I prefer it with some age on it.

1549,10672,LloydDobler,5,"'14 vintage  I haven't had one of these in months and this is my first time reviewing it. Keeping this one simple. Pours like black, liquid silk. The thinnest smattering of bubbles fizzes away in seconds, leaving my snifter looking like a floating 8-ball. The nose is a nice dose of bourbon with sugared rasins, dates(or something along those lines), and semi-sweet chocolate. The taste is such a smooth experience, with the bourbon up front but not boozy or abrasive at all. A little bitter chocolate and wood linger on the palate with a slight tinge of bourbon sour. Thick and creamy texture. Everything about this beer is crafted with the most delicacy. The favors meld perfectly together and the high ABV is completely forgettable as you are enjoying this easy drinking brew.  Edited 2/6/16: '14 a perfect 5 after revisiting.

1549,10672,TheElectricOne,4.48,"Edited up from 4.34 last year to the current rating. Have had every year from 2012-present, and this was my favorite regular yet. Poured from the 16.9oz bottle into a snifter:  Appearance: jet black, with a beautiful mocha-colored head comprised of tons of tiny bubbles. Small, and fleeting, but impressive that a 14.3% brew can sustain any head at all. Beer is clear viscous and sticky just by swirling, with deep brown highlights as you swirl.  Aroma: the most powerful scent I've had in a regular BCBS, this years explodes with scent right after the cap comes off. I smelled leather and some soy sauce at first, and then tons of bittersweet baking chocolate. More heat than I anticipated, with some vanilla-bourbon aromas present also.  Taste: luscious and decadent, it starts sweet and chocolatey with lots of bitter espresso roast and bakers chocolate. Quite a bit of roast in the middle, with some woody notes, and a relatively hot finish. It was great, perhaps a TOUCH too hot, but still excellent. When I have another one of these in a couple months, I bet it'll be even better.  Feel: viscous and sticky, with a light carbonation that tickles the tongue and definitely enhances the brew. Finishes as stated above, very hot. You can feel the booze when you exhale after swallowing.

1549,10672,biboergosum,4.19,"12oz bottle, 2014 version, thanks to rogerdandy for the share.  This beer pours a solid black, but with prominent red and mahogany tints when pressed to the light, and a thin cap of wispy and ephemeral brown head, which leaves a bit of paramecia lace around the glass as it quickly abates.  It smells of musty treacle, bittersweet cocoa powder, sozzled dark orchard fruit (plums, prunes, and bitter bing cherries), an under the stairs dankness, cafe-au-lait, and faint earthy, weedy, and leafy hops. The taste is big, rich milk chocolate, a muddled black fruitiness, anise root, caramel/toffee malt, brown sugar, well-creamed coffee, some warming vanilla from the wood, and some very laid-back booze acridity.  The carbonation is quite low in its sedate frothiness, the body a solid-punching heavyweight, and rather smooth, with an attendant creaminess. It finishes fairly sweet, the cocoa, sugary caramel, and sauced fruit all entertaining us while they wait for their ride home.  Well, few products stand up to such high expectations, and I gotta say that this is one of them - large, but restrained in its massive stout fury. Maybe a little hot on the nose, but s'all good after that, nice and warming, and more or less worth the lengthy wait in my own small corner of the beer world.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,VikingBeer,4.59,"Serving type: a 2013 vintage, on tap at the great Beer Trappe, Lexington, KY. From notes dated 6/5/15. Beautiful pour: rich, oily, viscous-looking black liquid, with a pretty, rich brown head that lasts less long than I expected, and lacing that persists far longer. Smell is bourbon, rich, chocolate, coffee, and a maduro-tobacco sweetness, with a hint of smoke. Taste is...wow. An absolute bomb of flavor, mirroring the nose closely: bourbon, oak, coffee, dark (yet sweetish) chocolate, with occasional hints of spice and dark fruit. Rich mouthfeel, although over the 30-45 minutes I sipped my 13-ounce pour the carbonation fell off a good bit, making it seem a bit flat and syrupy for the last couple of ounces. I struggled a bit in rating this one for flavor; it's not as complex as, for instance, the great vintages of ""Black Note,"" or, for that matter, the Bourbon County Barleywine. However, the two to three extra years of age on this one may have mellowed it a bit more than it needed. However, the definition and intensity of the flavors that ARE there, the drinkability and well-hidden alcohol, and the excellence of the overall taste experience compel me to rate it as I did. Well done, Goose Island.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,FLima,4.4,"I have saving this 2012 edition for a while, let’s see how this evolved. Deepest possible black color with a thick one finger dark caramel head with very short retention and no laces. Delicious aroma with notes of cocoa, bourbon, some roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, licorice, molasses, coconut and charred wood. All behaving well. Incredible that the alcohol of 15% is not there, no burning on your nostrils. Luscious flavor with notes of molasses, slightly peppery and earthy hops, bourbon, cocoa, cinnamon, oak, lactic acid, cola, charred wood, lots of vanilla, fig jam, dark fruits, burnt coconut, mild tobacco and dark chocolate. Not overly sweet. Dry aftertaste with a rounded bitterness and its lingering notes. Viscous and velvet body with proper carbonation. Alcohol of 15% abv is superbly disguised. Great brew, it is a very complex and elegant stout. In my opinion what is actually behind its cult/hype besides its complexity, although not necessarily conscious, it is its perfect balance with relatively medium to high intensity flavors. Bourbon is not really the leading role; actually you have to think which one should be. They are mostly intense individually, though not overwhelming. The whole bottle went down easy; sipping this all along was pleasant and not cloying. But with you want Bourbon to rule and still leave room for other players, I would prefer the amazing Thirsty Dog Wulver Wee Heavy Ale (though different style).

Vanilla, caramel, roasted malt and of course bourbon are dominate on the nose. As strong as it is, the boozy taste is not as much as you might expect a 14.4% to be and should recede over time (plan to store as many as I can keep my hands off of).

Keep it comin’ keep it comin’. Vanilla, chocolate; the bourbon is present unlike many of the style. F- Just thick enough, coats the mouth and remains there.

Lots of vanilla, Carmel, and malt come through with chocolate and dark fruit from the base beer. The fruitiness takes over a little too much and I wish there was a little more on offer from the base stout, but the bourbon treatment really makes this a nice treat.

Aroma of bourbon: some licorice aroma at 50 degrees Head – none Lacing – none Body dark brown/black, opaque Flavor very much of bourbon with vanillin present. Alcohol present. No hops, no diacetyl. Immediate stomach burn. Palate full, oily, flat  New review 15 Jun 22  Bourbon County Brand Stout (2021) from Goose Island (OWNED BY ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV). Picked up at Hilltop Beverages, Franklin, Pa. $ 13.52 (Including tax)/16.9 oz bottle ($ 0.80/oz). On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 15/06/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Stamped on front label “DRINK BY 05 JUL 26”. Served at 56.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 62.7 degrees. Appearance – 3.25 First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), translucent. Body – Deep Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but it is possible to see some precipitate on the inside curvature of the glass. Head – Average (Maximum 1.8 cm, aggressive center pour), initially russet then oxidizing to wheat, high density, short retention, diminishing to a 0.4 cm high density crown fed by effervescence producing several small islands of bursting bubbles as a cap. Lacing – Poor -Thin band of extremely tiny bubbles, rapidly rejoining the remaining head. Surprising that any lacing occurs, even something as transitory as this! Aroma – 4 – Weak bourbon and some chocolate fudge, just a hint of dark fruit (dates). No hops, no yeast. Flavor – 4 – Follows the nose with bourbon predominating followed by weak chocolate fudge and maybe some dates. No yeast and no hops. Seems rich. No ethanol (14.0 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Gastric warming occurs but never gets offensive. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends well-balanced between bitter and semi-sweet. Palate – 4.5 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation. The wheat no doubt helps smooth it out. Final impression and summation: 4 Appearance is the same as almost all imperial stouts, sans lacing. Flavor and aroma are consistent with bourbon barrel aging. The palate is excellent! Overall, this is a good imperial stout but not significantly better than most of the BBA impy stouts on the market – certainly not enough to justify either the hype or the price point.   Appearance 3.5, Aroma 3.75, Flavor at almost one year: 4, Palate 3.5, Overall 3.75. Allowed to warm to 50 degrees, alcohol flavor is less harsh. Other than that, no appreciable change.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The alcohol flavor is there particularly in the after taste. You can taste the barrel wood. It warms you up like a dessert liqueur, bourbon or cognac. Supremely thick, full bodied and viscous feel. This is certainly a sipper. This one is not for the faint of heart and certainly not to be drunk when you want something light and crispy to cool off. It is a beer that feels more like a hard liquor.

Full wafts of chocolate and vanilla. There are also hints of caramel and smoky greatness.  Taste: An instant fruity bite quickly followed by a shot of bourbon. The whiskey fades and I was then left with coffee, caramel, molasses, and chocolate swirling flavors with a hint of cherry.  Feel: Mouth-feel is a very full bodied / thick and oily feeling that coats the tongue.  Overall: An amazing beer that I highly recommend.

Less than a finger of head. Swirling I can see some alcohol legs. S: Little bit of dark fruit. Roasty. Bourbon. Cocoa. Some vanilla undertones. Slight booziness. T: Big coffee, roasty, bourbon and cocoa flavors up front. Finishes with cocoa and whiskey lingering in the aftertaste. M: Heavy yet incredibly smooth. Goes down very nicely with light carbonation complimenting the flavors perfectly. Coats your mouth and leaves you wanting more. O: Very intense. Worth savoring each sip.

A — Pours a deep and dark nearly black hue into the glass, super dark and rich looking, thick and oily, brown tinged edges.

T — Quite sweet and rich, lots of chocolate, oak, cinnamon, licorice, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, quite hot and sweet.  M — Very thick and sticky. Long lasting finish.

The beer is inky black, not redness on the edges here. The nose is rather subdued here, unlike most stouts, I have no hint of coffee at all. There is some mild candied fruit, but it is very mild. The taste is a bit malty up front, quickly fades to some very sweet malt, and then fades with a lingering boozy sweetness. This beer has great mouthfeel and is silky smooth. Beer is a bit boozy, but nothing extreme. Its also a bit sweeter than anything that I am used to but its not bad at all.

TASTE: Tastes like bourbon with the sharp boozy alcohol bite removed. (So like bourbon with the volume turned down?) Rich and complex. Notes here like leather and smoke, a slight touch of chocolate. But bourbon is running the show from start to finish. Everything else is just part of the chorus.  FEEL: In a word: sumptuous. Rich and oily. Thick and chewy.

I am thinking the case I purchased is not enough! Creamy full mouth feel remains constant with this beer. The pronounced alcohol flavor which is this beer's main distractor, is subsiding quite a bit and the chocolate is becoming more pronounced and I like it a lot. If this beer holds up or improves over the rest of the year it will threaten Bomb! as my favorite stout.  March 2015. Bottle. Restaurant. 4.75+3.75+4+5+4.25. Approximately Cellar to start. Beautiful looking dark beer with minor head. Smell includes chocolate with strong roast that is almost coffee-like. But also, strong bourbon. That smell mellowed a bit over time. Flavor was similar to smell. The bourbon mellowed a bit during the middle but reappeared toward the end. The mouthfeel redefined what a score of 5 is to me. Incredibly smooth, creamy, thick, lush. I do not care for a strong bourbon taste and this has it, even though it's a bit mellow, but I would drink this again just for how it feels! If you like bourbon aged stouts, I strongly suggest you get ahold of this beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,tillmac62,4.52,"BOD 8/29/14. Pours dark as a starless night. Almost no head, but being barrel aged, this is acceptable.  Tremendous nose led off by bourbon. Underneath are dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel and hints of dark fruit (plum) and oak.  Heavy full bodied with a texture that goes beyond creamy to the point of being thick. Above normal carbonation with effervescence from the middle on. Palate perfection.  The flavor profile is World Class. This is quite intense in terms of bourbon and alcohol and results in the complexity being slightly muted by these intensities. Balance is reasonable, all things considered, as the other flavors pop in the middle. It begins with bourbon over a rich caramel and chocolate sweetness. As the bourbon fades, alcohol comes to the forefront. In the middle, the alcohol flavor masking effect fades and the complexity of this stout becomes discernible. Waves of vanilla, sweet chocolate and slight plum cascade over an oak background. The finish is a slow fade of sweet caramel and vanilla over a receding oak. The finish leaves that burn at the back of throat, an astringent alcohol pucker and a touch of sweet caramel and chocolate.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,brurevu,4.75,"The Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout gets its reputation for a reason. It is a full tilt face melting drinking experience that starts at your lips and rides down your throat grabbing every pore of your internal orifice on its way. The beer poured an opaque black with a subtle tan head. The bourbon aroma hit me when I opened the bottle and continued to waft from the glass as I leaned in for my first anticipatory sip. I also detected vanilla and hints of anise coming from the glass. The taste took over my mouth with a huge hit of bourbon that melded into large doses of vanilla and cocoa. There was a slight burnt bitterness at the tail end that lingered along with the bourbon. The BCBS was a big bourbon bomb that was surprisingly smooth and drinkable considering the ABV. With more and more Bourbon Barrel-Aged beers on the market it is still at the top of the list and one that should be emulated.

Smells of banana, wheat, graham cracker, dough and mild notes of chocolate.  Tastes very similar to how it smells. Every sip I taste something different, very enjoyable experience. It can be both very sweet and somewhat bitter. It definitely is a beer that one must take their time with in order to fully appreciate it.

Poured hard, yielded a brief deep brown head that quickly collapsed to nothing. Looks like your average strong stout.  Aroma: Really sweet, almost cloying at times. Muted notes of vanilla and sweet malts. Alcohol present in the nose, but not overwhelmingly so.  Taste: Wow, very surprised how this one came together here. The beer is dominated by the vanilla flavors from the barrel and the bourbon, so much so that the stout base was almost completely overwhelmed other than just the softest assertion of roasty sweetness. This is almost like drinking a dark-chocolate vanilla espresso bean. Lots of alcohol, but masked nicely. Exceedingly drinkable for how big this beer is.  Mouthfeel: Huge body, viscous, and silky.  Overall: It's not rated a 100 for nothing. This is not the best beer I've ever had, but it's up there. Extremely good beer, and one I will enjoy for years to come.

Two days old I had too have a fresh one to compare to a nice aged one. By far my number one bourbon stout. Not happy with the packaging change. Not goose island fault. Inbev. That said as always an exceptional bourbon stout. Extremely complex. Must be room temp to drink and in a snifter otherwise you lose 60% of its true flavor.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,galwayjoyce,3.6,"I am confused regarding the hype. This beer is overly boozy, unbalanced, and holds on to it's reputation through name cache, and high ABV. Goose Island is part of the macro world now...can we stop pretending it is so mind-bending? I get it--it comes with the beer Connoisseur training package, but there are other imperial stouts that deserve our attention more.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Hab11,5,"Bourbon County Stout 2014 from a 12oz. Bottle. Reviewed with Three Lions. Look: Molassaes Color, dark like the back of a closet during a power outage. Slight caramel head. Very little lacing but leaves resin up the glass. Smell: chocolate liqueur nose and can definitely get some of the oak from the barrel. Would love to know the bourbon that was in the barrel as it has a smoothness to it that's appealing. Chocolate Nibs with some sort of plum or date. Taste: A lot a like a Milkyway Midnight. Vanilla, Chocolate, Cherry Cordial, caramel malt. So much more going on I can even describe. This is packed with flavors. The alcohol definitely comes through. Again would love to know the brand of Bourbon. Mouthfeel: sticky like a good single malt bourbon or scotch, syrupie but not overly so. It is very creamy mid tongue. Finishes hot like a whiskey. Overall: Three Lions wasn't lying this is incredible.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ThreeLions,4.94,"Reviewed with Hab11. Picked up this gem to share with my brother in law. Have had multiple times, first time reviewing it. Here goes: At first pour this beer comes out the color of spent motor oil. Faintest hint of head quickly dissipates leaving a molasses colored beer. Upon swirling the beer leaves a syrupy resinous coating along the sides of the glass. Aroma: what a smell. The alcohol (at 13.8%) is far from hidden. Intense burn. Dark fruit and wood come through up front with chocolate notes in the background. It is like a rich chocolate liquer. Taste: Taste is an obvious 5. So rich. Dark chocolate milky way? My god this is rich. I feel like I'm drinking a dessert. A very boozy dessert I might add. The look on my sister's face when she had a sip said it all. So comical. This is an intense beer. It's so heavy, so thick and creamy, so boozy...it's over the top. Mouth: in general I hate putting numbers to or talking about mouthful but this was an easy 5. From the first sip I knew it was a 5 before any hint of flavor was processed. So thick and perfect. Overall. What is there to say really? It's a near flawless beer. If you enjoy barrel aged stouts then you need to seek out this brew. If you aren't familiar then this would be a great place to start but beware because setting the standard with this...this benchmark will leave you let down by a large number of other beer claiming to deliver a similar product.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T - Very sweet front, with that soy sauce bourbon taste. Middle is a bit chocolately. The finish is a slightly bitter coffee. The presence of the alcohol is very noticeable.  M - Very thick and smooth. Strong alcohol burn.  O - A very very intense taste and smell. Very sweet, and the alcohol really packs a punch.

T- Bourbon forward.. big surprise. Chocolate and coffee in the backseat. Some vanilla and oak also present. Follows the nose.  M- Full bodied yet silky and smooth. Definitely needs to be served a little less than room temperature. The heat is a nice finish.  O- A prime example of a barrel aged stout. Almost flawless.

1549,10672,majorbase2,4.6,"Pours a stark black color with a motor oil consistency. Very small brown head that quickly dissipates. No lacing. The glass might've well been painted black.  Aroma is excellent. The bourbon is there. Heavily roasted chocolate notes as well.  Bourbon comes in strong. Wood, smoky flavor. A little bit of chocolate. Some creamy vanilla. Dark fruits. A good amount of bite from the alcohol. I'm not the biggest fan of BA beers, as sometimes I feel the bourbon dominates, but this one is done masterfully. The taste improves as it warms, as all the flavors blend even more. Hard to describe everything going on in the taste, but man is it something. The flavors are so strong, you can almost chew them. The chocolate is like a dark chocolate candy melting on the tongue. The vanilla is like a thick vanilla creamer pouring into the mouth. The bourbon, is, well, bourbon.  Heavy bodied. Thick and creamy. Pours down the throat. Definitely a sipper, but despite the ABV it doesn't go down with too much of a burn. Definitely a bite, but not as much as you'd expect. I could down a few of these (not sure that the wallet could handle it, though!)  Honestly, I couldn't believe I came across this bottle in a relatively small town.

T - Even more intense than it smells! The booziness makes itself known, but not overbearing. Huge bourbon woodiness on the tongue, cascading deep dark chocolatey goodness, some coffee vanilla bitterness, lots of dark malts and hops, and a finish of bourbon burn, like a brandy bean candy. Delicious.  F - So thick and chewy, I feel like I should be eating it was a fork and knife. Sticks to my mouth like glue, delicious boozy glue. Wonderful.  O - I was a little buzzed when I drank this, but I instantly sobered up to enjoy the experience, and man am I happy I did. This was back in early 2014 when I imbibed this fine beverage, and haven't been able to find it since, but I'm so happy I got to try what was referred to me as the father of all stouts by the bartender ( I had a Six Point Resin, Goose Island BC Barleywine, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy before this).

Taste is phenomenal! This beer is thick… I mean it coats the palate! Intense flavors of vanilla, bourbon, coffee, and some maple syrup. A huge kick of alcohol at the end that warms and provides a nice flavor. The bourbon is the star of this beer. It is so intense that ALL stouts will fail in comparison. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS BEER! Very little carbonation. No hops present. No bitterness. Just smooth, thick, bourbon laced beer.  This is by far the best stout I have ever tried.

The bourbon was foremost, but it wasn't drowning in booze as I had expected, and was mixed with sweet notes of molasses and a hint of coffee. Delicious.

1549,10672,spidermite,4.41,"my first experience with this beer was in a 6 oz snifter , after I had already destroyed my palate with a imperial IPA. It was delicious and very thick. I knew I liked it but I wasn't sure how altered it was from the first beer. So the next day I got two orders poured into a larger glass :). It is very bourbon forward in smell, the only other thing I could pull out aroma wise was a fruit that reminded me of plums...But not any plums , the plums I used to steal off my great grandmas tree on hot days the warm fresh plum only a kid could love. As I remembered it had a very thick mouth-feel and the after-feel was that of clean barley-wine buried in an oak coffin. The entire drinking sensation was more of a neurological experience reconnecting me to smells and memories of picking fruit and stealing bourbon from my grandad's pantry that i had long forgotten.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Gregfalone,4.69,"Starts with the opening of the bottle. This is fresh. Bottled 8/2914 and opened 12/23/14.  I opened it and sniffed the bottle. At first I thought it smelled a little off. I was worried.  The pour  I pourd it into a medium snifter. From an inch over the rim I saw absolutely no head forming. Again, I was worried. I gradually raised the bottle , by the end of the pour I was pouring from about 15"" above the rim of the glass.  About 1/2"" of head formed, and my worries lessened. This beer is pitch black pouring and in the glass with no light showing through anywhere. Sniffed it again and it was much more appealing after being poured. The dirty feet smell was gone. Taste-  This beer tastes amazing. Dark fruit, chocolate, hints of coffe, dates, worchestershire, the sweet taste from fine bourbon, oak, sherry, vanilla... It's all there.  Feel is thick and viscous, perfection. I almost wanted to chew this beer.  Overall this is one of the best beers in the world in my opinion. Beats the abyss. Beats parabola. Beats westvleteren 12.

1549,10672,humuloner22,4.32,"This is a good beer. Not what its gets the hype about and definitely not worth the annoyance of seeking it out. Very bourbon forward. Bu t this beer is thin for the style. Everyone talks this beer up and thinks its the best thing ever but truly it really isn't that fantastic. I have had BA stouts that were better balanced. If I want to drink bourbon I will and if I want to drink a stout I will. This is the 14.4 edition by the way (2014). Its a good beer but it is more overhyped to me than it is worth seeking out. If it was a regular beer sitting on a shelf and people could buy it every day unlike the current situation of Black Friday, this would be among the higher echelons of beerdom, but all things considered its not worth the craziness.  Appearance: Black, no head whatsoever.  Smell: strong bourbon and chocolate. It smells amazing!  Taste: not as good as the aroma would let you believe.  Overall: This is an overhyped beer like no other. I bought a bunch of this one but this was the only 14.4 version I had tonight I also have the other abv 13.8, I think? Its a tasty beer, but as far as BA stouts go, this was good but its no better than other ones I have had. Maybe older versions are better. I am not taking into account the new ownership, I am simply reviewing this beer as I see it. If it was a blind taste test, I don't know if it would get as high a review as I gave it.

All of my fears were completely unjustified. Here goes.  Poured an inky jet black into my snifter. A few small bubbles fizzled out very quickly. My first whiff caused me some hesitation. Where was all the alcohol I had been promised? Instead I received a very mild sensation of all the key components that I was expecting. Wonderful. First taste was excellent. Not mind blowing, but far more integrated and subdued than I had expected. Velvety feel, and surprisingly clean.

Very boozy at first, but as it warms up it becomes incredibly smooth.  Mouthfeel- Velvety smooth feel with a nice alcohol warmth. Really everything you could ask for in a stout. Little to no carbonation present and the perfect amount of malt chewiness.  Overall- Can't say enough good things about this beer. Perfect taste with a big array of flavors that develop as it warms and the velvety smooth mouthfeel becomes the cherry on top.

1549,10672,aleigator,4.63,"'14 version, many thanks to Tom!  Pours a thick, syrupy, completely black color, with a small, soon disappearing dark brown head, leaving a very thin lacing at the edge of the glass.  Has an intriguing nose of earthy, scorched malts with hints of molasses to it, along with milk chocolate, vanilla notes and a gentle barrel infusion, providing a convincing amount of wood and slightly hot Bourbon, blending outstandingly well into the sweeter notes of the beer, building up a fantastic, complexity. A generous amount of toffee and cocoa nibs complete the inviting aromas of this beer.  Tastes of earthy, wooden, toasted malts, mingled together with an unbelievable chocolate creaminess, giving this beer its incredible smooth mouthfeel. Even though this is a sipper, it drinks fairly easy, as the alcohol isn't hidden, but a fundamentaly, well integrated aspect. The Bourbon builds up on the palate above the malt and chocolate foundation, inviting sweeter flavors of molasses, toffee and nougat to the taste, which not only provide a well fitting depth, but also are responsible for wrapping up any alcoholic burn in a very pleasant way, providing a rich, complex, slightly burning Bourbon character with oaken qualities to it. These then again blend well into the malts, leading to a sweeter finish, with a subtle coffee bitterness in the end, calmed by lots of bakers chocolate, exiting with a short, sharp bourbon bite.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,ZagZagg,4.49,"12oz 2014 bottle into snifter  A: Viscous black, molasses-like pour envelops the floor of the snifter. Quarter finger copper head manifests itself along the globe, but has weak retention. Lacing isn’t bad – with a lingering alcohol curtain. This brew has a rich motor oil hue, lustrous.  S: Formidable bourbon aroma in the vanguard followed by bittersweet notes of caramel and oak. Dark bitter chocolate warps warm hints of roasted and chocolate malts. Light coco nibs mix with fig and suppressed toffee.  T: Sweet, sweet, sweet, up front, dark fruits, rich dark chocolate. Bourbon flavors are dynamic, contributing a rye confection without being as boozy as the nose let on. Fig and plum impart a strong sugary character that evokes tastes of caramel and brown sugars. Oak resins pervade with a certain smokiness that collides with a piquant vanilla bean. The finish has a warming syrupy sweetness laced with anise and tart dry bourbon.  M: Motor oil, rich, and syrup. Heavy hitting and warm – carbonation is almost non-existent. Aftertaste is long-lived, rather sweet and rich.  O: Fantastic stout, one of the best, not as carbonated as I remember though. Tremendous mouthfeel inundated with sweet dark fruits and benevolent bourbon. Well-balanced and quite consumable for 13.8%.

1549,10672,VashonGuy,4.68,"Update from 12/25/2015.  I first had BCBS two or three years ago, on tap, and as I remember it was listed as 16% ABV. I'd never had a beer that blew me away like that, and last year when I first rated BCBS, I gave it a 4.9 (at the time when you only gave one overall rating), partly I think on memories of that very first time.  Now, in late 2015, I've had a lot of Imperial Stouts, a lot of BBA beers, and a lot of high ABV beers. So I'm updating my rating, with a bit more perspective.  Look: dark as night, a small head, a little lacing.  Smell: terrific aroma, roasty and bourbon, lots of punch.  Taste: the bourbon is super prominent here, but the roasty stout flavors are really good also. Moderately sweet. Nicely balanced.  Feel: super smooth.  Overall: I'm in the anti-AB/InBev camp, and I avoid their beers about 98% of the time. But there's a place in my heart for BCBS. It's so intensely flavorful, so smooth, and such good bourbon. It may not be a 4.9, as I previously thought, but it's definitely in the top tier of beers I've had.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,SerialTicker,4.53,"Bottled September 26th and poured December 15th. Managed to get a hidden bottle from my bottle shop. Thanks a lot, Dan. Great surprise. Bottle was $8, I think. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Been wanting this for a long while, so let's see how it turns out.  Appearance: Hard pour down the middle of the glass gave maybe quarter a finger head that went away quickly. Super quiet in the glass with only a really slight, faint ring around the glass. It looks as I expected it to at 15%. Pitch black with a tiny bit of ruby at the edges of the glass.  Smell: Pretty much as big as I expected it to be. Honestly, I'm a bit surprised at the amount of coconut I'm getting out of this beer. I'm sure a lot of that smell is coming from the alcohol getting busy with the other aromas. There's a load of bourbon in this beer with oak and vanilla, with the usual suspects of rich coffee and chocolate. Pretty phenomenal. Warmed up, it manages to improve. The alcohol is more noticeable, but everything just comes out even more. Intoxicating. Speaking of intoxicating...  Taste/feel: A quick kiss of carbonation on the tongue and then comes the religious experience. Massive bourbon barrel... I swear it's the most prominent flavor here. Then comes the alcohol pretty much burning the tongue and drying right up, before the big chocolate and coffee flavors come in. Vanilla flavor from the barrels work a bit to mellow out the intense booziness, but nothing can slow down that 15%. Big, brandy-like sweetness on the beer. The coconut I get in the nose comes out slightly in the flavor, but it's far less prominent. The mouthfeel of this is very good (as is the rest of the beer), with a very low bit of prickly carbonation, and then a full, meal-like body. As it warms, I finally get the dark fruit flavors, which of course only adds some depth to it. The alcohol doesn't seem any more hot than when it was colder though.  BCBS is and incredible beer... I wasn't expecting anything less. This would be my favorite BBA'd stout if I hadn't just had Bourbon Ben's Asthma by Short's, which was a *little* less hot and had a bit more of a vanilla flavor that I really like in big stouts. I'd drink BCBS any time I could find it, but I wouldn't drive around town looking for bottles of it. Then again, I'm not sure I'd do that for any beer. Still, there's not doubt about it -- this is a World Class beer. I'd love to have gotten a couple bottles so I could age one for two or three years, but even ""fresh"", this is an excellent beer ... assuming you can take the ""heat.""",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,threeviews,4.92,"Since I still had one left from last year and have yet to do a formal review, I figured it was time...2013 vintage (bottled on date: 30Aug2013) poured at just under cellar temperature into a Rastal Teku 2.0 glass.  A- Pours a viscous, used motor-oil black. The head generated (if you want to even call it that) was nothing more than a coffee colored film which disappeared before I even picked up the glass to take a nose...considering the ABV and time in the barrel, I can understand the lack of head. However, I would like to have seem something. (4.0)  S- It smells like its appearance...thick and dense. Chocolate, Molasses, Vanilla, Bourbon, Coffee and Char (Leather/Tobacco) all present themselves, each taking turns as the dominant aroma during consumption. (5.0)  T- The barrel keeps this massive stout in check very artfully. Following the initial onslaught of Vanilla and molasses, milk chocolate and bourbon sweetness comes in mid palate. The finish is a combination of alcohol heat in the chest and a coffee-like bitterness in the mouth. Surprisingly, the bitterness of the base beer prevents it from ever getting too cloying. (5.0)  M- Not surprisingly, the beer full bodied and might be the most viscous beer I have sampled. This a palate-coating beer that immediately demands attention, time and contemplation. Not surprisingly, this beer has a low drinkability. (4.75)  O- A year (actually 16 months) of age has mellowed the beer quite a bit. The 2014 vintage is much, much more aggressive with regards to the barrel characteristics, almost as if the barrels were more 'wet'. Although this is clearly a 5.0 beer regardless of vintage and one which has aged well, I will prefer my BCBS fresh...giving my nod to the 2014 vintage for its more 'extreme' aroma/flavor profile.

Adjunct-like sweetness is also very present with molasses and slight vanilla.  Mouthfeel: heavy, chewy. sticky, burning alcohol and warmth. bitterness comes from scorched malts and alcohol.

Well, now it's the end of 2014 and I recently had BCBS on tap, and I'm here to say with the rest of the BA's that this beer is outstanding! The depth and subtleties of the bourbon flavor make it a complete stand out. I only wish I had saved the 2012 coffee bomber I had because now I could have enjoyed it properly!

Taste is equally powerful and complex. Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and licorice. Lots of booze and bourbon notes as well - vanilla and oak. Finish is bitter licorice.

Small brown head that diminishes pretty quickly. The appearance is nothing special to me, other than the fact that it has some legs on it from the barrel aging as you swirl it around.  The aroma is insanely good. Rich chocolate, coffee, burnt malts, marshmallow, port, fig, alcohol, charcoal. Outstanding.  The alcohol presence is more prominent in the flavor. Full bodied to the max. Thick and chewy, long lasting flavor. Heavy sweetness due to the bourbon.  Full disclaimer: I don't drink a lot of barrel aged beers. It took me two hours to drink this beer. Two fucking hours! But every minute, every sip was delicious. Not for the weak hearted, this is serious stuff. It reminded me in many ways of Dogfish Head World Wide Stout, but better.

Here goes:  A: The only ""just good"" thing about the beer. Pours pitch black but leaves a very tiny head that readily dissipates. Also no lacing (probably high specific gravity/high density issues).  S: Here's where it gets good. Smell a ton of oak, vanilla and molasses initially - these give way to faint smatterings of chocolate, caramel and light, sweet coffee notes. The coffee notes are rather sublime, however - they're not bitter owing to the balance between them and the vanilla and chocolate. Yummy.  T: Wow. I mean, WOW! Initial taste of oak and vanilla. This gives way to a strong, thick, palate-coating molasses. At the back-end of the palate, one detects notes of chocolate and coffee. Overall, this is an amazing beer. The bourbony (i.e., oak, vanilla and molasses) notes are strongly complemented by a good base beer. Lovely. Exquisite. Excellent.  F: Nice and thick. Very little carbonation, but the beer simple glides down the tongue. Perfect score.

L (4.75) – This pours DARK. Really dark. Almost like Pepsi. Not a lot of lacing or such, but so far so good.  S (4.75) – Smells enticing. Not a lot of bourbon smell, but a little bourbon and roast smells..  T (5) – Well the bar had been set high for this and it cleared it. At the front you immediately get the bourbon. Followed soon by coffee tastes, and finishes with this deep rich chocolatey taste. But not overly bitter, and not an overly alcoholic taste. Balanced perfectly.  F (5) – This beer is a little thicker than average but it works. But it’s smooth at the same time. Low carb, but it should be and feels right.  O (5) – Normally for me these beers that are so hyped fall short. I tried to temper my excitement, but I was really anxious to try it. And it delivered. I’m a little sad that I only have 3 left.

Vanilla and the suggestion of breakfast syrup. Slightly bitter chocolate. A bit of earthy flavors, high bitterness, and an alcohol bite on the finish.  M – Carbonation comes through as quite high, with a carbonic bite. Highly bitter, yet a lot of sweetness from the residual sugars. The alcohol is high and lends a burn on the finish, but not as high and more balanced than in prior years when fresh.  O – This was/is my favorite beer going into the tasting, and the evaluation process has done nothing to change my view.

1549,10672,DMXLOX22,4.75,"Picked up a 12 oz. single of this brew at my local establishment, Civera's Deli in Drexel Hill. Very excited to get a hold of this one before it sold out.  Appearance: Pours a dark brown, almost complete black body, no visible carbonation at all. Leaves a copper tan head on top that dissipates to only a lingering foam in about 4 minutes. Lacing is pretty decent, could be better, but that may just be my glass.  Smell: Aromas are somewhat complex. First couple of checks of this beer reveals a boozy and strong odors of burnt wood. I go in again about halfway down, and caramel malts are definitely noticeable. Also a very slight hint of maybe vanilla and coconut. Toffee is also on the way down and gets strong as the brew reaches room temperature.  Taste: Again, first few sips off the top reveal a somewhat overwhelming taste of booze, sweet, burnt wood-like flavors. another few sips, the burnt flavor gets milder and toffee-like flavors take hold and a semi-sweet chocolate and coconut also take shape as the brew reaches the bottom. Once at room temperature, I notice the bourbon that the entire label brags about. Delicious flavors complementing each other.  Mouthfeel: Below average carbonation. Thick body, rich flavor and dry finish. Semi-alcohol burn on the way down. Not bad. Goes well with this pumpkin pie I'm enjoying with it.  Overall: Excited to grab this brew while supplies still lasted. Delicious and strong. Good to enjoy with food that's light, but flavorful to really compliment this brew.

I'm currently burping what feels like a glass of bourbon neat. Mouthfeel is unbelievable. Like velvet chocolate and rich toffee. Silky smoothness rounds off the strong first taste. Definitely changes as it warms/my taste buds become accustomed. More pronounced chocolate and roasted malts coming through without the boozy bourbon. This is such a complex beer and so perfectly brewed to be ready and enjoyable at just a month or so old while also standing up to time with the best.

F: Full bodied with a velvety softness that is quite delightful on this cold winter day.  O: Damn, I was going to be hard on this one but I see what the hype is all about now. This beer is everything you want out of a high percentage stout. Huge viscous aromatics that almost seem to stick to your nostrils coupled with the deep char, bourbon, and vanilla overtones on the palate. The mid-palate is mindboggling, concentrated flavors and full bodied texture.

1549,10672,joberlander,4.99,"2016 13.8% bottled 9/20/16. This is still the benchmark. The only reason the look got a 4.75 is the beautiful mocha head existed for like 5 seconds, but that's usually the case with this beer. This beer is pretty much perfect and one of the best years ive had in a while. Very smooth and a lot less boozy compared to last years. The nose has tons of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and leather. The taste follows. So much delicious bourbon and chocolate and the mouthfeel is super creamy and it coats your mouth. It's almost sticky as it lingers. With all the people bitching these days about the price, I will happily pay the 12 a bottle for a perfectly done beer. When prairie is being sold at 12 dollars a bottle for 12 oz I think this is a bargain.

A - Jet black color devoid of all light reflecting out of this elixir. It pours beautifully with a dark khaki head and nice lacing. A very beautiful beer in the glass.  S - Tons of of sweet stout smell with roasted, chocolate, caramel, bourbon, and vanilla. Smells very strong and bursting with flavor.  T - A rush of flavor hits your palate but it is clear this is exactly what you would expect with the bourbon and imperial stout character holding your tongue hostage. The roasted, chocolate, and malt flavors blend perfectly with the oak, bourbon, and vanilla that comes with the barrel aging process. This beer tastes like one of the best beers in the world but is more bourbon forward, less complex, and higher in alcohol than some other top-tier bourbon barrel aged stouts.  M - Huge mouth-feel with light carbonation. This is probably the thickest and most heavenly bodied beers I've ever had.  Overall, this is a tremendous and amazing beer that deserves respect and a discerning palate to appreciate such grandeur. Though the bourbon is front and center it is smooth and flavorful and really adds a great deal to the amazing base imperial stout. Only a few weeks ago did I have the ""other"" amazing bourbon barrel stout, ""KBS"" and I would choose the Founder's counter part over Bourbon County only due to the ability to better discern all of the flavors instead of this beer where the flavors are so strong and fulfilling that the palate can be overwhelmed.

Whiskey and maltiness followed by a minor burn of alcohol. I enjoyed it more and more with each sip. The mouthfeel is extremely heavy. Coats the mouth and tounge. Beautiful stout.

Swirling yields legs that cling to the glass and take forever to come down. It's very still and appears to be quite thick and viscous. The aroma is bourbon first and foremost. I definitely get some sweet molasses or brown sugar. Something is giving off a very sweet aroma in a pleasant way. There is also some cocoa and roasty malt to round it out. First sip is impressive. The bourbon comes through in a big way that is not abrasive. Roasted malt brings some bitterness but it sweetened by molasses and cocoa. Very heavy on the tongue and full bodied.

It had a healthy amount of (coffee?) bitterness to counter the boozey and woody character. (18/20) M: Surprisingly well-carbonated.

1549,10672,cjgiant,4.65,"Old ratings: 4.75, 4.25, 4.75, 4.25, 5 (original tasting was Jan 9th, 2014):  Was happy to see this offered at a local store. Had some high expectations given its spot on the top 250 beer list, but was also cautious because of the high-alcohol content. I was hoping it didn't power the ratings and wouldn't overpower the beer.  The pour was on point, with a little less head than some stouts, but given the ABV, not unexpected. The nose has obvious bourbon, but the dark roasted malt smell is also there. There's also notes of brown sugar and oak.  The taste starts with a twinge of alcohol heat, but the backbone is roasted malt with some semi-sweet chocolate and honey mixed in (in my re-review, I actually get a decent taste of coconut!?). The taste is pretty smooth throughout, well balanced. There's a little tartness that appears in the background, reminding me oddly of a tart apple.  I did thoroughly enjoy the beer. The bourbon/alcohol tastes were present, but not overpowering (I noticed these less in the re-review). The roasted malt nature of a stout is not lost, and the balance of these things is well done.  Re-review: I know it's only been a month, but on my second try of this beer, I enjoyed it even more. It's sweetness (chocolate/honey mentioned above) appealed to me, and the overall beer seemed smoother.

The smell is familiar, but I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe some raisin smell too. Very complex aroma. French toast maybe? Sweat, yummy taste. Wow is this good. Picking up on caramel, raisin, definitely bourbon. At 15%, I thought I’d taste more alcohol but I don’t. Even with taste I’m getting this familiar toastyness, but can’t figure it out.

Hard to hide the ABV but it has mellowed considerably after some time in the cellar. Minor (relatively speaking) notes of vanilla and maple provide backing to the ample nose.  T: Dried dark fruits, more caramel, and oaky vanilla. Dark cherry and some sherry like flavors as well. Bitter and tannic dark chocolate in the finish.  M: THICK and incredibly viscous.

1549,10672,IvoryFoxhole,4.44,"Traded 4 pack of Heady Topper for a 2013 bottle that sadly has been standard cold-refrigerated. Since I have 2 aging (set to drink in 2018/9) already, I figured I might as well give this a shot now and see what the story is.  12 oz. bottle poured into Utopias glass. Date on bottle is 10/2013.  A) Dark, dark brownish-black. No head to speak of. Very tiny tan foam rim.  S) Sweet, sweet malt, bourbon, and alcohol. Can't mask it at this ABV.  T) Coffee, bourbon, vanilla, a bit of dark dried fruit. Some alcohol.  M) Very full-bodied and syrupy. Not much carbonation at all, not sure if it's this bottle or could use more in general. Pretty good balance. Sweet finish, not what you would expect from moderate hopping and big ABV. Quite good.  O) It's great, but didn't blow me away as advertised. Hopefully aging will add more.  12/1/14 Update: Tried 2014 version via growler obtained 11/29/14. Appears to have a little bit more carbonation and life to it. I'd bump it to 4.45 based on this try. Can't wait for all my aging bottles to be ready in a few years.  1/19/18 LOL forgot to update some of those older bottles. 2015 was OK. Since I got multiple 2018s, I tried one new and it definitely holds up to the older ones, at least.

A - pours a thick, syrupy oil slick in the glass with a half finger head that dissipates into a bare foam collar and only little spots of foam sticking to the sides. This is a heavy brew right from the start.  S - sweet maple, oak, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, and roasted malt all converge into a crazy amalgam of aroma.  T - Surprisingly not as boozy as I had expected. the sweet, roasty malt and bourbon flavors drown out much of the alcohol burn, paving the way for the sweet, heady, roasty flavors to shine through. This is a monster of a stout.  M - Heavy, heavy, HEAVY. The first sips were almost milkshake-like in their thickness on the palate, and every taste thereafter is a wave of dense, almost syrupy stout goodness, with just enough carbonation to keep it from collapsing in on itself.

The chocolate and modest bitterness really take the lead in the taste with the bourbon warming my entire inside. This beer gets a lot of 5 out of 5's and the only reason I didn't rate it that way is because the boozy nose is just a hit too much for me.But one cannot argue that this is one the best beers on the market that is reasonably accessible to many craft beer lovers like myself.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,dar482,4.9,"(2015 vintage) The beer comes in a familiar pitch black color with a dark brown head.  The aroma bursts of dried dark fruit, plums, figs, cherry. Bourbon, dark chocolate, charred oak, coffee roast, vanilla, sweet caramel.  The flavor follows with bourbon throughout with an upfront dark fruit flavor, sweet figs and dates, candied cherries. Sweet caramel and brown sugar, along with dark chocolate, sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, charred oak and coconut on the finish.  The mouthfeel is luscious and silk, without being overly chewy and the beer glides off the palate quite gently.  (2013) The beer pours out pitch black and even leaves a film of dark brown when the glass is swirled. A bubbly brown head slowly turns into a subtle mocha dark brown head.  The aroma is a huge robust roasted, a big sweet vanilla, bourbon with a huge theme of chocolate and roasted coffee. There are layers of oak, toasted coconut, rich dark caramel. The aroma is the definition of what a bourbon barrel aged stout should aspire towards.  In the front, the beer punches through of bourbon and sweetness along with rich sticky caramel and dark chocolate and almost a rich chocolate syrup. There’s a touch of dark fruit in the middle as the beer moves onto a huge brown sugar and vanilla sweetness. On the back, there’s a burnt wood flavor and roasted coffee along with toasted coconut. The beer dries out slightly along with medium lingering alcohol and lots of oak tannins and tobacco.  The mouthfeel is luscious and full.  This is easily one of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts out there, despite all the other brews that have hype and rarity.  Having this blind 2012 and 2013, I preferred the 2012.

1549,10672,blackcompg,5,"I've actually had this as my avatar for awhile, but have never reviewed it - grabbing a bottle from 2012 for this review...  Appearance - A strong pour into a large snifter gives a brief dark cinnamon cap which quickly dissipates. A brief swirl reveals ""legs"". Color of the body is a deep and completely opaque black - light doesn't even pass through the sides of the glass. There is no lacing, but at 15% ABV, this is to be expected, so no faulting for this, it is expected, and appropriate for such a big beer as this.  Smell - Even after 2 years, the nose begins with bourbon and oak at the forefront. I'm also getting some molasses, dark toffee, bakers chocolate, a touch of vanilla extract, and a trace of roasted malt and rich soy sauce.  Taste - Oh my goodness... when I had this fresh the bourbon was forward and somewhat ""in your face"" - but after two years the rich ""stout"" flavors are much more prominent. Let me try and break down the transition - the first flavors are extremely rich roasted malt, some dark fruits like black cherry and ripe plum, and a bit of raisin. Dark chocolate quickly coats the fruit, along with moist oak and vanilla. Then as the sip nears the back of your throat the bourbon starts in the back and reaches forward, complimenting and enhancing all of these flavors. After the swallow you are left with bourbon warmth, vanilla bean and oak remain on the tongue, with traces of rich chocolate covered fruits and roasted malts in the mouth corners. Heavenly.  Mouthfeel - Full, heavy and rich - mouthcoating. Carb is extremely light, and lends a silky smooth light foam, as if a bourbon infused chocolate mousse were melting across your tongue. A perfect and contemplative sipper, as different flavors will play highs or gently recede as this beer warms. Let it - take your time with this - you will be rewarded.  Overall - If you enjoy bourbon and stouts, then this is an absolute must. In my opinion, this is the bar by which this style should be rated. If you come across this beer, go ahead and try one fresh - but do yourself a favor - cellar the rest of them, at least a few 4-paks. As with most imperial stouts, age is a wonderful thing, and will allow all of the flavors to mellow and mature. The only possible ""knock"" I could possibly give is for appearance, but you're not going to get a big frothy head and great retention on a 15% ABV beer. With that said, I will not penalize it for something it can't be, and I'm giving it all 5's. I may be a bit biased as I enjoy a good bourbon, and I love impy stouts... and this is nirvana.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Let it be known that aging changes this beer a lot, although I would argue that it's not necessarily better, just different.  Smells like sweet vanilla chocolate with a viscous roasty sort of soy sauce aroma, lots of intense, sweet caramelized barley. The taste follows with huge roasted barley notes enveloped in vanilla/caramel/dark chocolate glaze. Kind of like salty alcoholic brownie batter. Actually, salty alcoholic brownie batter kind of sums up fresh bcbs pretty well. Thick, viscous, slick and creamy mouthfeel. Syrupy sweet goodness.  What can I say? It's just a friggin delicious beer, enjoyable every time. Age smooths out the alcohol, makes the mouthfeel more slick by getting rid of some carbonation, and brings it much closer to actual brownie batter in a glass. Worth drinking now, and worth cellaring (two to three years seems to be the sweet spot). Is it worth the hype? Why not?

The stout smells sweet and syrupy, with hints of coconut, booze and alcohol, and malt.  The first taste is of sparkly, boozy, cocoa, and malt. It is sweet and pleasing. There is also a taste of toffee and light caramel.  The mouthfeel is thick and robust, with a luscious and savory mouthfeel.

1549,10672,boudeysbigbrew,4.81,"Came from a bottle, poured into a New Belgium snifter. Had it along with some Pad Thai i was sharing with my wonderful girlfriend!  Appearance - Black, virtually no head after a gentle pour. Has a motor oil look going for it.  Smell - Real, real boozy. Hints of maple.  Taste - Incredibly thick on the bourbon. A nice dark chocolate aftertaste, and not quite as much coffee as I would expect from a heavy RIS. Twinges of vanilla, molasses, oak and maple. Not as complex as the KBS (my standard for RIS's), but still delicious. The bourbon presence only begins to increase as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel - Maybe the thickest beer I have ever tried. Quite saliva inducing, where the taste of bourbon and chocolate stays in my mouth long after my last sip.  Overall - Man this is one heavy beer. At 14.9 percent this beer is to be taken seriously, but it remains perfectly drinkable throughout the entire session. I wish I had one extra to make a more accurate assessment, but it comes down to the fact this is one hell of a classic.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MagicJeff,4.56,Doesn't get much better than this stout-wise. I picked up a lot of chocolate and coffee notes--and bourbon and vanilla tie it all together.

1549,10672,blankenhoney,4.6,"2013 bottle enjoyed from a wine glass  A: the body is nearly pitch black, and the head is a saucy mess of khaki brown that recedes immediately. a sticky brown film coats the glass.  S: dominant aromas are of chocolate fudge, oak, and vanilla. Also picked up some syrupy dark fruit aromas  T: bourbon-soaked chocolate fudge; dark cherries, dates, and figs; the barrel flavor is quite strong and holds evrything together. It's worth noting that this BCS has mellowed out quite a bit in the last few months.  M: perfection: incredibly thick, chewy, viscous, and syrupy. Intense, in a word, and I think that the ideal serving size (for one person) would be 8 or 9 ounces. But it's no problem sipping this one over an hour or two.

1549,10672,EvoRich,5,"Look: Poured into a snifter, it looks like most Imperial stouts. Very dark in color. A reddish black, with a tan caramel, but VERY fast diminishing head. Head is gone quickly. Leaves a syrupy/oily like film on the glass as it empties.  Smell: A bit of vanilla, maybe some cherry. Alcohol smell is present. Definitely some smell of bourbon, but I'm not sure why...  Taste: Is this beer? Bourbon is clear in the flavor. Also some dark chocolate. The finish is a bit woody. Most certainly a barrel aged beer. The flavor is very strong. A sipper for sure.  Feel: Feel bodied. Almost like syrup. Very smooth, light on carbonation.  Overall: I had my first BCBS about 7 months ago. I knew nothing about it. Nothing about the hype. I was new to the craft beer world. I've heard of Goose Island, but when I was out an saw it on the menu with 15% ABV next to it's name, I thought, wow, I should try that. I was amazed. I then looked into it and quickly realized it's one of the most sought after beers. I thankfully eventually stumbled across some moths later at $15 per bottle. I reluctantly bought 4, knowing I was being ripped off, but didn't care.

1549,10672,Furlinator,4.74,"One's 300th Beer Advocate review shoud be reserved for a special beer, right?  Bottled on 08/20/13.  Pours opaque black. The thin tan head quickly disappears completely and leaves very faint spots of lace.  The smell is an absolutely amazing combination of dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, vanilla, coconut, oak, black cherry and a hint of bourbon. Unbelievable.  The taste is of dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, molasses, dark stone fruit and a trace of bourbon. While the bourbon presence is detectable, it in no way overwhelms any of the other flavors, nor does it represent the massive weight and ABV of this brew.  The texture is heavy, thick, oily and viscous. It coats the entire palate and allows you to enjoy each sip for just a moment longer.  I've been sitting on this 4-pack for quite a while now, waiting for a worthy occasion to indulge. Now, it will be even harder to exercise self control and not devour the last three. This beer definitively lives up to all the hype and accolades. Simply stated, it is near perfection.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

As the name suggest, bourbon overwhelms the sip, but it does give way to a very strong base stout. The roasted malts come through as you swallow the very dark elixir, and leave a pleasing mild bourbon/toffee flavor on your breath.  **Also sampled a bottle of 2007 in Wrigleyville. My lovely wife purchased it for my birthday. Poured into two small snifter glasses. Virtually no head, so looked like a glass full of oil. Bourbon was still quite pronounced, but the overall flavor had mellowed with time.

1549,10672,Ciocanelu,4.6,"2018 vintage, 15.2 ABV. Aroma has deep malt notes, whiskey, wood barrel and a bit of smoke. Taste is malty, a bit sweet at first but overall really well balanced. Finish has dark chocolate and roasted malt bitterness. Medium plus body with medium minus carbonation. Pretty nice overall, the whiskey barrel shines through very well and the alcohol doesn't bother at all but it also lacks some of the complexity of the previous vintages. 4.5/5  2017 vs. 2015 side by side. 2017 has chocolate, toffee and subtle bourbon on the aroma. Sweet milk chocolate, caramel and bourbon integrated very well on the taste. Really smooth and elegant. Rating: 4.6/5 2015 leans more towards dried fruits with a touch of smoked notes. Taste has some slightly smoked prunes and figs, dark chocolate and roasted malt on the finish. Some whiskey and booze as well. It has a similar taste profile as a dark barleywine. Rating: 4.5/5  Review of the 2014 vintage. You can tell from the pour that this is a very viscous beer. Just a small dark colored head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is big on bourbon without having any offensive alcohol burn. Taste is awesome: chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla and the specific coconut from the bourbon barrels. Long caramely aftertaste. Dense and silky body with very well hidden alcohol. I enjoyed it more than the 2013 vintage. This might be a ""Top 10"" beer for me.

Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy but not objectionable....  Overall: Smell was overpowering, scaring my taste buds but the balance was outstanding and left me wanting and other!

1549,10672,Mongrel,4.36,"A - Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with ruby hues around the edges. Dark mocha head doesn't last long and recedes to reveal a slick, viscous surface.  S - Smells like sweet, boozy bourbon and vanilla. Bourbon is really prevalent, like a Jack and coke. Not much of the roasty notes that you would expect from a big stout, but there is a hint of black licorice.  T - Taste very much mimics the nose -- sweet with tons of bourbon flavor like vanilla, green apple and cherrywood smoke. There's blackstrap molasses, cherry, caramel, chocolate, dark fruit/prunes, and a touch of licorice. Massive flavor with each sip, but delivered smoothly. This is definitely one of the sweeter stouts out there, but not as sweet as the Bourbon County barleywine. My only critiques are that it could use a little more traditional roasty flavor and the aftertaste is a bit too boozy.  M - Feel is full, slick, and a little syrupy, initially packing a punch with just how big the package is. Coats the palate thoroughly with syrupy sweetness, but actually dries out nicely on the finish thanks to plentiful booze.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Follows with some roasted dark malt and slight bitter finish. Very nicely balanced.

1549,10672,TheBeerDrinker,4.84,"This is a 2008 vintage so hopefully it's as good as the last 2008 I drank last year  Pours out dark as night with a pretty small dark brown head and no lacing. Looks really nice but a bigger head would be nice.  Smell is dark malts, molasses, mainly chocolate, and no hint of booze at all.  Taste is amazing. The best of the bourbon county regular vintages that I have had. Just like the nose with a little more booze which I love as I am a bourbon drinker.  Mouthfeel is really thick like most older bourbon county. Just a treat.  Overall this is my favorite vintage of BCBS, Sure it could have had a little bigger head but given how old it is I am giving it a break as everything else in the stout has aged so well I can't possibly discount anything here. FWIW the only 2008s I have got straight from a store that cellared them so these were cellared very well. I RARELY give any attribute of a beer a 5 so that tells you how much I love this stout but as most can attest it is hard to beat a 2008 BCBS.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It doesn't necessarily have coffee, but it looks like coffee. Aroma reveals the bourbon barrels, a sweet scent lingers, some molasses. Taste reveals a nice syrupy beer, sweet but not overly sweet, and a certain boozy bourbon flavor that is not offensive but pleasing. Carbonation is normal.  This beer turns sweet and heavy as you drink. Very good stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Caramel, dark fruits (cherries), vanilla, bourbon.

Palate is left with a thick coating of malt/chocolate.  M - Thick body, low carbonation. As mentioned lingers on the palate.  O - Not my first BCBS, but it is the first I decided to review. Certainly deserving of its' status. After having this a few times I am now able to see past the booze punch and recognize how complex a beer this is.

1549,10672,rand,4.4,"From 12 oz bottle to snifter  First off, this is one of two BA brews of this caliber (KBS being the other) available in a 12 oz bottle. I guess that becomes an option with a little financial backing. Secondly, this latest batch of BCS should quell any fears that big business necessarily means bad brew. Whether it's from some prodigy's garage, or InBev's latest club-like gastropub, a good beer is a good beer, which is all that should matter.  Appearance: Um, is this a beer, or used car oil? No way for a head to form, the sludgy complexion keeps nary a bubble from escaping.  The nose: Chocolate and burnt sugar. Vanilla, a touch of a cherry note, and I'm picking up a hint of soy sauce at the edge of bouquet. Ample alcohol volatiles stream the nose with aroma.  The palate: Unsweetened chocolate, roasted coffee notes and wood all at once, seemingly penetrating the palate. Molasses, a touch of grassy astringency, tobacco, all blending in harmony. If there is any criticism, it's in a carob-like note toward the finish, which becomes a little too prominent as it warms. Alcohol isn't masked, but I would've guessed 10-ish%.

1549,10672,hreb,4.27,"This 12oz bottle was bottled on 09Oct13 and is labeled as 14.9% ABV. Served in a Chimay chalice (not exactly a snifter). As soon as the bottle is cracked it emits an intense aroma of oak and vanilla -- pure bourbon. Pours black like an oil slick with no head whatsoever. Flavor is all bourbon, but without the alcohol. Which is a crazy thing to say about a 30 proof beverage, I know. Yes, it's sweet. It's a bit like drinking molasses. It's delicious though. It's just oak and vanilla and caramel all the way down. There's lot a lot of grainy complexity here, just a huge 1-dimensional stout packed into some amazing barrels. Hops? It takes 60 IBUs just to hold this thing upright. But there's no hop flavor to describe or discernible aroma. No roastiness, no chocolate, no coffee, no nuttiness. Not even really fruit to speak of. This is a wonderful treat and all, but it's as much gimmick as it is craft beer. I give it high marks all around, but I can't give it the highest ""BA 100"" marks others swear it deserves.  Now, this is fairly young bottle, and the label encourages aging (""up to 5 years""). I could totally see the barrel flavors mellowing out and revealing something a bit more delicate.

For regular - it is amazing what even one year does to add something sumptuous to the mix. When fresh, i find that the flavors are all pleasant but not altogether. I’ve had this up to five years old and it only gains complexity. I’d say year three was maybe the lowest of my tastings and five definitely shows it’s age in the body and drinks more like a port.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

There are many more layers here though - rich dark chocolate and coffee provide an excellent backdrop to the bourbon. Oak, vanilla, and a touch of caramel malt sneak into the picture to add a bit more complexity. Just the right amount of alcohol heat on the finish. Phenomenal.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and rich. Low carbonation level gives it a velvety smooth texture going down. Again, the perfect amount of alcohol heat warms the palate.  Overall: Love this beer.

1549,10672,schris,4.65,"This is for a 2013 BCBS, tasted in March 2014. I had this beer over the course of two days (8 oz pour, recap, and fridge until the second day). The first night, it started out at cellar temperature and gradually warmed up; the second, I drink it at refrigerator temperature. I don't have a great palate for bourbon, itself, and this may have been why I actually enjoyed the tasting better when the beer was colder and the bourbon flavor was a little bit masked by the cold - in the same way that I find whiskey to be more refreshing at colder temperatures, but more complex and worthy of discussion when warmed up.  This beer looks great sliding into a glass. I was test-driving a set of new 8.5 oz snifters, and the whole scene felt very photogenic. The dark brown head bubbles up from the bottom after the beer has been poured out, rises for a second, and disappears again to leave a fine web of lacing around the edges. Bourbon-soaked aroma has a deep oaky quality to it. I also smelled cherries and caramel, which guided me in choosing pairings for this tasting - salted chocolate, dried cherries, aged swiss cheese, and a couple of marshmallows for a bit of whimsy.  The body is thick - sticky, creamy, and sweet. A big swallow of bourbon hits at the beginning, giving way to coffee, dark fruit, and some chocolate, though I didn't get as much chocolate as expected from other reviews. Finish is unexpectedly smooth, cleanly cutting off on the mild chocolate notes and not leaving much in the way of booziness.  All in all, this is a top-notch, iconic barrel-aged stout. I have a couple aging now, I look forward to revisiting it next year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SD-Alefan,4.83,"Poured from a 32oz. growler into a snifter. Thrilled that a local bar had this on tap as part of a Goose Island tap takeover this week.  Even with an aggressive pour, this beer produced almost no head, just a mist of dark brown foam along the edges and a dusting on top of the beer. It's virtually black with hints of rich mahogany along the top edge when held up to the light.  The aroma is mostly bourbon first with undertones of dark chocolate, maybe dried fruit, and a hint of roasting coffee. It's not overpowering in any way. The odor seems to strengthen as the beer warms.  The taste starts with the bourbon right up front, strong and boozy, almost like taking a shot of a nicely aged spirit. However, behind it is a shot of sweet caramel, then raisin, maybe a hint of plum and then a lingering, spicy dark chocolate taste the stays on the tongue for a time. The chocolate flavors seem to get stronger as it warms. I also get a hint of rich coffee. It's sweeter than I would have guessed. There is a lingering milk chocolate taste.  The moutfeel begins with a bit of prickly carbonation and then a little sticky sweetness that coats the tongue and lingers on the palate. It's not as heavy feeling as I expected.  Overall, an outstanding beer that is multi-layered and seems to change a bit with each sip. I'm really glad I got to try it and I'm looking forward to trying it bottled to compare.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Shoulder to shoulder we stood and this was the first beer I ordered. There something to be said about drinking a beer before you've eaten, well, this devious dark shadow got me good!! It was served a bit too cold, as most incredible craft beers are, but I couldn't resist the first sip anyway. WOW. This stuff is awesome! I steadily warmed the snifter in my hands to wake up some of the cold coma induced flavors that hid bundled within, shivering from the ""typical darn right chilly"" environment from which they were stashed.

1549,10672,tkdchampxi,4.4,"This past Sunday, I had the pleasure of trying 2014 side-by-side with 2015, in identical tulip glasses. The 2014 was stored in the dark at about 60 degrees over that time, while the 2015 was bought a few days prior. Both were poured at about 50 degrees and allowed to warm in glass. My ratings above are based on an average score. Here are my thoughts:  Look: Beers looked pretty much indistinguishable, with any differences in head probably due more to my pouring than the beers itself. Both had very small heads, with good legs.  Aroma: The differences here were night and day. I would say that the 2015 was surprisingly lacking in aroma - I expected more nose on the fresher beer. The 2015 had more noticeable alcohol burn like cheaper bourbon (compared to the 2014), and smelled sickly sweet, like breakfast/pancake syrup - not maple syrup, fyi. Both smelled of caramel. The 2014 had a much fuller aroma, with pronounced hints of toffee and cinnamon. It smelled more of an expensive bourbon, with vanilla sweetness, not cheap sugar syrup.  Taste: Again, night and day. You can tell how these were the same beers, but the 2015 was standing in the shadow of its older sibling. The '15 was just too sweet for me. There were hints of vanilla, booze, malt, and toffee, but the flavor was more one dimensional. The beer was sharp and the flavors hit you suddenly. The '14 was the same beer, with the same flavor profile, but the beer had developed layers. It had softened and spread itself out, kind of like the aforementioned flavors had separated into their component parts, giving the beer a beginning, middle, and end. The '14 also picked up some subtle raisin and cinnamon qualities that the fresher beer lacked.  To be fair, I will say that the 2015 was considerably better at room temperature than it was at the about 55 degrees I tried it at, but the '14 was good regardless of temperature.  Mouthfeel: I did not notice a difference here, although I wouldn't expect much carbonation to fall off the beer after only a year of being stored at about 60 degrees, especially since both beers were not highly carbonated to begin with.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It’s one of those beers where you can just tell it’s going to be good just from the appearance.  Smell: Rich malts, chocolate, dark fruits, bourbon, and alcohol with maybe a hint of vanilla. At 14+% ABV you can’t hide the alcohol but there is a host of fragrances that come through. The anticipation builds. It is a VERY inviting brew.  Taste: BINGO!!! Game over! The Holy Grail has been found! WOW!! This did not disappoint, in fact it exceeded all I’ve heard about it. You taste alcohol but not overpowering. There is sweetness but not cloying so. A perfect balance IMHO. This beer does it for me.  Mouthfeel: Creamy coating that lasts throughout. Just adds to the pleasure.  Overall: As I said, GAME OVER!! It has been found. It’s #1 in its class so far. I haven’t given a perfect 5.0 rating to anything because I figure I haven’t found it yet and don’t know what’s around the corner, but this is as close to perfection that I have found so far.

Incredible amount of the charred whiskey barrel comes through. I nice vanilla, brown sugary, marshmallow sugar finish. Bitter and Oakey. Incredible taste without additions (e.g., cacao, vanilla bean etc.). Only not a five because variants exist and do taste better.  Feels like lightly carbonated chocolate milk.

In beer drinking, I have grown up in a house that serves all of its beer in frosted mugs. I served my first craft imperial stout that way and, though it was still pretty good, I definitely found that it tastes better with a little air and room temp heat added to it. So now, I have been trying to drink my stouts and porters at around 50 degrees.  This beer came to the table frosty cold, from the restaurants frig, and it got significantly better as it warmed up. Unfortunately, with only 12 oz, it may not have had enough time to warm properly.  Still, hard to believe this beer is 15%. Even my girlfriend said that it tastes like boozy caramel. I have had beers similar in taste to this one that are 1/2 the price and and about 1/3rd the ABV. So I'm not sure what draws drinkers to stand in line for hours to get this beer.

Slight alcohol but there are so many other flavors it is not overbearing at all. Very complex and would improve with more aging.  M - Thick creamy mouthfeel that is pleasant to drink. It is definitely heavier than most but isn't bad.  O - What more can be said of this masterpiece. Overall I cant get enough of this beer.

1549,10672,MarkAvery,4.41,"Finally got my hands on a 4 Pack of this stuff. In my opinion a little pricey, but very good. Definitely one of the best stouts Ive ever had. Not as thick as a lot of other stouts, definitely a thinner mouthfeel. Smokey, nutty, chocolaty taste. Not gonna lie, I saved one bottle thinking I wouldn't get another chance to get more of this, and I picked up another 4 pack today. I know people have a thing about Goose Island and everything but, this is a phenomenal beer!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CHSeattle1,4.91,"Incredible beer. Pretty much everything that needs to be said, has been said below. It has a wonderful note of bourbon that is not at all contrived. The smoothness of the beer actually carries the bourbon aromatically and really limits that ""bourbon bite"". Its taste certainly isnt brief but doesnt not stain the mouth with a lingering taste. It's high ABV is indicative of the subtle sweetness behind the chocolate and caramel. If you can find this beer, go for it. Its one of the best bourbon stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ElijahRivera,4.79,"12 oz. 2013 bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- “Blacker than the inside of a coffin on a moonless night.” The head was small and didn't stick around very long, but that is to be expected from a barrel aged imperial stout. The color of the head was possibly the darkest mocha brown head I've seen on any beer.  S- Right away I get a big, boozy whiff of charred bourbon barrel. Then some vanilla and roasty malts. Also, some chocolate and raisins. Very impressive.  T- The flavor mirrors the bouquet with some additional coffee notes. Bold, rich, complex and masterfully balanced without any flavor distracting or detracting.  M- Syrupy, full body with a great alcohol warmth and a port-like kick in the back of one's throat, while still managing to be chocolatey smooth on the way down.  O- Not let down at all by this extremely hyped beer. The brilliant thing about it is that there is such depth to be analyzed, yet you can just sit back and enjoy if you don't want to think too hard.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,timmy2b,3.52,"On draft at the bar, very fresh keg.  Ill be that guy and say that I am not a fan. The bourbon was overpowering in both the smell and the taste. The vanilla that was supposed to be in the smell was not present due to the overpowering scent of bourbon.  This left a huge bourbon taste on my tongue and did not allow me to taste any other flavors.  Color was perfect for a heavy stout, dark but not cloudy. Head remained for a little while, but ended as a small amount around the edges of the goblet the beer was served in.  I can see how this would be a good beer to barrel aged beer fans, but it is not for me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I am very familiar with Goose Islands other offerings, but not being a big dark fan I had not heard of this brew until now... WOW!!! Not going to go through all the details but this is a beast of a beer. The aroma from the pour is over the top, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla and sweetness. You could shine a flashlight on the side of the glass and no light would come through... no really... I'm not sure if it is a black hole in a glass or what... Super thick rich syrupy sweet molasses flavor, with a serious boozy finish. Someone else commented it is like ""pouring motor oil"", it is thick, not that synthetic stuff. Zero head, nothing, nada... Just absolutely one of the most interesting beers I have had in a long time! Could not image having more than one in a sitting, it is a full meal in a glass.

It leaves a film on the side of the glass. No head what so ever. No lacing, but still leaves a film once in the glass.  Taste: Jesus Christ, this is strong! When it hits your mouth you taste coffee, brown sugar, hints of chocolate and right when your brain starts to enjoy....BAM, Whiskey and phenols. Very smooth going down, but if you hate whiskey like myself, it's a rough swallow. The whiskey taste lingers for a long time after the drink.  Opinion: I made it about half way through, but this will be my first review I bow out of. I'm not a huge fan whiskey in the first place. If you like whiskey, You will love this stuff.

T: The BBA is very prevalent in the taste. A spicy bourbon and oak bite upfront followed by dark fruit, cocoa, and a bitter finish.  M: Medium-full mouthfeel that coats the mouth.

The aroma is an intense raisin-prune and light licorice malt composite with a touch of the bourbon you expect. Luscious. The flavor jumps all over these same ideas with deep dark fruits and licorice malt and the tasteful blanket of bourbon throughout. This masterpiece is full bodied with fair carbonation for the style and presents a thick, stick to your ribs feel going down. Pretty impressive although I always prefer these beers minus the bourbon/whiskey flavors myself. Not my favorite mix but I expect I'm in the minority.

It dissipates evenly, leaving a light film behind and no lace. Smell is rich and full with notes of dark fruits (figs, raisins), roasted malt, rum, oak. Phenomenal balance. Taste is exactly the same, notes of roasted malt, dark fruit, rum and oak. Might be a touch of coffee, too. Full bodied, rich, smooth, lightly effervescent. Somewhat cloying and sticky.

1549,10672,jbwimer,4.15,"Bottle in a trade from someone... Received a few bottles in a few different trades, so cheers to whoever sent me this one. Bottled 10/15/13.  A- Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Voodoo teku. Really aggressive pour yields a little over a finger of mocha head. Sticks around longer than I thought it might. Once it's gone, carbonation rises to feed a thin ring around the edge. Black as all hell. Lovely legs from the alcohol, though not as nice as my girlfriend's.  S- Wow, that's a ton of bourbon. Like, a ton. Only other aromas I'm picking up are chocolate and some alcohol heat, though, it's not unpleasant. Seems to meld together well. It's a pleasant aroma, however, it's pretty one-dimensional. I expected more.  T- Very sweet, almost cloying. The sweetness takes away from the flavor. Besides that, lots of bourbon, an enjoyable roastiness mid-palate, which I really like. Wasn't expecting that judging from the nose. Lots of barrel-character. Perhaps too much lots of vanillins and bourbon flavor. Tasty, but not what I had hoped for.  M- Light carbonation. Very full mouthfeel. Alcohol lingers on the palette for some time. Well done.  O- A pretty enjoyable BA stout. Not nearly as good as the BCBCS, which overshadows this beer, IMO. Still, I'll have no issue drinking the few I have left in the cellar. Would prefer to share the, though. The sweetness is the weak point of this beer, if you ask me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,StoutHunter,4.69,"I got a bottle of Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout last week, thanks to a good friend for letting go of a bottle for me to review, thanks Ben. It looks like this is beer 1000 that I've Kept track of on Beeradvocate, i still have a little ways to go till a a thousand reviews, but i thought that I would get some something special for this milestone and I've been want to try this beer ever since I got into barrel aged Stouts, so lets see how it goes. 2013 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A= The label looks nice, it's pretty simple and straight to the point, only thing that makes it eye catching is that is says Bourbon County in big white letters. It poured a nice dark black color that didn't let any light come through with a half a fingers worth of slightly darker tan head that quickly died down to a very thin ring that eventually faded away and it left some pretty nice spotty lacing, with a little bit of noticeable alcohol legs. This was a very good looking beer, it's just what I want my strong barrel aged stouts to look like.  S- Wow, I can smell this beer from a foot away. The aroma starts off with a higher amount of sweetness that has a light brown sugar and molasses like aroma with the malts being the first to show and they impart a great roasted malt and very chocolate forward aroma that has a light cocoa aspect to it and there's a somewhat lighter coffee aroma in the background. Up next comes the barrel which imparts lots of nice oak, vanilla, and bourbon aromas with a nice toasted coconut aroma that was really nice and there's also a pretty noticeable boozy aroma, no hiding that but it comes with the territory. This beer had an awesome aroma, the base shows up nicely and the barrel is really showcased.  T- The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly lower amount of high sweetness that had a light molasses like taste to and it's followed by the malts being the first to show up and they impart all those nice roasty aspects that I got in the aroma with chocolate still sticking out the most and it has a flavor that reminds me of some pretty good fudge and there's just a little bit of coffee in the background. Up next comes the barrel which impart some great oaky, bourbon, and vanilla like flavors with the vanilla sticking out nicely and there's still a nice toasted coconut aspect floating around the background. On the finish there's some noticeable alcohol that's a little boozy, but not bad for 14.2% and it's a little warming with a fairly low amount of bitterness with a little more sweetness and it had a bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate like aftertaste. This is an awesome tasting beer, the base was great and very chocolate like with tons of great barrel flavors, I have no complaints at all.  M- Fairly smooth for a 14.2% Stout, rich, a little creamy, not too sticky, full bodied with a fairly low amount of carbonation. This beer had a very good mouthfeel that is pretty much just what I want from the style and it worked well with this beer.  Overall I loved this beer and I thought that it is a very good example of the style and I think it lives up to it's reputation, everything I want in a strong barrel aged stout was there and the combination of the aromas, taste, and mouthfeel just made it feel luxurious. This beer had nice drinkability, yeah it's on the sweet side and yeah it's boozy, but to me both aspects never get too out of hand, it was fairly smooth, warming, rich, fairly filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I would be perfectly fine sipping on a bottle of it and I think one is pretty much the perfect amount for me, I think it makes a great winter time beer, especially on a cold and snowy day in mid Michigan like today. What I liked most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both awesome and very memorable, that toasted coconut aspect set it apart. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I would change, but do wish I could actually buy this locally, but my part of Michigan always gets way less then it should and I don't think I've heard of any shop within a 50 mile radius that has got any. I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I would get as much as I could and I would recommend it to anyone who likes barrel aged Stouts, it's about as good as it gets. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, I really like Barrel aged Stouts and to me this one embodies the spirit of what a great sipping beer should be. KBS and Blacknote were my favorite barrel aged Stouts, but after trying this beer it's pretty clear that this is now my #1. Awesome job guys, keep up the world class work.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Corona Day #54  Price: $10.99 at Broadway Dive in Manhattan  Quick preamble: this is my favorite vintage of one of my favorite beers. This became Bourbon County Rare in 2016. This was the year the variants got infected, but the OG version was sublime. Goose Island started pasteurizing to prevent infection, and IMHO the quality has never been the same. On to business.  Appearance: 4 - completely and utterly black. Zero head. Looks flat.  Nose: 5 - yeah, this is what I want from barrel aging. I'm not looking for subtlety, just punch me in the face with it.  Taste: 5 - ditto. This vintage just has some kind of underlying foundation to it that subsequent iterations do not.  Mouth: 4 - this has thinned out a bit over the past 4.5 years. Still extremely sticky, but not as full bodied as it once was.  Overall: 5 - man, I wish I could still buy these at the old prices. I used to buy a case every year, now I just try it on tap to see if it's worth it. Don't get me wrong, the latest vintages are still excellent, but 2015 is king.

I also get hints of vanilla and oak in there as well.  T- These guys do bourbon barrel aging the best. Up front I get notes of chocolate and bourbon. Dark fruits and vanilla round out the flavor. Each sip leaves a nice warming feeling from the booziness as it goes down my throat.  M- Thick, chewy, hard hitting. Little carbonation but just enough for the style.  BCBS is amazing stuff. I had to order a 2nd bottle. If only I appreciated this stuff the way I do now a few years back when it was easy to find. Each Vintage is harder and harder to locate in my area.

1549,10672,rdilauro,5,"Thanks to a co-worker I was able to taste this beer. I was totally amazed about this one. I have heard so much about it. Last year, we sold all of our allocations to our customers, so I never had the chance to taste even one  Not this year! It poured like any good stout should, dark, dark and darker with a off color creamy head.  The difference with this one came with the aroma. So many stouts, I was always getting those perfect aromas of coffee and chocolate and the follow on taste would back up what my noise felt.  With this one, I could not detect any chocolate or coffee. For a second or so, I could pick up a ""Tawny Port"" type of nose. The alcohol is there, but there is also so much more going on  My first sip! Soft and Round, really no alcohol taste to it considering how high the ABV is. But as this one was finishing, what I could pick up was a strong but not over bearing taste of molasses. It was if I was transported to Tennessee, on the farms where buckets of molasses are so present. So needless to say, I enjoyed this stout.  Very unique, something I have never tasted before, but am looking to tasting it again.  01/28/14 Just love the jet black pour into a proper beer glass with a small but dirty creamy head that is really inviting. The initial aroma is coffee, but again, its alcohol and the third sniff, I picked up sweetness like molasses  The first sip was big, very big and full. Letting the beer hit all parts of my mouth, I think what stood out was the bitterness. Taging along was the feel of bourbon from the wooden casks  The finish was big, as big as the beginning, but here the tastes changed somewhat. I felt more of a rich sweetness that coated my throat to handle the burnt-woody alcohol flavor.  As my first tasting of this. Truly unique, very different. I was fortunate enough to taste Goose Islands Chocolate Stout and Barely wine. All three were very unique and enjoyable. But this one was sort of out there, but in a very good way.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,glass_house,5,"12 oz. draft in a snifter at Caliente Pizza & Draft House, Pittsburgh.  Simply, black. One finger of dark tan head quickly fades to a thin ring with moderate lacing. Not at all extraordinary-looking for an imperial stout, but exactly what it should be, and a beauty nonetheless.  The aroma is an incredible blend dominated by dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Not dark chocolate like a candy bar, but rather a fresh, hot devil's food cake. Surrounded by faint vanilla, toffee, dark fruits, bourbon, and a bit of smoke. I suppose at some point I have to stop smelling this and drink it.  Soft on the tongue with little carbonation. It's silky smooth, creamy, and thick without being too heavy or syrupy. Taste follows the nose pretty closely. Smooth dark coffee and slightly bitter dark chocolate lead the way. Caramel and toffee accents quickly follow, and I swear I'm getting a dark cherry sweetness that goes perfectly with the chocolate. The alcohol is warming in the finish, but I don't find it boozy at all. Ample, yet subtle bourbon notes. A masterpiece of dynamic flavors that intermingle flawlessly.  Are there better stouts out there? I don't know, maybe. But this is the best I've had and I'll be thinking about it until the day I can get my hands on it again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

If you see this beer, buy it, in whatever form it comes in... on tap, in a bottle, somehow someone has left some in their glass and doesn't finish it, etc... seriously, you HAVE to have tried this beer.  There's nothing like it to compare it to, there's nothing like it to say, ""Well, if they did ___ instead it would've been better..."" This beer is PERFECT in what it is, to say otherwise is insanity to me. I think some reviews lose site of rating within what the beers are, they get compared to beers outside their categories. I'm not here comparing this beer to other beers I've had and saying, ""Well if Bourbon County had've done ___ it would've been more to my liking."" There's simply no comparison for this beer to say it should be any different, there's nothing better you can point to and honestly say that someone else did this beer better. This is THE pinnacle, this is what any other beers that come after it strive to be.

Sweet bourbon and vanilla up front, some figs and molasses  Taste: Starts with vanilla, bourbon, and oak. Then some nice depth with figs, molasses, and a little earthiness. Some toffee  Mouthfeel: Full body, low carbonation, would like a little more carb from that since I got almost no head.  Overall: Fantastic. Definitely a slow drinker, but amazing for how well rounded it is so fresh, and how it isn't boozy or anything. Going to revisit this four pack each year to see how it develops, but I'm not sure where it can go from here, it is already fantastic. It is almost more like a dessert wine rather than a beer, but there's nothing wrong with that. Glad I finally could get this classic.  Also, on barrel aged beers, I personally feel many don't get it right. This is the second BA beer I've had that I think does.

1549,10672,Act25,4.35,"On Nov 22 2017 captured a 4 oz pour of the '17 at Rattle &Hum. Upped my rating! Nice that it comes out on Black Friday each year.  After spending time with BCBS, letting it arrive at room temperature, when it became very different, more of a dessert wine, I had to say, it's well-crafted, but not my idea of beer. It's more of a thick dessert wine, of which I am not a fan.  At the NYC store where I bought a single, I asked ""$8?"" And counter man said, ""yeah, but it's 3 beers worth, it's all you'll need.""  It certainly packs 3 beers worth of concentrated flavors as well as ABV, but the syrupy nature is … too much for me. It's like drinking the syrup that makes the beverage.  Appearance: Pours an opaque, thick espresso brown color with a so-so mocha latte head that fades fast, but sticks w lots of lace.  Smell: Bourbon in front and center, and it masks a bit the other delightful background notes, which are evocative of a European church: oak, dark chocolate, charred wood, incense, caramel, vanilla, late winter earth, and a hint of dried flowers.  (I cannot get as much out of the nose as others seem to do, due to too much bourbon alcohol.)  Taste: The bourbon powers from the start, then blends with duality of charred wood, varnished pews, incense, and the dark chocolate and vanilla syrups straight from the taps. I don't get as much fruit as others do. Interesting, meditation beer, but drinks -frankly like an over done dessert zinfandel. And although balanced, is a bit too sweet. I feel like it would be GREAT blended in a milkshake.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and syrupy, with low carbonation. Must let it warm, but becomes more and more of an after-dinner dessert wine… flat, syrupy, thick. … And I am NOT a fan of dessert wines.  Had a hard time finishing so drank it along side my Dales Pale Ale for a while, and enjoyed it more with the contrast, and then, finally made a black and tan of them which was delicious and more balanced and interesting to me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The butter is so strong. Kind of soured/rancid. Pros for flavor: roasty malts, chocolate, caramel. Cons: overwhelming barrel, vanilla, butter, soy sauce, sweetness, booze. Mouthfeel is slick and kind of flat. Booze numbs the tongue. I really don't like this at all. It's grossing me out.

Served in a Boulevard Smokestack Series glass (which is weird because I know they have Goose Island branded snifters at Henry's and I don't know why they wouldn't use that. Not that there's anything wrong with the Smokestack glass, I just figured they'd use a matching brand glass.)  Appearance was pitch black with a rock head that quickly dissipated. No lacing to speak of.  Smell was mostly the barrel. There was also a hint of chocolate under the bourbon flavor. Tastes followed the smell, but the chocolate flavor was more prominent and there was also noticeable roastiness and the earthiness you typically get from an old ale. The initial taste was dominated by the bourbon, followed by most of the ""stout"" flavors in the back half of the palate, and returning to bourbon in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was full, though not quite as sticky as I expected.  I generally am not as big a fan of spirit-barrel-aged beers as some on this site, as I don't like whiskey or other spirits, but I couldn't pass up a chance to try such a hyped beer, and overall I think they did a good job with this one creating a barrel-aged beer where the barrel predominates without obliterating all the other flavors, like some other barrel-aged beers are.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T: Everything i expected! Strong on vanilla with huge roast component. Lots of barrel and bourbon. a sweet caramelized raisin with mocha and roast. bittersweet chocolate morsels. Brown sugar and a little bit of bitter molasses. a bit of anise. Toffee, dark fruit and tobacco with a long finish of alcoholic bourbon and coffee. WOW  M: Thick and creamy. Carbonation doesn't exist, its sludge and i like it that way. Finish is long, slightly bitter and dry.  O: This is a beer that totally lives up to the hype for me.

Quit your horsing around, this beer is a 5/5, 10/10, 100/100 whatever you wanna call it, THIS is the best beer in the world  2012 vs 2013 vertical tasting: 2012 highlighted chocolate and a more overall sweetness. Very pleasant. 2013 tasted different, but still very similar. The difference was less chocolate, but more red wine. It actually tasted more like a cab sauv than the previous year. What's up with that? I honestly couldn't pick which tasted better.

1549,10672,BradtheGreat7,4.59,"Review taken from notes: Black Friday(November) 2013.  2013 Vintage  12 oz brown bottle with unbelievably grand labeling. I mean this is the stuff of legend. High quality material in a vintage looking light black with bold white lettering only to be shadowed by a shiny golden trim with a darker gold also being displayed along the top and bottom of the bottle. Poured this into a stemmed tulip glass.  A - BCBS pours an outer space black without the stars. I mean this stuff is super jet black with the dark browns struggling to get any sort of view when held to the light. The head actually pours with a bit more size than I'd expect from a stout this size. Dark brown head sits for a moment or 2 before leaving a thin ring of lace leaving minimal if no stick. But who cares.. This is a BBA stout. It looks like its supposed to. Top marks!  S - big blast of caramel and bourbon Booze. Whiffs of vanilla and a hint of smoke. This is a man's stout if I've ever smelled such a thing. Yummmm... The chocolate! Like brownies that just were removed from the oven. A slight coconut but I mean extremely light from the overall vanilla and caramel bourbon aroma. I'm not sure there is a better smell anywhere than a stout of this quality aged in bourbon barrels. This is lovely and really sits its own pace as it warms. Brilliance.  T - a bit more smoke than the nose, but paired with the bourbon character and waves of sweet vanilla, caramel, coconut roast, and just down right delicious chocolate malt it is a stout to die for. The added smoke in the flavor gives off a nice tobacco hint to it and all the flavors go hand in hand with one another leaving you wanting more of BCBS. The finish has some alcohol warming to it from the bourbon and really becomes even more of a giant as it warms.  M - full and massive. Great texture and the thickness any stout drinker craves. The overall feel is thick and extremely smooth. Booziness is detected but basically goes perfectly with the bourbon notes and texture. A little strong as it warms up but a world class stout nonetheless.  O - before getting BCBS home and in my glass I had numerous people tell me I'd like it loads better than a few other massive American imperial/double stouts I've had before. Mind you, that would take loads of class given the experience those stouts presented myself. But never once did I have in mind of comparing BCBS with anything I've had before. I don't think beer should be compared rather than all of it appreciated. But after having a fresh BCBS I can say with complete honesty that its simply one of the best stouts ever brewed. Is it the best? I've had so many its hard to say. What I can say is that BCBS deserves its respect as a true pioneer and great example of what brewing is today in the great country we live in. I just can't give Goose Island enough respect for such an outstanding BBA stout. I suppose I should give InBev a bit of applause as well given there is a whole lot of us who wouldn't have had BCBS in stores without the expansion. So while they didn't create this gem, they did ensure a whole lot of us got a pack in 2013. And I say keep it coming!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It holds this nice, bourbon, leggy character in the appearance.  S- Vanilla and bourbon up front. Very nice. Some chocolate notes come out stronger, the more it warms.  T- Smooth roast with some cocoa notes. Bourbon comes in near the end. After the finish, strong caramel and vanilla pop in for some extra flavor depth.  M- Super thick. Sweet and bourbon burn finish.  O- Amazing. Almost unbearably strong, but so complex. It really lives up to the hype.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,winningwes91,5,"So I have just gotten into the craft beer scene this past year, and I have to say out of the probably 500 plus beers I've had, this is, by far, the best.  Appearance- Pours like motor-oil, thick (not overly-so), viscous, gorgeous pitch black with a cocoa head that disappeared very quickly.One of the prettiest beers I've ever seen. 5/5  Smell- Holy shit! Bourbon, Chocolate, Coffee, Caramel, Vanilla, Oak and hints of some dark fruits (figs or cherries maybe?). Just a nostril-gasm. 5/5  Taste- Well folks, I just had sex and went to heaven at the same time. Follows the nose perfectly and everything works together in perfect harmony to create this elixir. 5/5  Overall- I'm not one to follow hype, but this beer absolutely delivers/destroys the hype. The best beer I've ever had, hands down. Perfect 5/5. Nothing wrong at all. Would like to see how it ages though.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,zimm421,4.56,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. The pour yields a full black color, with a thin brown head that dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a solid ring around the glass. There's not much lacing left behind.  The nose yields bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruit and deep roasted malts. The bourbon is very evident, but there are no hints of alcohol. Very complex and amazing. The taste is full of dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The dark fruit flavors are really the star up front, but the bourbon quickly comes through in the end to finish things off. There is a little heat in the finish, but it's not until far after the sip is swallowed.  The mouthfeel is very full bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation. The carbonation plays perfectly on the tongue with the thick, nearly syrupy feel. There is lots of stickiness leftover, that sticks around and accompanies the touch of alcohol burn at the end. Overall, this is a wonderful brew, full of deep, complex flavors that I could go back to time and time again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CowsandBeer,4.56,"Bottle poured into a Blind Tiger Brewery snifter. Bottled on 09/26/2012. Fancy, nicely textured label ( which I really appreciate). Picked up at Jack’s after all the noise died down. Let’s see if this was worth the year + wait.  Appearance: Poured straight down the middle produced a ring of reddish brown head. Not much in the way of lacing but plenty of legs. After a while a still black liquid was all that was left.  Smell: Upfront plenty of sticky, sweet stone fruits. Afterwards a heady aroma of toasted, freshly dumped bourbon barrels. Toasted oak, lots of vanilla, caramel, and butterscotch. Smooth and potent.  Taste: Sticky plums and prunes. Lots of smooth chocolate powder, brown sugar and marshmallows form the stout component. Then that Bourbon County burn. Toasted bourbon soaked oak, vanilla, butterscotch, and toffee. Heavy, but smooth and welcoming.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Heavy heat (not boozy) and very sweet. Slightly cloying.  Overall: Look, it’s ridiculous how hyped this beer is but it’s actually really good. Do yourself a favor, go to your local bar and drink it on tap when it’s there (better on tap than in the bottle, more marshmallow notes) and buy a bottle for later. There’s plenty of bourbon barrel notes with enough stout to back it up. The nose itself is enough to singe your eyebrows and make you perk up.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mrkdwrds,4.62,"2013 bottle served at 55 F into a Teku glass. This is my first review on BA. There's probably nothing I can say about BCBS that hasn't been said, but here goes.  BCBS pours jet black and with little head; the viscosity is apparent from the pour. It smells like a BA stout should; sweetness, dark fruit, vanilla, etc. Taste is fantastic. There is some heat, but considering the ABV (this bottle is of the 14.9% variety) the heat cannot be considered a flaw. Tons of bourbon-imparted deliciousness on top of a well-crafted base beer. There is an almost umami characteristic that I really like here. The finish leaves a little bourbon heat and some lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is thick, oily, and coating.  Many barrel-aged beers tend to lack integration in my opinion, in that the base beer seems at odds with the barrel character. Bourbon County is one of the finest beers of its kind because it doesn't suffer from this problem. I have had many bourbon barrel-aged stouts, and this is the absolute best when price and availability are factored into the equation. A true masterpiece.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,StaveHooks,4.76,"2012 and 2013 were poured in a side by side taste test.  A - Black as night with a dense dark mocha head that takes it' time going down. This coated my glass turning it brown.  S - Bourbon, vanilla, dark caramel, loads of sweet barley, cherries, decadent chocolate, strong coffee, very rich aroma. More vanilla and cherry in the 2013. The 2012 had more of a leathery/melded caramel malt aroma.  T - Big bourbon flavor, thick caramel with a hint of char, huge vanilla and amaretto flavor, aggressive whiskey soaked wood, a complex mix of cocoa, coffee, sweet dark fruit, alcohol was more evident in the 2013. The finish flashes all previous flavors with a nice whiskey roundness.  M - The silkiest, smoothest beer I've had to date. Carbonation is medium to low with incredible creaminess. Heavy and viscous body coating the palate with a velvety feel.  Wow! This is one of the best barrel aged stouts, if not the best I've ever had. It's pure bliss. I liked the 2013 better than the 2012 but both were incredible. Highly recommended.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Donco,4.91,"Vintage 2013: Having now tried this beer 4 different times, I can say it's the second most amazing brew I've ever had (only surpassed by Brandy Barrel Aged Hunahpu).  Finally figured I need to do a review. If you love barrel aged stouts, this is the standard by what others should be judged, in my opinion. Appearance is jet black with little head as poured into my tulip glass. Smell is perfect. A mix of sweet bourbon and roasted coffee..just amazing. Taste matches the smell: roasted coffee, cocoa, bourbon..lots of warmth going down with each sip. Yes, this beer gets lots of hype. For some things in life, the hype matches the reality and this is one of those times. Take your time with this bottle for over an hour and enjoy the changes as your beer gains warmth. You won't be disappointed.  Addition to review 3/28/14: I had a 2012 bottle last night and thought it was a ""notch"" lower in taste than 2013.

Bourbon soaked raisins and prunes after. Lots of bourbon, but very estery, as well. Minimal hops and bitterness. A bit cloying toward the end with a final shot of bourbon and fruit. Touch of alcohol and the end with a burning going down the throat.  M: Light carbonation, slightly more of a watery body than you'd expect. Alcohol is definitely present. Not hard to drink, but commands to be sipped.  O: I don't like the base beer, but the bourbon aging helps it out a bit. A bit too sweet and cloying after awhile.

I had a hard time smelling any complexity, only bourbon and a sweet raisin/chocolate smell came through. It probably doesn't help that we are making chilli and the whole house smells of it.  T - First sip let me down, but every sip after that was pretty damn good. I really like the bourbon notes and sweet aftertaste. I hope some of the additional flavors come with aging.  M - Just as thick feeling as you would expect based on the pour.  O - It's a really good beer, and I'm lucky enough to live close to the source so that I can continue to try it each year.

Like knock your socks off good. But then the alcohol hits your brain and you are reminded to slow it down and enjoy.  Go easy with any of these Goose Island Bourbon Counties, not only are they expensive but they will intoxicate you quick, and you will miss out on all that savory stout flavoring.

Fudge, moist chocolate cake, and chewy chocolate candy. Whiffs of smoke and coffee roast. Hints of black currant, plum, and other fudge-dipped dark fruits. Perhaps a bit of polished black leather. Wafts of stiff alcohol.  T: Big wave of chewy dark caramel. Brown sugar and turtle candies. Layer upon layer of fudge and darker chocolate tastes. Chocolate truffles, fudge, devil's food cake. Warm, creamy vanilla. Plenty of stiff and manly bourbon character. Wood and barrel char. Black currant, plum, and hints of black raspberry, all drenched in rich dark chocolate sauce.

Massive amounts of roasted oats, residual sugars, caramel, vanilla, and chocolate. Soon the dark fruits of plums and raisins kick in before the bourbon finishes things off. Booze only adds to the impressive complexity. Big, bold, smooth.  M- Creamy, full body, mild carbonation. Only detractor is a lil hot on the hot side in the finish, but an intense sipper.

A- Poured an inky black, very thick, dark mocha colored head that dissipated instantly and left no lacing. Exactly what you expect for the style.  S- Very prominent bourbon and alcohol notes on the nose, lots of sweetness, some caramel, and bready notes but the bourbon notes are pretty overpowering.  T- Big gooey lightly browned marshmallow, vanilla, rich dark chocolate like a big fudgy brownie, caramel syrup, chocolate and yellow cake batter, some roasted malt, and big bourbon and alcohol notes on the finish.  M- Full bodied, incredibly smooth and creamy, really decadent and silky mouthfeel, pretty big warming on the finish, slight burn, and finishes very dry.

You still get quite a bit of alcohol taste on the finish but it is not overpowering like in the aroma. Moderate bitterness and the higher alcohol presence helps cut the sweetness to a nice level where is able to be the star of the show and flourish but never be cloying.

Smell - bourbon... and more bourbon  Taste - bourbon, but also a bit smokey with hints of chocolate. This year was not as good as last year as I remember it. The bourbon is almost overpowering, but at almost 15% ABV that is to be expected I guess.  Mouthfeel - lighter in body than I expected, but that was interesting, as it was still quite rich in flavor (mostly bourbon though).  Overall - There are two drinks that I enjoy, bourbon and beer. So this beer, despite arguably being over bourboned, was still quite good to me. I think that there are better examples of a bourbon stout right here in Chicago at Revolution Brewery, but they are better because of the lower ABV which allows you to pick up the other flavors a bit more, and experience the best of what this style has to offer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Still tasting mighty fine and better than any of the varietals I've tried this year (actually just the Bourbon County Brand Café de Olla Stout is all I've had so far). ---------------- Re-reviewed September 10th, 2017  2015 Vintage, ABV of 13.7%  Original ratings: 3.5 4.0 4.75 4.0 4.25  Ink black body with a thin yet lasting head. Solid, enticing aroma; lots of esters and roasted grain goodness; fruity. Big, dark grain sweetness dosed with cocoa and bitter chocolate; subtle booziness; dark fruit notes. Heavy body; rich and full.  Some individual rating improvements yet my overall impression remains the same.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Coal-black body with a thin yet lasting tan head. Deep, rich roasted grain scent infused with noticeable bourbon undertone and touches of fudge and milk chocolate. Sweet and boozy are the first taste impressions; loads of chocolate and cocoa. Heavy bodied; velvety and smooth on the palate.  Everything comes across top-notch with this heavy-hitting stout with the relatively minor quibble about a thin head. But, I'm not into beer primarily for its looks, but its flavor, and this monster in incredible! It's a black mystery at first look and then the first (and subsequent) sips reveal all the underlying depth and complexity of robust dark malts, a well-balanced big booze presence that does not overwhelm things, the whole thing being deep and complex yet easily satisfying.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JamieDuncan,4.56,"BCBS pours like almost a syrup. Nice thick looking beer although very little head. The smell is unreal, delicious with a hint of alcohol, probably due to high alcohol content. Just as tasty as it smells but you can certainly notice the alcohol, but at 14% it gains bonus points overall. Great beer and actually not a bad value due to high alcohol content. Will definitely treat myself again in the future.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,clayrock81,4.18,"One of the few heavier stouts that I could constantly keep on chuggin if it weren't for a little sickness/alcohol poisining. Never got my hands on it before and lo and behold it's on tap one time only at local pub so had to have it. Poured a black body with decent sized head that died slow with minimal lace patches. Smell is a cross between old indian cherry bourbon (actually whiskey) and vanilla, oak, roasted malts, chocolate. For such a boozy and heavy beer I find that this beer has an incredible smoothness and is so easy to drink. I get bourbon, booze, woodiness, chocolate, some roasted graininess, vanilla, even some dark fruits like black cherry or figs (minimal, mind you). I didn't really get any ABV burn but it didn't take me too long to sip on this (never really warmed). A definite must try.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Darkmagus82,4.74,"2021 vintage poured from a bottle into a snifter  Appearance –(4.5) The beer pours a pitch-black color with a one finger head of brown foam. The head has a great level of retention, with it slowly fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. The thickness of the brew can be appreciated just by swirling the brew in the glass, with thick fingers of sticky brew clinging to the sides of the glass and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – (4.75) The aroma is massive of a roasted malt smell mixed with tons of chocolate and vanilla. At the same time there are sweet smells of caramel, molasses, and brown sugar, as well as big notes of dark fruit of cherry, raisin, and plum. With these aromas comes strong smells of char and smoke as well as a huge boozy smell of bourbon and rum. With a strong presence of coffee and the mix of the other aromas, a very rich and warming smell is produced overall.  Taste – (4.75) The taste is intensely big and flavorful, all in a very good way. The taste begins with a huge roasted malt flavor with notes of coffee and dark chocolate as well as big flavors of charred sugar, molasses, and toffee. At the start there is also a moderately strong showing of “lighter sweet flavors” of vanilla and caramel, as well as some of the dark fruit of cherry and raisin that were in the nose, are in the flavor profile, with these getting less intense as the flavor profile advances. All the while, a nice warming bourbon flavor develops bringing with it flavors of char and smoke. With a slight loss of a bit more sweet at the end, and an increase in the dark roast and boozy tastes, one is left with a nice roasty and rich, warming taste to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – (4.75) As anticipated from the look, the brew is super thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is low. The feel is spot on for the style, accentuating all the rich, boozy, roasty, and sweet flavors fantastically.  Overall – (4.75) The beer is a legend for a reason, it is huge but balanced with tons of flavor and a fantastic aroma and feel.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2013 vintage poured from bottle into a snifter  Appearance (4.25)– The beer pours an almost pitch black color with a tiny brown colored head. The head fades almost instantly leaving a trace level of lace on the sides of the glass. Upon swirling the brew in the glass, its thickness could be seen, with fingers of the beer clinging to the sides of the glass and slowly receding to the bottom of the glass to its resting place.  Smell – (4.72) The aroma of the beer is massive of sweet smells with caramel, molasses, dark fruits of raisin, plum and cherry, as well as a little bit of vanilla all there. Along with these smells are lots of darker aromas of chocolate and roasted malt smells as well as some other lighter aromas of coffee. Rounding out all these smells, and as the name would suggest, a huge bourbon smell as well as a nice woody aroma mix with the rest of the smells, producing a delicious, very dark, sweet and warming aroma overall.  Taste – (4.75) The taste begins with a big roasted malt flavor along with sweeter flavors of molasses and darker fruits of raisin and prune. Right from the start, there is also a big bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor is big and smooth tasting with lots of oaky and woody flavors mixed within. The bourbon gets even richer as the taste advances, bringing with it just a hint of bitterness as more woodsy flavors and a bit of coffee come to the tongue. Along with these increases in the boozy tastes, other sweeter flavors of vanilla and a bit of chocolate come to the tongue more toward the end complementing the other flavors nicely. In the end, with all the nice roasted, sweet, and bourbon flavors of the brew, a very pleasant and still very smooth, yet somehow very warming taste is left to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – (5) The body of the beer is super thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thick and creamy body are most fantastic for the darker and heavy boozy and sweet flavors of the brew, with the lower carbonation only enhancing these flavors even more. With the lower carbonation and super thick body, all the fantastic flavors really get to sit and coat the mouth allowing the taste buds to be bathed in all the delicious flavors and soothing the mouth with a fantastic feel.  Overall – (4.75) This is a super flavorful, yet massively smooth and balanced stout with an amazing blend of bourbon, sweet, and roast flavor. A sipping stout like no other, and up at the top of my list. Oh so delicious and enjoyable.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I have been won over, Bourbon County Stout lives up to the hype and more, simply put...amazing! Pricey? Yes, but one of the few pricey beers that is totally worth it!

1549,10672,hagbergl,4.96,"Christmas beer of 2013, and ain't she a beauty! The legendary Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, 2013 edition. Let's pour it into the glass and get to reviewing.  Appearance (4.25/5): BCBS is absolutely pitch black and even a vigorous pour into my Beer Geek Nation snifter produces a small brown head that fades fast. Tons of alcohol legs on the glass. Imposing.  Smell (5/5): Mindblowing, incredible complexity in the nose: the bourbon barrel aging lends some major molasses, vanilla, and charred woody oaky notes to the beer. Slightest hints of a dark chocolate sweetness, but this character is masked by the barrel characters. Very rich and decadent. Some light alcohol is noticeable but only underlying. Not much roastiness in this stout's nose, which is fine with me, as I prefer a sweeter stout. Simply extraordinary.  Taste (5/5): Wow! Again, incredible complexity: spicy sweet bourbon alcohol gives the beer a chai latte and marzipan flavor at the beginning. In the middle it gets more sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, toasted coconut, and molasses. BCBS finishes smooth with a hint of dark chocolate and a warming alcohol. The alcohol is there, but it lurks so far in the background; it tastes much more like a 9 percenter. This is a perfect tasting barrel-aged stout.  Mouthfeel (5/5): So much body; the body on this beer is mammoth, yet it manages to be smooth and dangerously easy to drink–but don't, whatever you do, drink this one too quick! Low carbonation--which is right on point.  Overall (5/5): There are precious few beers that are perfect. This is one of them. Savor this one and let it sit over the course of an hour. It gets even better as it warms. Worthy of the hype? Absolutely. Cheers, Goose Island, on this incredible beer!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BoldRulerVT,4.74,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a large tulip glass. Pours motor oil dark and thick, zero head. Smell is amazing, total bourbon in the nose with caramel notes. Taste is insane. Bourbon that fades to delicious caramel and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and chewy. Overall this beer is flat out amazing. I was intimidated by the bourbon on the nose at first but once my palate acclimated, it became warm and delicious. I was so happy to share this with my wife and a good friend.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Zraly,4.93,"In celebration of the 2016 release, I cracked open a 2015 release. Good fortune was upon me as I landed a non-infected 2015 bottle (Date: 01 Oct 15). I've had this tasty beverage more than a few times in my life, but realized I've never properly reviewed it.  Jet black with minimal cinnamon head in a Teku glass. I know, I know -- a snifter of another sort would serve better. I digress. It still looks beautiful and the inviting oak-vanilla-booze aroma still gets funneled straight up my snout. It works in my world right now. Viscous and thick pour.  Dense, rich, and this is more or less is a kissing cousin of Godiva Chocolate Liqueur. This is flawless in terms of flavor. Warm brownies and a very subtle kiss of smoke. Also has the nuance of a container that has stored vanilla beans. The barrel treatment is smooth and only enhances the chocolate and heightens the vanilla. The booze also brings a sweetness of cinnamon-forward bourbon toward the finish. A perfect marriage of flavors.  Velvety smooth with substantial chew. The alcohol is subdued but there enough to remind you of the drink in your glass.  I know there is some shade thrown at Goose Island for the snafu of infected beer in 2015. At the very least, they did refund the infected batches, which is more than some brewers do. Reality dictates, though, quality checks should be better for such a celebrated, and for most pragmatic people, an expensive beer.  Stepping aside for a second, this beer is undeniably delicious. I'm a huge stout and porter fan, and I can say this is truly a benchmark for the Double Imperial Stout category. I can't knock a brewery for messing up and having bad batches which they then correct with consumers. In the spirit of being as objective as humanly possible, drinking this deliciousness right now and rating it for what it is, it is a must have for anyone wanting to taste a sublime, well-crafted stout elevated by bourbon barrels. It's one of the originals, it's iconic, and it's deserving of all praise.  To be paired with sexy lovers, roaring fires, and/or gluttonous abandon.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,DesertRat,4.95,"A: God damn this beer is DARK and GREASY. Epitomizes the motor oil comparrisons that many imperial stouts get.  S: If you favor bourbon barrel stouts, this is perfect. Boozy, which is expected based on abv and the fact this beer is not aged. Rich complex roasted malts.  T: Thickest imperial stout I've had yet. Strong bourbon in the nose, strong body up front, roasted malt, boozy finish.  M: Thick cough medicine, mixed with molasses and while milk. But seriously, the thickness is unlike anything else.  D: I can see why people may have a hard time drinking/enjoying this beer. In my opinion, you have to be in love with this style to enjoy this beer unaged. I think laying this beer down for a couple years would make it more enjoyable for most.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,JMFP,4.74,"Amazing stuff. Deep, dark, brooding pour into a chilled mug. Virtually no head, with only slight foam and lots of tiny bubbles. The smell was a clean, crisp breath of chocolate, toffee, caramel, and vanilla coffee. The nose and initial taste was a heavenly blend of chocolate coffee malt with hints of bourbon and a lingering finish on the palate. I actually enjoyed this more than the coffee varietal, and found it much easier to drink.

T- Outstanding, breath-taking and every other adjective you can think of. Cherry, vanilla and bourbon, it almost tastes like cherry-vanilla soda aged in bourbon barrels, but in a fantastic way.  M- Another home run...really reminds me of a high-class cherry soda. Still has a high level of carbonation, which is, again, surprising.  O- Top 5 beers I have ever had.

1549,10672,beerjerk666,3.91,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a long stem wine glass. Bottled on 11/01/13.  A- Poured into the glass with an aggressive pour, jet black body and a thin amount of head that dissipated quickly, not surprising due to the high abv and barrel aging.  S- Bourbon, sweet plum/prune, almost like a strong barleywine, bourbon, vanilla, oak. Not a huge fan of barleywines so this is not all that pleasing or inviting to me.  T/M- Initial flavors of dark fruit and strong bourbon, vanilla and barrel characteristics. A tobacco/leather flavor comes out as an aftertaste which is very pleasing as it lingers for a while. Little to no carbonation, but a heavy alcohol presence, which should be expected at 14.9%, is very prevalent. Almost too much bourbon, almost.  O- Big, bold, and ferocious in it's aroma and taste; not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to sip at this one for a while as there is a lot going on from the beginning to the end.

A - Pours a fine, rich black color with a rich brown head that dissipates quickly to a narrow ring. It leaves some lacing.  S - Bourbon notes and some faint roasted malts, chocolate and vanilla come through - for as high octane as this is, the smell is a bit underwhelming which isn't necessarily a bad thing since some beers of this sort you can smell from across the room.  T - Wow, the bourbon just comes through and perfectly accents the stout flavors. I'm picking up some toffee, chocolate and vanilla which compliment the richness of the bourbon. It is a bit on the sweet side, which is really nice.  M - Really full bodied and smooth from start to finish. The taste lingers on the tongue and is really creamy.  O - This is one of the best bourbon barrel stouts I have ever had. This is well worth the price for a bottle. Understand that you will need to like both bourbon and dark stouts to enjoy this beer as the flavor is strong and full-bodied.

1549,10672,martyl1000,5,"this is an aged 12-oz. bottle of 2012 BCBS, ten-months-old. it's much smoother, sweeter, with much less astringency than it had last year. There's still almost no head to speak of, poured into a snifter. It looks like soy sauce with some floating bubbles. I might have said it smelled like soy sauce, or at least chilled soy sauce. Then I realized the aroma was tart plum, fruitcake, and moist spice cake. Wow. The aroma is beyond imagining. --- Update 8/28/13 I'm beside myself (even if my less craft-beer-minded guests are non-plussed) with how amazing an aged BCBS is. The most astonishing surprise here is a distinct peppermint stick aroma.  --- Update 12/23/13  Can you say ""Port Wine""? My wife just asked me what I would think if tasting this without knowing anything of its provenance or vintage. I tried to imagine it, and I think, F-ing port wine that somehow has the mildest carbonation.  This is a bottle of 2012, so 18 months old.

Poured black as night into a tulip glass. Overwhelmingly power smell of alcohol specifically bourbon eminating from the glass. Slight brown head. Small amount of carbonation at the top stops fairly short after the pour. Not many bubbles lasting the entire two hour journey. Very powerful on the tastebuds. Robust malt flavor, with hints of chocolate. It's almost like drinking a hard alcohol beverage. Leaves legs on the glass as if it were a Cabernet from Napa Valley.

Smell- Bourbon is dominant, but also coffee and chocolate present. Bourbon is definitely the strongest smell though.  Taste- The bourbon is not as overpowering as the smell would let on, but still very present. Also blended in are hints of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and sweet fruitiness. The alcohol is well covered, and just adds sweetness.  Mouthfeel- Thick. Very thick, just as an imperial stout should be.

It didn't leave any lacing but there was some minor cascading.  S-Bourbon overwhelmed the nose with hints of coconut, vanilla, alcohol, and dark fruits. The only reason I couldn't give a 5 for the nose was due to the overwhelming presence of the bourbon as it overshadowed everything else making it nearly one dimensional.  T-Bourbon, but much more tame than the nose suggested, dark fruits, with hints of coconut, vanilla, fudge, and alcohol. I expected a complete bourbon bomb from the nose but to my surprise this was a very complex and extremely flavorful beer. It is sweet from the alcohol and there is not much roast at all, which I thoroughly enjoyed because I like a more dark fruit forward imperial stout. The beer coats your mouth and begs for you to take another sip, its wonderful. One of the best tasting beers I've ever drank-it is simply amazing.  M-Perfect mouthfeel-its creamy and thick. I don't think it could be any better.  D-This is a true sipper due to the high alcohol content and complexity.

1549,10672,TruePerception,4.48,"2016:  Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout, 2016. 13.8% ABV.  A: Dark toffee brown head; just a slim line, which fades quickly to a thin ring. Black in the glass, and very dark brown in the dimple, with a faint reddish inner glow, and a deep red-brown edge.  S: Deep Bourbon-y chocolate straight out of the bottle. Already reminding me more of two years ago's version. A good sign. Very dark toffee and char sit at the edge. Caramel, slight vanilla, oak. Faint smoke.  T/MF: Not a lot at first; mostly just Bourbon-y char, but as soon as it settles on the tongue, the flavor explode and bloom outward. Caramel, toffee, sweet char, rich chocolate, sweet smoke, light oak, vanilla. Sweet licorice at the back. Bourbon char on the finish. Very rich. Not as much chocolate as two years ago, but much more nuanced. I gotta say this is the best of the three years I've had it.  Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.  2014:  Bourbon County Brand Stout, aged in bourbon barrels. 14.9% ABV.  A: Black with a hint of brown. The thinnest of brown head. No head, but there is a very thin, transparent bit of alcohol clinging to the glass, as wine does. Fades quickly without noticeable tearing. Just the slightest inkiness.  S: A pleasant blend of cocoa, chocolate, bourbon, sweet char, faint licorice sweetness, slight oak note. Nice, without being overpowering.  T/MF: A good deal of sweetness to this one. Sweetened cocoa. Slightly charred toffee. Has an almost sickly sweet upturn towards the finish, and finishes with a little of that same sweetness.  Really good, but I still prefer the w00tstout and Velvet Merkin.  2015:  Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout. 13.7% ABV.  A: A thick pile of haze sits in the neck of the bottle. Just over two finger of medium-dark, toffee-ish head. Fades steadily. Black in the glass. Extremely dark brown, nearly black, in the dimple; just a slim line of dark golden brown, with almost a tinge of red, at the bottom. Very strong sheeting. Appears ever so slightly inky. Lacing is emaciated and does not hold.  S: Deep charred, oaky toffee up front. A note of bittersweet chocolate behind that. Taking in a whiff leaves a lingering sensation of flavor in my throat. Quite nice.  T/MF: Flavor is even darker than the flavor, but along the same lines. Extremely deep toffee, with tons of char. Vanilla bean note as it settles onto the palate. Very rich, extra dark chocolate. Very sweet the whole way. Perhaps a bit too sweet for such a dark flavor profile. A touch of smoke toward the tip of the tongue. Just a touch of booziness. Just the slightest bit of carbonation.  Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle (ugh!), into a Belgian tulip glass.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,YoudownwithABV,4.96,"My first review:  12 oz bottle poured into a snifter at about 45 - 50 degrees  A: A very dark brown color with a tight head and very little carbonation.  S: Bourbon, Vanilla, Chocolate, Coffee, and a slight char.  T: First and foremost if you told me this was almost 15% abv I would call you a liar. It's literally a party in your mouth and you've invited all things I mention with Smell. I'm in love, that's why I bought 2 cases.  M: Coats your mouth with a thin maple syrup feel.  O: This is the real deal Holyfield, borderline one of the best beers ever. I hand this beer out to my friends trying to get them to experience perfection. I can't wait to age this and enjoy for years to come.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TempeBeerMan,5,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours an inky, opaque, deeply dark brown, with a wispy half-finger dark tan head that dissipated very quickly. (Not surprising considering the ABV) Only the faintest hint of lacing.  S - Powerful aroma of prune, bourbon, smoke, wood, and molasses. One of the best smells ever.  T - WOW. Sets a new bar for complexity. Burnt marshmallow, raisin, date, bitter chocolate, smoke, hickory, heavy cream, vanilla, toffee, caramel, anise, and a hint of plum and black cherry. The balance between the sweeter chocolate/dark fruit notes and the bourbon/woody esters is perfection. Boozy in the finish but the flavor is still peaking, making the heat divine rather than distracting. Amazingly, stupendously good.  M - More amazingness, as it's somehow chewy, creamy, oily, and syrupy all at the same time. Low side of medium carbonation. Pretty much the perfect delivery system for the flavor profile and ABV. Warming finish was much enjoyed on the cold, rainy night I sampled this gem.  O - One of the best beers I have ever tasted, maybe THE best. If there was a way to score it a ""10"", I would do so. How they manage to get that much bourbon, wood, and ""heat"" into a beer and still have it balanced with sweetness is pure wizardry. I feel my taste buds may have been spoiled, It's THAT good.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,cam12,4.93,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my bourbon county snifter.  Appearance- dark dark brown not quite black, thin medium brown head. No lacing, very tight bubbles.  Smell- just like smelling into a bourbon barrel, just straight bourbon!  Taste- bourbon in the front and bourbon in the back, the in between is filled with sweet chocolately malt, so rich. Warming alcohol lingers with the finish  Mouthfeel- the best part about the beer, thick and creamy and just sits on your tongue. Medium carbonation.  Overall- lived up beyond the hype, I waited 2 hours in the cold to get it and I would gladly do it again for this gem...in-bev owned or not this is delicious beer. Not really a beer, just the liquid of the gods.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RayzTheRoof,1.85,"Beer snobs will say this is the greatest beer ever, but honestly, all I taste is licorice. That is it. That is all there is. It is just really alcoholic licorice. There are no hints of chocolate or vanilla, and the bourbon is virtually non-existent. It really just tastes like licorice. I don't understand how people taste otherwise.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Maximot,4.75,"...and on the 7th day, god created Bourbon County Brand Stout  Relatively new to bourbon stouts but this clearly sets the bar to date. Very complex with a multitude of flavors..chocolate, vanilla, coffee. Flavors to be expected in such a beer , but in this case, Goose Island seems to have figured out a balance that works out ideally. Moderately rich but not overly intense. Strong bourbon taste evident but well balanced, if not perfectly balanced, with other flavors. This beer can be sipped over a LONG period of time, and rightly so with its bold alcohol content. The flavors seem to linger on the palate longer than other beers in this category.  Subtle post sip heat from bourbon, but again, not too intense to distract from the flavor extravaganza. Moderately heavy/ full bodied. One would be very hard pressed to state that this beer is missing anything or should be changed in any way.  For the alcohol content, total package of complexity, and its scarcity, a 4 pack at $20-$25 should be considered a fair price if not a bargain. It has the ideal characteristics to leave one yearning for a literal bottomless glass. Standing ovation, with request for encore. WELL DONE!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Baron_of_Suds,4.23,"2013 bottle served at 55 degrees.  A: Motor oil, lightly carbonated. Interesting surface tension like crude oil.  S: Raisins, bourbon, molasses, alcohol.  T: Tobacco, bourbon, and brown sugar. Noticeable alcohol. A bit of chocolate later.  M: Chewy oil. Coats the throat on the way down.  O: Exceptional, though a bit hot/raw at this time. I believe this will improve with a bit of cellar time. I will try my next bottle in 6 months to a year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- smells of sweet sugar and coffee.hints of chocolate and a touch of bourbon.  T- tastes of sweet coffee, hints of bitter chocolate, and warm bourbon flavor. Subtle afterthoughts of bourbon that linger on...delicious!  M- one of the greatest mouthfeels that I have ever had to opportunity of placing upon my pallate. Nicely done.  O- one of the greatest bourbon stouts of its time. Very well balanced and wen better maintained...very impressive.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Rainier,1.95,"Umm, where do I start.  First of all, I know the BCBS train is probably gonna be outside my apartment with pitch forks. After tasting this beer, it's either I got a bad batch, I have abnormal taste buds, or it's just an overhyped beer.  Appearance - looked like normal imperial stouts. No head pretty much. Smell - bourbon, coffee, vanilla. Ok, it's typical barrel aged stuff. Taste - Tasted like alcohol straight up. Let it warm up, more alcohol! I get same notes from the smell here. Mouthfeel - meh, it was very syrupy. it left a foul taste in my mouth Overall - worst night of my life. I could not sleep. I kept moving around my bed all night long. Very gassy, trying to burp everytime just to get rid out the fowlness.  Sorry guys, this is my first experience on this beer, but sorry BCBS doesn't do it for me. I'm glad.  Edit: December 16, 2013... This is gross. Sorry guys.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,1000lbgrizzly,4.65,"A: Very dark brown, opaque everywhere but the edges. Small coffee-colored head, quickly fades to periphery of my glass. Bottle art is stark and bold.  S: Holy... shit. Overpowering. Don't stick your nose in the glass, honestly, just waft it over to your noseholes. Intense! oak, chocolate, syrup, vanilla, molasses. Not sure how balanced it is, but the raw power of it is so over the top that I can't help but love it.  T: After that insane aroma, this is actually pretty palatable for an accustomed tongue. Same flavors: oak, nibs of baker's chocolate, some vanilla, smoke, hints of coconut. Overall bitter, but there is some sweetness to counter it. Very intense, crazy high ABV hidden well but does provide some heat on the finish. If you've had your shares of stouts you will probably be in love. Don't get me wrong, this will put half of lager drinkers in their graves.  M: A little syrupy and chewy, but still fluid with perfect carbonation to avoid flatness while maintaining smoothness. Surprisingly not very mouth-drying. Pretty solid.  O: God damn, this is a BREW! Lives up to the reputation, an intense beer, it will destroy unprepared palates. Whether you end up loving or hating it, this is a must-try. World class.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mtraver,4.81,"2013 release, 14.9%. 12 oz bottle to pint glass.  Appearance: It pours deep, dark black, with a very small and short-lived caramel-colored head. Intriguing and, again, ridiculously dark.  Aroma: Nose has notes of toffee/caramelized sugar, sweet bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and a little smoke. It's a very complex nose that keeps evolving, not unlike a good whiskey. And as a guy who loves his whiskey that's oh so appealing :)  Taste: The taste is a wonderful balance of the stout's chocolate/coffee malt and the whiskey, and quite sweet. The finish is dominated by bourbon and is a little boozy, but this beer has more than enough substance to stand up to the alcohol and is, incredibly, totally at home at 14.9%. There's also a lingering dryness on the finish that sort of feels like the oak coming through. Absolutely fantastic.  Mouthfeel: It has a very full, creamy, chewy mouthfeel. It's sticky and syrupy in the best way. The carbonation is subtle, which works well with this beer's huge body -- it's enough to offset what could be an over-the-top creaminess, but any more would be too much.  Overall: This beer is just massive. Immense. Huge. Off-the-charts big. And it's off-the-charts amazing, too. The bourbon barrel doesn't dominate, although it does provide a solid bourbon flavor that works with the stout's malt in a way that enhances each. There's so much there to explore, so definitely take your time with this one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Oscar_The_Rauch,4.68,"Tis the season! I snagged a 4-pack of 2013 Bourbon County on Black Friday, which was the only thing I purchased on that terrible day of the year. I've been building a vertical, but I always like to try one within the first month of the release to see what the current vintage is like.  A: Jet black ""motor oil"" as expected! Very thin head that has a coffee tan color and doesn't hang around for long. But, this beer has been aging in bourbon barrels for some time now.  N: Ohhhh man! FULL of bready roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, brown spice... I guess you could say ""bourbon influences"" too.  T: The beer delivers on the palate exactly what you were hoping for from the nose... PURE OPULENCE. It is rich and full-bodied with all the flavors listed above coating your tongue and sticking to the roof of your mouth. Smoooth mouthfeel. The finish is long and enjoyable with a bit of that heat present in the back, but not disjointed at all.  O: A pretty balanced beer for how high-gravity it is this year (14.9%).

The nose. The aroma. Just the smell of it. Fuck you. It was that good.  Then I tasted it. Ok. Now it justifies the lines and the waiting and the limits and the hype and ""it's TOO GOOD TO MISS"" bullshit that somehow brought me around to bring to my lips a Goose Island since their allegiance with And Hows Yer Bush.  Huge. Not overbearing. Take it slow and it will be the better than the finest port.  Wicked.  Balanced.  Powerful.  Pleasant.  Worth the price/wait/drive/postage. It's great.

1549,10672,ExaltedNecrosis,4.98,"12 oz bottle poured into oversized tulip glass.  A - Pours a pitch black motor oil with one finger of quickly dissipating chocolate brown head. It pours thick and viscous.  S - I get a huge aroma before even putting my nose to the glass. It's mainly bourbon-soaked dark cherry, toasted coconut, chocolate, and dark fruits. The bourbon aroma is sweet and complements the dark fruit perfectly.  T - The taste is very complex. Dark cherry soaked in bourbon, sweet toasted coconut reminiscent of chocolate-drizzled macaroons, chocolate, figs, sweet oaked bourbon, dark fruit, vanilla. I'm amazed at how many flavors I get out of this at all temperatures. The coconut and cherry at the forefront are a nice touch. Minimal bitterness and booziness.  M - Very thick and sticky sweet. Not much carbonation either. Definitely chewy and viscous.  O - I finally popped my BCBS cherry and I have to say that this exceeded the hype for me. So incredibly complex and decadent without being too overpowering in any aspect. The bourbon imparted great flavor with no extra booziness and the dark fruits and sweetness meshed well together. Can't wait to see how this one ages.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Spattastic,4.76,"2013 vintage, bottled 11/7/13  A - Jet black with a thin espresso-foam colored head that dissipates quickly. Slight carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass.  S - The bourbon barrel dominates the aroma: sweet, vanilla, burnt sugar, toffee, and oak. I'm also getting dark molasses, malted milk powder, coffee, milk chocolate, dark malts, a slight nutty quality (almond). There is also a faint stone fruit/berry quality and also a remote soy sauce characteristic that becomes more prominent as the beer warms. The smell is deep, intriguing, and inviting. Even at 14.9%, the alcohol is nearly undetectable on the noise.  T - I'm beginning to understand the hype, the taste, for me, is really where the beer shines. The initial sip is sweet and savory and shares many of the same characteristics as the nose - toffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, dark brown sugar, molasses, chocolate covered raisins, fig jam, oak, and a bready/malty (similar to a quadrupel) quality. The beer finishes with espresso, baking chocolate (unsweetened), and a perfect bitterness. The alcohol is more apparent but I find, surprisingly, that it works in conjunction with the rest of the flavors while also reminding you that you're drinking a big beer.  M - Smooth and silky; carbonation is present but muted; coats the mouth. The beer is viscous, but not overly so. This isn't as carbonated as a typical beer but isn't as flat as other barrel-aged beers I've tried. I think it perfectly suits the style and can't find anything I'd change.  O - This is my first experience with BCBS and I, as I assume many others have done previously, didn't believe the hype. After trying it for myself, I can't think of another barrel aged beer that I'd rather drink. I'm particularly impressed with how the beer transforms from its initial taste to finish with nuance. This likely sets the standard for other barrel aged dark beers.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Retention is good, still waiting for it to die down, down to a finger and a half after 90 seconds. No transparency or visible carbonation. Good lacing, good looking beer  Smells of rich oak, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, and alcohol. All the scents melt into each other really nicely for being so young, pretty complex and fun to smell. Can't find any faults with it  Taste is oak and coffee, bourbon and chocolate. Vanilla and molasses come through next with dark fruits, finishing with a nice bourbon and alcohol taste. Again for being a month old the flavor blends really really well  Feel is thick, smooth, and creamy.

Minimal lacing, you could work it up but it would quickly go away. There also appeared to be alcohol legs S - You can smell the bourbon barrels, maybe with hints of vanilla and coffee T - First taste while it was still chilled brought out a lot of bourbon qualities. Once it warmed up it changed to a more oak, smoky, molasses. It is coupled very well with a cigarette, it makes it taste like a very smoky beer, I would love to smoke a cigar and drink this beer! M - Started out pretty normal in terms of stouts, perfect level of carbonation. Once it became warmer, it became thicker. O - I loved this beer, I bought 2 12oz bottle, as well as half a growler, and I'm saving my second bottle for day when I have a nice cigar. I highly recommend this beer even though a lot of people say it's overrated, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

1549,10672,Maxwell,4.02,"2013 Vintage- The beer pours a midnight black, like motor oil. The beer appears thick and viscous, and forms a very small head of dark, oak-colored bubbles that quickly fizzle away to just a scrim. In body, the beer is opaque and impenetrable to the eye, though presumably free of particles. When swirled against the sides of the glass, the beer leaves a lovely set of legs. On the nose, this beer is boozy with dark chocolate, a touch of dark roast coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate covered raisins running across the nostrils. Soft toasted coconut and a touch of pralines and toffee also make it into the rich nose of this beer, but at its base, this beer is all about the boozy bourbon character which comes through beautifully. I’m getting the sense of a boozy, chocolate covered pretzel for some reason… On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy hot, and sweet with a drying boozy finish. The heat begins a little too hot but is smoothed out by the chocolate sweetness, while mild tannins dance at the finish alongside a roast bitterness, and just a hint of hop bitters as well before the booze makes one last hurrah. In flavor, the beer begins briefly as hot fusel alcohol, morphing into rich and boozy bourbon it develops flavors of vanilla and oak and then the stout comes through giving dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, and then chocolate milk flavors. The finish is hot with alcohol while mild tannic wood presses through alongside slight charred smoke, the finish eventually unfolds further stout characteristics, but only after the heat has moved down the gullet. A touch of char comes through in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer feels perfect for the style. It is richly full in body, like milk or even heavy cream, with a soft carbonation that is nearly nonexistent. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and silky with a thick chewiness that completes the beer. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left tingly with alcoholic burn, yet dry with only hints of salivation at the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is BCBS, a classic of the Bourbon Barrel Aged Stouts, and it is a great beer. I personally would sit on my bottle for a little while longer as the heat is a little too hot for me right now. The beer is rich in everything you want from a barrel aged stout, though, and is a damn fine beer. This is a whale worth hunting down.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A ring of head holds steady for quite some time.  The smell is overpowering. I opened it outside and could smell it from a couple feet away. Big barrel character flexes its muscle with toasted coconut and vanilla. Chocolate, a little bourbon heat, and some small amount of coffee/roast comes out. A fairly bright cherry note as the beer warmed up.  This is delectable. More bourbon flavor and heat is coming through on the palate. Lots of barrel delivering vanilla and coconut.

1549,10672,magictacosinus,4.57,"Glad to have seen these around here after a good long wait - I have some '12 bottles (which I will review here later), but I was morbidly curious to see how this is beer drinks fresh. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip wine glass. Split with a friend. 2013 vintage.  Yeah, that's a pretty dark beer right up front. I could perhaps make up some light brown strokes at the rim of the glass, but even when pressed against a bright light, it seemed futile. Pours a very light fizzy off-mocha colored head that dissipates into pretty much nothing. From afar, alongside viscousness, it looks like a chocolate coffee liqueur of sorts. While I definitely have seen better looking imperial stouts, I doubt there's any that look this opaque, still, and yet appealing in the sense closer to wine than to beer.  Wow, that's really a fabulous aroma - good to see that GI is indeed cranking up their BCBS recipe at their flagship location in Chicago. Notes of bourbon abound, complete with vanilla, toasted coconut shavings (the resemblance is remarkable), roasted coffee, chocolate, burnt toffee, light nutmeg and baking soda, and maybe a little bit of tobacco. No booze or heat on the nose, with only the relatively (and shockingly) mild sweetness overall. Dark fruits make up a good deal of the aroma, with dark ripe cherries, raisins, and prunes adding extra complexity to the flavor profile. What's so striking about this isn't even the array of flavors, nor the near perfect melding of bourbon with a high quality stout, but rather how pleasant, opulent, and elegant the beer is overall. This is what every bourbon aged stout should strive for, in my view.  The flavor is equally present, and - amazingly - full of surprises at every additional sip. At first, there's an immediate bourbon/roasted malt combo that soaks the palate, delivering a combination of vanilla, coconut, caramel, burnt toffee, and vividly roasted notes of dark chocolate, espresso beans, and dark cherries and raisins. Contains an array of spices both from the oak and malt profile, ranging from tobacco, licorice, and black strap molasses. Finishes both roasted, caramel-y, and nutty, with flavors of almonds and peanut butter. No matter what, however, this is enormously restrained in terms of holding back any potential sweetness, and the alcohol is horrifically hidden well. Nevertheless, it's relatively syrupy in feel, and its liqueur-like still texture (inhibited by some mild carbonation throughout) makes it quite decadent. I didn't sip this because of its richness. I sipped this throughout because I didn't want this magical elixir to leave my glass, well, ever.  A legend among the great craft brews, in my distro at last. While some of us could argue that the ends do not justify the means in the politicized debate involving GI, this is an undeniably wonderful beer. In a way, it kind of transcends everything you know about beer - I handed this over to some exclusively wine-only drinkers and they commented how delicious this was. Because, in the end, it is. And, it's extremely well made - one does not simply throw in a stout into bourbon barrels and achieve successful results. This is a very well thought out beer in every sense of the word. With that said, I give myself a graceful and humble bow to the brewers at GI, and rejoice.  UPDATE (1/6/2014): You know what it is they say about hype... This totally lost during a bourbon barrel stout blind tasting, which bummed me out. Pretty syrupy and ranges on Dark Lord sweetness the more this warms up. At the same time, the flavor is pretty top notch, but perhaps this is best when aged. I'm going to see how the '13 vintage goes, and crack open some '12 vintages all in good time. Until then.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,NERM,4.77,"I finally had this beer after hearing about it for a year. Even if you are not a Stout fan I would try this just for the experience. As you can see, it is higher in alcohol so splitting it with someone would be allowed (maybe even encouraged). There is nothing like a tasty, hardy, stronger stout on a cold winter night and this is the perfect beer for that. I also put one aside (had to hide them from my brother-in-law) and will crack it open next holiday season.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Celtics76,5,"I was fully onboard the Bourbon County Hypewagon on Black Friday. I've had the 2013 and 2014 versions, and believe it is worth the hype.  On to 2015..pours solid black with a dark brown head that diminishes rather quickly. Aroma is heavy on bourbon and molasses.  At 14.3% ABV, I expected it to be super boozy. It is in fact boozy, but not so much that it overpowers the beer. I am shocked at how easy this is to drink. Maybe my palette has gotten less sensitive over the years, but regardless I'm drinking this like I drink Irish stouts.  There is a lot going on here. In addition to the bourbon heat, you get molasses, dark roast coffee, vanilla and a touch of toffee. Syrupy mouthfeel.  I have 2 more of these - I'll have one in a couple of months, and the other in a year. Curious to see how it develops. But I don't see how it can get much better.  Edit: I highly recommend aging this for 4-6 months before consuming. While it was great fresh, a little age on it brings it up a notch. Everything just blends together beautifully. I'm adjusting my rating accordingly.  Edit2: 2018 is amazing.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Head lasted well under a minute. No lacing, but some sticky legs. Lots of vanilla, bourbon and molasses in the aroma. Not much else in the nose. Nice bourbon warmth throughout the taste without it being overpowering. Typically I don't like a ton of bourbon booziness in a stout, but this holds it up extremely well. Bourbon taste without the booziness. Nice vanilla sweetness in the front with some toffee and chocolate up there as well. Mid-palate is some of that molasses with the bourbon and earthy oak at the end. You certainly don't get any of the 14.9% abv in this bad boy. Mouthfeel is nicely viscous without being thick, very low carbonation.

1549,10672,GarthDanielson,4.84,"2013 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a goblet, the beer is jet black, with hints of chestnut highlights around the edges when held up to light. Sparse, filmy surface coat of tan colored head. Looked oily and thick when poured. Aromas of vanilla, oak, booze, cocoa nibs, and mocha coffee. Very rich, very robust, and very inviting. Flavors are very roasted and bitter on the forward tongue, but with a subsequent vanilla and cream character that provides an amazing balance. Chocolate notes, bittersweet, present mid-tongue, with more of the woody and booze characteristics coming, as well. Building warmth as you drink, as a 14.9% ABV is wont to do. The body is velvety smooth, and supports all the rich and robust character perfectly. Rich, bitter roasted aftertaste, with coffee, vanilla, and booze all lending themselves to a linger. The finish is smooth, but boy does it finish slow, which is exactly how you want this beer to leave your palate. This is a heavy beast, and a sipper to be sought after.

A - Black with a 2-finger tan head that fades quickly and almost no lacing.  S - Rich, high-quality bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark fruit. Luscious.  T - Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, coconut, touch of smoke, dried plum, raisin, molasses, black licorice and alcohol. Aftertaste is molasses, bourbon, raisin, roasted malt sweetness and bitterness.  M - Medium-heavy body and light carbonation. Substantial, moderately creamy/syrupy.

There was less than a finger of tan head that dissipated pretty quickly and left some lace, but the lace itself was not very thick or sticky. The bourbon notes in the nose are striking. The mouthfeel is creamy and the roast profile is quite hearty, but secondary to the bourbon notes in the flavor profile. The bourbon and roasted notes blend perfectly on the finish.

Heavy notes of chocolate and bourbon up front. Then the onslaught of complexity hits. Coffee, vanilla, raisins, dark cherry, molasses, toffee, and oak just wash over you. Taste lingers long after the sip.  M- There's some warmth from the alcohol. But it's big, almost creamy, and quite slick. Little carbonation. I can't really see where they could improve on it.

Even swirling resulted in a scant foam cap over the top, nothing more. Very little foam left after about 2 minutes, no lacing, etc.  Aromatics are sooo strong! Booze, fruits like cherries, plums and raisins, notes of toffee, chocolate, roasted grains, oak. Wow, and did I mention the booze?  With the first taste there is sooo much going on. The chocolate, the raisins and cherries, the roasted malts, the ever present bourbon, a little vanilla and some oak. Booze is never overpowering. As it warms, everything just becomes more prevalent with the bourbon leading the parade if you will.  Nice, thick, chewy mouthfeel. Smooth and a little slick. This stout deserves to swirl around your palette and touch every taste bud. Very little carbonation detected. Nice, semi sweet finish with a little heat from the bourbon influence. A little roasted coffee at the end too.  Well, I think it reached the expectation I had in my mind, influenced a little by what I've read from other BAs. This is a big stout, with a big flavor profile centering around the bourbon characteristic. For me, this is one of those stouts that one is enough for the night.

Moderately low level of carb, as expected. Overall this will always remain one of my favorite beers.

This quiet little bar had gotten one case shipped to them. I was lucky enough to stop in to try it last night and it was worth every penny.  This beer is pitch black with hints of brown around the edges with absolutely no lacing.  The nose produced a massive hit of bourbon and the flavors that come with it: vanilla, oak, and booze. The malts gave me dried fruits like fig and raisins. There was also dark chocolate and caramel present. It was like smelling dessert.  The dried fruits were the first taste I picked up. This was like drinking liquefied fig (in a good way). There was also a heavy cherry feel for more fruity sweetness. Then the booze came on, hot and heavy. The bourbon just smacks your palate. It's spicy but then gives way to the extremely sweet and dessert like finish of dark chocolate, smores, and a bit of that charred barreling process. The sweetness is relentless as is the warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel is creamy, massively sweet and cloying but really full bodied.  My one critique is as the beer warms the alcohol taste becomes more prevalent. However, I do understand why people mark their calender for the annual release of this beer.

As the beer warmed, the chocolate and roasted coffee notes came forward, but the bourbon and oak remain the stars here.  M - A sharp bite of heat, but given the density, surprisingly smooth. This could have coated like an oil slick, but it didn't.  O - I am going to let my other bottles mature for a bit, I think. There is no question that this is a stellar offering, and I'll be interested in seeing how it unfolds over time.

The foam left behind was just a slight ring around the edge of the glass and a few islands of bubbles floating in the center. When swirled, there was noticeable and sustaining alcohol legs. The beer itself is a pitch black abyss with absolutely zero light coming through even when held to a light source.  S: Huge bourbon and oakey, vanilla nose that hits right off the cuff. Dark roasted coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate and dark fruit notes all very distinct and pronounced. Alcohol is there but not over powering. Thick caramel and toffee scent coming through also as the beer warms up.  T: Where to start.. The bourbon barrel flavor really comes through in this beer, vanilla, earthy, woody, rustic tasting barrel flavor that sits on the pallet after the bourbon has washed away. The strong and complex malt profile on this beer only compliments those flavors with notes of dark chocolate, chocolate covered cherries, cocoa, gram cracker, plums and raisins to name a few. Bitterness is firm and I find it hard to determine if its coming exclusively from the hops or if the barrel is contributing to that impression.. either way its spot on for this beer.  M: Alcohol warming is moderately strong and reminds you to sip this flavorful beer. Very low carbonation and a big body. There is a slight numbing sensation I associate with the bourbon as its being sipped also.

Mouthfeel is really full, smooth, silky, light carbonation, finishes a little hot but at 14.9% I doubt that will change with time.  what can I say it is BCBS, its a classic and it is for a damn good reason, I do not care who owns it, I will still buy it, how can you not? It is amazing.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,KVNBGRY,4.65,"On tap  Appearance - Brilliant black body. There is but the slightest noticeable carbonation lurking to the top of the pour but leaving no head, and, subsequently no lacing.  Aroma - Bourbon, chocolate, wood, raisin, prune, all noticeable.  Taste - Similar to nose. There is a slight vanilla, and even cherry note as the beer warms. It tastes like a bowl of raisins, wood, bourbon, and a couple cherries were all covered in melted chocolate and someone sprinkles half the guts of a vanilla bean on top. I believe this is near a league of its own in the bourbon barrel stouts category. Impressive.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth. The 14% tries to make an appearance but the malt pushes it away. The alcohol makes no appearance other than how you feel after a glass.  Overall - Constantly changing, this beer has everything you look for in a bourbon imperial stout.. And more. Complex, yet easy to follow if you make an attempt. Very impressive.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Appearance: black, but clear (not cloudy) , very very slight slight reddish toward the edge Smell, Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, cherry, oak, bourbon Taste, Chocolate, coffee, cocoa, vanilla, nutmeg, cherry, plum, tobacco, leather, bourbon. Gatdamn! Is that great. Rich, but not over powering. Aftertaste lingers clean with coffee, chocolate, and those bourbon flavors, tapering to coffee and bourbon.  And...the promise of the nose delivered! Overall, one, if not the best brew (beverage) I've ever tasted.  Prost! -M-  @Rainer, Keep trying, and tasting!

1549,10672,Roguer,4.7,"Lovely dark motor oil black brew. Thin but present dark brown head, quickly fading to an oily sheen. Absolutely lovely looking beer.  The bourbon smell is tart and overpowering at first. Cocoa and coffee come through afterwards, as well as vanilla bean (in order of strength). Wheat and malts. Just a hint of sharp tartness, not unlike grapes, but much more subdued than in other stouts.  Taste is much smoother than the aroma. Creamy and milky, with more individual tastes than I can figure out from a single taste. Sweet and grainy bourbon, but so much more subdued than in a lesser barrel-aged beer; creamy chocolate; vanilla bean and oak; barely noticeable hop bite.  The bourbon comes in on the initial flavor, and comes in again on the back end, wonderfully book-ending perfectly smooth chocolate malts.  Thickest, fullest mouthfeel I think I've ever had. Absolutely chewy. Very warm; there's no avoiding the fact that this beer clocks in at 14.2%, but it's done phenomenally well. Tiny sting from carbonation; it lends a very necessary balance to what is otherwise a silkily smooth and creamy dessert.  I honestly did not expect to be this impressed, because I don't like bourbon. Its influence is undeniable, but instead of overpowering the stout flavors, it really does complement them perfectly.  This is the only beer to enjoy over an evening, and to be enjoyed slowly and lovingly. I can't believe how well-made it is; it may not be my favorite stout right now, but it is the best.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,oN3xM,5,"This was a 12oz 2013 bottle that I drank just 2 days after its release on Black Friday. I drank it from a snifter at around 56°F within one hour. ABV is 14.9%  A - After popping the cap and hearing that slight fizz, a thin body with deep black color poured out. They say ""motor-oil"" thick, but this beer has a motor-oil color. Super dark and not a fraction of light shines through it. Zero head even after a vigorous pour, and what almost looked like a forming head, quickly dissipated. A thin line of brown bubbles lines the glass around where the beer's surface sits.  S - As soon as you crack this bad boy, subtle sweet bourbon notes float around you. Even at a distance of 2 feet I still get wafts of that sugary booze. The scent is intensely sweet (in case you haven't picked up on that yet) with other notes of burnt malts, nutty chocolate, coffee, and of course bourbon.  T - Tasty cocoa nibs melted over a coffee-and-bourbon-infused, roasted almond with a sugary vanilla glaze would accurately describe the taste. Not sure if anyone has ever made such a thing, but this is it in liquid form... and it's damn delicious!  M - For a beer that's packing nearly 15% ABV, the way GI disguises the alcohol burn is beyond me. Very impressive. There's still a small amount of heat after a swallow, but none like any other &gt;15% beer I've had. Moving onto carbonation... there isn't much, but that's expected from an imperial stout like this.  O - What a wonderful beer. I truly think that BCBS is the definition of bourbon barrel aged stouts. Not too sweet, hot, or thick. Goose Island prints on its label that it can age over 5 years in the bottle. I don't doubt that, and I'm excited to see how my other 7 bottles will develop over time. If you're on edge about trying one, I suggest you buy/trade for one now. Cheers!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,timahood32,4.15,"On the nose get exactly what the name says straight bourbon oaky notes with the smell of dark roasted malt. The stars of this beer for me are the taste and appearance. The beer is pitch black in appearance exactly what i expect to see in an stout only disappointment is there was no real head to speak of, but at 14.9% what do you really expect. Now on to the taste 1st on the tongue you get the taste of oak followed by notes of maple, dark chocolate and roasted coffee. At 14.9% you really don't taste the alcohol the only thing you really get is a slight warming in the back of the throat to give you some warning of the alcohol content of this beer. Overall really complex beer so complex I really dont think I can put it in words, you defiantly have to try this beer for your self, well worth the hype.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Dark fruits, toffee, vanilla, bourbon. Faint chocolate smell and definitely a hit of booze.  T - Very smooth taste for such a high ABV. Vanilla, caramel, and chocolate I'm getting upfront. Followed by a dark roasty taste and dark fruits. Getting some boozy tons from the bourbon but definitely not overpowering. Still, definitely a sipper, thats for certain.  M - Very smooth. Full bodied with minimal carbonation.  O - What's there to say that hasn't been said by a thousand others?!

Great dark, black color and not an overwhelming, but powerful bourbon aroma. Not a thick head but a dark brown tint. Taste was just like having a Makers Mark on the rocks! Sweet taste initially, followed by the classic stout flavor. This was a great beer and the 14% ABV is for real! I'm sitting here sipping on this in a chilled pint and I am feeling it!

1549,10672,RBassSFHOPit2ME,5,"Previous review of 2008 Reserve on 3/07/2011: (4.66)  Not following regular format here.  This is a very near perfect beer. Age has done wonders for this beer. Tons on vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, hints of chocolate and cake batter mellowed and blended perfectly together.  What can I say that already hasn't been said? When it comes to complexity in any beer I've ever had, I don't think there's ever been more.  The only downfall I can find is that it's a little sugary towards the end but at 13% it's expected. This is the only reason why this doesn't get 5's across the board excluding drinkability. Not sure any variation of BCS deserves a 5 in drinkability. Sipper for sure.  I'm SO happy after having this one that the RARE is the same year. I won't touch that one and only RARE I'm cellaring for at least another year.  SUBLIME!!!  2013 Re-Review:  Again, not following regular format here.  This displays everything flawlessly about what Bourbon Barrels lend to Beer. Obviously Stouts in general, but this for me is the perfect Bourbon barrel Aged beer.  Fudge cake pastry Chocolate soaked in Bourbon with some mild dark fruits and heat in the finish. Vanilla Oak and sticky, yet smooth. That sticky Barrel just lingers on the palate for days! Keep smacking my lips minutes after each sip, and Loving it.  Mouthfeel thick and sticky, yet Pure Satin Velvet and smooth.  This beer is fresh. Bottled in November 2013 and I'm finding this hard that much age will improved upon this specimen. When I had a 2008 bottle back in 2011, it was basically the same beer I'm tasting now from memory, only more sweet and sugary. If that is what age will do to this, I say drink this fresh! I can find no flaws. The epitome for the style IMHO.  The only other perfect 5 Beer I've given besides PtE after 4 & 1/2 years on this site.  ISO the base beer!

Low carbonation but very full bodied.  o: Amazing, a world class beer that definitely still stands up to it's rating.

Huge aroma of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, a touch of smoke, dark rich sugars, licorice, and dark fruits. Intense and complex, the huge roasted malts and oak character manage to hide the alcohol quite well in the aroma. Taste follows similarly. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, dark fruits. Very sweet. A slight burn on the end from being a young beer with a high abv. Incredibly thick and rich, low carbonation.  One huge stout.

1549,10672,Samuel906,4.65,"Starting with appearance... this is the epitome of what a stout should look like. Pours absolute, sheer black, thick and like crude oil with a thin brown head. Zero light comes through even with a 600 Lumen flashlight on the other side of the glass. BLACK. At the very edges, it has a golden hue as opposed to the more common black with a reddish hue. Good lookin beer. Smell is well... bourbon... And lots of it. Bourbon, mild coffee, chocolate and coconut. Like a Mounds Bar... soaked in bourbon. The taste is simply incredible: robust but smooth bourbon comes first with the oak and vanilla you would expect. Bright notes of roasted coffee, molasses, vanilla and chocolate linger well after you finish your sip. The booze is very apparent, but not undesirable. This is a warmer; you feel it in your gut! Feel is heavy, thick but silky smooth. Almost zero carbonation. Coats your mouth and everything else on the way down leaving a boozey warmth wherever it touches.

Milk chocolate, some black coffee, vanilla, a slight woody flavor and a noticeable but not overwhelming amount of bourbon.  Mouthfeel- Great mouthfeel and carbonation. It is extremely creamy and smooth. My first thought was its like drinking a fluffy cloud.  Overall- A great bourbon stout. The bourbon isn't as strong as some others that I have had but it is a great compliment to the stout. I will say this is a much better beer as it ages.

I hate the hype, but this time it is warranted, I have to say, my very first one last night was one of the VERY BEST I have ever had. I went after the Abyss, and Butte, and several others; but this one is worth the hype! twelve full ounces. not 11. not 11.2. not 12.5. but good old-fashioned American 12. even the bottle feels heavy picking it up. perfect amount of bourbon aroma. no overpowering pseudo chocolate, or coffee to cover any potential imperfections.... viscous, but not overly thick. syrup-y, but not gaggingly so. super nice sweetness at the very end. and 14%. wow. knowing that AB or InBev (or whoever the heck they are) took over was a little disconcerting. I had heard so much about this stuff and figured they would change the ingredients, go cheap or just short-change everybody but I am very happily surprised. I place this one at the very top of my list, among the other excellent brews that are just a notch above the very good ones. the flavor hits me the most as it goes down my throat and leaves a thin coating of sweetness. this review lacks the adjectives and descriptions but that is only because it is all already covered by so many others today. my bottle says bottled on Aug 20 and is 14.2%. even the thick label gives it some personality. two down, two to go... and still in the hunt for more... I feel disappointed in myself for awarding such high scores to so many others in the past. this one is definitely there. add: 12/31/15 hate the new label and the new bottle. and HATE that it is SO SALTY..... what have they done with 2015's version?",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Great amounts of vanilla and caramel, lighter amounts of dried fruit. Slightest amount of smoke comes in before the booze closes it strong.  T- Much like the smell, the caramel and vanilla from the bourbon hit up front. Dates and figs are present, and a lot of black coffee. The alcohol is present in a perfect way. a silky dark chocolate malt finishes strong.  M- Thick, smooth, velvety. light carbonation coats the tongue. Makes for the perfect sip.  O- Blown away.

Finishes with some vanilla and coconut along with a bit of a warmth from the booze. 14.2% abv will do that.  M: Very bold. You definitely have to be used to/want this kind of heaviness from the flavors. It feels sticky in the finish.  O: Excellent beer. VERY robust. One is more than enough for a night.

Ah yes, at long last I have finally acquired a bottle of the legendary Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout. Infinitely stoked to finally have this bottle, I have been waiting for this moment my entire life it seems. Every beer moment from now on will probably just be insignificant. My bottle lists a 14.90% abv.  Poured into a clear balloon snifter.  A - Pours a thick viscous oil slick black. Barely any conjuration of head, but creates a nice quarter inch of dark chocolate head when swirled in the glass. Bit of alcohol lacing sticks to the glass momentarily, but then falls. Looks truly amazing.  S - Smell is truly amazing also. So much going on. Beautiful vanilla. Cream. Caramel. Toasted oak wood. Alcohol fumes. Rum soaked raisins. Dates. Figs. Creamy chocolate. So rich, so complex.  T - Beautiful creamy vanilla. Silky milk chocolate. Bourbon alcohol warmth, but never too much. Some bitter coffee bean on the finish. Faint tart prune / raisin / date taste. Caramel. Hints of toasted coconut. This is some seriously next level type shit.  M - Feel is smooth, creamy, & silky. It rolls over your tongue like a cloud with a faint impression of whiskey / bourbon heat and some chocolate lingering on the finish.  Overall, an epic, beautiful beer from every angle.

1549,10672,PaulyB83,4.64,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Bottled on 08/29/13 14.9% ABV  A- Pours a think used motor oil black with a small dark brown sugar colored head that has to fight through the beer to form. The head dissipated to nothing very quickly but would come back on swirling and leaving quickly again. This beer clings to the glass amazingly.  S- Vanilla, bourbon, and dark dried fruits, nice buttery toffee all in perfect balance and all at big levels. I'm almost afraid to drink it because I don't want it to go away. Some ABV but not 14.9%'s worth.  T- This is one of the smoothest high ABV I've had. Much of the aroma but turned up and with a wonderfully Imperial stout finish. There is more ABV in the nose than in the taste. Oak, vanilla, dark roast, dark dried fruits. Alright after about an hour of warming up the ABV is coming through more and warming the throat. Still a pretty smooth high ABV beer.  M- Nice thick consistency, coats the mouth nicely. Not a lot of carb, but that is to be expected.  O- First time having this and went out on Black Friday to make sure I got some. Wish their was a little bit more head retention that I found in Black Note, kinda takes away from appearance for me. But that really is the only knock on it for me. Great balanced bourbon flavor and the stout coming through in the finish is pretty great as well.

1549,10672,Chiefy770,4.67,"Poured from a 12 fl ounce bottle into a Goose Island chalice.  Appearance: Rich dark brown, heck, nearly black body. Very thin bubbly light-brown head formed and did not linger.  Nose: Bourbon galore! Whiskey hits the nostrils hard. Sweet caramel and chocolate follow. Almost smells like someone decided to add a respectable amount of whiskey to a batch of brownies.  Taste: Pretty remarkable taste. Much like the nose, the bourbon is the first thing I tasted. The hops travel very well with the bitter taste of alcohol. The bourbon taste wears out and very tasty notes of chocolate and caramel break through. Toasted, almost burnt malts create somewhat of a smokey backdrop. The high carbonation makes this feel tangy and leaves a bitter finish.  Overall: I am still fairly new to the craft brew scene, in fact, this was my first Bourbon County Stout ever! It was great to meet fellow enthusiasts outside the liquor store as we stood in line. I'll be honest, this beer has an incredibly bold flavor. I was almost too overwhelmed after the first few sips. The taste is incredible, you just have to enjoy whiskey.

1549,10672,scotorum,4.36,"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into an Innis & Gunn flute.  a: Black with just a hint of ruby at the bottom when seen through light, thin tan head disappeared quickly to just a few hints of lacing.  s: Bourbon  t: Bourbon and dark malt up front. Puckers the back of the mouth, and alcohol burn on the way down, no surprise given the highest ABV I have ever had in beer (15%). Slightly fruity finish.  m: Medium to heavy, smooth except for the aforementioned tendency for the sides of the back of the mouth to pucker, and the raging alcohol burn on the way down.  o; Packs a wallop of bourbon, dark malt and alcohol. More substance and less dominant bourbon flavor to it than the only other bourbon flavored beer I have had, Alltech's Kentucky Bourbon Barrel. Pretty overpowering. I can see why it is so highly rated. Still, if I want bourbon flavored beer, I think I'll go with something less lethal, not to say a helluva lot cheaper.  UPDATE 11/29/14: 2014 regular BCBS was delayed but a local store put out some 2012 on Black Friday to satisfy demand. Let's see how it fared.  a: Poured an oily opaque black with a thin head of unusually large bubbles which disappeared fairly quickly. Poured into a Unibroue stemmed flute.  s: Strong bourbon.  t: Bourbon and intense dark chocolatey malt. Alcohol burns the throat. Later the bourbon flavor dominates more completely.  m: Medium to full, oily, quite a bit of carbonation tingle.  o: Unique and outstanding! Definitely a slow sipper, a real boozy powerhouse that will never be accused of being watery. Bought some 2014 today and will do a comparison with this and 2013 very soon!  UPDATE 11/26/18: The last two years I was unable to find any, but 2018 is in hand. ABV now up to 14.7%. It's now $13-14 for half a liter (2015 was $10). More powerful than ever with a brown head which disappeared quickly. Not much aroma but lots of bourbon flavor. Medium mouthfeel seems a bit lighter than I remember (still have some 2014 I have one of every few months or so, but then that has aged and may be heavier than it was originally). it's still unique, and although not noticeably better than previous years, the experience I've gained since then requires giving BCBS more credit than I have in the past.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Half finger of deep cinnamon colored head which quickly dissipates. Strong initial carbonation, but quickly fades.  S - Intensely fragrant. Bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, and dark chocolate.  T - Very flavorful. Bourbon, dark chocolate, espresso, and brown sugar. Bourbon well balanced with other flavors. No doubt this is a big beer, but not a glass of bourbon... it's a stout with bourbon tones. Very warming and slightly peppery from higher alcohol content. However, despite ~15% ABV, it's not an alcohol bomb. You know it's there, and it's definitely a slow drinking beer, but it is not overwhelming by any means.  M - Silky with very nice carbonation.

Scent of figs, vanilla then wood and of course, bourbon. A little dry sting to the nostrils.  Taste of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dried dark fruit, cocoa nibs. Finish is very oaky and bourbony but balanced with sweetness. Alcohol is present, but goes smoothly over the palate.  A tad bitter, but a nice balancing sweet finish. Viscous and a bit chewy.  Overall, very balanced, and as smooth as a beer this strong can be. This is really the only beet I've had that deserves the word bourbon in the name. Not just a hint of bourbon, they did it right.

1549,10672,Aristeia_88,4.71,"So this review will be for the 12oz, 2013 edition of 14.2% ABV bottled on 04SEP13 poured into an Innis & Gunn snifter. I managed to find a 4 pack of it from the beer store up the road for $22.99. Seems a bit much, but considering that breaks down to less per bottle than Chimay, I'll call it a bargain...  A: First off, I like the packaging- Even that has a matured, well thought out feel to it, printed on high quality paper... Pours black with a slight reddish tint and has a dark tan head of about one finger that recedes quickly and leaves no lacing. A swirl of the glass and it coats all sides in a viscous amber ribbon.  S: Definitely picking up the bourbon, caramel, vanilla, oak, chocolate and maybe a bit of smoked peat like a good Wee Heavy Scotch Ale. Not picking up on any hops or abrasively overpowering alcohol- Just pure, sweet Bourbon Imperial Stout.  T: Now for the big one- I took a sip, and without the flavor even registering yet, I was smiling... In a word, it's amazing- All of the aromas that were there, are amplified in the taste. Thankfully, It wasn't as sweet as I was expecting, The coffee flavor gives way to charred oak and vanilla-caramel as the dominant notes. There's just barely an alcohol note at the very end that warms as it goes down.  M: Not quite as thick as it looks, and there's almost no carbonation to speak of- Nothing that particularly stands out about the style. Nothing unpleasant either though. There's no astringency that I can tell, and I'd say that's impressive for something this strong, bottled so recently.  O: In summation, this beer absolutely lives up to the hype. It may not be my perfect beer, but it's damn close... The Smell is the pinnacle of this beers showcase, while it's appearance and mouth-feel leave something to be desired. It was definitely a good purchase, and I look forward to the next bottle.

Served in a pint glass.  Smell is not strong- a hint of caramel/bourbon evenly blended with some dark roasted malt and a little booze. Nothing to blow you over.  Taste is far more interesting. Sweet bourbon taste, some roasted malts (coffee, a little milk chocolate). This is pretty sweet. Not really a noticeable hop presence but it must be there because the sweetness isnt out of control.  Mouthfeel is pretty nice- full bodied, light carbonation, a little chewy. This is one I've heard about so I had to try it. Worth a try, perhaps not a second.  Update: I've aged a few bottles of the 2012 variety and just had one- sickeningly sweet, cloying mouthfeel. Still not a fan; don't understand the hype.

1549,10672,macher0,4.96,"2012 bottle. Enjoyed to get ready for the new batch.  Preface: I believe nothing can be perfect, but this is dang close.  A. Extremely dark brown, almost black. Poured a finger amber head of fine bubbles that rapidly retreat to a rim of similar color and consistency. A very viscous texture and leaves an amber layer on the edges of the glass when swirled.  S. At first a layer of dark roasted malts, coco, bourbon, coffee malts, bourbon, boozey-soaked oak, and tannins. Slight roasted - not burnt - note. As it opens, sweeter notes of vanilla, toffee, coconut and a high level of booze. The booze increases as it opens - in a pleasant way.  T. Strong notes of bourbon, coffee, coco, and roasted malts. Moderate notes of boozey oak and tannins. Hints of vanilla, hazelnuts, and toffee. As this ale opens, the bourbon and roasted malt notes dominate the other notes.  M. Extremely smooth but a moderate waft of booze comes through as you finish a sip. Low carbonation. Full bodied. Thick. The booze finish becomes slightly harsh as the ale gets close to room temperature.  O. Almost perfect. This ale is great. I let this stand at room temperature from the fridge for about 20 minutes - which was very difficult as I am not a patient person. I savored this ale for almost and hour. The beer changed smell, taste, and feel profiles as it opens and warms. I would go to great lengths for this particular beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,blackcoyote13,4.34,"2012 bottling year of Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout. This beer has a bit of a cult following but is getting easier to find nowadays. I've had it on tap and thought it was a bit too boozy for my tastes so I was curious to see what a year would do for the bottled variety. The smell is the best part about this beer when you pour it out. Black as night and a minimal amount of toffee colored head which quickly dissipates. The sweet bourbon and chocolate aroma is amazing. Initial sip starts with rich, almost milk chocolate with a tinge of booze. Much better than the alcohol smash of having a fresh glass. Then comes the problem, the beer is simply too darn sweet. The mid-taste profile of this beer is complex for sure with chocolate, vanilla, coconut hints and LOTS of bourbon which I love, but darn is it sugary too. It reminds me almost of the sweet tooth smack of a vintage port wine. It's not undesirable, but just really unbalanced in what is otherwise a really darn good brew. Overall, a 4.5 and a very good beer that is worth seeking out, but I hope you have that sweet tooth!

1549,10672,DrinkNewport,4.93,"Bourbon County isn't really a beer so much as it is a recruitment tool for the craft beer movement.  There is nothing like giving a 6oz pour to a beer newbie and seeing the expression on their face when they taste a SERIOUS beer for the first time. The complexity and intensity experienced when Bourbon County enters your mouth rivals that of any wine or liquor, and you have no choice but to savor it.  The great thing about Bourbon County is that it was an intense beer before it was barrel-aged, so the bourbon flavor is an added benefit rather than an outsider trying to wrestle control.  WARNING: This beer will ruin most other imperial stouts for you. The only other stout that I've found that competes is the slightly-superior Dogfish Head World Wide Stout.

The nutty aroma morphs into an oak aroma- from the barrels.  The taste is very complex chocolate- it's more layered than the fresh bottle. There is a nutty taste, which is also more pronounced when fresh.  The Bourbon alcohol finish kicks in with warming. There is a liqueur consistency which is slightly stronger than the fresh tasting.  A great beer-fresh or cellared.  *** Fresh review  It's time. Got another bottle in the cellar.  2012: Poured a deep, opaque chocolate brown with virtually no head.  Very strong Bourbon, alcohol, and a nutty flavor wafted from the head. It's intense already!  The mouth feel was relatively smooth, like the other elements of the beer. It may be a high ABV Imperial stout with pronounced aroma and flavor- but it's smooth- no harshness to this baby.  The aroma carries to the taste- slightly different. Incredibly intense Bourbon and alcohol- smooth but intense- some fruit and nuts.  This beer tastes like a liqueur- highly alcoholic & smooth. Rounded intensity.

Two finger thick head is the color of coffee and cream. Head dissipates after a minute or two leaving only a thin top.  Powerful aroma, filled with notes of vanilla, soy sauce, metallic, oak, bourbon. Smells quite alcoholic.  Wow, this is very full bodied. Huge flavor. The body is soft and smooth as cream. Flavors of deeply roasted grains, cherry cordial, sweet caramel, and bourbon soaked oak chips. This beer is amazing the way that it balances the massive body with just enough bitterness and booze. Long lasting aftertaste leaves the mouth with lingering notes of bourbon goodness and charred oak.  Isn't hard to see why this is one of the highest rated beers in the world. It's massively flavorful and integrates the bourbon with the big ass stout in a perfect way. The carbonation is flawless and helps to create a creamy texture, giving an ideal mouthfeel for a big stout like this one.

S: Big alcohol nose here, with whiskey and dark fruit coming in behind the booze.  T: With the first sip I immediately thought of it as whiskey-dipped fig and chocolate cake. I think that pretty much describes it. Dark fruits and chocolate blend pretty well and the bourbon flavors come in later. Pretty big alcohol even with the age on it. Aftertaste is dark fruit and low end whiskey. The chocolate becomes lost with further sipping.  M: Very thick and smooth. Excellent feel.  O: I like BCBS, but I don't love it. Flavors are nicely blended, but there isn't a lot of complexity. I prefer this aged bottle over my first one, which I had fresh. I'll probably let my last bottle keep aging and see if it merits purchase again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Sweet mocha taste that follows bourbon nicely and works beautifully.  T. Bourbon hits you right away. Once that passes the coffee takes over. The flavor is fantastic but strong.  M. Very full.

1549,10672,greenmtn1111,4.63,"Bottled 11/07/2012. Poured in to a tulip style glass.  Pours out thick and black like crude oil. There’s hardly any head, but the small amount that’s visible is a nice tan color. Lots of bourbon on the nose, milk chocolate, leather and booze. Very sweet and warming on the palate. There’s more bourbon, along with chocolate, coffee, leather, cabernet sauvignon grapes, prunes, and black currants…amazingly complex. Smooth and ridiculously creamy in the mouth, this drinks dangerously easy for its ABV. There’s a slight bitterness and also an interesting acidic quality that make all the flavors work together really well. Overall, I’m impressed by the depth and deliciousness of this stout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Nugganooch,4.57,"Review #400 – Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout  Notes are a compilation of recent 2009 and 2012 samples - Received in trade from brooklynbrews – supreme thanks man!  12oz bottle with my FW snifter glass  A: Looks jet black in the glass with a slight browning towards the edge and a very short lived dark khaki head. Bubbles are lively and visibly streaming yet they struggle to retain any type of cap. The older version had produced virtually no head at all. Just a few minor dots of lace here and there noted.  S: Smells of roast coffee bean and dark malted syrups up front. Firm sweetness of molasses and toasted brown sugars mixed in with some vanilla oak, dark fruits, and bourbon aromas. There is a hint of alcohol spirit coming through in the nose and a touch of earthy black licorice on the back end. Very intoxicating with complex layers coming across. The ’09 version has calmed a bit with more of the black licorice coming through while still maintaining a nice vanilla bourbon barreling presence.  T: Tastes of sweet dark roasted malts highlighted with rich chocolates, molasses, dark fruits, bourbon vanilla, and some charred oak character. There is a bit of coconut marshmallow crème that is just a delight and a hit of brewers licorice as well. Adds a sort of earth and woodsy element to the brew. I am finding there to be a moderately higher level of hop bitterness to the beer and the alcohol has somewhat of a boozy sting to it. Manageable however at 15% ABV. The heat has mellowed considerably in the 2009 version offering up just a delicious bourbon cream soda flavor with loads of silky chocolate and toasted coconut character. A delicious blend of flavors all together with considerable balance. World class stuff!  M: Full bodied brew with a spritzy carbonation giving the perception of something lighter and thinner in mouthful. Creamy froth like texture with a light constricting bitterness and present alcohol warmth. Finish has a coat of syrupy slick after. Time has smoothed this one out quite a bit as the carbonation has dropped considerably to the point of approaching flatness.  D: Amazingly complex and simply delicious. This beer is undoubtedly special. One of the best barrel aged stouts I have yet to encounter. I would say after trying the ’09 it is reaching a point of diminishing returns based on the carbonation however the flavors have held up exceptionally well.  Glad I have a few more of these to sock away.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bark,3.98,"Vintage 2012.  The colour is dark brown, almost black (90 EBC), the liquid is clear. It pours very smooth and silently. Almost no head, just a few brown bubbles. No lacing.  The smell is rich and smooth. Sweet notes of raisins and figs. Some alcohol, but at 15 % is is much less pronounced than expected. Flavours of mature whiskey, caramel and dark chocolate. Hints of tobacco and dark rum.  The taste is intensive. Lots of dark chocolate, dark rum and toffee. Coffee with sugar and some cream. Bourbon whiskey, liquor filled truffles and crème brûlée. Full body, if there ever was one beer with that. The aftertaste got passing very hot alcohol. Then, it gets sweeter with notes of dark rum, bourbon, molasses, dried figs and a touch of smoke. The finish is quite short with alcohol, dried fruits and coffee with whipped cream.  The carbonation is mild; the few small bubbles are fresh. The liquid is thick and sticky, almost like drinking syrup.  Yes, it is a very elegant and smooth beer with lots of deep flavours. But the hype fooled me, or is it just that barrel aged imperial stouts have got even heavier and more complex during the years? Still, a great dessert beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,joe1510,4.56,"12oz Bottle $19.99 4-Pack Sam's Marcey  2007 Bottling 13%  The '07 Bourbon County Stout pours black as a moonless night. Not a shred of light can fight its way through the blackness. An aggressive pour yields only a small crown of tan foam which is to be expected with the massive abv. The head settles to a ring and leaves patches of lace after each sip.  As you take your first whiff you're hit with a big dose of vanilla from the barrel aging. Traces of bourbon come next followed by a mellow oakiness. The barrel aging runs throughout but is greeted and embraced by a big roastiness, caramel maltiness, and a smattering of dark fruit. There's even a ghost-like smokiness floating around in there.  There is a great stout in here but the barrel aging makes it world class. All the qualities from the aroma are right here in the flavor with the bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of woodiness working throughout. If this beer was aged any longer the bourbon would overpower everything else, if it was aged any less the bourbon wouldn't have been able to stand up to such a big robust stout. This is a slice of heaven in a glass.  The mouthfeel is thick and rich but exquisitely smooth. The carbonation is on the sluggish side which lets this silky body glide through slowly and coats every taste bud. The alcohol warms the throat on the swallow.  I can't give a stout this big abv wise a perfect score for drinkability but this is as close as it could get. This is a slow sipper without a doubt but one to sip and savor all night long.  One of my favorites from Goose Island and one of my favorite stouts period. The barrel aging sets this beer apart from the other great stouts. Bourbon County Stout is absolutely delicious.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Ljudsignal,4.56,"12oz 2012 bottle poured into a wine glass. Date on the bottle is smudged, but I think it reads 8/26/12.  A: Pours jet-black with a thin mocha head that dissipates quickly, leaving a tiny but stubborn ring of bubbles around the rim. Plentiful, wispy lacing with even slight movement of the glass.  S: ...hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here, but the initial nose is, well, pretty mediocre. Lots of boozy bourbon, with maybe some subtle coconut notes. The coconut becomes more pronounced as the beer warms, though, and notes of semisweet chocolate and espresso emerge alongside it. Definite improvement in the nose as the beer approaches room temperature.  T: Oh man. Oh MAN. A powerful wallop of bourbon right up front, with strong notes of aged oak and vanilla, that fades into a complex medley of other flavors--black liquorice, coffee, molasses, toffee, and chocolate all mingle together into a spectacular whole. Sweet and creamy for most of the mouthful, the bourbon announces itself again at the end with a touch of its signature burn and some lingering notes of espresso bitterness.  M: Thick and lip-coatingly creamy, with just enough carbonation to prevent the beer from being overpoweringly heavy-bodied. Still easily the most full-bodied beer I've ever had--warming and robust, with the 15% ABV announcing itself throughout.  O: I have to admit, when I first took a whiff of BCBS I was a little hesitant. After all the hype surrounding this beer, I was all too ready to expect disappointment somehow, and the initial nose did not give me confidence. I can happily report, however, that I was DEAD wrong, and delighted to have been so. A rich, robust beast of a beer that I would confidently put forward as a paragon of the BBA stout family. Not a light drinker, not a terribly easy drinker, not a sessionable beer in the least...but for what it is, it's simply spectacular.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RyanCave,4.93,"A: Pitch black with a thin creme brulee colored head that quickly dissipates. When agitated you get thin whispy clouds of head floating in the beer. Very rich and thick with great lacing  N: Coconut! as it breaths you start getting more coffee as well, a bit boozy, Brandy, dark chocolate after it sits for a while  T: some heat from booze, lots of coconut, coffee, not dry at all which you'd expect from bourbon barrels, toffee, some caramel, finishes boozy  M: sticky, thick, rich, lingering  O: This has to be one of the most incredible Imp Stout's I've ever had.

1549,10672,Converge,4.48,"12oz bottle into a tulip. 2012 bottle.  A - Hard pour yields minimal dark-tan/brown head, that seems rather effervescent for the style. Black as night in the glass. No head retention other than a thin dark ring around the glass. Also, one of the nicest labels in craft beer.  S - Immediately I can't decide if this smells more like bourbon or more like beer to my untrained nose. Aroma is all bourbon upfront, with big notes of oak, vanilla and a slight booziness. A base of roasted malt with some coffee and dark fruits is present but certainly secondary to the big bourbon quality. Lots of sweetness, with a touch of molasses as well as black cavendish. Not very astringent, with minimal hop presence. Respectably complex, but certainly geared towards the bourbon.  T - Huge bourbon qualities dominate the flavor profile. Oak barrel, bourbon vanilla, and the full force of the 15.00% ABV are immediately made known. Charred malt and molasses are detectable, and a lot of sweetness as well. Some earthy hops, bitter cocoa, black cavendish, and a whole lot of alcohol in the finish. To me this goes beyond ""boozy warmth"" or ""slight heat"", this is just a alcoholic burn in the finish, which kinda bums me out. The flavor is big, there's no denying that, but I can find this much flavor and more with much less ABV. That being said this is still great, and packs a huge wallop of flavor, and if you're looking for huge bourbon character in your beer, look no further.  M - Thick and quite creamy. Carbonation is lively but smooth. Sticky as can be on the lips, and the finish burns with booze. Par the course for a big stout, but nothing out of the ordinary.  D - A huge stout, that delivers and then some on the promise of bourbon flavor. But the substantial boozy heat and somewhat straight forward flavor doesn't quite do it for me. Maybe my expectations are too high coming into these reviews for big stouts, but I find them to sometimes be overly boozy and offer a one-dimensional barrel aged character. I taste bourbon and booze, but not a whole lot else, and they certainly don't offer a great deal of complexity. If I wanted a bourbon I'd have a bourbon. But, that being said, this is superb beer and to me pushes the envelope for how far craft beer, especially big stouts, can be taken. But if I had the chance to drink this everyday would I go for it? Probably not. Too much alcohol and residual sweetness for me. A late-night sipper but I certainly couldn't drink this often, and there's no way I could have more than one. A great beer, but as silly as it might sound, I'd take an Old Raspy over this 9 times outta 10.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is a combination of malt, chocolate, bourbon and a little hint of vanilla. Taste is a great balance of flavor, masking the 15% alcohol content.

1549,10672,utopiajane,4.47,"Bottle says 2012.  Poured thick and without any head. I get a thin ring when I tilt the glass and some alcohol legs. Nose is oaky, boozy, bourbon whiskey, smooth dark chocolate and some vanilla. Roasted malt and a bit of coffee. Tiny bit of dark fruit but I am actually glad that it's not too pruney with all the bourbon barrel qualities.  One very small sip to start and it's beer heaven. This a smooth roasted malt, deep full and rich like hot melted caramel. The bourbon is luscious and because it's hot from the alcohol has a sweet warmth. Dark creamy chocolate, buttery toffee, oak flavor and just a touch of raisin,prune and fig. it reminds me of english butter toffee candy that's coated with nuts and chocolate. It lingers like whiskey with a little burn at 15% abv and is full and smooth.  Thick and rich, creamy and decadent. This is no lightweight stout.

1549,10672,SeanBond,4.66,"Re-review of the 2014 version (13.8% ABV):  BCBS has never really been about the smell, in my opinion; there's some stuff going on there, of course, but you get a lot of bourbon heat on the nose, which takes it down a notch for me. The fun is really when you get into everything else.  The beer pours like typical BCBS--Very thick, with only a little head (but what's there is a delightful coffee-brown color). Typical syrupy goodness, nothing new here.  However, the taste is different. Still BCBS? Sure. But this year, possibly due to the infamous Polar Vortex's influence on the barrel-aging process (the warehouse was too cold to use as normal, so GI had to keep heaters on the barrels, apparently), the beer is slightly more mellow than normal, and you get more vanilla on the tongue. Really impressive, and definitely my favorite version of the regular, to date.  This is typical BCBS; lots of bourbon, mouthfeel is thick as always, but the beer itself is a little more refined than normal. Great stuff here, and definitely worthy of the work it takes to land it. This is probably the first and last thing I'll thank the Polar Vortex for.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,afrokaze,4.55,"2013 bottle, pored into a glass you've never hear of.  Pours almost black, with dark brown edges. Modest finger of dense tan head sticks around for a good while.  Good lord, once it warms it smells like a artery clogging dessert; marshmallow, dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, wood spice, tobacco, molasses and some heat to back it up.  Once again, it really reminds me of chocolate cake batter, with a sticky sweetness and then vanilla, oaky coconut, toffee, burnt sugars, nutty, and a good amount of honey and slightly citrusy sweetness that reminds me of a wheat heavy bourbon. Great layers and just a bit of roasty char on the back end.  Full bodied, slightly sticky but not very slick, somewhat like dark syrup. Lots of that nice oily feel from the barrel at first, then the tannins show up in the finish.  I popped this as a celebration of my first day as a brewer! It lived up to my expectations and was a very satisfying nightcap.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The first thing noticed is straight barrel juice; whiskey with charred oaky barrel with notes of sweet vanilla. Beyond the barrel aroma, dark prune and fig appears with a touch of raw dark chocolate and melted caramel. I can smell this one from a foot away  T- bourbon flavors up front are in your face with juicy barrel flavors, charred oak and vanilla. Semi-dry chocolate comes through mid-palate with toffee and caramel notes. The finish transitions into dark fruity notes of raisin, fig, and prune juice. Dark fruit carries over to the linger with notes of soy sauce and barrel flavor that sits on the palate long after drinking  M- medium-heavy body with low carbonation and a foamy mouthfeel. The finish is smooth, with a big boozy alcohol burn.  O- this beer is big, boozy and packed with bourbon flavors. It's definitely a bourbon drinkers beer, which plays well with my palate. Most bourbon barrel stouts taste like an imperial stout with bourbon notes, this is the opposite, the bourbon flavors take center stage. The only thing that kept this from a 5 own taste is the lingering soy sauce flavor in the finish.

LOTS of warming but the alcohol is not overpowering although very clearly present. Very good but I may not have the palette to discern all the more subtle complexities.

1549,10672,BillRoth,4.76,"Update: Drank a cellared 2009 on 11/5/2022. All the flavors remain. If anything a touch more toward old ale/ dried dark fruit. Also there seemed more bitter chocolate in the fudginess. The original barreling in 12yo Elijah Craig barrels remains excellent. Fabulous. The 2009 is 13% and while I didn’t expect any head; the edges of glass have a nice tan halo and glass has quite a bit of residual lacing. Impressed. Nicely surprising is the body remains full and soft; velvety if only a bit bright to the tongue initially as the beer moves a bit warmer and a gets a touch of aeration. Otherwise earlier comments and ratings still hold true. Had considered that beer had peaked earlier, but instead was rewarded with a gentler beer that had even more complexity of flavor. Original review: Been drinking this for years (2009-2017) and thought time to comment. Pretty reliable... one off year/ off bottle. But consistently amazingly complex with malts , hops and barrel. Cold or warm... beer is resplendent with turns of deep stout maltiness; lroasty toasty; Vanilla and caramel; dryness to offset sweetness; black and ruby accents. Fairly lovely head that disappears and doesn’t leave much lacing. Hides the huge ABV and for my taste is as perfect a medium smooth and velvet mouthfeel as you would ever get. For me this is the role model for balance and equity at high altitudes. The fact that they do it every year is a real accomplishment and really deserves the name craft beer as an accolade... not a type of business.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell: Lots of bourbon tang, chocolate, alcohol, molasses, more alcohol, faint roasted coffee, and even some vanilla.  Taste: The alcohol is still there (and potent), but the depth of the malty, chocolate and caramel flavors really shine through and to some degree, steal the show from the bourbon and alcohol. Indeed, the bourbon is there and it almost makes the heat completely acceptable. A good bit of residual sweetness, but masked by a firm bitterness and alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Not quite as thick, or chewy as a lot of RIS's are. The bourbon and alcohol almost thin it out slightly. Bitterness lingers into the aftertaste.

Smell: Bourbon, still big and bold, draped over a base of coffee and chocolate, oaky vanilla is also present.  Taste: Bourbon, chocolate, toffee, coffee, some vanilla too, and yes maybe a faint hint of licorice. This beer has it all, a big bourbon flavor bomb in a very good way.  Mouth feel: Smooth and creamy and warming.  Overall: Just a really nice BA Stout with so much flavor that the ABV is only noticeable by the warmth in the finish.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,pjkelley82,4.94,"Enjoyed at a Goose Island tasting at a local beer distributor.  Poured from tap into a plastic tasting cup. Year 2012  I purchased 4 12oz bottles a month prior so I can age them. Wanted to try It without opening up one of my bottles.  I'm not gonna go into specifics about appearance, mouthfeel and taste as most of the full reviews hit it dead on.  Basically, I had a feeling what the best Bourbon barrel beer should taste like and BCS was that one.... it had everything rolled into one without being overpowering in any aspect. It was a perfect balance between taste smoothness and alcohol... you really can't tell it's 15% alcohol... tastes like 7%-8%... no nasty aftertaste just perfection.  This is a beer you do not bring as a everyday beer to drink with your friends. This is a beer you hoard and save it for a special occasion. It's a sipper. It's also a beer that is world class and rightfully so... way better than KBS. I know.. there 2 different kinds of beers but just saying.. the best beer I've EVER had..  Edit: I forgot to mention at the tasting they had cheese there as well. They paired the stout with a blue cheese that mended just perfectly.  Edit2: review for 2013 and 2012 drank on black friday 2013...  This years batch seemed to have a better bourbon smell with it way up front.. I remember last years not being AS strong.. mouthfeel seems better this year and smell is way better than I remember fresh 2012... overall I liked 2012 better because it was slightly sweeter but this years taste phenomenal as usual....  2012...drank a year old version.... smell was extremely fruity and instantly I got angry because I only have 2 2012 left and im saving them for a vertical... the smell was so perfect, instantly a 5.. Dark fruits galore and the bourbon has taken a back seat... still alcohol presence but nothing offputting... creamy heavy mouthfeel but non cloying... I give the 2012 vintage with a year on it a better score than the fresh... imo just better with a year on it... well see about 2+...next year  Edit 3- enjoyed 2013 version on 8/28/14. . Simply divine. A spectacular beer. Creamy, huge bourbon and chocolate. Mostly wrote this to urge everyone who smokes cigars or likes a cigar every now and again to drink this beer with a good cigar. It just simply makes both the beer and cigar better. I am surprised I waited this long to try this pairing. One of the best beers ever made.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,REVZEB,4.75,"Had on tap and in bottle year after year. And frankly, year after year it is one of the best beers I have. Perhaps my score is slightly inflated compared to the myriad of wonderful ba stouts out there, but this the one that started it all, the beer that really brought me into the fold of craft beer forever. It’s effect on the beer world cannot be overstated. The bourbon melding with the chocolate, vanilla, licorice, dark fruits, wood, leather, and that beautiful malt, combine to make a trademark taste by which all are now judged. The smell is transcendent in the rich balance. The feel, smooth as silk, yet heavy with flavor, invites the drinker to sip and enjoy every last drop.

1549,10672,Jacurdy60,4.47,"Received in a trade from Florida9. Very grateful. Freshness date reads 11/07/12. Poured from the bottle into a snifter.  A-Pours a thick black, motor oil-esque liquid. Opaque, impermeable, blacker than Satan's butthole. Absolutely lovely. Medium width copper colored head that retains well. Very thick but leaves little lacing.  S-A bit phenolic. The booze is definitely present but it's not overwhelming. Notes of vanilla and charred oak are in the back of the nose. I'm also picking up on some dark fruits as well, however it's very faint.  T-Bourbon flavor hits you in the face at the front of the palate as does the alcohol, but I like it. A lot. As I swallow, the bourbon boozy flavor fades into a subtle vanilla flavor with a bit of zesty spiced dark fruit. I'm not getting any coffee notes in this stout which is unusual.  MF-Creamy, thick, smooth, chewy, fantastic. One of the better feels on a brew I've ever experienced. It's very thick, but the booziness in the back of the finish makes it a bit dry  O-A world-class brew, as al the other reviews show. Balanced to perfection. Complex as hell. Tastes good. Smells like heaven. Has a great feel. I love this beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,weltywm,4.75,"Bottled in September, 2012. Poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Looks like used motor oil: jet black and very thick. Little to no head.  Smell: Wow. There is so much going on. Bourbon, vanilla, molasses, oak, and just a touch of hop bitterness. Can't wait to try a sip.  Taste: It follows the smell, but expands in every way. There is tons of bourbon, charred wood, molasses, bitter chocolate, and some boozy alcohol, though the ABV is fairly hidden. As I keep sipping, I taste plums and dates, in addition to more alcohol, char, vanilla, and bourbon. Despite the complexity, it is super balanced, with each flavor complementing each other.  Mouthfeel: Super thick and oily, with little carbonation. The finish is extra long, culminating in charred oak, hop bitterness,and yes, even more bourbon. It's good.  Overall: I know Goose Island isn't technically ""craft"" anymore, but if this isn't craft beer at its finest, I don't know what is. This is an amazing, huge beer with incredibly complexity and balance. Buy it. It's good.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,LambicPentameter,4.6,"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a 16 oz pint glass. Got it from a local restaurant, so I didn't get a chance to inspect the bottle for a bottling or freshness date.  Appearance - A rich opaque black color that looks like cola. Chocolate colored foam appears about a half-finger thick before quickly dissipating, also similar to cola. I think the lack of head is pretty common for barrel-aged beers.  Smell - Notes of oak, bourbon and semi-sweet chocolate. Roasted malt and some play of dark, dried fruits, like raisins and dates.  Taste - Very heavy booze flavor, so I'm going to take a guess that this is a pretty recently-bottled batch. More whiskey and bittersweet chocolate. Burnt caramel and malt with a lingering, sweet finish.  Mouthfeel - Silky and smooth, with low carbonation and a medium body. Somehow manages to be rich without being chewy.  Overall a highly complex beer that lingers with you. Definitely a sipping beer, because at 15% abv, it will knock you back a notch or ten. I'd be curious to taste it with some more age and see how it mellows out.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TomTown,4.8,Poured from a 12 oz bottle into (2) Teku Glasses  Completely black with a very thin but very dark brown head.  Smelled of rich chocolate and alcohol with a great oaky bourbon character.  Taste followed smell with an incredibly long finish. Lots more chocolate and coffee with a the bourbon flavor extending past a full minute after the sip.  Mouthfeel was likely the best part of the beer with it's palate coating ability that lingers for a long time.  Outstanding.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,AltBock,4.55,"12oz. bottle with a simple dark chocolate brown label. Smack dab in the middle is the name of the beer in big bold white letters with gold inlay. Above the name is a vintage year and below the name is a barrel and the ABV%. The black back label contains all the mandatory US info, proper serving glassware, and a bottled date and possible bottle number. This bottle was from 9/20/12 and 2101.  When poured into a Peg's Cantina Snifter, this barrel aged beer was a black beauty. Saying that this beer poured a pitch dark would be an under statement. It looks like I found this beer in an Alaskan oil field. Highlights? No way! This beer was so black and thick that our mighty sun would have trouble penetrating this beer with a powerful ray of light. I wasn't expecting much of a head of foam on this powerful beer and that's exactly what I got. I received a minimal beige head of foam. When I say minimal, I mean a few beige bubbles popped up and quickly faded away. I did see a tiny beige string of rings along the edge. This black ass appearance is a force to be reckoned with.  There's a lot going on in this aroma. I'm going to try to find a starting point. OK...let's start off with the beer's thick roasted malts aroma. Following the malts was a lot of dark chocolate, charred oak, roasted coffee beans, caramel, bourbon, roasted nuts, and dark fruits. These dark fruits consisted of rum raisins, plum, and black cherry. Following all of this was alcohol and a subtle whiff of vanilla. Everything except for the vanilla was in large amounts. This aroma loved the go big or go home theory.  You'd think a 15% ABV barrel aged stout would be overly boozy, but it really wasn't. Oh there was plenty of hot booze in the taste, but there was also plenty of flavor in this beer as well. Kicking off this barrel aged stout was the roasted coffee beans. Quickly following the coffee beans was the boozy roasted flavor punch that consisted of roasted malt, dark chocolate, bourbon, caramel, black cherry, charred oak, and roasted nuts. After this flavor punch, in comes a dry bitter taste and a pinch of vanilla. A full flavored beer!  This was a full bodied beer (that's no surprise) with low carbonation and a full flavored aftertaste. This aftertaste was boozy, but like the taste, there was plenty of flavor to counter all the booze. The aftertaste had more roasted coffee beans, roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, bourbon, charred oak, and black cherry. This beer didn't want to mess around. It showed its high proof percentage. This beer is a sipper. Take your time. It's not going anywhere.  Wow!! This is one really good bourbon barrel aged stout. I can see why it's a top beer on BA. This beer was packing in the flavor as well as the alcohol. I forgot who I traded to get this beer. OOPS! I would like to see what age will do to this beer....if it will last that long. I doubt father time will calm down the alcohol.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BBP,4.05,"2009 vintage.  Pours pitch black with minimal head.  The aroma is a blast of bourbon. A bit of stout roastiness seeps through.  The flavor is perhaps the most blended hybrid of stout and bourbon. The more I drink, the more the base beer comes through. I imagine this would be superb fresh. At this age it's remarkably smooth, but I feel like it showcases the bourbon more than the base beer.  The beer is thick despite its age. The finish is very dry and sticky.  Overall this was a very smooth and remarkably balanced beer. I'd love to try the variants or to try this fresh. Right now it has become seamless, and while balanced, I would love a bit more character.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Mikecap,4.43,"Appearance: Poured a deep, deep brown, nearly black into a 12 oz Allagash tulip. Short tannish head that stuck around for most of the glass. Lacing along the sides of the glass was present throughout.  Smell: Strong! Bourbon, chocolate, and caramel malts competing at the forefront here. Very sweet smell that is absolutely lovely.  Taste: Very heavy and some chocolate and caramel sweetness at play here. Very smooth but the alcohol is certainly present and this is certainly a sipper. Gets better as it warms up as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied without too much carbonation and relatively smooth for the amount of alcohol at play. Very creamy and sweet but again the alcohol is clearly present but not extremely overpowering.  Overall: This is my second time giving this a go and I am glad I did. My first experience left me thinking this beer was overhyped, but having it again was great. By far one of the best stouts I have had, but not quite on the level of Parabola. I would love to have this again, especially with some age on it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kylelenk,4.47,"Appearance - Extremely dark, nothing unexpected from a big stout. Head vanishes quickly.  Smell - BIG bourbon notes up front that mute out a slightly fruity smell that mixes well which the chocolate.  Taste - Hot when fresh, best with a little age one it. Vanilla and Oak notes begin to come out in force after about 6 mos.  Mouthfeel - Most disappointing aspect of the beer. BCBS is a very thin stout to me as I tend to like heavier, maltier, more viscous brews. It's easy to drink if you let it warm up but fresh will be hot.  Overall - IMO, there are better bourbon aged beers out there. Where BCBS shines is that it is getting quite available for the type of beer it is.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,scottmichaelland,4.81,"Appearance - Black as night. Brown head that dissipated extremely quickly. I drank it around 45 degrees, so a decent temp, but the high alcohol content is not going to hold head around very long. Just a super dark stout.  Smell - Best beer I've ever smelt. Hints of dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, coffee - just incredible. I almost feel like I could sit there for an hour and not pick out every smell in this thing.  Taste - Just wow. You taste everything you pick up in the smell, so that will tell you how complex this is. There's an aftertaste (breathing out), of this dark chocolate/bourbon/fruit mix that is just the best thing I ever have tasted in a beer, it's almost inexplicable. You have to try this beer if you haven't already. It's a bit strong, and that comes through. Easier to drink than a ""World Wide Stout"", but it's still a sipper. I'd split this with someone unless you have a decent tolerance.  Mouthfeel - Not as thick as you think in the beginning, but as it warms it gets thicker and super sticky. Good mouth-feel for the style. Definitely coats as it warms, which is the way it should be. Small carbonation, but obviously with the high alcohol content it's not going to be like a Pilsner.  Overall - Probably the best beer I have ever tried, and without a doubt the best Imperial Stout I've tried. You need to get one if you have the chance. I bought 2 and was thinking about aging one, so we'll see how that goes. They say you can age it for up to 5 years and it will develop.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,MaltyMates,4.7,"Grabbed a couple bottle of this at my local supermarket . I decided to split the bottle with my wife and was served from a glass.  Color: DARK - the color is as black as you can be as it should for this style.  Smell: The bourbon smell is apparent from the second you open the bottle, over the smell of the beer.  Taste: The taste is more balanced than the smell suggests and the bourbon becomes more of an afterthought. It is thick and the stout leans to the malty side.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a thick mouthfeel. The alcohol is there, but is much more masked then you would believe.  Overall a great beer - best paired with desserts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kevanb,4.59,"12oz bottle, 2012 dated, poured into a Goose Island Bourbon County snifter.  The beer pours a deep, jet black color, touches of cola brown when struck by the light with a short, tightly packed caramel colored head that vanishes almost immediately that leaves no lace behind. The aroma is lovely, strong oaky bourbon, rich chocolate, light roasted coffee and barrel char and potent alcohol with some stone fruit and marshmallow character. On the tongue, rich toffee and bourbon creep out ever so smoothly before vanilla, thick chocolate and chewy oak captivate the palate. Alcohol, pitted fruit, marshmallow and light coffee roast tickle the tongue at the finish. The body is so velvety and smooth, low carbonation, but just enough to prop up the flavors and coat the mouth perfectly. The finish is so silky and easy and has a nice warming sensation as it goes down.  Verdict: There is a reason why this is the benchmark for all bourbon barrel aged stouts. It has such depth of flavor and wonderful balance and the alcohol, while prominent is so tame for hovering around 15.00%. This really is a beer that holds its own against any competitor in the style.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T - Lots of bourbon up front backed by good roasty flavors, coffee, chocolatte etc. Decent amount of alcohol burn, but with all the bourbon flavor this doesn't really seem like a bad thing.  M - thick and smooth mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation  O - Fantastic beer, really enjoyed this one, and at 15% enjoyed it slowly.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,douginromeo,4.49,"Thanks to Wehler for the generous birthday present! Bottled 9/26/12 - poured aggressively into a snifter.  Appearance - Initial head is lighter than I thought it would be and dissipated quickly to nothing. Black as night with little to no light able to penetrate it; leaves no lacing on the glass whatsoever. It's a very impressive looking beer.  Smell - Sweet booziness pleasantly warms the nose, followed by hints of vanilla, bourbon, licorice, and some toffee. Underneath it all is a full maltiness from the grain.  Taste - Warm, boozy, and pleasant. It doesn't hide its booziness; instead, it embraces it in the best possible way. It has a lot of bourbon, but it also counteracts that with a decent malty fullness that takes you to a sweet finish. In my opinion, it shows great restraint by not letting anything take over; instead, all elements play well together and compliment each other.  Mouthfeel - Thick, yet not as thick as I thought it would be. Tingles the tongue on the finish.  Overall - This is a great beer. It is done well, and it has characteristics that make it stand out from other BB aged stouts. I would love to cellar some to see how it develops and changes. I'll be seeking this out next time it's released.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,justforrazors,4.44,"2012 vintage consumed this evening. Poured into snifter glass.  A- Pours a jet black with a thick two-finger mocha head. It quickly recedes to a ring around the edge of the glass. Significant alcohol legs. Looks perfect for a beer of this style, very inviting.  S- Dominated by bourbon. There is some vanilla, roast malt, and a slight chocolate as well as coffee, but it is definitely minimal compared to the liquor aroma.  T- Up front there is more bourbon, vanilla, and some chocolate. As I swallow, there are some fruit esters, predominantly cherry with some fig, as well as a ton of alcohol. The finish is quite long, and the bitterness becomes present to help balance out the syrupy sweetness of the malts and bourbon.  M- This is a thick and viscous beer, almost syrup in consistency. Although the feeling of the beer coats your mouth for some time, it is silky smooth. The only downfall I can note is the alcohol sting that you can feel almost immediately after you take a sip.  O- This is a fantastic beer, but I think the 2012 still needs a few more months for the bourbon to calm down.

1549,10672,Ahappyhiker2,4.2,"2011 vintage.  A- Pours black as expected, nice and thick. Small tan head.  S- Bourbon is the most prominent aroma, and there's a lot of vanilla from that. It's pretty sweet, and bitter at the same time. Dark chocolate comes out a lot, molasses, and coconut.  T- Sweet but not overbearing, lots of vanilla upfront, a little boozy but not much knowing that it's 14.5%. There is a lot of coffee and bitterness in the aftertaste. The flavors definitely have faded a bit over the years, this still drinks great but I prefer it fresh. It gets much smoother as it warms up.  M- BCBS and its variants always have a great mouthfeel. I like Dark Lord and Marshal Zhukov's better just because I love a chewy mouthfeel, but this is awesome.  O- This is always a treat, there's a reason BCBS is coveted year-round no matter what vintage because it's always great. Many people prefer this aged but I like it fresh. The main flavors of vanilla and bourbon are still there but it loses something, at least in my opinion. It's also a lot sweeter. If you've never had BCBS it is a must-have for a beer lover.

Vanilla and toffee flavors accent the bourbon in the finish, followed by a warm, boozy after taste.  M: Full bodied is an understatement! Low to medium carbonation. Small amount of heat from the alcohol.  Overall: The barrel characteristics are so nicely integrated into this beer. Neither the oak or the bourbon jump out at you, but instead add layers of subtle, delightful complexity. This is definitely one of if not my favorite BBA stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,backbaybrewer,4.42,"A: dark as night. Little to no head. What head there is dissipates vey quickly with little to no lace.  Ar: bourbon/alcohol in the forefront. Some chocolate and roasted malt.  T: fantastic! Amazing mix of alcohol without being overkill and roasted malts. Vanilla lingers with some wood.  M: thick, thick, thick. Leaves a feeling of film on the palate for minutes after each sip. Yet somehow it seems wonderful. Very low carbonation.  O: a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout. Doesn't fit neatly into any standard style but every sip screams imperial stout. Love it. But, at 15 percent ABV, drink two or three and you'll be hard pressed to differentiate it from a Gatorade.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,rboinski,4.6,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass  Appearance: Pours an extremely dark oily black with almost not head, which immediately becomes no head. The tiniest ring of lacing clings to the edge of the glass  Smell: Smells like good bourbon, dark chocolate, and maybe a little coffee but I am not picking up much.  Taste: The taste is wonderfully complex. It does not knock you over with the bourbon notes like Backwoods Bastard. Instead there is just enough bourbon complexity that it leaves a sensation in your mouth long after you finish the sip. Initial notes of chocolate and bourbon, which leads to a bourbon aftertaste, and finally lingering vanilla.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel on this is great. Perfect carbonation, nice viscosity. Just wish it was creamier.  Overall: Great bourbon aged beer. I wish I could get this easily and often!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JohnG190,4.69,"Pours inky black with no discernible head. Wispy tan cap with decent lacing. Aroma of vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate. The palate follows the aroma with big flavors of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, followed by some vanilla and coconut. Sweet with some warming from the ABV. Mouthfeel is rich and full with just a touch of carbonation. Overall this is still an incredibly well crafted stout that is every bit the equal of other, much harder to get imperial stouts. Outstanding.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bauzen,4.66,"Black as night, thick as oil.  Smell is amazing - It's all coffee and chocolate - hard to even call it ""beer.""  Flavor is creamy, smooth, and follows the aroma as you would expect.  Texture is what sets it apart. The thickness and light carbonation is buttery and heavy. You have to take your time drinking it and I, personally, enjoyed every sip.  The important question is... How does it stack up to KBS - well, it's a great substitute when KBS isn't available (which is essentially 11 months of the year), but I still prefer KBS as the flavors are brighter, and the ABV is a little more manageable. 15% is pretty ridiculous - almost comical.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Jonada,4.59,"12 bottle. 2012 vintage. Bottled on 9/20/2012. Served in a snifter  Appearance: Pours pitch black with less than a finger of a tan head that dissipates quickly to a thin collar. Body is completely opaque. Lots of alcohol legs sticking to the glass.  Smell: Bourbon, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, wood, and some dark fruit. Smells amazing.  Taste: Chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, butterscotch, caramel, toffee, vanilla.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, viscous mouthfeel. Carbonation on the lower end of medium. Noticeable alcohol warmth after the finish, but goes down stupidly smooth for 15%.  Overall: World class stuff. I love this beer",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ESPNman,4.79,"2010 Vintage, poured into a Stone IRS Snifter  I've been trying to track down some BCBS for a while now, and happened upon this bottle at a seedy corner liquor store in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. Apparently the owner's a bit of a beer fanatic that occasionally brings bottles out of his cellar to sell in his store.  A - Thick, motor oil-y jet black liquid that completely coats the glass. Tilting the glass and holding it up to the light still doesn't allow any light through this beast. Almost no head at all, and virtually no visible carbonation. This looks more like ink than beer.  S - Holy bourbon, Batman. Big sweet bourbon notes up front with some roasted chocolate right behind it. A bit of alcohol present, but only in the background. Sweet fruits and spicy bourbon show up as the beer warms more.  T - The taste really follows the smell pretty closely... this is a wonderfully balanced bourbon barrel-aged monster of a stout. Roasty malts, sweet bourbon, candied fruit, and a bit of alcohol bite on the finish. A hint of chocolate and tobacco present throughout, which really goes well with the bourbon's intensity on the palate.  M - Thick, chewy, heavy, and with a bit of carbonation. I was worried that the 2+ years of aging would have left this one completely flat, but there's still a bit of bubble in there that really helps open up an otherwise daunting brew. Finishes drier than I would expect, but still a heavy, sweet syrupy finish to this one.  O - This beer definitely has lived up to the hype in my opinion. It's right up there with Parabola and The Abyss for me. Bourbon, balance, sweetness, booze, and deliciousness. I'm excited to see how this beer stands up to another year of aging (I managed to snag 2 bottles).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,GreesyFizeek,4.78,"I've had this both on tap at MacGregor's Grill and Taproom in Webster, and out of the bottle. This review concerns the 12 oz bottle I poured into my Rooster Fish tulip. Pours the deepest black. Like staring into the abyss. Opaque. Sticks to the glass desperately. Who knew motor oil poured so well? Nice small head on tap.  The smell is incredible. Sweet bourbon up front, lots of chocolate. Just intense.  This is the most bourbon-heavy stout I've ever tasted. I don't even like bourbon, but I love this. It is integrated so well. Very, very sweet- the bourbon flavors of vanilla, oak, coconut, and biting alcohol, play together so well with the roasty chocolate flavors screaming out of this beer. The alcohol is present, and invited. If you don't feel warm after drinking this one, you're probably going to die because you don't have any circulation. Still drinks lighter than the 14% would suggest, I would've guessed 10-11%.  The mouthfeel is one of the big stars of this one. Coats your mouth like chocolate syrup. The beer is SO sticky, coats your mouth and the glass. An actual meal in a glass. Amazing.  A very hyped release, but for a good reason. Worth the struggle it takes to land this one every year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,schnarr84,4.97,"I dont even think i can do this beer justice. received in a trade with Skrip (thanks!!) 12 oz into snifter at about 50F.  Could smell the bourbon as soon as I cracked the bottle. so many sweet dark fruits on the nose. taste is roasted malts and pure amazingness overall. so complex and it is evolving as it warms up slightly. I could literally drink this beer in 3 drinks but im forcing myself to sip it over an hour to get the full effect. this is different as each sip goes on. i feel like if i never had another beer again in my life, i had the best there is and i could be happy with that.  the only thing i think that could be improved on this beer is a bit more head retention. that being said, i realize it doesnt have much because it is a 15% stout, but i had to find something it lacked... and if that was all it lacked, this beer certainly lived up to its hype.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CuBuffsaNut88,4.51,"Goose Island's barrel aged brews are always top notch and this is certainly no exception. Smells slightly boozy with a roasted chocolate aroma, a great balance. Pours dark black with a thin head that disappears into a dark colored collar. The taste is well balance. You can certainly taste the bourbon but it is no overwhelming, there is a lot going on in this glass that makes everything blend just right. It is heavy in the mouth but goes down smooth.

1549,10672,Kunstman,4.68,"Found 24 bottles (1/2 of them 2009 & 1/2 2010) for sale at a liquor store Friday before last. I nearly died of excitement! Certainly my greatest find yet. $156 later, I was a very happy man. Enjoying a 2010 (bottled 10/15/2010) served from bottle to pint glass.  A: Pours like oil from bottle with formation of a thin tan head with less retention than I would have expected. Let's say 74 degrees SRM. Almost no lacing.  S: Bourbon, alcohol and slight roastiness that is not overwhelming. The three play together very well.  T: Again, an EXCELLENT balance of bourbon and roasted malt with an alcohol bite that gives way to just a bit of that 'post shot' salivation. I had one of the 2009's I bought last week, but besides that, I have never had the pleasure of this beer before. However, I imagine that the 2 1/2 years of aging beyond the initial barrel aging helped to achieve the level of smoothness that I am currently experiencing. The sweetness of the malt and bourbon start it off and continue throughout while the tanginess of the alcohol and bourbon play the sides and back end of the palate. The aftertaste is slight bourbon. Taste is exactly what I was hoping for.  M: Solid, thick body that I would expect with from an Imperial Stout with just enough carbonation. Wonderful.  O: The best bourbon barrel aged Stout I have ever had.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Resuin,4.63,"Poured from a 355 mL bottle into a Teku Glass. This is a 2012 version and was bottled about 6 months ago as of this review.  Appearance: Pours a jet-black and leaves behind a finger of dark tan head. Nice looking stout.  Smell: Dark chocolate dominates in an excellent way. Also plums, raisins, figs, coffee, bourbon and some alcohol. Mouth watering aroma.  Taste: Chocolate up front with a very nice blend of bourbon and dark fruits adding complexity. Definitely some oak as well, followed by caramel and molasses. Really delicious and balanced. Some alcohol is definitely detectable and it only helps the flavor.  Mouth-feel: Medium to heavy bodied, light carbonation detected. Surprisingly smooth for the ABV and flavor profile.  Overall: This is a really great imperial stout, and it somehow manages to blend 15% alcohol in and make this one taste even better. The explosion of flavors, smooth mouth-feel and medium-heavy body contribute to make this a fantastic stout. I love this ""fresh"" and would be interested to try it with some age on it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JonaGold,4.85,"I was gifted a 4 pack of this beer some time ago and I must say, it was a very, very nice gift.  I'm not typically a high gravity person- anything over 10% I usually don't bother with, but this has really opened the door to that realm for me. I do love Imperial Stouts and exceptionally dark beers though, which is what prompted this as a gift. I had tried something in this class many years ago, but was either not in a place to truly appreciate it, or it simply wasn't crafted to the level of Bourbon County. My overall impression rapidly changed from ""wow this is strong"" to ""if this is what these strong beers are about, I'm going to have to try them all!""  I will start by saying that it is indeed dark. I poured it into one of my snifters, per the instructions on the bottle. This beer is black as night, with a rich brown head that is slight, and disappears quickly. This beer is gorgeous and made my mouth water just looking at it, but I do prefer the head to stick around. Oddly, I didn't seem to mind its departure on this brew. The lacing on the glass when swirling was faint, not as much as I expected given the strong bourbon aroma that accompanied the pour.  The scent is not just bourbon. You can almost smell the wood of the barrel, and it has a smoky quality. This immediately prompted me to use a splash in a steak marinade as well, and let me tell you, the results were amazing. I also poured a small amount in an aluminum can, maybe 2-3 ounces, added enough water to fill the can halfway and then made a beer can chicken, also using a splash of this beer in the rub. Again, the smokey bourbon richness made the bird absolutely succulent. If you really don't like this beer for it's sipping quality, by all means, use it as an ingredient for your dinner and you will not be disappointed!  Back to the beer as a drink...  The flavor and feel can only be described as rich. The combination of bourbon with a thick malty Imperial stout is heavenly. It should be noted that this is a sipping beer. But as sipping beers go, this one excels. The alcohol artifacts aren't overpowering, even though they aren't discrete. I would describe it as a confident presence. The imperial stout isn't lost in it either. The feel in the mouth is thick and heavy, as the Imperial nature flexes its authority with the beer. That stout quality stays settled as a well balanced foundation to the bourbon flavor, nicely keeping this beer a beer.  Beer seems like too common a word for Bourbon County though, as this stuff is anything but common.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,VsTheWorld1121,4.74,"I had the privilege to try BCBCS at the ACBF last year, but I was finally able to get my hands on a couple four packs of regular BCBS tonight.  Appearance - Hard pour into a snifter at fridge temp (about 40 degrees) creates a small head which fades to nothingness within ten seconds leaving only pitch black opacity with barely any lacing. I hear 15% will do that.  Smell - Faint bourbon, not as strong as other BBA beers I've tried. Dark fruits, hints of vanilla.  Taste - Amazing, everything I'd hoped it would be. Definitely boozy, but not 15% boozy. Quick small sips have a bit of burn, but this is definitely a slow sipping beer. Sip, swirl it in your mouth, let every part of the taste hit every part of your mouth. Very little on the front of the tongue, but the back of the tongue and the aftertaste hit like a truck. Like the smell, not as much bourbon as one would expect in a beer like this. More vanilla when it's colder, but as it warms the bourbon taste really comes through in the back. The coffee version beats this one out in my book only because I'm a coffee fanatic and prefer coffee stouts to all others.  Mouthfeel - As thick and chewy as the appearance would indicate. It coats the inside of your mouth and doesn't go away. Not that you would want it to.  Overall - Buy this beer any time you get the chance. Whether you're a seasoned beer geek, a newbie to craft beer, or even just a bourbon drinker, you can't go wrong with BCBS. Can't wait to see how this one ages.

Bourbon-colored fizz kicks up and disappears, but there's no real head to speak of.  Taste: Sweet and vanilla at first. Milk and dark chocolate. Bourbon on the back end of the favor with heat in the throat. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth.  Overall: Very good, but overhyped. Not the perfection I was hoping for.

It's BCBS '12:  A: It looks exactly like motor oil, pitch black, and somewhat thick. Not much of a head.  S: The first thing I got was bourbon, whew! Powerful scent and it continues to give off that bourbon smell all the way down to the last drop.  T: What jumps out is the booziness of this beer and I love it! It's not afraid to show its face when you first dive into it. It's a sipping beer and I would pity any fool who decides to chug this one.  M: Very smooth and silky, and somewhat syrupy. Can detect bit of heat from it but that's due to the booziness...  Overall, it's an amazing beer and really stands out on its own.

First brew of a tasting evening, review from notes.  Pitch black, with some hefty viscosity. Mocha head that recedes into a very thin ring. Typical for the style and brews this potent.  Nose is terrific, with the vanilla taking real centre stage here. Also a bit of oak, sugar, coffee, chocolate. Fanfreakingtasting.  Tasty, tasty stuff. The vanilla gets strong billing again, but the sugar, caramel, chocolate and coffee also get their turn alongside a mild oakiness. And oh yes, there is bourbon. Can't forget that.  Surprisingly mild for a 15%er, as this is something I can drink with real ease. Thick, syrupy, but not overly hot.  Definitely worth the attention it gets. Comparing this brew to others of the style/hype/etc, I rate this one pretty high because it is quite balanced, not overly hot, and the bourbon/oak component is far more subtle than in others.

Definitely a sipper, this guy needs time to develop. I would recommend letting this beer stand at room temp for a little while before diving in. You really can tear apart some of those deeper chocolate/ fruit flavors after its had time to breath a bit. This beer was recommended by a customer and from his description I was really looking forward to trying it. In retrospect I feel like I should thank him the next time I see him, this stout totally lived up to everything he said it would be. You can pick up the aromas of this beer the second you crack the top and the carbonation exhales form the bottle. I got a strong woody/fudgeness going on right off the bat. The pour wasn't all that exciting,(not subtracting from this beer in anyway) a slight fizzy head that dissipated rather quickly to a slight brownish halo, which stuck around a while. Initialing I found the bourbon flavors most prominent, which was nice, I mean it for sure lives up to its name. The best part by far though was after about 20 minutes. That is when it warmed up and the real depth developed. The high alcohol content is alway there, but the balance between it, the strong woody/ bourbon tones, and the chocolately/fruity/stout characteristics really was spectacular. I can see why this beer has a real cult following.

A small dark tan head forms, dissipating quickly into a fine collar with support from a slow cascade of carbonation that struggles to rise through the density. Eventually the head totally dissipates, leaving more of a clear coating rather than lace.  S. Reminds me more of a barleywine: sweet booze, prunish dark fruits,toffee, sherry. A slight metallic zing.  T. Layers of complexity. I can see why people love it. Big sweetness right away, dark fruit, a bite of booze, chocolate, roasty, toffee. A very nice roasty flavor lingers. Sherry as it warms, or perhaps more appropriately, bourbon.  M. Thick. It is interesting, the flavors that it keeps around: roasty, chocolate, a little bourbon barrel.  O. Very nice.

1549,10672,Benish,4.64,"Poured 2013 release in snifter.  Appearance: this stuff looked thick while pouring out, like condensed milk. A brown head built up but disintegrated rapidly, from the surface bubbles were just popping. Eventually it was a black glossy surface. What's to say about the color? It's black.  Aroma: picked up a ton of black licorice, some vanilla and bourbon. Once I noted black licorice, that aroma became even more prominent that I had to try looking past it to pick up other aromas.  Taste: the flavors are huge. Picked up primarily bourbon and vanilla. The alcohol was really prominent, you can taste and feel the booze. The thing is, it's hard to pick out individual flavors, the taste almost wrecks my palate as all the favors are attacking my tongue. It's sweet enough that my lips stick together.  Mouthfeel: its thick and creamy. I've had this on draft which was a better experience mouthfeel wise, but still from the bottle, its outstanding. Also have to add that the alcohol is intense in this one. There's so much heat, its like chilies were added!  Overall: It's worth the money! The cost is steep but once you taste it, it's ""ah-hah!"" The flavors are huge. I know I'm exaggerating but it's almost like this is CONCENTRATED barrel-aged imperial stout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,rickyleepotts,4.66,"It's been a while since I have had this beer, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I LOVE this beer, and I like pretty much everything this brewing company makes. Having had the Bourbon County Coffee Stout, this might not impress me as much as before… but I am sure it is good. Sheryl was mad it wasn't a bomber… but at 13%, I am not sure we could share a bomber and not be hammered!  When I was pouring this, I could smell the bourbon… and with the current trend in aging beers in bourbon barrels, I hope the brewing company that arguably started aging in barrels is able to surpass my expectations in BA (barrel aged) beers. Speaking of barrel aged beers, we have a few BA beers coming up including the Black Gold from Full Sail. Anyway, let's start drinking the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Cheers!  In the Glass: The beer is pitch black in a glass. It poured somewhat thick… think cough syrup. The head is thin, but a nice dark tan color. Not much lace, but who cares. I can smell the bourbon from here! I wonder what the first batch of this tasted like. I wonder if there are any bottles of the first batch still around. That would be a beer worth celebrating!  Nose: Like I said, I could smell the bourbon while I was pouring this. I can still smell it sitting in the glass. When I stick my nose in the glass, I am getting smacked with vanilla and booze. You can totally smell the 13% ABV here. I am getting some dark chocolate notes, too. It's booze, vanilla, THEN chocolate… in that order. Age will do wonders for this beer. I think we have one more bottle in the cellar. I might, after drinking this today, drink that in 4 or 5 years. It needs time to settle.  Flavor: Holy booze. That might as well be carbonated whiskey. OK, not quite as intense as a bourbon, but you taste the booze. There are also a lot of bubbles (served this cold) attacking your palate. My favorite part is the finish as it lingers for several minutes. The whiskey flavors are obvious, and if you don't like whiskey, I would suggest staying away from this. This is what a bourbon barrel aged beer SHOULD taste like. Breweries and brewmasters take note… this is a prime example of a BA beer.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is not as thick as I expected, and has more bubbles than I expected. But that's OK, because as it finishes you get some nice carbonation that settles to a drying heat. The whiskey really comes out toward the back of the palate. Even if you don't like barrel aged beers, you should try this just to see what other breweries are trying to replicate when aging a beer. This beer also gets me excited about the Firestone Walker Parabola that comes out in a few weeks. They use the best barrels in the world to age that beer.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is immediately drying, and this is where the dark chocolate flavors come into play. It's not quite an Irish stout kind of dry, but close. After one or two swallows, the heat is still there… and reminds you of the 13% ABV this bottle packs. Every time I swallow, I am reminded of how good this beer is, and why I miss Chicago! Sure, they have the Bears and the Cubs and the Metro… but Chicago should be known for Goose Island!  I don't miss Indiana, but I miss being able to drive to the Windy City and drink this from the source. We had the Bourbon County Coffee Stout at the source, and that quickly became one of our favorite beers of all time. This one isn't far behind. Top 10, for sure!

1549,10672,iabeerbaron,4.48,"I will be letting a few four packs age and hopefully at some point I can put together a vertical tasting of this beer, but as I was sipping the last one, (about 2 weeks ago), and as it warmed, it might have been the best barrel-age I’ve tasted. The aroma of the vanilla shines through the longer this beer sits, and as I finished the last half of it, it started tasting like a liquid form of an almond joy candy bar. Anyone else get that flavor? Such a great beer to sit and sip on, especially on a cold winter night! The alcohol warms you up nicely but does not overpower the fantastic flavor of this wonderfully well-crafted brew. Cheers!  REVIEW  Style: Imperial Stout  ABV:15%  Purchased at: Hy-Vee  Pour: Viscous black pour, very thick.  Aroma: Bourbon sweetness, vanilla, coconut.  Flavor: Chocolate flavor, the bourbon is there, coconut is well. Liquid almond joy (that can get you drunk)",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BurgeoningBrewhead,4.89,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into stemmed tulip (stout glass). Pours oily brown-black, no light shows through. Fizzy dark brown half-finger head that dissipates like a soda. Smell is bourbon very strong, with sweet undertones. First sip and taste is...mind-shattering. Incredibly complex, the taste explodes in your mouth with bitter chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, everything. This is an experience in a bottle. Alcohol comes in at the end to finish with a nice burn, but still a lot less than you'd expect from 15%. Mouthfeel is slick and wet. A glorious beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,zrbeer1579,4.66,"2012 Bourbon County Brand Stout  Poured into snifter  Appearance: Black as it can possibly be. No head, of course. Did get a small head but it dissipated very quickly. Gone before the blink of an eye. A thin dark mocha ring around the glass.  Aroma: Bourbon, bourbon, and bourbon. Vanilla, coconut, and some woody characteristic. Tiny bits of roasted and chocolate malts. Alcohol is perceived.  Taste: Very strong bourbon upfront. Coconut, vanilla, and a little woody. Middle is roasted chocolate malts with slight caramel. Subtle hints of bourbon compliments the middle well. But still, bourbon is strong throughout. Some espresso and toffee. There is a slight cloying sweetness. Surprisingly, alcohol is not as strong in the taste as I thought it would be. Quite subtle, to be honest. A nice bourbon lingering aftertaste with a slight roasted chocolate.  As it warms to room temperature, alcohol becomes much less noticeable. Malts become stronger as well. Thus, making the beer more enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Thick and very smooth. Carbonation is under medium. There is alcohol warmings in the back and as it goes down. What can you expect with an abv of 15%? Feels oily, too.  Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. The bourbon is very rich. Certainly a sipper. You must like bourbon to truly enjoy this, especially since bourbon is the primary flavor. It makes me very excited to try the bottles that are currently aging. This is a must have BA stout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JohnQVD,4.71,"Dark, almost black with almost no head, just a thin wisp of light brown foam that leaves small bits behind that slowly drop back into the glass. Smell is heavy bourbon and cocoa. Taste is chocolate, bourbon and raisins with a boozy, bitter finish. Feel is heavy with a burst of light carbonation.  Overall, this is excellent and well balanced. It could use just a touch less bourbon and I'd consider it basically perfect.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Prager62,4.21,"A bottle stamped drink by 09 AUG27 with an abv of 14.3%.  It pours a medium thick dark brown with a thin ring of tan foam. The smell is bourbon forward with molasses, burnt brown sugar. A moderately sweet brown sugar presence dominates the taste followed by warming bourbon, charred marshmallows and oak in the finish. The feel is medium thick and slightly hot.  I've been drinking these since the mid 2000's. While they still scratch the itch, they don't make me bleed like they once did. I'm sure it's a myriad of reasons from palate shift to more/better quality options now? It seems less sweet than last years batch which is nice because I'm not a fan of needing an insulin shot afterwards. Still a decent value as they go and worth a shot.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mikkianderson,4.91,A strong and robust stout that currently holds the place of favored stout for me. An acquired taste that may not be for those who do not appreciate a good bourbon!

1549,10672,DrewV,5,"Words cannot describe this beer. My first perfect score, ever. This was brewed by the Gods themselves. Much has been already written about this brew, so I'll simply say that this is perfection in a bottle. My search is officially over. Until they stop producing this, I will seek out and buy every bottle I can get my hands on.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,KKB,4.62,"A – Just black as the depths of the earth, no ray of light stands a chance passing through this abyss. Deep wheat/caramel colored head, though it dissipates rather quickly which is vaguely disappointing. The vanishing act is owing, I’m sure, to it’s somewhat outrageous ABV at 11%. I’m not entirely sure what I’m in for based upon the look of this, but I can tell you this much: this stout seems to mean business.  S – What do you even say about a smell like that when it hits your nostrils? Perfection? Maybe just short. But in any case this thing is not for the faint of heart. The bourbon explodes in your nostrils, and as you let it sink in you notice the insane amount of roasted (borderline burnt) barley, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar…oh and did I say bourbon? Cause holy muscle-flexing, beard-growing, wilderness, just the smell of the bourbon in here has made my voice drop two decibels.  T – Welp. That’s bourbon. My goood, that is something else entirely. I won’t lie, the first time I had this beer, I absolutely hated it. Couldn’t understand it, and drank it under the wrong circumstances. Now that I’ve mentally suited up and addressed this titan as is fit and proper, I can truthfully say that I have never had anything like this in my whole damn life. And I can truthfully add that I think I am a little bit out of my league when it comes to this brew. My beards a bit too thin and my forearms are a bit too scrawny, but my fledgling love of bourbon and my fully-fledged enjoyment of stouts allows me to be rather infatuated with this beer.  Moreover, with each successive sip, I feel myself descending little by little into this bittersweet chocolate, sugary, butterscotch, vanilla, oaky-smoky, bourbon laden goodness. Fascinating how with each successive sip my tastebuds adjust a little, and my appreciation grows. This bourbon stout seems to me to be something of a masterpiece…I will be back to review this when I have had about a thousand more beers and a respectable amount of bourbon stouts so that I have some benchmark to compare to…until next time.  M – What is there to say, the mouthfeel almost outshines the flavor. It is flawless, which I really did not expect. I thought it would probably be a bit too heavy and potentially off-putting. I was incorrect yet again. This beer has been perfectly crafted, feels like silken granite in your mouth, and yet lingers on the tail end for you to fully enjoy, like any self-respecting stout ought to. Carbonation? I know you’re there. And yet I don’t feel you.  O – In theory I have a healthy dislike for Goose Island. I had heard good things, but I know that they have been purchased by Anheuser-Busch and I tend to have nothing but disdain for beer producers on their scale, don’t even like to support them. And yet, all (well, most) is forgiven if they don’t interfere with the brewing process of beers like Bourbon County Stout.  That being said, this type of beer is brand new to me. I never imagined that bourbon and a well-crafted stout could combine to this level of perfection; with devastation looming on each and every side of this creation, the balance that needs to be achieved in order to be delicious is a daunting undertaking. With each successive sip I give this beer my blessing, and yet I might rate this somewhat artificially low just so that I force my hand to adjust the score when I am a more well-rounded and experienced beer drinker. In any case, know this loyal fans, THIS BEER IS OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD, LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF AN F. SCOTT FITZGERALD NOVEL. But then again, if you don’t like bourbon, I suggest a hard veer away from this monster.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Told him to wrap it up!  12 oz bottle dated 11/11/11  A - Pours almost black, with little to no head.  S - As soon as I uncapped the bottle, the bourbon smell was evident, if not prevalent. My wife asked, from across the room, what I had just opened. Dark fruits up front, with a hint of chocolate. Wonderful smell.  T - Mellows as you drink it, with the chocolate and vanilla up front, accented by the bourbon which, to me, seems to become more prevalent as I work my way through it..  M - Smooth and creamy. The alcohol is there, but doesn't make it harsh. Wonderful feel.  Overall - Incredible beer. Only my second bourbon barrel aged, but it reinforced the fact that I really enjoy these! I could drink tho all night. Of course, I probably wouldn't make it to work tomorrow! Fantastic beer.

Follows with lots of dark fruit, bourbon and an oaky, sweet taste. M: Velvety mouthfeel but with a kinda dry after taste. Medium/thick bodied with medium carbonation.

Incredibly smooth smelling  T - Starts with a bitter chocolate and dark fruit taste. The fruits really start to meld. A lot of that dark raisin and vanilla, before finishing smooth with chocolate and coffee notes. The best part is that the bourbon really plays a supporting role through the whole taste. It never comes out and shows itself, it's a wonderful blend.  M - Incredibly smooth and creamy. Carbonation is perfect. I'm not sure how this is 15% either, it's so smooth.  Overall - Simply. Superb.

S: Woah, holy bourbon. Really alcoholic smelling. Slight raisin and a little chocolate in there too.  T: I'm surprised at how smooth it is considering the 15% abv it has. Notes of vanilla, cocoa, bourbon, roasted malts, stone fruits. Definitely a sipping beer. Has a sweet finish without the burn that I would have expected.  M: Thick and rich, surprising for such a big beer.  O: Glad I have another to age in the cellar and see what a year would do.

T- the chocolate stands out in both rich and bitter profiles. The vanilla, Carmel, and molasses play with the rich wood character. All rounded out with a boozy finish that reminds you of the 15% abv  M- big and silky, low carbonation, a barely detectable trace of carbonation leads into a lightly bitter boozy finish  O- I always look forward to getting my hands on this offering very winter.

1549,10672,DRyan,4.44,"Served at 50 degrees in a snifter, 2012 version brewed 11/2012  A: Inky jet black with little to no head even with a vigorous pour. The slight head that is there is deep coffee crown, and does linger on the glass. S: The bouquet is amazing on this, there is the bourbon up front with the roastyness I would expect from a stout, but there is also this sweetness almost akin with a Barleywine hidden in there that I don't know quite what to make of, but I really like! T: Amazing. The bourbon barrel characteristics are very pronounced, but not overwhelmingly so. The stout roasty/malty backbone is actually somewhat subdued and not nearly as present as I would expect from motor oil like this. That sweetness in the nose is present, and it makes itself know with some coffee/toffee mixture in the flavor. There are some hops to this, but just enough to balance it out. What there isn't: alcohol burn. I can NOT believe this is 15% ABV! Be warned! M: Smooth, silky, velvety. There is very little carbonation, but I actually like that with this beer, it adds to the silkiness of the taste and compliments it nicely, but there is enough bubbly to remind you that yes, this is a beer. D: Too drinkable for 15%. Too drinkable for something I can't get regularly here in TX. Pretty amazing.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,rringler,4.27,"Just a quick shout-out to Dave at Distillers Outlet in Poway, CA. Without his generosity, I would never have had the chance to taste this one.  A: Thick, dark, black, with a bit of an oily sheen. Small, 1/4 finger head of mocha bubbles that shrink to about a 1/8"" ring. Leaves very little lacing.  S: Smells big, with lots of chocolate, bitter, toffee, and cool mint in there. Perhaps some boozy bourbon smell in there.  T: Malty, vanilla and bourbon start, but is dominated by a chocolately/caramely toffee/coffee finish. Hides the 15% abv is hidden very well.  M: She's a cruiser; big, thick, and oily all the way down. Delightfully chewy.  O: I really can't do this one justice, as I'm not a coffee drinker.

1549,10672,montrealbcr89,4.62,"Big thanks to Rutager and/or yeahnatenelson for the hookup on this one. Served into a Bourbon County Brand Stout snifter.  A: Black. Poured 1/4 finger of dark brown, cola-like head that dissipated very quickly. There are slight blood red highlights on the edges when the beer is held up to the light.  S: Wow. Vanilla straight away up front. Bourbon notes galore. There is some dark chocolate waay in the back. Some dark fruits and dark cherries as well.  T: Sensational. This is where it shines for me. Although this is touted as a ""bourbon monster"", I feel that it is very well integrated into the beer. Rather than the bourbon being dominant, it acts as a new element that is working together with the various other portions of the beer. For a 15% BA Imp Stout, it is a pretty easy drinker. A sipper for sure, but it never becomes harsh.  M: Just enough carbonation to get the beer moving along. Thick, and very coating.  O: It was worth the wait. This beer DEFINITELY lives up to the hype. For me, this is as good as the likes of Parabola as well as other sensational BA Imp Stouts. Just a beautiful beer to slowly enjoy on a snowy Montreal night.  Cheers.  Popped open an '09 to christen my new half pint courtesy of yeahnatenelson.  A: Going into the glass, it is not as black, as the '12, but still very dark. In the glass, this thing poured with ZERO head. It is jet black. Even holding it up to the light, this thing is just black.  S: Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, caramel. A huge difference between the '09 and the '12 is the brown sugar aroma that you would typically get in an old ale.  T: Vanilla, burt brown sugar, bourbon. Some dark fruits as well as dark chocolate.  M: Very full. Very little carbonation. Some definite warming as it goes down.  O: As a BA stout goes, this is extremely tasty. I would criticize it for the heat on it after 4 years. Delicious nonetheless. The brown sugar characteristic really sets this one apart.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,DrDemento456,4.61,"Been a couple years since my last review this is simply because I did not have the access to it as I did the time I was able to get some from Halftime Beverage. New 18 ounce bottle poured into a Goblet big thanks to TreBonez for the hookup!  A - As expected it looks similar to my last review very pitch black in color with just a 1/2 inch of head that fizzes out rather quickly from the ethanol octane. No lacing. S - BIG bourbon its almost enough to choke the nostils and make them burn a bit. After it had time to breath it does have a nice layer of bakers chocolate and roast but ethanol notes are still rather strong in the base. T - The layers in this beer are impressive as I revisit it is as I remember sweet cocoa like chocolate chips grace the palate but to me it doesn't get too strong or artificial. The bourbon is there but not as strong as one would expect in fact I blown away at its smoothness. Dry dark chocolate notes lead to the finish revealing a bit of hoppy bitterness and another splash of bourbon for good nature. M - Again as I type I am a few ounces into this beast and it still goes to your head even though this batch is 1% ABV less. To me its smoother than I remember even though its only a month old its bold but distinct.  Overall as a huge fan of Imperial stouts this one that started the bourbon craze still turns many heads and even though AB owned they still produce a quality product.  Bottle dated 9/20/12 so I got it with 5 month of age!  A - I am always amazed when a stout gives me over an inch of head at such a high octane ABV. Could possibly be the deepest tone of mocha head and the beer is blacker than darkness. Wow! S - As expected it's straight up bourbon yet it doesn't smell ""boozy"" just smooth bourbon. I do get some mild chocolate and some roast so maybe I need to let it warm up a bit. T - Starts off rather sweet with a caramel like bourbon tone, then I get some chocolate it's fairly sweet but not cloying, and kind of Belgium in nature. Roasts are mild but apparent giving me a sense of smoke and the finish has some warming bourbon. As it warms though the ethanol sneaks in at the finish making me think this beer is not as well crafted. Still at 15% it's to be expected. M - Well I am about 1/4 of the way through as I type and it really goes to your head. Quite a high octane Imperial stout, creamy, viscous, and warming. Overall I am so glad I have 7 more it's everything I expected maybe doesn't go into depth with extreme oak or vanilla flavors (they are there but I didn't pick up too much) but for what it is it's a damn smooth bourbon stout. Worth trying!  As a final note I can't believe how well the bourbon is hidden! I had a Founders Backwoods bastard (10.2%) and it was boozy and harsh even with 5 months on it. How they hide the 15% is beyond incredible!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Brewsephus,2.48,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A- aggressively poured into glass yields half-inch mocha colored head which dissipates within 30 seconds leaving no lacing on glass. Beer is black and totally opaque.  S- Vanilla, wow, vanilla, hot chocolate, scotch with lots of toasted peat, dark plum, prune.  T-Fantastic amounts of bourbon on the front of the tongue, lots of chocolate, milk chocolate flavor, oak comes through on the finish. The flavor is very intense. Lots of vanilla, like someone poured vanilla extract into it. The alcohol isn't present at first but borders on burning on the finish. Hot alcohol lingers in the back of your throat.  M- syrup. very viscous, little carbonation. no effervescence. full bodied to say the least.  O- If you could make this into a candle it would be magnificent. As a beer it is very poor. It does one thing, and it takes it overboard. I had really high hopes for this beer but it is so out of balance it's nauseating. There is so much wood and bourbon in this beer, it's impossible to enjoy the base malt or roast. I will not buy this again, or recommend it to anyone. In fact, i'm amazed at it's BA rating.

The only reason I didn't give it fives is because I haven't tried enough of its competitors. Given it's cost, it will always be a special occasion brew for me, but I do not feel that it is overpriced. Can't wait to share some with friends. (I can spare one bottle, maybe.)

1549,10672,Hultkrantz,3.85,"Mmmmm Smells of Dark chocolate toffee with a rich vanilla, slightly charred, oak veil. Beneath, something like a liqueur complexity. Highly viscous, it anoints your throat with this smooth taste sensation, massaging your mouth with a subtle carbonation... It's heavy, 33cl is enough for six people I'm sure.  I wish I would have had a chocolate dessert to accompany it. And I wish I would have bought more bottles!  Highly recommended!  4.45  Edit: I had to edit this because I realized it makes me sick.

1549,10672,mikem0487,4.36,"12oz bottle with bottled on date: 9/20/12. Poured into goblet.  A-A ridiculously black beer. No colors hues when held up to the light. Straight blackness with a single fingered brown head that slowly fell back into the beer. Now all there is is a remanent of the head laced around the outside of my glass.  S-Dark chocolate, bourbon, cacao beans, oak chips, vanilla beans. All those are blended together beautifully with chocolate and bourbon being the dominant aromas. The vanilla beans come in through the end and bring it all together. Has everything you look for and expect in a bourbon aged stout.  T-Dark chocolate and licorice are apparent in the beginning. Dried prune and raisin are throughout the whole palate experience. Vanilla is in their timidly. The bourbon taste comes through the back end of the palate with some oak wood like earthiness character. Alcohol in this beer is barely apparent which is astonishing considering it is 15% abv. Taste great, hides the alcohol but does not taste as good as it smells.  M-Medium bodied, finishes pretty dry, low carbonation. Good for this style of beer.  O- This beer lives up to the hype. For me personally the smell had everything you want with this type of beer but the taste fell short of that for me. The smell was more concise and linear you could say while the taste was more erratic and did not have the extremely enjoyable aspects of what the aroma contained. Overall this beer is done beautifully and does not drink like a 15% imperial stout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Stevedore,4.46,"2/2/13, 2012 vintage on tap at Brickhouse BBQ in Madison WI.  Aroma: Nose full of vanilla, wood and chocolate. Hints of dry, bourbon characteristics with the occasional whiff of dark fruits. You don't have to work very hard at all to get a nose from this brew. (4.25)  Colour: Thick jet black body, impenetrable to light. Pours with a 0.5-1cm brown head that evaporates rather quickly, leaving me a full glass of beer! Lacing sticks pretty well when I swirl it around in the snifter a bit. This time, it was an overall above-average appearance for its style. I suppose a thicker head would make it better. But not by much. (4)  Flavour: Incredible dark chocolate sweetness and vanilla flavors combines to make my palate pass out in ecstasy. Throughout I get some oak/wood with some bourbon flavours and heat. I get a little bit of cherry and fig also. You'd never guess this beer has a 15% ABV even with the heat, although the heat ramps up as I get to the bottom of the glass as it warms. (4.5)  Mouthfeel: This is probably the creamiest, thickest bodied brew I've had the privilege to drink, almost like drinking a dessert. Carbonation is as expected for the style. Runs a bit dry as expected from the bourbon barrel contribution yet still so easy to drink large swallows of. Incredibly well-done and it's clear that the BCBS series sets the standard for the style. (5)  Overall: The gold standard for barrel aged imperial stouts and I've enjoyed it each time I've had it whether its from the bottle or the tap. I've had a few other BA stouts that attempt to dethrone it, and while they are incredible in their own ways, I consider BCBS to be the granddaddy of them all. The only negative is that it's not a beer to take lightly- open one up when you have something to celebrate or are hankering for a bone-warmer in front of the fireplace- you prepare yourself to take on a beer like this. Don't open one up if you want to hang out with some buddies after work- open up a Zombie Dust or something if you do that- respect BCBS.

I don't have to work to it at all, it's just there in all it's greatness. I'm picking up wood, bourbon, chocolate, and a bit of alcohol. The malt flavors are very rich and very tasty. I'm getting chocolate, coffee, also the wood and bourbon. With this guy coming it at 15% I'm also tasting the alcohol. Full bodied, thick, rich all these adjectives are what come to mind. The flavors are so rich and deep on my palette I can tell its going to stick with more for awhile. This is an amazing beer, probably the best barrel aged beer I've ever had.

Basically just a paper thin brown ring around the edge of the glass and no surface foam.  S- Tons of oak and dark roasted malt sweetness.  T- Huge blast of vanilla and dark roasted malts that provide the perfect blend of chocolate/vanilla/char/sweetness. Alcohol is not nearly as present as one would expect it to be.

1549,10672,Argion,4.72,"***Updated for 2014 Vintage*** Got a 4 pack of these just before the end of the year waiting for a good time to have one. Well it has arrived. Small and flavor are more reminiscent of the 2011 vintage but there is an extra something in there that makes the flavor better. Can't really identify it but whatever it is, it is the best one so far. Had this rated as a 4.63 originally but I upping the scores for this specific year.   ***Original Review*** This is for both the 2011 and 2012 vintage. Although different enough to consider them separate beers they both are good and have the same merits. Servers a very dark black colour, with a bit head. in the 2011 vintage the bourbon influence can be noticed as you pour. A bit of a dark head but not much.  As indicated the 2011 vintage does have a strong Bourbon flavor to it. The 2012 however reminded me more of a very good port wine. I don't know if they changed the barrels this was conditioned in and that explains the change. I like port more than bourbon so the 2012 wins out just because of that.  This is a beer that almost has to be sipped, preferably while relaxing by a fireplace on a cold winter night.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Beer itself pours thickly and is dark black.  Smell: Bourbon, raisins, figs, vanilla, slight roasted notes, caramel.  Taste: Some alcohol present, but it works well. Initial taste is sweet ... bourbon, vanilla, transitions to toffee then some slight chocolate, finally ending in sweet dark fruits and raisins.  Mouthfeel: Like the thickness, but would be interested in more carbonation. This beer is quite soft. My least favorite part.  Overall: I finally understand this beer. Have had it a few times before and was extremely put off by the bourbon flavor. My palate must have changed a bit because this bottle is fresh and I love it.

Pours a coffee black w a decent tan head if you pour aggressively. Smells sweet with aromas of bourbon, barrel, coffee and some faint vanilla. The taste follows suit, sweet right up front, but when warms the mouth w a bit of booze, spice and finishes on a superb woody-bourbon-bitter chocolate note.

1549,10672,Anker13,4.75,"1/27/13- Goose Island | 2012 Bourbon County Brand Stout | 12oz Bottle  Appearance- jet black motor oil, rich brown head, completely opaque, no light getting through  Aroma- Bourbon, bourbon, bourbon. Chocolate, oak, roasted malt, vanilla, too many things going on to accurately describe! Earthy notes as well, woody. Dark fruits?  Mouthfeel- light carbonation, full bodied (the fullest), thick slightly coating, smooth and velvety, somewhat chewy as well, syrupy  Taste- Insanity. Easily one of the best beers I’ve ever had. I don’t even know where to begin with this one, so many things happening in my mouth. The whiskey taste is not overwhelming at all like a lot of other bourbon aged beers. There’s enough for you to know it’s there but not enough to make you wish that it wasn’t. Oaky and sweet vanilla follow the immediate whiskey flavor, then the traditional stout flavors ensue… Dark chocolate and roasted barley notes. Finishes surprisingly smooth and sweet. Amazing.  Residual- Sweet and slightly sticky, syrupy, plenty of oaky vanilla taste left, slight chocolate as well.  Overall- Truly a world class beer. Smells like a 15% but certainly doesn't taste like it. I’ve never been a big fan of Bourbon Aged Beers, and I had my doubts about Goose Island after having some of their other offerings. But I must say… I’m now a believer.

1549,10672,flagmantho,4.61,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2012 vintage; I've been looking forward to drinking one of these for a long time.  Appearance: per the style, this is an utterly, completely, entirely black beer. The head is a thin finger of frothy, fizzy brown foam. Color is wonderful, but I would have liked a little more retention on the head. Still a great looking beer.  Smell: aroma is a rich vanilla complemented by a light oakiness. Sweet, syrupy, engine-oil black malt comes through the charred barrel, with a tiny hint of chocolate and a little bit of fruitiness which carries great complexity in its subtlety. This, friends, is what a stout should smell like.  Taste: first impressions: alcohol, vanilla, oak, sweetness. As the flavor develops on my tongue it shows some barleywine-type character, where the exceedingly rich malty flavor is almost sharp in its strength. At second taste, I can feel the fruity flavors develop, no doubt due to the alcohol; still, there is a nice raisin, cherry, date and plum character which is wonderful. Each of these elements slowly overlay and overtake each other; as the last recedes, the next can take its place. I also want to say that there's nothing that seems gimmicky in this beer: it's straight-up quality, through and through. Sha. Zam.  Mouthfeel: big body with a good carbonation for the style and a silky smooth mouthfeel, if not a big creaminess. The stickiness of this beer pretty much ensures a smooth ride down your gullet.

Pop the top--kaboom! It pours a very dark grayish brown, with a mocha head that barely forms before it completely attenuates. Chocolate syrup, vanilla extract, and oaky coconut on the nose. The mouthfeel is quite viscous and chewy. Smooth flavors of chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, minced meat pie, and oaky bourbon. Alcohol appears midway, bittering the last half and finish a little too much. But, it does temper all the sweetness.

A- Dark black body, with some red color on the edge of the glass. At first pour, a dark caramel head of foam appears, and quickly dissolves into the blackness of this beer. Beautiful.  S- Dark chocolate just pleasantly overwhelms me, and ends with a sweet sugary smell. Hints of oak and coconut fight through the dark chocolate and make this thing complete.  T- My initial taste is berries, with a lot of dark chocolate. It's so complex. I can taste the oak, the sugar, burnt caramel, some coconut, and just a hint of vanilla. Not only is this thing complex, everything works well together.  M- It's hot on my tongue. and very thick. I had to sip on it, but every sip was extremely enjoyable.  O- This beer is just amazing. I don't know if I can even call it beer, it's more like candy. Yes, I had to sip it, but I was sipping this thing constantly as I needed to keep having a drink of this.

Looks thick and heavy, Sits in the pint glass like it owns it and dares you to come and give it a try.  S - Smells like oak chips in an oaken barrel after a walk through an oak forest.  T - The oak I smelled is definitely strong and aggressive. It dominates but it's not all that's there. There's a nice alcohol bite and a wave of sweetness following the oak that reminds me of dark chocolate and fruit, maybe apple? Whatever it is is followed by a second wave of oak.  M - Very thick and full bodied. Has a little more residual sweetness than I'd like but it's not cloying, just thick as all get out. I don't detect any hops at all and only a bit of malt.  O - After a few sips and some time for it to sink into the tongue, the oak and a yeasty medicinal taste start to crop up. The bourbon also comes through afer a third of the bottle is done. At some point, this beer overstayed its welcome. This may be the most interesting stout I've ever had, though I cannot say it's my favorite.

A: Poured a slick, pitch black color that didn't quite pour out oil-like (ala Dark Lord), but still quite thick. The slightly darker than mocha head was small, yet what was there stuck around for a good while.  S: Heavy on the nose... in an awesome way. Not extremely bourbon heavy to my senses, but the coconut quality melded very well with the chocolate notes. Not much roast, but that's was fine by me. Nice!  T: A lot more bourbon on the taste.... pretty much an awesome blend of candy coated chocolate, malts, booze, and coconut. I especially liked the rich, vanilla-infused caramel quality as well. Simple amazing!  M: Thick, yet not syrupy or sugary in the slightest. A slight carbonation prickle and quite a bit of head that I actually found to be delectable in this setting. No lacing to speak of, but that is common of most BA brews. Pretty much perfect.  O: While this is certainly a sipper, it isn't nearly as hot as one might think.

Hard to believe that this was a beer, given the strength and potency of it, but over the course of a nice Winter night such as this, no beer could be better than this, and this truly proved to me why this deserved to be categorized as an Imperial!  This screamed ""motor oil"" from start to finis - thick pour, dark, and with a decent chocolate mousse-type head that held its own before fading quickly. Lots of dark chocolate, vanilla, cocoa nibs, and booze in the nose, with a clean Bourbon finish underneath it all. Couldn't taste the oak and ash up front but I could feel it in the aftertaste because of the warming sensation and the warming effect that it gave me. This was so thick that there was hardly any carbonation here but any suds would have detracted from the deep and bold mouthfeel of this beer, and it was hard to get much of any bubbles going even when I swished this around.  Alcohol? It's here. Don't plan on finishing this in less than an hour and a half. This might be the most aggressive beer that I've ever had but there's no doubt that this is the smoothest that I've enjoyed as well.

1549,10672,radium,4.7,"Format: 12oz bottle Bottle Date: 11/08/2012 Serving glass: Tulip  Thanks to a generous BeerAdvocate, I was able to secure two bottles of 2012 Goose Island BCBS.  This beer displayed high viscosity and literally gulped its way out of the bottle when poured in my Bruery tulip glass. No carbonation or head at first, but then came this really nice, rich tan-brown head that dissipated quickly. Color was classic jet black - absolutely no light was let through this beer.  One of the many components of this beer worth savoring is the aroma. I really did not want to drink this beer because I could spend hours smelling the rich bourbon. I was able to detect some dark chocolate on the nose, but mostly bourbon.  While the nose was a treat, actually getting to drink this beer was insane. Mouthfeel was dense, smooth, and had huge body. The finish on this monster is incredibly long - one sip and a spectrum of flavor hits your palate that lingers on and on. One thing I immediately noticed was how smooth this beer was. For 15%, you would expect this beer to pack a heat punch. The bourbon is going off as expected, but the presence of dark chocolate brownies, hazelnuts, dark roast, and some oak were detectable. Another aspect of this beer to appreciate, unlike some barrel aged beers, is that it avoids being overly syrupy. One thing I cannot stand about some imperial stouts is that nasty, detestable soy sauce flavor. My bottle of BCBS had no trace of soy sauce, or weird deep sea ""umami"".  This beer is what any barrel aged stout should aspire to. It's not overly sweet, no oxidation or sourness, no syrup, no soy sauce. It is highly complex with layers of distinct flavors and delicious bourbon. This beer in many ways reminded me of Firestone Walker Parabola (or vice versa). I really wish this beer came out West because it truly is worth seeking out or trading for. My local bourbon barrel aged stouts are good, but for a non-California beer BCBS is every bit as good if not better. Be careful though, with its high drinkability and 15% ABV, it's a dangerous little bottle.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TWStandley,4.75,"Poured from the bottle into my KTG Snifter. 2012 vintage.  Appeared a pitch black color with a one finger mocha head. Slight oily in appearance. When held to light, slight amber tinge around the edges.  Smells boozy and sweet. Intense bourbon smells including smokey wood, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, and plums. Slight coffee note.  Taste is incredibly complex. First you are hit with the bourbon taste. Sweet alcohol. Then comes through more of the creamy vanilla tastes. Aftertaste has a hint of expresso and sugar.  Alcohol content is well masked. Beer is very thick and syrupy. This is one to take small sips of and swish around on the pallete. Not a lot of carbonation.  I call this my ""football game beer."" Meaning that it takes and entire football game to get through a 12oz bottle. Each sip needs to be savored. This isn't for the faint of heart but also isn't SO intense that it isn't enjoyable. What a solid beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,thecheapies,4.7,"Bourbon County Brand Stout 2012. Bottled 09/20/2012. Poured into a Courvoisier snifter. Thanks again, wittyname! I owe you still!  Pours a seriously-heavy black with great thickness. Comes out of the bottle in sheets. Never bubbled up, with a very lax desire for head-formation. I ended up with an icy ring, so thin, I can barely distinguish the color of the foam. Incredibly thick legs.  The aroma is pretty intense. Sweet bourbon, fudge brownie, dry oakiness, booze, espresso, and hints of dark raisin. Lots of complex whiskey notes coming out here. Woody nose. Dark chocolate, barrel wood, and hints of vanilla. Great stuff.  Amazing. Gooey double-fudge brownies, vanilla liqueur, bourbon with simple syrup, brulee'd sugars, Werthers Original, bitter cocoa, molasses, black malts, Kahlua, and sweet alcohol. Nuances of maple and toasted coconut. Elixir-y, but with hop evidence (not much). Very subtle hint of brandy-poached berries. Wildly-pronounced by the bourbon note, which is sublime and never imposing. Redefines the style to me. This is a bourbon stout, not just a bourbon barrel-aged stout. Tastes like you could only hope to imagine from an original.  The alcohol is never compromised, however, it's so sweet like the other decadent flavors that you'd never think you're drinking a 15-percenter. The body is massive and creamy. It almost separates in the mouth if held too long. Delayed headiness, but firmly strong and big. Carbonation is weak, but, with the little force it can muster, drives spice into the pockets of the mouth; opening up that delicious whiskey note. Sticky, but not as sticky as you might think. Mouthfeel was damn near mastered here.  Malty decadence and booze do to my mind what hoppy beers do to my taste buds. An after-hours macho sipper. The rule-setter. The beer that the others hold a candle to. Who needs an afterthought? Let 'em have the score, why don't you!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,gr0g,4.82,"12oz bottle, 2012 vintage.  Pours pitch black with a thin, tan head. Viscosity is very noticeable during the pour. Rich and sweet smelling, alcohol noticeable given the 15% ABV of this vintage. Bourbon notes -- oaky and sweet vanilla, meld nicely with typical strong stout notes of chocolate. Super-ripe fermented dark fruit, as if rum-soaked.  On the palate, very sweet but short of cloying. Heavy bourbon accent without being dominated by it. Alcoholic without being boozy (no burn). The huge flavors go right to the edge of the cliff without turning this into a hot mess. Surprisingly, I get more dark fruit than chocolate or coffee notes, but that may be the sweetness influencing perception. Unlike some beefy stouts, the carbonation doesn't fall off a cliff, which is nice given that this takes time to sip and appreciate.  If a fresh BCBS is this good, I can only imagine what it would be like once it matured. Truly a great experience for fans of bourbon and beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,smalenberg,4.76,"Bottle to standard pint  A - Oh the tempting vision of foamy used motor oil. Very, very, thick. Clings to the glass like a liquor. Deep toffee colored foam ring persists throughout.  S - Holy bourbon batman. Woody, smoky char of the barrel with the sweet bourbon character. Alcohol largely masks the subtleties of the malty grain character, but it is there if you are patient. And since this is a sipper, you'll have time.  T - Big malty sweetness with significant bourbon character. Very complex, but great fun to decompose as you enjoy. Some smoke, some woodiness, some tannins and lots of dark fruit (black cherry), sometimes reminiscent of black licorice, but only very late.  M - Thick and stouty, tingling alcohol. A beer you can really chew. You want to let each sip linger on your tongue. A beer that feels good to drink. Drying quality late.  O - This is a great beer that lives up to the hype. I had to wait in line to get ONE at my local specialty shop on the day it was released and I cellar-ed it for several months before enjoying it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Gatch,4.65,"Bottled on 11/07/12. First bottle drunk on 1/11/13.  A: I've never seen a beer pour this viscous. It didn't even make a sound from about six inches above the glass. A few bubbles but no head at all really.  S: Very sweet, plenty of bourbon, wood, earth, caramelized butter, brown sugar, a bit of bitter chocolate. The booze is strong.  T: Everything in the nose. Heavy barrel, heavy booze, heavy bourbon and sweetness. Black strap molasses.  M: Seriously massive flavor. The barrel qualities are exquisite. Super smooth, sweet, but not cloying. Not overly boozy either because it complements everything else.  O: Impressive stuff. A very big beer. Took a few hours to savor. I'm happy to have three more bottles to try over different lengths of time.  Updates:  On-tap 3/25/13 at Union Brew House in Weymouth, MA. 12oz. pour that I sat with for three hours chatting with a friend who also had a glass. Started out way too hot and boozy. As it warmed it became more enjoyable with huge chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Plenty of bourbon and barrel but not nearly as much as I expected. It was very exciting seeing it on draft at a local spot but it didn't blow my mind like I had hoped it would.  Second bottle of the 4-pack drunk on 6/8/2013.  Not much has changed from what I remember. But much fizzier, soda-like, brown head. Fades away very quickly, though. Still very sweet and super boozy. But definitely not as hot as the first bottle, which makes sense. The roasted, chocolaty, dark, coffee, big stout flavors show themselves a bit more because the alcohol isn't masking them as much after some time. Crazy smooth and thick with plenty of satisfying flavor. The ultimate sipper. Still needs more bottle conditioning. Excited for the third bottle at a year.  Third bottle consumed on 9/8/13. Wow, exactly three months apart. Didn't plan that.  This beer has mellowed out quite a bit. Not at first sip, but once it's allowed to breathe and warm up, it's so delicious. Also might have something to do with my being nearly through the entire bottle, and at this point feeling good from the high ABV. Just a crazy amount of bourbon, barrel, and roasted malt. Plenty of booze, chocolate, and molasses/caramelized sugar in the finish. Not the best beer out there but definitely one of the best sippers.  Fourth and final bottle enjoyed on 1/21/14. Now about a year and 2 1/2 months have passed since this was bottled on 11/7/12.  A: Poured this viscous liquid straight into the center of the snifter to create an impressive, finely bubbled, medium brown head. Smooth, fizzy, and very short-lived. Builds and dies quickly. No lace and a small ring of retention as well as some mighty fine legs!  S: Sooo mellowed out compared to the third bottle. It seems a year or more really does wonders. Rich dark chocolate accompanies dark dried fruits as well as some faint booze. Molasses, brown sugar...so complex. The bourbon and the barrel are distant at this point. They are much more noticeable in the nose than the taste, albeit still not standouts.  T: As in the nose, it's superbly rich, decadent, and mellow. So sweet, so flavorful, so complex. Yet simple at the same time. How so much can come from a beer is astonishing. This is as close as a beer can get before becoming a spirit or something like a cordial or port. The bourbon and barrel are extremely faint. What seems to have taken hold is dark chocolate. Seriously dark, bittersweet, rich, dark chocolate. As in, this is how I expect cacao/cocoa bean to taste right off the tree. Wow.  M: Well...ah...smooth. Luscious. Creamy. Chocolaty. Rich. Boozy. Other positive adjectives describing a delicious, huge BBA Imperial Stout. Can be pretty dry in the finish with a slight alcohol burn. But that's being petty.  O: The fourth bottle, aged over a year, is clearly the best. It also pushes my score of this masterpiece of a beer up. Glad I sat on these for so long. Seemed like a daunting task at first, but sadly a year passes too quickly. An amazing beer!  December 10, 2016  Vertical of 2014, 2015, 2016...thanks judkinst!  All are soooo smooth but the 2014 is the most refined. So much chocolate and booze and roasted malts. Wow. Serious stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Pinknuggets,4.38,Bottle to HFS sniffer  Waited a long time to try try this and more store in VT got 1 case and I got to buy 1 bottle 2 days ago so the ppl in MA that were complaining can't talk. That being said I hope it lives up to the hype.  A:Pours black as night completely opaque with a small mocha head that dissipates quickly and leaves almost no sign pretty good imo.  S: the main smell I get is bourbon and alcohol not much else there a little bit of dark fruit but that is it.  T: Upfront it is pretty heavy on the bourbon flavor but within five seconds or so that tastes to begin to get wrapped in a powerful dark and milk chocolate with heavy hints of coffee that is then balanced out as the coffee fades as does the bourbon but the dark chocolate remains lingering on the tongue for an impressive amount of time.  M: It is very oily and kind of thick but not overwhelming and definitely chewy but not super toffee like. There is a chocolate syrupy type feel to it in a good way as there is still a little bit of carbonation there  O: Does this beer live up to all the hype? I cannot really definitively say it is quite good but not mind blowing for me. The most impressive/surprising thing for me is the fact that the bourbon taste is not over powering even after the beer warms up. The alcohol is also pretty well hidden in the taste and feel particularly for how high it is that is impressive.

1549,10672,trxxpaxxs,4.37,"2012 vintage...  A: Pours pitch black with almost zero head. The only foam that exists is a thin mocha ring along the edges of the glass. This beer has some serious legs, and clings to the vessel for dear life.  S: The nose is huge malt, big booze, milk chocolate and a bit of raisins.  T: This beer starts of sweet, malty, and slightly of raisins. It coats the palate and the milk chocolate and raisins shine through in the middle. As it moves to the back of the palate, I get that familiar bourbon barrel aging heat. I tend to prefer my stouts more on the roasty and toasty end of the spectrum, but this is a solid brew.  M: Full bodied beer. It coats the palate, and lingers forever.  O: Overall, this is an excellent beer.

D: High abv will pump the brakes on having more than a couple. This is something worth savoring, please don't abuse it by taking swigs!

1549,10672,KFBR392,4.66,"Appearance: A beautiful dark roasted head color. Half a finger worth of head dissipated but held slightly around the glass. Dark as night with a reddish amber color around the edges.  Smell: Probably the strongest aspect of this beer. The bourbon plays a prominent role but yields to a dark fruit, molasses sweetness in the aroma. Not at all the aroma one would expect from a beer this a 15% abv.  Taste: Continued awesomeness. The caramelized sweetness makes itself felt right away. You get the slight heat from the bourbon in the after taste but is much more mellow then one would think. Roasted malt flavors dominate the undertones of this beer, playing along with the bourbon and caramel flavors. Once it hits the lips this beer gives a sharp tingle which makes you acknowledge what this beer is bringing to the table.  Mouthfeel: A complete laying is provided on the palette. Heavy and very chewy, this beer packs a punch. After the initial punch the smooth feeling of this beer settles in.  Overall: Goose Island Bourbon County products never disappoint. The depth of these beers is certainly among the elite.

Slow sipper for sure. Carbonation just right for the style (as in almost none)..  Overall this is a great example of the style, and one that benefits greatly from some aging to take some harshness off the bourbon finish.

1549,10672,withoutfailbrewmaster,4.98,"This is the beer that started my obsession with barrel aged brews in 2010. I just finished my first of my many four packs of the 2012 vintage. The local stores really benefited from the beefed up distribution. Amazingly its still on the shelves in Iowa! Now to the review that was compiled from 4 separate occasions. This is the best celebration beer known to man! all were bottled on 11/09/12 and poured into a snifter  A: I think its been said a time or two before. JET BLACK. This is a black hole in a glass. No light in or out of this puppy. I haven't tested it but would imagine its more viscous then used motor oil. Two of the four vigorous pours yielded a nice inch thick head, the other two minimal head.  S: Heavenly. Divine. Just inhaling the beer as it warmed in the glass prior to being consumed was almost intoxicating in and of itself. The bourbon cuts through a sublime blend of dark fruits and caramelized sugar, chocolate ,vanilla, and charred oak  T: I would dare to say this is the most complex beer that has graced my palate. So much going on. I absolutely love how the bourbon is prominent but not overpowering. The first of many tastes to tickle the tongue is the sweet dark fruit and caramelized sugar followed quickly by chocolate, vanilla, charred oak from the bourbon barrel and finally the bourbon reigns supreme on the on the finish while still allowing the previous flavors to linger only as if to pay homage to the king, bourbon. You can definitely feel the warmth from the 15% abv as it travels through your system. We had a blizzard and lost power for 8 hours at night in December and I swear the warming power of this beer kept me warmer than any blanket did. As this beer warms to room temperature the flavors intensify and become even more complex. the quickest i have drank this beer was just under an hour. Savor every sip.  M: This definitely coats the entire mouth. The swallow is the party and the lingering mouth feel is like the after party, it just keeps going. It almost resembled smoking a fine cigar, waking up the next morning and still being able to taste it and enjoy it! If there were an area for improvement for this beer i would maybe like just a little less coating but absolutely no complaints here! I think the think mouth feel adds to the necessity to drink this beer slowly, if you take another sip too soon, it still feels like you haven't finished the previous swallow.  O: Perfect. This IS the best beer that I have ever tasted. the most drinkable fresh from the 3 vintages i have had, 2010, 2011 and 2012. I am very excited to see how it ages and I enough to cellar to really see how well time will treat this. I still have 6 bottles of the elusive 2011 as well. This beer is not for the faint of heart! The holy grail of beers. I would actually argue that is this too good to be considered a beer and should just a category all on its own.  disclaimer: my wife does not like the taste of beer. She's a girly girl. After I taste a really good beer, she will have a sip of mine and almost without fail her response is an unimpressed, ""tastes like beer"". but my zeal for this beer has been passed on to her. After her first sip, she loved it and asked for her own glass. Talk about falling in love all over again!! she has shared this with me on 2 of the occasions and is excited to share this me with on many more. BCBS, you reign supreme. You might just have the honor of having my 2nd born child named after you...just kidding. that'd be silly. But seriously BCBS is AMAZING! Find it, Savor it.

Appearance - Midnight black with red hues. Pours with a quickly dissipating 2 finger tan head. For a beer that's 14%, it's amazing that the head was even there to begin with.

I really can't get over the soy though, it's partying right along with the bourbon and I love it. The taste is sweet, but not cloyingly so. Alcohol is definitely present on the back of the tongue and in the aftertaste, which is to be expected for the style.  Mouthfeel - Viscous. Oil. Thick. This might be one of the most viscous beers I've ever drank.  Overall - wow. You yanks weren't kiddin' about this beer. World class. Please don't ever let them change this.

Pours deep and black and mysterious like the soul of a really gothic dude. Not much of a head, but that's probably because the bartender was trying to give drinkers the biggest bang for the buck since the beer was goddamn expensive.  Maybe it was a little cold, but much of the complication of the bottle version (of fresher vintages, especially) was muted. There were big nodes of dark barley, fiery bourbon, and alcohol.  The joyous complication is much more apparent in the flavor, thank goodness. Fresh vanilla, vanilla extract, fire, stout malt, oak, whiskey, super ripe fruit, more fire, and cane sugar.

Smell: Bourbon, oak, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, raisins, dates and figs.  Taste: Definitely follows the nose. The beginning is a rich combo of chocolate and caramel that rolls into barrel goodness with some Bourbon underneath it all, but it's subtle. Where it's not subtle is in the boozy ending, that is ALL Bourbon and booze. However, make no mistake, for a 15% beer, this drinks a bit smaller than that, although it's still a bit hot at this young stage.That said, I've had KBS that was noticeably boozier in the end, despite being 4%ish abv less in strength.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, velvety and viscous as all hell. Perfect.  Overall: Although just a tad brash in its current form, it's still one hell of a beer.

Nice bourbon and its barrel alongside a nice, rich and sweet chocolate, molasses, and a kiss of vanilla in the finish alongside some nice unaggressive roasted malt.

Poured into a Founders snifter, and for the first time, I get a two-finger dark-caramel colored head, which recedes after just a few minutes,leaving basically no head at all, except for the ring around the inside edge. The beer is really black with small hints of dark ruby. It is thick and smooth in appearance.  Sweet and bourbon aromas blend up front, giving the beer a distinct and warm boozy smell. I also get malt, vanilla, maybe roasted coffee, and blackstrap molasses.  Taste is similar. It's all very sweet, with bourbon, molasses, and vanilla most prominent, followed by roasted malt and perhaps some light coffee and chocolate. The taste is truly amazing. It's also extremely smooth and creamy, with an amazing body and finish. Very warm on th end.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers, if not my favorite. It's just fantastic in every way. The Brand Stout is the only variety I have been able to get my hands on, but hopefully in the future I will get the chance to try them all.

1549,10672,FeDUBBELFIST,4.71,"$8.00 for 10oz, served in a tulip This year's vintage is 14.5% Sampled 26SEP12  [A] Served with a half finger of medium to medium dark brown bubbly head. Quick to recede and leaves no trace. What's left is a thick, ominously dark and very still beer. Black at its core and dark brown along the glass's edge. No chance for lacing.  [S] There's no hiding it. Bourbon strikes the nose first. But it's clean and extremely complimentary of the balance of the aroma profile. Dark bitter chocolate plus modest oak barrel and light vanilla adding the subtlety that such a robust aroma needs.  [T] Deeply roasted chocolate coating with a long lasting layer of rich, buttery caramel, lightly charred. Smooth bourbon integrates on every level. Moderate sweetness combined with ample carbonation cut through the bourbon barrel presence for a minute, which creeps slowly back onto the palate.  [M] The body lands between full and medium full. Ample carbonation and bitterness make a cloying texture and unnecessary residual sweetness an impossibility. But, a thicker, chewier mouthfeel would have been preferred. As well as a lower level of carbonation. (Interestingly, this isn't my typical experience on draft - and never from a bottle serving.) Lightly tannic. Alcoholic warmth is appropriate and welcomed.

L – Deep black color with a 3-finger bubbly brown head that rapidly dissipates into a thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. No lacing. For the strength of the beer, it’s not a bad look. These high-ABV barrel-aged beers tend to have rapidly fading heads.  S – Some chocolate and roasted coffee-like malts but mostly bourbon, vanilla, and plums. Really, mostly bourbon.  T – Follows the nose pretty closely. It starts off sweet with plum, chocolate, vanilla, and molasses and rapidly shifts to bourbon heat. As the heat fades, dark chocolate sweetness shines through.  F – Medium-to-full-bodied with not much carbonation, and sticky, mouth-coating, and hot feel, and a sweet and dry finish. Bourbon heat is definitely noticeable. This heat, along with a bit of sweet chocolate malt, lingers.  O – I keep having the impression that these bourbon-barrel aged beers will be mostly beer with a little bit of bourbon. I keep being disappointed. Maybe my impression is wrong, but I would really prefer a beer that is mostly beer with a little bit of bourbon. And I like bourbon.

Roasted cocoa nibs. Some burnt wood. But mostly booze.  T: Well balanced everywhere, given the ABV of 15%. A healthy dose of roasted barley, cocoa, and vanilla. Each playing off one another, then all enhanced by bourbon. The woodiness is not overwhelming, and resides subtly in the background and after taste. It's not as hot as one might imagine, but it gives way to a nice alcohol burn which is welcomed, because it is done right. There is a lot of hype around these barrel aged beers, but this one lives up to the high praise.  M: Carbonation is fairly low. Very warming on the tongue and throat. Body is medium, not as thick as I'd like it to be, but not disappointing.  O/D: It took me nearly two hours to drink, sip, and savour this beer.

Yes, this is complex. Not overly complex though. It tastes as strong as advertised. It's not rough exactly, but a bit bitter from alcohol. Definitely a sipper. Mouthfeel: Beautiful mouthfeel, low carbonation and completely full. Only complaint is the high alcohol dries out the beer at the end.

1549,10672,Jugs_McGhee,3.95,"12 fl oz 2012 vintage brown glass bottle with standard crown cap served into a Guinness goblet in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado. Expectations are through the roof.  Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a tan floater of nice cream and thickness. Retention is bad, but hey, it's 15%. Body colour is a solid jet black. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Roast, bourbon, oak, dark malts, caramel, and cream. An above average strength aroma.  T: Heavy bourbon and oak, caramel, vanilla, dark malts, coffee/java, and hints of vanilla. Impeccably balanced. Really well executed. Subtle and very complex. The alcohol doesn't come through at all. Really an incredible brew. Built near perfectly. Rich and delightful.  Mf: Perfect thickness and coarseness. Smooth and wet, aiding the flavours. Great palate presence.  Dr: Obscenely drinkable for the ABV. I'd definitely have this again. Would be good with some age on it. I'd buy this by the case. Lives up to the hype.  A  - 2013 vintage on 03.14.14:  The coffee notes I remember are absent, and this vintage comes across much less complex than I remember. I love the bourbon.  B+  -  04.18.14: 2013 vintage:  A: Pours a predictable head of avg retention. Body colour is opaque jet black.  Sm: Lovely bourbon notes. Just enough char. Burnt dark malts. Chocolate. Nice oak and vanilla presence. A pleasant aroma of mild to moderate strength. Quite appealing.  T/Mf: The barrel is very well integrated into the base beer. The bourbon notes are powerful and evocative, and it has just enough of a faint fusel burn. Dark malts and chocolate malts lend it a dark sticky sweet base. Molasses.  Complex and intricate. Very well balanced. An incredibly deep and tasty beer. High flavour duration and intensity.  Perfect carbonation. Smooth, silky, creamy, and wet. Unrefreshing.  Dr: She's a sipper, alright. Definitely worth buying. A treat of a bourbon barrel aged beer. This one has earned its reputation. I'll continue to revisit this beer in future years; it's worth it.  High B+  -  2013 vintage.  HEAD: Gorgeous rich tan colour with a shiny complexion. Half a finger in width initially, but it recedes completely within 30 seconds. I’ve seen better retention.  BODY: Opaque solid dark black in colour.  Appears aptly carbonated. Overall, it isn’t unique or special by today's standards.  AROMA: Bourbon through and through. Subtle hints of vanilla and oak abound. Not the toasty oak I love. Not very wood-y, which I personally like.  The bourbon notes are definitely dominant, but they don’t overwhelm the base beer. There’s ample malty sweetness – probably from dark malts and chocolate malts – but what I’m really missing is a roasted barley presence, which would really bring this together nicely. Don’t look for hops or yeast here – it’s all about the malts. As it warms, it comes into focus more: molasses, caramel, and kisses of faint burnt sugars and barrel char. Additionally, I’m finding coconut – which is a difficult note to pull off (even Avery Brewing can’t seem to manage it).  This aroma suggests a sticky sweet brew with a definitive bourbon barrel presence. The highlight for me is definitely the coconut presence, which is what I think sets this beer apart.  It’s a pleasant, inviting, rich aroma of moderate strength, and never seems boozy or overbearing. If I had it blind I’d probably guess it was 11% ABV.  Mf: Sticky. Slightly syrupy. Full-bodied. Thick. Not too filling. Smooth. Wet. Even with the subtle char and burnt notes, the texture's never harsh. Near perfect carbonation. Plenty of heft and weight on the palate. Soft. Palate presence is good.  Unrefreshing.  More of a roasted barley presence would lend it needed dryness/coarseness.  T: Simpler and more shallow than the 2009/2012 vintages  Roasted barley is absent.  The coconut is a highlight, blending well with the dark/chocolate malt core. Molasses and faint char set off the barrel.  Not a very woody brew, which I like. It does have a bourbon-soaked oak presence, but I prefer a more toasted oak character. The bourbon is lovely, evoking genuine vanilla but no whisky spice. ABV isn't noticeable.  It’s a well-balanced beer but isn’t as masterfully and carefully constructed as I remember. Build is cohesive, but not gestalt; I could change/add individual notes and it wouldn’t disrupt the flavour profile. Not as deep as it could be.  Remarkable subtlety and complexity. Coconut lends it nuance. I’ve had far more intricate imperial stouts, but this is hard not to like.  O: The best GI beer I’ve had. The definitive bourbon barrel aged stout. Still, I can’t help but think other brewers have taken what GI pioneered and done it more effectively.  B+  * 2015 vintage: Low B+  * 2016 vintage:  Call me crazy: pomegranate seed and wine barrel.

1549,10672,ThisWangsChung,4.27,"2015 vintage, 13.7%. (2.5/4.25/4.5/4/4.5)  This batch's aroma is a vanilla bomb. I mean holy fuck, this is one of the most vanilla-forward brews I've ever encountered. There seems to be less in the way of actual oak and bourbon qualities, though. I pick up some subtle chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit, and even umami notes in the nose, too. The flavor is ridiculously heavy in terms of not only vanilla, but also dark fruits. Figs, raisins, and currants dominate the flavor profile - it's almost redolent of the best Belgian quads. This one seems less oaky than previous years. By no means is it less bold or intense compared to previous vintages (it's every bit as good flavor-wise), it just offers something subtly different. The feel might be a touch more slender, however, but it still offers excellent thickness and presence on the palate. Oak tannins dry things out to an extent, while carbonation is low. No complaints about the 2015 version - this is a wonderful beer to sip on, plus it still makes me forget GI is owned by big, bad, evil AB InBev.  ---  2012 vintage (3/4.5/4.5/4/4.5)  I can't think of a more appropriate beer for review #300 than this one. 12 oz (2012 vintage) bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a wondrously pitch black color. However, there's hardly any head. Any vestiges of a tan-colored head fade quickly and leave almost no lacing. Really, we've got to start talking about alcohol legs when we get to this gravity. And they're pretty impressive.  S: Tons of bourbon, augmented by dark fruits and vanilla. Not much in the way of roasted malts; it pretty much hits on the sweeter aspects of a good imperial stout, rather than the more savory ones. It's really not that boozy for 15%, either. Not the strongest aroma ever (due to the low carbonation), but incredibly evocative.  T: Sweet? Yes. Boozy? Yes. The flavor I notice first are stewed plums, raisins, and figs - this has a hell of a dark fruit note to it. Ultimately, it will finish with its trademark bourbon character and vanilla-infused chocolate. A slight note of smokiness will appear after a while. It's warm, yes, but given its gravity, the booze could be a lot worse. Basically, it has the hallmark character of a proper boozy beer - an alcohol character that blends with the flavor profile instead of clashing. This definitely bears a passing resemblance to FW Parabola, only with a lot more in the way of finesse and balance. The only thing missing is some complexity; thankfully, what's there is very enjoyable to savor slowly.  M: The finish is ultra syrupy, wet, and sweet. Very creamy in its palate texture, aided by the subtle (at best) carbonation. Some oak tannins come out in the late aftertaste in an attempt to dry the palate a little, but to no avail. This really is the type of beer that sits indolently on the tongue with massive, thick sweetness. You will NOT drink this quickly, so don't even dare - just veg over it for an hour or two and everything will be peachy keen.  O: Well, what more can be said? It's a big monster, but with enough deftness and sophistication to help give it a little extra 'something'. On the other hand, there is enough harshness to suggest this needs to lay down in the cellar for a bit. Regardless, this is something everyone should try at least once in their life.  ---  After having bottle #2 at a more neutral temperature (about 50 F), it really opens up, losing a bit of sweetness and alcohol concealment - yet it gains tons of balance, subtlety, complexity, and drinkability. In its current state, it's not that far off from BCBCS; and I'd even surmise its less harsh at a warmer temperature. For that reason, I'm giving it a score bump.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Intense bourbon, caramel, and chocolate. A bit of roast behind that. As intense the bourbon aroma is in this beer, the chocolate and caramel intensity balances it. It certainly smells as though this beer will be sweet.  T: More if the same in the flavor. I get a huge amount of dark chocolate with caramel sweetness to balance. The bourbon flavor integrates with the caramel very well. These flavors really work together seamlessly and the dark chocolate keeps the beer from being too sweet and adds to the complexity. Roast is there, but way in the background.  M: Quite thick with low, yet prickly carbonation. The carbonation really takes away from the beer.  O: This is a huge Imperial Stout. Huge chocolate, huge sweetness, huge bourbon. And huge alcohol, too - this beer is boozy. Without the intense heat and with slightly stronger, creamier carbonation, this beer would be near perfect.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,falcon1,4.97,"First of all, I would like to thank SHIMP for hooking me up with a four-pack of Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout. I enjoyed my first bottle last night and I have to admit that it was truly an outstanding bourbon-barrel aged Imperial Stout! The aroma is amazing and it is chewy, creamy, and thick on the tongue. I believe that BCBS is a much better example of what the style should be than Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout. It is one of the few beers that I have encountered that truly deserves all the hype that it has received. I compared it, side-by-side, with a Great Lakes Barrel-Aged Blackout Stout of the same vintage year, and the BCBS was by far, the better beer. Very impressive to say the least.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mooseo,4.47,"12oz bottle into snifter.  A - Pitch black with a thin khaki head that quickly fades away.  S - Wow, lots of bourbon and vanilla on the nose. Chocolate and coffee as well. Reminds me of a sweet fudge brownie mixed with booze.  T - A heavenly blend of sweet roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, oak, and vanilla cream. Hints of spicy alcohol, coffee, and dark fruit throughout. Rich, complex, and delicious.  M - Insanely smooth and silky. Full body with low carbonation.  O - An incredibly viscous, tasty stout. The bourbon and oak really stands out and is a nice compliment to the sweet malt and dark fruit flavors. The high alcohol content is masked extremely well. This is a superb beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,HattedClassic,4.38,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Dogfish Head Snifter.  Appearance: Pours clean with not head. Even though the snifter is designed to get some of the carbonation to the top, I can tell it's struggling to find anything to push up and whatever rises to the top dissipates quickly. However, a ring of dark brown lacing does appear. The beer itself is pitch black and darker than Cheney's soul.  Smell: Hoo Boy. The alcohol is certainly noticeable even though the snifter isn't even in my hand. However, the strong alcohol smell does not detract much from the other notes. I can smell the bourbon barrel quite well. I get some hints of vanilla but not much chocolate or malt notes, which is a real shame. The chocolate starts to come out as it warms up.  Taste: I can taste vanilla with a little bit of alcohol. Fortunately, the alcohol does not detract much and adds some welcome flavor. I can get some faint hints of dark chocolate but the chocolate does not really come out until the finish. The chocolate becomes much more noticeable after it's warmed up a bit and it is DELICIOUS!!!!  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with little carbonation. The alcohol is a little warming but not burning.  Overall: A pretty good double-imperial but the KBS is clearly a superior one. I have no regrets shelling out money for this since it should keep me happy for the rest of a Boston winter. I recommend drinking this beer straight from the four pack and not putting it in the fridge. The chocolate seems easily muted.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Tons of alcohol legs which you'd expect from a 15%.  S: Huge vanilla and bourbon aroma. Getting some roasted coffee smell as well, but vanilla and bourbon smell is most prevalent.  T: Wow, Bourbon shining through with vanilla notes. Alcohol comes through, but not over powering. Some medicinal cherry notes as well. Alcohol burns lingers on the tongue.  M: Smooth, medium to full bodied, alcohol taste is pretty strong.  O: Very solid beer, I would love to get my hands on a few more and seem how it progresses.

1549,10672,macrosmatic,4.22,"Thanks to maximumu13 for this particular bottle. Drank fairly fresh, as this was the 2012 batch. Reviewed from notes. Poured into a Peg's snifter glass.  A: Very dark brown to black, minimal visible carbonation, forms a small tan head. The liquid appears oily in the glass.  S: Coffee, deep dark chocolate, big roasted malts, spices...all under the big dark oaky bourbon presence.  T: Follows the nose very well - coffee, cacao, vanilla, some dark spices, oak and bourbon. The bourbon seems somewhat heavy-handed.  M: Wow. I don't believe I've ever given a perfect score on a mouthfeel, but this is amazing here. Heavy oily body, a thick velvety sticky mouthfeel. Amazing. No particular carbonation sensation, and big alcohol presence (duh).  O: This was really good, and I can't wait to try more with some age on it. But honestly I was a little disappointed.

There seemed to be some light carbonation in the beer, which kept a small ring of bubbles afloat. Great lacing as the beer went down, too. The aroma was marvelous, with strong bourbon and vanilla dominating. The taste had quite a bit of the whiskey showing through, of course along with molasses, raisins, cream and loads of maltiness. The beer seemed medium-bodied and only just coated the mouth lightly, for a beer so rich in flavor. The very high ABV hid itself very well.

1549,10672,Beerandboards,4.59,"Had a 12oz of 2008 and a 22oz of 2009 on back to back days. Review is being written as I finish the 2009. Will mention notes of the 2008 as well.  Being in an area that doesnt even sniff BCBS distribution, I've been waiting to try this one.  A - Inky black, as advertised on the label. Little teeny bit of tan head on both the 08 and 09, that dissipates relatively quickly, little ring of bubble remain on the outside.  S - Both the 08 and 09 still have a cutting alcohol to them. Bourbon dominates, with some oak, vanilla. Smells nice, a little thin, but to be expected with the age.  T - Vanilla bourbon oak. Awesome. Nothing really more to add. Only complaint is that its still hot. I've never tried it fresh, but I imagine it would be way too hot for my taste. This feels like it would be perfect at about 9-10%. Not sure why the 13% is necessary. But, all that said, about as perfect as you'll find. I went back and forth on 4.5 or 5, the alcohol heat drops it from a 5. if 4.8 were an option, thats what I would rate it.  M - perfect. Mild carbonation at first fades to almost nil by the end of the glass. Thick, rich, awesome. No question on the 5 here.  O - Does it live up to the hype? Probably not, but thats much more to do with the hypeheads as opposed to the beer. Its a really really good beer. As a beer you can get off the shelf (in areas other than my own) it is unbelieveably good.

1549,10672,CraftBeerTastic,4.35,"Ba Review #246 Served On: 12/15/2012 Glassware: Duvel Glass Labeled ABV: 15.0% Date/ Code: 09/26/12 (2314)  This should be a real treat. It was a 12oz bottle from a couple 4-packs I lucked into at Ye Old Spirits Shop in Frederick, MD ($21.99 per 4-pack).  Look: Serious blackness as expected. An initial mocha colored head that settled down to a thin lace around the edges. Major alcohol legs coated the glass when swirled. Appeared very viscous.  Smell: Pungent bourbon oak vanillins with some earthy coconut and caramelized brown sugar. Also some molasses and semisweet dark chocolate.  Taste: Super think mouth feel. First up was a predominate alcohol sweetness with an earthy oak presence to offer some resistance to the accompanied whiskey heat (definitely a sipper here). An alcohol warmth starts at the tongue and followed clear down to the pit of the stomach. The caramelized brown sugar and chocolate appeared once the warming sensation subsided somewhere around the middle. The finish was more of the woody vanilla quality that had a slight coffee bitterness that almost didn’t quite register with all the sweetness on the palate.  This would have to be one of the most complex barrel aged ‘big beers’ I have ever had. It was definitely one to savor and enjoy over the course of many hours. I would definitely recommend cellaring this one for at least 5 or more years to help zero in to any true oak characters. The residual whiskey of a fresh bottle just seemed to distract from many of the other potential notes to be discovered in this beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dickieb,4.3,"2012 Vintage  Pours black as night with 1/8"" coffee colored head and leaves very little lacing. The smell is primarily that of bourbon, but with a nice whiff of dark chocolate and molasses in the background. The taste has allot more dark fruit and molasses then the smell but the overall flavor is based of the bourbon and manages to be extremely subtle with the booze while packing allot of flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect for a big beer letting you know its there while still not being like motor oil.

1549,10672,Hopfenpeter,4.82,"Poured into my crystal mug, the beer is pitch black, a small finger high brown bubbly head building, but dissipating instantly, leaving a small ring around the glass, to remind me that this is a beer! The smell is a beautiful composition of dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruit like plum or dark cherry. Tasting this beer, those complex tastes all hit at the same time, the alcohol slowly warming you up from the inside. The little carbonation in this Stout, is very welcome, but unusual. The very balanced flavor of this masterpiece slowly wears off the tongue, getting you ready for more. One of thebest Imperial Stout I ever had! A must try for the beer lover!

1549,10672,Dennoman,4.97,"2009 vintage 12 oz. bottle, poured into a Goose Island chalice. Review from notes.  NOTE: I've had three vintages of this beer in total, but I decided to contribute to this page with the best experience I had of it. I feel this brew benefits so greatly from having some age on it, that it hardly seems fair to review it fresh. To keep it short on the 2011 and 2012 versions: very boozy and aggressive. Both still fine beers, but nowhere near the stellar quality of the 2009 vintage. I decided to give this the best possible review, as it truly deserves that much.  A: Black as tar, with a dark caramel brown head that disappears immediately, leaving a small ring around the top. In short, this is how an imperial stout should look. As a Belgian, I'm a sucker for at least some head retention. High alcohol is no excuse for a beer not to have a head at all. I appreciate the fact that some stout fans believe there shouldn't be any visible carbonation in a beer of this style, but I like to be reminded that it's a beer. A minuscule detail, but a reason to deduct half a point no less.  S: Dude. Literally everything a big stout should have, wrapped neatly in one awesome package. Coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, molasses, candy sugar, vanilla, oak, and good dark fruity plum and cherry notes from the three years of aging. Every sniff yields something new and equally exciting: a true explosion of sensations. Little to no booze, which I contribute to it being a vintage as alcohol obviously tends to fade with age.  T: Big ticks on everything I mentioned in the smell category. First thing you get is bourbon roasty oak and vanilla sweetness. Then the coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malts come into play, followed by sweet notes of dark plum and grape. The coffee and chocolate come back on stage for an encore in the aftertaste, accompanied by a more cleansing bitterness that reminds you there are hops in here, subdued as they may be due to the colossal malts and bourbon in this brew. A little booze in the back of your throat then joins the party, but then leaves quickly because it still needs to go walk the dog. It might be a 13% beer, but every sip only invites you to tuck in for more. Absolutely glorious.  M: Thick, comforting, soft, boozy and warm. It's like being wrapped in a soft, cuddly blanket from the inside. The booze doesn't slap you in the face like it does in the more recent iterations, but flows from your mouth through your throat into your tummy and the tips of your fingers and toes in a zen-like swooping motion. Absolutely incredible.  O: I find it hard to still consider this a beer. It's poetry in a bottle. It's no secret I like me some Goose Island products, and I consider the 2010 Vanilla version to be the benchmark for vanilla bean-infused stouts. This 2009 vintage of the regular BCBS, however, kicks it up an extra notch. The subdued booze and budding dark fruit notes just make this into a perfectly balanced and immensely drinkable beer, the likes of which I've yet to see beaten by any American imperial stout. I don't know whether all stars aligned on a perfect amount of alcohol (which sadly isn't consistent throughout these vintages) and the general recipe, but this is simply amazing. If it reaches this level of perfection after 3 years, I fear that Rare - which I've yet to try/review - might be past its peak as it was brewed in 2008. We can only try though, and I have a feeling I won't be disappointed regardless.  tl;dr: YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,gcamparone,4.6,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an oversize wine glass. Purchased in Wakefield, Rhode Island.  A- Pours a jet black body with a small 1/2"" dark brown head that leaves very little lacing and reduces quickly. Although the head is tiny, it's color is beautiful. The retention is understandable considering the high ABV.  S- After a few swirls, I get a heavy bourbon aroma which can be further characterized by a combination of french vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, and brown sugar with some dark chocolate in the far background. Extremely inviting so far. No alcohol on the nose.  T- The first touch on the tongue reveals some sweet caramel, french vanilla, and milk chocolate notes. This soon fades into a woody bourbon-vanilla flavor. This brew ends with cocoa, dark chocolate, and bittersweet roasted malt notes. It leaves a chocolate-bourbon flavor on the tongue for a while.  M- Every aspect of this brew is awesome, but this is where it really shines. Outstandingly thick and cream. Silky and smooth with very low carbonation. I believe this is the first time I've given a beer a 5 in this category.  Overall an excellent, flavor packed, balanced, complex brew that will instantly light up the eyes of any BA beer fan. Unique and well done, the flavors of a stout and a bourbon aged beer intricately worth together to produce an excellent creation. Definitely a sipper.

Stunning appearance, with no lacing. Alcohol legs are obviously noticeable.  S- Super rich on the nose! Plenty of bourbon, with some vanilla, oak, and fruit. Alcohol is noticeable, alongside the raisin/fig sweet smell, which is quite enrapturing.  T- Sweet molasses, dark fruits, and vanilla blend very well with the bourbon. This is boozy as hell, but not so much that it is intolerable. In fact, I really like the alcohol heat. This is super rich! Nice smooth, velvety mouth feel.  O- This is the best stout I have ever tasted. I love the richness and the booze and everything else about it.

Overall: This was a completely amazing beer, but I don't think I was as blown away with this as I thought I would be.

1549,10672,JayS2629,4.47,"I have to admit this was an amazing stout. The appearance was thick and dark black, but a small thin ring of quickly fading white head. You could hear fizz. Not much for the head, but nice alcohol legs.  The aroma was dark with fudge-like notes, dark chocolate, raisins, vanilla and bourbon. I didn't age this, so it was a bit fumey with the booze notes. Woody oak play off vanilla tones and subtle coffee tones.  The flavor was complex with dark fruits and sweet bourbon. Vanilla and dark chocolate linger with hints of coffee and some earthy tones. Big, rich notes of raisin and fig. Again, didn't age it so the bourbon slightly overwhelmed things.  The mouthfeel was rich and velvety. A little boozy, but nicely warming. I got a buzz from 6 oz. on an empty stomach.  Overall, I should let the next one I get age, but it was still one of the best stouts I've had. I can only imagine letting it mellow with some age.

As instructed on the bottle, I poured it into a sniffed and was in awe. It poured a thick, deep dark black and i was struck by The fact that there was no head. As in none. What so ever. Upon my first inhale of the aromas and my first taste, all worries were thrown to the wayside. Vanilla, chocolate and the bourbon are all right there in the nose, as well as on the palette. This beer tastes as it should but the booze, @ 15%, while pretty evident straightaway, isn't too overpowering. It may have slightly mellowed in booziness as it sat, but fear not, this is an amazing stout. As I described it earlier: When i opened it I feared it like a bad first date...no head.

L - jet black with only the slightest trace of head: a thin, fizzling, mocha brown layer that disappears as quickly as it came. Poof! It is very black tho.  S - huge bourbon character that hits all the right notes. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate. Heavy oak presence. Very woodsy, like inhaling fresh, crisp forest air in the middle of winter.  T - lots of bourbon, lots of rye. Burnt coffee grounds. Biting, aggressive oak character, like dragging your tongue across the inside of the barrel. Bittersweet cacao and a toasted caramel flavor, like the skin of a golden-brown marshmallow (but not the mallow itself--just the fried skin!) Raisin, dates, plums. Finishes with a raw alcohol bite. The booze tingles my lips. Love this beer after a few more years on it, but it's still great while young.  F - somehow manages to be light and bouncy, but with a supple silkiness. Surprising amount of carbonation for how long it has aged. Maybe just a little bit infected? ;)  O - the best. One of the biggest and boldest stouts that never disappoints.

I can't make out the amount of carbonation showing and there isn't much lacing. The head lasted for only 2-3 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Malts, chocolate, light smoke, nuts, bourbon  Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and some roasted/toasted nuts. There is also a bit of a smokiness and a bitter coffee flavour and a bit of vanilla. I can also really pick up on the bourbon and the beer gives a nice warming feeling. It ends with a bourbon and chocolate aftertaste.  Overall - I've never had this fresh, but this 2009 seems to have held up well.

1549,10672,Chaz,3.86,"Pours inky-black/lampblack and after the immediate rush of carbonation passes -maybe a couple of minutes- appears to be quite still, topped with a medium-dark brown ring of lace, and the barest spots of head. Head was a similar -though billowing- color, and provided the proper degree of visual appeal before dropping to rest after a minute or two.  Not a bad first impression, but this one's all about the nose; plummy, rummy, raisiny, and full of bourbon (and tannic, woody/barrel) notes. This nose is worth the price of admission*. Light booziness on the nose, but it's appropriate and does nothing to distract. Rather, this one invites you to dive right-in and forget your momentary cheating spouse, missed mortgage payment, or that fender-bender on the way home from the office.  On the first sip it's everything you'd expect from that splendid nose, and perhaps even more. Lightly sharp/brisk carbonation propels this across the palate and a gently-bittersweet character gives way to notes of dark, ripened and dried fruit, chocolate/cocoa, cherry heering, and then the wood-aged notes propel it again! Alcohol is a significant factor in ""BCBS"" to be sure, but not enough to distract; again, the ABV is there on the label, and the barrel-aged stout is nothing I haven't tangled with before. But some will need to cut their teeth on a 'lighter'-strength barrel aged beer?  No matter. The taste lasts and last, and while there's an undeniable sweetness here, this batch (fresh/2012) is good to go -- unlike e.g. Dogfish Head's ""World Wide Stout"", which always benefited from a year or four in a dark cellar to mellow its heat accordingly.  On my second sip I get hints of ""coconut"", anise/licorice, and another berry . . . currant? Blackcurrant to be precise. In addition to WWS, this one also reminds me a lot of the infamous ""Brimstone Big Ale"" (which reputedly ruined Wild Goose) and even a soy/maple flavor akin to Samuel Adams' Triple Bock! None of these notes or pleasant reminders are off-putting in the least -- quite the opposite, in fact.  Finish is somewhere between sweet and dry; for a beer this big and sweet, it's remarkably dry on the finish, and easy to drink. Dangerously-drinkable? Certainly! Which is why I like to split a single 12 oz bottle with a friend, and would recommend anyone interested in 'moderation' (or even Moderation) to do the same.  Worth trying, but might be hard to find.  *A good cigar would probably pair well with this brew, as would a rich, hearty cut of pork loin slathered with caramelized onions and roasted potatoes.

The only ever so slight drawback is how the sweetness lingers on the finish, a minor complaint and I'm sure some age will help mellow this a bit.  m- Very sticky, moderate carbonation. Slightly warming.  o- What's left to say? Goose Island brings it yet again and puts to bed any worries about a dip in quality due to the AB-INBEV purchase.

1549,10672,minterro,4.62,"2012: Wow I've been looking forward to trying one of these bourbon county stout... well for as long as I could remember. Never actively tracked one down, but luckily Spartan Spirits in East Lansing had a couple of them singled out so I snagged one.  Cracked it open tonight celebrate completing my last undergraduate science lecture. It is weird to say the least and I look forward to learning much more about this wonderful field as a graduate student next fall.  A&S: upon opening the bottle the bourbon hits you immediately, but is soon counter-balanced by some rich chocolate sweetness and roasty tones. It also contains some slight marshmallowy tones. The aroma is very powerful and is not subdued as time passes. when it is poured the becomes even more fragrant but with more of a bourbon and dark fruit side to it. The liquid is dark black and very think as it is poured out. Even when poured with vigor, there is no head to be found.  T&M: Right away I would probably have to say this is absolutely my favorite bourbon stout I've every tried and probably top 5 beers ever! Maybe for people who like super bourboney stout this one might not be as perfect, but to me its a slice of heaven. I haven't had a more balanced stout in my life. The rich dark chocolate, dark fruits, and bourbon are perfectly blended to create this craft brew masterpiece. Upfront you get more the the dark chocolate and fruits. Alcohol makes it self present but doesn't overpower (I wouldn't ever think this was 15%). The finish leans more on the bourboney side but is well mixed with some sweetness to balance, goes down very smooth, and leads to a mellow version bourbon warming feeling. Extremely rich and filling. The mouthfeel is out of this world so elegantly smooth and thick it has a consistency of real maple syrup.  Overall: This beer is amazing. Absolutely a champion of not only its style, but as far as craft beer go. I had high expectations for this beer and its still was better then I thought it could ever be. At the price of about $6.50 a bottle, its going to cost you a pretty penny. But as a one in a while special occasion thing, this is going to be my new go to.  4 4.5 5 5 4.5 === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === 2013: bottled 11/7/13 and rated 12/18/13 Bought from Little's Wine and Liquor for 5 bucks, compared to 6.50 this is a steal. No special occasions this time, just flying out to MI for christmas break and figured its the right time. Drank while watching moonrise kingdom.  A&S: Jet black and the pour seems very thick. Head is mocha and last a very short amount of time. Lots of bourbon upfront, way more than I remembered or noted from the 2012 rating. Also some interesting and uncharacteristic banana bread tones. The banana tones are at times even more powerful than chocolate. As it warms dark fruits come into play, plums is what I'm smelling the most.  T&M: I was again expecting this beer without aging to be very hot, but its really tasty/enjoyable without the alcohol completely overpowering the taste. The spot the alcohol content does make it self known is the very pleasant warming it leaves behind. The bourbon for sure comes on hotter as it warms (more than I expected). Again very smooth, but not as much body as I recall. More carbonation too.  Overall: Was interested to see how it compared to the 2012 versions. I bought two so I could do a 6 month or year cellared rating as well. I would say I liked the 2012 version a tad bit more, but this years beer is still top notch.  4 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === ===  2013 version bottled 11/7/13 consumed 06/17/14.

Also sweeter than I recall.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,StonedTrippin,4.45,"a spectacular imperial stout. one of the biggest ive ever encountered. on tap at j. ryans in syracuse, and served in a pint glass for 8 bucks! was sure id never get to try this after the recent sale, but got one from the beer gods. the pour is really black and sticky looking, with only a film of dark dark brown head. the nose is insane, tons of charcoal and wood, this spent some time in a serious barrel. theres also some dried fruit, raisins or something, and fresh tobacco, dark chocolate, vanilla, and loads of booze. the flavor is just as complex and intimidating as the nose, with alcohol and cocoa being key notes. old well used oak is in play as well, as is some pungent vanilla beans, lots of residual sugars and black licorice. this is really one of the most potent and memorable beers ive had, worth all the hype. the feel is pretty darn heavy, massive body, decent but light carbonation, and a really sticky sludgy feel, like pine pitch or taffy. the whole outside of my glass was like super glue from the little bit that spilled over during the pout. overall an impressive beer, this couldnt be anyones daily drink, but it sure makes a special occasion, i am grateful to have gotten to try this, and i certainly got my fill from that pint. a luxurious and daring brew, a must try if you can get ahold of it.  edit: just had a bottle from the 2014 vintage, which is five years old now, and its held up as well as expected. perhaps trace oxidation getting into it, but nice evolution in the bottle too, more cocoa and dark chocolate character than ever, still plenty of smooth whiskey, and a general richness and heft than make this one so recognizable. thanks to a new buddy for sharing this, makes me that much more excited for the older bottles in my cellar!  edit: had another 2014, now nine years old, definite malt fade and oxidation creeping in, still a ton of body, bourbon, vanilla, and roast, but losing some of what makes it special at this age. these do well in the cellar obviously, but this vintage has certainly peaked before the ten year mark...",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,notjaredlouche,4.35,"Bottled on 9/20/12. Poured into a Sam Adams glass around 50F or so (warm bottle stuck in freezer for 30min).  Appearance - pours a thick very dark brown, almost black. Looks almost exactly like used motor oil. I had up to a one-finger head while pouring, a minute later I now have a 2mm head. Thick lacing on the glass. Once in a glass, it takes on more of a reddish-brown hue.  Smell - chocolate and vanilla. A bit of that bourbony smell, but it's not overpowering. Definitely a better smell profile when poured into a glass - if you just smell from the neck of the bottle, all you get is strong alcohol.  Taste -Difficult to pick this one apart. The bourbon taste is most noticeable, there are other tastes which become more apparent on the back end, mostly vanilla and chocolate, as with the smell. The bourbon taste lingers the longest.  Mouthfeel - interesting, since it comes into the mouth very smooth, then you get the mild carbonation bite, and then it exits the mouth as smooth as it came in. Very heavy, almost syrupy.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DaveAnderson,3.1,"2012 bottle poured vigorously into a Darkness tulip. Or as vigorously as I could manage, because I couldn't get the stream from the bottle to be anything but smooth and coherent. This must have some viscosity to it.  And while that's kind of cool, it's also a disappointment, because the beer develops almost no head at all. It's not the darkest beer I have had, but it's close. Light permeates only the very edges.  I've had '07-'12, and this one has the least-alcoholic smell of the bunch, despite having the most alcohol. That's a rather interesting accomplishment. I'm getting a lot less bourbon on the nose than previous versions, and perhaps that's why. There's the expected bourbon, oak, and vanilla in there, but also something unexpected: coconut. I am detecting a lot of coconut here. Other than that, it's a little simple. Nothing new develops as it warms.  OK, the taste backs one thing up -- this has less bourbon character than past years. It has a really intense coffee flavor that reminds me of the coffee candies my grandmother used to keep in a dish. It finishes slightly sour, and with a lingering bitterness. As it warms, it strongly evokes black licorice.  I can only imagine that I would have liked this more if it were even moderately carbonated. It just coats the mouth, and doesn't let up. That would be fine if this were earth-shatteringly delicious, but it's not.  Halfway through the bottle, I'm finding this a chore to finish.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,flayedandskinned,4.57,"Bottled on date: 9/20/12 Poured into a Duvel tulip. Big thanks and shout out to MykelJH for hooking me up with this beast! Truly appreciated, brother!  Appearance: Pours an intimidating, impenetrable pitch black. Dark as a cloudless night in a forest. Half finger of a dark khaki head with no lacing and plenty of alcohol legs as it recedes. Sexy.  Smell: Big Bourbon as soon as I crack the cap. Dark, sweet molasses peeks in as well as some rich, dark fruit notes underneath it all(think caramelized fig flesh). Notes of oak; vanilla and extremely faint coconut.  Taste: My god, the nose does not lie. BIG bourbon flavor, rich dark chocolate, oak tannins, vanilla. Some port-like flavors here. What an AMAZING flavor! Sweet, but not cloying. Warming, sweet alcohol not nearly as present in taste as you would expect a 15% beast of a beer would taste like. Really long off dry finish. You can taste this beer for hours after you're finished. Absolutely incredible.  Mouthfeel: Thick, viscous, sticky, slick and oily. Outstanding soft carbonation that really lifts up the syrupy, intensely flavorful liquid off of your palate. Some light tannin presence and texture on your tongue. Perfect mouthfeel for the style.  Overall: OUTSTANDING. Completely lives up to the extremely high hype for this beer. Definitely worth every penny of the price. Every serious beer lover needs to experience this beer.

1549,10672,KYGunner,4.69,"I'll preface this review by saying I don't like bourbon casked stouts.  I poured this thick black stout into a snifter, with limited carbonation and no head. The appearance is unlike any ale I've seen, as it looks like motor oil and has the same consistency. The scent is of a Sherry or a port with notes of vanilla, cocoanut and a touch of alcohol. Very nice, sweet and fragrant. The taste is exceptional and I don't like bourbon. Tons of complexities, I taste raisin or prune, sweet vanilla, very little bourbonlike harshness but hints of Kentuckys finest. As one with limited palate skills I noted several other tastes that I simply can't define and makes me anxious to try another. Also, I am not one for mouthfeel but this holds prominence over anything I know. Smooth, thick but zero alcohol harshness it's warm going down and perfect for a winter night.  This is the first bourbon casked stout that I've enjoyed and ill probably start to seek others out, my experience with this one is that good.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MattyG85,4.77,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Surly Darkness chalice glass. 2012 Vintage bottled on 11/08/12.  Appearance: Pours dark, oily, and completely black with a moderate amount of carbonation. Small tan head that fades away very quick into nothing. Lacing is fairly light on the glass.  Smell: A huge aroma that is thick, roasty, sweet, and boozy. Dark roasted malts with big hints of chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, toffee, and smoke. The barrel aging shines here with good hints of bourbon whiskey, oak, vanilla, and wood. Thick molasses with a hint of maple syrup. Undertones of dark fruits including raisins, dark cherries, plum, and fig. Light hints of earthy hops in the background. Alcohol scent is very noticeable as expected. Smells pretty sweet and rich with a quite complex mix.  Taste: As big, thick, and rich as the smell leads on. Roasted dark malts with a taste of chocolate, burnt caramel, coffee, toffee, biscuit, and smoke. The barrel taste is pretty big with notes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and wood. Sweet burnt molasses with a little maple syrup taste. A little anise spice. Big undertones of dark dried fruits including raisins, plum, dark cherry, and fig. A little hop presence is there but its light compared to the malts. Taste of alcohol is noticeable but actually fairly tame considering the ABV. Tastes pretty sweet but manages to avoid becoming too syrupy. Really great taste.  Mouthfeel: Big thick body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Creamy, slick, and fairly syrupy. Some alcohol heat is felt but it isn't overbearingly hot.  Overall: A really great imperial stout. Big in every way and the complex flavors blend together great. Goes down fairly smooth considering how huge it is.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Can_if_you_can,4.74,"....wow. i dont know how to describe this beer in a way that will give it justice. if i could rate it a 6 outta 5 i would! every thing about this beer is PHENOMINAL! but im just gonna focus on the taste. oh except for the look the slickest thick blackest black i've ever seen in a beer.  Initially shocks the palate with bourbonyness, i mean was this aged in barrels or did they just straight up pour a bottle of bourbon in this pig. some oakiness apparent as well but slight. the boozyness is well masked...initially, i will get to that in a bit. then theres all kinds of beautiful gnarly radical goody grandiose cool groovy flavors that all come out and dance around, this stuff is COMPLEX! i get some caramel, toffee, sweet roasted malts and then awesome coffee flavors all perfectly balanced with bourbon and swirling/dancing on my palate. then the enitre time the most exquiset (spelling?) silky smooth mouthfeel ive expirienced... finally after all of those flavors are dancing / battling for the predominant flavor to rise to the top, it continues in the aftertaste wich lingers for well over a minute. FINALLY after about a minute and a half the booziness comes out...slowly...subtley but DEFINATLY there. starts in the back of the throat then works its way slowly down the esophogus warming but not burning as it descends and actually warms the stomach upon contact leaving me blissfully and comfortably numb.... PERFECT BEER IN EVERY WAY! (for this style) wish i could crack open the last kbs thats in my fridge just to do a side by side, im leaning towards this one being the winner in that EPIC battle.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RichD,4.97,"My first review!  2012 Vintage poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A: Pours a brilliant black. Poured without a head but the head would have been a mocha color. This bastard is quite opaque as I cannot see through it when I hold it up to the light.  S: I smell bourbon, some vanilla, bourbon and more bourbon. If the taste is anything like the smell then I'm in for a damn good treat.  T: Upon first sip it's like someone threw a bourbon bomb to explode onto my taste buds. The bourbon intensity is incredible. There's a little burn to it but nothing that takes away from the taste. Strong vanilla notes which contributes to the ultimate sweetness of the chocolate and dark fruits. Outstanding  M: I swished this mother around my mouth like Listerine and I didn't get the feel that this was 15% ABV. Once again, excellent.  Overall: I understand now why I spent 20 bucks on a 4 pack. This is well worth it. This was my first experience tasting Bourbon County and I know that some age will definitely maintain the awesomeness of this brew. The hardest part will be to not drink all of them. Outstanding beer and this definitely sets the standard for all other barrel aged stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,argock,4.57,"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear large glass snifter. Bottled on 11/07/12 on back label. Purchased as 4-pack from Market Street Wineshop (Charlottesville, VA) for $22.99.  A: Black with short cap of dark tan head with minimal retention and no lacing.  S: The aroma is good not great with big chocolate and dark fruit aromas of fig, raisin, and dates. The bourbon component is so artfully woven into all aspects of this beer, starting with the aroma, where it provides some bitter aromas and a liqueur-like character.  T: The flavor of this beer fresh from the bottle is exceptional and above my expectations. The dark fruit maltiness is heavy on raisin and fig, but with a lot of dark toasted breadiness that is snapped with a big dose of baker's chocolate, more sweet than bitter, and then a soft undercurrent of bourbon to fill out a fantastic stout. The alcohol is moderate but not overbearing a provides some light berry qualities - I would love to see this beer be a little lighter in the ABV -- maybe 11-12%. The chocolate is more prominent than I remember from the on-tap sample I tried at the brewery 2 years ago. This is a phenomenal beer with lush flavor and a smoothness in the flavor. They seem to have deliberately kept the roast nature subdued and allowed more sweet aspects through. I contrast this with fresh Bells Expedition Stout which is pretty heavy on the roast which seems to fade some with time.  M: The mouthfeel is extremely chewy with a full body and low carbonation.  O: This is a great beer that I am grateful is distributed (albeit in limited quantities) to VA. I am going to try one every 2-3 months and see where I like it best. It is hard to imagine it will get a lot better than fresh -- I see why people like it fresh because the bourbon component is accenting and nothing more, it doesn't need toning down. BCBS is a phenomenal beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MadScientist,4.68,"A: Extremely dark brown but allowing some light through showing deep garnet highlights and good clarity. The head doesn't last too long probably from the high ABV but what is there is a dark brown, creamy bubbles with a lasting ring around the glass.  S: Strong aromas of bourbon and roast. The moderately-strong oak smelling more like toasted coconut than anything probably from the cinnamon combining with the roast and sweet malt notes. There isn't much in the way of hops coming through. There is a moderately-strong alcohol aroma that is kind of flowery. A moderately-low chocolate character with a faint molasses aroma as well.  T: The flavor matches the nose with a bourbon, chocolate and a cinnamon oak flavor, fairly strong roast medium hops bitterness. Nothing much for hops flavor coming through the other strong flavors. There is a some moderate malt sweetness which is more than balanced by the hops bitterness and alcohol. The finish is off-dry with an aftertaste of chocolate and hops bitterness.  M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a big smooth alcohol warmth.  O: An outstanding oak aged with a lot of bourbon character. The overall smells and flavor is like that of coconut covered burbon chocolates.

Side poured with standard vigor from a bottle into a snifter.  Appearance - No head or lacing at all. Pours the consistency and color of used motor oil, thick, rich, and creamy even from the pour. Jet black. Cool basic packaging, the hype and name speaks for itself.  Smell - The lowest marks I gave this beer are here. I smelled strong bourbon, dark fruits, a hint of vanilla, and a little malt. Whoa the bourbon is overpowering though.  Taste - Straight up OMFG. Smooth, creamy vanilla and malt notes wash over the tongue, followed by dark chocolate, fruits, and the prime mover, bourbon. The booze on the palate is strong, but easily digestible. This is seriously one of the best tastes I have ever experienced. So simple, yet so deliciously balanced and powerful.  Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth, creamy, and boozy. Coats the throat in alcoholic warmth.  Overall - Seriously, buy this beer and drink it posthaste. One of the best, if not the best, I have ever had.

Head collapses to a small ring around the glass. This beer is the definition of opaque black.  S - Boozy bourbon is easily recognized. Vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses. The roasted malt is very complex. Little undertone of ripe red fruit. Wonderfully complex.  T - Very silky creamy feel right away. Starts with an ultra rich caramel flavor. Little bits of sweetness throughout but sporadicly. There is a tobacco flavor mid-palette. Somewhat burnt at times but smooth at another, a little more burnt later on. The richest chocolate finish along with a reminiscent flash of rich french vanilla cappuccino. Aftertaste as you would guess is forever lasting.  M - Full body, light carbonation, semi-sweet.  O - Very tough beer to identify the many many flavors. Am I drunk or just impressed because I'm now repeating myself? This little 12oz beer is to be shared amongst friends. I think this is a great beer, hard to even place in an Imperial stout category because it can stand alone at 15% ABV.

1549,10672,RickS95,4.38,"Pitch black color, pours thick like used engine oil. Probably the darkest, thickest pour I've had. Despite the high ABV, there is a head, it's thin, but it's there. Maybe a third of a finger thick and a reddish brown color. Little retention, but I was surprised there was a head at all.  Serious malt bomb. Lots of caramel, some smoke, definite bourbon scents come wafting up. It smells sweet if there is such a thing, but mostly it's just alcohol and malt.  The alcohol is very present, but it's not overpowering. I mean, it's strong and all, but for 15% ABV, you're allowed to taste the malts. It's got a caramelly, almost sorghum taste to it. Maybe some chocolate or coffee to give it a smokey flavor, not quite sure.  It's very sweet, on the edge of being too sweet. Smokey. Extremely thick and full bodied. Heat from the alcohol is strong, but not a deal breaker. Zero carbonation and no sign of hops, normally a bad thing, but this is a malt bomb so I expect that.  I'm normally not a fan of bourbon beers, but this is pretty good. It's like the sweetness battles with the alcohol and the effort balances each into a workable beer. Very strong, a sipper where only one is plenty. Glad I was able to find this and happy I bought a 4-pack.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BMMillsy,4.85,"Pours jet black with a teeny tiny brown head even with a relatively aggressive pour. Aroma of heavy bourbon and more vanilla than I have smelled in a barrel aged before. Small bit of roasted grain. Bourbon flavor explodes on the palate up front even more than I expected. Lasting vanilla & cocoa after swallowing that is pretty intense. As it fades there is an additional punch of chocolate and hint of espresso out of nowhere. Very complex. Heavy on the palate, very warming. Just the right level of sweetness. Want more...  Tried a fresh batch of 2013 on tap and have more to say. This year the beer seemed a little on the thinner side. As it warmed and as I had it with my food, and interesting cinnamon-like note came out which was not expected. Overall still excellent but not the same viscous chocolate experience I had with the previous year's version.  OK, now tried a 2013 bottle. Something strange about the on-tap version. The bottle pours viscous, and that viscosity carries over to the mouthfeel. Full, big, velvety, and smooth carbonation. The flavor is right on with chocolate, beautiful vanilla, bourbon, anise, and wow this is yum. This is what I except from this beer. It delivered.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,micromaniac129,4.47,"Sat in my garage for about a month before I gathered my balls to drink one. Very fragrant with a big boozey bourbon nose that felt like it burned my nose hairs away. The whiskey aroma is 90% of the aromatics. Others include dark fruit like raisons chocolate oak barrels and coconuts. The appearance is deep dark brown really black. Pours thick into my glass like a melted milkshake. A small head sits on top and fades quickly. Mocha brown in color. While the foamy head might be gone, a simple swirl in my yeti sniffer brings it back showing at least that there is a fair amount of rentention in there. Taste is licorise, chocolate whiskey barrels bourbon and booze. At 15% abv I'd say it's hidden quite well even though I can still taste it's warming affects. There is a dry lingering aftertaste. I had this beer at about 50F and it didn't really taste all that sweet but as it warmed in my sniffer it definitly sweeten up, alot, to the point of almost overwelming. Drinks smooth and heavy on the palette with some dry bitterness on the palette. A good beer with good depth of flavor but I only bought it to cross it off my beer of fame list .

1549,10672,AmitC,4.58,"So my first Bourbon county brand stout... bought at $5.5 a piece 12oz bottle.  Poured into a large snifter a 2012 stout bottled on 19th July.  Little head of bright shining golden tan color. Head soon disappears into a thin shining ring. Appearance is pitch black in the glass. While pouring, it is dark brown like engine oil. Thick and sturdy. Slight to decent lacing.  Aroma : Roasted malt aroma that seems well burnt. Slight hint of chocolate, alcohol and caramel. Doesn't really smell (and later taste) like a 15% ABV beer.  Taste :Very well balanced taste. Nicely hidden alcohol. Slight bitterness of hops and some burning like that of a 8% alcohol. Slightly sweet but dry finish.  Mouth feel :Absolutely thick and smooth. Full bodied. Moderate carbonation.  Style rate : 4.5 Personal : 4.75 just for the alcohol and balance. I have spent over 5 bucks so it does deserve that. Value for money not so much.

T- Chocolate and bourbon right away, nicely balanced though, hints of vanilla and candied fruit are next followed by some nice roast malt notes and hints of wood char. Finish is dry and with a slightly bitter sweet note of dark chocolate.  M- Smooth and creamy, more than medium in body, but not overly heavy. There is almost no carbonation but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of this one.  O- Wow, great beer, on par with the best bourbon aged beer I have had. The 15% ABV is well hidden, I knew it was going to be high, but I had to look it up and read it twice to believe that it was that high.

Very nice  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the chocolate and bourbon, which slowly moves into the other barrel notes of vanilla and oak. Roasted malts all the way through. Fairly sweet, but not too bad. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, it doesn't seem like it's even over 10%. Impressive  M: Full bodied with low carbonation. Creamy, smooth  O: After drinking this, I can definitely buy into the hype. So good, so complex. Just make sure to take your time, as the 15% is not noticeable. Worth the $$ for the 4-pack.

This is a very aromatic beer featuring generous roasted malt, coffee grounds, vanilla, brown sugar, hints of wood and of course bourbon.  The flavor is similar but with more vanilla presence, more sweet than roasted yet there is a coffee presence to accompany the generous bourbon and woody notes. The bourbon and roasted malt relationship is a delight to the senses.  This stout offers a big chewy body with medium carbonation and a warming alcohol presence amidst the woody, bourbon finish.

Per the staff this was the first shipment, first time I've seen this in Maine...Thanks AB-InBev distribution channels!  A- I poured vigorously but only resulted in one finger head that was gone within seconds and resulted in a beer that was flat looking. Not sure of how much I can blame the high ABV on or how much is just poor quality causing head retention issues...either way it detracts from the appearance and is the only negative with this beer. Beyond the head I see small bubbles trying to find their way out of the murky deep, the color is pitch black, velvet in texture.  S- the nose was dominated by whiskey, vanilla, alcohol, chocolate and candied fruits-- very complex and intense. No hop character.  T- deep roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, slight fruit essence, alcohol.. Finish is bitter, lingering, and warming. Very intense taste that begs to be slowly sipped. No flavoring hops present that I can detect.  M- thick and warm with light carbonation.  D- this needs to be sipped and slowly enjoyed with conversation or deep thought. The 15% is there but is so much in balance with the amazing taste that you only really notice it in the a warming aftertaste. Overall this is a huge beer with an amazing unique flavor.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kdb150,4.43,"Poured half from a 12 oz. bottle of 2012 BCBS into my stout glass at ~65 degrees, and recapped the bottle to finish tomorrow. UPDATE - editing my review from the other half, because my stout glass may have been a bit dirty. Better appearance and smell this time pouring into a tulip; the glass selection definitely made a difference.  A - Pours a blackish-brown with a small brown head, which dissipates to a ring that sticks around. Held up to light and viewed at an angle, brownish hues are seen around the edges of what is otherwise a midnight black beer. No lacing to speak of  S - Bourbon and booze are big in the nose. This is not at all surprising given the name and the enormity of this beer, and there is some toasty malts and pretty big sweetness detectable underneath.  T - Bourbon is up front but not dominant. Big sweet vanilla and moderate roastiness follow, with no alcohol detectable. Wood is also there in the background the whole time. The whole thing melds together very well, and the way it hides the alcohol is remarkable. The roasty dark malts come through towards the finish, and they do so very pleasantly. Towards the end of my pour, I think my palate became acclimated to the sweetness, and the booze became noticeable, but this is nevertheless a very, very delicious beer.  M - Thick, but not syrupy, which keeps the sweetness from being cloying. Perfect for both the style and size, and the carb stuck around throughout. At no point does this become overwhelming or too thick. Great feel.  O - This is a very impressive beer. To be able to make a bourbon barrel aged beer this young and this big which is this drinkable is a real achievement. I maintain that sticking to 6 ounces at a time is recommended, simply to avoid the affects of too much 15% ABV beer, but this does not fatigue or overwhelm the palate the way many giant beers do when young.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,woosterbill,4.55,"12oz bottle, bottled 11/7/12 (only 8 days ago!). Part of the first BCBS shipment to CT.  A: Viscous, pitch black body under a finger of fizzy dark brown head that quickly settles into a fine ring. Only the faintest hints of lacing, but for 15% is looks lovely.  S: Gigantic, hugely sweet aroma: molasses, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate. Spicy alcohol is in the background, but largely overwhelmed by the rich, sweet, barrel-y goodness. Excellent.  T: Follows the nose entirely. Sweetness up front, bourbon and oak midway through, and spicy booze on the long finish. Candy for adults.  M: Thick, creamy, and mouth-filling. Plenty of soft carbonation to keep its viscosity from getting too sticky. Perfect.

I was a little taken aback by receiving it in a small 9oz snifter (normally Im used to getting pints) until I took the first sip. Robust doesn't even begin to describe this beer. Pitch black, no lace and the strong taste of bourbon confused me at first. About four sips in I was hooked on the overwhelming flavor this beer had to offer. Hints of coffee and chocolate make a good barrier between the flavorful and aromatic hops as well as the powerful bourbon. I was extremely pleased with the almost ""oil like"" consistency this beer had. I also enjoyed the sophistication I felt by enjoying this like I would a fine glass of liquor. I will say that I would never have more than two glasses of this a night. On top of it being a pricey beer, it is very powerful flavor and ABV wise.

A: An aggressive pour into a standard pint glass did not produce a head; but, there was carbonation rising to the top as the glass. The brew is pitch-black.  S: The aroma is a robust oak along with plenty of booziness. There are also hints of grain and chocolate.  T: The taste begins with a sweet malt blast followed by oak and alcohol heat. Next, some dark dried fruit, chocolate, and grain join in to compliment the sweetness and the oak.  M: The body is on the heavier side of medium and there is a good deal of alcohol heat; and, there was only a small amount of carbonation. Also, because the big beer is still young it is just a little hard drinking due to the alcohol heat.  O: This is a really good big beer that will only improve with some age. I look forward to review this beer again after it has aged for a year. At this point the alcohol is still very prominent in the flavor profile and the rest of the flavors have not finished blending together. But, the oak in this beer is very strong and just what I want in a cask aged beer. There is also some good complexity with the dark dried fruit, chocolate, and grain supporting the malt sweetness, bold oak, and alcohol heat.

Smallish fizzy looking dark tan head that does not last long and there is more of a creep down the side of the glass than there is lacing. Smell is a real head turner. Bourbon this smooth is rare. It is balanced by a RIS sweetness and lots of chocolate and coffee. Notes of vanilla and oak, cherries and molasses. Good amount of alcohol but it is exhilarating. Taste is so smooth and complex. All the things that are in the nose but so well integrated it drinks easily and deliciously. A deep chocolate covered cherry body. Lots of wood aged bourbon and lightly singed caramel. Coffee from the nose is latte and cappuccino smooth and mellow on the tongue. Feel is lightly syrupy with a touch of slickness. A perfect carbonation gives enough of a break to your tongue to give a restorative quality. It may be a thick rich luxurious brew but it drinks so easily that it is almost scary. This is an extraordinarily well crafted beer. It has superb flavor, feel, and drinkability. Refined from top to bottom. The nose is seductive. Palate is complex and it develops as it warms.

1549,10672,Bouleboubier,4.35,"Wow! Huh...  Found out tonight they were having Goose Island tap takeover 3 blocks away, so I went - mostly to try this baby for the first time.  Wanted immediately, not knowing its ingredients, to measure this up against the Avery Mephistopheles, which is of similar strength and was served to me in the same cutesy lil 6oz snifter. This one has its differences, for sure.  A nice, nearly mousse-y, chocolate-milk colored head - slunk out rather quick. Black liquid. Surprised to not see legs - maybe the serving size is to blame?  Black malt and a little chocolate, at first, on the nose. A pleasant, potent, floral alcohol asserts itself more and more as it warms. Later on, I was getting something that said ""nougat"".  The flavor profile is decidedly more complex than the Avery. A bunch of vanilla early on, as well as that perfumy alcohol. Silky milk chocolate was there from the start and is later met and developed with some mild molasses notes. The bourbon element is superbly woven into the mix, not even close to domination - perfectly highlighting in the near background. Some vanilla and, to a much lesser extent, wood rise up slowly. Not much roasty flavor - not terribly surprising.  Up front, there's some soft silkiness to the body (curiously more so when colder) - just the right degree to balance - but it drops off in a swift flush, finishing (dangerously poundably) dry. I was seriously drinking this thinking I could easily put back a pint in less than a few couple minutes. Maybe could've had a lil more body.  Assuming this was young or fresh keg, the possibilities, the potential for aging this beer - it was weighing heavy on my sodden mind. I don't go out of my way to seek out beers (for the most part), but I must admit that I wouldn't hesitate to grab a 4-pack or 2 of this if we crossed paths again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MeowTom,4.55,"*Bottled served it at around 50-55 F to bring out everything.  A- Awesome dark mocha head no more than an inch in size that sticks around for a hot minute and then dissipates to a ring around the glass and stays there for a long nice drinking session. The beer itself is a pitch black liquid that pours thick and will suck the light out of the room. I love black ales that do this so I am a little bias towards a awesome black to say a clear lager.  S- So many things happening but the main points are vanilla, bourbon, wood, alcohol, carmel, and lots of other little notes that you just need to experience yourself.  T- Wow, just like the smell there are lots of things going on. First thing is the carmel sweetness and then the bourbon creeps in with a ting of alcohol coming on the back side of the sip. This is a 2012 Bourbon County so... I think the taste would even be better if I let it rest for another year. Once again just taste it and take it all in.  M- Probably the most incredible part of this already incredible ale. It is thick but with an incredibly unique carbonation that I think is given by the the illusion of the heavy bourbon flavor and the high alcohol. It just allows this to be like a sipping bourbon, but at the same time still a beer that has crossed lines.  O- Great complex beer that deserves your full attention and could possibly be one of the best imperial stouts I have had. I wasn't sure about the cost as it rivals dark lord (and I think Dark lord is over rated), but after the first sip it quickly became clear that this beer is worth every penny and I will run out and pick up the 4-pack tomorrow morning.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,NoLeafClover44,4.49,"2012 bottle poured into DFH Signature glass. Bottled 9/26/12. Thanks, Matthew.  A - Pours a really dark, nearly black, brown. The khaki head never gets above a half finger, and quickly retreats to a thin film and a halo. There is very little lacing; it may be better classified as legs.  S - Smells more like bourbon than beer at first whiff. Big oak, vanilla, charcoal, alcohol, and cork. As my nose acclimates to the powerful aroma, I get some subtle cocoa and licorice notes. I seemingly get a new aroma with each smell; wildly complex.  T - Surprisingly sweet to start. Cherry, fig, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Bourbon qualities hit on the back of the tongue. Burnt oak, sherry, and white chocolate on the finish. The high alcohol and barrel qualities are prominent and warming, but never overpowering.  M - Thick and smooth as hell. Perfection for the style.  O - This one lived up to the hype for me. One of the most complex, full aroma and taste profiles I have ever come across in a beer. The barrel is noticeable immediately with huge toasted oak and tobacco aromas that seem to fill the whole room. The flavors are everchanging with the temperature. The mouthfeel is unreal.

Opaque, black elixir. A bit disappointing. There are some legs down the glass, but of course not much lacing for this ABV.  Subtle bourbon, malt, licorice, vanilla.  Alcohol burn, charred malt, bourbon and sweet vanilla/caramel. Nice.  Over carbonated, spicy, alcohol, slick.  This one needs some time. Much prefer KBS and PEGS DOS.

Chocolaty mocha, sugar, sweetness, bourbon, licorice. Extremely inviting, one of the best aromas I've ever encountered.  T: Certainly follows the smell, initially tastes a bit like coffee and then you taste the bourbon with a lovely lingering aftertaste of sweetness. I'd planning to let a few of these age to see how the sweetness dissipates.  M: Very thick and viscous. Certainly lends itself to sipping.  O: I am one to say that BCS is worth the hype. Sure it costs ~$25 a 4 pack, but this is one to be savored and shared with friends. This will be one of my all time favorites for a long time coming.

Smell- Wonderful chocolate and booze, lots of vanilla and toasted coconut. I dig it.  Taste- A big blast of vanilla and bourbon notes, followed by some chocolate and booze. I'm not a big fan of boozy beers, but it just works so well in this. It isn't hot, just complimentary to the beer in every way.  Mouthfeel- Nice and full bodied, coating and slick with mild carbonation. Warming on the way down.  Overall- Awesome stuff, I can't wait to try this with some age on it.

S- Bourbon, vanilla. A good bit of alcohol. Caramel and toffee. Some roasted wood qualities. An intense bourbon forward beer.  T- A very intense and in your face beer.. Comes over first with a huge bourbon flavor, and follows through with a massive malty beer. It's like taking a shot and immediately chasing it with a stout. A ton of vanilla, the wood flavor is strong in this beer, very roasty and almost char tasting. There is a lot of caramel, toffee, molasses, roasted malts. Alcohol, but at 15% it could be a lot worse.

An aggressive pour yielded a pitch black body with a beautiful caramel-colored one finger head that unfortunately faded almost immediately with minimal lacing. The nose is nothing short of heaven! As soon as I popped the cap I could smell it. Huge and roasty with tons of bourbon and double chocolate fudge along with hints of coffee, oak, vanilla, booze, and molasses. The taste is just as big and just as bold. Chocolate fudge and bourbon are again the stars along with a ton of oak. And the chocolate is not subtle. It's like eating a chocolate fudge brownie. Absolutely amazing! It's nicely complemented with hints of vanilla, espresso, tobacco, molasses, and a touch of black cherry and smoke. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk and thick as molasses. The finish is spicy with an amazing alcohol burn. Yeah, it's 15%, but I could easily drink another. Bourbon aged stouts are my favorite style, and this is the best I've had to date.

1549,10672,Stoutfan23DJ,4.92,"355ml bottle, 15 abv, bottled on 08/23/2012-1754. Poured down the center of a brandy snifter at 60 degrees.  Appearance: Pours one of the thickest looking bodies that you’ll ever see with a half a finger head that immediately resides into a dark brown lacing of head on top and around the glass. When you swirl it around it leaves the thickest brown lacing and legs you’ll ever see.  Aroma: I guarantee that you will start smelling it once you crack the top and pour it into a glass. A very strong aroma that lets you know that you’re now in for one hell of a beer and an amazing experience! Massive bourbon barrel characteristics come through, roasted malts, deep chocolate, roasted coffee, sweet caramel and dark dank fruit, and an interesting char/smoke quality. There is a presence of alcohol but it goes really well with all the intense flavors. Just a whiff will open your airways!  Taste: Massive bourbon, charred oak and vanilla characters immediately hit you. Loads of roasted malt, roasted coffee and slight bitter hops that contribute. Caramel, molasses, smoked peat malt flavors, sweet raisins, cherry, fig, and other fruits including some spiciness. Very big, bold, intense and complex brew. There is a big dark fruit quality that is much more prominent in this years’ vintage than in any other year vintage that I have had in the past. The dark chocolate/bourbon covered fruit qualities surprised me and really contributed to the overall complexity. I could go on and on with the specific flavors I’m getting through out and as it warms up.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is as thick and viscous just like a fine bourbon, and easily makes you want to take your time and sip on it for an hour or two. It went down relatively smooth and I just truly savored each sip. The carbonation is very minimal but is just right for a stout like this at 15%. The back of your throat and chest also get a warm burning sensation after each sip from the alcohol and the intensity of flavors.  Overall: This is one the finest barrel aged beers made today and is by far my favorite bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout! This is a beer that really blows me away every time and I would recommend this to anyone that has a palate for big imperial stouts and bourbon/whiskey barrel-aged beers. I will also suggest putting aside a few bottles and cellaring them for a few years down the road. They will age very well!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

One sniff and I know right away this instantly leaps to the top of my list. Port Hop 15 (the recent draught release is perfectly carbonated and incredible); fresh Heady Topper and now this.

A deep dark opaque sleek black color... A couple of carbonation bubbles can be seen clinging to the sides of the glass...  S - The bourbon barrel character is at the forefront (no surprise)... Next are faint hints of vanilla, dark fruit, and caramel... Did I mention booze - it never really fades and dominates each and every whiff...  T - This one is a booze bomb to start... You can't miss the heat and booze that leads on the palate... Once you get past the initial heat and booziness, there are layers of complexity and terrific balances... Slightly roasted malts... Cocoa... Vanilla... Caramel... Some dark fruit notes...  M -Full bodied... However, this one while still thick, viscous and chewy wasn't quite as thick, viscous and chewy as expected... A little carbonation with a lot of bite... Sleek and smooth... The heavy booze component can be felt in the throat (and even the nostrils) after each and every sip...  D - This one is a definite sipper that is to be enjoyed and savored... An excellent brew all the way around, but I'm not quite sure it leaves up to the lofty and almost unfair expectations... I will gladly enjoy the bottle that I picked up as well, but think I may give it a bit of time in the cellar to take a bit of the edge off and let some of the finer complexities emerge...  Update (2012 Version) - The year in the cellar has served this one very nicely... Smoothed out the rough edges considerably...

1549,10672,JamesMN,4.25,"Appearance: Opaque very dark brown, basically black with an almost nonexistent light brown head.  Aroma: Vanilla, alcohol, caramel. Not overpowering but lots of alcohol in the nose.  Taste: Chocolate up front then quickly turns into a caramel/molasses profile. Real nice and malty with that added bourbon flavor for an interesting palate. No bitterness or hop character (wasn't expecting any). An overall sweet profile with some bitter chocolate on the aftertaste. Can't taste much of the 15% ABV which is nice.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and real smooth. Alcohol warmth on the end. Good drinkability for such a big beer.  Final Thoughts: This one didn't really blow my mind but I didn't have those kind of expectations. It's a very good beer, an Imperial Stout on steroids.

1549,10672,mjpolzin,4.78,"As hyped as this beer is, I was very excited to try it but on the other hand, was worried that my expectations wouldn't live up to the reality of how it actually ending up being. My feelings about this beer are best summed up by Chris Drosner (aka the Beer Baron) writing for the Wisconsin State Journal as he compares BCS to Central Water's Bourbon Barrel Stout (a local-to-Wisconsin barrel aged stout)- The metaphor that comes to mind is listening to a symphony on an $800 stereo system versus on a $5,000 receiver and 6-foot custom speakers. The first experience is absolutely worth having, but the two are just not the same. The utter depth and enormity of BCS is what makes it special. All of the aspects that I would expect from a barrel aged stout are there (dark, thick, strong scent and taste of bourbon) but everything is smoother and more enjoyable with this brew. At the first, the taste of bourbon and the strong alcohol hit me pretty hard but as I kept drinking, these things mellowed out and I finished the beer almost feeling like I could have another one. I resisted this urge though as I realize that this beer is for special occasions only.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The one I had was overpowering bourbon. That is all I smelled and all I tasted. It was good, but not what I was expecting. It was like sipping a fine bourbon. I dunno.

Pretty much no head when pouring but the little bit of turbulence was brown in color (not surprisingly).  I don't know how to better describe this beer than to say it tastes and smells ""warming."" Yes, a lot of that is due to the high ABV I'm sure, but I just think mountain lodge, around the fire.  I imagine it is quite challenging to keep a beer of this ABV balanced, and while this leans on the sweet side, I think that is to be expected and what I'd want out of this type of beer.

My hats are off to my Cohost for sending me a bottle. Epic beer.  Appearance- Dark and viscus. Like night in a bottle it poured heavy. It was as though the beer was going to make you wait. Then once it was in the glass, it was going to make you wait more because it had to make you look at it.  Smell- Amazing. It smelled like whiskey barrels. It smelled old and rich and strong. It smelled noble.  Taste- Unreal. It was soft on the palate yet strong. You could taste the bourbon in it but it wasn't overpowering. Somehow they kept the bourbon out just enough that it left the stout behind. It was awesome. Ever had a good cream sherry? Now we're talkin.  Mouthfeel - Cold beer that warmed you up. That's right. It was cold yet it had that breathing qualities that cognac has. It burned a little bit but not harshly. Just enough to make you aware it was there. Then you swallowed and sweat a little.

Just a gleaming midnight black body, with just a touch of thin brown collar. Collar really doesn't stick around much, one odd carbonated bubble tiny and small occasionally pops its head up through the glass.  Nose is a big whiff of oak and thick molasses, with a giant whiskey note. Controlled but large. Some thick molasses and licorice without a huge sweetness, and a nice hint of alcohol. Piping coffee. It's all there.  Palate rushes with a great unbelievable silky feel. Vinous thick molasses make a big oak whiskey angle, with dense malt roast, and coating. Finish has that classic licorice angle, with the nice heat it provides and almost liqueur feel, creme de cassis, anisette, Italian dark bitters. Piping coffee warmth, but never burns going down, quite amazing.  Overall the brew on tap just sings and is a lot of fun.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pitch black with a thin lace of brown head which recedes quickly. massive nose of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, leather, licorice, burnt sugar, anise asphalt and bourbon soaked raisins.  The same flavors that are on the nose bombard your tongue in a giant mess of flavor. Huge hue flavor! Like a hand grenade dishing out different offerings at every blast. This young beer needs a little time to settle, but even as a messy pile of flavor, it still holds together pretty damn well. I Plan on trying this one in a few months to see how it opens up.

1549,10672,BeerFMAndy,4.85,"12 oz twist-off bottle poured into a snifter. 13% ABV, 2009, Bottled on: 11/12/09, ""Serve in a snifter, Develops in the bottle for up to 5 years.""  A - Odd this year was a twist off. An exceptionally hard twist-off at that. 2009 Bourbon County pours an inky black color which covers the snifter in long, gooey legs of alcohol but no lace is retained from the short-lived mocha-colored head.  S - Mellow warming alcohol in the form of bourbon arrives at the olfactory senses first, but sans the unnecessary burning solvent aromas the fresh bottle exhibits (though minor solvent opens up with a vigorous swirl). Rich chocolate comes in three parts following the bourbon; smooth milk chocolate, dark cocoa-rich chocolate, and bitter bakers chocolate on the finish which all intertwine nicely with the alcohol, vanilla and oak notes, and present a voluptuous backing.  T - Age lets the depths open up to further exploration in flavor, really showcasing the malt's qualities rather that make them fight to be experienced in this nearly 3-year-old bottle. Dark molasses and burnt caramel take precedence over the beer's vanilla and coffee bean flavors, but the malt really drives the aroma's chocolate flavors home. Soft, smooth bourbon and faint oak roll off on the tongue with near perfection, pairing well with, rather than oppressing, the beer.  M - When the beer clings to the glass altering it's color, it's a fair indicator that it will clutch your throat and gently glide down as you swallow, and that's exactly what this silky smooth, robust, full bodied beer does. Aged Bourbon County abandons the excessive heat and thinning solvent alcohol associated with fresh barrels without showing a collapse of the spirit's interaction. Instead, a supple warming finish creeps across the stomach with ninja-like subtlety.  O - I think it's quite fair to say that Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout truly becomes an exceptional beer with age, refining it's rougher ""young"" edges for a more sophisticated and approachable bold beer. The nose still remains somewhat intense concerning the alcohol, but the rest of the beer doesn't quite follow suit, opening new dimensions that are otherwise closed off due to the somewhat burdensome power of the spirit's freshness.  This three-year-old bottle indicates the beer is one gracefully cellaring beer; the reason I pick some up every year.

T/M: As rich as the aroma is, the taste is even better and more complex. Big fruit flavors hit up front mingled with sweet, hot bourbon. Underneath are sweet malts, some butter and caramel (but just a touch, not overdoing it like so many similar beers do), some harsh burnt flavors. Really intense and layered, with everything blending together perfectly. It's strong and rich and heavy but also so subtle. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy to match.

1549,10672,JackStraw,4.54,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter; bottled on 9/17/12  A - Pours completely black, 40+ SRM, totally opaque, can't see a bit of light through it; nearly non-existent brown head bubbles up and fizzles out quickly, a little circular blotch of carbonation forms in the center of the glass looking like an oil slick.  S - Definitely rich, deep, and complex, the initial nose is sweetness with caramel and vanilla and tons of roasted malt. Each smell brings out more; there is the bourbon, though not as strong as I've smelled in others, and I also get cherries and raisins. One smell I get more of the malt, and another more of the fruity esters.  T - Wow! Like the smell, the more you sip, the more and varied the flavors. Very initial sweetness with chocolate and caramel, dark roasted nearly-burnt maltiness; then the alcohol really takes over and comes on strongly. After a minute or two, I get a lingering dark chocolate aftertaste with a hint of dark fruit (raisins).  M - Thick, chewy, velvety, luscious, with a long, lingering warming and alcohol. Almost no carbonation feel, and does feel a little syrupy, I can almost feel it building up on my lips...  O - This beer is super-hyped, but it's easy to see why. It's a real treat. Complex, deep, strong, interesting, it's a beer you can sit with and get to know for a while, and it keeps giving you more and more. I'm glad I got to share this with my girl, it can easily be split into a couple snifters and enjoyed together!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,vonnegut21,4.8,"2012 vintage poured into a Sam Adams tulip.  A: Pours a deep, pitch black with a finger of tan head, which dissipates quickly, leaving minimaly lacing on the glass.  S: Light bourbon notes, vanilla, caramel with hints of oak and roasted malt. For a barrel aged beer, the nose is excellently balanced and not overpowering.  T: Roasted malt, dark baker's chocolate, with a smooth bourbon finish. Further sips yield more oak, caramel and vanilla with hints of black licorice. The bourbon is in perfect harmony with the base beer and the barrel aging has resulted in a 15% ABV beer that has almost no alcohol heat.  M: Smooth, thick and creamy. Nicely carbonated and very little alcohol burn.  O: This is a classic for a reason. Buy it. Drink it. Enjoy it. One of the best barrel aged beers available hands down.

1549,10672,woodjjacct,5,"This is, in my opinion, the king of bourbon barrel-aged beers. It's particular qualities are the qualities I search for in a high quality craft beer. It is delicious, it's got a kick to it (let's face it, would you drink beer if it was alcohol-free?), and it is worth every steeply approximated penny.  Appearance - Black, oily, thick. Just by looking at it while it pours and settles into the glass, you know this beer means business.  Smell - A combination of dark fruits, molasses and a hint of vanilla and bourbon.  Mouthfeel - Never really understood the importance of mouthfeel when it comes to a good beer, but it is thick and smooth and without carbonation.  Taste - Now this is where this beer in my opinion shines. If you let it roll around your taste buds for a moment, there is real chemistry between the back of your tongue and the beer. There is chocolate, bourbon, dark fruits, molasses and a complex concoction leading to a firework's celebration of flavor. Like everything else about this beer, it mean's business.  My opinion? Best beer I've ever had. My favorite among them all. There are other great ones, but this out does them all no question to it. KBS and Parabola are up there too on my list of comparable favorites, but they are too subtle about what makes them good. You really need to dig deep with those beer's to describe how great they are. With BCBS, it flat out screams it at you and your tastebuds and provides a strong buzz to boot.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A - 4.25 - Thick, viscous black. Not even a flashlight will put a dent in it. Brown fizzy proto-head that dissipates almost immediately. A nice enduring head would score better.  S - 4.75 - Strong chocolate fudge, wood, and the malty sweet smell of a sweet-glazed breakfast cereal like the Sugar Smacks of old. Hint of coffee with agitation. Initially sort of winey, but after agitation, some bourbon. Smells great. Smells mature and composed. 2013 tasting - Chocolate. Caramel. Something like malty chocolate graham cracker pie crust. A little vanilla. Bourbon. Wood. Fantastic.  T - 4.5 - Nice bourbon and wood. Creamy smooth chocolate and even some caramel. I had heard it was a boozy mess when young but it's coming across pretty smooth and well integrated to me. Lots of people are mentioning dark fruits, but I'm not able to isolate those myself. There's barrel wood and bourbon on the exhale, with some char as a lingering aftertaste. 2013 tasting - Chocolate pudding. Faint cherry. A bit of bourbon. Wood less evident than last year. Not getting any coffee this time and the char is very subdued. Malty chocolate booze exhale. Cherry brownie aftertaste. Fantastic.  M - 5.0 - Thickest I've had and a pleasure in the mouth. Pudding-like. You wouldn't think it could get this thick. Super velvety and smooth. 2013 tasting - Heavy puddinglike body. Ends a bit sticky. Fantastic.  O - 4.5 - It's a lot smoother and subtler than I expected and not as complex on the palate as I was expecting. I've come to expect a bit more char out of my imperials. I would almost say it is very well balanced at the expense of complexity - everything comes together so well that it's harder to perceive the different layers. It's pretty easy drinking in terms of not being so intense that it makes you put the brakes on, but it does pack a nice wallop on the buzz front. Very nice. 2013 tasting - Fantastic. Even better than when I had it closer to fresh. Such rich brownie chocolate offset by enough booze to stand up to it, with a touch of cherry something, all in a malty baked goods environment.

A - Midnight black, dark tan head disperses quickly and leaves rim around the edge of the glass (red wine glass in my case).  S - The smell is amazing, smells like your head is in the oak barrel with all the great aromas swirling around you. For me the oak and bourbon overshadowed everything else, but I get some sweet wifs here and there.  T - The taste is intense, with woody fruits and a hint of vanilla, I get some dark coffee and roasted malts towards the end, a little bit of an edge and then a bourbon taste lingers.  M - Thick, and heavy on the tongue, the slight carbonation lingers.  O - Glad I tried it, it's an amazing beer, the aroma is amazing.

Lightly bitter heavy in the alscohol taste but smooth. Little sweet offset with the obvious bitterness. Heavy molasses feel but it won't scare you.  Mouth: Smooth, sticking...I have had other bourbon aged stouts as far as after-taste, texture and how easy to drink this one tops them all.  Overall: This beer is a gem, pricey as hell but you would definitely pay more at a bar for worse. At roughly 25 bucks a four pack it is a steal.

Bottled 9/26/12  I let it sit for about 15 minutes at room temperature before opening. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my CBS snifter.  Appearance: Thick, black, dark and dense. The beer looks like a cup of bold coffee with a finger of light brown head. The head quickly dissipated but left a thin ring around the edge of the glass. A very decadent looking pour.  Smell: Loads of dark pitted fruits at first as well as an ample amount of dark chocolate, charred oak, bourbony vanilla, roasted malts and a little smoke. Obviously, there's a lot going on here. Every time I sniffed the beer I picked up a different aroma.  Taste: Wow. Starts off again with some sweet, dark fruit and then woody vanilla and burnt molasses. The end of the sip is just lousy (in a good way) with the taste of bourbon, vanilla and the bourbon barrel. Really a very well balanced tasting bourbon barrel aged beer particularly for one that's so green. It doesn't drink particularly hot, but yet still gives you that warm feeling that a spot of bourbon on a cool night gives you.  Mouthfeel: Thick, oily and unctuous. For a beer clocking in at 14.5%, I'm not getting much in terms of booziness which is much appreciated. One of the best stouts I've encountered in terms of mouthfeel.  Overall: An outstanding beer and certainly worthy of the hype and its $24 per 4-pack price.

S: Monster bourbon notes and the hotness of the abv are most prevalent. Other aromas include raisins, figs, molasses and general malt sweetness.  T: Unreal mix of bourbon, cocoa, sweet malts, dark fruits, and coffee. This beer is so smooth and so completely well balanced, it's really amazing.  M: HUGE body, big feel, low carbonation but it really helps the flavors completely coat my entire mouth letting it bask in the glory that is BCBS.  O: An absolute masterpiece of a beer.

S: Toasted wood, coconut??, bourbon, a little vanilla T: the bourbon is much more apparent vs. the nose, but it is not overwhelming, very well integrated. Very sweet, but balanced by the roasted malts, the bourbon, and the oak. Still, I would like a little more roast or hops, I suspect that it has mellowed over the last couple of years and the sweetness is starting to dominate. As it warms, there is some coffee and chocolate flavors making an appearance. M: Low carbonation, but still a tingle on the tongue. Very creamy mouthfeel. D: Having just come back from a 4 day backpacking trip, I would have loved one of these in front of the campfire, i.e. this would be awesome in a can.

If Satan was going to have himself a beer, I imagine it would be this one. Little to no head off the pour though...  Serious booze on the nose, bourbon and chocolate dominate...Tad bit of dark fruit, oak and vanilla, but with a bottle claiming a 15% ABV, you shouldn't expect too much outside of a Randy Johnson fastball level heat.  As with the nose, serious booze on this one. I mean, it's not messing around in the slightest. Bourbon and oak up front with some malty sweetness on the back end. Hints of vanilla, brown sugar and caramel. Damn near perfect...  Thick and chewy, just as you would want from a serious imperial stout. Right on the money and a sipper for sure.

It will be perfect after leting it celar for a year or so. Complex.  M: Thick, rich stouty goodness with a perfect amount of carbonation to cleanse. Thick is all I can say the alcohol does not feel like 15% at all.  O: This is a damn near perfect beer for the style in my opinion, it lives up to the hype by far!

1549,10672,Thehuntmaster,4.35,"355ml bottle 14,5% Abv. Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. Bottled on: 11/11/11  Thanks to both Brabander and Futura123 for sending me bottles of this.  Appearance: BCBS pours thick and oily and appears pitch black in the glass. Surprisingly a back light reveals a lot of deep red along the edges of the glass - this is no where near as dark as I would expect from a 14,5% imperial stout. A rough pour yields a small, fast dissipating, mocha colured head and a swirl coats the glass in heavy yellow tinted alcohol legs.  Smell: As expected, the initial nose offers a ton of bourbon, along side vanilla, caramel and toasted coconut. As the beer warms, the base imperial stout notes begin to emerge, these include: Dark chocolate, dark fruits (plums, raisins and cherries) and a touch of black liquorice. The barrel character on offer in the nose is fantastic, but I think I might prefer a little more power and complexity from the base beer.  Taste: Mmmm, this is absolutely delicious - the flavour certainly offers a better balance between the bourbon barrels and the base beer than the nose. Notes include: Sweet bourbon, vanilla, dark caramel, butterscotch, a little toasted coconut, dark fruits (plums, raisins, cherries and dates), a little molasses and some black liquorice. There is a little of the 14,5% note, but it is far from bothersome.  Mouthfeel: I was expecting this one to be almost flat, but it is surprisingly well carbonated - medium level and wonderfully smooth. The body is fantastic - thick, chewy and oily.  Overall: BCBS is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout and one I would certainly buy a lot of if I lived in the States! I would also love to try a few older vintages - particularly the '09, which I hear is drinking fantastically at the moment.  2012 Vintage thanks to gn0sis. Bottle on: 11/07/2012. 15,0% Abv.  Appearance: Identical to the 2011 vintage. 4 Smell: Massive bourbon blast up front (I prefer the bourbon character here to the 2011), with notes of soft vanilla, toasted coconut, oak, caramel and butterscotch. Warming brings out the base beer, with a ton of dark fruits (raisins, liqueur cherries and some plum), molasses, a fair amount of liquorice and a hint of chocolate. 4.5 Taste: As with the 2011, there is a fantastic combination of sweet bourbon and the dark fruity base beer. There is more dark fruit character than in the 2011 and a little more liquorice. Again, the booze is very well hidden. 4.5 Mouthfeel: No! This is way over carbonated - medium-high level and not all that smooth (it does thankfully settle down reasonably quickly though). As with the 2011, the body is perfect. 3.5 Overall: Slightly sweeter than the 2011 and aside from the carbonation a little better. 4.5",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,boilermakerbrew,4.97,"Bottled on 9-20-12.  A- Pours dark as night, and oily slick. Little to no head, but ok lacing and retention on what's there. Collar of foam on the top is chocolatey brown in color.  S- Strong mix of bourbon, oak, and stouty goodness. Primary flavors are the strong whiskey flavor with definite notes of vanilla and oak mixed with traditional stout malt flavors. Hints of black licorice in the dark malts.  T- Starts off with a sweet vanilla-oak mix. Then the bourbon heat and flavor kicks in. Right in the middle, traditional stout flavors with heavy chocolate tones and a fair amount of coffee roast comes through. That black licorice flavor that was in the scent is also present on the palate; I think it might be anise. Ends with a slight coffee bite mixed in with a last little whiskey kick.  M- Thick and dense. One of the thickest and heaviest I've had. Lots of alcohol heat. Definitely a sipper. One that can warm you and last you through an entire night.  Overall, I think this one lives up to the hype. I think it may be a little over-proofed when compared to KBS and similar options, but it definitely has way more whiskey flavor to it. If you are a bourbon over, this is for you.

1549,10672,tectactoe,4.59,"2012 edition. Pours a thick, deep, black color with a very dark tan head. Beer is fairly volatile at first, producing a huge creamy head. Once the head finally dissipates away, it's hard to bring back. The nose on this beer is incredible. Huge oak and vanilla aromas, heavy bourbon and whisky, sweet caramel and roasty malts. HUGE nose, full of a powerful set of flavors - I think I just sat and smelled this beer for about five minutes before I finally took a taste. It will open up right in front of your nostrils.  The beer has a great vanilla taste right off the bat. You get hit with a syrupy sweetness that transforms into a flavor with bittersweet chocolate, malts, and heavy bourbon. As the beer warms up, the bourbon and oak flavors become more and more plentiful, but the wonderful vanilla flavor and aroma never goes away. The aftertaste leaves a nice buttery malt flavor on the tongue. The mouth is huge - super creamy, thick, and chewy with a mild amount of carbonation.  This is a beer you certainly must baby and sip slowly - however, it is worth every minute of it. Amazing brew here, with an incredible nose and flavor. I'm glad I got my hands on a four pack, and I plan on aging a few of these to see how they react.  EDIT: 2008 Vintage  Thanks to Jeff for sharing one of his '08 bottles. Last year to have the white label. God, this stuff was amazing. Bourbon was still strong and robust, but so incredibly smooth. Huge vanilla, chocolate, molasses.

Appearance - I gave this beer a nice hard pour to generate something of a head, and it worked. A beautiful mocha, bubbly head...which lasted about 3 seconds and converted into a thin wispy layer on the surface for a bit. About halfway through drinking it had disappeared completely.  Smell - one of the most perfect balances of a sweet roasty stout and oaky vanilla bourbon. It's the type of smell in which you revisit immediately because it was such a surprising pleasure. To the unfamiliar they might just catch a whiff and exclaim ""Is there bourbon in that?"". For those of us that have had many BA stouts we know that this is pure balance.  Taste - roast, chocolate, and vanilla enveloped in a delicate bourbon sweetness with a lingering oak spicyness. This beer is done masterfully.  Mouthfeel - thick and smooth. This beer goes down so well, coats the mouth, and is full bodied. One of the best sipping beers I have ever had.

N - Massive vanilla bean, caramel, stiff amount of peat, burnt sugar, caramelized peaches, buttery, lots of booziness but it's actually inviting as it meshes with the nearly cloying sweetness and bourbon whiskey; oak barrel, peaches and sugar, creme brulee, cinnamon, simple syrup, toast points, rice pudding.  T/M - Brandy-like alcohol burn, cocoa nibs, vanilla bean, charred oak, burnt sugar, peat soil. And oh my dear god...what an amazing velvety finish, the coated aftertaste of just pure vanilla, bourbon, toffee, caramel, it absolutely coats the back of your palate. Some buttery, diacetyl notes, resiny, dense and overpowering alcohol (a bedtime beer); chocolate muffin, very warming, rum cake, old bananas, figgy.  D - Does it live up to the hype? Pretty difficult to answer but honestly I would say that super-coated, almost fluffy like mouthfeel is unlike anything I have ever tasted. I had a small sampler of an 08 and certainly don't remember anything like that. Definitely quaffable, a sipper, but dangerously drinkable at 14.5 abv.

1549,10672,claaark13,3.7,"2012 bottle, 9/20/12 date. 15% ABV. I've had this on the day of the review and the previous night. Tonight it was served at 55 - 60 degrees in a Hill Farmstead tulip.  A - Pours very dark, airy medium-tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly into lacing....and then into mostly nothing. Lacing returns, legs are decent. Probably more like a 4.25 here.  S - Lots of oak, slight fudge, a singe to the nose hair and a distinctly strong aroma of woody bourbon. The booziness can certainly be found in the aroma, as most other notes get lost in that. Notes of raisin come through after a bit. Very potent, but not necessarily in the best of ways.  T - Nose clears on the first sip...tons of oak from start to finish. Fudge turns to woody bourbon, then raisins and licorice, then more woody bourbon on the finish. The finish is fairly harsh and seems overdosed with bourbon. There is a tad bit of vanilla, but mostly wood. Mild chocolate and molasses on the tongue once the bourbon subsides, days later.  M - Medium bodied, slightly prickly on the tongue. Not bad, but the tongue tickles after each sip from the heat.  O - I'm pretty disappointed with how this one tastes right off the bat, particularly in comparison to the previous few years when fresh (2009 - 2011). The way this sits right now, I think I'd prefer to just pour myself a neat couple ounces of Woodford Reserve. I'm not sure if it was the amount of bourbon in the barrels, the type of bourbon used or the base beer, but something happened on this one. I'll be sitting on the rest of my bottles for a while.

A: pour is a deep black with absolutely no transparency. On an aggressive pour, about ½ fingers worth of dark mocha color head formation occurs that quickly dissipates. Swirling the brew you can see the glaze of alcohol that clings to the glass.  S: this is truly amazing. I pick up on huge bourbon notes that are so well balanced with dark fruits (predominately figs), huge sweet molasses, chocolate, and oak. Just smelling this one, one gets the sense that this is going to be amazing. Looking back I found that last years released was pretty hot fresh and the ABV really settled in quite nicely after a year. But this years is truly amazing. It’s higher ABV but I don’t find this hot one bit  T: damn this freaking amazing. 2008 was truly remarkable both fresh and aged. But I’m finding this one better than both the 2009 and the 2011 fresh (even with more ABV). Again, this is about as complex as it comes for this style. It has huge bourbon notes that are once again just amazingly well balanced with the dark fruits, molasses, alcohol, and chocolate. The alcohol is more noticeable here than in the nose but I don’t find it to be 15%. And the creamy vanilla finish just tops this one off.  M: absolutely full bodied, and I find it to be palate crushing. Not sure how you would be able to drink anything else after this. The bourbon and chocolate dance around the palate well after the finish with a touch of creaminess. It’s a very desirable taste and I just cant stop loving this brew.  O: damn near perfect for me already and its still fresh. As I stated, I think this one is better than last years fresh and I’m extremely excited to see how this one is going to mature since I just had an ‘11 just a month ago and thought it was freaking amazing.

T/M - The taste matches the smell so amazingly! Strong bourbon flavor hit my tongue first, that soon evolves to a rich chocolate flavor. There is a nice charedoak flavor on the back end as well. Thick/heavy mouthfeel, almost tongue coating.  O - The best bourbon stout I've ever had. I am so glad this one lived up to the hype. It's everything I want my bourbon stouts to be; big, bold, rich and bourbon-ey. One hell of an amazing beer. I would be more than happy to seek this one out again.

1549,10672,Grohnke,4.62,"2009 Vintage, bottled on 11/12/2009. 13% ABV.  Pours densely thick and oily. Black, impenetrable to light. There's not even enough head formation to cover the surface area. What little head formation there is, is signature cola-cinnamon colored and quickly dissipating  Aroma punches you in the face with ripe cherry and chocolate. Beautifully subtle bouquet of bourbon, vanilla, oak. Tremendous port-like aromas. Traces of roast, light traces of alcohol.  Cherry notes, bourbon, chocolate and light wood - near identical to the nose, which i am thrilled about. Molasses/brown sugar like sweetness. Cinnamonesque spiciness attributable to the alcohol. Vanilla on the far back tongue. Black licorice, raisin and plum begin to appear as it warms. Finish is sweet. Aftertaste is bourbony, residual sweetness, and chocolate.  Thick, viscous, relentlessly full, chewy body. Light carbonation. Creamy, and smooth. Alcohol gives off a slight warming feeling, just enough to feel spicy, however no where near offensive or overbearing. Actually, its complimentary to the huge body of this beast, but am excited to see it fall off even more with another year or 2 on it. Sticky residual sweetness. The physical sensation of drinking this beer, is so entirely pleasing.  It was a masterpiece back in 2009, and it continues to be that masterpiece today, only now a more bolder, distinguished version.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,tarheels86,4.55,"The full vertical thanks to ygtbsm94! Thanks Brad! 2003, 2005 (2004 was not bottled), 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009.  2003: rich barleywine notes, thick toffee, raisins  2005: very sweet, oxidized notes, still hot and boozy somehow  2006: thin bodied, lots of vanilla, raisins, dark fruits  2007: sherry, peaty, light-bodied comparatively, pretty spicy  2008: hot, lots of dark chocolate, spicy  2009: boozy, raisins, tobacco very sweet.  Overall this beer always pours the same- relatively flat with no retention and lace. And more often than not this impy is so hot! I mean really insane and a little over the top. Not my style. We took the best batches (03, 06, 07) and blended them to create something that was truly outstanding. Unfortunately, this is a very special occurrence and few will be able to try that blend unless they release BCS Grand Cru at some point.  22oz 2009 aged for a little bit. Holy $&@$ this is unf***ing real. Still pours an inky black with a small temporary head and no lace. Little boozy almost vodka aroma, that eventually moves to bourbon and coconut. Huge maple syrup in the body, lots of toasted coconut, perfectly balance between sweet caramel and coconut with spicy bitterness. Unreal slick, oily, perfect soft palate. No booziness, no warming alcohol. Has more maple than Canadian Breakfast Stout. Really one of the best beers I’ve ever had. Unbelievable. 8/17/2010 8/4/9/5/17=4.3  355mL 2008 ed. Consumed with 3+ years of age. Pours with a thick, red head unlike other BCS batches. Small lace. Nose is spectacular: superlative chocolate ganache, walnuts, amaretto, butter pecan, loads of cinnamon, fatty flank steak, banana bread, savory mild soy sauce. Taste is wildly rich and silky with the superlative imperial stout palate: ultra silk, butter reduction, thick and full. In the body, hot chili peppers linger in the finish with mild warming alcohol like a good bourbon or Scotch. Tastes like someone took a really good imperial stout and put it in a red wine reduction to up the intensity and body. Feels like this was made without strike water...as if Bells Expedition was a watered down version of this.

1549,10672,Synergy87,4.35,"Bottled on 9/17/2012. Served in Duvel Tulip.  A - Pours pitch black, no light penetrates through. A very thin tan head quickly dissipates.  S - Bourbon, wood, roasted malt, vanilla.  T - That hot bourbon kick initially, but quickly dies down and the flavors come out: oak, dark chocolate, a bit of coffee, and a touch of vanilla. Surprisingly not as complex as I'd thought it would be, even after letting it warm up. The flavor is so damn good I can't help but rate the taste higher regardless. WIth a year or 2 of cellaring, this will taste even better, the wood and dark chocolate should blend together less seamlessly, and more layers of flavor will come out, add more complexity and lessen the hot bourbon, which really isn't as bad as others seem to think, I think KBS was hotter to be perfectly honest.  M - Amazing mouthfeel, very smooth for 15% abv, oily yet chewy, a nice subtle carbonation which I dont usually notice much of for this style, carbonation is usually more flat, and as expected, an overall warming mouthfeel (it is 15% abv...)  O - I am so happy I found 2 more bottles, so I can age this for a year, and the other for 2. I really think this will shine with a year or 2 on it. I have had a 5 year version at Darklord day 2012, but I can't recall the flavor profile, other than that it wasn't boozy at all and some serious depth and complexity.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The smell of the beer has a really nice roasted malt profile with an intense about of barrel aged bourbon-like aromas. The taste is sweet upfront that then switches over to a slightly smoked flavor with a chocolatey bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is really smooth, lightly carbonated and goes down really easy. There is a bit of booze heat in there as well.

I was expecting to get a much boozier nose with 15%abv  T - big malt and chocolate initially, followed by a huge bourbon flavor and some coffee. The abv comes through here, but not too much as to make it a bad thing.  M - a bit thinner than I expected, pretty hot as above. I'm interested to see how this mellows over time.  O - great barrel aged stout, a bit boozy on the palate at this point but I'm sure this will ease up with a year or so on it.

You won't like this beer unless you like strong, black rich tasting beers. So if it isn't your thing I would stay clear.  But if it is your thing, do whatever you can to get this beer.  The following is based on the 2012 version, every year is different and unique.  It pours thick and black with minimal head, but it is there.  The smell is overpowering of booze with chocolate and sweet notes in the background. Since the booze smell was so strong I decided to let the beer sit awhile and breathe which definitely helped.  The mouth-feel is amazing, if you could chew on a beer it might be this one. Taste is of boozy chocolate, with hints of vanilla and god knows what else is in there.

Definitely worth the $24 4 pack I paid for. It was similar to Dark Lord 2012 in taste but it was much softer. Dark Lord slaps you in the face with these similar flavors while this was way more gentle and balanced with a great finish. The Dark Lord being harsh could have also had something to do with it being young. Drank 4 months after Dark Lord Day release. Wonderful beer.

The combination of that with the bourbon was just awesome.  T: As it warmed, you could definitely taste the bourbon through the roasted malts. But it wasn't an overwhelmingly boozy sort of taste. Had a smooth stout finish like creamy dark chocolate with a bourbon filling.  M: It lingered nicely on the palate with its full body and malt finish. A perfect beer to sit back and relax with.  O: Definitely an interesting beer. Made me wish I was outside in the cold sitting next to a bonfire. It will definitely keep you warm on cold nights and tasted so much better as it warmed.

Loads of roasted malt, some bitterness of dark chocolate. Burnt fruit notes. Tasty.  M: This is exactly what a big stout should feel like. It coats the palate and stays for minutes.

N: Caramel and vanilla over chocolate. The bourbon is front and center here, as it should be. A very little soy sauce saltiness which is actually pleasant.  T: Bourbon and soy sauce. I know there's no smoke in this, but it's got that element hiding in the back end. Salted caramel and chocolate. Prunes and raisins. Very noticeable alcohol presence, still. This should probably have graduated at this point.  M: Slick and oily.  O: I'm going to suggest this bottle was a bit over the hill. There's a dominant saltiness which detracts from the proceedings.

Surprisingly this has been on tap all week and it seems like hardly any one here has been drinking it. $10 for a 10oz serving in a snifter. '12 before released in bottles (edit- review tweaked a bit after trying '13- prefer '13 more).  A- Dark black and thick, pretty much completely opaque except a very tiny bit around the edges were it is very slightly translucent. Out of the three that were ordered at our table only one had a slight mocha brown head that had decent retention while the other two had no head to speak of. Nice carbonation, definitely a little bit more then you get with your typical BB stout.  S- Lots of bourbon, chocolate malts, light roasted espresso, coconut, and some booze. Definitely above average aroma strength.  T- The bourbon is more subdued then the aroma and the chocolate, light espresso, and coconut come out nicely with the bourbon. The alcohol at 14.5% is nicely hidden and it finishes with a nice bourbon aftertaste that is balanced nicely with the other flavors.  M- Definitely a little bit on the heavier side, some alcoholic burn but not much at all for being 14.5%, nice carbonation and overall definitely a fairly nice feel for a BB stout that is this high.  O- BCS is easily one of the best heavy barrel-aged stouts out there. The fact that it is released annually with fairly wide distribution makes it even better.

Appearance: Poured pitch black in color with a medium brown head that stood about one finger tall following a med-aggressive pour. The head settled pretty quickly to a spotty layer. There's some alcohol legs and lacing, but it falls back into the beer in a hurry.  Aroma: Bourbon, toffee, char, dark fruits, molasses...just a huge and appealing nose on this one.  Taste: Nice combination of bourbon-soaked fruits and toffee up front. There's a hint of alcohol towards the middle, but it's really more of a warmth than taste. I'm also getting caramel and a burnt sugar type of sweetness towards the middle. A welcome roasted and charred flavor near the back-end. Plenty of dark fruits and alcohol warmth on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with an extremely low carbonation.  Morey's Bottom Line: Well, this is my 1st time having this beer, and this one is 3 years old and living up to my expectations in every way. I can't say enough good things about this beer. Goose Island has this barrel-aging thing down without question. If we can start getting this beer locally, I'll be extremely happy.

Bitterness is nicely balancing but not too impacting on other flavors.  Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Smooth from start to finish with some dryness late. Aftertaste is long lasting.

One of my top wants, sent over as an extra, in a really small trade too.  What a trader!  Thanks again Doug!  A: Pours an opaque absolutely jet black, a very aggressive pours yields only the faintest whisp of mocha colored head, which disappears immediately.  Leaves not even a hint of lacing, but does show some alcoholic legs.  4  S: Huge aroma.  Bourbon comes out and smacks you in the face right off the bat.  Oak, a hint of dark chocolate, booze. Not as complex as some of the other similarly rated stouts.  Great aroma, just complete bourbony-booze dominance.  4.5  T: Oh, so delicious. Much more complex than the nose.  Dark fruits, roasted malt, chocolate, and of course bourbon all come out delightfully, I also get a touch of bitterness, a big oaky character, and lots of boozy heat.  Delicious but I do think the alcohol heat detracts from an otherwise terrific palate profile. 4.5  M/D: Really hot going down, and this is after two years!  I can only imagine a fresh bottle.  Smooth, moderately chewy mouthfeel,  full bodied and not as thick as some big RIS's, but appropriate and certainly not thin.  Gives a whole body warming sensation.  Drinkability is moderate, and I find the alcoholic heat very distracting and somewhat bothersome.  I love boozy beers, but I like when the booze characters add to the complexity of the beer through tasting boozy, not when they distract from the complexities by burning my throat and masking flavor intricacies.  3.5  O: Overall, a great beer with one flaw, way too hot.  I'm curious to see how newer vintages taste, as the ABV on this one is 13% and newer batches is 14.5%, but on reading other's reviews, not many people seem to address it as an issue.  They've obviously made at least some changes to the beer if the ABV went up 1.5%, Im wondering how the changes affected the heat.  But I digress.  As is, this is a great, but IMO not top tier RIS.  In terms of Goose Island offerings, the only other Bourbon County Stout Ive had the pleasure of drinking was the BCB Coffee variety, which I thought was far superior to this one (more flavor complexity, less heat, just better from top to bottom), which is in my top handful of all time favorite stouts (probably #2 behind Pegs Rare DOS).  That being said I would still drink this one any chance I got, and I plan to seek out newer vintages for comparison.

Goose Island came to New Jersey a few months ago, and this was the one I was looking forward to.  The waitress warned me that this was a pallate buster. I should drink this one second. Good advice. The flavor, smell, and mouth coating presence easily caps off the night.  You get a ton of bourbon and coffee in each smell and taste. The richness just coats your mouth really well.

The aroma has equal waves of dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon crashing over my nose. I wish the latter was a little bit less intense than the former two though. The flavor profile is a bit more smooth and nuanced. Dark chocolate is intense up front, only to be met by bourbon, vanilla, and some spicy oak notes. Then, some subtle plum and fig dark fruits come in on the finish. The body is full and rich and creamy, everything I'd want from a big, barrel aged imperial stout. The low to middling carbonation completes the luxuriant mouthfeel. Bourbon County Stout is a superb beer, best described as a milkshake for adults.

That being said, just looking at this beer, it has the look of a beer that has seen considerable barrel aging. The nose, of course, is incredible, as I get considerable bourbon (natch), dark chocolate, light coffee and malt balls. The flavor profile is every bit as good, and replicates the nose very closely. The bourbon and dark chocolate seem to dominate, but I have no problem at all with that. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the beer is a bit hot on the finish, but I think that's to be expected in a beer like this.

There is very little alcohol taste which is pretty impressive given its 14.5% ABV.  Mouthfeel: Viscous. Just a little carbonation coming through.  Overall: On tap, the BA sweetness tends to dominate a little bit too much for my taste. When I had it fresh out of the bottle, I felt the same way. Still, a fantastic beer, but I don't know if I would go so hard to seek it out on tap like I did before.  This scored a little bit lower than my review from a bottle with ~4 months of time on it.

Booze incredibly hidden.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and smooth.  Overall: Finally got to have BCBS and it did not disappoint.

1549,10672,pschul4,4.97,"By far my favorite beer. Not the best beer I've ever had, but when you take homerism/availability into account this is my favorite.  A- Pours black as night with no head, who wants head on their 14.5% bourbon stout? Not me!  S- BOOM! Bourbon in your face! Sweet chocolatey, coffee-y scents with the faintest hint of vanilla to balance everything stunningly. I don't even wanna drink it (I'm lying) I'd rather just smell it.  T- Oh yes... Yes! YESSS!!!! If you're reading this and have never had bcbs let me know if you're from out of town and in the chicago land area and I'll split a bottle with you (as long as I have a bottle to share, they tend to go quickly in my cellar). It's a mind blowing combination of super strong (but perfect) bourbon and chocolate with, as predicted by the nose, coffee and vanilla perfecting it.  M- Thick, real thick. Only stout I've ever had thicker was Marshal Zhukov and that was too thick for me. This is perfect coating thickness that leaves you tasting the beer long after it leaves your palate.  O- Basically perfect. It's #3 (behind CBS and King Henry) on my list of ""best beers"" and #1 on my list of ""favorite beers"" get this at all costs and I'll do what I can to help people who haven't had a taste get some.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pours a bitch black color with the slightest head. Scent is fantastic as it is rich with bourbon and roasted malts tones. The flavor is amazing!

I could tell that it wasn't as dark as most imperial stouts(Ten Fidy, Yeti, etc.) but was still above par for the course. Very dark mocha looking head.  S - Sweet chocolate and coffee malts give it the RIS backbone. Very sweet with little to no bourbon in the smell.  T - Chocolate/coffee malt BOMB with a nice overtone of bourbon flavoring. Not too overpowering and very nicely done. A bit of alcohol seeps through, but was expecting it at nearly 15%  M - Very thick and full bodied. Very easy to drink and coats the mouth with RIS goodness  O - A very good stout that I want to age when i get my hands on a bottle of it. It was spectacular on tap!  Bottle review on 11/2/12  A - 4.5 - Almost pitch black with mocha head. Darker than what I remember. VERY good looking RIS. Worthy of a 4.5  S - 4.5 - exactly as I remember it from when I had it on tap.  T - 5.0 - All the same flavors, but amplified. Exactly what I want from my RIS's. Coffee, Vanilla, Dark Chocolate, Dark Fruits.

Maybe not the best beer to start the night... this one is a doozy and one of the stronger beers I've tried. Yes I know it's 14.5% ABV, but DFH's offerings of this alcohol seem to go down a lot smoother. Anyways... a thick beer reeking of bourbon taste, with a strong alcohol bite.

1549,10672,iadler,4.39,"Did a blind tasting vertical (07-11) recently. Thanks to exitmusic00 for hosting and the bottles! Review is based off my favorite vintage, which was the 09. From notes.  A- Pours a deep black with a think light brown head which leaves a few lines of lacing.  S- Lots of dark fruit with plum and red cherry, roasted malt, coconut, dark chocolate, hint of vanilla and earthy bourbon on in the back. This smells like it's a few years old as the bourbon isn't as prominent as it would be fresh.  T- Chocolate brownie batter, plumb, cherry, roasted malt, coconut, oak, vanilla and earthy bourbon with a touch of heat.  M- Low carbonation with a syrupy body. Very little heat.  O- Fantastic vintage, with the bourbon well integrated into the other flavors. Lots of dark fruit, chocolate and coconut makes me think this is a couple years old, but there is still a touch of heat. Guessing an 09?  I was able to correctly guess the 3 out of the 5 vintages (Thought the 07 and 08 were the other) Here is my preference of the vintages:  1) 09 2) 07 (Drank more like a port with plenty of dark fruit and caramel sweetness, no heat at all) 3) 10 (Still a lot of bourbon with chocolate and dark fruit, but not overly hot) 4) 11 (Not nearly as hot and boozy as fresh, but could still use some time) 5) 08 (Seemed slightly oxidized and the bourbon was barely noticeable with the flavors being somewhat muddled)",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JohnnyHopps,4.57,"Poured from the bottle, the appearance was jet black and produced a mocha head. It had the thickness of motor oil with the lacing to follow. The nose of this stout might be the best scent I have experienced on a beer. The maltiness and the bourbon somehow morphed into a coconut aroma. I wanted to take a bite out of the glass. The initial taste was a very smooth and sweet chocolate with tart coffee in the background. Also making noise was the vanilla notes produced by the bourbon. The bourbon notes were not as active as I aniticipated. The stout finished with a warming almost sticky aftertaste. This stout was some serious lingering powers.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jazzyjeff13,4.59,"A 355ml bottle; batch 1944 with a bottled-on date of 11/11/11. How about that? Purchased from Trembling Madness in York last year and stashed in my garage ever since, awaiting the right moment. Well, as this is review no. 500, I reckon the right moment has come.  Poured into a Duvel tulip. Black as night, though hints of a deep reddish-brown are apparent when held to the light. Produces a thin head of brown foam that disappears rapidly. The aroma is supremely rich; almost cloying. Notes of bourbon, dried fruit, prunes, molasses, vanilla, burnt grain, wood and a huge hit of booze. Intense and delicious.  Tastes rich, spicy and boozy, with a bourbon-soaked character. Notes of bourbon, dried fruit, molasses, burnt grain, roasted malt, vanilla, cocoa and faint coffee. Intensely sweet. A major note of alcohol underpins the flavour; hot, prickly and astringent. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth; a thick, viscous syrup that envelops the tongue. Tingly and spicy, though little carbonation is present. Highly astringent - dries the palate. A lingering aftertaste of sweet, fruity, malty bourbon - yum!  In a word - superb! What a fantastic beer. Rich and intense, but with brilliant balance - the stout and bourbon flavours blend perfectly without competing for attention. I don't think more needs to be said; if you have the opportunity to try this then don't pass it up! In recent years, barrel-aging has become the latest fad - everyone is doing it.

T: Boozy with chocolate, caramel, toffee (5/5). M: sticky, lots of bourbon on the finish (5/5)  '08 bottle tasted 4/19/2011  A: An immediate whiff of chocolate and bourbon when the cap is popped. Pours jet black into a tulip with only the barest ring of dark tan head (4/5). S: The aroma is primarily chocolate and bourbon, but there's a bit of dark fruit in there too and some caramel (4.5/5). T: A sweet, fruity (cherry and maybe a little strawberry) start proceeds to chocolate cake in the mid-palate. Finishes bitter and herbal in the back of the mouth; the bourbon is showing strong here (4.5/5). M: Long finish, lingering but not sticky (4/5).  Honestly, I'd say that at the moment I'm preferring the '10 over the '08, but both are very good. Scores represent an averaging of the two vintages.  ---  Vertical 6/16/2012  06 - Thick and oily pour. Some prune in the aroma. Chocolate milk, prune, molasses. Still quite tasty.  07 - Lighter, somewhat cloudy. More bourbon on the nose. Less carbonated. More caramel and some coconut.  08 - No head. Strong bourbon and coconut on the nose. Tastes like a chocolate bourbon milkshake.  09 - More carbonated and darker. Smells sweeter and more chocolatey. Milder bourbon, caramel. Drier, not as sticky. My favorite of the vertical.  10 - Chocolate, more herbal. Vanilla and toasted marshmallow. Smooth up-front with a hot finish.  11 - Lots of bourbon and cacao.

Pours jet black with a thin (less than 1/2 finger) layer of micha head. Very little lacing.   Smells of bourbon, wood, brown sugar, cocoa and trace booze. Great blend with the bourbon prominent without being overbearing. One of the best smelling bourbon aged stouts I've ever sniffed!  Oh, wow- this is what a bourbon aged stout should taste like! As in the nose, the bourbon is out front without covering the other flavors of caramel, molasses, wood, smoke, cocoa, dark fruit, licorice and plenty of booze. Truly excellent. The alcohol is quite noticeable but not as much as I expected at 13% and fits the style nicely.   Feel is pretty darn thick with minimal carbonation. Oily & slick, it coats the tongue. Long sweet aftertaste.   Quite deserving of it's notoriety, this is perhaps the best bourbon aged stout I've had the priveledge of drinking. I'm sure the 21 months of age helped greatly. Hands down the best extra I've even received in a trade and well worth seeking out. I'm stoked to have a 2011 as well to age a little longer.

Bourbon is strong w/ this one. Rich & tasty, warming.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, sticky, ooey-gooey, coating. A dessert beer.  Overall this is one rich, delicious, decadent beer. Booze is not well hidden at all, but I don't mind that. Bourbon flavor is strong and intense, almost to a fault - in fact the dominance of the bourbon is the reason I can't give it a perfect 5 for taste. And lack of any head detracts from a higher score for appearance. Otherwise, an undeniably delicious beer.

Leaves little chunks of brown every now and then when swirling it around in your glass. Almost no lacing.  S: It smells like not-so-fishy soy sauce covered in chocolate and coffee. That might not sound appealing, but it smells pretty nice to be honest. Slight boozy aroma with a hint of bourbon.  T: Non-offensive soy sauce flavors with humungous chocolate and nutty tones and a little bit of burnt coffee. The bourbon notes aren't as prominent as I'd like them to be, but they're still there. Very nice balance.  M: Dense as the Earth below my feet. Long, boozy finish that lingers on the palette for quite some time after swallowing.

The look on this stout is black, it is really really black. a small amount of foam while the beer was coming to me, but it left by my first sip, leaving nothing but blackness. Smell is big and always the same, every time I have this beer. Rich dark roasted malt, rich bourbon with wood and some char, smoke. The dried fruit comes out with a lot of warming. The smell of Chicago is what I always say. Wow. this beer is big, and bigger from what I can see from the last time I have had it. Bourbon is the winner, vanilla from the oak, molasses out the ass, dried fruit with warming. Traces of smoke. All in all a big ass stout. The alcohol comes out kind of a bit and is felt.

Pours a dark black brew with an ever-so-slight beige head that turns to a ring around the glass. To be expected.  The aroma is still showing some bourbon at the front, rich chocolate, definite oak and slight leather.  The taste is amazing. Rich and creamy. Chocolate abounds in the mouth with a big vanilla swirl. Caramel goodness, molasses and more leather comes through in the finish. A tinge of alcohol heat during the sip and a warming sensation in the tum-tum at the end. This thing is still packing the heat close to five years later. Great stuff!  Still a full bodied monster. Silky smooth...almost velvet-like in the mouth.  Overall this was amazing.

Absolutely loaded with dark fruit and molasses sweetness...a good amount of bourbon heat and licorice....more candied sugars...some chocolate near the finish and finally a roasted note that hangs around after the swallow and helps close the beer out.

There is no carbonation visible except if I stare at the side and strain I spot a stray bubble or two pushing its way to the top. It poured like motor oil of the 10w 30 type and that is no exaggeration! I love the appearance of this awesome imperial stout. THIS is the way this style should look!  S: The nose on this gem is f*cking outstanding. When I popped it open and even before pouring I caught a few whiffs from the bottle. Now when I got my nose in the glass I literally got the chills and goosebumps. This smells wonderfully of sweet molasses, chocolate, figs and dark fruits. The bourbon has melded together with the other scents like a masterpiece. The aroma is so damn smooth with almost no alcohol to speak of. Where is the 13%?  T: It can't get much better than this! WOW!! At first the sweet caramel hits my mouth along with a cloyingly sweet molasses. I get the bourbon but like the smell it is so damn smooth and not overpowering at all. I love the chocolate notes flirting with the vanilla notes from the barrels. The dark fruits come out mid sip and in the finale the alcohol makes itself known but does not burn. I mean there is absolutely no burn from the alcohol like you'd think at 13%. It has aged perfectly and the heat is GONE!  M: Perfection and this is not an understatement IMO. The viscosity is lovely as it coates every nook and cranny of my mouth including on the swallow. This is so smooth for a huge beer I can't describe it. This baby lingers forever and even coates my lips as I take a drink. I do get that wonderful alcohol warming sensation after a while as it is now hitting my head. This beer has the perfect mouthfeel for its style for me. It is chewy, thick and oh so good!  O: This has always been my favorite Imperial stout and the 2008 vintage only shows itself off even more so. This is absolute, unbelievable, mind blowing perfection. If you get a chance to trade for a 2008 vintage I recommend you do it. Believe me you will not be disappointed!

1549,10672,thebornotaku,5,"First things first, full disclosure. I've only had three or four gulps of this beer. IT was given to me by a friend at a car club meet kind of off-hand and he told me I could kill it. I had no idea what I was in for...  aaaand what I was in for was easily the best thing I have ever tasted; food, beer or otherwise. After my first drink I had to stop and admire the brilliance that I was holding. No, this wasn't just any other kind of beer that I had ever had... this was the pinnacle. This was the moment at prom when you saw the girl you've been in love with for your entire high school career from across the dance floor, time slowed down, you realized how truly beautiful she was and you decided to _go for it_.  The flavor was sublime. Strong in all the right ways, but still mellow and balanced. The high ABV was noticeable, but it played off well. Aged since 2009, any harshness or bite of the alcohol had been diminished significantly. Flavors of coffee, vanilla, toffee, chocolate and obviously bourbon were present, dancing around the palate. It wasn't too thick or thin in the mouth -- it was nice and creamy but still well carbonated and balanced.  I really hope that some day I'm able to pick up more of this. I've been searching but it's prohibitively expensive online ($200 for 4 22s!) and incredibly rare. Easily though the best beer I have ever had.

Pours jet black with a thin brown/tan head and pretty significant lacing on the glass. Smell is a wonderful mix of bourbon and chocolate - literally like a bourbon-soaked brownie. It's actually pretty incredible that the aroma isn't very boozy considering how big this beer is. Flavor follows the nose and really takes it to the next level. The bourbon and chocolate flavors really come together perfectly. It's sweet, but not overly so, and it's got a nice little bit of roast in the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink given the ABV. Mouthfeel is very thick and mouth-coating, but still has good carbonation. This is the beer that really taught me that I could love stouts a couple of years ago when I thought stouts weren't for me, so it will always hold a special place in my heart.

The beer has an extremely thin dark mocha head which quickly reduces to an extremely thin ring at the edges of the glass. Very little lacing is observed.  S: Some dark roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, and just a hint of bourbon. This smells great and has great complexity to the aroma.  T: Surprisingly, it tastes even better than it smells. The flavor starts out a little sweet with some dark fruit (possibly just fig) and some lovely dark roasted malts. Then you get the caramel, brown sugar, and chocolate flavors. After that, you get just a light hint of what seems to be coconut. Finally, the bourbon flavors come out in the finish - lots of vanilla and oak coupled with some bourbon smoothness.  M: Medium to full bodied with very light amounts of carbonation. Extremely smooth, almost velvety.  O: This is a really special beer, one that you want to enjoy but wouldn't want to drink every day - it might just ruin your ability to enjoy lesser beers. It is a great sipping beer and one that I am thoroughly enjoying. Glad that I was able to get an aged version. There is a lot of complexity in the aroma and the taste and it appears that by aging, the harshness of the alcohol has been completely diminished (it is hardly even noticeable).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mfavoino,4.45,"2010 bottled marked 9/24/10 enjoyed in a snifter.  Appearance: Jet black with a very thin layer of espresso colored head that lines the glass.  Smell: Roasted malts are prominent with potent chocolate, caramel, and bourbon aromas. Alcohol is noticeable too. Intense.  Taste: Begins sweet with lots of roasted malt flavors including the aforementioned caramel. Chocolate flavors provide some more sweetness to the this complex stout. I was picking out different flavors as I went along, and as it warmed, got more of the bourbon flavor. Finishes with a warm alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel: Heavy and thick with little carbonation. Alcohol warms the back of the mouth all the way down into the chest.  Overall: This is one big, complex stout. Great flavors that make it a real treat.

A- Black as sin with a barely 1/2 inch head that disappears into slight lacing  S- Bourbon, oak & coffee with hints of toffee and dark fruit  T- Dark chocolate, coffee & black cherry. The bourbon was subdued but a definite booze taste.  M- Like a tasty oil slick enveloping your mouth.

1549,10672,ProfPayne,4.95,"Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout is one of my all time favorite beers.  I've had several vintages and have yet to be let down. When it gets up to 15% alcohol, it becomes almost a tad bit too thick and viscous for me, but I still love it. To me, this is the epitome of aging beer in wood. You absolutely get the bourbon character but it isn't overpowering. And, the beer is incredibly integrated. I buy bottles whenever I can, but I'll never forget my first experience, which was on tap at Brasserie V in Madison Wisconsin. It was love at first sip!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MrVonzipper,4.4,"Pours like black oil. When swirled you get a 1/4"" brown head for a few seconds. No lace.  Lovely nose with rich dark fruit soaked in bourbon and rum. Very pleasant and rich overall but that kind of sums up the nose for me.   Flavor is huge and deep. Wide range of flavor ranging from drunken dark fruit to oaky bourbon and faint vanilla. Very rich and string flavor yet with very nice balance and variation.   Mouthfeel is full bodied, sticky with mild creamy and velvety carbonation.   Overall, just a phenomenal beer. Huge flavor, range and depth. The only point I can knock is the lack of head. ",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Adrianized,4.67,"Poured into a snifter.  Pours pitch black with hues of dark mocha. Thin dark espresso head dissipates to nothing but a ring around the glass.  Huge bourbon nose is followed with dark chocolate, prunes, grapes, brown sugar, molasses, coffee, and vanilla.  Milky, creamy vanilla and chocolate. Lots of bourbon. Dark fruit and black licorice. Roasted malt in the middle and finishes mildly bitter. There's no denying the alcohol burn, but it's still smooth given the 14.5% ABV.  Thick, viscous, and very creamy. Light carbonation prickles your tongue. Perfect.  Worth all the hype. Amazing bourbon barrel stout!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,eclipse54,4.42,"*First time combining multiple vintages of a brew for review, so hopefully this isn't too far off center format-wise.  (Current review from 03/10/2012)  A 12 ounce bottle of the 2011 batch, generously sent by FluffyMcTingle; thanks again man! Bottled 11/2011, and consumed tonight via DFH signature glass.  A - 4.0 - Pours a dark brown, nearly black, with a thin veil of dark chocolate colored head. The head fades almost immediately to a ring around the edge of the glass and bubbly legs scattered across the surface.  S - 4.5 - The aroma is of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, oak, toasted marshmallow, and brown sugar.  T - 4.5 - It tastes of caramel, vanilla, oak, toffee, dark chocolate/cacao, bourbon, and burnt sugar. There is an alcohol presence near the end.  M - 4.0 - Mouthfeel is thick, and this once coats every inch of the palate. Syrupy texture, resinous finish, and warming alcohol sensation throughout.  O - 4.5 - Overall, a delicious stout that brings out the best of the barrel treatment.  Final Weighted Score: 4.43  ---  (Review from 11/20/2011)  A 12 ounce bottle of the 2009 vintage sent to me by inlimbo77; thank you very much for this one! Bottled on 11/12/2009, so this is very nearly two years old at this point. Poured into a Deschutes tulip glass...  A - 3.5 - It pours a richly black body with dark caramel hues near the surface; this transitions into a similarly colored head. Head development was minimal, not surprising given the high alcohol content (and a strange bottle-opening occurance). Regardless, a ring of coffee-colored bubbles and similar patches dot the surface of the liquid. Lacing is nonexistent.  S - 4.5 - The aroma is of toffee, bourbon, oak, hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, and alcohol. Really a phenomenal nose here, and very inviting to those who seek the bourbon-aged effect.  T - 4.5 - The taste is similar with toffee, caramel, bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, almond, and alcohol all blending together beautifully. It is quite reminiscent of a stout blended with an English barleywine, which is fine by me!  M - 4.0 - The mouthfeel is very good as the carbonation lifts the rich texture off the tongue and accentuates some of the finer flavors. The finish is great, but the alcohol really comes through in the end with a bit of a burning sensation. No doubt that this is 13% here.  O - 4.5 - Overall, a well crafted, delicious offering that I will certainly need to acquire more of.

1549,10672,mkotsayfan,4.35,"2011 vintage. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a deep dark oily black with a minimal amount of dark mocha head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma has lots of bourbon, some black licorice, with some chocolate and roasted malts mixed in. The taste is a better mix of the aroma notes than was to be expected. Even though the bourbon shines through on this heavy ABV beer, the chocolate/coconut/roasted malt notes really balance it out. The mouthfeel is thick bodied with decent carbonation, and a nice silky smooth quality.

1549,10672,Goblinmunkey7,4.38,"2009 Vintage. Thanks to bilco for sharing the bottle.  Appearance: Deep, deep brown/black. It's almost there. Head is almost non-existent. Dark tan for what it is. Very still. Almost no carbonation.  Smell: Deep roasty sweetness. Booze and more booze. Toffee, caramel, and sweetness. Did I mention it smells sweet. Still, there's a great depth to be found. Oak lingers and rounds out some of the rougher alcohol edges. Age does wonders for this thing. The flavors roll around each other.  Taste: Burnt malts and then some. Roasted malts play an equal part and help bring some sweetness to the burnt edges. Sweetness from the nose comes through as well. Big caramel sweetness leans toward toffee and even brown sugar at times. A ton of sweetness. Alcohol heat on the back. Some faint hints of char, but it's all burnt sweetness.  Overall: Dessert beer in the purest sense. It's intense and well-worth finding and drinking. As an aperitif or a nightcap or even as a stand-alone beer, it's amazing. Crazy flavor profile that can't be found anywhere else. Almost too much at times, but never crosses that line.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Mahlik,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a Deschutes snifter. 2010 vintage.  A - Pours a jet black with no head whatsoever. No lacing. Just a sticky film is left behind on the sides of the glass. The beer appears to be very viscous, similar to motor oil.  S- The aroma is what you expect from a big imperial stout. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee and bourbon hit the nose first. Lots of noticeable alcohol. As the beer warms, dark fruits, caramel and wood notes become more apparent.  T- This starts out quite sweet but smooths itself out. Brown sugar, toasted caramel with a roasty character. Chocolate and coffee notes blend in. Vanilla and bourbon finishes it out.  M- Full body with little to no carbonation. Thick and chewy but finishes smooth. There is some warmth from the alcohol but nothing you would expect from a 13% ABV imperial stout.  O- An outstanding imperial stout. It took me quite a while to finally get my hands on some BCBS but it was worth the wait. This has all the characteristics that a big imperial stout should have. I'd really like to try this fresh to see how it compares. But I at least know that this beer can hold up for a few years.

1549,10672,shangwang,4.35,"2009 vintage, tasted along with 2011 KBS. Poured into a Chimay goblet. I've been hanging on to this one for a while, so I was very excited to try it.  Poured with no head, just a thin circle of white around the outer edges of the glass, and barely any lacing. Swirling it around kicked up a little foam, but it dissipated quickly. Jet black color, with a high viscosity. Smelled sweet of raisins and vanilla, with a boozy undercurrent. Also maybe a little chocolate in the smell. The bourbon was very apparent in the taste - not so much the presence of intense alcohol, but more in the oaky vanilla flavor that was dominant. There was a roasted maltiness as well, and a slight hoppiness that translated to a rather bitter finish. Nice dichotomy between the sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel was medium in weight (heavier than the KBS) with a decent level of carbonation resulting in a creamy texture.  This was an excellent beer, and I'm even more excited to try the coffee version as it was the only flavors I really found myself missing. Having tried it alongside KBS, I believe KBS has the more complex flavor profile, and I missed some of the subtle nuances of KBS, but BCBS definitely stands up on its own and is fantastic.

Very small tan head disappears immediately.  S: A very intense smell. Dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits. A little bit of smoky oak.  T: Complexity is king. There are so many flavors it's hard to tell what I am tasting. There are certainly the notes chocolate and coffee are present and strong. They are bittersweet and complemented by vanilla. Oak and smoke are more prominent, and meld with the moderate alcohol heat. The bourbon is not overpowering and fits in nicely with the beer. There are mild notes of leather and tobacco. It is a very sweet beer for the most part.  M: Thick and oily. A moderate amount of alcohol heat and a little sticky.  O: An amazing beer.

Aroma is intense, probably the strongest aroma I have encountered in a stout. Rich maltiness, vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate are all present in an intense aroma.  Taste is similar. The alcohol is strong enough to take your breath away but not that harsh due to the intense, rich flavor. Evidence of the bourbon barrel aging is very present but not to the level where it could be unpleasant. Rich maltiness - both bready and caramel smooth out the flavors with the vanilla and chocolate adding complexity.  Mouthfeel is rich, the alcohol is quite noticeable which would probably die down a bit with aging. Not much carbonation, but you would expect that with such a rich beer.  All in all, very worthy of its place in the top 100 beers of fame.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,falloutsnow,4.05,"Bottle shared by CE (much thanks), from Beertopia in Omaha, NE Bottled in 2011 Poured into an Ommegang tall glass  Goose Island's BCBS is an excellent-tasting American double stout. Given its strength and flaws (in my opinion), it is a beer best shared with friends. My opinion is that while this is a good beer, it is, ultimately, overly hyped.  Pours a 0.5cm head of dark tan to light brown, made of smallish bubbles, that almost immediately fades away into oblivion. Ethanol content kills any head retention possibilities. Leaves no lacing. Body is very dark brown to black, impenetrable, unable to see what carbonation profile is like. Fairly standard for the style, I don't think this deserves ""good"" when it's just ""ok.""  Aroma is deeply bourbon-influenced, overpowering most of what discernible chocolate notes I can detect. Maybe some vanilla, but I may be stretching for it. Ethanol detectable in the back of the nose. Good, but somewhat disappointing here, doesn't seem particularly balanced with the bourbon barrel usage (deep, but not complex).  Taste is quite different from my experience so far. Succinctly, it is fairly amazing. Very deep, complex flavors, bringing in everything available in an extremely roasted, big beer like this. I get roasted malt, char/ash, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, and ethanol. Aftertaste is slightly sweet, heavy on the coffee, somewhat like coffee ice cream.  Body is fairly heavy, perhaps medium-heavy, with fairly modest carbonation. The combination goes well, giving this a fairly heavy mouthfeel that is still well-flowing across the palate. Alcohol is well felt in the back of throat and in nostrils, but you can't hide 14% I suppose.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste- The taste is more of the same. Dark chocolate and bits of alcohol. Mouthfeel- Expect the mouthfeel of this to be huge. It covers your mouth with chocolate goodness and doesn't go away anytime soon. Overall- Overall, this is a good beer. Very sweet. The 13% abv is non-existent. This is an after dinner sipper.

1549,10672,Hophead717,4.8,"A 2011 vintage 12 oz bottle poured into a CBS snifter. Enjoyed fresh.  A: Dark as the night, with a barely noticeable head that dissipates instantly. Unimpressive--definitely not seeing the three finger head from the BCBS advertising!  S: Rich dark chocolate with some bitter malt upfront. Then, a rush of bourbon overwhelms the nose. A most lovely bourbon, with notes of the alcohol heat definitely present.  T: Deep, rich chocolate malts upfront. A noticeable bitterness from the hops comes mid-sip. The finish is a delightful bourbon--not overly sweet. The bourbon hangs around even after you swallow. Quite lovely.  M: Medium bodied, with more carbonation than I'd expect from such a large stout.  O: A lovely BA stout. I can see why this baby is so highly sought-after.  2007 bottle, enjoyed in June 2012.  The nose has much deeper and strong dark fruits notes--bourbon soaked raisins and figs.  Chocolate and bourbon still dominate the taste, but none of the hoppiness noted before. Significant dark fruit flavors, but no significant signs of oxidation at all. The beer was nearly flat, however.  Overall, really good, but I suspect the sweet spot is somewhere between fresh and 4.5 years.

Sweet caramel, molasses, toffee, sweet bourbon of course, earthy foundation.  t/m - Here we go. God DAMN. The best part hits you right off the bat - thick, sweet cloying caramel, chocolate, fading into a sweet bourbon burn with a candy-like oil slick finish. The mouthfeel is so perfectly in line with the taste that it's nearly impossible for me to consider the two independent of one another. The feel is perfect in my mind - tons of substance, really appropriate for the taste.

This doesn't leave much in the way of lace, but at this high of an ABV, that really isn't too shocking. Near perfect for the style.  The aroma is rich, complex, evolving, and simply: amazing. There are layers of bitter and sweet chocolates, complementary roast presence, rich, sweet, and earthy vanilla, mild wood presence, dark molasses, and unmistakable bourbon. There is but a hint of alcohol heat in the aroma, but very little considering this beer's alcoholic magnitude. Divine.  The flavor is just as complex and delicious. The vanilla notes from the bourbon are the highlight, with layers of chocolate and roast rounding out any harsh edges, and there even seems to be a bit of a coffee presence as well. Zero alcohol presence. Incredibly drinkable. I swear...this is nearly as good as Rare.  Full bodied, velvety, luscious, smooth mouthfeel. A pleasure to sip.  The two years in the back of the cellar have done wondrous things to this beer. I've had this beer fresh a number of times, and this was by far the best of the bunch.

1549,10672,amcmaho1,4.62,"I've had multiple vintages of this beer, but am currently reviewing a 2007 vintage, courtesy of crushedvol. Thanks again!! *from notes  Appearance: Pretty standard obsidian black, with a short lived khaki colored head. There's no head retention whatsoever, but there are some significant alcohol legs. It's really a beautiful beer to look at.  Smell: Wow, tons of black licorice hit me right away. There's some nice powdered cocoa and light coffee on the nose too, but the black licorice is really shining. I'm still getting some definite bourbon notes on the nose, but it has definitely integrated itself more than in fresher bottles. The take-away was bourbony vanilla, lots of dark fruits, and definite black licorice...really, 5 years hasn't abused this beer too bad at all haha.  Taste: Again, black licorice and dark fruits come through most strongly. The bourbon is there as well, as are the chocolate and coffee flavors. The vanilla I was picking up on the nose definitely makes itself known in the taste, and accompanies the dark fruits really nicely. I'd be lying if i didn't say I wanted more bourbon in the taste, but the integration through the age of this beer has really worked the bourbon in in a more subtle way...amazing beer.  Mouthfeel: Well, here's where we fall apart. One of my favorite qualities about BCBS, is it's viscosity. This beer was very thin...very very thin. I suppose 5 years can do this to a beer, so I ought to be more understanding. Regardless, the mouthfeel is the only thing preventing this beer from absolute greatness.  Overall: It was an honor getting to try this vintage. BCBS has always been a favorite of mine, and while I enjoy fresher bottles, for their ferocity and bourbon focus...the integration of flavors over 5 years has proven to be magnificent. I'd have to say that my vote for favorite BCBS vintage so far, is still the 2008...by that's neither here nor there.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Not much head, about a half finger of a dark tan head, that formed a thin collar around the snifter. Swirling this around creates a nice glazing.  S) Top shelf aroma. Just tons of vanilla, and hint of caramel. Deep roast and sweetness. The perfect touch of that bourbon cask aroma.  T) Fantastic... Full of chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla and certainly bourbon. This is well layered, and is the perfect storm of flavors. The balance is incredible.  M) Full bodied, not much carbonation, which was expected. This is rich and smooth.

1549,10672,Dope,4.52,"2011 vintage, just procured.  A: Pitch black pour with a chocolate brown head. Almost no head to speak of and fades away instantly. Obviously no notable lacing.  S: Tons of bourbon. Toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar and a touch of vanilla. Some dark fruit like raisins, plums and cherries. Just a tad bit of roasted malt, mostly drowned out by the bourbon.  T: Ahhh there we go. Up front the luscious bourbon comes through as mentioned in the smell, but now a boatload of roasted malt. As the boozy toffee/molasses/caramel concoction dies down, then come the rest. Wonderfully bitter coffee and chocolate mixed with the dark fruits. Mocha stamps the tongue and lasts well into the aftertaste. I taste a little brown sugar in the aftertaste sometimes too. Surprisingly balanced given the almost pure bourbon smell, and especially the freshness of the bottle. As it warms, the stout becomes stronger and the bourbon becomes just a big bite up front and a complimentary flavor in the middle.  M: Thick, creamy, and in a word - big.  O: This is a seriously good bourbon barrel stout. I don't know how I've gone all these years without trying it. It's huge and bourbony but well balanced at the same time. Very complex, lots of roasted malt flavors as well as dark fruits and then there's the bourbon characteristics. Taste something different every time I sip.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,angrybabboon,4.67,"Cheers to Bilco for sharing this  Note: 2009 vintage  Review adapted from notes taken 2/3/12  Appearance: Pours heavy, about as dark brown as brown can be without being black - dark tan head, fades pretty quickly (this is an older bottle, so whatever), leaves spotty lacing  Smell: Bourbon, chocolate, and perhaps a sprinkle of magic - burnt, roasted, and dry - caramel, burnt sugar, wood, vanilla, dark chocolate, semisweet chocolate - tons of depth, very decadent  Taste: A brilliant melding of flavors - bourbon, wood, vanilla, baker's chocolate, dark chocolate - slightly charred, definitely burnt, with hints of super burnt coffee - a lot of dry alcohol, which is somehow not boozy - just a touch of sweetness, some burnt bitterness, tons of flavors working together here  Mouthfeel: Luxuriously heavy, chewy, an adequate amount of carbonation, nice alcohol burn  Overall: Perhaps only surpassed by its one-offs...  Prior to this night, I had only had small samples of this beer. And I had only experienced it relatively fresh. With some age, this is nothing short of epic. Bourbon sometimes doesn't work in a beer. With BCBS, it's an essential component.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Aiptasia,4.5,"Now this is what I call a stout boilermaker done right. A bottle of 2008 vintage sent to me courtesy of Jmagnus87. Sampled from a pint glass.  A: Darkness, completely void of light. No light penetrates the viscous beer. No lacing. No head. Just the briefest fizz when rousted to let you know it has some carbonation.  S: Smells of wet roasted barley malt, kentucky bourbon, caramel toffe and alcohol.  T: Wow. This is a beer that rivals The Underdark by Intuition Brewing, my favorite stout ever. Big roasted malts, coffee flavor and light lime citrus from the hops right before the bourbon flavors wash it all away on the back end. Absolutely delicious. Underdark only wins because I can get it very fresh and slightly more hoppy.  M: Wet, warming and chewy with a definite bourbon alcohol sting. Full bodied and practically nil carbonation.

Poured into a New Belgium globe, served @ close to 45 degrees, and drank over the course of two hours, allowing the beer to properly acclimate.  A: Used motor oil comes to mind...pretty viscous, jet black. A hard pour produces a touch of dark khaki-colored head which quickly fades...epic alcohol feet all over the glass.  S: Bourbon maybe? Oh yes. Lots of sweetness, vanilla, wood. Some dark roasty malt base underneath that. Very bourbon-forward without being too boozy.  T: Vanilla and bourbon sweetness upfront. There is a good amount of booze but its not distracting. Oak, hints of a boozy milk chocolate...definite traces of burnt caramel and butterscotch characters, probably from the whiskey. A touch of smoke hits on the finish, and then the warmth hits your chest.  MF: Creamy and silky-smooth full body...viscous and sticky on your lips and on the glass. The alcohol doesn't thin the mouthfeel too badly.  O: Pretty awesome. A huge beer, definitely a sipper. I haven't tried an aged version of this, I think a 2-3 year old bottle would absolutely be amazing. Pretty hot right now.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

There is a hint of roasty coffee as well.  T: I get a very brief chocolate flavor, followed by a pleasant punch of bourbon fading into a roasty sweetness. There is a bit of a coffee finish and some vanilla notes as well. I could see the bourbon perceived as being ""hot"" as this point but I find it very pleasant.  M: Coats the entire mouth with a thick smoothness. Carbonation seems medium, about perfect really for this big beer.  O: Surprisingly very drinkable right now.

(on being offered water for his drink in the movie ""The Quiet Man"")  I loves me some bourbon. I loves me some stout. Just not together, I guess.  Poured from a bomber into a goblet a thick rich black with ruby edges and a thin amber head that immediately fled, no lacing whatsoever.  The nose is caramel and bourbon with a hint of old socks. It's deep, rich, complex...and not to my liking.  Mouthfeel is richer than the nose or appearance combined. Velvety and viscous, beer should feel like this in your mouth.  For me, the sour (maybe even rancid?) flavor of most beers finished in bourbon barrels is a deal breaker. This one has layers of caramel, vanilla deep malt sweetness...and that off putting ""Wang"" of those Kentucky barrels that once held so much goodness.  If I'm rating the beer & not my tastes, this one has plenty of complex layers, but we all bring our own tastes with us, where ever we go.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The smell of bourbon is strong and really nice. Oak scents are there as well. Chocolate and molasses underneath, resulting in a slight sweetness. The bourbon is really nice, strong but not overwhelming.  Taste is lovely. Bourbon and oak are present just like in the nose, but accompanied by a lovely taste of vanilla. Roasted malt, chocolate and a bit of coffee, particularly at the aftertaste. Although the bottle is pretty young, the bourbon is amazingly well integrated. Despite the strength of the beer, the whole thing is very smooth and the alcohol is (comparatively) well hidden.  Body is very smooth and quite silky, low carbonation. Some alcohol heat.  Overall? Fantastic. My first opportunity to try this and it more than lives up to the hype.

M: there is real carbonation on this beer, though it's medium-light. Heavy mouthfeel is lightened by the carbonation slightly, but it's still thick (and exactly what I wanted).

Small cardboard colored head that hangs around for a short amount of time. Leaves a small brown ring with a nice thin film. Gorgeous.  S - Wow. Way complex. Bourbon is all over this beer, with some dark cherry, vanilla and chocolate. Smells like a high-end dessert. I can't believe just sitting in a barrel can impart so much bourbon note.  T - Smash, bang, boom. This beer has it all. Intense bourbon notes, followed by a tiny bit of alcohol burn. Vanilla, chocolate and a bit of anise hit hard on the follow through. Again, all this bourbon from just sitting in a barrel? Awesome. Post-sip leaves a ridiculous taste of dark chocolate cake.  M - Pretty darn good. Could use a tad more ""creaminess"". Being fresh, I would imagine that this will only get smoother with some time on it. This beer is thick and it will coat your mouth. No worries though, as it's a delicious coating.  O - Fantastic. Home-run of a huge beer. I was surprised at how good this was fresh, and I can't imagine what a few years will do to these bottles. I can't wait to find out.  Search this beer out.

1549,10672,seedsofchaos,4.81,"Big thanks to Greg at Pinch Penny for hooking us up with a 2007 BCBS that we could try along with a 2011. We did a side-by-side of the two last night and what follows is kind of a dual review.  Both poured fairly consistent. Low carbonation. A bit oily. Thick and syrupy but not overly clingy. No head. Skimmings and swirls of cocoa. Blacker than midnight. Bourbon County has never been all that inspiring to look at other than its hue. Forget science. Forget black holes. This beast absorbs any light that dares come near.  In both vintages, taste mirrors the bouquet. While the 2011 is still a bit alcohol hot, it still has wonderful flavors and aromas that are immediately reminiscent of a dollop of butter and brown sugar with the smooth and velvety mouthfeel to match. 2011 BCBS is Heath bar toffee, chocolate and caramel meets bourbon and vanilla. The 2007 vintage has much more complexity that centers around the oak barrels themselves. Oak, bourbon and hints of licorice take center stage. While both beers, naturally, have similar flavors the differences are pretty substantial.  Overall, this is our house favorite barrel-aged stout. A big, complex and sweet stout that mellows over time can definitely stand up to cellar-aging and would probably still taste great after another 5 years.

1549,10672,cbeer88,4.79,"12oz bottle poured into Delirium snifter. Reviewed blindly from Blind BIF #6. (Revealed to be 2007 vintage)  Appearance: Dark inky black slithers out of the bottle and into my glass with nary a bit of head. The few bubbles up there on the edges are a dark mocha in appearance. Almost no lacing at all.  Smell: Holy bourbon Batman! Oak and vanilla and spices - bourbon bomb all the way. Toffee in there too.  Taste: I know what you are. :) Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout all the way - the flavor is unmistakably Bourbon County Stout. Rich, molasses, toffee, roasted malt, wood, and bourbon make up the delicious base beer. There is some definite age on this one - slight oxidization flavor and a bit smoother and more integrated than the only BCBS I've ever had ('09). Well blended.  Mouthfeel: Amazingly, still quite hot, even though I can tell this has some years on it. I guess if you want to dance with this devil, then you're going to taste the heat no matter what you do. Low carbed and full bodied.  Drinkability: Good for what she is, but boy is this a sipper.  Overall: What hasn't been said about this beer? It's sublime.

By the shape of the bottle & previous two I assume (once again) I know what this beer is. BCBS  A Rich, dark, black with beautiful chocolate brown head. Big legs on this beer. Head retention is perfect and fades to a nice coating on top of the beer, like a little blanket. 5  S This is definitely Bourbon County. You cannot confuse BCBS with any other beer. The smells of bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate, maple syrup, alcohol and the smell of a 1000 virgins lying in wait. 5  T - Ok, we have an older vintage. This has mellowed out quite a bit and is not as hot as fresh BCBS, all smells are transferred onto the palate (trying to remember how else it was described). Chase is guessing this is an '07, but i believe it to be the '08. 5  M - This is extremely think and rich. I am missing the heat that i enjoy from this beer but it is still holding together extremely well. 4.5  O This beer, as always (still guessing BCBS) is so damn delicious!

Being sure to share a bit with our bartender at Beermongers, we poured this one into a snifter. Color looked black, but was in fact the darkest of browns, with ruby tints, and a bubbly ringlet for a head. Big time bourbon in the aroma, along with scents of roasted malts and semi-sweet chocolate. Huge complexity in the taste, with obvious notes of bourbon-drenched oak up front, accompanied by some alcohol warmth. Mid-palate brought in notes of chocolate-covered cherries, dark malts, vegetal vanilla bean. A huge coffee profile in the finish. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel, full-bodied and robustly chewy.

S - Huge barrel aging qualities up front with aromas of bourbon, vanilla and oak. Some cocoa notes in the background along with a faint roasted malt aroma.  T - A great balance of flavours from the barrel - bourbon, vanilla and oak - are evident up front. The background has a light roasted malt profile with faint hints of cocoa. The barrel aging qualities definitely dominate this one. Considering the 13% ABV, this is smooth. The alcohol is warming though and it lingers in the finish.  M - Full bodied. Thick and viscous.

1549,10672,AndyAvalanche,4.62,"12 oz. bottle (twist off cap???) dated 2009 poured into a Duvel Tulip Style glass. Comes out a dark brown, getting close to black. There are brown to dark brown highlights where the liquid gets a little thinner. Not much in the way, but there is a brown sugar colored head that goes away to a skinny ring. Little bit of lacing, but skimming of the liquid will make its way back down to the pool a little bit more slowly. Overall a pretty good looking stout.  Smell is good, close to great. This should be the standard of what a quality bourbon barrel stout should be. Very roasty and sweet without being a sugar bomb. Woody, brown sugar, and vanilla aromas all tickle the nose before bourbon whiskey. All very good, but would be better if it were a bit stronger. I was surprised to have let this one warm up a bit as long as I did.  Taste is good in pretty much every way. Where the scent lacks in boldness, the flavor makes up for It's again super roasty, dark bittersweet chocolate and slight coffee. Huge flavors of vanilla and there's a charred wood smokiness to it as well that hides in the back there. Really a great tasting beer and it gets better as it sits for a while, nothing not to like about it. Gets a 5 at room temp  Mouthfeel is good, lighter end of full bodied. Smooth, weak carbonation. Good combination of bitter, sweet, and smokey. It's a bit hot, 13% is easily detectable. Very drinkable, a nice sipper, goes pretty quick.  Really nothing not to like about this beer.

1549,10672,Rhettroactive,4.82,"From 12oz bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 12/8/11 *From notes  -- Vintage 2011 --  A: One of the darkest liquids I've come across. Pitch black from top to bottom. A hard pour yields a minimal and loose .25 finger head that dissipates rather quickly. No real collar or lacing to speak of.  S: Buckets and buckets of delicious and well balanced bourbon. Toasted vanilla and coconut are dominant, and lays down the gauntlet for what's yet to come.  T: Utterly spectacular. With just the first sip, I'm easily able to determine that this is one of the best beers I've ever had. The balance of concentrated dark fruits, rich chocolate brownie batter, medium toast, vanilla bean and coconut shavings is pitch perfect. Though it's slightly hot, it in no ways prevents this from being epically delicious.  M: Whenever someone says viscous, this is what I'm gonna think of. Motor oil comes to mind. Really, it feels like my tongue is drilling an oil well in the south Texas heat. Just incredible.  O: I'm really dissapointed in myself for waiting this long to finally get into Goose Island's BCBS. Words aren't enough to describe my love for this wicked sensation. This is addiction in a bottle - I could literally sip this anytime, anywhere, all day. BCBS has set the Imperial Stout benchmark, and easily ranks in my top two or three favorite beers of all time.  *UPDATE: On 12/16/11, siege06nd, IrishColonial and myself got together to open my five year BCBS vertical ('07-'11). Here is the final collective outcome of the tasting, from top to bottom:  2008: Our hands down favorite. This is a special vintage. 2011: Not far behind. In time, this may be considered the best of the BCBS vintages. 2009: Solid. Delicious in it's own right, yet not quite up to the level of the '08 or '11. 2007: This is showing it's age. Barrel characterics are fading. 2010: In a weird place. On it's own it may be top shelf. But within the BCBS vertical, it was far behind the rest of the proverbial pack.  **UPDATE #2: On 3/24/12, a small group of friends and I got together to venture even deeper into the BCBS portfolio:  2005: Much roastier then any other vintage. It seems that GI had not yet gotten a firm grip on where they wanted to take this beer. All in all though, it's still drinking incredibly well. 2006: Now this is what I'm talking about!

Alcohol is lightly noticable, despite 14.5% ABV.  M: Full body. High viscosity. Malt and bourbon create a feel that is thick, rich, and completely covers the palate and sticks. Semi-wet finish.  O: Wow. Re-donk-u-lous. I have had Rare, Coffee, and Vanilla, and this is exactly where all of them came from. Sometimes when variants of a beer are made, you wonder what was done to the original to come up with such a vastly different variation. Not here. This beer is world-class, all on its own. I feel like if I put some fresh vanilla I would get BCBVS, same for the other variants. This is a great beer, extremely well balanced fresh, and will get better with age. Even though it is pricey, I will buy all I can get.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The aroma is rich with strong notes of oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and dark fruits.  Each sip of this full bodied beer is syrupy and chewy with mild carbonation. The flavor is rich and loaded with oak, vanilla, chocolate, toffee and roasted malt. At the end bitter piney hops make an attempt to balance out all the sweet malt. The alcohol is hot at the end. Once gone the oak, vanilla and dark fruit lingers on the palate.  Wow! What a full flavored, tasty beer. Definitely a sipper.

Pretty mellow but still strong flavors.  --2009 Bottle in 2013 A year later... Same appearance and score. The smell has mellowed. The alcohol is less intense. The alcohol in the taste has lessened as well. I like it more, but I can't score it any higher.  It smoothed out in the year.

A tan head barely covers the surface and quickly dissipates to holding on the edges of the glass.  S - From a foot away I can smell it. Strong alcohol and oak. Up closer it is molasses, caramel, vanilla and port.  T - Alcohol, roasted and burnt malt, vanilla, charred wood at the back of the mouth, a light grabbing bitterness at the end. Very rich flavor.  M - Looks like tar and has the same viscosity. It could stop a bullet. Hardly any carbonation.  D - Very well done. I tend to not enjoy the barrel aged beers as much as others. Usually it is because of an overpowering alcohol taste, however, this one balances out the alcohol very well.

Good bourbon presence with dark chocolate, malts and roast. Some dark fruit and molasses.  T- Nice beautiful bourbon balance, they truly are the pioneers of this art. For a fresh bourbon aged stout it as some heat but its so smooth. The chocolate and dark malt flavor helps calm it a little. I cant wait to try one aged!!!!

The smell is beautifully deep and complex on it's own. This is going to be a fantastic beer!  T: Strong bourbon jumps to the taste buds then quickly washes to bright chocolate. Still has that alcohol burn that can't be ignored. Eventually comes to rest as a roasted dark chocolate. Fusel alcohol helps to bring new flavors to the foreground with each additional sip.  M: Medium body that goes down so smooth. Little carbonation is present. Alcohol tingle briefly touches the tongue as the beer runs over it.  O: Wow, this is without doubt one of the best Bourbon Barrel Stouts I've ever had, if not the absolute best! So complex but everything works together so well. It's just incredible!

1549,10672,zoso1967,4.3,"2011 Vintage  Bourbon County Brand Stout pours a deep, impenetrable black brown. I can tell after starting the pour that carbonation is low, but even changing to a very aggressive pour did little to coax a head out of this brew. What little foam there is has a mocha color and fades quickly. It lacing is moderate.  The nose is full of vanilla, bourbon and oak. In fact, I get more bourbon notes than beer notes coming out of the gate, though chocolate and roasty coffee like aromas do come out as my nose get’s used to the boozy bouquet. There is also a nice dark fruit like character that is appreciable and is something I often smell in big stouts like this.  The flavor is much like the aroma in that the bourbon hits you full on at the start of the sip and then slowly yields to a rich, chocolaty and roasty stout. This beer has a wonderful oaky vanilla character that melds so well with the richness from the malts. The beer does not hide its heat well, but that is part of the appeal.  The mouthfeel is medium to full with a very small amount of carbonation. I was expecting this to be fuller, but it is not disappointing at all. The finish is full of vanilla and bitter cocoa notes as well as some coffee.  It’s hard to believe that it took me this long to try this brew, even though I have tasted both the Coffee version and the Rare. It is by far the most bourbon laced of any barrel aged stout I have tried, but it seems well engineered to hold up to the barrel aging. This is a decadent sipper of a beer and I am looking forward to trying the other bottle with some age on it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nose is chocolatey, molasses, fumy alcohol, dark fruits like raisins and prunes, hints of coffee and vanilla. Subtle oakiness; prominent bourbon.  Big time complex flavor with immediate booziness but still not overly hot or unpleasant. All the notes of the aroma are present in the taste: chocolate, raisin, prune, rich maltiness, coffee, vanilla, lots of bourbon. More woodiness underneath.  Sticky, tremendously syrupy, viscous and chewy mouthfeel. Low carbonation and very full bodied. The flavor lingers quite a bit as the booze warms you.

1549,10672,pmarlowe,4.59,"2011 vintage. 12oz bottle to tulip glass.  A: Pours viscous black, a spectrum of copper to light brown on the rim, with a cap of dark khaki head which fizzles out cola-style to a sliver and then disappears, leaving a still surface.  S: Vanilla and the signature cake batter, vanilla ice cream, layered over whiskey and chocolate, with a little sweetness which complements the aromas beautifully. A big aroma that smells phenomenal.  T: Bourbon and vanilla, a little booze, rich chocolate fudge (both in flavor and heft), vanilla ice cream, and finishing with some residual sugar. The alcohol taste knocks this a few points, although I think the flavors mask this more as it warms (and it's hard to complain given this is at 14%).  M: Full body with medium carbonation, the liveliness of which gives this a great mouthfeel. Slightly sticky.  O: Fantastic. I consider this the reference BA stout. Big, slightly boozy, and rich BA stout with fantastic flavors.

T: Decadent chocolate, charred oak, bourbon, vanilla, roasted dark malts, plums, and hot alcohol. Complex, rich, and hot.  M: Thick and viscious, but still quite smooth.

Not bad, but a bit overbearing.  Taste has is more together than the nose, thankfully. Still pretty boozy, but the sweetness and wood come out in full force to round out the taste nicely.  Mouth is thick and viscous. Drinks like a big stout.  Overall, a big boozy stout that doesn't apologize for anything.

Oak and a heavy bourbon coat the back of the mouth on the finish.  Incredibly thick and viscous, but not overly cloying. Sublime mouthfeel with low carbonation levels.  I normally prefer this one with a bit of age on it, but it's still magnificent fresh. I've had very few beers that were this thick without being overly sweet.

Feel is thick and viscous with a low level of carbonation which lends a creamy quality to the beer. Overall this is a fantastic beer.

Then some roast, booze, bourbon, and a bit of vanilla. The finish is really boozy with some bitterness and has a warming feeling. Full bodied with low carbonation. I did not find this very enjoyable. It is cloyingly sweet and extremely boozy, even two years after bottling. I found the sweetness to overwhelm the other flavors present.

1549,10672,lurpy1,4.42,"2008 vintage. Huge thanks in order to all involved in sourcing this beer: My wife for trekking to Heritage Liquors on Beer Geek Day despite not knowing what in the world she was looking for, and the guys at Heritage for taking a special trip to the cellar to find one. This has been a Holy Grail beer for me, very excited.  Pours an ebony dark, with very little head, and even less carbonation.It's deep. It's dark. It's contemplative.  The smell is intensely bourbon, with plenty of malt, fruit, and a hint of vanilla. The bourbon is a great, warming smell. Awesome.  When i put it to my lips, call me nuts, but I think I picked up on some bourbon! Actually, it's not just SOME bourbon, it's an absolute donkey punch of bourbon. I am on fire. The bourbon wipes out pretty much any competing flavors save for a figgy dark fruit flavor. I like bourbon. I like bourbon in my beer. But I am not used to being so thoroughly bitch slapped by it.  Mouthfeel is glorious, smooth, thick, deep, with no carbonation slowing me down.  At the end of the day, this is surely a damn good beer, but it's too one note with the Bourbon for me to give it a great mark. A-. But I do think that with some vanilla or coffee to cut the bourbon, this would be truly spectacular. I guess I need to obsess on the vanilla or coffee versions of BCBS.  EDIT 12/26/12: OK, I've had enough of this beer now to reconsider my ratings.

1549,10672,FriarTuckInLuck,4.97,"2008 vintage bottled on 10/26/08 poured moderately into a snifter.  Appearance: Pitch black. Light only creeps through at the very edges. Faint wisps of foam quickly disappear leaving a faint tan lacing around the glass.  Smell: Sweet alcohol, burnt/caramelized molasses, semi-sweet chocolate liqueur, maybe some faint oaky earthyness, very decadent  Taste: Opening is rich dark chocolate, bourbon, molasses, and sweet vanilla notes. Middle starts to bitter the chocolate, lets you feel the smoothness of the oak, and brings up some mild heat that with the light carbonation gives a prickly sensation on the tongue. Finish is more sweet chocolate and bourbon. Definitely love the way the oak, and most probably the age, gives such a great cohesion to the beer. Even with such bold, sweet flavors, the balance is definitely there. A barrel aged stout with the volume up to 11.  Mouthfeel: Oily, slick, plus the aforementioned prickly heat from the light carbonation mixed with the flavorful booze.  Overall: I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to find this beer. I had never had BCBS before, and can't seem to find it fresh, so I can't compare the difference which sucks. This is the best beer I have ever had bar none.

S- Bourbon and oak barrel.  T- Bourbon and oak barrel. Hints of vanilla, dark fruit, and molasses appear, but are an afterthought compared to the bourbon barrel. Drinks like a 16% ABV beer, even though it is only 13%. One thing I have noticed about Goose Island's Imperial Stouts is that there seems to be a lack of chocolate and coffee.  M- Burn from the bourbon. Full bodied.  O- I got this one bottle when it came out (I have never had this fresh, and am glad I haven't). I thought a little over 2 years in the bottle would make this one fine beer. I was wrong. This beer is still way too hot, and certainly is not in the company of the best barrel aged stouts in the world. I am not a huge fan of this, nor was I a huge fan of the BCBCS.

Bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses in the smell. Somewhat boozy.  The taste is much better than the smell and it's apparent what makes this such a sought after brew. Bourbon is obviously present and immediately hits the chest with the appropriate warming. Dark chocolate bitterness also has a decent presence. Some dark berry notes hover in the background, along with hints of vanilla and molasses. It's a bit hot, but at this ABV I'd be shocked if it wasn't. But it's not what I would call ""boozy"" in the pejorative sense as the beer is still the star.  Mouthfeel is thick, chew, viscous. This is an excellent example of barrel-aging done right.

Beer pours pitch black and dark, with no head except a few thin patches of dark brown film. Lots of alcohol legs on this one though, thick and coats the inside of the glass with long lasting beer film and I can swirl up a half a finger of bubbles that quickly dissipates. Looks like minimal carbonation if any.  Nose has a nice bourbon component, vanilla, nutty like toasted almonds, oak, toffee, dark fruit like cherry. A bit of the alcohol comes through in the aroma as well. Stout base is there, rich fudgy chocolate, roasted malts. Bourbon barrel is a bit stronger than the 2008 bottle I tried, where it was much more well integrated.  Taking a sip, the flavors are more balanced between stout and barrel, with more of the chocolate and dark fruits being on similar level with vanilla, almond, oak, and toffee. Not much roastiness in the flavor. Smooth, with a bit of the alcohol at the back of the tongue and throat.  Full body and silky on the tongue, minimum carbonation, though enough to lightly taunt your tongue. Sticky lingering flavors of chocolate and bourbon on a long finish.

T- Opens with salty and woody barrel notes followed up with big waves of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and liquid fudge. Finishes with more chocolate, espresso, caramel, and booze.  M- Thick, rich, and chewy. I almost feel like I could cut this brew with a steak knife. Light carbonation, but very adequate considering the big flavors. Warming finish isn't too intense, but it lets you know this is 14.5%.  O- One of the best barrel-aged stouts I've had. I haven't been able to try this one until this year, but now I'll be seeking it out every chance I get.

1549,10672,HopJack,5,"Vintage 2011, 12 ounce bottle, bottled on 11/11/11. Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Glass.  Appearance: Dark, very dark. Very little head that disappears almost immediately. No lacing at all.  Smell: Bourbon, and more bourbon. Good bit of vanilla and some maple. I wish they made scratch and sniff stickers out of this stuff.  Taste: Just like the smell, lots of bourbon. Sweet vanilla and chocolate. Very boozy, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: A little oily. Leaves a nice sticky coating on my tongue. Just a tad bit of carbonation. Burned a little on the way down. What a great feeling.  Overall: I'm pretty sure it willl be a while before I taste another imp stout this good. Two more bottles left in the cellar, someone zap my brain so that I can forget they are there. I wish I hadn't drank the bottle so darn fast. I'm sitting here just sniffing my glass contemplating whether I should crack another one. I'd be willing to sell my soul for a case of this stuff.

1549,10672,MrArmageddon,4.75,"Bottled on 11/11/11  Poured into a pint glass because the only snifter I could find in the house is about 4 ounces. As soon as I popped the top the bourbon scent hit me. It filled the room. This year's batch is 14.5% so it makes sense.  This beer pours blacker than any other beer I've had. Put a high powered LED flashlight on one side of the glass and you wouldn't have known it by looking at the other side. Not really any head after it settles.  Obviously, bourbon is the strongest smell. After that you pick up some vanilla, some oak, a little bit of coffee/mocha in there, but not enough that it bothered me. Not a fan of coffee at all.  At first all I can taste is bourbon. It's the after taste of the first sip and the next few that start to reveal the other nuances. Little vanilla, little oaky.  Goes down smooth. Soooo smooth.

1549,10672,Ralphs66,4.7,"Wow....this is one stellar friggin beer. 2011 vintage. Poured out black as night with a head that was tinged an interesting reddish color. It fizzled out very quickly and left no lacing at all. This is liquid cherry cordial on the nose, with just a tad of vanilla. The booze is definitely hanging out behind everything else, but so so so muted. A bit woody as well. Taste follows nose, with a quick blast of the cherry cordial. Again, the abv is there but is hidden beautifully. Surprising amount of snap on the carbonation, but it doesn't impact the mouthfeel at all. Syrupy but not in a bad way. This is a sipper, and it will slam you, but it is truly fine. Glad I have another bottle poised and ready for Christmas Eve.

1549,10672,lawlerj,4.82,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. Bottled on date is 11/11/11.  A - Pours motor oil black. Absolutely opaque. Even with an agressive pour yields a fairly slim, dark brown head that dissipates rapidly, leaving a smooth surface. No lacing to speak of.  S - Bourbon, clearly, is the dominant aroma. There are some sweet chocolate notes and a touch of vanilla, blending with just a bit of coffee. . Some dark fruits, raisins, etc. are hidden away in there. At first, all I was getting was the bourbon, but the more I sniff, the more I'm picking up the more subtle nuances that are hidden away in here. Very nice.  T - The flavors follow the nose for the most part. Big, bombastic bourbon flavor bounces around my mouth. Vanilla and chocolate notes blending with boozy cherry and raisan flavors in a very nice way. I don't know quite how to put it, but there is a definite ""oakiness"" to the flavor. And, of course, this brew is boozy like few others I've had - as it slides towards the back of the throat, the warming alcohol comes roaring through, finish in a nice dry way.  M - Full bodied and viscous. The alcohol lends a bit of a prickly feeling at points, but this is not *too* prominent. Given the high ABV, not too surprising I suppose. Smooth and silky on the front end and for the most part.  O - Overall, super stoked that I got my hands on a four pack of this stuff. Incredible flavor, big and boozy, and I loved every second of it. Can't wait to see how the other three bottles mature over the next few years.

S: Lots of bourbon, some vanilla, a little bit chocolate, and a very faint maple aroma actually. The chocolate and vanilla mix slightly to give off a little bit of a mocha aroma.  T: Extremely smooth, again with a good bit of bourbon, vanilla, a little bit of chocolate, and caramel.  M: Full bodied with low carbonation. Nice and thick/chewy.

1549,10672,StJamesGate,4.09,"Gooey jet black with slight garnet highlights and a loose bronze head that is very much tamed by the ABV. Big bourbon barrel nose - corn sweetness and smoke - and a boozy hit plus molasses and fig; intoxicating. Treacle, tar, date paste, rum barrel, smoke opening into gentler caramel chew notes, then a tree bark and citronella hops. Roasty char and Sambuca finish and a clean hot linger that goes on like menthol. Full, chewy, sticky, round.  2009 version, 13% ABV.  Tough to tell off the nose what's bourbon and what's stout - not sure if that's a bad thing. That carries over to the taste, where there's not much chocolate or coffee, so a certain ""stoutness"" missing in favor of bourbon. Can't believe how hot this still is after over 2 years. Not sure how much aroma is in there, but I wouldn't guess Willamette; hops don't really play a part in this one.  This is a giant, and takes a while to get your mind and palate around. Better to actually treat it like a bourbon. I don't think I like it as much as everyone else - too hot and too woody - but it is fairly epic.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,matttttYCE,4.54,"Review #100. 2 reviews, roughly 6 months apart. Winning.  Poured this into one of my fancy, new 13.25oz Brandy snifters. There's just something wonderfully elegant about the combination of this glass and a bottle of BCBS! Head rises about half a finger high and is cocoa brown in color. Fades almost insatantaneously, leaving a slight ring around the edges of the glass. Slight lacing. Color of the beer is deep space black.  This is the 2009 version and the first time I've had this beer. It smells like it has melded wonderfully over the almost 2 years. I get a mix of smooth Bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, rich roasted malts, notes of dark fruit, brown sugar, and hints of maple syrup and mint spicyness believe it or not. Nothing is overpowering (especially not the Bourbon). It all seems so smooth and balanced like a finely crafted beer. I don't notice any notes of alcohol or hotness at all.  Now, on the taste, there's definitely still some noticeable alcohol heat for a 2009 vintage. Aside from the heat, I get that wonderful smooth Bourbon, oak, vanilla extract, and toffee mixture up front with notes of dark chocolate, chocolate syrup, coffee, chocolate covered black cherries, more dark fruit like raisins or figs, thick caramel, coffee, maple syrup, roasted and slightly burnt malts, slight bitterness and spicyness partially from the ABV but I think also part of the Bourbon. Very close to a 5.0 for me, but just not quite there.  Consistency is viscous, carbonation is light and appropriate for the beer, body is moderately full, nearly chewy, and the finish is actually rather average. Nothing lingers too long but you are left with subtle, pleasant reminders of the wonderful brew you're drinking.  This is a damn fine beer overall. Certainly worthy of a 5.0 overall score. Is this my favorite Bourbon barrel aged beer? That's a tough one, but I think I would have to say no, giving the slight edge to Port Older Viscosity. That said, I have only tried this beer aged (this 2009 version) and so I will definitely be looking to try a fresh bottle when the next batch comes out and make up my mind again at that time. With all that said, this really is an incredible beer that everyone should try at least once.  --  12oz bottle dated 11/12/09  Poured into a snifter glass. The head is a little more than a finger high, between creamy and foamy, and light chocolate color. Fades after not too long, thanks to high alcohol and bourbon barreling I'd guess. Leaves a pretty substantial ring around the glass, though. The beer is deep space black. Funny I used the same term last time I reviewed it many months ago and I hadn't even looked back at the other review yet.  The aroma is simply tantalizing and complex with wonderful, big bourbon notes. But with a name like Bourbon County, who'd have guessed the aroma would be bourbon heavy, right? The bourbon, vanilla, spicy and charred oak notes, and coconut (probably more than I've ever smelled in another beer, let alone a bourbon barrel aged one) mix wonderfully over a bed of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee. All the while in the background there are notes of cherry, raisin, and some other dark, pitted fruits, some burnt caramel and toffee, and hints of burnt or caramelizing brown sugar. The aroma is so intensely complex yet wonderfully balanced all around.  The taste is fantastic. Bourbon that's extremely well balanced and integrated, chocolate, sweetness, vanilla, oaky tannins, burnt brown sugar and caramel, notes of cherries and raisins, toasted coconut, roasted coffee and malts, toffee, and slight hotness or noticeable alcohol burn. For a 2009 I'm surprised a bit by the noticeable hotness, but then again, it is like 13%. Wonderful tasting beer.  The mouthfeel is down right deceptively drinkable. If it weren't for the noticeable alcohol heat in the taste/finish, I'd be able to drink a bunch of these. Smooth nearly velvety consistency, medium carbonation bordering the lighter side, medium-full body, and a wonderfully long and complex finish.  Overall, this high up there with some of the best bourbon barrel aged beers I've had the pleasure of trying so far in my young beer career, if you will. Don't quite know if it's the best I've had, I'd have to do some serious side by side by side by side by side tasting to determine that. Let's just say this is one superb, world-class beer that everyone really should try. From what I remember of the last time I had this 2009 vintage, this beer is aging wonderful and just seems to grow more and more complex as it ages. Can't wait to have some 10 or 11. I didn't look back at the first review before this one and the only discrepancy between the two came in the overall rating where I gave it a 5.0 in the first review and a 4.5 here. I think here it's really more deserving of a 5.0 overall score, so that's what I'm going with.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CMB2012,4.57,"2011 bottle. Poured into stemless snifter and shared with the girl. Served at about to above cellar temp.  A- Pours super thick an dark with just a very tiny amount of light coming through the edges. The alcohol on this is evident in the appearance, you can see it on the glass as you move it up and down. No head on my small pour!  S- Holy boozed raisins batman! Plums, apricots, raisins, sweet cherries, dark bitter chocolate, cream/vanilla, spicy oak, and lots of alcohol. The malts are sweet and I detect some soy sauce, but it actually works in this case. I could smell this beer as soon as the psst upon opening it. Very attractive aroma, complex, deep, but approachable.  T- Salted dark chocolate, molasses, cherries, prunes, spicy bourbon notes with some dry oak. The alcohol is noticeable throughout, but it really comes through in the end. Very warm boozy finish. Comes across a lot like a port/bourbon mix with chocolate.  M- Not quite as thick as you might expect. Very viscous, on the lighter side of full body, tightly packed carbonation that is spot on.  O- I have had BCBS at various times, and always in very small quantities. This was the first time I ever sought it out. I definitely enjoy it, but for me not the best of bourbon stouts available.

Toasted coconut, fresh cut wood, dry roasted coffee, espresso beans, vanilla, and toasted oats. Mild anise and toasted almond notes come through also. Back of the nose you get a sweet port wine and sherry aroma.  Lots of chocolate coming though in the taste. Chocolate is not that prononced in the aroma, but comes out very much in the taste. Good amount of coconut, vanilla, dark cherry, and bourbon. The bourbon flavor and heat come out more as the beer warms. One smooth beer! Flavors and the feel of this beer glide across the palate. Bitterness is there but it is just another great balanced part of the beer.  Everything is spot on here. Incredible aromas, tastes, and structure. The perfect night cap beer.

1549,10672,jegross2,4.57,"Reviewing a fresh 2011 vintage bottle of the infamous Bourbon County Brand Stout from Goose Island Brewing Company.  Score: 96  2011 vintage bottle poured in a 22 oz snifter glass served at room temperature.  Appearance: Pours a jet black color with a quarter finger of bubbly mocha head that quickly subsides into an extremely thin ring around the edge of the glass. This baby is completely opaque; absolutely no light gets through it. I even put a bright LED flashlight behind the glass and no light is peeking through. Leaves small, brief streaks of oily lacing along the side of the glass. Swirling brings back some of the sexy mocha-chocolate colored head. 4/5  Smell: Huge aromas of maple syrup, caramel and vanilla extract. Tons of raisins, figs and brown sugar. Lots of dark fruit and notes of cherry. Some booziness. Rich, roasted dark chocolate and sweet bourbon. Some faint roasted coffee. The aroma is very complex and robust. 4.5/5  Taste: The flavor is just as complex and robust as the aroma. Despite all the bold individual flavors, however, the brew is still very balanced overall. Heavy notes of bourbon and maple hit first. Then rich chocolate, figs and plums. A little cherry and caramel-malt sweetness on the mid-palate. The beer finishes with sweet molasses and vanilla, and the flavors really linger. As the beer layers, increasing amounts of caramel, raisins, and sweet, luscious dark chocolate gradually build on the mid-palate. There is also some counter-balancing roasted coffee bean bitterness too. There is definitely some warming alcohol presence in the beer, but it is not a fiery type of alcohol character. Just the beer gently hugging your insides on the way down. As the beer layers, more roasted coffee bitterness, brown sugar, cherries and raisins come out in the finish. And boy does the finish linger. This is liquid decadence. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, oily, viscous and chewy with minimal carbonation. The finish is sweet and sticky with a friendly warming sensation on the way down. 5/5  Overall: This is beer lives up to it's hype, although it's one the sweeter side of stouts. If you can find a bottle at retail prices, it's an absolute bargain. Although this beer used to be hot fresh, the 2011 vintage is drinking smooth out of the gate. This is one of the best beers to age.  Recommendation: This is an absolute must try beer. I remember disliking it when I first got in to craft beer about four years ago, so perhaps this is not one for the casual drinker, but I am presently finding this brew to be smooth enough, even fresh, that I think I can probably recommend it all around -- especially to fans of high-shelf brown liquors. Beer geeks absolutely need to seek this one out. The aromas and flavors of the Bourbon Country Brand Stout are extremely complex and robust, and the flavors really linger. This is an extreme example of how tons of different flavors in a single beer can be balanced and stick out at the same time. Cheers!  Pairings: This one is a full dessert in its own right, but if you must pair it with something, try a warm chocolate cake or a Beef Wellington.  Cost: $5.99 for a single 12 oz bottle or $21.99 for a four pack (if you are luck enough to find a store that will sell you four at the four pack price). Alternatively, if you are like me, you might have even paid $45+ for three of them because Chicago was otherwise sold out and you really, REALLY wanted to get your hands on some. Certainly worth buying at least one -- even if you have to pay the profiteering rate.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dlello2,4.67,"Did a 2010 and 2011 side-by-side. Both poured from 12oz bottles into identical snifters. (From Notes)  2010 A - Black and thick and syrupy. Very little/no head. Shows up and leaves. Definitely alcohol lacing.  S - Smell gave me the chills. Bourbon and sweetness, dark caramel, woodiness, brown sugar. All quite intense in the nose.  T - Sweetness first which is balanced by a nice thick mouthfeel and a bite of alcohol. Then bourbon comes in the middle with roasted faint coffee notes. Wow this is so smooth. The end is so complex and the aftertaste is incredible. Sweet and warming bourbon leads to tons of chocolate. Chocolate stays forever as the beer really coats the mouth well. Hmm... how can the bourbon be so balanced!  O - An amazing beer. Definitely one of my favorites ever. Truly complex, so smooth. Wonderful aftertaste. Can't imagine what even more time in the cellar would do.  2011 A - Thick thick darkness. Even less head than the 2010... weird. Looks great--syrupy, chewy. Black.  S - Smells similar to the 2010 but hotter. Also getting more chocolate on the nose. Again it's warming me just from the smell.  T - Flavors and bite a lot more front-heavy than the 2010. Definitely not as smooth (but I really don't mind it... in fact I like it quite a lot!). Certainly getting booziness from this one. Doesn't coat the mouth as completely as the 2010... and the aftertaste is not sticking with me quite as long. It starts bitter, then goes to chocolate.  O - Definitely enjoyable (I wish I could drink this all day... damn you tolerance).  **After warming up for about 30 mins: 2010 still has a ring of head clinging to glass, the '11 has none. Bourbon grabs the middle of the tongue on both like crazy. Flavors even more complex. Great.  Edit: 2011 version with a few months of age on it. Absolutely beautiful. I went back and changed the mouthfeel to a 5. This beer is truly fantastic. The taste is verging on a 5... I'd give it a 4.75 if I could. The faint hops and coconut really do it for me.

Roasted chocolate, loads of sweet, dark fruit (cherry, plum), a hint of coffee, sweet vanilla from the barrel aging, decadent caramel. Wow.  T: This is dessert. Thick, viscous, and cloying. Like the thickest chocolate milk you ever had laced with bourbon. Super sweet chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Very assertive bourbon flavor, but not offensive. Shockingly smooth. The bourbon is all over it, but it doesn't overwhelm. Lots of ripe dark fruit flavors. Spectacular.  M: Fantastic. The bourbon flavor is incredibly balanced, perhaps the best I've ever experienced. The flavors are all so well integrated, like movement in a symphony...chocolate, to vanilla, to caramel, to ripe dark fruit, to bourbon, back to chocolate. Every sip of this one is an experience. Epic.  O: Goose Island BCBS is worth every ounce of the hype. At 14.5%, this one is a bruiser, but it is surprisingly smooth right now. That being said, I think age can only help this beer.

1549,10672,Pintofbrown,4.62,"I had this one in a glass stein. 2011 vintage.  Appearance- On a hard pour this stout yielded only a finger of milk chocolate colored head that dies quickly to a ring. The body is incredibly heavy and viscous as it comes out of the bottle. The body is an unfathomable black.  Smell- Bourbon is the crux of the aromas. However, after a couple of sniffs, there are some sweeter notes of molasses, dark cherries, and even oaky-vanilla. It is so very, very appetizing!  Taste- Amazingly, bourbon is not the first thing on the palate. That honor belongs to the fruity element, apples and cherries.  Right behind that, the considerable bourbon heat shows up in a big way and lasts through the rest of the drink. Molasses also do their part to sweeten things up, and make this drink delectably sticky.  Under the bourbon finish, vanilla and oak comes through. While the fruity characteristics once again remind you that they started this party off. I am pleasantly surprised this offering is not a straight bourbon bomb, and offers so much with each drink.  Mouth feel- It really does not get any bigger than this. It is incredibly slick, no need for carbonation nonsense here, and it coats to an incredible degree. My lips are literally sticky from this beer.  Oh, and the finish from the last sip is still on the palate well into the next drink.  Overall- This is a truly fantastic stout. The smell is big and complex; the taste is even deeper and amazing; and the mouth feel is perfect.  The big take away from this beer is that bourbon is there, but it does not rely on the bourbon character to make this beer the monster that it is.

A: Jet Black and no head (not sure if this is from a lack of head or the head being allowed to dissipate so that more beer could be poured in for a full pour). S: Amazing, Oak and Bourbon are very present with a slight hint of caramel. T: Lots of bourbon and a traditional stout taste. M: Wow, here is where this beer really shines. The Bourbon flavors are there along with caramel, vanilla and it fills the palate. Simply Amazing. O: One of the best beers I’ve ever had. 2009 version didn’t impress me but that could be because I hadn’t had as much experience with beer when I drank it in 2010. This one’s a year old and nothing short of amazing. A+",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Aberration,4.27,"On tap during rare beer week at amherst brewing company  Very dark pour with a deep red meniscus on the glass, looks inviting but lacks any sort of lacing or head.  Smells like a subdued bourbon with roasted malts, slight oak, slight vanillin  Tastes like chocolate malts and bourbon, delicious but not all that complex. Not saying I wouldn't like to drink a ton of this but its still one tone.  Good mouthfeel very full bodied and silky but seems to lack carbonation. Alcohol is present on the tongue as the bourbon and roasted chocolate dances across my palate.  Delicious beer, I'd order it again anytime. Not necessarily the greatest bourbon barrel stout I've ever had but memorable and delicious",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,barczar,4.7,"Pours a deep black with garnet highlights and a half finger mocha head that dissipates quickly into a ring around the edge of the tulip.  Aroma has underlying dark fruits with roast malts, coffee, and chocolate in mid scent. Bourbon, vanilla, and alcohol finish the profile. A hint of oak is evident as it warms.  Flavor is absolutely incredible. Forgot how great this beer is. Dark fruits are present throughout the taste...plums, figs, bruised dark cherries, dates carry the alcohol and mask it fairly well, though it's still fairly evident. Vanilla, chocolate, and a roast malt/coffee flavor make up the substance of the flavor, with oak making a brief appearance to pull everything together.  Body is full and creamy with minimal carbonation. The fullness causes the delicious flavor to linger just long enough to ensure the full experience is enjoyed. A slight alcohol warmth is comforting, albeit a touch offensive.  If you happen to find this beer available, it's a must-try. Sock away a few for a vertical of you can refrain from drinking them long enough. Even fresh, the flavor profile is intense enough to support the massive alcohol content, which should only mellow with age. A very complex and delicious brew in both aroma and flavor that rivals the best imperial stouts in the world. With a couple years of age to tame the alcohol, its score would only improve.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,rwathree,4.55,"A: rich, opaque pitch black, with a smallish brown head that leaves a long-lasting lace.  S: well, it smells like bourbon. Really good bourbon. There's a hint of chocolate, maybe chicory, but I wish more of the stout came through.  T: huge bourbon flavor and intense alcohol heat that gives way to toffee, chocolate, chicory, and then returns at the end. The hopping is done just right to give this the necessary balancing bitterness.  M: appropriately moderate conditioning and full-bodied texture. Surprisingly, the alcohol heat fades enough that it doesn't overwhelm.  This lives up to its reputation easily. The four-pack price is steep, but I could easily share each bottle and drink it as a nightcap.

A: Black silk (like a girl I once knew).  S: This smells so god-damn good. The bourbon over-powers the entire room. I could shove a sardine up one nostril, and a jalapeno in the other and the bourbon would still shine through.  T: Surprisingly smooth. This is usually very hot for about a year - not this batch. Unreal. Immediately you taste the bourbon, then some burnt malts, and a nice sweet vanilla finish. Ahhhh.  M: Just as smooth as it looked. Full bodied, thicker than I remember. Nicely carbonated, with tiny bubbles.  O: What a great beer. It's sad to think that in past years I could buy as much of this as I wanted, and this year I doubt I'll be able to buy more than the one four-pack I came into totally by luck.

Little retention or lace.  S: Bourbon, with chocolate in the background.  T: Surprisingly mellow for a beer this strong and so young. Chocolate, bourbon, coffee, cola, dark fruits, light molasses, allspice. Some sweetness but not too much. Complex and contemplative.  M: Full bodied, with a great, oily quality and a little cream. Not too heavy and goes down smoothly.  O: An intense beer for sure. I remember being impressed with this last year, but unfortunately did not buy any for aging. Was lucky to get 10 bottles today and most of those are going to cellar for a year or more.

Poured an undiscernable, non-translucent dark brown with a mocha color fizzy/bubbly head that quickly fleeted to nothing. It has the appearance and consistency of a Coca-Cola. First aromas are of bourbon, liquor, roast, caramel, wood, earth, slight vanilla. The tastes mirror that with a slight syrupy booziness to it. It has strong upfront heaviness to it but the tastes disperse quick leaving not much of an aftertaste. It appears that this year's batch has a ABV of 14.5% I can taste every bit of it!

1549,10672,angrywolf,5,"2011 Release, from a 12-oz bottle.  A: This pours a jet-black color with a thin brown head that quickly dissipates to pretty much nothing, which I'm not surprised, considering the high ABV.  S: As soon as I opened the bottle, I could smell the bourbon from about a foot away. A close inspection brings out bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and slight coffee notes.  T: Exactly the same as the smell-bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, plus the added sweetness of brown sugar. Like Dark Lord, it's sweet, but unlike Dark Lord, it's just sweet enough to balance out the booziness that also makes itself present.  M: Surprisingly thin for a beer that's advertised with a 14-plus % ABV content - and that's not a bad thing. Unlike other imperial stouts that are so thick you feel like you're drinking tar, this one goes down dangerously smooth.  O: This was my very first bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout a couple years ago and it blew me away back then. I've had many other bourbon-barrel aged-beers but this one's still my favorite. I remember I could just go to the store and buy this beer whenever I was in the mood for it for months after the 2009 release came out.

Had younger ones, but time is on the side of this drink, so I'll keep off the younger versions and stick to the aged ones. 3 years old and the bourbon mellowed down perfectly into a balanced stout, very good example of its style. Only hints of how boozy this one once was. So preferably drink aged versions is my best advice for this one",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,inlimbo77,4.32,"Drank as part of a mini vertical tasting with friends, 07 - 09 versions side by side. Here are the bottle dates: 10/12/07, 10/08/08, and 10/02/09. I'll ""review"" the 2009, but they all had some very similar stats BUT also differences. Poured into a generic bourbon snifter, split each bottle 3 ways.  Pours a deep black color. It actually wasn't as thick as I was expecting. There was basically no head except for some thin tan edges on the sides of the glass. Even with an extreme swirl I only generated about 1/4 worth that dissipated quickly. Very syrupy on the glass. Sheets of dark brown on the swirl.  On the nose, I got bourbon obviously. But also notes of oak, vanilla, and some chocolate. There is certainly some alcohol in there. Caramel as well is deeply hidden.  Taste wise, this is much better than I was expecting. I guess I was a little scared of how bourbon forward it was supposed to be, but the blending was so much better than just a bourbon blasted brew. I get the bourbon, but then you get some dark bitter chocolate and then the toffee and then the caramel aftertaste. That is what I thought was the most inviting. There is some alcohol warming as it goes down, but it's not overpowering to the point of being off putting. It's an extremely complex and delightful beer.  This is a full bodied beer, but again it doesn't appear as thick on the pour as others (Marshal Z). There is surely mouth coating and some booze.  Overall, I was really happy with all vintages for different reasons. This 2009 was probably my favorite. I like that I got a lot of toffee and caramel notes. Very pleasant.

The flavors are so well connected that nothing overpowers anything else. This is a bourbon lovers beer.  Silky smooth mouthfeel. Just about perfect, all other stouts will be compared to this, just enough carbonation to round out the creamy body.  This is a fantastic beer. I think it is best with 4-5 years of age on it.

Chock full of vanilla, chocolate and bourbon aromas. Not complex, but man is it alluring.  Sweet, viscous chocolate covers the entire mouth. It tastes like the best artisan chocolate you've ever had. The low carbonation contributes to the thick mouthfeel. Vanilla and coffee lead into a bourbon burn, with charred oak and some smoke.  This has aged fantastically. I didn't take notes when I had this vintage 2 years ago, but I'm sure that it tastes way better now. The apparent loss of carbonation actually helped turn this into a decadent, boozy masterpiece.

1549,10672,tjkinate,4.59,"Finally, my 100th review! And man, was it a good one.  Vintage 2009  A: From a hard pour into a Duvel tulip glass produced a small half fingered head atop this black bodied brew. The rusty brown head exhibited little retention and only some lacing. Don't be alarmed, it gets better!  S: Loads of malts, molasses, dark fruit, and semi-sweet dark chocolate. Made my mouth water.  T: Wow, so many flavors, my taste buds didn't know what to think. Eventually, I was able to taste dark fruits fused with dark chocolate, hints of vanilla, and the booziness of bourbon. I loved the smokey wood undertones that lingers long after each sip and accompanies the slight bitterness perfectly. The Abyss is the only stout that I have enjoyed more.

1549,10672,Mscarpen,5,"This is without a doubt, my favorite beer on the planet. Pitch black dark, with a head reminiscent of dark roasted coffee. Not much head at all, but if you can generate some and take a sip... Holy cow!!! Deep, sweet bourbon aromas with lots of hearty booze notes. This is a slow sipper for sure... With deep, whiskey notes complemented by dark stout favors of coffee and deep malt. I could sip on and simply smell this beer for weeks on end.  In comparison to the Rare version of this beer, I actually prefer this ""more pedestrian"" version. Where Rare has smooth' complex bourbon notes, the standard version has much more bite in the alcohol. Where this might come across as less polished to some, I think the sharpness forces you to slow downs and enjoy the beer a bit more.  By the way - if you are in the SE Wisconson area and see this on the shelf, please don't buy it. It's hard enough to find a bottle as it is. Make sure to leave plenty for me :)  Cheers!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Pours a thick black color, akin to a motor oil, with no light penetrating the darkness. The head is a dark tan, but is not even a finger high, which isn't a surprise given the high alcohol. Retention is low and lacing is almost non-existent.  A strong cornucopia of aromas are pulled from my snifter - alcohol in the form of bourbon, oak woodiness, roasted malts, chocolate, molasses and brown sugars, and over-ripened fruits that come more to the forefront as this beer warms to room temperature.  Taste is equally as complex and rich as the nose, with a strong roasted coffee bitterness and heavy bourbon flavors. Very boozy as well at 13% ABV. A sweetness is present with flavors of licorice and vanilla.  Mouthfeel is creamy, thick and chewy, with low carbonation. The aftertastes are of whiskey and blackened malts.  This is a major player of a beer that demands a slow sipping to fully appreciate and not be overwhelmed by its strength! Definitely an exceptional beer, although was a bit too much for me.

1549,10672,black13,5,"I've had this beer probably 50 times now, so I probably should give it a review. Not gonna lie, this is hands down my favorite beer. I keep a couple cases on had at all times.  A: Pours jet black with just a wisp of mocha colored head. Light has no chance of breaking through this beauty. The head dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing, but that just means all the beer went to me and none was left in the glass. This is the case with every vintage I've had, 07' through 10'. Gotta love a consistent brew.  S: This is the quintessential barrel aged stout. Tons of bourbon, roasted barley, and sweet caramel. I probably spend as much time with my nose in the glass as I do actually drinking this beauty. As this beer sits, the bourbon notes are still present, but balance out more with the barley.  T: Pure heaven. If you like bourbon, you will love this beer. If you don't like bourbon, give this beer a try. The roasted malts, chocolate, and bourbon are at the forefront, but once you let this sit in your mouth for a minute, you get a subtle sweetness that just makes everything sublime. As it warms up, the flavors become even more pronounced, but maintain a perfect balance. Every time I drink a 12 ouncer, I wish I had opened a bomber.  M: The carbonation and thickness are spot on. This is how a stout should coat the mouth. It coats the mouth with a silky smoothness and leaves a pleasant bourbon sweetness, without being cloying or overpowering. This is the benchmark for all barrel aged imperial stouts!  O: This is a great beer out of the gates, and three years later. As it ages, the bourbon begins to blend in more with the malts, barley and chocolate, but make no mistake, it is still a dominant aroma and flavor.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into Brooklyn Brewery pint glass (Nice extra from the same trade)...  A - Pours black with next to no head. Head that does pour is a brown color and dissipates almost immediately. No lace to be had here...  S - Smooth bourbon, oak, chocolate, and a little vanilla. Bourbon definitely comes through more subdued than in more recent years. As always, very inticing...  T - Delicious. Chocolate up front followed by oak, and smooth Bourbon. Although it is still prominate, the Bourbon loses alot of the bite it has in more recent years. Comes across alot more balanced. Unfortunately, the vanilla also fades alot, but it works because this one is super smooth...  M - Thick and chewy with next to no carbonation. Love how viscous this one is. A definite sipper...  O - My favorite beer of the style. I can't get enough of this stuff, and it just gets better with a little age. Have had numerous 09's and 10's, and those are excellent in there own right, but this one is drinking extremely well, and is my favorite of the bunch right now. Very well balanced.

1549,10672,Alieniloquium,4.03,"12 oz. bottle poured into a goblet. Thanks to MarcatGSB for sending me a few of these!  Appearance - Pitch black with some transparency at the edges. No head, a slight wisp of lace, otherwise lifeless. Not a pretty looking beer, but it is 13%.  Smell - Bourbon like no other. A lot of booze, tooThe bourbon makes the rest of the beer smell fruity, almost like a quad would smell. It's intriguing, but it really does mask the aroma of the base beer.  Taste - Bourbon up front, with a strong chocolate malt midrange flavor. Really exceptional taste. Not really complex, I suppose, but the stout flavor is there and the bourbon complements it really well. It finishes chocolatey and boozy as hell.  Mouthfeel - Tastes every bit of 13% and possibly more. Tingly in the mouth, so much so that it's tough to tell the carbonation levels. Definitely a sipper, but clearly I'm not looking for a session of this beer. It's definitely hot and I'm wondering how my 07 is tasting about now.  Overall - This is one of those beers where the taste is so good that it outweighs the flaws of the rest of the beer. It's boozy and it looks the lower side of mediocre, but it tastes amazing.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,sergeantstogie,5,I had a pretty shitty day so I thought I would end it with one of the two great beers I had left in my cupboard.  Poured a beautiful opaque nearly black with a small tan head and lacing that lasted till almost the end of the beer.  The smell reminded me of BOURBON and raisin bran. Huge caramel and bourbon punched me in the nose.  The taste followed the nose but stepped up to the plate with several more layers of interesting flavors. Coffee was in the way way back but provided a good base for the bourbon which was strong but smooth and not off putting at all. The raisin and bran was definitely there and made for a very interesting stout.  This is a thick viscous bastard. Any thinner and you would be fighting off chugging this beer. It was perfect and allowed..no forced you to sip and savor this amazing beer.  Even more than KBS this beer made me miss the States. Knowing it will be a long time before I can try to get more beers even similar to this is the only down side to this beer. Well done Goose Island!,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,beagle75,4.29,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (with a twist-off cap! Really?) into a half-pint snifter. 2006 vintage, according to the label the abv is 11%  A: Opaque black color with a few specks of fine brown bubbles but no head. Scant lacing remains on the glass.  S: Very dark chocolate and equally dark fruit are joined in perfect balance, with an assertive--but not overpowering--note of bourbon spirit. While the chocolate quality is dizzying in its depth, it is enhanced by the subtle presence of husky malt that is as toasty as it is roasty.  T: Begins sweet, with dark and fermented stone fruit that is surprisingly lively on the palate, followed by some unctuous pudding-like chocolate that finds itself outdistanced by the smell. Acidity is restrained but still detectable, breaking even in the final tally. A solid dose of volatile alcohol is present into the middle, as is some understated charred oak, where brown sugar dominates and some rustic coffee follows. Dark and spirituous flavors, including bourbon, combine with moderate bitterness and puckering minerality in the finish, allowing roasted barley to linger on the palate.  M: Medium viscosity, silky smooth on the palate featuring a distinct lack of alcohol burn but some volatile dissipation, with very low carbonation.  D/O: It would be easy to gently compliment this beer and move on if it did not represent such a pivotal contribution to the craft beer world. This particular time capsule from 2006 was brewed at a time when spirit-infused and wood-aged beers were almost unheard of, yet it holds its own with the contemporaries of today. The smell is swoon-worthy, delivering some really remarkable dark chocolate even five years on. Other qualities are not as noteworthy, but the predictable flavors are still pleasant enough. It is kind to the palate, with an appropriate amount of spirit coming through in the taste without being hot or fatiguing. While it was a long time in coming, this one was worth the wait.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MS22,3.65,"I went in to this expecting the grandeur of KBS or CBS . . . please keep that in mind.  Poured super deep black with the faintest of tan/brown head and lacing into a large snifter. Nearly no light penetrates through.  Smell is coffee, malts, chocolate, bourbon, a bit of astringency and tar on the end.  Taste was heavy. Everything I would have expected coming in blind. Bourbon and sweetness dominate. Coffee and chocolate round out the middle. The end finishes with more bourbon and a tinge of vanilla. Extremely boozy for being only 2% higher in alcohol than KBS.  Mouthfeel is as viscous as anything I've had. Older Viscosity is the nearest thing I can think of. More coating than Parabola, DL, etc.  Overall this was something I built up in my head as a must try and in the end I think all the hype around it kind of set me up for a let down. Just too boozy.

Smooth, creamy bitter chocolate and a bitter finish heavy on roasted coffee beans. Finish is hot with a touch of harsh bourbon. Thanks Malcolm!  February 2012 Edit of the 2011 batch. Awesome rich brownie nose, gooey, super well integrated bourbon barrel. Near Rare in terms of decadence and quality on the nose. Mouth is rich, gooey chocolate brownie, silky feel.

Here in Texas we don't get this beer, so I look forward to try the other bottles in my cellar. I'm not sure what it tastes like fresh, but I imagine that a year of aging did this beer some good.

For those that love boilermakers this is Nirvana. Behind that the beer has flavors of chocolate and hearty malt. This is like a meal. Easily a gift for the big stout lovers.  M - Its heavy, it doesn't care, and despite beign exceptionally balanced is a beast. So know that this is a sipper and not a meal compliment.  O - Loved this on draft, liked it alot in bottles.

1549,10672,NCBeerFan,4.82,"Thanks for StoutFest for passing along this 2007 vintage as an extra in a distant trade….was waiting for a good time to crack it open, so with all of the Irene madness going on, the wife and I decided to split a bottle.  Pours a pitch black, with a thin tan head. Wow, the aroma is just awesome….not quite as intense as a fresh BCS, but the usual suspects are all there: bourbon, bitter chocolate, vanilla, and a little love (according to my wife :-). Again, the brew has mellowed out some over the past few years, but it has aged nicely….the taste closely follows the nose, but we're both noticing some dark fruity notes, maybe chocolate-covered cherries, and a slight bitterness from the chocolate. it goes does so smoothly, but there's still that noticeable alcohol burn and a touch of bitterness.  I don't think I've had another BA stout that had this much time on it, and this one has held up quite well. I kinda wished I had held onto it and tried it as part of a vertical, but since the wife and I both love the BCSes, they tend to not stay in our cellar for very long.

Playing: The National: High Violet  A: Pours an ominous-looking midnight black. It's visibly slow wave movement in the pour is almost intimidating. Virtually no head forms, but a clear 360-degree khaki crown surrounds spotty patches of cloud-patterned carbonation patches.  S: Lots of strong vanilla in the nose, more extract than bean on account of the alcohol heat. Sweet bakers chocolate, figs, raisins and hints of the bourbon barrel come through.  T: Starts with a bitingly sweet wave of dark chocolate, followed by boozy oak, moving alcohol heat right through my nose. Bourbon/whiskey flavors are pronounced but extremely smooth. Flavors of dried fruit soaked in booze remind me of my great grandmother's tasty-but-flammable Welsh Christmas ""pudding"". Deep, complex and warming.  M: Viscous, thick, creamy and smooth. It foams thick like meringue and dissipates into oily spots of caramelized sweetness.  O: This beer is classic. It's signature flavor is so memorable yet so new and expansively complex every time I drink it. It's a world-class pioneer of the style and doesn't falter in continuing to set the standard.

1549,10672,mmmbeer,4.66,"Big thanks to BA BanditBrewingCo for the sample. 12 oz. twist-off longneck, bottled 11/12/09. Brewed with two-row, Munich, chocolate, caramel, roasted, and debittered black malts; hopped to 60 IBUs with Willamette and aged in a bourbon barrel. No sound upon opening - hope it's carbonated. Pours black with just a hint of tan collar and no hope of lacing or head retention at this ABV. Very aromatic, with vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, stewed raisins/prunes and perhaps some minty rye from the bourbon. Excellent, but I wish it had a bit more stout character. It is in fact carbonated, and tastes very rich, a little sweet, with notes of burnt caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, bourbon, spicy oak, peppery ethanol, blackberries, black cherries and raisins. You can just barely find the stout beneath, but it yields roast, dark chocolate and a moderate bitterness. Very thick and viscous on the tongue, lightly-carbonated, quite drying, tannic?, chewy and almost syrupy with a long finish. Even after two hours and nearly flat, the mouthfeel is still fine. Very highly-concentrated and quite complex, with lots of bourbon (wet barrel?) and an effortless drinkability. Almost more bourbon than stout, but this is a wonderful beer that deserves its reputation and could probably age for a decade or more.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ShanePB,3.55,"Bottle acquired in the N00B BIF Round #5 from Derek, thanks a ton for sending this one my way to try! 2009 vintage split with my girlfriend and family, poured into multiple tulip glasses.  A: Deep dark brown, okay borderline black, body with a deep crimson ring around the top edge. Virtually no head and only a thin ring around the glass after everything settles out. No lacing is present, either. For being a higher ABV this is somewhat forgivable however I've seen stouts as big as this put on more of a show.  S: Huge, rich and thick bourbon notes make a profound appearance in the aroma, as you'd expect. Saturated liquor wood, super sweet milk chocolate, coffee and runny maple syrup also play a part in the nose. Honestly, this is just way too sweet of a nose, very rich and needs some serious mellowing in my opinion -- even at almost the two year mark.  T: Warming bourbon along with some thick viscous sweet milk chocolate flavors are first on the palate. Midway, is nothing but super sweet and syrupy flavors that seem chaotic and messy. The sweetness intensifies as this beer warms and becomes increasingly unbalanced and constructed. The finish brings a saving grace of a grounded toasted caramel malt backbone but it's simply not enough throughout the beer to compete with the sugars.  M: Low carbonation gives this a thick and chewy mouth feel, really ideal for a stout this big. It's slightly bubbly and tingly on the tongue and leaves you with a bit of a burn in the throat on the way down.  For me, this beer was almost the opposite of what I was expecting. I think before this beer hits the bourbon barrels it needs a bit more of a polished and refined base beer to withstand the test of time. Hopefully these bottles will mellow out their sweetness over time, and luckily I have one left to test this theory. For me as this sits now, it's overly sweet and just a bit messy.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Even holding it up to the light I don't get any brown or red hints, just black. Really dark mocha head that doesn't stick around for very long. The lacing and retention is pretty awesome. A swirl of the glass produces more mocha foam that almost has a red tint. Theres even legs too! Just looks perfect. 5.0/5  S - Bourbon initially. High quality bourbon. Then oak, vanilla, cocoa powder, and lots of roasty malty goodness. The finish is certainly alcoholic. 4.5/5  T - Crazy smooth. I taste bourbon, oak, rich vanilla, and some coffee and chocolate notes. Just a hint of bitter roasted malts. The finish is alcoholic and warming. It does come off a bit strong, but in a good way. Its not even that complex of a beer. Its just extremely well put together, Every flavor flows together perfectly. Nothing really stands out or steals the show. Really fantastic taste. 5.0/5  M - Velvety smooth and super thick. Its coats your tongue and doesn't go away until the last nuance of vanilla and bourbon fades away. Being so creamy and having fairly low carbonation, its a sipper. 4.5/5  O - This is one of my favorite stouts. The bourbon barrel notes really compliment the base beer. Its just so smooth and rich with tons of amazing flavors. If the AB-Inbev buy out means a higher supply of this stuff, then I'm game. 4.5/5  2011 Vintage, bottled on, 11/11/2011, #1711. Reviewed on 05-15-2012, making it roughly 6 months old. 14.5% abv. Poured into a brandy snifter.  A - Pitch black body. Dark mocha one finger high head. Settles down to a thin cap and thick edging. Some light lacing but a swirl leaves behind a ridiculous amount of alcoholic legs and regenerates the head. A thin layer of alcohol just stays on the side of the glass for eternity. Perfect. 5.0/5  S - Heavy bourbon notes. Dark caramelized fruits, molasses, oak, maple, caramel, butterscotch and loads of sweet vanilla. This leads into some bitter cocoa powder and coffee beans. There is a nice alcoholic burn on the finish. 5.0/5  T - Starts off with hot bourbon notes. Roasty and lightly bitter cocoa powder with vanilla and caramel sweetness. Some faint notes of dark fruits, coconut, and maple. The finish is long and bitter. Alcohol is prevalent but well integrated. 4.5/5  M - Quite boozy, so much so that the thick syrupy mouth feel seems to become watery towards the finish. Really coats your mouth though. 4.5/5  O - For a six month old beer this is drinking really damn well. I think I prefer it with a year or two on it though. The flavors seem to meld together a bit more which helps with the intense boozy bourbon notes. The '09 having only 13% abv also helps its cause a bit. 4.5/5",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,seeswo,4.47,"2008 bottle enjoyed next to BCBS Rare, but I've had many bottles, many different vintages.  Pours black with a small tan head. The nose is strongly barrel influenced - vanilla and wood and bourbon, mix with a touch of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is very similar with a pretty aggressive bourbon burn (even for this vintage) that gives the beer a rougher quality. The chocolate and roasted quality move their way a bit to the background. Carbonation is a nicely a bit subdued. Not creamy, but big. Nowhere near is smooth or decadent as the Rare, but still a pretty impressive beer available somewhat easily in $20/4 packs. That said, it is altogether a bit harsh.

I was more intrigued by the 2008 batch however as it had already been aged an additional year and would supposedly have mellowed in bitterness a bit more. The beer itself had been aged slightly in bourbon barrels and would supposedly pick up a lot of character from the wood and lingering traces of bourbon.  I poured the Bourbon County Stout (BCS) into a large snifter type glass to help bring out all of the aromas and wow did it ever!

The aroma is slightly sweet, but the intensity of the oaky, bourbon aromas are in the forefront.  The taste is sweet and chocolatey with a hot, bourbony finish.

1549,10672,jondeelee,5,"Goose Island's 2009 Bourbon County Stout promises that one sip will have ""more flavor than your average case of beer."" Judging by the smell alone, this promise doesn't seem exaggerated: the brew is ripe with bourbon, milk chocolate, dark (90%) chocolate, figs, port, molasses, tobacco, and anise.  On the tongue, the first flavor is an intense bourbon & charcoal burst, followed by an almost equally-intense injection of black licorice, smoky tobacco, port, chocolate & black malts, all atop a thick bed of almost-burnt sugars. The power of these flavors cannot be understated, and even the hyperbolic promise that every sip has more flavor than a case of beer seems understated. So heady is the brew that the liquid seems supersaturated, and it is difficult to imagine that any more flavor could have been squeezed into the bottle. As a result, the mouthfeel is highly syrupy--thicker even than condensed milk--and so little room is left for anything else that carbonation barely manages a medium-light.  Overall, while I think this is one of the more astounding beers I've ever tasted, I do recognize that only the most hardy of beer-drinkers could appreciate the result. Buyer beware, then: if you think Guinness is borderline, this is definitely not the drink for you. But if you seek the thickest, darkest, mealiest, most flavorful stout on the planet, you have a shot at a contender with this one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Treebs,4.4,"Review #100  2008 Vintage. 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter.   A: Pours a jet black, slightly viscous with quick half finger dark caramel head that quickly dissipates into nothing leaving some slight popping bubbles.   S: I'm picking up the bourbon right away and it's still fairly strong for being almost 3 years years old. This makes me happy. I'm picking up some light oak notes, almost like wet wood chips, with very faint hint of smoke.   T: From first sip there is a multitude flavors. It's a roller coaster of flavor enjoyment. The opening of this brew is a slight kick of bourbon with a charred oak smokeyness, like the embers of a campfire. It's smoothes out in the middle to a very light vanilla and finishes with an almost roasted coffee malt. As the beer warms the heat from the alcohol becomes more pronounced.   M: Slightly syrupy on the mouth, heavy bodied with little carbonation. The brew coats the palate leaving an oaky and light dark chocolate mix. Minutes after a sip the taste still clings to the tongue.   O: Wow. I saved this for my 100th review and I'm glad I did.

Pours black, like used motor oil with a small head that fades quickly and ultimately clings only to the edge of the glass.  The smell is bourbon heavy with hints of raisins, figs, amd molasses. Great nose on this thing.  This is an unbelieveably well-balanced beer. Bourbon is present and the rightful centerpiece, but it is augmented nicely by coffee, some chocolate, and a little bleu cheese in the finish. I heart this beer.  The feel is smooth and velvety wit a great presence. Surprisingly, there is no alcohol burn.  Overall, this is a fantastic brew.

1549,10672,coachdonovan,4.01,"Happy to be able to try an edition from 12/18/09, aka before InBev got in there to (potentially) muck things up. This has been chilling in my cellar since March 2010.  The psst from the cap tells me this bottle should still be in good shape, but the flimsy head is almost not there, despite the appropriate serving temperature. 100% pure black, even held up to the late afternoon July sun.  Aroma is nearly overpowering, but in a complexly good way. Smells of sweet mocha, brown sugar, vanilla, overripe dark fruit, and enough oaky booze fumes to give the nostrils a tingle.  Well, well, well. This is some fucking bourbon beer. Starts out smooth and chocolately for about a second or so, and then the bourbon surely kicks in. Initially I wasn't prepared for the intensity, and it came off a little burny. But just as I think the whiskey flavor is going to wipe out everything else, it quickly fades and I get a smoother oaky vanilla finish that hints at the early chocolate flavors.  As I make my way alone through the entire bottle in one sitting - not an endeavor I would recommend - I can certainly appreciate what this beer is all about. That doesn't mean I love it, and I don't think anyone who's not a whisk(e)y guy will. The second - and warmer - glass carries a bit more of the hard alcohol sting.  As bourbon aged stouts go, I can't imagine anything more authentic than this. I'm glad I could try this beer, see what the hype is all about, ponder its significance in the beer industry/community. And I will never buy it again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

There are glints of ruby red on the edges. A dark brown head quickly forms and dissipates. The legs are gorgeous.  The smell is very, very rich. Dark fruits, toffee, vanilla and brown sugar come through in varying quantities. There's a definite boozy scent, but there's no harshness in the nose.  The taste in similarly complex. There is a deep bourbon flavor here, but like the smell the heat is almost nonexistent. In place of the alcohol burn are rich oak and vanilla notes, caramel sweetness, and a tobacco character evocative of scotch. I can feel a slight warming in the back end of my throat, but again the burn is just not there. Compared to fresh bottles I've tasted in the past, it's clear that the flavors have really settled and coalesced wonderfully.  Syrupy is the only way to describe the mouthfeel. BCBS is thick and rich - this defines mouth-coating.  I truly regret not stocking up on this beer when it was readily available in Boston. This beer - and more specifically, this vintage - merits the praise it garners. Phenomenal.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T: Chocolate sweetness upfront with roasted nuts and bourbon. Absolutely delicious. Coffee and cocoa becomes much more apparent as the liquid comes to temperature.  M: Thick, thick, thick. Probably one of the most dense beers I have ever had. It coats the tongue with a layer of roasted cocoa and nuttiness. Some heat detected first few sips, but smooths later in the pour.

No light had even the slightest chance at this one. The slightest head, maybe 1/4 finger, and went away instantly. Head never came back, even with an aggressive swirl. No lacing (but with no head what can you expect?). Huge alcohol legs. Just a beautiful beer!  S: Not the greatest smell. Pretty boosy, but what can you really expect from 13% ABV? Chocolate. Light coffee. Light caramel.  T: OMG! Dark chocolate. Vanilla. Light coffee. The finish? About a minute, maybe more (seriously), worth of a butterscotch flavor that keeps building and building, begging you not to take another drink, until it fades and you HAVE to take another drink.  M: Full bodied. Creamy. Decent.  O: Up with the best beers I've ever had. I love butterscotch.

1549,10672,elgiacomo,4.57,"12oz bottle (screw cap, really!?), bottled Oct 28, 2008. 2.5 years old. Served at cellar temperature. Huge thanks to Ryan for this gift.  Pours black with a one finger brown head that leaves short-lived lacing and holds a wispy cap and foamy ring.  Aroma is deep, rich and powerful bourbon, very strong on the bourbon with great underlying notes of premium dark chocolate, anise, black currants, roasted malts, coffee, and some dark fruits such as figs, raisins, plums as well as some sinus-clearing alcohol. Excellent strength and complexity. An aroma so strong, I taste it without having to take a sip. Damn.  Flavor is bourbon, and lots of it, but never overpowers the incredible base beer which features notes of dark chocolate, anise, black currants, plums, raisins, figs, caramel, oak, vanilla, dark roasted malts, coffee. Hops? heh. There is some sweetness and alcohol on the finish but minimal considering the 13% ABV. Dangerously drinkable and crazy complex.  Mouthfeel is full, sticky, thick, with soft-ish carbonation.  A sipper in every sense of the word. An absolute treat. A revelation. A journey.

1549,10672,Cavery,4.05,"Shared last weekend with Klym, review from notes!  2009 750ml bottle into over-sized wine glass.  A: Midnight in a glass, completely opaque with a ring of foam surrounding the edges. A modest half finger head formed, but the boozy body forced it not to lace, thus it rapidly disintegrated. Nothing alarming, all according to plan with a big beer.  S: Copious amounts of those familiar dark beer dark fruits: Fig, Cherry, and subtle prune. A bit of an unexpected menthol peppermint sting to the nostrils. An overt note of big bourbon is assimilated with the musky peppermint.  T: Dark fruits continue into the taste, but are restrained by a soothingly warm alcohol. Strong menthol sensations cool the mouth and throat. Sipping revives the cycle of warming alcohol and cooling menthol. There's a biting saltiness in the finish. This is a savory stout that emphasizes the convergence of dark fruits, scorched malt sweetness, and salty cream sauces. Delicious, but not for the faint of heart.  M: The mouth is greatly complimented by all prior characteristics. The menthol complexity parallels the rolling carbonation in the mouth for a unique drinking experience. A full body with airy mint qualities that sits atop the brew like a fancy garnish. This is great on this savory stout.  O: This beer is the work of a fine brew-smith. This is a complicated beer review. It is a unique brew that could be mistaken for a monotonous one. The mouth and flavor synchronization makes for a memorable savory experience that I hope is not lost on too many drinkers. Give credit to the brewers of this beer as you would the chefs of fine restaurants, and be sure to tip well.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Lots of bourbon up front with a nice warm alcohol burn. Hints of oak, dark fruit, and vanilla. The finish is warm and a bit bitter.

1549,10672,SubpoenaDeuces,4.7,"A: The bottle pours a slick deep black with a light khaki head, The lacing is light but the liquid grips and obfuscates the sides of the glass. No light penetrates this darkness, not even at the edges.  S: It smells like a cherry cordial melted into a spiteful sludge. There are notes of dates, currants, licorice, and dark chocolate. There is an earthy oak to it too that makes this 12oz bottle pack a haymaker.  T: The taste is surprisingly straight forward, the fruits are absent from the taste but the coffee and chocolate notes make a big impression. There is very little hoppy dryness, just a full, welcoming sweetness that is followed by mellowed by a big coffee body that has a slight heat that would benefit from some aging, but that is the case with most people obsessed with chocolate.  M: This doesn’t have a huge Abyssesque body to it. I don’t chew on the malts for hours and ruminate on it. Given the impressive ABV, it gets in, imparts a huge flavor and the finish is pretty standard. I am sure you would be able to smell this a mile away, but the taste doesn’t linger too long, which is a good aspect since the initial taste is where it is at with this beer.  D: As far as imperial stouts go, this is excellent. For something this huge with a staggering presence, I think I could actually go beyond the 12oz and request a bomber to myself. The weather will likely be the deciding factor for this beer as most situations outside will not be equal opportunity employers for stouts in general but the sweetness and light finish to this stout puts it in a nice position to argue its case for outdoor activities.

1549,10672,Klym,4.47,"2009 vintage poured into an oversize wine glass.  A: Pours dark with a dark red shine outlining throughout the glass. Wheat brown one finger head that dies quickly into a bubble ring around the top with close to no lacing. Nothing alarming but nothing unusually impressive.  S: Bourbon, roasted wheat grains, molasses and a little bit of fig in the nose. Traditional high-quality bourbon barrel aged stout smell.  T: Such a smooth, rich, and spicy bourbon taste upfront that then rolls through the taste of a dark fruit sucked of most of its sweetness then soaked in bourbon and rolled in savory spices and finally ends with a milk chocolate esque sweetness and some bourbon burn/dark chocolate bitterness in the after taste. Delicious, high quality, but no large step away from a great many well-made bourbon barrel aged stouts.  M: Mouth feel is surprisingly carbonated considering the evaporating head. Nice feel in the mouth but a little prickly and almost numbing toward the end.  O: If they aimed to capture Bourbon character in a stout and smooth it with beer qualities and add a little spice, they have done a great job with this beer. It's perhaps unfair that I've tried this after many other bourbon barrel aged stouts when it is one of the more original ones in the timeline, but I have a hard time getting excited over this given the great many other stouts that emphasize the bourbon and ride its beerified glory. Wish it would go further beyond its barrel, but still undoubtedly an incredibly delicious stout with beautifully integrated flavors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The burnt wood and bourbon is quite apparent in the middle, overpowering the sweet chocolate. On the back end, there is more bourbon, oak and charred wood, but there is also some espresso and chocolate.  M: A nice full bodied beer that leaves a slightly boozy taste on the palate.

It was black and viscous, coating the sides of the glass on a swirl, almost too thick to leave a lacing.  S: Strong, strong dark chocolate base with nutty overtones and hint of dark forest fruits. Bringing the beer close, I could smell/feel the bourbon. Not overly complex.  T: First sip almost knocked me over with the dark chocolate -- we're talking 90%+ cocoa content dark chocolate -- and I began to wonder if this was really from the same batch I'd fallen in love with a few months ago. As I continued, the drink really opened up. Though the dark chocolate remained, hints of earthy nuts, cassis, and coffee began to shine through.  M: Almost milky in consistency, it had a mostly enjoyable mouth-feel. It was warming in the mouth like a sipping bourbon, but not on it's way down the throat, which is a good thing.  O: Still a fantastic beer and one of my favorites, but I think I let my mind run away with me after the last tasting and built this beer up to mythic levels.

1549,10672,GDBEERMAN,4.32,"At 12oz bottle into snifter. Bottled on 09.24.10 – 2010 Vintage – lot number 2056  A: As I have seen with the Bourbon county family, they do not have good head formation or retention, so with a vertical pour, I was able o get about a one finger radiant khaki head that dissipated within 30 seconds. The body is jet black and creates a lunar eclipse when held to the light. The lacing is non-existent.  S: The aroma of the bourbon barreled beast is a dominance of.. well bourbon, but a deep waft shows a a bitter hop complexity and a solid malt background as a base. This is a medium to high intensity aroma, while bourbon is in the forefront, it is in the name sake and as the vintages age, this becomes less evident, but this is a fairly fresh batch.  T/M: When the brew hits your lips, it creates a smooth, but thick sludge, that finishes well and leaves a warming and powerful mouthfeel. The bourbon is a very nice addition to a stout of this caliber. The notes of hop bitterness found in the nose are at the depths of this beer and hard to find among the overwhelming bourbon character. As for the mouthfeel, there is a creamy aspect that is Bourbon Brand County Stout that cannot be matched. One of the best high end stouts that has a high ABV and is still drinkable, (yes BCBS and the word drinkable, haha, where did the beer in my glass go?) The lingering sensation holds the key, which is the hop bitterness that makes this brew complete.  O: Overall, this is a beer for a cold night, break on a cross-country ski tour, hot tub, cigar, or a mid-morning watching one of my dogs with two torn ACL's, which I have enjoyed all of the above, unfortunately I am watching one of my six dogs now with a busted leg and this brew makes the warm, sunny day spent inside a bit better. But the beer has a very good way of hiding the ABV and the flavor characteristics give it a reason to go back.

1549,10672,Auracom,4.36,"Unbelievable. BCBS is nowhere to be found in virtually the entire midwest (including hometown Chicago), and the night I arrive in Rochester I find cases of the stuff in both 2010 and 2009 vintages.  This review is of a 2009 12 oz. from May 22nd, served in an over-sized wine glass.  The appearance is as-expected. Absurdly-dark black coloring, entirely opaque. Light just doesn't belong in this brew. No head. No lacing. It swirls around in the glass a bit thinner than I anticipated. Rather menacing when it's completely stilll.  The aroma is DOMINATED by bourbon. Underlying tones of dark chocolate, raisins, and dates. Roasted notes really weren't present. The nose is overwhelming at first... the bourbon really is something else in this piece.  Taste follows with more complexity. Again, the bourbon is just kick-you-in-the-face powerful, but underneath that sits slight dark chocolate, stronger milk chocolate, more dark fruit, and a little vanilla (which really is very helpful for this profile). The ABV is quite strong. This bottle still needs more age. The bourbon notes do balance out a bit once you let this hit room temp.  Mouthfeel isn't too thick or chewy. Smooth as butter with decent carbonation. Relatively dry, long finish.  I cannot help but put this one head-to-head with the beloved KBS. This certainly has less balance and goes more for broke on overall intensity. It is a hellishly-intense stout. The bourbon is so dominant that I can see how people might be turned off and find this very undrinkable, but I find bourbon damn delicious so yeah. If you want absolute balance, go KBS. If you want huge profiles, go BCBS.  Update: I won't regrade this one, but I do want to mention that the 2012 vintage, even fresh, is superior to the 2009 I had. Vastly improved mouthfeel, better balance, but still absurdly robust flavor profile with a kick-you-in-the-face level of bourbon. Also, 14.5% ftw!  Update #2: The Fall 2012 batch of BCBS is utterly fantastic. Now @ 15%, it's as well-balanced as it's ever been. Easily bests KBS. Would probably put it around a 4.70.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,claspada,3.38,"2008 bottle thanks to ericfb18. Pours completely flat pitch black with no head which is upsetting. Probably the most lifeless beer I have ever seen to be honest.  Aromas of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, dark caramels and a ton of oak and bourbon still after 3 years.  The taste is pretty damn serious. Huge doses of vanilla, bourbon and wood, this is definitely a sipper and it;s kicking my @$$. Really intense amounts of bourbon, more so than any beer I have had to date. I had this on tap a several months ago and it was much more balanced; maybe the hops falling out have made this a tad to thick for my liking. Becomes more booze and wood intense as well as it warms and the chocolate and sweet vanilla notes become less of a factor.  The mouthfeel is thick and heavy, no carbonation what-so-ever here. The alcohol is up front in your face as well; which I can tolerate as a bourbon drinker but this is pow in your face over the top. Becomes more oak and wood intense as well as it warms.  Overall I enjoyed this much more a few months back fresh and on tap. Maybe the vintages have become more mellow since 2008 or was just a heavy/new barrel they were using back then.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,vkv822,4.64,"12oz bottle into snifter. 2008 vintage. Big thanks to jbck109 for this awesome extra!  Pours black with a thin bubbly caramel-mocha colored head that quickly dissipates to leave a thin ring of tiny bubbles around the rim.  The nose is a wonderful blend of chocolate, bourbon, oaky-vanilla.  The taste follows the nose, with rich chocolate notes, lightly roasted malts, bourbon and vanilla-oak notes. It finishes with a very pleasant, warming, bourbon feel.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with subtle carbonation. Very pleasant, though it could be slightly more viscous in my opinion.  A truly amazing beer that has aged wonderfully and I am very thankful to be able to try. The flavors are incredibly balanced, but have not become muddled. They are all given their chance to shine at some point.  Again, a huge thanks to jbck109 for the generous extra!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JoshVandy,4.74,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet, as I've reviewed a few of the variants.  2007 Vintage.  355mL bottle with a bottled on date of 10/17/07 into a Founders snifter.  A- Pours nearly pitch black with just a small half finger tan colored head before disappearing back into the daunting liquid in the glass. Pretty par for the course on the appearance for BCS.  S- Um, what? This smells amazing. Strong chocolate and bourbon notes jump out of the glass, along with a very nice vanilla component as well. This smells a lot like the Vanilla variation, only more subtle in the vanilla. Roasted malts and a hint of oaky dark fruits also come through.  T- Wow. That's about all I can say. Follows the nose quite well, with chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla notes all seamlessly integrated together. All of the strong heat from the barrel has almost disappeared completely, making way for all of the other flavors to shine. Nice warming heat in the back of the throat as it finishes, with absolutely no traces of its 13% ABV. This beer is something special.  M- Thick, creamy, and mind-meltingly smooth, with medium carbonation. Absolutely coats the mouth in flavor, lingering relentlessly until the next sip.  O- Simply put, I was blown away by this vintage. Any gripes people have with this beer being ""hot"" and not very good can be laid to rest with this vintage, obviously. Almost 4 years in the bottle have done wonders to this. There is not a trace of alcohol in this beer, with only the full flavors and subtle heat of bourbon and slight oak remaining to tell you this was aged in a barrel. Smooth beyond reason, I could easily knock back a few of these before noticing the alcohol. I'm so glad a have a bunch of these left to savor over the coming months and years. If this is any indication of what Rare is like, I'm in for a treat when I open that bottle. A fine example of a nearly perfect -bal beer. Well done.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,NWer,4.95,Poured deep rich black into my brandy snifter. Aroma is overwhelming. Bourbon in spades. Incredible nose. Extends to taste matching the aroma.

1549,10672,bfields4,4.5,"Black as night with a nice caramel colored head.  Bourbon bellows off this beer. The first thing to hit my senses as I poured it into the glass. The oak character comes through as well. Nice dark chocolate malt aroma. Vanilla is also very present.  Wow very complex flavors. First thing to hit my tongue was cherries than a smokey oak and charcoal. Dark chocolate and a touch of vanilla. A bit of heat bites at the end of every sip.  A phenomenal brew. Nice and chewy, but still velvety smooth. A touch hot for me but a perfect special occasion brew.

1549,10672,mjtiernan,4.77,"Vintage 2009 - 12oz bottle poured into a Brooklyn snifter  I did this review as a side-by-side tasting with an ’11 KBS  A – Black with a modest amount of brown bubbles that dissipated into a nice ring around the outside of the glass.  S – Mostly vanilla and oak and bourbon with some chocolate in there.  T – Oh this is good! Time has been good to this one. It has almost transcended from beer to food. There is virtually no heat from the bourbon…not nearly as much as I expected from the nose. Bittersweet chocolate is very present, as is cream. Getting a good amount of black pepper. There’s actually a really nice cake or breakfast cereal quality that I can’t quite put my palette on.  M – Luxurious. Good amount of carb. Drinkability is way more than you should expect from a strong barrel aged stout.  O – This is an amazing beer right now. Get as much as you can because it may not be around forever.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,deadonhisfeet,4.86,"They had growler pulls of this at the local suds merchant and after perusing a few reviews from my fellow beer advocates (thanks team!), I had to get this. It pours pitch black with a fine dark tan head. The nose is like freshly baked cookies, vanilla beans, and Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Flavor? Oh man, is this stuff rich! It's much more like a liqueur then a stout. It is sweet and rich with an incredibly thick, creamy mouthfeel and very little, if any, booziness. Every swig brings a rush of flavors: bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, cream, hazelnut, toffee, maple syrup.  Let's be clear about one thing: this is NOT a session beer. This is more of an ``after-dinner, enjoy with a huge wedge of the darkest, richest, chocolatiest cake you've got'' beer. Given the insane level of richness, I'm sure there are a lot of beer drinkers who will not care for this. It takes me quite a while to get through one serving of this stuff. That said, this beer is completely, utterly unique and Goose Island is really pushing the boundaries of the style with this. One reviewer claims he tried it over vanilla ice cream and it was superb. Darn - I wish I had some vanilla ice cream on hand! If I did, I would take some of this beer and reduce it down with a little butter and brown sugar and make what might be the greatest dessert sauce on the planet.  EDIT: The above was done when I was just getting back into craft. I don't think this beer is so unique anymore. I have had it numerous times now out of bottles and prefer the bottles I've had to the growler. The bottles I've enjoyed had much more alcohol warmth and more pronounced roasty flavors (more coffee and dark chocolate) than the growler. They also weren't nearly as sweet. Ratings adjusted 4/5/13.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,s1ckboy,4.45,"Took me a couple of tries but I finally came around to this beer. Now one of my favorite bourbon beers. Definitely has the typical imp stout flavors, choc, coffee, roastedness, and certainly molasses in the aftertaste.

1549,10672,deleted_user_574223,4.5,"I poured this imperial stout from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized snjifter. It poured an opaque black with virtually no head. A nice syrupy brew.  The nose is delightful with notes of bourbon and dark over ripened fruits.  The taste is deliciously sweet with maltiness, and chocolate covered cherries, oh...and don't forget the bourbon. It actually has a nice bourbon booziness that I found enjoyable.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a slight alcohol burn that as a whisky lover I did not find unpleasant in the least.  After a long day at work this was definately a nice way to start the weekend. Enjoy!!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,drewba,4.71,"2009 vintage poured into a snifter. How the hell have I not reviewed this beer yet?  A - An aggressive pour yields a fairly significant deep mocha head with impressive retention; I wasn't expecting much of a head at all, let alone one that stuck around for more than 10 seconds. The beer itself is a deep jet black. Light tries to get through this, gets stuck, then is ultimately swallowed into the abyss. Lacing looks full and like paint, it barely falls at all.  S - Cherry, old wood, heaps of sweet bourbon peppered with vanilla, hints of chocolate and dark fruit.As soon as I uncapped the bottle, the smell started wafting from the bottle, but now that I have it in a glass, it isn't as big as it was minutes ago.  T - I'm a little mesmerized by the bourbon qualities because it is the dominant flavor, but is so subtle, so refined, so unintimidating that I cannot believe that how much this beer has changed from the drunken hot mess that this was 18 months ago. The bourbon is smooth, showcases vanilla, a touch of cherry, toffee, leather and tea. Roasted malt and milk chocolate works parallel to the bourbon flavor, adding another dimension of flavor to a beer that my tastebuds are already having an orgy with. I just burped and smells/tastes like a tootsie roll. I feel like I just died and went to bourbon county. I was debating between giving this a 4.5 or 5 because of a little dry/old wood and slight alcohol presence in the aftertaste, but I just cannot wait for the next sip and more tootsie roll burps.  M - This is thick without me feeling like I'm drinking expired milk (a favorite drink of mine) with a very lively carbonation that really helps it pop.  O - The 09 is doing really well and is on it's way to being a super duper fabulous beer. While the alcohol heat has mellowed very well, I'm still feeling it in a little in my lips and in the back of my throat, like a little reminder to not fuck with this beer. This beer is so good that I feel like I have to wait until I have an occasion to open one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Sorry about the time off, its been non-stop but my plan is to rally over the holiday. I did get together with Hophead101 and we tore through bottle 1, and I'll add that tasty little surprise soon.  A - Pours an oily pitch black with no foam until the very end when a small layer of tan bubbles surface and just as quickly disappear. The screw top lid has me slightly worried. A quick swirl of the glass leaves a slowly dropping oil resin on the sides of the glass.  S - Lots of roasted malts, dark chocolate, toffee. I keep going back to it smelling it over and over. Its quite nice, semi boozy,  T - Wow, just loads of chocolate washes over me in waves of creamy goodness. There is a slight booziness that warms me on the inside, I'm sensing some plums or other dark fruit as well. I'm really liking this one. It definitely has the feel of a 10%+ beer that just leaves a bourbon flavor in my mouth  M - thick and oily like the gulf of mexico, there is very little carbonation but some sort of prickly sensation in the mouth.  D - This is way too drinkable for what I assume is a high ABV. Its full bodied but not overly thick. I'm sure we'll get snow soon the way the weather is going, and I'd love to have one of these when it comes.  So the big reveal… Goose Island Bourbon County Stout 2007!

1549,10672,1Adam12,4.92,"Props to BarryMFBurton for trading this to me. 09 version. Popped the top and wow, big bourbon smell. Poured dark black with a nice fluffy quarter inch head. Massive amounts of chocolate taste at first, followed by malt, and when I swallow is when the bourbon just ran me over, which I loved. After that is when the coffee hit my pallet and lingered for a long long time. Awesome balance. Having the bourbon at the finish really lets the other flavors come out and be noticed in the beginning. Such a creamy mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated, but not overdone. ""Wow"" is all I can say about this beer. I was blown away.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BarryMFBurton,4.29,"Wow, I can’t believe I found Bourbon County Stout at a liquor store in late May. It was sort of hiding in the craft beer walk-in fridge at this place, though. Either way, I’m happy that the Rural Inn on Indianapolis’ east side had a four-pack left just for me. Even though I haven’t really been a huge fan of the Goose Island offerings I’ve had in the past, I’m excited to finally try Goose Island’s premiere brew. “BOTTLED ON: 11/12/09” is printed on the label, much to my approval. Cracking this open on the supposed date of the Rapture gives this one an even more special feeling, as well.  To the end of the world!  A: Pours a creamy, crude black. Its head, a dark brown, micro-bubbled film, quickly settles on top of the thickness that is the body. As I spin the glass, lacing appears, receding almost instantly in a unique way – a ring around the top of the body grows ever-thicker the more I move it around. Maybe it’s the age, or maybe it’s the ABV, but it’s different, and it has instantly piqued my interest.  S: Oh wow…a malty, chocolaty sweetness mixes with the inescapable scent of wood-aged liquor. There’s vanilla, sticky sweet caramel, and nutty goodness that, coupled with the roasted malts and fiery bourbon aromas, remind me of fresh-made s’mores around a campfire. Unbelievably pleasant. The alcohol isn’t overpowering at all.  T: My first thought after the introductory sip: ""Mother of God, that is good."" The alcohol glides over the palate, giving way to the most mellow malts I’ve had in a while, and a big, sugary vanilla flavor. After spicy and herbal notes appear, with some dehydrated fruits underneath, the body then rests comfortably on the smoky complexity that is wood-aging. The hops are almost overpowered, which is sad, because I love the naturally pleasing bitterness that comes from the Willamette variety. They still shine through, but in a subtle way. All that being said, though, there’s no getting past that slight tinge of overly-alcoholic cough syrup tastes that I felt in other GI booze bombs. I’m not going to say it’s ruining my experience, but it’s getting worse and worse with each passing sip (and as the beer warms, for that matter). It must be a brewery trait, because I’ve never experienced something like it anywhere else. Still, a complex and unmistakably enjoyable beer.  M: Wickedly smooth. The carb serves simply to give a texture to the peppery elements of the body. It keeps interest and expands the experience even further.  O: This is definitely a great beer – no doubt about that. Whether I’m going to seek it out again is still to be determined. It was one of those experiences where I loved it for one minute, and then I was just ok with it for another. I don’t think I liked it consistently enough to spend the money on it again. It has the fine elements that I expected out of a barreled-aged stout, but still had that artificial twang that I’ve come to expect from Goose Island. My next pursuit will probably be the BCBCS, which has a strong coffee flavor that I’m hoping will overpower the sad syrup notes that I didn’t like very much. All in all, though, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout gives a strong impression of passionate brewing, even if the execution is somewhat poor in a few key areas.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,gigaknight,4.68,"A- Opaque black pour in a tulip glass, 1/2 finger khaki head doesn't stick around long, but leaves a beautifully sparse halo of creamy foam around the edges.  S- Less bourbon than I expected, plenty of chocolate and toasted malt. It seems to need a little more warming to open up with more fragrant coffee notes. Black forest cake dominates the nose, almost no alcohol interference.  T- A flare of alcohol opens up the palate before rich chocolate and silky malt flavirs rush in. Vanilla and caramelly bourbon round out the finish. There's really more oak flavour here than bourbon, which is welcome for people like myself who aren't too keen on the sharpness and burn of bourbon. As it warms, more dried fruit flavors come through, namely dates and a little bit of dried prune.  M- Silky smooth through and through. Shockingly drinkable, but the finish is so long that it almost forces one to take a little extra time between sips. This is no problem, however, as I want these 12 ounces to last as long as possible.  O- All around happy drinking from Goose Island. This is a disarmingly accessible offering for even the meekest of stout lovers, pending a reasonable tolerance for alcohol and some oaky resonance.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Alpar,4.65,"Review #1  10' Vintage. (6/5/11)  A: Very little carbonation for the newest vintage of the BCBS, with just a little bit of retention on the outer perimeter of the snifter. Jet black per usual.  S: Lots of bourbon in the nose still but also getting some oak and hints of nilla'. I can am also detecting the leather that people always talk about. I've not noticed it in the older vintages though.  T: Bourbon is the first taste but more flavors open as you get past it. Oak is very prominent and there is also an anise flavor in there. The bourbon hits again on the finish and warms as it goes down.  M: Thick with just the right amount of carbonation for the style.  O: Still pretty hot but definitely becoming better. This is my least favorite so far. Still a damn good beer.  09' Vintage. (5/19/11)  A: Beautifully black with a small khaki head retention. Good sticky lacing throughout the snifter I consumed it in.  S: Reeks of bourbon but in the most exceptional way. I don't think there are many better smelling beers out there. The Bourbon takes a back seat as it warms, this is where the oak and vanilla with some subtle hints of chocolate that come into play melting together wonderfully.  T: Very rich and filling with a welcomed warming in the chest from the alcohol. Everything one would expect and hope for from a barrel aged RIS. Flavor really develops from the fridge to room temp. I enjoy both of the flavors offered though, however it does open up quite a bit at room temp and the craftsmanship can truly be appreciated.  O: Overall this beer is phenomenal and one of the best beers I've ever had the chance to try. I prefer the Bourbon County Stout with age on it though.  08' Vintage:  A: Dark black with less carbonation than the 10 & 09'. There is a very small bubble ring on the outside of the glass but its struggling to stay alive.  S: I can still smell the Bourbon, vanilla and oak. A lot milder than the later two vintages though.  T: Shit, this may have been too long to wait. Its good but the bourbon has faded a lot. I can taste it but it just doesn't have that kick it once did. It is extremely smooth though and has some other good flavors e.g. oak and a bit of vanilla, some tannins. There is no anise present so that is good.  M: Thick and chewy, I love this beer even with a bit less bourbon flavor.  O: Its still fantastic but I am just not too excited about how it has aged. I know that I like BCS with about 1 -1.75 years on it. No more.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This is so thick, I wouldnt expect any foam anyways.  (S)- Rich & decadent! Semi-sweet coca, molasses, and caramelized brown sugar. An obvious bourbon-ish warmth & sweetness underneath. Still seriously potent even after almost a year in the bottle.  (T)- Seriously rich! Semi-sweet cocoa, molasses, and a light roasted brown sugar sweetness. A light to medium boozy warmth as it goes down, but is fitting for something like this.  (M)- Dense, yet rather smooth going down besides the alcohol warmth that reminds you what you are dealing with! Good carbonation level with a surprising balance of everything. Potent, rich, sweet, and ever so slightly bitter; but it all fits together to create something truly dynamic and complex. This separates the boys from the men. ** Having had this vintage older really smooths this beast out!**  (D)- A fantastic stout that is meant to be aged. Even with a year on this one, it still has a serious backbone! Great now, but will only get better over time. One of these will seriously kick your ass though, but it just tastes so good! Cannot wait to try one at 5 years old. **Updated my score on a few notes. Having recently had another bottle from 2008 with further aging on it has blown my mind.

1549,10672,benpopper,4.65,"This will be a review that gets updated over time. I have bottles of 05-10 and have had it on draft, so, with each new tasting, new notes will be added.  Notes of the 2007 Vintage from a bottle tasted on 3/30/11, from notes.  Poured from the bottle pitch black. Left a thin carmel colored head that slowly develops with the pour and dissipates almost immediately leaving great lacing.  The smell is decidedly bourbon but has hints of vanilla and the oak from the barrel.  Time has done it well. It starts boozy with the bourbon as if it just wants to remind you it was barrel aged because that fades fairly fast as a wash of toffee crosses my mouth. And as that fades this very nice dry chocolate is left in my mouth.  Mouthfeel was surpassingly smooth granted the start of smell and taste with booze. the burn is very light and has just enough carbonation.  I had the opportunity to grab a couple bottles of this vintage recently and really had to restrain myself from drinking them all right away, so good.  2008 vintage had on tap into a small snifter at the Binny's South Loop Tasting. From notes on the night. I did not have all three available 08-10, just the 2008.  Perfect pour, dark as the night, solid head that fades leaving some great lacing.  The smell poring out of this is incredible! Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, toffee, carmel, oak, vanilla. Holy senses overload batman.  This is one of the best I have ever tasted. Everything is so melded together yet separate. Like a well put together dinner course in a meal, all the different flavors reveal themselves at their own times. Bourbon is at the leading line, but is followed by chocolate and vanilla. Like splitting a scoop of Neapolitan ice cream in half. The Oak barrel sneaks in and then is followed by this toffee flavor that just lingers in your mouth forever. Makes drinking it slow easy as you want to enjoy every last bit.  Mouthfeel is superb. Very little burn, the booze is hidden well. It coats my mouth transferring all that flavor. Smooth smooth smooth.  Overall, all I can say is time and time again, I love this beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SkunkWorks,4.53,"Had on tap at Tap and Barrel in Smithtown, NY, served in a tulip glass. Unsure as to what the vintage is but probably the most recent one.  Look: I have to give it a five. Black as night body with a one inch, dark brown as could possibly be, creamy head that retains for a few minutes before dwindling down to nothing. No lacing but the glass is stained from the beer. The existence of the head is what surprised me and how good looking it was gives this beer the ultimate look score.  Smell: bourbon, charred oak, roasted barley, alcohol, vanilla and dark brown sugar. Complex as it is in the bottle and just as inviting.  Taste: follows the nose with a big bourbon flavor, vanilla, charred oak, brown sugar and alcohol but its still fairly sweet. A lot going on and all of it is good.  Feel: full bodied, oily, slightly boozy, and just enough carbonation to remind you that this is actually a beer. Definitely a sipper, but that's to be expected from such a large stout.  Overall: this is the most flavorful Budweiser you'll ever have (sorry, had to make that joke). Goose Island claims this is the original spirit aged beer and I don't know if that's true, but this nonetheless is one of the better bourbon barrel aged beers out there. I would definitely give this a try if you can before Budweiser mucks with it. Cheers!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Huge bourbon flavor but not boozy. Few years on the beer really smooths out the bourbon and hotness of fresh bcbs.  M- Thick, viscous, coats one's entire mouth.  O- One of my favorite beers ever.

1549,10672,slentz,4.29,"So after many years drinking craft beer I decided it's time to start reviewing some of these awesome brews!  2010 Vintage. Bottled 9/24/2010. Thanks to smakawhat for this awesome bottle!  A: Pop the cap with a very nice release sounds like good carbonation. Poured into my great divide tulip. Vigorous pour leads to a third finger head that quickly dissipates to very slight bubbles, minimal lacing on the glass. Beer appears to be pretty thin for an imperial stout. After a minute only paper thin remnants of head are left. Black as night, light does not penetrate this fierce stout.  S: Wow! Tons of vanilla, chocolate, licorice, spice, and oh yeah smells of super strong bourbon! Slight burn on the nose from the alcohol. As it warms get notes of molasses.  T: Smooth...again lots of vanilla and bourbon, some chocolate notes with lots of bite on the back end. The bourbon definitely kicks in on the aftertaste. Absolutely tons of bourbon and alcohol on this stout even after about seven months in the bottle.  M: Leaves an oily, slick feeling on teeth that lasts a long time. Not as heavy and thick as other BA stouts I've had.  O: Overall this is a very good stout but not the best I have ever had. It will be interesting to see how this beer will age over the next few years. After about 5 minutes and a few sips this one definitely has a warming effect on the entire body. With an abv of 13% this one is exceptionally smooth even though it does have a nice bourbon bite. I am a bourbon fan so this really doesn't bother me. Overall a very nice offering from Goose Island. I look forward to visiting this one again in a few months or even years.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jag21,4.67,"2009 vintage, 12oz bottle.  A: Dark as night, only with vigorous pour does small layer of brown head emerge from the darkness.

T: Bourbon hits me first, but in a great way, vanilla, roasted caramel & chocolate, coffee, & almost brown sugar, more bourbon  M: thick mouthfeel, creamy, full body, medium carbonation.

1549,10672,ThePorterSorter,4.52,"I purchased this beer before A-B purchased Goose Island.  Appearance: Black, pitch black with light in the room a fond memory. A thin halo of tan bubbles rims my glass, but they are small and provide considerable sticky lacing.  Smell: Sweet bananas and bourbon sticky sugars. Heavenly, so potently aromatic I had to try some immediately. There are notes of raisin, tobacco, and roasted figs. Incredible pungency and richness. A very dense, inviting beer with an obviously masked ethanol bite from the beer's boasted 13%abv.  Taste: Incredible. Less words describing the beer is sometimes better. However, I just can't hold back; this beer is a spicy, smooth, chocolaty liquor. There is heavy accenting from the barrel providing a dueling dragon effect between the barrel attributed vanilla and rich stout's chocolaty malts.  Mouthfeel: Smooth as velvet, full-bodied with bold flavors playing off all 5 senses (yes all 5 of them). I appreciate this beer at both warm and cold temperatures. This is definitely a sipper, but leaves a pleasant sweet/spicy aftertaste...I can't wait long for the next sip. I paired this beer with strawberry fruit leather and popcorn...you don't have to be as fancy as me by any means.  Overall: I paired this beer with good people, pertinent deadlines now being put off, and some Pandora Radio. Tonight is a good night, and it didn't cost much (approximately $10 a bomber) to get here. This is a cheap beer for all that you're getting in return (13%abv and incredible boldness!!). I am sad that yet another craft brewery sold out to ""the man"" with money at A-B. However, if this beer is made exactly the same and is cheaper (from more advanced equip, distributing, ect...) I will still be a consumer.

1549,10672,foogerd,4.37,"2006 Vintage  A- Black as night with a film of espresso colored head.  S- Roasted pecans and nuts, milk chocolate, vanilla powder, hardly any booze character that im used to when drinking it fresh.  T- The aging has taken away the characteristic burn which melded well with the brew when fresh, here the sweet bourbon and vanilla stands out and overtakes your senses.  M- Coats the mouth with an overpowering force of sweetness.  O- Excellent version, in my eyes I value both the fresh and aged equally depends what you're looking for from this brew. If you want that upfront bourbon burn then go for the fresh, but if your looking for more of a confectionery desert brew go for the aged version.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Big thanks to marine1975 for bringing this one to the tasting! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Vieille Provisions Saison Dupont Willie. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and big sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was pretty freaking tasty! I've had a few of these sitting my cellar for awhile now and have been wanting to tap into them. The alcohol on this one was still a prominent on this one for me. It wasn't overwhelming by any means, but I'm sure there are some more subtle characteristics to this one masked by it regardless. On the nose this one is quite big, but the flavor has mellowed some. Really nice backbone going on here.

Sweet marshmallow, maple and caramel candy... Absolutely brilliant!!!  T- Up front alcohol... but not in a bad way! Caramel coffee, chocolate, tons of rich and creamy vanilla! Sweet marshmallow, toffee, sugared nuts and figs... Burnt sugar, dried fruit, alcohol, and vanilla aftertaste... Damn... it's been way too long since I've had this dancing on my tongue!!!  M- Syrupy and completely coating!!! I can't think of another beer that totally coats the mouth like BCBS. Unreal, and exceptional as always!

Huge caramel note. Smells distinctly of Makers Mark. Hints of hardwood and walnuts.  T – Walnuts, pecans, caramel, vanilla, espresso, maple, brown sugar. Scotch. Silky malt. Chocolate and a surprising merlot flavor on the backend. The flavor profile traces a slow, complex and delicious arc.  M – Fantastically smooth. Booze ramps up throughout the finish into a note just sharp enough to make you pause and ponder the sip, but soft enough to keep you coming back for more. In this young of a bottle the 13% definitely says hello, but it accents the rest of the profile nicely. Lightly dry finish.

Initially, nothing else is evident, but sitting on this for a bit some oak and vanilla comes through along with a mild, mild chocolate note. Taste drops a massive bourbon bomb on the palate, and hits with some alcohol right away; alcohol burns and tingles the tip of the nose. More chocolate and roast comes through, along with more oak and vanilla sweetness. Very complex integration between these flavours.

1549,10672,BigBry,4.32,"2008 Vintage, 12oz bottle, $5.79. Bottled On date 10/16/08. From the label: ""I really wanted to do something special for our 1000th batch at the original Brewpub. Goose Island could have thrown a party, but we did something better. We brewed a beer. A really big batch of stout - so big, the malt was coming out of the top of the mash tun. After fermentation, we brought inn some bourbon barrels that aged the stout. One hundred days later Bourbon County Brand Stout was born. It's a liquid as DARK and DENSE as a black hole withthick foam the color of a bourbon barrel. The nose is an intense mix of charred oak, vanilla, caramel and smoke. ONE SIP has MORE FLAVOR than your average case of beer. It overpowers anything in the room. People have even said it's a GREAT CIGAR BEER. But I have yet to try a cigar that can stand up. Greg Hall, Brewmaster"" Hey, with a lead up like that, it has to be good. Pours a black color with ruby highlight. Minimal tan head, really just a thin ring. You could smell the bourbon as soon as the cap came off. Some roasted malt, charred burnt notes, a bit oaky, but bourbon whiskey dominates. The taste is not as hot with alcohol as the aroma would suggest. Flavors of roasted malt, some chocolate or cocoa, and the bourbon barrel; vanilla, oaksmoke. A nice beer with a background of bourbon, not overpowering alcohol burn. This is a sipper, to be enjoyed slowly.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is strong fermented brown bread, caramelized-burnt prunes, dark rum.  Taste is fairly complex, rich and strong, but not overly intense and fairly well restrained and balanced. It has coffee and dark toast, esp. in the finish, mostly caramelized sweet coffee & prunes, burnt sugar & a slight medicinal cough-syrup quality, esp. at the finish. It is boozy and alcoholic, with a rummy quality, but it is fairly mellow and very smooth and it is not rough or overly boozy, esp. considering the strength. It has some good complexity, with enough depth of character and with no single element overly intense or overpowering everything else. It is quite drinkable and never gets tiresome or boring, despite the fact that it is pretty strong and definitely a slow-sipping drink. It is excellent overall.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CashMoneyVagrant,3.25,"2010 vintage, reviewed on 1-4-11  Little to no head in the glass. What's there is deep brown in color. Bourbon on the nose, with charred wood, vanilla. Sweet/ beet sugar aroma. Dark chocolate, a little boozy, some dark fruit. Bourbon right up front in the mouth. Sweet, lots of vanilla, charred wood. Medium bodied not heavy, alcohol is not overpowering for the high abv. Dry, bitter, roasted malt in the finish, with dark chocolate, espresso coffee in there also. As the beers warms the vanilla & bourbon are the dominate flavors. Would pair nicely with a cigar. Low carbonation, with velvety mouthfeel, sticky upfront. It warms the belly as it reaches room temperature. I find this not really complex it's pretty straight forward. Bourbon, charred wood, vanilla, some dark fruits, with dark chocolate & espresso coffee not getting much else. The warmer it gets the more there's just vanilla & bourbon, and starts to get heavy in the mouth. Becoming hot & boozy, more bitter in the finish. For me it's just okay, I've had better examples of the style.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jamescain,4.42,"Poured into a sniffer at Chumley’s in Lafayette, IN. I finally got the chance to try this one and now I wonder why I waited so long.  Appearance: It pours a pitch black and in this dark bar there is no chance of seeing through it. There was a nice tan head, but that died rather quickly, due to the bottle being too cold.  Aroma: Big bourbon aromas, alcohol, subtle hints of vanilla, and roasty goodness. I could smell this beer all day. Luckily I needed to let it warm up, so I was able to just sit there and enjoy the aroma as I cradle it with my hands.  Taste: The taste is exactly how it smells. It’s big, it’s boozy, and it’s great! Sweet malty goodness with an undertone of chocolate all complemented by blanket of bourbon warming. The alcohol is not well hidden; however, it is not a bad thing in this beer.  Mouthfeel: This is a sipper for sure and if it was the only beer I have the entire night I will be happy. It’s not as thick as I was expecting and a little more carbonated then I was expecting, but I think that just wakes up the taste buds.  Overall: This is a great beer, one of my new favorites and I can’t wait to try the other versions. I look forward to see how it develops over the next few years.

Jesus Christ, I could smell bourbon before I even started the pour. Unbelievably boozey smelling along with some roasted malts. Black licorice and a bit of oak, but bourbon dominates. The taste is surprisingly less boozey and very well balanced. Flavors of vanilla, oak, roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate and then the warming alcohol. It really is shocking how boozey this smelled but how it didn't taste like a glass of bourbon. This is one heavy, slow drinking beer. This brew had about a year to age and I am curious how it is fresh and also how it is with a few years on it.

1549,10672,Nesued,4.82,"Purchased from Binny's in Chicago last year prior to 2010 Dark Lord Day weekend. Thought it would be appropriate to review it as 2011 Dark Lord Day approaches. Poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter after allowing it to warm a bit. 12oz bottle, marked as ""2009 Bourbon County Brand Stout"". Bottled on date reads ""01/14/10 2313""  Appearance - Squid ink black. A tan head formed as this bad boy filled my glass. A one-finger head topped off this offering but then receded to a thin tan ring. Little lacing. Carbonation? Hell if I know, it's like looking into a black hole. However the tan ring stays around for quite awhile as I let this beer warm even more.  Smell - To quote from the Moody Blues Late Lament, ""Breathe deep...."" but, no ""gathering gloom"" here, only rich oak and bourbon brown sugar sweetness as the opening chords hit your nose. Some dense roasted malt notes join the refrain. Vanilla and caramel lead you into the chorus of wanting to taste what you smell.  Taste - Writing this section last, only because there is so much going on I wanted to think about how best to describe the dimensions of this beer. It opens with sweet vanilla notes and an ""in your face"" unmistakable bourbon profile. No doubt as to what this stallion was fed. The middle is filled with flavors of dark chocolate, more oak vanilla notes, and a hint of an alcohol burn. The closing is a warming blend of alcohol and caramel. Thick on the tongue and gives you a lip-smacking finish. Rinse and repeat.  Mouthfeel - Thick and almost ""juicy"" can best explain the feel of this offering. Chewy and full-bodied with a just right amount of carbonation making it's reappearance in order to be the chariot to carry this load around your mouth.  Overall - Thank heavens this comes in 12oz bottles. You want more, oh you want more, but something like this you savor and let it fill your soul. Phenomenal balance of bourbon aging on this one. A standard by which to measure the use of barrel-aging to augment the flavors, not just ""increase-the-heat-by-aging-in-bourbon-barrels"" to a beer. This makes me want to try the Goose Island Rare even more now. Well done. Best barrel-aged stout I've had. So far....",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

With agitation it leaves small bubble lacing that has no retention and disappears quickly. Love the look of this brew but I wish there was more head retention and lacing.  Smells of bourbon and some coffee. Roasted barley, and vanilla as well. A great smelling brew. Well balanced, smell is aggressive but not overpowering. This smells damn good.  Tastes is of bourbon up front and then sweet malt, and then some chocolate to finish. This beer is a perfect balance and damn is it tasty. Can't wait until next winter on a cold evening. Wow!  Mouthfeel is medium weight even though the taste is so heavy, well done. Almost no bite at all. The resin and after taste is great, sticking to the entire pallet with chocolate, and roasted malt.

SMELL: Marvelous, I have been lucky enough to try two beers in the past month that have made my Top 3 best smelling list, this one and Pliny the Elder.

TASTE: The flavor almost precisely matches the aroma except the tail end provides something of a coffee kick which leaves a mild coffee aftertaste as well.  MOUTHFEEL: Smooth and oily, and like I was sipping bourbon, the BCBS went down with a nice warming sensation.  OVERALL: This falls into the absurdly delicious category for me. I can understand how people might not be able to drink a whole lot of this stuff in one sitting, but if I could continue drinking this all night I think I would. It is almost a shame that it is 13.5%, but then again, the boozy flavor is part of what I like and the warmth it provides is very comforting. This beer is exceptional.

A: Pours pitch black with a very thin soft dark brown head that disappeared into a thin collar leaving no lace. S: Soft notes of bourbon, vanilla and raisins. I also get sweet burnt sugar notes that smell like the hard sugary shell encrusting crème brulee. This actually smells a lot like crème brulee in general what with the vanilla notes and all. I maybe get a note or two of maple as well. T: Warm well-integrated flavors of bourbon, vanilla, molasses and roasted malts blend extremely well. Finish has a hint of roasted coconut, and the aftertaste has a touch of smoke. M: Velvety smooth mouthfeel with soft tiny carbonation and a thick chewy body. This beer is ""airy"" in my mouth and reminds me of a roasted marshmallow. Sure I can taste the bourbon, but for a 13% beer the alcohol is incredibly well hidden (at least after 3 years).

1549,10672,Satchboogie,4.59,"New Review from 4/5/11---  12oz bottle, 2009 vintage, poured into a snifter (reviewed 4/5/11)  A: Pours pitch black, completely opaque, very thin film of a head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Absolutely no light is getting through this. A head would be a nice addition, but certainly not expect from a barrel aged beer at 13%.  S: Right as I pop the cap a huge whiff of chocolate fudge emerged from the bottle! Once in the glass the nose is bourbon, chocolate fudge, vanilla, a little oak and char, rum/bourbon like alcohol in the background.  T: The bourbon is very strong on first impact, but quickly transitions to thick chocolate fudge, vanilla, and a little coffee. The heavy roasted malts begin to dominate in the middle with enormous layers of roasted chocolate malts, a little char, oak, and a small bit of smoke. The finish is smooth mocha and vanilla. I'm actually surprised just how dominant the coffee and chocolate is in the finish. It's maybe the best aspect of the flavor profile. It's like drinking an espresso chocolate cake soaked in bourbon! Wow! There is a good bit of alcohol in here, even after a year and a half of age. It comes through strong right up front and then comes back with a kick in the finish.  M: Just a little carbonation initially that makes the bourbon, char, and alcohol jump out of the glass and scorch the tongue. The body is as thick as it comes, while I've used the descriptive ""chewy"" a lot, I think I could actually use a fork to consume this beer, it's that chewy! The heat is pretty strong throughout. Finish is dry and bozzy with mocha, smoke, and wood tannins. The flavor lingers on the palate forever.  O: I've re-reviewed this (originally reviewed 1-02-11) as I believe my palate has developed a lot since I first tried this. While it's still hot and bourbon centered, it doesn't overpower my palate like it did before. Just an amazing level of complexity and deep, rich malty flavors are bursting from this beer. They really don't lie when they say ""One sip of this has more flavor than most cases of beer"". This is probably now my 3rd favorite stout behind '11 KTG, and '11 KBS. Amazing. I can't wait to try my last '09 bottle at the end of the year.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 for taste, mouthfeel, and overall is the heat and slightly overpowering bourbon. A tiny bit more balance and toned down heat and it would be straight 5s. Still, as is, it's amazing.  ---  12oz bottle, 2009 vintage, poured into a snifter (reviewed 1/2/11)  A: Pours pitch black, completely opaque, very thin film of a head that quickly dissipates to nothing.  S: Bourbon, really strong bourbon, oak/wood, char, a little vanilla. I think there's some dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee in there, but the bourbon and char aromas are overpowering.  T: Bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon. I knew this was bourbon barrel aged but wow, I had no idea it would be this strong! The bourbon and char explode the second it hits your tongue. As it mellows out the wood flavors, vanilla, chocolate, and bitter coffee start to come out of the wood work. The intense bourbon, char, and heat seem to tone down as the carbonation disappears.  M: Just a little carbonation initially that makes the bourbon, char, and alcohol jump out of the glass and scorch the tongue. The carbonation almost disappears in a mere 5 minutes or so and the initial bite settles down and lets the rest of the flavors shine through. The heat is pretty strong throughout. Finish is dry, boozy, molasses, bourbon, and wood. Just about a full body that is surprisingly smooth (albeit the alcohol does 'mess' it up a bit).  D: This is to be treated with respect. It's hot and abrasive. However, unlike a lot of other imperial stouts, this isn't something I could drink quickly even if I wanted too. I seriously need small sips and frequent breaks to ease the heat and prevent this from corroding my stomach.  This has really left me with mixed emotions right now, perhaps I'm just not completely ready for this beer. I've got 2 bottles left, I might just have to review this again later down the road.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dbossman,4.37,"A: Black and surprisingly bubbly with a brown thin head that dissipates quickly but continues to bubble  S: Obviously the bourbon is the show her but there is also a woody, grainy, malty quality to the aroma; some dark fruits--raisins especially and vanilla with a hint of roasted malts and chocolate underneath but of course overall this is a bourbon show with a pleasant alcohol burn  T: A big alcohol burn at first and then that turns into delicious bourbon: woody, grainy, slight touch of vanilla; also a surprising amount of roasted coffee bean flavor that follows the bourbon; lots more roasted maltiness comes through at the finish  F: Pretty chewy and viscous at first but a little thin at the end; enough beer sits on the mouth though making for a nice mouth coat  D: Amazing beer but it's strong with plenty of booze; sip this and sip it slowly and you will be one happy dude",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,VelvetExtract,4.15,"2009 Bottle.  A-Pour yields one of the most viscous pours I have seen. Oil black with no light penetration. A compact dark khaki head forms and recedes. Some good lacing here. Looks intimidating.  S-Very pungent nose. Clear bourbon notes accompany thick molasses, extremely rich chocolate, and alcohol. I get vanilla extract too. The whiskey scent is perfect in the nose. Smells like it looks...big.  T-The bourbon slaps the tongue quickly. Roastiness complements the bourbon exceptionally. After a few moments, the chocolate comes into play. Coffee beans round out the flavor profile here. The bourbon taste is the main attraction here. The booze is apparent, but its supposed to be there.  M-Heavy bodied. Very thick and very rich. Right where its supposed to be.  O/D-This beer is well balanced. It still tastes like a stout without going overboard with the bourbon. Happy to try it.

1549,10672,ThreeWiseMen,5,"I (Justin) drank this on tap July 29th, 2010 at Goose Island during an entire beer road trip. This was the last brewery we stopped at, and on the entire three week trip, the only time I got drunk. Why? Simply because this is the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. My notes go from sober to drunk really quickly. I recall wondering aloud if I should re-review all the beers I've ever given a ""5"" in, because clearly if 5 was bourbon county, then anything else was at best a 4.5. Here is my drunken review:  Dear Diary,  Today I had the best smelling...thing I have ever experienced. Let alone best smelling beer. To give this a 5.0 is an understatement and to say that.. well I assume it says alot. I'll let it speak for itself. I've had many beers in my time and nothing prepared me for it. At this moment in time there is nothing, I want more in life. I can't fathom a better beer. This is in ever possible way better than anything I have ever had. The smell is off the wall phenomenal. Natalia and Jason are telling me I've lost my mind... and I have. It's bourbon, but so much more. Coffee and Chocolate... but again, so much more. Figs and dark fruit... no it's more than that. The taste i sbold and rich... so damned rich. This is like your grandmother makes chocolate cake with bourbon then turns it into a beer. This is like all my favorite beers... taking their best parts.. and turning it into pure heaven: Abucus (Firestone) plus Black Tuesday (The bruery) plus Firestone 11. This beer has radically and irrevocably changed the way I review beers. Nothing comes close and as such I give this beer the obnoxious scores above. I didn't do an official review; instead I just kept ordering these things. No other beer has had this kind of impact..  The rest of the diary entry is smudged with what appears to be tears of pure joy and is illegible.  Even out of the bottle Bourbon County blows away the competition. On Tap and fresh.... I wish I could go back in time, beat the crap out of my past self, and steal all the beer I drank that day.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Meaty and chewy, caramelised sugar, very port like, liquorice. Some smoke in the finish.  M. Full bodied, ridiculously thick and chewy. So thick you almost need utensils to drink it with.  D.

Let me start by saying that I am super excited to try this as bourbon stouts are my favorite and I have not yet tried any of the Bourbon County varieties.  A- Nice and dark. A bit of a small head that recedes rather quickly. No lacing at all. Matter of fact, it looks like bourbon the way it recedes when the glass is tipped.  S- Bourbon, bourbon with just a hint of bourbon. It smells really sweet.  T- Okay enough of the look and smell bullshit, let's try this baby. This is good, very good. Really tastes like bourbon but damn it's sweet. Tastes like I'm drinking a chocolate bourbon cake. Alcohol burns a bit as well. This is a little too sweet for my taste. Well that just took the wind out of my sails for this brew. It's good but there are several others that I like much better.  M- Good carbonation. A little thinner than I usually prefer.  O/D- Ahh, one of these 12 oz. will do it for me. Sometimes if it's something I can't put down the beer will be gone before I can finish the review.

1549,10672,4DAloveofSTOUT,4.47,"Vintage 2009.  22oz bomber poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: dark black as night with a thin dark brown layer of head quickly giving way to a brown ring on top of beer.  Smell: Bourbon and alcohol. Some smoke and wood smells permeate carefully through the strong smell of the overwhelmingly sweet bourbon smell.  Taste: Sweet Bourbon and coffee that is not bitter more sweet like a vanilla flavored coffee. Hintings of marshmellow like flavor and dark chocolate where some bitterness comes in to lend a good balance without being overly bitter. Finishes with an alcohol taste that is more sweet than strong, but is quite pleasant. Smoke and oak are lingering in the middle and aftertaste of the beer.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, fantastic silky and sticky feel to this beer. Coats the mouth from top to bottom.  Overall: Will be looking to set a few more of these away for a long while, its worth the wait.

The foam is a very thin tannish brown.  S- It smells of a sweet bourbon mixed with a dark chocolate. Along with the sweet bourbon, you can get a sweet vanilla as well.  T- Out of all the variations of BCS this was by far this best BCS, even better than the Rare. With the first sip a very sweet bourbon and vanilla are up front, but as hits the back of the tongue a very smooth dark chocolate and sweet coffee come out. It was amazing balanced, it had almost no hop bitterness. After the 2008 version, I was unimpressed but now this has turned my opinion on the BCS.  Overall, for me this was the best stout of the BCS flight, which included Vanilla, Rare, and Coffee.

It's very very powerful. Not only the coffee, chocolate stout but you can taste the bourbon, oak, tobacco, and smoke. This is pretty in your face. M & D - not that drinkable compared with many.

Subtle tingle, but not as much as some of the other bourbon aged stouts out there. Very creamy and smooth. Leaves a nice cool aftertaste.

1549,10672,nhindian,4.04,"Got a few versions of the Bourbon County Brand Stouts, and starting them off with a mini comparison of the 2007 and 2009 vintages, split with russwbeck.  12oz versions of both, '07 poured into a Troegs Mad Elf tulip, '09 poured into a Goose Island wine glass.  A - While both beers had almost little to no head, the '09 version had the slight edge. About a half inch of dark brown head lays on top of the black body, which is completely opaque. The big advantage for the looks lays in the fact that after the heads dissipate, which doesn't take long at all, the '09 version leaves behind a nice ring of foam around the edge, as well as leaving a thin, wispy cap. Both beers are lackluster in terms of lacing, with barely any at all.  '07 - 2.5, '09 - 3.0  S - There is a nice contrast in the smells as well, with both beers showing different aspects of the beer. The '09 version is much more balanced, incorporating notes of chocolate, sweeter mats, vanilla, and a heaping helping of bourbon. Meanwhile, much of the chocolate is absent from the '07 version. Rather, the oak from the barrel, in contrast to the vanilla, is much more noticeable here, with more of the bourbon coming through. Both are very boozey, but the '09 version has much more in the nose to compensate.  '07 - 3.0, '09 - 4.5  T - As in the nose, the '09 is just much more complex and balanced. There's fudge and chocolate that are barely discernible in the '07 version, as well as more sweetness that mixes nicely with the vanilla from the barrel. The '07 is much more harsh without these additional flavors, but the oak is more apparent here. The bourbon in the '07 is actually bordering on a sweet fruitiness. A great attribute common to both versions is that the alcohol is there, but quite well-masked, or at least to the point where I wouldn't assume it to be pushing 13%.  '07 - 3.5, '09 - 4.5  M - Mouthfeel for both are moderately heavy with low carbonation. Both thoroughly coat the palate. If I have to compare, I'd probably say the '07 is a bit thinner than the '09.  '07 - 3.5, '09 - 4.0  D - Drinkability is moderately high. The '09 is far and away better than the '07 in nearly every way, so if you have some '07s laying around that you are contemplating drinking, I'd suggest them sooner rather than later.

1549,10672,russwbeck,4.86,"Comparing the '07 and '09 with nhindian  A: The '07 has basically no head, while the '09 has a small brown head that dissipates quickly. Hardly any lacing.  S: The '09 smells much more balanced. Chocolate tones make it sweeter than the '07, which is pretty heavy on the Bourbon. Regardless, both are pretty boozy. Woodiness comes through on both, but more for the '07.  T: Like the smell, the '09 seems to be the better one here. The balance between the Bourbon and Chocolate is wonderful, a bit of woodiness and vanilla coming through also. '07 is more heavy on the Bourbon. Chocolate is there, but subdued and the wood comes through far more. Warming alcohol feeling noted on both.  MF: The '07 is lighter than the '09, but both are pretty creamy. Carbonation is nice in both.  D: Not bad for the ABV. The '09 is the clear winner, and is more drinkable. Not to say the '07 is bad, they're both solid, but if given the choice, I would definitely choose the '09.  ---  2011 Version purchased at RFD Washington. Reverting my official review numbers to this, as it was fresh.  A: Motor oil black pour without much head.

One of the best smelling beers I've come across.. 5  T: Taste follows the smell. My God this is tasty. It tastes like a chocolate bar up front, Bourbon second, booze and roasted malts at the end.

1549,10672,EricCioe,4.2,"Had three vintages, 08-10, of this on tap at a vertical at Binny's South Loop.  All three of these poured blacker than the blackest black (times infinity), but only the 08 had a hint of thin khaki head. These looked quite viscous swirling around in the glass. On the nose there are huge hits of coffee, vanilla, lots of chocolate, and a huge boozy aroma. The nose didn't seem to change much vintage to vintage. In the mouth these were huge. The chocolate was the big note up front, but the bourbon and vanilla made for a huge finish that lingered forever. The body is huge, very viscous, not exactly cloying, but it didn't seem to want to go away, either. As the beer got older, the finish got a bit rounder, with the 08 being the best and much less astringent than the 10 with the 09 somewhere between. This was a good beer, but it was so huge that I was ready to be done with it when I was.  I didn't like this as much as I thought I might, but it was a real treat to try all three side by side.

1549,10672,zeledonia,4.7,"This is the first ""beer review"" I ever wrote, though it's not the first one I posted here. I enjoyed this beer so much, I felt compelled to write down my opinions on it. Took a while before I started putting my reviews on BA. Had on-tap at the Blue Nile during their stout and porter fest, October 2009.  2009 vintage. This is one hell of a beer. Syrupy mouthfeel, one of the thickest beers I've ever had. A real kick from the whiskey flavor and the alcohol (13%), that makes it very much a sipping beer. But the smell is fantastic and the flavors are incredible, with the bourbon blending pleasantly into the strong stout roasted barley flavor, and lots of molasses & vanilla. I've brewed and consumed quite a few whiskeyed beers, and none of them have been nearly as smooth and balanced as this one. Just really good (but best in small quantities - a 12 oz. pour was too much for me).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Janderson91,4.43,"2009 vintage poured into a DFH snifter. Bottled on 11/12/09. Enjoyed on 03/06/11. Been waiting to try this one for a while.  A - Pours a pitch black opaque with a half finger light brown head that doesn't last very long. Pretty good head for a beer of such high alcohol. Leaves no lacing. Coats the glass like a red wine.  S - A nutty wood aroma, vanilla, roasted malts, coffee and a lot of dark chocolate. Some alcohol present as well.  T - This is a great beer. Creamy mouthfeel works so well here. Lots of dark chocolate, again the nutty woodiness, vanilla and some coffee and roasted malt flavor. Finish leaves some dark chocolate and vanilla on the tongue for a while.  M/D - Mouthfeel is exceptional. Super creamy with just the right carbonation. Quite drinkable for the strength, only a slight alcohol burn.  An excellent beer from Goose Island. Can't wait to have some other variations of this one. Anybody want to trade??",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bnes09,4.19,"Perfectly black and devours all light. No head. Forms a brown film on the glass when swirled.  Intense and intimidating aroma. Bold coffee and baker's chocolate. Big scotch whiskey aroma as well. It seems as if you will almost get drunk from smelling this stuff.  The roasted flavor is unrelenting. Once again, coffee and unsweetened chocolate are the predmoninate flavors but there is also some burnt toast in the mix. Very bitter. Big molasses, prune and raisin sweetness attempts to mellow it out, but is overpowered by the roasted malt. Can't tell if there are any hops in this, but it doesn't matter, it's plenty bitter as is. Alcohol has nowhere to hide with a big bourbon flavor that warms as you drink. As it warms, the flavors mellow out a bit but are still highly robust and bitter.  Thick, chewy, and drying. Low carbonation but enough to make it interesting.  I actually enjoyed the palate assault that this beer delivered. Very complex. Definitely a sipping beer (I took about an hour and a half drinking it.) Not for an inexperienced stout palate but an excellent choice for someone who loves big stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bertram,4.83,"Found on tap, this stout pours thick, almost black with a thin tan head. The aroma of bourbon is evident from the moment the glass nears the nose. The bourbon-barrel aging is again evident in the taste - a powerful, bordering on overpowering (in a good way) bourbon flavor is laced through each sip. Overall a stellar stout made for sipping and enjoying that pairs excellently with a big, juicy steak.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,legalpete19340,4.33,"A: This bad boy poured pitch black and heavy into the glass. A finger's worth of deep walnut colored foam developed and then hung around in a fine ring.  S: The scents exploded out of the glass. The bourbon is very noticeable. Lots of sweetness including notes of vanilla and dark chocolate covered cherries.  T: The bourbon is forefront but I get double layered chocolate cake and dried cherries with a hint of woodiness. Very sweet. The whole thing is incredibly smooth and the heat from the alcohol stays well after a sip.  M: Thick and velvety but not syrupy. Perfect. Absolutely perfect.  D: Found this to be quite drinkable. Smooth, interesting and every sip left me wanting more. Its too sweet and boozy to drink much more than a single serving.  Incredible beer. One of the best I have ever tasted. For the ABV it was super smooth and refined, even balanced. Loved the bourbon and layers of flavors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,chilly460,4.47,"A - Pours dead black as expected, with a tightly bubbled one finger head, mocha in color. One nice looking beer. Thick and goopy, it coats the glass with a film as you swish it around.  S - Here goes, this was my first ""big"" barrel aged RIS. There's no waiting around to find out you can smell the bourbon on this as soon as the bottle is cracked, bigtime smooth molasses. Once through the bourbon, the complexity comes and it's awesome...I stood there with goofy grin saying ""Wow...wow...!"" as I took this one in. Most prominent is a butterscotch or heavy vanilla that is killer, then there's definite chocolate covered cherries. Small amount of roastiness as well, and definitely some alcohol warmth.  T - Again, this was a ""Wow"" moment. First is the smooth bourbon taste, no doubt. You get the sweet vanilla almost immediately, intermingled with those dark cherries. Also got a big taste of yellow cake batter, buttery sugar. It's such a big step up from other RIS I've had to this point. A tiny bit of saltiness at times, and definitely some smooth oak. It's a huge flavored beer, and you can get a different take on it with every sip. Only thing I wanted was more coffee/chocolate or medium roasted barley to help balance it out, if you married this beer with a Breakfast Stout it would be mind blowing. That said, this beer makes me understand what all the big barrel aged stout hooplah is all about.  M - This is a big chewy beer, but a tad more carbonated, and a bit thinner then the other monster RIS I've had.  D: Definitely a sipper, but I would say it attenuates the booze as well as other big gnarly RIS I've had. Makes you want to keep sipping to pick up all the different flavors, but could use a touch more balance to make increase the drinkability.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jar2574,3.21,"Bottled 10/9/09. Very little head. Pitch black beer, no light gets through. Not sure why, but I'm just not getting much head retention or lacing on the sides.  Smells sweet, boozy, a little malt but a lot of sugars. Smells like a great dessert drink.  This tastes like really good smooth Puerto Rican rum or a sweet Bourbon. It has about the same texture as a port. In other words, it reminds me more of rum/bourbon/port than beer. That's not necessarily a problem, this is a very unique beer.  Relatively low level of carbonation. Not terribly drinkable because it is overpoweringly sweet.  I give them props for taking the time to create something unique. Other than a lambic, this is probably the best example of a purely dessert beer, at least for me.  On the other hand, I'd rather not have it again unless it was for dessert. If I bought another bottle, I'd let it age for a while and see what happened. With this much alcohol and sugar I think it'd age well.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,websherpa,4.08,"2010 Vintage. I'll be having a 2008 shortly to compare.  Appearance: Black as night with a great 1 finger mocha head some lacing.  Smell: Heavy. Toffee, chocolate, caramel malts, some coffee.  Taste: All of the above with the volume up to 11. There is a boozy quality too, but this thing is a malt bomb. The finish is long and probably the most enjoyable part of the beer. I get the slightest hints of tobacco smokiness way way back on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Syrupy and thick. I get it. This beer is as thick heavy and flavorful as possible. However, something has to give, and I think I would have enjoyed this much more if the beer wasn't quite so thick.  Drinkability: It's a sipper. It took me a long time, to drink this down with a friend. I don't mind sipping on a beer for an hour, but this was just too much of a punch in the face and it bordered on being a struggle to finish. There is a lot going on here but it doesn't really blend well. It's like a garage band constantly turning up the volume on each part so they can be heard. In the end, you can't help but hear everything, but it's not really working together. Then again if it's too loud you're too old. I never really believed that though.  Finished the 08, same story as before. I think I almost sensed more heat on it, but I didn't have the back to back. Hard to say. The beer calmed down a little bit, but it's still huge.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BZero007,3.87,"Poured from a bottle of the current release. Poured a black tar color without the density. No head formed even with work. Lace did not show threw the entire drink as well. The aroma was welcoming and a preview of what was to come. Bourbon was up front and in charge of the smell. With sweet roasty malts in the far back ground. The taste was interesting and was not bad by any means. The bourbon was of course up front supported by the sweet malt in the back ground. To me even though the Bourbon was stronger by far I feel they melded together pretty well. The brew was a bit hot fresh. Would love to see how this beer ages, as I feel this is a classic example of a brew to cellar. I would probably stay away from the new release unless I plan to age them. Would recomend to anyone who has yet to try it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Oaky and bourbon hits the nose throughout. Smells slightly sweet also. T: Sweet maltiness at first, with a kick of bourbon/alcohol in the middle. It ends off with a bitterness similar to dark chocolate. M: Feels very thick in the mouth. The carbonation seems perfect. The combination of the carbonation and the alcohol makes the toungue tingle in a good way.

The bourbon just oozes out and stimulates the nostrils. Getting a licorice scent in there too. Reminds me of rum raisin cake. Oh man, I'm getting nervous for this one...  Taste & Mouthfeel: Oh so smooth and fluffy. Very surprised at how smooth and marshmallow in mouthfeel this is. Can I taste the alcohol content? Heck yes, I can! But, it's not so in your face to make the experience unpleasant....but it certainly is nudging me in the ribs. Just like the nose lead me down the path of bourbon, licorice and rum raisin cake, the taste is comparable. Has a oak like aftertaste that is unique with some spice and slight heat with it.

There is some heat behind it, but I just want to dive into this. Amazingly intoxicating smell.  T- A delicious blend of flavors. Coats the mouth with a vicious bourbony liquid, thick and creamy. Strong flavors of oak, vanilla, chocolate, and caramel. I just want it to last forever.  M- Awesome. I love big bodied beers like this. Not much carbonation, but perfect for the style.

The beer pours dark as can be with a tan head that quickly fades. The smell has loads of bourbon in it and a little bit of chocolate and boozy heat. The flavor is dominated by the bourbon with some choclate in there as well. This wasn't as smooth as the rare and definately had more alcohol heat. Still it was interesting and enjoyable.

1549,10672,Spider889,4.47,"Well, I did some muling for a couple people and got a bottle of BCBS from each person. I believe I have owen49 for this first bottle. This has been a want for a while, and after sampling this on tap in Chicago last month I couldn't wait to dive into the bottles at home.  Bottled on: 10/15/10, live review.  The beer pours a super thick ropey black. I tried pretty damn hard to get some head but it just wasn't in the cards. I did manage to coax a ruddy aged wood color ring of bubbles around the edges of my snifter. Black as night, ohh it's a beauty all right.  I took the tour at the Goose Island Clybourn brewpub and learned a little about the barrel aging process. Apparently they let the beer age for a minimum of 9 months, and then taste to determine when the beer is ready after that. Each barrel arrives wet from the distillery and is used only once, unlike what some other smaller breweries are doing. This process has won this beer awards, and the more I dig into it, the more I can understand why...  The smell is fantastic. Deep rustic licorice - think Panda licorice - not too sweet, very moist and natural. Vanilla wafts in and out of perception, but dry oak and warm bourbon remain throughout. I could smell this beer before the pour was finished. Brown sugar leads into molasses as the beer warms. With some heavy inhaling I can detect fudge brownies in the aroma as well. Ohh, how very inviting...  Well, I must say that this beer is a little hot, but despite that, I have to give it a 5 rating for taste. Frankly, this isn't going to improve recipe-wise at all. The only thing that might help is a few years age. The flavor is rich with bourbon - the alcohol is warming and smooth. Vanilla and charred oak captivate, while sweet dark chocolate and mild notes of coffee add depth and complexity. Sweet but not cloying, syrupy but not overly sticky. This ranks among the best barrel aged stouts I have ever tasted.  The mouthfeel is great. The beer is thick and chewy, much moreso than I expected. It is also extremely smooth on the palate, but warming to the brink of a burn on the throat as it goes down.  Drinkability suffers a little due to price and availability (impossible to buy in OH). Plus the booziness makes it an extreme sipper. That being said, I will never hesitate to drink this beer. Never.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CaptDavyJones,4.43,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter [seems almost like 5W-motor oil :-) when it pours]. Absolutely pitch black; dark as dark can be. Little to no head, but some very nice bubbles surfacing constantly at the center of the surface. The aroma of bourbon was evident as soon as the bottle was opened. Hints of sweetness presumably from the alcohol, some dark fruits and licorice aroma coming through. In short, smells very delicious. Very complex beer taste-wise, there are so many things going on in this beer. The taste upfront is sweet, with the sweetness coating the palate nicely. Slightly bitter finish, with a nice lingering aftertaste. Alcohol will definitely warm you up with every sip. The taste keeps getting better with time. Mouthfeel is so silky, rich and creamy. This is definitely a sipper. Hats off to Goose Island for coming up with such a big, bold strong beer. Paired it with pecan pie and it was pure decadence. In my opinion, this is one beer that every beer lover ""must-have"" in their lifetime.

Nose is bitter black chocolate and roasted coffee; nose has undertones of rich red fruit.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich and viscous. Well balanced and heavy on the palate.  Flavors are bitter espresso, burnt toast; charcoal; burnt chocolate, bitter molasses; assertive bourbon, vanilla and have soy sauce tones. A nice sipper; a good example of an aged stout but will not get better with more age. Pleasant initial ""sweet character"" is already gone and replaced with the more refined bitter character. Not bad or good - just different.  My personal preferance is drinking this one a bit more fresh. Perhaps an example of the fact that a wood aged stout may not need additional aging. Finish is soy, bitter espresso and light salt.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,plumcrazyfx,1.4,"2008 was great - 2015 is crap and that's what I'm rating - they did a short return window for infected beer so that is the review that sticks.  2008 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. This is the second time I've had this beer and the last one was a 2009 that I thought was kind of a boozy mess. Either the extra year made a hell of a difference or my tastes have changed (more likely). Wow, this 2008 might be the best beer I've ever had.  Poured as dark as motor oil with nearly no head. Smelled of sweet bourbon and vanilla. The taste was outstanding - heavy on the sweet (but not too sweet) molasses and vanilla with a warming blanket of bourbon, and right at the end I got a hint of chocolate syrup. Heavy mouthfeel but not quite syrupy - perfect for this style. I could have had another but I was content after finishing this beer.  The thing that blew me away about this beer is that I wasn't blown away by the 2009 when I had it. I also had a BORIS (not BA) right before trying this beer. I though that was a great beer and to have this 2008 GI BCBS totally walk all over it really, really surprised me.

A minute amount of bubbly lacing floats on top of the surface and twists about on the meniscus. A swirl of the glass leaves an oily residue all over the side of the glass much like a wine. This is a damn fine looking beer.  The nose is a huge wave of bourbon. Sweet, sweet bourbon... Bourbon gives way to vanilla and charred oak, as well as alcohol. Chocolate and espresso, and more bourbon on the nose. Roasted barley and brown sugar make an appearance as well.  The taste follows suit with the nose. Strong bourbon flavors right up front. The bourbon brings with it a lot of vanilla, smoke and oak with is really quite pleasant. After a few seconds flavor profile fades in a sweet caramel. This is how a bourbon bal aged stout should taste. If you are not a fan of bourbon this beer is not for you. This beer is damn good.  The 13% abv is excellently hidden and with the year and a half-ish on this one it is incredibly smooth. There is virtually no heat from the alcohol initially. As this one warms it does show slightly but not enough to take away from it. Smooth on the palate; just incredibly enjoyable.  I am floored by the quality of this beer.

The Aroma's, strong nose of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, smoked oak, sweet roasted malts, some heat from the 13% ABV on there too.  The flavors in the taste are exquisite, and they mirror the nose almost exactly. Bourbon, charred smoky oak, caramel, vanilla, sweet roasted malts, no bitterness, or yeasty esters, just sweet goodness. All the flavors are blended together so well, but are also very distinct. The alcohol is also more subtle on the palate then the nose, especially in the middle, with a velvet smooth finish.  Mouth feel is full, sticky, well carbonated, again considering the style, ABV, and age. Rich, decadent, viscous.

1549,10672,WhyBeNormal,4.77,"2009 bottle of Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout. I never thought I'd get a chance to try it because its 13% ABV make it illegal to sell in Ohio.  First thing I noticed was that this is one of the darkest, thickest stout I've ever had (next to DORIS The Destroyer). Stouts aren't actually black, they're an extremely dark brownish red. For example, Guinness (because everybody knows Guinness) is a surprisingly bright ruby. Seriously, hold it up to a light the next time you have one. But I actually held Bourbon County against a light bulb and no light made it through.  I expected it to be good, but I figured much of the hype surrounding it had to be because it's a limited release and people tend to just go apeshit over limited stuff. But it lives up to the hype and then some. No bullshit, I did not think a beer could have such depth or complexity. Bourbon, vanilla, toffee, semisweet gourmet chocolate, fresh roasted coffee beans, toasted nuts, and light oak pulled into a sum so much greater than any individual flavor. It's incredible.

With a vigorous pour several inches above the glass I get a nice two finger head the color of weak chocolate milk. Very chocolaty. More so than I remember from past vintages. Bourbon is up front and more subtle dark fruits and oak in the background. Very complex and well done aroma's. Lots of Bourbon flavors. Heavy vanilla, oak and sweet bourbon. Much chocolate in the flavor of this beer as well. A bit sweet overall, I'm missing roasty character and the viscosity is making it slightly cloying. Strong alcoholic taste, like hot cocoa and Bourbon, it's great but I need some more bitterness from roasted barley. Mouthfeel is thick but well carbonated. It's a bit to thick given the sweetness of the beer but that has to do with the taste. The mouthfeel is right on. I like it. This is not something I can drink more than 8 oz of. It tastes good but not great and it's heavy and very hot.  Edit: Editing this to work with the 'drinkability/oreall switch. A bit higher now.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,GeezLynn,4.52,"2008 bottle into a Cigar City snifter.  A: As black as it gets. Not much in the way of head, but leaves a sticky brown coating on the glass  S: Rich roasted and chocolate malts followed by coffee, vanilla, and cherry bourbon aromas.  T: Dense bittersweet chocolate, fudge, molasses, vanilla, followed by a heavy bourbon flavor. Smoother than a fresh bottle, but still plenty of alcohol bite.

1549,10672,lespaulrocker,4.27,"Bottled in October of '09, drank in February of '11. Split with a friend in a pair of pint glasses (we didn't have snifters, sadly).  A: This is the blackest, darkest beer I've ever seen. Lets absolutely no light through. Not a lot of head, small amount of brown foam which gives way to medium amount of lacing. Sediment left around the edges of the glass and found in the bottom after finishing. Beautiful looking beer.  S: Hands down, best smelling beer I've had. A lot of bourbon, molasses, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, and oak. Incredibly inviting.  T: Kick in the mouth. Bourbon up front, gives way to some toffee and vanilla flavors, with a bitter coffee finish. Really exceptional.  M: Smooth and creamy, reminds me of a whiskey and coke without the carbonation.  D: This is a sipper. I couldn't finish my pint. Then again, this is the highest alcohol by volume beer I've had and probably isn't meant to be drank in pints. Took me about an hour to get through half a pint, but it's really a great beer.  One of my best friends brought this home from Nebraska and had been saving it for a couple of months. We drank it in celebration of a paper I wrote being accepted to be presented at a conference, and it was perfect for the occasion.

Chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a slight hint of dark, over-ripe fruit in the middle. French vanilla ice cream finishes it off, along with some roastiness.  M: Viscous and oily.

1549,10672,pumptrick,4.58,"Well here we go. Bought this 2009 bottle a while ago with a one bottle limit and at the the time it was the most I had ever spent on a bomber at $13. I decided to try this tonight because i have never had it and i am constantly searching for more. This thing has been begging to be popped since I bought it and i realized that i am not going to get anymore. So pour into a nice chalice with vigor. Beautiful black with a nice off white head. Smelling this beauty is not what i was expecting at all. It reminds me of Jewbelation, which i love. I get big dried fruits, chocolate. Some wood and bourbon. Taste follow nose with a hint if not more of copenhagen snuff. A bit too sweet not at all what i was expecting. Very viscous. And pleasing as it coats my tonguel. Glad i had some one to share it with. The search has been finalized, if i find if i will buy if,,. Just dont need the quest anymore.

1549,10672,greenmonstah,4.52,"12 oz bottle into DFH snifter. Bottle 11/12/09  A - Pitch black with almost no head. A tiny wisp of light brown head is present. Alcohol lacing is very prevalent. No head lacing. Very very thick and viscous.  S - Molasses, dark cherry, dark chocolate. Booze and an oakey whiskey aroma.  T - Booze, chocolate, and a bit of bourbon. Flavor comes in three stages, making tasting this beer a real treat. First comes the boozey molasses and whiskey, then a first finish of incredible warm dark chocolate (the best part of the beer is this initial 'finish'), and finally a slightly roasted malt base. finish has a considerable espresso bean note that is just divine. Like chocolate covered coffee beans. I just can't imagine a better tasting stout. A bit hotter when it warms, to its detriment.  M - Thick! Full bodied and a lot of boozy warmth. No noticeable carbonation.  O - This, not KBS, is the perfect Bourbon Barrel Stout. KBS lets the bourbon flavors dominate the stout a bit too much. Meanwhile BCBS allows the stout to be enhanced enormously by the Bourbon barrels. BCBS has a brilliant stout at its base, and is aged in brilliant Bourbon barrels, creating a stout that is simply incredible.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BirdsandHops,3,"A: Pours a very thick, dark black. Even with a rough pour, I only got about a centimeter of milk chocolate-colored head, which quickly vanished into nothing with no real lacing to speak of.  S: Sweet chocolate up front followed by bourbon, alcohol, and toffee aromas.  T: Some sweet chocolate at first which is then overwhelmed by the bourbon flavors. There's some toffee on the aftertaste, but mostly it's just bourbon. The bourbon is not subtle at all and the beer is sticky sweet.  M: Thick body with very little carbonation. The bourbon becomes more apparent as the beer sits in your mouth and it coats your mouth with a sticky layer of malt.  D: Not very drinkable at all. The beer is cloyingly sweet and the bourbon overwhelms all other flavors. I've heard it's better with age, but fresh it's all syrupy sweet bourbon with a bit of toffee on the side.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,GarrettMD,4.32,"A - Color is a black hole. No light escapes this beer. No head to speak of, but alcohol lacing sticks to the side of the glass like glue.  S - Coffee, chocolate, toffee, and alcohol dominate the smell. Molasses is there as well. Sweet smelling, not really a roasted smell.  T - Taste is mostly chocolate, hints of the coffee, toffee, and molasses that were in the aroma but nowhere near as dominant as the chocolate. Chocolate is both sweet and rich dark chocolate flavors. There is a slight burn at the end of the taste.  M - Slightly thinner bodied than I expected but still a heavy thick body. Carbonation is minimally noticeable. Finish is a deep rich sweet chocolate that just coats the tongue for a few minutes after the taste.This beer seems to have a second finish as well which highlights the malt base in the beer with some roasted and chocolate malts.  D - Alcohol is noticeable but doesnt take away from the drinkability. Well balanced beer with some surprising balances of tastes that were not expected at first. Very good tasting beer that I would love to get my hands on more of.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DNICE555,4.8,"On tap at the lazy boy saloon with R Moe Nay on our bourbon county rare racer x diccicio's NY trip.  A - Same as in the bottle... with an even bigger Jimmy Neutron head. Jet black body with a dark tan head. Looks like perfection.  S - Chocolate, malt, booze, coffee. If I walked into a room and found Christina Ricci and Katy Perry fiddling... I would expect it to smell like this. Absolutely heavenly.  T - Big bourbon sweetness. Chocolate, Caramel, a smoky finish to it. I didn't find the tap version nearly as hot as the bottle. This stuff is a  M - Very rich and full bodied. Creamy would be an understatement. Might be the thickest bodied beer I've come across so far on tap.  D - For a 13 percent beer not bad. Def a sipper. Much more drinkable on tap than in the bottle.  Had the ’08 on tap on 4/16/2011 Rattle N Hum in NY. So excited to get to try this one on tap with over 3 years age on it. It is amazing.

1549,10672,ChugginOil,4.4,"This brew pours pitch black with a fingers worth of mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. This big boy has legs that stick. The nose brings scents of bourbon and sweet malt that blast through the senses. The smell of spent coffee grounds seems to mask the booziness pretty well. The taste is best put as ""outstanding"". Sweet malts and bourbon are perfectly blended with coffee tastes that leave an incredibly sensational aftertaste that lingers graciously. This full bodied powerhouse of a stout is rich, thick, and full, leaving behind a quenched thirst and a satisfied palate.

1549,10672,tsatem,4.58,"12 oz 2010 bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to calbertb2 for getting me some of this, as we don't get it down here in Texas and I've been looking forward to it for a long time.  A: Very small head full of tiny, dark bubbles that fades immediately. This thing is pitch black and intimidating. Not a shade of light gets through. Extremely thick and heavy looking.  S: Well, I can smell the bourbon on this as soon as I open the bottle. It is extremely prominent. Once I work my way through that I get some wood and the sweetness works its way to the forefront, vanilla, caramel, fruits. As this warms the fruit aromas really come out, predominantly fig. Following that I can pick up on some bitter chocolate. It's kind of surprising how sweet this smells after the initial bourbon takeover.  T: Wow...this tastes incredible. I'm a huge bourbon fan, and the bourbon transforms this beer in an amazing way. The taste really follows the nose, but everything is multiplied tenfold. There is a definite alcohol presence, predominantly in the finish, that wasn't in the nose, but it's very pleasantly smokey and warming. Perhaps a little bit too sweet for me - the sweet flavors do well to balance everything else, but I feel like they should back everything else up (especially the bourbon) a little more rather than coming to the forefront so much. That being said, this is one of the best (if not the best) tasting beers I have ever had.  M: Wonderful thick and heavy mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation. The beer practically coats the inside of my mouth and stays there for a long time.  D: Though this is most certainly a sipper, the drinkability is phenomenal. After exploring all of the flavors of one sip, the aftertaste lingers for some time, very enjoyably, and just as it's about to fade I can't wait to take another sip. Though I wouldn't want to have more than one of these, one is more than enough to keep me satisfied.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,allforbetterbeer,4.2,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (bottled on 1/14/2010) into a Swiss snifter. Drank 374 days after bottling. Thanks go out to mbusster88 for the trade that incorporated this bottle.  Pours thick and viscous. To cause any turbulence in the pour I had to hold the bottle over foot above my small glass, which still only produced a tiny layer of head, which is itself as dark as some stouts. No highlights whatsoever show when I hold this up to light- darker in fact that used motor oil! Something truly beautiful to behold.  Deep thick dark fruits and charred wood are first to greet my olfactory senses as I inhale the aroma of this brew. If you dissolved molasses in rum and soaked currants, raisins and figs in the resulting syrup, and then left it in the bottom of a charred oak barrel and forgot about it, that would be similar. Squeezing around the sides of those fat aromas are deeply roasted malts and some lighter bourbon-oak notes, incorporating hints of vanilla and nearly black roasted barley.  The nose is one thing, but the flavor goes to a whole new level. I wasn't prepared for this. My mind how has a new reference point for what darkness in beer can be. How can this be so charred and black without being acrid and astringent? I don't know... and I have only had two sips. Onward. Loads of malt fill the flavors, and it is obvious that this is still a beer. Roasted barley is present, but never do any toasty flavors of the lighter malts show through. Neither do hops per se, but their bitterness is obvious. Then to crown all this and to bind it all together is the charred-oak and bourbon. This isn't as blatant as I expected it to be, but is there all the same. A wonderful drying semi-sweet bitterness shows up at the very end, and it reminds me of the smell of freshly ground high quality coffee beans, or maybe high quality very dark chocolate. Noticeably absent is a significant aftertaste, very interesting but not a problem. Dark fruit flavors parallel the nose throughout this whole flavor, and the line between them and the malts is blurry.  Mouthfeel is very thick and coating, but not cloying or syrupy in a negative way. Carbonation is good where it is, and for once I feel it could be higher and I wouldn't mind. I wonder if it has lost any through the screw-on cap...  For this beer drinkability becomes sipability, which is very very good. The alcohol is buried under the astounding flavors, and barely even prickles on the tongue. the only evidence of it is the burning and warming in my chest, similar to a strong red wine.  Conclusion: This is my highest ABV beer to date I believe, and is certainly the thickest and darkest. A truly awesome creation, and one I have waited long to try. I have a 22oz bomber in my cellar, and it will continue to wait there... for I want to put the 5 year claim to the test. Overall this beer is outstanding.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jdg204,4.8,"A long search ended today with me finally getting my hand on GI BCBS! After several trips to Chicago, I finally made my way over to their brewpub in Wrigleyville on the day of the Bears NFC Championship Game appearance to grab one of the holy grails of beer.  A: Jet black with a short mocha head that fades quickly but stuck to the sides a bit.  S: Bourbon, oak, and a healthy amount of dark chocolate and caramel.  T: The bourbon barrel influence shows up early and stays for the ride. It is then joined with the dark chocolate and caramel with a bit of dark fruits as well. It finishes with a pleasant booziness from the bourbon.  M: FULL bodied and thick with a wonderful aftertaste.  D: An excellent stout that I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to try. This is amongst the best barrel aged brews that I've had, clearly one that set the standard. This brew was a nice part of a great day in Chicago with my lovely wife while temporarily joining the local fans cheering for the their Bears in the NFC Championship Game (alas they lost).

1549,10672,BigHeavy,4.87,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a New Belgium globe. Bottle was marked as a 2009 vintage bottled on November 12, 2009. Beer was allowed to warm for about 30 minutes before taking the first sip, a very difficult feat, mind you.  A: Beer pours an incredibly viscous jet black with about a fingers worth of a mocha head, which dissipates into a thin cap, which vanished altogether in the matter of about a minute. For just a bit the beer looks almost like a glass of Pepsi. The completely opaque BCBS leaves no lacing behind as the beer is enjoyed.  S: Aroma is, captain obvious time, heavy on the bourbon, with big notes of vanilla and burnt/charred oak. A heaping helping of dark chocolates and booze are partying in the glass too. Some dark fruits (prunes and dates maybe?) hit me in the back of he throat while taking a deep sniff. Definitely smells sweet. All of these scents explode even more as the beer warms up. It was so complex I had a hard time deciphering some of the scents, but they were all pleasing.  T: Man alive, is this what beer heaven is like? Dark chocolate malts mixed with those prunes (chocolate covered prunes, anyone?) pound into your palate like a ton of bricks. The bourbon element comes on strong as well with the vanilla. It is initially very sweet and boozy. Some burnt oak notes and coffee-like bitterness mix with just a tinge of molasses. I might be crazy but are there some citrus/tropical hops in here too? Finish is again boozy, and there is a lingering sweetness on the tongue. There was so much going on that my taste buds were a little overwhelmed at times. Beer warms the soul, and not just from the booze. I cannot stress how well all of these flavors meld together in a delicious cacophony of beer.  M: Simply the best feeling beer in my mouth ever. Thick, chewy, immensely smooth. In some ways it almost feels like a bourbon and chocolate milkshake in the mouth. Every last inch of the mouth is coated with flavor. Even down the back of my throat is coated. Carbonation is light but present, in a good way.  D: One of the very few problems is the heavy dose of alcohol at 13% ABV, cause it comes on like a major league fastball, warming the tips of the ears in a hurry. Onslaught of flavor can be a little overwhelming on the palate, which leads to longer wait times in between sips. Your body wants another, but it can't handle it.  O: After savoring my way through several bottles of KBS the past few months, I wasn't sure if the bourbon barrel stout category could get any better, but I was wrong. I honestly think BCBS is better in just about every way. I have never had much or liked bourbon itself, but it turns this beer into something special. There may not be a better way to unwind after a long day at work when the temperature falls into the single digits. So glad I finally nutted up and bought a bottle. Thank you Goose Island, thank you.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,billab914,4.84,"Another beer I've had so much of but never sat down to do a review of. It's one of the coldest nights of the year so far here and I just had a craving for some bourbon flavors this evening so I thought it was time to finally do one.  2009 vintage poured from a 22oz bottle into my Portsmouth glass. It poured pitch black in color with a very modest tan head to it. The head retreated to the edges of the glass where it left a little lacing as I drank it.  The aroma is full of bourbon barrel flavors. Oak and vanilla really add a smoothness to the beer overall. The bourbon alcohol flavors provide some nice depth and complexity. The stout comes through and adds some sweetness as well as a bit of some roasty flavors. Everything comes together so well in it. Fantastic aroma overall, and not really anything more that I can ask for in the style.  The taste starts out by showing more of the woody, oak and vanilla flavors to it. the sweetness and bitterness of the base beer come through as well. As you get midway through the bourbon really starts to come through and adds some alcohol heat. The finish has a perfect balance of all the flavors coming together. Sweeter vanilla and oak mix with bourbon alcohol, along with some roasty and bitter stout flavors. Perfect example of how barrel aging can enhance flavors.  The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Pretty much perfect again for the style, the low carbonation really fits the bourbon flavors nicely. The thick and almost silky mouthfeel is pretty much all I can ask for in a big stout as well.  Drinkability is very good overall. I love how all the flavors mix and everything compliments each other nicely. This is the perfect example of a barrel aged beer in my opinion and one I hold all others to as a benchmark. One of the best beers I've had period. Perfect drink for this cold evening.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,waltersrj,4.62,"Pour: Dark black and thick like motor oil. There was an espresso colored one finger head that slowly dissipated into itself and sat near the edges.  Nose: Sweet bourbon characteristics such as vanilla, caramel, and charred oak along with bittersweet chocolate, roasted chocolate malt, loads of sugar, alcohol, and dark fruits that tend towards prunes, figs, and dates.  Taste: Initially a slap in the face of sweet sugars, chocolate malt, and alcohol followed by bourbon, vanilla, caramel, charred oak and slight coconut. This is followed by charred oak, roasted malts, alcohol, and more sugars stemming from the dark fruits.  Mouthfeel: Thick and sludgy, coating the entire mouth. I love the chewy nature of this beast of a beer.  Overall: I have always loved this beer, and every time I have it i revel in it's huge bourbon kick, thick mouthfeel, and the smell as soon as the cap is off. Glad I'm getting coffee and vanilla in a current trade. My vertical later this year will be 09-11 BCBS, BCBVS 10 and BCBCS 10.

There's some moderate runny, soapy lacing going on but nothing that really sticks to the sides of the glass. Looks potent.  Smell: Whoah, big and in your face. Strong notes from the bourbon barrel, some faded coffee, and bitter chocolate.  Taste: Some nice chocolate notes with some faded coffee and an almost smokey kind of roastiness going on, all blended with a slightly boozy bit of bourbon. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation and a nice medium to full body.  Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer. I've shared a bottle of this brew with friends several times in the past, and I have to admit that one bottle can easily be shared between two or three people.

Light carbonation that will disappear after a half hour or so, if you're taking your time.  Nose is boozy and sweet, and it's potent enough to tickle the nasal passages a bit.  The flavor is boozy, as expected. Obvious bourbon flavor. I love bourbon, so while I'm predisposed to enjoy this beer, I'm also hyper-critical. But this brew delivers characteristic bourbon sweetness, and a nice, warm, pleasant booziness. The lack of carbonation is actually necessary here, as too much carbonation would have excessively sharpened up the flavor. If you let this warm over an hour-plus, the bubbles run dry, and the brew resembles a bourbon-chocolate wine, if you can envision such a thing. Awesomeness all around.  Mouthfeel is great, especially because the carbonation is held in check. Perfect density.  Drinkability is great, as long as you take it slow.

1549,10672,bs870621345,4.22,"Compared a 2008 and 2010 bottle. Liked the fresh one better cause of the HUGE smack in the face flavor. 2008 was much more smoothed out and mellow. Review is about 2010.  Pours jet black with a small tan head. Leaves no lacing down the glass and major alcohol feet.  Smells like bourbon, molasses, and hints of roast. Oak is also mixed in.  Tastes like bourbon. Chocolate and molasses are mixed in but predominte bourbon taste.  Mouthfeel is full and heavy, awesome, but not much on the carbonation side. Undercarbonated even for a bourbon barrel stout.  Drinkability is low cause it is really boozy (both the 2010 and 2008).  Its a great beer, but a sipper for sure.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I'm not a Bourbon guy so this is not really the beer for me but I wanted to try it.  M: The bourbon and the alcohol hit the mouth hard. I wasn't ready for it and it knocked my taste buds out.  D: I drank this very slowly. Its got a lot of alcohol in it and the bourbon taste just isn't for me. This is defiantly a sipper. Anyone who loves Bourbon will loves this.  I have a second bottle which I will cellar and try again in a year or two. I heard the Bourbon will mellow out with some more age.

Poured from a 750 ml. bottle from 2009 dated 12/18/09 into a Victory Golden Monkey tulip...  A - Pours a very deep, dark black that forms the smallest fizzy, rich chocolate brown color. The head, whatever there was, quickly recedes to a slight collar.  S - Very woody oak, earthy, bourbon aroma right up front. Very sweet vanilla and booze mixed right in there. Not really much else is noticeable.  T - VERY delicious borubon flavor right out front with sweet vanilla and woody undertones. Some nice dark fruits are also coming out. Some nice coffee and chocolate are in there and they make themselves known at the end of the profile. Nice caramel flavors as well.  M - For how sweet this is, I was expecting a syrupy-like viscosity, but it is really quite the opposite. Very nice and creamy while being heavy bodied and thick.  D - Really awesome beer for the bourbon lovers, like myself. It was still a little hot even after being in the cellar for a year.

1549,10672,Beergeeknut,4.28,Apperance: Poured into a snifter is a dark as dark can be beer with a tan head on top.  Aroma: Bourbon as it was aged in with notes of nutiness wtih a twinge of grain. Dark roasted malts as well. A note of molasses towards the back end.  Taste: This one packs a mean punch upon the first sip of this beast. Somewhat of a smooth mouthfeel with notes of vanilla dark roasted hops and malts as it roams the palate.  Notes: Definately a sipper for a snowy winter night such as tonight nicely drinkable.

1549,10672,denflyr,4.4,"Poured from the standard 22 oz. bomber bottle.  Poured black as night literally! Minimal carbonation on the pour.  Smell...WOW!!! Almond Joy, coffee, Mexican Vanilla, creamy milk/half & half, and almost a currant note as well.  Taste is heavily leaning towards a sugary coffee, heavily roasted malts, and believe it or not almost a citrus finish.  The mouthfeel is all encompassing and completely coats my mouth and has a very long finish!  The drinkability to an extent is my only concern. This is a beer that should be drunk over time and enjoyed. This is a VERY high ABV beer and not meant to be pounded.

A: The beer is a deep black color, with a short brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma contains bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and a touch of alcohol.  T: The taste starts out with a very thick roasted malt character and a strong flavor of chocolate. Then the taste of bourbon barrel aging asserts itself along with a mild alcohol sting. There are background flavors of coffee and dark fruit. The after-taste is sweet.  M: Very smooth and a little crisp but extremely viscous, as heavy body as I've ever experienced in a beer, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.  D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good big stout worth drinking for as long as you can handle it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,broken22,4.85,"I really like this beer. Once you pop one of these open you can already smell the goodness that is about to be poured out. The aging in the bourbon barrels really gives this beer some character most beers will never have. The first sip is nice and light you can feel this beer coat your mouth. My nose lit up once the first sip was swallowed as the beer is pretty fragrant. There is a recommendation that you drink this beer from a snifter in order to fully appreciate the bouquet of smells and I agree.  The color is nice and dark, think motor oil. I did not get a lot of head from the pour. The little head that did form was a nice cream color that died away quite quickly leaving you with this dark abyss. The bourbon really comes though in the taste. You really do not start to appreciate this beer until after you swallow. That same fragrant bouquet you smell in you glass will linger on in your mouth and thats when you can really pick up the bourbon taste. The beer that this one reminds me of is any of the Ola Dubh special reserve series.  I have had this a few times now. The first time I had it I had to convince the owner of the liquor store to sell me one. See during this time they were very hard to find and he had a tiny select batch he was aging for himself and other customers. I finally talked him into selling me one, at a premium, and enjoyed every sip. Now you can get these in 12oz four packs. My initial purchase was a 22oz. My local liquor stores that I frequent seem to be keeping this brand in stock. The running price for this four pack is $20 here in San Diego. I recommended anyone that loves dark beers and can handle the nice taste of bourbon to try this beer out. I am pretty sure you will enjoy it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TKEbeerman,4.42,"A: Poured into my Snifter, this brew pours a black as the Gulf oil spill with a brown head that vanishes as fast as it rose. With some time spent in a barrel, and an ABV of 13% I'm not surprised by the lack of head.  S: The aroma is pure Kentucky Bourbon. The aroma is backed with notes of chocolate and roast, but the Bourbon is so strong and tasty smelling it is literally clearing up my sinuses.  T: The flavor really is a notch above the aroma. I would put it at a 4.8 if I could. The Bourbon is first and foremost present up front and in the rear, but there is a heavy chocolate malt body to this that makes this stout really scrumptious. Notes of caramel and a little coffee are present.  MF: The mouthfeel is just a little too light bodied, which happens in almost every Bourbon barrel aged beer I've had.  D: Drinkability at 13% is almost unprecedented.  Overall, it's like Goose Island took a very very good chocolate stout, and infused a perfect shot of Bourbon in it.

1549,10672,Urbancaver,4.12,Appearance- pours very dark but not pitch black. A bit of head but not much.  Smell- smells great. Bourbony and malty. Smells strong but not too bad.  Taste- very sweet and smooth. A lot of bourbon on the tongue with a bit of biosphere.  Mouthfeel- coats the glass as you drink. Thick and very nice on the tongue  Drinkability- at 13 percent still very drinkable!,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,THECPJ,3.97,"Reviewed from notes 12/5/2010  A: hits the nose hard and fast with the boozey alcohol scent. Hidden somewhere in there, are the vanilla and caramel, but hard to decipher. It's hard to get past the boozey smell!  Ap: pitch black with a small tan head. The head dissipated quickly. This beer is the darkest, most dense I've ever seen! Very tiny bubbles penetrate their way to the top through this thick beer.  B/T: very mild carbonation. The texture is thick, like an elixir. Looking back, would have been better served in a snifter glass, than a pint glass, to appreciate the full-bodiness of it.  Af: lingers on teh tongue, boozey taste is predominant, but you do get some flavors from it. Slight vanilla and thick caramel, almost similar to a molasses.  O: knock your socks off, don't plan on doing anything, and take it slow with this one.  Cheers! The CPJ",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TheFightfan1,4.12,"Got this from a friend at work. Poured into a snifter. Pours an opague black with a thin but strong hold of a brown heading. The heading slowly disappears to a thin edging around the glass. No lacing to speak and kind of flat about a quarter of the way down.  Bourbon was the first thing to hit the nasal passages as soon as the cap was popped.A strong oak aroma with a slight smokey maltiness that peaks it's head through.  As soon as this touches the tongue it numbs it with a bourbon blast.Coats the entire palate and sends a warm tingle to the back of the tongue and into the stomach. A subtle chocolate-oak combination is apparent about mid way through with a slight sting of a bitter hop bite,but is no match for the overwhelming,warming bourbon.  A full bodied beverage with as much carbonation a beer could have with this much bourbon in it. Kind of flat but still very tasty.  This is the definetion of a ""sipping"" beer. I mean my god man I wanted a nice stout with a touch of bourbon and what I got was an all out assault of bourbon. The 13% ABV is not hidden and is in full force but is still not overdone and stays very tasty without being a chore.  Re-tasted 12/3/2013. My how the palate changes over the years. 2013 version is a bit heavier at 15% ABV now. A little less of a bourbon assault then I remember, a much smoother velvety texture and cleaner finish.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

There isn't anything that I'm going to say that hasn't been said in previous reviews.... but:  09 BCS pours a thick, dark stout with a diminishing head. Smell is huge bourbon, roasty, chocolate, a little coffee, malty, and awesome. Taste is very full, bourbon, chocolate malt, vanilla, oak, roast, some sweetness, but finishes with suble bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and coating.

I was craving a Lucky Bastard and walked to the liquor store. They sometimes have some cool beers unbelievably. Anyways, I get there and start talking to the guy who owns the place. Im a patron there so...I digress. He hears what is going down with me and I ask him if he has any Lucky left. He says no, but I have this beer that I cant sell because its a bit too pricey for my clientele. Ok well what is it? Bourbon County Brand Stout....2008! He sells it to me AT COST! 2 CASES!!!! I walk out of there, and it took me an hour to lug it back home lol spending less than 40 bucks! WOW! THANKS TO THE POWERS THAT BE! Now I know it wont get me out of my perdicament but it sure does help ease the pain. Hey I mad a chocolate cake with 2 bottles in the batter and filled it with a cream filling....I sure wish you guys were here!  A: DARK! It looks like used 5 weight  S: roasty and semi sweet, like very dark chocolate; somewhat oaky but subtle.  T: oh how I love that roasted chocolate taste; coffee like and that hint of anise is what makes it pop on the palate!  M: so silky smooth on the front end but that oak-bourbon influence is defintely what bites you backside. Reminds me less of a bourbon and more of a great Cabernet from Cali.

1549,10672,brystmar,4.49,"I first tried this beer on draft at the Clark brewpub when I lived in Chicago in 2007. At the time, I wasn't a big stout fan (that's changed :)) and, although I considered myself a budding beer geek, I really didn't know what I was doing. So when I tried this straight from the tap, I remember enjoying the flavors somewhat but being physically incapable of downing more than a sip or two due to its extreme ABV. Then again, maybe it's just too hot without any age on it. I'll find out again someday.  Anyway, tonight's bottle is from August 2005.  A: jet black and completely opaque with minimal tan head. Strong, sticky lace.  S: Booze. Roasted malt, caramel, smokey oak, sweet aged booze. Awesome.  T: deliciously roasty. Aged boozy malts. Chocolate, oaky goodness, more malt, plenty of alcoholic warmth. Still a touch hot, but much improved over the last batch I tried. The age on this bottle is obvious here and really adds great character to the beer. Quite good overall.  M/D: full-bodied, oily, low carbonation. A pleasant sipper. Much more alcoholic warmth when cold -- this is a brew that really opens up as it sits. This is a must drink for stout-heads.

S - chocolate malt, oaky vanilla, char  T - all of the above plus a little extra sweetness (toasted caramel, we'll say), and a smooth, rounded, boozy quality that really shines in a well aged ale.  M - slick, thick body; coats everything yet slides down effortlessly. Only thing keeping it from perfection is a creamy quality. (Don't want oatmeal in this recipe, much as I like it elsewhere...nitro-tap would be the way to go.)  D - very tasty, surprisingly smooth for a huge stout.

Your olfactory glands are slammed with aromas of vanilla, wet white oak, licorice, bourbon, and heavily roasted malts. Your tongue experiances sweet, and dense malts, backed up by waves of vanilla, chocolate, oaky sweetness, light coffee, and toffee notes and faint, very faint hop balance. Slick = mouthfeel.

1549,10672,wesleyhighley,4.79,"Poured into the glass like a thin, dark brown syrup. Almost no head, but what little there was appeared copper colored and quickly vanished. I get no lacing only some legs that slowly walk down the glass.  From the moment the bottle opened the 13% alcohol tickled the nose and invited a closer smell. Oak, vanilla and alcohol mix together in a wonderful bouquet, very similar to the smell of Sam Adams Triple Bock.  The taste is dead on with the smell, with the alcohol taste fading first, then the caramel and vanilla slipping away leaving a clean, sweet woodsy taste on the tongue.  At more than 2x the strength (and the thickness) of an average stout, this beer will stay in my fridge for those few cold winter nights when I need more than a blanket and a cuddly dog to keep me warm. It is a treat and, at about $5 a bottle in Massachusetts, a great substitute for a trip down to the local pub for a premium brew.  One word of caution - it might be too good for just one bottle.

A: Not the most impressive looking of beers- dark black yes, however little head and rather flat looking. That was the only downside I could find.  S: Nice aromas of vanilla, oak, bourbon and caramel.  T: Wow. This really surpassed my expectations. Incredible balance of malty, caramel goodness, with vanilla, oak, bourbon, raisins to round out the flavors. I could imagine this with a scoop of praline ice cream for a fabulous beer float. I think the flavors even surpass Kentucky Breakfast Stout.  M: Liquid velvet. The alcohol is so hidden you would never know it is there, other than the nice warming it provides to the beer. The beer is so smooth and soft on the palate that I could sip on a glass all evening and not tire of it.  D: This is likely the best bourbon barrel aged stout I've ever had, including KBS which is also pretty darn good. But the beer excels in the overall sophistication of the flavors...perhaps this is due to the aging? I've never kept a KBS around long enough to know how that would taste after a year.

The least sour or bitter of the 3. Aftertaste is smoky, stale, almost moldy and ashy.  Mouthfeel- 3.5 smooth still, but less thick and creamy than the other two reviewed here.  Drinkability- 3.5 The aftertaste makes this more difficult to drink than 07 or 08.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Strong, warm, and boozy aroma of bourbon, oak, and vanilla.  Moderate carbonation and a robust, creamy, ultra-smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol warmth up front with prominent molasses, oak, and a healthy dose of bourbon. Hints of chocolate, vanilla, and espresso as the beer warms. Wonderful lingering finish with a hint of roasty bitterness.  Exceptional beer that drinks great fresh and packs a punch to boot.

1549,10672,Stigs,4.32,"12oz bottle - 2008 vintage stored properly over the year or so I've had it. served in a standard pint glass.  A - pours *very* thick and syrupy, with just a few loose islands of bubbles and a tiny thin layer of khaki colored film. the beer is pitch black. almost lifeless, yet scary.  S - a bit sweet at first, with some dark fruits...plums and figs before the bitter roastiness slowly takes over. boozy all around from the bourbon, yet not dominating. other notes of cocoa powder, toasted nuts, and alcohol finish it out.  T - is this a big beer? no. its XBOX HUGE. flavors just assault the mouth without mercy. the big, bourbon booze actually hits first and takes a fierce stranglehold, letting other secondary flavors pass one by one according to its whim. first, its the dark fruits. then, a wave of sharp, deeply roasted and almost charred malts. finally, more sweetness abounds with the dark chocolate, maple syrup, and molasses. a more true bourbon flavor settles in as everything else dies down.  M - thick, enormous body with just a wisp of tight carbonation which is only noticeable after most of the beverage leaves the mouth. lingering syrupy sweetness, washed clean (as well as it can be) by a noticeable alcohol burn.  D - drinkability takes a hit from its big body and massive alcohol, yet its just delicious. wonderful winter sipper, spend some time and do this one slowly and correctly. a couple years has done some good to this, allowing the booze to come down to a tolerable level and let a few other flavors develop.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Daktyls,4.3,"A: Pours a slick pitch black color with pretty much no head. What little head there is is very localized and clings to a ring around the outside of the glass.  S: Definitely bourbon and boozy smelling. There's a slight bit of coffee on the back end. There's also a bit of roasted malts and a smells similar to a chocolate cake almost.  T: Much like the smell. Definitely a boozy beer that has a lot of bourbon taste to it. Like the smell, there's an interesting assortment of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and in the taste I'm also detecting some light vanilla notes and oak.  M: Whoa. Full bodied like whoa. Smooth with a not a whole lot of carbonation.  D: This beer is delicious, and I would have another, but, I don't want to ruin the specialness of the beer by having another one right away, plus, a few too many of these would probably knock you flat on your butt. But this is an amazing beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,FanofHefe,4.4,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Dark black body with a slight head that dissipates quickly.  Smells like a box of chocolate covered cherries. The bourbon comes through in the aroma, along with chocolate, a hint of roasted malt and a little of a sweet, molasses-like aroma.  Flavor is rich and deep following the aroma. Just enough bitter roasted malt to balance the sweet chocolate and bourbon flavors. It is still much more sweet than bitter, but very rich. Like a rich chocolate dessert.  Very smooth in the mouthfeel with the alcohol pleasantly masked for such a high abv. One of the best stouts I've ever had.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BretSikkink,4.38,"Big ass black stout served in a smallish goblet with a tan head. No much in the way of lacing. If looks could kill...  Strong and powerful aromas, mostly sweet with some roasted notes. Caramelized brown sugar with vanilla bean meets blackstrap molasses barley, topped off with a shot of sour mash.  Sure, plenty of bourbon comes through the flavor, delivered by the inky thick body. The mix of sweetness and alcohol is very apparent and knocks you on the head off the bat. Chocolate fudge with vanilla icing flavors come through the middle, with an aftertaste of oak and the char of an open fire. Hugely malty with a very sweet and chewy finish.  BCS is a damn fine beer, and for the size and overall character, quite drinkable.

1549,10672,BraveUlysses,3.13,"This is an intense beer experience. Jet black pour, with a very slight caramel-colored head. The smell is a warning of the serious flavor that is about to assault your palate: I pick up lots of maple-sweetness and honey, maybe a bit of licorice and the alcohol bite is already evident. This beer wreaks of bourbon.  This beer is aggressive, too. It tastes very much like a whiskey, with a sharp alcohol bite. Without knowing the ABV, I'd guess this is more like a 17 or 18%. That intense bourbon flavor is there, covered in a smokey haze, with some vanilla flavors and then finishes with that sharp alcohol bite and a gulp of maple sugar. At the right temperature (not too cold) this beer enters your mouth with a some viscosity, almost like a thin syrup. A little bit colder and it feels thinner with a bit of carbonation.  For some, this bottle could make for an entire night of drinking; for most others, it's worth a try but one's enough. The label reads, ""One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.""

Appearance: Pitch black like motor oil with a thin half finger of mocha colored head that quickly turns into a ring around the glass.  Smell: Bourbon, chocolate cake, oaky-vanilla and roasted malt.  Taste: Nice bourbon taste mixed with chocolate, roasted malt, oaky vanilla. Very nice!  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and very velvety smooth.  Drinkability: I really wish this was available in PA.

Bourbon woodiness, with heaps of chocolate and dark toffee bread. It is quite the booze bomb, but the roasty quality of the brew really kicks in to pull it out in the end. Smells great.  T: Crushing wave of bourbon, wood, dark roast, chocolate, hint of vanilla (phantom). It is as boozy as the nose suggests, but it manages to push through the considerable heft with a malty goodness.  M: Slick and full bodied. This is a sipper for sure.  D: One is enough. Great beer that is extremely satisfying.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,radioscooter,4.37,"Oh. My God.  The last reviewer did such a good job stating not only his experience - but pretty much mine exactly as well, that I just want to cut and paste his review to double the good vibes. But that wouldn't be kosher so...  As mentioned, the smell sets you up for a pure Bourbon experience but then the taste just kills you dead. I can't drink Bourbon at all. Nor do I drink coffee. But I love the aromas that go with them both. This is Bourbon without the shudder. It's as if you took the experience of having some Maker's Mark with some fine chocolate, then a a little espresso to sober up.  The very obvious 13% ABV reminds you that you need to share this bottle with a friend. Or two. Which, thankfully, I did.  I could not sip this all night, but the mouthfeel is splendid.

1549,10672,Bunkles,4.54,"First review ever. Never planned on reviewing, but this thing didn't give me much choice.  Appearance is the weakest aspect of the beer. Fairly vigorous pour gives about 1 finger head, straight black and opaque. Smell knocked me on my ass. Great bourbon smell that lingers. Mellower than the real stuff. The smell is almost deceiving, as it sets you up for drinking something that just tastes like bourbon. Then comes the taste. My god. This beer is a beautiful blend of a great deep stout, with subtle toasted notes of a deep chocolate. Bourbon comes through beautifully mellow. Mouthfeel is great, this is a beer that really sits on your tongue and just stays beautifully. For a 13% abv beer, it's nowhere neat as heavy as you'd think. Drinkability is surprisingly good for how big this thing is, but it's definitely a sipper. Made the mistake of cracking this bomber myself, first beer I've ever wondered if I could finish myself.  I'd been avoiding this one for a while based on the price, and that won't really be changing anytime soon. $12~ a bomber, $21~ a 4-pack is too rich for my blood, but this is a beer that needs to be tried.

1549,10672,Soonami,3.33,"Shared Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout tonight with a friend while brewing, and I have to say, I am very disappointed with this beer. The beer looked nice, a thick motor oil black, but oddly, even though the beer hissed when opened, there was almost no carbonation. It was entirely way too sweet, it was like sucking a caramel candy while drinking a mocha. The bourbon flavor came on in the end, but it was a bit harsh and overwhelming. The alcohol we very present and the carbonation was too low making this a difficult beer to finish, which makes for a syrupy, boozy mess.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Notes of figs, raisins and licorice on the nose up front. A touch of spicyness and malts at the back.  Taste packs a punch. A lot to chew on here: big flavors from chocolate malts and dried dark fruit in the front to a definite whiskey spiciness on the swallow. Sweet flavors abound: fruitcake, molasses, and a mesquite aftertaste.  Syrupy mouthfeel, like most beers with this high abv. It's fine in the mouth, but it sort of slides down your throat, which I guess I'm just no used to, but it's a touch off-putting.  This is a one-and-done beer. Lowe drinkability due to the high abv, and the abundance of flavor. Save this one for a special occasion, have it after dinner with a cigar, or cellar it.

T: Lots of alcohol and really everything that was noted in the smell. The beer also has an oak flavor. A lot more chocolate and coffee than in the aroma. A little bit of spicy flavor.

1549,10672,TheBrewo,4.84,"Per the suggestion of the bottle, we pour this thick, pitch-black brew into our snifters. The head is brief, but is of the color of rich milk chocolate. Dainty lacing appears as you sip. Diacetyls infiltrate the nostrils, giving the impression of a freshly toasted English muffin smothered in butter. Malts are also heavy, and roasted. The bourbon barreling adds to the aroma, and the associated alcohol is strong. The flavors take off like a runaway freight train!! Sweet, smooth roasted malts hit up front. These continue into the middle, where they are met with a smoky bourbon burn. Again, these mix, and lag to the finish, where they are subsequently joined by a woody flavoring and a sweet coffee flavor. The latter pleasantly dominates the aftertaste, which also has a fairly strong alcoholic component to the breath. The beer is full bodied with light to medium carbonation. The feel is slick, smooth, and impossibly creamy. Thanks to the 13.00% abv there is a huge warming character to each sip, which also makes this one you take your time with.  Overall, this was a fantastic find!! What we enjoyed most about it was the inherent complexity to the flavors, which find such an intricate and intimate balance and smoothness. This expert blending of such robust flavors and aromas, and the unique impregnation from the barrel aging, make this beer of an outstanding quality, placing this brew apart from its competitors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

My bottle doesn't look like what is pictured above, but I still believe this is the appropriate review for this beer.  A: Completely dark, poured like syrup, with virtually no head on the pour despite a vigorous splash for the last 3rd of a glass. A 2008 bottle might be a little low on Carbonation....  S: Wow. Huge smell of chocolate syrup and rich, sweet Bourbon. I've never smelled this particular combination in a beer before... I'm officially *intrigued*.  T: Another ""wow"". Huge flavors of sweet sweet chocolate... the high alcohol content (13%) gives this guy a *spice* that gives it similarities to a good, rich Brandy. Toffee like flavors and a hint of caramel on the finish. This guy is sweet, then roasty, then warm and syrupy as the taste moves through with each swallow.  M: Despite the age, I think the spice and alcohol still gives this beer a light tingle in the mouth. The finish is syrupy and thick.  D: I think drinkability is the most subjective of the 5 categories... For me, I always judge ""drinkability"" by how easily the bottle goes down, and if I'd like to have another one of the exact same thing right after it, the next day, ect.  That's where this guy really struggles for me. It had an amazing nose, and it just explodes with rich, sweet, and spicy flavors in your mouth. And for that it merited big scores for smell, taste, and mouthfeel. The first 3-4 ounces were awesome. But over time, as I worked through the glass, this just became a chore for me to finish. It's got a BIG sweet/spicy flavor... just so much so that it's not terribly drinkable.

T- Mashed grains all over again with an alcoholic warmness to it. A little chocolate there, as it warms it becomes more noticeable...taste is transforming to that of a kit-kat bar.  M- Feels more like a liquor than a beer, warms the mouth and throat mightily on the way down. Boozy aftertaste lingers.  D- The nature of this beer means that it won't be extremely drinkable, but it is definitely enjoyable. I may have started mine a little too chilled as it gained complexity as it warmed up a touch.

No lacing on this one.  Smell- I take a big whiff and get a smell of aged bourbon which has calmed down over a year in the cellar. You get three main smells in this, the boozy bourbon, chocolate and espresso and some malts.  Taste- Wow so smooth and complex. Its a big drinking stout and it lets you know it but doesnt go for the throat. The front you get some or most of the main flavors but when you swallow you come away with the bourbon flavors.  Mouth- Full bodied with a well balanced profile. No carbonation so the thickness of the beer and the flavors really allow you to savor it.

There were deep, dark ruby highlights near the outer edge/surface after the head faded. The aroma was unmistakable, noticeable from across the table (confirmed by my wife). Upon getting my nose in the glass, I was greeted with an orgy of scents. Bourbon and oak of course, but vanilla, roasted malt, sweet sugars, dark fruits and booze.  The flavor didn't disappoint. Two years in the bottle hasn't diminished the chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, vanilla and general roasty flavor in this beer. The bourbon flavor isn't at all overwhelming, and the age has mellowed the burn from the alcohol quite a bit. This beer really coats the inside of your mouth as you drink it, in a very pleasant way.

1549,10672,zhanson88,3.97,"Appearance: This is among the thickest looking stouts on the pour that I have tried. There is a slight amount of dark tan head that forms during the pour, but it quickly reduces down to almost nothing. This beer looks pretty good from a thickness standpoint, but the lack of retention and lacing is disappointing.  Smell: As soon as I start pouring I can smell hot bourbon wafting up. This is the 2010 version so that's not surprising. There is roasted malts, bitter chocolate and espresso coming up in waves, but it is all overlayed by that sweet boozy bourbon smell.  Taste: Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee up front. Lots of boozy bourbon on the back end. The roastiness and the booze stood out to me much more than anything else. I'm a fan of bourbon so I liked it, but I usually look for more balance than I found here.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very full bodied, one of the heaviest bodied beers I've tried. There isn't a lot of carbonation and it leads to a slick mouthfeel that is pretty good. Could use a touch more carbonation. This is a 13% ABV beer and definitely a sipper, but it's a good one.

1549,10672,ColdPoncho,4.53,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a stemmed Goose Island wide-mouth wine glass.  Dammit, I screwed up the pour - no head. It's hard to remember what the shape of my glass is. I've seen it before though, and its quite dark brown, kind of intimidating. The beer is, in fact kind of scary. It's just so dark...no light comes through it. Any light that goes near it is even sucked in. The surface, with a few clinging groups of bubbles has a very thick look to it. It looks like you could stand a chance of walking on it. This also might be the only beer I've seen with legs (as in wine).  The smell on this is big - including bourbon, raisins, alcohol chocolate, and wood notes, pretty much in that order.  I simply love the taste of this beer. I wish I could give it a 4.9. It's got the bourbon and booze, which are powerful, but its nicely balanced and smoothed out by a creamy sort of raisiny, chocolatey kind of woody toasted bread thing. It's complex and subtle. Can't wait to open another in a few years.  Mouthfeel is huge and smooth and creamy. Brilliant - again I'd like to give it a 4.9.  I could easily get carried away drinking this. But it's just a bit too strong to be very drinkable.  I really think this is a fantastic beer, and in some categories, I've only rated it below a five because it's not as good as Rum Barrel Aged Oil of Aphrodite which incinerated my socks off when I had it about a month ago. I think it's a fair fight, though.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Huhzubendah,4.7,"On draft at Churchkey in D.C.  I decided to re-review this beer upon having it on draft and in the bottle this weekend, after not having it for the better part of a year.  A: Deep black with a half inch of beige head that hangs out for several minutes, leaving some good lacing on the tulip glass. A much different and improved presentation from the bottled version.  S: Alcohol, roasted malt, bourbon. The aroma is huge and detectable from several feet away.  T: This is a big, rich beer, with a potent dose of bourbon, alcohol, and roasted malt. Wonderfully delicious chocolates also make up a large portion of the flavor. I find it to be very enjoyable and well done. The 13% abv is definitely evident in the nose and the taste, but the beer is so well crafted, the flavor doesn't come across as hot, just robust and powerful.  M: The carbonation level is spot on, which is another notable improvement over the bottled serving. The feel is sticky, sweet, viscous, and chewy with a rich roasted malt and alcohol finish that lingers for a good while between sips.  D: The sweetness and high octane nature of Bourbon County Stout make this a great choice for sipping on a cold winter night, which is exactly what I did. While this is a nice brew I enjoy on occasion, I am satisfied with a small serving.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ewright,4.24,"EDIT: Just realized this is review #150 ... not planned, but an interesting brew for the milestone.  2009 vintage poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter, 6 oz at a time. The beer pours inky black, as I'd expect, but there is absolutely no head ... a bit disappointing and reflected in my score for appearance. I wonder if the combination of aging and those stupid screw-top lids had anything to do with the low carbonation level, or if that is typical for BCBS.  The beer may not look impressive, but it sure makes up for it in the aroma! Super strong oaky vanilla notes dominate up front with a decent hint of bourbon and dark roasted grain in the background.  On first sip, dark chocolate, vanilla, and mild oak are obvious up front. There's a hint of dark fruit hiding back there ... maybe a plum/prune note? There's still a pretty obvious alcohol bite at the end ... maybe another year of aging would temper that?  Due to the low carbonation, this one slightly cloying, but not overwhelming. I'd like a bit more CO2 prickle on the tongue, but this is close. Overall, it's been a challenge to take it slow. I love whiskey and bourbon, so this beer keeps calling me back for another sip. However, I'll definitely have to share the bomber of 2009 I still have in the closet! Oh wifey dear...",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate - in that order  T - Oh, this is great. Bourbon and chocolate really dominate - hard to pick up on the alcohol. More sweet than bitter, but great balance.  M - Among the thickest beers I've tried. Borders on motor oil (in a good way)  D - I could get really carried away as it's easy to put down, much too easy for the abv.

M - thick, rich, and syrupy like with little to no carbonation.

Bottled on date of 10/15/2010  Appearance: Pours black with a minimal brown head that dissipates quickly yet leaves behind a ring of lace around the top of the beer.  Smell: Dark chocolate smell is the most prevalent, backed up by a certain degree of roastiness, dark fruits, and a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Begins sweet, primarily tasting of chocolate, plum and maybe even some grape. Finishes with a lot more bittersweet chocolate and a roasted character, along with alcohol. As it warms, bourbon can be noticed throughout the beer.  Mouthfeel: Thick body with light carbonation and a sticky finish. The alcohol in this brerw is definitely noticeable- I felt a slight burn on my lips on the first sip, and chills run down my spine as soon as the beer touches my lips and there is a slight burn as it goes down. Despite this, the alcohol is not overpowering or unpleasant. Also, I am guessing this feeling has something to do with the bourbon barrels, as something similar happens to me when I drink whiskey.  Drinkability: A superb and very complex beer. The alcohol, though is such that this is a definite sipper.

There is so much going on in this beer. I get the bourbon up front and the vanilla and coffee follow. You also get the bitter hops, the oak barrels, its incredibly multi-layered.

Whatever it is, its more pleasant than deterring.  Overall: World class is the only way to describe this beer. Its just super complex and tasty. Everything in this beer comes together smooth and perfect. This is just a beast of a beer and a true classic. Must try!  P.S.

Around the edges there is barely any light shining through but what does break though displays a bit of brown clarity. A thin film of dark tan head appears and rapidly dissolves with audible fizzing. Very faint spotty lace clings to the glass with swirls that release carbonation but still fail to formulate a head.  The aroma of this brew is a pleasant blend of bourbon and vanilla. There are some woodsy suggestions of the oak aging process throughout the profile. The dark scent of the grain comes across with burnt notes lightly suggesting chocolate and coffee but these are quite subtle compared to the bold presence of bourbon and vanilla.  The taste of this brew is bold with a forceful kick of bourbon heat right upfront. The taste of the alcohol is somewhat solvent with a tangy bite partially influenced by some hops. The dark grain leaves a persistent bitterness like strong coffee and dark bitter chocolate that lingers in the mouth. The barrel aging influence is evident with some dry woodsy flavors that blend with the burnt grain aspect and turn to a more mellow vanilla smoothness that suggests dark caramel or toffee.  This is a full bodied brew that at times seems lighter just because of the sheer evaporative quality that this brew has inside your mouth. It is acceptably light in carbonation and is a mighty fine sipper on a cold night. This brew is a savage beast and I really like it. At 1 year old, it hasn't even touched a fraction of it's aging capacity and tastes strikingly similar to a 3 year old bottle I recently had.

Little dark khaki head that goes away quickly. Just traces of it around the edge.  S: Lots of bourbon gives it some nice caramel and vanilla notes. I can't pick up much else through it but the big bourbon is one of the things I love most about this beer.  T: This one has gotten even better throughout the year and is drinking great right now. Still a surprising amount of bourbon heat at first, but it gives way to some wonderful flavors. Goes from vanilla to caramel, some hints of dark fruit followed by some rich dark chocolate.

Nose is fantastic - chocolate and bourbon gettin' it on. Taste is right in line with the nose, mouthfeel is smooth and easy going down. Very little heat on this year-old bottle, but the ABV will catch you off guard if you're not wise.  Very special to have a great beer from a great city (my dad's hometown).

Chocolate hits on the front of your palate followed by an alcohol bite and smooth aged bourbon. On the back end I get a quick bitter malt sensation. After-taste leaves an decadent vanilla chocolate flavor. Mouth feel is creamy and coats the tongue. Not too viscous and little carbonation. I would love for some more bitter coffee/cocoa flavor in this beer. Too much milk chocolate. Maybe that's why the coffee version is so good.

Head is very thin, I can only see a faint brown ring of foam on the sides of my glass. As I swirl it in my glass I also make note of very fine brownish bubbles coming up.  Aroma is very strong with plenty of bourbon/oak, vanilla and some booze. I also detect a bit of dark fruits.  Taste is also extremely strong starting very sweet with dark/roasted malts and mollasses flavors. This is followed by plenty of dark fuit notes (plums, raisings, figs) and the extremely pleasant bourbon and vanilla explosion. Aftertaste is very persistent with the same oak notes and also some coffee.  This beer is extremely heavy and takes a while to drink. Mouthfeel is very liquorous and sticky. I'm amazed by the quantity of malt in this beer. Carbonation is very high as is the alcohol bite towards the end, specially after the beer gets a little warm.  This beer is easily comparable with the best of the style ( Founders CBF, Oak Aged Dark Lord and Oak Aged Stone Imperial Russian Stout come to mind) BUT it is way more easier to find. My only criticisms is that the alcohol levels are too apparent hurting a lot its drinkability and complexity.

Beer pours black, head is beige-brown, and aroma blasts the nose with bourbon, hot alcohol, and chocolate. After swirling, the alcohol gets even hotter on the nose, and a touch of molasses comes out to say hiii.  Taste. If you like chocolate, you'll LOVE this beer. Loaded with chocolate. The bourbon is wonderful, and the alcohol is very hot. Also tasting maple. These are the only ingredients I can find, but I emphasize that the chocolate is what ties the whole room of flavors together.

One whiff of this beer and you can tell it was aged in bourbon barrels. When I first poured it, it smelled like straight-up whiskey. After letting it sit for a while it smelled more like coffee and chocolate.  It taste just like it smells... Delicious. I was a bit surprised by the alcohol on the first sip, but just like the smell, after it sits for a little it's easier to taste the coffee and chocolate in the beer.  It has a pretty good mouthfeel, it's about what you would expect from a stout. Not too thin, not too thick. nothing too special  This is a beer that took me a while to drink.

1549,10672,zumicroom,2.45,"2010 batch, poured in a duvel tulip  being a lover of imperial stouts and having read about this beer for going on 2 years now, i was excited enough to see it in my local shop to ignore the $22/4pk price and pick some up.  i also knew going in that i was probably going to hate the first bottle and would have to age the other 3 for at least a year before trying again.  that is exactly what happened. fresh, this beer is a big, hot, bourbon-y mess. it is like someone spilled quite a lot of bourbon into my delicious imperial stout. now i don't hate bourbon. i will drink it on occasion. i just don't love it either.  a splash of bourbon would be wonderful; subtle, hinting on the nose and the finish. the amount here overwhelms. i literally had to cover my glass with a coaster while not drinking because it smelled like a bourbon spill in the living room. i drank maybe 1/3 of the bottle over 2 hours and eventually gave up and poured $4 worth of beer down the drain.  anyway: the beer is quite nice to look at, black with dark tan head, but it isn't really any nicer than any of the other impy stouts i've tasted.  the smell is like a glass of bourbon in front of you and they guy next to you has a glass of really roasty stout. powerfully boozy and frankly unpleasant.  the taste was 7/10 awful and 3/10 delicious. i had some 2010 night stalker the night before and was amazed that an 11.7% beer hid it's alcohol so well. this was the same in some ways but also quite different. the actual alcohol was not very present, it warmed a bit but did not burn like one would expect from a 13% beer. on the other hand, the main flavor of this beer is bourbon and tastes very alcoholic. it sort of has the taste of alcohol without the feel of alcohol. i clearly don't really know how to explain it. once the booze hit passes, a delicious roasty, almost chocolatey undertone shines through before being swallowed up by the still bourbon-y aftertaste.  i can see what this beer wants to be, what it can and will be with some years on it. there is an amazing stout underneath all of that over-the-top bourbon character. is it so wrong to want my beer to taste of beer and my liquor to taste of liquor?  the mouthfeel is exactly what i want from an imperial stout, viscous and coating, oily and velvety. spot on.  as for drinkability, well, this drinks like viscous, velvety bourbon. it doesn't go down easy and you wouldn't expect it to or probably want it to.  so there it is. my slanderous review of a top 25 beer. gotta go big for that first one, right?  this was a weird beer for me. i wanted to love it, i still want to love it, i still may well love it. but we are not right for each other yet, we both need to mature a bit. she needs to calm down and i need to loosen up. we have agreed to try again in a year and see where that takes us.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A non-issue really, as the overwhelming aromas begin to fill the glass. Translucent at the hithermost netherregions only.  Smell is utterly insane. An almost violent flume of oak literally drenched with chocolaty bourbon. Seriously volatile. This may be the first aroma I've encountered that has its own texture. Almost coarse on the nose. Inviting, in an uncompromising sort of way.  This is one thick beer. Worlds more dense than Parabola, Older Vis, etc. Can it support such density? Dude, of course. A mild and pleasant carbonation calls this beer its home. But I'm having to be careful. As a chronic gulper, I'm used to relative non-restraint with most big sippers. Right now however, I'm essentially reduced to a duality of awe and trepidation that I'm supposed to drink 12 oz of this stuff by myself. Oh shit- am I supposed to talk about taste?  Okay, you know what carob tastes like? Almost like a piece of chocolate if you had to dig it up from underneath a gnarled piece of oak. This hits with a spicy alcoholic edge tempered by the woody, vanillin notes. Finishes lo-o-ong with whatever else you like to pour upon your ice cream.

1549,10672,infi,4.84,"2008 vintage, 64 oz. growler. Shared with BAs johnjae and r0nyn.  Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Refer back to my bottle review, as the appearance, mouthfeel and drinkability are basically identical. The most notable aspects of this BCS, in comparison with the bottled 2008 vintage, is mainly found on the nose and on the palate.  On the nose, the 13% ABV is COMPLETELY absent, which was very surprising to me, considering it was the first scent to hit me when I originally had it from the bottle. This batch of beer must have been from early 2008, as there wasn't a hint of any alcoholic burn in the nostrils. Next, were the biggest emergent characteristics of milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla and toffee - all immaculately resonating with this sweetness. I've never held my nose inside my glass for this long and at frequent periods. Goose Island really needs to make a scented candle of this recipe; it's ridiculous. If you let it warm for more than 20 minutes, the glass really starts smelling like soy sauce, but that's neither here nor there.  On to the taste. The bourbon is the first greeting, but it's immediately mellow and not harsh or biting. Same ol' amounts of chocolate and malt throughout as well. The biggest change for me from this growler was the liveliness of the finish. One word: butter. And not in a diacetyl-type of way like a dirty tap line, but rather more of a creamy and sweet butteriness. The vanilla notes from the barrels and candied-caramel really shine on the palate as well and considerably more than the bottled version.  Just mind-blowing on how a few months more of some subtle aging can create an even bigger monster of a beer than it already was. Not bad for my first growler!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

You don't have to sniff too much before being generously greeted with aromas not normally thought of from beer. It's smells super thick and roasted with hints of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak and malt. It even has a slight syrupy aroma from the high alcohol content.  It coats the tongue like olive oil, but far better tasting. This fist sip will have a mild shock from the 13% abv, but another sip or two and your taste buds will be ready. They will taste everything your nose sensed and more. This is where you can pick up the characteristics of being aged in barrels formally used for bourbon...vanilla and oak.  Since the first time I had it, this beer has been one of my favorites so I thought I'd use it to start doing beer notes on Facebook. If you come across it, I highly recommend picking one up. Please keep in mind, this is a very heavy and strong beer. I recommend sipping it at about 54-58 degrees. Also, of the eight or so I've had, the best one was just over a year old. It says on the bottle that it can age up to five years, but I have yet to have the patience.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,r0nyn,4.67,"Poured from a growler into my DFH snifter. Courtesy of and shared with fellow BA infi. Also shared with BA johnjae. Vintage of 2008.  Pours the typical dark, dark blackness of imperial stouts. Completely opaque with a thin tan head that leaves a lot of sticky, spotty lacing. Still as enticing as ever. Smell is full of ohymyGodIdontknow... so many different aromas swirling around. Big dark cocoa transitioning into sweet, silky chocolate, clean, pure vanilla, creamy toffee, pleasingly bitter coffee, with a touch of bourbon warmth at the end. Jeez, is this a completely different beer from the bottled version? Color me impressed.  Big chocolate taste to start, with very prevalent coffee and vanilla nuances. Wow. I don't know how, but this seems vastly different from the bottled version. The booziness is tempered very well at colder temperatures, mingling with the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla to create a balanced flavor profile that's ridiculously tasty. On the back end, there's a distinct taste of buttermilk(?!) that rides into the aftertaste. With a bit of warmth, the bourbon shows up as expected, but still harmonizes very well with the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and delicious, having an almost silky texture. Body isn't the thickest I've had, but is just the right consistency. Somehow, it feels ten times better than the bottled version, which was already pretty good to begin with.  Drinkability is very, very dangerous. Enthralling smell, complex and nuanced taste and a velvety viscosity, I could definitely have a lot of this, which is scary.

The vanilla version is sort of like drinking a unicorn, so the regular version is maybe... horses running through fields of poppies?  Either way, the rich and dark appearance pours nearly pitch black with little head. It stays with even less, sitting there in your glass like pitch. Great legs though. And the smell is unbelievable. Bourbon fills the nose. Also there's chocolate and coffee. The taste is out of this world, and probably the best part about it. Dark chocolate, coffee, figs, malts, and only a hint of bourbon in the taste up front. The rest of the swallow you're left to remember it by smell. The booziness is more and more present as it warms.  Without question it fills the mouth, and this one is as drinkable as you can handle the 13% abv.

Very mellow after-taste. The high ABV is only barely perceptible and is well-matched to the strong-ish flavor. Flavor is the name of the game here.

Quite a good value when you consider that one of these babies is equal to two or three normal strength beers, but it blows just about anything else you could call beer away if you enjoy such an extreme amount of rich bourbon / chocolate flavor.

Pitch black, into a goblet, with a thin and wispy dark tan head. A thin sheet of lace is broken in spots by a few diminutive dots.  Smell is an intense and complex combination of ripened cherries, oak, bourbon alcohol and milk chocolate. Tastes initially involves notes of bourbon quickly followed by notes of oak, figs, cherries, vanilla, cocoa, milk chocolate and an ending of bitter dark chocolate.  Heavy mouth-feel, but creamy and viscous going down.

Very thick black and smooth out of the bottle and created a one finger brown head which stood for a fair amount of time. I was surprised that there was almost no lacing to speak of for such a sticky sweet beer.  The aroma is huge on the bourbon which i love. There were hints of oak for sure, tons of vanilla (curious to see how much more vanilla they can add for the special release), some coffee notes, plenty of roasted malt but its hiding out behind the bourbon.  Flavor is much of the same and the first few sips break in your mouth for the complex ride its on. First thought is I am surprised by how carbonated it is for such a high ABV - much more so than some of the similar strengthed RIS.  If not for the lack of lacing on my glass and the slightly over carb - could be all 5s.

1549,10672,NittanyBeerFan,4.37,"A 12 oz bottle of the 2010 vintage received as an extra in a recent trade. Poured into a snifter out of the screw-top (huh?) bottle. The bottle opens with a pop, and gunsmoke streams out of the mouth.  Color is completely opaque black, but surprisingly, the texture doesn't look thick and syrupy. No bubbles form upon the pour, but a little wispy swirl does form later.  The aroma is complex, but somewhat overwhelmed by heat from the still young beer's time in the fresh bourbon barrels. There is a dominating (aside from the heat) aroma of bourbon accompanied by, in order, aromas of dark fruits, oak and vanilla from the barrel aging. The heat mellows significantly on the palate, as plums and dates take the front of the flavor profile. Caramel, toffee, vanilla, and oak follow, along with the extremely present bourbon notes. This is more balanced than I remember the 2007 being. That one was a bourbon bomb. This is a well-balanced stout.  Smooth, medium to full in consistency, with just about no coordination. Goes down smooth as hell, and is thoroughly enjoyable, but the fact that I am buzzing a bit after a half bottle makes me knock the drinkability.

The smell is lots of oak and some bourbon to boot the boozy fumes aren't too bad, but I kept it colder so who knows if that might be the reason why. There is a nice chocolaty aroma as well as some butterscotch and raisin. The flavor is quite bourbony with some oak, raisin and hints of cocoa in the back. This beer could use a year to mellow out, but it is still a really good beer. This is too boozy to drink right now, some time to mellow would be fantastic.

1549,10672,LairdChisholm,4.64,"A - Probably the blackest Stout I've ever seen. This pours a jet black color with dark, chestnut brown around the edges. The dark mocha colored, less than one finger head, fizzled up and died down very quickly leaving only a little film around the edges. This has very light lacing, but this Stout is so thick that after i take a sip the side of my glass stays brown for a while because the Stout takes so long to flow back down.  S - Smelled this one very strongly when I poured it, and could keep smelling it for as long as I drank it. This smells very strongly of bourbon, dark chocolate, and burnt malts. Very strong and it almost reminded me brownie batter.  T - I was drinking this with my parents and grandparents. I passed my glass along and it was priceless to see their reactions after they took a sip considering the were all drinking Miller Lite and MGD 64. The bourbon is most apparent at the beginning and at the end and the alcohol is most warming at those times too. In the middle, it is more complex then I thought it would be. Roasted malts lead the way but are mixed with notes of molasses, maple, vanilla, chocolate (both dark and milk), and maybe a touch of oak. This is an experience right here and worth every penny.  M - Perfect. Heavy and smooth and goes down with ease. Very sticky and chewy. Makes you work for every sip but it's a labor of love.  D - This is the ONLY part where this stout suffers. There is maybe a wee too much alcohol in this. It is fine when you start but when you get to about when you have a fourth left in your glass, the bourbon becomes overwhelming. This is still an incredible Stout and I would highly recommend it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

No head, no lacing, no carbonation.  Smell: Beautiful! Creamy, high-quality chocolate; molasses and burnt sugars. Bourbon and booze. Smoke. Barrel aromas, it transports me to a dark cellar in an old ship departing the British Empire circa 1835.  Taste: Sweet chocolate upfront, some faint bitterness at the end. More booze and whiskey (bourbon) throughout. Some vanilla bean, straight from the pod.  Mouthfeel: Very chewy, thick, pure petroleum. Heavy. No carbonation but full body. Lingers in the mouth after sipping.  Drinkability: Good for the style, but a little cloying. I like that the booziness is not overbearing, though. Never too hot.  I love Goose Bourbon because I love bourbon beers, but whereas I used to think this was the Holy Grail of the style, I have now found many other similar beers I like just as much (Odin's Tipple, Bourbon Stone RIS).

After smelling this multiple times I keep liking it more and more so I ended up bumping up the score as it is boarderline perfect score.  T - Definitely a strong bourbon flavor (probably doesn't hurt that this was bottled 20 days ago) gives this beer a kick. Some roasted barley, but nothing overly bitter or really roasted. Strong dark chocolate with a good amount of fudge like flavor. Definitely has an oaky and vanilla flavor, but no real smokiness. Slight burnt molasses and caramel provides a slight sweetness.

D - Definition of a sipper. That said, given the ABV and strong bourbon aspect, I would love to drink this again later (not right away obviously). Great mouthfeel and tasty and complex taste makes me crave more. Alcohol is strong (see sipper).  Notes: Vintage 2010 bottled on 10/15/10. Wonderful beer. Strong bourbon aspect.

I will say before even reviewing, I am definitely going to age my bottles for a while after having this. It's much less in your face, yet still very tasty.  A: Jet Black, small tan head. Not much carbonation to see, leaves some lacing.  S: Obvious woody bourbon notes, lots of malt, charred malt, vanilla, the age is there in the raisin/prune notes that are reminiscent of old barleywines. I like the cellared version of this awesome stout aroma.  T: Matured wood and oak flavors with the huge malt backbone and bourbon sweetness and slight burn. Dark Chocolate and Vanilla, great balance. This is a great, great beer with age, it's just really balanced and mellowed even compared to the 2009.  M: Creamy, coating, what more do you want?  D: Much tastier and drinkable with age. Excellent, yet still too boozy to attempt taking too much down by yourself.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,boomer31,4.49,"Finally had a chance to review. Had the 06, 07, 08 and now reviewing the 09 version.  A - Pours black with no light coming thru the edges. No head only deep brown bubbles floating on top.  S - Big bourbon and chocolate and not much else. I have loved this beer really for that reason...pronounced bourbon.  T - Just like the nose a rich chocolate and bourbon flavor. Hints of vanilla (very slight) from the barrel only as it warms. The chocolate really lingers as does the surprising amount of sweetness.  M - Rich and full bodied. This is really what I look for in big stouts.  D - At 13% nobody will be able to drink a full bomber of this. I'm working on a 12oz bottle and that should be good for the night. Nonetheless this is a sipper that is just beautifully balanced.  One of my favorite stouts and because its always readily available I just love having it in the fridge. Great work here",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BillHilly,4.82,"Appearance: Nice obsidian translunce when pouring, excellent 3 finger lacing.  Smell: Mild vanilla, and bourbon finish.  Taste: Starts with a mild vanilla, then a sweet malt with a bourbon final note - very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Very similar to the high end quads, mild carbonation, creamy, and easy to consume.  Drinkability: Simply an amazing stout...one of the best around. Special beer for special occasions.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dnolan36,4.4,"Received this beer recently as an extra in a trade.  Poured it into my Duvel tulip. Poured the darkest brown, almost jet black into the glass. What head was there was a very thin, light brown head that quickly disappears.  After I poured there beer I could smell it from several feet away. When I got closer I could smell oak, vanilla and bourbon. To me it smelled like a port wine.  The taste was a very sweet and malty. I could also taste the obvious bourbon as well as faint dark chocolate and maybe a hint of molasses.  The taste was very nice. Low carbonation and it coats your mouth as you drink it. This is more evident when you swirl the beer in your glass and it leaves a brown film on the glass that slowly recedes.  The drinkability of this one is high. It is definitely one to sip on and not to rush. It is something that I could find myself drinking often if I had access to it. It also would be very good for a nice night cap.  Overall this beer has lived up to all the hype that surounds it. It is overall a very well balanced stout and I cannot wait to get some more so I can age it and try it again in a few years.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,AgentMunky,4.49,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a wine glass. 2009 vintage.  A: Slightly fizzy on the pour, but the light brown head barely lasts. The surface of the beer is disturbed by tiny bubbles rising up from hidden depths. The colour itself is of the darkest brown, verging on black, and completely opaque. Impenetrable even at the edges.  S: I smelled this one from miles off. The obvious aromas hit first -- vanilla, oak, caramel, and, of course, bourbon. Deeper scents abound, however, including licorice, molasses, salt water taffy, and faint cacao or coffee bean. The sheer force of this smell is breathtaking, to say nothing of the complexities of the aroma.  T: I have been anticipating this moment for months. Hmm...Hm...Whether or not I'm disappointed, this is one monumental flavour. Molasses is most immediately obvious, a bit salty. This sweetness is definitely bourbon-based; the punchiness from the alcohol makes that fact unforgettable. Rolling over the tongue, hints at wood, chocolate, coffee, and anise emerge. The aftertaste lingers on, sweetish and tantalising, with just the right amount of bitter coffee. Personally, I didn't detect any smoke in the taste, but maybe I've been drinking too much Islay whisky. I can certainly see how smoke would enhance the flavours. My only 'complaints' are that the alcohol may be a bit *too* strong, and I find the salty licorice flavours to be odd, if not out-of-place. Still, a phenomenal effort.  M: Thick, syrupy, but with a startling carbonation. Smooth, warming, quirky. Keeps you on your toes.  D: If you can drink this beer, do so. That said, I will not be picking one up for quite a while. Beyond the fact that they're pricey (when you can find one), this is a beer that will not tolerate familiarity. Absolutely drinkable, but I can't see myself needing an entire bottle. Pick one up with a good friend and split it.  Notes: If you swallow too hastily and this stout hits you in the back of the throat, it feels like bourbon. Take this as you will, but it's points in my book.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bay01,4.17,"2010 Vintage from 12oz bottle  A - Poured into a snifter, color is onyx with no head to speak of and no visible carbonation.  S - Smell is of chocolate, some vanilla, and alcohol  T - Taste is chocolate and a suprising amount of vanilla (this is not the vanilla BCS), also some fresh tobacco. Since this was just released it is on the hot side but the alcohol is not overwhelming to the overall taste. This is very good now and should be great with a couple years of age.  M - Very chewy without being syrupy  D - This is suprisingly drinkable given the ABV and the lack of age, had no problem finishing a 12oz.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RRC87,4.35,"2008 vintage Had on-tap at Stub and Herbs at Darkness Eve  A: Pitch black that doesn't allow any light to penetrate it, even at the corners. There is a dark creamy head that leaves dissipates quickly.  S: The aroma is dominated by vanilla and bourbon as would make since. These are supplemented by a sweet tobacco. There is also a tiny bit of alcohol in there as well but only enough to cut through.  T: the taste is very complex and very deep with one layer on top of the other. The largest player is the bourbon and vanilla but there are also notes reminiscent of tobacco. There is also the subtlest hint of soy on the end. The only reason it doesn't get a five is because the alcohol is still pretty forward as it warms.  M: Thick and viscous. It goes down silky smooth and clings to the palate and leaves a sweet residue that you taste for long after you swallow.  D: Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV. Obviously you don't want to drink to much of this to quick, but then again that isn't what it's designed to be. Clearly a sipper but just delicious.  Overall: Would have been higher, but the booze becomes a bit too prevent as it warms; none the less, this is absolutely deliciousness.

1549,10672,TommySudz,4.45,"Found this in a 4 pack at the local mom & pop market with an aisle dedicated to craft beer. Pricey, but worth it Poured very dark and clean with no head at all. Definitely could smell the bourbon in the glass, but that was a good thing. Taste initally quite strong but goes down very smoothly. As the evening progressed I enjoyed this more and more. No bitter aftertaste as it warmed slightly in the glass.

1549,10672,Slatetank,4.6,"This was an '07 acquired in a trade w/ bgramer -thanks man! -shared at the stout tasting '10. poured chilled into a 1/2 pint.  The stout looks like black coffee with translucent clarity and has a mild brown ring of beads after the pour. The lace is spotty. The smell of this aged stout is a thing of beauty with the wood and malt producing some beautiful blended aroma of coffee and slight sherry/custard notes with a mild element of alcohol and subtle oak w/ mild bourbon. the feel is strong, lots of wood and alcohol with a subtle sweet element and strong wood presence, mild resinous texture with semi-dry finish.  The flavor has lively blend of vanilla, bourbon from the barrel aging and it pops! The taste lives up to the name as the cocoa and bourbon taste is sweet woody and gently toasted with vanilla from the oak playing off the intense dark malt flavors with a slight coffee in a mild degree, but the bourbon is pretty high in the flavor as expected even after three years in the cellar. I consider this a world class beer, wonderful use of barrels and still with all the alcohol in the flavor it has a high drinkability quotient for me - a crazy good bourbon barrel stout -I would love to have it in one of its other incarnations.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Could have a touch more head, but thats probably nit picking. Just shy of pure black, with a lovely brown edge in the glass. Smell is deep caramel and of course bourbon. Taste is divine. Bourbon flavor is perfectly balanced and come in in the beginning and end, leaving lots of space in the middle for a strong stout flavor to shine. Mouthfeel is thick, sticky and creamy, low carbonation but just right for the style. Where is the 13% alcohol? This beer could be dangerous in the wrong hands.

1549,10672,tewaris,4.36,"60 IBUs 2008 vintage 12 oz. twist off bottle, bottled on October 28, 2008, poured into a 25 oz snifter on October 20, 2010. Almost 2 years! Apparently the best barrel aged stouts used to come in twist off bottles a while back ;)  Appearance 5/5 Most vigorous of pours cannot force a persistent head out of this beer. The initial froth that would subside soon into a thin collar is the darkest of browns, with some foam wandering on the surface of the beer in mocha like spirals. The beer itself is dark as night, although much later when the collar dies, deep brown highlights can be seen.  Aroma 4/5 Sweet oak and bourbon, sharp alcohol, hot chocolate, and coffee dominate the nose in the order mentioned, with *perhaps* some leather, tobacco, and vanilla. However, alcohol becomes dominant and everything else gets pushed to the background when the beer warms up, which is a not a good thing.  Taste 4.5/5 Creamy sweet hot chocolate and bourbon, with a massive chocolate and coffee aftertaste when the beer is colder. When it's warmer, a dark, unsweetened chocolate and bitter coffee taste also kicks in before finish, and coffee like acidity is also felt. In fact, the slight bitterness helps the finish too, which is medium, and therefore surprisingly clean for a beer of this magnitude. However, booze affects the taste too at higher temperatures.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Thick, creamy, and luxurious mouthfeel with very low carbonation; this is a beer with a truly big body that coats the mouth and seems to stay on the palate forever.  Drinkability 4/5 This is a sipper, but the problem with sipping it is that it's going to get warm, and messy. The usual serving temperature for big stouts is 55°F, but this one must be served at Goose Island's recommended 40°F, and the bulk of this beer must be enjoyed before it warms up to room temperature. Too much alcohol is a flaw in this beer, that becomes glaringly obvious at room temperature.  This is my earlier review of BCBS (from January 27, 2010):  look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | drink: 4 Looks absolutely beautiful in a worthy glass and the smell is one of the best among all stouts I have had: wood is certainly dominating to me and a faint smell of tobacco works magic. Of course there's more to the smell, like dark fruit. Overall very complex. Also, the alcohol is evident.  Taste is rich and complex and could be described as bitter-sweet in one word. Mouthfeel is silky and luxurious but a little cloying for my taste. If drinkability means what BudLight advertises, this beer would score a 0.0 but that's what one would expect from this strong a stout.  Alcohol/bourbon becomes overpowering as the beer warms up.

1549,10672,Greywulfken,4.61,"This is an incredible beer - almost not a beer, but somewhere between a wine and a spirit. I have always had a predilection toward dark beers, notably stouts, but this was my first ever bourbon stout. My earliest memory of a truly sweet stout was Mackeson's Triple Stout. I have, of late, been exploring various Imperial Stouts when I was introduced to this by my distributor. Whoa. This is the beer for fans of Imperial-style stouts and hard liquor: sweet, thick, and powerfully aromatic.  Appearance is black oil; moderately thick, light caramel-colored head.  Smell is bourbon, coffee, molasses, and vanilla. You can smell this from across the room.  Taste is sweet, rich, and silky, suffused with dark bourbon - maybe a bit overpowering.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and lush, leaving a wet, sultry aftertaste - but again, maybe a touch too rich for repeated consumption.  Drinkablity is ""damn, I want another,"" but it is very filling and can go straight to your head. Drank one of the big bottles (22 oz?) in one sitting, not knowing any better, and was shot for the rest of the afternoon. Strong stuff.  This is an incredible stout, but drink it in moderation. Respect the beer and reap the rewards. Store some for next year if you have the discipline; it will age in the bottle.  This beer falls into the category of beers that I will always buy when when they become available, but don't want to drink more than that.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,YouSkeete,4.7,"A: Practically jet black. In fact, it's the blackest beer i've ever seen. Tan head, hardly any lacing.  S: Bourbon is the absolute front runner in the smell. Roasted coffee beans, chocolate, wood and smoke are the main aromas in this one.  T: The first sip tastes more like bourbon than beer, but the taste rolls into more of a stout, with the chocolate and coffee becoming prominent. the taste of the oak-agedness (is that a word? it is now.) never leaves the palate. Vanilla beans are present, but the aftertaste is strictly Chocolate.  M: Syrupy and extremely malty. falls over the tongue like a great stout. High in carbonation, but all well balanced.

Got an OK-sized head that was khaki in color. The aroma is amazing - bourbon and chocolate and roasted coffee bean. A bit smokey wood in there as well.  Taste matches the aroma. I was surprised that it was balanced so well. I really thought the booze would be too hot and overpowering. Burn malt aroma is up front, followed by fudgy chocolate. The bourbon taste underlies the taste from beginning to end. nothing overpowers any other flavor note.  Fairly thick. Rich. A bit chewy. Just a tad carbonated.

Small amount of mud hued head. Tiny soapy lace ring. Reminds me of an aggressively poured cup of coffee.  S: Wow! The word bourbon is first in the name for a reason. Even a year on this bottle did nothing to tame the bourbon beast. Once past the hot booze traces of roasted black coffee, chocolate and a bit of wood.  T: The bourbon isn't as strong in the flavor thankfully. Don't get me wrong it's the main element but the roasted burnt malt and chocolate seem to balance things out. Super rich fudge cake drizzle with caramel bourbon sauce comes to mind.  M: Full thick chewy chocolate syrup like body. Just a trace of carbonation.

Not much else going on here, but that's okay with me.  T/M-Rich,creamy,a little hot on the back end. I think this has actually lost some complexity.

1549,10672,WinthrHOPHEAD89,4.62,"A 2009 edition 22oz. bomber poured into a glass goblet and a standard tumbler, with a bottled on date of 12/18/2009.  A - This beer is absolutely the blackest thing I have ever seen poured into a glass, aside from the Monster ""Black Ice"" Slurpee. I attemptd to shine an extra bright key light through it but I could not see throught it AT ALL. The head that generated in both glasses was the darkest head i've ever seen on a beer as well. Straight up brown in color. This beer looked more like a milk shake than a beer. Both heads were generated from straight pours with the goblet (first pour) generating about a two finger, and the tumbler generating a 1 finger. Both heads fizzle down to a sudsy film, but does stick around till the end, but doesn't really seem to stick to the glass. But this in not way effects the overall rating of this beer.  S - The aroma of this beer filled the room as soon as the cap was popped off. The smell of this beer is just absolutely unreal!!! Vanilla, and smoaky oak are the easiest to pick out, but the sweet bourbon smell is certainly discernable as well. I wouldn't say that its the best smelling beer i've ever experienced, but certainly one of the most unique. Its really just all over the map. Woody, Fruity, Boozy, with notes of Coffee, Vanila, Caramel, and Chocolate.  T - The taste... holy hell!!! This thing was certainly the most complex pallate i've ever critiqued. Right up front you get vanilla, chocolate and caramel notes, but in the middle you get a very fruity character (almost like a cocolate covered cherry or something of the like, and on the end you get the boozy bourbon taste. You do notice the alcohol on the finish, but for 13% abv its actually pretty well masked. Since this bottle was almost a year old, i'm sure that the boozy character of this beer has mellowed out just a little, but overall the taste of this beer is unlike anything i've ever experienced. It seems more like a mixed drink or liquour more than a beer really because of its complexity.  M - The mouthfeel of this beer is extremely thick and syrupy. This was also the thickest beer I have ever drank as well (A LOT of extremes were met this beer with me). The composition of this beer reminded me of a chocoloate syrup (or an EXTRMEMELY thick chocolate milk). The boozey aspect of this beer really doesn't warm your toungue, but more so the back of the throat. It also creates a very very strong warming sensation on the way down. So much in fact, this beer made me start sweating, and had me remove some clothing. This would a perfect way to warm up after being in the snow for a few hours.  D - The drinkability on this beer is sadly not very high. This beer is DEFINITELY a sipper because of its thickness and dense composition/pallate. In fact, if anyone is able to slug this thing down, theres a problem. This beer would probably cause one hell of a stomache ache if consumed too fast.  Final Thoughts: This beer was easiliy THE MOST unforgetable experience i've ever had drinking a beer. This beer not only raised the bar as far as stouts/imperial stouts go but shows that a beer is able to pushed to the extremes and still be an absolutely pleasure to drink. If I come across a few more of these, especialy earlier editions, I will easily pick a few up a store them for a while, just to see how different it can get over time. This beer is an easy TWO THUMBS UP!!! You can tell that alot went into this beer, and it certainly a abolute pleasure to drink.

1549,10672,Kinsman,4.22,"My 100th Review  Picked up a 4-pack of the 2009 edition the other day. Bottled on date: 11/12/09  A dark mahogany brown comes pouring out the bottle, filling the glass with a nice opaque black body. A very minimal dark tan, almost brown head quickly makes an appearance but quickly dissipates.  Aroma is heavy on the bourbon, and light on the rest. Similar to sniffing a glass bourbon, but without a strong alcohol presence and a bit sweeter with hints of vanilla.  Following a strong aroma, I fully expected this beer, at 11 months old, to sill be too hot with bourbon/alcohol flavors. However, while the bourbon is certainly the most up-front flavor, there is a lot of room for other flavors to show off as you explore. At first it literally taste like a shot of bourbon was dropped in the glass but the strong flavor doesn't stick around too long. A slight roasted barley flavor can be detected as well as a woody vanilla flavor that would be hard to detect in most bourbons. It finishes with a slightly bitter kick, but it is not by any means hoppy.  Mouthfeel is actually lighter than expected for a 13% abv beer, but it still packs a punch. As the beer warms, so does the power of the alcohol and you feel it.  Overall, this is a great stout, but at 11 months old, I don't think its reached its peak. I'll let at least 2 bottles from this batch sit a while longer, because I have a feeling that the background flavors will only show-off more with time.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A: This beer pours black in color with a ¼ finger mocha head that fades into a swirl of bubbles and a crown that remain for the duration of the drink.  S: The bourbon and booze in this one definitely come through on the nose, with those two, in order, the dominant smells. Deeper down, there are notes of chewing tobacco, chocolate, and some sweet molasses. Not as balanced as other barrel aged stouts, but still an interesting, complex, and intense aroma out of this beer. I think this smells similar to Angel's share bourbon barrel.  T: Lots of bourbon on the tongue. There is a bit of alcohol warmth and bite up front, but this is minimal. More subtle flavors include chocolate and sweet caramel. If there were one thing that would improved this beer, it would be some balance and a little something to mellow it out...thankfully we have the coffee and vanilla versions.  M: Thick and chewy, with a great (albeit low) level of carbonation. Great aftertaste and sits on the tongue very nicely.  D: Not as drinkable as other beers of this class. Most recently, the vanilla version of this, Ivan the Terrible, and Bourbon barrel plead the fifth, come do mind as more drinkable and overall probably better beers. Although, this is still an excellent beer in my opinion. As one of first barrel aged beers I had about 1.5 years ago, this will always bring back good memories for me. The alcohol is noticeable, but considering the 13% ABV it still goes down very easily and smoothly.

Bourbon dominates the taste, but it is not overwhelming at all with chocolate, toffee, and caramel and coffee added in. As it warms a bit the bourbon is more prevalent in the nose along with a strong sweetness. The bourbon comes across a bit more boozy which is very pleasant.  Amazingly thick mouthfeel, especially after the carbonation dissipates a bit after a minute or two. Because of some of its best qualities, its drinkability is not as great.

Also, had this after a TenFidy (and during the Mir/Cro Cop fight last night). Aroma was massive, just like about every other aspect of this beer. Wood and whiskey.  Taste, sure bourbon, the stout aspect of it seemed a little naked. Certain amount of smoky sweetness to it. Doesn't really have anything unique that other bourbon barrels don't bring to the table. Definitely a sipper, but doesn't seem hot for 13%. Seems to get thicker and more boozy throughout the mouthfeel as the glass gets more empty. Syrup or molasses, or just maybe how sludgy you get at this strength and style. An immense amount of chocolate.

Crazy aromas in the nose including coffee, dark bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and the ever present bourbon and oak notes. The bourbon aroma is much more subdued now than in fresher batches. The taste is just as complex and rewarding as the aroma. Full heavy mouthfeel filled with bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and oak flavors. The bourbon makes a bigger appearance in the taste as it warms but still is not overpowering.

The blackness is impressive, the pop as well.  2008 vintage.. tasted on 6/13/10  Still solventy, hot hot hot! Loving it, but I'm sure this will continue to get better. Not sweet. Dry, burning finish, oaky. It lingers strongly, angrily. It will not go quietly into that good night. Nor will I.  Note: This beer is also fantastic warmed beyond reason.

We drank half the bottle at cellar temp, not as solventy actually as the 08. Bourbon, vanilla, alcohol, little roast. Damn excellent. As per tradition, heated up on the stove to about 120-130.

More licorice and fig with some molasses along with vanilla and tobacco on the back that rolls into a mellow and warming bourbon finish. The mouthfeel on this beer is really what sets it apart.

Well... looks just as good as I remember! Dark, viscous black. Brown head-- tight 2 fingers of thick creamy bubbles. Nice chunks of lacing hang on the sides of the glass, just frozen in time.  Well... The bourbon is still a giant part of this one! The chocolate notes have gained a little ground since this was fresh. The nose is still predominantly bourbon, followed by roasted chocolate and dry barley with an earthy and oaky note hiding in there too. All of those notes from the nose are found in the taste. A sweetness up front from the malts/chocolate notes turns slightly dry before the sweet bourbon and booze round out the finish. This is a fantastic little sipper!  This is full bodied, no holds barred, knock down drag out awesome! Rich and smooth feel with a creaminess that massages your palate and throat. This is an amazing big beer to sit and sip on.

A - Black as night with a one finger high coffee brown head which quickly faded, leaving some spotty film and hardly any lacing.  S - A plethora of interesting scents including vanilla, chocolate, oak, bourbon, and caramel.  T - Dark roasted caramel malt begins, quickly revealing the barrel aging effects. Hints of burnt oak and bourbon penetrate the senses, along with some molasses and vanilla sweetness. The flavors are definitely on the rich side, with a boozy warmth slicing through the palate, especially towards the end. Finishes sweet and dry with lingering alcohol and caramel.  M - Heavy body, almost syrupy at points, carbonated but not overdone.  D - About as drinkable as a 13% beer can be, this is a slow sipper, but still enjoyable to drink the whole way through.  Barrel aged stouts like this continue to wow me, especially with bourbon characteristics which successfully go beyond just creating a boozy novelty item. Someone trade me the coffee version!  2013 Update: Nearly 3 years later, this continues to be one of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts.

1549,10672,devilben02,3.55,"2009 ed. Pours from the bottle with a deep, dark brown that looks as black as any good imperial stout. It seems flat at first, but a thin creamy head of tiny tan bubbles developed at the end of the pour. The aroma is a potent combination of whiskey and dark chocolate. The flavor is more of the same, with rich dark chocolate filling the mouth at first (along with lesser notes of oak, vanilla, dark roasted coffee), and the bourbon taking over in the finish.  Despite the appeal of each of the flavors individually, however, they seem to fight each other rather than melding together nicely. In addition, the bourbon flavor comes across as more of a straight-up alcohol presence than I would have liked rather than just a sweet woodsy essence. The texture is certainly mouth-filling, with a resinous, boozy stickiness. Overall, I can recognize the depth and complexity of the flavors that are developed in this beer, but it just doesn't come together for me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The foam was dark brown and made of supremely small bubbles.  S - The aroma is of strong malt, alcohol, oak and whiskey. Textbook for the style, and extremely appetizing.  T - The taste is sweet malt balancing with hot alcohol. The wood and whiskey flavors seamlessly join them and smooth out the whole experience.  M - The body is thick and creamy, and coats the mouth in a satisfying way. There is some hops bitterness, a tiny bit of CO2 tickle from the carbonation, and lots of alcohol burn.  D - The overall experience is incredible. The oak and whiskey add balance and blend the other elements together.

The head is short lived, but a beautiful dark brown for a minute or so. Almost no lacing, but some nice legs.  Smell: This is a beast. Its 13%, and it shows. Very strong bourbon aroma. Alcohol stings the nose a little. Espresso, chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Boozy, roasty, and sweet.  Taste: Extremely bourbony. Almost like a stout with a shot of bourbon dumped in. Strong bitter coffee and chocolate. Roasted marshmallow and vanilla in the finish which is long and sweet.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and slick in the way that liquor can be, but not as thick and chewy as a big stout can be. It is by no means thin or light in the mouth, it just has a combination of beer and liquor mouthfeel. Different, and good.  Drinkability: I hate sharing, but this is so big and intense, that it should be shared. The bourbon is not just a note you detect, it really dominates the beer, but in a good way.

Tastes of roast coffee and the same dark fruits in the aroma. More figs than raisins, it has some sweetness but it certainly isn't overpowering. The bourbon is present but relatively mild and there's an alcohol burn in the finish that reminds you that you're dealing with a potent brew.

The head was a nice beige and ruby color before it dissipated into a thick ring around the glass.  Lots of bourbon in the nose with the vanilla notes that often accompany it. Malts are obviously in play here but it isn't knocking my socks off like I expected. Hype aside I am just not getting a lot of depth in the smell department.  Bourbon, bourbon and more bourbon. If you were to order a beerbon at a bar this is what you would get. Vanilla and coconut are also prominent. I can almost get a sense of hops but that bourbon/vanilla flavor just comes crashing in. Same goes for the malt really. Obviously, that's exactly what Goose Island was going for here so kudos to them for cranking it up to 11.  Thick yet smooth mouthfeel. A bit sticky on the lips. Excellent and just what you'd expect from a stout like this. Major warming feeling going on with this beer. Gotta love it on a cold night.  A fantastic barrel aged beer. If you like bourbon and want to experience the beer version of it then this beer is for you. I do feel that Bourbon County is dangerously close to a one trick pony though. The barrel aging is in full control of the flavor profile and thus makes it a bit one note in my eyes.

Deep dark chocolate notes. Woody, Earthy, Nutty, Dark Malts, Caramel, and a hint of alcohol.  T - Wow. Upfront I get hit with a decadent caramel/chocolate sweetness which is quickly followed by a not insignificant warm burst of alcohol.  M - Heavy.

The pour is a deep, dark brown - not quite black, but pretty close. A small tan head forms, recedes to a collar almost instantly. This beer pours as thick as any beer I can think of. The pour is almost whisper quiet, indicating ridiculous viscosity. Like a glass of used motor oil.  Smell is fantastic. Leather, tobacco, and an oak and smoke background. A little boozy, but not to the degree that the ABV would indicate. Bourbon, oak, vanilla. Very complex, very inviting.  The taste is divine. The tobacco leads, with leather not far behind. The bourbon is noticeable, but contributes more in flavor than it does in booziness. This beer has done well over the last couple years of aging... I'm glad I have more. Espresso, molasses and brown sugar round the taste out. This is slightly sweet, but not nearly as much as other imperial stouts.  Mouthfeel is great. Thick, oily, sticky. This beer, despite being massive in flavor and in alcohol content, is still very drinkable (all things considered). It's a sipping beer to be sure, but damn, I wouldn't mind having a couple of these in a night.  Excellent beer. Highly, highly recommended.  ***Edit: As the beer warmed further towards room temperature, some booze and a bit of unwanted astringency manifested itself.

1549,10672,popery,4.62,"BCS is an incredible beer. It's relatively easily available and puts many hyped beers to shame. While it's not quite the best barrel-aged stout in the country, it defines the sub-style for me (and, I assume, many others) and has held up very well against a horde of fancified newcomers. The beer is jet black with a healthy brown head, when fresh. The head is much smaller with older vintages. The aroma is big and rich with flavor. There's a ton of bourbon, but it doesn't drown out the dark malt and other barrel notes. Coffee, chocolate, roast, vanilla and oak aromas blend almost perfectly with the bourbon. The taste is strong and assertive but also smooth and luxurious, just as a big stout should be. There's a good deal of booze, but it's a warming, pleasant presence and the beer is better for it. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Not to take anything away from the base stout, but Goose Island is simply better at barrel-aging than the vast majority of breweries. I don't know if this is experience paying off or if Greg Hall is just a genius brewer who nailed it on his first try, but Goose Island BCS is a modern classic of American beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Solid without much of a head from either year. The color remained consistent year to year - dark, but not without a bit of soul.  The aroma was also consistent from year to year. I expected the '08 to have mellowed, but the slightly smoked smell is well behind the bourbon. Well behind.  The taste is exceptional...from year to year there is some mellowing of the outright bourbon taste, and there is also a slightly different note of alcohol in each. I found the '09 to have a very strong alcohol taste the first time I had it and that sparked my desire to do try a couple of years back to back for the review. I don't find the omnipresent alcohol that I recall from the first taste. The malt is strong as well and the marriage is well balanced.  Damn near perfect.

Until now I was uncertain of my favorite style of beer - but this is it.  Granted you've probably got to have an appreciation for heavier alcohols to like this - but not a problem in my book.

1549,10672,Ryan011235,4.41,"Poured into a snifter on 8/23/10  2007 vintage  I wasn't far into the pour when I realized a more aggressive approach was needed if this beer was to have any tangible head. I kept the scorched dark brown beer at a slow drizzle from a high vantage point. Some patchy bubbles were manifest but quickly retreated to the inside of the rim. Swirling works up an ephemeral skim & lots of small lace spots; some of which actually hold. Half way in sediment is visible on the bottom.  I'll admit taking a whiff after popping the cap; the aroma is such that I couldn't but enjoy the bourbon. Once in the glass the magnitude of the aroma becomes undeniable. The charred oak is most notable, followed by bourbon heat & vanilla overtones. The base stout is equally impressive with a showing of semi-sweet chocolate, cocoa powder, molasses, hints of coffee dregs & subtle notions of caramel. It's hard telling where the charred ends & the roasted begins.  Upon taking a sip my lone gripe is that oxidation is apparent upfront. Thankfully the other flavors are so strong as to mask said oxidation. Solid undercurrents of chocolate, molasses & near burnt sugars. Indeed, these roasted malts offer a sweetened platform from which the barrel launches its attack. Charred, almost ashy notes of oak are paired with just-shy-of-scathing bourbon character. This is a hot beer, even after several years. The vanilla isn't as distinct compared to the aroma.  The feel is just as formidable. There's an inherent slickness that belies just how full bodied this is. Unleashed by low carbonation & underscored by a slow moving grittiness, this truly is a heavy beer. There's no attempt to quell the alcohol heat & it's warm if not outright numbing. Whiskey, charred oak & near-burnt malts linger long after the finish.  I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked this bottle. I'd heard the 2008 vintage is still boozy; I reckon an extra year hasn't done much in terms of mellowing. I certainly recommend giving this a shot, especially if bourbon barrel imperial stouts are your bag (if that's the case, though, you likely already know).

Searching through my backlog of reviews, I find tasting notes of vintage bottles, fresh ones, and one particular review from my favorite time drinking it: at GI Wrigleyville a few months ago.  A - It pours blacker than charred sin; a fleeting wisp of head was there, or was it? The brew looks discernible oily and ominous. Rolling it around the glass, it has some serious legs.  S - Huge notes of Bourbon are available; in fact everything I find pleasant about Bourbon is apparent, and nothing of disdain has been transposed from the barrel treatment. The nose features a fabulous olfactory balance of vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut and deep roasted chicory to complement the luxurious booze.  T - The taste is everything the nose promises and more. The flavors meld on the palette and are intensely complementary. The booze is a bit strong, though it is not unwelcome or truly overpowering, it is just expansive enough to command respect. Huge vanilla, cocoa, toffee, oak and caramelized sugar impressions weave a whisky-laden tapestry of ostentatious delectability. This is really in the top-tier of BA- Stouts, in spite of the widespread availability.  M - Not the thickest in strict viscosity terms, but as velvety and oily as they come. I love it.

Really couldn't pick too much out of the aroma. The flavor to me is the best chocolate syrup mixed with a bourbon alcohol kick. And the barrel aging imparts some definite vanilla and wood flavor. Seriously, I would love to pour this over some vanilla ice-cream.  Taste is dramatically dense, do I really have to tell you that it is full bodied? Doubt it. Bitterness tries to balance but ultimately gives way to a torrent of malt character. Surprisingly sippable for such a high ABV beer. Super creamy and velvety, soft on the tongue; just exceptional feel.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,StephenRich,4.94,"Yes it is summer now, but I still can't resist the thick, black creaminess of a luscious Imperial Stout; nonetheless one aged in bourbon barrels! Goose Island has recently seduced me into a world of deep endless stouts with their Bourbon County Stout, a Bourbon Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout crafted in honor of their 1,000th batch at their original Clybourn brewpub.  Goose Island has been winning international beer awards since way back in 1989 for their Wheat Beer, and this Bourbon County Stout most recently won Gold at the World Beer Cup in 2006, not to mention a Platinum medal at the 2008 World Beer Championships.  Moderate bitterness, thick chocolate and roast flavors, and a deep and wide palate of oak and smoke, this really is a stout worth a thousand words, and if you are a deep and rich stout fan, it is almost imperative that you go out and find this beer!  I brought the Bourbon County Stout out and let it rest a bit to bring it up to a cool temperature worthy of this big stout, around 8C (45F). Goose Island does recommend a colder 40F, however I prefer my Imperial Stouts closer to cellar temperature, so I went with a happy medium. Pouring it into a snifter was a gorgeous sight; it poured smooth and gracefully, gently lifting close to a one inch massively dense nutty brown milk chocolate head on top of a midnight black beer.  I took a good look at it to try to find some colored hues or shimmering ambers, but this beer is just as deep and dark as they come. The head managed to stick around for a while, but eventually faded to a molten brown ring on top a still mercilessly black stout. It is 13% abv, and thus far showed very strong barrel-aged stout characteristics, but the next test proved to lock it up.  Soft dark chocolate, smooth caramel melting atop a mound of creamy vanilla, immensely rich charred oak, a hint of whisky sweetness, light smoke and powerful malt poured of this beer in a masterful bouquet of sensual and mouthwatering scents. Umm.. wow is all I can really say. I had to go hunt down my roommate immediately to let him smell this stupendous stout; it really did take my breath away.  So I hadn't even sipped this stout yet and it had already won me over. Ok Goose Island, well done. But lets see if you taste as good as you smell. A long smooth wave of this beer into my mouth brought everything I wanted and more! Immediately oaky bourbon and wide roasted malts flow over your tongue touching bitter sweet, mellow smoke and soft roast. Quickly then dark bakers chocolate hits your cheeks and flows back to your tongue in such a seductive manner I immediately grabbed my pen to record this feeling. I wrote ""what the hell! huge melted dark chocolate, warm roasty malts, perfect balance of sweet, bitter, mild hop, roast, smoke, oak and bourbon.""  I think that makes sense. What it comes down to it, the insatiable flavors in this beer just stunned me. The chocolate was literally melting on my palate making room for warm bourbon sweet oak and caramel and roasty malts. Soft biscuit malts also show their presence and light hop bitterness adds a touch of required freshness to this massive beer. The smoke is elegant and balanced with the sweet and bitter sweetness of the beer, and overall it is just supremely mellow and warming.  Go buy a bottle. Wait, go buy five bottles! Really, I think this beer will age perfectly, and you will probably have a hard time not enjoying another bottle before you can find out. It is now No. 3 on BeerAdvocate's Top Beers on Planet Earth list. If you do grab some bottles, please send me one!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T- Just like the nose, take a big, mean, sweet and heavy stout and top it off with some bourbon. This is a huge beer. Rich dark malts, a bit roasty, dark fruit sweetness, and some brown sugar/molasses/vanilla notes from the bourbon.  M- Thick, heavy, boozy, hard-hitting.  D- For waht it is, fairly high. I get drunk off this stuff because I drink it too fast- it tastes so good. One of the few beers I find improves with age, too. Had an 07 that was great and that had smoothed out a bit.

1549,10672,RankRefugee88,4.23,"Bottle poured into Sam Adams pilsner glass.  A - Probably the darkest beer I've ever seen. Completely pitched black and while even held towards a light, all I see is darkness. Very thin head dissipates very quickly, most likely because of the alcohol content.  S - Smells of a rich chocolate liqueur, but even better. Very strong powerful smell. Caramel and chocolate malts are there from beginning to end. Serious alcohol presence.  T - Wow. I was expecting good, but I wasn't expecting what I'm tasting right now. Just a extremely rich beer is the best way to put it. The alcohol content is noticeable, but everything else between the chocolate, malts, coffee are all present. And yes, the bourbon is certainly there too. It's oaky and sweet and leaves an amazing roasted rich coffee aftertaste on my taste buds. Wow.  M - Mouthfeel is nice. Absolute sipper. Creamy, rich, the alcohol gives it a little kick on the palate, but overall very nice.  D - It has a good drinkability. It has a strong ABV, but the more I drink it, the more I want to take bigger sips. It is a sipper though, so I'm trying to savor it. I can tell that the longer I wait on it and the warmer it gets, the more of a sipper it becomes.  Overall just an impressive beer. I was suggested this beer by a Manager at a local grocery store.

The head was 1 finger chocolate brown with a nice thick creamy head. The aroma is of nice bourbon and come sweet chocolate and a light hint of burnt malts. The flavor is very complex with semi-sweet dark chocolate covered by coffee and burnt sugars. The taste is smooth with a deep body and light carbonation.

1549,10672,Phelps,4.37,"2008 Vintage  Looks: inky, with a late-appearing fizzy head the color of cinnamon. The finger of foam quickly fades to a ring and silky film, but doesn't leave much in the way of lace.  Smells: heavily of bourbon, but smooth. Nicely blended, with flavors of vanilla, cocoa, light oak, toasty malts, molasses and plums. Love the malts on this, and the balance is perfect.  Tastes: like vanilla extract. The first blast is of bourbon tang, with the accompanying alcohol heat. Nearly two years of age has done little to quell the ethanol monster, as it's still powerful and fiery. Dark plums and sweet molasses blend to create a flavor like brandy, with notes of subtle butter and toffee. Waves of espresso emerge at the finish. I like how the flavors have blended, but the alcohol burn is still distracting. How many years would it take for this to die down?  Feels: smooth and creamy. Light carbonation and a full body harmonize to create a very enjoyable texture. Other than the destructive alcohol, this is pretty perfect.  Drinks: like unification. Age has done wonders for this beer and has brought together flavors that were just a little estranged in the fresh bottles I've tried. While the alcohol heat's still quite heady, the going gets easier as I drink. BCS goes down smooth and it doesn't quit. Still the classic barrel-aged stout.  ---  Tasting notes:  Bottled 10-9-09, enjoyed March 2011.  Huge legs like syrup as I swirl the glass. Nose is smooth, yet somewhat subdued and very buttery. Taste has developed incredible smoothness. More molasses and coffee has emerged, bourbon has actually faded a bit. The alcohol burn has died down considerably as well. Goes down so easily.

Aromas of dark malt, dark fruit--preserved plums and other fruits--chocolate, vanilla, and sugar.  Tastes follow the nose, with lovely dark malt, preserved dark plums, chocolate, vanilla, brandy, bourbon. Finishes sweet but with a dryness that emerges in the long finish.

Elements of bourbon vanilla dark fruit cherries cling to the palate throughout a very pleasant slightly bittering coffeehouse finish.

1549,10672,amanofbeer,2.14,"Served in a snifter glass. It looks like most aged imperial stouts I have had: dark as night, and virtually head-less. Pockets of foam rise to the surface and dissipate, replaced by new ones, as if it is still living. Interesting to watch.  As soon as I popped the cap (not realizing it was a twist off) I got a punch in the face of dark malt, and some bourbon. It honestly does not smell all too different from their Night Stalker stout, which was somewhat disappointing, as I was hoping for more bourbon. The smell consists of your standard caramel, chocolate, and coffee, (not to strong on the coffee however). The malts smell overpowering, and unbalanced.  Not only do I taste next to no bourbon, but it seems unbalanced for an imperial stout. There is a very present sweetness, accompanied by on overly bitter roasted malt flavor that really sticks in the back of the palate. The one redeeming factor in the flavor is the aftertaste. The bitterness dies off, and I finally can experience a slight bourbon lingering.  It has got to be one of, if not THE most, syrupy beer I have ever tasted. I highly regret opening this within 5 months of buying it. While I suppose 13% alcohol creates quite an awe effect, I now feel that this sort of abv does not belong in the category of stouts...(certainly without cellaring)...there are simply too many residual sugars, and the extremely high gravity makes for a poor amount of head, and a thick coating on the mouth and throat. Even clearing the palate before hand with about 12 ounces of water wasn't enough to prevent me from needing water during the drink. It also seemed to inherit what I consider a negative quality of bourbon, which is a burn in the back of the mouth that dissipates as the aftertaste begins.  I started drinking this 15 minutes before I started writing, and I am now only 3/4s of the way done. It's a sipper for sure, and not one I want to spend $6.39 on again any time soon (5 months, at least!!!)  I could imagine this being better on tap, but only if the syrupy-ness is reduced. I am somewhat disappointed that the final gravity couldn't have gotten a bit lower. Aging would Clearly do this beer justice.

A: Typical of what you would expect for a draft bourbon stout. Slight brown appearance with little head and no lacing. Dark, almost opaque throughout the body of the glass.  S: Smell is a kick in the face of bourbon, with slight notes of caramel and some chocolate.  T: First hints are not as strong of bourbon as the aroma, but it does contain lots of vanilla and oak. Pleasantly, there is not as much of an alcohol taste as the smell would suggest. Amazing coffee/chocolate finish that sits very well and invites more.  M: Thin, yet appropriate.

This beer tastes great, the carbonation is basically gone but the beer has enough flavor that it remains balanced and exciting. The alcohol is a prominent flavor in this brew, strong and harsh on the throat. There is a roastiness/dryness I'm picking up as well, along with the aforementioned smells.

First taste is a massive mouthful of bourbon and it is oh so good. Creamy chocolate compliments the bourbon character nicely.

Taste is an onslaught of flavor. It starts with charred wood, then a rich maltose middle and a vanilla, coffee and chocolate finish. Strong aftertaste of alcohol. Mouthfeel is like syrup, super chewy and decadent. Very little carbonation which is perfect for this beer. Drinkability though is pretty low though. The sheer amounts of alchol affects how much you can drink.

M- really good for the style. thick and savory, but not the over-sugared way too sticky feeling. very nice. the lasting and warming burn down the throat is an especially nice touch, like taking a sip of super smooth bourbon. a little more carbonation would be nice, but definitely still very good.

1549,10672,velosuds,4.28,"2008 edition bottled on 10/16/08. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a clear pint glass. Single purchased at Whole Foods San Rafael, CA (first place I have seen this) for $4.99.  A-Pours a midnight black. Very dark. No light gets through this beauty. A one finger, creamy tan head quickly recedes into a scant lace.  S-Alcohol from the bourbon barrels is the predominant aroma. Very fragrant. Vanilla and raisin notes are also present.  T-This is definitely a bourbon stout, and probably deserves its own style classification, as it is very different from non-bourbon barreled double stouts. I admit it is not my thing. Bourbon whiskey from 100 days aging in bourbon barrels is the most dominant flavor profile. However, there are some very nice stout beer flavors in the background like brown sugar, bittersweet chocolate, and dried fruits, especially raisins. Taste definitely improves as it warms, and becomes very sweet. The alcohol adds to the flavor rather than detracts from it. Well done. Label indicates this ages well up to 5 years, and perhaps the bourbon profile will mellow.  M-Deliciously smooth with medium to full body. Warming due to the alcohol.  D-This is a fine beer.

While lots of folks are reaching for a pilsner or pale ale, I figured I'd go the opposite direction, drinking some stouts, which I usually prefer to have in the dead of winter.  2007 vintage. Oh baby. Syrupy pour with very little head that bubbles a bit but otherwise is unimpressive. Color is coal, pitch black. Smell is bourbon, wood, chocolate syrup, roasted malt. Promises to be a hefty beer. Tastes amazing, with caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and roasted flavors.

Taste is ... a loss for words. Vanilla, oak and cocoa but joined with a mouthfeel that is so extraordinary, in it's creaminess and fullness. It only loses a few points to its not quite entirely hidden alcohol that makes it kind of prickly.

T: there is so much going on here that consist of bourbon like the nose coconuts, raisins, booze, chocolate, and roasted malt accents. It also has toffee and candy sugar but has so many ingredients to list; very complex.  M: full body with a moderate amount of carbonation that had a sweet, roasty, rich and booze finish.

1549,10672,gregalobeer,3.2,"This beer is a challenge. A stanky bourbon-bogged challenge. I don't like peeking at the review average before I write, but I did this time, and I'm somewhat taken aback. The color and texture are gorgeous, but the taste is all but offensive. Most of the elements of a nasty sub-par bourbon are present, none of the charming woodsy flavors or alcohol kicks, and all of the foul composty, earthy tones. Something is rotten in this brew.

1549,10672,Bendurgin,3.62,"A big thanks to Fostah is in order for this one. Poured this into a tulip. Pours black with a thin tan head that vanishes quickly. Not much lacing. Not surprising due to the high abv. I don't even need to lean into the glass to smell the bourbon. In fact, when I cracked the bottle cap halfway off I got a big hit of bourbon. It's a little tough to pick up on anything else in this but there are faint aromas of cocoa and roasted malts. Rich toffee lingers in the shadows of bourbon. This really smells nice, but it is predominantly bourbon. Wow! I figured I'd get a lot of bourbon from the smell but this is outrageous! Rich bourbon hits the tongue with notes of toffee, cocoa and coffee. Bourbon really shines through in this one though. The only thing it loses on for me is that I can taste alcohol just a bit, but a 13% bourbon bomb like this I can't be surprised. Wonderfully silky mouth feel. Just enough carbonation and the body is nice and heavy. This beer is tough to drink. It took me three hours to tank through the behemoth! I've had big barrel aged beers, but he bourbon flavor got so heavy at the end it really drank more like a whiskey than a beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DukeKensington,4.11,"Don't make the mistake I did at first with this beer, and which I'm certain is the result of many of the negative reviews. Make sure to drink it at cellar temperature. Too cold and all you will smell and taste is bourbon, but let it warm up a bit and you will find a lot to enjoy.  A - Deep black, with a small amount of caramel head  S - Plenty of bourbon, but also strong caramel, and occasional hints of chocolate and coffee  T - Drink this too cold and it's all bourbon, to the point of non-drinkability. But let it warm up and you will pull out a lot of complexity. Caramel and chocolate detected above definitely present, as well as strong roasted malt. The bourbon is the flavor that kicks in strongest at first, even at cellar temperature, so give it a little time. But be careful about letting it wash around too long. The bourbon will come back to kick you in the ass.  M - Fairly light body for what I've experienced with other imperial stouts, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Smooth, but with a bit of a bite.  D - A bit more bourbon than I would have liked, but overall pretty good. I would definitely buy it again (assuming of course, there weren't other new beers available).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Average retention given the ABV, but not much lacing.  4.5 S: Bourbon is strongest, but there's a nice roasted barley component. Coffee and dark chocolate as well.  5.0 T: Bourbon is strongest again, but the other flavors have enough strength to create a great balance. Vanilla beans, coffee, sweet chocolate, some leather. Super complex and everything exists in harmony.  4.5 M: Lighter heavy body. Good carbonation. Creamy, but is missing that second layer of creaminess that would have made this brew perfect.  4.5 D: Excellent beer - even better on tap.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SqueeCantCook,4.47,"Pulled this out of the fridge when I got home from work and poured it into a Glencairn Glass a couple minutes after I got showered and changed.  A: Black with creamy mocha head that fades to a thin lid. Nice rim around the top of the glass. I held this against a light and nothing got through. This is black hole black. Giving it a little swirl, leaves some short legs. That's 13% for you. S: Bourbon up front with some nice chocolate notes. Few hints of nuts; maybe almonds or hazelnuts, dried fruit; figs and cherries. Molasses, tings of vanilla and brown sugar. Of course some oak too with a bit of coffee bean. A nice dark, mahogany roast.  T/M: Chocolate right off the bat. I expected it to be a bit heavier on the tongue, but it's fairly light to medium for its percentage. The chocolate taste fades slowly into bourbon casks with a couple bits of charcoal from the toast. Taking a second sip, the toast comes through a bit more that fades to sweet vanillin and a couple other sugary notations. The finish is quite long that hangs around, dancing with notes of smoke, vanilla, molasses, bourbon and chocolate. The chocolate is a tad overwhelming for a bourbon stout; but then again it is a stout.  D: The high ABV isn't a bad thing; it's a sipper, for sure. One of these could last me an evening. You won't be able to slam this down in a bar and ask for another pint of it anytime soon; it's not a social beer unless you're down for a deep conversation and can only get sips in between making points.  This will definitely be in my line of beers I'd try again; keep a couple in the back of a chiller and visit every now and then.

1549,10672,BostonBrewins,4.03,"A - Jet black with a tan head which dissipates within about 5 seconds of the pour. A bit disappointing as I enjoy a head which sticks around for a bit. The disappointment ends here however.  S - Powerfully fragrant. The bourbon smell almost knocks me off my feet. There's some nice accompanying notes of brown sugar, molasses, and maple syrup.  T - There's alot going on here. Roasty and charred, bordering on burnt tones transition to sweeter, sugary flavors. Vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, and caramelized sugar add some nice complexity. Finishes with a smoky, bourbon alcoholic finish.  M - Medium bodied and very smooth. Thinner mouthfeel than I expected, but I don't think this is a negative.  D - Complex and flavorful, but the strong alcoholic taste makes this less drinkable than other imperial stouts. Still a world class beer though, no question.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,jealousmonk,4.67,"This is an incredible beer--one of the best I've ever tasted. It's probably not for everyone--the flavors and alcohol are intense--but it's probably worth trying for everyone. Goose Island have pretty good beers in their regular lineup, but their high end is truly exceptional.  A-The beer pours thick and heavy, as has been stated over and over by everyone else on this page, with a thin light brown head. The looks are definitely what one would expect from a very, very big imperial stout.  S-Intense smell of bourbon. It smells very sweet--the vanilla and roasted malt scents come first, followed by the oak of the bourbon. This beer smells more strongly of bourbon than a glass of bourbon. I guess this requires that the drinker really like bourbon, but I found that it smelled wonderful.  T-Very oaky with lots of vanilla as in the smell and also very strong coffee. There is a secondary but still robust chocolate flavor. I love this beer! I have a bottle of the coffee stout sitting around and can't wait to see how that flavor develops with actual coffee in the mix.  M-Light carbonation, heavy but not at all cloying or greasy. The beer is definitely meant to be sipped rather than chugged, of course.  D-Like I said, meant to be sipped rather than chugged, but I can't help but drink too much of it. I first tasted it in a bottle, then it was on tap at Dive Bar in New York for a couple of glorious weeks, and I have had it out of a bottle a couple of times since from my stock. I usually try to share a bottle since it is 13% alcohol and all, but I have also had no trouble finishing off a 12-ounce or a pint by myself. Very surprisingly easy to drink!  I bought out the local Whole Foods after I tasted this beer the first time.

Taste of intense booze, corn mash bourbon, caramelized sugars, vanilla, oak barrel aging, and booze.

1549,10672,TempestJones,4.87,"There comes a time in everyone's beer drinking life when one eventually has pushed the boundaries of beer to the brink, and the question becomes not whether a beer is good, but whether what you're drinking is still beer.  I suppose its sort of the idea of God, being the alpha and the omega. Most likely you started off by drinking a Coors Light or Budweiser and you asked yourself, ""Is this beer?"" Now come a few years later, you're experienced, you've perused the beer aisle of your local outlet frequently and thoroughly. You've tasted dozens if not hundreds of brews. You've not only honed your own palate to a razor's edge, but have a universal sense of what would appeal to others beyond simply your own meandering ideals of the perfect beer.  Enter Bourbon County Brand Stout.  It walks the fringe, black as the abyss, mad as a hatter and beautiful as a charcoal diamond. I cannot call it the ultimate beer, because once again, it begs the question, ""What is beer?"" Nor would I want it as my ""last meal"" beer. It seems like some Lovecraftian beast, beyond mortal ken, standing astranger to us, mocking us, yet forever apart from us.  Appearance: Black. Black as the goddamn void.  Smell: More brandy than whiskey I think, a distinctive wine characteristic. Aged prunes, grapes, raisins. Wood, touch of vanilla. Redwood. Sea salt, burnt ash.  Taste: Overwhelming brandy, striking similarities to Samichlaus. Massive alcoholic punch. Syrupy mouth feel, not dissimilar to honey. Brandy, sea salt, vinegar, aged fruits. Almost sherry or port characteristics. Near infinite aftertaste, lasting whole minutes for single sips. This is closer to dessert wine than beer.  I would enjoy this on Christmas or Thanksgiving. Considering that it takes me about two hours to get through a bottle, this is NOT an easy drinking beer, and certainly not a social beverage. Treat with respect. It won't be your favorite beer, but it'll always be in the back of your head, no matter what else you drink, it'll be there, like phantasm, laughing at you until the day you die.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taken out of the fridge to warm up for a bit before pouring not too aggressively into my Duvel glass. Pours like motor oil as a deep tan head develops.  Smell hits hard with loads of bourbon. Pretty overwhelming and not in a bad way at all. Maybe a bit of semisweet chocolate coming through, as well as in the taste. Mostly just bourbon is what i'm getting in both areas.

1549,10672,Bmoyer0301,4.62,"Appearance:  Tonight I gave this beer a straight on pour in my Dogfish Head Raison De Etre goblet hoping to really funnel the aromas from the glass. With the pour I got the tiniest amount of bubbles forming on the top which appeared a dark mocha color. As for color I'm getting nothing less than the blackest black you can imagine and this baby is thick pouring like a heavy soy sauce. I gave the devilish looking sauce a big swirl and got a fair amount of lacing which crawls down the walls of my glass slowly.  Smell:  Right now my glass is at arms reach away on the coffee table and I can get a clear bouquet of bourbon from here without even trying. As I reach for it and bring it in closer the bourbon gets bigger and bigger with vanilla shooting through and mocha coffee swirling around the nose. For being 13% ABV it really hides the alcohol heat well, and in the back I'm getting a large amount of of dark fudge chocolate ( like the kind you get smothered all over your favorite ice cream ).  Taste:  MMMM...Bourbon dipped chocolate bars! This beer just shoots out of the gate with toffee, chocolate, and oaky vanilla flavors. This baby is an amazing piece of barrel aged art, there is just so much complexity here and I have had literally dozens of barrel aged stouts but I am going to go out on a limb here and say that this is definitely the best I have ever had. I think what makes this so different from any other one I had was the bourbon is not overpowering but rather just a piece of the whole puzzle. Not one flavor really just stands out in this beer and I really like that because I feel it makes for a better complex taste. On the finish, it just melts away with more chocolate and vanilla leaving you with a excellent smooth taste in the back of your throat.  Drinkability:  This beer is for sure a top rank contender for drinkability versus complexity. Again, I say for being 13% and having a huge amount of aged whiskey in it you might think it would be a challenge to drink but that is the exact opposite. This beer is velvet smooth with so many flavors going on I highly recommend you sit back relax and be sure to enjoy them all. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who like a good bourbon or even likes barrel aged beers. I was lucky enough to land this in a trade because we don't see this kind of sweet nectar out here in Pennsylvania.

S: Wow...the oak bourbon barrels are definitely up front and aggressive. Strong oak and wood notes right off the bat, lots of bourbon (can be a little overwhelming), vanilla, chocolate, and dark fruit. Malts give a roasted and charred note. Amazingly complex.  T: The flavor is different from the nose...the bourbon drinks VERY hot, and becomes boozy as it warms. Lots of vanilla and oak characters in the flavor, almost dominating everything else and creating a coconut flavor when its all said and done. Definitely the most unique stout out there. Chocolate, slight lactose, and dark fruits are in there somewhere.  MF/D: By far the thickest stout in my book. Same consistency as motor oil. Creamy and velvety feel to it.  The major faults: waaay too rich...if a fellow BA has finished a 12oz bottle without a seizure, I commend you my friend.  Also, the bourbon drinks too hot for my liking...almost tasted like a stout with a warm shot of bourbon in it. I think this aspect really takes away from the experience. I really tried to justify rating drinkability higher, but i couldn't...too intense, and I had to (reluctantly) dump part of the bottle.

Delivered by a thick, syrupy texture that reaches all parts of the palate and lingers around on the tastebuds, the flavor is delicious with a fig-like sweetness, and a great woody bourbon flavor in back.

They to me are way too alcoholic and can become too harsh because of the enormous liquor taste.  A-Pitch black with a tan head that faded quick. Standard imperial stout. S-Burdon, some vanilla, OAK! T- HARSH. Most imperial stouts are like this, so I may be bias. Heavy alcoholic taste. Not what one would want for a beer flavor. Drink liqueur if you want to taste alcohol (that's why I like beer). M-Typical for an imperial stout, but not my cup of tea. Very carbonated, with a heavy warming feeling. Not beer in feel. D- I like to drink my beer, but this is no where near drinkable. I don't want a beer that can only be sipped. It's so thick and heavy in alcohol that the drinkability is nowhere to be found.

The color is a deep, rich, black with almost no head whatsoever, just the thinnest ring of dark tan suds around the edges of the surface. Some very, very light lacing left behind.  The aroma is filled with bourbon, oak, light vanilla notes and some straight up alcohol heat. Roasted malts linger in the background.  The flavor echos the nose with bourbon, smooth, creamy chocolate and vanilla. Very good, the bourbon is front and center, but the beer finishes so smooth with the chocolate and vanilla. The initial bourbon flavor transitions to a bourbon soaked wood flavor mixed with dark, roasty malts. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, creamy and almost velvety. Low carbonation and warming alcohol. Quite good for a bourbon stout. If the body were just a tad thicker this would be perfection.  Drinkability is surprisingly good, especially for a 13% ABV bourbon stout. A rich beer that is definitely a sipper, but you can't stop sipping.  Overall, this is an excellent bourbon stout. Probably one of the smoothest, well balanced offerings I have had for this style.

It dominates the smell, but as it warms, hints of vanilla, oak, and slight burnt aromas are there as well. Would've been a 5, but the bourbon is way too much, even for a Bourbon aged stout.  T- Almost exactly like the smell, but the bourbon is a little subdued. Much better as it warms.  M/F- Extremely silky and creamy. Amazing full bodied beer here.

Half an inch of dark brown head forms around the glass only to recede quickly into a residual ring. Very little, if any lacing.  S: Rich oak, vanilla, and bourbon. Sweet chocolate malts lie in the back of the nose. The creamy bourbon along with a woodiness dominates the forefront.  T: Warm bourbon attacks the palette immediately. A nice oakiness and vanilla smooth out the burn. Fairly hot beer. I would love to see what a year or two would do on this beer.  M: Chewy, creamy, and rich body. Moderate to light carbonation.

A: Black as night...the folks from the brewery weren't lying when they said that there's literally no light coming through this one. Really thin khaki head that disappears quickly, leaving just a tiny bit of lacing.  S: This one smells like you have your head inside a bourbon barrel. Really strong with the whiskey and tannins, you can catch a little bit of a malty scent in there, but I couldn't pick up on any hops.  T: Tasted exactly like I expected it to. Really really strong, exceptionally bitter, and with a nice little bit of warmth to it. For being as dark of an IS as this is, I'm surprised at how sweet it was. All in all though, this is definitely up there in terms of taste for a BA imperial stout.  M: Each sip went in really smooth, and you don't get any of the warmth until the swallow and aftertaste, which in my mind is how I want BA beers to come across. Overall really full for pretty small sips.  D: Ha! I had a 12 oz. snifter, and was feeling the effects pretty quickly. Honestly, I bet I could've had another, but I'd say not much past that.

Flavors are the same: big chewy mouth of molasses and syrup, balanced by a very slight bitterness. Definite bite from the alcohol. Still, this is pleasantly enjoyable.

I'd be really interested to compare this to the 2008 and 2009 varieties to see how it ages.  Appearance: Pours pitch black with absolutely no head. (Bottle described it as having a thick head, so I assume this is the result of oxidation.) A very fine ring of reddish tan circumvented the interior of the glass.  Smell: The maltiness of this beer jumps right out at you from the second you pop the cap. Noted in order: Malty, Alcohol, Coffee, Chocolate, Smokey, Vanilla (after reaching room temperature).  Taste: Once again, fantastic maltiness. A mouthful of the darkest cacao beans you can find. Smokiness fills the palate from front to back. As should be expected from 13%, there is an alcoholic bite that lasts well into your second or third exhalation. I had hoped for more powerful bourbon notes , but wasn't disappointed with their absence. Smoke and chocolate flavors intensify as the beer warms, and you'll even find hints of vanilla strolling amongst the complexity of this beast.  Mouthfeel: Excellent experience as the smooth and creamy nature of this beer clashes with the strong burn of alcohol on your tongue and in the back of your throat!  Drinkability: Excellent choice. Lived up to what my mind had decided it 'should' be. You probably wouldn't want to do more than one of these by yourself.

Taste is bourbon sweet, vanilla and chocolate, the chocolate almost identical to some candy I remember my grandmother giving me when I was a kid. Mouthfeel is smooth, heavy and tingling from both the alcohol and a bit of carbonation.

A decent roast that is enveloped by the other qualities, could us a little more to give a bit of dryness to the finish and some balance. Super slick and thick mouthfeel, sulks through the mouth.

Very rich flavor of smoky malt with vanilla, caramel and sweet chocolate. It's fairly boozy (but not hot or solvent-like), which comes across as fruitiness and a wonderful oak character that plays very well off the sweet and smoky malt.

Virtually no head forms from a semi-aggressive pour and only a thin ring of bubbles remain. The high level of viscosity is visually noticeable. Despite the high abv and age of this beer, I'm just a little nervous about the apparent lack of carbonation.  S: Subdued. Alcohol first and foremost. Oak...and guess what, bourbon. A little vanilla, just a hint of honey. Some dark fruit. Caramel. Had to search a bit, but the scent is interesting and complex.  T: Big and boozy. I've never had a young BCS, but a couple of years hasn't done much to soften the heat..but at 13% it doesn't feel out of place. After the booze I'm getting a lot of chocolate and caramel...Milky Way anyone? Oak comes through mid palate and the bourbon is ever present. Huge flavor just jumps out of the glass. Flavor is a little less intriguing that I expected.  M: This was surprising to me. There was ample carbonation that wasn't apparent initially, which was a plus. On the other hand, the mouthfeel was not as viscous as the initial appearance would have suggested. I expected this beer to be bigger in the mouthfeel, more viscous.  D: This beer is delicious. At 13% this drinks how it should. I dont' necessarily desire another, but over the course of an evening I could see myself having maybe two 12oz btls over 3 or 4 hours.

Aroma is huge and reeks of bourbon: big oakiness, alcohol and vanilla. To be honest, the usual ""stout"" aromas are outdone by those produced by the barrel aging and whiskey character.  Flavor is awesome and huge. This is definitely one of the best bourbon-barrel stouts available. The woody and buttery bourbon flavors are by no means shy, and the beer tastes like there is actually a shot or two of top-notch bourbon hiding in there. More sweet than dry.

1549,10672,yeahnatenelson,4.2,"Appearance - Pours a jet black with a sliver of dark tan head that quickly dissolves into a dirty halo.  Smell - Bourbon, oak, chocolate, and toasty malts. Bourbon is definitely dominates the bouquet.  Taste - The bourbon is very pronounced, and if the beer is too cold, it dominates the taste. As the beer gets a little closer to room temperature the beer becomes more balanced and a lot of other good stuff comes out: chocolate and biscuity malts, charred oak, a welcomed hop bitterness; the beer becomes more balanced.  Mouthfeel - It's heavy on the palate and quite as syrupy. A pleasant amount of carbonation. The finish is quite warm - warms all the way down. This is a ""hot"" beer to be sure.  Drinkability - I have to say this is an interesting and complicated beer. In my first experience with this beer I was overwhelmed - and put off - by the bourbon, but after successive tastings I've taken a shine to it. I'd imagine a year or two in the cellar would do this beer some good, but it's still an exceptional beer fresh. Easily Goose Island's most exciting brands.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,herman77,4.79,"A: Blacker than black. Brownish head that dies off within a minute. Lacing slides away instantly after each sip. Its so thick that it actually leaves a film on the side of the glass and ""legs"" almost develop.  S: Big Bourbon! Vanilla beans and bittersweet chocolate.  *just had the 2011 version and wow. Changing taste score to a 5. Not nearly as sweet and boozy as I remember the 2009. T: Tons of bourbon flavor right off the bat. Its like someone poured a few ounces of bourbon and topped it off with a rich stout and mixed it together. Very sweet, a touch too much actually. The woody/oak flavors from the bourbon barrel is very apparent. Dark fruits, vanilla and bittersweet chocolate are also present, but more so in the background since the bourbon flavor is the strong-arm here. Very long vanilla and alcohol finish, you can tell this stout is very very strong. If the sweetness and alcohol burn were dialed back a bit, this would easily be a 5.  M/D: Very full body, thick and chewy. Velvety feel since its so damn thick. There is some fine carbonation present that adds to the smooth mouthfeel. No doubt, a sipper. Drinkability is average at best since you can feel the alcohol burn with each sip. I would like to try this with some more age on it, bottle stats that it was bottled on 11/12/09.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,pasdachuri,3.87,"Pours an opaque darker than Wesley Snipes. Holds a creamy dark brown head with good retention.  Strong black licorice aroma, followed by an alcohol presence and then some more black licorice.  Flavor follows the nose with black licorice and dried fruit up front with a little vanilla, oak, and plenty of malt. The bourbon makes its presence felt throughout.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Creamy and silky smooth - very full bodied.  I don't believe dirnkability is a fair category for this beer.

Bourbon dominates, but it does taste like a fine stout after all is said and done...  M - Very silky. Everything fits in just nice.  D - Needs to be sipped. Overpowering sweetness and alcohol burn get to me after half a glass. One bottle= 2 people I would say.  Not as much coffee taste as Kentucky Breakfast Stout (I much prefer the KBS)..

1549,10672,ShadesOfGray,4.4,"Picked up in Indiana while out for Dark Lord Day. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Portsmouth snifter/tulip glass. October 2009 is the date on the bottle. Pours a very dark color, almost solid black...but just a small amount of light comes through. On the other hand, when the glass is filled...it's black as night, with a very small dark tan head that dissapates pretty quickly to pretty much nothing. No lacing to speak of, just a couple fizzy bubbles here and there.  Aroma is big, sweet, boozy-bourbony, warm, with a couple over-ripe fruit notes...mostly raisin.  Wow! This is deliecious. Huge, chewy, thick, viscous, BOOZY-heat, sweet raisins! This has a great flavor. Why doesn't this beer come to Philadelphia-UNFAIR! Mouthfeel is semi-complex...smooth and creamy, with a ton of heat and warmth in the mouth and down the throat from the bourbon aging. Overall...a wonderfully brewed stout!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,WeedKing4,4.42,"Wow, this is a big beer. Pours a dark black with little foam in the glass. You can smell the bourbon and dark roasted chocolate from the glass. The taste is a punch in the face of flavour, with bourbon and roasted chocolate taking the front. Its very smooth and drinkable considering the 13% alc. Drinking an '08 followed by a '09. The older has mellowed just a bit compared to the newer batch. But both are fucking excelelnt. This is just a crazy awesome impertial stout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,AJacob81,4.67,"This has been dominating my late winter/early spring, so a review is definitely due. Poured into a snifter.  A - As The Stranger would say, 'Darker than a black steer's tucchus on a moonless summer night... no bottom.' However, the same could be said of Dark Lord, Night Stalker, The Abyss, etc., so BC doesn't necessarily stand out in this regard. The thin caramel-colored head is nice while it lasts, which is not long.  S - It smells like the inside of a bourbon barrel, as it should. However, there's also some espresso beans and dark chocolate buried in the bouquet, although this isn't the Coffee Stout (review coming soon!). The effect on my nose is curiously similar to that of a deep red wine.  T - Sweet Baby Jeebus. The bourbon and the wine again are dominant. Not much coffee here, although chocolate and dates show up as this monster warms. Fairly heavy alcohol burn, but somehow that is subsumed into the larger flavor profile, which is very complex. The wood from the barrel is present, but so is vanilla and a mild hazelnut or walnut flavor. Incredible finish, with just a touch of hops and the smoky smoothness of the bourbon leaving us where we started.  M - Liquid silk. Heavy, but very smooth. Like smoking a fine cigar, which btw, is recommended alongside this beast.  D - A sipper for sure, but an insistent one. Everytime I put it down, I was soon salivating for the next swig.  Goose Island is really making a statement with this brand, and even though they'd never admit it, I think the crew in Munster has taken notice. Maybe we don't need to stand in a line all day to get a world-class stout?",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bum732,3.78,"Pours a thick luscious body, dark tan creamy head, not much retention. Smells of strong bourbon, rich dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, soft coffee notes and brown sugar. Tastes of bourbon like sweetness, rich milk chocolate on the backbone. Some cake batter tastes as well. Slight bitterness leads to more bourbon and milk chocolate sweetness. Touch of roastiness, bourbon sweet finish. Faint oak throughout. Slight alcohol presence. Rich full body.  A very bold beer, very sweet and very bourbony. Was difficult to drink, the bourbon was quite strong and the sweetness did not help much, almost cloying. I would've preferred a little more bitterness to bring some balance to it. That said, this is a very rich, sweet, dessert like beer that is a wonderful sipper.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,WYVYRN527,4.32,"Vintage 2008. 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Black as night with a very short-lived tan head. A thin tan line is still visible around the edges. Also has thin lacing, as to be expected with a beer as strong as this.  S: At first, alcohol is dominant, but as the beer warms a bit the aromas pop. Coffee, chocolate, and roasty malt show beautifully. The oak aging lends hints of coconut, vanilla, and toasty wood.  T: This stout is packed with flavor. Coffee, chocolate, molasses, and dark fruit notes shine through. The oak lends it's distinct flavors with hints of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, and maple. The finish is boozy and warming.  M: Full-bodied and as viscous as motor oil, BCS is chewy and rich.  D: This beer is big, and full of complex flavors, but it's quite easy to drink. Two years old may still be a bit young. It has some serious aging potential.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ufotofuturo,4.56,"One of my friends was generous enough to let me split one of these with him, and I couldn't be more impressed. Pours thick and oil-black. Pleasant bourbon odor, with an assertive, boozy presence. Rich, complex, and incredibly delicious, with hints of chocolate, oak, and a dozen other elements I couldn't possibly place. I don't feel like my knowledge of beer is sufficient to review this one. Suffice it to say that it's entirely awesome. Buy it if you get a chance.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Chico1985,4.37,"Sat on this 12 ouncer for a few months. Not quite ready to open my BA Stout Trooper so I figured I'd have a different barrel-aged beer. Pours thick and black, a dark brown pinky-size head. Quickly reduced to a small swirling cap and thick ring around the edge, understandable for the ABV. Leaves minimal lacing. Bourbon is quite apparent in the smell, huge vanilla and dark malt scents, some caramel. Much of the same in the taste, lots of bourbon and vanilla with heavy dark roasted malts. Alcohol is definitely hot on the tongue and throat, it shows every bit of it's 13%, and it is kind of a deterrent. Some age must do wonders for this beer as many reviewers can attest. Mouthfeel is pretty incredible, very thick and silky smooth, reminds me of Kate the Great almost. It would probably get a 5 in that category if it wasn't so hot with booze. A bit more caramel helps lightens things up later on in the taste. Drinkability is low for me, the booze is still way too hot and present in every sip. It's definitely a quality brew and I will be buying a 4-pack to age, I've read it takes at least a year for it to really shine. But for now it's a bit too hot to place in the tier of excellence.  EDIT - Found a couple '08s, cracked one open tonight (5/9/10). Bottle date is 10-21-08 so this is over 18 months old. Head disappears in the blink of an eye. Booze is still just as present in the nose, but the taste has definitely mellowed out. Alcohol is still obviously there but doesn't burn the throat anymore. The mouthfeel and taste are better now, has a new level of thickness and complexity, more of a burnt chocolate taste than I remember being present in the fresh bottle. Pairs good with some neopolitan ice cream. Though the booze is still a bit hot for my liking, this is drinking very well as of 18 months. I have one more '08 and four '09s...looking forward to trying them over the next 4-5 years.  **1/26/15 - Woah even more notes! Tried a 2009 last night pre-blizzard, just over 5 years old, very impressive. Excellent bourbon and chocolate character, very smooth but still with that trademark warming alcohol. Low-but-there carbonation. Split it 3 ways, this is one tough 12oz solo if you ask me. Very happy that it's doing this well at this point. I have another '09 that I'll give another year or so.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,biglite351,2.34,"A - pitch black which was nice but two glasses drew no head at all.  S - whisky, whisky and maybe a little whisky.  T - has more actual stout like flavor than most other bourbon barrel brews that I have tried in the past. There seems to be a little fruity flavor coming through, almost like raisins. Bourbon hit on the top of the mouth.  M - mild coating. Alcohol burn in throat. After a few drinks the front sides of the tongue get a numb tingle.  D - I do not care for hard alcohol so I would not be drinking this.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Some dark chocolate, malt & smokey aromas as well. The initial taste is hot...very bold bourbon taste followed by bitter chocolate, hints of vanilla & molasses. Leaves a burning alcohol sensation on your lips...the entire taste linger for a bit. AWSOME! Medium carbonation. Goes down smooth and creamy. Definitely a sipping beer.

1549,10672,AmberMan22,4.62,"Second time I've had a beer like this, and I found this GI to be far better than KBS. At least I have another bottle of that stuff to give it a chance at redemption.  This really is a story of two drinks merged wonderfully into one.  Pours a rather menacing black/super-dark-brown color that immediately looks like trouble, just seeing it swill around in the glass. Barely even got a look at the head though, it was gone so fast.  Smell was quite potent, and my nose is stuffed up from allergies. The smell of barrel-aged bourbon is immediately overwhelming -- like I'm looking into a glass of finely smelling tar. That yields gracefully to a subtle chocolate scent, thick and malty.  Taste is quite good -- as I said earlier, it's like 2 drinks in 1. The bourbon hits first, smooth, refined, silky, boozy. The stout comes next, sliding in quietly, but asserting flavors of chocolate, vanilla sweetness, and a boatload of malt.  Drinking this was a pleasure. Thick yet silky mouthfeel make this such a winner.

The first time I had this was a few years back at GABF and I remember it being one of the best I'd ever had. Time and distance has not changed my opinion much. Huge bourbon aromas on the nose, extremely boozy, with some cocoa powder, vanilla and tobacco. Huge bourbon again on the palate, along with roasted malt, coffee, vanilla and lots of warming alcohol.

Topped by a large-ish fizzy dark tan head that quickly dissipates, leaving a completely still-looking beer.  Oh, what a nose. Loaded with charred oak, roasted grain, earthy dark chocolate, boozy vanilla, ash and smoke, tobacco, wood, a bit of candied fruit, and just a fleeting hint of resinous pine-like hops. Dense. Wow.  And even denser on the palate. Bourbon-soaked wood, roasted grain, char, and a definite fire-breathing alcohol burn. It's almost a chore to take a sip, but what a pleasant chore. There's an underlying current of sweet caramel that keeps the big boy flavors from being too oppressive. Still a palate bruiser.  Thick and sticky, and so heavy. Moderately soft, but firm enough. Perfectly balanced between sweet bourbon and roasty imperial stout, never leaning too far in either direction.

M- Not nearly as heavy as I would have thought, was pleasantly suprised that is wasn't like motor oil based upon the initial aroma.  D-If it wasn't for the high alcohol content (and price) I could drink this all night long!

1549,10672,Jeffo,3.64,"This bottle was picked up in Chicago.  From a bomber into a snifter Vintage: 2009  APPEARANCE: Pours out black, but not quite pitch black. The pour produces a cascading ½ finger mocha colored head that magically appears out of nowhere. Jet black body with minimal carbonation for the style. Head quickly fades to nothing and a ring around the edges of the glass. A slight ring remains until the end and leaves no lacing. Looks good for the style, but the lack of lace keeps from going any further.  SMELL: Lots of bourbon in the nose with vanilla, sweet cream and oak notes. Bourbon and more bourbon, though there is a slight hint of roasted malts in there too, but this is all about the bourbon. Very bold and quite well done.  TASTE: Lots of bourbon again here. Follows the nose exactly. Vanilla, oak, and some sweet milk chocolate, with a mild yet present roasted malt base. A big, bold, and lingering aftertaste with plenty of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate notes, and a good dose of alcohol. A very boozy barrel aged stout for sure, with a good dose of alcohol after the swallow. The barrel is definitely king here, but it seems to work.  PALATE: Here's where the beer falters. Very thin and light for the style. Not creamy or smooth enough, lots of prickly carbonation, and somewhat airy on the palate. Goes down fine, but is abrasive at the swallow with a bit of a burn. Very hot, lots of heat on this one, and finishes slightly sticky. Definitely needs a bigger body and could tone down the heat a bit.  OVERALL: There's no making a mistake about this one. This is a bourbon barrel aged stout, and it won't let you forget it. While the appearance was nothing spectacular and the feel somewhat off-putting, the nose and taste were done really well. Bold flavors that don't seem out of place, with lots of nuances going on throughout the whole drinking experience. There are some other bourbon BA stouts that fit the bill for their subtle complexities, but this is an in-your-face bourbon stout that will grab hold of you and not let go. If the palate were a little thicker and fuller, this would be one for to write home about. For now, it's just one to check out if you get the chance.

A mote of smokiness and the distinct tang of bourbon make for a very memorable flavor.  Mouthfeel - Viscous and smooth, there is a light creaminess balanced by moderate carbonation.

1549,10672,oberon,4.07,"Bottled on 11/13/09.Finally a chance to try this,it has escaped my grasp a few times.Poured deep as an oil slick,no light showing through this puppy,a thinner dark mocha colored head atop.Powerful oaky bourbon notes in the nose,notes of vanilla and some alcohol dipped dark fruit became stronger as the beer warmed.Bourbon is the big flavor component on the palate,vanilla tinged and oaky,there is a slight buttery-rum flavor in the fisnish as well.This will warm the insides thats for sure,its a young bottle and its powerful,a great beer to sip on,who its warm in here right now.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,smcolw,3.58,"I'm unimpressed with this beer's look: Even with a violent pour, there is nearly no head. And what's there, dies to a single layer of minute bubbles on the edge. Nearly black in color, no light shines through (even on the edges).  Strong alcohol smells of sherry and port. Sweet and rich to the nose, almost as if there's an apertif added to this beer.  It tastes like a port-induced dark beer. It doesn't have the typical stout flavors of coffee and chocolate. Lots of sweet plum (like Japanese plum wine) and no bitterness. The swallow and aftertaste shows off the high alcohol content--very warming to the tongue and stomach. Rich like cream in the body, almost oily. Very low carbonation.  This is an after-dinner sipping beer. I believe it is closer to taste and feel to an overpowered barley wine. It's like no other stout I've ever had. All this said, it's very tasty but not for the faint of heart. Worth seeking out for the unusual flavors present.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,wd40,4.33,"2008 bottle Fantastic beer. Pitch black opaque appearance. Very little foam (perhaps because of age?). Smell would be stronger if there was more carbonation, but what is there is great. Bourbon aroma fairly strong (which I like), and lots of raison (perhaps even a little plum). Slightly raw alcohol taste which I marked off for a little. Strong sweet backbone to counter the bitterness of the alcohol. The rawness of the alcohol is reminiscent of bourbon, so perhaps it is appropriate. The carbonation was quite low, but nice. It is a sipping beer for me because of the raw alcohol and very very sweet maltiness. Interesting beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,carlborch,4.7,"Poured ink/black with a 1.5 inch thick, dark tan head, that dissipates with an obvious crackling. My glass is beer clean! The initial nose suggests smoke, bourbon and wet wood. Medium high, silky body with extensive lingering and delicious hints of chocolate, coffee, dark caramel and bourbon-macerated dried figs. The lace is mostly absent, excepting a few clusters of small spots that slide into into the stout. Density is high! The alcohol is evident and warming. I imagine it would be excellent in a snifter. Drink with care and devotion. The subsequent nose reminds me of Gethsemane Chocolate Bourbon Fudge. Although it is a warm sprig day outside, the Bourbon County Brand Stout makes me think of winter and roaring fires.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,anneseg,2.75,Reading all of these other reviews I suspect that I got a bad bottle or something. It was essentially impossible to get a head on the beer during the pour. The overwhelming smell was of bourbon. The taste was also dominated by bourbon and a hot alcohol taste. There was some peat flavor but it was difficult to taste.  Overall not impressed but would be open to trying again since I usually have good experiences with Goose Island.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kcdc,4.82,"I've never been blown-away by the other Goose Island brews I've tried, but the Bourbon County Stout is definitely an exception. It's rather pricey--I paid &gt; $5 for one 12 oz bottle. However, it was definitely worth it. At %13 ABV, one bottle goes a long way. Even before pouring it, I could smell the warm bourbon aroma from the bottle. When I tasted it, the bourbon flavor was solid, but not overwhelming. I could still taste the chocolate and caramel notes as well. Overall, this is one of best stouts I've ever had.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,etenbus,4.15,"Finally pulled this out after my book went back to the publisher. It's a 2008 bottle from Gomer's in Lee's Summit, MO, which has the best beer selection I have ever enjoyed.  Poured silky jet black and no light is allowed into this black hole of beer. Only the thinnest caramel colored head laced the top of the oil-colored liquid.  The aroma is complex. It is musty. It is sweet. There is a slight bourbon aroma, but certainly not overwhelming. It really does not have a coffee-expresso aroma like most stouts, but more of a candied sugar aroma.  The taste is where all the hype is. At first the taste is imperial stout with burned caramel, tobacco, espresso and a flat bitterness. It's oily and slathers over the tongue. The charred oak comes in the aftertaste and holds in place for some time. The alcohol is not over-present, but it is certainly warming. There is a lingering, almost burning sensation that sticks around like a hot pepper (or maybe that was Jalapeno doritos I just downed). But it wouldn't be out of place in such an ale.  The mouthfeel is very soft with little to no carbonation.  This stout gets on top of you quickly at 13%. I'm pleased with the experience.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Wisconsinality,4.4,"2009 12oz bottle poured into Sprecher snifter.  A- Pours the deepest of black with very minimal head that gathers around the edge of the glass. A good stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass on the side. The head is mocha and leaves ok lacing on the side of the glass.  S- Strong bourbon right away. A little vanilla and some malt happen to peek in there just a little bit. A hint of oak and some black licorice. The bourbon is strong but not overpowering and the alcohol becomes a tad more prevalent with some warming.  T- Smooth bourbon, vanilla and some charred oak. A little bit of tasted malt and some sweetness in there as well. The bourbon is really rich and smooth. Again, like the nose, it is dominant but not overpowering. The alcohol makes itself known but it can be expected at 13%.  M- Full bodied and very smooth. A good amount of carbonation for the style. I would sum it up as rich, just coats the tongue. A nice warming sensation as it goes down.  D- One and done for sure but this is almost as good as it comes. Great flavor profile and a rich smoothness make this the perfect sipper. I have two in the cellar and can't wait to see how this one turns out in a year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ChrisPro,4.48,"Bottle from Malt & Vine. Tasted blind as 1 of 15 in May, 2009. Pours black with only a little mocha head. Great aroma with smoke, borubon, chocolate and caramel. Nice sweet flavor of bourbon, chocolate and molasses with nice bitter balance. Slick, medium body with great finish. This was the highlight of the night.  (note: have had '07,'08 and '09 vintages and this definitely gets better with age as it loses some of the bourbon hotness)  Edit on 2/9/11: Goose Island Bourbon County Stout Cliff's Notes. opened a 3-year vertical in December with a friend.  2010: Amazing bourbon, vanillla, molasses and oak aroma; though a bit too boozy to really put down 22 oz.  2009: seems like 1 year is an off year. The arom is a bit dull with hints of coconut and chocolate, but not much going on.  2008: While this doesn't have the amazing aroma of the fresh 2010, the beer pakcs a punch of flavor of molasses, chocolate, vanilla, with hints of licorice and soy.  Overall, seems like this beeer could go 2+ but 1 year is a strange develpmental stage or just the '09 was off.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,levifunk,4.38,"Amazing beer. I recently picked up 2 bombers. Opened the first one last night for a friends birthday, and am cellaring the other. appearance was BLACK as oil. Smell was chocolate/caramel and Bourbon! True to its smell and name, the bourbon was definitely there in the taste. It wasn't overpowering (I can only imagine how smooth this will be after some aging), but a friendly reminder of the power in this beer. After a few drinks I could feel the warmth too. I think i'll open the other when winter comes.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A-Black with a thin dark mocha head that held on strong and left spotty lace.  S-HUGE, rich, massive bourbon and chocolate notes along with a hit of alcohol heat that singes the nares.  T-BOURBON, rich chocolate, heat and then mellowing raisin and plum---Mmmm  M-Medium-heavy bodied and maple syrup slick smooth. This is like liquid velvet, simple awesome.  D-This 9 month old bottle proves that the original bourbon barrel aged stout is still one of the best! With a bit more aging and mellowing this WILL become a masterpiece.

1549,10672,fropones,4.64,"A - Pours a nice black with no light around the edges and minimal mocha head.  S - Woo, just as expected, a beer who's first word in the name is bourbon, reaks of bourbon (in a great way). Some caramel, vanilla, oak, molasses, and just a hint of soy sauce.  T - More of that delicious bourbon flavor with some unsweetened chocolate, chocolate covered espresso beans, smoke, oak, and a good amount of sweetness. Almost no hops detectable, but that's quite alright.  M - Big bodied, slick and mouth coating, chewy, smooth carbonation. Creamy.  D - Drink very well for 13 %. Alcohol has a nice warming effect to it. Delicious.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Josievan,4.57,"Appearance: Bourbon County Stout pours a sexy jet black. This beer, along with Founders Breakfast Stout, are the most opaque beers I've ever encountered. Describing beers as having the consistency of motor oil is probably overused, but here it is absolutely warranted. The head is a dark brown, always a good sign. However, this dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing.  Smell: The aroma is quite boozy, with the bourbon-aging coming through well. Caramel and vanilla are also present.  Taste: Wow, this has to be one of the most complex beers I've ever tasted! There's just so much going on. A glorious array of flavors cascade across the palate. Each sip seems to bring forth new and different delights. There's soft vanilla, woodiness, and booze from the bourbon. Then there's caramel and toffee notes from the malt. Dark fruit even seems to be in the mix.  Through all of this, the beer manages to be surprisingly sweet. There is also some cereal flavor, which is rare for a stout. The alcohol is certainly present, but is not obtrusive. Going by the taste, I would have guessed this to be in the 8-9% range, not as high as 13%.  Mouthfeel: BCS's body is as thick as molasses, quite viscous. It's also much smoother than one might have guessed for 13%.  Drinkability: This is a slow sipper by necessity, to be sure. But it is so delicious that I wish this weren't the case.  Notes: I believe this is the highest alcohol content beer that I've yet tried. It is a feat that the alcohol here is not as harsh as many beers with much lower ABVs. The alcohol provides a nice warming effect in the belly more than it is exhibited in the taste or mouthfeel.  I haven't had too many Goose Island beers that I've been truly impressed with, but Bourbon County Stout by itself solidifies the brewery as one of the great American breweries. I look forward to future opportunities to consume this rare treat. Bourbon County Stout is a true delicacy.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dogfishandi,4.47,"12oz bottle pours black, one of the darkest black ive prolly ever seen. a small layer of brown mocha colored head that is completely gone within a couple minutes. a little lacing, more of a brown film on the glass. id like to go a little low on the appearence rating because of the lack of head, but the super dark color brings me to a 3.5.  the first thing your hit with in the aroma is the big alcohol, somewhat solvent like. some bourbon like whiskey aromas seem to blend in with the alcohol. the booze really makes it hard to pick out much in the aroma. theres some deeply roasted malts, a little dark chocolate, whiskey, anise, and a touch of vanilla and burnt marshmallows.  such a wonderful taste, truly top notch. boozy and strong - yes, but in a totally good way, the alcohol seems to meld so nicely with the rest of the flavors. soo much going on, so much i dont even have words for. i just blurt them out in no paticular order- heavily roasted malts, dark dark chocolate, woody smokiness, cocoa, bourbon whiskey, hints of vanilla, anise, raisons, figs, dried dark fruits, burnt marshmallow. finishs o so chocolaty and bitter. i feel as though most of my RIS taste reviews are very similar, but this one really just does it for me. again, theres a lot i dont have words for, complexity to say the least.  lovin the mouthfeel, big, strong, chewy, smooth, velvity. very light light carbonation with a big huge body. just seems to linger, all sorts of different flavors appear and dissappear in the time after you sip.  i really hate to even judge a thing like drinkability for this beer. its all so great, but just like any big RIS, you cant take too much of it, sits in the stomach real heavy. but put that and the ABV aside, i would drink as much of this as my stomach would let me. putting the huge cost of this beer aside of course. the price of this beer was definatly holding me back for awhile, but im glad i finally came around, because this is definatly at the top of my list. go get it! dont be scared!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This bottle, even with a 3in top straight down pour produces a 1/10th finger head that was a dark brown/amber.  Smell - Full and warm. Sweet but rich with a dense natural vanilla and dark caramel notes.  Taste - The smoke from the insides of the charred white oak barrels really comes through in this beer. The taste is permeating and long lasting. Round but direct, it gives slight hints of raisin of fig with undertones of rich dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel - Almost sticky. It lets you know it's there with an overpowering presence. Coats and warms the mouth.  Drinkablility- If you've got the money for it and it's cold enough enough outside.

Smells of bourbon, oak, vanilla and a hint of chocolate and some more bourbon. Taste follows the smell, but I have to say this the most balanced beer I've had at this ABV. Starts out with a good balance of chocolate, oak, vanilla and bourbon and fades nicely into a bourbon finish with a touch of coffee and an alcohol warmth. For the ""ABV"" this beer is very drinkable and I have to say it measures up with the best of the bourbon aged stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,tippebrewcrew2,4.15,This is a pretty big brew. At 13 abv it hides a good deal of it. Pours a beautiful black oil with a dark brown head. There is just a punch in the face of coffee and chocolate. Upfront dark chocolate the smoothes to the back of the palate then turns into a dark bitter chocolate with a long bitter finish. The texture is velvet. Good brew.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,zoolzoo,4.3,"2009 Vintage, Duvel Snifter  A: Black. Not a huge head even with an aggressive pour, what did develop was mocha in color, less than a finger. I know this description is becoming hackneyed, but it looks like an oil slick in the glass. Blah!  S: This smells like a shot of whiskey, really. Upon further inspection, theres some chocolate in there, anise, some coffee. Many of the usual suspects regarding stout aromas are represented well, but bourbon, booze, and charred something, dominates the nose, without a doubt.  T: Much more complex, and pleasing than the smell. Bourbon nails you first, hits pretty hard. The bourbon mellows quickly and reveals chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla, dark fruits - all the good stuff. I have to mention how sweet this is, definitely a sugar bomb. Finish is dry and bitter, almost completely abrasive to the tongue and throat - further reinforcing the notion that this is a SIPPER. Alot of nuttiness in the after taste.  M: Thick!! Oily, syrupy....  D: For what it is, I guess BCS is pretty drinkable. Although, given the ABV and flavor profile Im having a tough time finishing a 12oz myself (your mileage may vary). Id rather split this between 2 or 3 people.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TCgoalie,4.5,"The pour is pitch black with a very nice brown head that quickly hides into the black abyss. A bit of agitation makes this foam come back, very nice.  Lots and lots of booze in the smell. It seems to cover up some of the other flavors that are trying to come through. There is some roasted peanuts, bourbon, and chocolate in there somewhere. I'm also picking up some smoky undertones.  Wow, this is very rich and delicious. The sweet bourbon taste seems to be up front in the taste with a lot of chocolate bitterness and smoky, toasted marshmallow balancing the back end.  This is a big boy that is extremely thick and sticky. I almost need a chaser of water to cleanse my mouth after each sip, it really sticks around.  Is this drinkable, oh yes. I want to keep drinking it to explore its complexity. 1 will be enough for the evening as any more would weigh me down.

1549,10672,dougofthefuture,4.59,"I think it is time to review this. One of my first ""great"" beers I had a chance to try. This one is a 2008, and one of the first beers I put in my cellar. Poured into my tulip.  A - Almost pure black - small amount of head faded quickly. Bubbles are closer to white than brown. Great legs, but minimal lacing.  S - This smells like heaven. Well, I'm not sure heaven smells like booze. If heaven does have a boozy smell, it would probably be a mellow, warming, sweet bourbon roasted malty stout smell like this.  T & M - Style defining. This was my first barrel aged beer, and it still might be the best balanced. At just over a year old, these flavors are coming together perfectly. Just the right level of bourbon combined with a rich creamy body of dark malt. If I were to nitpick, I would say it is slightly acidic.  D - The 13% isn't hidden, but highlighted. The warm burn is the perfect finish to an intense beer.

1549,10672,jmbranum,4.9,"(this is a tasting of a 2008 vintage bought in Junction City, Kansas)  Quite possibly the best beer I've had in my life. A singular experience in beer tasting, where stout, fine bourbon and a meritage wine meet.  Glorious beautiful dark brown beer with giant fluffy dark tan head that lasts forever.  Intense strong aroma. The flavor is very complex. I get some fruity wine like notes, lots of dark chocolate, some creamyness, some coffee. There is also lots of alcohol. I swear there must be some of the ""angel's share"" from the bourbon barrel that has made into this brew, as there is some toasty wood. Fresh vanilla bean.  Mouthfeel is from another planet. Smooth but rich texture. Velvety on the tongue.  The only possible negative I can think of on this beer is drinkability. This is 13% alcohol (as a strong as a big california red wine) so two 12 oz bottles is enough to get you snockered. This beer is one for slow sipping.  But boy it is so, so good. This beer good enough to make skeptics believe in the divine. It really is that good. Beer this good is a gift of the gods. On the other hand, my theology might be fueled by the high alcohol.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - Strong Bourbon smell is immediately and almost over-whelimgly present. Wow! Prunes and raisins, some anise and some woody hints. Very complex beer. Vanilla spice and some chocolate. Very Boozy and very delicious.  T & M - Creamy and oily with some strong, very strong bourbon flavors. tons of maple syrup, vanilla, chocolate and nice spices as well. Oaky flavors match well with the aromas. My taste buds are on overdrive! Complex and delicious beer. As the beer goes down a warming almost burning aftertaste engulfs my throat and tongue.

1549,10672,Flashsp2,4.44,"Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout  Poured into a wide mouth stem glass from a 12 oz brown twist-off.  Generated a deep brown head with minimal retention, even with a pretty aggressive pour. Darker than a black hole, this brew draws the light out of the room. Around the edges a very minimal amount of light breaks through to reveal a deep red. Very scary stuff.  Roasty, BIG bourbon, some pruny notes, smoky-charred oak, lots of booze, faint vanilla on the nose. Incredible complexity.  Taste is immense, even compared to other impy stouts. First wave is prune, then smoke, sweet caramel malts, some roastyness, and a big lingering oak on the finish. Some vanilla sits on the palette after the swallow, along with some bourbon as well. Dark chocolate-chunk cookies. So much bourbon, but not overpowering. Alcohol is there, but not as much as would be expected for 13% ABV,hidden quite well. All the flavors come in waves, and even though they are intense, they create a great balance. A bit of dark bitter chocolate hiding in the background. It leaves a candied rum-raisin sweetness on the lips, which makes for a pleasant finish to the intense dark flavors of this brew.  Mouthfeel is dense, like eating a can of motor oil. Big chewy maltyness, oilyness, almost like syrup. It coats the mouth and throat on the way down. Full bodied.  Notes: This beer is borderline mind boggling. It's like a bourbon-chocolate milk shake; so thick, so many intense flavor profiles. This is definitely once an evening. Actually, more like once a month so your mind can readjust to normal beers again. This is a beer that you can only pull out on someone who really digs big beers, otherwise you are just going to scare the crap out of somebody.

1549,10672,BBThunderbolt,4.2,"This brew really hits the target on how to do bourbon barrel beer. The beer poured solid black and thick. There was no head, but perhaps a touch of legs on the side of the glass.  The aroma was a nice, balanced blend of beer and bourbon. The bourbon was noticeable but not overpowering, and the roast and malt scents provided a solid base. The flavor was dialed in even better than the aroma. The bourbon came solid across the tongue and seemed at first like it would dominate. The roasty, toasty, malty base beer proved to be an even match for the bourbons strength. This was the best tasting bourbon beer I've yet had.  The only thing I can say about the body and drinkability is, Very Fucking Good.  Goose Island really got this beer right.

The lace was lacking, but the cascading effects of the bubbles when tilted from side-to-side is amazing. This is a big, dark brew. Just how I like them!  The smell is bourbon smores; bourbon, chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker. Need I say more?  I believe in the smell, taste and mouthfeel, this beer has been brewed perfectly. There is no flaw!  The taste is bourbon, raisin, graham cracker marshmallow, chocolate, dates, some plum and plenty of alcohol. Perfect! Better than The Abyss, Short's cup of Joe, Stone IRS, Ten Fidy, Czar, Rasputin XII, and comparable to Peche Mortel. Fucking amazing, once again.  The feel is thick but goes down smoothly.

Mouthfeel: Appropriate carbonation. Spicy overtones really light up the taste-buds, the mouth really feels alive even minutes after you swig. Drinkability: The overwhelming aroma and flavor are great for taste but really slow the process, unless you have some time and a cigar on your schedule.

These all blend together into a delicious aroma bouquet that asks to be drank.  Taste: The taste very closely matches the nose, which is nice: slightly bitter notes up front, followed quickly by sweet roasted malt and vanilla, alcohol, raisins, prunes, and blends together with oak and finished with strong bitterness. Aftertaste is bready and satisfying. The flavor is all around huge, couldn't get much bigger without being too intense. But this is just right all around, super fun to drink.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with good however light carbonation. Alcohol is warming and activates the taste buds but doesn't overpower.  Drinkability: For the strength and intensity of the flavors this beer is exceptionally drinkable.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Gets stronger as I get my nose into it. Smell stays throughout, even as it warms.  T: Wow. Lots going on. Bourbony booze is the most obvious thing, both in the nose and the initial impression on the palate. Finishes with heat felt at the back of the mouth and down the gulley. There's also dark dried fruit -- raisins and raisiny port -- and molasses. After each sip, I get just a touch of chocolate -- milk chocolate, not dark chocolate -- on the front of the tongue.  M: Full-bodied. Slightly -- and surprisingly -- creamy. Better in feel as it warms (or maybe just because I've become acustomed to the boozy taste and hot feel).  D: OK. A sipper.

1549,10672,ffejherb,4.74,"On tap at Sunset Grill, Boston, MA on 3/1/10.  A - Appeared as an oily abyss of utter blackness with a sliver of burnt tan head that diminished further into a thin ring around the edge of the glass, leaving very little lace behind.  S - On the surface, BCS slams your olfactory with equal parts bourbon and vanilla, resulting in a tempting sweet and boozy aroma. Underneath it all lies a crispy malt character and a hint of milk chocolate. Easily one of the most pleasant and aromatic bourbon beers on the market.  T - Delicious concoction of lush vanilla and warm bourbon with hints of puffed rice-like malt, chocolate notes and toasted grains. Finishes with an earthy hop presence and bitter chocolate notes.  M - Oily and viscous with a warm, boozy character and bristly carbonation resulting in lots of friction on the tongue. Finishes with plenty of bitterness and some alcohol heat on the palate.  D - While the ""B"" aspect of BCS does indeed provide quite a healthy dose of alcohol warmth, it still drinks like a champ for a huge 13% Imperial Stout. This is a beautiful beer, no doubt about it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Steamhead,4.7,"First of all, this beer is a mainstay in my rotation...an almost perfect default nightcap when only one beer is needed. It has been an angelic presence in the freezing winter. A companion through many hours of fireside contemplation. On the right night it becomes almost effortless in drinkability even remarkably balanced. Into the glass pours a none-more-black oil that slowly generates an espresso crema-esque layer of carbonation on the surface. The smell is akin to walking down a hall of kitchens. Impressions of chocolate brownies, bourbon balls, coffee cake, and burnt brown sugar atop a just torched creme brulee fill the mind. The spectrum of scents is so incredible that it could be a vapor course at Moto. The taste demands an hour's repose. Dark, bitter chocolate precedes the vanilla, caramel, smoke and charred notes of fine bourbon. Dried cherries and raisins form in a holy alliance with classic stout traits of coffee and cream. It is thick enough to be a foodstuff. The finish makes me wonder how they bottled silk? This particular day I paired with a 2007 Kentucky Black Gold cigar aged in Woodford barrels for two years. The earthy, mellow notes meld flawlessly with the rich, smoky character of the brew. Yes, this certainly is the greatest cigar beer in the world. And this is why I always have a few cases around. Cheers to Greg Hall and Goose Island, 2009 is the best Bourbon County Stout of all.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jtrem14,4.47,"Poors a rich dark brown, with almost no head. That little amount of head quickly subsides into the body, making it look a bit flat. No lacing on the glass at all.  At first you are hit with the very distinct bourbon aroma, and then that quickly moves to a dark roasted malty smell and then finishes with the sweetness of brownsugar/molasses and raisins.  The taste is much of the same as the aroma. The woodiness of the bourbon barrels really comes through and injects its tongue numbing wonderful taste to the front end. Then the sweet flavors begin to take over as the raisins and molasses are really pronounced. You also get a subtle bit of nuttyness and toffee flavors.  It comes in to your mouth a bit strong, as I mentioned the tongue numbing. However, that is only briefly and very welcome (to me) as it is followed by a rich and smooth texture that I would expect in a stout.  While this is a very boozy beer, it is very easy to drink for me. I love bourbon and stouts. The two pair very nicely for me and I could definitely sit back and drink this on any given night.  great brew",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell: sweet alcohol, molasses, wood, raisin, dark cherry  Taste: sweet alcohol, molasses, chocolate, anise, moderate bitterness -- but only on the back end  Mouthfeel: thinner than I expected but creamy. Low carbonation but nice fine bubbles.  Drinkability: a bit low due to the alcohol and sweetness. I'm sharing one and I still think we might have trouble finishing it. Cooling it down didn't really help.  It's hard for me to rate this. I don't go head-over-heels for these sweet, huge ABV stouts. I like it, but it's hard for me to enjoy much more than 5-10 sips. If I could buy a 12 oz bottle to share, or if I tasted a few sips of it at a friend's house, I'd probably rate this higher... . But when I spend $13 on a bomber, I feel like I need to finish it.

1549,10672,SLeffler27,4.47,"The head barely covers the opaque dark walnut, almost black beer with a fire of ruby red highlights. This one has true legs that suspend above the level for a long while. The label art adds a touch of class too.  The bourbon reaches out from a long distance to announce the sweet chocolate beer with licorice and espresso notes. Cherry and oak come up with the alcohol fumes released with a quick swirl, and as it warms, rich chocolate fudge come out.  The snifter glass showcases the chocolate and bourbon nicely. The malts are a bit roasted, enough to bring some bitterness out for a long finish. The flavors unfold in layers as it warms. Just superb.  Smooth and creamy, with a light prickly carbonation within a full body dry beer. Each sip builds another layer of sticky residue on the lips. The alcohol is a prominent and additive player, not just present for effect.  Sit back and sip this one as a companion to a book, cigar, or deep conversation. BCS lives up to its reputation. I was also fortunate enough to find this on draught, and while still excellent, the bottled version was superior.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Reaper16,4.25,"2009 12oz. bottle served into a snifter  Pours the deepest shade of brown you'll ever see. This beer isn't black, it is too brown around the edges to give that color impression. This being a 13% ABV beer I'm not going to fault it for only having the thinnest smear of tan foam at its peak and quickly reducing to nothing at all.  Lots of strong aromas to this one (like anyone would expect otherwise). Malt smells like baking cookies -- sugar and semisweet chocolate chips -- ground the boozy, rich bourbon aromas. Considerable bourbon; watch out. Some nutty scents play with a subtle twinge of vanilla. Many people would score this 4.5 but I'm not simply impressed because of a spirit aroma presence. This is definitely good but it doesn't amaze me.  The first thing that I notice is that the alcohol heat has calmed down considerably in just five months or so. Bourbon is still the strongest, most prominent flavor in this beer but it doesn't overwhelm everything else. The dark fruits are able to peek through and get to interact with the vanilla. There is some light oak from the barrels but it is light. Unfortunately that light oak taste is the closest thing that BCS gets to providing balance to all the malty, boozy sweetness. Everything works though. Everything works very well.  Bourbon County Stout has a chewiness indicative of most nice imperial stouts. Such a toothsome, silky feel is a nice choice to highlight all the sweet flavors that the beer brings. It isn't so thick as to by syrupy, however, which is nice. As far as drinkability goes, well, it is kind of hard to rate a 13% ABV beer as highly drinkable. But this beer, at this stage and in the future, isn't too hot from alcohol. It is delicious. And you can drink a 12oz. bottle by yourself without getting off-your-rocker inebriated.  Everyone knows how good this stout is. It appears to be getting better year after year, as this five-month old 2009 bottle is as good or better than the 2008 vintage right now. I'm excited to taste the coffee and vanilla versions releasing for the first time this year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Beer is solid engine oil black with a tiny bit of brown at the edges. No lacing or legs to speak of.  Smell: Huge aroma of roasted malt, caramel, coffee, chocolate, alcohol. Thick and rich. Definitely some oak character to the smell, with a slight hint of vanilla lurking in the background. Other subtle nutty notes as well. Promises a lot.  Taste: Follows the smell, which is to say that it tastes amazing. The taste is so smooth and deep. It starts off with a big hit of vibrantly rich malt, caramel, cake, and vanilla that moves beautifully into bourbon and hot alcohol in the finish. As I get deeper into the glass, the bourbon character starts to show itself within that big flavor explosion up front, which works really well. This is a special tasting stout. It's very light on the dark fruit (pretty much absent) and smoke, but huge on the deep roasted malt, bourbon, caramel, cake flavors. Tons going on, but all the flavors make sense together, and balance perfectly. I can't rate a taste like this below 5.0.  Mouthfeel: Very thick, but smooth and creamy rather than sticky or chewy. Hard to fathom something this heavy and bold never gets sticky, but it really doesn't. The mild/medium carbonation is felt up front and works perfectly to compliment that crazy hit of malty flavors that characterizes the beginning of every sip. Finishes very hot, but the alcohol doesn't dull the flavor or hurt the creaminess of the feel. Excellent.  Drinkability: Obviously I love this beer, but I can't see myself having it on anything but special occasions. This isn't because of the hefty $6-$7/12oz price tag either; beer this good merits spending money like that. It's more so that the beer is a powerhouse, and a special combination of flavors that's better for occasional enjoyment than regular consumption. Also, I think I would get a bit overwhelmed if I had this beer more than once a month.  There isn't much else to say in closing. Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout is just an expertly made beer, that hits soaringly high notes in aroma, taste, and mouthfeel. This is a beer to age for a few years and then bring out when you want to be especially decadent and indulgent. Absolutely delicious stout.  Note: I don't actually know how hard it is to find 2008 or below Bourbon County Stout, but at the moment the Whole Foods at Union Square has a bunch, all from 2008.

S: Huge bourbon aroma right up front, very dominant, but hints of vanilla, roasted chocolate malt, coffee and molasses are also present. Pretty complex.  T: Follows the nose, very dominated by the bourbon, but after awhile it almost seems to blow off and the beer becomes much more complex. Vanilla is also very big in the palate, hops are only present in the sense that the beer isn't cloying and is actually pretty well balanced for 13%. Excited to try this again after a few years in the bottle.  M: Heavy body with fairly smooth creamy carbonation, slightly oily.  D: Not as drinkable as it could be, a little heavy and despite the booze being almost unnoticeable it still has such a heavy bourbon element that it slows the drinking.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Just copy and paste into your browser. http://mikesbrewreview.com/review-of-goose-island-bourbon-county-stout-ep008/  I'm only going to say this once. I think packaging plays a huge role in craft beer taste testing and I know that when a beer is judged by the BJCP guidelines it is always a blind taste test. However, that is not what it is like going into the beer store. With all of the wacky packages and names, it is hard to sift through all the people yelling at me. So, I say it once, I think packaging is important to the average Joe beer drinker, so therefore, its going into my reviews from here on out.  Review of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout  Packaging  With a black, glossy, elegant package highlighted by just a touch of a yellowish brown, the package actually mimics the beer you are about to pour. If you are a stout fan, you'll look at this package and your mouth will start watering. The elegance makes paying $20 for it seem worth it. Its like buying a Mac vs a PC. You pay a lil more, but when you open the package up you feel like a kid on Christmas.  Appearance  The beer pours a deep black, and I mean black. You can not see through this one. The head on ours wasn't that good, but it could totally be the glasses, as I can see that it wants to be more. What is there almost mimics the package perfectly. Smell  The moment I opened the bottle I could smell the liquor steaming off this beer. It jumped right into my nose. After the liquor smell subsided I could smell the chocolate, roasted malts. There is very little hop aroma if any.  Taste  Amazing. The moment you drink it the bourbon comes through completely and overwhelms you right off the bat. After a drink or two though you start to taste the chocolate and coffee followed up by a vanilla after taste. It tastes a bit like Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, but with a lot of liquor and a more chocolate bitter taste. I did not taste a lot of oak. It was there, but I was more amazed with the bourbon and sweetness than I was the oak.  Mouthfeel  Its a bit thicker, but not terrible. Once it starts to warm up you get more of the thickness. The carbonation is light.  Drinkability  Depends on what you have going on the next day. I drank 2 and I was pretty much done. I had a good buzz going on and I could have easily switched into my regular whiskey water drinks. It is filling, but for a person who likes bourbon, this is a great dinner beer or night cap.  Overall  I definitely recommend this brew if you like whiskey, bourbon and stouts. One of the best ways I could describe this beer would be to take the syrup they use to mix up coke products, mix it with whiskey, and drink it. Its sweet and spicy with a bit of roasty bitterness. Totally worth the money.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DanielRP,4.1,"Bottle from Ølbutikken, Copenhagen. Brewed 2008. Served in a snifter.  Appearance: Dark and thick as the night. The foam is cocoa brown but disappears quickly (common among aged stouts).  Smell: Roasted nuts, mocca, a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Soft. Strong coffee/cocoa. Develops into dark syrup and walnuts going down your throat, warming your insides :-) 13% indeed.  Mouthfeel: Thick, hint of carbonatio, just right.  Drinkability: I feel the tingling alcohol sensation after just a few sips. The warmth in the throat exposes that it is not to be played around with. The creaminess makes it pleasant to drink, but there is enough taste to last. After a while this fact starts to settle in and the drinking goes really slow.  It's not miles away from Southern Tier Oat, with the added bourbon touch and less molasses. Both rank high personally, but I feel that I had to put more of an effort in to get this one down. Maybe I should share it if the opportunity for a next time comes.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,tturaiders,3.85,"Holy Bourbon, Batman!  Pours jet black and looks quite thick. Not much of a head but you do get a faint hint of brown around the edges.  Smells like Bourbon, believe it or not. You can also smell some chocolate, coffee, caramel, and alcohol.  Initially, I was slammed by Bourbon. After my first drink, I could distinguish some nice chocolate flavors but for me personally, it was a ton of Bourbon and quite sweet.  It's a very thick beer with hardly any carbonation at all. I know stouts don't have as much carbonation but this one seems to be lacking...ever for this style.  I did, in fact, enjoy the beer. I think over time, I'd probably enjoy it even more. The Bourbon and sweetness was just a bit too much for me to drink this very often.

A bottomless black with just the faintest glimmer of dark, dark brown on the edges. Light isn't getting through this one. Thankfully a finger's worth of head formed on an aggressive pour, reminding me that I wasn't in fact about to commit suicide via consumption of 10W30.  Smell: Wow, this is highly aromatic. The two B's are clearly in control here. Bourbon and booze, this is strong stuff. After taking a deep whiff I almost feel a slight burn in my nostrils. After the onslaught of alcohol in floats a plethora of scents. Dark chocolate, as in 85% cacao dark chocolate. Digging deeper you get hints of anise, espresso, dark fruits and even a touch of worn leather.  Taste: Have I mentioned this is a bourbon bomb? To the point where I feel like I'm sipping on a 12 oz. serving of Jim Beam. It's not as complex as the smell. The dark chocolate is still present. The anise is here as well. But the bourbon is more overpowering than it is in the smell and doesn't allow anything else to show itself.  Mouthfeel: Ridiculously thick and vicious to the point of it being syrupy. I never thought I'd say this, but I think it's too thick. I don't usually complain about carbonation, but even for a 13% beer it's extremely low.  Drinkability: As I said early it felt like having a 12 oz. serving of straight Kentucky Bourbon. When I crack my next bottle, I will be sharing this because to be honest I had trouble finishing this. It took me almost 2 hours to kill off the glass.  Overall I enjoyed the experience and there are certainly signs that this could become a good, even great beer with some age on it.

The chocolate and bourbon work well together. Neither is overpowering the other.  T: Mmmmm. Smooth, rich, nutty dark chocolate with the bourbon playing nicely and not taking over. Strangely enough I get a lot of coconut in this thing. All the flavors are very subtle. I have had 2 bourbon barrel aged stouts and many regular imperial ones. You know what? This tastes nothing like any beer I ever had before. The flavor is pure brilliance!  M: So smooth, silky and creamy. It is like drinking chocolate mousse.  D: Dangerously drinkable. I swear I cannot detect a hint of alcohol other than the bourbon notes. It does not even have that warming quality.  This stuff is black liquid gold.

Initial taste is that of raisins [and figs?] and fades into the warming bourbon flavoring. Slightly fruity at first then a woody alcohol permeates the palate.  Fairly thick. has a viscosity not unlike a syrup and coats the interior of the mouth in a wash of its flavors.  I agree with a few of the other posters: Almost TOO drinkable for its 13% abv.

Initial flavors of overripe fruits ala rasins, figs, and the like. Then steps in HUGE flavors of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, slight oakiness, nutty, roasty, molasses....absolutely phenomenal. This beer has one of the most amazing lingering aftertastes of any beer I have ever had. Mouthfeel is also ridiculous. Definitely one of the top 3 most viscous beers I have ever had as well.

I cannot stop smelling and tasting this beer, sip after sip...and that;s a dangerous thing at 13%. Definitely one of the most amazing beers I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.

However, left behind is a ring of head around the glass that sticks there when left alone. The lacing is a mix of curvilinear forms and medium-sized dots that linger for awhile.  S: Whoa, heavy on the bourbon, please. This beer's moniker is apt. What a great scent! Mixed in with the bourbon notes are roasted malts, vanilla, caramel, a little espresso, some good alcohol, and a great woodsy-v aroma.  T: The most important thing to note is just how big this flavor is. It has a huge bourbon and oak sweetness the blends pretty well with the darker espresso and acidic alcohol tastes. To be really picky, I would say that the component flavors do not meld together perfectly. There is just a slight disconnect in each flavor standing out from the others during the duration of the sip. The finish has a pretty heavy alcohol burn on the tongue and in the nose that is followed by a nice, dry, coffee-esque finish.  M: This really runs the gamut. It has at the same time a big creamy feel and a puckering acidity. This dichotomy is very stimulating to my brain and I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around how exactly I feel about it. After thinking a good while on it and taking another sip, I think that the bitter acidity overwhelms the creaminess just a little too much. I still enjoy it, though.  D: For all I have said about the conflicting duality of this beer, the drinkability is really quite good for a 13% Goliath.

Foam holds up pretty well and a good amount of lacing forms with each sip, but it doesn't stick around too long. As it warms the lacing sticks to the glass a lot better, though it disappears completely as I let it rest between sips.  S: Just a couple minutes out of the fridge, lots of oaky-vanilla booziness and a bit of sweet chocolate, a bit reminiscent of a tawny port (I drink more port than bourbon so that comes to mind more readily). A bit of warming reveals coffee and dark fruit, cherries I think- need to allow some more warming to get a better sense. A few more minutes of warming and now each sniff catches alternating aromas of chocolate covered cherries and chocolate covered raisins. Delightful. I continue to detect more aromas, but there's so much going on I can't quite decipher some of the other notes I'm sniffing. Rich caramel malt is one of them.  T: First few sips are all chocolate and booze. As it warms the booze settles a bit- though it's definitely still there- while the aromas of coffee and chocolate covered fruits make their way across the taste buds. The flavors continue to evolve as I make my way down the glass- bitter coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and dark cherries. So much going on but so well put together.  M: Thick and then some, very rich and fudgy. Wish I had a brownie or some kind of rich chocolaty dessert to go with it. The finish exhibits a pleasant bitterness from the coffee flavors (and presumably some hops) and lingers nicely from sip to sip. As thick as this brew is, BCS is also pleasantly smooth, with an oily slickness that follows step by step with the long finish.  D: What more can I say? Bourbon County Stout is so complex yet so well balanced. So many aromas, flavors and a complex finish/mouthfeel that all blend together with near flawless precision. It's almost perfect.... Almost.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Liverpool08,4.32,"Pours a very dark black with a small mocha colored head that fades fast. A very think pour. First whiff is Bourbon and oak! WOW. Then you get an aroma of mocha and vanilla. Its quite a rush to the nose. The first sip is the same, sharp bourbon with hints of port and oak. Another sip brings coffee, chocolate, and booze! Its definatly a sipper. The booze is strong, but its more from the bourbon presence than the overall ABV. Actually the more you drink the more it smooths out and becomes just a nice tasty warmth. Now this review is of a 2009 vintage, bottled on 2/18/09. I would imagine another year would make it even smoother. With that said, I can't think a fresh one would be very easy to get down with all of the booze and bourbon. But if you can find an aged one, pick it up!! Its one of the most unique stouts I have had, buts its not one for those who don't like the uniqeness of the bourbon flavor.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Augustiner719,4.42,"Pours a surprizing dark brown black translucent color that leaves a very small mocha head and recedes quickly. Swirls along the glass like oil almost.  Smell: Smells like cedar, bourbon, sherry along with your standard imperial stout. Chocolatly bourbon and caramel come through and sting the nostrils slightly.  Taste: Tastes very smooth. Big dose of vanilla, bourbon and woody characters come through, almost like a scotch. Very balanced for such high abv but the alcohol is comming through. Despite the alcohol bite, i believe its meant to be that way and it showcases the stout brilliantly.  Mouthfeel: low carbonated and perfect for this style. Doesnt leave the mouth overly cloying or dry. very smooth transition through all of the layers.  Drinkability: I wouldnt drink more than a bomber of this, but its easy to drink. High abv and huge complex flavors make this perfect with food and its delicious enough to have by itself.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DmanGTR,5,"Review from notes Aug 28, 09  A - Poured an intense, heavy pitch black with a dense 1/4"" tan head. Nothing comes through, everything is sucked into this black abyss. Excellent retention the whole time. 5.0  S - Like Thomas Hardy's meets Serpent's Stout and got married at Maker's Mark. Very rich fruitiness of figs and dates. Touch of caramel and toffee. A splash of whiskey and oakiness. Some blackberries as well. Whispers of dark chocolate flows through, trailing a tiny hint of alcohol. 5.0  T - Holy. Shit. This beer is the new Arrogant Bastard. But it wears a top hat, monocle, and carries a cane with a concealed flask. Bold chocolatey notes mingle with intense roasted barley and port wine. Immense, black ruination of your palate is instant. It douses your palate with rich RIS-like roastiness, chocolate, and fruits with an English barleywine sweetness. Vanilla with a touch of alcohol warmth in the finish. 5.0  M - Full bodied, creamy, velvety smooth. Smooth carbonation barely leaves a prickly on the tongue. Coats the palate nicely. 5.0  D - Dangerously drinkable. Please don't drive after this, because you'll surely have more than one of these. 5.0",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,billyshears,4.67,"2009 vintage a: Minimal tan head. Black with a slight bit of redness to it. In the snifter, certainly no light passing through this. s: bourbon barrel aroma dominate here. whirlwind of chocolate, vanilla, coconut and caramel type smells. t: its quite impressive how the bourbon doesn't overpower but instead extends the spectrum of the flavor. Those mentioned in smell all come together perfectly. Really well done. Delicious sweetness to it. m: creamy, silky smooth. carbonation is there and probably where it should be. d: this goes down too easily.  Before I drank this I had imagined what perfect bourbon stout would taste like, and this is pretty close. Certainly one of the best stouts I've had.

1549,10672,JTahoe,4.37,"2008 vintage poured into wide mouthed goblet.  A - Pitch black with just an island of brown foam, not enough to call it a head, swirling across the surface and clinging to the edges, in all very much like espresso crema.  S - Aroma of fine bourbon makes a big first impression, further examination reveals rich concentrated raisins, dark roasted malt, charred oak, and vanilla.  T- The bourbon flavor is much more subdued than the aroma would suggest, but plenty rich bourbon character comes through without taking control, allowing this to really drink like a stout. Dark dried fruit, vanilla, charcoal, rich dark chocolate, carob, toffee, leather, dark rum, sweet pipe tobacco. Finishes a bit boozy with a hint of smoke. Rich. Complex. Amazing.  M - Super smooth, rich, and full bodied with oily coating quality without smothering. Perfect light carbonation.  D - Very, very, scarily drinkable.

1549,10672,thekevlarkid,4.45,"Out of a bomber bottle generously provided to me by a BA friend this brew was as thick and dark as molasses. The retention of the head was good and the lacing impressive. Swirling it in my tulip, it moved like chocolate milk, so rich and viscous it was, only black and oily. The aroma was rich and enticing; I smelled chocolate, tobacco, whiskey, oiled leather, coffee, dark caramel and hints of vanilla. The flavor profile was equally complex and robust. Again, I tasted that zip of bourbon whiskey, this time right from the start, followed by the dark chocolate and chocolate syrup flavors. I also tasted leather, dark malt, molasses, coffee, leather, prunes and the alcohol punch. As it warmed up some elements of wood and vanilla appeared reflecting the oak barrel aging. The sharp, punchy elements were off set by the soft, chocolaty elements creating a nice balance. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body full and the carbonation appropriate enough to help it feel full without being heavy.

Pours a thick black with only the slightest bit of ruby and a dark tan head that is really loud and fizzy and dissipates pretty quickly.  Smell is thick with bourbon, tons of woody oak scent along with some bourbon/vanilla notes makes up a bulk of the scent. There is also sweet smelling chocolate, caramel, roasted malt and thick alcohol.  The flavor is intense at the moment, it could use some calming down, it has a huge malt sweetness, tons of bourbon flavor, some dark fruits, just a large bundle of barrel aged maltiness.  The mouthfeel is very thick and the alcohol burns nicely.

1549,10672,Patrick999,4.51,"2008 vintage!  Popped the cap and poured into my large snifter that is reserved for beers like this. Thin but present espresso-crema head, and a thick, viscous-looking liquid to say the least.  Oh my God, that's good. I can smell that 6 feet away. Intense carob and chocolate-raisin. Rum, rum raisin cubed. If I somehow took Essence of Raisinets and concentrated it to all hell and threw it in beer, this is what it would smell like. One of the best-smelling stouts I've encountered.  It doesn't taste of Raisinets quite as much as it smells. But that's not to say it's lacking. It is indeed heavy on the bourbon, with a strong vanilla taste and a hint of smoke. Bitterness from barrel char moreso than from hops. There is some chocolate and raisin, though, and yes...even though this is a 2008 vintage, the alcohol is not entirely tamed. It's not a hindrance, mind you, but it's there.  Feel is impressive. This avoids the somewhat thin feel barreled stouts seem to have, I think. It retains a fair level of thick, viscous goodness. I would have to say it is exceptional per style.  BCS is, to put it mildly, some serious shit. Yet while you do feel the 13%, it's so good, who cares?",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This beer has one of the thickest mouth feels. Its like having a heavy cream in your mouth but luckley it is a bourbon flavored stout. This is a sipper.

1549,10672,cavedave,3.85,"2009  Pours a deepest brown/black, thickly filling my snifter with a petroleum look-a-like, topped by a brown head of fine foam, which quickly fades to floating skim.  The nose is a very full aroma of molasses, licorice, alcohol, bourbon, gentle yeast, a bready toastiness, with an edge of ripe plum and hints of bitter. More sweet and less burnt smell than many of this style, very pungent and tempting, very complex.  Not as strong flavored as the aroma predicted, but brightly full of all the complex flavors, moreso the molasses, less so the dark fruit. The bourbon sort of ties the taste together, and notes of oak and vanilla I didn't smell now mix in to make a fine taste. The alcohol is not hot, more of a warm spicy flavor. It tastes very well blended, I can only guess how much better this could improve with age. It is sweeter than I like (though well within the style's range) but the end of the sip features an earthy bitterness that is a good counterpoint.  Mouthfeel is thick bodied, very viscous, clinging, low carb., in short just right for the style. However, it rates lower in all of these categories than many others in this style, and it is neither as thick, viscous, nor clinging as I like an impy stout.  Drinkability is above average, it is tasty, but no where near as sippable as others in this style.  Impression: A good stout, full of flavor, but too sweet, and not as interesting as others.

Starts with sweet complex malt maybe a hint of dark chocolate, and finishes with a sweet then warming bourbon flavor. The mouthfeel is thick but smooth, no issues here.

Huge notes of bourbon, malt, malt, and more roasted malt. It's lightly hopped, but heavy on the ethanol. The malt does much to hide its monstrous 13% AVB, but nothing short of a preemptive carbohydrate feast will mitigate it's effects.

The tongue is dazzled by the huge malty complexity with all of the usual suspects: Thick hershey's syrup with some sweet and bitter aspects, graham crackers, wet-earth, musty fruits, caramel and the kind of heat that will remove paint.

This beer pours as black as night, probably one of the darkest beers I've seen. As it was being poured a small head formed but by the time it got in my awaiting hands there were just a small layer of bubbles around the edge.  There is heavy bourbon and vanilla on the nose. A nice tinge of alcohol says this beer is heavy.  There really isn't any surprises in the taste department. A big bourbon sweetness upfront dominates the mouth which towards the end evolves into a more caramel/ roasted malt. I haven't had many bourbon aged stouts but this one dominated all the others by a long shot. The alcohol is very present and I think could use a year or two in order to improve.  The mouth feel is thick with a huge residual sugar content. The low carbonation compliments the richness of the bourbon character. Drinkability is only average at this point since for me the huge alcohol presence is a barrier. I've drank a two year aged version before and it had mellowed significantly.

1549,10672,cadizkyguy,4.37,"This is a re-do from a review on Sept. 15, 2009  Previously, this 2008 Vintage did not impress...scoring a D+.  Appearance -- Not much to look at. Very dark beer, Reminds me of a syrupy cola as it poured into Samuel Smith Pint Glass.  Smell -- This is the best part of bourbon beers. It had an intense smell. Definitely smelled the bourbon. Almost overpowering.  Taste -- Wow. It was very bitter, very much like an adult dosage of cough syrup. I did not expect it to taste to bitter.  Mouthful -- All I could think about was, this reminds of mouthwash. I bet it killed every germ in my mouth. I've had bourbon beers before, but this went way over the top.  Drinkability -- This was my first drain pour as a member of BA. I could not finish it and poured half of it down the drain. Will age the other three bottles and try at a later date, and if my findings are different, I will re-do this review.  GIVEN A FEW MONTHS TO ""AGE"" THIS GOOSE ISLAND BEER, I'VE COME UP WITH THE FOLLOWING ""CORRECTIONS"" TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW.  Appearance -- Jet black, motor oil consistency poured into Snifter. No light getting through. Lacking in head, minimal lacing around the 22 ounce snifter.  Smell -- It has ""mellowed"" out if that is possible. Very earthy, with the can't-miss intoxicating smell of bourbon barrels.  Taste -- It has ""mellowed,"" and it tastes so smoooth. I cannot wait to see what a few more months will do to the other two bottles currently ""aging"" in my mom's basement up near Chicago.  Mouthful -- Given the choice of a workout on the Wii, or a glassful of this wonderful brew, it was an easy choice. This coats the tongue, teeth, etc. Totally scrumptious.  Drinkability -- Definitely not a drain pour. Though my re-do review might still not rank with the overall sentiment of this GI offering bottled on 10-08-08, it is definitely better with age. I saw a display of GI BCS '07 vintage at Roof Brothers in Paducah, KY recently and I might have to pick up a four pack to see what another year does for ""mellowing"" out this intense brew.  Thanks Goose Island for giving me a second chance to enjoy your Bourbon County Stout. Definitely a world class beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Arbitrator,3.15,"EDIT: In light of the comments below (reviewing a fresh bottle), I should add the following notes:  I drank a 2007 in 2010 and it was SUBLIME. The heat had largely cooled off, leaving a bourbon-forward bitter chocolate flavor with light vanilla and roast. This experience taught me: don't drink the beer fresh.  I repeated the experiment with a 2008 drank at the tail end of 2011, thanks to Nanoslug. That one was excellent, as well.  I am leaving up my score, as I feel a beer should always be ready to drink upon release. But it is worth noting that I would give aged versions of BCBS an A.  ---  Original review:  Chilled bottle into a glass. 2009 vintage, an extra courtesy of chcfan. Thanks Chris! I just blue myself.  A re-review over the 2008 version. My palate has changed considerably since then.  A: Pours an oily black that is completely opaque to the light. It develops a dark mocha head that disappears quickly, leaving a very thin collar and absolutely no lacing down the glass. Just looks solid and imposing.  S: Bourbon -- very strong -- with lesser vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and an alcohol singe. It's very pungent and captivating, but it's not subtle or balanced in the slightest. I don't like the booze burn and feel that other barrel-aged stouts avoid that problem, hence my score.  T: Bourbon. Wait for it... More bourbon. And some more bourbon. Then caramel, oak, and vanilla enter the palate next. The finish has hints of dark chocolate and roasted malt that produces a slight coffee character, but it's still very bourbon-dominated. And it's surprisingly hot; not quite burning, but I definitely notice the booze in the mouth, the throat, and the stomach.  M: Thick-bodied and oily, with low carbonation as is appropriate for the style. A strong warming effect is felt, as noted above. It's borderline solventy at times. I really don't get the love for this one; it's so brash and unrefined.  D: I have mixed feelings on this beer. Out of the gate, it's simply not ready to drink (IMO). I love the strong bourbon flavors, but it is too solventy for my tastes.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Slight coffee aroma is detected as well as a pleasant residual sugar smell blanketing all of it.  T - Whoa, this one will make your eyes water! Have you ever seen the movie Braveheart...well this beer is like the infamous battle scene, but instead of William Wallace and King Edward I you have fierce fired wood and intense bourbon flavors on one side of the battle ground, and on the other you have dry roasted coffee, semi-bitter chocolate, and malt sweetness. And if you've ever seen the movie you know what happens next. That's my analogy...I give it a 5.  M/D - About as big/thick/bold of a body you can get in a beer. Surprisingly smooth to start with very little carbonation, and a semi-dry finish. 13% alcohol? Bring it...this one burns almost like a shot of bourbon in the aftertaste and the flavor sticks on the palate for a while. That said, drinkbility is variable depending on how much you like to get punched in the face by ethyl alcohol flavors. That doesn't mean it detracts from the beer...just don't plan on swinging any claymore swords around after you finish this bottle.  I'm suddenly inspired to paint my face blue and and speak with a Gaelic accent...",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,zdk9,4.85,"Michigan Trip Beer #1- An amazing find on my short trip to Michigan. This is a beer I've been wanting since I started drinking good beer- and now I finally have it! (too bad the only glassware available is this hotel room highball).  A- Totally black- if there are any highlights they are a dark dark purply brown. Not any head which is only mildly weird given the glassware and the beer at hand.  S- In this department I really wish I could drink it in a snifter as directed. At first I wasn't noticing as much aroma as taste but as it goes down the glass and warms up I get more and more strength and complexity in the nose. There's definitely bourbon, oaky, vanilla, booze. Hints of unrefined vodka and corn whiskey (moonshine). Then bursts of chocolate- creamy and milky. Not a ton of roast on the smell but perfectly complex for my smelling.  T- Rich brown sugar. Creamy booze, almost like Baileys. Chocolate. Strong bourbon but not quite as vanilla and more tempered than the smell. Supremely delicious.  M- Silky smooth, delicious, sweet, lingering, awesome.  O- This beer was well worth the wait. An exceptional bourbony beer and one I hope to be able to have again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,david18,3.35,"I probably need to try this again as a late night sipper rather than my first beer when I arrived at the bar in the late afternoon. It's a very strong stout, which, in my opinion doesn't do a great job of balancing the alcohol. Color was great, good carbonation that was surprisingly light for how dark the color was. Aroma is also very good. Again, the only problem is the strong alcohol taste that needs more hops and malt to balance it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,birchstick,5,"(2010, less than a month fresh) Pours a jet black without much of a head. The smell is of molasses, chocolates, and loads of sweet, sweet bourbon - this is what a bourbon barrel stout should smell like. The taste is loads of chocolate fudge, vanilla, and molasses, and tons of delicious bourbon. The bourbon is in your face fresh. FANTASTIC. Unlike any other beer I have tried before. Oily slick mouthfeel that matches the appearance with a medium body. Drinkability is easily a 4.5 as this combines a fantastic base stout with the best bourbon flavor I have had in a beer to date. I love drinking this, but about 8 - 10oz is perfect.  2007 (2 years old)  A - Pours a dark, deep black with a chocolaty head  S - smells of rich, fudgy chocolate. There is a touch of molasses, and the bourbon is faintly noticeable - it has faded quite significantly, but is still present.  T - The taste follows the nose. There is a ton of fudgy chocolate at first. This fades into a little bit of molasses and a bit of bourbon burn on the finish. There is also a bit of charcoal/burnt malt noticeable on the back-end. Overall, this is super rich and packed with flavor - outstanding. The bourbon has faded quite a bit, but the chocolates have become very pronounced - it is almost a new beer.  M - The body has thinned a little bit over the years, but it is still very smooth and goes down nicely.  D - This has held up fantastically over the last 2 years. I could drink BCS every night if I was able to. I didn't expect this thing to hold up this nicely. Fantastic.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kmo1030,4.75,"pours motor oil black with not too much of a dark brown head. the aromas wafting off this beer are killer. rich bourbon laden oakey vanilla hits you first. rich roasted chocolate and dark malts with touches of coffee slide in beneath that. you find dark honey, molasses and a bit of cigar tobacco. the taste is absolutely decadent. it's like a liquid malt ball... there's some serious chocolatey flavors rolling around. the bourbon barrel is obviously very evident with lots of vanilla/oak and ever so slight char. all the bourbon flavors with none of the hard alcohol bite. a little deeper in you get dark caramelized sugar and molasses rounding things out. at times the vanilla takes almost a coconut turn. it's got just enough bitterness for balance. the aftertaste is like a smokey malt ball. just a ton of stuff going on in your mouth. this is nothing less than the definition of bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. the mouthfeel is viscous and full bodied. it's got very mellow carbonation that only adds to it's silky smooth texture. the drinkability is pretty great as far as beers this big go. the 13% abv isn't present at all other than a slight warming on the tongue and at the back fo the throat. an absolutely phenomenal beer. if you don't like it you're probably a jerk.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Gosox8787,4.97,"Picked up two bottles of this on a recent trip to Massachusetts. I've heard great things about this, although I never could get it in NH. Anyway, as I opened the first bottle, my expectations were sky high.  Appearance-Black as night, absolutely no light coming through this brew. One finger mocha head with almost no retention.  Aroma-As soon as I opened the bottle, there is an instant burst of bourbon aroma. Its a little boozy, but the strength and depth of flavors more than make up for that. Dark chocolate and molasses also hit hard. Burnt sugar with some dark fruit sweetness also appear in a lesser degree. Just amazingly layered and complex.  Taste-Bourbon and astrigent burnt sugar are the first things I detect on my tounge. Next there was a subtle, smooth transition to chocolate and molasses. Strong dark fruits also make an appearance. Finish is smokey with strong bitter chocolate notes.  Mouthfeel-Incredibly smooth and velvety. Almost no carbonation. Full bodied and then some. Leaves a nice smooth feeling in the mouth after each sip.  Drinkability-Well the ABV is through the roof and the flavor isn't exactly subtle, but this is a beer I could just sip on all night, without fail. For that reason I think this has great drinkability. Dangerously drinkable.  Overall, just an incredible beer in all reasons. I had this bottle without aging, I saved another for in a couple years. The flavors manage to be strong, forceful, and great on their own, but meld together to be better than the sum of their parts. Almost flawless. Layered and complex. A true masterpiece.

1549,10672,Andreji,4.35,"I was hoping to have a small catch this afternoon at Union Sq's Whole Foods and i came across a single of this bourbon county sitting right beside a 120min ipa (which i also purchased). I thought to myself ""I've heard of this on BA"" but honestly didn't really have a clue about what this was.  Which is always the best purchase, if you ask me, when you just go straight, blindly at something without really knowing what to expect.  Once out of the paper bag i saw the ""Goose Island"" lid and thought to myself ""Oh, right"" (obviously bluffing, i've never tried anything from GI). popped it and poured it straight, sort of hoping to stirr it up a bit and see some carbonation.  This is like pouring tar, I tel you, or melted black chocolate if it sounds any tastier. Viscous to the bone, and the ""head"" i was aiming for never came. just a very discrete lace.  But i did manage to bring out a dozen smells. where to start? malty like a straight shot of whisky's malty. maybe trekking towards a liqueurish sense, perhaps a chocolatey bailey's, white russian is it? anyway let's not overexplore this. it's very sweet and full of alcohol. I know, it sounds bad, but somehow it's properly mixed to the point where smelling it's just not enough. It practically asks you to taste it.  And once you're in, you get a straight alcohol attack, on the nostrils and on the back of the tongue. By simpler standards i'd say that's disgusting, but my friends no, the trick is to get past this and taste the dark chocolate, coffeish burnt caramel feel on the very smooth oily layered feel on the tongue. Very discrete bitter finish which i thought was very harmonious because they don't tried to get carried away- it's already thick and booze-ish why would they top it off with excess IBUs?  In my opinion, kudos to these fellas, splendid ""rogue diamond"" sort of beer. Too many things put together in the right order, sort of like NYC.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DanOLeary,4.79,"Aroma: Rich aroma of bourbon and burnt oak with hints of dark chocolate and vanilla coming through as well. There is a spicy alcohol aroma that nearly burns the nose if you take a good breath in of this beer, which you want to do because the aroma is excellent. A slight roasted character lies in the back but you have to look for it amongst the bourbon and wood.  Appearance: Pours a motor oil black with initially an almond brown head, though the head dissipates very quickly and is all but gone within a minute of pouring. The beer does maintain a very thin ring around the glass. Light lacing will stick to the glass with a swirl.  Flavor: The tongue is hit up front with an oaken bourbon character which is quickly followed by a rich dark chocolate sweetness. Some dark fruit is present as the flavors progress toward the middle, prune and molasses are clear but there is the hint of vanilla as well. Toward the middle further enters a roasted quality, and the bourbon comes back again in full force before an alcohol bite finishes the beer off with a hot spice. The finish closes with some sweetness on the tongue and alcohol spice.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with medium carbonation. The malt character fills the mouth with a stickiness but this is offset by the dryness and warming character of the 13% alcohol content. Finish is dry at the back of the throat, but the malty body maintains a sticky sweetness on the tongue and lips.  Overall: Of Bourbon Barrel aged beers this certainly sits as one of my favorites. The bourbon character is well pronounced without being overwhelming. Aroma and flavor character runs the gamut from warm alcohol and bourbon spice to malt and chocolate richness. The combination of bourbon character and a rich imperial stout make this an excellent example of bourbon barrel aging.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like a guiness without all the carbonation. The taste is chocolate,bourbon and coffee. I have to take an issue with the alchol burn though, it is the one thing that takes the drinkability down. The KBS i had earlier didnt have nearly as much of a burn and hid the alchol much bettter.

1549,10672,boatshoes,4.62,"Picked up a bomber of the 2009 vintage from Total Beverage on a trip to Colorado. My first experience with the beer and was very curious to try it.  Appearance- The usual motor oil black with about a quarter finger of fizzy, dark brown head on top. Head dies back immediately, leaving just the black body of the beer. Little to no lace but pretty spot on for the style.  Smell- Oh boy, a lot going on here. Rich dark chocolate, bourbon and vanilla really strike me. The wood is very evident and there is also a bit of a tobacco-ish quality that almost reminds me of walking into a cigar store. If the taste comes close to being as complex as this, there is a great beer in store.  Taste- Wow, this one really delivers for me. Huge mixture of rich dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, wood, some burnt coffee, roasted malt, and most surprisingly of all, a dark fruitiness. I was not expecting any fruitiness but I couldn't shake it regardless. Delicious and one of my friends compared it to drinking a bar of dark chocolate dissolved in bourbon. Excellent.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is heavy and slick with just enough carbonation to liven it slightly in the mouth. What amazed me most was that I had heard this beer is very hot fresh. From my own experience, I disagree and think it did an excellent job of hiding the ABV. Because of that and the delicious complexity of the flavor, this had quite a high drinkability for the style.  Overall, an absolutely delicious beer. This is what I look for when I think barrel-aged imperial stout. A complex and interesting sipper.

BLacker than black, darker than dark, nuller than null...this beer sucks all light and spits it into another dimension where all beers are clear and tasteless. Limited head; you can coax one out with an aggressive pour, but it don't stick around for too long.  S- I can't even distinguish specific smells; a sweet roasted alcohol scent with rich notes of chocolate and coffee. Such an intense, brutal smell, this just kicks the shit out of my olfactory system. Just a tad too much alcohol, I can actually taste it in the back of my throat. Even the tiniest swirl lets the beastly smell out of the cage. Slight rose smell at the very end. Just fantastic.  T- Oh.  My.  God.  This is THE most complex beer I have ever had the honor of sipping. A thousand tastes, ranging from caramel and brown sugar to fine Cuban cigars and boiled Johnny Walker Black Label (I wonder what kind of bourbon this was aged with...). This beer manages to successfully unite the entire range of beer flavors. They weren't lying when they said ""this beer has more flavor than your average case of beer""! Hops and overpowering malt combine seamlessly in here, and by that I mean you can't even taste a single hop molecule, which is what I like. Big whiskey notes at the end and a lingering bittersweetness that is just so mouthwatering. I don't need a reason to take yet another drink, but if I needed one, that would be it. The aftertaste alone is the best I have experienced.  But it isn't perfect; the taste seem just a tad undeveloped. While all the flavors are there, they lack the richness I was looking forward to. Aging I know would improve that, so I am promising another review of a correctly aged bottle.  M- Thick like wool, smooth like the finest Chinese silk. Tiny carbonation, thick and smooth body that is an absolute joy.  D- Overpowering flavor and strength are no match for the expert craft and dedication to the craft; remarkable drinkability for such an Leviathan of a beer; this world class brew dregs itself up from the blackest depths to destroy all weaker beers in it's path.

The cascading effect when the glass is tilted is lovely, the bubbles take forever to rise back to the surface as they fight gravitational force.  Exceptionally aromatic, this is the heaviest, darkest, fudgiest nose I've smelt. Big time dark malts, thick and gooey fudge, bourbon casks, maple and espresso.  The taste is a thing of beauty. Tastes like an unoxidized Triple Bock that is carbonated and has luxurious mouthfeel. Even more complex though. Dark maple and brown sugars, espresso and fudge malts, gooey dark chocolate, earthy, woody notes add complexity and a pronounced bourbon character in the finish. This beer was made to be aged in Bourbon barrels.  The mouthfeel is heavenly, thick and bodacious. Big and chewy, as heavy as it gets, full bodied and silky, creamy and smooth.

Some maple flavor and a bit of dark chocolate in the nose.  The taste is pretty strong with some nice maple flavor. Some chocolate and toffee flavor mixed in there as well. It really takes a moment to really enjoy all of the flavors in this beer.  The feel of this beer is pretty darn heavy but it does have a bit of a smoothness that was enjoyable.

1549,10672,mdcrouser,4.65,"Pours dark brown, settles out deep black. 1/8"" inch head on the pour, but bubbles down to nothing after only a minute or two.  Bourbon is immediately apparent, and it could be the only thing you smell if you allowed yourself. But giving it more time, I'm also picking up bits of dark chocolate, and some woodiness.  Huge depth of malts here - much like a world-class dark chocolate, it melts in your mouth. Woody vanilla from the bourbon brings the whole thing together, providing a bit of sweetness while also mellowing out the bourbon - very little heat here.  The carbonation lingers a bit, keeping the aforementioned flavors dancing on the tongue. It sits heavily on the edges of the tongue, providing a slick runway for this goose to land.  While I wouldn't recommend it in large quantities, it is pretty tasty as a sipper, and a warmer. So enjoyable.  Enjoying the third of four on May 22, 2012 - Zero head and the bourbon on the nose has mellowed some, leaving behind some booziness and still strong woodiness.  Still lots of bourbon in the mouth, but it seems to have picked up more of a char and bitterness to it. Like the crust on barbecue, or decadence of a super dark chocolate, even some dark juicy fruits.  I think this one could age for an eternity and continue to evolve.  The fourth of this four from 2009 saw daylight on May 19, 2015 - a cool spring day and a rough/long few months at work make tonight the night. The Royals win (Ventura: 7 IP, 4H, 0R) and it feels like fall, so it's time.

1549,10672,BillyBoysPie,4.85,"From a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  Black. Black. Pitch black. Opaque pitch black. A quarter inch caramel head from an extremely vigorous pour. Dissipates nearly completely, but leaves sticky lacing. Did I mention black - pitch black - completely opaque pitch black?  I got a noseful of rich malty bourbon flavors. Plenty of sweet malt smells - with banana esters, plums, a dash of pear, a hint of blueberry and raspberry. The bourbon flavors contain the typical caramel flavors present in the classic spirit, along with the florals and rich charred oak present. Plenty of toast, but well masked behind the caramels. No hops. I don't feel like there should be either.  Delicious. Layers upon layers of flavor. It starts with hot alcohol quickly dissolving into the caramel and florals of bourbon. Fruits are next with a strong lean towards the more jammy fruits with that beautiful hint of blueberry leading into the dark toast flavors. The progression is very smooth and quick. But, it seems to last forever. Beautiful.  Dense, nearly viscous mouthfeel. Very full bodied, and aside from the heat at the beginning of the drink, the alcohol is well incorporated into this brew.  Strong, yet delicate, rich flavors and well balanced, there's not much not to like about this beer. Not much I can say other than I like it. A great deal. And, it's worth the pretty penny.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,samie85,4.77,"Bottled on date 10/28/08 making this almost a year and a half old.  A- Pours a pitch black with a virtually non-existent dark brown head into a snifter.  S- The first thing I smell is bourbon and it transitions to quicklu to with oak, vanilla, and dark chocolate notes with some sweet alcohol. Pretty complex.  T- I get rich bourbon and oak with some vanilla and dark chocolate notes, with some molasses and alcohol. I liked the intensity of the bourbon when I tried this year's batch (2008) fresh.  M- Coats the palate and is very thick and chewy. There's virtually no carbonation present but you can feel the faintest hint on the tongue near the end.  D-While it is a sipper, it goes down way too easy for the pretty high ABV. This is the beer that got me into BA (I registered while drinking my first one) and it's a fitting beer to review for no. 100. Even after almost a year and a half this is still a bourbon-y delight but much of the alcohol ""heat"" has diminished.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,techfed87,4.55,"Pours a jet black-brown color. Has barely any head, and the one it does pour dissipates very quickly. Smells of deep cinnamon and oatmeal. There is a bourbon like scent going on, but that initial scent will split up into different flavors.  Initially, the flavor is very much that of whiskey. But once the initial ""shock and awe"" is done with this beer, it completely turns head and becomes something quite wonderful in complexity. It feels like a very grainy beer, at the same time it has the viscosity of paint thinner. This is quite the good beer, on par with such beers as Kentucky Breakfast Stout. I daresay, this may be better than previously said beer. This mellows when you drink it and although initially very shocking, turns into a real sweetie afterwards. And if the price tag were not $22 for a four-pack, I would be much happier with it. An almost perfect beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,stevenseg,4.94,"Let's start by saying that me and bourbon barrel aged beers...we's like dis son (fingers crossed). I think that adding bourbon to beer is one of the greatest innovations since...well...sliced bread! That being said...Kentucky Breakfast Stout from Founder's is the bourbon beer standard to which I may unfairly hold all subsequent bourbon brews. Let's see what Goose Island (a brewery I am not necessarily much of a fan of) can do.  First of all, this beer pours pretty much pitch black. At leats we can call it pitch black for a beer standards. The head was rather lame. I sure hope it's as thick as I want it to be...something along the lines of motor oil after 10,000 hard miles. Besides the lame head, the blacker the better, I always say.  This thing is supposed to have 13% ABV. It smells more like 80 proof. I absolutely love the distinct bourbon notes in the nose. Add a touch of charred sweetness from the dark roasted malts and we've got an exceptional ""smell"" rating.  Mmmm...taste. I had to wait a couple minutes to let the glass mellow. It needs to warm a bit before it touches these lips. After a few minutes: OH YEAH! I have to say Goose Island knocked it out of the park. My hopes for a HUGE body was right on. The fire of the bourbon was mellowed, leaving that tingly nose feeling. The high alcohol content perfectly compliments the bourbon character. Imagine a dark dark chocolate milk shake with bourbon. Absolutely beautiful.  It is so creamy and sweet from the roasted malts...and I don't know what it is, but the Bourbon County Stout struck my mouthfeel chord just right. I have never given such a high mouthfeel rating...it's hard to get me to give up a 5.0.  This is not a session beer...nor is it a beer you can have more than a few of at a time. The alcohol seems higher because of the natural fire of the bourbon flavor. I love that. The flavor of the alcohol, but not so much of a bite...I mean who really needs more than 13% ABV in a great beer? I'm telling you...give this a try...and try it on the colder side...say around 45 degrees or so. The flavor gets out and the cooler temperatures really complement the awesome body.  If we're looking at ratings only, Bourbon County is my top-rated beer now. I am almost on the floor crying over this discovery. Goose Island, I didn't expect much, but you stepped up and blew me away with this one. If you like bourbon beers...find it before the secret gets leaked!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Docer,3.58,"1 bomber... enjoyed.  - Great dark stout, light mocha head... down to a mild bubbly lacing... bubbly like a champagne. Dark, thick...  - Vanilla, bourbon... grain, oats, sweet.. bitter chocolate.... goodies. Not much more I can say. Smells like it should.  - A great standard for a bourbon barrel aged brew. The stout portion was complex, grainy, oaty... sweet... and the bourbon was heavy... quite present. Thought this brew hits the standard right on the button. Any worse... a mediocre brew... any better... a sure winner and better.  - Little strong and heavy... sweet and thick... puckering and bitter....  - I found this one hard to drink. Certainly a sipper, and one to let warm up a bit.

1549,10672,bamadog,4.37,"I took this to a recent tasting. Bottled in 2009, I finally got around to trying this one and I'm VERY glad I've got another 4 pack aging for a couple of years and a few from 2008 as well, because it is going to be absolutely amazing with some age.  Appearance: Pour is dark black and completely opaque; starts with a one finger deep dark tan head that fades quickly to nothing; slight burgundy highlights at the surface; no lacing whatsoever, just an oily residue slides around the surface; looks a little viscous on the pour.  Smell: TONS of bourbon -- smell is hot and very boozy, but still smooth; slight roastiness in there as well as some sweet syrupy chocolate; the nose is super potent and there are some great hitns of toffee and caramel/butterscotch as it continues to warm.  Taste: Absolutely fantastic... period -- albeit very hot. Tons of woody bourbon and a strong presence of alcohol; nice sweet maltiness and lots of the tofee and caramel/butterscotch flavors; mild roastiness and a semi-sweet chocolately flavor in the back; definitely in need of some age to mellow out the heat, but it's fantastic even as is.  Mouthfeel: Very hot from all that bourbony goodness; tremendous alcoholic vapor floats through the mouth and causes it to dry; body is just a little thin, but I find that barrel aging does this at times.  Drinkability: At 13%, clearly I couldn't drink a ton of it, but I would gladly try to... I'm glad I finally gave this one a shot, even though I've been aging a few bottles for a while now, but it's going to be hard to wait on it now.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,atigerlife,4.37,"Update: just had a 2009 [11 year old]. Very nice. Impressive, especially considering its age.  2007  Pours black. Viscous. No head.  Aroma is of alcohol, bourbon, dark malts and licorice.  There is no mistaking the bourbon in this one. Nothing wrong with that. Also some dark malts, dark chocolate. Did I mention the bourbon?!  Mouthfeel is heavy, mildly cleansing.  Overall, quite an interesting taste but ABV limits drinkability. A definite sipper.

Shows bottling date, (10/02/09 1639) and dedicated glassware. Notes Alc. by Vol. (13.0%) Served into a snifter.  A - Black body, small dark brown-ruby edges with a small brown frothy head. Average to small retention with very brief touches of lacing.  S - Boozy bourbon notes, chocolate, and a boozy malt whiff. Very rich on the nose.  T - Tremendous chocolate coated bourbon flavors, rich roasted notes capped by a hefty and well integrated alcoholic note.  M - Full body, creamy and thick, lingering texture with little but adequate carbonation.  D - Nice slow sipper, with a growing and assertive flavor worth every sip.

1549,10672,portia99,4.55,"12oz bottle (2008 release) poured into a Bruery goblet. This has about a year of age on it.  A - Pours a thick and oily, deep and dark black - almost with a blue tint to it. No head at all...only a very thin tan ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  S - Thick and heavy smelling...creamy, vanilla, bourbon, molasses, milk chocolate. Really a lot going on here. Very good smelling barrel aged stout.  T - Very rich and multilayered. Lots of molasses up front. A fine, coffee-like bitterness fades into the flavor and stays way into the aftertaste. A creamy vanilla flavor fills in the middle section. Bourbon is there the whole time and really rounds out the flavors here. A bit of milk chocolate mixes in with the rest of the flavors. Wow! - Very impressed.  M - Full and thick. Syrupy, oily - seems to coat the entire mouth. Some alcohol heat felt in every breath. Carbonation is low contributing to the smoothness and syrupy feel.  D - What a difference a year makes...tried this when it was fresh last year and found it almost undrinkable from the bourbon heat. After a year of aging, the bourbon heat has mellowed considerably. This is a much more well rounded beer. This is really impressive...has to be one of the best impys out there. Don't think I could have more than one, but this is pretty smooth.

Aroma: As the name implies there is quite a bit of bourbon aroma up front. There is also some bittersweet chocolate and coffee notes once you get past the malt.  Taste: The whiskey comes through a bit strong but does not overpower slight hints of coffee, caramel, vanilla, and some pear-like fruitiness.

A- This beer pours out a engine oil black with some light red hints to it when held up to the light. Half finger mocha colored head rises and falls it seems just as fast. No lacing at all with this beer.  S- Bourbon big upfront in aroma. Nice settled roasted malts come through next with a burnt chocolate smell. Some sweet sugary smell is in there as well but I can not really pin down the aroma.  T- Nice big bourbon upfront once again on the palate when you take your first sip. There is some coffee notes that were not in the nose here. Burnt chocolate and roasted malts make a big play here. Light notes of vanilla with this one too. Overall pretty good tasting.  M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for what it is. Big boozy tastes left on the palate and in the aftertaste. Coats entire palate with sort of a thick bourbon-y blanket.  D- This is a sipper at best. I always have a hard time finishing this beer although I am very fond of it.

1549,10672,Donerik,4.4,"I did a new years day 2 year vertical.  The '08 aged Sublimely, it was nearly perfect in all areas. It was mellow and rich. The bourbon flavor had faded into the finish leaving it with a sweet oaky vanilla taste in the forefront, that blended seamlessly into the bourbon at the finish. The Nose on the '08 was subdued as well with about half as much of the strength of bourbon as the fresh 09.  The 09 was hot, rough, and raw. The flavor was how I remember the 08 being at this time last year. bourbon! rich malts, and heat. This one took awhile to finish.  I was glad I did the vertical. I went out the next day and bout a 4 pack of the 08, and shuffled the 09's to the back of my stocks.  my score is a composite of both vintages, The 08 has gotten better, and pulled up the 09's score.  If you can afford it, I would buy some 09's and age them a year and open them about this time next year, as for me I am planning to buy more next payday so I can do 3 and 4 year verticals down the line.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Lunch,4.87,"Served on-tap at Victoria Gastro Pub in Columbia, MD (12/31/09). Served in a 12oz. snifter at a slighty colder than desired temperature, but allowed to warm to cellar temp.  A: Pours a deep, rich, motor oil black with an ever so slight ruby hue caped off with a just a slight foamy skin of a tan head that quickly dissipates to just a few bubbles.  S: Strong yet delicious bourbon scent along with molasses, roasted malt, coffee, and toffee/caramel. This on-tap version seems to have some slight chocolate and the bourbon is slightly mellowed, but still quite strong.  T: Intense bourbon flavor with very apparent alcohol heat, but in a pleasing way as long as you are a bourbon fan (or at least a bourbon stout fan). Very complex flavors including molasses, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, bitter dark chocolate, sweet cocoa, vanilla, and milk chocolate all surrounded in a blanket of wood. As with the scent the chocolate flavor is slightly more pronounced.  M: Full-bodied and oily with a syrupy mouthfeel with low carbonation. On-tap it seems to be a bit more creamy.  D: Certainly not the most drinkable Imperial Stout, but the flavors and complexity kept me wanting more and more. This version seemed a bit smoothed out and creamier lending to greater drinkabilty.  Overall this has to be one of the richest and most complex beers that I have ever had. I must say that this on-tap version added a bit to the mouthfeel as well as to smoothing out the bourbon and increasing the complexity with a greater degree of chocolate. If you can try this on-tap, do yourself a favor and try it. Looking forward to case of the 2009 with a little age on it.

1549,10672,YOOJ,4.08,"2009 bottle  Black as night with hardly any head.  Smell is strong and dominant alcohol, with a little whiskey and strong caramel sweetness.  Taste is BIG malts and strong alcohol. Really covers the palate like a big Imp stout should. Complex beer with a milder bitter hop balance than I would prefer for the style.  More drinkable than one might expect, but the sweetness and dominance of the alcohol are bit much. Maybe with aging this beer will round out.

Had on tap at RnH a few weeks ago, but wanted to give this one a proper review.  A - Black as night and very viscous. Pours a small dark mocha head that recedes neither slowly nor quickly - average head retention. No lacing to speak of.  S - BOURBON! Lots of alcohol on this one, just how I like them! Really though, there must be 1/4 of a shot in these 12 ozs! Burnt molasses, chocolate, and dark sugar hide beneath, coming out more as it warms.  T - Bourbon, burnt coffee, roasted chocolate malts and a hint of vanilla burst forth out of this one. The dark chocolate flavor is almost too similar to the real thing, but manages to never become off-putting.  M - Very creamy, like a dark bourbon cream that slides back way to easily  D - There is a reason I hardly remember that night at RnH, because this is way too drinkable for 13%!

This is the most bourbony (is this a word?) smelling beer  T - The taste of this beer was like the nose, but more intense. Loads of burnt, campfire malts, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla beans, smooth espresso, brown sugar, a little bit of molasses, and of course, the queen of the ball, glorious bourbon.

It pours a dark brown, almost black with a finger high dark tan head, little carbonation, and decent lacing.  The dominant aroma right off the bat is the bourbon, you can just smell the alcohol oozing out. There are also notes of vanilla and smoke.  The taste is very very smooth and wonderful, not at all what I was expecting from this stout. Not the typical coffee or chocolate.

1549,10672,CAMRAhardliner,4,"2008 vintage.  Pours pure black with an oily consistency. The bubbly tan head dissipates quickly. More legs than lace cling to the glass. The aroma is a potent mix of plums, bourbon cask, roasted barley, and dark roast coffee beans. The taste is as complex as the smell with a huge wall of roasted barley/coffee flavors mixing with a pleasant bourbon spiciness and loads of vanilla and charred oak flavors. Caramel, rum cake and hot chocolate add more Imperial Stout yummyness to the mix. The mouthfeel is very thick and lightly carbonated. The finish is on the sweet side, with a subtle hop bitterness and a warming alcohol heat.  This is a very good, very bold Double Stout.

There is minimal lacing on the glass. Looks like a flat stout. When you swirl the beer you get legs where the alcohol separates from the beer. Wow...  Aroma is like liquor, I suppose. Really strong. There is some sweetness. Can really smell the alcohol.  Beer is thick and has a great strong liquor presence to it. There is a strong roast character that comes up after the initial sweetness and alcohol of the bourbon. There is decent connectivity between the two flavors. The roast is not an aftertaste but a really late back flavor, there is no aftertaste. Second taste, the carbonation plays on the tongue a little, if there were more it may be better.

The beer appears black with traces of dark brown near the edges of the glass when held to light. The fizzy one finger head is the result of a hard pour. It's dark brown in color and recedes in under a minute, leaving very little lacing. A swirl of the glass yields a light alcohol film on the sides, as well as small legs. Definitely a high ABV beer.  The nose is decadent, with rich dark chocolate cake, brown sugar, molasses, wood, alcohol, and a legion of bourbon. The beer isn't at all balanced, but it's fantastic in its disequilibrium.  The flavor is rich and sweet chocolate, lots of bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, and oak. The alcohol flavor is evident beneath the rich dessert layers, and it also makes its presence known through warming. The finish is dark chocolate and brown sugar with alcohol warming and lots of bourbon that lingers.  The beer has upper low carbonation, and a thick, creamy, silky, velvety, smooth, and sticky mouthfeel.

Good moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, oily slick, chewy, creamy smooth full bodied mouthfeel. A delicious sipper, coffee, caramel toffee, roasted grains, vanilla barrel flavor and a little charred wood, a subtle berry fruitiness, the alcohol is pretty well balanced, presence, but only providing a low temperature warmth that increases the drinkability, not a hot alcohol taste bud killer, towards the end earthy grains and oak woody flavors emerges, the hops are pretty laid back, and a dryish caramel malty and vanilla barrel finish, quite enjoyable overall.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,secondtooth,4.44,"Ah, this one is a deep, charry black stout that pours from the bottle like a viscous oil. The scent recalls sweet cherry, aged oak, and of course the sting of bourbon (this is aged in bourbon barrels, thus the residual flavoring). First tasting reveals a heavy, potent alcohol presence (it is a goliath 13% ABV, after all). This initial palate is followed by a smoky, rich maltiness that is simply overpowering.

Lacing is also fairly non existant, as with most barrel aged beers I have had. Smells of oak, strong whiskey,vanilla in the whiskey and some cocoa, seems like the standard barrel stout. Would like some more strength in the elements besides the whiskey. Tastes of nice cocoa and whiskey blend with some oak and vanilla, a burnt taste at the end adds a nice element. Some brown sugar sweetness is also nice. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and oily. A coat of whiskey cocoa onAa the tongue with some huge heat. Low carbonation helps this kind of beer.

1549,10672,jgasparine,4.19,"Sampled a 2009 Bottle.  A- Poured from the bottle with a thin layer of tan foam, which quickly receded to a collar. The body was a completely opaque dark brown. Carbonation was not visible from the sides of the glass.  S- Bueatifully pungent aromas of caramel malt, vanilla and bourbon dominate the nose. Lesser roasty and chocolate notes were also detected. Smells incredibly wonderful.  T- An EXPLOSION of sweet and roasted malts combine with huge bourbon and vanilla notes on the palate. The drink quickly becomes hot in the middle with alcohol. The finish itself was very boozy, and some roasty bitterness lingers on the tongue long after swallowing. The excessive booziness is the only thing preventing this from being a 'perfect 5' the Taste department.  M- BIG thick velvety mouthfeel. Thick with unattenuated sugar and a silky soft carbonation. Exquisite.  D- The heat from the alcohol and the booziness is excessive. I couldn't drink more than a bottle of this... at least when served fresh. With a bit of age on it, I would imagine that the drinkability would improve considerably.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CharlatanSin,4.85,"This is a 2008 version. I waited a couple of bottles to review since it's so complex, and I wanted to give it a fair shake.  Poured from the bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A: A deep red-tinged brown. It creates a giant, foamy tan head with a tiny bit of a red hue that collapses into a perfect ring. Very beautiful.  S: The nose is primarily an oak whiskey scent. There's a fair deal of molasses, strong coffee, and vanilla. It's deep, complex, and stings the nostrils pleasantly.  T/M: The whiskey is strong and amazing. But it's balanced incredibly well so as not to be overpowering. The balancing factors are dark chocolate, vanilla, and strong coffee -- the sort of stuff you find in a good imperial stout. Drinking this beer is like experiencing a beautiful courtship between these two elements. It's thick, sticky, and burns so good on the way down.  D: This is in the top few beers I've ever had. Despite its fairly formidable price point, I know I'll be buying it again and again. My next quest in life becomes to find a vintage. Absolutely world class, and it nudges Brooklyn Black Chocolate out of its top stout spot on my list.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jminsc76,4.44,"Reviewing a 2008 version.  Poured in to a wide-mouthed sifter, pouring a dark brown head atop an impenetrable (Dark Vader-like) body. The head dies quickly, and the viscous nature of the body allows me to see my reflection at the top.  Aromas are INTENSE, with vanilla, graham, cracker, and molasses forming the bouquet. Very sweet, and it lifts the nose like a champ.  A wonderful bite up front, with the flavors washing over the palate like a rainbow. The beer exhibits chocolate, molasses, and vanilla initially, with some strong graham cracker, oak, and coffee/slight espresso on the finish. Wow, this stuff is nooo joke, and it compares to Dark Lord in flavor and consistency.  The mouthfeel is highly viscous, syrupy, with a little carbonation to cleanse the palate; ultimately, this is a sipping D.I. Stout if there ever was one.  Overall, this is very refined, with little heat (if any) and a little bit of bitterness coming out of the thick consistency. Incredibly refined, and lives up to its reputation.  Note: there are rumors abounding that some bottles exhibit a slight tinge of soy sauce, which is NOT a good thing apparently. I can vouch for this, as some of the bottles I have opened do exhibit a slight degree of the Asian condiment.  However, there are some bottles I have had that exhibit no soy sauce, and approach heaven-on-earth in their drinkability. Best thing to do when your B.C.S. exhibits slight degrees of soy sauce: don't let it warm too much and share it with others.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RoyalT,4.23,"Appearance - This is a rich ultra-dark brown in color with a beautiful brown head that is just the color of brown sugar.  Smell - The heavy wood notes are surrounded by scents of crème de cocoa, raw sugar, rich malt, and a liquor that is more like whisky then bourbon.  Taste - The flavors here are huge and explosive! The wonderful roasted malt is almost lost in the swarm of other flavors. The cocoa is especially prevalent and the vanilla wood notes from the nose are slightly restrained at the taste. The whisky finds a way to mellow out from the nose yet somehow is more prominent. The sugar is like a crème caramel.  Mouthfeel - This is a big medium-bodied beer that is relatively flat and could have used a bit more liveliness. The natural bitterness of the malt is canceled by the huge variety of uber-flavors such as the alcohol, wood, and sugar.  Drinkability - This is a terrific drink with maybe a bit too much going on.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Is jet black in color, no head, no carbonation, and sticks to the side of the glass as I swirl it, am really enjoying the looks of this viscous stout bomb.  The aroma is heavenly, it wreaks of chocolate, bourban, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel, the aroma is intense. The taste is absolutely amazing, man I love this stuff! The taste is exactly like the aroma - chocolate, some vanilla, carmel roasted malts on top of the tongue while underneath the bourban stays on your tongue the entire time and keeps appearing throughout the entire sip. Picking up a little oakiness also. The bourban effervescence very much dominates, thus the name. The ABV warms the throat after the sip and lingers for a few minutes. The body is heavy, velvety smooth on the tongue, and sticky.  This one is a sipper, very drinkable, enjoyable, and would be ever so good on the deck while enjoying a fine cigar. This is one of my favorite imperial stouts and I'm a sucker for the ones aged in bourban or whiskey barrels.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The taste started off as bourbon, though as it warmed up it started to mellow out and the flavors just sprang forth. I caught chocolate followed, by hints of both vanilla and coffee. The feel is my mouth is creamy followed by a slow elegant burn to finish. I could have had another bottle, except that I would rather age the other one I have.

S- Chocolatey bourbon goodness. Heavy notes of vanilla and wood combined with sweet chocolate malts. Great heat, just enough bourbon without being over-powering.  T- A lot like the smell. Simply perfect balance between the bourbon and the stout flavors. A year on this beer has turned it from a great brew to a fantastic one. The bourbon heat hits my lips and the back of my throat in the finish, but so much complexity and chocolate in the mid-palate.  M- The carbonation is nice and low, which is great because a lot tend to be over-carbonated. I might like a few more bubbles, but no complaints. Nice and chewy, for sho. There is a great heat to this beer after a year that keeps it special without ruining the flavors of the base stout itself. Lots of stout-y chocolate malts competing with the vanilla, oak and spices of the bourbon. The oak leaves a nice dryness as well.  D- This is a joke at 13%; I could drink it all day and all night.

1549,10672,brewdoc75,4.8,"I'll start this by disclosing that I typically do not care for bourbon. This has made me hesitant to try this beer. But nevertheless, I have a 3 year vertical in my cellar. Tonight, I decided to give this years batch a try.  A: Dark black. Some ruby undertones when the light can refract through. Strong, off-white, chocolate head that lasts quite a while. Served to me in a 10 oz snifter. Very inviting and quite succulent appearing. The head dies a little too quickly. If it lasted a bit longer, this very well could have been a 5.  S: The aroma is initially that of a top shelf bourbon. Very boozy. This quickly trends to a pleasant roasty aroma followed by some chocolate and vanilla. Slightly smoky as well.  T: All I can say is ""wow."" Tons of flavors going on. First I get a lovely burnt coconut, followed by some vanilla, chocolate, a hint of coffee and even some caramel. The coconut flavors are what make me swoon. Like a atomic, chocolate, coconut macaroon. The bourbon is present in the end. Not overly strong like some and just right. I didn't feel the alcohol too much as well. This is contrary to other reviews. The flavors were very well balanced. The hops were there to provide very appropriate bitterness. The flavors overall could be described as ""epic.""  M: Medium to heavy bodied, but definitely on the lighter end for an imperial stout. Smooth. I may want a hint more velvety mouthfeel in a high alcohol stout like this, but really not a terrible fault.  D: This was definitely an epic beer. The flavors were incredible. I really don't care for bourbon, but this beer makes me want a rematch. I was really taken aback with this beer. I'm gonna collect a few more years and try my vertical that i have in my cellar. In the meantime, I may pick up another 4 pack of this years batch. If you haven't tried this, you must. My drinking partner tonight was a novice and even loved it.

Poured thick with about 1/2 finger of a chocolate head.  The smell was great, vanilla, bitter chocolate, and bourbon are right up front. I could use a little more though.  The taste is spectacular, with a very roasted malty smoky flavor with lots of vanilla and bourbon present. It tastes almost like it is a Stout mixed with Bourbon. What a great combo. What sets this apart for me is the very nice finish, that is less sweet that some of the other big stouts out there.  For being 13% the drinkability is spectacular, as there is a nice warming from the alcohol, but not too intensely hot.  For me when it come to BA Big Stouts this is what I measure all others against.

A little bitter chocolate at the end finishes out the taste.  This is one thick beer. Very chewy.

Taste - This beer is huge!!! Extremely complex taste with many layers -- intense alcohol at first which seemed to mellow with time (warmth or just me getting used to it?) sweet flavors from the smell come through very strong in the taste - cherry, licorice, with tones of caramel and chocolate (oak).  Mouthfeel - Really syrupy, smooth, and thick. Goes down surprisingly smooth for 13% but is a bit intense. Aftertaste is extremely sweet...  Drinkability - First sip I was not ready but as I sat with it for a while the complexity became more and more apparent and more and more deep.

An incredibly smooth beverage. Some dark roasted malt bitterness, but perfectly balanced with the bourbon edge. Sweetness invades with hints of vanilla and some molasses bite. Even at 13% (and this was a young bottle -- 2009), not a bit of chemical alcohol. You'd never know what a kick this one has. Creamy, smooth, and delicious, right to the lingering bittersweet finish.  A mouth coater for sure. And a sipper. You just cannot take big swills, not would you want to. The slow drinking necessity extends the pleasure of this beverage. Only drawback -- this 12 0z. brew (bought in MA) cost me $7.00. Very much a special treat for me, and more than likely I will pine for this when I see it, but won't spend the money again.

1549,10672,AndrewD1022,4.4,"This was a 2008 bottle that I have been storing for Christmas. The beer was poured into a regular pint glass.  The pour was like pouring out a coffee. There is no opacity when it is in the glass and even when you are at the very end of the drink it's still very dark. After the pour, the head does not stay at all. However, there is always a small ring of brown head around the glass.  Smell is very simple, think bourbon. With subtle hints of coffee and molasses. The smell is very smooth. Compared to my initial tasting of bourbon county stout it is a little smoother after a year.  The taste follows very closely with the smell. Hints of bourbon, sweet molasses, vanilla and caramel. Some smokey taste to it hits later on the back of your pallet.  The mouthfeel is very smooth at the beginning and sort of sneaks up in the end. With the hint of bourbon coming into play later in the taste, it really brings a whole new feel to the beer.  Drinkability is up to the drinker. I could probably have one of these every few days. However, for people not accustomed to this beer. It is a huge undertaking. Usually takes me about an hour to drink a full bottle.  This is one amazing beer.

The nose smells highly of alcohol but not in the gasoline-like sense. The scent of coffee or bitter chocolate accompanies it well.  Tasting this beer is a treat. Full, rich chocolaty flavor in the mouth with a slight sting in the back of the throat; really a full taste that I have trouble picking out all of its subtleties.

1549,10672,bismarksays,3.95,"2015 release A: Dark almost black, syrupy, no head or carbonation, hence no lacing. S: Sweet bourbon, sweet vanilla, brownie batter, creme brulee. Real sweet with no real balance, but not unpleasant by any means. T: Flavor bomb? I wish. Just more of the same that the nose said. Real sweet notes of vanilla, flan, creme brulee, bourbon. F: Burning hot bourbon, syrup, perhaps oily as well. Zero cabonation, no creaminess. O: This was once a treat of complexity, of careful aging, of the promise of good things today and great things to come. I am hoping this is a one year misstep. This tastes like the worst part of Assassian and Dragons Milk but with the balance of ST's Creme Brulee. Had trouble finishing a glass because of the cloying one note flavor profile. At least the price per ounce went up considerably. 2009 release A: Dark almost black. Looks thick. A small amount of tan head. 4 S: Roasted malt, sweet bourbon, coffee 4.5 T:Flavor bomb of bourbon, vanilla undertones, roasted malt (in between coffee and dark chocolate). Very well balanced for such an extreme stout. 5 M: Thick almost liquer like. It makes this one a sipper, which with flavors like these, it should be 4 D: Hard to rate the drinkability of a beer you really should have one of. I guess on one hand, I can really only drink one a night. On the other, I would drink one every night if the budget allowed. Worth the hype and the price. OVERALL 4.5 TASTER""S NOTE This was for 2009 and pre-editions fo BCBS. Other than a brief uptick in 2011, this beer has become slightly harsh with noticeable alcohol burn. Frankly, it feels like less time is done blending and selecting barrels than there used to be. Don't get me wrong, it is still good beer, just not what it was and worth the ever increasing hype. Now, it would probably rate closer to a 4.2 or 4.3 for me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste: Opens withe a rich sweet malty raisin profile which fluctuates in intensity from open to finish with a very sweet concord grape finish leaving a dark and malty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with no carbonation, smooth and coarse.  Drinkability: I would definitely have this again but I would only recommend this to those who seek rich dark malt profiles, dark sweet fruit and a subtle earthiness.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smells like a glass of bourbon; medicinal with some smokey notes mixed in. The alcohol hits you right away and warms your mouth. After the initial shock, the complexity of the beer comes out. With-in a thick, creamy body lies flavors of vanilla and caramel along with some hints of the malt before the alcohol makes a reappearance on the finish. This is a really complex, cool beer, but I don't think I could drink more than one.

1549,10672,Walken,4.45,"Goose Island: Bourbon County Stout (2008) (Tasted 12/06/09) 12 oz. bottle, poured into a tulip  Appearance: Hard pour yields a large, flat, mocha colored head that fades pretty quickly. The lace wants to hold on to the side of the glass, but it's just not happening. The beer is an inky, opaque, midnight black color. Odor: Overripe fruit on top, hefty bourbon & oak behind that with espresso and bakers chocolate in the back. Consistency: Medium full body with a definite oily slickness. Mild carbonation, oak-derived tannins and alcohol heat from the bourbon lend some astringency tugging at the tongue keeping the full body from feeling overly heavy. Taste: Damn man. This is good. Flavors are extremely well integrated. Oak & bourbon in front. Chocolate flavors are rich and diverse, a mix of dark and milk, the immense body contributing to the latter. Dark red fruitiness, almost wine-like, minor coconut. Background is filled out by charred wood and molasses flavors. Finish is akin to chasing some bourbon with a dark chocolate brownie.  This is an exceptional beer. I'd like to try this fresh, curious as to how much more intense the bourbon/oak is.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A: Strong burbon notes along with chocolate and roasty coffee. No hop aroma, this one is straight burbon.  T: This is where BCS shines. The barrel aging is supurb. Burbon notes are huge. Chocolate and roasty coffee are great. I get a great earthiness, and a smooth finish.  M: Next to no carbonation. Very oily, but smooth.  D and overall impression: Drinkability is just ok. the high abv acompanied with the oily mouthfeel makes it a little hard to swallow.

Smells of molasses, brown sugar, dark chocolate, tobacco, dark malts, cherry, vanilla. Some heavy alcohol in the nose here, as well.  Tastes is very alcoholic...incredibly strong. This beer is a sipper for sure. Tastes of creamy dark chocolate, cinnamon, molasses, heavy cream, vanilla, and, well, alcohol. The bourbon barrel flavor is prominent, as well...and it should be. But, it is not overpowering...it is quite well-balanced in the mix of flavors involved.  This is an impressive brew. Not one that is good for drinking in mass amounts, but one that is just right to sit around for a few hours and just enjoy. It's strong, high in alcohol, and has some big flavors.

I had my wife do a ""blind smelling"", she thought it was a wine or whiskey. The bourbon flavor is immediate. My palate is more geared toward wine right now so all I can say is this is extremely enjoyed this stout. Dark as night with the slightest silky head. The bourbon is what made me a fan.

Licorice, and vanilla as well. Taste focuses more on Good N' Plenty licorice, vanilla, and molasses with a bourbon undertone. So thick and goopy I feel I could get enough nourishment from the massive amount of malt that I don't have to eat for the rest of the day.  Delicious and immersive, I'd kill a man for this beer.

Scents of dark fruit and nuts.  T: First thing I taste is a nice thick walnut flavor followed by a slight buttery taste. This is so good.  M: Leaves a nice sticky walnut flavor in your mouth. Good carbonation.  D: Goes down super smooth. I can definitely pound these if I let myself. Gotta enjoy them slowly though and supress that urge.  All in all, this is one of my faves.

1549,10672,drowland,5,"(original tasting) 2008 - Bottle. So black light won't go through, and a nice lingering dark brown head. The aroma is endless with sweet malt, oak, vanilla, tannins, a touch of bourbon, and a dash of alcohol. The flavor delivers big sweet malts and a dash of alcohol upfront followed by hints of candied fruit and finishing with a lingering definite coffee flavor layered with chocolates.

1549,10672,jlindros,4.75,"Had the 08 and 07 and loved both. Now I get to try the 09 and finally review it. Got this one in a very quick and great trade by Lunch.  A: Screw top, really guys?! Pours with almost no head, a few bubbles here and there, but so goes the style. But the head that does come rings around the sides of the glass and leaves a lacing. The pitch black color gives midnight a bad name. I think I feel the souls of mortals all around being sucked into this pit of darkness and light void. Even at the very bottom where it thins, no light escapes and I think it was born from Nazgul!  N: Well it starts off with a very light NOTHING. It actually starts with heavy bourbon and oak. A sweet oaky bourbon aroma just dances out of the glass and gently bashes the heck out of your nose! This is followed by some rich dark stout malts, some roasted, some chocolate, then some sweet caramel. A touch of vanilla rounds it off to an overall awesomeness that smells better than, ummm, something that smells great. A touch of alcohol comes out as the glass warms.  T: Super rich thickness that makes crude oil blush. It's thicker than my boss (just kidding), and richer than Bill Gates. A luscious sweet malt flavor starts to grow, but is battled back by more heavy oak and bourbon flavors. A touch of dark fruit comes through, but barely. Then comes some more sweet caramel and perhaps molasses. Another wave of chocolate hits with a slight creamy flavor accompanied by vanilla and more caramel. Think everything sweet that tastes awesome and throw it together in one glass. A touch of alcohol flavor, but barely. This this is dangerous being 13% and drinks like 8-9%.  M: Very little carbonation, but so thick I think it's absorbing my mouth into it to become one entity. Very velvety smooth and heavy. Still rich and smooth. A little bit of alcohol burn and warmth but barely.  F: Still pretty sweet and super thick. It never really leaves as it leaves a huge thick coat on the mouth. It leaves a new layer like my body created a new layer of skin, but only super thick beer. A slight lingering bourbon flavor, but it's mostly the chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. The crazy dark heavy richness of this makes Ozzy look like a church. OK, enough with the bad reference, but this beer is ridiculously thick and luscious, as well as delicious!

Sturdy, strong... a stout.  S - Bourbon! wow.... bourbon very much in the forefront. Vanilla, Oak, some sweet rum like aromas emerge. Smoke, raisin and roast mingle inbetween. Beneath the bourbon lies a very complex aromas.  T - Bourbon lies a canvas to fresh roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla and resin. A smokey note lingers between the dark fruit and bourbon.  M - full bodied, no astringency and light carbonation. the classic approach to allowing these types of flavors to emerge.

1549,10672,hayesez,4.27,"2006 - 12 oz. bottle  Poured very dark and thick into a snifter. Even with a strong pour, there was no head at all. A tiny ring of brown bubbles revealed the only carbonation.  Definitely a strong bourbon smell in this one; always nice when the beer reflects its name! Also hints of wood and a bit of vanilla. The high alcohol reveals itself strongly.  The taste is very much what you would expect from the smell. A strong bourbon tinge is present start to finish. Some vanilla as well. As the drink is finishing, a coffee after-taste is mixed with some bitter chocolate. I really like how this finishes. The booziness is definitely present, and detracts a bit, but still a solid beer! As the beer warms up, the alcohol intensifies a bit, but the mouthfeel gets even better. The silky smooth feel over the tongue is just my style!  This is a great beer. The one detractor is the alcoholic taste in the beer. I figured this would have mellowed out quite a bit after being stored for three years, but it is still very present. The rest of the beer, however, has certainly smoothed over time as all of the flavors overlap each other to make a truly delightful brew. Definitely a beer I will continue to drink.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,craftaholic,4.35,Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz into a snifter this one is dark as night. The dark tan foam dissipates mighty quick.  Smell: This one is definitely a bourbon stout because that aroma is dominating. The scent is so strong that you could smell it across the room even with a house full of thanksgiving scents. Mixed into that lovely aroma is hints of nice oak and touches of chocolate and creamy vanilla.  Taste: The malt greets you up front and then the oaky bourbon opens right up. There is a dark fruits flavor that reminds me of chocolate covered cordial cherries and figs. This one is somewhat hot and im thinking with some age on it; it'll do quite well. There is a lingering burnt malt flavor and a dark chocolate nuance.  Mouthfeel: Robust and full bodied; it's nice and slick yet smooth it coats the mouth but in a nice dusting instead of a vicious syrup. Leaves the palate numb and coated.  Drinkability: It is quite intense but yet for what its worth its highly drinkable. It is definitely a sipper but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting.

Nose: A potent bourbon aroma strikes first. There is also a nice oak smell, hints of chocolate and vanilla.  Tongue: Happily the taste is very alike the aroma. The bourbon is strong, as are the other pieces; oak, chocolate, and vanilla. The only down side is that the alcohol is a bit too pronounced.  Mouth: Rich, thick and sticks to the palate.  Libation: A fantastic piece of brewing, the bourbon flavor is well married with a smooth stout beer. I can't say this is exactly ""drinkable"" as the intense bourbon body and 13% ABV combine for a glass one needs to nurse for a while. I took a good 45 minutes for just 10 ounces. I think this will age very well, so I'll be putting a couple bottles away to give away as Christmas gifts next year.  This is certainly a beer that only a quality craft brewer could produce.

It's not harsh, but I can tell it's of higher alcohol content. My mouth is left with the taste of roasted malt/coffee.  M: It is what I would expect out of a bourbon barrel aged stout, very little carbonation and thick.  D: This is a very drinkable, full-bodied beer, but enjoy it in moderation.

Roasted malt, bourbon, slight vanilla and chocolate.  Taste: Roasted malt upfront and then progresses into a nice bourbon flavor(vanilla, oak). Ends with a nice malt flavor. Some alcohol flavor but it does not overpower the other flavors of the beer.  Mouthfeel: Very thick with little carbonation. Great for this style of beer.

1549,10672,Hornet2003,3.52,"On-Tap at Goose Island Clybourne.  Interesting beer. The most intensely whiskey flavoured beer I have ever come across. Sour and musky woodsiness. Nice flavour but it is too much. Way too much for more than a taster. Sour and sweet bourbon flavour. The beer flavour is so masked it is flawed.  Interesting experience, but not an enjoyable experience if served in a greater than 5 oz sample.

S: I love how bourbon barrel aged things smell! Distinct smells of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. You can also find some subtle hints of coffee, chocolate, and cherries. Alcohol is also pretty apparent.  T: Tasty! Pretty similar to the nose: bourbon and sweet vanilla are most apparent. Very warm alcohol on the finish and aftertastes of coffee and chocolate linger for some time. Some oakiness is also in there. This reminds me of BT, but isn't nearly as complex. Keep in mind, however, that BT probably deserves about a 6 out of 5 for taste. What I'm trying to say is that Goose Island BCS is very good.  M: Smooth and chewy. The bite from the alcohol is a little harsh, but really not too bad.  D: As with most high quality Bourbon barrel aged stouts, this one is a tasty and complex sipper. I will definitely have this again, but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting.

1549,10672,lackenhauser,4.67,Jet black and very viscuous to pour. No real carbonation or head to speak of. Just the way this pours kicks it up a notch in my book. Heavy bourbon aroma with quite a boozy smell to it. Long lingering vanilla/oak smell. Huge roasted and imperial stout like flavor with the most intense bourbon flavors I have ever had in a beer. Over the top but not in a bad way. Even has the slight alcohol burn that you get in spirits-not like an overly alcoholic beer. Lingering burnt and bitter flavors-deep dark chocolate and roasted malt. Great body-thick and full. The alcohol flavor leaves quite the tingling sensation. A great beer all around. Quite in your face but well balanced in the long run.

S: Wow, such a complex smell, you would almost think that no beer could live up to the smell. Chocolate, a tinge of alcohol, oak. Other stuff is in there too, I just don't know if I am experienced enough to distinguish them.  T: Flavor explosion. For a 13% beer you notice the alcohol, but it's not the front and center you'd expect. Lots of vanilla and a hint of coffee. The flavors seem to be changing in my mouth as I write this. Very complex, I could take very short sips and nurse this beer all night long!  M: I would have expected a 13% beer to attack my mouth more, but this is very smooth.  D: The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is I could only drink one of these in a setting. Very amazing beer, but 12 oz of this will be your main course!  A wonderful beer.

Pronounced aromas of molasses, caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, hints of blueberries (weird, but there), cherry pop tart (also weird, but there), sweet-sweet alcohol, & light smoke. (Can't really detect much of a hop presence, but know it's there to balance out the sweetness of this beer.) The nose is full, sweet, and pretty. The beer has a syrupy texture, alcohol sweetness/burn/tingle, complexity, depth, and a long finish. Overall a very good beer that is extremely thick and syrupy sweet. Due to it's huge alcohol content, the beer is a bit off balanced and not exactly smooth.

1549,10672,dismal,4.4,"Had the 2008 and 2009 side by side for this one which I've been excited to do for quite some time. Poured into a snifter it pours jet black and thick like motor oil with a one finger dark tan head. The head quickly fades away and leaves little to no lacing down the glass. The smell is whiskey at first and upfront, it's followed by vanilla, oak, and chocolate. It seemed like the 2008 had more of a whiskey smell to it at first and as they warmed up the 2009 became more whiskey smelling and the 2008 had more chocolate when warming up. Taste was whiskey, vanilla, and chocolate. The 2009 had more of a whiskey taste while the 2008 had more of a chocolate taste making the 2008 way more drinkable and pleasant to drink. Both however had some whiskey in the taste it just wasn't as apparent with the age on the 2008. The mouthfeel differed greatly, the 2009 was kind of thin and the 2008 was very full, thick, and chewy. I thought it was pretty awesome how different these were with only one year between them. The main difference was taste and mouthfeel and with the one year it made it from a good beer to a great beer! I've also had this with about six months age on it and it was pretty good. The drinkability depends on this one. Fresh I'd give it a lower score (but still good) but with some age it become great even with the high ABV I'd love to drink a few of these. Overall fresh it's really good but I'd really recommend aging these for at least a year if not longer as it becomes more delicious. I'm going to age a few more of my 2008s for a while and I have plenty of 2009s to age and drink.

Color is black as night and unyielding to any light that might enter.  S: Smell is of strong bourbon, chocolate, and butterscotch.  T: Taste is strongly of bourbon and chocolate. Vanilla and anise are also there. This is an extremely complex beer with too many flavors to list, but they all seem to balance well with the bourbon.

1549,10672,Rizow,4.55,"A - Appearance starts with the bottle, and my introduction to Bourbon County Stout came not by any review or bartender's recommendation, but simply by noticing its label at the Lake Merritt Whole Foods in Oakland. When a beer's label tells me it's ""...dark and dense as a black hole..."" and that ""...one sip has more flavor than your average case of beer"", well, that grabs one's attention, innit?  Pours thick like motor oil, like molasses. It crawls out of the bottle into your glass. Dark, dark brown/black body, with a ring of caramel brown around the edge, and wisps of subtle white lattice lacing, too burly a beer to leave much at all of any foamy head. Looking straight down at it, into the goblet, it looks like a solar eclipse.  Smell - There's a strong, sweet nose to it. Roasted coffee, vanilla, and molasses are all mixed in with a burnt bourbon aroma. You can smell the syrup. It's immediately obvious that this is an extremely unusual beer.  Taste - The taste is a beast, bringing big, sweet flavors such as the omnipresent molasses, layered over the powerful alcohol. Somewhere buried deep, deep behind the monstrous front-end, there are fruity background notes, but more like bits of candied fruits embedded in a German Christmas cake. You can find burnt caramel, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and sweet syrup flavors throughout.  Feel - The very definition of a big, chewy stout; welcome to the beer-shake! Man, does this ever cry out for a big scoop of premium vanilla dropped right into the mouth of the glass! It creeps across the inside of your mouth, leaving a film over your tongue. Its feel (not its taste!) is almost like a medicinal syrup, like you're drinking it because your doctor prescribed it. It feels like quicksand in your mouth, threatening to pull you in.  Drinkability - This is no light summer sipping ale. It sits thick and heavy in your mouth, and fights with you going down. You'd only really ever go out of your way to finish a second bottle if you're making a point, like, a REALLY important point, to your unemployed drinking buddies. Packs a punch.  As someone who staggers through the night casting aside lesser beers in an unholy quest for that huge, chewy, sweet, powerful masterpiece, I am humbled in the presence of this superb, cruel, terrifying, glorious beer. It kisses you as it beats you. This is the one bourbon barrel aged stout to rule them all.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,manahansf,4.52,"Pours a clear light brown color with ruby red highlights and a thin lacy tan head. The nose is a light aroma of sweet malt with a background aroma of bourbon. Begins with a subtle grapefruit flavor which is followed by robust whiskey/alcohol flavor. Throughout the drink, there is a nice backbone of sweet malt/toffee flavors and a warming alcohol sensation. The mild full body has low carbonation levels and is very drinkable. The finish fades gracefully with a strong bourbon taste which is well balanced between sweet and dry.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TLove,4.5,"This beer is straight up outstanding. After several bourbon stouts and bourbon RIS imitators (with the exception, perhaps, of Schafly), I haven't had a single, well-balanced bourbon stout. This is a luscious beer.  Pours a deep, viscous black motor oil with a thin, dark brown head that retains poorly and leaves little lacing. There are smells of raisin and bourbon with some almond. There is a strong bourbon, very heavy alcohol and bourbon taste with heavy, dark chocolate and a really full body. Alcohol goes right up the nose and produces some quince and vanilla on the mouth with a slick, but not syrupy, feel. A bit difficult to finish due to the sheer complexity and slightly sour bourbon components to the malt. Nevertheless, I would drink several of these in a sitting if they weren't so damn strong.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,marvin213,2.97,"This beer looks like motor oil. Were it not for the slightest swirls of head, I'd funnel this into my car engine. The specks of head presence actually last, spinning slowly around as the liquid sits. Still, a foamier top would provide a more impressive production.  The smell is purty raw-dog bourbon. I mean it is sweet, sweet alcohol. Not sweet like sugared candy, but sweet like yeast-infested, alcoholic, sugar-laden slop. It's like a fraternity house on a football Saturday. It's strong, sweet, and unrefined.  The liquid's more quaffable than its sight or smell might attest. As the snifter reaches my lips, I brace as if I'm shooting a shotgun. Initially, the sip is sugary soothing--like a Pixie-stick. Even in this 2008, the alcohol is still hot: as I focus on taste and close my mouth to feel it, ethanol singes my cheeks and escapes thru my nose. It's an obnoxious beer but, by God, if it's a bourbon stout you want, it's a bourbon stout you get. Instead of having bourbon influence, this beer is like an android: 1/2 beer, 1/2 bourbon. It tastes like an average stout with a bourbon shot poured in it. It's a Kentucky car bomb.  The initial feel of every sip is a comforting layer of sweetness. As the sugar breaks down, however, you're left with a brow-furrowing, bourbony blaze. Even if served cold, this beer is HOT. Though extreme on these continuums, it's actually well-balanced. The sequence, though, from milk stout to liquor shot, might be better reversed.  Drinkability is less than average. How many beers actually taste like liquor? It's a novelty brew, and a good one. I'd like to keep one on hand to occasionally show the buddies. I know its aim is not everyday sessions, but it's not a real pleasant-drinkin' brew. It hits harder than 13%; in fact, it ain't far off from the 40% of its liquor counterpart. If you're just lookin' for a punch, perhaps you should consider the liquor approach.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: One smell tells you a lot with BCS. Dark cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, espresso, campfire, and a pretty decent amount of booze.  T: Very aggressive taste. Boozy from the start but mellows out towards the end. Comparative to the smell to say the least. Wood and campfire, vanilla and cocoa, booze and oak. Very complex taste and definitely not for the faint of heart beer drinkers.  M: Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium heavy to heavy feel with fairly low carbonation.  D: The drink takes a little hit with this big bourbon stout. Fair.  Overall, it's a fantastic brew but the high ABV and boozy character makes it tough to drink more than a bottle.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smells like booze, chocolate, fresh coffee, vanilla, and cream.  The mouth is creamy smooth. No carbonation bite at all. This is a big-time bourbon beer! Huge sweet vanilla notes, some oak, and malted chocolate. The liquor quality hasn't worn off very much after a year in the cellar. Alcohol is very present in the flavor. This is a very good beer, but I could not drink any more than this 12oz. Too boozy for me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,brewgirl,4.3,"Appearance: I had been aging this beer for a year and it poured a thick, black with a very thin tan head.  Aroma: This beer smells amazing! At first I got a ton of bourbon then I started to get vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, currants, and espresso.  Flavor: incredibly complex. The bourbon is very apparent but not too boozy. The malt profile is very rich with hints of coffee and dark chocolate and then there were layers of vanilla, molasses, and darker dried fruits. It was smooth and all of the flavors blended well.  Mouthfeel/Finish: Full bodied with a lingering bourbon, vanilla, finish.  Drinkability: This beer is delicious and very drinkable (despite the high alcohol). Unlike some bourbon stouts, this one is well balanced and the bourbon character is there without overpowering the beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,drtth,3.9,"Poured into a Duvel glass. A glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. This is a bottle from the 2008 bottling which means it has just over a year's bottle age.  Appearance: The beer pours out a dark black color with a 1/3"" medium brown head that soon recedes to a small ring around the glass and a thin layer of foam over the liquid that soon turns into a few patches of thin foam. Sipping leaves some small rings, bits of speckled lacing and some small sheets that slide back into the glass leaving behind small patches of foam. By the end of the beer there is neither foam nor lacing.  Smell: The complex aroma is detectable as the beer pours. It is rich and dark toffee like with hints of dark roast malt floating around. The parts of the aroma provided by the bourbon barrel lets you know that the beer was there for a while, with some definite presence of bourbon, vanilla and even some of the oak.  Taste: The flavors make it abundantly clear that this beer and a bourbon barrel have spent some time keeping company together. There is vanilla and oak here along with some dark chocolate, dark brown sugar, and dark toffee or butterscotch. Interestingly, the flavors change over time with some smoky bitterness coming into to play mid-way through to let you know there are roasted malts on the scene as well. The sweetness from the malts and the bourbon is nicely controlled so that neither dominates the other.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is full-bodied and very smooth with minimal carbonation. The finish is long. It begins with sweetness and bourbon and then fades a bit until the dark roast of the malts shows up. It then gradually turns dry and fades gently away.  Drinkability: The rich complexity of this beer is almost too much. Plan on taking your time with this one as you won't finish it quickly. Also if you don't like bourbon don't buy this beer. But if you do like bourbon and you like stout, this is an excellent example of a bourbon barrel aged stout, with emphasis on the bourbon barrel. While I'll not be drinking this one every night I'll be more than happy to have this one again as a special occasion beer. That being said, the problem I have with this beer boils down to a simple question: Where's the beer? In deciding what to pair this beer with I'd select food, etc. based on how well it goes with the bourbon, not how well it goes with the stout.  3 June, 2011  I'm now drinking my last bottle from this batch, and still have the same question. I like Bourbon, so I like this beer, but if I wanted to drink a stout this would not be my choice. The Bourbon still over powers this beer and the flavors and aromas are still all about the Bourbon.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Small tan head, maybe 1/2 finger at the most, bubbled up from the bottom and quickly receded.  S - Nice mild bourbon. I always worry that the bourbon smell on these is going to be overpowering. Definately present, but it's got a nice balance. Touch of sweet vanilla and toffee.  T - Outstanding, the mild smell of the bourbon is just about what you get in the taste. It's definately there, and it's good, but it doesn't kill the flavor of the stout. Slight fruity sweet taste makes this a fantastic drink.  M - Solid, not quite heavy like you would expect, but definatly full bodied. Carbonation seems almost non-existant.  D - So ridiculously drinkable for a 13%.

A thin head with tiny bubbles that disappear with the first sip. Color is an extremely dark brown, dense enough that my penlight does not begin to penetrate. Dark enough that if it were coffee that a spoon would stand at attention in it.  Aroma and flavor are very similar. Smoky oak, chocolate, vanilla and alcohol. The flavor has a strong taste of good bourbon.  Mouthfeel - This brew is going for a long cruise on my palette.  Drinkability - I am 30 minutes into this glass, about 2/3 down.

I am impressed it showed as well as it did considering the ABV. Intense aroma of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and alcohol. I can tell right now this is going to be a hot one. After one sip, it sure was hot. But there is plenty of flavor to make it worth drinking. A lot of vanilla and bourbon upfront with more subtle notes of chocolate, plums, and toffee. Finishes boozy with a lot of warmth. Full bodied with nice carbonation. If this had anymore carbonation it would be harsh with all the alcohol. This is the type of beer because of ABV and price, that is reserved for special occasions.

It even looks a little evil.  Smell: First thing that hits my nose is a burst of toffee. Which I think is something I get often from things aged in bourbon barrels. Then deeper there are soft notes of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, and a nice under lying spicyness. Delicious.  Taste: Holy balls....this beer is more complex than an escher painting. Where some beers taste mimics the smell, this beer has all those subtle notes that the nose has...but in the taste...amp those notes up ten fold, then add about twenty layers of complexity (all that after one sip)! Notes of milk chocolate, vanilla, rich toffee, and spicyness. This beer is super sweet. There might even be some sweet fruit notes. I could go on and on, but there is more that i need to analyze.  Mouth: Thick, chewy, juicy. This is thick and chewy, but it still maintains a smooth silkiness. It has a nice tingle from the light carbonation. Coats the mouth with its yumminess.

1549,10672,nomomentwasted,4.27,"Whew. Had this beer out of a bottle, poured into a snifter-style glass and served just below room temperature.  Appearance: Dark and vicious on the pour with a slight, tan head. Laces well, much like a stout should, but nothing about the pour or appearance screams anything more than your average imperial stout.  Smell: Whew. Big bourbon notes (although next to Black Tuesday, I would suppose they're a little more tame, but then again, what isn't?) and then a roasty, toasted malt filled second layer and finishing with a slight chocolate and vanilla, but mostly the bourbon and slight booziness.  Taste: Very complex, and a little sweeter than I was expecting. Bourbon is big and thick, with the booziness being quite strong. Chocolate and barley are here too, but on a secondary tier from the bourbon start. Although this wasn't the newest batch of BCS, it'd probably be just a tad better with another 6 months to a year on it. There are 6 more in the cellar though, and maybe I'll come back and update upon further review. I mean, I love a good bourbon beer, and when in the mood, this certainly delivers, but I think its strong suit is also what keeps it from being a 5: it's a little too much bourbon. Hopefully the mellowed sweetness will push that up a bit too, I really don't doubt it.  Mouthfeel: Ooh, so velvety and smooth. Powerful-good thickness and finishes warm. That 13% is definitely here, no doubt about it. Carbonation is spot-on too.  Drinkability: I feel bad knocking it, but it's not the most drinkable of beers. The boozy character catches up over the course of the bottle, but the rest of the experience is excellent. Drinks like a 13%, which hey, it is, making it feel pretty average in that department.

She sat the snifter down on the table and I could whiff the strong bourbon presence before even lifting it up. The bourbon smell totally overwhelmed any chance for ditecting any other smell notes coming off this beer.  T- One again the bourbon rules here. If it weren't for the malty smoooth finish to this beer I would have guessed that I was actually drinking bourbon straight up. Within the bourbon I got coffee and a little hops. But those flavors soon died because of the bourbon onslaught. This was definately a sipper and a one beer per visit deal.  The overall strength of this beer made having more than one out of the question. I had already had a few other different beers from the bar so I was certain that this would finish off my afternoon. Even at home I could not see myself having more than one, or if only drinking these 2 in a night. Any more for moe and it would quickly turn into a bad night.

It's cold outside and it is raining - I just got back from Orlando, making it feel even worse than it is... the bottle of 2008 Bourbon County Stout in my cellar is just screaming itself hoarse to grab my attention - I give in and pour the 12 oz bottle into a Portsmouth Brewery snifter.  Jet black with a granular brown sugar two finger deep beautiful head. It's a complete black out - light not standing a chance. Once the head fades down to a small brown lacing on the rim of the meniscus, I can actually see my reflection in the beer as I peer down at it. Tilted and held up to the window I start to see some of that Cola red on the edges. Really nice looking beer.  The smell is just intoxicating. Literally, the bourbon is done that well... it screams of dark chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow... even some graham cracker which delivers a very nostalgic freshly toasted smore aroma. And of course, the whisky... bourbon was the right choice here and it was aged to perfection. The maltiness of the big stout stand up just right... not giving into the bourbon, not even letting the bourbon lead the dance... the relationship is fair and equal. As it warms I get more dark fruits - specifically cherries  This was bottles almost exactly a year ago (10/21/08) and time has been a friend to this one. The bourbon is still there - very present and it doesn't fade. Long after each sip you taste wet wood, bourbon and maple syrup... and yes - it's sticky. Then there is the smoked malt and bitter dark chocolate that comes with it. There is a fair amount of smokiness here as well - somewhere in between what actual smoke tastes like and what ""liquid smoke"" brings to the table. Vanilla beans mixed with coffee beans is the other taste that comes to mind. Complex for sure and again - choosing bourbon minimizes any harsh peat flavor, but still brings the characteristic which is well received.  Mouthfeel is sticky and good. Nice full, thick body with a perfect amount of carbonation for a 13% barrel aged stout... maybe even a touch too carbonated at first. There is no getting around the booze here, it doesn't try to hide... it is right there for you. The first thing you smell when you open the bottle and the taste that remains coated in your mouth long after the last sip. But the incredible blend of malts (and I imagine incredible amounts) allow for the bourbon to do that. It works so perfectly.  What a fine offering from Goose Island. I took my time here and it was such a great experience... changing as the beer opened up, the vanilla changing from more caramel based at first to something rooted in dark fruits at the end. I imagine I will be drinking a good amount of this during the upcoming winter.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nice complexity, a great tasting stout.  Milkshake like texture, as full a body as I've ever had. Extremely dry finish. Syrupy smooth. Warming sensation from the alcohol.

1549,10672,taylorhamrick,3.83,"Pours dark and slow. Looks thick and heavy, syrupy. Very black, looks just dense and heavy in the glass. The head is kind of thin, but it still looks very appetizing. The smell is just all bourbon. A little more bourbon than I was expecting, and its a 2008. I'm not even sure that I can detect anything else with out trying very hard. I mean, if you want a bourbon stout - this should satisfy you. The taste is like sweetened bourbon, with quite a bit of chocolate and a hint of coffee. I get a little hint of sticky malt, but mostly woody, slightly burnt bourbon flavor. Really interesting, and the bit of roastiness cuts the intensity. The body is really great. Thick and heavy, and the alcohol and burntness kind of helps to make it feel thin enough to swallow. The carbonation is dialed back, which is definitely a good thing. The drink is very slow. Sipper status, but quite enjoyable. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one of these in a month, but I would like to drink this more than quite a few similar beers.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Heavy full chewy viscous mouthfeel with such a smooth creamy body that I can't believe this beer is 11%. The alcohol heat is excellently masked. Lots of wooden earthy oak notes and bourbon flavor with hints of subtle vanilla. Also a good bit of roasted chocolate malt, burnt toast, coffee, oatmeal and Bourbon! So creamy, smooth and well balanced. This beer is incredibly mellow afte the three years of aging. Nice alcohol warmth in the finish with some subtle hops. This beer is absolutely fantastic.

Bourbon covers almost all other aromas. Some roasted barley and coffee coming through as well. as a lover of bourbon stouts this is right up my alley.  T- like some bourbon? my answer is yes. luckily too, because this amount could drive alot of people away. there is a very robust stout under all the bourbon. it's kind of hard to pick out some of the flavors through the bourbon. I can taste a good amount of bitterness from some coffee and hops. I'm guessing the IBUs are fairly high here. some chocolate in the backround gives it some espresso type qualities. absolutely awesome combination of flavors. I really wish I had access to this beer.  M- thick and tasty stuff. a good amount of carbonation really sets off the bitterness provided by the coffee and hops. spot on for the style.  D- I'm rarely halfway through the glass before I get to this point.

The smell is strong of bourbon, oatmeal, vanilla, and molasses. The taste is very boozy--wood, bourbon, burnt malts & oats are all there.

This is one of the best beers that I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. This 2008 poured out a deep dark color with a very thin head due to the 13% alcohol that was surprisingly drinkable. The flavor was robust with that of dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee and dark berries like cherry and plum . . . very malty and sweet. This beer is overwhelming in every sense. Simply amazing.

The aroma is all bourbon. Vanilla, wood, as expected. The taste was huge. Big bourbon flavor, huge amounts of roasted malt, some bittersweet chocolate and a touch of hop bitterness. It was pretty ""hot"" though. Definite ethyl alcohol taste. Not overpowering but certainly evident. The mouthfeel was damn near perfect, thick and syrupy. The drinkability was low because of the ABV, big flavors, and mouthfeel. Not nearly as drinkable as KBS.  Overall a beer I'm glad I picked up and tryed.

Flavors are very one dimensional and bourbon forward. Soy sauce pushes at the edges with a hint of smoke. Alcohol not overwhelming in the taste, but warms the body and numbs the brain quickly.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily with little to no carbonation. This, coupled with the overstated bourbon, hurts drinkability. This beer is far more enjoyable when drank in smaller servings.

Appearance: Black, thick looking motor oil with a cappuccino head that attempts to form but mostly fails.  Smell: Oak, molasses, vanilla, chocolate and alcohol. The smell is simply overpowering...  Taste: ...as is the taste. Definite Bourbon taste due to the strong oak, vanilla and alcohol. The stout characteristics of roasted malt and chocolate are present but in the background.

T - interesting combination of flavours. the initial is caramel, chocolate, bourbon, and charred oak in no particular order, though, the whiskey might come out on top. the finish is quite boozy; the roasted malts come out with the strong bourbon flavour to even it out a bit more, but the strong whiskey flavour come out on top; there is also a large molasses contingent, really large. the aftertaste is mostly molasses, brown sugar, and whiskey. If you dont want to taste oak and whiskey, then this beer is not for you!

A side note, I had this over a month ago, a few weeks ago, and obviously right now. I will culminate my reviews.  Appearance - Pours out an absolutely thick, 10,000 mile dirty oil consistency. I obtain about two fingers worth of dark, mocha colored head that dissipates relatively fast. Honestly, at first the lacing is a bit lackluster but my god, this brew looks just menacing.  Smell - Molasses on the forefront, obviously bourbon, chocolate, alcohol, smokey smells, etc. Smells utterly amazing. As stated, this is my third time trying this and I am fidgeting in anticipation.  Taste - Very similar to how it smells - I taste the molasses and chocolate immediately then a taste of...dark cherries comes through. Midway I taste the bourbon and then with finally I taste the chocolate yet again. My GOD...I rarely get so excited over beers but what a way to end a great night.  Mouthfeel - Utterly and totally thick. Chewy, warm, oily...everything you would expect from a 13% abv imperial stout. This reminds me of great times in MI this summer. Not high carbonation but fitting for thie brew.  Drinkability - As someone so eloquently put it, ""One and I'm done."" I don't think I could have more than one of these in a sitting.

Poured into my pint glass, this beer was very dark brown and clear, although when I tried to shine a flashlight through it, it was totally opaque. No head to speak of.  Aroma... oh my god what is going on in there! Roasted malt, roasted barley, a definite kick of bourbon, bitter chocolate as it warmed, and vanilla if you looked for it. Mighty nice.  Taste started out with dark malts, charred oak, and bourbon. Roasted character then would come in after the swallow, with a faint hint of alcohol. Aftertaste surprisingly made me think of red delicious apples.  Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and silky. Low carbonation, it's a little slick and oily but well bodied. Hides the 13% ABV incredibly well.  Drinkability is freaking awesome. It is going to be SO hard cellaring the SECOND bottle he sent.

Pours pitch black. It's like staring into the depths of space. Very thin layer or carbonation clings for its life to the side of the glass.  Smells of dark roasted malts with some chocolate notes. Slight alcohol smell, but not enough to worry about. Smells delicious, even with my stuffed up nose from these damn allergies.  Taste = wow! I have never given a 5 in any category to any beer until now. Dark chocolate comes to the forefront quickly. Nice creamy texture on the back palate. Aftertaste lingers quite nicely of the dark chocolates.  Mouthfeel = this beer coats the tongue like nothing I've ever had. Very thick viscosity, honestly reminds me of motor oil.

Well, GI Bourbon County Stout is very sweet too, and it's awesome. Why the difference? I've no idea, in fact, I love single malt scotch. What was overbearing sweetness in the Lees, was just right in the GI, even though they were similar. There was an alcohol taste in both, should not have made much difference. Maybe it was the over ripe fruit taste in the Lees, whereas, the GI had a coffee background... I duh no. I just love the Bourbon County Stout. It poured as black as a January midnight in Barrow, Alaska. A modest head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma was largely alcohol with some coffee.

Mouthfeel: Unbelievably heavy, rich, and viscous  Drinkability: High for the abv, but don't be stupid with this one, it will make you sorry  Conclusion: This is the best GI stout for sure, though I like it a bit better on tap I think...I'm really looking forward to keeping a couple of these 2008's in the cellar and seeing what they do in a couple of years",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,EliottJW,3.93,"This is a truly complex beer from start to finish that I found myself craving after I tried out black tuesday at the bruery. if you read my review of black tuesday, you'll note that this is what I was reminded of, though BT was 20x more drinkable, and that one stayed true.  poured a viscous pitch black with practically no head to speak of. the bubbles which WERE produced by a vigorous pour quickly dissipated and stuck to the sides of my glass leaving a thick, espresso brown lacing behind.  smelled buttery right off the bat, then giving way to soy sauce, then giving way to molasses, then giving way to bourbon and finally heavy roasted malts... the malts and bourbon commingled for a while before ending on somewhat of a sweet note. you know before tasting the stuff that it's gonna take you on a real ride.  upon the first sip, the bourbon is QUITE apparent and seems to be mixed in with a bit of butterscotch and table, or granulated sugar. toasty malts are apparent all the way throughout, but the bourbon shines extremely brightly on this one... it's aptly named... and a touch hot for my tastes, but that's just to say that I know I'm not going to be able to handle a whole ton of it. after letting this one sit a long while in between sips, I get a faint hint of dark chocolate.  the mouth was just as expected, full and creamy with a very low carbonation. it's viscosity made itself known all the way through. in my opinion, there was a need for a touch more carbonation, but it wasn't to the point of a huge fault. it drank like a big beer drinks... which translated to ""GJ Goose Island"".  Lowest score of all for me was the ""drinkability"". taking this literally makes me want to score it a bit on the lower side. I know for a fact that I couldn't dream of handling two of these back to back. to be honest, the flavor profile of this beer changed dramatically as it warmed up and I think I preferred it cold. this is a great beer that I'm hoping will mellow out considerably with a couple of years on it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Poured from a kinda cold bottle into a shaker pint. 2008 bottling.  Pours a murky black with no light showing through. Head is pretty much non-existant save for a small ring. This is a barrel aged beer with a 13% ABV so, no biggie there.  Aroma on the front is dextrose and oakey bourbon. Molasses and burnt brown sugar. Middle is earthy and intensly malty with a hint of vanilla. Copper and blood metallic aromas yield to a darkly roasted coffee with a touch of smoke. Finishes sweet with a slight funk, like barn dirt mixed with old manure.  Flavor opens with boozy bourbon and fusel alcohol. Darkly roasted malt gives way to sweet molasses in the middle. Molasses meld with caramel, cream and a hint of syrupy sweet sap.Vanilla on the finish with sweet and heavy booze. Finishes with a dark roasted coffee and chocolate sweetness. Chocloate is dry like eating unsweetened cocoa or bakers chocolate. Depth of flavor is awesome.  Mouth is thick and syrupy, viscous and chewy. Carbonation is non-existant and the beer may have done a little better with a small amount of carbo to cut the sweetness slighly. A nice stick is left on the lips.  Very nice for a sit down.

So just black now.  Bittersweet chocolate, pipe tobacco are what I pick up on my first sniff. Roasted barley comes into focus upon subsequent passes. Also, a nice bit of bright hopping is evident. This lends a nice earthiness to the bouquet, without standing in the way of the main focus.  My first thought is wow, this is all over the place. But as I really taste the beer, it's just that it's full of flavor. Bourbon is evident, but far from overpowering. Dark chocolates, tobacco, roasted bitterness all come out to play. I'm not picking up any of the hops I noticed in the nose, but I'm also not complaining. This is top notch taste. Not an overpowering alcohol component, however my lips do seem to be a bit hot.  Mouthfeel. Hmmm....well, if scientists ever figure how to make silk edible, they'll name the new discovery something like ""Goosus Islandcus"" Actually, that's a weird thing to say, but the mouthfeel here makes me very happy. Very smooth silky texture, and a good low level of carbonation let's the flavors sing loud and proud.  Overall drinkability, however would be somewhat low. For me, anyway. Due to somewhat high cost of this beer (which is absolutely a fair price), and the limited availability, mixed with the high alcohol content is going to keep me from drinking this on a regular basis. But I will be looking forward to this beer, year after year, and will always thank heaven when I'm able to sample it.

Nose is of bourbon and booze predominantly with only the slightest hint of chocolate. Taste is HOLY bourbon batman! Major booziness and a strong bitter chocolate presence, roasted malts a slight undertone to this beer. Medium to full bodied, low carbonation, thick feel on the tongue and chewy.

1549,10672,LoRezDave,4.55,"Bottled 10/10/08 - nine months in the bottle before i popped it.  Aroma: Licorice, whisper of cinnamon, sherry  Mouthfeel: thick and coating but in a wonderful way like, um, being coated in burbon county stout! Zero carboniation but some sharpness comes through from the high abv  Taste: bourbon, boozy, sweet rich dark malts, licorice, vanilla, and mre sherry. A bit ""hot"" the flavors are fantastic but could use some more melding - time will serve it well. If you have the patience.  Appearance: zero carbonation produces zero head even w/a hard pour, but the depths of it's blackness are infinite.  Drinability: despite the sky-high abv, slight hotness, and still a bit ""green"" flavors this is a hugely drinkable and tasty beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,carps12,4.17,"Poured into my duck rabbit snifter. 2007 vintage. Pitch black. Very thin head on the outer edge. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak on the nose. Sweet bourbon upfront followed by a roasted malt finish. Loads of vanilla. There's a bitterness mixed with oak also on the finish that could be better. Not hot at all like when fresh. Bourbon nose definitely subdued because of age which I enjoy more. Mouthfeel is creamy with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Well another 6 months before I try another.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,berkey,4,"From notes last night. 2008 bottling poured into a tulip.  Pours tar black. Possible the darkest beer I've ever seen. Out of curiosity I held the glass directly to the lamp trying to see if light would peek through but this sucker is dense. Forms a small brown head with hints of red but it withers away pretty quickly.  Malty sweetness, chocolate, and alcohol dominate the secondary oak aromas. Gets more and more roasty and smokey as it warms.  First taste brings on much more coffee than the nose followed by the same chocolate malty sweetness. Secondary flavors are the expected oak, vanilla and some sticky caramel syrup but these are relatively faint. At about room temperature I'm starting to get more rich cocoa, tobacco, and something spicy that almost reminds me of steak sauce (I know it sounds strange but it's in my notes so I'm typing it here).  Slight alcohol burn on the mouthfeel which is interesting. Not thin but not as creamy as some other stouts. Not too bad on the drinkability for a beer this big.  Overall I'll say it's nice to have a year round Bourbon aged stout but I've had better. I really wanted to love this one but while I enjoyed and gave high marks I have to admit I was a little let down. Maybe my expectations were too high.

It takes a lot to coax out some foam. The beer is way black and thick.  S- Heavy on alcohol and bourbon. Lots of alcohol, it becomes similar to rubbing alcohol at times. This smells very very boozy and hot. Oak, vanilla and chocolate try to make a dent in the alcohol with little luck.  T- Very very very nice. Lots and lots and lots of vanilla.

I've had much hotter stouts w/bourbon or brandy that are much less thick and less abv. One of the best imperial stouts ever. And I know it will get better for years to come making it a good investment even for the higher price. Only downer is drinkability d/t thickness and heat. *2020 update: having a 2014 bottle.

A: Pitch black no head after a pretty vigorus pour and a small dark brown ring appears after it settles.  S: Smells of dark fruit, molasses, oak, and very slight vanilla. Up front and in your face...one of the best barrel aged stouts as far as aroma goes. As it warms you can smell the alcohol and a big whiskey smell.  T: Taste mimics the nose, dark over-ripe fruit, deep chocolate malt, molasses, and sweet vanilla. The aftertaste is almost cloying it's so sweet. As it warms it shows it's RIS backbone and the aftertaste isn't as sweet although the molasses is still there.  M: This is without a doubt the thickest beer I've ever had. This feels like motor oil as it coats the mouth and goes down the throat. Carbonation is very light and barely shows itself when you swish it in the mouth. Even with the low carbonation the stuff has the best feel in the mouth than any other Imperial Stout I've ever had.  D: Given the ABV I could probably drink 1 or 2 12oz bottles before switching to something lighter but this stuff is pretty good.  Overall this is great but I was expecting something slightly different. I guess I was expecting more bourbon and vanilla creamy flavors than what was there. I know bourbon, I drink the good stuff all the time but I really couldn't pick it out of the other aromas. The lack of carbonation also kept me from rating it higher on the appearance.

1549,10672,JRhode,4.69,"Split a 2008 vintage 12 oz bottle with jessethehutt; poured into Duvel tulip.  When I first drank this beer soon after release I think it would have been a B+/A- beer, losing points for being overly boozy/hot. This beer has rounded out nicely in the months since.  Pours a syrupy viscous black. Little to no head. Maybe I should have roughed it up a little. Maybe one of the thickest beers I have poured.  The first smell that hits me out of the glass is sweetened coconut, followed by bourbon/oak, vanilla, and some mole asses. This is the cold stone creamery of beer smells: a bunch of sweet treats mashed up together.  First taste impression is of sweet bourbon and vanilla. I pick up a little bit of coffee, chocolate, and coconut too. Al little alcohol burn on the finish. A lot going on.  Coats the mouth completely and almost requires chewing. Feels as thick as it looked pouring into the glass. Maybe a little lacking in carbonation?  The six ounces I drank pushed me over the edge. The 13% abv is no joke. I would probably guess 10-11% abv blind though.  One of those beers that is the poster child for aging.

Smells delicious, good bourbon is dominant, followed by some vanilla, sweet molasses, and oak.  T- Again, big bourbon flavors, buttery roasted malt, woody bite too. What's amazing about this one is how it matures on the palate. There's a clear evolution from the bourbon to the roasted flavors and the lingering wood flavor. Finally finishes with an herbal hop bitterness. Some chocolate comes through as it drinks. Slightly hot, but nothing unbearable. Some vanilla in there too. Exceptional. This is a big beer that's definitely worth seeking out.  M- Thick, viscous, coating. Just how I like my stouts.  D- This one is a sipper for sure. Drinks like a nice bourbon... delicious.

S: Oak, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, smoke. Very complex interesting smell.  T: Vanilla and molasses up front. Molasses-y bourbon in the middle, and a smoky coffee/charred oak finish. Kinda creamy as well. Great depth of flavors, but a tad unbalanced (clearly in favor of sweetness). I could see how this could be a good cigar beer as the label indicated.

Solid black, viscous with brown head. Amazing. Aroma is very melty with lots of dark fruity. Black cherry and fig. Very sweet. Flavor is very dark fruit and a chocolaty, rich malt sweetness. It is very, very rich and very, very boozey. The strength of the flavor may take away from it a bit by some. Mouth is also as good as it gets for heavy stouts. Super thick. Viscous like molasses. Also with very crisp carbonation. The beer is so rich that it can be a bit overpowering.

Some nice scents of vanilla, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt.  T- Whoa, this is one bourbony booze bomb! Tons of bourbon vanilla flavor blasting away with reckless force. Major oak and roasted caramel malt flavor that comprise a majority of the taste. Alcohol is quite apparent, although this brew does way in at 13.00%.

Pours black as night with a small quarter inch dark brown head that scatters quickly leaving swirls that dance upon the top of the beer. Smell is bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon. Some vanilla, wood, and chocolate too (dipped in bourbon).

Not quite what I would call ""harsh"" though, which is a positive. Background flavors include chocolate, wood, and burnt caramel. Full bodied and creamy, exactly how an imperial stout should be.

Head retention and lacing are mediocre at best  Smell is mostly of dark fruit, raisins and figs. Chocolate malt and alcohol are also detected. Hops are very faint and not really in there. Dont get much oak or bourbon but as the beer warms up the alcohol gets stronger  Holy shit this is so rich. First taste is of sweet chocolate Hersheys syrup. Then tons of smoke, oak, vanilla and alcohol come in. The flavors are so strong, they're almost overpowering. Hops are pretty tame and are mostly in the aftertaste. For 13% alcohol, there is a warming sensation and the alcohol is definitely present. Never really got the taste of soy sauce that alot of people talk about in Stouts but this one had a bit of that flavor  Mouth feel is very full. Thick body but wish there was more of a head. Carbonation is also good, not too much there but enough to liven up the beer  Drink ability is above average for a beer this big. I could possibly drink two of these at a time but its definitely a sipper.

1549,10672,realmpel,4.62,"This is a 2008 bottle, served in a tulip. The guy before me wrote a kick-ass review; I'd just say ""ditto"" but I'm determined to write my first review tonight.  Appearance: It's a thick, deep black. It pours like a thick syrup, yielding about a 1/4 inch of deep amber head which quickly disappeared. There is nary a bubble in sight, just an extremely thin rim of foam around the outside of the glass which leaves a very thin lacing when I sip it.  Smell: A perfect score. Butterscotch and caramel hits my nose first, with of course the bourbon aroma always lurking. It's a delicious aroma which begged me to take a sip.  Taste: Initially, the heat of the bourbon was too strong for me. As the beer warmed, the bourbon taste mellowed and blended better into the chocolate malty flavors. I think this beer is best served at around room temperature. There is a slight bitter chocolate flavor that lingers for half a minute or so. Nothing dominates; I think this beer is very well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Warm and syrupy, nicely coating the mouth.  Drinkability: I would have another if I had super-tolerance. It's a great beer.

1549,10672,ricke,4.42,"2008 vintage.  A: This one is as black as they come and is really viscous. I've had this before and I know it's hard to get head development going. So I tried a rather aggressive pour into my snifter, but all I got was a minimal layer of dark beige foam that dissipates immediately into a minimal ring of lacings.  S: The smell is amazing. Massive bourbon aromas sit side by side with a wonderful smooth stout base. Vanilla, almonds, oak, licorice and a hint of soy sauce. Some hints of brown sugar and molasses. The roasted malts really need to struggle to keep up with the bourbon, but I think they manage quite well. The bourbon gets a little boozy and I pick up plenty of alcohol fumes.  T: The taste follows suit and surly doesn't disappoint, even though expectations get cranked up by the appearance and smell. The bourbon flavors are really powerful, rich and full, but nonetheless the beer manages to stay balanced. Lots of vanilla and oak with notes of almonds. Hints of sweet licorice. Perhaps a suggestion of soy sauce. The roasted malty character is noticeable but it gets a little hard to detect with all the bourbon notes going on. Nevertheless, the malts manage to create a good balancing point for the powerful bourbon flavors. All in all, the beer has a pleasant balance between sweetness and a salty note. The usual flavors of dark fruits and chocolate are really hard to pick up in this one, but I do think here is a delightful note of truffles. The finish is loaded with boozy and hot alcohol that fits nicely with the sweetness from the bourbon and malts, but it gets a little too much here and there. Wood, notes of salt licorice, a light herbal bitterness and long-lasting bourbon notes round everything up.  M: Very very viscous and smooth - this one is thick like cream. Medium, well suited carbonation. Although both smell and taste is great in this one, the mouthfeel is really the highlight here, it's just that great. It just delivers a sophisticated expression to an otherwise bold and cocky beer.  D: This is a good imperial stout, to say the least. Very powerful with a massive bourbon character. It's quite impressive that it still manages to come of as balanced. However, it's not perfect. Although this is obviously a sipper, the alcohol gets to demanding and overpowering every now and then. And due to the onslaught of the bourbon flavors, the beer looses some complexity.  NOTE: This bottle was about 11 months old. I've sampled a bottle from the same batch when it was reasonably fresh, and although I think it holds up really well with plenty of bourbon still hanging around, I think the bourbon notes have faded just a little bit.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I had this back in February and loved it, and wanted to see how it had changed in the last 9 months.  Poured half into my Darkness Tulip and half into a standard pint glass for my friend who is a self-proclaimed bourbon fiend. I figured he would enjoy this one, so I offered to share some.  Pours a viscous black motor oil like liquid. Black as night. Thick and slimey almost. A good swirl shows one of it's best qualities, the ability to temporarily stain the glass a murky and evil brown. I tried hard to get a nice head, but I failed, barely making a one finger head in my tulip. My buddy, on the other hand, produced a much more impressive one in the pint glass. Decent retention but not much lacing. This is some thick stuff.  The bourbon has definitely dropped off in the last 9 months, but it is definitely still there. I'm kinda shocked at how much this has changed in such a short time. Big bourbon scent with subtle vanilla and oak hints. I get a significant portion of burnt malts and sugars.  Taste is a lot like I remembered, big bourbon punch. Thick and creamy. I get a lot more vanilla and oak than I did in the 2008 bottle I had in February. The bourbon has dropped off a bit, but there is shadows of it's former self. I get bitter chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. My friend commented on how this would make a great dessert beer. I would agree with that.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. It slides around your mouth, coating it much like it coats the glass. I've never had motor oil, but I would imagine this is the same consistency as that.  While the 13% is barely noticeable, the drinkability definitely takes a hit in this one. It's not that it's hard to drink, it's just the consistency of the liquid coupled with the big flavor. Besides, if you chug this you deserve a slap in the face.  I would recommend this to someone who loves big beers and bourbon.

I don't remember the last time I didn't finish a beer. Just dreadful bleck. A friend with me shared my opinion.  This beer either represents the Emporers New Clothes of craft beer or there was something wrong with this bottle. It looked a fine dark brown/black. The smell was of molasses, burned things,raw alcohol and more burned molasses. A hint of overheated radiator was one of the better scents. The taste was big and layered, but the waves of burned sugar, gloppy sorghum, alcohol, just kept coming like a string of plague rats jumping into my mouth. I'm not sure of the mouthfeel, as I was too busy thinking of ways to apologize to my tongue.  If you took a Guinness and let it bounce around in your car trunk for a summer spent in the desert, added various burned molasses concoctions and some bourbon you had washed your feet in, you might approximate the flavor.

Mine said bottled on 10/05/08 and I opened it on 7/16/09, so it was just over 9 months old when I tried it. The Goose Island website said it will keep for 5 years, so I was well within the optimum tasting range.  The pour was black as oil with a slight purple tinge when held to light. There was absolutely no head, foam, or lacing anywhere to be found.  The smell was a heavenly mix of bourbon, chocolate, and caramel. I couldn't wait to taste it.  This is one delicious beer. Bourbon is the predominent flavor but it is not overwhelming. Chocolate and caramel malts along with a burnt wood barrel and coffee-like flavor add to the deliciousness. The addition of Willamette hops gives this beer a 60 on the IBU scale and helps to balance out all the sweet flavors.  The mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied with just enough moderate carbonation to make this easy to drink. The high alcohol content of 13% warms the throat and keeps this beer a sipper for sure, but if it didn't give me a head buzz after just one glass, I could have downed these all night.  This was my first crack at a barrel-aged bourbon beer and all I can say is that either Goose Island did one hell of a job with this one or else bourbon style beer is going to be one of my favorite styles from now on.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,thryn,4.82,"2006 bottle. St. Bernardus goblet.  Rough pour yields no head. It's black as pitch, and looks viscous. There's a thin tan ring around the edge.  Smooth but strong scent. Spicy oak. Leather. Vanilla, tobacco. Bourbon -- but it's not overwhelmingly boozy.  Very difficult to divorce taste from mouthfeel because this is so viscous. But gods, it's delicious. Leather, vanilla and oak dominate up front, with the alcohol providing a warmth much like that of a bourbon, but never dominating the taste. It's spicy at the middle and finishes with a deep, burnt chocolate/coffee flavor. I can't do this justice in description. It is simply delicious. I desperately wish I lived in a place where this beer was available. It may soon taste of salt, for I know it will be my last for a long, long time.  Motor oil thick on the palate, but with just a smidge of carbonation, even after 3 years. It's thick as hell and sticky, but manages to finish surprisingly clean, coating the palate just enough to make me reach for the glass again. The alcohol gives it a nice whiskey warmth that rushes through the sinus cavities after it's swallowed. Invigorating.  I dunno, is a beer like this *ever* ""drinkable""? It's a sipper for sure, but a damn good one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,cdpike,4.49,"Pours thick black, almost no foam. Nose is of rickhouse, oak, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, alcohol...something I can't quite put my finger on...cheap licorice! Taste of all the same things, finishes big with a nice medium roasted coffee taste. Not particularly bitter, or dry and surprisingly sweet. Second taste brings a strong essence of chocolate at the front. Wow. BIG beer. This glass is gonna take a while.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bobsy,3.85,"I'd heard about this beer, but was completely unaware that it rated so highly when I had it at Viggo's, so thanks for sharing, man! That said, I think my ignorance helps remove any potential hype around this one, and even after that I have to admit its a pretty damn good beer.  Very dark brown pour, with limited retention and no lace. Roasty nose with a bourbon spiciness and alcohol underneath. Interesting flavour - obviously lots of bourbon, but with caramel peat and brown sugar thrown in. Mostly bourbon, though, and a nice one. Very solid body, quite chewy and thick with low carbonation. Its pretty damn drinkable for an impy, but the alcohol is damn dangerous.  Cheers Eric!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,melagnus,4.17,"2008 Vintage - Served in Brandy Snifter  A - SRM 50 Black sludge-looking liquid pours ominously into the Brandy snifter. The beer was poured at moderate-pace, so head was not even finger-thick. The color of it though looks a smoked dark hue, which gives the appearance of roasted coffee. It fizzles down pretty quickly, which indicates lower levels of carbonation and when swirled, leaves little lacing.  S - Sweet vanilla mixes with the boozy esters of Bourbon and caramel. Smoked woody character attempts to balance out the sweet malt. A toasty character also comes through, though no hops are evident.  T/M/D - Full-bodied beer with sludgy mouth-feel that coats the palate thoroughly with rich vanilla, caramel and a kiss of hops. The finish is very wet with a lingering caramel/vanilla/chocolate mix of malt. The bourbon comes on strong and the booziness definitely warms the body and provides a slight sting in the top of the mouth. Bourbon-aspects also come through, which is what provides the aforementioned sting. This beer definitely hits the extreme levels of beer and drinkability is one at most. This beer is meant to be sipped over a long cold evening, though one can drink the beer indoors at night over a long movie in the confines of air conditioning.  C - A very complex beer that requires a lot of respect by the drinker. At 13% ABV, I definitely won't be having another!!!  Prost!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A lot going on here... First I'm struck by the milk-like softness in the texture and the low carbonation; next comes the flavor, which is a lot of bourbon on top of big stout flavors; pretty hot, and weighing in at 13%, it's definitely a sipper; not a fan of the flavors here...just too bourbony, making it one-dimensional  Overall Not being a fan of bourbon/whisky, I just am not getting into this beer. It's so heavy and boozy, with the bourbon really overpowering the profile, that I don't even think I can finish half the bottle!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,hike20,4.3,"Pours nearly black with thick but vanishing head. Lacing clings to glass. No light at all passes through the glass. Aroma of bourbon overpowers all others. Better try this one sitting down or it will knock you over! The label proclaims &lt;i&gt;""One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer""&lt;/i&gt; and they are not kidding. Thick bodied, with powerful bourbon flavor with notes of chocolate and coffee. This is some strong stuff, meant for sipping, which is good because at that strength you aren't going anywhere soon I hope. Very good!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,laituegonflable,4.42,"Pours very dark, with a brown tinge at the top when held to the light, otherwise pretty much black. Head is not very existent, with a ring of ochre foam around the edge. Lacing is not very prominent but good and sticky. Looks pretty nice, for all its faults.  Nose is actually very sweet, with a toasted coconut aroma being dominant, aspects of dark, syrupy grain infusion underneath, a marshmallow hint and of course a rich chocolatey character. Really, that smells like a Bounty® Bar - chocolate and coconut. Slightly tart as well as very sweet and toasted. I don't know if I like it that sweet, but otherwise immaculate.  Taste is also sweet, with again a toasted coconut flavour and some more nutty hints of pecan and walnut. Sweet chocolate comes through with a milky cocoa goodness, kind of threatens to turn tart with some prune character on the mid and a good hit of oak as well. Still just sweet. Finish is a little bit toasty, maybe very slight roasty bitterness but none of that gritty espresso I'm used to. Just sweet, roasty and yummy.  Mouthfeel is syrupy and velvety with just a little alcohol warmth on the back. This is perhaps a little sweet to be drunk all the time, but it's so outrageously tasty otherwise.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,lacqueredmouse,5,"Pours a deliciously devilish black with a really thick and dangerous dark brown filmy head of fine sticky bubbles. Looks extremely heavy and opaque in the glass. Lacing sticks like mud globs to the side of the glass, just emphasising how thick and heavy it is. Some fine cascading bead is evident around the edges when it's swirled. It's as though the head can't keep up with where the body is. Looks thick and just plain gorgeous. An absolutely phenomenal looking beer.  A quite amazing nose, very sweet but dark. Toasted coconut is dominant, with deeper notes of oak barrel, turned earth and vegemite. Such a blissful aroma, so full of dark sweetness, powerful yet beautiful. I'll say it again: phenomenal.  Incredible slick mouthfeel just nudges your palate to accept the delicious and subtle sweetness - more coconut, chocolate, bourbon vanilla and roasted nuts. It's all so dark, but gloriously leavened and sweet, leaving a rich, indulgent, and utterly ecstatic impression on your palate, verging on orgasmic. Mouthfeel is just about as good as you can get from a bottle, so slick and smooth and round. There's not a hint of the alcohol - this is just amazingly smooth, rich, velvety and subtle. Absolutely in-fucking-credible.  Holy shit, I've just drunk the best beer in the world. This is smooth, indulgent, and absolutely amazing. I have never had a beer so rich, so smooth and so consistently delicious. For one brief moment, I have tasted perfection.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,StarlightSeraph,2.94,"Big thanks to deliriumfest for this one. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet.  Appearance: Thick, black, with one finger of brown head that subsided almost immediately.  Smell: Soy sauce was the first thing that came to mind. Some oak, dark chocolate. I'm not getting as much bourbon-specific notes as I thought I would. Alcohol is definitely apparent, and I think that  Taste: Um...very odd. There's a cloying artificial sweetness mixed with soy flavors. Some bourbon in there, and some alcohol...what is this? Some oak. This is not at all what I was expecting...tastes more like soy sauce then beer. I'm a big fan of bourbon, a big fan of stouts, and I loved KBS...but this...I don't know. Incredibly strong alcohol taste. It does mellow out a little bit as it warms, and becomes more of a chocolatey-bourbony flavored drink.  Mouthfeel: Very nice and thick, and incredibly creamy.  Drinkability: The tastes mellow out after a little while and it becomes more drinkable, but I was not a fan. I was disappointed with this one. I don't think it was a bad bottle, but I will try to get my hands on one again in the future, and change if necessary. It was a chore to make my way through this bottle.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,PDXHops,3.14,"Re-review 5/13/2010. As with the original review, this is a 2008 vintage, 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours thick, murky and just about black. Sadly, there's only a slight skim of foam that disappears within a few seconds. No lacing. Looks pretty boring, but I'm sure it will get more interesting in a hurry.  Yup, things just got a lot more interesting. A healthy punch of bourbon greets the nose from a foot away. Not quite as overpowering as it was fresh, but damned near it. In the background linger sweet oak, charred wood, fresh brewed coffee, cocoa, caramel, toffee and vanilla. It takes a lot of concentration to pick them out underneath the bourbon, though.  The bourbon avalanche continues in the mouth, and there's a whole lot of sweetness, too. It does stop just shy of being a sugar bomb (my least favorite kind of beer). Behind the bourbon are cocoa powder, strong woody flavors, black strap molasses, black campfire coffee with sweet vanilla and caramel after the swallow. A pleasant sting of bitterness along with that sweetness. Just too much bourbon right now, though.  Mouthfeel is thick and quite velvety. Bourbon, dark chocolate, caramel and molasses linger into the throat after swallowing.  Overall impression: I don't think I'll crack any more of this vintage for a year or 2. Hopefully the bourbon will have calmed down a bit by then.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Birdiebeagle,4.63,"Bottle From my buddy Jeremiah Year 2008 Pours a good black with a tan head. The head is fizzy but lasting. Awesome aroma of chocolate, I mean really chocolate, licorice, bourbon, and molasses. Produces great lacing. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. Very well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden. The flavors are chocolate, spicies, with the slightest alcohol. Has a thick texture. Stick to ribs feel to it.

Black as a new moon night.  S: Big Bourbon up front. Strong alcoholic presence that moves to a very sweet finish. Slight malt notes and vanilla too.  T: First the sweet Vanilla oak notes hint, then a burnt caramel and bourbon. The alcohol warms the mouth as it goes down, no burn though. Three simple flavors make up this huge beer.  M: Huge smooth and heavy. It coats the mouth and keeps a sticks sweet residue in the mouth. After each sip passes it seems to lighten and vanish into air as if the mouth is always this sweet.  D: Slow sipper here.

The lacing is oily and sticky on the sides of the glass.  The smell is bourbon, as expected. There is some roasted malt aroma and some faint cinnamon in the background.  The taste is bourbon, cinnamon, bourbon, roasted coffee, bourbon, oak, bourbon, a little licorice and then some bourbon to finish it off. I have never had a beer with this much whiskey flavor present throughout the entire sip, wow.  The mouthfeel is thick and viscous. The booze hits your right away, but doesn't overpower the flavors of the beer. This would benefit from some time in the cellar, definitely a sipper, but an extreme beer that I am glad I tried.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Thick and dark and completely opaque. Very little carbonation and head formation. Left a slight ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  S: Smelled like exceptionally sweet soy sauce. Very robust and thick with strong alcoholic overtones that covered whatever other hints that may otherwise have been apparent.  T: Chocolate, raisins, with a strong alcoholic finish that lingers. Really couldn't taste the vanilla and oak taste described by on the bottle  M: Silky and heavily sweet flavor that coats the mouth and lingers all throughout.

1549,10672,x63x77,5,"What is left to be said. This is by far the best beer I have had to date. It is complex, thick. This is not a drink, but a drinking experience. I would suggest a nice food pairing, but I have yet to find something worthy to stand up against this masterpiece. If possible I would give it an A++.  Poured from a bottle into a nice heavy ale glass. I realize many people think this should be poured into a snifter, including the Goose Island folks, but in my mind it needed to be poured like a proper pint.  Appearance: Deep dark brown, small mocha colored head that disapates quickly leaving only a bit of lace.  Smell: Strong roasted malt, with coffee and chocolate overtones. High alcohol content gives the aroma a slight acidic bite that I would liken to a really nice Peruvian coffee. Bourbon aging leaves a nice undertone of sweet caramels and leather.  Taste: Absolutely spectacular from front to back. Great bit of sweetness from the malt, a shy concealed bitterness from the hops. The bourbon flavor resonates nicely in the after taste.  Mouth Feel: Thick, Smooth, Warming. It engulfs your whole body like the liquid metal in the matrix.  Drinkability: Personally I could drink this beer all day. At 13%, however, the day would be very short",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T- Heavy grain smoke woody flavor, the bourbon really is pronounced in this stout especially towards the end. Very very rich and heavy as hell.  M- Creamy, thick, and very rich on the palate. You will warm up a little due to the high amount of alcohol.  D- Never had anything close to this before, the rich woody bourbon flavor is a bit too much for me.... actually it blows my hat and socks right off!

1549,10672,frothyhead,4.77,"Pours a viscous, oily, deep dark black with just a hint of brown around the edges into a snifter producing only a small brown ring of head.  Nose is boozy with bourbon and packed full of dark aromas - coffee, chocolate, vanilla, candy malt, and oak with some dark fruit (raisin and pomegranate). A complex, fantastic nose.  Mouth is full bodied, silky and smooth with low carbonation. Coats the entire mouth as it swirls and goes down, with a long, stinging finish.  Taste is much like the nose, alcohol bite throughout with sugary sweetness up front, vanilla and caramel, with the bitter chocolate and coffee coming in in the middle and finishing with a slightly bitter dryness. The prickly alcohol burn lingers for a while, along with the roasted malt and vanilla. The flavors combine to give hints of peanut butter toward the back end.  Drinkability is dangerous for 13%. The alcohol is there, big and bold, but the tastes and smells are so alluring you keep coming back for more.  Overall this beer is a thing of beauty. Complex and so well balanced.

Poured a darker than night black body with a nice dark caramel colored head, with very light retention, and minimal lacing. I thought there would have been more head, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is going a be a very good and very big beer.  Intense aromas. Massive roasted malts, with extreme doses of dark caramel, sugars, vanilla bean, and of course Bourbon. It is such a powerful and potent sniffer for sure.  Taste was a massive hit! Off the wall amounts of roasted malts and showcasing Bourbon in immense glory! Bittersweet chocolate is evident, along with flavors of brown sugar, burnt caramel, and pleasant vanilla bean. The bourbon plays really well with the other flavors, and accentuates the sugars and malts.  Top notch mouthfeel. Smooth, thick, velvety, chewy, etc. The list goes on and on about the mouthfeel. Fantastic!  Drinkability is good. The alcohol presence is nice, but is still really potent. I really enjoyed this beer, but can't see myself having more than one.

I finally got the chance to visit Bourbon County; it was in New York at the veritable Gingerman; it was served at room temperature in a 13-ounce chalice - a beer drinkers' depiction of the Holy Grail.  It is pitch black with a razor thin head; there is no lacing. This is serious beer. The nose is bombarded with heavy blasts of molasses and raisin while the palate is doused with thick blanket of semi-sweet chocolate. Additionally, there is the need to contemplate the Stout's malty mouthfeel of biscuity numbness that inundates the sensory nerves. Not a beer, but an experience. One is confused as to whether this potion should be revered or feared.  Take time to enjoy the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Find a comfortable chair, call over the dog to sit at your feet (if you get bashed, it will break the fall) and relax. Of course, in my case, just sit at the bar and slowly savor.

This is an impressive looking beer!  Smells outstanding. Big bourbon notes, hell, even smells like a snifter of bourbon itself. Roasty malt as well - smells so delicious and appealing.  Tastes good - nice bourbon sting, roasty sweetness, and the finish is divine. But it is still very hot and bourbon-ey, but it's gotten better since the fresher one I had from this vintage. Gonna let a few bottles go another 2 years to see where this ends up. As it warms, the vanilla from the Bourbon and Oak starts to come out and the finish becomes even sweeter.  Mouthfeel is quite remarkable - not a chewey, milk-shakey RIS, but a good viscosity.  Drinkability suffers a touch b/c it's so strong - drinking more than one would be a task unless you're a big bourbon lover.

There is also the suggestion that this is a great cigar beer, which is appropriate considering I am pairing it with a cigar. I have no idea why Goose Island distributes this to Colorado and nothing else .. anybody know?  Appearance: As I would expect, it is super black, and very thick. Smallish head is also dark in color, fades to a bit of lacing.  Smell: Dominate aroma is definitely vanilla. Just a hint of some burnt sugar as well.  Taste: Fairly sweet, with tons of the same vanilla and burn sugar flavors. There is also a bit of coffee and chocolate, but I feel like they are over powered by the sweetness. Carbonation is very low.  Overall impression: I can't say I'm overly impressed - this has some definite burn, lots of oak and vanilla .. but the sweetness just overpowers everything else for me.

1549,10672,Florida9,4.44,"A: I've never described a beer as looking like motor oil, thinking the reference was somewhat tacky. However, I've never had a beer glug, glug, glug its way out of a bottle like, well, motor oil. This beer is black. The rim of the glass offers a slight hint of cola colored liquid, but otherwise, this is nothing but black. A thin dark tan head finds its way to the top after pouring, but doesn't stick around for very long. There is no lacing.  S: Reminds me of fresh brownies. Chocolate, vanilla, ganache and, yes, the decidedly un-brownie-like scent of a mellow bourbon. However, with all of the comments of smelling like bourbon, I decided to smell this against a glass of Rock Hill Farms bourbon and will say, while there are similarities, the chocolate presence is much more pronounced than is the bourbon.  T&M: Coats the tongue with chocolate, vanilla, and faint hint of coffee. There are notes of raisin and prune. Finishes with oak and a slight alcohol burn, though the viscosity of this beer does much to subdue the volatile alcohols. Carbonation is low, too low in my opinion, but the thick liquid does allow for a long, complex finish.  D: This beer reminds me of a PX sherry. Sweet, complex, and raisiny. The flatness of the beer and the high alcohol only goes to reinforce the connection. Drinkability is good, as long as your not too aggressive with this beer. It's a sipper for sure.

There is a lot going on in this beer, more than just booze, which I was somewhat afraid of at first. Much like the smell, there is bourbon up front in the nose, but the sweet chocolate flavor is there, and hints of vanilla and some other sweetness I can't quite put my finger on, but there is more!

Wow, the bourbon smacked me in the face and I knew right away I was going to enjoy this one. I love me some bourbon and I love me some stout. Within the bourbon scent is oak and vanilla.  The taste? Vivid. The nose is clearly bourbon and it's counterparts, but there's also a backing of chocolate and over-ripe dark fruits. It's all very intense and compliment each other well.  It's one of the thickest imperial stouts that's ever passed my lips. Chewy and creamy. There's definitely an alcoholic burn to it, but to me that was expected with the high abv and the incorporation of bourbon barrels. As a result, the finish is extremely dry and after I was done with the beer I endulged in a nice tall glass of water.  This isn't a highly drinkable beer, but who the hell cares? It's amazingly delicious and one is all you'll need because it will last a while. Take it as a sipper and enjoy it for what it is.  My timing is a little off. I imagine this as a great winter-sittin'-by-the-fire beer, which is probably when I'll have it next.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The aroma was thick, like molasses and caramel and Jim Bean mixed together. The flavor mimmicked the aroma but had a bigger punch to my pallet. IT burned on the way down like liquor.  I have to say this isn't the shittiest tasting beer I've had, but it's up there. Perhaps I should just give up on finding an imperial that I like.  If you want S T R O N G, go for this bad boy.

1549,10672,chicagobeerriot,4.32,"Reviewed Fresh:  From bottle into tulip glass. Pours ink black with a dark toffee head that rapidly dissipates to a few wisps. The smell is bourbon moderated only slightly with molasses and faint vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel is classic imperial stout: heavy, thick, minimal carbonation. Chocolate, toffee and vanilla sweetness take the lead with coffee and burnt oak providing a strong backbone. Then the bourbon takes over. At first the bourbon helps supervise the sweetness, which otherwise would run amok. But the bourbon and alcohol bitterness defintely take over by the finish. That aftertaste is the true barometer of this beer; if you don't like bourbon, this is not the beer for you. Not much will pair with this other than dark chocolate (and even that doesn't stand up too well). We're going to cellar a few four-packs and see if it mellows with age. But while I think it could use a bit of the discipline that age provides, its complexity and flavor profile deserves attention right out of the blocks.  Edit: With 2-3 years on it, GIBCS may be one of my favorite beers, period.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smell is complex and impressive--vanilla, oak, cassis, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, teriyaki sauce, and alcohol. That is the most aroma components I think I've ever encountered in one beer. Taste is a bit less complex, but substantial nonetheless--the salty teriyaki component is there, roasty coffee beans, creamy syrupy malt. Mouthfeel is very thick and juicy.

Not much lace is left, but the booze gives it some nice legs.  S-When first poured, the oak is noticeable along with some bourbon. Vanilla comes in as it begins to warm. Once it has been in the glass for 20 minutes, more bourbon is evident. It is not very roasty and not nearly as oaky as KBS.  T-Bourbon hits fast on the first sip. Vanilla and chocolate come in the middle to give this a decent level of sweetness. As I swish it around my mouth, the alcohol definitely comes out. There is some dry roasted notes on the finish, but not a ton. The oak is not very evident.  M-This one is thick and tastes like a big beer. It is very smooth and silky. Leaves a nice sticky coating on the lips.  D-This is truly a great beer that I slowly sip to enjoy all of the robust flavors. The 13% limits the drinkability, but I can easily sip on this for well over an hour.  A truly great beer that finally made its way out west.

The smell is of chocolate, some licorice and vanilla/bourbon.  The taste is of chocolate, licorice, with a vanilla sweetness from the bourbon. A pleasant bourbon character is there - strong enough to enjoy while not overpowering the delicious imp. stout character. It finishes with a woody dryness.  The feel is silky smooth. Full-bodied without being thick or too syrupy.  I would love to give ""drinkability"" a higher score, but the alcohol does show (though reasonably incorporated for the abv) on this potent sipper. This is a 2008 vintage - enjoyed very much. Would love to see how this baby turns out after aging (too bad it's not distributed around here).

1549,10672,AVDeuph,4.25,"To tell the truth, I was expecting to be overwhelmed by the bourbon taste in this brew. Although I love KBS, I had heard that this beer was hotter and more bourbon-intensive, and I haven't liked a good portion of the bourbon aged ales that I have tried. That said...  Bottle served in a Dogfish Head snifter (my first beer in this glass).  A: Black silk, thick and very creamy looking. The head was but a thin layer of brown carbonation that barely covered the entire surface area.  S: Whoa. Okay you know how every once in a while you make an olfactory connection that really has nothing to do with the actual aromas....macaroni and cheese. I can't get it out of my head. I liken it to the bourbon in the beer, but it is disconcerting. My fault though, not the beer's.  T: Actually I think this beer is really balanced. The bourbon is evident but not overwhelming like I was afraid of, and there is enough dark coffee and otherwise standard imp stout characteristics to balance out that flavor. Still tastes a little like macaroni and cheese, but I'm getting over it. For 13% I think this beer is very smooth, and the alcohol really isn't burning or overly hot at all.  M: Thick of course, with a lasting bitter finish. Tightly carbonated, nice compact bubbles that keep the beer from being to slick and oily.  D: Okay, so it's more drinkable than I expected, and I'm definitely going to finish this happily, but I think rationally (and economically) the Bourbon County Stout isn't something you're going to have two of. That said, considering the outright robustness of flavors and very high ABV, it does relatively well in the drink department.  I'm happy with this beer. I'd buy it again, though maybe not until next year. I think next to their Imperial IPA, this is the best beer Goose Island makes. If you really like the taste of bourbon in beer, you will really love it; if you're open to new experiences, you'll be pleasantly surprised; if you aren't ready for this craziness, save your money and wait for your taste buds to make some progress.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,tedsox31,4.51,"I picked up a 2008 4 pack of this to try for the second time. The first time that I tried it I was just getting into beer and did not like it. I am glad that I gave it another try a few years later. It pours completely and utterly black. There is absolutely no light let through, and it is almost syrupy. There is a small tan head that leaves a bit of lacing.  The main aroma that jumps out is that of bourbon, followed by chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of dark fruit. I don't notice much in the way of a woody aroma like I expected, perhaps that is dominated by the presence of the bourbon.  The taste is that of bourbon. At first it is not as dominant as the aroma might suggest, but as it warms the bourbon flavor becomes more and more present. Alongside the bourbon is the taste of vanilla and chocolate. This is then followed by a nice roasted flavor that I didn't really detect in the aroma. The end is smooth and sweet.  The mouthfeel is quite nice for an after-dinner beer. It is very full and coats the mouth all the way through. The presence of bourbon lingers well after I swallow. A nice warming feel from the alcohol comes through after a few sips.  This beer is not a beer to take lightly. At 13%, the alcohol is in your face and the complexity of flavors makes it something that I really think should be paired with no food other than perhaps a boozy-chocolaty dessert. It has enough flavors going on that it can stand on its own very well. It is a great beer to have and savor slowly, once in a while.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,jbphoto88,4.67,"2008 batch. BCS pours thick but not pure black. I bet if I melted the bottle down and poured it into my glass it would look like this beer. Some light peaks through and yields some garnet highlights. The head is very unimpressive as it's only a thin wisp of yellow bubbles that fade to a pencil thin collar and a spits worth floating around in the center. However I'm sure the ABV and the style make the lack of head intentional so I don't deduct that much.  Smell is just short of phenomenal. Thickly sweet with scents like bourbon, musty oak, vanilla, dried coconut, dark chocolate and coffee. Deep roasted grains punch you square in the sniffer as does a slightly boozy nose.  The taste on the other hand is phenomenal. The profile has so many distinct layers that change potency and order each sip. Deep flavors that rock your soul range from coconut and condensed milk to dark chocolate and Kentucky burbon. Vanilla bean, caramel and charred oak smoke me out in the next sip. To quote the label ""one sip has more flavor then your average case"" amen to that one.  Mouthfeel is sweetly slick and incredibly smooth. There is a slight roughness that makes the back of my throat raw but I still dig this beer. It does have slightly more booze flavors then I prefer but what do you expect from an 11 percenter.

1549,10672,KBomb,4.14,"Bourbon County Stout poured into a snifter-- it comes out thick and nearly syrupy. Close to the blackest stout I've ever seen, with just a tiny ring of dark brown on the edge. Nearly zero head, not unexpected for the style.  Aroma is a brilliant bursting bouquet of vanilla, cherry, bourbon, and roasty-toasty malt. I can't pull my nose out of the snifter, we're getting some chocolate notes now as it warms up, sweet molasses too!  Taste is very sweet, a little bit of that chocolate and fruit persists. Bourbon flavor compliments well, does not overpower the rest of the beer. Sadly, these nice flavors are getting crowded by a little charred taste and alcohol astringency. We've just barely crossed the line of roasted sweet flavors to burnt flavors.  Feel the heat, my friends, all the way down your esophagus. On this damp, spring night it doesn't feel bad at all. Super slick mouthfeel thanks to minimal carbonation.  Not overly heavy with the style in mind, we're talking about Double Stouts here.  This certainly is a good beer, but I know other brewers have managed to make big sweet bourbony beers without the defect of burnt wood flavor. Of course, that is an elite bunch.

T: The bourbon flavor grows in strength throughout, from mild at first to very strong by the end. The bourbon flavor really dominates the palate, accompanied by hints of rum, port, sweet caramel, and vanilla. But these flavors are much more subtle relative to the bourbon flavor.

Strong fumes of bourbon, vanilla, tons of roasted malt, chocolate, raisins. This beer is hot but manages to come across as soft and refined, not brash at all. Flavor is pretty spot on. Bourbon up front, plenty of vanilla and oak surrounds a full on roasted malt profile of coffee, chocolate, deep tobacco, dry smokiness, and a delicious cakey flavor. Sweet and fluffy but has a deep char and leather character as well to balance out the sweetness. Somehow the 13% ABV is kept in check and only adds more complexity to this brew. Velvet mouthfeel, full bodied but not too heavy surprisingly. Goes down the gullet all too easily for a beer this big.

Getting a decent amount of roasted dark malts. The sweetness melds nicely with bourbon. Thee i a bit of dark fruit going on in here along with . . . is that licorice? I taste a bit of licorice. Chocolate jumps out just a bit in the finish. Its a nice dark and slightly bitter chocolate going on here.  T: Really nice bourbon flavor that is absolutely there but it doesn't completely overtake this brew at all. Often times, bourbon brews can be a one trick pony, but this guy has some dynamics to it. Really nice chocolate coming through with the nice and roasted malty goodness in here. The malts have a slightly bitter and sweet thing going on here that really works. Actually getting some hops in here as well, bring a touch more bitterness in here and touch of dryness. Getting some nice wood (hehehe) and a slight touch of vanilla in here. The dark fruits are light but come out just a bit. The booziness is there but yet again it doesn't overpower. Very fuggin good.  M: Full bodied brew that has a nice, heavy and slick feel coming out here. This brew is chewy and has some nice weight to it. Alcohol heat is pretty darned good with a nice warming in the throat and belly. Has a nice warming quality to it. Carbonation is there but still allows this beer to be heavy and thick. Aftertaste is just some malts and bourbon lingering about.  D: Pretty good brew. Its got a lot going on here but it doesn't sit too heavy. It would be easy to put down a couple of these in a night and this one has gone quickly. The flavors and aromas are damned nice and this is a fine ass brew. If you can get it, I envy you. If you can't, seek it out.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Domingo,4.35,"Pretty interesting to see Goose Island sending this beer (and this beer only) to Colorado. Pours as pretty much the thickest, blackest, murkiest beer I've seen to date. Carbonation's minimal due to the potency and the oak barrels always seem to take a little away, too. On the nose, you get waves of bourbon and vanilla, but with some roasty and chocolate flavors trailing. The flavors are going crazy in this beer! Vanilla, bourbon, molasses, coconut, chocolate, sweet malts, and rum. Wow. I wouldn't guess it's 13% either. Goes down very easily at first, but once you're 1/2 way finished, the sweetness and potency catches up with you. A definite sipper for the last half of the bottle. I like this a lot, and I can only guess that splitting a bottle is ideal. Surprisingly reminds me a whole lot of the Bull & Bush's Legend of the Liquid Brain and Royal Oil beers. I'll be buying more for sure.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,sevopie,3.39,"Appearance - Umm, black. Hardly even a hint of brown on the edges. Dark brown head that disappeared really quickly.  Smell - Interesting... I get a predominantly sweet flavor over the obvious bitter ones. The first smell that jumps out is maple syrup, followed by bourbon. I then get a bet of smoke as well as some wood and a bit of rum-like alcohol in there. Finally, you get a hint of chocolate and raisins in there.  Taste - Damn... its heavy on the smoke, heavy on the bourbon, and heavy on the wood. I taste a little chocolate and coffee and a hint of fruit, and then the alcohol kicks in. Previous reviewer is right... Subtlety is not a strong suit of this one.  Mouthfeel - Very, very thick and viscous. Somewhat light on the carbonation, but it kicks in after it is in your mouth for a bit.  Drinkability - This is going to be a total sipper, and a hard sell to finish the bottle. The flavors are crazy and in your face, and the viscous nature makes it even worse.

1549,10672,DrShizzle,4.42,"Served on tap at Blind Tiger.  Wow, is this an intense, in your face beer. I'm not sure I ever used that phrase to describe a beer before, but that's what comes to mind. There is nothing subtle about it, from the nose, to the taste, to the boozy heat it leaves behind. If you like wood aged stouts, you're going to like it. If you don't, you won't.  It pours (oozes?) jet black and thick as old motor oil, little in the way of foam. The nose is all bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee and chocolate. And, alcohol. Taste is exactly what it smells like and punches you in the tastebuds the second it hits em. All the bourbon, vanilla and coffee hit fast, and then the boozy heat finishes it off. This is a sipper for sure. Probably shouldn't have had it first...Very smooth in the mouth, as you'd expect from something like this with such little carbonation.  Its definitely an ""experience"" beer. Would I drink it again? Its only a matter of time...it just wouldn't be tomorrow. Still, first rate and worth trying if you can find it. To me, the only thing it could use is some subtlety.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

You would think you were dipping your nose into a glass of bourbon whiskey. Some caramel and smoke push their way through the intense bourbon, but its primarily vanilla, oak, milk chocolate and coffee.  Dear Lord. The flavors are overwhelming. Huge bourbon/whiskey flavor, vanilla, oak, tobacco, cherries, and a solid chocolate backbone. A good amount of alcohol heat is left behind.  Full-bodied, a tad oily.. Rich and lively.

1549,10672,erikm25,4.34,"A: Bottled only thrice days away from All Hallow's Eve 2008. Very appropriate as this beer pours blacker than a Halloween night. Sludged out of the bottle and into my snifter like a viscous serpent. At first there was practically no head. Towards the end a thin slithering dark brown foam stretched around the glass until it quickly shredded its bubbly skin.  S: Strong bourbon, chocolate oak, and almond nut aromas. Smoked caramel custard coated in brown sugars. Raisins steeped in ethanol.  T: One of the most malt complex and spicy-sweet tasting imperial stouts I have tried. Pronounced roasted vanilla, chocolate candy, rye whiskey, and ripened dark fruits. Licorice and molasses with a stinging hops like finish. Rum and raspberries. Massive boubon tasting beer with a high ABV.  M: Full bodied with low carbonation. Sticks to every waking taste bud.  D: This beer is overwhelming. Not a smooth representation of the style, like others I have tried, but this is what makes it both mind and mouth numbing.

The beer is completely opaque and near black.  S: Roasted malt and a lot of sweet chocolate scent. Minimal hints of dried fruits. Definite bourbon scent and hints of aged oak as well.  T: The taste is absolutely exquisite. Hints of the aforementioned oak, along with plenty of bourbon. Some chocolate and espresso hiding in the mix. The perfect balance and extremely complex--I would give this a 5.5 if I could.  M: Quite thick and extremely chewy. It really almost feels as if there's food in my mouth. A true ""motor oil"" beer.

1549,10672,scifan,4.25,"Big thanks to sirspysco for this in a trade. Bottle on 10-11-07. Poured thick and dense with a very small dark brown head that quickly fades. I can't believe this bottle has a year of age on it I smell the bourbon as soon as I started pouring. After a few big whiffs I'm getting mostly bourbon, but there is more lurking in the background. I'm picking up hints of some nice roasty aromas as well as some dark ripe fruit aromas as well. The bourbon taste isn't as prevalent as the nose would suggest, It's definitely there but not as overpowering as I thought it would be. I'm also getting some roasted barley and some dark chocolate as well. Very nice. It kind of reminds me of Heresy a more intense but similar none the less. Good mouthfeel nice and creamy just like I like my stouts.

Head dissipates rather quickly.  S: Smells of Bourbon, which I love the smell of and also oak. Smelled smokey and maybe alittle dark chocolate.  T: Took a few sips before I got used to it. Very strong alcohol taste but after a few sips its rather delightful. Bourbon and oak make way for the true flavor of the chocolate liqueur. Before you know it, it is going down rather easy.  M: Very syrupy. I had the first beer out of the new tap so it could explain that. Pretty smooth and rather enjoyable again. Really did like it.  D: While I did enjoy it, I couldn't have several of these in a row. In fact, I probably would drink one of these and move on to a something much lighter, a dubbel maybe.

S: Vanilla, burnt chocolate, along with some bourbon.  T: Incredibly complex flavors. Layers upon layers of rich flavors. I got: vanilla, dark chocolate, smoke, bourbon, and some cherries. It's a tad on the sweet side making it a great pairing with dessert.  M: Full bodied, rich, silky smooth, with low carbonation.  D: This is the very definition of a sipper.

Smell is of rich vanilla and chocolate with slight whiskey. Taste follows through and I also notice a slight coffee tone. Beer finishes somewhat smooth, but bubbles seem a tad bit high. As the brew warmed up, it became less carbonated and even smoother.

1549,10672,mjthor,4.49,"1st review -- might as well start with a good one.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Westmalle chalice. This bottle was from an October '08 batch, so it's only aged about 6 months.  A: Very, very dark and opaque brown. Dare I say mahogany? Even with an aggressive pour, the head is almost non-existent; just a few small milk chocolate-colored bubbles forming near the glass.  S: Incredible. Tons of bourbon, chocolate, and a bit of a fruity/sugary sweetness that I can't quite put my finger on. Small hint of alcohol, but it's there -- not that that's surprising, considering the 13% ABV. Very tantalizing and complex.  T: The alcohol isn't well-hidden here, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. The bourbon again comes out in the taste -- especially at the finish. Incredibly sweet malt with hints of chocolate, it really complements the powerful bourbon flavor characteristics.  M: Absolutely coats the tongue. Very viscous. ""Syrupy"" would be a good word to describe this beer, from smell to taste to mouthfeel.  D: I would definitely have another, but not tonight. No way. This is without a doubt a sipper, and absolutely a one-and-done. Each sip lingers until you take the next. I'm about halfway through, and I might pair this with some good Swiss cheese.  Overall, this is a great beer. I've always been very impressed with Goose Island as a mid-range brewery, but this and Matilda has solidified them as, in my mind, capable of brewing very high-end stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Appears an opaque black color with about a finger of loose dark ecru foam. No lacing to speak of, but in it's place is a rich brown, syrup that coats the inside of the glass with every swirl. Smells of burnt toast that's right on the edge of being still edible, molasses, oak, tons of bourbon, and treacle. Tastes of booze soaked rich roasted coffee beans, plum pudding, raisins, bitter baking chocolate, hint of smoke and a gigantic bourbon sting in the mouth. Yep, the bourbon is still VERY much a part of this experience even after almost three years in the bottle. This could sit for at least three more.

I just loved smelling this beer. Silky smooth taste with lots of chocolate and vanilla and lots of bourbon. I love bourbon so I really enjoyed that taste. I thought it was nicely done. I wish I knew which bourbon barrels it was aged in. I found it to go great with the Davidoff Millenium Blend. A great sipping beer. Currently my favorite Double/Imperial.

My buddy actually thought this was a glass of hard alcohol when I told him to whiff it.  A gargoyle forms out of the few bubbles that remain on top of the beer. Fear not, beer, I am no evil spirit...but I am gonna drink ya.  Taste is unbelievable. Seriously, I didn't believe it at first. It took a few sips to get into this, but when I did, the payoff was huge. This beer is incredibly full bodied. All the flavors seem to be in perfect balance, and there is certainly a lot going on. Chocolate, for sure, lots of bourbon, definitely. Maybe some prune or dark, sweetened cherries, and vanilla. Very malty. Despite a noticeable alcoholic flavor in this 13% monster, the beer is amazingly smooth. Smooth at a level matched only by the Continental as portrayed by Chris Walken.  Flawless mouthfeel. Velvety smooth, as I mentioned before, with perfectly delicate carbonation. Full bodied and oily.  Drinkability? are you kidding me?

I poured this thing straight in, and nope, just small off-white bubbles. Still... motor oil black and thick.  Nose is a strong dark stout with touches of bourbon whiskey oak aging.  Taste is full bodied. Immediately hits with a strong dark chocolate. The chocolate is honestly what is at first most striking. It tastes like one of those gourmet 85% dark chocolate, almost bakers chocolate darkness. Very strong and very rich and just so.. so... so... fresh. Dark roasted espresso beans and loads dry smoky, almost ashy, smoke flavor. It smoke gives an odd sort of contrast to the chocolate. Dark boot leather. Alcohol is very present from the first sip. Very warming and a nice balance against the huge malt base. After one half the bottle (first beer of the day) I'm feeling a bit tipsy. It really hits you. This beer is a motherfucker. Hops only appear to offer to some balance to the malt base. The bourbon taste is very low key, it's there and you can taste is completely, but it's just not as in your face as you would expect a ""bourbon stout"" to be.  Worth the $22 a four pack I paid for this? I'm not, but I do know it's a damn good beer. Definitely a strong contender for best Bourbon aged Imp Stout.

S: Huge, complex aromas of licorice, vanilla, smatterings of coffee and an overwhelming bourbon nose. T: Also huge and complex. Roasted, bittersweet chocolate. Huge black licorice flavors. The bourbon and alcohol burns as it slides down ever so smoothly. Vanilla and caramel add to the already sweet flavors. I feel like I wanted a little more balance to the taste, but still enjoyable.

Sticky looking, stained the whole glass and continued to coat it with sheets of espresso colored haze all the way down.  Smells like raw brownie mix in a pan.

I proceeded to huff this thing until my buddy yelled at me to ""fucking try it already!"".  Taste is just about the greatest thing I have ever encountered. I love bourbon, let me put that out there. It is a combination of the best german chocolate cake I have ever had, with vanilla frosting, and someone added delicious bourbon to the batter. Unbelievable. Fucking incredible.

Tastes of dark richness with a boozy kick to it that clears out your nostrils. There also is a chocolate flavor in there that tastes like the darkest chocolate I've had times two. Definitely more of an earthy/woody flavor with a sweet dark fruit finish. Slightly bitter but with a sweet finish.

1549,10672,stonequarrywest,4.03,Almost black pour with no head. Smell vanilla and burnt cherries? with a tinge of bourbon. With a deep breath I can feel the bourbon in my nose. Love It. Thick chewy mouthfeel that coats the entire tongue and a little burn as it warms. A strong 13%..A definite sipper!!,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Wackyfoot,4.06,"Extremely expensive 4 pack of bottles. Pours very black but with red highlights to it, smells strongly of bourbon and dark chocolate. The flavor has some very nice chocolate and coffee notes to it and the mouthfeel is pretty creamy, but honestly this beer is far too ""hot"" for me at this stage. I set the other three bottles to cellar and very much look forward to drinking and re-rating probably around christmas of 09",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bosco7,4.57,"2008 vintage.  Pours black and no head.  Smells of caramel, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and bread pudding.  Taste is amazing. Chocolate and coffee upfront followed by caramel and toffee. Whoa man this is awesome. Finish is boozy and full of vanilla.  Thick chunky mouthfeel that doesnt get too cloying. For 13 % abv this is extremely drinkable. Probably one of the best Imperial stouts I've ever had. Highly recommended.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T: Thick and rich.. A nutty/ oak taste to it.. Dark mellow chocolate.. A real nice finish.. Bourbon is not as prevalent, but still very smooth..  M:Thick and chewy.. Slick and it coats as it goes down. Note to self, see if spoon will stand up straight in it.  D: Very good. A bit of a bite from the high ABV. Don't think I could do more than 1 in a night.

1549,10672,brow1901,4.45,"Had the BCS on tap at the Ginger Man in NYC, somehow buying a $9 glass seemed more wise than the $20 four pack. But what the hell how often do you come across this beer on tap.  A- This beer is dark as a black hole. Zero light penetration, I can feel the time and gravity getting sucked into the glass. :) It arrived in a snifter with no head at all that is to be expected tho, the tiny bubles I found were also very dark like coffee.  S- This thing stinks of burbon, that is all I really could smell. This is my first burbon barrel aged brew so I didn't know what to expect. To be honest I was a bit shocked, everytime I went for a sip I thought I was about to drink burbon.  T- Amazing complex taste, but again I was shocked by the burbon flavors. I thought it might be like an IPA where the brew reeks of hops but the taste isn't as strong or an oak aged brew, but this thing really tastes like booze. Sipping only with beer!  M- The mouth feel is thick, but it ends nicely. The thickness slides down easily and drys the mouth in the finish.  D- I lowered the score on the drinkability because it was a challenge to finish, simply because it was so strong. This beer won't sneak up on you thats for sure.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DukeofAle,4.35,"This is a truly huge beer - they don't get much bigger. Do I need to say that it's nearly black, extremely bold and powerfull? That it is quite heavy-bodied? Or that the head is thick? One of these might leave you wondering which way is up. The taste is very strong - as you'd expect - and the bourbon comes through. Like many of the best you have to work a bit for this one - it is not easily accessible. Just very, very good.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,selecter70,4.05,"Another great Fette Sau experience. Supposedly brewed directly for the restaurant (different from bottle version?...), this stout was a perfect pairing, although I'd be more inclined to call it a porter. No complaints otherwise. A dark brown-to-black pour with the tiniest head & lace of beige with ruby, a rich aroma of banana-bourbon-& chocolate excites the nostrils! Although 13%, the alcohol does not kill off flavor; smooth sweet-dark chocolate & plum brandy come to mind with vanilla & a hint of lemon-peel. Smoothly sweet, rich & chewy, this is a great dessert cordial, meant not for downing several, but enjoying one slowly, especially while your stomach smiles at dinner.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Not a black hole, but about as black as they come. Small 1 cm chocolate head. Noticing again the high ABV leaves little lacing.  S:Charred Bourbon! Tobacco, dirt, smoke, unobtrusive sweetness.  T: Emotional side: Holy big beer! Rational: Unequivocal dry and delicious bourbon aging up front that give way to a good range of flavors: Caramel, vanilla, creamy chocolate. The finish is just as awe-inspiring, full of oak chunks and tenderhearted alcohol.  M: The alcohol makes it warm, the sweet taste makes this seem like a liquid milkshake, downright creamy.

D: Weighing in at 13% abv, one GIBCS could do you in...yet, I think I could handle two...and that's saying a lot, especially after starting this session w/ one Tripel Karmeliet and one Piraat (both 33cl).

1549,10672,CarolinaCardinals,4.65,"Reviewed 3-14-2009. Picked up a 4 pack at BevMo back in late November for $19.99. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try!  Beer poured into an oversized wine glass, dark brown/black with no head to speak of. Nose is quite good with a big bourbon smell initially. As it warms more am detecting chocolate, vanilla, and toasted wood. Initial sip was bourbon. As it warms detecting chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is perfect, full and chewy, and extremely smooth. Overall drinkability is good. The abv is over the top and very present which makes this a perfect after dinner brew to sip on.  7-9-11: Sipping on a bomber bottled on 10-9-09. Bourbon notes have mellowed a smidge, alcohol still present and warming. Beer is as smooth and full as ever. The oaked bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla play together very well. This beer is still very strong and could easily go another 3-4 years. Damn, i should have grabbed a 4 pack last winter to age!  1-6-2018 - Cracking the first of four in the 2017 edition which was bottled on 15JUL2017 - 14.1%ABV. Nose is wonderful notes of vanilla and bourbon. Taste is very well blended between the moderately charred huge malt base, the vanilla, leather, and bourbon topped off by ample hopping to help keep the sweetness at bay. Mouthfeel is rich and full. Definitely in the top three for BBA stouts i have had!  1-5-2020 - Cracking my first 2019 edition. The barrel presence is more pronounced this year as it was hugely warming on my first couple or sips. All other attributes are very good as usual and an increasing the Taste score from 4.5 to 4.75 - This is probably the best BCBS i have had in about 5 years!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,beveritt,4.6,"Presentation: Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a Duvel tulip. Front label has the story behind and description of the beer. Thanks to DoctorDog for hooking me up with this.  Appearance: Pours with 1/2 finger of very dark brown, big-bubbled head. This settles very quickly, leaving just a small spot of foam above the nucleation point and a ring around the glass The beer itself is black as night, with no hints of light seeping through. Thick layer of well-compacted sediment remains in the bottle.  Smell: Strong aroma of cherry and vanilla, with hints of bourbon alcohol in the finish.  Taste: Wow, the alcohol aspects of the bourbon is not nearly as evident in the taste as it was in the smell. Not being a huge fan of hard liquor, I was actually worried that this one might be too much, but not at all. This taste like chocolate milk, creamy and slightly sweet. Flavors of oak and vanilla in the finish. High ABV is extremely well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Lower than average carbonation level, which is fitting for this beer. Mouthfeel is unbelievably thick.  Drinkability: I can't believe it took me this long to try this one; it has been in my refrigerator for several months. I guess I was a little intimidated by the 13% ABV. Now, I wish I had more. I can't imagine how great this stuff would be with a few years to mellow and blend.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,GilGarp,4.47,"After bringing a bottle home from Minnesota over Christmas, and patiently waiting to crack it open, I see it today at my local beer store. So, now is as good a time as any...  Pours into a goblet a very dark brown color that really only has a color as it's going from bottle to glass. Once in the sipping vessel, it is completely black with no head to speak of. Even a sustained swirl of the glass brings just a little brown head to the top.  Aroma is sweet and full of bourbon. There's no doubt that this beer spent a good long time in oak bourbon barrels. The oak even comes through under the heavy whiskey.  Flavor is huge and multidimensional. At first it seems like a big oak aged stout with lots of roasty malts and some oaked vanilla character. As it sits in my mouth, it slowly starts to release the bourbon. It has a bit of a smokey-sweet taste towards the middle but the finish is very much like a fine single malt. It's drying as the alcohol evaporates off the tongue. I'm left with a peat and smoke taste that is really excellent.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and as full in body as a beer can really be. The carbonation is nice and low, as it should be, with nothing getting in the way of enjoying it over several hours. It started slightly cooled but is warming nicely.  What a special beer. When I think back on what beer was to me five years ago, this seems like something from a different planet. You have to appreciate what they've done here, being a bigger brewery. Goose Island makes many good beers but it's good to see that their brewmaster still has the freedom of expression to put something like this out on the shelves.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DrewOSU,4.74,"Beer given to me by Newtonty, thanks buddy!  A: Pours espresso brown to light black, with a redish hue and tiny, small cherry head. Lacing is minimal and watery.  S: HUGE NOSE. I drank this beer at room temp and the aroma almost knocks you over. I don't know where to start on the aromas that come out of this beer! Bourbon, vanilla, cherry, sweet malts and chocolate to say the least. Everything is comes off this glass and explodes into the olfactory hues.  M/T: Full bodied feel, goes down like maple syrup on the back of the tongue and down the throat. Sting of the bourbon on the tonsils almost feels like you are taking a shot, not a drink of a beer. This beer explodes in your mouth with flavor. No dull edges. Thick, chunky, full of vanilla and bourbon. The flavors change even after swallow. Amazingly thick.  D: I had a hard time getting through ½ a 12 oz bottle I shared with a friend, because this beer was so huge. It is a complete antitheses of a session beer and that is a good thing. Its like a alcohol desert. One of the biggest beers I have ever had.

1549,10672,Beerzebub,4.37,"Thanks to Yetiman420 for trading me this.  12oz, bottled 10/28/08, poured in a big wine glass at 52 F/ 11 C.  Mainly black, but a beautiful golden brown coffee color at the rim. No head but a thin ring of froth that leaves some spotty lace. Even that goes away - no head or lace whatsoever, and then it actually looks quite good.  Smells delicious. Hot bourbon, menthol, and spice, with cedar, dark fruit, black licorice, caramel, and cocoa.  Tastes like raisins up front, then bourbon builds and builds, along with menthol, licorice, cedar, vanilla, cookie spices, caramel, dark roasted coffee beans, and chocolate syrup. The raisin flavor stays in there, getting stickier and sweeter as it entangles with the bourbon and everything. Long finish, sweet roasty bourbon, with a hot/cold minty alcohol burn that's completely welcome.  Viscous and sticky stuff. Quite easy to drink, for what it is.  Great beer, I enjoyed this.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,zminor,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into a spiegelau pint glass.  A - Pours a solid black with ZERO head. Looks smooth, elegant, classy - like a nice Jaguar.  S - Very interesting nose. A complex mix of chocolate, caramel, smoke, and bourbon. Although it subtly hints at some characteristics of other stouts, the smell is very unique.  T - Wow - Mother Cacao has truly blessed this beer. Although the dark chocolate doesnt overwhelm the palate, the theme runs throughout the taste. The result is a spectacular mix that is complex with light shades of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and malts. Well balanced.  M - Well done. Mouthfeel matches the taste perfectly, and the carbonation is just right. I can imagine sipping this in some well upholstered leather chairs smoking a fine Cuban cigar.  D - For 13%, I'd say this beer hides it very well. An excellent night cap.  I picked up a single of these after being a little sticker shocked at the 4 pack price. But after a few sip, I can say with confidence that I'll be picking up a few 4 packs. I imagine this aging wonderfully.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,alyankus,4.34,"Appearance: Small head with little to no lacing. Great deep dark brown/black color  Nose: Vanilla, coconut, chocolate, figs, dates raisins fill the nose  Palate: More of the same. The initial impression is of German chocolate cake. Very sweet and smooth. There is more of a pronounced date quality than fig on the palate. Some heat on the finish but if paired correctly (Cigars, a mousse of some sort, pudding, other desserts with high fat contents) it might not be noticed. All in all an excellent beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,charlesw,4.04,"Nice and dark and opaque. To get any kind of head out of it you REALLY have to be vigorous on the pour! Smells pretty good - alcohol and chocolate malts. Tastes of a million different things. A bit over the top on the sweetness and little to no bitterness to balance that out, but it has the great advantage of not tasting like Quick (know what I mean?). There's chocolate and dark licorice and plum brandy. And raisins. And treacle and other molasses-like things. But it's too sweet/thick in the mouth. Ah well. Knock that down and bump up the bitterness and this would be outstanding. As it is, it is really good and I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try it.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,alovesupreme,4.18,"Poured into a Portsmouth Snifter this beer is pitch black with a small dark brown head that dissipates quickly. Bourbon. Coffee, raison vanilla and alcohol. So. Much. Flavor. This beer is actually pretty sweet, with coffee and chocolate notes that then give way to the more subtle flavors such as vanilla and molasses. This beer has more bourbon character than any other beer I have yet to try including, Older Viscosity, Abyss, KBS etc. The after taste on this beer is of real maple syrup and is similar to that of the Sam Adams utopias, which is phenomenal. Syrupy and sweet. This beer coats the tongue and lingers long after. What a fantastic beer. A slow sipper in the truest sense. I have been sipping mine for 30 mins already and am only half way through the beast.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,sonicdescent,3.63,"Pours a deep black with no head and minimal highlights. Looks like a glass of used oil.  Smells of whiskey cover anything else. This may unseat Black Magick as the hottest smelling beer I have tried.  Taste thankfully is not quite as hot as the magick and actually quote complex, comparable in character to founders kbs. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee are present. Alcohol is a doozy.  Mouth is thick and near flat, as it should be. Warming sensation is present.  Overall a bit too boozy for my tastes..I'd love to try the stout before the barrel aging.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S- Lots of deep rich aromas, molasses, tobacco, dark chocolate and coffee up front. Also some nice sweetness comes through in the middle, hints of vanilla. Bourbon notes from beginning to end with a light touch of hops.  T- This is a very rich full flavored beer starting off with chocolate, brown sugar and tobacco flavors that lead into some smooth sweetness again I would say vanilla. Then there is a good bourbon kick and it drys out rapidly with a hint of hops and dry roasted bitter aftertaste. Some alcohol bite in the end.  M- Full bodied with some good smoothness initially then an alcohol and hop bite in the end. Quite enjoyable.  Overall I would have to say this is a great stout. Great aroma and flavors, the head is lacking a bit but it more then makes up for it in other areas. Yumm.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,damienblack,4.37,"Thanks to JohnTravolta21 for this bottle, 06 vintage!  Pours thick, syrupy jet black, standard RIS appearance. Cocoaey one-finger head, a bit of lacing. Smells big of bourbon barrel and booze, but in a good way, has a sweetness to it instead of a bitterness.  First thought: Holy crap, it's an expresso RIS! Huge sweetness explodes on the start with a bit of vanilla, then tempered by the booziness of the bourbon taste, with some woodiness as well. Slight bitterness through the end with some hops (about in the middle, as far as RISes go), and an absolute coffee blast at the end. The booziness and the coffee are what linger, but the booziness (aged taste) makes you shudder in a great way, not from acrid bitterness, but from how well those flavors merge with everything else going on. First and foremost though, this is a hugely sweet RIS. The sweetness never completely relents, just is tempered into the rest of the flavor. Mouthful is coating, filling, lingering in all the right ways, amazing spunk behind this beer. Pretty creamy, just rolls off the tongue. The ABV doesn't come off nearly as much as in the smell, it hides it better probably than any Impy Stout I've tried so far save Abyss. As it warms, the bourbon aspect comes out more and more, but while it gives a nice kick, i don't feel it really detracts a great deal from drinkability. I think the fact that mine is 2 years old makes this aspect stand out more than it normally would. After drinking, the lingering flavors are like from one of those flavored coffee drinks from Starbucks, except those feel overly sweet and artificial, while this feels hearty, naturally/perfectly sweet and delicious. I don't know how the fresher stuff comes off, but this aged bottle is amazing!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,drseamus,4.4,"I did a side by side of the 06, 07, and 08. This beer ages like a champ and the numerical ratings are for the 06 vintage.  A: All of them are dark black but the 06 allows a little light to get through the edges. No real head on any of them.  S: They all smell so good but the 06 is the heaviest, maltiest, and chewiest of them all. They all reek of bourbon.  T: Age does this beer wonders. The 08 is a super hot beer and even the 07 is considerably smoother. The 08 has a bunch of vanilla behind the head, the 07 features more wood, and the 06 is simply wonderful and almost creamy and slick like an oatmeal stout.  M: While the 07 and 08 are good,, the 06 steals the show. It is as smooth as a baby's ass.  D: The only hit against this beer is the slight over-sweetness. Otherwise it's great.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S: Mostly bourbon... some chocolate and vanilla.  T: Amped up bourbon flavor. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, oak and vanilla accents. Alcohol was perceptible. Slightly better than the nose which was rather one dimensional.  M: Thick, creamy. Strong, crisp finish.  D: Alcohol was a bit cloying toward the end.

1549,10672,JoeST,5,"I don't know why I put off trying this beer for so long, I only wish I had bought the whole four pack.  Anyway I poured this into my duvel glass. Pours a impressive inky black & leaves a thin dark carmel head that goes away quickly. But giving it a light quick swirl brings a very fine thin head back. The aroma is by far the best I have came across in a bourbon stout yet, I could have set with my nose in the glass all night. Very smooth bourbon, with subtle hints of vanilla, oak & well hidden alcohol. This beer drinks dangerously easy, I could sip on these all night if it wasn't for the high ABV getting me first. The flavor is so silky smooth & creamy. It tastes much like it smells as others describe. Very smooth laid back bourbon with a nice roasted malt back. Subtle hint of vanilla & very well hidden alcohol to my taste. I know a few people still say this ones a bit hot yet, but I found it to be very drinkable.

1549,10672,rayjay,4.37,"08 release purchased in CA.  Poured into my big Stone RIS goblet. Minimal head, oily slicks, coffee stained foam around the edges and no lace. Black like strong coffee. Carbonation looks low.  Great smooth and sweet bourbon nose. Bourbon just dominates. Like bourbon candy. Fumy higher alcohols, burnt fruit esters, fresh sweet vanilla creme, and carmel malt too.  Huge sticky chewy body. Sweet 120L carmel malt clings on forever, along with tons of bitter black malt and or barley and vanilla extract. Bourbon isn't quite as present as in the nose but still makes a strong impression. Some alcohol heat; relatively speaking at 13% abv the alcohol is well...not well hidden...well contrasted. Immensely complex, but not just a mere big extreme beer but also a very well made beer in general.  Carbonation is fairly low, probably 2.20. Works well with the beer. Good drinkability, but it's the kind of beer that yells at you to slow down and savor it.  Any fan of malts is certainly going to appreciate this sweet bourbon-laden sipper of a beer.

1549,10672,glid02,4.77,"Had this via route66pubs - thanks!  Pours completely black with about one-finger of light brown head. The head recedes fairly quickly into a wispy layer on top leaving very light lacing.  Smells glorious - equal parts bourbon and roasted malts with hints of woody vanilla.  Tastes similar to how it smells, though more complex. Roasted malts up front, followed shortly by bourbon and vanilla flavors. The ending brings a light smokiness and just enough alcohol burn to keep me honest.  Mouthfeel is great. A very nice thickness that's only shades away from being heavy, and soft carbonation that gently keeps things moving.  Drinkability is entirely too good for a beer with this high of an ABV - I could down a few of these without thinking twice.  Overall this beer did not disappoint - you probably won't enjoy this beer if you dislike bourbon, but even if you like bourbon the tiniest bit you will love this beer.

Bourbon nicely balanced with delicious chocolate cake, molasses, vanilla aroma.  Taste is outta control -- I've heard that aging in barrels gives things a ""ring"" around the mouth, which is exactly what's happening for me. Center of molasses, caramel, & smoke goodness surrounded by that bourbon & alcohol kick. Almost out of balance but not, making it juuust right.  Mouthfeel is thick, viscous. Leaves a nice aftertaste. Not much ""action"", going along with the low low head. Not sure if there's something up, if it lost some bubbles in the trip or what. Not that I mind.

I think there is a level with the bourbon barreling that can make for an incredible beer, others are overkill. File this in the latter.  EDIT '08 vintage poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a nearly flat motor oil black. The nose is all bourbon boozy with some vanilla notes. Taste is more of the same but adding in some espresso and bakers chocolate. Very smooth with a little bite of heat on the sides of the mouth. Looong finish.

Nice smooth bourbon flavors, vanilla, and straight caramel, perhaps slightly burnt. Secondary flavors are roasted malt, booze soaked grapes and charred wood. The feel is thick, not much is thicker than this. Soft carbonation and the body make this almost syrupy. Finishes sweet, roasted bitterness, and quite sticky. Oh yeah, the booziness likes to pop in to say 'hi' now and again. A sipper for sure, a nice night cap.

It fades fast to reveal a thick, black, and action packed surface. This is a sight.  S - Dark chocolate, coffee, clove.  T - Rich semi-sweet chocolate, very mild coffee flavor, noticeable hoppy clove.  M - The feel in my stomach is something to note. It offers a weight that's certainly recognizable.

Jet black with a coffee brown head and good retention. Noticeble legs when swirled around the glass. Huge aroma with roast, coffee, vanilla, oak, slight whisky, and alcohol. Very nice. Flavor is oh so nice - roasty notes blend with alcohol, oak, and bourbon essences. Balanced exquisitely, with all the flavors there but none overwhelming. Not always easy to do with bourbon-barrel aging. The mouthfeel is also beautiful - like pure cream.  I believe this is the best barrel-aged imperial stout I've ever had.

1549,10672,PeprSprYoFace,4.67,A 4 pack of this is kind of expensive but worth it.  Pours a motor-oil black. There is no light getting into this even when held to the light. Only a tan semilayer of head formed and no lacing down the glass.  Smell is strong on Burbon. Lots of chocolate coffee. Smells wonderful.  Taste is intense. You first taste the bitter chocolat and coffee hits you along with the carbonation then a wave of sweetness. Then you feel the alcohol burn followed by the bitterness of the hops and toasted malts. A very tasty brew.  Mouthfeel is viscous but I wist the carbonation was a little lower.  Drinkability is high only because this is so good. I wouldn't session this beer at all though.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,colts9016,4.22,"Thanks to kels for this bottle.  Poured into a pint glass at 52 degrees.  Appearance: A jet black color like burnt motor oil. There was a very dark tan head that was one finger thick. There is no clarity to the beer, this sucker is not going to allow any light through.  Nose: A rich roasted malt, charred wood, vanilla, coffee, smoke, caramel, and chocolate. The bourbon is subtle but very present in the beer. In the background of the beer is a burnt sugar character, raisins, and fruity esters.  Taste: A rich roasted malt complex, with smoke, charred wood, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, raisins, and molasses. In the back ground of the beer is fruity esters, cream, and burnt sugar.  Overall: This beer is liquid syrup, you can cut this beer with a steak knife, chewy, creamy and slightly carbonated. The finish is full and slightly bitter. Okay, I was not expecting this type of beer from Goose Island. It is super rich, super thick, and it has a lot going on in the beer. I am surprised that the alcohol is buried deep and is inconspicuous. The first impression is this beer is a definite sipper, therefore making the drink ability a little bit lower.

Delicious. Little carbonation.  Flavor is just as big as the nose, and just as delicious: huge dark malt, massive bourbon, chocolate, some coffee. Undeniably smooth drinking. Palate is thick, coats the mouth. Finishes long and smooth. Beer is definitely a slow sipper, but even with the bourbon taste, it's smoother than any bourbon.  Mouthfeel is smooth, little carbonation, very oily and viscous.  As gargantuan as this beer is, it's hard to stop drinking. So delicious you have to pull yourself away from it. Fantastic.

The bourbon fragrance is strong, so strong I am giessing which distilleries barrels were used. There are touches of chocolate and dark roasted malt scents. The taste is strong, rich and robust, with chocolate, malty sweetness, with touches coffee and dried fruit. Then the bourbon comes in to compliment it all together, it finishes with a bit of a boozy flavor at the end. The feel is thick, rich and oily, as it slides across the palate. The surprise is I am expecting a little touch of a burn from alchol, but there is none.

The aroma is strongly bourbon, but it is nicely balanced with chocolate, roasted barley, sweetness, and alcohol.  In spite of it's richness and strength, this beer's taste makes it the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. The bourbon is definitely up front, but it does not overpower the rest of the beer. There is a fairly strong chocolate taste that increases as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is almost perfect, just thick enough.

The smell hints a roasted malt and vanilla, but is overwhelmed by the bourbon. The flavor is similar to the smell with hints chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malt. The beer is overly sweet and there seems to be little bitterness to balance this. The feel of the beer is thick, and the alcohol isn't hidden whatsoever.

1549,10672,ScenicWoozy,4.82,"The beer pours with very little head. Even the laser etching on the bottom of the glass can't bring about anything but the slightest amount. What did show up quickly disappears. On the plus side, it did pour with the stout thickness I would expect.  The smell is mostly caramel, a bit toffee and backed by the obvious smell of alcohol.  At first the taste is much more of the same, but it then mellows out into the roasted flavor of coffee. All the while, there's a grape like fruitiness in the background. There is definitely booze in this beer.  The mouthfeel is much better than I expected. Even though there is a complete lack of head, carbonation is still certainly there. I was a bit worried I'd have troubles swallowing it down. Flat beer makes me pour a beer down the drain quicker than anything else. Instead, I want to swig this around a bit.  I love the complexity of this beer. Take a sip, let it sit, and then swallow. The flavor continues to change for a good minute. How many sips does it take to get to the bottom of my glass?

Appearance was jet black, very thick, looks a lot like Stone Russian Imperial Stout.  Smell was very very good. Dark chocolate, definitely bourbon, even the oak barrel s evident, but the alcohol smell is not masked. It smells like a really good port wine.  Decadent is definitely the word. Truffle chocolate, coffee, again port wine, but the alcohol taste is not masked well at all, and at times overpowers the brew. If you are feeling like a stiff drink but don't want whiskey, this is the brew of choice, gentlemen.  Mouthfeel was great - thick, creamy, smooth, everything you'd want from a stout. Tastes like dessert.  Drinkability is way down due to the alcohol. Not a session beer. More of a get drunk and write a killer poem beer, if you're the Faulkner type anyway.

Lots of roasted malts, dark chocolate, fudge, toffee, almonds, oak, vanilla, bourbon and even some light smokiness behind all this too.  Taste is powerful; very sweet, yet balanced, in my opinion. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, fudge, almonds, oak, vanilla and bourbon. Perfection. A slight warming note from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel is extremely filling.

1549,10672,biegaman,4.8,"2008 Vintage on tap at the Ginger Man in NYC.  Scorched soil and blackened branches, it appears like the ashy aftermath of a forest fire. It's an image appropriately conjured by a beer that spent one-hundred days in charred oak. It is discernibly opaque although its trim is accented with a burnt creme brulee crust. Its gingerbread brown head is gigantic even in an oversize brandy glass. Its lacing is spotty and various sized bubbles mark the surface like craters.  Ahhh the amazing scent of Bourbon County Stout! The confined intimacy of the barrel has married bitter dark cocoa, freshly pulled espresso, warm toasty biscuits, firewood, just lit cigars, dark caramel, and a combination of singed and smoked oak. I'd guess it's a ratio of two parts bourbon and one part heavy roast Imperial Stout. It is a seductive and soothing call to the senses. You will cascade under it. It is simply marvelous.  This sample is very, very fresh and I'm not sure all nuances have had enough time to evolve. Still, this is every bit an orgiastic feast as you'll find in a beer. Notes of creme brulee, vanilla custard, and chocolate truffle satisfy the most urged cravings of the decadent one could have. Along with the cigars and oak chips dipped in chocolate it stands to reason that those hints of dark caramel, roast malts, and bitter espresso will come forth even more with time.  Still young the bourbon is very forward. Bits of tobacco, toasted oak, vanilla bean and exotic eastern spices means this could probably appeal to whiskey fans as much as beer lovers. Not being overlooked, however, the connoisseurs will appreciate the plethora of hops that were used. It's hard to believe so much grassy, hop leaf presence can co-exist with the dark, rich characteristics of the beer and bourbon.  The mouthfeel is especially, incredibly, fabulously thick. It's like licking the inside of a tobacco barrel and then gnawing on the wood; I can still feel the splinters in my gums. The beer itself resounds like a dark, dark, and bitter, bitter unrefined cocoa. It has a burnt coffee bean like astringency. The charred wood is dry with a strong smokey presence. There is a good deal of alcohol warmth (it's young still remember) that heats the soul without burning the tongue.  There must have been claw marks on the inside of those barrels. This stout has absorbed so much of the bourbon character but astoundingly maintained its thick, heavy roast Imperial Stout qualities; it's a marriage not a balancing act. This is a drink designed for contemplation and reflection. It demands respect and drinks with grace and refinement. Given all the choices in the world there are few beers that I would rather savour.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bheilman,4.37,"Delicious beer unlike almost anything I've drank in the past. It has a deep dark color with a nice dark brown head that was fairly thin. The smell is very sweet with caramel and vanilla. The taste is great, like I already mentioned, thick malt presence although not in an overwhelming way, more in the taste. I also taste that vanilla and some raisins and caramel, I also taste something that's not really coffee like but some of that style of robustness is hittin my tongue. Their is enough hops to notice it, but this is definitely strong on the malt. The aftertaste is good although I do feel a little of the alcohol burning as I exhale. I'm guessing this beer is going to improve as it gets a bit warmer and I'm also excited to try this again after it ages a year or so.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A really hazy dark blood red glass that is as dark as you can get with out be completely opaque. Slight dark brown mahogany bubbles float on top that evaporate quickly into thin air. Very still.  Tons of bourbon mash, lots of vanilla, some caramel, slight cocoa, fairly sweet and creamy. The bourbon is overwhelming, hence the name. The smooth however is very warming and refined. With the bottle being aged and never having tried a fresh one, I have nothing to compare it to.  Incredibly complex even though the predominate flavor that jumps out is bourbon. Tons of caramel and toffee flavors. Incredibly smooth in swallowing, but fairly sweet and sticky mouthfeel that really rides the top and bottom of your mouth. Great roasted malts that produce a very nice texture and flavor assortment. Some cocoa and vanilla are present in the background, and are greatly overshadowed by the bourbon. Very bread-like/cracker after taste. Hints of oak are in the background as well.

1549,10672,kels,4.3,"Hesitated to pick up a pack of this at $19.99 for 4, but I couldn't resist. I just kept hearing from everybody how great it was. Reviewed on a bottle-pour into a snifter.  Appearance: Dark brown, nearly black with no head and a light tan ring of lace at the top. Beer appears thick and creamy - swirls of tan lace float atop the liquid.  Smell: Deliciously delicate bourbon-scent with creamy bittersweet chocolate and light roasted coffee.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Oh wow...goodness...it is absolutely delicious. The backdrop of the taste is an amazingly balanced creamy and bitter chocolate - a little on the syrupy side. Compliments of dark, fruity roasted coffee and sweet bourbon are both strongly present. There's even a hoppy character that comes through slightly under the alcohol. There's a distinct dryness in the palate, and it seems to come from hints of charred oak flavor from the barrels. The alcohol warms all the way into my stomach just like a good bourbon. It's amazing. So strong in the taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and fairly well carbonated and goes down easy.  Drinkability: If the ABV wasn't so strong, I'd have to have another.  Definitely worth the cost - I can't wait to age the other 3 and see what I get. I've heard of people buying these each year and drinking aged sets vertically. I might have to give that a try.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jkendrick,4.52,"Appearance: Dark brown with virtually no head on a moderately aggressive pour. There is just a light brown ring on the edge of the goblet and no lacing.  Aroma: The bourbon and oak dominate the nose. There is some vanilla and caramel in the back.  Mouthfeel: This is a thick beer. It is smooth and chewy with light carbonation.  Taste: The bourbon is strong at first and almost overwhelming. It would be overwhelming if not for the oakiness, which sets in next, and the vanilla and roasted malt which help to balance. There is a caramel taste that lingers in the finish. The strong alcohol and bourbon stings almost numbs the mouth and is very warming on this cold, snowy night.  Overall Impressions: The bourbon is almost too much at first, but it is quickly balanced and makes for a fine sipping stout. A little more spicy oak (my favorite bourbon is George T. Stagg) and better presentation with a head and lacing would catapult this beer into the upper echelon. As it stands, it is one fine adult beverage.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

This brew is almost like a shot of bourbon.  The appearance is gorgeous. It is so dark and black and came with almost, almost, a 1/16 inch head. It does this liquor-alcohol thing on the side of the glass, just like Baileys. I was playing with the brew and it leaves an alcoholic residue on the side of the glass that just slides down the side like silk. Really a beautiful brew.  The smell is nuts, crazy, absurd. It smells like the ABV is 25%, not only 13%. The smell burns your nostrils a little, but in a totally good way. You can smell caramel, liquor or just that alcohol sting, bourbon, cocoa, and a little smoked smell.  The taste is intensely strong. It tastes like a sweet bourbon. The alcohol comes through mostly, but also dark sugars, maybe some fruits and deff some caramel and cocoa. It is a little hard to drink although because you get that warm feeling all over your body. Really great on the tongue also.  The palate gets some mercy in this one. With all the usual suspects, high alcohol percentage, bourbon aged, Imperial Stout, you would think your tongue is going to be brutally raped. Not with this brew because it is as smooth as silk. It just slides down so easily it is the reason I gave it such good reviews. I enjoyed the taste but also could drink it. The mouthfeel is superb, the drinkability is not as good just because your stomach is taking the heat blasts, not a beer you could drink a sixer of.

Imagine an eight ball wrapped in tarpaper, in the bottom of a tar pit at midnight! I poured this beer from 12"" high just to see if I could make it produce a head. All I got for my efforts was ½ a finger at best and it dissipated to a thin mocha colored ring in seconds.  Smell: Heavenly. There is a LOT going on here! Licorice hits hard, followed immediately with the inevitable waft of bourbon, bittersweet chocolate, strong vanilla bean, roasted grains / coffee, dried cherries and figs.  Taste: Tasted like the smell would lead you to believe. Like dark chocolate melted into a glass of bourbon, licorice and dried cherries. This may not sound appealing, but trust me... this works! Other flavors include, bourbon (but not overpowering) molasses, and very slight coffee  Mouthfeel: Thick as thick can be. You can almost chew this big beer! Coats your mouth, in a good way. Velvety, viscous, and oily are just some of the adjectives that come to mind Carbonation is perfect for the style, which is to say barely there.  Drinkability: As delicious as it is, it would be difficult to have more than just one bottle at any one sitting. Perfect nightcap.  Overall: One of the best beers I have ever tried. This beer is fantastic, period... No disclaimer! It is nice to see some breweries pushing the envelope of beer making. No matter who you are you should try this beer at least for the experience.

I got a thin layer of dark molasses colored head atop a pitch blach fluid. Almost no light gets through this bad boy. A teensy bit can be seen at the very edges. A thin ring of lacing persists most of the way down the glass as I drink. With a slight tilt of the glass, you can see, the beer definitely ""has legs"".  I poured the glass about a foot from my nose, however, I easily had a whiff of the powerful bourbon aroma. Upon closer sniffing, I can ascertain the smell as a somewhat dry bourbon smell with hints of toasted malts, sweet molasses, and cinammon.  A sip reveals a massive palette of bourbon chocolate candy! Holy cow!! It has been a while since I last had this. By nights end I may end up raiding my stash of yesteryear GIBCS... but I digress. Man, that is a big flavor. The alcohol is very present but not overbearing. It has a nice warming quality for these cold nights. Bourbon is definitely at the forefront, but I wouldn't say the beer is unbalanced, just boozy.  Drinkability....hmmmm....Ask yourself, do you like fizzy yellow beer even in winter? If yes, this may not be for you. This beer isn't messing around.

1549,10672,CHickman,4.96,"1/25/2009-Rough brew, and I'm a big fan of stouts. Very heavy with a smokey flavor that's sweet, you can taste vanilla and bourbon. This is a beer that I would have at home to end an evening or just to sip and enjoy as it's a hearty brew. It's very strong and the bourbon aging is evident, and while I thought that this was a very tasty brew, the fact remains that it would be tough to have more than one in a single sitting.  2012 batch review, bottled on 9/26/12: pours as black as night with a small dark brown head that was full of tiny little bubbles and faded fast, leaving a little head around the edges and the head completely disappeared and then the brew looked like spent motor oil sitting is a drain pan.  Smells of rich vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and molasses initially, with oaky and burnt wood notes following and then some obvious booze from the bourbon barrels. Really sweet, with much of these similar notes in the aroma that it’s like a sweet, boozy wine that has thick coffee and a glass of bourbon mixed in. There seems to be earthy and dark fruit notes as well, but they get pulled into the tornado of booze and smoky sweetness to make anything hard to nail down in this complicated mix.  Tastes very sweet like it smells, with molasses, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, dark fruit like raisin or plum, caramel, oaky and burnt wood notes, red wine, brown sugar, tea leaf, peat moss and of course some nice booze from the bourbon barrels, which after some aging seems more like a dark rum than bourbon. Like the nose the flavor is really sweet, but surprisingly mellow considering the high ABV; the booze is like a deep red wine on steroids mixed with the after dinner espresso and a shot - delicious. The complexity and simplicity are the ying and yang which make a perfect slow sipper.  Mouthfeel is very slick and creamy across the tongue, with basically no carbonation, a very thick chewy body like a soup, and an almost extreme sweetness which manages to mellow out as it goes down allowing this to be dangerously drinkable.  Overall it was excellent, and I’ve really enjoyed this over the past few years. After having this again in 2011 & 2012, my appreciation of it grew exponentially and I love it. It is everything that an imperial beer and barrel aged experiment should be and a huge pillar of the craft beer movement.  12/31/13-shared a 4 pack on New Year's Eve and loved the 2013 batch. It had zero alcohol presence or burn and was very sweet with a lot of vanilla, caramel, oak and bourbon sweetness that was really complex and dangerously smooth and drinkable. I need to go get more while it is still available near me, it was outstanding.  Had another 2013 bottle on 6/5/14 that was bottled on 10/9/13, which had a nice dark tan 1 finger head that faded very slowly and left a layer on top. Smelled of vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, chocolate and molasses; rich, sweet and complex, it hid the ABV well and was more like a port wine or merlot. Tastes very sweet with vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit like cherry, dates or chocolate dipped strawberry, sweet rum-like flavor, chocolate, licorice, brown sugar, and molasses; there is a bitterness like burnt coffee and syrup or toffee melted in it, almost like a dark chocolate malted ball candy that was dipped in booze. Perfectly hides the alcohol and slides down too easy with very minor heat. Excellent again.  2/16/17: Had 2012 on tap at the Lark (East Northport, NY) and it was great again, proving 5 years of age does work well. It's almost 6 months since the 2016 batch was bottled so those should be ready to start indulging. I had a few 2016 when they first were released and thankfully this batch was good and as tasty as expected unlike some of the 2015 variants.  12/15/17: Had a 2017 bottle and it may have been the best yet at an early stage; no booze or ABV bite, lots of chocolate, bourbon and sweet vanilla and malty flavors. I was really impressed with my first 2017 bottle.  11/29/19: Had a 2014 bottle (15OCT14) and this 12 oz was a treat. Aged to perfection, there was no booze bite but the bourbon, vanilla and char flavors remained. 2014 was an outstanding year for BCBS.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jdklks,4.77,"Pours a spirit-thick black with shining dark amber edges and a small, thin medium brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves without a trace. smell is of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, a hint of coffee, and hazelnut. Absolutely amazing.  It's bourbon hot all the way through in the flavor, but is accompanied well by sweet dark fruits up front that soon give way to chocolate and vanilla. The finish adds a hint of coffee roastiness, which gives a sense of burnt hazelnut/walnuts. This is truly one of the best imperial stouts available. Every flavor is bursting to the extreme, and all mingle well together.  The mouthfeel is outstanding. Just the right amount of carbonation for its extreme thickness. The drinkability is fantastic for such a high abv/thick beer. Definitely one of my favorites.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,treyrab,3.92,"First off, this one needs to be buried in a cave for 50 years and given to my grandchildren. I found this to be pretty hot with bourbon. This is not a stout with some bourbon, its a bourbon with some stout.  A: Pours a sludgy black oil that yields a minute dark brown head that does not last at all. Five minutes in and there is no head at all on this one now.  S: Straight Kentucky mash up front. Not much else. If I use my imagination I may be able to note some chocolate, roast and caramel in there, but the bourbon masks everything.  T: If I were a whiskey fan I would be in heaven. But I'm not. I found the whiskey notes to be overpowering and take away from the other flavors in there. Once you swallow you can get a glimpse of chocolate and caramel but those get ass-whooped by the bourbon.  Overall, this is candy for a whiskey lover, but I found the bourbon to be a little distracting.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,PerzentRizen,4.36,"This is only the second time I have had this beer but it is absolutely amazing. I would love to try a vertical tasting of this great stout.  I poured this one into a brandy snifter. There is little to no head and there is absolutely no head retention in the back end. This beer pours black as night with very little carbonation.  The aroma is of peat, burnt caramel, and loads of bourbon, oak, cherry pie (really), and light tobacco.  The taste is shocking the first time you try it. It's like a kick in the teeth - in a good way. This beer eats other beers for breakfast. This beer makes Oaked Yeti taste like a corona light. The bottle tells you there's more taste in one sip than in a whole case of other beers and it's right. This beer actually tastes like a palate of beer. At 20 bucks a four pack it better! The first taste is of extremely sweet bourbon, burnt sugar, a numbing effect like chewing on fresh tobacco leaves, a super long finish (like 5 or 6 minutes long), and the best stout richness you could imagine.  The mouthfeel is extremely sharp and full. It seems like a blackhole because even the smallest sip feels like a german panzer just ""hopped"" on your tongue (pun intended). This beer is heavy, thick, and massive!  As for drinkability I would say that at the price and the extreme, taste, and heaviness that this beer is anything but drinkable. The only redeaming quality here is the fact that this beer amazingily great. I won't slam any part of it. You will only want one at a time, but you will savor it and probably love it. If you don't send it my way - I love this beer! Slainte!!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Magpie14,4.65,"Excited about this one, I have heard much. I hope this boy is in order and is as good as they say. I snagged this one from the Belmont Station...great effing place  A: poured viscous with creamed mahogany colored head. No head retention and lace, due to the alcohol I imagine. Oh, by the way, did I mention it is as black as night, absolute darkness. Not a gleam of light gets through this one, simply wonderful!  S: I was wondering how this would play out in the bourbon department. Sometimes the ""Bourbon Stout"" label can be a bit pretentious and tame, not this one! I was blown back by heavy raw bourbon nose, spiced vanilla, caramel, and roasted smoky grains  T: absolute monster of a beer, huge in every way. Dark semi sweet chocolate with vanilla flavors and rich buttery caramel tones drizzled over fresh coconut flakes. Barley in the mix as well, dark and deeply roasted. Also, soft smokiness pulls through in the end complimenting the roasted flavors. Another great asset is just a touch of earthiness to it. I am also picking out delicate spiced cherries rounding out the finish. It is hard to come across brews like this...a bourbon bomb of dark, rich, complex flavors  M: whew! body is lush, silky, and creamy. Sits in the mouth wonderfully and even though alcohol/bourbon flavors mingle around the palate, this guy is easily drinkable. Flavor profile intensifies as it slowly warms. Alcohol notes getting a bit wry and stronger as it sits (not a bad thing for me when it is bourbon, some might not like)  D: take it, hold it, and love it. Great beer and great sipper for anytime of the year. Could there be any better combo, bourbon and beer/stout. Ha! take a sip...feel that mild burn...oh yea! Immaculate brew!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bananaman,5,"I didn't think this day would come, or did I? I decided to order 4 bottles of this one from Systembolaget to share with my friend David. I just had to try out a bottle as I didn't have the patience to wait another week to try it out!  When poured it looks absolutley, solid, black. In the glass it leaves a small ring of foam in it's black majesty, the ring of foam is beige/brown.  The nose has lots of burned almonds, nuts, vanilla, honey, oaks, rosted malts, hops, fudge and lots of chocolate! Amazing smells, can't get much better actually!  You just drool for more after tasting a drop of this beer. Lots of chocolate, oaks, vanilla, honey, burned almonds. Almost like drinking some kind of chocolate sauce, but this is way better! The beer is quite sweet, but it's balanced by the burnt notes and the hops. Incredibly filling beer anyway!  I'm glad I'm going to have to oppurtunity to try this atleast two times more!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,digitalbullet,4.52,Appearance: This brew is black as coal. No light shines through this intense beer. Little head was formed when poured. The head that was there was tan in color.  Smell: Very sweet. Hints of vanilla and a strong bourbon character is noted.  Taste: This beer is a sipper to say the least. The malty sweetness hits your palate like a ton of bricks. You can definatly taste the bourbon in this great beer.  Mouthfeel: I would say this was least favorite part. It was slick and coated your tongue. I am not too partial on that.  Drinkability: Very good beer. Expensive however. If you buy a 4 pack (about $20) out here in Cali. I would share one with a good buddy (or drink it by yourself you greedy bastard) and cellar it for a few years. I anticipate with some aging this can be a truely exceptional beer.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,prsguitarsr4me,4.37,"Robust, yet smooth beer. The flavors are very outgoing, and maybe a bit too much. Very dark with a decent head, doesn't really stick, and I wish it did - really makes each sip feel better in the mouth. Smell is quite good - very molasses and tons of sweet bourbon, and some spice underneath. Taste is also quite good, but I feel like there is so much bourbon and molasses that it isn't quite balanced. It seems to cover up the high alcohol content (13%) a little too much - I like to have a nice alcohol bite in a big and heavy beer like this. It is still remarkably warm and soothing, and the beer definitely gets better as you drink it, so I'll give it a 4.5 there. Feel is, like the general taste, silky smooth and very warming to the palate and throat. Maybe all that bourbon I'm tasting is actually the alcohol, but in that case it is extremely well masked (not hidden. masked). The alcohol may be masked well, but you certainly feel it after the bottle is near done - this is as strong as most wines, and it is so expensive ($24 for the 4 pack) that I can't give it a really high drinkability rating, but I certainly enjoyed this beer, and I really look forward to aging it and tasting it later on. If you're looking for a beer with a super outgoing character, definitely check this out - extremely memorable and every sip is very fulfilling.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Spidey13,4.67,"2007 Vintage: pours black as well with a teeny-tiny brown head. Lots of roastiness and coffee on the nose, alogn with a bit of alcohol, bourbon, and smoke.  The taste is very nice, with lots of sweet roasty flavors. Some chocolate/caramel Rollo action also shows up. Some alcohol, vanilla, oak flavors also. The mouthfeel is very smooth with low carbonation.  Overall, this beer is way too drinkable to be 13% ABV. I'm feeling pretty good after this bottle.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,schroederm,4.23,"In a goblet:  Dark as night. Pours with a satisfying glug-glug-glug: thick as hell. Head dissipates pretty much immediately into a chocolaty ring. Little lacing. Smell and taste... BOURBON. I'm quite a fan. The nose is overwhelming, and hides several elements you'll find in the taste: molasses, vanilla, mesquite honey, and milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is quite viscous. Slightly more drinkable than its peers, but at 13% a couple beers go very far.  Overall: My review may be a little skewed. This beer is dwarfed by the Older Viscosity I had recently. I'd say it's on par or slightly better than the Founder's Kentucky... so in short, this is a fantastic beer, especially if you're a bourbon fan.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jjanega08,4.87,"A= Pours an oily black color with no head on it but you can't expect much from a beast like this. No lacing on the glass but a distinct darkness left. S= Deep bourbon notes, heavy chocolate, smooth coffee, creamy vanilla, ect. This beer actually surprised me and left me a little confused. There is sooo much to smell. Each whiff gives off a very distinctive nd very unique odor. They notes are all very easy to pick out and choose from. Wow T= Just like the nose. Amazing taste on this beer. Like it says on the label. There is more flavor in this beer that in the average case of beer. There definitely is a lot of flavor. The bourbon is there but doesn't run the show like I expected it would. M= Coats your mouth in a slick oily ooze. Finishes sooo smooth. This baby will get very very nice with some time on it. D= Wow, if I could afford this or if I could handle this all the time I would. I wish non-alcoholic beer tasted like this so I could just drink it all the time. This beer lives up to everything everyone has ever said about it. Amazing and delicious. I can't wait to have more. The new interesting things kept coming and hopefully will carry on to the next glass. This beer is an adventure.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,KarlHungus,4.82,"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a quarter inch of tan foam which recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, graham crackers (it reminds me of smores), roasted malt and booze. The taste is like the aroma times ten. There is so much chocolate, and roasted male that it is nearly overwhelming....nearly but not quite. There is some firm heat in the finish, but it really adds to the experience. The mouthfeel is extremely full bodied with a vibrant, silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, I have a true love for huge imperial stouts. Sure I couldn't drink them every day, but I love having one every other month or so. I really like how this stout isn't overpowered with hops. A hoppy stout (along with a hoppy hefe) is kind of beer I just can't stand. I could taste some hops in this beer, but they were in the background, and I'm sure will fade with age. It seems that a lot of other huge imperial stouts have coffee, or chocolate, of wood, or bourbon in them. I like that Bourbon County doesn't. It truly is a classic imperial stout, but bigger.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I found it to be a little distracting. Beneath the alcohol there was some toffee and vanilla cream. The taste wasnt terrible, the best part about this beer. A complex blend of caramel, vanilla, expresso, alcohol, and sweet chocolate syrup. Very thick mouthfeel. Perhaps the thickest, most dense beer I've ever had. Not the most drinkable beer. While I did enjoy it, I certainly did not fall in love with it. The look was off, the smell was overpowering, the taste was very intense, and it was heavy as a brick. Not to mention the ABV which will kick your butt.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,PlaywrightSam,4.5,"Had this on tap at Ginger Man at NYC, a 13oz pour in a large snifter.  I've had it in the bottle before and really liked it, but it was even better on tap. Incredibly dark, pitch black nearly, with some brown highlights. Minimal head. Smell is huge chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, with a lot of darker fruit and, of course, oak. Some earthy hops in there but pretty overwhelmed by the malt. Alcohol present. The taste is lots and lots of caramel, vanilla, oak; thick, syrupy malt, with just the right amount of carbonation. As I continued through the snifter it really opened up to raspberries, cherries, lactose, bourbon, boozey spice. Finishes with a nice layer of just slightly bitter hops. The alcohol is there, but it's nicely hidden especially considering the abv.  Will be going back to Ginger Man for this one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Mdog,4.24,"Appearance: Black, small head quickly fades out, I suppose that's pretty typical for a really high ABV beer.  Smell: Bourbon, booze, vanilla, char.  Taste: Rich vanilla sweetness, butterscotch, chocolate, alcohol burn in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Heavy and coating.  Drinkability: Have to take it slow, one is enough for a night. Plus it is really expensive so more of a special treat than a regular.  Next in the line of stouts I'm trying here in the frigid winter is the Bourbon County Stout. I used to live next to Bourbon County, Kansas and I don't recall a big distillery business there? :-)  Anyway, I liked this beer a lot. Usually even with very strong beers I drink them too fast and too cold. I let this one sit out for a while before opening and then took about 45 minutes longer than usual to drink the 12oz.

1549,10672,ThirdLap,3.87,"Poured into a Stone IRS goblet @ ~55°. Picked this one up from the Vacaville Nugget for $5. Probably my eighth GIBCS in the last three months.  This stuff pours like Aunt Jemima pancake syrup. Thick, and with no head to speak of, GIBCS doesn't leave legs, it coats the glass like polyurethane. Jesus.  Bourbon, soy, alcohol, and dark fruits are the first things that hit me. This isn't beer with a hint of bourbon, it's bourbon with a hint of beer! Not necessarily a bad thing, but surprising unless you know what you're in for! A previous glass of this prompted me to break out my bottle of Maker's Mark, something I do maybe 3x year.  Dark chocolates, vanilla, dark fruits, and molasses reveal themselves at it warms. I don't quite get the coffee or anise that others found. The heavy mollases and sweetness has me searching my vocabulary, and I find myself coming very close to using the word 'cloying' for the first time in a review.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily. Carbonation is minimal, and the finish is characterized by strong alcohol burn and a distinct coating of the mouth.  I don't think I've ever made it through more than one of these in a sitting.  I begin to realize about halfway into the glass how much I've already missed. This is a hugely complex beer. GIBCS deserves its spot on the top 100 not because it's the best of its style, but because it's one that keeps you coming back to explore further. It pushes the boundaries as to what beer is supposed to (and can) be, the kind that expands palates and helps create new styles.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

No head to speak of despite an aggressive pour with nearly 16 inches of space between bottle and glass.  S - distilled oak aged corn beverages, commonly known as bourbon, with a predominant nose of oak, smoke, tobacco, cocoa and the ever present barrel aged beer favorite, vanilla.  T - cocoa, chocolate and malt followed by a chorus of oaky bourbon goodness complete with smoke, tobacco and vanilla solos. The 13% ABV is only noticed as a burn on the back of the palate at the end and a burn down the throat as the beer oozes to the stomach.  M - amazing considering this brew's lack of head. It was creamy, thick, chewy, viscous, but at the same time smooth and velvety.  D - this beer is amazing. The alcohol really slows down the enjoyment of it (for me at least, but it's an amazing beer.)  If this beer had a head, even a 1cm head, this would be the greatest beer I've ever had and would be deserving of a perfect 5.0 rating.

1549,10672,czfreeman,4.67,"Served in a snifter at the Ginger Man in NY. Pours out a headless pitch deathly black color. Looks like a thick glass of dark goodness. First impressions are huge whiffs of burbon spiciness,cocoas,hazelnuts,chestnuts,phenlolic-nose hair burnin'tastiness, a huge malt backbone supports and smooths out all rough edges that a 13.5% stout aged in burbon barrels for a hundred days that may have incurred. This is a big, bad stout begging to be tasted... And now that I have, Wow! Burbons,smoky oaks,bitter cocoa,vanilla,that huge malt backbone catches in the throat,providing the smoothness to the burbony hotness. This is really tasty stuff. Smokes come through as warming occurs,as Im sipping it everso-slowly lest the bottom of my glass appears. Immense,yet immensely smooth and balnced. The flavor of this beer is perfect for the beast it was created as. Any ""burbon"" aged stout should be a perfect marriage of burbon spiciness with stout viscosity and smoothness. This beer is this and beyond, I haven't had all great Burbon stouts yet,such as Black OPS or Kentucky Breakfast,but I can't imagine a better flavor profile.

Very little head was able to rise off the pour, but what's there (and arises with agitation) is dark brown.  S-Immediately upon starting my pour, I sensed a bourbony essence in the room. I brought the beer to my nose to investigate further and found mounts of vanilla bean, smokiness, roasty and chocolatey malts, and nuances of bourbon barrel. As the beer warmed, I was finding more alcohol in the nose, mingling with the bourbony aromas.  T-Vanilla bean, smokey with a roasted malt and chocolate malt character. Bourbon nuances come and go with authority. Hop bitterness is there, and gosh, I think I can even decipher some hop characters here and there. Finish is vanilla and bourbon with a smooth (though, at times, borderline harsh) alcohol flavor.  M-Carbonation is very low, affording a more vinuous characteristic to this beer. To call this beer ""full-bodied"" would not do this monster justice! I had to chew this one a few times to get it down.

Thick and viscous. Smell of bourbon apparent immediately. The first sip is all bourbon. At first I am taken aback, but the complexities of the beer and the bourbon are delicious (note: I am a huge fan of bourbon).  Second sip also heavy on the bourbon, but the intensity of the bourbon subsides after warming a bit. Notes of vanilla predominate, as well as some overtones of oak from the barrel.  Mouthfeel is very creamy. Surprisingly smooth beer despite the high ABV and the intensity at first pour. Alcohol is well hidden, and the sweetness balances well with the oak.

Let's just get this strait from the start: I love bourbon.  Aroma: strong, you can smell it from a few feet away, and that is just a hint of what you get when you bring it to your face. Once up close, the distinct smell of American bourbon comes out heavy, and it supported with more subtle notes of chocolate, caramel and roasted malts. Not many beers smell better, this one is shaping up to be legendary  Appearance: black. It poured out of the bottle with a tad more viscosity than motor oil. Even when holding it up to a lamp, light can't find its way through. No head except for a tiny ring around the edge of the glass, this is what I expect a beer like this to look like.  Taste: it starts out brilliant - chocolate, sweet molasses-like malts, the bourbon of course, and a little bit of oaky vanilla. The finish is where the beer goes from great to out of this world - the bourbon flavor hits hard and warms all the way down.  Feel: its just as thick and full-bodied as I expected. Wonderful presence on the palate.  Drinkability: more drinkable than it should be. Alcohol is there, but that doesn't keep me from craving more. I think I need to drive up and get a case of this.

1549,10672,GruvisHops,4.85,"This is my first review on BA... I picked one hell of a beer to begin!  A: A text-heavy, 12 oz. brown bottle (circa 2008). Now THIS is Imperial Stout! It pours darker than a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night (man, I love Lebowski quotes!). I don't even see a hint of reddish hues on the edges of my Terrapin snifter: black, black, black! The head is the only negative, but I've learned to curb my expectations with 13% ABV brews. A very hard pour only yielded about 1/4"" of foam with no lace to speak of.  S: I've been on a huge oak-aged kick, lately (thanks New Holland/Terrapin/Harviestoun), and this beer only reinforces the addiction. The end of a deep inhale actually gives the nostrils a slight burn reminiscent of a shot of good bourbon. Vanilla is pretty apparent along with caramel and roasted malt.  T: Bourbon immediately reaches the back corners of the tongue and initiates the right kind of pucker. The malt profile comes through right away to balance the whiskey. Pretty sweet led by vanilla with roasted malt, chocolate, slight caramel, and very slight smoke notes as well. A bit of alcohol warms the chest almost immediately, but I can't justify docking the score for it.  M: The mouthfeel is wonderfully full with very slight carbonation. I could probably let one swig rest on my tongue for a whole minute without even thinking about it.  D: A reliable friend who recommended this beer said he had trouble drinking a bottle by himself. No problems here! In fact, I don't know that I've ever had that kind of struggle with any beer (except Tecate). I could get drunk off of Bourbon County Brand Stout if had more than one bottle. However, I'm sure it would bring one hell of a hangover!  Notes: If you're lucky enough to live somewhere that you can find this beer distributed (or make regular holiday trips back to the midwest to see family) hunt down this hard to find treat.

1549,10672,olmatty,4.56,"Appearance- Coffee brown low head with no retention or no lacing. Maybe a failed pour by me contributing to these findings. Thick black syrupy liquid.  Smell- Powerful tang of port wine fairly stings the nose. Roasty espresso malt riding beneath. Just the pour and smell tell you its an enormous beer.  Taste- Port wine espresso infused with dried orange peel. Alcohol warmth clears the sinuses with each sip. More wine-like than Bourbon, though this flavor is clearly from the oak bourbon barrels. Notes of tobacco and dried fruits and a whole lot more. Flavor just goes on for miles.  Mouthfeel- Thick and strong with low carbonation. Only a sip is needed or possible.  Drinkability- A cinder block of ale squeezed into a twelve ounce glass. You might want to split even twelve ounces.  Overall- On top of Bourbon aging, massive malt presence.

1549,10672,Itoclown,2.53,"Purchased at Siciliano's in Grand Rapids. Drank on the night of the BCS National Championship.  Look: Pours with no head or carbonation whatsoever... When finished pouring, a little reddish/brown head forms and quickly disappears. Smell: Very strong... Could feel it singeing my nose with the alcohol. Very complex. Taste: Has to be the thickest beer I've ever had. The first sip is the best. After that, it's all downhill. It's complex. But because of the alcohol and harshness... Nothing sticks out. Felt myself gagging the more I drank. Mouthfeel: Comfortable on the tongue and then leaves a singeing feeling on your tongue with a lot of coffee taste. Also, cakes your mouth like drinking cough syrup. Overall: OK. I am a little harsh on this review for such a highly rated beer. I had some high expectations for this beer... I was expecting something a lot smoother and easier on the palate.(This may have done me in) BUT I was wrong... It tasted like a lesser %ABV Sam Adams Utopia. BCS was waaay too overwhelming. Too heavy for my tastes. I've never had a beer that made the hair on my arms stand up until I had this beer. Finally in the end... It became a drain pour and I must say I will not try this again.

Totally opaque when held up to light.  Smell was very smoky and chocolatey. Also a definate Oak smell going on in the nose. Slight whiff of that 13% alcohol came through.  The flavors in this beer were amazing. It was smokey, with a nice coffee flavor. Also some vinous qualities. I also picked up the flavor of prunes or raisin with a hint of vanilla. Very well balanced. The alcohol is hidden well, but you know it is there by the warming sensation as you swallow it.  This beer was just creamy and velvety on the palate. It seemed to just coat my whole mouth on its way down. It was a very nice choice for a cold winter night.

The taste comes on again very salty, like smoked bluefish, with lots of molasses and some wood and leather in the middle range, giving way to a taste like dates soaked in soy sauce: all in all very complex and fascinating, but not necessarily pleasant.

The aroma does give off a slight bourbon, almost liqueur-like quality. I wanted to taste the bourbon, but all I was getting was soy sauce. A couple of friends who tried it agreed as well. It would certainly be great to cook with. Even sipping it, I just could not appreciate the ""complex"" flavors.  The mouthfeel was decent, not overwhelmingly thick or oily. Drinkability was low on the scale, even taking into account the high abv %. Couldn't taste much alcohol actually, just sweet- pungent-acidic-vinegary-soy sauce. There were mild bourbon notes to be fair. This review probably won't go over very well, but it is my honest opinion.

1549,10672,jmalex,4.61,"I guess 2 years makes a tradition. For the second straight year, I'm kicking the new year off with a bourbon-aged stout. Not a bad tradition to start, really. In honor of the outdoor hockey in Chicago today, I'm drinking a beer from the same city.  2007 vintage  APPEARANCE: Pours into my Delirium tulip a deep inky black with almost no head at all. A faint deep cocoa brown collar forms but the remainder of the beer's surface is wholly black and still.  SMELL: Bourbon certainly dominates, but it's backed up by tons of flavor and complexity. On the beer side, there's quite a bit of toffee, fig, and dark fruits along with a slightly smaller amount of dark chocolate. On the bourbon barrel side, it's fairly woody with a really nice vanilla element trying to squeak through.  TASTE: If it could even be possible, the bourbon taste is even bigger than the aroma. It fits perfectly into a nutty, extremely coffee-heavy stout. A light bass note of alcohol heat lasts all the way through with the bourbon, some chocolate, coffee, and nuttiness coming and going before finally settling on heavy coffee in the finish.  MOUTHFEEL: A thick, oily body has a decent slickness to it. Carbonation is understandably low, but might be a little too much so.  DRINKABILITY: It's astounding that this is 13% ABV because you can tell at all. Goes way to easy for a beer of this size. Phenomenal.  Wow. What a treat. There's not too many beers I can't buy here in PA, but it's absolutely a shame that this is one of them.

Upon first inky black pour, this Goose Island creation throws hints of licorice, caramel, coffee, and plenty of bourbon high notes. The more you smell this concoction, the more complex it becomes.  ""Whenever you have that caramel/licorice thing going on, you of course have molasses,"" Talkin' Bob said, sticking his nose back into the pint glass.  As the Bourbon County Stout warms, its nose completely changes. There's a mellowing of fragrances as vanilla notes move to the front, along with rumors of a particularly smoky house fire.  True to its name, this stout has a beautiful bourbon finish, again with a subtle coffee, or perhaps dark roasted malt, taste on the back of the tongue. This is definitely a sipper, as you'll want to stop and consider every drop; in short, a beer that can truly be called a work of art.

1549,10672,KeefD,4.87,"I'm seriously hoping this is named after Bourbon County, Kentucky. I have many great friends from BC, and have a few memories of it as well.  Pours a black color with virtually no head and left no lacing behind. Nice dark aroma of charred malts, burnt caramel, smoke, woodiness, light vanilla, but not much in the way of bourbon. A sip... WOW. This thing is thick and creamy. Chocolate flavors come up first, followed by light vanilla, nice but light bourbon flavor, some caramel and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy but a little powdery on the finish, warming alcohol, and almost no carbonation. Booze is certainly noticeable, but very well integrated for such a high amount. Honestly, I thought the bourbon was a little subdued, especially when compared to something like KBS. This is a very good impy stout, but it's not great. I have three more of these that have a nice rest in the cold basement for years to come. This one definitely needs to sit. Some age will do wonders for it.

The 09 I'm drinking is truly a fabulous beer. Dark chocolate covered caramel soaked in bourbon deliciousness. Roast is outstanding. Can't get enough of the thick, creamy caramel and chocolate goodness. Really love this beer and the bourbon seems a bit stronger than the 08, even with several months of age on it.

All of them poured dead black with no head, but produced a very dark tan ring upon swirling.  The aroma on all of them was initially bourbon, with caramel and vanilla notes. Behind that was a booziness that couldn't be missed. Some of them seemed to produce more roasted notes than others, specifically the 08. The strongest bourbon aroma was on the 07.  The 07 seemed to have the most syrupy-bourbon taste which was almost overpowering. The 08 was initially full of roasted malt flavor but then came in the bourbon strong with a slight alcohol burn but somewhat covered up by the big vanilla and caramel notes. The 06 was my favorite and really benefitted from the age- it was very balanced with all the roasted flavors in equilibrium with the bourbon notes. The mouthfeel was just thick enough, and for some the sweetness of the bourbon and abundance of malt may be too much, but it was just about at my threshold.  Obviously all of these were sippers but the drinkability was as good as could be expected with a 13% ABV beer.

Very thin cream on the sides. Looks like a glass of watered down molasses.  S: The '08 smells fantastic; rich, strong smells of malts, carmel, and bourbon. Hints of spices, cloves and allspice. The '06 has a more pungent alcohol scent with a much more mild smell of malts, carmels, molasses, and maple syrup.  T: The '08 burst with flavors on the first drink. First I had malt flavors. Then it hit me with carmel, bourbon, cinnamon, brown sugar, and strong coffee. Next the '06, has a very strong alcohol taste. Then you get a nice carmel coffee flavor that is rounded out with sweet sugary malts.  M: The '08 was a nice and thick full-bodied feel, wonderful. I like a nice thick stout, makes me lick my teeth after drinking! The '06 is much thicker and more full-bodied than the '08. Really makes you scrape it out of your mouth and down your throat. Fantastic!  D: The '08 is just great, really easy to drink. Could last you a long time. Perfect for Christmas / a special day when you want to savor and enjoy every sip of your beverage. Nice and relaxing after a long day with innumerable nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters, and parents! The '06 isn't as easy to drink as the '08.

Smells like extreme beer with sugary roasted candies.  T: One sip of this beer has as much flavor as an entire case of ""regular"" beer (yes, I stole that off of the bottle). Warming bourbon flavors with oak and delicious hard candies. Never cloying, with some rich breadiness to be had in it as well. The beauty of this beer is that it doesn't shy away or cover up its massive 13% ABV; it revels in it and balances it with a mixture of flavors that makes me savor each and every excellent drop.  M: Appropriately full bodied, but shies away from being too milkshakey. Low carbonation adds to my ability to truly savor every mouthfull.  D: I have been savoring this bottle for hours and every sip is just as good as the first one. It is massive, but I relish this opportunity to have a full bottle to myself.

I suppose it's less bourbony than other beers, but it is definitely dominated by the bourbon. And I don't want my beer to taste like bourbon, I want it to taste like beer.

1549,10672,wilwfu,4.72,"Boozy, Bourbony, Slick and outright fun to drink. I've been lucky enough to have this 3 years in a row now and it has never let me down. There is chocalote, roasted malts that remind me of one of mom's chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, and that unbelievable smell of bourbon.  This is one of my favorite beers and everyone should try it once. It's big, bold and fun to drink... looking forward to aging the remaining 3",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,malty,4.57,"Bottled 10-11-07. Enjoyed in my wide-mouthed, stemmed Abbaye du Val-Dieu chalice at a perfect cellar temp. of 53F.  Pours as black as night with a slim 1/4"" cappuccino colored head that diminishes to a khaki halo. Not a mere sliver of light can penetrate this opaque menace.  The nose is a bundled, balanced barrage of bourbon, vanilla, dark roasted malts, crème fresh, charred figs & cherries, molten caramel and a smidgen of alcohol burn.  The flavor that greets my pallet right out of the gate is superbly roasted dark malts and a boisterous butcher's rub by 'grandfather' bourbon and his vanilla encompassed cigar-smoking gruff entourage. As I'm offered a seat at this old man's gathering of poker and trash talking, I can't help but to be engulfed by the hearty, yet perfectly balanced smoky, charred wood and booze-soaked dark fruits. I call the first round of betting as all but one of the players fold. It's just the grandfather and me, staring, waiting to get read. Knowing I've got something great in my hand, reveling in the burnt molasses and bitter dark baker's chocolate, I go all in. Taking on more gulp of this Chicago delight, my tongue is immersed in a black blanket of malty and boozy goodness. The grandfather shows his hand and I show mine. Never play poker at the grandfather's table kids, unless you want to learn a lesson. I definitively learned mine. And it was a very fine lesson at that.  Mouthfeel is silky and oily, with a nice bitter edge and an infinitely flavorful finish. Full bodied yet somewhat gentle.  Drinkability is good. If you've got the cash and the patience to cellar a few, go for it.  Overall an exquisite bourbon barrel aged stout that will most definitely take your tongue for the ride of its life. A prime example of a style that's starting to show weaker substitutes by way of jumping on the bandwagon. Park you butt for a half hour or so and enjoy a bottle of this nocturnal nectar. Spectacular stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,davetharave,4.84,"Remarkable, one of the finest malted beverages obtainable. The aroma is of bourbon, chocolate, smoke, wood, toffee . . almost too many to count. Super dark brown and some lace on the pour. Not coal black like Irish dry stout. First taste, it was chilled but the flavors just explode . . as it warms the palette widens to areas unknown by any beverage measure, not just beer. Alcohol can be tasted and felt on the tongue, very evident strength.  A true sipping brew, you must savor each taste of this beverage. The flavor of bourbon blends nicely with the malt - again, so many flavors - coffee, sweet, chocolate, smoky complexity.  I'm lucky to have been to Goose Island several times, one of my favorite brewpubs. I had this stout there about ten years ago, served in a snifter . . to have this available in bottles now is a real treat.

1549,10672,baggio,4.35,"Bottle@home, 2007 vintage.  A: Darkbrown, almost black. It has a creamy, beige, head that leaves no trace on the glass  S: Big nose on this one consisting of vanilla, bourbon, coffee and chocolate.  T: Intense flavor of Roasted malts, Vanilla, Chocolate, Ripe fruit with a hint of licorice, spices and alcohol.  M: Liquid is very thick and carbonation is low. Very filling and huge in all aspects. This is a sipper folks!  One of the best beers i've ever tried. It has certain similarities to the beer Kaggen - Stormaktsporter by Närke Kulturbryggeri but it's not as balanced. You can't miss out on this one!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,KickInTheChalice,4.2,"Had to have two of these before I felt comfortable reviewing it.  Poured from a bottle into a goblet.  Appearance: It is amazing how thick this stout actually pours - a chocolate brown, nearly black. A dark caramel color appears around the edges of the glass, but there is no chance any light is going to make it through.  Smell: Quite a smokey smell overlaying the other aromas: chocolate, molasses, and some soft vanilla. Overpowering.  Taste: The power bourbon county stout employs is phenomenal. The smokiness is the overlying characteristic of the entire sip, but flavors abound. The chocolate my nose devoured is slightly less apparent in the taste, but strong caramel, some light coffee, and vanilla flavors are all present. The toasted malt is stronger than any other flavors for the first few seconds. Finally, the bourbon comes through, with a strong alcohol taste. The 13% ABV definitely makes itself known, and it burns a little as it slides down my throat. The strong smokey flavor ensures that I finish my sip out on a toasted, almost burnt malty note. Incredibly intense.  Mouthfeel: As thick as a milkshake, it has a creamy feel with low carbonation. This stout is so thick it actually takes a few seconds to melt in my mouth.  Drinkability: This is defniitely one to sip on. The brewers don't know of a cigar that can hold up to the bourbon county stout, and I could not pick anything, much less a cigar, that does. Everything fades in its presence...  I have not encountered a beer with such an intense flavor. I took almost 2 hours to drink the first one, and the second one was not much quicker. Impossible to session, but extremely enjoyable as a single glass. It is very difficult to rate this beer, as it is very different than other beers I have tasted. I am also curious how it will age; will the flavors become more subtle, and will the bourbon flavor blend with the other tastes? Overall a fascinating beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BeerManDan,4.48,"I've never seen any stout when poured that was so dark, almost black, with no foam what so ever and not a stich of lace. The smell of bourbon was what first came to mind. The aroma was of bourbon only for me. But, the taste was not only of a bourbon flavor, but, a hint of smoke and leather. It poured so thick, I don't ever remember any stout that thick when poured. A nice balance of different flavors. I'll let it age for awhile, about a year, then try again!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Schwarz04,3.53,"Appearance: Midnight black, impossible to see through even against a light. When poured fast creates a thick light chocolate colored head, however it dissipates quickly... Sparse lacing present.  Smell: at 13%abv quite pronounced presence of bourbon. Also a slight hint of banana is present.  Taste: At 13abv the taste of alcohol is very present bourbon and a slight hint of banana along with bitter chocolate are present.  Mouthfeel: All I get from this is a more pronounced taste of bourbon and bitterness, with a bit of a dry feeling afterward...not too pleasant in my opinion.

Next year, I will purchase another 4 pack, drink one and put the others away...and on and on the cycle will continue.  This is the art of craft brewing at its best....PERIOD.

A: Dark black with the only light making it brown coming through on the thin edges of the beer...slight coppery-dark khaki head that reduces down to just a rim, viscous, not much lacing.  S: smells of alcohol and bourbon at first, trying to find more odors i picked up slight coffee, chocolate, roasted malts  T: the alcohol and bourbon are less pronounced in the flavor, which is good...the other odors come through as flavors, which makes it taste like it's got some mocha syrup in there  M: CREAMY and VISCOUS, low carbonation...it's like drinking a bourbon-mocha syrup, which sounds horrible but it's amazing  D: VERY drinkable which comes as a huge surprise, no surprise that i'm feeling drunk after just a few sips though...alcohol is well hidden with just the perfect amount of bourbon bite while drinking, i'm loving the flavors too so I'd drink as much as I could until the booze sets in and makes me stop.

A: Still, pitch black liquid, looks very thick and slippery with trace amounts of a deep brown head. S: Incredible, overwhelming aroma that immediately greets everyone at the table. Huge bourbon notes obviously with lots of heat. If I try and get past the bourbon there is some oak notes, vanilla and ok maybe all of that is just wishful thinking, this just reeks of booze. Not necessarily a bad thing, I love just smelling this, but a little too one dimensional to be considered ""perfect"". T: No surprise, massive bourbon and boozy flavors immediately, barely resembling a ""beer"". Taking your time with sipping it, the alcohol starts to burn a little more, but more the chocolately, malty backbone comes through. This is a heavy, full bodied beer, with very little carbonation and coats the entire mouth. The finish is amazing and lingers forever with dark chocolate and bourbon flavors and a surprising hop pinch. Overall, a very impressive beer, but I'm a little disappointed in the end.

1549,10672,cvstrickland,4.69,"700th BA Review 2008 bottling  The cellar-temperature twist-off topped twelve-ounce bottle, cracked open with a threatening hiss and poured into a large tulip glass reveals an inky jet-black body with a tingle of bronze at the event horizon, trimmed with a thin ring of oily light brown foam. No real cap of bubbles dares show itself atop the drink, and the distinct gooey ring on the glass and a few freckles of lacing scattered about fail to keep the brew from looking pretty damned ominous. At its tar-hearted heart, the evil-dark stout sucks even direct sunlight into the black hole seething in my glass.  The smell is dark and chocolatey-sweet with plenty of savory, oaky, Bourbony booze. The aroma is warm, tangy and familiar, and reminds me of dark molasses cakes and fresh-baked pecan brownies drizzled with Wild Turkey and Godiva chocolate liqueur.  The taste is rich and chocolatey-sweet with the drying aromatic burn of smoky, oaky, charred-barrel aged bourbon. Powdered cocoa-style bitter dryness and a bright sweet-apple fruitiness clash headlong in a delectable melee, but upon meeting up with a bombproof juggernaut of thick dark caramel syrup, alkaline-bitter and fruity-sweet are forced to bury the hatchet and join the dark side, resulting in a tag-team tour-de-force in succulence, an undeniable dark malty richness, all wrought in the utter oaky, boozy decadence that is the hallmark of this magnificent elixir we know and love as ""Bourbon County Stout"".  The drink is silky and full-bodied with light carbonation, and is, without a shadow of a doubt, one savory little sipper. I'd heard and read so much hype about this brew I was just dying to try it, and I'm happy to report that BCS is ""all that""-- no foolin'.

The picture on beeradvocate of the Batch 1000 is a 2007 vintage. Since my beer is the 2006 vintage, I am assuming I do not have the batch 1000, but it is indicated in the story written on the label of the beer that that ""they wanted to do something special for our 1000th batch."" Oh well, here it goes, I'm reviewing it here on December 10, 2008 and it was bottled on July 3, 2006. Apparently it ages very well. One discrepancy; bottle says 11% ABV, beeradvocate says 13%. Ah well, it's strong enough!  Poured into a small snifter. A quarter inch of very dark brown head that dissipates rather quickly. Black. Minimal lacing.  Wow that is a heavy nose. Some alcohol. Heavy, heavy malts. Nicely roasted. Somewhat smokey, woodsy, and mild chocolate. Some serious stuff.  Strong flavors of smoke, roasted malts, oak, chocolate and even some coffee. Alcohol is present.  A very full body. Rather creamy. Lasting aftertaste of smoke and chocolate. Minimal carbonation.  Definitely a sipper. As indicated on the bottle, this would go great with a cigar or other strong flavors.  Not for the weak.

The smell is an amazing big black patent malty, chocolate infused, caramel thick-n-chewy, espresso seeping, gooey molasses laden, boat load of bourbon smackin', sweet syrupy aroma that reminds me of DarkLord and Bourbon BA Speedway having an exposive conflict, and then blending their ways. Honestly, the smell is insane!  The taste does not disappoint...just as intense as it smells, and then some. This brew is bigger than big and should age like a dream...for years I would imagine.

1549,10672,number1bum,4.57,"Review #500 for me, so I decided to go with something awesome. I picked up some 08 BCS in Chicago a month ago, so here goes.  Pours completely pitch black, thick as motor oil, but only produces about one finger of dark tan head even with a pretty vigorous pour. Keeps a thin, patchy lace and doesn't leave any stick, although it does regenerate some head as it's swirled and consumed.  Smell is an amazing combo of sweet chocolate and bourbon, but doesn't just end there. It's rich and sweet, with molasses and caramel in addition to the chocolate, plus some vanilla bean and roasted malt. The bourbon is bold and boozy and I love it.  As bold as the smell is, the taste is even more robust. It's just incredibly flavorful, dripping with flavor in every drop. Huge roasted malt flavor with lots of chocolate, molasses and caramel sweetness, and some coffee for good measure. And on top of all that is the bourbon, which is very strong but a beautiful complement to the sweetness. Loads of bourbon whiskey flavor, which is definitely boozy and not for the feint of heart. Some vanilla and roasty bitterness round this one out, with some oaky bourbon lingering on the palate.  The feel on this beer is incredible - thick, rich and chewy, full bodied and very smooth. Very creamy, with just a bit of chalkiness to the finish, or else it's perfection.  This is without a doubt a sipper, but an incredible one. I can't imagine anyone liking this beer who doesn't like the taste of bourbon, because it is here in a big way. Personally, I love bourbon, so I love this.

1549,10672,pmcadamis,4.9,"A - Deep blackest black blackness in a bottle with a viscosity akin to motor oil. This stuff is like black liquid sludge comming out of the bottle, and once in the tulip glass it slowly forms a big dark brown dense wall of foam. Rentention is decent (good for a high ABV beer), and lots of dark chocolate lace is left on the glass.  S - Rich double chocolate chip cookies, coconut cream pie, pina colada, black licorice, dates, prunes, and chocoalte covered raisins. This is insanely complex, and very boozy! I can smell why this is called Bourbon County...it really does have some sweet bourbon and oak notes. I could smell this all night.  T - Super sweet milk chocolate combined with the bitterness of dark chocolate. Chocolate chip cookies washed down with hot chocolate and a shot of top shelf bourbon. There are very little coffee, espresso, or burnt notes in this one contrary to most big stouts but I like that! Far too many imperial/doouble stouts attack your palate with burnt roasted coffee, but this one is far sweeter and milky-rich.  M - Massively full bodied, boozy as hell, thick, viscous, rich, and chunky with silken carbonation and a sweet/dry finish that leaves tons of sugar on your teeth. This feels like my mouth after eating some killer double chocolate chipo cookies washed down with ice cold whole milk.  D - An outstanding beer! Seriously, seriously good shit.

1549,10672,SykDoc,4.67,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. It poured a thick, dark brew with minimal head but a small lacing. Held to the light, it is completely opaque with a ruby color at the edges.  The aroma of alcohol and bourbon is quite intense initially. After a couple minutes of sniffing this fine beverage, I was able to pull out some notes of spice and fruit.  The taste was the winner for me. It starts with a strong dark/bitter chocolate and caramel. This is followed by some oak and smoke notes with a bit of malt. It leaves the pleasant taste of bourbon at the end. It is very complex and very good. Given the alcohol content, it was not an overwhelming component to the taste.  The mouthfeel was thick and minimal carbonation. It is full body and has a nice velvety feel that sits on your tongue with the bourbon flavor.  The drinkability is quite good, however the hidden alcohol and the overall thick texture keeps you from being able to drink many of these in a row. I will say this, any chance I get to purchase and save some of this, I will. Imagine what it will taste like in a couple of years, when the flavor should be even more complex. Great beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mothman,4.5,"2008 Edition  Pours a night sky black, just like the box says: a dark hole. I tried to get some head to come up on this beer, but not a lot. It is extremely thick.  Wow the smell is amazing; it literally made my mouth water. It smells similar to a chocolate covered banana, but packs a big bourbon flavor. Also, a sweet caramel, with a hint of vanilla.  First sip was a big wow. This one is definitely thick. Taste is a deep bourbon with roasted malts. The fruit also comes out and near the end there is a vanilla flavor.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. After it lingers around a while, the 13% comes out and is very overwhelming. Full bodied beer.  Overall, this was a monster. Amazing beer and well worth the $21 for the 4 pk. This beer took a while to finish. I highly recommend it to anyone.   ------------------------------  Drinking 2008 on tap 8 years later (2016)  Fudge and chocolate. Lots of figs, molasses, raisins and plums showing. Very minimal oxidization. Bourbon still showing with a lot of oak.  Full bodied. Rich, thick, and chocolaty.  Fun trying it after so many years. Still doing well.  2017 on tap Black Friday 2017  Thick and fudgy. Dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, and bourbon. Vanilla and caramel. Dark fruits. Molasses.

1549,10672,craytonic,4.62,"2008 Bottling  Appearance: Pours a deep dark black with a little amber on the edges, a swirl reveals an incredibly thick beer.  Smell: Wow. You smell the bourbon, oak, caramel, brown sugar, leather, tobacco, and vanilla when you open the bottle! Even before it is poured. Incredible. Strong, but not overpowering. 5.0  Taste: Amazing. First the bourbon, oak, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, leather, and molasses. Perhaps the tinniest bit of coconut. Only complaint is the alcohol is a tad hot (13%).  Mouthfeel: Very full moutheel, just enough carbonation, just a little creamy. An incredibly rich beer.  Drinkability: Delicious.

1549,10672,chainsawhutch,4.4,"A - Black as used motor oil, 1,000 miles over due. The head retention was quick to dissipate after good mean stirrr. The lacing on my glass was as yellow as a grandmother's fingers, after smoking Lucky Strike Non-Filters for 40 years.  S - Banana esters; spicy, rum-cocoa; and a definite, overpowering, Chuck Norris, kick to the nose , scent of alcohol.  T - a vanilla, milk-shaky, phenol (that brings all the boys to the yard) , upon approach, before it met my palate. A roasted first taste, followed by an overwhelming alcohol intensity. The tribes men agree, that the finish begins as robbery, of all of See's Candy's Toffee. Then leaves you tasting a cornucopia of coffee. Brilliant!!!!  M - Imagine: cottage cheese in yo mouf.

1549,10672,sgoodship,4.12,"The weather in Chicago today was horribly cold. I have the start of a cold and wanted a beer that could mend me and warm me. BCS seemed like the best candidate. My friend Brian kindly donated this 2008 bottle for me to review - thanks buddy!  A: Poured into an oversized wine glass. It's a stubborn old bird - doesn't want to deliver a head. Gave me a brief beautiful espresso dusting and then dissipated quickly to a thin ring. Very dark red brown - almost black with nice ruby highlights against the light. Some spotty lacing that doesn't last.  S: The bourbon is strong and with the combination of the dark fruit, it's almost like a smokey, spicy red wine-like nose. There is an underlying vanilla malty sweetness but you have to go looking for it.  T: What a surprise! My initial experience was the most lovely caramel espresso. After that, the following sips delivered the alcohol. I could feel the vapor before my lips touched the liquid. As the brew warmed, I started getting some really nice big smokey, sweet malt with a nice sharp alcohol calling card on the back of the throat. Toward the end of the drink, I felt like the vanilla was speaking to me. It seems like every time I took a break, let it warm up and came back to it, the profile changed slightly on me. You can definitely pick out all the key ingredients but they play out very differently as the drink progresses. It felt rich and complex - a special treat.  M: It is a surprisingly medium/light body with low carbonation which seems to suit it. It is pretty smooth apart from some of the deliberate alcohol sting on the lips and palette.  D: Even though I only drink this type of beer on occasion and don't go out of my way for big alcohol taste in beer, it was very drinkable. I finished it much quicker than I expected and that is always a good sign. I could easily have had a couple more although it is deceptively potent. A fine brew for Goose Island to celebrate their 1000th batch.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,coldmeat23,4.82,"GLASS: Over-sized Wine Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees 2008 Vintage (10/21/08)  Thick, black, and oily liquid. Disappointingly though, there is no head to speak of, even with a hard pour. No real lacing, either. I swirled it to check it's 'legs' though. Hell, it's wearing a skirt! Most impressive.  Smell is over-the-top boozey. Bourbon notes are ever-so present. Smokey oak and hints of sweet vanilla. Hints of chocolate. Big overripe dark fruits.  This reminds me of fresh S.A. Triple Bock. Wow. Bourbon warmth comes through prominently. Syrupy dark fruit flavors. Chocolate notes mingle with big vanilla flavor. Big malty backbone. Smokey oak flavor. Caramelized brown sugar. F***ing complex flavor pallette! For all of the bourbon-like warmth that is here, combined with the 13% ABV, I find the alcohol to be remarkably well hidden.  Mouthfeel is phenomenal! For as big as this beer is, this is one smooth easy drinking bastard. Big, thick, chewey and oily, yet smooth and light on the tongue, at the same time. Amazing.  I would like to drink these, one after the other, over an evening. When the alcohol eventually knocks me out, I'd like to wake up and continue on doing the same thing...for like a week. Damn, it's good. This was so totally worth the wait and the effort. Worthy of seeking out.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Cresant,4.43,"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a Duvel glass. 2006 vintage. Label says 11% ABV, not 13% listed here. A hard pour created only 1 finger of dark tan head. The body was opaque black/brown. This one had legs when swirled! Served around 50 F.  Smell was chocolate and vanilla. Some minor alcohol as it warmed.  Taste was espresso. Wood/oak. Rich and increasingly chocolatey as it warmed. Sweet but not cloying. Coffee-like bitterness gave it some counterbalance. Not much bourbon flavor, more woodiness and richness rather than booze flavors. Very nice.  Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety. Minimal carbonation. Dense, milky almost. Very drinkable.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,barleywinefiend,4.2,"Poured a jet black with a dirty white head. Nose was heavy bourbon as was the taste. I did not notice much other than bourbon on this brew. It was good but expected a more robust flavor. The ABV was very well masked. Burbon dominance. A good brew but I actually wanted more vanilla, oak, cocoa and everything else. Maybe I missed somethng. It takes more than bourbon to make a grwat beer these days.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bubslang,4.9,"2008 Version: Poured a deep dark brown with a small brown head with nice lacing. Aroma is incredible combinatio of rich dark malts, caramel, oak, and bourbon, which you can seemingly can smell from miles away. Flavor is equally impressive, caramel malts,vanilla, a little bit of dark fruit, smoke all with a hint of bourbon. but the bourbon is not overpowering though, just complimentary. Full mouthfeel that leads to a nice warming finish. A top notch beer",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SaucyA,4.44,"2008.  A - Pours black with no head. A brown ring of teeeny tiny bubbles encircles the snifter. Cabernet edges on the top, but completely opaque body. No lacing.  S - Beautiful bourbon. Wood, butterscotch, vanilla, chocolate, alcohol. Brilliant.  T - Huge. Chocolate, bourbon goodness, boozy, warm, wonderful. Finishes sweet then slowly transforms into bitter dryness on the palate. The alcohol is rather balanced on the back end as well. Vanilla, oak tanins, slight caramel. Quite a dessert beer.  M - Rather thick. Rather viscous. Coating, with a fine, smooth carbonation.  D - Y'know, for being so big, it's incredibly drinkable. Definitely not a chore.  Notes: I had a bottle from last years batch when it came out and hated it. Decided to revisit it a year later and lo and behold: This shit is fantastic!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,wryepicures,3.45,"Had this on-tap from Alchemy cafe, served in a large wineglass/goblet.  Poured very dark ruby/black. Little head to speak of.  Smell: heady wine, alcohol, sugar, vanilla. Strong, sweet, wonderful smell coming off this.  Taste: burnt sugar, malt, oak/wood, wine, slight bourbon hint when you breathe out after a taste. I didn't want open flame near my breath after this one.  Very heady and heavy mouthfeel, but the tastes were less upfront than the smell. I didn't feel this was very drinkable, too heavy alcohol, too much and this coming from someone who loves dark beers and barleywines. Expected more from the high price, and actually I'd suggest pouring smaller since its so potent tasting.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ccrida,4.55,"12 oz bottle (10/08), Bourbon County Stout is a pitch black brown with a tan head that fades to a thick collar and leaves light, scattered lace.  Smell is dense, vanilla, caramel, walnuts, with dry alcohol vapors.  Taste is fantastic, super rich flavor. Vanilla out the wah-zoo, a big sweet stout, loads of caramel, coffee, not to much bourbon, or even booze...there's just so much flavor that any heat from it's young age and extreme ABV is vanquished. This is maybe the best example of barrel aging I've ever had, my first full bottle but I've had a few tastes before.  Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth and actually not that thick for such a big beer.  Drinkability is dangerously high. This is actually a fantastic breakfast beer - and a night-cap!

1549,10672,CoalCellar,4.15,"Poured from a bottle into a wide mouthed goblet....  A: This is jet black stuff, pour develops a thin dark/brown head that settles into a few tiny bubbles like small bubbles on the surface of a tar pit.... S: BOURBON AND OAK. There can be no doubts about whats coming, this one smells boozy... T: Immediate oak and bourbon flavors up front, vanilla, caramel, distant chocolate, but finishes with a strong alcohol burn. M: Thick and chewy D: The massive flavors make this one a sipper, but unfortunately, due to the liqour like alcohol burn, this one isn't very drinkable....yet..

1549,10672,JoeMayo,3.77,"2007 Vintage  A- Pours pitch black with almost no head. Very viscous  S- Tons of vanilla and bourbon. Dark malt and a little alcohol on the nose as well.  T- After taking each sip, I was immediately impressed and then just as quickly, thoroughly disappointed. It was a weird sensation with every sip. Vanilla, bourbon, dark malt, caramel, and a slight smokiness hit my palate very quickly, but these flavors were immediately followed by very hot alcohol, resembling gin more than bourbon. It completely ruined the complexity of the beer. This beer was one year old, but I think needs at least another year or two.  M- Thick and syrupy, although hot with alcohol.  D- Smooth, but the hotness makes it a little harder to drink",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Aroma is rich caramel and dark chocolate, burnt candied walnuts, and a slight hint of E. L. Weller's bourbon reserve... mmm....  Taste is chocolate covered raisins, liquid smoke, like 80% dark chocolate cocoa mass... delicious.  Mouthfeel is robust, rich and complex.  Well... let's be honest- this an ultra-concentrated beer.

1549,10672,daledeee,4.7,"Something new and it's winter. Stouts have been tasting good lately.  I have called beers completely opaque before but this one is truly black. Especially after the dark brown one finger head goes away to a thin ring of bubbles around the glass. I can see reflections of items nearby on top of the beer!  The nose is as the name states. Oak, charred at that, alcohol and some vanilla. No coffee or chocolate as with other stouts.  The taste is sweet, thick, warming, caramel and the bourbon barrels leave their own signature. Very little carbonation and pretty drinkable. This is definitely a distinctive stout that is quite acceptable.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Nose is thick vanilla bourbon, with heavy malts and oak alcohol. First sip is burnt charred oak chips, with molasses and dense caramel. More alcohol on warming, and some brown sugar sweetness.

S- LIQUOR! This is the closest a beer has come to smelling like strait up bourbon *in my experience*. packed with loads of complex intricate layers that include rum-cherry, licorice, vanilla bean, and a DANK alcoholic rise.

No head, no lace, black, black, black coat the glass. I'm almost expecting wine-like legs but pure thick coating when swirled.  Taste is so complex. Obviously I need to touch on the warming alcohol at 13% is expected but all of the subtleties that you don't get in other big beer are here. It's like all my favorate flavors from BW's, DB's, and IS's are all present with none of the ""hot,turn me off"" nastiness. I've had big strong beers that start good and finish just hot and unsatisfying, but this beer leaves you wanting another sip, every time.

1549,10672,ElGordo,4.44,"2008 vintage, poured from the 12oz bottle into a snifter. Body is a deep murky brown, with just the faintest wisp of a dark tan head that immediately fades into obscurity. Highly complex aroma yields notes of sweet raisin, bourbon, chocolate, and molasses - a wonderful combination. Palate is sweet up front, with hints of light lactose sugar and raisin. After the swallow the sweetness is overtaken by the strong bourbon character. Rich dark fruit comes through on the finish, with notes of prune along with the sweet molasses and vanilla bean. Body is full and robust, but not overly heavy or oily like some imperial stouts. A light stickiness coats the tongue and helps to move the warming alcohol down the back of the throat. This is a true pleasure to drink, although the strength and heaviness make it a special occasion brew. Still, this is an excellent addition to the local beer selection, and I look forward to seeing more Goose Island beers here in the near future.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,josiahschlender,4.64,"Picked this up out of curiosity at the grocery store, then was surprised to see it was in the upper half of the BA top 100! Drank very fresh, bottled date of 10/21/08.  Plain label belies the complex, huge beast of a beer inside. Very viscous pour into my wine glass. Color is the darkest brown possible, with almost zero head, the few bubbles fade almost immediately.  Immediately upon opening the bottle, strong aromas escape. (one of the very few beers I've had smell that strong before even pouring it) Once poured, intense bourbon, coconut, dark chocolate and charred malts mix with hints of smoke, oak, and caramel/raw sugar sweetness. One of the biggest smelling beers I've come across yet.  Flavors are equally intense. Huge bourbon, coconut, charred malt, chocolate, caramel sweetness and alcohol. Delicious! A previous reviewer hit the nail on the head, describing it as a ""chocolate coconut cake dripping with bourbon.""  Feel is very smooth despite the 13% ABV. Surprisingly not very hot, but the alcohol is still very present and warming on the back of my throat. Very long, complex finish and decent bittering that sneaks in at the end.  Definitely a sipping beer. This reminds me of eating a decadent chocolate cake that's almost too rich, yet at the same time I wouldn't trade it for anything less. A fabulous, inventive beer.

A tiny little mocha-colored head forms, then disappears rapidly. Deep garnet highlights around the edges of the glass.  Aroma is mainly bourbon, with some dark roasted malts in the background. Faint chocolate smell. Some sweet, dark pitted fruits.  The beer is smooth and thick. The first bottle was even a little dry. Some alcohol heat.  Flavor is primarily bourbon. Sweet, with dark grape overtones. Roasted nuts, a touch of smoke. Some dates. Malt profile is forward, but not obnoxious. Some chocolate can be discerned. Alcohol warming on swallow. I'm going to have to say this is damned near a perfect tasting beer.  Only halfway into a 12 ounce bottle, I was feeling this one! Whoo! Delicious but huge at 13% ABV, there's a damn good reason this comes in only a four pack of twelve ouncers! This one is not a session closer, it is the ENTIRE session for me when I can get it.  Drinking the same beer five months apart didn't reveal any appreciable differences, save for a slight reduction in alcohol (from burning to warming) and the pitted fruit flavors coming forward.

1549,10672,ahking,4.19,"If you buy this beer, you probably know what you are getting into, but if not, watch out! Intense and enjoyable brew from a decent brewery.  Pours dark as midnight and coats the glass like motor oil. Didn't notice a head on my pour but a sickly tan ring parades around the circumference.  Aroma is out of this world. Hot bourbon mixed with honey, roasted black malts, caramel, and a trace of noble hops.  Flavor is quite nice. Very hot, dark dried cherries, cola, licorice, vanilla, and cocoa bite your tongue like a viper. Mild bitterness from a hop addition.  This baby is thick as syrup, burns your mouth and very smooth going down. I like it quite a bit, but I don't see drinking more than one in a sitting.

1549,10672,jakon,4.87,"12oz bottle, case dated 10-21-08.  This beer pours a very thick pitch black with a smallish head.  The aroma is gigantic. This is probably the strongest overall aroma I've encountered in a beer. Big time coconut chocolate cake liberally soaked in bourbon.  The taste is very sweet. That coconut aroma comes through big in the flavor, as does the huge malt bill. Maple syrup, vanilla, sweetened chocolate, rum, and star anise are very perceptible. Can't taste a hint of hops through all this. This beer must contain at least 4000 calories per serving. Damn near cloying sweetness, as though the yeast died early in a futile battle trying to eat up all that sugar. The bourbon is needed here, and almost resembles rum more so than itself.  Very low carbonation. Thick and syrupy.  If I had to choose a single word to describe this beer, it'd surely be DECADENT. Just ridiculously over the top with the flavors and aromas. This beer is dessert and breakfast in one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DoubleJ,4.71,"Hooray! This beer has made itself out to Southern California! Freshly bought with a bottled on date of 10/21/08. On to the beer:  Major bourbon aroma escapes from this bottle as I open it, but lemme pour it into a snifter. There's no head to this super dark, rich bodied beer. Aroma...very complex here. Bourbon, vanilla, nuts, maple, pine, molasses, raw sugarcane. Unless you're a newbie to alcoholic drinks, how can you not like the aroma? I hesitate to taste.  That...was...delicious!  Before I go on, let me warn you it's very boozy. With that in mind, this is downright fun to taste. Big bourbon barrel flavor upfront. It comes oak. Vanilla, raw sugarcane, chocolate covered cherries. The alcohol is charred and very warming down my throat. Needless to say, this beer is thick in the mouth with just a small fiz of carbonation.  Well...it was good, but some loose ends were green, otherwise the taste would get a perfect 5.0. I'll lay down the rest of my bottles in my 4-pack and compare in the future, but for now, this is a beer worthy of the hype.  (Revisited 3/4/09) - Snap, crackle, and POP!

1549,10672,katan,3.68,"12 oz bottle, 2008 batch - poured into a goblet  A - This thing pours as dark as night. No light is getting through this one. The head is a very light film that had the trademark light mocha/chocolate color. Carbonation is not obvious.  S - Has an edgy sweetness to the nose. A combination of harsh dark chocolate and molasses. Very sweet. Sugary on the nose. There is some bourbon bite hiding in the background.  T - Starts off super sweet with lots of malt flavors. Mid-stream brings in some coffee edge. Finishes with a large swath of chocolate and bourbon flavors. Aftertaste has a combination of bitterness, chocolate, and molasses.  M - Thick as syrup. Coats the tongue like you would not believe. Not much for carbonation here, but that fits the style. Leaves a heavy aftertaste which I have to say is not all that pleasant.  D - This is a ""head remover"" beer for me - as its taste doesn't necessarily reflect the 13% of alcohol in here. Beyond the fact that you have to be pacing yourself, its very warming and filling, which would also make this beer a sipper. One a night is enough.  This beer can certainly do with some aging. I think the flavors from the bourbon need to mellow more. Going to put some back for a few years and see what happens. Which begs one question: if the twist off caps have inferior oxidation problems, why did they use it on such a cellarable beer?",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Goliath,4.54,"Pours black and completely opaque through the center, but with some thin amber hued edges in the light. A thin chocolate colored head sits on top and quickly dissipates leaving nothing behind.  The aroma is awesome. Huge notes of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, and a touch of smoke. Really enticing. A bit boozy at times though.  The taste on this beer is phenomenal. Again, big notes of bourbon really set the beer off. Huge notes of chocolate, coffee, toasted coconut, oak, vanilla, and even a touch of smoke. I'm so happy this finally hit shelves here because I forgot how much I love this beer! It finishes off with a nice alcohol warmth in the chest, but the booziness is really relaxed as you sip.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, and slightly creamy. Carbonation is very low, producing more of a still mouthfeel and it's really appropriate.  Drinkability is remarkably high for a beer of this stature. The alcohol us mellowed enough to easily be enjoyed. Although, good luck taking more than one in a sitting.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,GClarkage,4.94,"11/19/08- Purcahsed at Total Wine in Lincoln, CA. $18.99 4-pack price tag.  Presentation- 12oz bottle, 2008 annual release. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- About the thickest pour I have seen from a beer. Pitch black in color. About a 1/2 inch head on first pour...quickly evaporates soon after. Leaves behind some spotty watery lace markings.  Smell- Huge nose of bittersweet chocolate, mild fresh coffee, lots of bourbon, a bit of woody barrel notes and even some dark fruits...all paired nicely with super roasted malt which almost has a light salty nose to it.  Taste- Again, lots of stuff going on. It's mostly nice sweet highly roasted chocolate malt with a shot of bourbon on the side. Almost...key word is ""almost"" too much bourbon. Really pushes the limit, but just barely doesn't cross the line. Light coffee notes and some dates and figs mingling about. Hops are here, and mildly bitter. Intense.  Mouthfeel- Very thick, very viscous. Not quite the motor oil everone talks about...but still probably the thickest beer I have tried. Considerably creamy and smmoth with a lower end carbonation. Aftertaste of candied bourbon-chocolate and a very light bitter hops bite. Definite full mouthfeel.  Drinkability- Still haven't found my perfect 5 beer. I've seen about a handful of really strong stouts that have looked a bit better. But this is about as close as it gets. I'm glad I have a few 4-packs...I may even try to grab another couple....definitely worth $5 a bottle. A must try if seen...or be regretful the rest of your life.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,paytoplay,4.87,"Amazing nose, complexity and an endless finish. Would be syrup if the alc wasn't 13%. 2008 Bottle. Not sure why you'd want to age this brew as it drank so nicely right now. Though I have a couple vintages back from a trade so I'll see what all the hooplah is when I sample those. Dark and milk chocolate with rasberries and blue fruit. Silky texture. Vanilla and oak with some faint spice. Only a tiny bit is needed as so much flavor unfolds on the palate. $20 for a 4 pack of 12oz seems expensive but after this I say this is cheap for how high the quality is.

1549,10672,SaCkErZ9,4.34,"I have received this from several people in trades. So, thanks to all of you! Thankfully, this is my last beer tonight.  This is the 2007 vintage. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pitch black with a motor oil consistency. No carbonation and very little head. Slightly disappointing in that regard. Although, with the high abv, this is better than nothing.  Aroma is bourbon filled and oaky. Plenty of vanilla extract as well. Not a whole lot of roastiness as the bourbon seems to be the most predominant aroma. I got what I was expecting, and I loved it.  More bourbon and vanilla in the flavor. A good dose of toffee nuttiness as well, almost like hazelnut. Alcohol is surprisingly well hidden: it is very warming but doesnt add any heat or raw alcohol to the flavor, which is always nice. Very full bodied. Thick and chewy and robust.  A solid bourbon barrel beer. Probaly not my favorite, but top notch nevertheless.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I have never been a bourbon drinker because I am not a big fan of that much alcohol warmth. This is a great way to experience all the wonderful flavors of bourbon without the bite. There is no mistaking that this is one Mother of a complex beer. Bourbon on the nose with layers of vanilla, caramel, toasted almond and chocolate exposing themselves with each delicious sip. Started out just south of room temperature and only got better the longer it warmed.

1549,10672,yemenmocha,4.9,"On tap at THE HOP LEAF in Chicago, Fall 2008. Draft is more carbonated, thicker head, more aromatic, and more concentrated in flavours than the bottle.  Opaque black, light brown head that is thin and recedes to a thin layer.  Aromas of dark rum, anise liquer, oak vanillins, and pudding.  Palate is assaulted with chocolate pudding skin, perhaps a touch of butterscotch pudding, anise liqeur, and a heavy coconut character. Full body, viscous, and a little on the boozy side (but certainly not revealing of actual abv).  Finish is almost unending, increadibly smooth & soft, with more anise & pudding flavors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jim1904,4.36,"Poured from a longneck into a crystal glass goblet. Slightly below cellar temp, I'd say about 50 degrees or so.  A - Simply incredible. A jet black silk ribbon flows from the bottle into a pool of completely opaque, oily black with a dark tan head about a finger-and-a-half tall, receding at a fairly slow pace with average lacing for an Imperial stout. If nothing else, this beer exemplifies what a good stout should LOOK like.  S - Almost off-puttingly boozy until you realize that what you're smelling is almost a dead ringer for a good Kentucky bourbon. Sweet, woody, a little sharp in that good bourbonesque way.  T - Surprising. The bourbon-ish woody taste is definitely there in the immediate front and the lingering back (where the woodiness really comes out in full force), but I found that the dominating flavor here was not bourbon but chocolate. Definitely very sweet without being cloying whatsoever, a lot of good mocha, coffee, roasty toasty, woody notes. I'm sure this sounds like a run-of-the-mill Imperial stout review by now (chocolate! coffee! toast!) but this beer nails it. The bourbon character definitely hits up front, and kind of lingers around for several minutes throughout, but the chocolate quality is pleasantly surprising. For 13% and a nose to match, the alcohol here is really very subdued, giving a little burn in the throat at the very end.  D - Tiny bubbles, velvety smooth, heavy (HEAVY) body. A fine example of a good Imperial stout body. Not a session beer by any means, of course.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bung,4.67,"Dirty brown oil like black pour. Ruby red around the edges and a larger brown head than I was expecting, with carbonation throughout. Probably because this is a bit fresh explains the bubbles.  Big roast malt, mocha, caramel, boozy aroma. Smoother up front than some Imperials, flowing nicely throughout. Great array of flavors. Caramel, mocha, roast malt, oak, raisin ending with some molasses and a hint of coffee bitter. Some hop balancing throughout, but not a real strong presence. Very full bodied and sticky. Alcohol almost completely hidden, shows up more as it warms. This was really well done, better than I was expecting for being so new. Good thing I have 7 more of these.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,djeucalyptus,4.12,"Pours a thick motor-oil black with just a hint of ruby at the edges. Opaque black... A vigorous pour yielded no head, just some fine roan bubbles dancing and popping across the top.  Aroma is flat-out beautiful. Rich dark malt, burnt molasses, and vanilla. Bourbon aroma is strong, but there's an equally strong vanilla and hazelnut aroma. Amaretti cookies as well. Maple syrup and a hint of oaky cardamom wrap it up nicely.  Taste is bourbon. Sure, there's other flavors in there, but the bourbon is truly the highlight of this one. The sweetness comes across, with vanilla pudding and maple syrup intermingling with the bourbon. The usual stout flavors have taken a back seat, and as the brew warms to room-temp, entirely disappear. A bit of malt lingers, reminding me of a bourbon-soaked whopper.  Mouthfeel is beautiful. Smooth and full. Did I mention smooth? The alcohol burn is definitely there, as anticipated. Fairly viscous, reminiscent of warm maple syrup. Carbonation is moderate.  The aroma is beautiful. The mouthfeel is beautiful. But personally, I prefer a touch of bourbon in my stout, rather than hints of stout in my bourbon. This is definitely a beautifully constructed brew and a solid example of the style, but not my favorite. The bourbon is a bit over the top for me, and I know some of that could be that this bottle was fresh. Definitely worth sampling of you have the opportunity (should be a bit easier now that it's seeing wider distribution).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,sweetbrew82,4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a goblet:  P: Pours almost black from the bottle, but didn't produce much of a head. The minimal amount of foam is oak brown in color and quickly faded to a ring around the edge of the glass. The liquid sits in the glass boasting one of the deepest blacks I've ever seen from a stout. No light even dares to try and break through to the other side, not even on the edges. This is like a black hole that sucks the light out of the room and swallows it whole. But I had to dock points for the lack of head here. Otherwise, impressive.  A: Smells of Bourbon, Bourbon, and more Bourbon, along with some nice notes of vanilla, maple, earth, oak, and roasted malts. This one burns my chest just smelling it! Can't wait to take a drink...  T: Whoooweeee! This is not for the faint at heart, this is one hell of a manly stout. Maple and vanilla flavors wash over the taste buds. Quickly thereafter, the Bourbon-y, oak flavors hop into the ring and deliver the knockout blow. It dominates the dry finish, and does leave some room for the sweet maple, vanilla flavored undertones. It doesn't quite balance out the Bourbon-heavy flavor, but is delicious nonetheless. Needless to say, the 13% ABV creates a warming sensation in the mouth, and a slight burn on the way down in the chest. What a truly unique experience from a beer.  M: This stout is so full-bodied and chewy, it's almost like the consistency of maple brown syrup. Smoother than crushed velvet and slicker than a con-man. This one is a true masterpiece to be marveled at while it cascades over every square inch of the mouth. For such a strong, barrel-aged stout like this, it's amazing how smooth it is.  D: This is no ""session beer"" by any stretch of the imagination. Unless, of course, you are addicted to Bourbon and have an iron gut. But, I sure would like another! With that being said, this is one to be sipped on and savored for the unique experience of this one-of-a-kind brew.  Notes: One big ass, steroid-injected, Bourbon-flavored stout that produces some sweet maple-flavored oaky tones complimented by a vanilla twist that truly kicks your ass up and down the block. I absolutely love this, and wish it were available all the time. As it is, I feel truly blessed to have been able to get my hands on some of this hard to find brew, especially in SoCal.

I can smell the bourbon from the bottle soon after I pop the cap. The aroma is bourbon, vanilla, oak, hard to tell if there's a beer under there. The taste is very complex! First you get hit with the bourbon and oak then some roast, then some alcohol, then a bit of hop bitterness finish with a smooth bourbon roast. Its really tasty, but I like bourbon too.

1549,10672,CortexBomb,4,"Bourbon County Stout is a solid representative of the barrel aged, boozy stout category. Like most beers in its style, it has low carbonation (high alcohol content will do that for you) and an opaque appearance. The nose is strongly alcoholic, and the beer is fairly viscous in the mouth, though not as much as one might expect for a bigger brew like this.  The thing that surprised me the most about this beer was the sweetness of the flavour. Most big stouts seems to be exceptionally roasty or thick, Bourbon County stout was almost abrasively sweet on the first sip, though my taste buds quickly acclimated to it. I think my surprise contributed to my initial reaction. The beer is strongly flavoured by the bourbon casks which also impart a fairly typical vanilla edge, and the stout makes for a light, chocolate backdrop to this main show.  Overall: I like barrel aged products like this, and Bourbon County is a solid and overall tasty example of the style. I doubt I will be buying very much of this again soon though simply because Goose Island has priced it into elite territory at $22 per 4 pack. I think it's a very good beer, but I would much rather buy something like Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout at a full fiver less per 4 pack, or non-barrel premium products like Bell's Expedition at a full fiver less for a six pack. If money is no concern and you like this kind of beer it's a winner though. Well worth trying for any fan of the style.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Very little head that quickly dissipated in my brandy snifter as well.  S: When I opened the bottle, I immediately picked up the strong bourbon aroma that the label so vividly described. I also picked up a subtle mix of vanilla and smokey characteristics that were at first hard to pick up, but slowly emerged as I investigated further.  T: The first sip was mix of enjoyment and confusion on my part. Very complex in flavor, which made it really hard to pick out any specific flavoring other then the overwhelming bourbon quality. But as each sip went on, I started to figure out and pinpoint a very strong vanilla character which seem to even out the strong bourbon aging this beverage went through. A very aggressive taste that might overwhelm you at first, but continues to get better after each gulp.  M: Thick and full-body, which is perfect for this style. A bit more carbonation then I'm used to, but nothing that bothered me too much.  D: Even though this beer is 13% ABV and has a very aggressive taste, it was somewhat easy to drink considering all things.  Overall: One of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had!!!

Not too much of a head to speak of with hardly any noticeable carbonation. The blackness hardly even thins out with a tilt of the glass.  S: Right away you get strong notes of chocolate and bourbon as expected. No secret this is one very big beer. Can faintly detect licorice, almost reminds me of a wood stove heated home around the holidays. Complex and exciting.  T: Wow. First off, this beer is a raging alcoholic. Very strong notes of bourbon (even a little of the burn on the tongue). The chocolate is secondary in this beer, roasted flavors are present as well. Somewhat hard to really find the levels to this one as the alcohol is rather overpowering.  M: The carbonation level is perfect on this beer for its style. Thick mouthfeel, coats the entire palate. Again, slightly a little too hot from the alcohol. Stronger than some other barrel-aged stouts I have come across.  D: Don't think I could have more than one in a night. Enjoyable dont get me wrong, but slightly a little too aggressive to have multiple.  Overall, definitely a good beer. This was my first review so things may not have been articulated perfectly, but I did enjoy this offering. This is the first of this kind that I have seen out here in Southern California in terms of a big, burning, bourbon stout, reminds me of some of the Weyerbacher bourbon offerings from back East. Would recommend trying in order to experience ranges of taste within a style, but not my personal favorite.

The main flavour is definitely the bourbon flavour initially, but when the beer hits room temperature more roasted/chocolate flavours come through.

Roasted malts, cocoa and dark fruits linger in the background, while aromas of oak barrel and burnt caramel are less noticeable.  T- Where do I start? The initial taste is rather sweet, boasting brief flavors of dark fruits and molasses before whiskey busts down the door and breaks up their little party.

Very short lived dark brown head 1/2""... not much of a cap... the brew is of course black... very viscous on the pour.  Aroma is like a bourbon chocolate and coffee ice cream.. but man.. the bourbon punch is surprising.. thankfully I like some of Kentucky's Finest. alot of whiskey and vanilla... but quite a bit of caramel and chocolate too... but it is definitely the bourbon that is the star of the show.. if I put my face over the glass, I swear I can feel the whiskey burn my eyes (in a good way).  Wow!! I've had the BCS before.. but Christ I know I remember it as complex.. but my memory does not do it justice. Flavor starts out as a vanilla caramel sweetness but get's wiped off my palate by the bourbon.. melts slowly into chocolate with a little bit of char.. quite a bit of cherry.. almost like a kirsch.. but the cherry is fleeting as it transitions into a slick rush of bourbon that lingers forever. The body is very viscous.. accentuated by a lite little bubble carbonation.  This brew really is worth the hype... no doubt. I am keeping the drinkability down just a notch.. but it isn't a bad thing.. I want another sip immediately following the previous, but the thick mouthfeel and relative lack of carbonation hurts it for me... plus it still seems quite rough around the edges.. but still fantastic for sure.

Drank from my Surly nonic pint glass.  2008 Edition bottled on 10/03/08 (flavor will continue to develop over five years).  Appearance- Pours a super dark blackish brown with a slowly formed dark brown head that dissipates fairly quickly. The cap disappears completely shortly after leaving a thin collar and zero lacing. Smell- Probably the most intense Whiskey nose you can smell on a beer (with its close competitor being Full Sail Bourbon Barrel Imperial Porter). Plenty of vanilla bean and a wet cardboard like woodiness. Caramel, coffee and cream, alcohol and some chocolate are all pretty prevalent. Taste- Starts with a very light sweetness and an overwhelming burst of caramel and vanilla. The Bourbon Whiskey is still very young and quite intense. Had a 2007 not long ago and this burn wasn't nearly as bad. Intensely bitter woodiness from the charred oak and a light chocolate kiss. Hints of deeply dark smoky fruits and a light numbing hop bite. The alcohol is a bit rough right now but it gets way better in less than a year. Mouthfeel- Insanely thick and rich with a smooth velvety feel and light tickling carbonation. In no way could it be better. Drinkability- Admittingly, this isn't the most drinkable beer ever this fresh. When I had the 2007 a couple months ago it was much smoother and the drinkability was probably a full point better than the fresh '08 (I'm splitting the difference for my review score fyi). This thing only gets better. What's funny is I'm making it sound like its bad fresh; far from it. This is an amazing beer that I've thoroughly enjoyed every single time I've had it. Seek this out.

1549,10672,SirSketch,4.32,"Goose Island has always been one of my favorite breweries, and even being as objective as possible, I had to rate this beer very high.  Very little head when poured and extremely dark in color. The barrel aging comes out a lot in the aroma. The smell is awesome and complex, with noted of whiskey. I was surprised to catch some hop aroma.  Tastes of sweet chocolate and bourbon whiskey. Some cherry and plum come through, too. The 13% ABV is really apparent once you breath in after swallowing. Full bodied and slick as oil. Very good sipper beer. Excellent!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Nickls,4.7,"Picked this up at New Beer in NYC. They had quite a few bottles, and I'm not sure how well this held on the shelf.  A - Jet black color with a tan/caramel head. Surprising lacing for the style  S - Bourbon right up front, but not overwhelming. Hints of smokiness and bitter chocolate  T - Bourbon/whiskey is predominant, but not a strong taste of alcohol. Bittersweet chocolate notes, and not as smoky as I got in the nose.  M - Medium weight in the mouth, but smooth, rich and a little viscous  D - Very easy given the complexity and depth of this brew!  Overall, I'm sure that this sample wasn't cellared in the best way, but I still thought this was fantastic. Really brilliant stuff. I'm anxious to try the other years.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,PittBeerGirl,4.08,"Thanks to Elric73 for this one! Great trader! 2006 BCS poured into my snifter.  A-Body is a viscous motor oil black that pours with an approximately 1/2 finger foamy cocoa brown head. Head subsides slowly to a thin collar and no lacing is left behind in the glass.  S- Nose is robust and complex. The sweetness and astringency of bourbon comes through first with a big, thick, robust chocolate malt backbone.  T- The taste is very similar to the smell. The bourbon character balances with the roasted chocolate malt and hints of toffee also come through. The flavor is sweeter than most stouts I have had but it adds a nice touch. The flavors remain balanced but intensify for the finish. An alcohol warmth lingers also.  M- Nice, thick, vicious, warm mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation.  D- This was 13%? wow. did not realize that. Definitely an imperial stout but I would have guessed 9%. This one ages nicely and is very tasty. I would love to have it again!

A- Midnight black with virtually no head.  S- Bourbon is overpowering, but wonderful. Slight smell of malt on the back side.  T- The taste of bourbon is definitely at the forefront. Afterwards, the malt brings some nice sweetness to the taste.  M- Thick and smooth. Just perfect.  D- At 13% abv. this knocked me on my ass. Definitely cannot have more than one of these. Maybe one is even too much.  I wish that I would have never had the bad experience with bourbon that I had 7 years ago.

They instead used a Honker's Ale label put on inside out, and then printed Bourbon County Stout in cash register style font. Drank out of a Goose Island snifter at Sheffield's Pub in Chicago.  A: Pitch black, solid dark brown head with decent retention but little lacing. Swishing the glass results in a molasses-like oozing down the sides of the glass.  S: Bourbon and oakiness were predominant. Some vanilla and caramel hints. Delicious!  T: Was exceptionally smooth while chilled, but the bourbon really came out as the glass warmed up. Sweeter than newly bottled BCS, with more malt presence.  M: Thick, creamy, and a little bit sticky.  D: At 13%+, you can only have maybe two of these in an evening. It looks like the 2008 is only 11% which might make it a little more consumable - but this aged bottle was one and done; although I can't imagine many beers that would be a worthy follow-up.

Doesn't last long, but that's somewhat expected with the high ABV.  S: Big, spicy bourbon nose. Heavy, charred oak scents, vanilla. Beautiful.  T: An intense bourbon flavour along with the oakiness. Quite huge. Vanilla comes out on the finish. Some touches of anise, and deep roasted/burnt malts.  M + D: Big, rich, and full with a stickiness towards the end + over the lips.

1549,10672,theboozecruise,4.95,"This was the first of many Goose Island brews I tried on this past weekend's trip to Chicago. I had it on tap at the Goose Island brewpub in Wrigleyville.  It was served in a snifter, deep brown with a nice creamy golden head. $10 seems a bit much, but it came highly recommended, so why not give it a try? This definitely looked like a beer worth trying.  The smell is exactly what you would expect from something called a 'bourbon county stout'... except ten times stronger and more rich. Definite aroma of bourbon, strong chocolate flavors, a hint of vanilla... delicious.  The taste is just as complex and rich, and the alcohol content is noticeable. It's definitely not a beer I could sit down and drink one after another, but for a session starter, this one was a phenomenal brew.  I'm not a stout fan, and I'd still consider this one of the 5-10 best beers I've tried in recent memory.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,DownDaHatch,4.8,"Be ready for this one. This is certainly a sipper. I understand the ABV is in the neighborhood of 16%. Now that fall is upon us in the midwest. This is a great beer to get comfortable with. The bourbon is very present both in aroma and taste. Heavy flavor of bourbon, oak, dark chocolate and even a bit of vanilla. You almost want to chew this beer instead of drinking it. The beer pours well and develops a remarkably nice head. The beer just improves with the ability to warm while opening a bit. You will taste the bold flavors for a long time. I will venture to the cigar store and then to Binny's for a bottle and simply lounge in the hot tub one of these cooler nights.

1549,10672,julian,4.57,"2007 bottle provided in trade by a damn fine trader by the name of hwwty4. Thanks Bill!  A: Jet black with a small layer of velvety brown head.  S: Mmm, smells of wood, bourbon, chocolate and some dark fruits, like fig and raisins. Faint alcoholic presence too, but not much...I guess this has mellowed pretty well over the past 1yr+  T: Holy SHIT! This is amazing! There's a definite alcohol presence here, so I rescind my comment above. It's not a bad thing though, far from it! Up front the taste is of bourbon and chocolate then it opens up and the sweet malts and dark fruit come into play. It's slightly roasty, with perhaps a layer of coffee near the end. Aftertaste is actually chocolate-y and sweet. This is definitely a high octane beer that wants to kick your ass! I'm bending over and getting ready to be fucked!  M: Awesome. Low carbonation, almost velvety smooth feel and a nice alcohol burn going down that lasts. So good.  D: God, even though this is a monster, this is goddamn delicious. I'm so glad I have 3 more!

Appearance - The beer looks like a deep black with a nice brown/black head that is there but then settles nicely around the top of the beer.  Smell - STRONG bourbon and oak flavors with just a hint of vanilla. Almost everything is overpowered by the bourbon.  Taste - Lot of bourbon up front with some nice complex malty flavors too follow. When warmed in the mouth it really accentuates the alcohol flavor. My favorite part of the beer was the finish which tasted like Dark Chocolate that lingered in your mouth for quite some time.  Mouthfeel/drinkability- rich and warm, but surprisingly smooth. This is defiantly a sipper.  Overall the beer has a great complex malty profile with lots of bourbon flavor to it.

1549,10672,becktone,4.75,"From Notes: 9-19-08, 2007 vintage  Eye: Given the abv of this brew it looks pretty good. Head formation is pretty weak, then again the high alcohol is detrimental to it. What is here is a light brown/mud tan colored sheet/film that covers the top of the beer. Color of this one is pitch black. ""I mean how much blacker could it get?...and the answer is none, none blacker."" Lacing is not really here, it does not stick to the glass, then again, I'm thinking that the high alcohol content has something to do with that This beer, even though a small head is formed, has probably the best retention I've ever seen, It does not dwindle even after the lips have repeatedly touched it, it is still as thick, if not thicker than when it was first formed.  Nose: Strong woody aroma, vanilla, and an aroma that reminds me much of coconut. I'm quite surprised that I can even smell any of the malt characteristics, the bourbon barrel is so prevalent that the backbone of this beer is definitely very hearty to be able to cut through that. I get mainly a burnt dark grain.  Tongue: In the first sip I can taste so much malt that it is unbelievable. This isn't the first time I""ve tried this beer, I sampled it not too long ago, however, I didn't taste this much malt character. Lots of roasted notes, chocolate, and coffee as well. Roasted grain bitterness. Woodiness is also here, as well as some vanilla notes. Close to the finish I am picking up the notes from the bourbon-kinda like buttery type notes that I pick up when drinking bourbon. Overall this is one complex brew, very tasty.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Heavy on the palate with a dry finish. Leaves the lips sticky. Carbonation is extremely low, not even really noticeable less its looked for. I can't ask for more with a beer like this in terms of mouthfeel, it is perfect. This is one that you can't drink all night, but one that you'll definitely be coming back to. This is a perfect beer to it back and sip on for a while, I can see it being perfect after one has just come in from a snowy, wintery night. I'll be picking this up again, however, I'm not sure how soon, it is a pretty pricy drink.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

A= Just about the darkest beer I have ever had. This thing is as black as a bag of assholes. Even with an agressive pour there was only the slightest hint of a head which quickly disappeared.  S= This brew smelled of alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, and oak, pretty much in that order.  T= This is the Disneyland of beers. I was blown away by the fact that this beer could wow me with flavor yet force me to sip its goodness for fear of its mighty abv wrath. I detected everything I found in the aroma (bourbon, vanilla, and oak) plus a strong presence of ripe dark fruit and a sweet caramel quality that is hard to describe et heaven on the tongue.  MF= This brew had a medium heavy body and a low carbonation level. Mouthfeel was heavy yet smooth.

Is this why people smoke cigars with this stuff, to cut the sweetness? Jesus! I need to pair this with something asap.  Mouthfeel: Very rich and creamy.

The taste still makes me smile like a tourist even though I'm just back visiting again. The alcohol is there but is nicely wrapped with dark chocolate, bourbon, and molasses. Beers like this remind me why my favorite style still is a stout or a porter even with all the love to the hop bombs (hot moms?).  Mouthfeel is rich and silky.

Not much head here, but for 13%, what did you expect?  If you are a bourbon fan, this is your beer. Full stop. An intensely rich, woody and well, bourbony nose assaults the senses after even the slightest sniff. Heavy and dense, this wallop hides chocolate, booze, charred wood and grain and more booze in a smooth, complex package. Did I mention it's intensely rich? It's intensely rich.  Oh my. A sip confirms my expectations and then some. Layered chocolate-coffee malt frolicks over my tongue while bourbon wood-heat tingles. Sugary sweetness is held in check by an immense amount of roast grains and toasty wood, all of which blend together wonderfully in an absolutely decadent package. The alcohol is so big here and so, so welcome. Warm and slick, the finish is long and mature and lingers with a bittersweet boozy, woody reminder. This is hearty and knee-slappingly good.

1549,10672,jasonjlewis,4.25,"Pours a sort of weak head with some decent retention, BUT I didn't expect a great head with this particular beer. The color is very dark as well.  There is a nice bourbon smell. It is a bit faint, but it smells like a non-distilled bottle of bourbon perhaps. I'm not a liquor drinker, but that's what it smells like to me. There are faint traces of chocolate, vanilla, and mint. As the beer warms, a nice black licorice smell comes out.  Taste is liquor like. There are some fruity tones going on. There is a red grape flavor mixed with some sweet chocolate and a splash on mint with a finish of vanilla. It's wonderfully complex. As it works there is a nice black. licorice flavor.  This is such a wonderfully complex beer. It is very unique and gives a fine liquor taste without the intense alcohol level. I'm not a huge fan of liquor at all, but I do like this beer. I think this one will be a bourbon lover's dream. It is something else for a 13% abv. It's not overly boozy. It's really nicely balanced.

She roots around a little, reads a label or two and says ""this one."" Lets do it!  Just as black as the bottle predicts. She pours half the bottle with no head. After drinking it down a little, I say ""watch, here's how you pour a good head."" Man am I a moron. This stuff is too thick, too black, and too much booze to make a head. I poured it like those crazy waiters who dump your ice-water from two feet up and still no luck. Small brown bubbles welled up and fizzled out.  Smells like Johnny Walker Black Label. Maybe just because that's my whiskey of choice. Very, very strong scent. I'm having trouble sniffing through the bourbon to anything else, but worry not, I'll keep sniffing as it warms.  Very, very flavorful. The bourbon is prominent. Maybe some cocoa, maybe some charcoal (in a good way), wood. Tons of bourbon flavor. And I mean tons. This is like bourbon beer. If you hate bourbon, don't even attempt this bad boy becuase it tastes like bourbon. Also, it tastes like bourbon and has a strong bourbon flavor with a thick bourbon backing. I shit you not, If I'm lying I'm dying, this beer tastes like bourbon!  Very thick stuff. Creamy, nice, slick in the old pie hole. Like sippin on cream-of-bourbon soup.  Drinkability? This is a tough one to rate. One bottle may have a good drikability, as it's strangely enticing. More than one bottle? Yeah, right, let me see you do it.

No head - not a white, tan, or dark bubble anywheres. Smells very nice, bourbon & vanilla, with a scary undertow of alcohol.  No wonder! The alcohol is front & center, & I can feel it work its way all the way down after the first sip. Yee-ha! A second sip, after which I would not be legal to operate heavy machinery, leaves me to study the strong vanilla taste underneath the bourbon.  This beer is heavy, slick, & menacing. I've had a lot of high ABV brews that were relatively light, &/or the alcohol was well hidden, that's not the case hear. The taste doesn't suffer for - good thing I like bouron straight up! - but drinkability sure does. One's enough for me.  I'm going back to the store that still had some '07 stock tomorrow.

Sinks down to a thin coating and leaves minimal lacing on the glass.  Aroma is amazing. Complex bourbon, charred wood, and vanilla overtones dominate. Some coffee and chocolate hide underneath. Strong alcohol aroma is also present.  The flavor is indescribably good. It starts out with sweet caramel flavors and vanilla that lingers around into the finish, then a big burst of oak and bourbon. On the finish some roasty coffee and chocolate flavors come out but are still mostly covered up by the taste of bourbon. Warming alcohol as it goes down.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and velvety. Smooth like a fine bourbon.  Coming in I had no idea what this would be like. I was amazed at how good it was. This is certainly one of those must try beers.

1549,10672,trill,4.1,"This review is for the '06 vintage, courtesy of tayner. It's a shame that the '07 broke in shipping, because I really enjoyed this one.  Pours into a Gouden Carolus goblet totally opaque, with very little visible carbonation. Aroma is a lot of vanilla bean, bourbon, a hint of sherry (from oxidation, I assume, but not unpleasant), and some serious caramel as the beer warms. The taste is all of the above, plus chocolate, cherries, some tobacco and a noticeable but appropriate level of alcohol in the finish. The woodiness is more cedar than oak, and tends to build after the first couple sips, which hurts drinkability slightly. The mouthfeel is slick and just a bit sticky. As the label indicates, I could see this as being an excellent cigar beer. If it were local to me, I'd definitely stock up.  Update for the '08 bottling: I don't think they fucked with the recipe much on this one; it's nearly identical to the '06, but younger. Hotter, slightly more vibrant but less nuanced coffee and chocolate flavors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

There ended up being a small carb fountain in the center but not enough to create any sizable foam. No lacing at all. All due to the high ABV.  The aroma was bourbon, bourbon and more bourbon with a little vanilla and caramel in the very back. I hate bourbon smell in beers. If I want a bourbon, I'll drink bourbon not beer.

There was very little head that formed even when I tried to coax one with an aggressive pour. Also no lacing to speak of. I assume this is due to the high alcohol content.  Aroma was very inviting and really did remind me of my favorite bourbons. Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla. Some coffee or chocolate tones, but it really struck me as vanilla. You could also certainly sense the higher alcohol %. Smelled wonderful.  Flavor totally followed the lead of the aroma. Vanilla rich dark flavor and definitely bourbon like. It's no mystery why I love this beer. In the winter I love having a nice glass of bourbon and always relish the vanilla & Wood aged tones. This has all the same qualities. Just awesome. Rich deep oak flavor to match the vanilla. Again, you can get some coffee or chocolate tones or even dark fruit.  Huge Creamy mouth feel that says sip and savor me. I was with someone who is not used to drinking beers like this and I had to remind him several times not to drink it like an ""ordinary"" beer.  Drinkability? What is drinkability? Can you drink this quickly? NO Can you have 3 of these beers? NO. Do you mind spending over an hour and a half sipping this beer? NO, I didn't.  One and done to finish the evening.  This is an instant classic for me.  I already have my sources lined up for the 2008 release. I can't wait. I will have more on my next trip to Chicago.

1549,10672,daythree16,4.62,"Huge thanks to phil7568 for his generosity!  12 oz. bottle that says ""Bourbon County Brand Stout"" on the front label. It also has the year 2007 printed on the neck label. Bottled on 10/12/07.  Pours very thick and jet black in color with very little head into a snifter.  Aroma is very rich. Smells like chocolate covered cherries, with some bourbon adding a warm alcohol presence to the nose. There are a ton of flavors to sort out. Dark chocolate bitterness up front with some vanilla and caramel sweetness in the middle. The finish has a slight alcohol warmth but nowhere near as much of a bourbon presence as the aroma. There is also a pleasant touch of buttery diacetyl. The aftertaste seems like I've just had a bite of chocolate molten cake. Wow.  Smooth as silk. Great as an after dinner treat. Drikability is the only downfall, as it's VERY rich (not to mention the 13% ABV). I definitely wouldn't have more than one. That said, this is one awesome beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JasonA,4.61,"Received via recent trade. Bottle reads '10/12/07 101'. I think thats a 10, tough to make out.  Pours an oil slick black, no light present. Carbonation, but no head, no real lacing. Lets hope this beer recovers.  Jim Beam. LOL, but serious wood, bourbon smell instantly. Very sweet rum (bourbon) soaked raisins/dates. Smells a delciously warming 13%, Im excited. The bourbon skell simply over powers the dark (not very roasted) malt, though ot in a bad way.  BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!!  WOW!!  Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, rum sacked raisins, malt, and more malt. Wow, such a deep, full and staying flavor. My mouth is sweating at drinking this, its awesome. Even some drying stout biscuit at the end.  Flavor sits and sits and sits. Reminds me of drinking a single malt scotch. Take a sip, enjoy the bite, and run with the flavor for a couple minutes. I wanted to give a 5, but carbonation level could be improved.  I wisht these came in 22oz. I have 3 more downstairs, but Im going to sit on those a while, I think time will do this brew good. That said, the price is pretty high for 12oz. Though I think I would take this over a dfh www stout.  god i want more",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,khiasmus,4.62,"pours a pitch black, brown around the edges, with a minimal amount of head.  The aroma will blow your mind. Oak, bourbon, dark fruits, roasted grains, alcohol, cane sugar... one of the best aromas, period. you must get a whiff of this.  taste is much like the nose. the sweetness is intense, the alcohol is intense, as is the oak and all of the rich flavors.. smoked wood, chocolate, dark fruits... finish is much the same, some roasted grain and the oak is so rich.  Thick, velvety, smooth, rich. The finish is warming and slightly dry. mmm.  I could have this frequently, especially with cigars and as a hangout beer. I wish it was more available.

1549,10672,semihobo,4.1,"Served fresh on tap in a snifter ($10) at the Clybourn brewpub.  Near black color with a ring of mocha head with fine texture. Good lacing with each sip.  Smells of bourbon, almost as if it was a blend of bourbon and something to cut it. A bit of oak. Milky sweet malts. Coconuts.  Tastes of creamy bourbon with almond paste. Sweet but not cloying. Minty hops. Tarry. Alcohol is pretty well masked for the ABV (note: bulletin board says 11% alcohol by volume, the website says 11%, the menu said 13.5% alcohol by volume, but I didn't ask which was the correct ABV).  Light carbonation, tickly. Sticky finish, medium body. Pretty easy going for the style.  Would drink this again, falters as it warms but definitely very approachable, so bourbon-y and delicious... and I don't even like bourbon that much.

1549,10672,JamesS,2.12,"Pours a very deep black color, although with very little head and almost no lacing. I was very disappointed with this beer, as I expected a stout with some bourbon lacing, not a pint of bourbon with some stout lacing. The scent and taste are nearly all bourbon flavors, so strong that no stout attributes come through. This also causes the whole thing to be very rough. It's not at all balanced. Not a good beer, which is a shame after the other wonderful 'big' beers I've had of Goose Island's.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,CrellMoset,4.57,"*UPDATE 03/20/09*  Well, this beer is still pretty damn amazing. I'm gonna kick the appearance score up half a point - for a 13.0% abv brew, the lacing, retention, and stick really aren't THAT bad. Everything else is still flawless or near-flawless: smooth, woody bourbon, vanilla, maple syrup, toffee, molasses, chocolate, all in the nose and mouth in differing amounts, but all pungent and authentic, and wrapped up in a smooth, creamy, soft package. It's a huge beer, but it's an amazing one. Cellar this. Do it.  --- 2006 bottle from Elric73 in a trade - thanks! Poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Flops out of the bottle like dark, black motor oil. Very slowly a fizzy, chocolate-colored head rises to the surface of this beer and then fades within seconds, leaving a dense, deep, dark, black, immobile mass of fluid.  Aroma: Surprisingly mild, even as it warmed. The most prominent aromas are concentrated, dried, sticky dark fruits and a hearty, woody oak note. There's definitely some woody vanilla and a good helping of bourbon, but it's really not nearly as strong here as it is in the ...  Taste: So many adjectives for this one. Roasted chocolate - light and sweet - melds with the oaky vanilla. Sweet, milky, creamy malt notes meld with the oaky woody notes to lend a hint of maple syrup and molasses. Smooth bourbon is very prominent but not harsh, and it melds very well with the other flavors, in my opinion. Plenty of spicy, grassy, earthy notes, figs and raisins, plenty of warm, sweet, smooth alcohol. Almost a 5.0 in my book ... aw what the hell. It was really tasty.  Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy, with little carbonation. Very full-bodied and even, with fine-to-medium sized bubbles. Creamy.  Drinkability: Crazy alcohol, but it's very well-balanced, blended, and mixed in my opinion. I really liked this one, especially as it warmed. If you like bourbon (and I do), this is a beer to try. Otherwise, you might find it a little over the top, especially in the taste department.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Biggness,4.37,"This beer pours very dark with a ver slight brown head, I was hoping for a littl emore head for such a highly acclaimed beer. The initial smell was of whiskey... very strong alcohol and barrel aging smells.. a little too over powering but after a few sips this smell went away and you could smell the barrel aging and beautiful malts. The taste of this beer is wonderful, the barrel aging is perfect with the flavor you can get the taste of it but it does not overshadow the great stout that this all started with, suprisingly enough @ 13% you can not taste the alcohol at all, very well hidden with the beautiful malt flavors and the barrel aging. The mouthfeel is very thick for this beer one of the thickest beers I have ever tasted, feels wonderful in my mouth. I would love to say I could drink this all night but @ 13% this is something I can only have one or two of BUT it is very drinkable, I would be afraid of these catching up to me too fast @ 13% though.

Thin head of foam, quickly dissipates to a thick ring of sticky caramel-colored lacing that clings to the glass. Aroma is absolutely incredible, huge sweet bourbon punch right off the bat, heavy and malty, grainy undertones. Taste is also incredible, sweet and warm alcohol sugars up front. Malt backbone is enormous, anise and licorice flavors round out this brew. Finish is slightly bitter and leaves a drying effect. Mouthfeel is thick, moderate carbonation, slight roughing on the tongue, washes down smooth and coats the mouth and throat.

Pours a jet black body with a decent patch of dark brown head that retains well, considering the high ABV. The aroma is as intoxicating as the alcohol lurking within this monster of a brew: chocolate chip cookies, whiskey, wooden oak, and a hint of vanilla.  The flavor is nothing short of brilliant. Bitter dark chocolates pair with massive amounts of Bourbon whiskey. The alchol heat is intense, but not at all unpleasant, delivering some spicy wooden twangs along with vanilla and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is thick and rich, luxurous to the palate with a lasting, boozy bite. All I can say about this beer is ""Wow"".

Mouthfeel: slick and oily, lingering flavors, excellent  Drinkability: pretty good, but the alcohol could be a little more subdued. Too big to drink more than a 12oz bottle.  Overall: Excellent beer.

A = The liquid is the color of a darkly charred barrel, the foam and lace appear with a dark complexion similar to well used and aged rope.  S = There are so many things going on here! Let's start with the enticing scent of rich and musky bourbon (served straight from the cask) melded with overtones of coffee, chocolate, hazel nut, and light citrus.  T = A fair amount of carbonation tickles tha palate as the thick rush of oily bourbon, coffee, and nutty chocolate explode on the palate.

1549,10672,ommegoose,4.67,"Bottled on 10/11/07.  Pours out very thick and black, with reddish hues. Generates no head, even with a hard pour. Leaves a ring of fine bubbles around the edge, that stick to the sides of the glass when swirled.  Massive bourbon smell when the bottle opens. Big vanilla and oaky aromas. Chocolate cake soaked in bourbon or dark rum. Molasses. The amount of bourbon character is outstanding.  Wow. Explosive. Basically everything in the nose is on the palate. Like a boozy chocolate cake. Then there's spicy oakiness, and sweet molasses or caramel flavors. Some examination finds dark burnt malt, which is supported by a buried hop profile to add bitterness. Some dark roasted coffee notes show up over time. Juicy plum is a nice treat, as well. Finishes oaky, with some smoke. Some alcohol tingling on the palate and on the way down. Will probably be alleviated with some more aging. This was at around 8 months. Of course, after half a bottle, you won't get more than a pleasant warming out of it.  Very full mouthfeel. Fills the palate with flavor. Carbonation is soft and barely noticeable. Suits the beer quite well. If only more bourbons coated the tongue like this.  Drinkability suffers from the high abv, and the overpowering flavors. It would be a waste to drink more than one in a session. Sharing a bottle is not a bad idea. It's not an everyday beer either. Minor quibbles with an excellent package. Still a wonderful beer experience, and a must-have for beer advocates. I'll definitely revisit the next vintage.

1549,10672,Jmamay22,4.27,"This beer sounds powerful. The label's simple straightforward story readies the reader for its impending impact.  The eyes: This double stout pours out an extreme darkness devoid of all light. A vigorous pour fails to produce any lasting effect of a head. What quickly disappears is colored a dark tan. I don't know if I've ever viewed a beer so close to black. Perhaps Nøgne Ø Dark Horizon shares the title. Aside from the blackness there is little else to discuss without any head and subsequent lacing.  The nose: Upon cracking this bottle open I'm blasted with vanilla and booze. The effect of the bourbon cannot be understated and truly calls to attention immediately. The beer screams ""Get the F out of my way!"" Beneath the vanilla and bourbon there's a nice charred nearly smoke like quality that creates a unique dimension that adds depth and character.  The tongue: First to note is the near syrupy and thick quality of this big stout. It coats and covers as the flavor lingers long on the palete. Low on carbonation and rightly so. The booze provides a glowing and warm character after swallowing, but it grows enjoyable rather than a sharp stab of burning alcohol. The vanilla continues to play a large role, but it is less dominant than in the nose. The sticky mouthfeel quality enhances the perception of sweetness. The charred wood of the nose is not evident while tasting. There is some chocolate and more specifically cocoa flavors especially towards the end. Plum skins (it feels strange to type this) come through and fit in nicely with the flavor profile.  The mind: I am filled with delusions provided by this single beer. It is truly astonishing, but refrains from being overwhelming or cloying. It is big in all the right places rather than sloppy and out of place. Surely a single bottle will due, but it doesn't go down with any degree of difficulty. A truly exciting experience.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Foxman,4.67,"It pours an absolutely obsidian black, like the darkest, velvet celestial wormhole. Two fingers of whipped cocoa brown head sink soon to vestigial sprinkles. Oh...and lacing?...lacing?...we don't need no stinking lacing!  In the aroma, malt is dark roasted and charred with deep caramel, dark chocolate, and black molasses. Dates, raisins, vanilla, and smoky oak join a hint of bourbon and a hot shot of alcohol.  Upon sipping, with heavy emphasis on the act of sipping, it's heartily sweet with caramel, dark cherry, molasses, figs, dates, and singed sugar. It then crisps a beat with baker's chocolate, raw cocoa, and espresso. Vanilla, oak, and smoke ground a glaring flash of vaporous alcohol. Residual malt sugar and spirited bourbon join burnt biscuit bottoms in gracing a finish of mild crispness and evaporative alcohol coolness. My god, it's full of flavor!  Full bodied, it flows fully and slowly, like straight 30W, and the light crisp glow seals the deal.  If there's a flavor profile that's fuller, deeper, and more complex, and better blended and crafted, I've yet to find it. Everything a monster stout should be, this one seems to be. Granted, the ABV is outsized, aggressive, and white hot, but if you can bear the buzz the flavor is a rich reward. Light dies here and flavor explodes, and the happiness it brings is a joy to experience and behold.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,DefenCorps,4.55,"12oz bottle, 2007 vintage, poured into my snifter. I have fond memories of the first time i had this beer - Feb of 2007 at the pub in Wrigleyville, during my newbie days. Onto the beer  A: Pitch black with a thin, dark brown head that recedes fairly quickly to a ring. There's some carbonation running up the side of my glass  S: Intoxicating in it's thickness and intensity of aromas. Bourbon (you don't say!) chocolate, coffee, plums, raisins. My nemesis oxidation seems to have run through my collection of twist-off bottles and this one's no different. However, in the case of this beer, it's pleasant as it adds to the intensity. In ways, this beer right now reminds me of oak aged Dark Lord. Intense! As this one warms up, I'm getting some vanilla and maybe, some oak?  T: Massive bourbon booziness to start things off with a fantastic combination of chocolate, molasses, cocoa, raisins and coffee on the finish. There's a pleasing alcohol heat too. Excellent stuff, way better than the Founders KBS.  M: Heavy, creamy and yet silky smooth on the tongue. Fantastic stuff  D: At 13%, I'm not going to drink more than one tonight but I wish I could  **Edit 16 July 2012** I'm revisiting this beer after over a year. It's been longer since I've revisited the 2007 vintage (bottled 11 Oct 2007) that I reviewed above.  The nose is incredibly smooth and mellow. Rich, fudge, dark chocolate, mellow bourbon (never thought I'd say that about BCS), moderate alcohol (ditto), a little oak. Very well integrated. Not much oxidation per se, though age is apparent, specifically in its mellowness. Decadent. The palate is similar, with a lot more vanilla up front along with booze and bourbon. Cocoa, dark chocolate, mildly bitter with a moderate tannin character that's washed over by the sweetness. It does, however, linger on in the finish, along with a little booze. Vanilla chocolate fudge. Yum. While full in body, the alcohol does lighten the palate some. Excellent stuff, though I think the 07 is on a gentle downhill trajectory now.  4.5/4.5/4.5  **28 Dec 2013** My last bottle of the 08 vintage. The booze has really mellowed out on the nose, and amazingly enough, oxidation hasn't taken over, allowing the blend of smoke, chocolate, bourbon and tootsie roll Come out. Dark fruit - dates and raisins- represent oxidation here. The palate is boozy, chocolate , sweet and yummy. Vanilla, dark caramel, dark chocolate, dried dates and a firming oak tannin character are all present. Excellent, 4.5 across the board.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

There is a lot going on here.  Taste: Real nice and sweet at the beginning, with chocolate tones, caramel and sweet malts. Spicy alcohol and bitterness ends the tasting just right.  Mouthfeel: Buttery-smooth and coats your throat on the way down.

A Chocolate, vanilla, whiskey brew that still has a punch of alcohol after 2 years. Extremely sweet without being cloying. Gobs of malt and hints of smoke.  Thick would be an understatement.

You can smell this from about 10 feet away.  T: Again, very complex. Strong, oaky smokiness hits first (very similar to bourbon flavor), followed by a lot of sweet chocolaty malt. Slight hop bitterness. Taste seemed to mellow and smooth out as the beer warmed.  M: VERY thick and syrupy mouthfeel. Smooth with little carbonation.  D: I found myself sipping this beer as if it were a fine wine. Smokiness is a bit pungent and high ABV, so I definitely wouldn't want to have more than one or maybe two of these.

This aroma of this beer reminded me of a cherry cordial drenched in bourbon. Rich dark chocolate tones with plenty of cherry, smoke, and alcohol.  The taste was very heavy on malt. I tasted sweet, dark chocolate, some of the cherry notes as noticed in the aroma, and undertones of vanilla and toasted oak from the bourbon aging.

I still appreciate the color quite a bit. Aroma is clearly chocolate dominated, followed by dark fruits, brandy, and a bit of alcohol. It is a very sweet nose, which is perfect for this style. Big on chocolate cake in the flavor, with rum soaked raisins, cherry cordial, and a bit of...more chocolate cake I guess. Body I like because it is slick, but not too heavy. Also, the alcohol is not too in your face, which is again, perfect for this style. One is enough for me in one night, but it is definitely one that can be sipped over the course of an hour or two.

Just a thin ring. Thick as maple syrup, dark and opaque as molasses.  Smell is oak, vanilla, chocolate malt, vinous woody tannins. There is a note of merlot. Cocoa powder smell has an interesting ""dry"" aroma - don't know how else to describe it. Hint of smoke.  Taste is wowowow. Boozy, bourbon, charred oak, burned sugar, burned chocolate. Long dry charred aftertaste, with plenty of smoke notes. I can see why they claim this is a good cigar beer. Lots of alcohol -- warming, sweet, sharp. The only bitterness is the toasted (or burned and smoked?) malt bitterness. Hops, if they are there, are totally sublimated to the intense smoky-char flavors. This is the most burned flavors I've ever experienced in a beverage.  Certainly this is an extremely thick and chewy beer. Syrupy, almost, it almost sticks to the inside of the mouth and under the tongue.  Drinkability? This thing is definitely a sipper, but what you sip is pretty good.  What can you say about a 13% beer with this much bourbon-barrel overtness? This beast is intense, and in your face. A smash-mouth charred malt bomb, exploding with burned sweet smoky flavors.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MSchae1017,4.42,"I poured this beer into a Kentucky Bourbon Ale snifter. The beer produced a jet black color and dark brown head. The head did not linger however, as the 13% ABV left only a few wisps across the top, and a broken ring around the edge. The aroma is full of dark roasted barley giving off chocolate and coffee flavors, vanilla and hints of coconut from the bourbon are present along with the light presence of the charred oak. Sipping the beer, and the massive amount of darkly roasted barley hits your first and then the bourbon comes in to take care of the rest. The first flavors to pound your tongue are chocolate and coffee and massive sweetness, but the bourbon balances this out with vanilla and enough charred oak to keep the sweetness in check. The beer is a full explosion of flavor, but everything has been put into balance incredibly well. The mouthfeel is as full bodied as they come, with enough carbonation present to bring the beers wonderful flavors to the forefront. A sipping beer for sure, but and idea digestif during colder months.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,deepsouth,4.26,"this was a 2007 vintage poured into a great divide snifter.  the beer poured the deepest black. not a hint of head. it still sticks to the side of my glass though.  the smell is bourbon, molasses, licorice, butterscotch, & chocolate. super duper complex.  the taste is exactly like the smell. super complex. SUPER BOURBON. i love it. without question, the tastiest goose island offering i have had.  the mouthfeel is full and velvety. great for the style.  let's not kid, this beer will kick your ass. the bourbon is the big show in this beer. if you don't like bourbon, don't try this beer. it's an evening sipper for sure. only rating it what i am as it's impossible to drink more than one of these and they are really better to split with a friend.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,FtownThrowDown,4.7,"2006 Bottle. Pours real nice and thick with no head whatsoever. Smell is incredible. Lots of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, with some hints of bourbon/alcohol coming through as well. This has a myriad of flavors going on in the taste. However, they're not blended together very well. It's one after another as they fight for the lead. The flavors are good, but not working well and complimenting as they should. Huge, creamy mouthfeel.  Update: 2007 batch. This beer is incredible. Much more complex barrel flavor. Very good vanilla, bourbon and oak in the flavor. This batch is everything this beer needs to be. One of my favorite beers right now.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,JDV,4.35,"Bottle from Holdenn, The_Epeeist or drewbeerme. Thanks from all of you! &lt;br&gt; '07 Bottle. Pours dark, dark black and oily with a short lived tan head in a snifter. Smell is bourbon, oak, then sweet roasty malt. A fair amount of bourbon in the nose, but not overwhelming. Taste is oily bourbon woodiness, then bittersweet chocolately roast. Balanced well, leaning towards a touch more bourbon than most bourbon beers I've had. Very light alcohol in the flavor for 13%, but a slight bit warming. Rich oily mouthfeel and light, but softly prickling carbonation. This is damn good.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,btuthill,4.72,"Whoa.  pours very dark and about as viscous as anticipated. the carbonation is proper, and the head is robust. the smell is intoxicating. i imagine one could smell it from across the room. thick vanilla, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate, and perhaps a bit of oak dominate your nose. the taste doesn't disappoint, and is true to the smell. the smooth, silky, perhaps slightly creamy feel adds to the comforting flavor.  the flavor may be a bit strong for me to drink more than two of these in a sitting, but at 13%, i can't complain. this is a truly world class beer, and the definition of a 5.0 smell and taste.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mhewes,4.7,"A : Pours a nice dark black with a very small brown head.  S : Lots of bourbon and oak. Some roasted malts and coffee also.  T : Starts off with a strong bourbon flavor, has some chocolate and espresso flavors also. A nice hop bitterness in there also. Really smooth  M : Creamy, smooth  D : I want more. This was a great stout and one of my favorite bourbon ones.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Wetpaperbag,4.77,"Got in a trade with akorsak, thanks man.  A- Nice pour, the head was there, and then vanished quickly. A small ring of foam around the circumference of the glass. The beer is very dark and black as night.  S- The Bourbon smell is very present, dark with a slight anise smell.  T- The taste is very delicious. Carmel and buttery. The roasted malt character is very superb. The alcohol spice is there to tickle the tongue. Very good stout, I wish I had more then one bottle.  M- Very nice and smooth. The spice of the alcohol is very nice.  D- Yes please!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BDIMike,4.12,"Pours an incredibly jet black color. Also with a thin tan head, that almost has a red hue to it. Looks like oil. Very nice smell. Lots going on here. Smells of vanilla and smoke. Also a strong smell of alcohol and the bourbon barrels. Slight sweetness of caramel at the end as well. Lots of taste to this beer. The first taste is of the alcohol and a bourbon tinge. Once the alcohol goes away there are great tastes of caramel, burnt malts, and a vanilla taste stays on the tongue. Mouthfeel is very thin and smooth. Almost like the feel of a thin oil or something like that. Drinkability is amazing for something that is 13% ABV. At the first taste of this beer, I was not a fan because I generally don't like the beers that taste like a hard alcohol. However, this beer is great when the alcohol taste cedes and the many flavors of the malts come to the forefront.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,drunkmonk,4.59,"Bottle courtesy of DavidEddie. A karmic throw in of epic proportions!  12oz bottle 07 vintage, with bottle on date: 01207 Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery Snifter.  Pours ultra thick and jet black, no light penetrating at all. No head, only a faint oil patch lace. Pungent charred malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon soaked cherry aromas. Booze is there too, oh yeah. Taste of dark German chocolate cake drizzeled with a cherry bourbon sauce. Coffee, chocolate and warm boozy bourbon left on my tongue. Ultra warming, with a thick creamy coating mouthfeel. Cigar beer, desert beer, sit back and enjoy life beer. This is a world class sipper. Glad I still have one more of last years vintage in the cellar.  Huge thanks Dave for the chance to consider this again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Greggy,4.08,"A- No real head to speak of, but the huge black thick 10w-30 body made up for it. Once swirled, A huge golden coating clings to the sides of the glass and slowly recedes. This baby is thick.  S- Huge fresh flower component, cherry, tobacco, touch of bourbon.  T- Barleywine-like, syrupy sweetness. Crazy sweetness that maybe a bit of aging would take care of. Big chocolate and caramel.  M- No carb, but great.  D- 11%, but a bit to sweet. I am glad I split the bottle with a buddy because I just wouldn't be able to finish one of these, and maybe not even half of it myself.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,tedpeer,4.32,"12 ounce pour into a chalice. Bottle from 2007.  A - Black and thick. Very little head, quickly settled to no head.  S - Coffee and bourbon aroma. Wife said it smelt like Kahlua.  T - Bourbon taste mostly overpowers everything else, but I still get a hint of coffee. After taste lingers a while.  M - creamy and smooth. Coats the mouth.  D - This one's a sipper and at 13%, one's my limit.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,raverjames,4.97,"12oz bottle from 2006 batch.  A: Black, thick and viscous. This is the way any good imperial stout should look, in my opinion.  S: Slight coffee like aroma, with hints of bourbon and oak. Hops have really subsided over the years.  T: Exceptional flavor. Taste is slight bourbon, chocolat, toffee, and the dark malts are really standing out. Everything is nice and balanced. I have tried this when it was fresh, but it was much harsher.  M: Silky smooth, thick, creamy, and just perfect.  D: This was surprisingly easy to drink. Now that it has some age, the flavors are balanced out and it is a wonderful beer.  Thanks to John at Goebel Liquor for selling me this. I want more!!!:)",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,gford217,4.28,"Bottle courtesy of numerous generous traders poured into a snifter.  A: Pours pitch black with very little head and mahogany hints when held up to light.  S: The aroma certainly doesn't betray the name as the bourbon makes itself known in the aroma with a definite alcohol burn in the nose. Some malt and smoke in the smell as well with a faint hint of sweetness from caramel and chocolate. It's really about the bourbon here.  T: Initial sweet malt flavor with caramel, vanilla and chocolate is quickly blown away by a massive bourbon blast. The finish is slightly bitter with coffee and smoked wood and leaves a serious aftertaste that lingers for a while.  M: Despite the alcohol presence, the mouthfeel is extremely creamy and smooth with a nice carbonation complement.  D: This beer has too much booze to be seriously drinkable, though the mouthfeel belies the bourbon dominance. I like this one but the bourbon is just a bit overpowering for my liking (and I'm a big bourbon fan).",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,vwcraig,4.37,"2007 edition as an extra from lightindarkness  Pours black for sure into a Michael Jackson snifter. Extra thick and syrupy and no head at all. Mostly just whiskey in nose. Vanilla, oak and a coconut type smell. No mistaking what you are drinking with this one. Instantly warming almost a burn. Whiskey up front and mid-palate. Finish finally brings the stout into play with the roasty flavors. Not at all for people that do not get along with whiskies and the tastes. Full bodied to say the least with a sticky mouthfeel. Drinkability would have me drink just one of these per night.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Kegatron,4.45,"12 oz bottle into a snifter. 2007 release.  Pours black as an oil slick with a 1/2 finger of burnt mocha colored head. This eventually fizzles out into a still, dead looking black surface that reminds of the lifeless eyes of a Great White shark. Lacing is relegated to a spotty smattering at first and then eventually a fantastic looking oily brown residue that coats the side of the glass. The aroma is OMG! huge bourbon notes straight up my nose and other places.. Aaaaargh! I've never had a beer burn my eyeballs before! In all seriousness, the bourbon notes do absolutely dominate the nose but somehow I can still pick up some of the Stout notes, including chocolate, smoke, roast, and char.  The taste is just as boozy with bourbon notes as the aroma and it's no wonder that I put it in a snifter. Overpowering notes of oak and vanilla mingle with the molassass, roasted malts, chocolate, espresso, smoke, and soy sauce character of the Stout. There's a ton in there but it's all just a bit unbalanced towards the bourbon side right now. The mouthfeel is right up there with the deepest for me (Dark Lord & Expedition)and is just absolutely thick and chewy as can be. That 13% is present but gives off more warmth than it does heat and combines with the bourbon notes to finish things with a bit of a hot punch.  Wow! This is just a beast of a beer in every capacity. Huge bourbon? Huge Stout flavors? Huge alcohol? Check! Check! and Check! My only gripe with this beer is that right now, the bourbon overrides some of those wonderful Stout characteristics a little too much. I'm most definitley looking forward to aging a bottle of this for a year and revistiing it again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Slynger,4.92,"Jet black with a slim, creamy, dark tan lid.  One sniff is all I need to know that if this beer's flavor can match up with it's nose, it surely must be my favorite stout of all time. Inhaling deep, my nostrils fill with sweet dark chocolate, molasses, and caramel; complimented by fresh ground black coffee, vanilla oak barrels, smoke, and bourbon spice. Absolutely aromazing.  The flavor is everything it should be and more. Sweet melted dark chocolate with dark fruits, molasses, caramel, toffee, and red apples. Next comes dark, roasted, black coffee, sweet smoke and vanilla, and woody oak barrels with bourbon and spice. Very, very nice. Body is full as can be and mouthfeel is milkshake creamy and smooth.  Absolutely OUTSTANDING!! Of all the imperial stout's I've tried, this is the best. Simply dynamite on all levels.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bkilpatr,2.89,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay glass. 05/12/08. 2007 version, bottled on 10/12/07.  Pours nearly pitch black with hints of ruby around the edges. Almost no head at all, just a thin layer of brown head that quickly disappeared. Aromas of bourbon, sweet vanilla and caramel, and roasted malts.  The taste is very complex and interesting. There is a heavy bourbon flavor, as well as vanilla and caramel, chocolate, molasses, roasted malt, and oak. Some bitter roasted coffee and dark chocolate in the end. and of course there's the alcohol (13% ABV) taste. There's only one part that I REALLY don't like. There's a massive sickly sweet flavor to it. It's almost disgusting. If it weren't so darn sweet it would be amazing. So the taste rating is hard to decide: on one hand I think there is a nice mix of flavors, while on the other hand the sweetness is way too sick and overpowering.  Mouthfeel is alright. The carbonation is very low, so it feels kinda flat, thick, and sticky. Drinkability for me is low. The sweetness, it kills me. That and the high ABV. Definitely a sipper, and no way I could drink more than one... well, if I can even get through this one.  I can't see how this beer gets the high ratings. Very overrated in my opinion. Try it if you must though.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,joepais,4.69,"Thanks to Jay23 for this one 2007 Bottle poured into a sniffer produced a tan colored head that turns to a nice ring around the glass. All this on top of a jet black body  Aromas of vanilla roasted malts, bourbon, and a slight oak note as well  Flavors are bourbon, sweet roasted malts, vanilla caramel and a hint of black licorice. Great flavors almost no bitters but the alcohol heat keeps the sweetness in check. Sips extremely well, smooth is a good word for it thick and oily in the mouth  Again drinkable would not be the word I would associate with this one, sipping is a must .one of the ultimate desert beers I have had so far. A great night cap and should be enjoyed as such",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kasper,4.69,"2007 bottle compliments of lightindarkness, poured into a an oversized goblet.  A: Pours like thin motor oil, the darkest of browns -- just a shade away from black -- with a millimeter of light chocolate color head that disappears before you can take the first sip, leaving only a ring, and a faint swirl in the center, of the glass.  S: Boy, can I recognize the aroma of this brew any day. Bourbon, vanilla, oak, and bittersweet chocolate all rolled into one voluptuous scent  T: Oh man, sweet malted chocolates up front, followed by a rush of vanilla and then an oaky bourbon alcoholic finish. This isn't your grandmas traditional stout, that's for sure. But it's f**&ing fantastic!!  M: Smooth, but oily. It's thick, but not DL or Ten Fidy thick. Full bodied, nonetheless. Real mild but tinglingly carbonation, especially on the finish.  D: This is up there in my top 5 brews. Has been since I first tried it, and don't see it dropping out anytime soon. Due to its rarity in my area, I've never put back more than one in a sitting, and don't recommend anyone else take up the challenge at 13%ABV.  I must admit, however, that I recently tasted a one-year aged 2006 (when it was still 11%ABV) and i found that one to be even more desirable. A good one to roll one up w/ imho =P",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,corey0212,4.57,"Received in my first-ever trade! Thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for this one!!!  Pours black, with just the faintest hint of ruby around the edges. Little tiny tan head fades almost completely, but hangs around the edge of the glass. The smell is unreal. Vanilla, spicy oak, alcohol....almost eye-watering. The vanilla bean taste is just massive in this beer. There's some chocolate on the back end of this, too. This is just spicy, vanilla bourbon heaven. Incredible chewy mouthfeel, lingering spiciness on the tongue....it's fair to say I'm losing my mind here. Sometimes I think about giving up on the ""big beers"", and drinking pale ales every day. Then I try something like this, and realize how mind-bending some beers can be. This is outstanding!!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,brdc,4,"Small capped bottle poured into a snifter. 2007 batch.  Very dark, with a rare, faint reddish brown highlight, and a minimal tan head with no retention or lacing. Aroma is bourbon, bourbon, a bit more bourbon and a few hints of roasted malts and caramel. Full bodied, with minimal perceptible carbonation, its taste is also dominated by bourbon, making it a sipper. The heavily malted taste adds some sweetness with some chocolate and caramel notes that if are not enough to balance it, can keep it interesting. Very good beer if you like bourbons, otherwise this is not exactly balanced. It will probably improve with aging.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,rallison,4.6,"It's been a while since I've treated myself to this wonderful beer. 2007 Batch.  Pours a thick black with a small tan head that basically dies.  Smells of sweet vanilla bourbon. Notes of chocolate with only slight bits of roast come in. Lovely.  The taste? Oh, the taste. There is a ton going on here. The rich chocolates back there meld perfectly with the sweet vanilla bourbon flavors. Dark fruits come out just slightly, and there are faint hints of coffee in the background. The bourbon is pleasantly pleasing and pleasantly not sharp. Touches of alcohol nicely balance things and provide a great warmth. This is still one of the absolute best bourbon imperial stouts I have ever had. Want to try a perfectly crafted vanilla-y bourbon RIS? Try this.  The mouthfeel here is deliciously creamy and rich, touches on cloying, but thankfully backs away. Thick & chewy? Why yes. Nice.  Drinkability, all things considered, is very good.  Highly recommended.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,paco1029384756,4.87,"Pour is thick, pitch black with almost no head and very thin lacing. Scent is huge with oak, bourbon, smoke, molasses, maple and sweet chocolate. Taste initially of bourbon, oak, smoke and chocolate mellowing into a coffee bean flavor with more chocolate. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Drinkability is very high, not that is needs to be, and should be enjoyed to its fullest extent.  2007 bottle reviewed. I first had this beer when it was released, and the flavor has changed quite a bit. I have no notes of my first tasting, but the biggest change is the bourbon flavor balance. I was hooked from the very first sip I took, and even after the flavor has changed this much I still can't get enough.  With some warmth alcohol becomes prevalent, and bourbon flavor becomes more pronounced. A divine brew at any temperature, and an absolute must buy.  2006 Bottle review:  Bottled July 14, 2006, enjoyed July 14, 2008.  Pours black with little carbonation and an extremely fine ring of lacing.  Scent is huge, lots of bourbon and dark fruits with plenty of oak and some alcohol making this one of the finest scents I have come across.  Taste is equally big, oak and bourbon up front developing further with the alcohol warming nicely. Some dark fruits and dry oak finish this one off exquisitely.  Mouthfeel is heavy and perfectly smooth with an excellent drinkability.  After 2 years this beer is ridiculous, alcohol is more apparent but makes it feel more like a bourbon that has been cut with a few drops of water. As a bourbon lover I have to say, this is one of the finest barrel aged beers I have ever had. I look forward to trying more vintages and future releases of this magnificent beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,amiles,4.77,"Finally got around to reviewing this beer even though I've had it a number of times now.  A: Poured into a Gouden Carolus mini tasting glass, medium pour. Pitch black with ruby brown highlights around the edges. Attractive whitish head spins in the center while a dark tan foam clings to the side of the glass.  S: Big bourbon aroma with malty chocolate. So powerful it seemed to overpower everything I could. It doesn't get much better than this.  T: A VERY well balanced combonation of bourbon, chocolate, espresso, and malts. So decedent and almost overwelming at times... not enough to make me stop drinking though.  M: This one is compared to KBS a lot and I think this is where this beer stands ahead of it. The mouthfeel and creamy and smooth, where KBS is a bit thin. The mouthfeel I get from this one keeps me interested all the way through. Spin it in your mouth and you'll know what I mean.  D: Wonderful night cap, but keep it at one. The 13% does hit you and the bourbon is a bit much. A 12oz serving is quite fine, but for what it is... Drinkability is excellent.  In my top three... definitely.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RixBeer,4.35,"Pours blacker than a moonless night. A thin creamy colored head that fades lightly into a ring along the edge. Light carbonation cloud in the middle of the glass. Cloud fades over the course of the beer leaving only the ring that lasts throughout the entire beverage.  Smells of bourbon first then of sweet chocolate and molasses with a large follow up punch of bourbon. Brown sugar, vanilla and roasted oak. Faint hints of vanilla and cocoa. the smell seems to get sweeter as the beer warms and is drunken.  This beer oozes sweet chocolate, molasses, bourbon. There are still hints of a light vanilla. It has an overwhelming bourbon and bitter sweet chocolate taste. Lightly carbonated and leaves a tingly molasses/bourbon aftertaste. The chocolate flavors become increasingly bitter as the beer warms. A little too much of a bitter after taste as the beer reaches room temperature.  This beer feels the way it tastes. A little boozy, lightly carbonated and way way way to easy to drink. Very smooth for such a power house. Bubbles a little in the back of your throat as I drink the first glass.  At 13% I should be able to down these as easy is it goes down. This beer is the best of Bourbon meets a stout champion. I can't believe that I not only want another but, I'm sure after #2, I'll want a third. This beer is awesome! I raise my glass to the brewer's at Goose Island.

1549,10672,PEBKAC,2.41,"Bottled: 10/11/07  Last bottle in this Top 100 BIF box received from kmpitz2. I've been dreading this one for a bit(just not my style). My reviews were due in about a month ago, but Kevin has assured me I would still receive partial credit & be able to go on the senior trip come the end of the semester. Yay! :D  Into a Unibroue tulip this one goes. Nice & slow. The beer oozes out & collects quietly with just a whimper of activity right around the edge of the glass. A second pour to top it off yields a mushy bowl of Coco Crisps, but it doesn't last long. Black & boring, with hints of amber right at the rim.  Big eye-watering scents of charcoal, liquorice, cocoa powder, caramelized onions, teriyaki & bbq sauces. Your can almost smell some crispy pork fat sizzling somewhere in there too. The alcohol hides behind everything, but doesn't come at you raw. The fumes though, however salivating, give me quite a headache.  Moving on...  Heavy espresso flavor, charred marshmallows, bitter chocolate, wood, tobacco smoke, & hard on with the whiskey & leather shoes. Oh man, I can't do, I just can't. I'm such a puss. ... The body is completely flat & feels like light cream going down(& I can dig that). The whiskey, the wood, & the intense tannins just kill me though. Close to four ounces in & I need some air in the worst way. I have such a headache.  However good, however bad, it's just too much for a twelve ounce serving. The flavors are there, but the barrel flavors are just so concentrated & overdone, that it's way too much for me to sincerely enjoy. Maybe if it came in a two ounce nip aged half as long? Maybe some soft serve on the side?  This review took almost an hour in the making, & boy did I try. Quarter ounce sip after half lung whiff, I tried. It made me realize just how insane some of you out there really are. :P",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I've taken a tip from Adam Avery (not directly), and that is to drink a beer at all temperatures...colder than suggested through warmer than suggested.

Smell is lots of vanilla and oak, a little bourbon, complex and yet crisp at the same time.  Taste is big bourbon, vanilla and oak, with a huge alcohol kick. Definitely more bourbon than stout.  Mouthfeel is good, super slick with pleasant carbonation.  Drinkability is poor, the alcohol is just gigantic.  Overall, a good beer with serious attitude.

1549,10672,adriatic502,4.77,"2006 Bottle.  Appearance: Opaque mahogany with no head when poured into a Chimay chalice  Smell: From the moment the seal on the cap was broken, a bourbon aroma was dominant; gradually the complex flavor profile of vanilla, chocolate, and a hint of cherry became apparent.  Taste: Smokey with vanilla, chocolate, and a bit of cherry... the bourbon flavor is strong - more so than any other bourbon stout I've tried... and I like it. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, excellent.  Drinkability: An extremely good way to kick off an evening, but a little too thick and strong to repeat in one sitting. Like a steak, you can only enjoy one at a time.  Overall: An excellent beer.

1549,10672,SQNfan,4.3,"Opaque black in color. The nose shows off the bourbon followed by some dark chocolate, coffee and wood. In the mouth it is rich and dense continuing the flavors from the nose, thus the bourbon again shows itself as prominent.

1549,10672,ebit,3.95,"Appearance 1 finger deep chocolate tan head on about as agressive of a pour as I could manage (swirling included). Head left earlier than I wanted but with 13% abv it's about what I'd expect. Black body, no light shining through this sucker.  Smell Bourbon alcohol is highly prominent, especially when agitated. When the beer settled a bit more I got dark chocolate malts, dark cherries, raisins, and a bit of deep roasted grains swirl underneath the bourbon charge. In short, if you like bourbon aged beers this smells like heaven to you.  Taste Complexity is there before the bourbon blasts everything out of the water. The bottle says ""one has more flavor than your average case of beer"". I find this assessment accurate. Upfront I get smooth vanilla with a bit of coffee mixed in, both playing over a bed of this oaky roast flavor Enter bourbon that DOMINATES until it fades to pureed cherries and with slight notes of raisin. Bourbon checks back in for the finish with maybe a bit of hoppiness. A fun ride for the palate.  Mouthfeel Pours thick and the body doesn't disappoint. About as heavy as they come with a bunch of carbonation to cut through it all.  Drinkability/Overall Impression This beer is way too big for more than one on any occasion. Your tastebuds would retreat into your tongue and your stomach will churn in protest. The one you have will be thoroughly enjoyable if you really take the time to break down the beer, but God help those that try to session this.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Graham21,4.75,"This is definitely one of my favorites. Makes motor oil look white. Pour hard for good head, but dont expect it to hang around. The nose is wonderful, lots of bourbon, cinnamony alchol notes. Also, raisiny, coffee, and vanilla notes released. At first flavors seem strong and over powering but after a few sips you can really enjoy this. Burnt malts, espresso,black licorice, vanilla beans, nuts, bitter chocolate, lots of bourbon, brown sugar and alcohol. This beer is thick and full bodied and is a great sipper.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,sholland119,4.38,"Obtained as a great surprise extra from a trade with kirok1999. Thanks again!  Poured from the bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter.  A-Pours a deep rich jet black with a nice quarter inch brown head which quickly dissipates leaving a thin ring around the edges of the glass.  S-Lots of the bourbon scent comes through, along with vanilla and a hint of chocolate. A little strong on the alochol but still very inviting.  T-Wonderful bourbon sweetness up front with chocolate and caramel following on. Moderately strong alcohol warmth in the finish.  M-Nice and smooth and a little oily on the tongue. The alcohol lingers.  D-I could drink these all night until I passed out. Despite the noticeable alcohol presence this is a very drinkable beer.  In a blind stout taste test with KBS, both my wife and I preferred the Founders brew. But both are outstanding. The KBS has a little less alcohol and a little more malt that puts it over the top. But if that's #1, this is a very close #1A.  HV",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MICAMD,4.21,"2007 Bottling.  A- Black as they come. When held to a light, and with some effort, some light can be seen through the edges. The head is small and brown and settles to some swirls on the top. This is a mean looking beer.  S- Lots of vanilla and bourbon with hints of chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. This smells like a beast.  T- There is a lot of bourbon flavors in here, but it is not overpowering. Pretty complex and things blend well. I can appreciate the effort, but there is just not something special that blows my mind.  M- A lot smoother than I was anticipating, considering the alcohol content.  D- For the alcohol content this is remarkably drinkable. Not outrageously rich, but makes for a good night cap after a long day.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,prototypic,4.47,"BuckeyeNation, many thanks.  2007 Release  Appearance: It's nearly charcoal black in color. No light getting through, even at the edges. Head was only about a finger deep and is a chocolate, mocha-like color. It didn't stick around too long and only left a light, sticky coat of lace lining the glass.  Smell: Whoa. Bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon. This is certainly a distinct aroma. I can't say that I've ever smelled a beer quite like it. Obviously the bourbon scent is strong and overwhelming. It's certainly inviting. There are plenty of roasted and chocolate malts present in addition to very light dark fruit (plum and raisin) aromas. Molasses and vanilla emerge if you stick with it. This is a complex and fine smelling beer. Personally, the bourbon smell is a touch too strong. If it were balanced a little better, a ""5"" would be warranted.  Taste: Not surprisingly, the bourbon flavor comes on strong and fast. It's certainly the primary feature of the beer whereas the stout element is a little more subdued. It's an excellent flavor. But, I'd prefer the stout component to be the focal point. It's a small gripe. Chocolate and roasted malt flavors blend extremely well. Slight smoky taste is a bonus. Secondary dark fruit, vanilla, and molasses flavors really thrust the flavor into the complex stratosphere. Alcohol has a warming effect and is ever so slightly noticeable.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thick, but extremely smooth. It doesn't feel heavy at all. Carbonation is light, but it works wonderfully. Despite its 13% abv, its drinkability is phenomenal. I only wish I had more. Perhaps its a good thing I don't. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I wish I saw it frequently. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it in Ohio at all. Perhaps someday we'll overcome that statutory cap issue.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Hojaminbag,4.5,"Got this as a throw in with a trade with Vancer, and I am seriously excited.  Poured into chalice as the bottle suggests. Pitch black or very dark brown, completely opaque. Small brown head.  Strong aromas or malts, chocolate, coffee. I notice alcohol in the background too.  Sweet maltiness is right up front, very sweet. Chocolate, coffee, and carmel notes follow. Finishes with a good dose of alcohol warming. Tons of bourbon flavor in there, excellent for bourbon barrel-aged fans. Notes of vanilla and spicy oak are also in there too. One of the first and one of the best barrel-aged RISs I have run into.  A good full bodied brew with low-moderate carbonation, good fullness for a stout.  Considering the thickness and high ABV, this is a very drinkable beer.  Solid brew overall, very glad I got the chance to try this.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DrDogbeer,4.44,"Thanks to Tytoanderso for this amazing beer!! Poured into a chimay goblet. Pitch Dark black color with virtually no head. First smell- bourbon! Nothing else. Then second smell- Vanilla. Next, some chocolate. It keeps changing after every sip!! Taste is so amazing!- Tastes of burnt malts, with some chocolate and coffee hints, but always finished up with a oaky bourbon kick. Still have it in my mouth after 20 minutes! Slick mouthfeel, but really pretty drinkable considering 13%!! Really want more!! Hook me up!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Poured obsidian black with zero light penetration. No head to mention, but a thin tan ring around the perimeter of the bowl and some isolated spots of foam in the center. Lacing consisted of a khaki-colored band around the circumference of the glass that was revealed at each sip. Boozy nose, predominantly bourbon and oak with a very sweet backbone. Taste similar to nose; however flavors of vanilla and molasses reveal themselves in the mouth. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and silky without being overly viscous. Some carbonation tingle present across the tongue, but just enough to add a little liveliness to the texture. This is a brew to be savored and sipped and would definitely compliment a fine cigar.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SkinnyElvis,4.4,Cheers to Tiley4 for this fine beer: 2007 bottle. Pours with no head. Black as my heart after watching the Phillies lose to the Mets in 12. Smells very sweet thanks to the bourbon. The taste is a mix of chocolate & the bourbon's sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth but you can't avoid the ABV. A truly great beer worthy of seeking. I may try to find some to ship home from DLD.  Cheers.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

M-almost no carbonation with kind of a weak mouthfeel for a stout.  D-I could see myself drinking this beer on the coldest night of the year. I have had better 13% stouts in my day, overall I didn't feel like this beer lived up to the hype surrounding it. I tried to let it warm up because I believe a good stout tasted better warm...but alas I did not feel this way about this beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,drumrboy22,4.32,"Thanks to EliteDigger for this one. Pours a deep, dark black with a very small, dark brown head. Little to no carbonation and no lacing.  Aroma was alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and malt.  Taste was bittersweet chocolate, bourbon, molasses and vanilla. Very complex and flavors are more apparent as it warms.  Very thick and syrupy. A really fantastic beer. This would make for a really nice sipper on a cold, winter night.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smells fairly strongly of bourbon, good malt and alcohol (not surprising at 13%).  Tastes of bourbon, lots of rich malt followed by licorice, burnt espresso and finishes with alcohol.  Excellent mouthfeel. Very smooth and thick.  This is definitely a sipper. I might have to drink it slowly but I could enjoy this extreme version of stout deep into an evening.  Extremely good balance between the bourbon, viscosity and alcohol.  This is a great after dinner stout to have with a $20 Havana Cohiba! I loved the way it felt in my mouth.

I detected the bourbon and dark chocolate right away. Malty and toasty and boozy and bready, i can also taste caramels, creams, nuts but this is a big boozy beer that is strong on the finish, maybe a bit hot - wonder what another 6 months would do to this.  Definitely drink this slowly and enjoy it because as good as it is, it's a sipping beer and not for sessions either.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T: Sweet, syrupy chocolate and vanilla up front. Warming, smooth alcohol taste...Then, some black licorice. Or is it bourbon?  M: Velvety-smooth and then, surprisingly, enough carbonation to carry the sweetness along to the finish.  D: I Practiced delayed gratification and found it to be a necessary virtue with this one. It took two hours and the last sip was the best.  An all-out assault of your senses. An adventure for those with insatiable beer desires.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Smells of carmel, bourbon, licorice, coffee, and dark chocolate and the flavor is just what the aroma promises. Not a lot of roasted flavor, but that's OK. Similar to Yeti, Bell's, and Abyss, except it has a bit more of a sweeter flavor than any of those, and lacks the roasted flavor of Abyss. Overall, a great blend of flavors. The taste got better as it warmed up, and while I didn't taste a lot of alcohol, I certainly felt it. It's so thick and intense that I don't know that I'd want more than one at a time, but as stouts go, this is a very fine one.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,Risser09,4.78,"12 oz bottled poured into a snifter - 2007 bottling - Cellar temp  Appearance: Pours a very pitch black color with a brown head that is only a quarter inch high. It shows no sign of head retention. In fact, the head quickly disappears and doesn't leave anything on the glass or on the miniscus.  Smell: Intense. Dark chocolate, graham cracker, biscotti, creme brulee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon and booze. Deep malt overtones. Toasted oak and heavy alcohol.  Taste: Another intense experience. Mostly the same as the aroma. Dark chocolate, heavy vanilla, bourbon liquor. Caramelized sugars, licorice and a lot of boozy alcohol. My favorite part of this beer is the strong graham cracker flavor which makes this beer unique over so many other RIS contenders. It then fades to let the booze take over the finish. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel: Extremely chewy and pretty thick. Enough sugar to be palatable and enough booze to knock your socks off. Definitely a warming beer from the mouth to the belly. Alcohol is certainly pronounced.  Drinkability: This is a great beer, pure and simple. I cannot think of a better beer to enjoy in the depths of winter than this one. The complexity would be hard to rival. The bourbon flavors are strong and compliment the beer nicely and aren't annoyingly cloying. If the appearance (head,retention,lace) were better this would be near perfection. One would assume that this is hard to accompish with a beer soaked with bourbon.

A wonderful smokey oak flavor with vanilla, chocolate and dark fruits again. Plenty of warming alcohol as well. M/D: Extremley rich and creamy. This just feels great in the mouth. There is lots of alcohol and bourbon flavor, so that might detract from the drinkability for some. Though, I love it. A sipping beer through and through.  I shared a bottle with a friend one night.

Sickly putrid black. impenetrable when held up to blistering sun. I love it! The nose reeks of bourbon and wood with some alcohol in it as well. Taste is balls out malty with strong bourbon and oak. Roasted toasted oak and vanilla. Some blackness that is unexplainable rises out of this muk. Some sort of caramello or Rolo type of aftertaste while the alcoholic heat travels down the esophagus. Hop bitterness takes a back seat here, this one is all about the black sick disturbed malts. Mouthfeel is super thick and chewy which I love in an impy stout. Drinkability is good, but lacking a bit at the moment as this 2007 vintage is still a bit hot. I think these marks will go up in a year or so. Overall this is a very impressive brew.

The aroma was exceptionally potent. Boozy, bourbon-like and oaky with ridiculous amounts of malts, brown sugar and vanilla notes. The bourbon was really over the top in this brew (in a good way). Dark chocolate was noticeable as well.  The taste was deep and dark and far more roasty than the nose. Rich, smooth, oaky and somewhat smoky. Charred oak, dark roasted coffee and bakers chocolate came through strong. Raisins and stone fruiits were also apparent. Slightly acrid with mild oxidative notes. Subtle minty hops appeared mid-palate and carried into the somewhat dry and woody finish. The aftertaste was moderately roasty and slightly sweet. As the beer warmed, the boozy alcohol really made its presence known, turning hot on the swallow.  Mouthfeel was extremely heavy and viscous. Slick, chewy and thick to the extreme.

Smell - Over-the-top bourbon with traces of dark fruit, molasses and chocolate. Alcohol is plainly noticeable but entirely appropriate and even enjoyable.  Taste - Bourbon makes itself known immediately, though it's nicely blended with flavors of vanilla, raisins, dark chocolate and molasses. Intensely rich and flavorful. Bourbon lingers on in the finish, with a hot, warming quality in the swallow.  Mouthfeel - Thick, syrupy and coating. Moderate carbonation; more than I was expecting from a barrel-aged beer.

1549,10672,Gehrig,4.94,"Having seen this lingering around the excellent local Piccadilly for some time, I finally caved and picked up one of these in a mixed sixer. Foolish me, since I'll have to head back and grab some more of this positively incredible, unique, sturdy imperial stout.  A smattering of dark mocha-cherry head tops this blacker than black body. I had thought that Gonzo Imperial Porter and Yeti may be the blackest beers I'd had in some time. Bourbon County might top those, which is really saying something. The smell is so amazing it's difficult to describe the depth and complexity. There's no mistaking the bourbon, and the idea to soak this gem of a stout in bourbon barrels was nothing short of genius. Bourbon permeates this beauty from start to finish, yet there so much more--chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee--it's truly amazing.  Same goes with the flavor. Clearly, bourbon is preeminent, which might weigh too heavily for people sheepish about bourbon, and thankfully I am not one of those people. However, the deep complexity of this presents enough for any beer lover to ponder. Chocolate, butterscotch, vanilla, caramel all noticeable and extremely delicious. The malts in this are phenomenal.  Equally so, the texture is ridiculously rich. Though not heavily carbonated, the flavors interact ingeniously with each other in a beer that doesn't flatten. Though the ABV is very high (11%), this is an easy sipper and one you'd like to follow with another. Every delectable sip is a dip into one of the best beers around, bar none.  A masterpiece.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,goschool,4.5,"2006 Vintage  Appearance: The pour is black as crude. One of the darkest colored heads I've ever seen pops up for a brief instance, before rescinding to a thin ring around the edge of the glass.  Smell: The nose is loaded with roasted barley, dark chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, and bourbon.  Taste: The flavor profile is explosive. Dark chocolate, bourbon, toffee, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses leads into a burst of coconut, blackberry, anise, and semi-sweet chocolate, with espresso and another shot of bourbon at the finish.  Mouthfeel: It's super thick and oily with plenty of carbonation.  Drinkability: This is a lovely huge, complex stout and it's best suited for sipping over a long period of time.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,dkoehler42,3.83,"This beer does not lie when it tells you ""One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer."" My initial taste was of shock and distaste. However, the aftertaste is smooth and very nice. It pours a very dark color, which allows for no light to pass through. There is little to no head, and I potent smell, indicating this is not going to be a light beer. The initial taste is overpowering, and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. It has a nice smooth mouthfeel to it though, and the aftertaste is nice and sweet. I might put one of these away and let it age longer, as it's only a 2007 batch.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Vixie,4.7,"I'm writing this review after having sampled the second bottle of this, the first I had was a bit warmer, it hadn't had time to fully chill, the second is fully chilled. The big difference in the temp seems to affect the head, the warmer beer poured with a creamy head that didn't last long, the colder one had nearly no head, with just some light bubbling on it. The color was nearly pitch black, as dark as I've ever seen from any beer.  The smell of this is very powerful, I was telling people at work you know you have a good beer when the smell gives you a buzz! It's fairly complex, with a lot of vanilla noticeable, plus sweetness from the malt, I'd say a touch of caramel with almost a bit of apple thrown in. The alcohol is noticeable as well.  The taste starts a bit sweet, with definite chocolate and coffee notes. It has a bite to it, I'm guessing that is due to the bourbon aging, I am not familiar with the taste of bourbon, so can't quite place it, but that is most likely what it is. I didn't notice the smoky flavor at first, but it became more pronounced as I drank more. Also vanilla is fairly prominent.  Mouthfeel is very good, nice and thick to let you know this is a serious beer. It has a nice warm feeling going down, with a nice blending of flavors.  Overall this is one of the more unique beers I've tried, nothing I've had before really reminds me of it. Very much a reward beer, don't waste this for day to day drinking, enjoy it when you want to treat yourself. It's a bit too strong to have more than one or two at a time, but you'll enjoy the time spent with this one.  2007 bottle",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,cokes,5,"2006 release. A little over a year in the cellar.  I loved this thing from the get-go. It pours like a malfunctioning printer spewing ink. Jet black. The type of shit you don't want to get on your clothes....at least your nice stuff. The head is more a slumped shoulder of dark tan, as there is no chance for it to gather the vigor to rise very far above the molten body. Now is where it truly gets special. A literal stampede up the nose. Coffee, fudge, Bourbon (the good stuff too, and high proof, like Wild Turkey Rare Breed, or George T. Stagg), after those three mainstays, its a kaleidoscopic array of fallout from berries (rasp- and blue-, and black-), black cherries, soy sauce, salt, barbecued beef fat, plum, and Pinot Noir. It marinades the mouth with a briny coffee fudge Bourbon bombshell. It's like espresso mixed with soy sauce, tootsie rolls, barrel-proof Bourbon, prune juice, whole cherries, oak-barreled red wine, leather, and dried pine puree. And those are not suggestions, each one shows up exponentially on any given sip. Give it concentration, and it will morph into any of them and back again. And that doesn't even touch on it's subtleties, which are too numerous to note, but burnt coconut, over-proof rum (a la boozy dark sugar), bbq beef, hot peppers, hazelnuts, cigar ash, and tar are all featured in bit roles. And yet the surface has merely been superficially scratched. It's a thick, mouth-brutalizing, basically uncarbonated sludge. It's the closest American example to something like the polarizing Le Coq. Love it or hate it, it's thick, intense, and uncompromising. I happen to love it. It's drinkable only in that a glass will joyfully last the better part of an evening. And another glass will make the next evening every bit as enjoyable. Haters will say that this is more marinade than beer. I'll say that they are right on, and I'd love to baste my head in this stuff as frequently as possible. This scores as an experience. Buy a case, even at $5 a bottle, and it will last you indefinitely, as long as you want, or at least as long as you can ration out your hedonism. As a stout, as a barrel-aged beer, or as something to remember and savor those special occasions with, this is tops, and without a close peer. It is in every way phenominal.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

The taste is simply outstanding. Perfect bitterness to complement the coffee, bourbon, and dark chocolate flavors. So smooth...the time in the cellar has done this beer well, very well. There is a hint of vanilla and caramel in here, too. Simply delicious.  This one is very full bodied. Thick, smooth, and extremely enjoyable at this point in time.

1549,10672,aerozeppl,4.63,Split a 12oz bottle.  A: Possibly the blackest beer I have ever seen. Some tan mocha head.  S: Bourbon. Then stout. The alcohol smell from the bourbon dominates. There is a slight hint of roast in the background.  T:Bourbon up front. Almost feels like bourbon. The taste after that are incredible. Brown sugar comes first. Then a subtle malt sweetness. This is then followed by a rush of espresso then coffee bringing some bitterness. After that it goes into super dark chocolate. This is the best and most unexpected aftertaste in a beer ever.  M: Super thick. It felt like it was coating my soul.  D:Definitely a sipper. The first few sips you feel like you are enjoying a glass of bourbon. Really weird. It actually became more drinkable as it warmed up. This is an amazing beer.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mwilbur,4.9,"2006. Chalice. Pours black as a starless night. Thin dark carmel head. Less carbonation with aging. Bourbon tone is clearly apparent and is accentuated by the high ABV. Also coming through are notes of charred oak, dark chocolate, molasses, and a hint of raisin. Smell is equally complex...it alone draws you in. A truly amazing beer...the only drawback being it's lack of sessionability. My favorite winter beer to sip and contemplate as the snow is falling.  2/4/10 update: Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. 2006 vintage. A: Pours super dark black--no light comes through with backlighting. Essentially no head. Quiet and strong...almost intimidating in appearance. S: Sweet bourbon, charred oak, molasses, and dark dried fruit (especially raisin). T: Mirrors aroma perfectly with the addition of the alcohol bite. Despite the ABV, the alcohol doesn't dominate here but instead is balanced well with the rest of the brew. Dark chocolate and vanilla come through with warming. M: Heavy, smooth, and slightly oily. Mild alcohol burn. Taste lingers nicely, slowly fading. Sticky sweet. Wonderful. D: A nearly perfect beer in my estimation...kudos to Goose Island! My only knock is that I just simply can't give this one--with an ABV of 13%--a 5 on drinkability. In comparison with the original review, I must say this has lost a half step with aging. If you have any 2005 or 2006 left at this point, drink them up!  12/29/14: 2006 vintage into snifter. A: Pours thick and black as motor oil. No head; no carbonation. (4) S: Boozy bourbon, dark sweet chocolate, dark tobacco, leather, and a hint of brown sugar and cream. Still potent here. (4.5) T: Several off flavors here...definitely past peak (3). M: Smooth and viscous. Moderately heavy body. Darkly sweet. (4) D: Some aspects still going strong...especially the aroma. But overall this one is over the hill.

A: Pours thick and black as motoroil. Just a whiff of dark mocha head. (4) S: Sweet bourbon, charred wood, dark tobacco, old leather, and dark chocolate. (4.25) T: Darkly sweet bourbon, dark chocolate, dates and other dark dried fruit, oaky vanilla, and mild dark tobacco. Lost a half-step, but still solid. (4) M: Heavy body. Darkly sweet. Slightly oily feel. Only mild alcohol burn (age has definitely subdued this). Decent lingering on palate. (3.75) D: This is actually still doing well even though this is 6 1/3 yrs old. (4)  1/25/15: 2009 vintage poured into snifter. Bottle on 1/14/10. A: Pours an extremely dark black-brown. Doesn't seem quite as thick as prior vintages. No head. Very faint sticky lacing. (4) S: Can smell the sweet bourbon booziness from a foot away. Dark chocolate, charred wood, dark tobacco, oaky vanilla, and a hint of leather. (4.25) T: Bourbon soaked raisins, cinnamon, dark tobacco, bittersweet chocolate, oaky vanilla, and a hint of charred wood (not quite as heavy/dark as the aroma was suggesting). (4.5) M: Heavy body. Moderate bourbon booze bite (softened a bit with age). Sticky sweet feel. Lingers nicely on the palate with a small amount of maturing too (again, can tell this one is a bit past prime). (4.25) D: I'm drinking this one less than 2 weeks beyond the 5 year max shelf time recommended on the bottle. I would agree. You can tell it is starting to fade, but still is hanging on to much of the glory this brew has at its core. (4.25)  1/26/15: 2010 vintage into snifter. Bottled on 5/10 1405. A: Pours extremely dark brown-black with just a skiff of super dark mocha head that recedes fairly quickly. (4.25) S: Dark chocolate, charred wood, oaky vanilla, sweet bourbon, burnt brown sugar, and a hint of cola. (4.25) T: Smooth dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, oaky vanilla, dark tobacco, leather, dark dried fruit, cinnamon and brown sugar, and charred wood. Very, very nice! (4.75) M: Medium-heavy body (seems lighter than past vintages). Velvety smooth. Darkly sweet with a moderate boozy bourbon bite (you can tell this one has aged, but is now nicely settled down). Lingers and matures nicely on the palate. (4.5) D: Tasting the various vintages recently, I can appreciate the various stages this beer goes through. This one really shines with the taste and mouthfeel and is only a step or two off in the appearance and smell when compared with a younger vintage. (4.5)  3/20/16: 2008 vintage into snifter.

A: Pours a motor oil black, with a small thin tan head, which surprisingly stays around for a long time, though it looks kind of flat on the first pour.  S: Smells like a shot of whiskey, without all the heavy alcohol, you get the richness of the wood odour and the vanilla.  T: Heavy bourbon on the first sip, probably the most bourbon dominated strong stout I have ever had, much more than Firestone 11 or Angel's Share. Vanilla bean, caramel, molasses there as well. Some coffee and roasted malt flavours too, but they are light compared with the whiskey which dominates the flavour.  M: Endlessly smooth and rich, not cloying at all in its sweetness, one of the most full-bodied beers ever.  D: A fantastic brewing and aging accomplishment, very tasty stuff, but it's definitely a sipper, a beer you should take your time with to fully enjoy.  Edit - Having an '08 on 2/13/10, the flavour is just nuts. Huge whiskey/vanilla, dark roasted malts with an elegant alcoholic, but not boozy mouthfeel. Editing taste from a 4.5 to a 5.

It literally almost makes you sit down and enjoy the beer that you are drinking. After the beer sits in the mouth for a bit it becomes a bit more mellow and has less viscosity. The MF is rather fitting for the beer itself.  D - a great beer by GI and one that I would pick up again for sure despite the 20 bucks a 4 pack price tag.

1549,10672,SMark,4.45,"This was poured into a large wine glass at 52° from a 12 ounce bottle with a bottled on this date on the back label. The label also recommended a broad mouth glass. The beer was deep dark brown in color with a slight tan head. There was minimal lacing.  The bouquet wafted from the very first pour. Oak and a liqueur scent were very much in evidence. Dark roasted malts were inviting the first sip. Indications were that this was going to take some work.  There was a slight carbonation and then burning sensation on the tongue. Dark roasted coffee and malt were tasted in the upper part of the mouth. This was taking a concentrated effort to evaluate.  This beer almost overwhelms the mouth. There is a lot going on here with the oak, alcohol, malts, and other little flavors and liqueur aromatics that linger on and on. The beer feels even better as it picks up warmth delivering a very comfortable effort.  The beer is a keeper. Label on this 2007 says the flavor will continue to develop over five years. Not sure I will keep that long but will let them age for some time. This is neither a session beer nor one to be imbibed, pounded or whatever terms are used for dispensing quickly.

M - Thick and creamy with a good level of carbonation, alcohol is ""felt"" at some times.  D - This is THE bourbon aged stout and should be experienced by all. Good night!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Tilley4,4.28,"Bottle courtesy of Gregis.  Jet black motor oil pour with absolutely no head of any kind. Looks like a glass full of motor oil.  Strong aroma of bourbon here. Almost overpowering anything else in the beer. There are some roasted malts lingering faintly in the background, but this smells like good ol' Kentucky bourbon.  Unbelievably smooth taste to this beer. I was expecting a huge bourbon burn to this one and while you can taste the bourbon very prevalently, it's as smooth as a baby's behind. Definite notes of chocolate and roasted malt behind the oaky bourbon taste. There is bit of a burn going down but it's not at all unpleasant or overpowering and only adds to the ambience of this brew.  What a treat this one is. It is a definite sipper and I don't know that I could drink more than one but I don't know that I would want to either. One is plenty with the ABV in this. Got another bottle left and I'm going to age it for a while and note the differences. Awesome beer here...",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TheodorHerzl,4.77,"Pours an opaque black with no highlights around the edges. A small swirl of mocha colored head dissipated right before my eyes immediately after the pour, and it left minimal lacing on the walls of my glass. I can smell this as I pour it. My first smell is bourbon and charred wood. I also get huge scents of roasted barley, burnt caramel, and sweet vanilla. Glorious! I could keep my nose in this beer for another hour, but I can't wait to taste this beer. The flavor profile on this beer is so amazingly complex. The bourbon flavor on this beer is in no way harsh. It is as smooth as some of the finer triple distilled Irish whiskeys, but with the bolder American bourbon flavor. Dark cherries and rum soaked plums mingle with chocolate, sorghum, and bitter coffee. All of the flavors coexist extremely well and no one flavor dominates any other. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but there is a good shot of warming alcohol on the mouth as well. The ABV is a high on this, so the drinkability is more of a sipper and would be most enjoyed in moderation.  Fantastic beer here.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Mudpuppet,3.61,"Thanks to Jw347 for the chance to try this.  A- Pours pitch black like motor oil from a 12oz 2007 bottle into my Riedel Snifter. Pours with no head.  S- Bourbon definitely. I also get a woody after-nose (is that a word?). Not very complex but a lot of boubon and old wet wood.  T- Bourbon on the start followed by dark malts and chocolate, toffee and vanilla. A definite alcohol in the aftertaste. Not quite as complex as I was hoping for. Certainly a good stout but I think it may almost be better without the bourbon barrel aging.  M- Good carbonation. It is also a very think viscous brew.  D- I like this beer. I am not sure it is my top 10 stouts but it is decent overall. I would be interested to try more beers from this brewery. Holding on to my other bottle for a few years to see how it ages. I imagine it will be much more interesting.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DIM,4.97,"note: I had the 2006 version.  a: This beer is pitch black. It Pours with a medium tan head that fades fairly quickly.  s: An incredible balance is struck here. Elements of whiskey, wood, and vanilla are, of course, very pronounced. Yet somehow, a very noticeable roasty dark chocolate aroma was also present.  t: I simply don't have the superlatives. This lives up to the hype and then some. The barrel aging provides a nice blanket of booze, vanilla, and oak, that does not overwhelm one of the chocolatiest stouts I've ever had.  m: Thick and oily body on this one. The carbonation reminds me a bit of a Belgian brew, the way it seems to expand to fill your mouth.  d: This is as close to perfection as I've ever found in a beer.

1549,10672,BeerLover729,3.9,"A: Thick, opaque, black beer with small but notable toasty tan head.  S: Woody oak aroma with minimal presence of tannins, vanilla, caramel, and alcohol are all pronounced smells.  T: Creamy, sweet, richly malty beer with subdued, but ever present, bourbon/oak flavors. Tannins are present but not sharp and seem to blend into a tobacco flavor. Alcohol present but not overpowering.  M: Silky smooth syrup. Texturally similar to chocolate mousse. Amazingly creamy heavy body with soft but present carbonation that brings out a nice sweetness when you hold on your tongue.  D: This is a sipping beer for sure and at damn near $25 a four pack you really gotta savor each sip. Based on this, it is hard to gauge this category. I drank this beer slower than almost any other 12oz beer I have had in a while and even for 13% abv (thats what my bottle says) the boozeyness seems to stand out because of the bourbon flavors more than some other high alcohol beers.  Notes: Again this is a serious sipping beer. With that in mind though, this beer is wonderfully complex. Mine was born on 10/11/07 and I am drinking it on 1/16/08. I must admit sweet stouts are not really my style but the body of this beer is amazing, the flavors are intriguing and overall this is a damn good beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

T: A outstanding mix of carmel and chocolate togethor With a cream in the middle. A nice bourbon is present through out, but not over powering. Mild black coffee beans on the back. M: The mouth feel might be the best part of this beer. It is just a rich awesome creaminess that totally fills your mouth with a big and warm feeling. D:AWESOME!!!!

1549,10672,hwwty4,4.74,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Pour is jet black, as in I've never seen a beer this black. It lets no light through no matter what angle you hold the glass at. The aggressive pour left little head that disappeared quickly, but left nice little rings around the glass after every sip. This beer is making me interested already. Aroma is a myriad of smells. Definite whiffs of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, toffee and roasted almonds. But there are also dark fruits, raisins and figs finishing with a flash of booze. Really complex...still holding my attention. Taste is what espresso smells like, not like it actually tastes. Definitely vanilla, dark chocolate and roasted almonds. The one thing it reminds me of heavily is of a waffle cone, the kind you get at Baskin Robbins. You take that waffle cone and douse it in dark chocolate and vanilla and drizzle some Makers Mark on top of it, well there ya go. Mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation. The oily nature of the beer sticks with you making it linger in you mouth. The only points I can take off is the fact I could only drink about 1 a week. Way to rich to make it into my normal rotation.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

S - bourbon smell with some roasted malt and vanilla aromas as well.  T - rich roasted flavor of dark chocolate, coffee beans and vanilla extract with the tatse of bourbon kicking up the back end. Extremely complex and mind blowing flavor for a stout. 45-50 degrees is where best flavor is achieved.  M - full bodied with a silky smooth feel.  D - sip and enjoy.

This was our end of the evening beer, but it still nearly took our heads off! Huge, big beer-maybe the most intense beer of any kind that I have ever had. It makes the KBS taste like an iced coffee. Pours big, utterly black, and incredibly viscous with little head. Wow. The aromas are incredible! Starts with a big hit of Bourbon folowed immediately by licorice pastilles, then fades a bit to developfurther aromas of coconu, oak, vanilla, a finer Bourbon purity, dark fruit, and a ton of chocolate. After it breathes for a while it becomes even more licoricy. Taste is equally as incredible. Very powerful, but also amazingly integrated. Licorice up front, then vanilla, chocolate,and a long Bourbon finish. Huge and delicious. Mouthfeel is huge and very smooth and creamy. Very much a sipper,but so, so impressive. It's worth the money.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,elmore,4.92,"A 2007 vintage. Picked this up at Sudyks in MN on a recent trip home. Poured this magnificent pitch black, 10W40 into a snifter. A half finger mocha head. Not much retention, but who cares - this is a serious beer - the label reads 13% ABV. The highest ABV I have had yet.  WOW!!! The strong bourbon nose just gave me the ""he-bitch man slap"". I don't want to drink this it smells so good: burnt oak, Woodford Creek, sweet burnt malt, coffee, unsweetened dark chocolate. This is complex.  I'm 2/3 of the way through this beer and I'm buzzed. Creamy, chewy mouthfeel with low to moderate carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV.  A wonderfully unique beer. I'm going to age a few bottles of this to see how it turns out. Although it is fantastic when it is young. If you like extreme, complex beers, try this beer and you won't be disappointed. If you like bourbon also, this will blow your mind!! I can't beleive a place that is associated with AB would make such a wonderful concoction - thanks.  Cheers!!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste: Bourbon, bourbon, bourbon, and then some coffee, and slight roasted flavor. the bourbon is up front with the coffee bitterness coming after swallowing. Very warming.  Mouthfeel is just okay, really hard to judge as this is definitely a sipper brew for me.  The abv is too high for drinkability to be too high, and this must be sipped as it is strong and powerful. A beer to nurse that gets better as it warms.

After the intial blast, there is very pleasent notes of vanilla, raisins, and some malt. This is impressive.  There is no doubt that the bourbon flavors are present, but it is very smooth. Alcohol is present without the obnoixous burn. Ends with a dark chocolate and coffee aftertaste. This is very smooth and enjoyable.  Feels thick like a imp stout should.

Maybe the slightest bit of bubbling around the edges. I hope it didn't go flat.  Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expected from the reviews. It's not thin, by any means, but this doesn't measure up to some of the true thick beasts out there. Smells like Bourbon and coffee. Having had quite a few bourbon based beera lately, I'm hoping that this isn't going to be a bourbon overload.  Taste is more nuanced than the smell. The bourbon is prevalent, but there are some nice sweet chocolate notes, some not-so-bitter coffee notes, and a bit of sweet fruit(?). Beer became better as it warmed, with even more balancing sweetness and vanilla becoming apparent.  Rich, gut-punchingly strong and flavorful, and super bourbon-ed.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bitterbill,5,"I got this bottle in a trade with Hoppymeal. Thanks Derek!  The only other GI brew that I've had was the Imperial Stout and that one was delicious. Here goes:  It pours from 12oz bottle(2007) a very thickish looking pitch black with a small, rapidly receding head of tannish foam but there's some good lacing to be found here.  The smell...well, it hit my nose buds as soon as I popped the cap. All sorts of things going on here. Dark fruit, caramel malt, chocolate, vanilla, and, what about that rambunctious nose of bourbon??  The taste is both outrageously tasty but also smooth. Big bourbon notes along with raisins, vanilla, chocolate, a really nice bitter chocolate flavour that adds a nice balance to the sweetness...wow!  The mouthfeel is so thick and chewy and it finishes with that bitter chocolate and a good kick of that bourbon. Man. This is some crazy shit and I'm loving it. The abv is slightly noticeable during the swallow and a little more noticeable after the swallow but heck, I still find it very drinkable. I suspect that some aging would make it even more drinkable but I just couldn't wait. ;^) I can see why so many BAs rate this one so highly, like it's special. It truly is. As a caveat, I'm *not* a Bourbon fancier so my loving BCS is all the more impressive.

1549,10672,SammyDavisJrJrJr,4.27,"This review is on a bottle from the 2007 vintage, will be fun to see the difference with age.  A - ""Looks like motor oil"" my wife's uncle said... Looks great to me.  S - Loads of chocolate, sweet, but not cloying. The alcohol was quite present. Vanilla, wood, and a ton of smoke all played roles in the aroma. Very good.  T - Starts out quite fruity, sweet and tart with heavy notes of strawberries. Chocolate seems to be hiding underneath the strawberry profile. Starts to dry out right before the swallow, with lots of alcohol and wonderful smoke hitting my palate, making the sensation very (too?) intense. Aging this one helps a lot.  M - The body seems quite good on this beer, but again, the alcohol seems to burn so much it takes away from the experience.  D - I felt like the smoke was much more present in the younger bottle of Bourbon County Stout, than in the aged bottles, but over all this beer gets much better aged. Just too intense for me at this point though.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,hrockefeller,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. I finally found this beer and could bring myself to the spend the high ticket price.  This beer is a black hole, sucking in all light then laughing in its face. A somewhat hard pour yields a respectable head, that holds of for most of the sampling. Smells very chocolatey and roasty. Taste is more of the same, with a secondary vanilla flavor, especially as the brew warms. Mouthfeel is very thick. I could drink this all night, every night. Hopefully I will be able to hold off drinking the other 3 bottles so they can be aged. Assuming I can find it each year, this will make a great annual present to myself.

1549,10672,paulzy,3.63,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsner.  Appearance: Looks great. A deep, rusty brown, almost black, but the light catches some red. Barely foams, and then the foam disappears to a tiny ring around the glass.  Smell: Smells pretty strong, but not as strong as I'd expect a bourbon stout. The smell is noticeable when drinking it: woody, and vanilla.  Taste: Nutty, vanilla taste. Malt is strong. Finishes wet, for a stout, with a real sweet finish.  Mouthfeel: This is where this beer shines. Grab a toothbrush because it'll coat your teeth. It's soft and chewy. Thick, like drinking a Hershey bar. This is what I want every stout to feel like. I'd give this a 9.5 of 10 if I could.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for big Imperial. The taste, smell, and mouthfeel all work so well together that I'll definitely be buying this again.  Overall this beer is excellent. I don't remember what it cost, but I'd gladly pay $4 to $5 a bottle for this beer, and would recommend it to anyone after an interesting beer willing to try a stout.

Nose hints of vanilla. A nice little tease for the senses really. Flavor is thick and complex. Vanilla, thick malts, and a load of body just come together.

I had the 2007 special edition that is at 13% ABV and remember feeling like I was drinking a Jack and coke. In fact it really is hard to believe this doesn't have burbon in it. I used to drink burbon and coke and this is definitely the beer equivalent of that, all the way to the warm feeling you get after a few sips.  The taste is so amazing and like many folks have previously said, you have to sip this or you will be overpowered.  I bought mine at Beertopia and liked it so much I wound up buying 6 - 4 packs. And at $4.59 a bottle it is way way overpriced, but then again, most beers are excessively priced at Beertopia in Omaha. It wasn't until I read where a Michigan member paid about $2.00 less per bottle that my suspcions were confirmed.

It pours as black as the African night with no real head to speak of. I looks extremely thick as it pours though it seems pretty average when you drink it. Smells like church wine. Just below the strong alcohol flavor, a woody oak scent can be detected. Maybe some flowers in there as well.

Taste: Dark maltiness with chocolate, sweetened coffee, and dark caramel. Plenty of complimentary sweetness to go around. A bourbon flavor so exquisite, it's hard not to get excited about it. At this level, you get astoundingly distinct, robust flavors of vanilla beans, brown sugar, and charred oak. Anymore bourbon would turn this beer into an abomination of beerkind.

1549,10672,lightindarkness,4.34,"This 2007 brew boasts a 13% ABV, unlike the 11% noted in its profile. With its consistency and alcohol characteristics, this beer seems nearly as well served in a cordial glass as a pint.  Poured a ridiculously dark, somewhat syrupy consistency, such that light is sucked in, like a black hole. It has a surprisingly small coffee-colored head (I attribute the weak head to the thick body of the beer). A swirl in the glass produces a caramel colored layer of film that sticks to the sides of the glass.  The nose on this beast throws immediate scents of chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Further inspection reveals a coconutty sweetness and more depth to the liquor. Some scents of dark-roasted grains and autumn leaves are faintly detectable from within the malt.  Heavy on the taste, more than can be handled in a full swig, so sip carefully. Strong up front unsweetened cocoa, chocolate, and vanilla. Oaky tannins add a complex woody softness to this heavily flavored beer. Not too bitter despite its darkness, with some desirable sweetness, lending to a balance of malts, heavy on the chocolate and black. Nearly coconut earthy sweetness with a nutty undertone that somewhat offsets the heavy estery strong alcohol and phenol overtones. This beer breathes heavily of liquor and cocoa.  In the mouth it is sticky and smooth, hanging around even when you try to swallow. Somewhat thick and medicinal, though certainly very appealing to lovers of AD/ISs.  Overall, this is a chewy, unbelievably full beer. Each sip is a mouthful. Very desserty, and as such not an easy drinker.

Settling in the glass, this beer defines my soul - black and filled with anonymity. I am still stuck inside. No head at all, just purity.  Strong vanilla aroma with bits of hops and charred wood. There is a lot of cherry in the scent as well. Overall, very heavy smell - thick and layered.  In the taste, lots of vanilla up front. Everything tastes charred, as if the storage room that held this beer while it aged had burned down. There is a lot of caramel/toffee/molasses in the flavor. Playing smalled, more subtle roles, you'll find honey, coffee, chocolate and tobacco flavors.  This is a heavy beer, one of the heaviest around. There is no carbonation, just a thick, syrupy assault of flavors.

The aroma is divine: you can smell the bourbon fragrance rising from the surface, along with molasses and treacle. After that, the taste is almost an anti-climax. It is very drinkable though and can slip down with deceptive ease.

1549,10672,Mitchster,4.75,"$2.80 for a 12oz bottle at Jacks. 2007 edition. Label states 13% ABV. I picked up a 4-pack blindly because everything I've had from Goose Island has been universally great. This one requires a hefty pour, and even so, only a thin dark cocoa head forms with poor retention and lacing. As black as night, this is pure ebony oil. Very minimal carbonation, but it's good for this beer. The nose is huge...at first very port-like with a ton of prunes, raisins, dates, soy sauce, lots of vanilla, barbeque charcoal, and black walnut...fortelling of a huge malt bill. The mouthfeel is dense, oily, syrupy and huge. Very big body. The taste...OMFG! Rich and dense beyond belief. Am I glad I bought a 4-pack of this. This is exemplary stuff. It's easy to brew a huge beer, but it's hard to pull it off with style, balance, and no faults. This is a prime example of the latter. The huge malts are all perfectly in balance here...the individual notes all shine through...the sticky sweet amber malts, the sharply burnt black patent, the chocolate malt, the toasty acidity of roasted barley...delicate nuances of cocoa, black walnut, maple syrup, and soy sauce. Firm blast of alcohol is there in the finish...it's presence is definitely known, but it's not caustic. It actually enhances the complexity of the brew. The bitterness is totally kept in check and there is a nice chalkiness to the finish counterbalancing the sweetness. The aftertaste is all prunes. In some ways, this reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock. Absolutely no off-flavors. Unfortunately, I'm not really getting much in the way of bourbon, but it may be because I drink bourbon on a regular basis.  One of the most complex, well-balanced and richly rewarding sippers of a stout I've ever had. Very highly recommended! Thank you again, Goose Island. You guys rock.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Oxymoron,4.25,A buddy of mine picked up a 4 pack in Chi town and about flipped when he brought it over to try. A nice pour that was very viscous and think. Great midnight black color with brown hints around the edge when held to the light. A good head from the pour but did quickly dissipate and not much lacing to speak of either.  The nose is rich and big. Malt aroma and definite solvent alcohol notes are most prominent along with the bourbon aroma. Some touches of stout with roast and coffee. The cask also shows its influence with some vanilla and even woody aromas. There are some base notes that are feint and I could see how if this beer were to age would bring out a nice balance. Notes such as tropical fruits and some caramel and a light banana aroma as well.  The taste is rich with a lot of sweetness and complexity. Noticeable roasty notes and cask flavors. Woody and vanilla mostly but some bourbon and alcoholic heat as well. This is a beer that needs some aging to smooth out some of the harsher flavors. There are hints of chocolate and some astringency or bitterness but more from the grain then hops. Not much hops to really speak of but acceptable  The body is full with no surprise. There is a sticky feel and finishes with a sweetness. There are a lot of things going on here that the complexity is just a little much but with age I could see this shaping into a fantastic beer. A beer that takes a while for sure. I would love to taste this after a year though.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,SupaCelt,4.42,Now this is a beer. Thick as crude and just as black. Minimal head of chocolatey brown. Just a hunk of good drinking. The nose just reaks of roasted malty chocolate. Nice bourbonesque undertones. Smells kind of like barbecue from the blackened graininess. The nose is just saturated with richness. As I raise the glass to my lips alcohol stingers whip my oropharynx. The taste is of most delicious chocolate and boozey fumes. Definite dark fruitiness. This thing is just ripe with flavour. It would probably light on fire. It has a nice bitterness that is completely an afterthought and is almost lost in the cascade of flavour. Just utterly delicious and such a pleasure to consume. This one makes me feel classy as I drink it and the power of it casts a pleasant warmth over my being. The mouthfeel is thick and oily. Very substantial and heavy bodied. I'd love to see the nutrition facts for this sucker. The drinkability is great considering what I have here. The flavour definitely rewards me for taking it slow and experiencing the subtleties as the temperature warms. This is a great beer. Worth the price of admission with all things considered. This is what Midwest winter drinking is all about. Nice work! Chicago!,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Appearance: Black with a thin brown ruby edge, almost no head but a trace of collar. Serious legs on this beer, it wants to hug the glass and never let go!  Flavor: Wow. Thick heavy malt with a treacle aspect. The Bourbon and wood tastes are heavy and tasty. Simple taste, simply delicious.  Mouthfeel: Heavy body, alcohol burn, chews like gum.

1549,10672,bluemoonswoon,4.97,"12oz bottle served in a tulip glass at the Goose Island brewpub.  A: Thick vicsous and black black black, just about the blackest thing I've ever seen, no head whatsoever even with a pretty aggressive pour near the end, maybe this is the result of being bourbon aged, cuz I've seen other double stouts have a decent amount of head and lacing, but for some reason this does not bother me at all, there is some sort of quiet dignity about this beer that does not need a big fancy and sticky head to look beautiful. Just sitting there this beer looks eerily inviting, very exotic.  S: Where to begin really, like world wide stout this beer smells like no other beer I have ever encountered. A big hot hit of bourbon but balanced sweetly with creamy vanilla and fresh ground coffee. You can tell this one is going to be some kind of luxurious beer.  T/MF: Like oil in the mouth, at first smooth and silky but on the swallow this one starts to get sticky all over, very nicely balanced and very active and exciting mouthfeel. The taste is also something out of this world, at first it has a good deal of bourbon heat but mellows out after a bit in the mouth and then the sweeter aspects begin to appear. The vanillia that was present in the nose reasserts itself in a big way in the mouth and brings with it a rich chocolate coffee like flavor behind it. This close brings back the heat in a big way and at the very last leaves with a bit of rich butter and cream.  D: This may be one of the freshest, tastiest most wonderful beer I've ever had the pleasure of sipping. The abv says 11 but you could have fooled me. This is a HUGE beer and really incredibly drinkable beside a fire with a 100 dollar wheel of cheese or otherwise.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

It took some effort to produce a stingy 1"" and I was dissapointed to how quickly it subsided to a light ring around the glass. Despite this inadequacy, still a nice looking beer.  Wow, very apparent bourbon and oak essence with vanilla and caramel. There is also a presence of roasted chocolate malts, coffee and subtle booze tones.  Again a nice mix of bourbon and oak. Notes of vanilla, molasses and ripe pitted fruits. Finishing it off are the roasty black and chocolate malts.  Full body with a thick mouthfeel, well carbonated.  Well balanced and a nice bourbon stout. Even with the stong bourbon and oak characters there are no harsh elements here.

No head at all, just a few brown bubbles clinging to the side of the snifter. Looks similar to a glass of used motor oil.  Initial aroma is a blast of dark molasses. Later I pick up more molasses with hints of oak. I took a sniff from a bottle of Wellers just to make sure I wasn't missing any bourbon aromas...I'm not.  Initial taste is also dominated by molasses and a pronounced alcohol burn. As it warms the beer actually mellows out a little with touches of oak tannin and smoke. Mouth feel is thick, but thanks to the alcohol, not that smooth.  Overall, I'm struggling with this beer. I expected so much more.

I love head on my brews and sadly it didn't have much even from a strong pour. The smell however is beautiful. Smells of bourbon, coffee, and rich cocoa. The taste is rich and complex. Its so creamy and full of coffee. Cocoa also makes up most of the taste and finishes with a slight boozy quality.  Overall, I love this brew. Its not as great as the FKBS however its still an amazing brew.

1549,10672,pwoods,4.49,"12oz. brown bottle, purchased from Party Source, poured into an imp pint. Bottled on 10/12/07 consumed 11/24/07  A: Solid black pour, zero visibility. 1/4 inch head struggles to form and dissipates quickly. Very little lacing.  S: I actually had to look all the way back to soulgrowl's review to put my finger on what I was smelling. It's so pungent, yet I couldn't find the words. Big raw coconut meat controls most of the stout. This is what I get most of but it has a very defined coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses, and vanilla, and deeply toasted grains. Extremely complex. I poured this around 45-50 degrees but the alcohol took its time coming out in the smell. About halfway down the bourbon really came through beautifully.  T/M: Where to start? Everything is so balanced. Nothing overpowers the other, all the flavors meld without stepping on each others toes. Strong Bourbon is the backbone of this brew, for sure... there is a touch of it in every individual flavor. Big notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate, followed by a well defined coconut sweetness. A sharp hop bitterness right up front that lays way to the coffee and finishes with a thick molasses thump. Body is full, sticky, and a bit chewy. Carbonation is pretty low. Finishes dry, and gets dryer as it warms. As it warms, the coconut flavor strengthens a bit too much, IMHO.  D: Probably these most complex smelling and tasting beer I've ever had. Definitely something that you want to sip. $20/4pack is kind of steep but I'll gladly buy a pack or 2 during this time of year. Other than price, I would have liked to see a touch more carbonation to help the head and lacing a bit.  2nd Tasting: Bottled Fall '05. Consumed 1/26/08 .  Carbonation is still on the mild side though it hasn't lost any. Alcohol has died a bit in the nose as has the vanilla. Vanilla has settled a bit in the taste as well but is still present. More oaky flavors have come through as well as some sugary dark fruits(candied plums?). The alcohol is still nearly as potent as ever. With this brew being over 2 years old and still kickin', I'd bet it could last years more. Thanks again, Mikesgroove for this great brew and for cellaring it quite nicely.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,seaoflament,4.35,"Thanks to SPLITGRIN for the recent trade. A 2006 vintage.  Now, I know the site will place this as my 100th review but its actually my 99th since I mistakenly added a beer twice and is counting that one as two reviews. Nonetheless this is still a worthy beer to appear as my 100th review (my real 100th review will be an Angels Share).  Poured into my Portsmouth tulip glass at around cellar temp.  The color is black with hints of red when the light hits the beer. Not the darkest stout Ive seen but still a very nice color. In the glass it looks a few shades darker than how it poured, with some light brown around the edge of the glass, reminiscent of a cola soda. Almost zero head and the tinniest bubbles of carbonation are present.  The aroma is of oak, burned wood, vanilla, grains, smoke, a bit of caramel, cherries and strawberries, chocolate, corn husks maybe (probably thinking back to the grains), and a bit of molasses.  The taste is surprisingly sweet upfront with lots of chocolate and a warm finish. The second sip revealed some soy sauce, smoke, cherries, big malt profile (chocolate and roasted), vanilla, and wood/oak notes. Also making a presence is some anise, malted milk, and a few others which I know Im missing but cant quite put my finger on. It also tastes a bit similar to a smoked porter.  The mouth-feel is very smooth with just enough carbonation to keep it from being syrupy. There is a warm alcohol finish which lingers for a while in the back of the mouth. You can feel the alcohol warm you up as it goes down the esophagus and hit your stomach. I would dock off at least half a point for the presence of the alcohol but I think that is the intent of this beer and it is meant to be a beer to warm you up on a cold day/night so in that mindset I think it does it with success. Sticky lips after you pull back from each sip.  This one looks, smells, tastes, and feels like a big beer. This beer is definitely a sipper.  Overall this is a very good beer and one I am glad to have a couple more to age longer and see how it changes in another year.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,tpd975,4.62,"2006 Version sent over by the one and only Sudsdog. Since I scored a nice haul of the 2007 I figured I would finally drink this one.  A: Pours black, coal black, midnight black, obsidion black, you pick the adjective... This MoFo is black. I put it up to the bright Florida sunshine on a fall day and nodda, nothing can cut thru this one. Not much carbonation and the head is rather wimpy. That being said what little head that does build tends to hand around. In the lacing department... None. It's so thick and oily that I don't think lacing has a prayer with this one.  S: I have never smelled anything another than true Bourbon that smells this much like Bourbon. Huge barrelled Bourbon aroma with deep earthy vanilla aromas. Coffee lies beneath with hints of toffee, molassess, almonds, and dark Belgian chocolate.  T: Man I have a buddy that spends half his net worth to sample the best small batch Bourbon known to man and thanks to him I have been able to sample them as well. Let me tell you this one must have been made with the barrels from the finest batch of Bourbon ever made. Tons of Flavor with the big boozy Bourbon flavor smacking you right in the mouth. Hell this one may be spiked with Bourbon. Hints of oak, vanilla, and coffee come thru as well.  M: Nice and thick this is one full bodied brew.  D: It's a one and done beer for me. This is one to be sipped not slammed.  Overall: This beer is neck and neck with KY Stout as the best in the world. I prefer KY stout slightly due to it's more relaxed Bourbon characteristics. But let me tell you if you love Bourbon this is no doubt about it the greatest beer known to man. I can't wait to try the 2007 batch and see how it matches up.

Smell: Less sharp this year, for sure; more nutty, with a thick marzipan almond aroma, and loads of toasted coconut, too. Mild whiskey spice, some soy sauce and barrels of molasses with rum-soaked prunes. So very complex, and so nice.  Taste: Sweeter now, with plenty of syrupy Kahlua sugared coffee flavor, plus prunes, tobacco, whiskey. Very sinful, evil even, with cherry cordials, chocolate, and soy sauce. Smooth, yet intensely complex.  Mouthfeel: Ridiculously smooth. Crushed velvety with a dry-yet-sticky finish.  Drinkability: Mmm, very intense, yest so smooth and complex. Excellent.

Rich bourbon, mix of dark and milk chocolates, coconut, burnt toast, sweet malt, vanilla, oak, smokey campfire and tons of warming booze. Very complex, a lot going on in flavor.

A - Deep, deep caramel brown with a small rich brown head that dissipated quickly to nothing.  S - The easy answer here is bourbon, but believe it or not my first reaction was German Chocolate Cake...The combo of bourbon, caramel and chocolate gave off that aroma including the coconut.  T - Strong stuff. Definitley a sipper...so strong that at first I wasn't sure if this was the beer for me tonight, but after 10 or 15 min the rich, thick bourbony taste won me over. Not much in the hop areana, but there are just enough to balance out the malt and molasses taste and keep it from being 2oz. and done.  M - Almost no carbonation, which makes it all that much richer on the tounge with nothing to cut it.  D - I was going to rate it lower because you really can't drink more than one, but that's not what this beer is about.

Chewy, sticky, coats the tongue in sweet maltiness. Absolutely full bodied.  d: Somehow, despite all the malt they crammed into this thing, the heaviness of its texture, its still silky smooth.

1549,10672,ncvbc,4.62,"I had this beside a Kentucky Breakfast the other night. Two distinctly different beers, both of which are very good. This was bottled on 7/03/06 so its got some age under its belt.  The pour was basically pitch black with a thin tan head. I actually had my friend pour half of each in four different glasses.  It was pretty tough to tell the two apart based on appearance but the smell made it crystal clear. This one isn't quite so bold, though its subtleties are what make it great. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, light bourbon, and other scents rise up and beg for attention. The only thing is none really step forward and take the lead, which is actually pretty impressive. You have to take your time with this one.  Taste is about as complex as the smell. I noticed everything I did in the nose but also a light oak and caramel presence. Again, this beer isn't bold, it's subtle and pretty tamed. The flavors mesh together to perfection and I honestly can't get enough.  Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Near full with the only thing keeping it from a 5 being a slight burn in the middle.  This is very different from the Kentucky Breakfast. Where KBS flaunts its coffee and other flavors, making it a more bold brew, Bourbon County is calm and collected. I can tell the two apart with ease but don't favor one more than the other.

The taste starts off with the strong flavor of bourbon, and then gives way to a smooth chocolate flavor accompanied by hints of vanilla and wood. Highly complex. The mouthfeel is just like a stout should be, very thick and smooth. This is what I consider to be a sipping beer, and not exactly a sessionable ale. The high abv. keeps this from being sessionable.

The head that was present was thin, less than 1/8"", tan/brown with some purple in it.  S - Dark Malts, some chocolate hints, and bourbon. Bottle said it was bottled in 2006, no date though. Bottle aging helped as the bourbon smoothed out and was not ovepowering.  T - Bourbon, dark black malt, chocolate malt. That was about it. Some oak in there as well but very very subtle.  M - Thick, heavy, hard hitting. Not thinned by the bourbon, its like the stout was made extra heavy and then added into bourbon barrells and then thinned to the proper consistency of a stout.  D - Drinkable, but at 11% kind of a night killer. Hard for me to drink it as the alcohol really starts imparing the senses about halfway through. Nice to try a different brew from Goose Island, but not something I would buy again.  Overall, not a bad beer, not an excellent beer either. The label had this long drawn out retort saying this was a ""special"" beer and it was considered a ""cigar beer"". It seemed Goose Island was trying to replace a bourbon or scotch with this for the cigar smokers in the bar. Not sure if that would work.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Monsone,4.72,A - Pours pitch black from a 12oz bottle. Thick like motor oil with a brown head that quickly dissapates.  S - Sweet caramel malt with coffee and oaky bourbon aromas are present  T - Coffee with dark choco and sweet malt. Bourboun flavors are very evident. Very complex flavorful stout.  M - Full bodied and silky smooth.  D - Pretty drikable but big alcohol and dominant flavors mean you probably can have only one of these at a time.  Very good bourbon stout. This version was much more balanced than when I had it on draft this winter. The aging improved it greatly. I will definately seek this out again.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BeerTruth,4.42,"Big thanks to Monsone for this one!  12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic.  Pours a jet black with a dark brown colored head of two fingers that quickly dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness is hardly there, but shows up a bit here and there. Smell is of big sweet molasses with some swet caramel notes. I sense a bit of kahlua in the nose as well, yummy. Taste is rich! Starts of with the sweet molasses mixed with a gooey chocolate brownie. Bourbon taste definitely comes through midway and warms as it goes down. The taste gets more and more complex as it warms. More of a dark chocolate flavor emerges with hints of espresso. Mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Silky smooth, wow. I'll definitely look for this one again. Pick it up, trade for it, give up one of your kidneys for it...do what you have to, pick it up.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Flyer,4.37,"This beer is a great example of what I call ""purposeful excess."" Anyone can overload a batch of beer with malt or hops, but the challenge is to make it a great beer in the process, and Goose Island has succeeded with this one. There are red highlights as you pour it, but it sits instensely black in the glass, with a thin, mocha-colored head. The aroma is all bourbon. The flavor is amazing, coffee-and-chocolate-noted malt intensity with loads of bourbony earthiness. Unlike many bourbon barrel-aged beers, the liquor flavors don't come through in any way as brandy -- it's much more of a true bourbon flavor. The malty whallop is great, and yet there's a back-taste that's almost reminiscent of port wine. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, but aromatic  yes, like bourbon. So, so satisfying. But here's the nit -- twelve ounces is too much, and it's hard for me to find someone to share this with. The second six ounces aren't quite as enjoyable as the first six. If Goose Island would put this in a smaller bottle, I'd buy it a lot more.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bjohnson,4.47,"2006 version. Poured at just above cellar temp.  Pours an opaque black as if someone turned the lights out in the cellar while you were looking for a beer. Making your way out you see a thin one finger caramel colored head that dissipates rather quickly leaving small island like forming foam in the middle of the glass. Chocolate notes are the first aromas to hit the nostrils. Theres a smoothness to the chocolate notes, which can be attributed to vanilla bean notes. Woody oak notes also contribute to the smoothness in the nose. Hot licorice and dark fruit notes are also present, but play a nice secondary role to the oak and vanilla bean notes.  Oak laced chocolate flavors hit the taste buds like a wave. Chocolate flavors give way to vanilla bean notes that give a subtle smoothness to the overall flavor. Licorice notes blend well with a touch of dark fruits, which contribute to a nice sweetness that comes through in the aftertaste. Thick and juicy mouthfeel comes through pretty hard with a hotness. Bourbon booze is hefty but not over abundant. A nice brew this one is with a ton of flavor and excellent smooth mouthfeel. One to sip and enjoy if you get the chance. I bet this also cellars well.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

1549,10672,bort11,4.77,"For a very special 200th review.  12 oz bottle with a bottled on date of 070306. Poured into a broad mouth goblet as recommended. Dark tan head only climbs to about a quarter inch and quickly recedes to a ring. But that ring has legs, and it's not going anywhere. Color is a smooth brown/black. Reminds me of crushed velvet.  Smell is an eye opener. Really. When I stick my nose into the glass it's like I can taste it in my eyes. It is a wonderful mix of charred oak, vanilla, chocolate malts, brown sugar, and of course, bourbon.  Taste is a bit more muted than what I would expect, but that's OK. It makes me want to savor it more to get the full effect. Taste follows smell, but finishes with a warm whisky spiciness.  Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. It slides across the tongue, creating a warm coating.  It is kind of scary how drinkable this is.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bluegrassbrew,4.59,"12oz bottle into a snifter.  Re-reviewing this one as last time I had it I had no experience with the style.  Pours an opaque black with very, very little head that is coffee colored while it lasts.  Smell is amazing! Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and a bit of alcohol. Very bold and pleasing.  Taste is also fantastic. More bittersweet chocolate, a bit of oak but not really that much bourbon flavor. Sweet yet bitter and very tasty.  Thick and full bodied. The first one goes down very slowly. The second has more noticable flavor and is a bit smoother. Overall a wonderfully brewed beer that I would be happy to have on any occasion.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DarkerTheBetter,4.22,"I got this one from JCoe in a direct trade at FFF on my way home to MN.  Looks terribly black with only a hint of raisin creeping around the edges. The head is but a thin collar of dirty tan.  Smells amazing with a ton of gooey barley, vanilla, marshmallows, honey, red grapes, bourbon and a touch of astringent alcohol hiding deep within.  The flavor begins with a huge load of sweetness that releases a lot of the same sweet notes from the smell, but strongly focused on a corn syrup sweetness. It finishes by fading into a dry, toasty coffee and an oaky alcohol.  Feels huge and creamy with a thickening micro carbonation that makes this one a real mouthful. Amazingly, this one finishes dry but my mouth feels a little dirty and sticky.  This one is a champion of big beers. Theres a lot going on here; perhaps too much",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BillyB,4.2,"Thanks to hero27 for the trade.  Pours an opaque, black, color with a thin, whispy, tan head. Nice retention with above average lacing on the glass.  Aromas of alcohol (bourbon), caramel, vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, toffee and some smokiness.  Tastes of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, oakey, burnt wood and caramel.  Mouthfeel is crisp and moderately carbonated with a nice full, chewy, creamy, body. Nice alcohol warmth.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,WesWes,4.5,"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thin brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an incredibly warm black malt and bourban whiskey scent that is quite potent. It boasts of burnt caramel and toffee. The taste is great. It has a very smooth imperial stout flavor with a nice bourban flavor in the finish. It's rich and powerful with loads of flavor. It reminds me of an oaked porter I once made. The wood taste really comes through. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very impressive beer with lots of character. It's loaded with malts and topped off with a solid bourban taste that really compliments the malt bill. This is a good drinker.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,objectivemonkey,4.37,"Pours a thick, dark, oil of a black, slick as death incarnate, devoid of any head or life to speak of. Only after a brief pause does a dark tan foam apparition spring from the void, only to skulk about for a short bout. Lacing slogs about after each tilt and swirl, bubbles and streaks creep slowly back to the abyss.  The aroma is a dark heady waft of pure bourbon alcoholic booze, sitting one back in his seat, urging a slowing down to things. Roasted, charred black malts roll in the swirling mass of darkness, coffee espresso, and an oozing molasses dripping with sweetly brown sugar.  The taste is quite frankly intoxicating, urging to be enjoyed even slower and more carefully, for this is a dangerous brew. The alcohol stings if not handled with respect, but rewards a reverent tasting. Only after a long, solemn genuflection, is one rewarded with the true character of this beast. A smoking hulk of char and barley cling to oak soaked bourbon that rides high, a dark master, mean and harsh yet wise. Espresso and bitter chocolate hang like minstrels about his side, indeed, this powerful monster has so many minions and subtleties hanging on its tassels its hard to tell them apart from the seething, swarming hoard. Its dark, complex, and delightful.  The mouth is both sweetly and stinging at times, the alcohol not shy at all, the body thick and syrupy. Its a body that states its not fucking around, so pay attention. I can see Lord Sauron sipping on this bad boy, in between tortures, maimings, and general badassedness.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bobhits,4.99,"I was at the local liquor store looking around for a decent beer when I noticed this gem. I recalled seeing this beer here on the 100 best and I knew I had to buy a 4 pack, price be damned.  After the first taste I was hooked. So to celebrate the end of finals what could be better than a beer?  A. The bottle says that it's black as a black hole. They weren't kidding. The beer makes a slight tanish head that quickly goes away leaving a little bit of lacing floating in the beer. If you swirl it around the glass it leaves a dark sticky residue.  S. The smell is wonderful. You get the oak, the malts, maybe a hint of charcoal, and that classic stout smell. The only real problem being the smell isn't all that strong.  T. I wish I could even attempt to do this beer justice. I'll start out by saying that stouts really aren't my beer of choice. This however is without a doubt one of the best tasting things I've ever put in my mouth. The beer is a bit too cold right now, but the chocolate and the sweetness of the malts are over powering. There is also a good bit of alcohol taste coming through.  M. The carnation and alcohol work together to give this beer a really good feel when you drink it. The effect reminds you that this is a sipping beer. It is also a lot thicker than most beers, it's almost a bit syrupy in nature, but not so much that anyone should be turned off by it. As it warms I'm starting to pick up on maybe a bit of vanilla? Regardless the flavors simply blow you away. They joke on that this beer by some is called a good cigar beer, but no cigar could ever hold up to it. Well, they really weren't lying.  D. This beer was made for sipping. Using that as the standard, it is simply perfect. The taste demands you come back for me and the mouth feel reminds you to sip. My first two times having this beer I split one with a friend and one with my dad. The 6 oz serving was plenty to enjoy it, but I have little doubt that I could drink a few of these over the course of a night.  As far as I'm concerned this is as close to perfection as a stout can get. I can't recommend this beer enough.  Years later reviewing a bottle of 2011 in 2014  I LOVE this beer. LOVE  Imagine the aroma of a great bourbon sweet sugary, vanilla, oak, but none of the heat or the sour bite of the oak. That's the aroma. Sure chocolate, molasses and other stout aromas are mixed in.  The viscous look is unquestionably, deep rich, no carbonation.  This beer is heaven. There is no better beer and I'm adjusting the score to reflect this. This IS the perfect beer. I just can't do it justice. Sugars meet vanilla meat caramel meet bourbon. Chocolate malt mixed with cigar notes are in the back end. This is just I wanted to add some value but damn this is amazing!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,flexabull,4.54,"I was able to get three of these in recent trades... thanks everyone!  Pours a thick deep black color, a small tan head rose up when the pour ended.  Aromas are of deep dark bitter chocolate, a very slight coffee note, a bit of baked fruits and bread, there is also some bourbon and alcohol as well. This is an intense, complex, and interesting smelling beer.  The first thing I notice on the first sip, is the bourbon. It's not overpowering, but it makes it's presence known. Beer then settles into some dark sweet bread flavors, a touch of bitter chocolate, and a crisp biting finish. Nice!  Mouthfeel is excellent, very full bodied, and the warming of the alcohol is great and not overpowering.  Drinkability? Yep. This is a healthy and sturdy beer, but it's a great late night sipper.  I am glad I have a couple more of these that I can sit on for a while. Excellent stout, well done Goose Island!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,RedChrome,4.52,"Almost pure black liquid. Deep tan head of half an inch faded in a minute to a slick on top. Carbonation has no chance of being visible in the dark body.  Extremely strong aroma of alcohol wafting out of the glass. Past this, the vanilla dominates with hints of plums, red grapes, figs, and black cherries in a fruity blend. Light caramel and toffee notes also blend. Bourbon seemed downplayed.  Bourbon is much stronger on the tongue then in the nose. A extreme malt bomb bringing a roasted grains strength foremost. Alcohol is a bit strong. Cherry and vanilla become stronger forces as this warms.  This is a thick body that clings to all the mouth surfaces. Carbonation has only a minor effect. Alcohol offers a warming effect.  Fantastic beer. This is a great beer to enjoy after a larger meal or with a roasted lamb. This one would only be more drinkable if the alcohol was lower. Worth getting your hands for any fair price.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jaxon53,4.7,"Much thanks to nathan15 for trading me this delicious brew.  Served at cellar temperature in a pint glass, from a 12 oz. bottle. Poured a spent motor oil black in which no light could pass through. About a half inch of dark mocha brown head formed, and faded into a tan ring of lace in the glass. Smell: aromas of smooth dark chocolate, oak, coffee, and bourbon filled my nose. Some alcohol also present. Taste: Lots of bitter roasted coffee, sweet chocolate, notes of smokey oak, vanilla extract and strong whiskey flavors. Very little carbonation. Strong presence of alcohol that isn't overwhelming. Smooth throughout with a warm finish. Thick and rich in the mouth. Did I mention smooth? Very well balanced and very well crafted. Very drinkable and very enjoyable.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DaPeculierDane,2.43,"Not my cup of tea (stupid bourbon ruining a great beer) but I must admit that this would be a wonderful beer if I liked bourbon even if I disagree with the style.  Appearance: Pours the darkest shade of brown possibly with no head and then suddenly loads of dark brown froth explodes. A healthy lace swirls like a hurricane and an 1/8 inch ring coats the glass.  Aroma: Bourbon, molasses, coconut, rum, caramel, and white sugar.  Taste: Mostly bourbon with touches of vanilla and cocoa. Maybe some coffee but mostly just bourbon and molasses.  Mouthfeel: Heavy, thick, chewy, and boozey.  Drinkability: Very low for me. Frankly, I find it drain pour worthy.  $5 a piece...ridiculous. There are better bourbon barrel stouts for 1/4 to 1/5 that cost coming out of shacks in the northern woods.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,mikesgroove,4.03,"A - Poured thick, black as night oil like liquid which had a huge tan head that really very slowly faded leaving behind lots of gooey sticky brown lace. Very frothy and pillow like head, lots of waves in it.  S - Smell was strong, main hints were of caramel, with some chocolate mixed in and a strong alcohol presence. Lots of sweet vanilla and almost a mocha smell as well, very sweet overall.  M & T - First impression was wow, and very very strong. It was smooth, with not alot of carbonation. Huge bourbon whiskey type taste hit me right away as did the alcohol, this was not something to be messed with for sure. Very creamy thick feel and very strong alcohol presentation. Hints at french vanilla and a touch of chocolate rounded out the back side and added a bit of sweetness.  D - Overall this is probably the strongest tasting, in the sense of the upfront alcohol taste, I have had in a stout. I felt it was almost overdone a tad and could have been played back a bit. A definate sipper and probably could use to sit down in the cellar for a while.

1549,10672,ArrogantB,4.5,"12 oz 2006 bottle received from Orbialr0x. The first smell let me know that this beer was going to be very good. The smell was chocolate and heavy. The color was black with a brown head. The taste was like Godiva dark chocolates with hints of bourbon coming through as it warmed. This was so amazing. Definitely the best bourbon barrel stout I've ever had if not the best stout in general. Alcohol was very well hidden.  Update 01/21/08 2006 bottle  Heavy bourbon smell, almost like sniffing a straight shot. Bourbon is also present in the flavor but there is also a nuttiness that kinda reminds me of peanut butter. There alcohol is well hidden, not a hint of the 11% in the taste and just a whiff in the nose.  update 10/3/13 2012 bottle  This stuff is just great, might be the best bourbon barrel stout if not a close second to Parabola",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,westweasel,4.47,"The beer poured out fairly thick, into a pint glass. The appearance was jet black and opaque, with only a sliver of a tan head.  The strongest scent present is bourbon, but I also got vanilla, chocolate, and a roasty scent. Very interesting!  The taste was bourbon, roasted grains, caramel, raisins, and a little vanilla.  The mouthfeel was somewhere between medium and full, with a strong bourbony aftertaste.  The drinkability is very good for a barrel-aged beer that has this much alcohol.

1549,10672,atsprings,4.82,"Thanks to ThomasHardy for the trade. The beer poured a very opaque black with a decent brown head that slowly diminished and left spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma was one of the strongest I've ever encountered. I poured the beer from the bottle into a Stone Imperial Russian Stout snifter and set it on the kitchen counter. I could smell the beer from there while still standing upright. The aroma was dominated by roasted barley but quickly followed by roasted coffee, bitter coffee and plenty of oak. The beer tasted strongly of rich espresso with a decent bitter cocoa flavor and a noticeable presence of Bourbon. The alcohol was somewhat well hidden and the beer set a slightly heavy-medium on the palate. This is def finitely a sipper, but a very enjoyable one nonetheless.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,ultralarry2006,4.9,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle of 2006 release. Leaves less than one finger of a beautiful espresso foam colored head that quickly dissipates into a foam ring at the edge, and leaves no lacing. Body is a rich black. Beautiful to behold.  Smell - so much to smell !! In no particular order there is : chocolate, toffee, loads of vanilla, cherries, oak, raisins, dates, dark fruits, strong and medicinal alcohol, dark roasted malts, dark maltbread with nearly burned crusts, some small amount of smokiness, small hint of bourbon. The aroma is rich and mouthwatering !!  Taste - every bit as rich and flavorful as promised in the aroma !! Again, there are so many flavors, and in no particular, there is : cherries, vanilla, oak, medicinal and spicy alcohol, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, dark roasted malts, dark crusted dark maltbread, dark fruits,some smokiness, caramel, tea, and tobacco. Alcohol is strong but not harsh, and is actually pleasant and a very important part of the taste. The oak, cherries, and vanilla are the main flavors, washing over the others that make themselves evident at various times. The caramel, tea, and tobacco come on on the finish. So very rich and rewarding, delicious !!  Mouthfeel - full bodied, smooth, chewy, fluffy ( like eating puffed grain cereal ) , creamy, and sometimes, syrup-like stickiness about the mouth and lips after swallowing.  Drinkability - This is most excellent ale !! It is very rich and rewarding to both smell and taste, and beautiful as well. The high abv is obviously limiting to sessionability, and so is the ale's richness.

S: Sweet smelling with aromas of molasses, caramel, chocolate, and just a tad of alcohol.  T: Quite sweet up front with a complex roasted taste. The flavor continues to deveop and evolve and eventually finishes with a flavor of mocha and cocoa and some newly discovered hop bitterness. Where's that 11% ABV hiding?  M: Thick and heavy with light carbonation. Chewy and viscous.  D: I still can't seem to find that 11% ABV anywhere. I think they're making that up. Way to go Greg for not overdoing the bourbon aging.

Black-hole void but with just a thin tan creamy film. Scant traces of lace...ridiculously thick and dense.  S: Stinging charred malt, heavy bitter chocolate, espresso coffee. Tannic oak barrel and vanilla come bursting from the glass. Good now, I'm betting greatness will come with some more age.  T: Wonderful full flavor of toasty bourbon oak barrel comes on strong in this terrific stout. Vanilla accents the heavy bittersweet chocolate and rich roasted coffee. Warm and cognac-like smokiness melded with molasses sweetness. Love it - if it's this good after only 8 months, I look forward to what it'll be like in a couple years. The most delicious 'bourbon' taste in a beer I've found yet.  M: Velvety smooth, grabbing onto every taste bud. Alcohol heat layers on top of an exceedingly full mouthfeel. Just a little carbonation hidden inside that rich heavenly body. A coating, lingering bittersweetness just goes on and on...and on...  D: Outstanding...so close to being perfect. Flat out great tasting and one to treasure. My wife says: ""it tastes rad!"" and ""it's awesome to the max!""...with praise like that, what more can I say?

1549,10672,mentor,3.94,"2006 bottle provided by crosling. Thanks for the opportunity! Pours a fizzy dark brown head over a pitch liquid. Pour was very thick liquid. Minimal ring of fine bubbles around the inside of the glass. Smells bourbon, fig, alcohol and ashy.  Tastes alcohol burn with a nice supporting toffee and chocolate. Alcohol sting is strong and clean of fusels. The beer could be too hot, except for a rising wet sweet anise and fig finish. Chocolate and some roast. Not overly sweet, like many double stouts, but a good balance between sweet, roast, and the alcohol.  Thick mouthfeel helps sweeten the beer. Carbonation is mild. Taste is well balanced, but the aroma was severely lacking.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BlindPig,4.73,"A- Thin dark mocha head on a BLACK body. S- Big chocolate malts, some roasted malts in there too, bourbon comes through but really manages to blend in nicley with the other aromas, oak, earthy hops also. T- Very interesting first sip. It went from strong bourbon and oak flavors and then you could feel everything just change notes and went to really rich chocolate (almost like double chocolate milk or something) and then that faded in strength and went to a blend between that and a light oak. Second sip did the same thing but a few flavors got more announced. A bitterness comes through and builds up on the front/mid of your tongue. The bourbon always seems to come off strong right at the bat but then gives way to huge chocolate and light roasted flavors. Just as your swallowing the alcohol really heats up the back of your throat pretty roughly then fades to a hot but more calm warming. Vanilla flavors really come through nice also. M- Really big full body with low to medium carbonation (not as smooth as I would like it for a such a big stout). Leaves a light tingle on the tongue. D- This is a very good beer. You can not drink this fast at all and is a big sipper. I think how strong they got the chocolate flavors is just great. Now excuse me while I go sit outside and sip this on one of the last colder nights. Also I wish I could give this a 4.75 but I can't. I don't feel it is a 5 though so just a note. Actually on everything I wish I could give it a 4.75.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TheBungyo,4.62,"Thanks to Czoch for the trade! Muchos gracias.  The body comes straight from the sewers like Das EFX because it's as dark as the New York city sewers. No head sadly and almost no lacing.  How does it smell. It's good I guess. Just kidding, it smells fantastic, the vanilla notes are humongous. There's plenty of black licorice, chocolate chips that smell as if they're in cookies fresh from the oven. I have to say that it's a more dominant bourbon stout in terms of the bourbon flavor, but never is it too much. The only other beer to get it right was The Abyss which is less bourbon dominant.  It doesn't slack in the taste dept either. The chocolate is beefy and brawny, it batters the tongue, takes it down and makes it submit. Vanilla plays in the background with lurking molasses and cocoa.  The carbonation is just barely there, but enough to give the body a viscous oily feel that I quite like. Wow is this good. If you love stouts this is definitely one to somehow get ahold of.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Mebuzzard,4.15,"Got this in a trade with Buckeyenation, thanks! Cool label, gives history of this brew. Pours a dark brown, turns black when pooled in a glass. No head, a bit of brown foam on the edge. Smells of vanilla oak, some chocolate and a bit of alcohol. Taste smacks of a vanilla/chocolate swirl, oak binds them together. I think there is some caramel and raisin in it as well. Alcohol starts to burn, but quickly fades. A bit syrupy, so the drinkability was lowered. A really good Double Stout seeing as I don't like bourbon.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,brewdlyhooked13,4.97,"Appearance - an opaque black pour, a thin head of dark mocha, very finely bubbled. Some bubbles hang around to provide some light lacing, thick collar, and partial covering.  Aroma - heavy aromas of chocolate, well-roasted malt, and coffee liqueur. Superb.  Taste - sweet and heavy malts provide the backdrop. Oak, syrupy chocolate, smooth but prevalent alcohol in front; balancing hops, coffee, and more boozy warmth on the swallow. The finish is very belly warming, vanilla rounding things out.  Mouthfeel - thick, heavy, velvety smooth and pretty well-carbonated. Completes the flavor perfectly.  Drinkability - I tried one of these fresh and while I thought it tasty, it didn't set off bells the way this one did.

I do want to say that my reviews are more for myself than for others, so it will be written in a way that make sense to me.  Poured into a tulip, a small beige head forms and slowly dissipated. I drank this one at cellar temp, which really brings out the smells and flavors!..Boozy, boozy, boozy! Followed by chocolate, vanilla, and some roastiness. This beer is not for the faint hearted, IMO. The taste of alcohol smacks you in the face and gives you that warming sensation as it goes down..good for those cold, winter nights! This is followed by a nice roasty, chocolate flavor and a slight hint of vanilla at the end.  I gotta say that this is one of my favorite beers to date..being a BA for just shy of a year, I have seen major changes in my palate. If I had this beer a year ago, I would have said ""yuk""..I am so glad I waited to try this one. Anyone feeling generous? You can always send me some o' dis and I will never be disappointed!

1549,10672,Metalmonk,4.75,"2006 edition (received in trade via Brian aka msubulldog25)  My first Goose Island beer, probably not the best representation of their typical output. Glug-Glug-Glugs into a snifter the blackest, thickest murk I have ever seen come out of a beer bottle. The head is brown but doesn't last long at all. No lace and no head, but very good looking regardless...black beyond imagining.  Nose is toasty melted chocolate, almost burnt, definitely some oak, big caramel, more chocolate, and toasted marshmallow. Alcohol is present but well-incorporated. Overall impression: it smells like s'mores just cooked over a campfire.  The flavor is amazing...if you're looking for a beer that'll flare your nostrils and give you a guilt-trip as if you just downed an entire chocolate cheesecake by yourself. Huge flavors of chocolate, marshmallow and graham cracker (this is like liquified s'mores). The alcohol is hardly subtle, hardly well-hidden, riding through with the other flavors as if going to battle. The chocolate, caramel, vanilla and oak notes are all out on the frontline with the warming alcohol. A bourbon-like heat remains for the finish, which is mostly charred chocolate and big black cherries cooked in some bad-ass liqueur. Incredibly, insanely, indomitably delicious.  The mouthfeel is thick, viscous, oily, hefty, syrupy...nearly as gooey as taffy. A total delight, perhaps even a novelty, as this is probably the thickest beer I've had the chance to taste so far.  Wow. This is not ""drinkable"" by the everyday definition, but for what it is--a beer meant to be slowly savored--it is incredible. Not only a total dessert beer, but almost a meal in itself. As big as it is, it's also well-balanced. I can't imagine lovers of big stouts not going apeshit over this one. Delightful.

Sheet lacing slides all around the NB snifter glass.  Massive whiff of anise, choc, coffee, and the kitchen sink. Wow. If it wasnt for the thick and rich body, I would guess it to be Makers Mark bourbon. A full dark fruit basket in every taste, but still nicely alcohol hot. It may be 11%, but Im having to slow down on my tasting sips. Actually a bit sweet in the finish.

1549,10672,jjayjaye,4.35,"When poured aggressively, appears an opaque dark brown color with less than a finger dark tan head that fades quickly with little lacing.  S - The aroma is immediate and aggressive bourbon. Beneath that, a chocolate malty undertone.  In the mouth, the immediate feel is a 'ting' of the alcohol and hop. It has a heavy body without being syrupy. It is also quite smooth and creamy.  The flavor mirrors the smell. Dominantly bourbon, a wonderful basic chocolate flavor is balanced by a vanilla and roast malt flavors.  There is no hiding the 11% ABV in this experience. It's definitely a sipper.

1549,10672,BWH3,4.52,"Goose Island Bourbon County Stout 12oz Bottle Bottling Date: 07/03/06 Drinking Vessel: Goblet Temp: 50-55 F  Appearance: Pitch black with cocoa colored head. Average head retention that leaves a distinct ring clinging to the glass. Very little carbonation. Would like to see better head for a stout. Most impressive aspect of the appearance is the viscosity of the beer and the caramel legs that cling to the glass when aerating.  Scent: Vanilla and caramel aroma is amazing. The bourbon odor is also detectable. A coffee scent is more subtle, but it comes out as it warms. Very little hops or roasted barley in the aroma.  Taste: Heavily dominated by the caramel, vanilla, and coffee. Pretty much tastes like it smells with a bit of a bite that may have been picked up from the bourbon barrel. Hops are indistinct but provide a nice soft bitterness to cleanse the palate. Very little aftertaste. Again, very little roasted barley flavor.  Mouthfeel: Wonderful fullness to compliment the rich aromas and flavor. Very light carbonation but comes out with gentle swirl.  Drinkability: Drinks more like a liqueur than a beer. It certainly warms the body on a cold winters evening and would be a great accompaniment to a cigar.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Hosts a deep chocolate brown head that fades a little to quick. Nose is amazingly sweet and port like. It includes notes of real vanilla, anise and toffee. As I take the first sip let me just say: wow! This beer is huge. Amazing collection of flavors dance together on the mouth such as raisan, burnt malt, anise, cough syrup, and hints of silky chocolate on the end. A massive belly warmer.

A - Black...opaque black...octupus ink black. this is the start of my third bottle....try as I might, and can't raise a head...maybe it's my age.  S - If double stout's are supposed to smell like cheap soy sauce, it's all good. Something tells me they're not. I got a second opinion, once again, from my 13 year old son. ""Smells like tamari, Dad"" Opinion confirmed.  T - This is a total and complete departure from the above. Coffee, brandied raisins, chocolate, dark rum, bourbon...unbelievably complex in its' variety. Really, really good.  M - Very full and long lasting, especially taking into account the ABV. Very little throat burn, but definately a kick at the end that rips across the palate and clears the way for the next hit.  D - I'm at home, and am staying that way. Drinkable?

1549,10672,WeisGuy,3.95,"Thanks to HimerMan for getting me my first bottle of this fine brew. 2006 Vintage.  a - pours quite viscous and jet black, tiny khaki head with retention around the edges and a spot in the middle, slight lacing  s - burnt malt, bittersweet chocolate, and alcohol dominate the aroma, faint hints of oak and vanilla provide greater depth  t - quite a bit of sweetness up front, molasses in with dark roasted malt and chocolate in the body, finish is somewhat sweet with a strong alcohol presense  m - full-bodied, viscous, little carbonation, dry finish  d - great sipping beer, but I wouldn't classify it as overly drinkable, alcohol is a bit too present for me to have more than one of these, but that is what's intended with this brew I'm guessing  Very good brew overall. I do wish that the oak/vanilla flavors were a bit more evident. I would love to age a couple of these for a year of two to see how the flavor develops.

1549,10672,brewandbbq,4.67,"Vintage dated 1/5/05  Pours oily black and viscous, with not a trace of a head that developes even with an exagerated pour. Almost perfectly opaque, with the exeption being the very edge of the body shimmering a crimson-mahogany hue. The first whiff has a surprising buisuity note, followed by bourbon, chocolate syrup, and cocoa-dusted espresso beans. Further aromatics reveal a slight oaky woodiness, brownie batter, whisky, and shades of kahlua, vanilla, and leather. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Carbonation is extremely mild and barely a notch above a cask ale. The pallet delivers big time. Rich and luscious, with a dark chocolate backbone and a bourbon-steeped espresso exterior. The bourbon is complementary to the essence of the brew, and a testament to the art of blending barrels. Alcohol is warming at 11%, but the sheer tastiness of the beer keeps you coming back quickly. Finishes with lingering bakers chocolate, kona roast, and malt whiskey. I can only speculate that this example has become perfectly balanced in it two years in the cellar.

1549,10672,kajerm,4.65,"vintage 2006, bottle, purchased at a very very very nice grocery store. pours gravity-well black with a neat one-finger tan head that stands up pretty well. this is a gorgeous beer, I could stare at it for hours.  it has a really powerful smell, chocolate and coffee with spiciness and definite malt. what I smell (and taste) most of all, though, is alcohol. the flavor is super-complex, though, and I'm probably too dumb to come close to describing it all. maltiness and alcohol run the show, but there's a delicate balance of other things going on that I might be able to pick out if all that booze (it's really 13%, not 11.) the beer is nice and chewy, but maybe a little thin for the style, which works in its favor, actually.  the alcohol drops drinkability to nil. when I opened one fresh, I couldn't even finish it. after I let it sit for a month and half or so, it had calmed down a lot, revealing a fantastic flavor profile, but it was still all blurred together by the alcohol.  I got another four-pack, and I'm laying them down for as long as I can stand. some aging could make this into a really legendary beer.  RERATE: Aged for three months-- wow, this is so awesome. The bite has calmed down (although it's still there in force), and the chocolate note has pretty much disappeared entirely. Coffee has chilled out a little, but it's definitley present. This is exactly what I hoped would happen-- the uncompromising, ass-kicking ethanol has taken a back seat and the other stuff in the beer is able to shine.  And damn, that other stuff is good. Dark fruit, and some unusual malt notes. The wood and bourbon flavors are much more noticeable. There is something surprisingly belgian about the flavor-- maybe it's the fruitiness and the unreal sick awesome malt blend.  Drinkability is way up, but this stuff is still basically tasty motor oil.  RERERATE: sweet zombie jesus, this stuff just gets better the longer I sit on it.  RERERERATE: At one year out, I'd consider selling myself into white slavery for another bottle of this god among beers.

1549,10672,RidiculedDisplay,4.64,"Brewed in 2006.  Poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Quite pretty coming out of the bottle - a dark, dark, dark, dark crude. There is no head at all in my bottle, and the tiniest bit of barely-perceptible lacing. Still, the body is a slight notch above other stouts (hard to do, in my opinion), so I like it. Still, if you look at my other reviews I'm a sucker for heads and especially lacing, and this doesn't deliver in those departments.  Smell: Dear lord in heaven this is an amazing stout. Almost smells like an Old Ale up front - that intensely strong, nutty alcohol. Then your olfactory capabilities register that what you're smelling is the deep, charred oak characteristic of a nice bourbon. Wonderful. Following that is vanilla, deep dark chocolates with nutty fillings, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Just huge, intense flavors that meld exceptionally well.  Taste: I'm floored. Dark cherries, dark chocolate, black licorice, candy sugar, bourbon of course, oak, a slight alcohol, and on the end the sip the most pronounced espresso flavor I've ever tasted in a stout, and I've tasted a lot of them. And good espresso, too. Just absolutely wonderful, huge stout flavors that make for one of the biggest, baddest, most wonderful beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Exceptional.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated nicely, otherwise thick and coffee-like. There is little to no burn considering the ABV. Good.  Drinkability: The ABV is hard to find in the mouth, although it does exist pretty assertively in the nose.

Taste is super rich chocolatey sweetness, with a tinge of dark fruits in the middle, and partially submerged alcohol in the close and aftertaste, which warms the soul.

Both flavors grow together until the bourbon simply explodes...vapors shoot to the nasal cavity while vanilla and butterscotch begin blending with the chocolate. A roasted personality begins to take shape around the middle of the tongue and takes root, adding more dimension to this already intense brew.

When well-mixed, the bourbon aroma is absolutely intoxicating (see my review of bottled Curieux).  T: This stout accepts the responsibility that comes with the name bourbon! The first sensations to register on the tongue are sickly sweet bourbon notes, some vanilla, brown sugar and butter flavors all shine. The stout is fully enveloped by the bourbon character, allowing those flavors to run the gamut from start to finish. I struggle to find any roasted, chocolatey malt body, but the fantastic bourbon character steals the limelight.  M: The bourbon character is well done here, imparting some nice flavors that I think could overpower something less powerful than a double stout.

1549,10672,orfeu,4.87,"2006 bottling. Many thanks to czoch75 for sending me a sample. Served at cellar temperature. Pours extremely viscously into a 17-ounce snifter, with only a thin wisp of burnt ochre foam that quickly disperses to a miniscule ring on top of a ponderous, tar-like body that is as black ""as the night itself, Mayor."" The nose is outright decadent, with boozy vanilla, toffee, chocolate, and rum-soaked raisin aromas. An almost medicinal dark berry essence wafts up as well, with slight coffee notes emerging here and there. Extremely complex bouquet, to say the least. And the taste exhibits at least as much complexity, if not more. But first, there is the mouthfeel: it is a velvety, chewy, expansive, creamy oil-slick, with a beguilingly syrupy quality that causes the beer to roll around the entire palate, almost to the point where it threatens to escape in order to coat the lips. Amazing. The taste, now: dark chocolate bitterness, with liquified cacao nibs melds with black bourbon-infused cherries coated with the thinnest of toffee-mocha candy shells. A sharp, alcohol nip at the finish, along with some vanilla coffee roast flavor. Mild to medium oaky tannins throughout, with a lingering woody pucker that remains alongside some chewy date booziness in the aftertaste. This is a stellar sipping experience as of right now, one that begs to be drawn out for as long as possible.

Aroma is a nice blend of charred oak, nuts, smoke and alcohol, while the flavor floows in the same footsteps. The interesting thing about this full-bodied beer was that different sips seemed to yield different presence of the 11% alcohol, regardless of the temperature.

A: Pure black, tiny tan head raised only by the most vigorous of pours. Pours like used motor oil.  S: HUGE bourbon aroma, vanilla, brown sugar, subtle clove or spice, did I mention bourbon?  T: The huge bourbon nose steps aside to let other things come out to play. Vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and molassas all make their presence felt.  M: Thick like molassas in January. Thick and coating. You'll definately want to finish up your night with this-the tastebuds will be cashed.  D: It's crazy that this beer can be considered so drinkable. If you were to judge this by nose alone you would think that it would taste like pure bourbon. When you finally taste it it's so balanced and nuanced it's scary.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Zorro,4.85,"Sampled due to beerhandy and Blue Max BIF.  This pours as a thick and deeply red and brown colored beer that turns to black once it actually settles in the glass. A small reddish brown head forms and then disappears.  Intense Bourbon barrel aroma. I clearly smell this and it is sitting on a table 3 feet away from my nose. The smell is rich and sweet and very strongly of vanilla and whiskey. Caramel, toffee and chocolate mocha all are very strong in this. Very much a bourbon barrel beer.  Taste is sweet and a little bitter and intense with the flavors of vanilla and caramel in the first sip. Thick and intense, the whiskey and chocolate fight it out here to be the stronger flavor. After a while black licorice makes an appearance in the taste. An incredible ale. I quickly don't care WHAT the individual flavors are in this; I just want LOTS more of this stuff.  Mouthfeel is chocolate Milkshake.  Real hard to be objective about this beer it is just REALLY damn good. If you dislike thick beers and the taste of Bourbon you will absolutely HATE this beer. I myself LOVE this stuff.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Erdinger2003,4.17,"The beer pours out a nice little quarter inch head that dissapates after a little time. The color is black with brown edges and eventually is headless. The smell is great, molasses, sweet roastiness and dark fruit. The taste does have a little alcohol zing to it, but the roasty flavors come out as well. The mouthfeel is excellent and smooth, pours out very dense and you can feel that on your tongue. Overall this was a great beer, but I will let this one age a bit before bringing it out again, expecially since it's 5 dollars a bottle.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,terrabyte,4.72,"Pours one of the inkiest, blackest-black Ive ever seen. Has a very small head.  The aroma is rich with bourbon, chocolate, cherries and booze.  Flavor is even richer in taste with bourbon, chocolate, cherries and booze. Only when laying back in my chair by a campfire have I felt the stress leap off me so completely and instantly as my first sip of this beer. The booze warms your chest and then your belly. Your face flushes. Although Ive only mentioned a few ingredients, each one is perfect for each other, and are very bold, deep and aged.  Mouthful is silky, boozy, and slightly burns. But it burns oh so good.  Drinkability is definitely a sipper, but an excellent one. Each mouthful is heaven. My only complaint is the cost. Usually this 4-pak will sell for $20. Grays has something very similar on tap for less money. I'm not blaming Goose Island, I'm blaming my job for not paying me more so that I can drink this every day.  Many thanks to buckeyenation for just giving this to me. I didnt realize at the time just how generous of a gesture it was!

1549,10672,blitz134,4.43,"Yeah, this one is really black. Took a few seconds for the light chocolate head to show up, came on about 1/4"" thick. Reduced to a sporadic skim on top with spots of glassy black pools.  Dark roasted malts form the backbone here with a good dose of bitter dark chocolate. Some borders on a touch charred. Some sweet dark fruits come in as well. I dont really pick up on the bourbon in the aroma although some light alcoholic aromas come through. On reinspection if I really look for the bourbon it is there but nowhere near as prominant as I would expect here, hopefully its in the flavor. I'm not disappointed by the aroma, but there are others in the same category that do just as well.  This beer is loaded with flavor. As the bottle refers to malts overflowing the mashtun, this beer has flavor overflowing my glass. I'm afraid I'm gonna need more than 12oz to full capture this, but I'll try on this one sample. Lots of choclate and dark toasted malts to start with, has some toffee flavors in it. Then it turns a little sweet with the dark fruits and quickly the alcohol sets it. Its almost a little too much alcohol but it works okay in this big beer. The bourbon is definately evident in the very finish, those woody and liquor edges show themselves. The only complaint in this fresh bottle is that it might be a touch hot.  Body is huge, creamy and oily coating the tongue and is goes down. Flavor lingers for a while. Low carbonation works perfectly.  This is definately a sipper of a beer. Tons of complex flavors, hot alcohol, and a huge body. One has to sip this to fully enjoy it. It only takes a sip to get so much from this one. I definately want more but tonight this is probably all I can take with how heavy it sits.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,malcontent,4.87,"2006 version  Pours a light-devouring black from which the thick tan head materializes a few seconds after pouring. The thin head sticks around for only a moment before becoming a ring of lacing around the edges.  This is one of those brews that if I couldn't taste and only sniff I'd still come out better than having drunk a mediocre beer. Lots of vanilla with a bunch of toasted oats, rye bread, and traces of chocolate. The alcohol is detectable but only faintly which is an impressive cover-up for the ABV. Mmmm.  A sweet initial taste that is a strawberry-short of Neopolitan. Complex malt with outstanding bourbon characteristics on the finish. Undercurrents of coffee (although less so than many stouts) and smoke. Rich and simply sublime.  Looove the mouthfeel as it completely coats the tongue, which, when packing the flavors this does makes for a luxurious experience. Creamy, thick, and possessing an unexpected level of carbonation.  Drinkability was almost a ""5"" until I got to the end and realized I was nowhere near as sober as when I'd started. Still, for the incredible way this warms while simultaneously covering the alcohol this is crazy quaffable.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,chadspivey,3.95,"thanks to whoknew for the opportunity. tried the 2006 version, so it's not aged.  A: dark as hell, pretty much black. very little carbonaton.  S: dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, smoke. This smell is really weird and almost offensive at first, but grows on ya.  T: There's something really weird going on here. Not bad, just weird as hell. It's a beer you've gotta get used to for sure. It gets way better with the finish, dark chocolates, and caramel, vanilla.  M: very impressive mouthfeel. velvety, smooth, quite nice. alcohol warms the throat.  D: There's no way i'd drink more than two of these. I actually felt the alcohol after a couple of sips, and i'm no lightweight. Besides, this is a double stout and the flavor just doesn't allow for drinkability. But considering the style, it's not so bad.  Overall: Maybe I'm just not ready for a double stout. I thought I was ready for any beer. At least I know I haven't come to a plateau with beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TheLongBeachBum,4.37,"Presentation: 12 ounce bottle sealed with a crown cap decorated with a black, gold & white logo. A small tight neck label is cream colored with a black border and a year 2006 above a row of four stars, well the third star is in fact replace with a goose head. The main label is very Spartan; the words Bourbon County Stout are set into a wealth of smaller black text on the cream colored background. Strength Listed at 11% ABV on the front label with a Bottled On This Date of 070306 with a recommendation that this will keep for over five years.  Appearance: Gelatinous thick black body which seems to embrace and contain the dissolved carbonation to such an extent that it refuses to let it out on the pour; only when it settles does some of conditioning escape to form a short-lived thin dark brown covering, but that too soon disappears leaving only a prune juice appearance. Subsequent top-ups reinstate a thinning head but sadly this brew never benefits from a real head to speak of, that said, the swirled look in my Stone Russian Imperial Stout Glass is still one of a great brew and the accompanying aural fizz from each massage of the glass is fantastic. Funny thing is (I just returned to this part of my Review) the final top-up produced a fine looking dark tan head that only lasted for 30 seconds or so.  Nose: Intense aromas; soft bourbon trails a stronger vanilla and higher Coconut with some dark chocolate too. Cocoa beans, burnt toast and roasted coffee linger in the finish. A strong nose that develops complexity as it warms.  Taste: It is hard to part from the tastes on the initial sip, as the nose is pummeled by the strong aromas at the same time the mouth experiences the wonderful flavors. Trapped in a thick black liquid glass volcanic lava flow there is a rich dark malt base swirled with coconut shavings, molasses, vanilla, bonfire toffee, dark chocolate, raisins, dark rum, cigar smoke and bourbon chasers with some peat laden smoked oak casks to add a parched dryness to the finish. Complex and intense with a deeply entrained assortment of rich, thick, strong tastes. Superb!  Mouthfeel: Thick syrup flows onto the palate with an intensely warming backdrop to the swallow. Slick and oily, viscous and sly, rich and rewarding. It s 11% but the strength is on the back drop to the warming heat in the gullet.  Drinkability: It was a slow partner overall, but it never disappointed and at times I found myself slowing down with this one, such was its gorgeous cross-section of flavors that needed closer inspection.  Overall: This was a monstrous offering, an immensely warming brew that comforted. The whole 12 ounce sipped like a fine Brandy and lasted the whole 90 minutes whilst I watched Saturdays EPL footy match between Manchester United and Manchester City all over again. This feels like one of those brews where the closer you are to danger the further you are from harm.

Very pretty brown head formed, but faded quickly. Bourbon, oak, vanilla are all present as advertised. I get some dark cherry notes. Man this beer is gonna kick my ass. This beer has tons of body for as much alcohol thats in it. Each drink comes with the burn of a shot of bourbon. Im guessing that it is still pretty green, so in six month or a year.

Sticky lace patterns form on the sides of the glass.  Big aroma of roasted malts, raisins, brown sugar, coco and a bit of smoke. There is a whiff of alcohol as well.  Wow, there is a lot going on with the taste. Charred malts, sugary dark fruits, roasted coffee, and wood smoke. There is a bit of sweetness and a rich coco taste as you work through the beer. Some vanilla & molasses cookie taste late. There is a nice complexity to the beer that revels itself as you drink it. Im impressed by how well the alcohol is hidden.

The aroma of the beer was of roated coffee, intense malt, licorice, chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol.  The flavor of the beer was intesely malty. Chocolate, coffee, chewy malt, and notes of licorice made up the bulk of the flavor. The bourbon notes peaked through with some vanilla and oak accents. The hops hit towards the finish and helped balance out some of the sweetness of the beer.  The carbonation was perfect. The mouthfeel was heavy and almost oily thick.

Pours with nearly no head into a pint glass. initial appearance and nose remind me greatly of the harveistoun OEO special reserve, unsurprisingly.  nose is of beer-soaked bourbon (it is a distinct nose when you have seen it before), and a hint of cookies as well. Assuming wood was used in this beer (I assume, don;t know) the tannins and vanilla-like notes are quite apparent along with the whiskey.  taste clearly carries whiskey in the front end, pretty much buries the rest at first but it isn't overwhelming. as it passes I am left with this more typical oak-aged stout, not very roasted but very heavy, until the aftertaste, where the whisky comes back into prominence. The 11% is invisible, I didn't even know it was that strong until I wrote these words.

Poured into a nonic, a tan brown head developed and lingers a centimeter thick on surface of the body. I assume that my pour was at fault for that. The body is a dark coffee black brown color. Smells of intense sweet licorice, and raisons. The taste is very rich and sweet, not milky thick, but definitely substantial. Lots of sweet malts licorice not so much bourbon, like I'd hoped, but some seriousness all the same (its very strong). This is a very interesting beer, its more of a special occasion beer.

Flavors of wood, dark chocolate, coffee, roast, with a slight top shelf bourbon. Mouth feel is creamy, almost like a milkshake, medium/high body, medium carbonation. It had a large head with a almost milk chocolate color, tan really does not do it justice. With being well balance, not too overwhelming in the bourbon character, but leaving a subtle hint of it.

Complex taste consisting of bourbon, vanilla, dark coffee, and a huge roasted malt pressence and some alcohol as well.  Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy with a good carbonation level. Almost a little syrupy though.  Heavy alcohol pressence brings the drinkability down some. This is a very good beer and worth the high price tag if you are into intense stouts.

1549,10672,ngandhi,5,"In an era of great American stout, Goose Island's 2006 Bourbon County Stout is the world's greatest. It might be the greatest beer ever made.  Sure, the flavors are all familiar--dark chocolate, espresso, and maduro tobacco--but each is coated here with buttery oak that gives it texture available in no other bottled product on the planet.  I'm very skeptical of this new swath of bourbon-aged everything--including Scotch--hitting the market today. With beer especially, the bourbon tastes usually comes to dominate, which always leaves me wanting a glass of Noah's Mill or Blanton's over the rest of my pint.  That's why this is the greatest stout on the planet. Goose Island has done what no other brewery has figured out how to do, which is to use the oak to bring out more flavors in the beer, instead of overwhelm them. So the silky chocolate taste is really a flourless cake, the tobacco is really a 1926 Padron, and the espresso was just roasted this morning at Vivace to wake me from a long, wanton dream.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Sephiroth,4.77,"Bottled on 7-3-06. Pours black as night, faintly carbonated. Aroma of booze, bourbon, faint smoke, and vanilla.  This is the most complex barrel-aged stout I have had to date. And it's not about the number of flavors, but the way they are distinct and separate from each other. Chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, smoke, and roasted/burnt grains. Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy, definitely chewy. Insanely drinkable, though if you drink this quickly, you will miss some subtleties.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Winter,3.63,"Bottled 8/14/05.  Pours black with a brown head. Aroma consists of vanilla, bourbon, oak, maple and not surprising at 11%... alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied. This is no doubt a bourbon laced stout. Oak and vanilla are noticed right from the start. The bourbon flavor seems to completely take over and dominate any other typical stout flavors this beer may have had. GIBCS is heavy and boozey. Even after 15 month this beer still seems unbalanced and needs more time to mellow out. The label does say this can age and change for up to five years and it would nice to set aside a bottle and forget about it, just to see what happens. Overall I was a little disappointed. I expected a smoother and more complex offering. I do enjoy the taste of bourbon quite a bit, but the flavor on this one is still a mess.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Taste is a dark black sweetness that warms you up . The dark coffee fruityness with caramel sweets ends up in a warm alcohol blanket of hoppy bitterness.

1549,10672,emerge077,4.6,"Year old bottle.  Drizzles into a wide chalice, poured very slowly, intentionally trying to create some foam. It works, some irregular bubbles stretch over the surface, that slowly succumb to the strength of the stout. A ring of milk chocolate froth clings to the rim of the glass. Served at a cool cellar temp.  Whiff of mild vanilla, and a hint of bourbon. Mysteriously, the aroma hides the onslaught of flavor that will roll out soon after. First sip is a slow burst of chocolate, vanilla, oak, and of course, bourbon. The barrel aging and cellaring has melded this stout symbiotically with bourbon in an unbelievable way. Alcohol has mellowed with time, which furthers the drinkability aspect. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee hang on the palate in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is silky, infinitely smooth and rich. This is a rare treat.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BuckeyeNation,4.82,"Charred oak barrel black with a wee glimmer of burnt umber at the bottom edge of the glass. Light simply has no chance. The small, dark caramel colored cap isn't as creamy as expected, nor as sticky. I'm sure the 11.0% ABV has a lot to do with it, but I like a bit more eye candy. This is one serious looking stout, though.  The aroma is outstanding. This is exactly what a stout aged in bourbon barrels ought to smell like. An insane amount of heavily roasted barley greets my nose with every sniff. In addition, there's plenty of dark caramel, dark brown sugar, vanilla and glorious bourbon whiskey. With a bit more power and a bit more aggressiveness, it'd be perfect.  The flavor *is* perfect. Absofreakinlutely perfect! It doesn't hurt that I love bourbon because those 100 days in the barrel were 100 days well and efficiently spent. If bourbon whiskey isn't your thing, then I'd suggest drinking another beer. This one positively oozes that glorious spirit. Unlike some beer of this sub-style, the proportion of stout to whiskey is juuust right.  The flavor profile consists of bittersweet chocolate, brown sugar, dark butterscotch, crushed vanilla beans, charred oak, a splash of ouzo and a tendril or two of smoke. The whiskey adds a certain wee heavy character, although there's no peatiness since bourbon is the whiskey of choice rather than Scotch. It's amazing how each sip is better than the last. Where will it end?  I'm a bit surprised at the sweetness, but probably shouldn't be given the gargantuan amount of malt. The mouthfeel is full (without being ponderous), heavily silky, polished gemstone-like and nicely chewy on the back end. Carbonation must be present, though you'd never know it. Perfect score. Again.  I expected one whole helluva lot from Bourbon County Stout. All the more amazing, then, that it blew right past those expectations as if they were sitting still. This remarkable beer is easily the best that I've ever had from Goose Island. It's a true American original and is the perfect marriage of double stout and bourbon. The next time I see BCS, I plan to clear out the store.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Bierguy5,4.52,"Bottled on 081605. 11 % ABV. Pours pitch black with no highlights at all. Thick foamy mocha head disappears very quickly, leaving no lace, and not much of a collar either. Oaky, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate, and coffee in the aroma along with some hot alcohol. Very thick and chewy, with almost no carbonation, which seems to fit in very well. Warming from the alcohol. Flavor starts out with chocolate, burbon and oak, it then fades into a bit of dark fruit, and finishes with a long dose of coffee that lingers for quite some time. The bourbon character has added a great touch, and has probably settled down a bit with some age. A very solid and complex brew here.

Appearance Black as coal with a light tan coloured head. Adequately carbonated, and no lacings.  Aroma And what aroma! Buttery and nutty bourbon, oak, vanilla, burnt malts with scents of chocolate and coffee, and treacle.

1549,10672,bainard,5,"From bottle to pub glass.  A - Hybrid of cough syrup and black hole with a khaki head. The first time I tried it, I knew I was in for it. Now, I just give in and let the smooth syrup soothe me.  S - Bourbon, as to be expected, caramel, dark cocoa, vanilla, perhaps a little coffee or cinnamon? No, it's just bourbon.  T - Oh my goodness. The wallop of the whiskey serves to make the drinker submissive enough to let the flavors (whiskey, malt, chocolate, butterscotch-caramel, molasses) take over. It's just shocking enough to grab your attention, and flavorful enough to keep you wanting more. Starts off with bourbon, the middle is a candy store, and the finish is a harmony of the two with a hard-to-pinpoint aftertaste that you get from any good stout.  M - I cannot wait to try this aged. The immaturity of the strong alcohol is a clever mask for a smooth, velvet-y concoction that provides an epiphanal experience. The carbonation is minimal, but enough to let this beauty ballet across your mouth. Thick, but manageable, consistency akin to 2% milk.  D - This isn't an everyday beer, nor would I ever want it to be. I was overwhelmed, and then I fell in love with it. BCS is my special occasion beer. It's been described by friends of mine as ""life-changing"". Ultimately, I hold other brews to this standard of sensory assault and surprising nuance. It's drinkable in the sense that when I want a rare, yet wonderful sort of beer, I go for this, no questions.

Hints of vanilla and finishes with a heavy boozy bourbon taste. This is a huge beer. Very thick and chewy, and one of theses bad boys will fill you up. Lots of alcohol heat on the way down, maybe a little too much. Not a bad beer at all, if you like heat and strong boozy flavors this beer is for you.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bluejacket74,4.35,"Served in a goblet, the beer pours black with a small dark brown head which doesn't stick around for too long. Obviously, it smells primarily like bourbon, and very sweet smelling overall. Some other smells that come through are vanilla, chocolate, malt and molasses. It tastes the same way to me, but with some coffee taste in there too, and a bittersweet aftertaste. I could definitely notice the alcohol in this beer. A lot of different flavors hit me all at once with this beer, it's a real ""big"" beer. It also has a big full body, with a creamy, slick, chewy mouthfeel to it. At first all the taste and alcohol hit me pretty good, but after a while I got used to drinking it. This is definitely a sipping beer, there's no way I could drink this quickly. I'd definitely recommend this to others, it's another really good beer from Goose Island.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,timtheenchanta,3.2,"Pitch black syrupy liquid. Very small dark brown head. No lacing.  Smells of sugary candy, bourbon and wood. Really like a bourbon candy. Slight vanilla smell perhaps?  Huge thick malty feel with loads of sugary bourbon taste. This is not to far from being a julep gone horribly sugary. There's alcohol and oak flavors which completely hijack the finish and dry it out. I'm not really sure why this one tastes so over-the-top sugary. Other than that it's great. Maybe with a year or so on this bottle I would have enjoyed it more. It's close to being a big favorite of mine but it's too sweet and missing that extra nod of flavor. No denying this is a crazy big brew though.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,MuddyFeet,4.2,"Chewy, vinous and succulent.  If I could melt dark chocolate bars into a big vat and pour it into a glass. That's the color of this beer. With just a slight layer of carbontaion scum resting on top. Nose is chocolate and bitterness. Very pungent. Like walking through a forest with mushrooms growing everywhere.  Flavor was at first a bit over the top. But as sson as I adjusted I noticed how balanced and almost purposeful the flavors all are. They complement each other rather than vie for dominance. Lots of dark chocolate and bitterness. Bits of licorice come through storngly. Oddly, no coffee. Or at least none that I can pick out. The alcohol is hidden nicely and I don't really taste it but rather feel it tingling on my tongue. Lots of tannins very grapey. Extremely full bodied. Really stretches out the tongue. Very nice beer.More of a slow sipping beer to savor.  My head is running with ideas to add this to a chocolate cake recipe somehow...",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,AlexJ,4.7,"My first Goose Island brew and a very impressive one at that. Abyssal black pour that is thick and viscous produces a very fine, thin head of mocha that leaves some thick lacing at the top of my chalice.  Aroma is dark and seductive, with tons of charred black and chocolate malts, powdery cocoa, molasses, vanilla, toasty oak, creamy bourbon, anise, and some light evergreen hops.  Flavor is HUGE, a massive onslaught of bittersweet malt, very dark chocolate, coffee, marshmellow fluff, and a strong barrel-aged character of toasty vanilla oak chips and smooth Bourbon. No alcohol heat as some other reviews indicated(although I suspect that Bruskiator's been holding this for some time!)  Body is as big as they get, with low carbonation and a chewy, creamy mouthfeel and slippery, oily texture. Like melted silk on the palate. A superb barrel-aged beer.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,kmcnair,3.58,"12 oz bottle, bottling date of 01/05/05.  Pours an extremely viscous motor oil black and makes a very tiny bit of tanned head, a swirl of the glass leaves legs of syrupy sweet stout.  Aroma is deep chocolate, caramel, toffee, soy sauce, alcohol and a very subtle woodsy vanilla from the oak.  Taste is very hot, alcohol isn't masked too well, medium bourbon notes, vanilla, rich roasted and burnt caramel flavors mingle with chocolate and coffee.  Very full bodied, velvety texture on the palate, hot warming alcohol that burns as it goes down and ultimately leads to a dry finish. Carbonation level is very low. Leaves a thick coating on the palate.  At nearly 1.5 years old, I'm guessing this bottle could be laid down for at least another 3 years before it will reach it's potential. It has a number of good things going on, but it is still way too hot. Would try again with much longer cellaring.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I detect a lot of oakiness and vanilla. It does smell alot like bourbon. Also some dark fruits, marshmallow and coffee notes.  The taste is so intense and full flavored. Perhaps the most intense beer I've ever had. Charred oak is the most dominant flavor, as well as some sweet dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and plenty of strong alcoholic notes.  Mouthfeel is good. Thick and creamy, with low carbonation.  There is no way I would be able to have more than one of these. Nor would I want to. This is quite an intense beer-drinking experience.

1549,10672,nflmvp,3.82,"Thanks to robertdoesbeer for this sample. Received it today and threw it right in the fridge.  Poured aggressively and only got about a one finger head which disappated to a ring of foam around the edge.  Smelled somewhat sweet and malty with fruity overtones. My thought is prunes or raisins. Smell reminds me of the Sam Adams Triple Bock.  Taste is similar with something of a soy sauce quality thrown in. The alcohol is not very well masked.  Mouthfeel is thick and coating with a light, tingly finish, due to the alcohol.  Drinkability is OK but I wonder if this one wouldn't benefit from some extra time in the cellar.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Some definite smoky aromas, along with coffee like roasted malts and some vanilla. More roast and smokiness up front in the taste, a quite large sweet bourbon follows with some warming alcohol in the finish. The alcohol is not overpowering but definitely assertive, and the bourbon sweetness is nicely balanced with the roasted malts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TastyTaste,4.97,"Big thanks to ThomasHardy for this unexepected bottle.  Appearance: Jet black body, hard to get much out of a head from the inky depths that pour into my chalice. The head that does come is dark tan, and very small.  Smell: Big boozy bourbon strikes you up front, this makes my mouth water, as I have been jonesing for barrel-aged offerings lately. Rich and chocolatey, coffee, vanilla, very dense, like a rum-soaked brownie. I could wear this as a cologne.  Taste: Wow, what flavors. Much like OA Yeti, the flavors are big and strong, fortified by an insane bourbon taste that is spot on. Vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and a very large hop presence (and another show of espresso) round out the taste, I really like this beer, very well done. One of the best I have had from Goose Island.  Mouthfeel: Rich and full, slick, smooth, a great sipping brew.  Drinkability: I can't wait until this beer is released for the first time in Minnesota later this summer. I will be stocking up, this beer is fantastic.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SCW,4.74,"Jet black with half-inch of beige head.  Aroma? Vanilla with currants, bourbon maple syrup.  Tastes like three buttermilk pancakes with hot maple syrup rolled up into each bottle. Slight pleasant alcohol warmth in the aftertaste. Mild coffee bitterness complimented by subdued hops. Deep treacle toffe and burnt carmalized sugar twinge. A divine creation.  Turbid and viscous oily consistency. Velvety finish, flavors sliced up like DJ Shadow.  Drinkable in a brandy snifter....

1549,10672,Calico,4.04,"The best bourbon-aged beer I've ever tasted, this one sent me into a near-religious state of awe at first taste. The nose accosts you with malt, vanilla, tobacco, bourbon (of course), maple and rose notes. Such a phenolic heat it may as well be a 18% abv liqueur instead of the 11% abv beer it is. The alcohol seems to know how to detach itself and warm and coat the tongue. The finish is smooth. Mouthfeel is full bodied, well rounded.  I can't really place the style. It's not an Imperial Stout, not an American Double Stout, more a barleywine. Dark malt notes predominate throughout.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Initially in the nose I get an aroma of smoked meat, followed by a hint of sweet chocolate and a good whiff of alcohol. The taste is big on flavor and alcohol. Good flavor of roasted black chocolatey malt leaves a burnt, smokey finish. Really only light on the bitterness though. This beer has a nice sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is quite thick, lightly chewy, but smooth. Moderate carbonation is right on. Very tasty, and drinkable.

No lacing is left behind that there is little head retention. Smell is of subdued candied bourbon & American oak & rich caramel vanilla, bitter chocolate, raisins melted into a rich, sugary syrup, and perhaps a rich cherimoya sorbet in there as well. Obviously complex! Taste is of the same aromas...left in the barrel just the right amount of time. Mouthfeel is chewy, caramely sweet, smooth, slightly fizzy on the swallow with an alcohol burn. The ABV is evident before it even reaches the mouth. It almost burns the eyes as the glass approaches the nose and mouth. Drinkability is very candy like and addictive with intense flavors.

T: Dark fruit (prune & raisin), dark caramel, dark/bitter chocolate, dark roasted coffee with a little licorous & underlying oak. Assertive bitterness, but not overwhelming.  M: Full, syrupy body is a little chalky; carbonation is light to moderate.  D: This one's a sipper. Approachable & well rounded, with plenty of depth... but it is a quite full.

T - Once again the chocolate and bourbon came out first. Then there was molasses in there and some plums, but that was the end of it I guess. I didnt see much else.  M - Very big and chewy.

Pours as black as black can be. Head is tan and creamy.  Smell is bourbon chocolatey goodness. dark caramel malt and a touch of vanilla.  Taste is huge and rich, but smooth. Very creamy and sweet thick chocolate that is overtaken by a blast of bourbon and vanilla oakiness. Bourbon flavor is strong and warming, but extremely tasty. The addition of caramel, roasted nut and subdued fruit flavors add depth. Finish has lingering boubon and charred smokiness.  Mouthfeel is very chewy and thick. Amazing.  I really enjoy good bourbon, and I also like an imperial stout so this beer seems to be made for me. What an amazing beer. Very complex and so smooth. This beer is good to begin with.

I was drinking this beer on St. Patrick's day after my band played, sadly though it was straight from the bottle, due to there was no acceptable glasses to place beer in at my friend's house. So with this in mind I can't really answer the appearance and smell section due to the fact I couldn't see it and the smell was extremely concentrated which is why I market them as average because I cannot give an indepth answer. On to the beer, I liked it the taste was a stout without a doubt with a major bourbon after taste that knocked most of my friends over that tried it. The mouthfeel was thick and the drinkability I took it slow and probably couldn't drink another one in the same sitting.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Chocolate is present also. I can detect a slight Bourbon aroma, hence the name. Some dark fruit aroma is also present. As it warms, the Bourbon aroma gets stronger.  This beer has a dominate flavor of Bourbon. It is hard to pick out many other flavors. I detect a small chocolate flavor. I can taste the burnt malts. It tastes sweet. But mostly, just Bourbon.  This beer is carbonated well for the style. It is very full bodied. It has an aggressive mouthfeel. It warms the throat as it goes down. It leaves a Bourbon like aftertaste.  I dont know if this would be a good session beer. It has a very aggressive flavor. Also, the alcohol content is a bit high. I think this is a good beer, but I think it could use just a little less Bourbon.

Aroma of bourbon is quite powering as well as some chocolate and vanilla. Taste is a mix between some chocolate malt with hints of vanilla, coffee and oak. Bourbon presence is interesting but a bit too powerful for my liking since it brings too much alcohol, which is not something that I necessarily enjoy. Body is full and has a creamy texture, which I quite enjoy. Overall, this is a very interesting creation, which Im glad, got a chance to try but I feel I would probably prefer the non-barrel aged version more.

Nose is of what else but bourbon, vanilla, caramel, mollases, a little coffee, and American oak. One drink and you can tell this beer is something different, something big, and something special. Enormous amounts of wood but in a very good way adding complexity too the brew. Prune, dark unsweetened choclate, mollases, pure vanilla extract, and alcohol glide across the palate in a race for the most complex brew award. This is a very big, very masculine beer.

Chocolate. A little smoke. But everything takes a backseat to the ethanol. The alcoholic bitterness lingers long after the sip. Body is medium at best. It could use a little boost.

Dark fruits, raisins, molasses, plums, vanilla, oak, chocolate, coffee, and brown sugar flavors resonate..all resting on a thick, syrupy body that just sits on your tongue until you damn near have to scrape it off. The smoke character is very well done and, most importantly, not overdone. The alcohol has a definite warming effect starting as soon as it hits your lips and doesn't quit until the brew is finished.

Smells of whiskey mixed with caramel malt - lots of alcohol in the nose, some oak and vanilla but primarily a strong bourbon scent.  Taste is both powerful and amazing. Lots and lots of alcohol burn here - it's the first thing you notice and the last thing at the end of each sip. While impressive it's a bit unbalanced and the only thing keeping this from a perfect score. Clear, distince flavors of malt, caramel, whiskey, oak, vanilla and alcohol. Appropriately sweet but not overpowering. The flavors come in stages throughout the sip, each presenting themselves before the next comes on. Very engaging.  Mouthfeel is very good - medium heavy but lighter that the pour would lead you to believe. Quite a good bit of residual carbonation to lighten the palate.

Mouthfeel is chocolate syrup thick, but smooth and creamy. That 11% sure makes itself known and they tried to pack as much intense flavor to mask it as possible. Balanced? Not exactly. Delicious?

Initial smell was a bit disappointing but as this one warmed it got vastly better and I found chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and of course coffee aromas. Others have said how much the bourbon stands out, to me it was definately present, but I found the chocolate and coffee flavors to be much more dominant and much to my delight. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with low carbonation, just how I think it should be. I'm stuck on where to rate this for drinkability; it was very enjoyable throughout, but it is a sipper.

1549,10672,bultrey,4.05,"What a difficult beer to review. This is not a balanced beer by any means. You really have to like bourbon to like this beer... really. Poured into a large snifter, this was quite an amazing pour, thick viscous black with angry cappuccino-colored frothy head that recedes to just a ring around the glass. The smell might be the absolute best thing about this beer: coconut, chocolate (think almond joy candy bars), a little banana, and some noticable alcoholic fumes that are a fitting preview of what's to come. The taste introduces itself with just the slightest char, which is quickly smashed to bits by a straight-up bourbon flavor, but with a bit more malty goodness, as if you made a chocolate cake with bourbon (I have, and it's good), or perhaps had a black organic coffee with a hefty dose of bourbon. The alcohol is not that well-hidden, honestly, and that means drinkability is where I have to take off the points.

Flavor is still quite hot with alcohol, but more complex with the chocolate and roasted grain flavors coming through more clearly, and the vanilla notes from the barrel aging are very evident. The vanilla lingers on the pallet a bit, as does a light bourbon flavor. Mouthfeel is massively thick and chewy.  Overall: I think that given maybe two-three years in the cellar, this one could truly kick ass. As it is, it's a bit too boozy and hot with not quite enough complexity to really stand with the best stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,goodbyeohio,4.66,"brewed 1/2005, consumed 2/2006  nicotine-stained black, brown resin cascades down the glass behind the light brown creamy foam that is left.. tiny spots on the glass remind me this is beer, not liquor.  the nose of this beer is enveloped in a booze haze.. very deep caramel scent in its sweet whisky character. toffee notes collide with raw vanilla bean and burnt sugar crisp.  boy does this beer taste good. and not good like your regular favorite beer, but good like a special treat beer. after opening and taking the first sip, i thought, ""maybe i should have saved this for a special occasion!"". but like giamatti says in sideways, the beer IS the special occasion.. or wine. whatever. this creamy, caramel based stout is accentuated by carbon-charred sweet woody notes and the mossy character of the bourbon barrels. the bourbon stands out enough and the abv is high enough to bring this beer to the apex of quality, approaching the threshhold of fine aged liquor. earthy, spirit qualities linger in the boozy finish.. a true brew to savour and a sipper that has held up to a year like a champ.  body is thick yet smooth, a light brew this is not.. but a light brew i do not want from something with this flavor depth. i want to sip it, and i want to feel the velvet of each small, well-planned sip.  the best beer goose island has ever made, hands-down.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

I was waiting a long time to try this one and it did not dissapoint. black-hole black in colours, light absorbing black, blacker than black, or none-more-black, as the first spinal tap album is. Aromas of in your face hot bourbon. Evan williams or rebel yell maybe...but more likely the mark. Vanilla, cocoa, exotic fruits, and nuts all jump into the air and fill the olfactorys upon opening and pouring this beer. Taste is hot bourbon big ass roasted maltiness, vanilla, cocoa, fine dark french-press coffee and more. A real palate raper if there ever was one. Mouthfeel is thick as all hell and drinkability is great for such a big beer. Damn man this one is serious. Pricey? Yes, but worth it. I wish it was easy to get more!

1549,10672,stewart124,4.72,Thank you Pitstop Nelsonville. Pours jet black with a reddish brown head that sits atop a mohagany tinted brew. This head is thick but goes away after a little while. Leaves whisps of head along the top as you drink. Very strong smells of whiskey/bourbon with a oak or smoked or earthy smell. Intense tastes to say the least. Strong malts and aged in an oak cask leads to the very strong tasting beer that warms your stomach all the way down. Tastes of currants and vanilla along with dark chocolate and coffee. Smooth silky body with a thick oil feel to it all. As far as I could tell the hops were well masked by the malts and bourbon. This one really knocked me over and my tastebuds were ruined for the night. Really impressed with Goose Island on this one and I might as well have followed this up with a snifter of bourbon.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100

Dark as espresso with a deep cocoa head. Faint raspberry crimson highlights. Froths up very nicely with some swirling, replenishing the head. Lacing isn't all too great; spotty at best.  S - Oaky bourbon, vanilla and dark chocolate. Notes of black licorice and acacia. Dark molasses malt, dry and dark sweet bread. Fantastic.  T - Mild up front with burnt caramel -- much like the top of a Creme Brulee. Mocha. The middle brings a brown sugar sweetness. The finish is drying with a hint of hops. The aftertaste is buttery, with big bourbon notes (Think hot-buttered Maker's Mark). Strangely enough, the big bourbon only makes its entrance after the swallow. Given the big alcohol, the afterglow is very comfortably warming.  M - Slight, very subtle carbonation. Mouthfeel is viscous and full of presence. Slick, quick, and coating finish. Nice.  D - Easy and amazingly smooth given the ABV. Enjoy this one as an excellent after dinner drink. Savor it... and take your time. This one is worthy of your full attention.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DrJay,4.37,"Inky, thick pour produced a thin chocolatey head. It settled quickly to a ring, but remained throughout and left fine, spotty lacing. Wow, what an aroma! The first thing I thought of was a really earthy, leathery, dark red wine, but then the vanilla, oak, and alcohol hit me. Definitely whisky. There's a rich roasted quality as well, but this is overpowered by everything else. Malty and sweet with a fair bit of chocolate starts things off on the first sip, followed by massive whisky/alcohol and vanilla in the middle. It mellows out again at the end, with chocolate and roast coming forward again, and it finishes with lingering alcohol warmth. Low carbonation and quite creamy. Full bodied, almost heavy, but not cloying at all. Alcohol is a bit aggressive, but appropriate. This is a ""take no prisoners"" kind of beer, really big and not apologetic about it. Fabulous.

Served in a tasting tulip at cellar temperature, amongst BAs Epseja and Ego after dinner.  Appearance- Watery, yet thick, almost black. The tan head breaks apart rather quickly, leaving just a rim after a few minutes.  Smell- Booze soaked chocolate. Oak barrels. Alcohol. Fudge brownies. Totally unique and full, this one I will remember for a long time.  Taste- Black licorice soaked in alcohol, heavy and syrupy. Burnt and intensely malty, with a dry, bittering finish that evaporates whatever saliva is left in your mouth.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thick and buttery, real heavy in the mouth.

I had the 2007 in 2012 and it was rich and smooth, 4.25 territory.  I had the regular on tap 5 years later and it was pretty good and well integrated bourbon. Black colour, and scored that for this review.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bditty187,4.77,"Scary black in hue; in fact it is completely black, when I held it to a light the beer actually absorbed the light. Impressive! Russet head, on the pour the foam created only a sliver of a finger. The head wasnt imposing and it quickly faded to a soapy collar. Im happy the collar kept the liquid company but Im saddened (but not surprised) there was no lacing. On the whole, if nothing else the darkness is extraordinary and this beer looks great in my goblet.  So you like whisky? So you like stout? How about both at the same time? Apparently this is the beer for you and me! Vanilla, oak chips, the alcohol heat stings my nose, charred wood (but not smoky) like it was burned by an intense but short-lived fire. Chocolate covered nuts, semi-sweet cocoa candy, some leather, earth, molasses, and kisses of dark fruit. This is the first beer I can think of that I smell coconut! Nifty. The nose is imposing. Sure, it is inviting but Im fearful of the potential boldness of the booze on the palate. High potency, thunderous at times, I am deeply impressed because even in the face of all the power I can still tell this is a well-crafted beer.  The beery aspects of this beer are secondary and, seemingly restrained. Maybe the whisky, oak, vanilla notes are just that vocal on the palate. The roasted malts get lost a bit. I find it mainly at the back plus some charred wood (again, not smoky), semisweet chocolate, roasted nuts slathered in a coco-caramel glaze with a side of raisins, dates, and figs. I love the alcohol heat, it is warming and relaxing. Sherry. Port. Earlier I called this beer retrained let me correct myself. This Stout is extremely well-crafted. The flavors melt seemingly into one enjoyable beer, there is great depth. I wonder what this beer would taste like sans the barrel aging? This is one of the most complex beers I have ever tasted. The aftertaste is almost straight Old Crow (I like Old Crow!). Hot. My belly is getting warm. My brain is getting slow. My mouth is getting really, really happy. I have no complaints I keep thinking there should be something else in this beer, something more to balance the barrel influences. I dont know what that is. Maybe it is nothing. Maybe it is perfect. All I know, I love this beer it is so well thought-out. Yes, it is heavy handed. Yes, it beats the shit out of your tongue. Then it reconciles. It is an abusive but a beautiful relationship. What a beer.  Medium/medium-full in body, if this beer had the mouthfeel of Founders Breakfast Stout, my god this beer could not be stopped! Still, the mouthfeel fits this beer well, it is filling enough with low carbonation, and I cant help but sip and savor. Yum. I dont think I want to pair this beer with many foods, maybe some rich cheesecake, maybe some zesty cheese, maybe this beer should fly solo as a nightcap.  If you can handle it this beer is supremely drinkable. I think it is a masterpiece, it is one of the most remarkable beers I have ever had. Delicious. Complex. Delicate. Violent. Boozy. Shrewd. Lovely. And you know the best part? I can buy it in Omaha now. I got my four-pack via RedHaze. Thank you. I will buy more and cellar some! I hate cellaring beers but I think this one is worthy.

The aroma was fruity with a strong bourbon and oak aromatic. The aroma was chocolate and roasted with coffee coupled with a strong bready character and a subtle sweetness. The aroma also had a bit of spicy nature with cinnamon phenolics wafting with alcohol. Vanilla was also present in the aroma along with a nutty aroma and bananas.  The flavor was nicely achieved with a definite bourbon presence, yet the bourbon was somewhat restrained and not overdone. The flavor contained an estery profile and bananas. The flavor contained a nice bit of chocolate and a bit of caramel along with a strong presence of roast. The flavor did not start as dry on the palate, rather just a bit more of the caramel and bourbon coupled with the fruity character. With the bourbon, chocolate and fruit it was similar to a box of sampler chocolates.  The finish was dry with a lasting bourbon, oak, chocolate and bit of roasting into the aftertaste.

I was actually a dark brown. I've seen tan heads before, but this was incredible. Not much retention on it though. Thick lace attached to the edge of this monster glass. Dark as night. No light enters or leaves this beer. My 4-cell maglight isn't penetrating this coal-black beer with dark red highlights. Immense aroma of oak, vanilla, burnt mocha and bourbon-soaked raisons. Alcohol comes through towards the end, but much less than I would have though for an 11%'er. Now to try this bad boy from Illinois. Oh my god. This is huge. Oaked bourbon and vanilla, followed by burnt mocha, caramel, figs and alchohol. So much flavor going on in this beer, you don't get the full effect of the flavors until deep into the glass. And even then, I have trouble expressing all the flavors I'm tasting. This is a quite thick beer, heavy mouthfeel that coats the tongue, roof of mouth and throat. Also coats the glass easily. Lace is all but gone now and there's still 1/3 beer left. Finishes very oaky and thick. Excuse my while I go scrape my mouth clean. I don't think I could drink more than 1 of these at a sitting. HUGE beer. And the 11% makes itself known. Even now at 3:30 in the afternoon. This is my 2nd beer from Goose Island, my first being their IPA at Camden Yards last year. This one's a beauty. Will try to get my hands on more of these for special occasions and for aging. I can only imagine how this one's gonna turn out...  (edit).

In the center of the glass when looking from above, a dime sized circle of miniature bubbles lurches through to the surface. Pitch, light-strangling black, the edges held to a light show bourbon brown. Swirling leaves film of alcohol. Surface is freshly-waxed car glossy.  Vanilla extract. Charred wood. Chocolate. Alcohol penetrates the nostrils, cuts the big malt.  Dark chocolate, exemplifies bittersweet. Vanilla bourbon. Super burnt malt tastes like the char on a firepit roasted marshmallow. Boozey, engulfs the tongue, attacks the throat, raises body temp 3 degrees, took off sweater after a few sips, strong and prominent. Oily mouthcoat, grooves over the palate and glides down the throat with alcohol in tow. Rich and full. Just found some hops buried in the taste ten minutes after pouring.  Label has a good description of what is in store. Intimidating, totally intense. First beer I have enjoyed where more than one would be too much. Not for everyone, great for me.

Taste is chocolate, coffee, real roasty, with faint bourbon notes, lots of vanilla and oak, toffee, maple syrup, and a roasted chocolate bitter finish. Mouthfeel is super thick, very full bodied, with medium to low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty low simply because its thick as hell, although great.

1549,10672,murphysbleachers,3.85,"Served in a 12oz bottle bought across the street from the brewpub at Sam's. A: Had to pour it straight down the middle of the glass to coax a head out of this (used a Hobgoblin pint glass), but it did form (and left quickly). About as black a beer as I've seen, the head kind of a fuzzy brown. S: Bourbon. Am I about to drink a beer or take a shot of Jack? That said, it is not unpleasant. Second whiff gives a note of vanilla. But they weren't kidding with the bourbon. T: The aroma is a little overpowering. As it warms up oak, vanilla, and chocolate come through. But the bourbony thing is hard to get around. M: Thick, almost cognac-like. D: This is the kind of drink you have one of by the fire on a cold winter's night. Overall, I'm not sure if I'm the best judge of these bourbon barrell things that everyone is doing these days. I prefer to keep my bourbon and beer in seperate glasses. This wasn't bad though. If I had one in the fridge and was sitting by the fire on a cold night, this would do the trick.

So thick the surface didn't ripple under a pour, it *folded* in waves. Dark brown head was a little difficult to coax out, and slowly disappeared. No real lacing, but this stuff is so thick that sheets of the beer itself lace the glass when tipped.  This stuff smells heavily of vanilla, bourbon, and oak. A thick, sweet smell.  This stuff is just double-stout heaven! Intensely complex. Starts as an espresso double-roast, and instantly turns into an explosion of vanilla, oak, and roast. Slowly fades into a bloom of grapefruit-like hops that stay with you. Each sip brings out more flavors than the last.  This stuff is thick, and massive. Just barely enough carbonation to keep it from intimidating your tongue into hiding. If only all stouts could be so!  I have to be careful, as this is the only bottle I've ever had, and this stuff isn't sold locally for me. Once it's gone, it's gone.

Smell; there's a definite bourbon smell to this, a little chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, and just a hint of coffee. I could smell this one all night long.  Taste; the bourbon definitely stand out, but is not overwhelming at all (I really like whiskey). There's a nice bit of wood flavor, hints of rich chocolate, vanilla, caramel, only a touch of coffee. This one definitely has a lot going on with the flavors.  Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I expected, but it is velvety smooth and just thick enough to let me know I'm drinking a double stout.

1549,10672,neonbrown82,4.12,"This is one of the most incredibly intense beers I've yet tried. This beer is a sipper to its very core, but this opens up a whole new can of worms: sipping this beer brings out a way more intense boozy bourbon flavor, so I've actually found it easier to put down by taking regular sized drinks. This also allows you to more fully experience the flavors, but it makes for an incredibly difficult drink. That being said, this beer is amazingly complex and worthy of its praise. Surely this fresh batch could use some sitting down for a year or more.  The beer pours to a lovely opaque black with a nice mocha head that stays in a ring around the glass. Leaves a great (but washy) lacing. The beer leaves a clear syrupy residue that slides down the glass like molasses, washing the lacing away in the process.  The smell is quite complex. Definitely a lot of bourbon up front with a nice vanilla backing. A bit of molasses creeps its way into the equation, as well as some other odd spicing that reminds me of soba (buckwheat), or coconut as the previous reviewer said. It's almost too complex for words.  The taste didn't quite do it for me at first. Every time I took a drink I would do the whiskey face. I started drinking it at a fairly warm temperature, but it took me a while to warm up to it still. It follows over from the nose quite faithfully with the bourbon and vanilla up front and molasses tucked away under it. The bourbon is just incredibly intense with a boozy and dry finish. Could definitely use a bit more sweetness, or at least a year of cellaring.  The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Nice thick and chewy body. Drinkability is not too high, however. I am definitely glad to have experienced this beer at least once, but I think I'm done with it until it has further ripened in the cellar.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,battlekow,4.28,"This bottle cost me $10 at the brewpub--it better be good.  Bourbon County Stout looks awesome, pitch black with a menacingly dark brown head  Right off the bat, the vanilla and bourbon characteristics are huge in the taste and nose, dominating the beer's underlying characteristics, except for some strong bitter chocolate in the finish. Let's let it warm up a bit and see what happens.  After sitting out a bit, the oak flavor comes out more, a nice dry woodiness. The smell, prominently featuring vanilla and coconut, is now much sweeter, than the very alcoholic taste. It also features an amazingly creamy, velvety mouthfeel.  The most interesting part of the beer is its relative dearth of roasted stoutness. Despite this, it's quite pleasant to sip; however, I think if the alcohol was toned down just a bit and a strong roasted coffee flavor allowed to shine through, this beer would truly be a behemoth.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Maestro,4.2,"Black with a sturdy brown head that leaves a great lacing on the chalice. The smell is nutty with lots of bourbon and whisky notes. This beer is definitely a sipper. It really reminds me of drinking a fine bourbon. The nutty flavor is reminiscent of holiday baking and is well balanced by the alcohol presence. This one is a bit fizzy, but sits nicely in my mouth as I sip. Drinkability is good. This is definitely not a session ale, but it is one of the most unique stouts I have ever sampled. Give it the old college try.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,andyo,4.55,"I've always enjoyed Goose Island beers. I have found them to always be consistent and fairly priced in my area. You can't beat the IPA ,and the Nut Brown is great in my opinion. With this background, I figured that the Bourbon County Stout would be great, but maybe along the same lines as a ""normal"" Goose Island experience. Boy was I wrong.  I was lucky enough to pick up a bottle at From the Vine for $4.50. Might have to pick up a 4-pack or two for aging.  When I cracked open my bottle, I was met by some very strong alcohol. The appearance of this beer is magnificent. Nice swirling black goodness and a grey pillowy head. The first taste of this beer was intense. I was met with lots of alcohol (maybe a bit too much for my tastes), some real big coffee and vanilla flavors, and a nice sweetness. Who spiked my beer?? This beer has a lot of alcohol flavors, and while it seemed a little bit over the top for me at this time, I bet with a little age to mellow this monster out, it would be even better. Don't get me wrong! This beer is fantastic! And after it warmed up considerably, it was even better and more complex.  A great beer, but definately a sipper! Take your time with this one and enjoy the craftmanship.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,nlmartin,4.82,Served in a 20 ounce wine gobblet.  Appearance: This beer pours an inky blackness that does not end. The head was shortly lived but was a lovely creamy coffee color. There is no lacing in evidence.  Smell: Beer Gods of the Beer Gods this is wonderful. There is a great bourbon and vanilla smell wafting in the glass. Fantastic malty goodness assaults the senses. Multitudes of fruit great the senses. This is a very busy beer.  Taste: This is a malty fruity roasted coffee vanilla bean treat from the Beer Gods of the Beer Gods. There is almost to much going on in this beer.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is just fantastic. The beer is full bodied plus. It is chewy beyond description. The alcohol is definately a major player in this beer taste and feel. This is not an everyday beer and it has crushed my palate for the day. It is a beer to be sipped and savored.

Pours a near opaque ruby color with 2 cm of burn sienna colored, foamy head that creates a nice even surface layer on my glass. No light gets through this one a bit!  Alcohol on the nose burns just a bit, but I also get lots of roasty chocolate malts, a very sweet caramel aroma along with some plum, and a strong dose of dry bourbon.  Sipping, I taste a slightly salty fruit flavor reminding me a bit of soy sauce. I also get a bit of rasberry chocolate and a touch of roasted coffee undertones.  BIG! BIG! BIG!!! This is a huge 11%!!! The bourbon has totally wreaked havoc on my palate, and the warming in my belly is pretty darned intense. I like it a lot, but it is a bit chewy!!! Wow! Almost like bourbon gum!!!  Drinkable?

The aroma is rich with notes of Bourbon, vanilla, a strong oak character, and woody tannins. The aroma is very appealing with a liquor-like alcohol note to it as well. The taste is quite thick, definitely a dessert, rich malt character that is dominated by the oak contributions; Bourbon, vanillin, and a slight tannic oakiness, and a definite buttery oak note. There are notes of coffee and roast malt here, but the rich buttery oak character dominates the palate.

I do not remember it being this intense. Lots of chocolate, vanilla and dark fruits with a very healthy dose of alcohol. The alcohol almost gets in the way. Intense. I almost just want to sit and smell it. Here goes with the flavor. I get big chocolate up front with a hint of fig, but the finish is the best part. So much going on after letting it develope. The chocolate is intense. It moves to a vanilla-mocha quality with a touch of roasted malt. Burps are all chocolate and vanilla. It warms the stomach very well, but the alcohol is not in the flavor.

1549,10672,Boto,4.85,"12oz. bottle @ Clybourn location: this is a wonderful beer. I finally got to Chicago to have it again after many years. This one pours an inky, thick, very dark brown color. The pour from the bartender resulted in almost no head, and what was there was light brown and didnt last at all. The nose is full of bourbon. Not as much as a shot, but very nice. Also some noted of chocolate, vanilla, and roastiness. The taste is incredibly rich and smooth, thick and silky.

1549,10672,karst,4.82,"Bottled on Jan 5, 05 ""Flavor will continue to develop over five years!"" 1000th batch aged in bourbon barrels for 100 days.  Pours absolute black with a dense 8-10 bubble high head that falls to a thin golden brown cap that exactly matches the gold Stone Old Gaurdian BW label on my rastal. Advertized as a great cigar beer- one whiff / one sip easily verifies it.  You can't drink this with out getting Dark Lord flashbacks! Not quiet as over roasted and more chocolate than DL. When I lift the glass to drink, smells like I am inside a just emptied bourbon barrel. Full body and slick mouthfeel make it a pleasure to hold in your mouth.  The 11% ABV is not evident in aroma which previews a rich cornucopia of flavors: Chocolate Vanilla Dark Rosted Malts sweeter favors of coconut and currents along with unnamable dark fruits fill in the spaces between the enormous stonger flavors afore mentioned. Warming through lower 50's into the high 50's the flavor evolve even leaving a sweet burnt smoky marshmallow on my palate!  No dregs left behind all the good stuff stays with the stout even with an easy pour. As I sip and enjoy the top 20 reviewer's comments - usually marveling when some disagree with the flavors found by others - in the case of Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout they ALL seem to be right as this beer is impossibly complex tasting.  This pretty well defines the style ""Double American Stout"" described by the Alström Bros.

1549,10672,Rastacouere,3.93,"01-05-05 batch. Considering its strength, the pour offers a generous dark brown head to cover the pitch black, completely opaque hue. Heavily malty aroma, spicy licorice and molasses paired along chocolate chips. It has that sweet dessert component that reminds me of chocolate cookies while the hops, mostly floral, pair nicely with the minty barrel character. Obvious alcohol presence peaks throughout the blackberry and grapey fruitiness, all in a tar like bold malt base. Port and Madeira reminding finish, very alcoholic, bubble gummy and strongly roasty (tobacco). Expert palate rounding, full bodied, soft in texture, intense mouth presence. Good stuff if not particularly my style.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Brian700,4.82,"This is the best beer I have had to date. It's simply amazing. I drank this out of an oversized wine glass provided to me by my Goose Island waitress. It poured a nice silky black with pretty much no head. I would give this beer a little more of an aggressive pour next time. I think I was a little to gentle with it. It looks very silky.  The Aroma is great. There is caramel, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, and some spiciness.  The flavor is so good. It follows the nose in that right a way you get a good chocolaty vanilla flavor with a bite. There is some caramel in there as well as a very nice bourbon finish. It's aged in bourbon barrels. It is the best beer I have tasted so far on this enjoyable journey.  The mouthfeel is also great. With every sip I took I was reluctant to swallow. I could swish this beer around all day long.

The lack of head retention is most likely because of the alcohol. It is almost pitch black. It looks like sludge. MMmm.  The aromas are very sweet. Fruits like dried cherries and plums. The bourbon really comes through with a lot of the sweetness.  The taste is superb. A very complex mix of burbon, roasted malts, and fruits. Very sweet and malty.  The mouthfeel is very thick and viscous with small CO2 bubbles to keep it interesting.  Very drinkable, so velvety smooth and wonderful.

A veritable black hole. Deep dark tan head. Lasts a bit and then dies to a super sticky lacing.  Molasses, vanilla, and other dark malts on the nose.  Oh my god, amazing. Molasses, vanilla, bourbon, dark malts, ripe fruits, chocolate, cocoa, etc. etc. I can't add more than what's been said. It really is that good.  Pours like motor oil. Sticks to your mouth and lingers with both sweetness and bitterness. The alcohol is a deceptive evil ninja. You only know it is there once the beer is getting warm. You feel some warmth in the back of your throat, then your head, then your body, then... you need some more  Evilly drinkable, damn these good beers for not being on the East coast.

1549,10672,far333,4.55,"Inky dark brown, with a head slowly rising from the depths of the glass at the end of the pour. Thought there would be no head at all, but it literally pushed up about a half inch at the end of the pour, and rested a thick, tightly bubbled, dark brown head atop the liquid.  Aroma is rich and complex - roasted malts, sweet fruit, some cotton candy and caramel, perhaps a bit of molasses.  Flavor is even richer than the aroma. It smacks the tongue hard with heavily toasted malts, bitter coffee and baker's chocolate, thick molasses, dark brown sugar, just a bit of sweetness, and the faintest alcohol tingle. A bit of a cherry tang rides beneath. The bourbon flavor is not overpowering, it's very understated, and just adds another layer of smokey richness and depth to the flavor that's tough to describe.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and even. Not overly carbonated. Drinkability is hard to rate. This is a sipper for sure, and it would be overwhelming on the tongue to some, but I wish I had a few more in the fridge, and I'm gonna enjoy every drip of this until it's gone, so I'm gonna rate it on the high side.

1549,10672,BEERchitect,4.82,"My favorite stout,...period. Just finished my second 4-pack (not all today) but, for the year.  Aromas: Awsome. It has it all, malts, coffee, chocolate, cherries, raspberries, raisons, vanilla, caramel. It's basically a desert for the olfactory senses.  Appearance: Thicker, heavier, darker, and better colored than about any stout that I have ever had. It even sounds nicer when poured into a tulip glass.  Taste: Holds up to the aromas and more. One sip tells you that this is going to be a slow and steady drink. High barley and roasted grains without tasting harsh or ""gainy"". All of the fruits and sweetnesses in the aroma are compounded in the flavor. The sweet malt is quickly followed by fruity tartness and nice bittering from the dark malts and the well disguised hops.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, thick, and creamy. Coats the mouth incredibly well. Polishes off well without the stickyness associated with most high gravity brews.  Aftertaste: There's the bourbon. Until now, it hides in the background of all the other complexities. The bourbon flavors increase the caramel and vanilla flavors...and the alcohol. warming and lingering. Each sip makes you want to reflect before the next one.  Impression: overwhelming to the modest beer drinker. This one is definately for grown-ups (if not conissours). She's definately a sipper.

1549,10672,NeroFiddled,4.61,"There's no doubt that Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout was aged in bourbon barrels. It's intense! The nose reeks of bourbon, wood, sweetened coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and caramel. WOW!  The appearance is beautiful as well, although the head retention could be better, But alcohol (11%!) will do that, and it does leave a very nice, initial ring of lace!  In the mouth it's full and creamy, particularly once it's initially bristling carbonation warms to become airy... and the burn of alcohol at the swallow is nice as well.  The flavor is too full to absorb in one or two sips, and only reveals itself fully about 1/4 way into the glass. There's almost too much to mention, and its flavors don't seem to appear in any order. So here's the list: whiskey (not necessarily bourbon, but there's definitely some! And I think also notes of something more salty, like an Islay Scotch), delicate fruit (apple, light red berries), coconut, hot alcohol, chocolate (as in German chocolate cake or raw, melted milk chocolate), molasses, coffee, spice (from the alcohol), dark fruit/the skins of dark fruit, dark red wine, pineapple/mango, dark caramel, smoke, wood, char. Stunning! But it is a sipper... there's way too much alcohol to take this in, apart from savoring it very slowly. It's so good, in fact, that the smell alone sholud keep you busy for quite some time. Overall, this is one full-throttle beer that's exceptionally satisfying, rich and drenched in alcohol!

Aroma is intense creamy chocolate, coffee, smokey charcoal, vanilla hints and bourbon intertwine. Hate to sound like I am writing down the label but its all in there. Man can't believe the bourbon aromas just from aging in barrels after it sits a while smells like an Irish coffee.  Taste is wonderful again lots of bourbon flavor just from barrel aging man this is good. Rich thick bitter coffee mixed with chocolate and bourbon creamy ecstasy then carbonation builds and bourbon flavors intensify add in the vanilla and liquid smoke flavors for a nice lingering finish. The alcohol presence is not that noticable as it blends in with the boubon flavors in the finish very nicely done. If you like bourbon, you have to try this Stout, man this kicks ass.  Mouthfeel is nice full creamy in front lighter in the finish but overall very nice.

Taste is massive chocolate, mild espresso, a lot of bourbon whiskey, cherries. Some hops, but are kind of overshadowed by the whiskey character of the beer. Mouthfeel is soooo thick, it's almost like drinking chocolate/whiskey syrup. It coats the tongue, mouth, throat and stomach. A 12 oz bottle of this is enough to drink all night.

Dark roasted coffee beans, vanilla, molasses and of course bourbon. No real heat detected by me in the nose.  I'd have a hard time coming up with a better tasting bourbon barrel aged beer. That fudge hits first with dark chocolate and a creamy vanilla character. Tastes like warm triple fudge swirl ice cream with a bourbon sauce. The chocolate and vanilla notes play back and forth.

Aroma is a heady and befuddling mix of fermenting dark fruit, roasted nuts, bourbon and a woody weirdness. Certainly not what I expected, but very intriguing. Taste is a mature blend of bourbon and roasted malt, chocolatey and rich, loaded with complexity. Rotting dates and plums struggle against the bourbon infused tide to make their presence known, amongst the heat of the bourbon and the many layers of malty goodness. Chocolate mingles with hazelnut and molasses, with more heat and sweetness building in the finish. Woody flavor and traces of vanilla are prominent in the finish as well.

1549,10672,bigbeerdrinka,4.28,"Pours a motor oil black that just looks so viscous that I know this is going to be a meal for a beer. A thin head rises with a firm chocolate color and laces the glass nicely. Aromas are all over the place with this brew. Strong expresso, roast and molasses like aromas part way for a barrage of vanillas and bourbons with strong tones of dark fruits. This almost reminds me of Sam Adams triple bock but more robust and well put together. Initial tastings start off with a strong dose of molasses and roast that give off a bittersweet combination that follows with some sharp expresso tones. Some dark fruits find their way into the mix but quickly strong roast and caramels take over. The finish is simply dilectable with a strong warming bourbon flavor that takes away some of the sharp roast and expresso tones and fills it with vanilla and some slight sweetness. The body to this brew is like a milkshake and a subtle carbonation lifts this beer off of the pallate in a most excellent manner.

1549,10672,tavernjef,4.87,"Deep and dark fudgy brown nearly and completely black once fully poured with a late-to-appear thin, dark cocoa cap of whipped cream fluff. The foam creeps away leaving a thin collar and the lacing sticks in small amounts of strings close to the collar.  Aroma is quite nice, an ever changing array of strength with dark caramel and darker still, chocolate; masked by a firm girth of bourbony sweetness that really comes across as smooth and well checked, mainly due to the chocolate tones keeping it quieter then it ought to be. A nice medley on the nose. Simple notes of vanilla and cookie dough remain ever present as well. As it warms the bourbon makes a bigger effort to overcome the chocolate.  Taste is thick and oily with a smooth dark chocolatey front, then, as if it had a choice, gets overtaken by a very sweet bourbon heat and tinge thats pretty intense. Whhooffda! This sucker is nicely heated. Still in check though, much like the aroma, the chocolate tones tend to supersede over the top of the flavors but staying underneath the alcoholic heat. An interesting effect. Super awesome finish, subtle, warming, late return of chocolate after the heat settles off leaving leftovers of crispened charred vanilla bean, caramel stickies, and sweet, sweet bourbon. Oh my, what an encapsulated ride of fun this stuff is, wow! That sweet bourbony heat builds strongly and just cinders for what seems an eternity while all the other stuff play underneath.  Feel is powerfully heated with a bourbony sweetness and back-throated burn that is absolutely awesome to behold. Thickishly full body with an oily front and somewhat creamy length throughout the rest of its stay that mediates under the overall heat. If it were a notch less heated it would be phenomenal as far as its feel and drinkability. It could be quite a drinkable treat if it weren't so ABV hitting. Although, there's nothing wrong with slowing down and enjoying it, appreciating it, ...loving it, cuz that's what it's all about with this one.

1549,10672,mattcrill,4,"Big thanks to cmaruschak for securing this fine brew for me.  Presentation: Nice message from the Brewmaster Greg Hall. He informs us that this is the 1000th batch of beer aged for 100 days in bourbon barrels. Seemed like an appropriate beer for my 200th beer.  Appearance: Pours inky black and slightly thick looking with a tan head that quickly dissapates.  Smell: Vanilla up front fading to raisins and then a prominent oak and alcohol presence.  Taste: Raisins, vanilla, and sweet dark chocolate lead the charge with some oak, carmel, dark fruits and some vinous qualities bringing up the rear. This is multi-layered and complex. It is a big, bad beer.  Mouthfeel: big and bold bordering on chewy with a dry bourbony finish. A sweet but not cloying finish rounds out the taste. Definitely coats the mouth and throat.  Drinkability: It suffers some due to the over-the-top bourbon presence. It's a nice night cap and a good sipper.  Notes: This paired well with my wife's chocolate chip brownies. I keep holding out hope that I will find a stout that is a stout first and has some bourbon qualities in the background and not in your face. I still haven't found one. This is the best one I've had to date but maybe this is the most that can be done with this unique twist on my favorite style.

1549,10672,bnuttz,3.94,"this puppy pours out the thickest most opaque black I have ever seen. Very small dark brown head present. Smell is sweet bourbon. Very sweet and malty, but the bourbon definitely overpowers the smell, good if boubon is your thing, and I am definitely one not to pass up on a nice glass of makers on the rocks, anyways, back to the review. I lowered the rating on the nose due to being able to smell only bourbon. Wow, bourbon definitely hits the mouth first. The alcohol sting of it is there and doesnt shy at all. But luckily the dark malts of the stout make a nice appearance near the end. Sweet bourbon followed by black coffee like malts. Bliss in the mouth. The bourbon is a little overpowering and a blended version of this may have made it a little more stout like, but this is definitely a bourbon drinkers beer. Rating this one high, but it could be better in my opinion if more of the stout qualities showed up. Mouthfeel is thick and full and perfect for a stout of this nature. Drinkability is another story. How do you rate this one, it is not drinkable in the sense of being able to sit back and drink a lot of them.

1549,10672,CRJMellor,4.47,"Pours thick and syrupy. Dark black hue with a touch of maroon highlights. Thin ring of dark tan head leaves soppty lace on the pint. Aroma is vinous sour mash note, choclate covered raisins and some roasted coffee notes. Beautiful aroma. Flavor of sweet chocolate and smoky peat notes dominate with some sharp dark citrus furit notes and molasses. Big ethanol/alcohol kicker on the finish. Tasty potent stuff. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and vinous with a sharp pang of sweet whisky feel and a highly spiced alcholic pop. Some light residual bittering on the finish. Drinkability is very high despite high ABV. Awesome taste, great balance of sweet malts, chocolate and strong alcoholic whiskey notes. Find this beer if you can.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,merlin48,4.82,"12 oz bottle purchased at the Liquor Barn in Lexington, Ky. Label says the abv is 11%. Served into a chalice at cellar temperature, this pours a thick and dense black body with a small mocha head with garnet hues around the edges. The head quickly diminishes into a lasting ring of lace that is quite impressive to behold. Some sheet lacing is unexpected, but adds to the dynamic appearance. Aroma is intense. Burnt coffee, bitter chocolate, campfire charred oak, and some minor notes of vanilla. A distinctive aroma of premium Kentucky bourbon emerges near room temperature. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Robust and full bodied, with some warming/burning alcohol, yet smooth and coating. Taste is complex and quite exquisite. Bitter chocolate, burnt coffee, smoky campfire logs, and some creamy sweet vanilla. Some unexpected cherry notes appear out of nowhere, and add another dimension to the exceptional portfolio of flavors going on here. The alcohol is noticed, but is nicely tucked away in the mulitplex of flavors and character. Finishes with a flourish that is pure nirvana for a stout lover, creamy chocolate liqueur drenched vanilla cream, with a lasting bourbon aftertaste. Wow! This is truly a masterpiece of the brewer's art. I've never before been impressed by Goose Island brews, but they've gained my attention and interest with this one. I could easily give this one higher marks, but the hidden alcohol suggests that one bottle at a time is just about right. Highly recommended for lovers of big American stouts.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,cretemixer,4.75,"I've been fighting a cold for a while now & have put off drinking this beer just because I wanted to be sure to taste & smell all it has to offer. I shouldn't have worried so much, this beer will cut through almost any cold.  Deepest chestnut in color, it looks black in the glass but the ruby highlights come out when the beer clings to the glass. A thin mocha colored head fades fast, leaving nothing in its wake.  The aroma is top notch. Bourbon soaked bitter chocolate with a smoky, woody background. Hints of carmelized brown sugar and again, more bourbon.  Tastes even better than it smells! The bitter chocolate & bourbon from the nose are here in spades. An alcohol warmth is felt all the way down. A true Gusler ""bellywarmer"". Licorice notes as well as hints of raisins & smoke.  Slick & sticky seems like a true oxymoron, but this is it & it suits me just fine for a beer of this style. Sticky-sweet on the lips without becoming cloying, slick & oily in the glass & on the way down the gullet.  The 11% is definetly noticable in this beer & that's a good thing, but drinkability does suffer a bit. Do I want another? Hell yes. Am I going to go open another? Not today, but I will revisit soon.  Damn fine beer & worth every penny so you can all quit your bitchin'.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,Brent,4.34,"Holy cow! Let me preface this with a disclaimer - I'm not advocating giving any beer high marks simply for pushing the envelope just for the sake of doing so, but Goose Island has done a good job of keeping this nearly out of control train from jumping the track.  Dead black pour. Quick mocha colored thin head that vanished. Not a lot of aroma - some dark maple syrup. Low level of carbonation. First sip - this reminded me a lot of Sam Adams Triple Bock, but without the overwhelming maple syrup flavor. Most noteworthy up front is an unrefined sorgum molasses flavor. Dark roasted coffee. Sweet, alcoholic bourbon notes. Spicy at the finish with coffee liquor alcohol pepper. Syrup mouthfeel without syrupy sweetness - the liquid coats the side of the glass and sticks when rolled about. Makes a Russian Imperial Stout seem lightweight.  A fireside sipper of the likes of an old ale or barleywine. I was taken aback by the outrageous price for a standard bottle - $5 and change, but this is a six-pack in a bottle. Sampled very young - if I read the label right only about a month old. I'll be curious to see what it does over time - I think I'll grab a few to lay back.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,bashiba,5,"This is from the 2005 batch dated 01/01/05 and listed at 11%ABV  Poures completely Black with a small thin coffee colored layer of head that is gone in an instant.  Oh my does this smell ever so good, like a perfect combination of top shelf bourban mixing so perfectly with a deep coffee and bitter chocolate smell.  Wow the flavor is dead on perfect of everything I envisioned this beer to be. Nice Vanilla and caramel Bourban Notes blending perfectly with the dark coffee stout flavors. Ever so much like good sweet bourban inititally with very potent alcohol notes and a dark bitter Coffee and Chocolate finish with a slight earthy hop charachter. Perfect!  Mouthfeel is thick and full with a luscious creamy texture and a very noticeable strong warming.  Drinkability is excellent. While definitly not a session beer something special to be enjoyed and cherished. Can't wait to see how this holds up with some cellaring.  A perfect Stout! The only complaint on this is the huge Price tag, otherwise Great Job Goose Island!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,gimmehead,3.95,"Bottle says 11% ABV  Pours black with a mocha colored head and no lacing. Very sweet nose: chocolate, something I can only describe as overripe bananas and, of course, bourbon. Very creamy and thick, complex to the palate. I notice chocolate and vanilla, raisins,bourbon, a little cloying, warm alcohol finish. A winter warmer indeed!  I was really looking forward to this one, but must admit that I'm a little disappointed. The cloying sweetness becomes more evident as the beer warms, and I find it hard to think about tackling another one. Not horrible by any means, but one per session is enough for me.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,clvand0,4.35,"This one pours a very dark color with a small head that doesn't stick around long, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and has some chocolate, vanilla, and dark malts. The flavor is much the same. Lots of chocolate and bourbon notes along with some other dark malts. The body is as thick as it gets. I couldn't drink more than one because it's so filling. The beer just sticks to the insides of your mouth. Wow. The drinkability suffers only from the fact that it's so thick.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,tar,4.42,"This is the second time I've had this beer and have been looking forward to it all day. Pours a dark, thick, oily black with a thin (half-centimeter) reddish-brown head which quickly diminishes to nothing but a ring around the glass. Giving the glass a swirl leaves a nice thin coating of medium brown liquid wherever the beer reached up to on the glass. Smells strongly of oak, vanilla, and roasted malts. Some bourbon notes come through in the wonderfully strong and complex aroma. Feels full-bodied and oily smooth in the mouth. A very good tasting beer. Tastes of bourbon with strong oaky vanilla flavors particularly in the finish. Chocolate and roasted malts lend some nice bitterness and contribute to the very full and multi-dimensional flavors. Very well balanced overall. Quite filling and not a beer you'll be likely to have more than one of in a sitting, but one youll definitely want again.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,nogoodreason,4.88,"It was seriously hard to find a flaw with this beer. This batch must be worlds better than earlier batches. This beer is currently averaging a 3.9??? That's amazing, I'm struggling to not give it a perfect 5.   Pours black and thick as oil, with a wilting head the color of a smoky sunset. No light penetration, even when held up to the light. It's BLACK and THICK.  Nose is heavily of french vanilla ice cream, boozy heat and soft, milk chocolate undertones, with a faint oily scent that almost feels like a gap in the scent.  It's ridiculously full and creamy on the palate... if every stout had a body like this, I would drink nothing but stouts. Huge, vanilla at first, but the bourbon is beautifully integrated into the beer. The milky chocolate comes through, with the slight roasty notes turning it faintly bittersweet and rounding into anise spicyness in the finish. As it warms, it gets woodier and coconut notes appear along side the soft, creamy vanilla.  Finishes sweet, sticky and creamy with hints of anise. Wow.   Seriously, this beer was remarkable. It was heavily bourbon-flavored, but the bourbon was so well integrated that the beer never seemed hot or vulgar. It was simply the best mix of beer and bourbon characteristics I've encountered. It's hard to not give it a perfect score.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,SheepNutz,4.09,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep black color with half a finger of dark tan head. No lacing in sight. The smell is sweet with some bourbon and chocolate character. A hint of vanilla as well. The taste is full of dark roasted malt, and there's lots and lots of chocolate in this one. A hint of bourbon and oak on the finish. Warming alcohol lingers. The mouthfeel is incredible, coating the sides of the glass along with the sides of my mouth. The drinkability suffers just a touch due to filling effect it has on you. A darn fine beer!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,orbitalr0x,4.47,"Sampled at the Map Room on 1/22/05. A deep dark black oily pour with not much head to speak of. This might have been from the pour at the bar or the 11% abv. Dark tan bubbles. No light is getting through this one. The nose has nice oaky, slightly bourbon aromas along with roasty tones, hints of cocoa and molasses. A predominent vanilla aroma as well.  Wow! First sip is big bourbon oak alcohol flavors upfront with a bit of chalky cocoa as well. Candy sweetness throughout with lots of vanilla and rich chocolate. A nice big, flavorful stout. The bourbon is not overpowering and works well in the overall flavor.  Super smooth, thick creamy mouthfeel with small bubbly carbonation. Quite nice. A great dessert brew that has a wonderfully unique flavor and would go great next to the fire on a cold night.

1549,10672,Bierman9,4.53,"Update... having some 2016 from a 0.5l bottle at the Nashua Garden during a barrel aged stout fest.... Jet black with minimal lacing..... great nose of molasses, roasted coffee, dark choco and espresso. Quite smooth and silky.. Flavor has more of what the aroma offered.... Coffee, dark choco, espresso, molasses.... some vanilla.... and throw in the bourbon barrel notes.... wow! What was I thinking back in 2004? Fantastic shit!! Prosit!!  4.53/5 rDev +0.7% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5  *** *** ***  Presented in a 12oz bottle with a white label yet no print on it. Just had ""Goose Island"" on the cap.  Poured a thick, oily, opaque dark brown, with just the thinnest of heads. Topping rapidly dissipates, leaving a mocha-colored ring of bubbles at the perimeter. Leaves only a suggestion of lacing as well. Bourbon is very evident in the aroma, almost to the overall detriment of the nose. There is some roasty, coffee notes with a hint of hops floating about too. Body is solid, and the bier glides easily and velvety over the tongue.  Flavor is heavy on deep, dark roasty, burnt notes along with some dark fruit such as raisins and figs. Bourbon is evident here as well, with light finishing touches of floral hoppiness. Definitely an innards-warmer, with alcohol making itself known on the journey bellywards. Overall a tasty brew, though both just a sipping bier and one to have on those ""now-and-then"" occasions.

1549,10672,aracauna,3.97,"It poured black and nicely oily. There was not a lot of carbonation or head. There is a dominant whiskey aroma and a nice vanilla thing going on.

1549,10672,DrunkMcDermott,4.33,"Ah, yes. The Goose was the first brewpub I ever knew of, and I enjoyed grabbing a couple of Gooses by the neck... and then this came along: the first beer that made me say, ""Oh... my... freakin' God!"" Now it's out in bottles as part of the Goose' ""Extreme Beers,"" but still hard to find:  A deeper Imperial Stout-type nose. Big bourbon flavor, even powerful like a Hennessey. Beautiful black with red highlights. I saw the bourbon barrels they were aging this in at the brewery a few months back, and I'm pleased to say they've bottled it beautifully!",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,BierReise,4.22,"Big aroma of bourbon initially with some charred malt in the background. Color is black with only a small thin beige head. Mouthfeel is delicate and smooth with a warming alcohol sensation. Finishes a bit dry. Flavor is outstanding, roasted malts, chocolate, charred smoky wood and whiskey. Has a distinct sweet syrupy bitter finish. This one is a winter warmer and quite a pleasure to drink.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,jahred,4.1,"A beautiful dark black color with almost no head. Can make out a slight whiskey scent.  Immediately notice the syrupy, thick taste, with strong toffee and coffee flavors. The bourbon flavor isn't as strong as expected, especially not when compared to other beers aged in bourbon/whiskey barrels. An odd, dry aftertaste lingered, and after a few sips I noticed a pear taste in the beer.  Though this style of beer isn't to be consumed in large quantities, the subtlety of the bourbon flavoring would allow me to drink more than I would expect.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,TheDM,4.14,This brew pours a very small dark brown head of fine bubbles that quickly disappear and left little lacing. It was incredibly smooth for what I was expecting to come from this very thick black bodied beer. Its 9% alcohol content is extremely well hidden. It gave mny whole mouth a tingling sensation with a very stong sweet malt molasses flavor.,Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
1549,10672,DrewBeechum,3.03,"Sampled in a Brandy Snifter at the Clyborn Brewpub.  Apparently one of the first Imperial Stouts commercially aged in bourbon barrels in the US.  This beer is definately an odd duck and different than what you would think.  This beer is almost completely overwhelmed by oaky sourness in the aroma and flavor with a sharp acetic and tannic character.  Aroma carries a spicy oak and vanilla sense with a strong current of acectic acid in the finish.  The flavor of this dead deep black beer starts with chocolate and cherries, but is quickly overwhelmed with a sharp vinegar flavor and a tannic finish.  Really interesting beer, a stout lambic? Oude Noir? Who knows, but a snifter of this is about the right size for a beer this intense.",Goose Island Beer Co.,"Illinois, United States",American Imperial Stout,100
