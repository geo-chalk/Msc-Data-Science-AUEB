287,1444,Foyle,4.48,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Thick, beige head, abundant lacing, dark brown, nearly black color. Aroma of chocolate and dark roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick with a warming alcohol in the finish. Flavor is intense - chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, dark roasted barley, with matching intense hop flavors.

Updated review:  Canned 2021 (2 years ago)  Appearance: Pours a completely black, color with a moderate and thick dark tan head. SRM of 24. (4.00)  Aroma: Strong and smooth aromas of rich dark chocolate, somewhat bittersweet with a sweet bourbon, bread, and caramel flavor. (4.00)  Flavor: Dark, smooth, rich and sweet flavors of dark chocolate, rich bread, caramel, strudel, some scotch and bourbon to finishes malty. Minimal roast. (4.25)  Feel: Heavier bodied, average carbonation. Smooth, thick, rich, heavy, and sweet. (4.25)  Compared to Great Lakes Blackout Stout 2/2023: Pours similar, darker head. Similar aromas. More thick and heavy chocolate with malt complexity of bread pudding and caramel. Less coffee and roastedness. Heavier and sweeter.  Overall: Tried this one a few times and unfortunately my review was accidentally deleted so cannot look back on previous reviews. Now I'm drinking this one from 2021 in 2023 so aged a couple of years. It's rich, heavy, and thick. Some complexity to the malt flavors of chocolate, dark meat, bread pudding, and caramel.

287,1444,cuttysark,4.5,"12 oz bottle packaged 9-7-22. I’ve had this many times. First time review. Poured into a snifter a beautiful thick black with a 1” head. Smell is hard to tell. A little too cold, being in fridge, don’t have the greatest nose. Taste is great. Full flavored chocolate a a little licorice. Very hearty. Feels great in the mouth. Almost chewable. I like to sip these over a long time and let them warm up. One of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,AzfromOz,4.47,"Procured in a proxy/trade hybrid with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022, and drunk nine months later in November 2022.  L: Poured like oil out of a can, with a thick, shiny stream of silky-looking liquid issuing forth. In the glass, it's blacker than black, with the brownest, most coffee-coloured head I've ever seen. Lots of tiny bubbles race their way up the edge of the glass.  S: Roasty, rich caramel and molasses, with strong umami soy sauce notes.  T: The taste is smooth and roasty at the same time. There's a creaminess and a Christmas cake note evident throughout. The booze is strongly evident. At the end there's a lingering retronasal coffee note. This beer is delicious!  M: The beer is smooth, thick and oily, but all in a good way. It coats every part of my mouth, with a delightful satiny feel. This part of the beer ties everything together like the prettiest Christmas bow and turns a delicious beer into an outstanding one.  O: This one blew me away. I was tired after a poor sleep the night before and the last thing I wanted was a big stout. But I'm a stubborn man, and for once in my life, my mulishness has paid off. What a great beer this is!

287,1444,NevadaBill,4.24,"New to me, and a solid daily drinker; for an RIS, to me at least! I use Old Rasputin as my benchmark, but this one is not expensive and delivers on flavor! Unlike the famous ones that have 10% more flavor and 50% more cost. Dark pour from chilled bottle in to 12oz. pint glass. Some head, decent. Motor oil consistency; can't see through it. Just a hint of fruit sweetness, but not overly so. Not sure where the sweetness comes from, but it is muted. Great roasted, coffee, dark chocolate, malty flavor. Nice mouthfeel; just about right for RIS. This has some smokiness to it (for me), and I love that. It has both a bit of sweet and bitter finish. But walks the line pretty well here; not going overly one direction. Nice after dinner drink by the fire!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,doclh,4.54,"Found this one in our local grocery store known for a manager who loves his brews. After opening the first bottle, I immediately lifted the bottle to my nose. The aroma of a malting barn hit me. The heavy, rich, sweet aroma took me back to my days baling wet hay on the family farm. Organic, real, substantive, with sweet smells. Very few beers have hit me this way. The taste was rich and full. I may have found the beer to replace Dragon’s Milk as my second favorite after Founder’s KBS.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,cjeep,4.46,One seriously tasty brew. I haven’t tried it much due to the price point but I think that’s been my loss. Bottled 9/21 consumed 10/21. Great now but what might happen w time? L: from the bottle. Classic stylish. S: coffee chocolate. Toffee? Nice! T: almost smoky. Bittersweet chocolate. Lots of bitterness. Powerful. I like it. F: kind of forgot about it.

Ink black; one finger of dark tan mixed bubbles head quickly dissipates leaving a small filmy island and solid ring; spots of lace and thick legs on swirl. Nose is roast malt, chocolate and coffee. Roast bitterness, char and burnt brown sugar up front; bittersweet dark chocolate, chocolate brownie batter; raisins; roast coffee as beer warms; star anis and molasses on backend. Medium full body, moderate minus carbonation; some warmth from 11.5% abv; dryish finish. Overall, layers of flavors, however, at almost one year old the char/bitterness is still strong with a long bitter linger; a tasty RIS, yet more bitter roast than I want…it would be interesting to see how this beer tastes in a few years.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,keith_katt,3.64,This beer pours black. Like jet black. Brown head that is 1.5 fingers thick. Fades to long lasting lacing. The flavor is bold. Black licorice and bitter coffee.

287,1444,BillAfromSoCal,4.54,"For a non-BA aged stout this one really rocks. True to its style in taste and smell. Dark as midnight. Pours with a nice dark tan head about 1.5 fingers thick that dissipates fairly quickly to leave a thin covering over the beer for the duration or time it takes to bottom the glass. a little lacing left behind. My smell/taste differentiation capabilities are not sufficient to discern individual components very defensibly, but there is a bit of bitter dark chocolate I pick up with an overall incredibly well balanced taste and mouthfeel that leaves me to conclude ""I have no idea what contributes to this flavor but it sure is good"". I need to get more of this and cellar it and ration it out until it is reissued next year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Then it turns sweet with malt.  This shit is thick. It's mouthfeel is a mouthful.  It's smooth with not a lot of carbonation. It finishes with some bitterness and a little burn from the high alcohol content.  Overall this is a great imperial stout. It's strong and flavorful.

287,1444,Whyteboar,4.62,"This is for a bottle that was capped in November of 2015 and opened on May 1, 2020, so take that for reference. Pulled the 12 oz bottle from my cellar where it was stored at 54 degrees and poured it into a snifter. Aroma - I can smell this one! Mmmm, stout like malts and slight coffee nuance with what I can only describe as a hint of graham cracker, which seemed odd to me, but there you have it. Appearance - If the color black had a temperature, this would be a warm black. Virtually no head, very light umber colored lacing. Very opaque. Taste - Very good. Need to compare with 'fresh' for comparison, but this was outstanding. Roasted malts roll over your tongue and down your throat with the hops kicking in at the back of the palate for a slight edge. Warmth accompanies the entire process. Overall - Excellent example of the genre. The malts carry the hops, not the other way around like I've tasted in some. Definitely a permanent occupant in the cellar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Ahypercube,4.1,"Picked up a bottle of the 2015 vintage from the Argonaut in Denver. Never before have I aged a beer for more than two years, so this is a first experience for me. Thanks for cellaring this, guys. As the bottle description suggests, this brew was meant to be aged...  The pour reveals a dark brown espresso body with just enough mocha brown foam to leave a thin dotted line of lacing on the glass. Nice, but this isn't where it shines.  The aroma is sweeter than I remember this stout being fresh, molasses at the forefront with notes of roast coffee and dark chocolate close behind. Hints of coconut, vanilla, and dried bread crusts complement the syrupy molasses base, which fades into turbinado sugar and fresh tobacco for a very mellow finish.  Tastes very smooth compared to the fresh version. The roast bitterness has diminished into an ashy charcoal flavor. The molasses, on the other hand, only seems to have been strengthened with age, becoming the primary player in the game dark chocolate is still a competitor, as is (what I can only describe as) aged coffee, which holds just enough bitterness to balance the rather prominent coffee acidity, and the overall impression is a lightly carbonated Irish coffee with invisible cream that someone left out all day.  As ridiculous as that sounds, it's actually really smooth, with a creamy onset and a dry charcoal finish. The feel of this brew has definitely improved with age.  I can't say I'm blown away. It's still very much the same beer, and considering the lack of roast bitterness, I don't know if I could say I prefer it aged for five years. I would like to try a fresh one again before I make such an assessment. But it's still delicious after half a decade on the shelf, and I will probably pick up another one at $3 a bottle, just to do a side-by-side.

287,1444,Pouringpro,4.97,"Looking over my ageing stash during these times of distancing and there was no distancing from this beauty. The color was dazzling in the glass. The elements of the taste profile sharply defined and combining in moments. Bourbon barrel syrupy smoke and dry earth with cocoa and coffee hints that converge quickly with the malts and leave you stunned by the richness and balance. As a Stout drinker for 50 years or so, I rate this Brewer and his Brew as Galaxy on the Interplanetary Scale. Hopefully I have stashed another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Premo88,4.06,"12 oz. bottle poured into tight nonic (10/31/2017 born-on date ... almost two years old from my ""cellar"" aka my fridge)  L: classic black-and-tan look with the beer being almost pitch black and the massive head of foam being a dark tan, almost brown; as it pours, it looks like motor oil coming out of the bottle, and the head percolates like a nitro beer; the sticking off the head of foam is modern-art quality; it's one of the the most amazing pours you'll ever see and the easiest 5 I've scored  S: chocolate, both lighter, sweeter milk and more bitter dark; a faint note of old burnt hops  T: bitter dark malt — it's bitter enough that the hops still could be nipping and biting, but it's also a burnt bitter; baker's chocolate, espresso, brown sugar, a hint of meaty/bold red wine that gets cut off by the dark-malt bitterness; occasionally the chocolate flavors get sweeter, moving from baker's to dark to a hint of milk chocolate  F: fat, thick, oily and well carbonated; at times you feel like you could eat it with knife and fork, but it's still beer and mostly water, and there is a nice break from the thickness from time to time and it almost feels a bit watery; a fun complexity and more often than not exactly what you expect from the style  O: even at two years old, it's still strong, dark and bitter; in fact, it's a bit too bitter to my tastes; it's tasty and enjoyable, but it could've aged another two years and still been fine, perhaps even losing some of the burnt bitterness and tasted more like roasted coffee and dark chocolate; if you like your Russian imperial stouts on the truly dark side, this one fits the bill",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It is obviously naturally a residual essence from great ingredients and brewing - not like other beers that throw blobs of coffee, chocolate, or whatever, and rely upon them for the primary taste. I should point out that this is not a beer for the meek. If you have ever had a bud, miller, coors, ... and thought ""this is refreshing"", this beer is too much for you to even watch someone pour from across the bar - and definitely too much flavor for you to handle.

This beer smells like a delicious RIS. T: Full of roasted malt flavor with notes of chocolate, dates, figs, molasses, coffee and toffee. Bitter finish with lingering malty/chocolate sweetness. F: Thick and chewy consistency with a heavy body. Carbonation is spot-on for the style. Creamy smooth finish with just a slight fizz. O: This is a delicious brew. I am glad that it is starting to see some distro out in CA. I think I am appreciating it more among all the love of pastry stouts. It is nice to get back to the basics.

There is a little herbal and spicy hop action that livens up the aroma a bit, although it's still heavily focused and centered on dark malts. A light addition of chocolate and dark fruits rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruits with roasted, toasted, nutty, and bready malts behind. Hops are more of a whisper here, but hit notes of herbal, spicy, and floral. Mouth feel is dense and thick with a velvety texture. Overall, a big stout with big malts and still perceptible hops.

Aroma of deeply roasted malts, dark chocolate, peat, smoke, and tobacco.

Mouth feel is thick, mouth coating, and creamy. Some felt alcohol but certainly not a burn. Appropriate carbonation.

Tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, plum, raisin, molasses, vanilla, caramel, malt and something else...graham cracker? Delicious. Nice smooth, sticky, creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. The high ABV doesn’t hit you upfront and this beer is dangerously, deceptively easy to drink.

Aroma: Brownie batter like fudgy chocolate, sweet roasted malts, and tons of vanilla. I mean wow, there is a lot of vanilla here. It smells sweet, a bit like Prairie Paradise, just to that level of sweetness. I also gets some milky caramel notes.  Taste: The taste is big sweet vanilla up front with some chocolate hitting as well, but then the beer just does a swan dive into dark malt roast and bitter coffee char that really lingers. The mouthfeel is correspondingly thick and a little chewy. I like the duality of this one, one side keeping the other in check... or not. Dr. Jekyll's brew? As the beer warms even more, a marshmallow flavor rises up. Also, I have previously had this beer with about a year and a half on it and it was fantastic, with all of the above plus additional notes of dark rum soaked dates and raisins.

Each pour was into a wine glass with a rich dark body and not much of a dark tan head which may have been caused by the bottles being opened earlier. Smell was richly chocolate and roasty malt with a slight bitterness that faded with each successive year. Taste followed the smell and was very enjoyable; with each successive year the bitterness faded and was replaced by dark fruit flavors while the chocolate was unabated. Mouthfeel was just fine.  I bought a six of this to age previously and, after drinking the current year, was wondering why bother not drinking it now.

287,1444,ichorNet,4.06,"I'm a bit late to enter this into my New Beer Sunday, so I guess I'll just give it a good ol' straight-up review... I've been a big fan of Bell's darker beers that I've been able to get my hands on since we've started to see distribution over in New England. This is a beloved RIS, and one that I've never before been able to weigh in on. Super glad to get my hands on a single bottle! I had Black Note last week and thought it was great, but I definitely felt like I didn't quite know where it was coming from. This beer is the missing piece that I need to experience to put it all together!  Pours an intensely-dark color with a thin but very retentive mocha-colored head. Solid lace forms as I sip, giving this a really solid appearance. It reminds me of the very first few batches of Clown Shoes' Blaecorn Unidragon, a similarly huge RIS that went straight for the style.  The nose is incredibly roasty, with a big chocolate and caramel aspect that inevitably falls behind the roast. Caramel maltiness and Belgian chocolate round everything out. There's very little dark fruit compared to other Russian Imperial stout beers... this is all about the cocoa and earthiness! Hops seem relegated to backing up said earthy elements, but also seem to give off some herbal and floral character. Mostly sweet caramel and chocolate, though... a very decadent smelling RIS.  The flavor profile is sweeter than expected, with strong elements of Belgian chocolate, earthy hops and caramel/toffee. My tongue is utterly inundated by the intense roasty cocoa flavors here... it's almost too much; beyond the realm of what I want in this style of beer. Just absolutely decadent with pine-like bitterness following through and a bit of a floral element kicking around toward the finish. I'm unsure of whether or not this beer is really what I want in the RIS style, however. It tastes quite excellent, but it does have a bit too much roast for my taste.  The feel is moderately heavy with a bit more carbonation than I expected. Once again, this betrays what I assumed it would be... it is a large beer with an appropriately done body, and I get that, but it's just a little on the nose for me. I've known about this beer for a long time, and having now had it... I'm somewhat nonplussed. It's excellent for a strong stout, but maybe I would feel that it's even better with some time on it? Black Note is great with a year on it, so this is probably in the same realm.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Raisins come to mind. There is also a hint of coffee. Alcohol on this one is noticeable.  Taste is off roasted coffee and grains with a raisin sweetness and an alcohol warmth. It is fairly sweet. Chocolate is also part of the show.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and quite silky. Coats the palate nicely. The carbonation is medium and gives it a little lift.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Steve_Studnuts,4.59,"Bottled 8/31/2017. Bought a few six packs of this a couple years ago. Thought I'd let some age awhile, but it's colder than a witch tit tonight and the furnace is giving me problems so I'm counting on this to warm me up. Here we go...  Pours a deep, oily black with minimal cocoa-colored head that never really dissipates. Love the scent coming off this thing. It smells deeply of bitter baker's chocolate with a boozy bite that almost gives it a barrel-aged vibe. Vague cherry cordial undertones. Just lovely and inviting. Tastes of super dark-roast (almost burnt) coffee and dark chocolate that finishes with a bitter bite. Mouth is chewy in the way that I like big imperial stouts to be. I'm partial to this style, but this is fucking delicious.  Got 10 of these left and am thinking of trying one every six months or so from here on out. Will update notes accordingly. I've heard that 4-5 years of age is the sweet spot. We'll see; it can't get a whole lot better.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Lingenbrau,4.35,"Another thanks to Craig for this 2015 bottle...  Expedition Stout pours black as sin even coming out of the bottle. Chestnut highlights give it a little glow, and a thin espresso foam barely shows itself off despite a heavy hand.  Heavy roast is first and foremost. A combination of over toasted bread, dark roast coffee, and for the first time in my life, I'm finally getting what I have heard over and over again with some aged stouts...soy sauce. Brown sugar and a little savory spice top it off.  Very rarely do the aroma and flavors seem to match perfectly for me, but Expedition Stout does just that. With a little addition of dark chocolate and a splash of clean booze, this is really enjoyable. This 'soy' experience is working for me, especially thanks to my love for and in this case perceived salinity.  It feels right. Rich and smooth, sticky, sappy, with a nice roasty bitter finish. The alcohol warmth is perfect. Not too intense, but makes itself known.  Most of Bells offering I think are great. This one is in their top tier for me. With so much attention going to bourbon barrel aged and adjunct stouts, it's always a pleasure to enjoy a true imperial stout in it's intended raw form. Cheers, and thanks again Craig.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The aroma is dark chocolate and roasted malt. As it warms, the fruit and raisin aroma comes through. The taste is dark bitter roasted and chocolate malt. There is a bit of dark fruit and booze in there as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated and surprisingly dry and clean in the finish. Overall, excellent.

Raul is like, “Ok, let’s dig a bit deeper.”  So the Raul man digs, and he sips, and he’s like, “Yeah, it’s aite. But it ain’t no FIS.” Flavor is there, but like my baby mama, it’s also a bit ornery, hot, and insipid.  Throw Bells Expedition Stout out of bed for eating crackers? No no no.

Deep black color with a 1/2 inch tan-to-brown head, receding fairly slowly, leaving thick lacing down the side of the glass. Thick, creamy feel. Chocolate and dark fruit (but less fruit in the taste than in the aroma), mild start with a nicely bitter middle and finish.

287,1444,Mindcrime1000,4.75,"Poured from a single-serve into a stout glass  Pours opaque and motor-oil thick with a fantastic, two-finger, tan, foamy head and outstanding sticky lacing.  The aromas are super and complex. Multiple types of chocolate (cocoa, semi-sweet, and cake batter at various levels); dark fruits; toasted marshmallow; char; and just a hint of booze.  The flavors may be even more complex and nuanced than the nose. Chocolate on multiple levels, sweet, semi-sweet, and bitter, with hints of coffee (but not too much); dark fruits (fig, raisin) and dark cherries steal the show. The char is less pronounced on the palate than it is on the nose. The booze is definitely there, but it's a pleasing warming note, not a burning one.  The mouthfeel is simultaneously thick, chewy, and viscous, and eminently drinkable thanks to some extra carbonation and just the right amount of dryness. It never gets cloying or too sweet.  This RIS is right there at the top of the list. I've had RIS's that are better at certain attributes than this one, but the total package here it tough to beat.

It's black and forms a beautiful mocha/caramel colored crown about a pinky width. The smell is roasty and sweet. The sweetness brings in nice notes of chocolate and molasses. It also has a detectable hop bitterness. The taste comes in the same way. Full of roastiness with a slightly creamy body. Hop bitterness there and the sweetness remains.

Tastes dark & chewy with notes of burnt chocolate, coffee, cocoa, and dark fruits. Feels full bodied with a lingering bitterness and a lastin dark chocolate aftertaste.

Jet black beer in a glass, tan head.  Smell of dark chocolate, black coffee, smokey with a bit of vanilla and dark fruits (mainly fig and raisin). Taste follows in suit, although I get a kind of beef jerky flavor that is not present in the aroma. This brew is complex!

Nose is quite roasty and a little smoky, with good malt character, solid baker’s chocolate, a little sweet cream, a little (but not much) bitter coffee. Good, but for the style, nothing too special. Taste is a little more interesting to me, with a little leathery licorice and some fleshy dark fruit complementing the predominant slightly chewy chocolate, and a zippy hoppy edge that affects the feel more than it does the taste. A little smoke lingers. Fairly light feel and not very boozy, considering the abv. Can’t believe I haven’t rated this before.

By far, the beer with the most flavor and depth is the one that was aged for threee months in the bottle. The other 2 felt thinner.

287,1444,HorseheadsHophead,4.84,"Pours out very dark cola brown, and looks pitch black in the glass, with no light coming through even at the edges. Completely black. The head is brown and creamy, very thick and mocha-like. Retention is very good, and a fluffy ring remains 20 minutes later. The edges of the head leaves sheets of wiry, creamy lacing. The nose offers deep savory umami, dark chocolate with caramel, cocoa butter, some more bitter cocoa powder, gingerbread, molasses, licorice, espresso beans, raisin, allspice, prune, date, and fig. The palate immediately opens up with that soy sauce, beef broth, umami impression. A salty meatiness that causes mouthwatering. Tons of spices, dark fruits, and a huge bready presence follow. The molasses, licorice, and star anise give way to gingerbread, fruitcake, and rye bread with lots of raisin, dried fig, prune, and date. The massive bready malts of the mid-palate give way to a rich dark chocolate and bitter cocoa flavor with intense dark roast coffee. Finishes slightly sweet at first with rich dark chocolates, but the bitterness lingers, tasting continually of bitter chocolate and coffee beans. The mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy throughout, almost like a milkshake saved for the medium-minus to medium carbonation that pushes the beer along the palate fast enough to make it insanely and dangerously drinkable. The balance is both bitter and sweet, but enough of either to enhance the drinkability and noteworthiness of flavors. Overall...yes, this is a world-class stout. It's damn good and worth every penny.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very nice color, really up on this beer. Then the taste. Plug tobacco. Thats the overwhelming taste here. I enjoyed chewing plug tobacco working at an orchard in my youth, and you spit.

Very little lacing. Some legs.  Nose is assaulted by deep dark chocolate followed closely by big expresso coffee. Dark fruits. Plum and apricot. Alcohol. Very rich. Some molasses.  Deep dark chocolate on the palate followed by expresso coffee. Huge dark roasted malts provide the necessary bitterness to offset the sweet chocolate. Dark fruits. Black walnuts. A little boozy but the creamy texture and flavor overwhelms the alcohol easily. Very earthy.  This brew is smooth as silk. Excellent carbonation.  This is a massive stout. Very complex.

287,1444,Lone_Freighter,4.25,"This was poured into a mini snifter. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a less than a finger’s worth of foamy tan head that dissipated within less than about 30 seconds. The smell had a big roasty to semi-smooth bitter coffee bean leading into a delicate cocoa and light vanilla to round it all out. The taste was pretty smoothed due to the date, I’m guessing, still a nice roasty smooth coffee and cocoa delicately weaves together to lead to a decent sly roasty aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation definitely smoothed a bit with a nice drying edge leading into a rounded out stickiness over my tongue.

287,1444,Mateo2699,4.3,"2014 vintage, 10-23-14. Pour is a very dark brown hue, not inky but dark enough. Mocha colored head, lasts a while. Aroma of leather upfront, pipe tabacco, licorice, char. A little hazelnut. Subtle chocolate taste and roasty malts upfront. The rich leather and licorice in the back end. A slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is soft, creamy, and low carb. Glad to try a 3 year aged expidition stout. Always heard how well this ages, which could've contributed to the lack of sweetness. Very good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bum4ever,4.32,Bottle received in a BIF from Crow121 dated 9/2/15  L: Dark black and thick with a small amount of tan head that stayed awhile S: coffee and chocolate up front followed by dark cherry and maybe something sweet. T: slightly bitter coffee followed by dark chocolate. Finishes easy with some dark fruit flavors and a slight hint of vanilla. F: full-bodied and super smooth stout here. Will have to try a fresh one to see if it's always this smooth. O: this aged version is really good and super easy to drink at 10.5%. We'll definitely seek this out again.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ScaryEd,4.59,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 18 months out.  Pours a pitch black motor oil color with a finger of dark caramel head. The head settles into a thin collar, leaving some random splotches of lace as it goes.  The aroma brings tons of coffee, char, and vanilla cream up front. Then comes a wave of dark chocolate and roasted nuts. The back end is slightly boozy, with plenty of fruity notes and just a whisper of hops. Nice complexity here.  The taste is all coffee up front, with huge waves of dark chocolate not far behind. The middle brings notes of vanilla and black cherries, as well as some fig and raisins. Finishes charred and slightly leathery. Big and bold flavors here.  The feel is full-bodied with slightly higher carbonation for the style. Thick, chewy, and creamy as all hell. Has some slight alcohol warmth, as to be expected.  Overall, this is one beast of a stout. It's bold and complex, with tons of flavors and aromas to keep your face in the glass. It's a bit higher in carbonation than I would like, but otherwise this is a world class brew. Well done.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ajm5108,3.89,"Colors are as expected, head is a frothy cream that is pretty persistent. As a fresh beer there is a lot of hop presence but that obviously smooths out over time. Aroma still vestiges even on a nearly three year old bottle, but there is also robust milk chocolate, slightly curdled cream (but in a good way!) and dark malt. Tons of bitter chocolate & smokey coffee dark malt on the tongue, along with vanilla creme and almond. Still some hop flavor floating around but adds a nice bitter kick and doesn't clash. Super silky mouthfeel. Sounds cliched for this beer given its reputation but definitely does better with a couple of years on it, which is pretty impressive for shelf stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,SaltofOH,3.86,"Bottled 9/8/16. Guinness pint glass. Can't believe I have never reviewed this.  A: pours a completely opaque black with two fingers thick, frothy tan head. A little carbonation sticks to the sides of the glass.  S: fruity and hoppy right off the bat. Where some RIS's are malt and roast forward, I get a heavy dose of hops, followed by a dark, roasty, and flinty malt backbone. That head retains a one-finger cap seemingly forever. Nice lacing.  T: arrival is, not surprisingly, sweet. Complex blend of dark fruits, hops, and a good bit of alcohol. This is pretty much how I remember it. There is tremendous complexity here; layers of roast, fruity esters, and hops; but something is off-putting in the alcoholic finish. Bell's signature house yeast maybe isn't so hot (or is too hot?) at this ABV.  M: thick, chewy, low carbonation, slick.  O: for what is probably my favorite brewery, and one of my favorite styles, this beer has always been a miss for me. I think it is one that really needs to be aged. The really high and noticeable alcohol detracts from the experience for me. It is beautiful to behold and smell, and fine in texture, but something in the taste is just not my cup of beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,joaopmgoncalves,4.87,"Two bottles bought at El Cervecero, Spain. One to have now and another to have in one/two years.  Poured to snifter.  A: The body is pitch black. The head, being very minimal and only existing in the sides of the glass, is browny to caramel-y. No carbonation is visible. S: The aroma has a big blueberry profile, mixed together with coffee, roasted malts, a too prominent profile of alcohol and I guess lactose. With the exception of the alcohol that is very noticeable, this aroma is great. T: The taste is incredible, as it has a fantastic and very intense aroma of coffee, a slight one of toffee and dark berries. This is my kind of beer. M: The body is high. Carbonation is a bit higher than perfection, which should be a little less. Alcohol almost goes unnoticed. O: This is MY kind of Russian Imperial Stouts.

F: Smooth and complex with lots of coffee and roasted malt flavors. Mouthfeel is thick and warming but not heavy.  Wow, what an imperial stout.

Retention is phenomenal and there are rings and spotted lacing left all over the glass.  Smell is bitter chocolate, sweet dark fruit, caramel and vanilla.  Taste is the same with a fairly sweet aftertaste. Definitely not cloying. There is also a touch of booze on the finish.  Feel is medium bodied and fairly smooth, but not velvety. Carbonation is a bit high which takes away from the smoothness.  Overall a great stout.

287,1444,RBassSFHOPit2ME,4.73,"Been wanting to knock this off my bucket list for quite some time now. This one more than delivered.  Bottled in October. A very complex stout full of Chocolate, dark fruits, dark cherry, some vanilla, and a vinous character presents it self as it warms. Roastiness & notes resembling coffee are on the lighter side. Not too bitter, not too soft. Silky actually, and it tastes so damn good, I realized that I needed to pace myself. I was near finished with this 10.5% 12oz bottle in 15 -20 minutes or so.  This beer at a few months from bottling already has all the characteristics I look for in the more common West Coast Imperial Stouts I have easy access to after they've aged 2+ years. THIS was very impressive to me.

Taste follows the nose. Roast qualities are far more pronounced along with a strong hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium plus, a little thinner than I'd expect from 10.5%. I can see why people say this beer needs to be cellared. The hops really dominate, suppressing many of the roasted coffee and chocolate notes that this beer could offer. Time to sit and mellow should allow the hops to take a back seat and the roast to shine. 90.25 points.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,cbenson,4.51,"Look: Oil slick black with a quarter inch thick volcanic ash colored head. Short retention on the head. Has the look and viscosity of motor oil. Awesome! Smell: The usual stout culprits with caramel, dark-chocolate, and espresso. A bit more nutty and oaky than typical stouts. It reminds me of Ben and Jerry's salted butter pecan ice-cream. This might be a remnant of the licorice from the Kalamazoo Stout. Taste: It begins a little sour with a sweet and salty finish like a mixture of soy sauce, bourbon, hot chocolate, and raspberry soda. The malt character is moderately starchy. The aftertaste is not as dry as I would have hoped for a high ABV beer but it has a salty and sweet finish that is fantastic. Mouthfeel: The initial taste is rich and noticeably carbonated while the body is only slightly thicker than a porter. The finish leaves a long moistness in the front of the mouth with a more dry texture in the back. Similar to a root-beer float. Overall: This beer makes keeps me guessing with every successive sip, which means it is either really good, really bad, or really weird. I think it lands somewhere between weird and good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Zaktcc,4.88,"Bottled 11/6/2015 Poured 1/20/2017 A - Pours a pitch black color with a 3 finger, coffee colored head. Phenomenal head retention and lacing. Full embodiment of a stout.  S - The most overwhelming aroma that hits right off the bat is chocolate and sweet malts. Dark sugar and molasses are notable as well. An amazing and incredibly sweet scented beer.  T - Although not as present in the aromas, the bitterness of the dark fruits comes out in the flavors. Chocolate, malts and sugar are present as well with a sweet, mild chocolate aftertaste. Fairly bitter but very pleasant and will definitely improve with age.  M - Full bodied beer, well carbonated (especially given the age) and smooth. Creamy texture with an ever so slight booziness to it. Very enjoyable.  O - The stout brother of the Hopslam ale. As an avid stout lover, this brew definitely ranks amongst the best I've ever had. The aroma and aesthics are as near perfect as you can wish for. The flavors are robust and delicious and I am excited to see how they shape themselves with age. Very drinkable and enjoyable and simply one of the best stouts you'll ever find.  Poured 5/20/2018 Characteristics as a whole seem in-line with how I remembered it over 1 year ago. Perhaps changes will become more pronounced with a few more years.  Nevertheless, some changes to note- A - Same as before, less head S - Somewhat more muted. Chocolate is still must noticeable aroma. Molasses seems more pronounced. T - The biggest change I note is the dark fruit flavors have become more prominent. The bitterness appears to have faded and the lingering sweetness enhanced. Booziness and coffee flavorings slightly more pronounced. M - Less carbonation, more creamy and smooth texture. Continues to improve with age. O - Was meaning to have a few months ago and never got around to. First time cellaring and having the willpower to wait to consume one of my favorite beers, and although I plan on cellaring the others for a few more years, I am pleasantly surprised how distinguished and refined the beer still is, albeit better!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nice aroma of molasses, leather, chocolate, minor coffee, dried dark fruit, earthy, and just a slight alcohol note. The flavor matches the smell, just bigger. The blend of the molasses, chocolate, and dark dried fruits is working, and the alcohol is there, but less so than the aroma. Fairly thick on the feel, smooth, with just enough carbonation.

287,1444,OldManMetal,3.66,"The 2016 iteration of Expedition Stout is a slightly effervescent, impenetrably black beer with orange footlights and a medium, slightly rocky brown head; lacing is good, consisting of tattered bands, and head retention is modest. The aroma is medium in intensity: milk chocolate, cocoa and more subtle molasses notes, topped by distractingly strong antiseptic alcohol overtones. The flavor is a moderately bitter, somewhat understated, seamless blend of baker's chocolate and cocoa with more subtle molasses and toffee notes, all over an assertive undercurrent of booze. The finish is a good hit of chocolate, molasses and booze; the linger is a modest, thin chocolate bitterness backed by a solvent-like alcohol bitterness, and lasts for a good while. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the full body, and is warming; the texture is sticky/creamy, thick, and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

Look: Pitch black creamy brown head tons of glass lacing when you swirl the beer.  Smell: Right away I get dark fruits rasin and plum especially. Then you get some of that sweet milk chocolate and dark chocolate. Also the more I smell it I get charcoal and really big roasted malts. The beer smells great though.  Taste: right upfront you get that milk chocolate and big dark fruit notes rasin and plum middle of the mouth big roasted malts dark chocolate burnt wood charcoal in the finish you get a big hop biterness it's like chewing on pine needles. That biterness lingers in the aftertaste to.  Feel: full body it's verging on chewy but it's not quit there. Very smooth silk like on the tongue.  Overall: This is a super complex beer. Just a lot going on and it's amazing that it's not even barrel aged and it's this complex. The barrel aged version of this beer is pretty awesome though. But so is this. The huge hop presence makes this a beer you can age for years. I only see this beer getting better with time.

287,1444,Gajo74,4.54,"Pours a mostly pitch black but with a hint of mahogany. Nice fingernail length mocha head, disapates to a creamy swirl. Ring like lace is slightly sticky. Aroma not too overpowering; hints of roasted malt, dark fruit and dessert liquer. The taste takes on many different variations of flavor. At first, roasted malt taste with an esspresso like, hoppy and raw cacao bitterness in the finish. The aftertaste lingers but pleasantly so. Dry enough to make you want more. As it warms, the dark fruit; prunes, raisins etc come out and it becomes sweet. The ever present alcohol also becomes bolder but not overpowering. Big body, viscuous, smooth and creamy. Robust yet easy to drink. I thought this one was great! I have another one that I'm considering aging in order to compare the difference. Let's see if I have the discipline, because it is that delicious! P.S. I was unable to age the other one as I was too tempted.

I can only imagine what this will taste like when it is bourbon barrel aged. I adjusted my previous scores after trying it last night.... Just opened a bottle from 9-15. The look is black and oily looking as I poured it.It had a small dark brown head. The smell is roasted malts, chocolate and sweet cherries. The taste is sweet up front from the dark fruits and a bitter malt finish with the alcohol clinging to your mouth. The feel is nice and thick. This Stout ages nicely. I have two more which I will let them cellar for at least a year from the date. For a 10% Stout, this is tasting sweeter as I let it warm. I served it at 53 degrees.

Pours black with almost no head, very little fine carbonation. Looks like an RIS. Smell is chocolate and roastiness, a hint of sour cherries. Something yeasty.  Taste is intense -- surprisingly fruity, though. Some nice bright cherry and plum notes, very nice. Huge roast bitter finish. Majorly sweet up front, majorly bitter as it finishes. Nice demonstration of extremes. Coffee, a little chocolate. This is an interesting and very enjoyable beer.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, mouth-coating, with just a bit of graininess.

287,1444,Beginner2,4.14,"With 2261 reviews, I am not about to add more of anything new.... but I will try. This is a classic RIS. Here's why.  First of all, Expedition is a pioneer and has been around for a long while and has set the RIS standard for others to follow. Second, it is one of the better RIS... outside of those that went into the barrel to imbue greater subtleties. Third, Bell's is one of the few second generation crafters -- let's say among the 10% remaining -- that have not sold their business to brand managers. In the main, that is probably neutral. But it is noteworthy.  Finally, let Expedition age. I've had several copies, but this copy is only four months old. This is too good a RIS to drink before two years.

Never have enough patience to keep aging them fully.  Look - Very dark, almost black, very thick. Hardly any head retention, but maintains a small ring around the edges.  Smell - Chocolate, almost fudge or cake, small hint of chili, roasty notes (more so on the very fresh version).  T - Really excellent balance between chocolate and roast with pleasant bitterness that makes you want to keep drinking more. Very slight dark fruit notes.  F - Thick! Very smooth and creamy drinker.

287,1444,hoptheology,4.29,"Aged 6 months from bottling date in the dark.  The pour : Total inky blackness, straight 5,000 mile oil change black with brown tinges from the bottle...you know the kind. Head forms a finger in the snifter and fades to a firm creamy moss on top. 100% opaque. Totally on point for a RIS.  The smell : From the bottle I get smoky lactose and ripe bananas; from the snifter with some agitation I get (a 5 star appearance with an almond head!) more ripe bananas, black cherry, dark figgy notes, raisin, a touch of milk chocolate, and a small hint of metal. Complex, deep aromas with focus on fruits but not quite linear. Solid.  The taste : Less powerful than it was fresh, but still fabulous. I get a mishmash of oats, chocolate, lactose, raisin, banana nubs, with a significant stale metallic note permeating the whole profile. I know this metallic presence was not there before, perhaps it's infected or these 6 months have been rough on poor Expy.  The feel : is beyond amazing. By far the creamiest, substantial, deep stout I've had. Excellent.  The skinny : So basically I think this bottle was an unfair trial as my first one from the pack was totally amazing. The metallic bitterness presented here almost ruins the experience but I know for a fact this was better the first time through.

The intensity builds as it moves through the mouth, finishing with a huge, stinging bitterness.  Motor level oil thickness on this one with light carbonation. Not quite the fullest I've ever experience, but in the top three without a doubt.  Expedition Stout belongs on the Russian Imperial Stout version of Mount Rushmore.

Flavor is also bitter on the front end with some coffee, cocoa, and molasses, and just a hint of that savory, briney, soy sauce flavor that many imperials stouts come with.

The taste is truly outstanding with lots of roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, caramel, and one of the best dark fruit profiles I've ever experienced. The tastes blend magnificently. This stout is rich and very creamy, lightly carbonated, and easy to drink despite its 10.5% ABV. Overall, Expedition merits its lofty rating. It is exceptionally well-crafted and delicious.

Taste- dark Chocolate, coffee bitterness that lingers, possibly some very ripe banana, noticed that after many tastes.  Feel- Smooth, light carbonation but the effect here is so appealing for the style, the ale just lingers on the tongue and the palate, you'll feel it sip after sip it's right.

Smell: Sweet stone fruit, soy sauce, concord grape-like vinousness, coffee grinds, overripe bananas  Taste: Dark plum sauce, bakers chocolate, leather, spicy white pepper. Has a 'soily licorice' roasty aftertaste that is extremely pleasant and reminiscent of Kalamazoo stout. Moderate nondescript bitterness at the back end (the ghosts of hops past) keeps the syrupy sweetness in check. Combination of earthy, vegetal hops and soy-sauce style umaminess in aftertaste not bad, but not great either.  Feel: Thick, luscious, and creamy start with a surprisingly dry finish.

287,1444,kilo_005,4.62,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wide Belgian-style (Duvel to be specific) glass. I gather people drink this beer at various levels of aging - this one was about 5 months old.  A: Very dark and little to no head. This beer has a strange viscosity to it, which some people think is a positive, but to me, it's a bit strange! It really does look like motor-oil, as one of the previous posters suggested - if you look at it up close it even has that same sheen. S: This is where this beer really shines. The aromas are incredible, with all sorts of excellent roasted malts in combination with all the dark fruit / raisiny smells you might expect. But what's so impressive is you don't just get that ethanol smell overriding all that subtlety, even though the ABV is quite high. To get those aromas to come through at that level of alcohol is extremely impressive to me. T: Very good. This beer is drinkable and delicious, but can also be appreciated with small sips. The level of bitterness vs. malt is nearly perfect, at least at the aging that I had this bottle. They got the balance right. The only reason my rating isn't higher is just because the excellent aromas don't quite come through fully in the taste. M: Similar to what I said regarding smell, it's impressive that you don't get hit with any overwhelming alcohol burn or anything like that, despite the high ABV. You can really enjoy the beer. And, although I thought the viscosity was weird for the appearance, it's totally pleasant as far as the mouthfeel. O: I don't think there's really any way to dispute that this is one of the top high-alchohol stouts out there. It's an exquisitely crafted beer and really my only knock is just that I personally think the oily/not-too-carbonated appearance is not great, but if that doesn't bother you then really there's no faults with this beer at all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The taste is complex and hits you in waves of malt, dark chocolate, coffee, caramelized sugar and followed by black licorice. And . . . that is only in the first half of the glass. As you savor the complexity, you may notice dark cherry and raisin flavors too. Watch out for the alcohol. At 10.5 ABV, you do not notice it at first. It sneaks up on you.

287,1444,m_hall,4.82,"Poured from a 12oz longneck into a tulip. This beer is absolutely inky black - no light whatsoever penetrates the glass - and is topped by a huge thick khaki head that falls slowly. Lacing is thick and sticky.  Aroma is dominated by sweet malts, dark chocolate notes, and alcohol, though not to a nose-burning degree.  Flavors hit the palate with a huge wallop of semi-sweet chocolate along with hints of blackberry and caramelized sugar. These are soon followed by espresso and toasted grains, licorice, and smoky notes. The finish is strong coffee bitterness and pleasantly warming booze, and lingers for an eternity.  Mouth feel is thick, syrupy and chewy, coating the mouth as you drink. This is a beer that pours huge and drinks huge... luxurious. Given that body and the brawny ABV of 10.5% this is certainly one you take your time with.  I had heard little about this this stout, and after drinking I have no idea why more people aren't totally geeking out about this one... this is a deep, huge, complex monster of a RIS, completely world class, and should be talked about in the same revered tones as Old Rasputin, Ten FIDY and other paragons of the style. Yes, it's a trifle expensive (I gave a shade over $16 for a six pack) but for a stout enthusiast it's money well spent. And even as good as it is now, this one should cellar excellently. A true tour-de-force.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,AmeriCanadian,4.5,"Damn, this is such a great beer. I'm cellaring some, but wanted to try a fresh one because I had never tried Expedition (Bell's just came to TN this year) and couldn't resist. Look is black and thick and a beautiful dark brown on the edges, with a creamy, thick hot chocolate head that slides down the glass almost glacially.  Smell is dark chocolate, grainy cereal, hot chocolate espresso, molasses, fig, plum, licorice, and dark wood -- big, and bold and earthy.  Taste is deep, dark, bitter, toasty, roasty chocolate and molasses, with a touch of peat and licorice. So rich. There are some wonderful dark fruits in the background, as well, that add an additional complimentary decadence to the beer. This isn't an overly-sweet dessert beer, by any means. Just beautifully deep and dark and drinkable, but highly sophisticated. This beer on a cool night by a campfire? Near perfection.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy and extremely creamy. The residue of the bitter chocolate with a little bitter hops is wonderful.  Not sure there are many better non-barrel aged stouts being produced. Look, smell, taste, texture. Just a fantastic stout. Highly under-appreciated given everyone's tendency to focus on barrel-aged stouts. Cellar some (update several years later: I'm sipping on a 2-year-old bottle that is every bit as good as your typical barrel-aged stout, with incredible depth and still a wide range of flavor characteristics) but don't pass up on the fresh offerings -- you'll never be disappointed with this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,MrWonka,4.28,"Very exceptional take on the Russian imperial stout. Pours motor oil black, with a nice head, though it doesn't last too long. Smell is booze, roast, char, and chocolate. Perhaps some mild notes of coffee, molasses & dark fruits. Taste follows the nose, with roast, char and chocolate coming thru the most. A very interesting stout bcuz it involves so many complex flavors in one. I agree that providing this brew some age would make for a whole other great analysis/taste. For some stouts, the alc% is well hidden, this one, not so much. However, make no mistake my friends; I rated this beer as high as I did for a reason.

This stout smells amazing; dried fruits, vanilla, malts, but almost no sign of alcohol.  First drink is pure heaven, thick and smooth, creamy on the tongue. Chocolate and fruits, absolutely delicious flavor to go with the nose. This is probably the best stout I've had, and my only concern is how I'm going to get all these bottles back to Texas with me.

Dark chocolate and licorice lead the way, with the floral notes playing a wonderful background flavors. The sweetness is very present in the aroma, but the flavor is quite dry.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, milky and chewy with pleasant finish with only the mildest (not unpleasant) tacky texture.

Smell of dark roasted malts with a hint of char and sweetness.  The taste is excellent, with a great combination of bitter notes from the hops and dark malts, and deep rich complexity one would expect from an RIS, topped off by healthy amount of sweetness to balance out the taste.  The feel is thick and viscous, coating the mouth, and accented by the frothy head of foam from the original pour, which holds on for about 1/3 of the beer's consumption, and further enhances the feel.

287,1444,CHickman,4.35,"Bottled 10/16/15, so it's still a young RIS: pours pitch black with a menacing looking darkness which produced a huge 2+ finger brown head that was full of bubbles of all sizes that crackle and hiss as it faded very slowly, leaving outstanding foamy lacing coating the sides forming foamy rings as it went down. The head was like a brown cloud that didn't budge for a pretty long time. Very impressive looking stout.  Smells of dark chocolate, coffee beans, burnt malts, charred wood, cocoa powder, toffee, brown sugar, light piney hops and earthy notes. The dark chocolate is the star of the show, almost dominating the air and really standing out. I like the char and smoky aspects, but don't get much fruit or hops and was a little let down by it's simplicity. It smells good, but not great.  Tastes much better than it smells, wow it's complex and gets better with every passing minute. Initial flavor is molasses, bitter coffee grinds, toffee, dark chocolate and maple syrup, then it turns fruity and sweet with dark fruit such as raisins, dates, red wine and black cherries. Mix in some brown sugar, cocoa powder, port wine, espresso and charred wood or a s'mores that fell into the campfire ashes, and you've got this very complex flavor profile to enjoy. Everything works well together, dare I say in harmony, and it is so smooth for a big beer that it's almost dangerous to drink. Really tasty, naturally getting better as it warms up.  Mouthfeel is slick but thick, chewy and almost viscous like syrup; the sweetness is tamed by the roasted and burnt malt bitterness which gives nice charred notes mixed with coffee grinds and a bunch of chocolate. It's like a dessert in it's richness, fading with a nice mix of chocolate sweetness, faint booze and complex roasted malts that seem to turn fruity and let out more dynamic flavors.  Overall a really damn good beer that hides the 10.5% ABV masterfully and is a RIS I could drink all the time. This is the type of beer I'd love to have in stock at home year round. I imagine this would age with the best of them so I will seek out more of this, as I suspect it will get better with age and drive up my rating.

Poured into a Big Eddy snifter glass.  A - Pours an impressive opaque dark black body, around one finger of dark chocolatey mocha head, bubbly, that leaves behind good scattered strands of lacing. Looks excellent.  S - Big roasty charred malt aroma. Huge complexities of vanilla, oak, wood, chocolate, roast, & cream, with perhaps even a slight touch of fresh piney / fruity hop presence.  T - Taste follows the nose: big dark roast, chocolate malts, notes of vanilla / cream / wood / earth. Big notes of roasted barley malt & notes of char / coffee. Very robust and delicious. Chocolatey roast / malt bitterness.  M - Robust & roasty malt bitterness on the palate. Very smooth & creamy, extremely drinkable stuff for the high abv.  Overall, an extremely drinkable and delicious RIS from Bell's. Definitely a beer I will be adding to my rotating line up of beers more often, and a surefire contender for some serious aging.

287,1444,MichaelNeelsen,4.45,"Did a 10-year vertical with friends. Below are our general thoughts on how it changed each year.  2015 - tastes young, woody, bitter, chocolate 2014 - cherry, milder, sweeter, lost its bitterness 2013 - got more complex, a ""flavor punch"" as Matthew said. 2012 - smoother, milder, back to a 2014 taste 2011 - deep cherry flavor, dark fruit, fig, chocolate, chalky, back to the ""flavor punch"" 2010 - ""I can't tell if this one is my favorite or if I'm just buzzed,"" says Megan. Lost its fruitiness, more date, salt, 7UP, minerals, not as mild 2009 - a small swig tastes like nickels or loose change (oxidation), but a big swig is like chocolate goodness ""going through my body."" 2008 - super woody, smoky, ""the flavor is back!"" says Griffin. Matt ranks this one in the lower 50%. ""Pretty metallic with no strong flavors to cover it up."" 2007 - ""Ooh, very chocolatey,"" says Megan. Smooth. All the metallic taste is gone. Really good. Michael is debating if it's the best of the bunch. 2006 - Smooth, oily, almost like a bourbon barrel aged beer. Salt, no bite, strong flavor of everything that's come before. It's like ""a concentrated version of the current 2015 stout,"" if they put it in a saucer and boiled it, it would be a chocolate or mole sauce.

The finish brings on roasted malt, coffee, chocolate all balanced with some nice bitterness. Slight alcohol warm and heat. F: Interestingly, lots of carbonation in the mouth leads to a creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Easy drinking for its ABV.

A very nice looking beer in the glass.  It has a rich, sweet smokey smell with a hint of pepper.  The primary flavors are very well balanced between the malt and the chocolate, with the chocolate winning out by a hair. This beer presents both sweet and bitter tastes with the slightly dominant sweet being offset by a light peppery finish. The alcohol in this beer is almost completely hidden.  Very smooth, rich mouth feel. This beer is, to me, the perfect pairing of taste and texture. Every sip pleases on multiple levels.  The overall drinking experience associated with this beer is excellent. A beer you can sit and savor, take your time with and enjoy slowly and steadily. Definitely among the best in its class.

The beer opens with a little hit of roasted barley bitterness, then a waive of milk chocolate, raisins, black licorice, and sweetness kicks in.

Aroma of dark cocoa and dark fruits but not much else. Huge flavors of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and a marshmallow sweetness. Quite thick and coats well. Smooth, yet vicious, and the abv is well masked. A truly spectacular RIS!

287,1444,BullDoza,4.12,"A: Dark black in glass. Mocha ring as it settles, and not much else resembling a head. Pretty nice legs on the glass though.  S: Straight forward with Chocolate. Vanilla. A muted nutty flavor in there as well. The alcohol in this big beer is well hidden.  T: Nice roasted coffee bean that wasn't there for me on the nose. Some chocolate. The vanilla I thought I had in the nose doesn't show up on my palate. Bitter bite on the finish. This isn't a complex stout, and that's okay.  F: A smooth 10%'er. Fairly creamy as well.  O: I have been wanting to try this one for a while. Recently received as an extra and was glad to try it. Bottom line: This is a no frills stout. That isn't a negative. It's straight forward and exactly what you'd expect. Is it exciting? No. But it's a well made example of a style we all enjoy in these cooler months.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Sweet gentle roastiness, dark fruit, chocolatey, moderate bitterness in the finish with the lingering roasted malt. A bit tingly, but the alcohol is otherwise not too noticeable. Great balance. Feel: Full bodied, thick with light, fine carbonation. Excellent  Overall: Given the reviews I read about Expedition I expected it to be much less balanced 2.5 months after bottling. It sounds like some people think it's too hoppy initially? However, I think it is already a very finely balanced beer, on par with Old Rasputin or Narwhal. I would say that anyone who likes those two beers shouldn't hesitate to grab a 6 pack of Expedition.

The taste is deep, burnt roasty malt flavor with deep chocolate flavor blending perfectly. There is also a slight hoppy bitterness and the dark fruit is lingering underneath.

Aroma is full of dark roasted malts, cocoa, and coffee. There is also some dark fruits and black cherries.  Flavor is bold and intense. There are all the classic stout flavors of dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, and coffee. Also, more subtle notes of cherries.  Mouthfeel is wonderfully full bodied and perfectly carbonated.

287,1444,Gemmell,4.48,"First taste of the 2015 batch and I am not disappointed. My first review will have to be somewhat biased because I am fully aware of what this beer will become with time. From a 12oz. bottle into the snifter. It pours like thin tar, absolutely no light pierces through this beer. Holding the flashlight of my phone up to the glass, the light is completely obliterated by the depth of this stout. Almost no head exists with this beer. A swivel of the glass brings some foam to life that dissipates rapidly leaving a very roasted/espresso colored lacing crawling down the sides. It smells amazing! Tons of coffee and I mean that is about all I smell. Some chocolate, more heavily roasted coffee and some black cherries. And the flavor is just what I expected...COFFEE! Man, that is delicious! I scored this a little lower than it deserves simply because I know it will get even better, but damn I can't wait for a few years on this; it is very good right now. It was slightly colder than it should have been when I started, and now than its warming up the mouth feel is getting creamier and smoother. Tons of cherries and chocolate come through the warmer it gets and the bitterness that was all coffee fades into a dessert of sweet, sweet black deliciousness. It's like two beers in one. I'll have to review the 2014 in comparison. This is awesome...seek and destroy. Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Amazingly complex, with flavors of roasted malts, burnt coffee, dark fruit, and even a little bit of sour cherry as it warms on the palate. Thick and syrupy in body, burnt coffee bitterness on the finish. The alcohol presence is evident, but nowhere near what you would expect from the high (10.5) ABV.

The palate turns up bitter burnt malt, a fair portion of vanilla (the only widely accessible flavor encountered), bitter chocolate mixed with hop acidity and bitterness, smoke, faint blackberry, and on an adventurous/bad note alcohol and faint acetone appear on the finish. Kinda messy, meaning every sip is different and none are balanced between the wide array of flavors, but spinning the slots with this one is damn fun. This brew is medium bodied, with a slight oily/resinous quality that coats the tongue. I can definitely see the cellar potential, but right off the fermenter this is a pretty awesome brew. Lots of bold flavors that don't care to play fair with each other but somehow mix well together.

287,1444,HopsAreDaMan,4.28,"12oz, dated 10/23/2014 (a year old); snifter. Pours like milk chocolate, with a nice light caramel-colored head that didn't last more than 30 seconds, but a smallish amount of bubbles remained around the edge, and when swirled it leaves a nice lacing effect that slowly dissipates. Strong aroma of dark fruits, with a bit of alcohol burn on the nose (literally!), together which somewhat reminds me of an old ale. The taste has everything I expect in an imperial stout: a tasty complexity of dark malts balanced nicely with the hops, with a dry/bitter finish. Full, creamy, and clean mouth-feel.  After months of first reading about it I finally got to try the legendary Expedition Stout, and I have to say it didn't disappoint. I had it hours after having had Bell's Neptune, and Expedition Stout is by far the superior beer. This beer is clearly one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had.

For a one year old bottle, the hop presence is still strong, mostly fruity which blends well with the dark plum/raisin characteristics to add sweetness. Subtle chocolate and roasted malt notes. Smells to me like a very big, thick black IPA. Perfect carbonation for a full bodied beer. The traits of a bold imperial stout come through more in the flavor. A bitter roastiness, burnt caramel, baker's chocolate, licorice, and dark fruit/earthy hops. Usually not a fan of the hoppy imperial stouts but this one is executed very well.

287,1444,woemad,4.27,"12oz bottle courtesy of LehighAce06 as part of his battery of (mostly) Michigan beers that he sent me as part of NBS BIF # 2. Another Bell’s beer that I had wanted for a long time! According to the label, this was bottled August 22, 2014. Hmm. Pre-aged for your pleasure…  Poured into a Jones Radiator mug, this is a very dark brown, with a big, foam head that is colored somewhere between tan and mocha. Said head left lots of lace on the sides of the glass, and fell rather quickly – not a surprise given the potency of this brew.  Big nose of molasses, coffee and booze, but the coffee isn’t nearly as pronounced as other reviewers indicate – maybe because mine has been sitting for nearly a year, it’s mellowed a bit. Still, the other aspects of the nose give it a suitably unsubtle but tasty aroma – like all good Imperial Stouts!  The flavor does more to convince me this is mellower than it would be when fresh. The mollassly-brown sugar thing leads the flavor charge, backed up by booze, dark chocolate and coffee (in pretty much that order). In the background there’s some figgy-pruny things happening as well, along with notes of pipe tobacco (Referencing a forum rant someone made - Yeah, I’ve smoked a pipe, mentioning that in flavor terms isn’t being pretentious, it’s coming from my own experience). There’s a mild, hoppy zap at the swallow, but it’s nearly buried in sweet and bitter malt flavors that give off a kind of coffee ice cream aftertaste.  Full bodied, with spot-on carbonation and a creamy, coating mouthfeel.  I really, really like this beer. It’s ridiculously drinkable for a 10+% stout, without seeming like a dumbed down version of the style. In a weird reversal of how things usually go, I find myself wishing I had a fresh, harsher version so I could compare it to this slightly-aged version. I may have to trade for this again (or pick up a few bottles if I ever get back to Michigan), so I’ll be leaving it on my “wants” until further notice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The alcohol also does come through at times. T: Begins sweet with chocolate and malt, then turns bitter dark chocolate, pine, herbal-ey lasting finish. Like the nose, the alcohol is there but leaves a warm feeling. M: Full bodied, light to medium carbonation, warm, sticky. O: I only got 2 bottles of this… and this was the second bottle. As per the description on the bottle and brewery website, I wish I had more so that I could age it and compare the differences it would make.

287,1444,Steffano,3.31,"Bottle date 8/22/13. After pour there is very little head, pretty dark color. Smell is coffee dominant. Good mouthfeel. Taste is primarily molasses and licorice, not as coffee forward as I expected, with a little bit of alcohol heat. While letting it warm up reduces some of its harsher characteristics, have to say i'm disappointed in this one given its reputation. I would put stone ris, narwhal, and old rasputin far ahead of this one overall.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,timontheroad,4.51,"Dark black color, with about a quarter inch head, even after an agressive pour. Aroma was very much dark cohocolate, light coffee and some dark fruit notes. The flavor had lots of dark fruity flavors, lighter chocolate than the smell, coffee, molasses, some roasty malt flavors and just a tinge of alcohol. Mouthfeel was pretty thick and chewy, just as a good RIS should be. Overall, this is an outstanding RIS, one of the best non-Barrel Aged stouts out there.

287,1444,Chris_the_Tartar,5,"Looks bitch black, one finger of mocha head. Smells strongly of chocolate and malts. Taste is malts, chocolate, bourbon, wood, ethanol, toffee. Alcohol flavor shines through a little more strongly than I was anticipating but it was awesome. Also a little sweeter than I was expecting. Feel is thick but not not as robust as some other high ABV stouts, complimented the taste perfectly. Overall an awesome beer, really blew me off my feet.

287,1444,TempeBeerMan,4.14,"Poured from a bottle into a beer snifter.  A - Pours jet black with a one-finger dark brown head. One of the darkest heads I can remember. Specks and spots of lacing.  S - Moderate strength aroma of dark fruits, charcoal, and pine. Aroma is much milder and less ""roasty"" than I would have anticipated.  T - Interesting balance between sweet start and bitter finish; espresso, smoke, wood, bitter roast, bakers chocolate, prune, date, and fig. Herbal and piney hops and anise become prevalent in the long finish. Yes, you can taste the hops in this stout. Has a woody, barrel aged quality to it.  M - Medium bodied with higher end of medium carbonation. Excellent creamy/silky feel. Warming alcohol.  O - Quite excellent, and probably best compared to Old Rasputin (another stout with hop character) At times I found myself wanting more sweetness, and at times more roast; a stout that walks such a fine line between the two is fairly unique indeed. I'd be very curious to see what a year or two of aging might do to this, and with 12oz bottles available, why not?",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,michiganmatt,3.85,"Appearance - 4.25/5 Pours a beautifully perfect golden-chocolate colored head. The head dissipates in a minute or so, but the color was awesome while it lasted. The beer itself is pitch black. This beer looks dark, mysterious, and awesome.  Smell - 3.5/5 The smell surprised me. It is very floral and sweet, while still having some tiny hints of chocolate. The smell is also fairly alcholic (unsuprising, at 10.5%). The smell reminds me of a Belgian Tripel. Overall, I don't really think I'm a fan of the smell. It's not a bad smell, but it's not what I want a stout to smell like.  Taste - 3.75/5 Sweet, vanilla, bourbon, slightly roasty. Smoky. Still has that ""floral"" quality, but now in the taste I think it might be better described as caramalized sugar + fruitiness. As I said above, this taste/smell reminds me of a beer I had recently, the New Holland Black Tulip (a Belgian Tripel). The taste is slightly alcoholic as well.  Mouthfeel - 4.5/5 Medium bodied and silky smooth, it glides across your tongue. Definitely creamy, but still the carbonation adds a nice kick. There is a small to medium amount of medium to high intensity carbonation. I love the feel of this beer in my mouth  Overall - 4/5 This is definitely a unique stout, just not quite sure if the flavors are exactly what I'm desiring from a stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,94Sip,4.68,"This is a BIG stout (as expected). The bottle said it was brewed Oct 2014 and I had it March '15, poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  The label said this stout was meant to be aged and I would highly agree with that sentiment. There is a significant booze presence and the flavors were overall ""tight"". It reminded me of the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, in that I think that beer is amazing after sitting in the cellar for a year or two. This beer will probably be incredible with a little age on it.  It is not too hoppy like some of the west coast stouts, but does have just the right amount of bitter to it. The booze hit me initially with each sip, then followed with some of the dark fruits/prunes/raisins. Then the finish gives you some good chocolate/toffee flavors which is my definition of a perfect stout.  With a little age I expect the booze to subside and those middle flavors to come forward and the chocolate/toffee to stay with it and be perhaps a bit more pronounced.  Overall, just a really great imperial stout and ranks up there with the others that I really like.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T - 4.75 - Awesome, sweet malts and medium sweet chocolates upfront, fades into a neutral taste of blackstrap molasses, fennel, star anise and licorice. Ends on a bitter coffee note. The bitter ending perfectly rounds out the initial upfront sweetness. F - 4.5 - Full bodied, decently thick, creamy and heavy mouthfeel.

Wish i could post a picture on this review  Smell: dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee, slight molasses  Taste: The taste is even better! Nothing in particular really hits my palate upfront, rather its a blissful medley of chocolate and roasted malts/coffee with a slight presence of dark fruit mid palate, although i get more dark fruit in the nose. Then the espresso-like coffee character leaves everything else behind and lingers for a bit; But not without molasses finally finishing it off  Mouthfeel: A fairly heavy body; viscous and coats the mouth. Slight alcohol presence but smooth considering the abv. Bitter finish  Overall (4.6): I fell in love with this beer at first sip. From the motor oil pour to the dark and rich aromas and flavors of chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, dark fruit, molasses, and the smooth mouthfeel, this is EVERYTHING you want in a RIS. The only thing that stops me from sipping this everyday is the price, but the taste definitely justifies that. Overall this beer is mindblowing, and i look forward to having it each and every winter.  EDIT 3/2/15: Sippin a 2009 Expedition on draft and this is just spectacular. The aromas and flavors have blended together beyond words. The smell is dark espresso, bitter roasted and sweet caramel malts, dark fruits, and subtle chocolate. The taste is like some of the best espresso youll ever have, dark fruits, subtle chocolate, and a solid roasted and caramel malt backbone. The alcohol from a fresh batch has totally dissipated and the bitterness has mellowed out, although still slightly bitter. This joins an aged oatmeal yeti as the best stout iv ever had. I thought a fresh Expedition was one of the best RIS iv ever had, but this is somethin else. I have just raised my rating a couple tenths.

Tonight I decided I would grab another one to see kind of what the base beer was like because I was going to drink and review the Black Note. So here goes...  Appearance: Black as night not a lot of head whatsoever but very viscous and the head that lays on top is a dark caramel color. With a little agitation the head does appear again but otherwise it pretty much settles to nothing.  Aroma: Licorice, dark burned malts and lots of charred flavors.  Taste: Licorice, burned cream flavors. This is not a beer I would drink cold. At first it was too biting for me, however as it warmed it began releasing more pleasant flavors. Still this beer is on the bitter side. Mouthfeel is pretty much spot on. Not to thin not to thick.  Overall: I have drank this beer before years ago. I was not impressed with it the first time I tried it, I know more what to look for now and although in the beginning I had it too cold and did not enjoy the flavors, as it warmed it was definitely better, nevertheless it is still not one of my favorite beers of the style nor from Bell's.

287,1444,DaverCS,4.69,"Motor oil black. 2 plus finger head with a moderate to aggressive pour. The head reminds me of a beautiful espresso crema (if it was 2 fingers tall over my coffee). Great lacing up the glass. Aroma definitely boasts some alcohol. I do get a presence of some dark fruits soaked in rum, some molasses, brown sugar, and coffee. Taste is rather pleasant. It really doesn’t have much sweetness. The beer is only 3 months old, so it has some bitterness, but I find that the slight bitterness makes it drinkable. I think it has the perfect mouth feel: not overly thick, but not overly carbonated. I get huge burnt coffee and smokiness, molasses in the middle of the palate with a nice malt flavor. Not as much dark fruits as on the nose. You get them primarily near the middle of the mouth. I primarily get a rum soaked date flavor with some raisins thrown in. Almost an oak flavor. I do taste the alcohol a little at the end as the beer warms, but it isn’t as much as the nose would make you think. Definitely coats the palate. Overall, not a bad stout. This beer is readily available and totally drinkable. I like this beer because it has more substance and thickness than some boasting the same flavors. It isn’t overly thick, but the rights blend. Aging would work well for this beer; it would tame the bitterness down making it beautifully balanced. While I like the bitterness, as it warms, it is a little too much for the beer. I could see something remarkable after a year or so. This would be a good beer with some beignets. I give it 94/100.   ***vertical**** 2014, 2015, and 2016. Blind tasting notes.  All Pour very similar in color.  2014: burnt coffee, very bitter, dry with an alcohol bite.  2015: much sweeter. Maple on the nose with tastes of richly toasted malt and molasses  2016: weak on the nose. Oak, coffee, and bitter chocolate. Surprisingly more mild than the others.  For me, the 2015 vintage was the best, followed by the 2016, and in last place is the 2014. From this, I reccomend not to age this beer more than 2 years.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Goodspeed83,4.24,"As another reviewer stated, this is beer is difficult to rate, as the bottle I had is only a few months old. Based on its reputation, I wanted to like it immediately. The first half of the bottle was a little overwhelming. Very bittersweet smell, along with a sweeter taste that becomes very bitter immediately.  I wasn't too surprised, since that bitterness is described by Bell's themselves, but my desire to try it out won over my original intent to age it. In the end, I liked it, but the rest of the bottles went to the basement, to be enjoyed at a much later time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Head is a rich khaki color and leaves plenty of lacing as it dissipates.  Aroma is heady and strong. Intense bitter coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and earthy hops clash and blend together.  Heavy malt on the tongue. Coffee notes go beyond roasted into the bitter/burnt range. Rich dark chocolate as well as some smoke and peat. Hops are strong and lingering on the end with some earthy/loamy notes.  Thick mouth feel with an acridness that is mildly unpleasant.  Overall, a very good beer that could be better if some of the flavors were less intense. The coffee notes in particular could use toned down and made less bitter. While this bottle had 3.5 months already, I could see an extended cellaring improving this a good deal.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rangerred,4.26,"12oz bottle from October 2014 poured into a snifter.  Pours an inky black with the look and consistency of used motor oil. Leaves a quick glimpse of a tan head that quickly fades away. Some nice splotches on the sides of the glass.  Aroma really jumps with coffee, dark chocolate, and prunes. A bit of a charred character hinting at the roastyness.  The flavor when cold is really bitter with a tartness that surprised me. As the beer warmed, however, this smoothed out considerably and everything just seemed to meld. Coffee, char, and dark fruit just seem to be married perfectly with just enough bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. Incredible mouthfeel that is silky smooth and the alcohol is barely noticeable.  Overall, an incredible RIS and very drinkable. Really hits all the high points of the style and is quite delicious.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,JohnnyI,4.52,"The beer pours a rich black, crowned with a coffee colored head that has a custard-like consistency. The foam slowly settles, leaving a solid inch and half thick band around the glass. I don't know if I can call that lacing. It's looks more like a decorative ribbon! There's a slick coating on the surface and an oily film left behind with each swirl. The appearance is sturdy. A hearty looking brew. The smell is quite complex. Pronounced soy sauce and canned mushrooms, with a mild metallic scent. Chocolate baklava with honey sweet figs. The customary coffee, char and dark fruits are there as well, but less so. Subtle booze. The flavors are much more potent. There's an explosion of taste on the first sip. Sweet molasses with roasted black coffee. Burnt malts with black licorice notes. A distinct cocoa toffee finish with charcoal bitterness imparted from the hops and deep roast. Dry and bitter in the end, as the roast simply clings to your palate and refuses to let go. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a hearty creaminess that gives the brew an enormous body. Lively, fine pin-prick carbonation helps all of the flavors burst to life. After a few sips, it leaves a sticky feeling in your mouth. Half-way through the glass and there is a nice warming alcohol heat in the chest. I know this is not a spiced beer, but I'd swear that there is some cinnamon in there. Ultimately, this is a man's beer. Something to warm the winter nights in northern Michigan while staying in the snow-covered cabin. A big, bold Russian Imperial Stout with a soothing touch of rustic campfire goodness. Bottled 10/23/14. I've had aged versions that are phenomenal in their own right, but I still prefer the fresher alternative.

287,1444,EHopkinsi,4.37,"Poured into a pint glass and consumed 19 November 2014.  Date stamp on label reads 135292 PKGD 10/23/14 C. So I'm guessing this stuff is just under a month old.  Look- Pours like a dirty oil spill. The two finger thick head is solid, and has the color of some overpriced candybar frappawhappachinomucca concoction at a coffee shop. Head slowly settles down to a 1/4"" layer of creamy goodness that lasts the duration. Pretty good lacing.  Smell- Malt, chocolate, alcohol. The latter is pretty noticeable, maybe just a little too much so, but not bad. It's just letting you know it's a RIS.  Taste- Yum! Tasty, malty-chocolate notes; more than just a little coffee. That's on the front. It finishes with hops that, while they take back seat to the malt, they aren't exactly shy. At the beginning of the glass the alcohol floats in with, but over top of, the hops. Not excessive or huge, but still pretty dang big, too. By the middle of the glass its rambunctiousness has faded and it is more of a suggestion than a presence in the finish.  Feel- Interesting. A little thin for my preferences in a RIS. That said, it does have a creamy, sticky-lip inducing goodness to it, though. Can't ding it too much.  Overall- One really good stout! I wish the feel was thicker, but the other criticisms almost feel like nit-picking. Getcha some and enjoy it. I will definitely have it again.  Edit- After reading other reviews, I think ""molasses"" is a note I should add in.

287,1444,UrbanCaveman,4.17,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.  A: Pours almost exactly like Old Engine Oil, a thick, viscous black. Almost no head formed with my pour, with what did appear a deep tan. It quickly receded to a ring and patchy cap. No light gets through this beer. None. Not a speck of it, anywhere, along any edge.  S: The smell is roasted chocolate malt, with notes that remind me of a bourbon barrel, oak and booze. There's definitely some dark fruits playing around in the background as well, like midgits running along the hills the FSM made with His Noodly Appendages.  T: A rush of darkly-roasted, burnt-black bitter chocolate malt opens the taste,which quickly transforms into a swirl of flavors. Seared molasses, espresso, cherries, prunes, and figs all dance about the mouth, atop a stage of dark earth bitterness with some pine needles mixed in. There's some alcohol burn involved as well, particularly on the back and finish.  M: Oily, thick, chewy, and sticky, this is what a good RIS should drink like.  O: This is a darned good RIS. Being a malthead, I'd have loved to see a little less showcasing of the earthy-pine hop flavors, which are noticeable and sort of horn in on the malt profile.

Chocolate-covered raisins, molasses, black cherry, roasted malt, charcoal and smoke all play nicely together, with a bit of cocoa powder and piney hops at the finish. Booze makes its presence known at the end of the sip, though after a few sips I've gotten used to it and barely notice anything more than the warming in the belly. And the buzz on the brain.  M: Thick in heft, modest carbonation at best leaves it slightly syrupy - but that's fine with me for a big stout like this.  O: Awesome stuff. I will likely drink this sipper far too fast.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,hopflyer,4.63,"Bottled 8/22/14  Pours pitch black with dark tan head that dissipates quickly but maintains a thin ring around the glass.  Nose is chocolate, coffee bean, and toffee. Some charted wood and a touch of licorice.  Taste is full flavor of rich dark chocolate and mild coffee. Very roasty and rich. Awesome! Charred wood notes come thru and are prominent and some bitterness rounds out this big stout. Almost no booziness detected but just a slight burn hits nicely.  full body and silky smooth. This is what a stout should be. Low to medium carbonation. The mouthfeel fits the taste profile well. long finish and flavors hang around a while.  This is definitely the best stout and best bells brew I've ever had. full of flavor and perfect texture. Bonus for being available in 6pk format.

287,1444,Shroud0fdoom,4.37,"12 oz. Bottle. (2013 vintage) courtesy of northstar23 Thank You!  It's me again, drinking another beer that MD never sees. Unless you're In DC or around VA. Enough of the regional B.S., time for the brew. This brew pours fantastic I might say. Solid black body that lets no light shine through. On top is a Mocha colored head. World class example of an Imperial Stout, IMO.  The aroma should tell me what I am getting into. First whiff I pick up is roasted malts with hints of oxidation (for the better). Brings on a fruity/port aroma that sings to the nostrils. Leaves the backend with cocoa and coffee roast. No booze detected. Very nice!  Now it all depends on the flavor...so tongue what's this tastes like? Like the nose describes plus more richer! Nice fruity characteristics that has been rolled up in English toffee. The malts are roasted and semi-sweet with cocoa. The finish is sweet and dry with slight bitter detection on the sides of the palate. The aftertaste is the pure winner. It's like the sweet/toasted flavor that a great quality Whiskey would provide. The body is both medium built and very smooth. World Class!  Overall: This brew is Amazing. Nothing offensive about it. It comes in like a storm and leaves you satisfied. This perhaps is my favorite offering from Bell's to date. I say that because I've had a few, yet this one leaves me in awe. I'm not going to blab too much about this brew. I will give you this, this brew is Shroud Approved, aka Recommended!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,blbarnett3,4.25,"Poured into an oversized tulip, extremely dark with a one-finger light brown head that subsided fairly quickly. The aroma was dark chocolate and dark fruit, along with herbal hops. The flavor is dark and faintly roasty, with chocolate hints and dark fruits, mainly dried cherry and plum, complemented by assertive herbal, almost medicinal hops. I can see how this would be viewed as a challenging stout, but being a fan of hoppy beer, this was close to just right as far as I was concerned.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,dbell23,4.76,"Reviewed this beer several years ago when you could just give it a number and gave it a 4.5. Now I'm drinking a 5 year old bottle at cellar temperature and it is phenomenal. Looks like a stout with a short lived dark beige head. Nothing special. Smell is dark roasted malt, stone fruit, dark chocolate, and maybe slight coffee. The taste is the most complex non barrel aged stout I believe I've ever had. Dark malt, smoke, slight plum maybe, and just delicious slightly bitter classic Russian stout. Very, very nice. No alcohol taste or smell. Mouthfeel is the winner here. Super smooth and slick with the perfect stout feel. Very full bodied with just slight carbonation. Overall a great Russian stout.

287,1444,ChazLow,4.5,When I first smelled this the immediate scent I got was Chocolate and a hint of oak. It is definitely a sipping beer but for a beer with a higher alcohol content it is very smooth and very easy to drink. As for the taste it is great. I got hints of chocolate and caramel along with some oak and even a little bourbon. Great beer definitely worth buying and you will not regret it.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell- Roasted malt with dark chocolate, followed up with a hint of alcohol. Taste- Bitter on the front. Middle of the mouth you get a roasted coffee and malts taste that's real thick. Finish is dry and bitter.

The aroma is pleasant, deep roasted malt tones and alcohol's sweet astringency. The taste has a pleasant rich maltiness and the alcohol from the aroma fades into the background. There's a just enough hops to balance the huge roasted malts. The body has a nice heft to it and a silky feel. There is a tingling left on the tongue from the big ABV.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,dmgeng,4.77,"Highly recommended and is not as pricey per bottle as many other imperial stouts; excited to try this.  A - Deep dark black. It pours very thick with dark brown head and good lacing. Poured so thick cold that there wasn't any carbonation coming out of solution until I swirled the beer in the glass as I poured  S - First tones that I notice were the dark fruits and then plenty of roasted, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and sweet malts. No discernible hops but there is so much complexity that I just want to keep smelling it forever. Has some burnt chocolate cake that is awesome.  T - The first sip you are overwhelmed with the typical imperial stout flavors with roast, malt, caramel, cocoa, and there is a distinct fruit character in the middle of the taste. Not as much alcohol flavor as I had expected but with so much flavor and thickness I didn't even notice the burn. There is a strong roasted bitterness that helps balance the sweetness from the malt and raisins in the fore tongue.  M - HUGE mouth-feel with light carbonation. Very thick and heavy not allowing your mouth to escape the amazing envelopment of the Expedition. Though it is so thick it seems to go down very smooth and not be cloying or wrecking on the palate other than the coat of malty goodness.  Overall, this is a tremendous beer. So much flavor packed into every sip. This RIS is very tasty and though I've had some beers of this style that I liked more, it doesn't diminish the fact that this beer could contend with the best of them. I know that there are some people out there that would have a hard time dealing with the thickness of this stout and the punch but I love it. I strongly recommend this RIS especially since it is easier to get and cheaper than some other amazing Imperials out there. I still prefer Ten Fidy simply because of the even more rich and malty profile with slightly less of the dark fruits but since it's cheaper I might have to get this instead from now on.

A little bit spicy on the nose to boot.  T - Chocolate upfront. The body is a delicious blend of milk chocolate, plum and dark Sailor Jerry's rum. It is delicious. Spicy rum and hops as the beer passes over the back of the tongue. Finish of chasing a shot of Bacardi with a cadbury candy bar.

287,1444,Nugganooch,4.3,"12oz. bottle dated 10/22/1012 Notes from 08/24/14 with my FW snifter glass  Big thanks @brooklynbrews for this long time want!  A: The pour is semi-thick and settles dark as coal-black in the glass with no light seeping through whatsoever. A thick and steady sponge of mocha tan foam comes to rest over top. Never fully subsides leaving some large globules of lace left clinging to the glass.  S: Smells intensely dark and roasty with black strap molasses up front. Has that light soy sauce likeness with charred sugars close behind. Deep roast grains evoke a chocolate espresso note and this is fairly rich. I get some some earthy hop presence and mild alcohol noted in the back. Really nice nose filled with dark roast and mild scent of wet tobacco coming through.  T: Very chocolaty with cocoa nib, more molasses, dark grains, and coffee extract. I get a deep roast malt char with a delicious marshmallow note and amazing balance of brown sugar sweetness. There is a bit of gritty loam like bitterness with some stale pine to this and it kind of drives more of a cocoa powder coarseness but it doesn’t detract from the overall enjoyment. Alcohol is nicely tamed and I would say this beer is hitting its stride at 2 years. A little light licorice noted in the finish. Delicious stuff here. Drinks so smooth for such a big brew.  M: Full bodied with a super smooth and creamy mouth feel. Turns a little choppy from a moderate amount of bitterness midway but finishes smoother with some light dryness. Nicely balanced with a sticky coat.  D: Drinking smooth and lush with such a rich and complex roast going on. I have never had this fresh but I can say that at two years this is drinking marvelously. A really well balanced drink considering the size of this bad boy. One should probably take their time with this but I struggled to do so.

Taste initially follows the nose, then transitions into a wiff of dates then dark malt with hint of oxidation with some sherry notes, and ends with a bitter and dry cacao. Body is light to medium with slight carbonation. Holding up well but may be getting towards the end, has changed quite a bit from fresh and honestly i enjoyed it more fresh - 2 years out. Missing that huge body and brightness  Bottled 10/8/18, drank 11/10/21 Nose is more soy sauce and umami than fresh. Taste is full of dark chocolate, roast, some hints of old coffee, and bitter roast. Flavors are not as strong as fresh but they all blend and smoothly transition to each other. But im missing some of meaty notes, chocolate complexity, and the coffee in a fresh bottle. I've had a bunch of older bottles think that that while this is nice, it already started to loose some of what makes expedition so great.  Bottled 8/21/14, drank 11/12/21 nose honestly smells dirty, not sure how else to say it. Taste is a waves of chocolate, milk, hot chocolate coco, then old coffee, then deep dark chocolate with hints of roast. Body is silky smooth and still quite full with light carbonation. A completely different beast than fresh and the 2018 noted earlier. Everything is a nice smooth blend but again I still feel like im missing the pizazz of fresh. But again, its just a totally different beer at this point, maybe i shouldn't compare it to fresh.  Bottled 9/8/16, drank 11/19/21 jet black motor oil little head. Smells like bakers chocolate, maybe some coffee in there. Taste is waves of chocolate, light to dark, with a hint of stale coffee, and some chalk and roast.

Smells like chocolate booze! Very strong aroma with big notes of cocoa and alcohol; some slightly sweet dark fruit (but not the overripe sourness of some stouts); slightly earthy bitterness; and a creamy and sugary finish.  Flavor is an excellent mix of roasted barley and chocolate (dark cacao, not added chocolate like a dessert stout), dancing and playing on their journey across your palate. The rest of the nose is present as well - cream, a hint of booziness (especially on the finish), and earthy hops, with a slightly grassy finish - but this is a showcase of malts.  Thick and sticky mouthfeel, full (but not chewy), with a long, bitter, clingy finish.  The beer is a little hot (alcohol; not peppers), but other than that, this is a fantastic, traditional RIS.

The deep roasty flavor emerged with the first swig, also a crisp bitterness. Hints of bitter chocolate and even a bit a caramel as time passed. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Glad I invested in a sixer, and excited to age a couple of these for upcoming birthdays (maybe '15 and '16). What a winner.

There's dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruit and again that subtle hint of black licorice to keep things interesting. The flavors are so well melded.

287,1444,majorbase2,4.1,"Pours a very very dark brown with a small lighter brown head. Okay retention, with some light lacing.  Aroma of alcohol, dark chocolate, and coffee. Roasted malts and molasses, as well. A little bit of nuttiness. Surprising amount of sweetness.  Roasted malts up front (that really stay on the tongue). More nuts, a little bit more than in the aroma. Good deal of alcohol warmth. Coffee. Not as much chocolate present. Just the slightest hint of dark fruits. Not quite as strong of a taste as I was hoping for, honestly.  Mouthfeel is sensational. Heavy bodied. Smooth and creamy. Very little carbonation. Very easy to drink.

Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit (mainly raisins) and perhaps a touch of vanilla.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a ton of roasted malts followed by bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, light raisins and some faint vanilla.

287,1444,mabermud,4.3,"This early 2013 bottle was a hard pour into a brandy snifter. The pour created a phenomenal, beige, creamy, puffy head. The body is a super dark brown. After a few minutes of sitting the head settles down into a patchy cover of fine froth and a solid halo around the glass.  This stout has the usual stout smells, roasted malt, some coffee, and dark chocolate. What stands out to me is the aroma of sweet lactose. This tells me this thing is going to be creamy, hopefully like a chocolate/coffee milkshake.  The taste is nice. Roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and lactose...milky...like a mocha, only better.  The mouthfeel is so-so. It is fine, but it doesn't shine.  Overall, this is one of the better non-BA stouts.

Not as strong a smell as I expected from the looks of it. Mainly smokey with hints of chocolate and coffee.  Coffee, chocolate, smoke, vanilla. Can't really taste the alcohol at all, and finishes with a bitter coffee aftertaste.  Feel is nice, smooth and full.  This was what a RIS is all about. While not the best example of the style I have had, this is a really good one. Big, in your face, no doubt this is a serious beer.

Dark fruity sweet smell with some bitter chocolate. Great head (dark brown) and thick lacing. Complex flavor with roasted malts / dark fruit and it seems that dark fruit influence lingers on the aftertaste for awhile which is a good thing.

287,1444,Stevedore,4.06,"12oz bottle dated 12/27/12 poured into a Bell's tulip and quaffed today, 3/9/13. Review is based primarily on today's bottle but also uses notes from previous bottles from the same vintage which were consumed fresh.  Aroma: I definitely get the dark fruits- raisins, figs, cherry. It's definitely sweet smelling with quite a bit of heat on the nose. Really good smelling imperial stout- the ones I've been drinking are usually roasty and/or hoppy. But this is straight up dark fruit. Really a nice change of pace. (4)  Colour: Pours a dark dark dark jet black, looks great. It comes out with an absolutely beautiful 1cm dark brown head that dissipates within 30 seconds into absolutely nothing, leaving a very thin brown collar over an abyss of black beverage. The lacing is absolutely thick, and swirling agitates the collar and makes it even thicker. You can't do any better than this brew for its appearance! (5)  Flavour: When I first drank it fresh back in December, it tasted rather medicinal with a straight-up overdone cherry tartness- not complex at all and rather hard to drink. I didn't like it at the time but I decided to give it 3 months to see how it changes over time. And it would appear that just a bit of age really develops this beer. The heat has been covered up by a more complex flavor combining hints of the underlying roasty malt character with the dominant dark fruit flavours as described in the nose- raisins, cherry, figs that contribute quite a bit to the aftertaste. It's not boozy at all and has developed nicely in such a short amount of time. (4)  Mouthfeel: On the lighter side of a thick body. Decent carbonation. Goes down smoothly leaving a nice balanced finish that is neither wet or dry. The aftertaste is probably dominantly tart cherry that goes to town on your taste buds for quite a while afterwards. Not the thickest imperial stout but it's a very smooth quaff. (4)  Overall: It makes sense that this beer develops with some age on it as it would seem that Bell's intended it that way. I'm happy that I hung onto the six-pack I bought last December. I'll probably try it at 3-6 month intervals to see how it develops from here on. It's a nice change from the usual roasty and hoppy imperial stouts (e.g. Founders Imperial Stout, Plead the 5th, etc.), as the dark fruits are the strongest contributor to the flavour. (4)  Re-reviewed 5/30/2014. 2013 vintage (7/19/2013) poured into a Bell's goblet. A bit over 10 months old now. Essentially, appearance is the same, and I do get a ton of dark chocolate bitterness with even more dark fruit and some vanilla essence in the nose. Flavour profile is similar, heavier on the dark fruits- dates, raisins- roast malts and dark chocolate mixed in with milk chocolate and caramel, with a bit of vanilla and molasses. Very complex, interesting and decadent beer that has a nice slick mouthfeel that isn't quite too thick or oily but just right. Overall, a great RIS that stacks up with the other Michigan RIS's- Founders RIS and DH Plead the 5th to name a few.  Based on this vintage, I would re-review to a 4.5/4.25/4.5/4/4.25 which comes out to a BA score of 4.35.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,57md,4.48,"Appearance is a deep, dark brown with more than a finger of fluffy tan head. The head seems to linger forever and leaves thin lace rings on the glass. A whiff of alcohol is the most noticeable thing on the nose.  This offering is certainly rich and creamy. The best part of the drinking experience is the finish when the coffee notes come on relatively strong.   Update on 11/21/2014: Sampled a 15 month old bottle from the 2013 vintage today. It was definitely superior. The nose was more potent and the flavors were deeper and better defined – except, as expected, the coffee notes were non-existent. I edited my rating for this offering upward as a result of this sample.  Update from June 2017: Sampled a 21 month old bottle from the 2015 vintage. This beer gets tastier and tastier with age. This is richer and more full-flavored than I can remember from notes on previous samples. As with my previous aged sample, the coffee is practically all gone. However, the resulting depth of flavor is more than an adequate trade-off  Next up: I want to try a 2 year old + sample of this fine RIS.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,magictacosinus,4.55,"Thanks to c64person for sending me two of these, both bottled on ""9/19/11."" Thanks! I've never had this fresh (I really want to), but this apparently only gets better with time so I felt around now was a good time to crack one open. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a teku glass.  Pours not totally opaque (black with brownish tones), yet in the glass, I can barely get any light to pass through this. Looks almost solid, like hardened chocolate syrup when left alone. The mocha colored head adds to the effect, with tons of lacing sticking around with each swirl in a shrapnel coated manner. I'm impressed that carbonation is this good this late in the game - it's very elegant yet powerful in presentation. Really delightful looking and fresh I'd only imagine it looks better.  Ahhh, yes, haven't had a imperial stout that smelled like this in a while - the last one being Marshal Zhukov - it's an effect that I'd like to call the ""truffle"" condition that the best of these imperial stouts hold. At first, there's a chocolate truffle roasted richness (think 85% cacao), with lingering notes of peanut brittle, cashews, as well as lightly burnt toffee, molasses, cinnamon, and coffee. Underneath, there's a plethora of dried dark fruit and herbal qualities that are often found in high quality aged tannic red wines - raisins, figs, prunes, and dark cherry pits. Bright mint, peppercorns, licorice, and light spicy notes from the alcohol finish it up. Everything is wonderfully balanced, and the alcohol is hidden gracefully. Quite extraordinarily opulent, bright stuff.  Wow! This is amazingly rich, yet unlike Zhukov, not nearly as mouth coating or hedonistic - this is far more approachable, with an easy drinking texture and loads of layers of flavors that open up over time. At first, the palate is coated with a dense, dark chocolate flavor, with a powdery, melting sensation akin to eating fudge, alongside toffee, caramel, and burnt brown sugar notes. Then, the fruit flavors explode, to which my friend and I agreed it tasted like a chocolate covered raisin filled with molasses, or a coffee chocolate covered raisin or fig of sorts. Finishes spicy, with light chili powder notes, some mint, light black licorice, kirsch, and light cocoa butter at the finish. The aftertaste is powerful - goes on for a while and rewards the senses with a rich chocolate chili flavored sensation alongside the fruit. This is surprisingly medium body given the style, and it's definitely less carbonated than one would expect, but it somehow works perfectly, driving up the drinkable qualities and yet simultaneously makes this a sipper due to its rich roasted qualities, rather than the sweet qualities that your everyday RIS provides. Creamy, rich, yet very approachable. World class stuff.  This is one of the greats, and with its tremendously high aging qualities, this is perhaps one of the most unique stouts brewed in the country that is available quite often. I'd love to get a case of this and age it, but location is seriously screwing me up here. Simply phenomenally complex and easy-drinking stuff. Rewards you in the long run and sticks it to the hyped beers as any old school craft recipe should. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,ONovoMexicano,4.25,"From the 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.  I like the way this beer pours, thick, creamy and viscous. For a moment I thought I was putting oil in my car. This beer is pitch-black with a finger-thick, dark khaki-colored head.  As soon as I popped the top off, I was getting a big whiff of booziness, almost bourbon-like. Once in the glass though, it's apparent this beer is just big and may not have gotten the bourbon-barrel treatment. There's a lot of dark chocolate on the nose, vanilla and caramel, sweet malt, and some oakiness.  There's plenty of flavor in this bad boy. Initially chocolatey, oaken and dry, the beer transitions to a sweet, creamy middle of vanilla before finishing with a baker's chocolate finish. The beer feels very big, but the heat is mostly buried, and in its place is a good viscosity, allowing this beer to go down pretty easily.  I like this beer for a lot of reasons, but I think the best thing about it is that a single 12 ounce bottle didn't cost more than $2.50. That's a steal for such a monster of a beer.

287,1444,Jay_Ulreich,4.5,"This is the best stout on the planet, IMO. I dont understand how 10 Fidy and Dark Lord are so high up on the top 250 and this isnt even on it! Should be the other way around, IMO!!! I love this beer. Its hands down my favorite Stout. A- When you pour it, the head is alive. Theres no nitro in this beer, but its the only stout thats ever come close to the ""aliveness"" that Guinness has. The heads got that brown and almost deep red color to it. Very sticky, very long lasting. Wonderful lacing. PITCH black. You have to turn on an extra light in whatever room it is in because it makes it darker. You can see how well crafted it is. S- Heres where it really catches my attention.(not that it didnt already have it!) The alcohol is VERY well hidden- a sign of great craftsmanship. I could say things like dark fruit and complex, but I dont dig words like that to describe beer. Its got huge malt character. Chocolate, maybe a little coffee. Definite roastiness.(Is that even a word? It should be) I believe I can smell the yeast, and it is good. Another great thing about it is the hop spice I get, you can almost smell the bitterness. If that makes sense. Balance. Harmony. Beauty. These are words that float through my mind as I smell this. T- Where to begin... There is a lot happening. If I try, I can taste the alcohol, but its not a distinct flavor, like other certain high ABV stouts Ive had recently(10Fidy). Theres gotta be a ton of hops in this thing because my tongue is dancing. Bitter and floral hops are running around. Theres alot of depth to this beer, deep malt, huge roasted flavor. Not smoke, roast. Dark chocolate, coffee- just a touch. Theres that yeast again, I think... With so much happening, its like each flavor is begging to be noticed. I want to say I taste raisins or figs or something, but at the same time I want to stay far away from words like that. Its something else. It has some kind of woody appearance, like it was in an oak barrel, not a bourbon barrel, just a regular old wooden barrel. I pick that up in the aftertaste. I just love it. Its the epitome of an Imperial Stout. Or at least, IMO, its everything one should be. Its really just excellent. M- This is a thick stout. Oil comes to mind, but just as Im pouring it, not when actually drinking it. It is so smooth, and just the perfect amount of chewy. Makes me wonder if oatmeal is used to give it that mouth feel. Once again, this is exactly what I look for in an Imperial Stout. Bells really nailed it with this one. This beer will probably always be in my top 5. I love it so much that I really would be sad if I ever found something better, but as that is damn near impossible, Ill be just fine. Overall, rarely will I give a beer anywhere near a 4.5, because I dont feel most meet those expectations. I dont believe there IS a perfect 5/5. If there was, then you could stop drinking anything else and stop reviewing. Its all about the chase, man. While I think the price could come down about a buck or 2, this is one of the only 6 packs that I feel is actually worth 16-17 bucks. It probly costs alot more for the amount of grains that go into making this big, big brew. The quality is worth the extra dollar. Thank you Bells!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,PsilohsaiBiN,4.05,"Bottle dated 8/22/13.  Appearance: Pours jet black, as expected with a small khaki head that collars quickly.  Smell: Cocoa, graham cracker, roasted malt, dark fruit and some booze heat. Kind of reminds me of Marshal Zhukov's aroma, in that the aroma is nice, but not overwhelming.  Taste: Begins with rich dark chocolate paired with an element of soft cocoa. Middle of the mouth is hop bitterness with nice roast. Finishes pretty bitter with detectable but not by any means overwhelming heat.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, velvety, silky. Very full feel, though not in the realm of Hunahpu viscosity.  Overall: I can see the influence this has on Black Note and am glad I finally got to try it. Can definitely see this getting amazing with age as the bitterness subsides, but it's still not bad at all in its current state.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Suds,4.25,"Dark, almost black, this stout is a creamy and thick liquid. It has a brown head, a solid complexion, and a dense, black color. The smell is of grain, burnt sugar, and alcohol. It has a lot of character...warmth, bitterness, and velvety heft. The beer is very full flavored, intense....some malt. Balanced...neither sweet nor dry. Full body. Lengthy and smooth finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Tsar_Riga,4.02,"Bottled in October 2012.  A - Beautiful black, completely opaque with a small, tan head, which fades quickly but maintains mild lacing.  S - Dark fruit and malt and roast, with a strong booze note.  T - Bitterness is the spine, but it is paired with a sweet undercurrent, made up of raisin and plum, chocolate and malts. The addition of a strong liquor element makes this much like biting into a liquor-filled chocolate. But as the sweetness fades, the bitterness remains. It is not a hop bitterness, but more a roasted malt bitterness, of burnt toast and the charred edge of a beef roast.  M - This is complex. Very mild carbonation, but still some acidity. Some warmth from the alcohol, but surprisingly minimal, given the ABV. The beer coats, but not aggressively so.  O - I like certain aspects quite well. The beer holds its ABV well, and with 1-1/2 years, it is not a big, hot mess that it could have been. This is a sipper, and not on drinker. I like my stouts with strong coffee notes, and that is not the game here. Nevertheless, the balance achieved as this ages is a impressive. A second take, with 4 years, smooths the warmth further, but the basic dark fruit and strong bitterness remains consistent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Good legs on it too.  S - Aromas of char, nutty roasted notes, faint alcohol, flashes of dark fruit. Very, very faint hops. Awesome dark chocolate. Almost brownie like!  T - Taste is sweeter malts, chocolate, rich roast, light char. Flashes of occasional pine, alcohol is nearly nonexistant. Faint, faint bitterness. The roast malts and rich rich chocolate are really just awesome here. Not quite brownie batter, but awfully close. The nuttiness is really fun here.  M - Mouthfeel is great, just great. Maybe a hair less carbonation on the finish would make this a 5. Creamy, rich velvet, hardly any alcohol.  O - Overall, this was a very, very good beer.

Molasses. Oh boy.  T: Sweet roasted malt notes turn into a firm hop bitterness that yields to great dark chocolate & coffee flavors. Semi-dry finish. Moderate alcohol, consistent with 10.5%, but I don't mind at all. Some oaky, bourbon notes. Toffee. Tasty.  M: Low to moderate carbonation with a full body. Silky smooth and palate coating.

287,1444,rickcrip76,4.04,"Ended a night out with this at Brickstore Pub in Decatur, GA. Ordered the 2009 vintage.  A - on target with my expectations: jet black, viscous, and a finger of brown head  S - all the usual suspects of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. What really caught me off guard upon sniffing this beer was the very distinct and prominent presence of spearmint; not the usual odor I come across.  T - Follows the nose, roasty, chocolate, burnt coffee bitterness on the back end... the spearmint did not carry over too much in the taste. A big bold beer. I thought the ABV was hidden well.  M - Thick, rich, and full bodied. Carbonation was present but not overly so.  O - Great beer. I was surprised that when I read other reviews there was no other mention of the mint in the nose. I don't know if it was a product of the cellaring process or if my nose and palate are that bad.... but it was there. I would drink it again, but I don't think I'd have more than one at any given time - it was a good beer to close out an evening.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

As I let it sit, molasses and dark fruits emerge. I enjoy the complexity of malts, chocolate, and char.  T - Starts with sweet, ripe, dark fruit, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Intense bitter char follows. For the first few sips, the burnt flavor dominates and lingers. As my palate acclimates to the charred assault, coffee and roasted nut flavors become more prominent. Milk chocolate on the back end, as well as a considerable alcohol presence.  M - Thick, luxurious feel. Light carbonation. The finish is a bit hot.

A: Dark brown with a one-finger tan colored head that quickly dissipated and left only small amounts of fragmentary lacing.  S: I have a cold so I wasn't picking up much beyond cocoa, some roasted malt, and a little coffee.  T&M: Rich, creamy, luxurious cocoa--not anywhere near too sweet--backed by the subtly warming presense of its not unsubstantial ABV. I wanted a little dark fruit to be mixed in but couldn't find any; maybe with age? Carbonation was just about perfect for my taste and the body tended medium toward heavy but smooth and creamy. Was a little thick on my tongue at the finish--which lingered for quite awhile-- but overall kind of pleasant. It left a taste of dry cocoa powder on the back of my tongue. The alcohol was warm but it didn't burn. Very nice.  Overall? I'm glad I still have five of these left and will probably let a few age for a year or so (still craving some dark fruit amidst that slightly bitter cocoa).

287,1444,RickS95,4.12,"Pours an extremely black beer with only some lighter brown tints when held up to light. The light doesn't come through, but the faint brown only shows then. The head is gorgeous, a mocha colored pillow of bubbles. Retains very well and leaves an attractive film of lace.  The smell isn't as aggressive as I'd like, but it's all malt. No evidence of hops, just malt. A bit of chocolate and smoke.  This bottle has only been around for five months, so the flavors haven't yet melded together. It's abundantly malty, with a nice kick of alcohol from mid-sip throughout the finish. I've got a four pack and I'm having two tonight, so I expect when I have the next two bottles this score will go up. Currently, there's little complexity as it goes simply from malty to boozy.  Smooth is the word of the day. It's exceptionally smooth and creamy. An initial blast of sweetness precedes the heat from the alcohol, as well as the bitterness from the alcohol and the chocolate. The finish is both warm and dry, and lingering. Full bodied creaminess. It's so soft for such a strong beer.  While a bit bitter and relatively high in ABV, it's quite easy to drink. As it warms more and more sweetness comes out, making it even more drinkable.

It's not an every day beer, but I would certainly get this one again. Great for cold winter nights. Prost!  2014 vintage:. A lot of the original flavors still present. A bit more roasted and dry.

287,1444,martyl1000,4.47,"UPDATE 7/31/15 Yep, my 2014 update for the 2013 (below) Expedition was entirely sound. Having mellowed nearly a year in the cellar, this bottle of 2014 Expedition holds its place near the tippy top of my double stout fave's of all time. I have 11 more bottles in the cellar. Yay!  I also have six bottles of the 2013 in the cellar. I'm shaking my head at the hedonism that awaits in those six bottles.  If you're trying this out with a fresh bottle, what Bell's says about it on their label is quite accurate:  . . . . . . ""Intensely bitter in its early months, the flavors will slowly meld and grow in depth as the beer ages.""  That night at Fischman Liquors in 2013, I rashly rated this 3.75. When fresh, this brew has a bitterness that just won't quit. But, throw it in the cellar for a while, and, voila!  ----------------- UPDATE 8/1/14 I seriously have to upgrade my previous 3.75 rating from last summer. Perhaps the tap lines at Fischman Liquors last year needed to be flushed. Even more likely, it was served too cold. Whatever the case, the specimen I'm now this moment holding in my hand is fabulous.  A fairly aggressive pour into a tulip glass gives a small head, w/ almost no lacing (a sign of high abv, with slippery solvent alcohol refracting on the glass). The aroma is still remarkably weak (though subtly rich with a quiet majesty--just too quiet). I get in the nose a woody alcohol, plus uncooked pasta. And a bit of leather (but in a good way; I don't know how that's possible, as I detest leather in beer).  But the flavor in the mouth, wow, that's a different story. Incredibly complex. The flavors oscillate between a balance of bitter and sweet: burnt coffee and milk chocolate, black licorice and caramel, honey-baked ham and oatmeal-raisin. Wait, that last pair are both sweet. Plus an alcohol heat and an odd salt that helps cut the sweet.  A fullish-bodied, slick-viscous texture like warm maple syrup. Yet that creaminess is leavened by a mild to moderate carbonation, even as the pour in this tulip glass has risen to room temperature. ------------------  ORIGINAL RATING & REVIEW 7/2015 Rating: 3.75  On tap at Fischman Liquors, Chicago  I am not impressed. What a letdown the flavor is upon seeing this be-you-tea-ful black pour. It's nearly devoid of aroma. And in the mouth, the flat, coffee syrup (if there were such a thing!) is not quite welcome.  Several hours later, I'm getting the aroma, now, from the warmed-over tulip glass: orange peel, black pepper, black cherry juice, unripe tomato, and dopplebock malt. That's a pretty astonishing aroma. I only wish I could say the same about the flavor in the mouth.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

However, was dissapointed once I took a sip.... it is SICKLY sweet! I almost couldn't drink it. The flavor was good, what I would expect from a nice dark stout like this, but the sweetness was too much and by far overpowered the experience. So sweet that I didn't even realize it was a 10% ABV selection until after I had a few sips.

Pours an opaque pitch black with a mocha head that dissipates immediately, leaving a thin layer of foam on the surface. Leaves oily legs on the glass.  Aroma is intensely dark, bitter roasted malt, rich chocolate, and booze. This isn't barrel-aged, but it almost smells like it is.  Taste is bitter, oily, rich, and boozy. A nice balance of some very intense elements but like a dark chocolate torte, I wouldn't want this in large quantities. 12oz is perfect.  Smooth, slick mouthfeel with a semi-dry finish.

287,1444,HattedClassic,4.28,"The beer pours very little head but still leaves a nice brown ring around the inside of the glass. Despite the lack of head, the beer still leaves some nice lacing. The beer is less of a pitch black and more of a very dark brown similar to dark chocolate. Unlike other Russian Imperial Stouts, the beer appears to have smooth surface. The beer has a strong sweet dark chocolate smell but with bitter undertones such as cocoa and the occasional hint of smoke. Additionally, the smell has hints of booziness with slight fruity hints. The smell is not very strong but is certainly complex. Unlike the smell, the taste is extremely strong and complex. The strongest flavors appear to be roasted malts and cocoa but become subtly overwhelmed by a dark chocolate taste at the end. The beer also has a slight boozy and vanilla taste as well that complements the other notes. The mouthfeel is very smooth and rich. Even though the beer is full-bodied, the beer is not heavy. Rather, the feel is more present that you know its there but not so much that it overwhelms.

287,1444,MaximalC,3.98,"Pours nearly black with a minimal head of coarse mocha bubbles that settle teasingly on the brink of dissipation. The beer features a deep molasses color even as it streams from the bottle, which is generally a sign of quality in stouts as far as I'm concerned. The aroma smells of molasses, dark fruit, toasted bread crust, and shades of alcohol that singe the nostrils slightly. Shades of raw sugar emerge with subsequent acquaintance as well.  Bold flavor greets you like a kick in the teeth upon sipping. Molasses-like sweetness is offset by bittering roast, alcohol, and a healthy dose of peppery, herbal hops. These constituents engage recklessly at first before settling into an appreciable stasis. The bite on the front end is nearly caustic, but the rich sweetness of the malt staves off total annihilation just in time. The finish, once it is finally revealed, affords a very nice roasted character with shades of bittersweet chocolate. The body is full, and the mouthfeel lush and wholesome, the way a stout should be.  This is definitely a slow sipper, even for an imperial stout. The upshot is that it's rich, full beer brimming with the bold flavors expected of the style. The bite of the hops is slightly excessive on the front end, but it's not a fatal transgression by any stretch. It's certainly the best thing I've had by Bells, which typically struggles to impress me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - The smell is slightly off-putting of rubbery leather, but also with a dark, roasty, chocolately coffee.  T - Here's where she pulls on through! It's very robust, full of roasty, Brazilian-like coffee bean. Also a slight of dark fruits. Very similar to Oskar Blue's Ten Fidy.  M - Don't be fooled with having almost no head because you feel the carbonation. It's not overpowering, and has a very creamy fill.

287,1444,Brenden,4.12,"Thick and rich, this midnight-black stout looks every bit as big as the any RIS could strive to be. It's got the motor oil viscosity that makes these beers so appealing, not to mention great for cold weather. The brown head forms a solid cap between one and two fingers high with lots of density to it. It drops fairly chunky lacing rather plentifully. The aroma doesn't pop out of this brew, but it is big. It's heady, too, some sweeter sort of rum-like booziness tempting the nostrils along with some moderately bitter, somewhat milkier chocolate, almost smoky roast, and mostly sweet dark fruits with a touch of tartness. It's almost complete, and some char tickles the nose a bit much, but this is nice regardless. The big malts start off with sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla even as the chocolate comes in along with coffee grounds, not spent but not quite fresh. Still, this is very tasty stuff, and the alcoholic heat is kept pretty well in check as well. Char comes out with the roast in the middle, while the blend of dark fruits rounds out the finish. Where this beer really shines is the feel. If ever I was tired of middle-of-the-road breweries brewing a medium or barely full-bodied RIS and I needed something I knew I could find, there's no question this substantial, robustly-bodied beauty would do it. It coats the tongue almost luxuriously but doesn't sit too heavy though it's seriously thick and rich. A little char adds a drying note into the finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,krustster,4.68,"2013 bottle (fresh). Very dark brown, not quite black but close. Not quite as syrupy in appearance as some imperial stouts but still nicely thick. Big, fluffy, dark brown head that stuck around for a good few minutes with lacing that sticks all over the glass. Very appetizing appearance.  Smell is ""big chocolate and coffee with a lot of roastiness"" (feels stupid saying that, but it's accurate). This one is a lot stronger on the chocolate elements than any I've had, second to Samuel Smith's Chocolate Stout, and this one isn't even made with chocolate as far as I know. Just the right hint of alcohol to bring things together.  Taste is amazing. As usual it follows the nose, with lots of dark chocolate up front, coffee second, not a lot of the expected ""dark fruits"" but some reasonably strong bitterness. The first time I tried this it seemed more bitter than it does now. Drinking it again I can tell how perfectly balanced this thing is. The alcohol is well hidden but at the same time it comes out in the finish with just the right amount of heat to seal in the flavor, a phenomenon that I absolutely love and is the main reason I prefer high ABV brews. This has just the perfect level of heat washing over your tongue but never becomes ""boozy"" (which isn't a bad thing in itself). Everyone keeps screaming about how good this is with age on it. Well, I have a six pack left over that I plan to save for a while, but when it tastes this amazing fresh, I don't know how long that sixer is going to last.  Mouth feel, which I already covered in the tasting notes, is near perfect as well. The carbonation is just high enough, the alcohol heat just high enough, and the viscosity just thick enough to stay on your palate for a long time after each sip.  Overall this isn't quite perfect but can still be called an absolute masterpiece from Bell's. I wish I had bought more than I did while it was available so I could age a bunch of it while still blasting huge amounts in its current condition, because it's pretty amazing as-is.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Cyrion,3.79,"Poured into a nonic pint three months after bottling.  Appearance: Looks like used motor oil, thick, dark and viscous. Dark tan head with tiered lacing on sides.  Smell: Sweet cocoa and some dark fruit. Nice.  Taste: Very chocoately starting out. Tends to overwhelm other flavors. Some chocolate-covered cherries, as well as some smoky wood taste. Some coffee flavor begins to appear in time, but is not prominent. A bit of alcohol heat begins to make its presence known, but the chocolate and other flavors try to hide this, and do pretty well.  Mouthfeel: Very, very thick and heavy. More than just chewy.  Overall: A good chocolatey stout, but a lot of the flavors are buried under the chocolate, and this hides the complexity. Gooey goodness, but this beer retains a good deal of its mystery.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Kelly88,4.21,Poured a 6 month old bottle into a Bruery Snifter.  A- after an initial slow pour I dumped the rest of the bottle to create a nice mocha colored one (fat) finger head. After ten minutes there us still a nice foam skim encircled by a khaki ring. The body is a black coffee and totally opaque.  S- best thing about this beer. You put your beak in your glass and this beer blows you away. Hits you with unroasted coffee and blasts you with chocolate. A deep wiff must be what Gustaf smelled moments before he fell into the chocolate river. Two dimensional but done very well.  T- The taste is less attractive then the smell for only one reason and that is the heat of this beer. You are greeted by a dark chocolate wave with a beautiful under tow of dark coffee and even a welcome pinch of pepper that holds it together. After all of these great flavors you are walloped by all 10.5% and your beer turns into a nice Kentucky Bourbon. Cellar this beer at least a beer if you have the willpower.  M- medium weight that is silky. Like drinking milk. In this case bourbon infused chocolate milk. There is a nice touch of carbonation that arises from the black depths to give your tongue a tingle.  O- a world class beer that needs time to develop. But a t 6 months it is a beer best enjoyed in a cold night when you need warm me up.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: Thick and as dark as I have seen, strong head, seriously pitch black though  S: Strong coffee and dark chocolate smell, pretty much what you would expect  T: Syrupy would be the first word I would use. This tasted very thick like chocolate syrup (more so than I would have liked or expected). Heavy dark chocolate taste but not as heavy on the coffee taste as one might think. Not terrible but definitely not as good as I had expected.  F: Creamy and syrupy would sum this up nicely. Thick to say the least.  Overall: Not a fan.

Startlingly dark. Nice toasted marshmallow head that doesn't hang around too long. The lacing is high and tight. Cirrus clouds up near the top of the glass.  S: Real sludgy italian espresso. The faintest wisp of chocolate. Stewed black tea and some cola tones. A semi-sweet vegetality, darker than any dark fruit. Beets, maybe.  T: Crushing dry bitterness with a boozy superstructure. Like black coffee liqueur. Sweeter than on the nose, shifting to black currants and acai. Lots of fennel and tarragon. The alcohol is there, but only to spice the tongue very slightly. Nicely put together.  M: A bit oily, which leads it to hang out in some weird places on the palate longer than it needs to, but lands properly for the most part. Dry and full.

287,1444,Kadonny,4.2,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle dating has this bottled in August of 2013 so it's fairly fresh.  A: A deep dark black color that allows no light to come through. A normal pour produces a 3 finger light brown and reddish head. Nice full glass lacing sticks.  S: Lots of stuff going on here. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, espresso, tobacco, tar and some dark fruits. Wow.  T: Follow the nose on this one. Loads of dark chocolate, coffee grinds, huge roasted flavors, some tobacco and slight dark fruit flavors. Not much sweetness on this one and then the finish turns into a bitterness bomb. Alcohol is tasted at the end but is very well mixed with the other flavors. The beer is a bit edgy when young, so be ready for it. This is a fantastic and complex beer.  M: Full, coating, prickly, bitter and alcoholic. Nice.  O: This is a top shelf stout that will stand up with the best of them. It's fantastic fresh but quite extreme when young. I also know it ages with the best of them so don't be afraid to stash a few of these away. I bought an entire case and will be enjoying them over the next 2 years.

Appearance: I poured aggressively thinking this wouldn't give me much of a head, boy was I wrong. I got about 90% of the beer poured and the glass was full, almost half with foam. Gorgeous beer, and one of the best RIS's I've seen. As you'd expect, the beer's an abyss. The mocha (almost orange) three finger or more of head dies down to about half of one. Lacing is phenomenal.  Smell: Quite good, but just not quite what I was hoping for. Has a very nice aroma to it, but it's not as pungent as I was hoping for. Maybe it's the thick head I have on top that's blocking out some of the notes. Roasted coffee, deep, dark chocolate, a hint of smoke/ash, and a bit of soy sauce. As Expedition Stout warms, nondescript dark fruits come out to play.  Taste/feel: First off, the feel. It is every bit of what an RIS lover would hope for. Super thick and creamy, with a subtle carbonation. The taste is fabulous, though, like the smell, not killing me with gigantic bold flavors, and the bitterness isn't nearly as harsh as I was lead to believe. Like the smell, roast, coffee, chocolate... there's also a pretty big ash sort of flavor on the finish. There is an alcohol warmth (surprised, surprise!), but there doesn't really seem to be an alcohol flavor... maybe slightly.  Overall, I actually want more out of this. It has a big body. It has a really bold ""feel"" to it, but the flavor isn't reeking of coffee or chocolate like I thought it might. Still, I'm ecstatic that I enjoy RIS's as much as I do now.

287,1444,deadonhisfeet,4,"2012 batch reviewed in 2013. Poured from a bottle into a Founders snifter. Very black, thick, viscous pour but the carbonation is extremely low. A rough pour produces a very thin head. The nose is really nice. Lots of char notes, dark fruit, and espresso. The rich dark chocolate notes I sometimes find are not here. Perhaps more time in the cellar is needed.  The beer has a full body, a somewhat oily feel, and a big roasty flavor. Some creamy malt up front is punctuated by intensely bitter roast and coffee notes, dark fruit, and burnt, crusty chocolate cake soaked in rum. The bitter roastiness lingers a long time in the mouth. It's pleasant, but a little one-dimensional. I don't detect any rich complementary flavors to go along with it.  Bought this 6-pack last year and this is the first bottle I've touched. You can spare me the ``drink one fresh'' speech. I've had this beer fresh many times, I was never impressed, and I don't think the brewer intends for you to drink it that way anyhow. Since its reputation as a good cellar beer is undeniable, I plan to re-review it at 12-month intervals. This one is about 14 months old and, while good, still has lots of room for improvement. At present, it can't hold a candle next to my favorite RISs. I look forward to someday trying one of these that's 4-5 years old. Consider this review a work in progress.  app 4.25, nose 4.25, taste 4.25, feel 4.25, o 4.25 Same batch reviewed in 2017. Poured from a bottle into a Stone IRS snifter. Pours black and viscous and still manages to sport a finger of dark brown head. On the nose I get burnt chocolate cake, liquorice, dried fruit.  Full bodied with a firm feel, a bitter, roasty flavor up front, and a soft, sweet, cola-like finish. The first flavors to greet me are the char, coffee, and bitter chocolate flavors characteristic of the style, and also an herbal, woody tobacco-like bitterness as well. Just past mid-palate, the bitterness comes to a screeching halt and this nice creamy vanilla-like sweetness starts to peek through. Is this what I have to look forward to as this beer continues to age? I hope so. 5 years in the bottle have definitely dampened down a great deal the harsh, woody bitterness this beer displays when young, but there's still a lot of it there.

Ordered it in bottle (2012) and this beer had a ridiculous amount of head for an imperial stout, smelled like cherries and chocolate.  Very smooth and not at all boozy which could be expected in a double digit ABV beer.  This beer was absolutely perfect going down, even better than Black Note in terms of drinkability. Apparently my bar has Bell's Cherry Stout waiting to be tapped so I'm very curious to try that.  Overall, I'd order this again without batting an eyelash.

Not much to it, but this is a label that shows what Bell's is all about. One of my favorites from them. Poured into a Bell's pint glass.  A - black in color with dark brown edges. Very RIS like, duh! A dark tan head rests on top and is actually fairly nice In size. This stout pours and looks ridiculously thick and massive. It's an excellent take on the RIS style.  S - chocolate and dark chocolate malts with an abundance of roasted goodness. Black coffee bean creeps up but is fairly minimal to the malt character. Dark fruit and the slightest whiff of licorice were detected down deep. With some smoke in the back end of the nose.  T - bitter chocolate and dark ripe fruit make a real bittersweet start to the taste. Layers upon layers of dark chocolate and roasted malt swing massive right and left hooks into my palate only to take a short break with a small hint of coffee bean and smoke. A massive bittersweet finish.  M - big bodied and thick. We all love thick. It bombs the mouth with loads of stout goodness. This is a big stout. It drinks and tastes like a big stout. It's not something meant to down easily one after another. This as good as it gets in the world of overly huge imperial stouts. This will make a man of you.  O - when you pair Bell's Brewery and the RIS style you get Expedition Stout and boy am I glad those 2 hooked up. This is one of the best year in and year out imperial stouts you'll find. It's something I enjoy every winter and something I look forward to aging. Oh yea, I forgot about that.. Expedition Stout does well setting in a cool dark place for any period of time.

It was, to date, the best pure Russian Imperial Stout I have ever tasted. The absolutely creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation coupled with the perfect balance of bitter chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, and a touch of vanilla, and the fact that the 10.5% alcohol was completely hidden was just awesome.

T - Creamy milk chocolate upfront, sweet and decadent, heavily roasted malts and strong bitterness come in quickly and overtake the creamy sweetness. The middle provides anise, smoked molasses, and a strong bitterness that runs throughout the drink.

Moderate micro carbonation, dry roasted finish. One of the best mouthfeels I've come across.  There's something to be said about being complex in a simple way.

287,1444,rodlavers,4.46,"I have had this several times and never thought to do a review. This particular sample was bottled on 10/02/12, and I saved it specifically for 1 year to see how it aged (could not wait any longer for this). Results are in:  Poured slowly into a snifter, no head, blood red ring around edge of glass, no lacing. nearly black in color, but resembles cola, slightly. It's smooth and has decent legs. Coffee and chocolate aromas, with roasted malt as well, and perhaps some dark fruit as well, but very minimal. All of this offers a really rich smell. Complex.  Taste is similar, but with a bitter character to it. Very bitter coffee. But so good. Not so much dark fruit in the flavor. Rich coffee and dark chocolate dominate.  Feels smooth, minimal carbonation, a bit hoppy for a stout, maybe it's just the bitterness of the coffee and the chocolate.  Overall, this is right up there with my favorite stouts. I need to buy a case of it this year.  Cheers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gatch,4.62,"Bottled on 9/19/11...so if my math is correct, it's two days from being two years old! Picked this up at the Bell's Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo with a sign on the cooler door that said temperature fluctuations of beer in a bottle is fine as long as they aren't extreme temps. Learned something and therefore didn't stress about carrying this in my trunk with some other beer on a roadtrip from Denver. Downtown Kalamazoo is pretty nice, by the way.  A: Dark as any beer could possibly be with a huuuge dark brown, bubbly, frothy, sticky head that leaves behind great lacing and retention. One of my finer pours.  S: So deep and complex. Lots of dark fruit, super dark chocolate, roasted and charred malt, dark earth, wood, licorice, black strap molasses, and definitely some sharp booze.  T: Whoa. Everything that's in the nose but better. Way better! So rich, so flavorful, so damn good. Heavy on the roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and dark, sweet, dried fruits.  M: Not surprising here...incredibly smooth. Great body, minimal carbonation, and flavor that is off the scale. Fairly easy drinking for its' strength. But the finish is very sweet, strong, and dark.  O: An outstanding and unique stout. I imagine this would be pretty harsh fresh so I'm glad I was able to enjoy it after two years of aging and mellowing.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,scotorum,4.17,"Amazed to find sixpacks of this BA high-rated stout in Florida. Previously I had only found any Bell's at the Cratf Beer Outlet in Philadelphia, and then only a few of their lower-rated products. Bought one bottle to try, in a mixed fourpack.  Was hoping for something really exceptional, but although I found this very good, it was not amazing. The ABV was hidden quite well, but that is not necessarily that difficult to accomplish with an imperial stout.  To be fair, I am not the biggest fan of Russian Imperial Stouts. Generally I much prefer a sweeter milk stout.  As a caveat, I drank this within a day of purchase. Unfortunately aging it first as recommended was just not practical. OTOH I did not check the bottling date, so cannot vouch for the freshness of the 12 ounces I had.  UPDATE 1/8/14: Back in Florida and bought a relatively fresh bottle in a mixed six at Whole Foods in Orlando. ""Packaged 9/19/13"" so this was being bottled about the time I was drinking my first one! Here's a more conventional review than I mustered earlier:  Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a glass tumbler.  a: Black with an inch thick tan head which receded to even surface foam and extensive lacing.  s: Dark bitter chocolate and coffee.  t: Dark chocolate and black coffee, which is to say a strong imperial stout flavor. Considerable lingering bitterness on the sides of the tongue. High ABV well covered.  m: Medium to heavy.  o: A quintessential imperial stout. Eminently sippable. Raising my previous newt 3.95 ratings for appearance from 4-4.25, smell from 3.75-4, taste from 4-4.25 and overall from 4-4.25.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Bottled on 10/22/2012 - poured from a 12 oz bottle into a stout glass.  Appearance - 4.75 - Pours like motor oil. Pitch black beer with two fingers of brown head that dissipates down to one finger, with nice lacing on the glass. Bottle is simple, like Bells usually is.  Smell - 4.5 - Really milky chocolate and roasted notes on this one. Creamy. Dark Fruits. Little bit of hop smell in the background.  Taste - 4.75 - Super creamy chocolate and roasted malts come through. Some espresso like flavors too. Dark fruits are definitely present. Bitterness coming both from the roasted malts and the hops in the background.  Mouthfeel - 4.75 - Thick, like a chocolate milkshake, it's creamy as hell. Alcohol is well hidden. Aftertaste is roasty and creamy, and when you breath you continue to get a nice blast of espresso like flavor. Awesome.  Overall - 4.75 - Great beer, I would say this is one of the best imperial stouts that I've had. It's creamy, full bodied and well rounded.

Oh my this smells amazing, dark chocolate, coffee, mocha, espresso, dark fruits, a slight smokey smell.  Mouth feel is thick and creamy and coats the mouth in a very good way, smooth and almost velvet like.  Taste is out of this world, starts with bitter coffee, dark chocolate, mocha, licorice, dark fruits, has almost a smoked meat/smoked wood taste in the middle and ends with a fair amount of hop bitterness to even it all out.

287,1444,LambicPentameter,4.14,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle marked clearly with ""PKGD 10/22/12"" on the label. Poured into a large 22 oz snifter.  Appearance - Like black ink out of the bottle, an aggressive pour yields a frothy one finger cocoa head that dissipates pretty quickly, leaving sparse and silky lacing and a smattering of bubbles across the top of the liquid. A gentle swirl reveals a great deal of carbonation simmering below the surface. Body is jet black with only the faintest hint of chestnut when a light is held directly behind the bottle.  Smell - Upfront involves heavy notes of charred wood, cocoa nibs, molasses and burnt sugar. Subsequent inhalations reveal some subtle smokey elements and overcooked gingerbread. Very unique and promising.  Taste - I'm not quite as big a fan of the taste, although it is a very good example of the style. The baked goods sweet overtones of the smell have faded back for espresso bitterness and a smattering of dark fruits, like plum or raisin. Some astringent alcohol, with a warmth in the chest after swallowing I wish the taste were as well entwined as the aroma, but a solid effort nonetheless. I imagine it would be even better with some more age on it to mellow out the bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Viscous and creamy, with lingering mouth coating and heavy carbonation for some kick to the heavy bodied brew.  Overall, a great take on RIS, although there are examples of the style that I would likely drink before this one. I would hazard a guess that six months old is close to the bare minimum age you want to crack a bottle with, based on how it tastes at eight months.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Lesser rich chocolatey and burnt molasses type flavors. Finish is sweet and transitions into a roasty bitterness.

287,1444,TheBrewo,3.99,"We crack a bottle of their 2012 stock, pouring a brew of the deepest brown-ebony coloring. It puts up a two finger head of oily, golden brown colored bubbles, showing nice retention. Uniform spots of lacing adorn the glass, and a tight aggregate remains atop the liquid for most of the rest of the tasting. No haze is noted, but variably thick chunks of lacing are seen floating about. Carbonation appears to be surprisingly active, with the bubbles rising rather quickly in the syrupy muck of it all. The aroma is dark and brooding, with darkly roasted sweet grain of chocolate, brown, coffee, oat, and cereal varietals, with accompaniment from boozy warmth, buttered cornbread, soy sauce salts, cinnamon, Tootsie roll sugars, baby powder cleanliness, light plastics, vanilla extract, almond milk, and coconut flesh. Our first impression is that the flavoring is much fruitier than the nose would suggest, with nice sweetness to contrast against the hotness of the booze, and the bottomless of the grain. As we sip, the taste opens with syrupy brown sugars, clean powdered oat, fusel booziness, milk chocolates, raisin and fig sugars, plum flesh, warmed pear, chocolate malts, and what appears to be a plastic, soapy-like hop character. Moving to the peak is a mash of buttered pie crust, dark toffees, black pepper spiced booze, powdered cinnamon dryness, white sugar, vanilla extract, and an intensely calming smoothness of heavy creamer and lactics. The ending wash comes with stark booziness just as it hits, with a rumbled following of cocoa powder, burnt chocolate malts, raw barley and oat, chalk, biting yeast, coin, dark molasses, dark cherry tartness, roasted almond, bittered grainy roast, and soy sauce saltiness. The aftertaste breathes of burnt caramel, faint charred smokiness, black leathers, phenolic plastics, black pepper, fusel alcohol, powdery dryness, chalky graininess of oat and cereal, muddy earthiness, and further bittering dark cocoa nibs. The body is as full as can be, while carbonation is light to medium, but with distinct prickle to the center of the tongue. Each sip gives nice slurp and smack, with pleasant cream and froth. Finishing pop is excellent, with syrupy licks to the lips, and a boozy pucker to pull it down to the center of your palate. The mouth is initially oiled and slick, dripping into ethanolic coolness and mild, gritty astringency. The abv is appropriate, and the beer is a definite sipper.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its nice look on the pour, and its rich flavoring. The latter explodes from that first sip, with surprising sweetness and fruitiness after that dry, heavy aroma. The flavors run deep, cutting grooves with raw cocoa, bittered roast, gritty grain, soft smokes, and intense booziness. These remain robust throughout, with little melding by the end of the tasting. Rather, they keep at odds with each other, acting to provoke the strength of the next through competition and contrast. That said, the final picture is cohesive enough to appreciate, and you are left kind of wondering what just had its way with you. Tasty, weighty stout, really left only to those who can handle a big Russian bad boy such as this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rmcnealy,3.7,"Bottled 10/2/2012  Poured a non-translucent, dark brown that didn't appear to have much, if any sediment. The mocha tinted dirty ivory head faded quickly to leave a small but evident ring around the glass. It was a bit colder than ideal when initially poured so it's been sitting for a few. The first smells had a bit of aged funk but as it warms those scents have become less straightforward. Dark java roast, dark chocolate, sweet caramel, and slight funk can best describe the aromas. There is a slight bitterness and the 10.5% abv is masked pretty well. It is very thin and nowhere near the typical syrupyness you come to expect in higher ABV stouts. The tastes fade quickly and leave something to be desired. Overall it's not a bad stout. The consensus seems to be that Expedition stouts get better with time. Perhaps in another 9 months I'll give another go and update. Not my favorite Bell's brew or RIS, but very enjoyable nonetheless.

287,1444,falloutsnow,3.93,"From: Hyvee, Council Bluffs, IA Date: Bottled 2012-10-02 Glass: Standard US Pint glass  Bell's Expedition Stout is an excellent version of the style, filled with robust flavors of charred bread, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee. One I would definitely get again, though other strong stouts (Plead the 5th, Blackout Stout, Founders RIS) are more competitive in price and overall experience.  Pours a 1.5cm tall head of dark tan to light brown-colored foam, made up of small bubbles with a fairly dense appearance, with average retention time of one minute. The head fades to a thick ring around the perimeter of the glass and a thin layer of wispy lace atop the body of the beer that remains for the duration of the drinking session. Lacing is modest, but present, smallish dots and blotches cling to scattered portions of the glass. Beer's body is dark brown to black, opaque, with light changing nothing. Carbonation is not visible in this beer's void of a body.  Aroma is good, but not as potent as I was expecting or desiring: it's almost subsumed by its own weight. Scents primarily of dark chocolate powder, burnt toast, minor roasted coffee beans, and ethanol.  Flavor of heavily burnt toast, charred sweetness as from a very dark chocolate bar, dark roast coffee beans, flourishes of alcohol-soaked vanilla, and ethanol itself. Front palate finds charred, chocolate-like bread with some residual sweetness, and dark roast coffee beans. Mid-palate of burnt toast with residual sweetness, very dark chocolate, dark roast coffee beans, vanilla, and spicy ethanol. Back of palate notes burnt toast with rich, heavy sweetness, dark chocolate and roast coffee beans, and ethanol. Aftertaste of spicy ethanol with charred toast and cacao nibs.  Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, carbonation of a medium-low intensity, yielding a minimally foamy, primarily chewy stout. Ethanol is definitely present, particularly in the nostrils and back of throat, though tingling can be felt on the palate, too.

T: Pretty complex flavor full of toasted and roasted chocolate malts with a bit of burned cocoa and over brewed coffee.

Very good indeed, but it lacks the complexity often found in the style.  Taste: now that's more like it; we start off with a rich and bitter roasty character. Some dark fruit flavors are beginning to develop at 9 months: raisin and date especially. Some lighter fruity character from the alcohol is also present, which adds a nice depth. It finishes off with a mild bitterness and a little bit of vegetal hop flavor, but this doesn't detract too much. A nicely complex and very tasty RIS.  Mouthfeel: all the body in the world, this thing is like black oil. Not a huge level of carbonation, necessarily, but the massive body has a wonderful smoothness that I love.  Overall: this is a very delicious beer. Since this was my first Expedition, I couldn't wait to age it any longer; I just had to dive in.

287,1444,Darkmagus82,4.25,"Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – Served a nearly pitch black color with a one finger tan colored head. The head fades rather fast leaving only a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma was dark and roasty with lots of roasted malt, chocolate malt and coffee aromas. The chocolate is a mix of both bitter cocoa and sweet milk chocolate with aromas of vanilla and caramel adding to the milk chocolate sweet smell. Mixed with these aromas is a little bit of smoke and hop as well as some lighter notes of darker fruits giving a rather roasted and sweet aroma overall.  Taste – The taste begins with a nice roasted malt flavor with lots of chocolate and coffee upfront. The chocolate starts out a little more on the roasted/cocoa side but gains a sweetness as vanilla, milk and caramel come to the tongue. While a more milk chocolate flavor develops more toward the middle it is balanced by an increase in the coffee bitterness of the brew. Toward the end the sweeter flavors fade more while the coffee remains the same. With a lighter earthy and herbal hop flavor coming to the tongue at the end, along with a light alcohol flavor that comes to the tongue at the end, a nice roasted and moderately sweet and bitter (of coffee and hop) flavor is left to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker and quite creamy side with a carbonation level that was rather average. The feel of this one was quite nice and very appropriate and fitting for the roasted flavors and big feel of the brew.  Overall - A very delicious imperial with a good blend of roasted malt flavors, sweetness, a tad of booziness, and a nice bitter hop and coffee flavor mixed within.

287,1444,RyanLigeia,4.67,"2012 Vintage poured into a Trophy Brewing tulip.  Appearance: Pitch black, completely opaque even when held to a light. Tan head that didn't disappear quite as quickly as I expected it to at 10.5%, but when it did it left behind some excellent lacing and a solid thin layer of foam behind.  Smell: Very pungent, which I was hoping for. Both sweet and roasty at the same time. Right up front I get a sweet caramel/ milk chocolate maltiness with some deep roasted expresso notes as well. Hints of dark fruits underneath (very slight.. raison/fig) with a touch of wood. Also, Idk how it works so well with the other scents (but it does) I am definitely getting some hops in the nose as well. Not so much a stinging citrus scent but more of a smooth, juicy, mango sort of hop presence underneath it all. Definitely complex but not in a bad way what-so-ever.  Taste: Bitter roastiness definitely takes the stage right up front (dark bitter chocolate/expresso). Alcohol is prevalent but melds decently with the sweetness that comes through midway (sllight vanilla/caramel flavors). Way underneath Im still getting some of those dark fruits but not nearly as much as in the nose. The hops break through a bit in the finish as well.  Mouthfeel: Super thick and rich with a nice warming sensation on the way down. Cant believe the alcohol doesnt bight harder at 10.5%. The mouthfeel fits the flavor profile perfectly and is exactly what I hope for every time I drink this style.  Overall: This is an excellent, EXCELLENT beer. Would definitely recommend picking one up if you have the chance and have never tried it. Actually not just one... but a few. As much as I enjoyed this with 8 1/2 months on it I think any little qualm I may have had with it would be worked out with a bit more aging.

287,1444,StonedTrippin,4.11,"this is a colossal beer, and one that comes with quite a bit of hype. for me, it was a shade under the quality of the most elite Russian imperials, but its a damn good beer nevertheless. it pours a really dark brown color, coffee in color really, with a robust milky cream head and an aroma of black barley and more hops than expected, this is bitter for sure. some hot alcohol greets my lips, followed by raw cocoa, toasted nuts of some kind, maybe macadamias, something oily, and then the bitter super dark, almost burnt barley. its quite the journey, but the whole thing really is overshadowed a little bit by the alcoholic intensity. some age may indeed do this good, as mine is less than a year old. fortunately I have some more bottles for this. which reminds me, thanks again to thebrewo for making yet another great beer possible for me in Colorado. obviously full body, but not as thick or viscous as some, decent carbonation for what it is, and a very warming alcohol finish on top of all the bitter. this is an impressive beer, but one that age will service well I think. bells can really do no wrong for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

More assertive roast than recent stouts I've had.  Strong bitterness for a stout. Definitely within acceptable range, but the IBU's and roast level work well together to add a strong edge to the sweetness present in a beer of this size.  Mouthfeel is pretty full but the bitterness cuts that a little earlier than other interpretations.  Overall a very tasty beer and I'm glad I had one relatively fresh. I'll try again in a year to see how some of the roast and bitterness has mellowed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,GoldHorde,4.38,"Bell's Imperial Russian Stout: Expedition Stout  Another excellent stout! Mouth feel is correct - just a bit on the thinner side of cream (hinting towards a Porter style) but that just adds to the deep flavor gamut's mystery. A gargle of it just makes you want to get a V8 of huskies together for a 3,000 kilometer mush! The flavor is complex; coffee first, chocolate, smoke & caramel with a very faint echo of bourbon.  A = pours opaque black with a mocha tan head with open lacing S = feigns at Porter style with a wet smoke (rain on burned wood after a fire) T = again, feigns at Porter style but delivers the deeper, more complex character of the Stout M = thinner than cream, but within Russian Stout style. O = A great beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TheSixthRing,3.75,"Bottled on date of 10/22/12  Appearance - Pours midnight black with a dark mocha colored finger width head. Good retention, resulting in a layer of thin microbubbles across the surface. Lacing is solid to spotty, with good stick.  Smell - Strong cocoa aroma and an anise undertone. Mild earthiness. A faint soapy aroma.  Taste - Follows the nose. Chocolate layers and a mild coffee roast, resulting in a strong mocha flavor upfront. Fair anise in undertone. Earth and leafy character that, to me, comes across as acrid and a touch soapy near the finish.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, but with a light and lively carbonation, giving this beer a more feathery feel than what actually is. Smooth, easy finish.  Overall - Reminds me a bit of the Victory Storm King... a beer I found too soapy on the back end to find enjoyable. While not nearly as soapy, the Expedition Stout does have a touch of that character that I can't look past. This is a good beer, but there are plenty of imperial stouts I'd rather have. It's certainly nothing I'll go out of my way for again. To each their own! Maybe this would be better with a year or two of aging on it, but I'll probably never know.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Amazing.  mouthfeel: full bodied and well balanced  overall: One of my favorite stouts, or beers of all time for that matter.

S - the aroma is deep and complex. Silky notes of chocolate syrup, mocha, and cocoa nibs. Decent amount of roast quality coming through in the form of city roast coffee and hints of charcoal. All wrapped around a piney and woody hop profile.  T - notes of bakers chocolate and mocha on the front palate. Notes of toasty grains and espresso beans. The leafy bitterness of hops come through in the middle as well as notes of sticky pine needles and suggestions of oaky wood which linger long after the finish.  M - super silky texture. Full bodied.

A: Sweet roasted coffee and chocolate notes, dark cherry, caramely dark fruits, graham cracker. Some boozy alcohol notes detectable as well as some very astringent, resinous hops.  T/M: Big coffee bitterness up front, sweet caramel and dark fruit works in with some chocolate notes and graham cracker malt. A big battle between the dry roasted malts and sweet caramel malts in the finish. Very warming, creamy finish.

Foam clings tenaciously to the sides of the glass even down to the last sip.  s: A little subtle at first, but once the foam subsides a nice blend of roasted malt, dark bread, and chocolate.  t: First sip the hopps popped out. Then it settled into some sweat flavors, dark chocolate, dark fruit, with some hopp bitters in the end. Flavor lingers long after the sip is complete. You can tell there's alcohol, but more in the warming sensation than in the flavor. To me that shows a well balanced brew.  m: Creamy, full bodied, just a little effervescence, coats the whole mouth well and lingers. Could use a little more carbonation, but I think it's style right.  o: One of the best Imperial Stouts I have had. Very strong, over 10%, you can feel it but it is not at the top of the taste profile. Hoppy but well balanced, not hoppy to the point of loosing the beer flavor.

Pours pitch black, viscous, and with a thick light-brown head that has incredible retention (especially w/ the age), and leaves generous lacing.  S- Surprising start to the nose as it is reminiscent of a bourbon barrel aged stout with lots of booze and a bit of vanilla. Dark bitter chocolate, Belgian candi-sugar, molasses, brown sugar, and dark alcohol soaked fruits are also perceived.  T- There are huge chocolate flavors right off the bat, both dark/bitter and sweet/milk. There is a healthy dose of roasted malt/coffee in the mix, particularly in the finish. There is also a distinct vinous flavor in the finish.  M- The mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and creamy with nearly no perceivable carbonation. It is less boozy than expected from the nose, which is a positive.  O- I have not had this fresh, but this is drinking fantastic with ~3.5 years on it!

T- Roasted malt, rich milk chocolate, fresh coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate on the finish that lingers and leaves an excellent roasty aftertaste.  M- Rich and creamy, thick with low carbonation.

Not overpowering, but still a very inviting smell.  Taste- Heavy malts and chocolate consume the mouth. Unexpected and welcome bitterness are noted as well. Slight alcohol tate is noticeable and lingers through the aftertaste. Upon belching the chocolate malts return.  Mouthfeel- Slight carbonation is noticed. Medium to heavy body on the palet. The longer it rests on the tongue the more prevalent the alcohol becomes. No immediate or straightforward flavors.  Overall- Great stout. Easy to drink and enjoy, the alcohol bite reminds you not to enjoy to many. Basic and straightforward with its flavor and not overwhelming.

When I first had this beer I was so sick of stouts I'd rather drink real motor oil than this Castrol impersonator.  BUT! After a multi-month binge on IPAs I burnt myself out. I looked into my fridge to see a few Expedition Stouts left. My brain compartments told me to drink it and I did. And it tasted DAMN good.  I'm really glad I held onto this beer and gave it another shot. It's INSANELY roasty at the beginning, but you're soon greeted by this silky smooth dark fruit flavor that balances the beer out extremely well.

287,1444,LCB_Hostage,3,"Came across this on the beer menu at a restaurant last night and was excited to give it a try. Bell's distribution around us is spotty at best, but I did see a couple Six-packs of this in a bottle shop recently and almost picked one up. The $20 price tag was a bit high for the moment, though so I held off. Now very glad that I did.  Served on tap into a tulip  A: Deep, dark black. Little to no head by the time it arrived at the table. No lacing to speak of.  S: Less than I would have expected. Alcohol was very present as was roasted grains and some sweet fruit. A bit of chocolate lingered, too.  T: Again, not quite what I was anticipating. Almost cloyingly sweet and relatively smooth upfront with some alcohol warming on the way down, but not that much given the 10%+ ABV. I guess I'd say this was very well balanced, because no individual flavor stood out (unless you consider sugary sweetness a flavor). It did leave a trace of rather unpleasant bitterness on the back of the tongue -- not in a hoppy way, but more in a ""something burnt"" way.  M: The only word I could think of as I was drinking this was ""oily."" I expected a syrupy character from a RIS, but this just coated everything and wouldn't come off.  O: I guess I'm just not in Bell's target audience. This is the second highly acclaimed Bell's beer (the other being 2-hearted) that seem seriously over-hyped to me. This wasn't a bad beer by any circumstances, but neither was it something that lived up to its reputation or pricetag. I know that ""balance"" is supposed to be a sign of superior brewing skill, but to me, if NOTHING stands out about a beer, it's balanced to the point of being boring. And I would have to say that for me, Expedition Stout was an $8 glass of Meh. Oh well, different brews for different crews.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Maxwell,4.18,"The beer pours dark and sludgy, like motor oil. A head forms of dark tan, almost chocolate brown, tiny bubbles that are very closely knit together and fade away quick, as might be expected at 10.5% alcohol. The beer’s lacing is nearly nonexistent due to the alcohol, but does live a few thin spots and some slight legs from the alcohol. The beer’s body is too dark to properly gauge. On the nose, this beer is thick with raisiny and plum malts, almost quad-like in intensity. Beneath the raisin sits a healthy cocoa smell that plays beside roasted coffee malts and thick creamy dark chocolate. The smell is boozy sweet, and stings the nostrils just enough to let us know there is thick sweet alcohol in this. On the tongue, the beer tastes thickly of bitter coffee roast with a light sweetness at the back of the tongue. The beer’s flavors begin with chewy thick almost raisiny sweet malts that move swiftly into chocolate and then into thick roasted smoky malts that bring lovely RIS flavors. The sweet malts briefly touch on a cloying level of sweetness, but are swiftly washed away by the bitter roast of the malts. The finish is fat with roasted coffee malts, char, and a slight sweet touch of raisin and dark fruit. The aftertaste is burnt char and light chocolate flavors. The alcohol of this beer, while briefly present with the cloying sweetness, is actually nicely hidden, and helps to mellow the bitter roast of the malts. In the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy in body. The carbonation is light and nearly nonexistent on the tongue, leaving a thick creamy, velvet feel on the tongue. The mouth is left charred dry with saliva on the sides of the tongue from the light but not noticeable acidity. Overall, this is a lovely RIS. Great big flavors that are not overdoing it, and certainly seem ready to mellow into beautiful things with age. The raisiny sweetness is a little off putting at first, but works beautifully to prepare the tongue for the bitter roast of the middle and finish of the flavor. I’m excited to have tried this beer, and excited to see what it does with age. According to Bell’s this is one of the earliest examples of an American RIS, and I believe they did it beautifully. Try this beer for sure, and age it too, my bottle was a little less more than half a year old.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Cocoa, hints of plastic, sorghum, roast malt, figs, and dark berries are fairly subtle in the aroma by the time I get to the fourth in the flight.  Dark cherries and roast malt dominate the initial sip, finishing fairly bitter with coffee grounds and a bit of acridness. Molasses sweetness, dark chocolate, and nutty, toasted malt add complexity at the base. Plums, figs, and soft raisins emerge later, along with booze.  Body is thick, creamy, and smooth, with low carbonation and significant alcohol warmth.  Dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and roast malt are well represented, but drier and more bitter at the finish than I prefer. Think majority of the bitterness is hop derived. Fairly complex.

A stronger sniff unveils booze, licorice, and ashy burnt malt.  Taste - Ridiculous molasses again. Really creamy in the middle with just a little bit of sweetness and then the onslaught begins. Licorice, dark fruits, the darkest chocolate. Burnt pieces of chocolate, really. Ashy and extremely bitter. Booze comes back at the last gasp and bites the throat.

A bit restrained in the aroma compared to the flavor, but again that may be due to my clumsy pour. Ridiculously creamy with a thick, viscous mouthfeel. Heavy, dark roasted malts and chocolate flavors are supported by a serious amount of hop bitterness. The depth of flavor and balance is off the charts. Almost a meal all by itself.

287,1444,PaterMorse,3.42,"Very complex, very cool, very much WANTED to like it; but just registered a ""miss"" for me. At times felt like it was a chore to finish the next pour. And phenomenal as the appearance and aroma are, that's an insurmountable indictment for a beer.  A: Pours a gorgeous engine oil golden-black. Head is a stunner as well (milk-chocolate brown), but disappears way too fast -- leaving very little on the surface unless/until agitated. Nice crimson/brown/black hues remain.  S: Changes rapidly. A little chocolate, coffee on initial pour. Agitate it a bit and it's waffles & syrup. As it settles, earthy, roasty, boozy (but only slightly on the nose).  T: Unfortunately, what's only slight on the nose is a kapow on the taste buds. I felt like I'd chomped down on a cotton swab doused with rubbing alcohol. Taste smooths out over time (kind of)); but the alcohol lingers too long and is too in-your-face.  M: Big body, smooth. And though a diplomatic suggestion is that it ""warms"" as it goes down, a less diplomatic suggestion is that it burns your eyes.  O: Complex for sure; but just a tad over the top on the alcohol confrontation. In my estimation, Dark Horse's Plead the 5th is higher in ABV but an equal in complexity, mouthfeel & appearance and FAR superior in aroma, taste and drinkability.  Repeat? No, no reason. Not terrible by any means; but nothing so unique or good to warrant another round. Other RIS pours are more enjoyable and equally complex.  Ideal Setting To Have One On Hand?

287,1444,whynot44,4.49,"Beautiful black beer with a slight burgundy cast with a nice dark tan head that lingers and laces all the way down.  The aroma is complex - roasted malt, espresso, plums, raisins, hints of chocolate and smoke.  The taste is much like the aroma, a fantastic balance of sweet and bitter. Thick malty flavor, some fruity sweetness with dark roast coffee, some dark chocolate and a touch of burnt toast.  Full bodied, rich and velvety smooth with a dry but still smooth finish. There is a definite alcohol presence but not obtrusive, just warming.  Altogether, an outstanding Imperial Stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,frankiepop,3.96,"Classic Russian Imperial Stout. Black beer and damn dark brownish head. Pretty good head. Smell? Smells like stout. Taste - rich and delicious. To break it down, a Imperial Stout should have a good balance of bitter and sweetness. I get a strong well-roasted malty flavor at first with almost a molasses flavor that is quickly followed with a clean bitter thirst quenching finish. That finish is smooth. This may not be my favorite, but it very well could be yours. Expedition is worth a try.  This beer goes well the the fine soundtracks by the Russian composer Prokofiev's work with film maker Eisenstein like his scores for Battleship Potemkin and Alexander Nevsky.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,erickehoe,4.59,"Bottle Date: 12/27/12. Poured into snifter.  Beautiful looking beer. Pitch black liquid with 1/2 inch tan head. Some sparkles in the head due to the frothiness. Nice lacing. I poured this hard into the glass. It's a work of art.  Great smoky aroma, supported by toasted malts. Some cookie-like sweetness.  Firstly, I've never seen the multi-colored head this beer offers after each sip. If you look closely, various hues of brown are floating throughout the froth after you set the glass down.  The taste is magical. A smooth, subtle malt beginning is followed by peanut butter and chocolate. A dry, earthy hop flavor appears, accompanied by a nice, Belgian-like yeast. No alcohol flavor, just a bit of warming. Aftertaste of dark bitter chocolate.  The mouthfeel is silky and velvety, like melting milk chocolate. A dry, bubbly carbonation emerges, followed by more smoothness and a warm, drying finish.  This is the best Russian Imperial Stout I have had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A little sweet. Alcohol presence is strong. Feels very full and stout.  Taste: Very roasty grain. HUGE malt notes. Coffee is there. The alcohol is very forward and is brought out a little by the sweetness. Very big flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Substantial presence but a little lack of carbonation at first. Spreads nicely across the palate and the carbonation grows. Very enjoyable  Overall: I think this beer is better than the some of it's parts. It's a very big, and bold beer with a huge flavor profile. For being a fresh vintage, i would have liked some more carbonation and a little less sweetness. Overall though, a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Tastes full, robust, roasty and still slightly bitter and warms after the swallow. Roast and slight bitterness lingered after.  Viscosity is thick but on par for its style.  Overall if you can age a beer 5-6 years and have it still taste this robust and roasty you've really got something.

The smell is a somewhat of a let down for me. It smells like alcohol and a little chocolate, rasted malts and maybe burnt coffee.  It taste like a full bodied stout that has chocolate notes to it with a big alcohol presence. Chocolate and malt arte there, but is overwhelmed by alcohol.  The taste is very thick with a reasted malt that dominates with a little chocolate and malt, but the alcohol is present more than not. solid effort.  Drinkability is so-so with a bitter aftertaste that lingers from the hops and a bitter chocolate and alcohol aftertaste that lingers a tad too long.

287,1444,RandomBattle,3.88,"12oz. bottle (not sure as to the vintage), poured into a Bell's tulip. Bam!  Appearance - Oily and inky black RIS body, with almost no head, granted I did pour it very carefully.  Smell - I seem to get a large amount of dark fruits, think plums and dates, along with soy sauce. This beer specifically, I have always gotten soy sauce from, not unappetizing just there. After revisiting I get some nice roasty chocolate odors with some subtle hops.  Taste - Nice bitter dark chocolate flavors, followed by dark fruit flavors. Even though I always smell soy sauce in this one I never taste it. This beer has such a wonderful bittersweetness that is amazing and I feel separates it from other RIS'.  Mouthfeel - Full, mouth-coating, and smooth. This beer is liquid velvet. A treat and a sipper.  Overall - This beer is great and thankfully I can get it online when it's available since Bell's doesn't distribute to NY.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A second sniff yields sweet dates and chocolate covered cherries. The smell ends with moderate boozyness.  T - Sweet dark coffee up front along with dark chocolate covered cherries and dates. Alcohol also makes it's presence known.  M - Creamy body with light carbonation.  O - Overall, this was a great stout. Only complaint is that I wish the sweetness were toned down a bit. It would do wonderfully with some age.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,JCaweinstein,4.18,"Like all imperial stouts this beer is pitch black. The dark tan had head dissipated very quickly to a thin ring around the edge of my snifter. I can some carbonation coming up the edges, not very much but it's there. The aromas that I'm picking up are all coming from the malt base. I get chocolate, roasted malt as it warms I was able to pick up the fruity esters of the yeast and alcohol. Again the flavors are malt related, chocolate, roasted malts and as it warms the alcohol. The roastiness lingers on he palette for a good long while. Full bodied for sure. It's mouth coatingly smooth with malt flavors that run deep. The finish is rather dry and it lingers for awhile. This is a very good malty based imperial stout. This has a nice roastiness and cholateyness about it.

S-Aroma has a ton of roasted malts, a bit of coffee, and some dark fruit in the finish. Maybe a little smoke? T-Very complex, usual suspects like coffee, molasses, and chocolate, but big combination of roasted malts which seem to take on coffee and chocolate notes with each different sip. I know they advertise big hops, but a bit too much hop bitterness on backside for my stout tastes. Very little alcohol from the 10%+ ABV.

Phenomenal nose on this brew. 4.75  Initial sip tastes sweet with a roasty flavor up front that dissipates ever so slowly. Minutes later the palate has a pleasant bitterness. Very well balanced. 4.75  Feels slick on the tongue and very viscous. Old engine oil has nothing on this viscosity.

Do get a molasses presence.  Mouthfeel of smoky malt, creamy pureed dark fruit and a burnt dry hop bitterness. Crisp carbonation.  One of the most complex of stouts. Craftsfully mastered.

Pretty hoppy... not sure how I feel about the citrus, tart, acidic, sour notes. Pretty dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation. Smooth, full body. Decently chewy. Was honestly expecting it to be boozier, this one is pretty drinkable.  Overall: A decent stout. I have another one of these with a year on it, and will put down one of this year's for a little while to see how 1, 2, 3 yrs taste with this. For $3, this tastes pretty good.

Perhaps I just don't care for this style, but I found it way to syrupy. The malt profile doesn't seem to balance out the beer at all, and I found myself making terrible faces every time I took a sip.

It is a typically nearly opaque almost black color with a little head and beautiful lace. The aroma is subtle and roasty. The taste is a bitter hops blast of a stout. The sweetness is balanced by the bitterness. This I consider correct for the style.  The aftertaste is a wonderfully mouth full of bitter. It's the best part.

Taste: Did someone just throw dark, bitter chocolate and molasses on a campfire and put it in my pint glass? (Thought so.)  Not subtle. Too smokey. Too bitter at the end. Massive, bold tastes in all the wrong ways.  I'll admit: I don't get this beer. I'm sure the 2,602 people who have reviewed this as a 94 are right and I'm wrong. I think this is a slightly above average beer, even for a stout. Another example of an ""extreme beer"" that sacrifices subtle and complex characteristics that ease into your palette for an ""in-your-face"" marketing pitch.

287,1444,kevanb,4.26,"12oz bottle dated 1/18/2012 poured into a Bell's Tulip.  The beer pours a lovely jet black color, very opaque, hues of cola brown when struck by the light, a very thin, fizzy, caramel colored head appears but dissipates almost immediately leaving behind no lacing. The aroma is really great, loads of dark fruits, cherry, raisin a touch of plum leads to a nice sweet malt layer with just a touch of burnt coffee that lingers ever so nicely. The flavors are even more complex and rewarding, Cherry and raisin are very pronounced, touches of plum and fig behind them, with a bit of sweet vanilla that leads to some rich dark grain. Roasted coffee and a bit of charred wood comes out towards the finish that is wonderfully bitter with just a nice lingering alcohol heat. The body is rich and full, medium carbonation which is a bit higher than I expected it to be, but not distraction with a nice easy finish with a pleasant warming as it goes down.  Verdict: An exemplary Russian Imperial stout and in my opinion, the benchmark for the style. The flavors have continued to increase in complexity and depth and the alcohol has mellowed substantially, a real treat to savor and enjoy on a cold winter night.

287,1444,Fanhitter,4.5,"Served in a glass, poured from a bottle aged 10yrs+  Looks a thick, sepia-black brew, as to be expected. The head on this was a solid half inch of creamy, thick, brown bubbles. The pour itself was a thick, syrupy event.  Smells faintly of berry, sweet grape and currant. With a blindfold on, I'd say this was a barleywine. As it warms however, the coffee/chocolate nose becomes more prevalent, but a musty sweet smell exists until this is gone.  Tastes like a creamy, single origin dark chocolate with a faintly sweet sip. The aftertaste is far sweeter than the draw, and maltier too. A bitter/burnt cold SO coffee flavor is present as well, finished with a very faint port grape flavor. It's big, and pairs nicely with the birthday cake on the table. Happy birthday DAD!  Mouthfeel is syrupy, but oily rather than sticky. It's easy to drink, but this begs to be savored. Coats the tongue, but not the teeth.  Overall, I remember getting this bottle (and others) for my birthday many years ago and not being into it, as, at 21 I was a die-hard Guinness drinker. Still love the Guinness, but can appreciate bigger flavors and age has done this well. Gives me a serious lesson on aging big beers, especially after the resinated cake of solids on the bottom needed a drop of water to break up.

Sweet whiffs of chocolate malt mix with a malty graham cracker scent. Touches of vanilla and coconut give the impression it's barrel aged.  Nicely thick and viscous the taste is of burnt coffee and burnt malt. There is a sweetness of chocolate but its fleeting. The burnt flavors are strong and smooth but there is a slight tinny alcohol after taste. Very warm going down its a great cold weather ale.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Taste: Starts with big roasted flavor and then gives a big blast of dark coffee and bitter chocolate. Don't taste the 10.5% ABV but leaves a nice warmth in the throat. A hint of earthy hop flavor that adds some bitterness. A bit of an unbalanced brew but I'm sure aging would remedy that (this is a relatively fresh bottle). Not getting much in terms of the usual dark fruits I expect from the style.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with average carbonation (almost too much). Pretty decent drinkability.

287,1444,tectactoe,4.34,"Pours a squid-ink shade of black, letting no light through this one at all, super dark tan head, excellent staying power with thick bouts of lacing left along the edges of the glass. Aroma is full of rich, bittersweet dark chocolate, highly roasted malts and grains, sweet black licorice, and a touch of deep fruit sweetness and ashy hop bitterness. The presence of this beer is very powerful from the aroma alone. Some alcohol detectable, but not too heavily; just enough to provide a nice warming sensation on the tip of the nose.  One sip of this and you know you're in for a treat. Thick, sweet licorice up front, along with sweetness in the form of over-ripe dates and figs. Roasted cocoa beans, bitter espresso and thick coffee, dark chocolate and cocoa beans, bitter, creamy, and milky. An ashy, leafy hop profile asserts itself just in time to balance the extreme sweetness and put everything into perspective. Fading out, the beer leaves a nice combo of sweet and bitter behind on the palate with cocoa, roasted malt, and ashy hops. Alcohol warms and make itself known, but never burns or scares you away - it just adds another element. Super thick, motor oil body with a low-medium amount of carbonation.  This beer is extreme - it's heavy, thick, powerful, and jam packed full of flavor. I believe it's slightly underrated, but I may be biased since it's readily available in my area when in season. Take this one slow, it's a doozy, but it's damn good.  EDIT: 2006 vintage, enjoyed 3/21/2013. Thanks to Chris from bringing this one from this cellar. Bell's wasn't kidding when they said this one would hold up. No head, still silky smooth. Flavors are all there; dark coffee, bitter cocoa, sweet licorice. Mellow booziness with a light oxidation - understandable given the age. Fantastic.

Taste is smokey and a bit bitter. Has a chewy and creamy thickness. Leaves your mouth with a dark chocolate after taste that's pretty enjoyable. The alcohol level is hidden well, if you're looking for a thick solid stout, this is worth trying.

Textbook appearance of I-stout.  Smell - Strong hints of coffee with some detectable undertones of chocolate. Overall very pleasing almost like being in a coffee shop. Again textbook for an I-stout.  Taste - Heavenly to say the least. The beer starts with strong malt sweetness that fills the palate. Then the malt transitions to the more bittersweet taste of roasted malt, which again brings the coffee analogy to mind. The bitter sweetness ends with bitterness equal to that of pale ale. In case you were not keeping track that is 3 tastes in the beer's flavor, each and everyone one of them is not just good but great.  Mouth feel - Satisfyingly thick and warm in the mouth.

Not quite as much as much going on as I would expect. Dark chocolate and coffee faint but big roasted malt. A little smokey.  Massive espresso flavors followed by a little bit of chocolate. A little boozy in the flavor but don't really feel any warming surprising for this ABV.  A little too thin as far as the mouthfeel.

The head is a one finger tan color that gives Ten Fidy a run for its money in terms of darkness. The retention is pretty good, and a thick collar around the glass diameter lingers nicely.  S: I immediately notice a large amount of dark fruits, like raisins, currants, and plums. Beneath that, there's a bit of licorice, anise, coffee, chocolate. and light booze. Very similar to a revved-up version of the Stone IRS - if we can compare it to any other RIS on the market, that is.  T: The flavor seems roastier than the aroma. Roasted malts open the flavor profile with a punch to the face, before a fruity midtaste and alcoholic, vaguely hoppy finish. Even for an imperial stout, the balance is lacking. Really, the palate is just beat down with roast, bittersweet dark fruits, and booze. Not much subtlety here - it's aggressive and even harsh. If there was any beer that was more suitable for drinking after a year in the cellar, this is it.  M: Thick as a brick. I can't think of any other way to describe the bigness of the body. It finishes with a lot of wet slickness and lingering roasted malts. It certainly feels decadent, but again, the big booze detracts instead of complimenting the flavor profile.  O: This one is a bit harsh, frankly. Good news is, aging it will kill that harshness stone dead. Bad news is, I only bought a single bottle. Damnit. Then again, I'm of the school of thought that a beer should be consumed as soon as its purchased, so the middling scores stand.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells like licorice, figs and candy without much of a hop aroma, hops are there, but they don't stand above the rest.  Taste: Rich chocolate, plums, and dark malts. Very long aftertaste with tannins and earthy, musty hops.

287,1444,gshak,4.37,"I've had this a number of times, but decided this time, to chime in and write a review. Poured from a year-old (Jan '12) bottle into a Meukow snifter at refrigerator temperature. I had the desire but not the discipline to let this one sit for long and warm up. Here we go: A - With an aggressive pour, the liquid still went flat into the snifter, only for the bubbles to gradually rise up towards the end, generate a thin mocha-colored head, and fade back into a tiny, persistent, ring. Viscous, and pitch-black; upon swirling leaves noticeable signs of alcohol legs. The mocha-tint lets you know where the beer's been through in your glass. Impressive. S - Chocolatey, very, very chocolatey with hints of molasses. Now, this may not be much to rate the stout on, but there is that almost zen-like statement from this stout (hyperbolic, I know) the subdued appearance, the subdued aromas that portend of awesome things to come. T - Yes, yes, yes. A big hit of dark chocolate and sweet molasses coats the mouth. Transitions into a slightly vinous sensation on the palate most likely the alcohol. I want to keep this in my mouth for as along as I possibly can - ah, the sweet, sweet delight of sipping on this beauty. As it goes down, it dries the palate - possibly a combination of hops and alcohol coming into play. I never felt the alcohol at any time, and the hops are only there to balance out the sweetness of the beer. Even so...this is a malt-lover's dream! M - Thick, viscous, silky, smooth....the ultimate sipper.  As far as non-barrel aged imperial stouts go, this is right up there with the big boys.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Head is overwhelming about three fingers thick. Tan shining brown colored. Excellent lacing. Very sticky. Head persists really well. Low to moderate bubbles. Opaque.  Aroma: Hops enter first. Some burnt up roasted malts and alcohol. A very upfront hoppy smell that thins out slowly with time. Overall a comparatively mild smell.  Taste: Front is hop forward, slightly bitter. Some mild chocolate, caramel and malts. Alcohol is felt really well. Punching. Bitter dry finish.  Mouth feel: Full bodied yet feels good smooth may be due to excessive alcohol. Astringency is huge, mostly due to hops, burnt up malts and alcohol. I like that this brew puts hops and alcohol right upfront, unabashedly. Thickness is huge. Low to moderate carbonation.  Overall: Very exciting offering from Bell's. Better than there Kalamazoo and Cream Stouts. Solid stout. A slow drinking beer as is expected. This one is a palate wrecking brew.

Reddish tan head reduces to a lacing that sits on top of the beer, not just around the edge.  Aroma was fairly one dimensional, though it did evolve as it warmed. Initially, I got almost exclusively booze. Maybe some chocolate. Later, the same ""dark fruit"" smell that I get from Narhwal, only stronger. I think it may be fig. I wish I could place it. Not much complexity.  Again, a bit one dimensional, but still enjoyable. A boozy start, followed by some dark chocolate sweetness, a solid malt backbone that is not very roasty, and finishes with the same fig-like flavor I get in the aroma. Fairly pronounced cherry toward the end, mixed with the booze. Tastes like what I imagine the Jim Beam Red Stag to taste like, but in a good way. Warming alcohol very noticeable.  No complaints with the mouthfeel. Can still feel it in a good way.  This beer had its moments.

287,1444,Neorebel,4.57,"Pours a deep, oil hue, nearly black into my glass, with an off-white frothy head covering the top. It remains there clinging to the side and holding steady at about 1/2 inch. This beer's appearance is on point - exactly what I am looking for, it's as if this is just a very large espresso I have here. The aroma is nothing short of an absolute delight! A complex array of flavors enters my nose, such as raisin, purple grapes, cream, molasses, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a slight woody, earthiness. After a healthy gulp I am pleasantly surprised to find that the aroma was not all hype in the slightest. I initially get some fruit flavors, again the grapes, dark fruit, and also a hint of cranberry, and noticeable hops of the ""grapefruit"" variety. Those first aspects are then overtaken by bitter chocolate, a splash of coffee, and a more musty, yet sharp ""barrel"" finish. The alcohol content is not as striking as you would imagine, although the warming sensation eventually does come when you sit for a second. For the mouthfeel, of course it's relatively heavy, but it's not as velvety and full coating as I would like. Overall though its quite delicious and worth picking up because of the more prevalent fruit and hop flavors within this excellent stout.

M: It feels a little more than medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonated. All of the roasted malts make the finish feel dry.

S - 3.5 - The smell is fairly faint. What's there smells delicious, but it's just distant. Gentle chocolate malt, gentle hint of leather. There's a facet that reminds me a little of certain pumpkin ales, surprisingly. Almost some fruit, almost some liquor.  T - 3.75 - Strong burnt char note right out of the gate. Fairly bitter for that reason. Hint of chocolate in the background. It's hard to imagine any kind of delicate fruit taste surviving in this harsh environment but I swear I get a little something - not sure what kind. Pretty hot booze in the throat. I like that but many might see it as too much. Everybody says to cellar this one anyway so that should take care of that. It gets easier drinking farther down in the glass, but still has a fairly bitter char thing going on, more than I think is reasonable. It's over the top with burnt taste while young like this.

287,1444,fmccormi,4.25,"Straight pour from a 12oz pry-off bottle to a Cigar City snifter; bottling date printed in black ink along with batch information near the bottom of the back label (“11503 PKGD 10/22/12 A”), indicating a packaging date of October 22, 2012. So, currently about six and a half weeks old.  Appearance (4.0): Well, dark. Very dark. With a one-finger head of extraordinarily fine-grained foam that’s almost milk chocolate-hued, this beer has a black body that turns a deep brown at the edges when held to the light. Decent retention and lacing: while relatively sparse, the lacing is evenly distributed and sticks around pretty well, which is good for a malt-forward beer of this size. Sure looks like an imperial stout to me.  Smell (4.0): There’s some nice molasses with a bit of anise underneath, layered over a nice, not overly acrid roasted malt character—just a nicely balanced dark, roasted malt / sweet, dark, rich, unrefined sugar blend. Dark fruits (raisins, prunes) and caramelized sugar, with some rich fruitcake. Also, there are some floral, citrusy hops in the background, which somehow do not clash with the roasted malt body. Lovely smelling beer.  Taste (4.5): Very solid, rich, malty body: some of that sturdy-but-not-syrupy-sweet molasses sweetness blends into some rich grain character (more of that fruitcake action), which gives way to an almost shockingly smooth roast. French roast coffee, rich and very dark chocolate, caramelized sugar and toffee, and almost none of the acrid bitterness you might expect. There’s some floral hop character in here, too, though it’s easy to miss—kind of flashes across the palate early on and then surfaces again, subtly, as a grassy-floral bitterness in the finish. And somehow, despite being an RIS weighing in at 10.5% ABV, there’s very little alcohol heat. It’s there, sure, but it’s built into the body well and just adds another layer, if you ask me. And that is especially remarkable, considering that this is less than two months old.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Fantastic feel. Rich and thick, viscous but smooth (not syrupy), with a rich, evenly-distributed carbonation that coats the entire mouth and foams nicely on the way down. Voluminous, sleek, soft. Just greatness here.  Overall (4.0): Damn. This is an incredibly solid brew. It’s not a mind-blowing Russian Imperial Stout, I suppose, but kind of like Two Hearted it does everything it’s supposed to do and it does it all extremely well. It manages to be SO SMOOTH while pulling off so much flavor, body, and density. And it’s pretty damn fresh, too.

Punchy nose with an enormous malt bill. You don't need to point your nose too close to get that delectable stout essence. 4.5  Heavily-charred with dusty mocha powder, burnt notes, alcohol, blackberry, caramelized sugars, pine from the hops, licorice root, and hefty bitterness.

Carbonation is a staunch-medium. 4.5  Overall - 4.0  2011:  Poured a less uniform black with some browning hue taper along the edges as the liquid filled the glass. Head formed at a similar height as the fresh vintage, but looked a half-shade darker brown. Leaves the glass almost entirely clean, but a firm ring remains. 4.0  Syrupy chocolate nose punctuates a melty-rich malt nose. Sweet coffee-and-cream notes swell in and out around the fudgy dark chocolate and booze. Peatier and sweeter dark malts offer more raisin and prune and dark caramel. Truly, Expedition Stout has decomposed beautifully. 4.5  Chocolate-y and syrupy with milk caramel and loud fermentables. The roast is much softer and the beer is sweeter and less bitter. Less coffee, more decadent. Dark and milk chocolate, CowTails caramel creme, roasted grain, raisin, alcohol, fruit rot, soft pungent cheese, rotted berries, torched sugar, and light minty pine. 4.0  Thick body with a medium-to-light carbonation and warmly-reminding strength.

M-heavy body. medium creamy carbonation with a dry finish  O-this along with the Rasputin, i think, are the quintessential russian imperial stouts. they're full of a good strong dark roasted flavor, and they're not afraid to show some warmth along with bitterness. both are fairly slow drinkers, even for the style. even the 12 oz i wouldn't mind just sharing with a friend. i'd say this one is a bit more even, with a louder touch on the cocoa. definitely worth taking a snab, though there are many other stouts i'd much rather have. its a tough category though, so for the price...this isn't bad.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Zach136,4.25,"Cellared review - will update with fresh batch.  Bottled 7/26/13 - Enjoyed 6/2/15  Appearance: Pitch black, was able to coax a thin layer of deep brown head with a vigorous pour for the last six ounces. (4.25)  Aroma: Rich chocolate and caramel. (4.25)  Flavor: Oddly enough, I don't think this has improved in the least. My last fresh expedition experiences I remember rich chocolate, ready to drink, smooth alcohol. This 2 year old bottle has more sharper, acrid, burnt roast character - with a solvent like alcohol burn. Those familiar velvet chocolate notes peak through the back. (3.5)  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carb, boozy. (3.75)  Overall: Not sure what happened with this bottle.

287,1444,DonDirkA,4.7,"This is my first Expedition in about 2 years and I remember it being one of the best stouts I've had so I'm excited. Pours pitch black with a rich, chocolate head that settles down to a cm or so and leaves a lot of lacing. The nose is so rich its crazy. Dark chocolate, coffee, booze, roast, slight char, a bit more chocolate, some prunes and a hint of raisins. The taste isn't as hot as I was expecting, though it does light a bit of a flame deep down in your gut. Booze, raw cocoa, coffee, prunes, dark fruit, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, roasted malts and maybe some figs in the back. Its full bodied with a thick, chewy mouthfeel. This is exactly what the body and mouth of a stout should be. I am super excited to try one every year for the next 5 years. At least I know I'll have one cellared away for a cold night every winter until 2017.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,coreyfmcdonald,4.38,"12oz bottle into a snifter  A: Pours pitch black with two fingers of the thickest tan head I've ever seen.  S: Roasted malts are most prominent in the aroma, but I get a nice amount of dark fruits just behind them - lots of prunes and raisins. I also get a good amount of malted milk balls and a bit of milk chocolate.  T: Roasted malts pair with a balanced milk and dark chocolate as well as some caramel sweetness. Everything is so well balanced together - the bitterness from the roasted malts and dark chocolate pair very well with the caramel and milk chocolate sweetness. Dark fruits add some complexity in the background.  M: Medium to thick body with very creamy carbonation.  O: So complex, so well balanced. This is a great Russian Imperial Stout.

287,1444,andrewjraab,4.06,"A - BLACK velvet, and syrupy. This is dark as night and has a nice brown head that quickly settles but maintains a small ring throughout.  S - Coffee, caramel, vanilla. Deep multi-faceted smells with this brew. Highly complex and the more it warms the smell even changes a bit. Some faint toasted malts.  T - Again highly complex and robust. This is a heavy beer that is definitely a sipper. This is like setting out on a journey to eat a slice of bacon, but ending up having a whole pig end up on your lap. Semi sweet chocolate notes, caramel, finishes extremely dry and bitter. Something a little off with the finish and has a weird yeast flavor that is just a little off balance.  O - This is solid, but not as much as it was hyped. I'd love to try to cellar one and try it in a few years. This is most definitely worth a try.  Re-Review with just over 14 months of age on it: 3/1/14  A - Still dark as night with the mocha head.  S - Pulling the same smells previously described. The only difference is that more of a deep fruity smell is coming forward.  T - This is more drinkable with a year of age - smooth as hell. Robust flavors remain and I'm not detecting anything off with the finish. Balances really nice.  O - I'm glad I set aside a sixes to age - I think this may be one that only gets better.

287,1444,Jugs_McGhee,2.78,"It's my birthday! Best before date 10/02/17. 10.50% ABV confirmed. 355ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a New Blegium goblet in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given this beer's reputation. Acquired for $7.99 at a local beer store.  Served straight from the refrigerator but allowed to warm considerably over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  As I poured, I noticed it wasn't generating a head, so I really amped up the vigor.  A: Pours a quarter finger beautiful rich tan colour head of decent cream, good thickness, and awful retention - which is fairly excusable given the ABV, but I've seen other beers handle more than this without issue. Colour is a solid black. Not quite jet black, but dark as hell. Nontransparent and opaque, as it should be. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Coffee, chocolate, dark malts, cream, chocolate malt, caramel, roast, a bit of alcohol, and even a hint of toffee. Well balanced but not clearly focused. I'm getting excited for it. A mild strength aroma. Doesn't beat you over the head like many beers in the style.  T: Coffee, roast, intriguing chocolate, espresso, background floral hops, cacao, malty sweetness, hints of smoke, caramel, raisin, and a bit of dark fruit (maybe plum). Malty sweetness increases as it warms. No note seems particularly dominant, which is actually sort of a problem here. Without focus, it becomes messier. That's not to say it's imbalanced; the balance is only slightly off in that the flavours are too sweet. I imagine this would fade with time. I get molasses and licorice when I look for them. The flavour doesn't blow me away like I expected. It's actually somewhat disappointing. I don't get any yeast, but a bit of alcohol on the finish. There's a medicinal chocolate-covered raspberry note buried in the finish as well. It's certainly got body. I get more and more licorice as it warms. I despise licorice. Also, more raisin comes through along with the dark fruit - the best aspect of this beer. It's like the bastard child of a quad and an imperial stout, but far less enjoyable than that sounds.  The booze really warms the stomach - a bit too much.  Mf: Far too sticky for the style. Also chewy like licorice. Too smooth and wet. Outright wrong for the style; it should be coarse, dry and creamy. I'm unimpressed. This needs some work. It does have *some* dryness from the roast, but nowhere near enough. Undercarbonated.  Dr: Drinkable for the high ABV, but underwhelming within the style. I like the experimentation, but there are far better imperial stouts at this price point. I honestly wouldn't get this again unless it was aged or on draught. They need to tone down the sweetness and fix the mouthfeel. It does hide its ABV well in the taste, but not so much in terms of heat. I look forward to trying more Bell's, but this was a huge disappointment.  C+  *** 10/29/19: worried I may have gotten this well-regarded stout wrong the first time around, I decided to pick up a sixer ($15.99 USD in New Orleans, LA, plus tax) 7 years later. Currently #34 in the Top Michigan Beers List and $45 in the Top Russian Imperial Stouts list.  Best before date no longer appears...just ""shelf life unlimited."" Interesting.  ""Russian Imperial Stout."" 10.5% ABV. Packaged less than a month ago.  Gorgeous long-lasting head is khaki-tan in colour...would be better as a gilded shining tan to pick a nit. Body is an opaque black.  Aroma is vapid for an RIS...a hint of chocolate malt/brewers chocolate and scintillae of dark fruit if I really look. Probably the faintest aroma for a 10.5% ABV imperial stout I've ever come across....very shallow and withdrawn.  Taste is hugely disappointing and shockingly mild. A hint of chocolate malt. Withdrawn dark malt sweetness. Creaminess. Finishes a little roasty, but roasted barley/carafa isn't prominent. Lacks any burnt or charred malt notes, which would lend bitterness and complexity. I do get some dark fruit notes suggestive of German cake, but they're faint at best.  Oddly thin despite feeling full-bodied and heavy on the palate. Well-carbonated.  While it hides its ABV decently, this is easily one of the most disappointing beers I've ever tried...worse than I remembered it. North Coast's Old Rasputin costs substantially less than this and is a hell of a lot better (plus it's available year round). I just don't get the reputation this has...not a great or even a good expression of the intended style.

287,1444,Converge,4.85,"355ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip. 2012 Bottle.  A - Pours a viscous black oil with a dense brown head on top; dark as hell. Despite the hard pour, the head remained small. Eventually it settles down to a thin skiff leaving slight bits of sticky lace. Looks like a fine stout, with excellent label design to boot.  S - Roasted malt, anise, cocoa, earthy hops and booze. A coffee presence looms in the background, with lots of roasty qualities upfront. There's a big resinous character here that I love. Definitely a greater focus on more abrasive aromas rather than residual boozy sweetness, which to me is ideal for the style. Smells awesome.  T - Absolutely delicious. Everything a big stout should be. Massive base of roasty malt fills the palate immediately, slowly giving way to subtle notes of anise, cocoa, and earthy wood. Finishes with a mixture resinous hops, boozy sweetness, and an assertive blast of espresso. As it warms slight bits of sweetness begin to poke through. Caramelized sugar, bourbon vanilla, dark fruits, and smoky flavors make their way across the palate. Finishes a touch warm, but I don't mind. This is a profile the matches up against the finest stouts I've tried.  M - Remarkably dense and viscous, incredibly creamy and smooth, with an understated carbonation of fine bubbles that lends itself to preserving the creamy texture of the brew. Sticky on the lips, with a mild alcoholic tinge to the finish. Awesome mouthfeel, that compliments the profile beautifully.  D - Certainly one of the finest beers I've ever tried. The profile is a perfect meld of roasty, hoppy and sweet. Insanely drinkable at nearly 11.00% ABV. Absolutely world class beer overall.

Molasses, dark chocolate, raisin, boozy maple syrup qualities, hot cocoa... evolving with warmth.  Bitter coffee and chocolate, boozy figs or dates, the bitterness fades from sweet earthiness to alcohol, great flavors but a poor finish I think.

Creamy head lasts for ages, forcing me to slurp up some. Lacing is excellent.  S - Sweet chocolate, warm coffee, dark malts and a touch of licorice. Not the boldest, but certainly nice on the nose.  T - Big, bold complexity here! A great portion of dark chocolate intertwines with roasted coffee. Hops are definitely here, contributing a good deal of bitterness. I like the contrast, although I feel I would have preferred more sweetness and a bit more subdued hop profile.  M - Medium plus body with light carbonation. Creamy/chewy mouthfeel.  O - This beer is pretty damn awesome. The ABV is large and has a very, very small presence in the taste of this brew. I had this a few years back and wow did I hate it.

287,1444,bifrost17,4.18,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Bells tulip (October 2012 vintage) 9 months old.  A: Couldn't ask for anything better. I wish I could post a picture in this review of how perfect it looks. Jet black, but not menacing...beautiful...? Awesome mocha colored 2 1/2 finger head with a vigorous pour into the tulip. Head subsides pretty quickly but leaves some awesome lacing behind.  S: So much going on in the nose. Booze, bitter espresso, roasted malts, chocolate, floral hops, and dark fruits are the prevailing scents that I pick up.  T: The taste is a little strange up front. Sourness initially, but after that it's damn near perfection. Dark chocolate notes on the middle of the tongue, and then the beer finishes with an intense espresso like bitterness from the blend of hops and roasted malts. Leaves a lingering flavor of dark chocolate and espresso in my mouth. Amazing.  M: Not too much to say about the mouthfeel, other than it's ideal. Smooth soft creamy silky goodness. Moderate (perfect) carbonation.  O: The first time I ever had this beer was a fresh bottle about 9 months ago. I enjoyed it, but thought it was a little bit of a mess, kind of all over the place, but now, after only 9 months of aging I see the potential that this beer possesses. When Bells states that this beer was designed with aging in mind they weren't kidding. I can only imagine this beer getting better and better with age. What a beautiful beer. I almost wish I lived somewhere in the Midwest so I could load up on this stuff when its in season, but at least my trading buddy in Chicago can send me it during the winter months.

287,1444,ABisonEgo,4.2,"'12 bottled on 10/02  Appearance - Black with ruby red highlights along the edges. 1 and a half finger beige head with lacing along the edges  Aroma - coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits, a bit of hop character, though i cant really pinpoint the exact scent...maybe more of an earthiness  Taste - Very coffee and hop forward...almost astringent at first. Some dark fruit apparent towards the middle of the mouth, and bitterness on the finish. Almost a spicy, earthy finish...but very hoppy. While most imperial stouts rely on the hops for balance, this one is almost overtaken in the finish by the hops present.  Mouthfeel - Very creamy...which is pleasant. The beer finishes with a bitter tingle with a medium to full body. A little lighter than expected, but about ideal.  Overall - Great complexity on this one, however, Im a little turned off on how the hops overtake the beer. Its as if this one was meant to age, which there is nothing wrong with and it even says its worth aging on the bottle. If the hop character faded away a bit and the beer smoothed out, im sure this would be one amazing beer.

TASTE: In the flavor there is more of the roasted flavor, a bit of a yeasty twang, bread, spiked coffee, and definitely some clean and assertive alcohol flavor. Bitterness has died down to a suggestion and works with the alcohol bite. Faint chocolate, coffee, but mostly just roasted flavor with a kick of booze.  FEEL: Full bodied, smooth, medium carbonation. Has a bit of alcohol and burnt flavor lingering into the finish.  OVERALL: A pretty standard Imperial Stout, big in its ways, but certainly enjoyable.

287,1444,hopsolutely,4.2,"Pours a silky, inky near-black with brown highlights at the edge of the glass. Impressive head off the pour dissipates quickly, leaving little lacing, but still a pleasure to behold. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy without being heavy or overly oily.  Fulsome aroma of roasted chocolate malts, oak tannins and smoked peaty whisky. These intertwine and transition directly into the flavour, which lingers for an impressive length of time. Multi-layered and complex, there's a lot going on in this taste portfolio - and I was oblivious to the almost over-the-top 10.5% ABV until the burn at the finish (and reading the label).  I'm no expert, but view this as a stunning example of this particular style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,GR_Rick,3.5,"A: Nice looking, thick, creamy stout with a khaki-ish head.  S: Smelled nice, strong, and complex. Roasty malts with a bit of alcohol and sweetness.  T: Nice initially, with the roast and a bit of sweetness. Ended a little harsh (alcohol or bitter, I couldn't exactly tell) for me.  M: Nice thick mouth feel and minimal carbonation, in line with the style.  O: Decent beer, but not as good as I had expected given the hype. It was a little too big and harsh for my liking (and I normally like big stouts). I've got a bottle sitting in the basement I'm going to age for a year or two and try it again to see if it mellows, as I've heard some age does wonders for this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours very dense pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense brown head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge very dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, biscuit, toast, char, molasses, vanilla, toffee, earth, wood, and light herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with great complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, tobacco, biscuit, earth, pine, citrus, and light herbal hops. Decent amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, molasses, citrus, and herbal on the finish for a while. Fantastic roasted flavor balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very nice creamy, slick, thick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost no warming noticed at all after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a fantastic Russian imperial stout.

The head eventually dissipates to a thin ring around the top. Minimal lacing is left behind.  S: Dark roasted malts and a touch of coffee. A molasses-like sweetness comes through towards the end.  T: Similar to the aroma with typical roasted malts with a touch of coffee and molasses-y sweet notes.  M: Medium to heavy bodied with minimal carbonation and very smooth. It has a syrupy like feel to it with a touch of sweetness lingering on.  O: I was a little disappointed with this one. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it seems kind of one dimensional and a bit bland.

Taste- Rich roasty flavor with chocolate and a bit of bitterness that I perceive as coffee. A decent amount of alcohol but not unpleasant.  Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation, maybe a little too much but it is thick and creamy.  Overall- This was the 2011 version. I bought a 6 and stashed them so this is the first Expedition stout I've had.

Light smell, not very fragrant, bit of soy and pine. Taste is full bodied, stout-like, slightly lactic, sits heavy on the tongue, not too bitter, with notes of echanacia.

287,1444,mwrecording,4.08,"Worked hard to trade for a sixer of this.  A: Poured a bottle into my Duvel tulip, a 'typical' black, stout look. Very little to no head and what would seem to be low, but average carbonation.  S: Whew, my least favorite part of this and while I still don't think its 'bad', its an overly boozy smell and mixed with the roasted malts and bitter expresso smell, it isn't a real 'treat'  T: This is what matters most and it is a hit for me. Sweet, bitter chocolate notes with just a tad of a delicious coffee taste at the end, with a tiny bit of alcohol coming through right before the swallow. very tasty.  M: More carbonation than I would've guessed from looking at the pour but maybe since I poured this around 45-50 degrees the refrigeration helped that out. Chewy and a little thick but not anywhere near as much as some stouts this size.  Overal, this was a treat. The Bro's outdated 2003 score made me a little nervous but thankfully the BA scores have been mostly consistent. I'd understand if the sweetness of this stout ruined it for a few people but I enjoy my RIS's with some sweetness, Plus the coffee and bitterness really balances it out.  This is a 2011 bottle so its still relatively young, I'll explore it again in November(month it was bottled in) and I imagine some of the bite will be gone.  I'd go 4/5 on this, really good stuff.

This beer pours nice thick and black with quite a thin head. Not much of an aroma to speak of, but this seems quite common with stouts. As I said earlier, what a big taste! Very strong and complex, with a medium to strong bitterness. Overall, I LOVE this stout. This has a nice kick with a 10.5% ABV.

Mid palate and somewhat in the finish I get a gritty sensation, maybe it's a roasty grain, it's a texture that's kind of off putting.  Overall this is an awesome beer.

287,1444,JohnnyBarman,4.41,"Single bottle from Knightly Spirits in Orlando. Poured into a Bell's branded nonic class I picked up at Knightly on the cheap.  Simply put, this brew looks amazing. To borrow from the great film""This is Spinal Tap"", how much more black could this beer be? The answer is none. None more black. The pour yielded a full inch of deep mocha foam that would not quit, and left behind a mighty series of lacing rings in its wake. It earned the 5 simply because I can't find any fault here.  Nose is also pretty damned rockin', though not this brew's greatest attribute. Roasted grain, coffee, chocolate and cream - a bit of dark fruit as well. Not as potent as I've run into, but still pretty great.  Man this is one tasty stout - wish I had brought back more. Methinks a summer sojourn to Buffalo or somesuch is in order to get a few extra bottles, because as far as stouts go, this is one of the greats. Rich coffee, caramel, a nice finish of wood and toasted grain, dark fruit and a nice creaminess. Lots to think about, lots to enjoy.  The feel is just superb - silky, creamy, coats the tongue like a champ. Carbonation is mild and compliments the brew nicely.  I was excited to try some Bell's brews, and Knightly had a great selection, but I was underwhelmed/normal whelmed by the previous offerings (Pale Ale, Best Brown, respectively). But this brew really impressed me. There isn't a specific extra detail they added to the brew (anise, barrel-aging, coffee, etc), so it might not be the most unique, but it is superbly crafted and highly enjoyable. Well done to Bell's!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,ThePorterSorter,4.23,"This beer is approximately 2.5 years old at this point (from 10/09) and I'm excited to see how it's held up.  The beer pours a near jet black with a razor thin, oily tan head. There's still some lacing, but generally it's a dense, saturated stout blackness. Very fine, dense bubbles leave a thin head of carbonation that fades in seconds. The beer smells intense with a strong fruitiness, coffee, chocolate & vanilla, and some metallic undertones. There's almost no hint of ethanol. The taste doesn't fail to disappoint with intense stout flavors including bittersweet chocolate, tobacco, and a light fruitiness (mainly consisting of pit fruits such as cherries and plumbs). As the beer warms up to a proper serving temperature the alcohol pipes though the darkness with a vengeance. A buttery, smooth mouthfeel, which is characteristic of a good sipping stout, dominates every sip. This beer is very bold and oily, something I actually didn't expect. The bitter aftertaste brings balance to the syrupy sweet body.  Hard to get beer, and unfortunately I had to trade for it, but it's very tasty for being in a 12oz bottle....Reminds me of an oskar for the price, volume, and general tasting experience...just isn't in a can.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Poured into a snifter, the brew appears black with a brown head that fizzes fast. Just a few bubbles remain atop.  The smell is heavy of roasted grains, raisiny alcohol and a bounty of licorice notes. As it warms up, some smooth semi-sweet chocolate character evolves towards the back but there is a solid inclusion of raisiny alcohol that tingles the nose with almost a solvent touch.  The tastes hits upfront with licorice and roasty bitter chocolate. Some hop inclusion accents a dark fruity alcohol character. More sips reveal more and more solvent alcohol with some raisin, plum and a bit of roast that is earthy and faintly of coffee.  This is quite a bold, warming sipper that really hasn't mellowed with more than a year of aging. It is medium to full bodied with an enjoyably low level of light carbonation. It is a fairly enjoyable brew but I much rather enjoy a stout that focuses more on roast and dryness than big fusel alcohol that is fruity.

Appearance: black bodied beer with a dark brown head almost 2 fingers of head that lingers for a while and falls down to a ring around side of the glass. Lots of lacing on the side of glass.  Smell: heavy roast and lots of malt. smells good!  Taste: same as nose. Lots of big roast notes and moderate bitterness; tastes very similiar to coffee.

This beer still looks good after many years of age! 4.0  Smell: The nose is really subtle at this point. roasty malts and dark fruits. maybe a hint of sherry from oxidation. 4.0  Taste: This beer is now sweeter and less roasty. It still has got decent roasty notes and some smoke, but it got some serious milk chocolate notes. Little bit of raisins, fudge, molasses, and brown sugar. There is a hint of sweet cherries and bitter black licorice in the aftertaste; its aged fantastically. Still got lots of depth and compexity. 4.5  Mouthfeel: full bodied beer with low carbonation. The carbonation is still holding up well and the beer has become quite silky smooth. There is not any sharpness to this beer at all. Really nice and mellow stout after some time on it! Wow. 5.0  Overall: This beer does improves with aged without a doubt! I was skeptical, but now that I have tried some vintage Expedition stout, I think that its the only way that I want to drink it!

This beer just made be a believer of aging big stouts! 4.5  ---  4/21/12  serving: bottle  bottle into snifter.  Vintage 2008(September 16th). Batch number 8728!  Appearance: Black bodied beer with one full finger of dark brown head. Head drops to a moderately thick cap with a few large bubbles. This beer looks very similiar to the 2007 vintage! 4.0  Smell: Huge dark fruits especially raisins. The beer is more smokey than roasty, but it got both going on in the nose. Some sweetness imparted from the malts. Black licorice is in there too. The nose is quite robust at this time! 4.5  Taste: Nice balance of smokey, roasty, and sweet. Dark fruits is the big player right now. Raisins, figs, and plums. A little chocolately sweetness with moderate black licorice notes. The beer finishes with moderate bitterness that overpowers the black licorice. 4.25  Mouthfeel: full bodied beer with low carbonation. The carbonation is still holding up well; the beer is silky smooth and mellow. There is not any heat from the alcohol. 4.75  Overall: Bells must brew Expedition Stout specifically for aging. My opinion after drinking/reviewing 3 seperate vintages of expedition stout... age or forget about this beer for a least 3 years; its really better with age than it is fresh. The beer really comes into its own with lots of time! 4.5",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,TheBeerologist,3.83,"Opened a bottle from batch 10068 - bottled 11/11/2010 and poured into a snifter.  Pours nice and thick, dark brown/black with a thin brown head. Looks like a great RIS.  This smells sweet and malty and strongly of raisins and tastes pretty much the same. Still a little hot after 15 months. The carbonation is nice, present but light, with a sticky sweetness.  Overall, I am underwhelmed at this point. It is a good solid RIS but I really prefer it fresh and cannot wait to get some from from a recent batch to review again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,afrokaze,4.15,"Thanks to hmmm for this one! Love my Stone IRS Snifter for big stouts. Enjoying this along with True Grit.  Deep ruby brown but not quite black with a finger of tan head with decent retention and some lacing.  Layers of deep roast coffee, earthy malt sweetness, dark chocolate, plus a bit of rum/bourbon barrel-ish character that I know isn't really there.  Tons of roasted chocolate malt, earthy grains, toffee, hints of vanilla and toasted marshmallow, plus a noticeable amount of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is nearly perfect, lots of body and appropriately low carbonation. A bit chewy and sticky but not overdone. A nice bit of burn but maybe a bit too much.  Really amazing for a regular release RIS. Reminds me of Ten Fidy in body and ABV (obviously), pleasantly hot but I can imagine it being an A+ beer in a year or two. Wish I could get this on the regs out here on the best coast.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,iabeerbaron,3.18,"Picked this beer up at Dirty Johns in Iowa City, IA. Beer pours a dark black color with a thick dark brown head. Smell is of roasted malts and caramel. Flavor of chocolate, malts, coffee, and carmel. Very intense flavor and very intense beer.

287,1444,will1256,4.52,"Batch number 9554 (January 2010).  Pours jet black with no light whatsoever making its way through the side of the glass. Half finger of tan head quickly dissipates, leaving very little lacing.  Nose is excellent, lots of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and hints of dark fruits/cherry.  Follows the nose - first taste is coffee and sweet chocolate with a hint of vanilla, slight roasty bitterness at the middle and finishes with more coffee, chocolate and a bit of booze-soaked cherry. The cellar has been kind to this one - definitely smoother and more mellow than the fresh stuff, which can be a little hot imho.  Nice full body, low carbonation, exactly right for the style.  Overall a fantastic RIS, one of the best ones out there.

287,1444,BeRanger,4.23,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Founders Snifter.  A: Pours jet black, a rim of mocha colored head. Slight spotting, no real lacing.  S: Smells of Chocolate, Vanilla, subtle cherries, roasted malts and a little bit of alcohol.  T: All the flavors come through wonderfully, no real alcohol taste - the chocolate and vanilla kind of linger on the back-end. It finishes very smooth.  M: Full-bodied with low carbonation.  O: Wonderful stout by Bells - this is a great warm-up to the Bells Black Note I was able to score today.

Lacing is great.  Smell. Coffee and chocolate are dominant. Some roastyness and grassy and earthy hops in the distant background.  Taste. Starts out roasy with some lingering yeasty flavors. An intense sweetness builds with an equally intense chocolate flavor. Some moderate bitterness comes in to dull down the sweetness. Roasted malts join this into a sweet finish.  Mouthfeel. Very thick in body. Carbonation is moderate.  Lots of huge flavors here.

287,1444,jrenihan,4.5,"Bottled Sept 26, 2011.  Beer is jet black and a large cocoa coloured head sits atop. Dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving some lacing.  Smell contains roasted malt (actually some burnt scents), some alcohol, vanilla, coffee. Nice.  Taste is excellent. Lots of roasted malt, nice dark chocolate flavours, burnt caramel, and what tastes exactly like roasted marshmallows. There is an ice cream place near me that makes a roasted marshmallow flavour and this tasts like a much less sweet version of that in some respects. I love that flavour and this beer! Alcohol is present and noticeable, especially at the end, but in just the right amount. Just fantastic.  Full bodied, low carbonation, rather oily.  Overall, a terrific beer. The smell is nice but the taste is just excellent. I look forward to experiencing the apparently excellent aging abilities of this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Greencoat,4.84,"Re-review. I found a six pack of 5 year old Expedition Stout on the shelves of a tiny deli. No regrets.  A - Motor oil pour with a chocolate milk colored head. Slight legs on the glass. Absolutely gorgeous.  S - A world of difference from a fresh bottle. All alcoholic heat is muted, and instead milk chocolate, molasses, and fig dominate. Wonderful sherry notes that are only achievable with age.  T - Holy moly. The taste follows the nose. The tannic, angular bitterness from the fresh bottle is nowhere to be found. Everything has been brought together in a glorious state of absolution. Bravo.  M - Chewier than a wookie. Alcoholic burn is non-existent. Extremely creamy.  O - I don't alway rate beers absurdly high, but when I do - they deserve it. Apparently 5 years of being ignored does this ale great justice.

Get a nice sting from the alcohol with a sweet front and a dark chocolaty finish. Vanill and little coffee are very present. This stout is incredibly hoppy as well.  M-Has a full body and very heavy palate. Carbonation is rather high for this one but its not bad, adds a crisp touch which is nice. Lots of flavors on this one.  O-Really good stout.

287,1444,ms11781,3.99,"Batch 10068, bottled on 11/11/2010. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a solid, jet black. A vigorous pour yields a massive 3 and half finger dark brown head. The head recedes and leaves a nice soap-like tan cap. Nice wispy lacing is left on the glass.  The nose is extremely roasty, burnt almost. There is some burnt coffee and bitter dark chocolate that come through as well. There is a certain earthiness to it as well, not from the hops but from something else. Perhaps it's just the intense roasted notes.  The taste follows along with the nose. It's roasty, extremely burnt, charred even. But it's really pleasant. There is some nice dark, bitter chocolate that comes through before a hit of some dark fruit. The fruit doesn't really show itself enough to put a finger on the type, however. The earthy notes that were in the nose come across here as well, but in the end it seems like maybe the roasted notes are just a bit rough around the edges and it makes it seem that way.  There is a huge mouthfeel here. The carbonation is low and the body is thick. There is a slight warming from some alcohol at the back of the throat.  This is an excellent beer. The roasted and burnt characters are really intense but they sort of walk right up to the line of unpleasantness but don't cross it. And that, in turn, makes it extremely enjoyable for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,secondtooth,4.24,"Pours a sleek black with ruby undertones. Carbonation is slight, with a light crown of tan foam. Lace is slight and almost undetectable.  Nose is deeply earthy, with notes of fruit, candied pears, toffee, and peaty malts. Complex.  Taste is profoundly rich, with heavy burnt dark chocolate malts developing across the palate.

287,1444,NuclearDolphin,4.75,"Poured into a 16oz Pint Glass  Appearance - Pitch Black in color, Stouts don't get any darker than this! Head is a very dark brown with a fluffy 3 finger width with excellent retention  Smell - Cocoa, Roasted Malts, and figs. I may be crazy when I say this but it can smell mashmellows in here too. It also has a very sweet scent to it and comes off as more of a Russian Imperial Stout/Winter Warmer hybrid. This is a pretty awesome smelling beer  Taste - Chocolate, Figs, and Coffee along with a very hefty malt backbone. The overall flavor comes off as being fairly sweet and delicious. The alcohol is very well masked at 10.5% ABV. This tastes absolutely delicious!  Mouthfeel - Very Thick and creamy beer. The carbonation has a slight kick to it which adds a bit more flavor. To summarize, it feels excellent on the tongue and palette; It's really hard to top this in terms of mouthfeel  Overall - Simply put, you need to try this beer if you're able to get your hands on it. Any beer enthusiast should give this beer a try at least once.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,curasowa,3.9,"Appearance: Dark, dark brown/black, very similar to used oil, with a thin, tan cap of foam that slowly fades away.  Aroma: Roasted malt, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. The burnt notes become more assertive as it warms.  Taste: A thick and creamy roasted malt bomb. Very heavy and coating with lots of roasted flavor, with more cocoa and a touch of bitterness showing up on the back end. The finish is lingering with residual roasted malt, but isn't is heavy as I though it would be.  The Rest: Wow, this is one heavy beer. It's has so much body, it right on the border of being excessive. As a result, it hides its 10.5% very well. You only get some warming after a few swallows.

Appearance was still an impressive, deep black with a very dark tan head. Little carbonation or head was left, perhaps partially a function of the age. Smell was rather sweet, with dark chocolate, soy sauce, smoke and tobacco notes. The taste was also sweet. A lot of malt, chocolate and some alcohol warmth. A few hoppy, earthy bitter notes were detectable in the finish, along with a little coffee. Mouthfeel was very thick and oily, lacking in carbonation. I need to try this one again fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,CTAID,3.92,"Pours jet black into snifter with 1 finger tan head. Smells like a malt bomb - lots of coffee, a little chocolate maybe, slight booziness, minimal hops on the nose. Taste is just plain old big - lots and lots of flavors. Creamy burnt caramel smokiness, lots of heat, pretty typical of RIS's. Real sipper. To be honest, there was a bit too much booze for me. I know, it's a strong beer, but I've had many examples of Russian Imperial Stouts that haven't been quite as abrasive. So maybe this is a beer that I'll have to age for a while. Mouthfeel is nice, low to moderate carbonation (closer to low) which is pretty fitting.

287,1444,beagle75,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Opaque black color with less than one finger of diminishing light brown foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass.  S: Very dark, with pure cacao and unctuous qualities prominently displayed. Depth is shown as citrus and other fruit, as well as some syrupy malt and spirit, complement the other aromas.  T: Begins sweet, with dynamic dark citrus hop aromatics and roasted grain. Acidity is fairly lively but still mild due to its abbreviated duration, with plenty of added citrus character to stay interesting on the tongue. Bitterness surges early in the middle, bracing in intensity and bordering on medicinal in quality. A lengthy denouement sees drying flavors taper off gradually, leaving boozy dark chocolate, minerality, and husky malt to linger.  M: Thick viscosity, creamy and soft but also slightly astringent on the palate, with low carbonation.  D/O: This imperial stout combines dark yeast and grain qualities with hops that stand out amongst the more traditional elements. It is an all-around respectable contribution, though heaviness and intensity do wear the palate down after a while.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,angrybabboon,4.45,"Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for hooking me up  Review adapted from notes taken 8/9/11  Appearance: Pours a jet black color, great looking tan head - leaves behind a ton of lacing - looks viscous and intimidating, just as an RIS should  Smell: Rich and burnt - severely burnt, charred malts - roasted malts, but with some lighter malts underneath that impart some sweetness - some dark fruits, some dark coffee, and some dark chocolate - some creaminess, some herbal aromas (hops?)  Taste: Burnt, burnt, burnt - yeah, it fits the style - burnt chocolate malts, char, some smoke - some roasted, dry malts, too - some alcohol - a nice amount of bitterness, from both the burnt malts and the leafy hops - dark fruits - burnt coffee shows up at the back of the mouth, adds a nice touch - fresh, this is good but very wild (taste=4), but I sense that with some aging, it will become liquid magic (taste=5), so I'm putting in a 4.5 for now (may revise later)  Mouthfeel: On the lighter side of heavy - thick, chewy, semi-syrupy, could use some more carbonation, but it doesn't need it  Overall: Such a good example of an IRS  This is quite extreme, yet not at the same time. It's intense, but the flavors that are intense seem like they would mellow over a year or two of aging. This is yet another winner from Bell's.

I have been cellaring a bottle for about a year now.  I used a goblet because I was all out of snifters. The stout was as dark as midnight and about a half a finger of foam. Expedition smells amazing. You get coffee, tobacco, and a little like bourbon.  I enjoyed sipping this fine stout. The texture is perfect and the flavor is extremely well balanced.

287,1444,claspada,3.61,"Bottled: 9/13/2010  Pours a jet black body with a full, frothy dark tan colored head.  Aromas begin with a ton black malts, roasted coffee, dark chocolate syrup, scorched/burnt almonds and molasses. Really roasty and almost smokey which I am not a fan of. As it warms I get a large amount of herbal and floral hops, also not my favorite thing in a stout.  The tastes begin with fairly intense black, roasted malts with flavors of coffee and exceedingly dark chocolate. Some burnt nuts again and extreme dark espresso beans. The hops are bold in their bitterness, and provide a taste of earthiness and herbal flavors. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and acidic char taste.  The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a mild amount of carbonation. Quite a chewy mouthfeel. Warming from the first sip and well into the finish, alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms.  Overall this is a high quality made stout but a bit too hoppy and charred malt forward for my liking. Lovers of dark porters and Russian Imperial Stouts will find this a great pleasure but my tastebuds have eschewed from enjoying these highly roasted and bitter flavors that I enjoyed early on in my craft beer lifetime.

287,1444,haazer,4.33,"A- Brew really looks like motor oil pouring into the pint glass. It appears flat until right at the last 1/6 of the bottle or so produces about 2 fingers of a brown sugar looking head. When I say that, I mean it's so condensed you really can't see bubbles. An imposing RIS.  S- Molasses on the first few whiffs, then heavy amounts of chocolate as I inhale deep. Deep roasted malts, and that signature RIS scent that my nose always picks up as being somewhat smokey and minty. A little bit of toffee for good measure, why not. No booze.  T- Bittersweet chocolate in the initial flavor, leading into a charred malt flavor. This is pretty intense. The aftertaste reminds me if peanut brittle. Theres a bit of a harsh roasted profile, that I'm sure would blow over with some age. Booze is very well masked.  M- Full bodied, rich and chewy in the mouth. Medium level of carbonation. This is how a stout should feel.  O- I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and can see why everyone loves it.

After the head settles, a sandy film remains.  Dark roasted malt, molasses, coffee and dark fruits combine to create a rich aroma. The sweetness is balanced by a woody bitterness.  Heavily roasted and bittersweet aromas explode on the palate. Dark fruit and coffee flavors follow along. A bit of chocolate and sweet malt is followed by a pleasant bitter finish. Perfectly balanced. One of the more bold and flavorful imperial stouts.  Creamy and silky mouthfeel. Viscous beyond belief as it takes on a motor oil like consistency. Low and appropriate carbonation. It's definitely a sipper, but goes down easy.  Expedition Stout embodies the RIS category. It's bold with roasty, sweet and bitter flavors.

In all honesty I have to say that after a year of aging this beer improves exponentially. I am a big fan of stouts, this one really takes the cake.

Aroma: 3.5 Strong notes of molasses and candy sugar. Notes of dark fruit and faint notes of milk chocolate and roasty espresso.  Taste: 4 Initially, semi-bitter dark chocolate/cocoa, dark fruits and coffee with notes of dark fruits. Slight warmth and presence of the alcohol. A moderate dry bitterness soon after that lingers through the whole taste. Finishes with amazing rich roasty flavour with a touch of sweetness, contrasting with a moderate amount of coffee and bitterness from the hops. The flavour changes quite a bit as it warms, improving significantly. As it approaches warmer temp, flavour soften and melt together with more mellowing out of the bitterness/sourness and bring forward more roasty cocoa flavors.

S - Coffee liqueur, raisins, molasses, pretzel rods, dark chocolate  T - Sweetened black coffee, milk & dark chocolate, noticeable hop presence but it adds a nice balance that cuts through all the thick, dark flavors.

287,1444,minterro,4.14,"Not much notes, drank at Crunchys  Very full bodied very sooth and velvety. Jet black colored beer not much head to it, just spots of lacing that fall quick.  Bready and smokey malts in the taste.  Nutty in the aftertaste, alcohol has a great presence.  Big time smokiness. Warming but not too hot at least it was well masked.  4, 4.5, 4, 4.5, 4.5  ---  Bottle tasting 03/12/14  Bought on my trip to Michigan over winter break. Bottling date 07/26/13 so we are looking at about 7.5 months aging. Poured into a snifter.  A&S: initially the aroma is a strong charred smokiness and dark chocolate. The body looks on lighter side when poured. Very minimal latte colored head even when poured viciously. Black, but not pitch black colored beer.  T&M: Upfront I'm mostly getting chocolate. About midway through it starts getting smokey. Very smokey (almost ashtray like, a bit too much) in the finish. I getting a tad bit of nuttiness in the finish like a previously noted. Alcohol isn't hidden but not unpleasantly apparent. More warming than I expected at just above 10%. Body is medium, while carbonation is low.  Overall: Great brew. With my limited beer aging space, I don't think I will be aging this one again until I get some more space, but nevertheless a good beer to age for a bit. Surprisingly a kinda straight foreword brew. A little too smokey for me, but if you are into that taste this beer would be a good one to check out.  3.75, 4.25, 4, 4, 4.25",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,quaybr,4.16,"Served in a tulip glass. Had a huge mocha head that dissipated after several minutes of extreme patience! Color a dark brown, nearing black.  Smelled of roasted and chocolate malts, quiet bitter hops, and alcohol.  Taste is amazing. A ten degree warmup result in a completely different beer. So you should let that happen (50 degree range). Right after the pour, it tasted like a slightly roasted, hoppy, thick ale. As it warms up, however, the coffee and chocolate undertones get louder and louder in a wonderful way. So damn good.  Mouthfeel is thick and relatively smooth, not quite silky. Good level of carbonation.  Visiting Ohio for Christmas. I have spent that past few weeks hoping this beer would be accessible once I got back into the distribution area. Quarter Barrel in Oxford did me one better. This is a great beer.

Wonderfully big stout, it tastes like bitter chocolate, sweet roasted malt, and slight cherry again.  M: good carbonation for a heavy-bodied beer. Definitely not smooth due to the bite of the alcohol when it warms, though.  O: have this before it warms up and you will be happy.

A generous pour yields a killer 2.25 finger cascading mocha head. The retention is top notch, as is the lacing which rims the glass.  S: Dried and candied dark fruits with just a touch of smoke.  T: Really a massive dose of char up front. Yeah, this is aging beautifully. Though it's rather roasty, there's still a solid hop kick on the mid, even after it's been in the cellar for a year. Black coffee runs from the mid to finish, and it lingers for some time.  M: Just over the top. It's silky, creamy and velvety. It feels like a penthouse suite in mouth.  O: Bell's Expedition Stout is easily one of my favorite non-BA RIS's. It's big, bold and brash, yet deceivingly elegant and easy to drink. This has aging potential unlike many others.

Aroma is dark roast coffee, raisins, and a whiff of alcohol. Soft mouthfeel, possibly a bit too soft (on the flat side). Oily rich body. Flavor makes me think of rum-raisin ice cream with a fair amount of sweetness, dried fruit, and a noticeable alcohol presence.

Some carbonation evident with a semi-vigorous pour. Any cap that appeared quickly vanishes leaving, well...not much. This appears oily and quite viscous.  S: Dark chocolate, cocoa, licorice, black pepper and roasted malt.  T: Bitter chocolate and coffee, licorice, and roasted malt. Also a bit of caramel that helps transition you to the finish. Alcohol shows up early but it’s not as much as you might expect. The coffee, chocolate and malt are wonderfully intense! This is a pretty hot one but I like it.  M: Pretty thick...heavy body. Carbonation is on the low end of the spectrum but it’s enough to keep it lively.  O: This is a delicious tummy warmer.

Smell-Initially got a whiff of the alcohol but as it sat for a moment the alcohol smell has become minimal. Get dark chocolate with a slight toffee smell. Hints of vanilla throughout the roasted malt aroma.  Taste-Smooth chocolatey taste at first than a roasted bittering taste to finish. Good aftertaste that is slightly boozy for a split second than cascades back to the roasted chocolatey goodness.  Mouthfeel-Great creamy mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated. What this beer should be.  Overall-This is a very enjoyable beer that does not taste like it contains the abv labeled.

Taste - Starts semi-sweet coffee n cream with some carmel which quickly lends to burnt toffee, dark fruit peels and licorice, drying to a nice roasty finish. Alcohol is well hidden, and adds warmth between sips. Very nice.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full mouthfeel, very substantial, heavy and mouthcoating, carb is somewhat low which gives a fuller mouthfeel but adds a nice crisp nuance to the drying finish.

Good lacing on the way down, but lacing could be better.  Smells of coffee, malts, plums and brown sugar. Could be stronger, but it's nice.  It's a sipper. This sucker is thick, creamy. Way, way thicker than milk. Chewy. A meal here. There's got to be half a days worth of calories per glass.  Bitter burnt malt dominates up front and is the dominant flavor throughout. Mixed with the burnt flavor is some sourness. And combined, the sourness and bitterness leave a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. Secondary flavor is plums and brown sugar. Burnt coffee flavors as well. The high ABV is well hidden in this meal-of-a-beer.  In sum: Looks good, smells good, taste is too dominated by the burnt/bitter/sour flavors for me to recommend fully, despite the fact that there's a lot of interesting things going on here.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Huge roasted malt and bitter coffee. Alcohol heat is big up front but fades away under the crushing bitter flavors of coffee, chocolate and burnt malt. Can get a bit of dark fruit - raisin and cherries I think - up front and in the middle before the ensuing wave takes over.  M: Thick and syrupy with stinging alcohol sensations.

287,1444,climax,4.16,"Had it at the Flying saucer, early December. When the waitress brought the black beast down, and the head was incredible. The fluffiest pillow of dark tan would not sink until I started mucking it up. It notched with every sip, perfect start.  The aroma was as astringent and hoppy as it was sweet. Pure chocolate, coffee, and leafy hop flavors hit the nostrils relatively gently for the style.  Alcoholic phenols are definitely evident in the mouth especially as it warms. It's got commanding bitterness from extremely roasty burnt espresso flavors and intense hop additions. Fleeting dashes of sweet chocolate and caramel lighten things up briefly.  This is among the thickest, chewiest, densest body I have experienced. It's almost like melted marshmallows in the mouth. It finishes brutally dry which makes it easy to keep sipping, emphasis on sipping. Substitute it for a meal.  It's definitely kicks you in the taste buds fresh from the tap.

Taste - Very similar to the smell. A very heavy and malty beer with some coffee taste up front and chocolate coming after. The 10.5% ABV is hidden.  Mouthfeel - Kinda syrupy. The taste is sticking around on my lips and leaves a coating in my mouth. Not a bad thing though.

287,1444,tobelerone,4.47,"This bottle was nearly 14 months old (October 5th, 2010).  What a big, intense, phenomenal stout. I’m kicking myself for not trying this one sooner. A quarter inch of chocolaty brown head sinks quickly down to a thin band, leaving minimal lacing. Visibly thick and viscous, totally black and opaque. The nose is huge, with strong coffee and molasses flavors up front, malty notes, chocolate, and fumy alcohol underneath.  The flavor is on the sweeter side, without much in the way of hops, so the bitterness comes mostly from the roasted malt and dark chocolate taste. Very creamy and thick, full of coffee, molasses, dark fruits, vanilla, booze. Not overwhelmingly alcoholic, fortunately. Coating mouthfeel with low carbonation, sticky and lingering aftertaste.  I split the 12 oz. bottle with the missus and some fudge brownies and that was enough; I suspect it would be pretty tough to finish the whole bottle, particularly if you’d already had a few others (as I had).

Started very uncarbonated, but eventually exploded with a thick gigantic head.  Smells of roasted malts, but not too strong. hints of bitter baking chocolate and coffee are side by side with creamy smoothness.  The first thing I notice is an overwhelming bitterness. It feels just as bitter as a breakfast stout. A decent hop presence really just multiplies the bitterness from the roasted malts and other bitter flavors. As it warms, it gets even more bitter.

T- The malts and hops combine forces to create a heavy bitterness that works with the high ABV to pack a good punch. Not overly complex, just a big stout flavor that doesn't let up. Kinda boozy but drinkable.  M- Creamy and sharp with an alcohol burn that's easily noticed.  O- Yeah, it'll get ya buzzed, but at what cost?

All of those smells blend nicely together, without any dominate overtones.  T: It starts off a little sweet with a hit of raisin. The flavors quickly change so that the roasted malts begin to shine through. That familiar burnt toast taste peaks, and then blends into a smooth and creamy milk chocolate. It finishes smooth, but a bit boozy.  M: Starts off dry, but finishes smooth. The thickness of this beer coats the palate, and the flavors linger for a bit after it drinks. It's sticky and chewy and the alcohol finish makes it bitter to the end.  O: I think this beer is just alright. Having it fresh, I feel that it is a bit hot.

Pours a finger and a half of mocha-colored head that sticks around a while. 4/5  Smell: Rich, malty milk chocolate, some roasted coffee tones and a faint booziness aroma. The milk chocolate aroma is absolutely divine. 4.5/5  Taste: Smooth roasted chocolate, brown sugar and lots of hops Some dark fruit too. Finishes with a light note of bitter coffee in addition to the above mentioned flavors. 4/5  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, viscous beer with minimal carbonation. The finish is savory. 4/5  Overall: A very affordable, solid Russian Imperial Stout that is widely available and easy to find when in season. The aroma of the beer is absolutely wonderful, though the flavor lacks some of the creamy milk chocolate characters that were present in the aroma and is a bit hop-heavy out of the gate. The flavor of the beer is nothing innovative, and very ""average"" and straight-forward for the style, but pretty delicious nonetheless. Another reliable beer from Bells that is quite drinkable.  Recommendation: A very good starter Russian Imperial Stout for casual beer drinkers. Beer geeks are implored to try this one as well.  Pairings: Steak.  Cost: $15.99 for a six pack.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Good retention, nice thick legs, nice dark tan lacing.  Smells rich and chocolatey, dry roasty malts with espresso-like notes and a touch of anise. The taste is sweet up front with chocolate and caramel malts, roasty espresso in the middle, and dry slightly boozy finish.  Feel is thick and full, nice and creamy.

287,1444,ChugginOil,4.05,"Expedition  Pours solid black, allowing zero light through. An inch of orange tinted head sits with surprisingly good retention, leaving thick lace as it decends.  The nose is heated. A boozy scent encompasses scents of chocolate, dark fruits and toffee .  The taste is quite beastly as the nose suggests. A roasted wave of cocoa, dark fruits,, and some citrus fruit hoppiness. Nice combo but again, heavy on the booze scent.  The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy allowing the flavors to stick across my palate ten fold.  Overall, I can understand why this is such a high ranked ""cellerable"" brew because of the complexity and boozy presence but at the same time, its damn good fresh.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,33nickadams,4.2,"This is my 50th review, and I have decided to review one of my all-time favorites. This one was bottled on September 13, 2010.  None-more black black with about a tan finger that dissolves rather quickly. Smell has a touch of alcohol, molasses and black licorice. For being over a year old, it is still has a very bold taste. Coffee, chocolate and molasses still are noticeable. This could age much longer and still have some very distinguished notes. Heavy mouthfeel, creamy as well. For being over a year old, I would have liked some of the flavors to be more subdued. I will review the same batch a year from now. Still, its one of my favorites.

287,1444,Huhzubendah,4.08,"32 oz. swing top growler.  Fabulous appearance. Deep, jet black with a thick, beige head that leaves a generous amount of lacing cascading down the sides of the snifter. Grandiose aroma of molasses, malt, charred roast, dark fruits. Dark fruits really emerge as the beer warms. Lots of charred, roasted malt as well. Full bodied, though not viscous or syrupy.

S: Rich mocha with an emphasis on the coffee. Roasted malts and chocolate compliment the coffee well. Could enjoy this aroma all night!  T: Chocolate, espresso, molasses, and roasted malts blend together magnificently. Sweetness in the middle, but finishes with bitter coffee and some boozy warmth. Rich & decadent overall; would pair perfectly with a chocolate cake a la mode.  M/D: Creamy and smooth texture makes this brew quite drinkable.

287,1444,Smakawhat,4.23,"Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass. Nice to see how this out of the bottle for a change. Packaged September 26th 2011 off we go.  Out of the bottle this pours supper dark and motor oil thick with an incredibly dark DARK brown chocolate head, creamy tiny bubbles and big lacing edges around the glass. Body color is a classic walnut black/brown.  Nose is very fruity, banana, barleywine sense, and mild malts. Interesting very creamy smelling, not so much roasty or malty, quite nice though.  Taste is a great mix of milk chocolate, and very hop bitter finish. Slightly prickly but mostly velvety chocolate texture in the mid palate, and finishing with a very noticeable grapefruit hop bitter. Hop character seems to take over the remaining drink, but still give a basic impression of a dark malty stout.  Overall pretty tasty, but was quite surprised by this hop bitter presence.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,nandemo1,4.12,"Poured a pitch black with a thin tan head, and that required some aggressive pouring. Leaves a lot of tan lacing.  Smell is sweet raisin and chocolate. Taste is similar but includes coffee and molassas. Definitely some bitterness in there, balancing the sweetness, at first but then it lingers long afterwards. I'm not getting any alcohol, but this bottle is 11 months old.  Feel is pretty smooth, but sticky. Full bodied.  This is a good beer, but not an everyday go-to for me. It's bitter aftertaste is just a little abrasive for the style, I think.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Fux,4.14,"A: Opaque black. Even the (very small) foam is dark, very dark brown. The head leaves a thin layer that persists for a good while.  S: Quite surprised by the hoppy character of this beer ! Behind that: chocolate malts, roasted cocoa, caramel malts, liquorice, dark fruits (raisins, dark grapes), relatively faint coffee smell and strong alcohol.  T: Coffee, molasses, nuts and roasted chocolate. Finishes with a nice bitterness which counterbalances the overall sweetness.  M: Thick, creamy, almost sticky. Low carbonation.

S- Huge roasted malts and chocolate dominate. The alcohols is present, but while still cool is rather pleasant, adding a little kick to this malt bomb. Smell is very smooth.  T- The first thing that stands out is the bitterness is much greater than the nose would suggest. Tons of dark malt, chocolate, with a biting bitterness. A lovely finish that seems to go from bitter to sweet and back again.  M- An absolute mouth coater. This guy sticks around long after gone in the form of a sweet chocolate mouth coating.  O- A fantastic, albeit it huge, RIS. If you're up for a giant stout, Expedition fits the bill.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Pintofbrown,4.45,"Appearance- On-tap at the Sanctuary. The opaque dark brown body of the RIS family is here. There is at least two fingers of milk chocolate head. Yeah, it looks nice.  Smell- There is a really nice candied cherry and raisin sweetness on the nose. It also has that caramel malt hint that I'm sure will come off as ""roasted"" when I take a sip. This also brings to mind just general dark fruit sweetness. I'm not sure how the boozy aspect of this nose will come off in the drink, but it is appropriate for the style.  Taste- Great boozy bourbon Batman! Just a silly amount of booze in the drink, even more heat than Old Raspy. Thankfully it doesn't bury the molasses, cherry, raisin, and dark fruit that churns over the tongue. You have to wait until the finish, but boy, the roasted coffee comes on strong in the finish and lingers, along with the heat!  Mouth feel- This could be chewier, and I'm not sure I dig the carbonation or not. I mean, you could call it appropriate, and it certainly doesn't take away from the full body and pretty smooth finish. It's not as dry as such a boozy RIS usually is.  Overall- I dropped an F bomb in my notes to describe how much I thought of the ""awesomeness"" of this stout. So yeah, I guess I really liked it. Just age the crap out of this thing and I have no doubt it could rival the whales at the top of the RIS list. A must try stout, from a must have brewery.  Edit 11/25/2013: Had 2010 vintage bottle. Notes: Nose not nearly as boozy and dark fruits take center stage: fig, some black cherries, brown sugar as well. The palate has much more dark chocolate now that rides forever and ever, long after the swallow, still getting the fig and dark cherry flavors, only much stronger. Again, the booze has backed off considerably. Mouth feel is all liquid velvet, rich. Amazing with three years of age, and honestly, could be laid down for another three years. Wow.

Thick, heavy, low on carbonation, but with a nice bitter sharpness to the taste. Good beer, but for this style Old Rasputin is much better.

Taste: Sweet up front, caramelized brown sugar. The rest of the flavors come late but in full force--roasted malt, burnt toast, and a burnt coffee aftertaste that lingers pleasantly.  Mouthfeel: Thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel, low carbonation, sweet start and a wet finish.  Overall: Hint of alcoholic burn but not much considering abv.

287,1444,genuinedisciple,4.94,"Let me start by saying that Expedition and I have a history, a semi-short, but budding history. Expedition Stout was one of the first stouts I ever had. I liked it then, and absolutely love it now. The other day I happened upon a couple sixers of 2008 expedition, dusty bottles and all. Let me confirm for everyone that this beer gets much better with age.  A - very dark, would like to see a bit more lacing, but I'll get over it, because...  S - The smell is fantastic. At first sniff you get struck by coffee, but then you quickly smell chocolate as well...personally, I think you can smell some type of fruit as well, but it is hidden. I encourage people to take multiple sniffs before and during the consumption...use a snifter.  T - Well, it really depends on if you are drinking an aged or non-aged bottle. The non-aged has more harsh flavors with the coffee and chocolate really standing out. However, you can sense that this is a complex beer, but it's difficult to hit all the flavors. The aged bottles are much more mellow. The coffee flavor is not as potent and you can really taste the other flavors that are present.  O - if you couldn't tell...I give it a 5. I'd probably give the regular expedition an A-, but age it a couple years and it's a solid A+ in my opinion...but you know, ""that's just like my opinion man""",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,StoutHunter,4.1,"I picked up a bottle of Bell's Expedition Stout a couple weeks ago for $2.99 at The Lager Mill. I have tried this beer before once or twice at some beer festivals a couple years ago, so it's time to stop procrastinating, sit down, and give this beer a proper review, so lets see how it goes. Batch #10699 bottled on September 26th 2011. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label on this beer is pretty nice, it's simple yet good looking, classy looking. It poured a nice looking used motor oil black that let no light come through and it had a half a fingers worth of mocha colored head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing.  S- The aroma is pretty roasty and robust. It starts off with loads of highly roasted dark malts that have a medium amount of sweetness to them and impart some black coffee aromas and a little bit of bitter dark chocolate and vanilla. I also picked up medium amount of alcohol and I couldn't smell any hops.  T- The taste starts off with loads of slightly charred roasted malts that impart lots of dark chocolate flavors along with a little bit of vanilla. In the middle I pick up medium amount of molasses like sweetness followed by some dark fruits and a little bit of caramel. There is a really slight bit of coffee in the flavor but it's not nearly as present as it was in the aroma. There is a little bit of warming alcohol on the finish, but it's not nearly as strong as I thought it was going to be, it's hidden well. It has a bitter chocolate aftertaste.  M- Rich, smooth, on the medium side of being full bodied, and it had a low amount of carbonation, I would have liked just a little more carbonation.  Overall I thought this was a really good RIS. This beer was all about the heavily roasted dark malts, just like it should be, and it provided a nice amount of complexity. After smelling this beer I thought it was going to have a half and half mixture of chocolate and coffee flavors but instead it was dominated by the chocolate letting the coffee take a back seat, I liked this and I found it to be a little different then most of the other RIS's I have tried that have a pretty heavy coffee presence in the taste. For being 10.5% I thought the alcohol was hidden pretty well, some people claim that this beer needs two to three years of aging to calm down the booziness, and while I have no doubt this beer gets better with age, it drinks pretty well fresh and I didn't find it close at all to being overly boozy, and that made for some descent drinkability, I don't know if I would grab another bottle but one goes down pretty smooth and without a problem. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it was pretty much what I look for in a good RIS, and the heavy chocolate presence was pretty nice. What I liked least about this beer was the carbonation, I would have liked it bumped up a couple notches. I will for sure be buying this beer again, it's a great local RIS, I haven't had an aged bottle of this beer before but I would definitely like to throw a couple bottles in the cellar to see how this beer develops over the years. If you love RIS's this is a must try. This is a very good RIS, I like it more then Old Rasputin. but it still doesn't knock off Founders Imperial Stout as my favorite RIS. Great job Bell's this is one hell of a beer from one hell of a brewing company, cheers. 2013 Update, I just had this years batch that was bottled in 7/26/13. It's good but it it's a little boozy fresh, I changed the scores accordingly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,CHADMC3,4.2,"The opaque black body lies beneath the mocha colored head that is dense and creamy and while there is not a ton of it, it hangs on for quite a bit before dissolving yet leaving hints of its existence throughout the beer.  Robust roasted coffee malt aroma floats from the glass. There are only hints of sweet milk chocolate and perhaps a touch of vanilla.  The flavor is amazing with slightly charred roasted malt, coffee, touches of anise, and underlying milk chocolate sweetness.  The mouthfeel offers a thick, robust body with generous carbonation and a palate coating finish that leaves the flavors kicking around for a while.  One of my favorite RIS’s for sure.

Smell: Rich bitter dark chocolate and dark fruit. Also hints of coffee.  Taste: Dark chocolate with a lot of boozy dark fruit flavor. Still fairly bitter, even after almost a year.  Mouthfeel: Thick rich body - although not quite as thick as some of the more dessert-like Imperial Stouts.  Overall: A very good stout. I still have a few more saved which I will have to try again in a year. The bitterness is still fairly pronounced and a little mellowing of the flavors would make it much more drinkable.

S: An awesome blend of roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, raisins, licorice, molasses, a touch of dark cherries, hints of earthiness, and some slight vanilla notes. Probably the most well blended beer I've ever smelled.  T: Chocolate and vanilla upfront. Then raisins, molasses, dark cherries, slightly bitter coffee.

Great mouth coating. Alcohol hidden very well.  O: I've heard so much about how good this beer is. Actually have had a bottle for 3-4 months now but hadn't gotten around to drinking it.

My first time that I can remember with Expedition Stout, but WOW. This is an incredibly complex and drinkable imperial stout.  Pours jet black with a gorgeous brown head. I drank this outside in the 45º cold paired with a Tatuaje Black petite lancero, so the nose was somewhat frail.  This is a beautifully thick beer, with a ton of carbonation, which really brings the flavors out. Lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. So very complex, with that inimitable Bell's malt flavor.

287,1444,mocktm,4.2,"Beer #2 at World of Beer in Fort Myers, FL - 9/28/2011  Into a snifter, this appears thick and impenetrably black, used motor oil with a large cap of espresso colored head that quickly fades away with some light lacing.  Nose is dark roasted malts galore: dark chocolate, heavy coffee, and licorice with some earthiness in there as well. Abundance of sweetness with some underlying booze presence.  This is like drinking a spiked coffee chocolate milkshake, but I mean that in a good way. Malty and rich all the way with some woody/herbal undertones, this finishes with a mild alcohol burn in the back of the throat, evidence of its 10.5% ABV.  Monumentally thick and viscous, chewy and complex, this is a mother-load of a stout. Although most would consider this a sipper, its surprisingly smooth and slick, and thus quite easy to drink.  Some stouts get talked up a lot, and thus leave some others behind, but for my money, this is a phenomenal effin' beer that is as good, if not better than most of those aboard the hype train.

The 10.5% is noticable as it sorta wipes the palate around briefly. Finish is roasted with a charcoal/coffee kick. M- The mouthfeel is big and bold. Thick and chewy. Would love it more if the alcohol wasn't so hot. O- I didn't enjoy this much as I expected I would.

287,1444,drumminbrewer,4.35,"Notes from a recent cabin trip - cracked open a 2010 from my cellar.  Served in my Duvel glass. Pours a viscous, rich black body...absolutely no light penetration. Large, frothy, creamy head about 1.5 inches tall that slowly dissipates - large amount of lacing left on brim.  Massive nose. Strong notes of espresso in particular. Licorice, anise, charcoal and a bit of earth.  First sip...lord, this beer ages phenomenally. SO creamy...like a dark chocolate milkshake. Raw sugar, lactose, all the above flavors mentioned in the nose (classic to an RIS), and molasses.  Long, strangely ""woody"" finish for an un-oaked beer. Sits mid palate, not on tip or back of tongue...smack dab in the middle.  My favorite beer from Bell's was always Batch 9000 - and I should say I never particularly cared for Expedition fresh, always found it to be a bit astringent. With only a year of age on it this beer has just about dethroned it Batch 9K. Absolutely fantastic...highly recommend setting aside a few bottles for years to come.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Wadsey,4.12,"Expedition Stout, batch 8728, which was bottled on September 16, 2008  Served in DFH signature glass  A: Pours black with mocha-colored head that briefly emerges from murky depths and then retreats back, leaving oily legs on glass.   S: An abundance of crystal and roasted malts express themselves in caramel, figs, raisins and dark chocolate. Additional aromas include cocoa nibs, raisins and earth.   T: Quite sweet up front, but not unpleasantly so. This merges with  aforementioned characteristics seamlessly. Medium-high bitterness quashes sweetness, clearing way for roasty, herbal and somewhat dry finish. Alcohol is a little detectable.   M: Very big body and light carbonation. Chewy and warming.  A little powdery, which is odd, considering oily appearance.   O: I might prefer Expedition Stout at two years, but the contents of this bottle pleased my palate. Two knocks on this beer: booze seems amplified and the finish borders on harsh. ",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,thewalkindude,3.62,"Poured into a pint glass at the local Mellow Mushroom. I'm usually a huge fan of Russian Imperial Stouts, and while this one was pretty good, there were a few aspects that put me off about it. But I'll save that for a minute, first, let me get to what I liked about this beer. The appearance was a rich, black color, pretty much opaque when held up to the light. The Expedition sported a two-finger thick dark caramel head that faded relatively slowly and left a nice lacing on the glass, although not as much as I'm accustomed to with a stout. This one was heavy in the mouth, with a bit of a bite from the carbonation. As far as the actual taste of the beer is concerned, this one is bitter, even for a stout, with strong espresso, extra dark chocolate, and alcohol flavors throughout, which only grow stronger as it warms up. Left a pleasant bitter malt flavor on my tongue.  Unfortunately, the Expedition's carbonation makes the flavor sharper than I'm usually accustomed to in a stout. Also, it smells like wet play-doh on the beach, which I was forced to endure every time I brought it up to my lips. Besides these complaints, this was a solid beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

This beer pours THICK AND BLACK with a solid, creamy, 1 1/2 finger espresso crema colored head that has excellent retention and lacing.

Also, way in the back are licorice notes. The nose is quite comples indeed. T-In the flavor, bittersweet chocolate is the main player here. The burnt caramel comes through as well. After searching for more complexity, I found there is a huge roastiness in the flavor of this beautiful stout. The warming alcohol also translates into the flavor. M-Of course this beer has a huge, thick, creamy body. The finish is extremely long with bittersweet chocolate burnt caramel lingering on my palate.

Upon stir, get a temporary dark mocha, loose bubbled head (1/2 finger) which disappears very quickly. Border remains. A2: Dark brown, under 1/2 finger dark mocha head falls slowly to a broken sheet of the same. Spotty lacing. Clarity irrelevant.  S: Roasted malts, grains, hints of dates, figs, licorice. There's quite a metallic scent here too, a bit off setting. (2.5) S2: Roasted malts of coffee, dates and prunes. My initial impression upon opening this beer was a healthy dose of molasses, I no longer really smell this. Some cocoa there as well. Licorice is evident, but nicely integrated. (3)  T: Wow, the licorice takes over here. Also quite bitter. Dark, unsweetened cocoa in here. Fairly one dimensional. Finish resonates for what seems forever. It tastes burnt. (3) T2: Dry cocoa powder, licorice, burnt coffee, molasses now bites back. Hmm, reminds me of burnt toast with a wee bit of cinnamon/sugar over the top (very wee bit). (3.5)  M: Thick, low carbonation, very very sticky. (3) M2: Thinned out a bit, medium on low carbonation. Leaves a sticky finish with a dry feel. (3)  D: One is more than enough. I can't stand behind this beer. (3) O2: This beer is too roasted and burnt tasting for me. If it had a bit more molasses flavor, it would remind me of Nightstalker by GI.

Small, wet patches of bubbles are left clinging to the walls of the glass. Smells of dark fruits, some hops, chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of caramel.

To be honest, I was a little dubious about a beer this big, and with these flavors being able to make the transition nicely, but I was certainly wrong- it was very good indeed. I had this at the Atlanta Cask Ale Festival, and we're not talking a skimpy pour, but a good 1/2 nonic at least. Poured black, and quite bubbly, with good carbonation and quite a decent head, even with no sparkler and gravity poured. Nice aromas of espresso and licorice. Oh my, this tastes good! Beautiful and well integrated notes of espresso, licorice, chocolate, and roasted grains with a firm creaminess underpinning these flavors.

Two finger mocha head that dissipates into a collar of foam around the edges of the glass. Bubbles that vary in size floating around the top of the beer. Some legs as the beer rests back in the glass after sipping.  Bakers chocolate up front with anise woven in. A cup of strong espresso up next. Also a bit of very rich fudge and chocolate cake. Then a touch of bourbon like booze. Strange, this isn't barrel aged but it's definitely there.  The brew floods your mouth with chocolate like flavors at first. 80% cocoa bars, fudge brownie batter, and rich chocolate cake. Next we have espresso, then a touch of licorice and earthyness. Rounded out with a hint of whiskey. Time has done wonders here. Every flavor is very well integrated and none of them stand out more than another.  On the palate, it is divine. Silky smooth, oily, and full bodied. Almost no carbonation what so ever and a touch of drying. Fantastic.  Big cocoa and earth aromas accompany a touch of whiskey, with an outstanding melded together complex flavor that follows the subtle nose. A stout that I highly recommend to anyone. Especially aged.

287,1444,BarryMFBurton,4.44,"I love Bell’s batch number search engine; from those four little numbers on the back of my label, I was able to learn that this beer was packaged on January 27th, 2010. Good stuff. Now I’m even more excited; I love a stout with some age on it. Cheers!  Brewed over a year-and-a-half before the date of this tasting (“Packaged on January 27th, 2010”).  A: Thick and black, this beer pours an oily crude. The head is sexy, a dark brown micro-bubbled foam that takes some work to create. It’s a thick looking drink, though it doesn't leave any lacing. I’m not seeing any light through this one at all, even at the bottom of the glass.  S: WOW! What a nose! Coffee and hop bitters are still so big after 18+ months of aging; leafy pine and creamy mocha, mostly. The malts are just incredible. Semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla cream, dark fruit syrup – they’re all bold and savory. The alcohol kick on the back end is noticeable without being overbearing; just right. The flavor and balance of this nose could certainly even Founders KBS and Goose Island BCBS a run for their money...  T: Mmmm, very strong. The first thing you notice is the impressive smoothness of the malt flavors, with big chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Woody, boozy effects transition to this palate’s surprisingly big bitters. The burst of sharp hop resins are so tart that it takes me aback; this must be an absolute monster when it’s fresh. That dry, stinging aftertaste settles in for a long while, giving this stout an unexpectedly intense finish. I love the way this beer comes across – sweet and bitter in a smooth, sexy shell.  M: This is so important when it comes to a well-rounded stout, and these guys nail it. It’s superbly creamy, which adds a certain warmth to the already huge booze buzz that this 10.5% beer produces.  O: Damn. Good. Beer. Nothing more you can really say. This one’s a beer-ager’s dream, with enough malt complexity and hop resins to keep it interesting for up to a decade in the cellar, I’m sure. As a self-described hophead, this is one of the rare stouts that totally succeeds in capturing the essence of those bitter green flowers.

287,1444,Goblinmunkey7,4,"Appearance: Black, with edges of deep brown when held to light. Head is a solid tan/coffee with a little cream. Touches of lacing on the glass. Thin vestiges of foam on the top of the beer.  Smell: Dark fruit (plums and raisins maybe). Snap of alcohol in the back. Licorice, toasted malts, and sweetness. Almost akin to molasses, but lacks the nuance of the syrup. That same popcorn smell from Kalamazoo Stout is in the back as well. Caramel, coffee.  Taste: Char, smoke, and burnt malts. Deep and roasted with strong notes of caramel, old coffee beans, and cocoa. Booze kick in the back, but it's dominated by the char and dark fruit notes. It's like drinking a grilled plum. Sweet. Definitely sweeter than I like, but carries enough complexity to keep it interesting.  Mouthfeel: Creamy without being smooth. A little rough around the edges. Carbonation is a little low and prevents the beer from really hitting its stride.  Overall: Definitely solid, but it might need a little more time to polish off some of the rougher edges. Booze run a little high and the char flavors can be dominating.

287,1444,amphion1065,3.47,"12 oz. bottle into tulip. Batch 10105.  Pour is as close to black as could be. Glugs out of the bottle - it just looks viscous. Dark brown one-finger head that doesn't hang around for long. Minor lacing.  A classic RIS aroma. A lot of dark fruits, I can pick up plums and prunes in abundance. Some molasses, chocolate notes. There's a pronounced roast quality as well. I can detect just a hint of booze in the nose.  It's not hot at all, but man is this unbelievably bitter. Reminiscent of 90% cocoa combined with an astringent hop bite. There's an acrid, roast, burnt taste that reminds me of very dark coffee or, maybe more accurately, coffee grounds. There are some underlying flavors at work here: some chocolate, deep dark fruits. That said, the over-the-top bitterness drowns out many of the subtler qualities of the taste.  Mouthfeel is well done: it's thick, with medium carbonation. Given how big it is, it goes down pretty easily.  This is atypical of many stouts of similar ABV in that, although it really needs some more time to tone down, the alcohol bite is not overpowering. Rather, there are a ton of huge flavors that just need to coalesce and settle. I could see this drinking very well in a few months - or years - and would love to try an older bottle, but from my sample I can't deem this better than a slightly above-average RIS.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Opaque would be a good word for how this looks in a glass, only because there isn't a word that describes something that's darker, and permits less light to travel through it. There was absolutely zero head on this as I poured it, and lacing is nonexistent. This is about as smooth as a stout gets. Subtle bourbon hints, chocolate, and coffee comprise the bulk of the flavor profile. Does NOT taste like it's 10.5% ABV. Did I mention it was smooth? What an awesome offering by Bell's.

Poured into a snifter and I am met with a pure black ale and a beautiful brown fluffy head that quickly turns into a light layer. The aroma is very much chocolate with some heavy maple syrup in the background and some smoke, vanilla and caramel in the mix. Awesome stuff! The taste has a little bite to it with more chocolate coming through and a big smokey, coffee bean background to it. Almost like sucking on a coffee bean. Cigarette smoke-like aftertaste. A lot going on here. All good. Lightly carbonated but I was hoping for a smooth sip each time with all the explosions in the mouth going on.  Overall I must say this beat my expectations. I had to go to AZ to find this and I am happy I did. This beer packs a whallop in a 12 oz. pour and it makes me yearn for me.

287,1444,ehammond1,4.26,"Bottle (2010)  Acquired via trade Thanks sendsilk!  Jet black. Big and thick brown head. Thick and consistent lacing. Perfect. What more could you want?  Big and bold aromas of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. A touch of alcohol heat in the nose.  Taste is more of the same. Lots of chocolate and coffee flavors, a touch of alcohol, and some definite hop bitterness.  Thick, big, chewy mouthfeel. A pleasure. Perfect.  A wonderful, flavorful, and aromatic big stout. Would love to have this readily available. It does everything right.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Cavery,3.97,"12oz shared with Klym, bottle courtesy of SpdKilz (thanks for the throw in!)  This bottle was born in 2009, a good soldier.  into an Oversized wine glass.  A: Classic motor oil with small brown bubbles. Sticky groups of bubbles clump at the side, giving a look of caviar. Perhaps this thing is quite fancy! a thin creme brulee burnt sugar film keeps form above the motor oil body.  S: Bright biscotti milk chocolate. A heavy hand of nutmeg; with dashes of cinnamon and burnt sugars. Really quite a crazy nose for how BRIGHT the notes are. I mean really this is a bakery status nose. The chocolate notes are so pronounced that you can essentially visualize the texture of the cake. Graham cracker crusts wear heavy on the nose throughout.  T: Very milky flavors of nougat with swirls molasses and butterscotch. Caramel comes through in the collision of all 3 prior mentioned flavors. Carob chips, peanut butter, and chocolate all fly through the mouth in an unexpectedly cheap way. There's a crap load of flavor in here, it's really almost shocking. Cocoa nibs really hit me in the end, but they almost taste glazed in Splenda. A bit of an artificial sweetener taste in the end I'm not so fond of. However, there's much more going on here that's good than bad. Chocolate covered leather in the finish (love this note).  M: Really ever so milky without a definitive feeling of lactose. A medium-heavy body that isn't quite fully realized, but strong never the less. There most certainly is carbonation, but there's a strong feeling of wetness that stays in the mouth. Which I would say is much more characteristic of much flatter brews. This is not a flat beer, there is however, a weird transition.  O: At times, this is really very good, the flavor is far bolder than I ever could have hoped for. If I were to give a visual of this beer, it would be like a triple chocolate mousse pie with peanut brittle whip cream; speckled with cocoa nibs. However, if you were to consume this pie, you couldn't help but think that it was really just baked good version of a butter-finger. It comes off a bit cheaper in parts; but I can't deny that this is still a treat. Sometimes you'd like a cheap candy bar, and this beer is just that -- your cheap candy bar beer. You kind of have to be in the mood for a beer like this, and tonight I was in the mood. Tasty, but not fancy.  Edit - This beer gave me a pretty nasty headache, I didn't have anything else besides an amber, and it really tortured my skull. I downgraded the overall for this reason by .5 ! You've been warned ~_~",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Klym,3.98,"Thanks for SPDKilz for supplying this to Cavery in a recent trade and thanks to Cavery for sharing it. 2009 bottle. Poured into an oversized wine glass.  A: Pours a typical RIS black, but perhaps a little browner than most. Head is a light brown and is small but very lasting (to the end of the drink, there was at least a little head still sitting there). Lacing is spotty but so much more than you'd typically expect from a beer like this. Really good look.  S: Dark fruits (figs, dates, raisins) is perhaps the most stand out and typical aspect of the smell, but there's definitely a lot more going on. Graham cracker, a little vanilla, chocolate, coffee, woody-ness, nutty-ness, etc. are all definitely roaming about. Also, it admittedly smells pretty hot. The smell of this (much more than the taste) changed majorly with temperature so it's worth letting this sit out a bit.  T: Just like in the nose there's a lot going on here. Dark fruits hit with a smoky bite in the beginning, graham crackers (strong in the spice), grapes, and tons of nuts come in in the middle and it finishes off with a spicy coffee like bite and lingering nuts with vanilla. I can't quite do it justice; really complex and hard not to enjoy.  M: Mouthfeel could be a little thicker, but it is quite creamy and really acceptable as it is. The flavor and mouth sensations really travel up through the back of the tongue to the top of the mouth and the throat, but I find it a pleasant transition and experience and not an imbalanced one.  O: There's a big disparity between people and the bro's rating here and I feel confident the people have it right. I've had some average/mediocre RISs and this is definitely not one of them. Tons of complexity and plenty of delicious drinking to be enjoyed here.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Beerandraiderfan,4.5,"Beautiful slick black pour, mocha head, 1"" deep, no carbonation issues here. Looks professional, and one of those used motor oil type descriptors. Aroma of deep roast, chocolate.  Amazing coating of the palate with the luscious black liquid, great chocolate consistency throughout, larger than any other flavor component to the beer, and does a magnificent job at hiding over 10% abv. Similar to Rogue's double chocolate stout, but a little less chocolate, but hides the alcohol better and is much smoother. Somehow, despite the motor oil sludge appearance, this is kind of light on the palate in terms of drinkability and mouthfeel, gotta love something that brings that amount of chewiness and flavor, but doesn't just stick to your tongue/ribs. Can't beat the creaminess of this one. Slight cherry noticeable in the end, along with resonant notes of light espresso. Only bitterness comes from the chocolate.

Toasted malts dominate but are supported by notes of treacle toffee and milk chocolate.  T- Roasted malts with some toffee/milk chocolate sweetness. Roasted malts produce high bitterness in the finish and touch of hop gives a touch of dryness. Touch of alcohol presence.  M- Thick full body with a moderate carbonation.  D- A nice stout. This one is more on the roasted bitterness side in malt character whereas i prefer more support in the form of sweeter toffee/chocolate malts than evident here.

Little dark fruit sweetness. Taste follows through to the finish. Little more roasted bitterness and alcohol heat at the finish.  Full bodied and syrupy with a little chewiness and light carbonation.

287,1444,zac16125,4.35,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass Number on bottle: 8944, which didn’t mean much to me until I saw it was the exact same number as the last review on here, so apparently this is a 09 batch. I got this as a stand alone from a private liquor store where it was the only one, and the label does look quite worn.  A: Pours an opaque jet black. Poured very aggressively, it gives 1.5 fingers width of light caramel colored head, which appears dense, but dissipates relatively fast to leave a non-uniform film for about half the drink, then absolutely none for the remainder. Leaves effectively no lacing.  S: A nice, strong roasted malt aroma dominates, accompanied by some burnt malts, a smoky character, and some subtle bold-roast coffee aromas. Alcohol is noticeable. Pleasant aroma, but nothing particularly complex.  T: Lots of roasted and burnt malts, accompanied by hints of chocolate, bold-roast coffee, and an oaky character. There is an appreciable sweetness throughout, coming from dark fruits (maybe fig) with hints of bing cherries, plus a subtle hop bitterness on the back-end. It does a great job of balancing sweetness, burnt roasted malts, and bitterness all while making the alcohol presence known, but kept in check. Great flavor to this beer.  M/D: Smooth, creamy, an almost oily mouth feel. I’m not sure what all this talk from others about the no carbonation is all about, my bottle had plenty of carbonation, in fact, just the right amount. Incredibly easy to drink, and does a great job of masking the 10+%ABV.  O: This beer may have restored my faith in the RIS style. I went away from the style for a while, but recently decided to come back, and in the last couple of weeks have tried a handful of RIS’s, some of which are very highly ranked on this website. I was uniformly disappointed with them all, as they were mostly ruined by a dominating alcohol presence that killed the drink. Not this one. Expedition Stout maintains a great, well balanced flavor, good mouth feel and great drinkability.

Lot's of roasted malts, ground coffee, chocolate, and wisps of booze.  The mouth was hefty, chewy and just downright splendid. Palate-coating all the way. I dig it. The roasted aspects of the nose carry over to the flavor big time. This beer tastes charred, toasted, burnt -- whatever adjective you want to use. To the point that the sweet chocolate balance and the booze quality is drowned out completely.

287,1444,mjpolzin,4.06,"In the interest of fairness, I will probably have to come back and review this beer again as when I had it for the first time, I was in the middle of a long night knocking back a few with some friends so I wasn't taking the time to taste it properly.  The look of this beer was damn impressive. Amongst my friends I am the ""Dark Beer"" guy and this one for sure helped my reputation as it looked like motor oil going into the glass.  The interesting thing to me was I got more of a smokey, bitter taste with this then I do with most Imperial Stouts. That is why I want to come back and do it again because I wasn't getting the typical fruit, chocolate, liquorice that I get with an IS.  The alcohol was noticeable for sure as I had a nice buzz going after finishing the beer. At the very least, this beer is a nice solid Imperial Stout.  EDIT: I did come back and drink this again and now as I pay more attention, I do get the normal chocolate/fruity/liquorice flavor I do get from an Imperial Stout. I still get a little bit of a bitter taste though. I do notice also that there is very little carbonation. I like it more the second time though so I will upgrade the score.  EDIT #2: I am coming close to drinking a 2 year aged bottle of Expedition Stout so I just picked up a fresh batch for comparison sake. In reading my past reviews, I realize I have come to understand this beer a little better and I am hoping that the aged bottles will have a little more mellow of an alcohol taste and a little less of a hops presence.  EDIT #3: I had a 2 year old (2010) Expedition Stout tonight along side a fresh (2012) one. The 2010 was a much better beer than it's newer counterpart. The hops and roastiness had faded somewhat and what replaced it was a more malty, dark fruit, sweet taste. I personally like this better in an Imperial Stout than what this beer offers when fresh. I have one bottle of 2010 left so I would like to sit on it for about another 2 years before trying it again.  What I need to do soon is do a side by side taste test of Founders and Bell's Imperial Stouts because they both seem similar to me in that they improve with age.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Head poured 1/4"" thick, but died down to a thin film across the top and a good ring.  Smell: With a swirl, definite alcohol and solvent. After that subsides, quite faint roasted malt - maybe a hint of something grassy and hoppy.  Taste: Bitter coffee with a wonderful malty sweetness to counter the bitterness. Bitter coffee up front moving into the sweetness in the middle and then another bitter finish. Sweetness has hints of vanilla to it. A very tasty brew.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and smooth with a some mild spicy carbonation on the back of the tongue. Very nice.  Overall / Drinkability: A beer for sipping and savoring. I had it with burger and fries and it went wonderfully, but I could see having it alone and with dessert as well in place of coffee.

A sip has a great smooth viscosity - big roasty, caramel malts slowly shifts to a nice coffee and herbal hop bitterness and tang that sticks to the end.

Taste is huge, mouthwatering roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, with a lingering, bitter finish. I think the acidity supports the beer well, but the bitterness on the finish is a little much. Medium carbonation and medium-full body are appropriate for the style, although the heat is noticeable. Overall, this is a well crafted, malt bomb of a stout, whose latter feature limits somewhat its drinkability.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

From everything I had read before I tried it I expected it to be in Old Rasputin, Plead the 5th, and Speedway Stouts class, but it was a clear step down for me.

A one finger mocha colored head formed upon pouring and reduced to a ring of foam around the top. Very little lacing.  S: Dark fruits, licorice, chocolate and some coffee. There is a little bit of roasted malt and the slightest hint of alcohol.  T: Coffee and roasted malts are the dominant flavors with some chocolate, licorice, and a little bit of molasses.  M: Medium to full bodied. Smooth and creamy, with a slickness. Nice carbonation, more than expected, but not in a bad way.  O: Quite nice. Form reading other reviews, I think that some of the coffee flavor subsided a little bit.

287,1444,SolomonGrundy,3.92,"Thanks to GraniteSkunk for the fine extra. Cheers!!  The basics: no idea on price and a hefty and hearty 10.5% ABV (YEEESSS, my precious!!)  Pours a super-uber dense black, like the darkness of the Mines of Moria. A creamy head about a finger thick. Spotty lacing. Above average...  Aromas are intense and robust. Lot's of semi-sweet chocolate, some vanilla, roasted chocolate malt. Also some rounder notes like pancakes with syrup and butter. Luscious....  OMFG - the flavor is...INSANITY!!! It's robust to the power of 100. I almost can't believe this. Super tangy and a nuclear blast of malt right upfront. This smooths out a touch into a massive roasted chocolate espresso flavor in the early middle. This lengthy middle eventually gives way to a tangy and complicated finish - I get some bitter hops and some char, and also some boozy notes. This has to be tried to be believed...It will be too much for even some seasoned Imperial Stout fans, as this makes even Old Raspy look smooth and creamy by comparison...But this beer is very smooth in its own right, I only mean that Old Rasputin is a robust and tangy RIS in its own right, but is nothing as crazy as this...It's like coffee concentrate mixed with chocolate chip extract and poured into a glass of Imperial Stout...And that doesn't even do it justice. As it warms, I even get some nice barrel aging notes. Fantastic but definitely a sipper and not a ""drink with your buddies at the river in summer"" beer...  What I like most: The insanely robust and complex flavor profile.  What I like least: The almost overwhelming nature of the beer as a whole.  Verdict: Not for the faint of palate, this needs to be tried (price be damned) to be believed...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bnes09,4.57,"Ink black and completely opaque. Ample amount of auburn colored foam. Exceptional retention for a beer of this strength, thanks to the hops, in part. Lots of sticky lines on the glass.  Highly complex, deep roasted aromas. Coffee and licorice. Assertive alcohol spice reminisent of a dark merlot. Smoked maple, molasses and prunes come through as well.  Spectacular flavors of dark coffee, baking chocolate, licorice, molasses, prunes, raisins, and sweet maple syrup. Hops are assertive, pungent, almost biting with a piney, soap-like bitterness that lasts into the aftertaste. Alcohol spice of bourbon rounds it out nicely. Highly complex and delicious from beginning to end.  Full-bodied, thick and chewy mouthfeel, just like a meal. Low level of carbonation is fitting.

287,1444,Transatlantic,4.5,"A - You crawl your way under a 1989 Dodge Shadow, use a torque wrench to break loose the screw. Out pours the liquid that has been lubing the engine parts for five years without a change. That is what you see when you pour Bell's Expedition Stout. Old old burnt motor oil, black as black can be. No light on this planet can pierce through this beer with it's one finger dark mocha chocolate head.  S - As an RIS should be, it's loaded with the smell of dark dark bitter chocolate with a hint of roasted coffee. Dark dark malty goodness.  T - The first initial kick you get is just how sweet this beer is. Mixed with that taste of dark bitter chocolate, this is almost like drinking chocolate syrup...only appetizing.  M - The mouthfeel is as you'd guess judging by the way it pours. Full solid bodied beer, leaving no part of the mouth uncoated. This beer keeps it's flavor lingering around for a long while.  O - You can NOT give this beer a bad review. For it's style, it's a winner. Great appearance, great flavor, great thickness.

Good lace  S: Sweet molasses and alcohol dominate, but at 10.5% I was expecting it. Also present are vanilla, espresso and spicy, dark fruit.  T: Very sweet plum, date and/or apricot flavor up front. Heavy coffee ground and espresso middle with an alcoholic, slightly minty finish. Every other sip I sense almond.  M: There's almost a viscosity to this beer but that doesn't make it difficult to drink. It's fairly carbonated and creamy with only a fair stickiness at the end.

287,1444,ribsfate,4.2,"Had this as my fifth overall selection from Bell's. Not in the same sitting. :)  Poured into a pint glass from bottle bought at Thirsty's Quik Six in York, PA. About 20 mins at room temp.  Pours very dark black, somewhat thick with a nice two finger, foamy, dark caramel colored head. (poured a little fast and sipped the head; instant chocolate blast) Head laced the glass until it was rinsed out. Very pretty beer.  Nose is roasty malts and chocolate with a hint of hops on the back end. Tiny amount of alcohol scent for the strength.  Taste is a bit like the head but much more subdued chocolate notes, leading into bunches of smokey, roasted barley, bitter coffee, just a touch of hop bitters. Very nicely balanced flavors which sorta play back and forth as you drink.  A very smooth (imho) feel from start to finish. Not as thick or heavy as i was expecting but not in the least disappointing. Doesn't leave a residual flavor for very long.  I enjoyed this brew very much and am currently in the search for one or two more singles, warm, to store and try at a later date.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Roke87,4.15,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel tulip at cellar temperature. Bell’s Batch Number: 9971 Bottled on: Sept.13/2010  Appearance- Pours a pitch black colour like dirty old motor oil with a two finger of nice fluffy brown mocha coloured head that resides at an average pace to a thick ring around the glass leaving lots of sticky lacing throughout till finish.  Smell- Is very similar on the nose to a Founders imp stout, except I smell a hint of hops thrown in there. Lots of roasted malts, a mild coffee smell, with a sweet caramel/toffee nose with a hint of chocolate in there, I could definitely get a hint of alcohol out of this one.  Taste- Comes through just like the smell, although I didn’t get too much hops in the taste as I could smell. Lots of roasted malt flavours and dark fruity flavours as well that are almost sweet on the palate, not too much caramel/toffee on the taste either but it does finish with a bitter coffee flavour balanced again by the roasted malts. Also finishes with a little bit of an alcohol taste but not overly intense.  Mouthfeel- I would say this is a full bodied imperial stout that finishes smooth a creamy, They do a very good job of hiding the high ABV but it does comes through a bit in the finish. Not overly carbonated but not many stouts are anyways so I would say it’s just right in those terms.  Overall- To be honest I kind of expected more from this one; it is very similar to a number of other imperial stouts and not as good as a few others although it does come through in many respects. The Smells are well balanced which translates to an equally balanced, smooth, and almost easy drinking taste. I would say this is Bell’s flagship beer but you could pick up a number of other Bell’s offerings and be just as satisfied but none the less a very solid offering. For the high price point I think I’ll just pick up the similar stouts and pass on this one in the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smooth warming alcohol provide a nice facet.  M - Silky smooth creamy mouth. Spiced, warming alcohol finish. Dry and sweet aftermath.  O - A nice imperial stout.

287,1444,EricCioe,4.67,"Batch 10105, 10 December 2010, just under six months old.  This pours pitch black with no highlights, floating a big two finger dark tan head on top that leaves great, chunky lace on the way down. A really pretty brew. On the nose there is a really high level dark chocolate and espresso, with a deep, pungent pine combining with a massive presence of roast malt underneath. In the mouth the pieces of the nose come through: bitter chocolate, nicely bitter coffee, bitter hops, and bitter roasted malt. It's not overwhelmingly bitter, just very pleasantly so. There is a dash of heat to go with the hugely rich taste. The body is huge, gigantic, full, with a huge finish that has slightly charred malt and espresso bitterness hanging out forever.  Overall, this beer is amazing. I was expecting to like it but not this much. This is right up, and probably just a cut above, the two other great MI RIS, Dark Horse Plead the 5th and FIS. This is an absolutely amazing brew and proof that there are great, great stouts sitting on shelves.  EDIT - Had a mini two year vertical last night, 20 January 2012. We had bottles from late 2010, same batch as the original review, and late 2011. After a year, this is a totally different beer. The nose is unreal as it develops this wonderful molasses note that is buried in the fresher ones. One of the true outstanding Russian imperials I've ever had. Being able to buy six of these at will is one of the biggest beer-related things I miss about living in the Midwest.  Fresh, this beer is pretty hot. After a year, it's totally transformed. I've never had a beer change more in a year than this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

First, I have to admit, this was my first ever Imperial Stout. I was in love from the first sip!  This is a bold, robust beer. It has very intense flavors. Dark bitter chocolate, booze, roasted malts all come through. Some slight fruitiness as well. A fairly thick beer, leaving some solids in the bottom of the glass.

Dark brown almost black opaque body, one finger light brown head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Divine nose, a combination of dark chocolate and cocoa nibs, a wee bit of coffee, and surprisingly a pretty robust hop aroma, citrus and pine resin, was able to shine through. The taste mirrors the nose, chocolatey goodness, leading to a fairly bitter resiny finish, nicely in balance. The mouthfeel is fairly astringent and sticky, which surprised the hell out of me. This is a really tasty beer, lthough the alcohol is still a bit hot at this juncture. ooking forward to trying later on once the hops have been tamed a bit on the remaining bottles aging down in The Hole.

Tastes of chocolate covered dark fruits (raisins), sweet chocolate caramel, and slight roasted coffee beans. This beer is super thick with low carbonation.

287,1444,cetherid,4.4,"poured into a tulip  A.  Beer pours a nice dark brown to black color, with no light coming through at all. pretty much your typical RIS. A nice thick light brown head (a little over a fingers worth).  S.  Big dark roasted malts in this. Aromas of bittersweet cocoa, roasted coffee as well as molasses and dark fruits. Some subtle alcohol, which was expected but not too strong.  T.  Taste just as big as the aroma. Chocolate covered dark fruits, sweet caramel/molasses and roasted coffee are the dominant flavors. A pretty decent hop profile gives it a nice little bitterness that works well with all the dark malts. Booziness is definitely more prevalent in the taste compared to the aroma, but nothing overwhelming. A pretty solid tasting beer that only gets better with a little age.  M.  full bodied with great carbonation. A very creamy consistency that goes down silky smooth, leaving you with just a touch of alcohol warmth.  O.  A pretty solid RIS. I consider this a bigger and more flavorful Old Raspy. This beer is available at pretty much any store in the area that carries craft beer. True it's around 17-18 bucks a sixer, but definitely worth it if you're craving a big Russian Imperial. One of Bell's top beers IMO.

Heavy malt aromas of dark chocolate and burnt coffee beans. The smell is creamy and rich, but not very sweet.  Just like the smell, dark chocolate and coffee are enveloped in a milky creaminess. A slight alcohol warmth creeps in at the end of each sip, but it is not as strong as the 10.5% ABV could be.  Thick and creamy, this beer coats your mouth and is only slightly sticky.

Despite an excellent, syrupy mouthfeel, there's something vaguely medicinal about Expedition in the mouth, so while the taste isn't bad, it isn't spectacular. Yes, I would absolutely do this beer again, but as far as stouts go it isn't quite up there with, say, Yeti or Surly Darkness.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,beerpirates,4.28,"12 oz bottle poured into my lost abbey stemware glass  Pours pitch black with a small, dark chocolate head . Aroma is amazing and strong. Smells like roasted nuts, caramel, coffee, and a little bit of bourbon. The taste is powerful, sweet, and well supported by the thickness of the brew. It's a mix of bittersweet chocolate, caramel, some oak, a nice hint of sourness from the malt, and some alcohol. Finishes thick and a little bitter--coats the mouth so you must drink more. Not quite as overpowering as Bourbon County Stout, making it a little easier to keep drinking.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,azdback,4.47,"Batch 10105. Poured into a large tulip glass. Dark as sin. Absolutely no light through this or any highlights to speak of. The head is maybe a finger and a half, dark coco colored and frothy like something you would get at Starbucks. The lace doesn't seem to want to stick around.  First smell is alcohol and coffee, with the alcohol on top. There is also dark roasted malts and molasses black strap, and a lot of dark chocolate. Very nice!!  The taste is as awesome as the smell. It isn't as much chocolate or coffee, as the smell, but more tart of a currant.. At least at first. As I swallow the rich flavors of the roasted malts come out. Dark coffee and dark chocolate. The alcohol shows it's face at the end, and then some more tartness.  The mouth is a bit above what I expected. I know this beer is seasonal and quite expensive, but I didn't expect the mouth of a top notch wax topped RIS. I would give this a higher score but the tart dryness kept it from being perfect.  Overall I was really surprised by this one. I tried a bottle of this last year but don't remember it being this good. I will cellar the last two from my six pack and see how good it is next year and the next.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Sweet, and slightly hot, typical RIS with chocolate and coffee notes, bit of roasted malt, caramel, and molasses.  T - Sweet, molasses and chocolate are definitely there, and it drinks a little bit boozy as well. Some roast, but it is a bit heavy on the molasses and taste a little burnt as well. It's okay, but nothing special.  M - Slightly overcarbed, but full bodied.

287,1444,COBeerBuff,4.2,"The 2008 vintage 12 oz. bottle was received via trade from lackenhauser in Black Booty '11.  Appearance: The vigorous pour into a Spiegelau tulip glass yields two fingers worth of mocha colored head. I'm amazed at the amount considering this beer is almost 3 years old. The retention is amazing, and the look of the head on top of the opaque black liquid looks awesome!  Smell: Vanilla, cocoa, toffee, and buttermilk all highlight a very powerful nose on this heady brew. There are also some hints of spiced malts as well, but the predominant flavors are all sweet caramel and sugar goodness. This smells decadent! The bourbon wood and vanilla flavors create such a fervent combination that this might be the best nose I've smelled on a bourbon-bal aged stout ever.  Taste: This beer is a malt bomb to be sure. The initial sip yields a ton of toasted and roasted grains and barley. The burnt taste carries through to the aftertaste, for sure. The sweetness that was present in the nose isn't quite as prevalent in the palate, but there is a bit of carmelly sweetness and a bit of vanilla goodness, but it's a lot more muted than I expected.  Mouthfeel: For a 3 year old beer, this is a lot heavier than I expected. The flavors feel a lot more put together, but the overall mouthfeel is quite heavy. This is a sipper, through and through.  Drinkability: If I could get another bottle or two of this beer, I would totally would. I've passed on this beer locally so to get a 3 year old bottle in trade as an extra is wickedly awesome. Thanks lackenhauser for the experience. The alcohol is definitely present in the nose, but the finish is definitely smoother than expected.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,legalpete19340,3.43,"A: Poured thick and blackish brown. No head to speak of until I poured aggressively, then I got a solid finger of head that quickly dissipated into a small ring of bubbles. Seemed to coat the glass reasonably well.  S: I get a lot of alcohol off this guy. Some roasted malt and burnt brown sugar.  T: Molasses with plenty of burnt coffee and tons of alcohol coming through as scotch. A few notes of english toffee and a big malt background with dark chocolate. As it warms I swear I pick up some noticeable hop character. The alcohol burns and warms at the end.  M: Thick, heavy and velvety. Full and foamy.  O: Thick, sweet and very boozey. I found this beer interesting then hard to drink after just a few swigs. It seemed unbalanced in the way of too much booze and burnt.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,gopens44,4.26,"OK, I have no idea how long this bottle had been at my house. It went from cellar to fridge about 2 months ago (planned on drinking it, but forgot to...) and I reckon I bought it 3 - 4 months ago. I even forgot to check the date. I'd assume this was a 2010 release though. Sorry for sketchy vintage notes!  A - Poured all sorts of black. I didn't see much head happening so I began pouring this with some vigor. Still didn't see much. I turned away for a moment while it was settling only to return to a dark brown head explosion flowing out of the snifter onto my counter top. So let's just say it eventually developed a monster foam head....  S - I let this warm up pretty well in order to get some decent aroma. What I found was a pretty run of the mill RIS signature, holding coffee and chocolate  T - This is where I was blown away. Deep, rich bitter chocolate flavor with coffee in there as well. Very well masked alcohol (couldn't detect any at all in the taste actually). I can compare the depth of flavor to the depth of color in barrel dyed leather. No matter how far you try and sift through this to find a point where the flavor drops off, it simply doesn't happen. At no point throughout this wonderful thing did it ever waiver from the richness that I initially tasted, and in fact, it just grew more tasty throughout.  M - Very viscous, almost chewy. Silky and creamy. There was certainly some alcohol warmth in the back of the throat as well. Full bodied with very little carbonation on the tongue. Mildly bitter aftertaste.  O - To say I was ""wowed"" by this is a gross understatement. I'm sad that I hadn't discovered this sooner, but now I know!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,NODAK,4.02,"Aroma Has definite notes of molasses, alcohol, and raisins on it, but the dark fruits dominate, though.  Pours black as midnight with a negligible head to it. Basically a black, syrupy pour.  Mouthfeel is as thick as any I have ever had. Ridiculously viscous. Carbonation is pretty low. Body of the beer has a high degree of molasses like sweetness with a definite, strong dark fruit component to it and perhaps a hint of anise. Finishes with some booziness and some roasted malt with an espresso character showing up at the end and lingering a while. Hops do not exist as far as I can tell.  Very drinkable RIS here, even if it may not be my absolute favorite. I do like how this one is all malt, and they do a decent job of masking the alcohol considering the ABV.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mavbrew,3.92,"A: Deep dark brown color with minimal head, even with a strong pour, color is dark tan. The little bit of head fades very quickly and leaves no lacing whatsoever.  S: The smell is very sweet, mainly dark fruits and a bit of a boozy scent to it as well.  T: The taste is much like the smell, very sweet with some dark fruits up front followed by a molasses flavor, a good amount of boozy flavor and slight roasted malts (very slight). The finish has some smokey characteristics and is boozy.  M: Full bodied with no carbonation. Creamy, sweet and boozy feel.  D: Overall, this is a good beer. It's tough to be a great beer with some many outstanding RIS's but this is a good example.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Mebuzzard,3.16,"Thanks to Knownfactor for this bottle, and two more.  Pours black, perhaps some brown edging, but overall this thing is dark. That's the good part. No head at all. I could be persuaded to say it has a collar...  Aroma is boozy up front. This takes away from the nice prune and black plum, dark chocolate and molasses aromas. Too bad.  Again, booze really hinders the flavors. I know they are there. The cocoa is thinned out and the dark, soft fruits are too soaked. It has some sharp agents, too. Anise and quick roasted malt give it a bit of a kick. This one *needs* age on it. Ok with me.  Overall a nice beer. Too boozy right now to warrant higher ratings, but it has great potential.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Auracom,3.77,"2-3 oz. from the 12 oz. bottle on March 24th, 2011 in my mini snifter - one of 10 beers in my stout tasting; from notes.  A - Not quite a complete black color, really no head/retention from this sample.  S - Underlying toffee and caramel malts, slight mocha, raisins, and some alcohol.  T - Raisins and other dark fruits dominate front and middle of tongue. Bitterness from coffee and chocolate/dark chocolate in back.  M - A lot of carbonation in this one... far more than I was anticipating and more than is generally necessary for the style. Medium-heavy body, no chewyness.  D - More alcohol detection in this one than I'd like. It's not very focused and doesn't find a real balance in the taste. The core dark fruit flavors just don't work very well. Combined with an average nose, and it's an okay example from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BeerBuckeye,4.54,"A - Pours a dark viscous black almost sludgey (in a good way), with a good, mocha colored 3 finger head. Great looking stout.  S - Smells of roasted malt, coffee and mocha, chocolate, and dark fruits. A lot of great smells mixing together here, makes a good bittersweet combination.  T - Heavy on the chocolate up front that fades into a bitter roasted coffee. Sweetness is muted, but a great taste if you like heavy coffee stouts.  M - Coats the entire mouth before leaving a faint dryness. Hides the 10.5% ABV very well, to make a very, very drinkable, high ABV beer.  Overall - I loved this beer. Being a fan of coffee stouts, I couldn't get enough of this. An absolutely delicious beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Coffee, cocoa and cream make themselves known in the aroma. Very nice way to start things off.  Roasted coffee explodes on the tongue, leading to a good hint of chocolate and cream as well (the latter being limited).  Visceral and slick on the palate. Lingering cocoa and coffee. Impressive as is.  Amazing example of the style that is very drinkable at 10.5%. I have to admit that I had never heard of this until now. Regardless, I will most likely seek it out again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,greenmonstah,4.15,"12 oz bottle into pint glass. Bottled December 10 2010  A - Pours a deep black with half a finger of intense brown head with minuscule bubbles. Good retention for the ABV. excellent lacing.  S - Bitter chocolate, roasted malt and caramel. Very clean backround. Dark malt and some sweetness. Dark fruits come to light as it warms.  T - Robust is definitely a fitting word. Lots of intense malt flavor going on. Sweet caramel/toffee and a good roasted characteristic. A bit of a dark fruity sweetness is also present. Some hints of booze, but overall it is well hidden. Not much in the way of hop that I can pick out. Finish is bitter and almost sour.  M - Full body with a surprising amount of carbonation and a very dry finish. Thick and sticky. Smooths out considerably as it warms. Drink it at 50-55 degrees.  O - It's not world class, but it is damn drinkable. Very tasty and pleasant, and the feel is intense. Very very full bodied, almost chewy. Michigan-area residents, color me jealous. To have access to this and FBS (nor to mention all the other great area beers) is like a dream come true. I've been on a bit of a tear lately with Saisons, Hefes, and other lighter beers, so this RIS hit me like a ton of bricks, and I loved every minute of it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,titosupertramp,4.44,"A: Pours very thick and dark. Almost black with only a sliver of brown when a tilted glass is held to light. The carbonation is a bit disappointing as, even with an aggressive pour, it produces hardly any head. Quickly retreats into the beer leaving behind no film to speak of except around the edges of the glass.  S: Not overpowering, but complex and interesting. Bitter chocolate, molasses, roasted malt, carmel, coffee/espresso, dark fruit, what seems like citrus hops in the background. Has an estery quality to it as well. Very nice.  T: Everything mentioned in the nose comes through in the taste. A little surprised how evident the hops are in the taste...just an observation, not a complaint by any means.  M: Thick and chewy, but creamy at the same time if that makes sense. Leaves a coated mouth with terrific aftertastes.  O: Alcohol, for me, was not present in nose or taste which makes this dangerously drinkable...not that you would want to gulp this down anyway.

Nice finger of mocha color frothy head with very tiny bubbles, but it dissipates fairly quickly to a small collar around the edges. A little bit of lacing on the glass but it slides down from all the alcohol feet.  Nose is semi sweet chocolate, roasted malts, a bit of light coffee, slight sourness, and burnt caramel. Sourness became more apparent as the beer warmed to room temperature, but it wasn't too off putting.  Tastes follows the nose closely, chocolate and roasted malts bittering initially, smooth sweet chocolate ending with a mix of lactic sour and burnt caramel. Nice creamy mouthfeel from the full bodied beer lightened slightly by the ample small bubble carbonation.

Then a nice sweet taste followed abruptly by the alcohol on the back end with some astringency to clean the palate.  M- Extremely smooth, creamy, and definitely full. Floods the palate with heavy smoked overtones and in all honesty for all you single malt fans out there a bit of peat.  O- Very good beer for after dinner, before, or with not so much.

S- Dark fruit aroma. Chocolate, roasted malts coffee notes. Boozy smell to it.  T- Pretty harsh flavors here. Wasn't expecting that much bitterness up front. Roasted malts mixed with dark fruits, raisins maybe. Followed by burnt coffee flavors. Flavors didn't seem to mesh as well as they could have. Still nice strong flavors throughout. Can't wait to hold one for a year or so and see what happens.  M- Full body with little carbonation. Coats your mouth.  D- Overall its an ok RIS.

The bitterness I'd lend to the high abv that lingers in the back of the mouth forever. Sweetness is definitely chocolate.  Mouthfeel - extremely thick as it looks, definitely enjoyable.

287,1444,Hoops4life511,4.24,"12 oz bottle received as an extra from a trade with ant880, thanks Anthony. Batch number 10105. Poured into oversized snifter.  Appearance - Nearly opaque black with fluffy tan head that clings to the glass. Falls at a decent rate and clings to the glass leaving gorgeous lacing. Everything you'd want from a great stout.  Smell - Coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of alcohol up front. A slight hint of raisin and soy sauce appears as I bury my nose in the glass. Not an amazing nose, but certainly not terrible.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Roasty smokey malt dominates initially and gives way to a slight sweetness. It is thick and oily in my mouth and leaves my mouth bone dry as I swallow. Burnt coffee is left in the finish and leaves me wanting more.  Overall - Very tasty and potentially dangerous beer at 10.5% ABV. I've wanted to try this for a while, but being unavailable in NJ my only options were to buy a case in PA or trade.

287,1444,Avagadro,4.8,"A: Pours with the same consistency as motor oil into my CCB snifter. Its ominous viscosity is matched by this brew's black body. It's head is fleeting, but is of a chocolate color.  S: Deep notes of molasses, licorice, and chocolate are upfront and well balanced. No one aroma pushes the other out of the way; they simply jive together.  T: Big, rich, and delicious. This brew is semi-sweet, with bold molasses, bitter espresso, and black chocolate in the forefront. As the initial blast of flavor fades, subtle flavors of creme brulee and dulce de leche occupy the palate until you are ready for another onslaught of flavor.  M: Fuller-than-full body, chewy texture, sticky finish, and little in the way of CO2.  O: How it has taken me this long to review one of my favorite RISs, I cannot say. This is easily one of the most underrated examples of the style. Is it because it is too available, too commonplace? This brew is as delicious as many of the sought-after rarities, but doesn't get the credit.

Some noticeable dark chocolate in there also. Smells nice and toasty and malty. I kind of get a vanilla bean aroma also. Slight alcohol fragrance, but nothing off putting.  Taste - The taste was very similar to the smell. Robust, roasty coffee and chocolate. Burnt flavoring with splash of vanilla. A stronger touch of alcohol in the flavor, but welcome. A nice little burn.  Mouthfeel - Medium/full to mostly full mouthfeel. Smooth. Dry. A lot of flavor left on the palate. A considerable warmth from the alcohol. Chewy and slightly oily. Slick feeling.  Drinkability - This Stout is extremely nice in my opinion. It's strong, so that may exclude some from liking it and it may hurt with overall drinkability for them, but it's still very, very good. Worth a try if you are a Stout lover.

Some foamy brown head forms and lingers on the edge of the glass for a while. Quite a bit of soapy tan head.  Smell is wafting up out of my snifter. Feel like I can smell it from 3 feet away. My DFH snifter really seems to bring out aroma very well and this beer is no exception. Lots of chocolate, both milk and dark with some coffee roastiness underneath. This aroma is perfectly suited for my tastes, eerr nose.  Flavor is quite similar to aroma. The chocolate in the nose is toned down in the taste and really blends with the other flavors. The flavor isn't terribly complex, keeping the score down there, but this is a very enjoyable stout. The chocolate comes in initially, followed by the coffee, which has taken on more of a roasted barley flavor, then some bitter hops on the back of the tongue.  Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. Tons of body and quite slick in the mouth without being overly sweet on the finish. Perfect mouthfeel for style. Flavor lingers forever on the palate making this a perfect sipping beer on a cold winter day. This brew is fairly warm as it goes down which is not surprising considering the 10.5% ABV. Drinkability is good for style, not great. Overall a very well done RIS. I'd rate it almost perfect if it wasn't for the lack of complexity in the flavor. Very glad I got a chance to try this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Nerudamann,3.48,"Poured from a bottle into a Pint glass.  Look - extremely dark black, with about a third of a finger's worth of foam that dissipates slowly.  Smell - typical stout smell, with a caramel or molasses hint.  Taste and Mouthfeel - strong taste, but not too strong..mostly in hop flavor but masked by molasses or coffee flavors. The texture is as intensely creamy as it appeared when I poured it.  Drinkability - a little bitter but not too bad for my taste. Somewhat complex, and tastes okay.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SuperSpy,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass. No freshness date but I don't think this beer needs one. Hell, it's probably too young to drink.  A - Black. Not a hint of light gets through. This is also thick. It looks like oil. It has a very thick head that's the color of chocolate milk and sticks to absolutely every edge of the glass. This Russian Imperial looks like it is out to wrestle a Siberian Bear (and with a 10.5% ABV it will probably knock it out).  S - There is a lot of sweet dark aromas in the smell of this beer. There is raisin, molasses, roasted barley, figs, dark cherries and vanilla. The aroma is like a toasted, rum soaked fruitcake. All of those aromas are there and more.  T/M - The first thing that is very apparent is that this beer is thick and creamy. This is a very heavy bodied beer. It just sort of floats on the tongue and lets you taste all of the sweet and roasted flavors. There is dark cherries, cocoa, roasted barley, bitter chocolate, molasses, currants, dried figs, plenty of warm alcohol, and lots of hoppy bitterness. Despite the strong hops the beer is still relatively sweet because of all the dark fruit and sugary flavors. The finish is a bit more bitter and dry than the beginning or middle but you don't care because you want to taste all of those sweet dark flavors that come with each sip. The only place I would knock the taste is in the hop flavor. There is just too much citrus. It has a very strong grapefruit character that I'm certain comes from a liberal use of American hops and it detracts from what is otherwise really great complex flavor.  D - This is the third or fourth time I've had this beer and I must admit that the first time I tried it I wasn't blown away. However, I have to say that each time I drink this I am more and more impressed. At the same time, this isn't my favorite RIS and I think it's because of the citrusy/grapefruity hop flavors. I will definitely recommend this beer, but only drink one because the 10.5% ABV packs a punch. And judging by the number of misspelled reviews of this beer I would say I'm not the only one that has felt its effects.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,tehchunk,3.97,"A - Poured straight into a Bell's tulip glass. A very welcoming two-finger, brown head that quickly subsides into a thin ring that sits on top of an opaque, black, delicious-looking beer. Definitely looks like a Russian Imperial Stout!  S - Dark chocolate comes through the strongest. Followed nicely by roasted notes of coffee, some hint of dried fruit, slightly nutty.  T - Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, raisins plus other sweet dried fruit. Coffee is predominant & makes up the (delightfully) lingering after-taste. Lots of bitterness which is to be expected for an RIS that should mellow out nicely with some age.  M - Thick. That can be the only word to describe this beer. Smooth, creamy; pretty much everything an RIS should be. Rests nicely on the tongue with a slight tingling sensation.  D - It's about as drinkable as any other RIS. It's a true sipper that gets nice with a little warmth. Not sure I could drink more than a bottle in one sitting.

T- Dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, raisins, roasted pecans... sweet and syrupy, but with a nice dry hop bite! WOW!!!  M- So thick!!! Just sticks to every part of your mouth!

Dark boost fruits on the nose, with a jolt of coffee and chocolate roasted notes. Rummy. Lots of character and power but a little hot.  Flavor follows suit. Molasses and chocolate and coffee grounds. The dark fruit component is very strong. Thick mouthfeel, quite viscous and slick.

287,1444,cameraman,4.53,"Poured a black opaque color with a dark beige to toffee colored head, that is about a quarter inch high. The head then dissolves itself to a thin layer just on top off the blackness. Dark bread and dried fruit are there at first scent, then dark roasted grain and coffee hits the nose. Then a twang of alcohol comes forward, that all blends to a sweet molasses scent at the end. A sweet malty and sugary taste is at the front, then dark bread and burnt coffee flavors take over. It finishes with a strong piney and grassy bitterness that lingers long after each taste is gone. A medium-heavy feel rolls on to the palate and stays consistent, till it reaches the back of the palate, where it thins out slightly. A strong beer in this style, where other brewers dominate this with string and overwhelming flavors, Bell's works to keep this beer on the straight and narrow.

S - Big chocolate, licorice, roasted malts, vanilla, sweet caramel. Nice complexity, and a good nose.  T - Holy cow.

S - Wonderful melange of molasses, chocolate, coffee, licorice, earthy hops, leather and sweet tobacco. Aroma is deep and complex.  S - Initial taste is intensely bitter and complex with rich chocolate notes, a subtle coffee presence and hints of tobacco and leather. Herbal, earthy hop notes mingle with bittersweet molasses in the backend until the expedition concludes with a bold roasted malt character and assertive bitterness in the finish.  M - Luxurious mouthfeel with a silky, smooth yet chewy texture and moderate alcohol tang. Plenty of bitterness on the palate, although the nitro pour really softens it up magnificantly.

A - Pours an opaque black with a nice 1.5 finger head. Surprising for the high alcohol content in this one. Head is light brown and sticks around for most of the tasting leaving great lacing. Excellent looking beer.  S - Dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, licorice and alcohol. Pretty good aroma, just a little boozy.  T - Expedition is one of the most bitter stouts I think I've had. Begins with some roasted malt and dark chocolate. Then I get some coffee and more dark chocolate and alcohol. The finish is VERY bitter roasted flavor, hop flavor and quite boozy. Quite good now but I imagine that in a year or two, this will be excellent.  M/D - Full bodied and it really suits this one. The thickness and alcohol presence lower the drinkability but it's welcome.  Another very good beer from Bell's, I have yet to be underwhelmed with any of their offerings.

287,1444,camp0474,3.47,"Review from 12/30/10  Disclaimer - I had this beer pretty fresh and after drinking it I think it should spend some time in the cellar.  A: Pours a thick viscous black with a dark tan head. Dies off quick.  S: Molasses, dark candied fruits - prunes and caramelized sugar. Faint boozy smell. Hints of roasted coffee.  T: Molasses and dark fruits, raisins, chocolate. Roasted almost smokey malts. Not as I sweet as I would have expected, compared to other RIS I have enjoyed. Slight sweetness is quickly overtaken by bitter and boozy. Ends quite bitter and boozy, almost bourbon.  M: Thick and viscous body. Very low carbonation, needs more to be enjoyable. Goes down slick.  D: Low carbonation, a little too bitter, and strong alcohol flavor. Good beer but not easy to drink.  Underimpressed.

A: Pours dark as night with a tan milky head that, after dissipating, leaves a nice tan film over the beer. Same colored lacing on the glass.  S: You get a ton of roasted malt from this. I can't smell the espresso, but the chocolate is evident. You can smell the alcohol a bit, too.  T: Almost tastes like a boozy chocolate milk at first. Finishes with a little bitterness from the roasted malts that were in the smell. A little bit of burn from the ABV.  M: Very creamy and smooth. There is a bit of carbonation, but it does nothing but enhance and deliver the creaminess.  D: You don't want to drink this quickly not just b/c of the high ABV, but b/c it tastes so damn good. I couldn't believe this was 10.5%. You can taste the booze, but I had no idea it was that high.

Bitter chocolate, and coffee up front followed by some licorice and sweet molasses in the middle and finishes off with some caramel and some alcohol. M.

The smell is not as strong as the taste, but you get chocolate, coffee and a little hops which increase as this one warms up. The taste is great- chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, hops all make their appearance known. Definite alcohol burn on the aftertaste, but it's a 10.5% beer, so I don't hold that against it. Still, I've had beers in this style w/ this ABV that hide their alcohol a little better. Really get a bitter coffee in the aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is smooth, but there's an edge to it as well.. Drinkibility is good, might be a little better if the alcohol was better masked. All in all though, this is a great beer.

287,1444,sisuspeed,3.7,"Bottled September 21st, 2009  Poured into a Cigar City snifter. Nice dark tan head on this one that fades to a thin film over a midnight black body.  The nose is filled with anise, coffee, chocolate and a bit of alcohol, though not too hot. The anise is the most dominant note, followed by roasty malts and dark chocolate. Quite sweet.  Thick, sweet, chocolate followed by some oak notes (more like lightly charred barrel), even though I'm pretty sure this beer never sees a barrel or oak chips. Anise notes are still present, but lighter than the nose. Sweet upfront, and then roasty, slightly charred, bitter dark malts on the finish. A decent RIS, but it seems a bit discombobulated at this age. I think I prefer it fresh compared to this roughly 1.5 year old bottle.  Mouthfeel is thick, slick and well carbonated for the style. Still has some heat at this age. The finish/aftertaste is just a bit too char-like for me, which knocks down the mouthfeel a notch.  Drinkability is above average. I'm enjoying the glass in front of me, but there are better RIS's out there. I would probably pick up a pack of Old Rasputin over this any day. However, I've heard from some people that this turns into a gem with some decent age on it, so I'll probably save my other 2009 bottle for another 3-5 years.

Head retention is decent and there is lacing to be had, but it is nothing extraordinary considering the style...  S - Chocolate, coffee, licorice and molasses. Also get a good dose of roasted malts in the scent...  T - Dark roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and a good dose of coffee. Ends on a smokey note with a little bit of heat. Surprised so many people are saying this one has alot of heat. Don't get that much myself. Aged this one a few months, but I feel like the abv is pretty well hidden...  M - Nice and viscous. Carbonation is on the moderate side...  D - For the price this is a solid RIS. Definitely something i'm looking foward to aging for a year or two...

287,1444,sweett3k,3.33,Thick Thick beer. My daughter asked me for a sip of my rootbeer float because of the thick creamy head it had.Then she smelt it and asked me if it was a chocolate and raisin milk shake. It has a nice thick coats your tongue feel with a choclate and rasin taste so my sweet pea nailed it. I am a hops man so I say it is O.K. I'll drink one of these at a time when I am in the mood for a thick stout. I just enjoy all the best beers in the world that South West Michigan brews and brings to my table. Now I need a Hopslam!,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,AlCaponeJunior,3.74,"Black and non-see thru. 1/2 finger head and light, spotty, lacing.  Smells nice. An alcoholic version of raisiny dark burnt malts.  Tastes pretty good. A variety of dark fruits, plus molasses and brown sugar, booze, and lovely roasted, almost burnt malts.  Thick and rich mouthfeel. Pretty smooth for the style. Pleasant.  Drinks average.

287,1444,cosmicevan,4,"got this one (from my wants) as extras on a few trades, so thanks 321jeff & gnemesis for your generosity! let me preface this by saying i'm a huge fan of both bell's beers (so far) and russian imperial stouts...so needless to say, i'm pretty pumped for the taste.  A - Poured from 12oz bottle into darkness snifter. Sludgey black with a head that built from the beer as it was pouring, I'm a big fan of beers that pour this way...just looks bada$$ in my opinion. As the head dissipated it left milkshake like cling on the glass. Pretty nice.  S - Roasted creamy milk hershey bar malts. Touch of camp fire in the background...kind of like a smoked milk stout.  T - Again roasty smokey malts...the nose is way more milk chocolate whereas the flavor is dominated by roastiness. the sweet milk flavor is in the background.  M - Rich, thick, creamy and full. Heavy like a gourmet coffee like dessert drink. Leaves a bit of a dry bitter tingle.  D - Another fine offering from Bells. I am pretty glad that I have another to drink...but I think I'll save it for another time. This is a good beer, but in the world of RIS, there are some mind boggling beers for fans of the style. Definitely worth checking out, but a bit too dry and bitter for me. The nose was the clear highlight.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TheSarge,4.41,"Pours well with a pitch black body, that shows off ruby red hues on the edge of my pint glass, and has a massive three finger thick head that somewhat looks like a chocolate milkshake... Very good retention by the way.  Big roasty malts give off a dark chocolate aroma with some coffee.  Taste wise the chocolate dominates the flavor totally upfront. In the end a darkly roasted coffee flavor devours the chocolaty flavor.  Feels very full in body, a bit powdery, and very warming in the end.  Overall a great stout and makes for a great desert beer pairs with Black Forest Cherry Cake I'd say.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells very much like molasses, dark chocolate and a hint of caramel.  Taste is very much of molasses. Lots of toffee, some coffee and chocolate. Very roasty.  Mouthfeel is quite nice. Thick and chewy and very flavorful.  One of these is enough for me in a night. I have had several but the abv does show after the second one. It is hidden but you will feel it kind of quickly. I often forget how good this beer is. It only gets smoother with age. Fresh it is a bit hot but with some time on it, it will taste phenomenal.

S: Roasty malts, coffee, chocolate, molasses, alcohol  T: I like the roasty malt flavor. I got that dark chocolate and caramels as well. Some mild hops too.  M: Coats the mouth nicely. Smooth with a nice bite at the end. Mild hop finish, surprisingly.  D: I enjoyed this brew. I would definitely have it again, but the ABV does get you. You can smell it and it is definitely there.

Thick, sticky rings of lacing glue themselves to the glass.  S: Dark chocolate, lots of creamy vanilla, mild coffee. Light herbal hops. Tight berry and plum darkfruit scents are buried beneath all of this.  T: Bold flavors of vanilla extract and soy sauce strike first, then transition into earthy, spicy tastes reminiscent of black licorice. Semi-sweet chocolate chips provide a respite from some of these harsher flavors. Herbal hops add flavor and balance. Brief flashes of blackberry and plum darkfruit create some depth. Finishes with coffee and lots of lingering smoke.  M: Thick, smooth, and mouth coating. Low carbonation. Alcohol is delightfully warming, but not at all boozy.  D: Decent. A sipper to be sure, but some of the flavors here clash a bit and hinder drinkability.  Notes: Not bad, but some of the flavors clash or seem harsh. Time in the cellar would probably work wonders and smooth out this brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It smells of rich, dark roasted malts with some bitter chocolate present. I love the flavors the Expedition presents. It's chocolatey, rich, has a good amount of coffee, and has this smokiness that reminds me of smoked wood chips. As far as mouthfeel is concerned, this is about as smooth as you could want for the style. It is very, very smooth and full in body. This is one of Bell's best brews hands down.

Dark tan head is present that is about 1 inch tall with very densely packed bubbles. (5.0)  S - Delicious roasted notes come up front. Dark malts and some great sweet and slightly bitter chocolate. The chocolate plays so well with the roasted notes that it almost smells of mocha. Yum. Nice coffee notes finish of the beer aroma. There is some slight caramel and some nice brown sugar notes as well (5.0)  T & M - Taste starts off with delicious dark roasted malt notes. Mixed coffee notes with some slight sweet milk chocolate and good bitter dark chocolate notes. Flavor for this beer is full and complex. Near perfection. The back end of the beer includes some slight boozy burn with some sweet notes that try to slightly balance those burnt roasted malt notes. There is a nice delicious bitter finish from the hops. Mouthfeel is full and rich and the beer is not too watery or to thick. Just right. (4.5) (4.5)  D - This beer is delicious and I am mad that I've passed it over time and time again.

Aroma is rum raisin, roasted malts, chocolate, a bit of alcohol.  Taste is incredibly complex. Smooth combination of dark chocolate, booze. Not super roasty, bit astringent on the tongue in the finish.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.

The smell is great featuring coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits, bourbon, and a wonderful smoky essence. The smell is a meal in itself and is very good.  The taste is on par with the smell in that it is intriguing and dark. The smokiness is a welcome addition and really sets expedition stout apart from other RIS's. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and smoke combine to exhibit the majority of the taste. Very nice.  The feel in the mouth is full with a soft effect. There is not much carbonation, so I believe this helps with the smooth texture.  I think the Bros. are a little off with the grade on this one.

T - Extremely rich, almost to the point of cloying. Rather boozy as well, 10.5% is quite obvious here. Some nice roasted flavors are present, but they are masked by the overbearing sweetness.

Appearance: This pours a thick mahogany color all the way through, with a surprisingly ruby and brown head that is creamy and huge. Solid retention, and lace splatters all over the glass.  Smell: Actually sort of a subdued aroma. Raisins, espresso, roasted malt, cocoa, and a bit of spicy hops.  Taste: The taste flows so well together it confounds me. It starts with light chocolate and espresso flavors, which slowly build over the sip, but they encounter anise, sweet molasses, and roasted malt, before finally encountering some spicy and lightly earthy hops. The ABV sneaks through toward the end, impressive consider it is 10.5%. The finish has more espresso and a bit of molasses. The lingering aftertaste is a coffee bitterness.  Mouthfeel: There is a syrupy quality to this, but damn is it silky smooth. I cannot remember ever having a beer with this kind of silky feel. Syrupy, chewy, and very full bodied.  Drinkability: With how insanely silky smooth this stout is, the taste could be bottle sludge and I would love it. Ok, maybe that's a little bit much, but the taste is damn solid.

Dark chocolate and burnt sugar fill in the back end along with a strong roast.  T: Surprisingly bitter with lots of roast and coffee notes, particularly on the back end. Dark chocolate, licorice, burnt sugar, and dark fruits make up the bulk of the flavor profile. The booze is a bit more subdued than I was expecting.

Molasses, oats, chocolate, and the alcohol. Sweet and rich scents.  Taste is a balance of big roast and big sweet flavors. Carbonation rests well on the rich body of the beer. Dry flavor, oaty and a dry, coffee and licorice finish. Roast enhances as it warms. Rich and complex sweetness to offset it, though.  Easy to drink and so rich that it completely hides its high abv.

T: Coffee, chocolate, heavy malts, and a strong taste of alcohol, which I think really clouds some of the depth. Heat sits right on the tip of the tongue, and in the back of the throat.  M - Thick and smooth.  D: The strong alcohol taste hits the drinkability for me. The tastes, smells, and feel is great, but the heat seems to muddy things up.  I bought a six pack of these bottles to try. After trying the first two I am definitely cellaring the other four. I'll try one three months from now and review again.

This stout is black as coal and kept an espresso-like crema on top throughout the duration.  Aromas of roasted malts and espresso. Not as overpowering as I would have expected. The taste more than makes up for it. The first thing I pick up on is a bitterness followed by rich coffee then sweet chocolate. The alcohol is not discernible in the aroma, but comes through in a delicious way by balancing the sweetness on the palate. It's a perfect combination between bitter and sweetness, with the bitterness winning the battle. I can feel my ears and belly warming. This is a sipping beer that coats the mouth with creamy goodness and moderate carbonation that tickles the tongue. Very drinkable for a Russian imperial stout.  I really like this beer.

287,1444,mjsheehan08,3.85,"Bell's expedition stout  Turns my snifter into a black-hole. Head is dense with a mocha tan one finger head that clings to the glass for safety. Lace paints the side of the glass, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon.   Nose is really fragrant. Rum, raisin, figs and other dark fruits start out the nose, and then some booze kicks in. There's also a sugarery sweetness that comes through from the malt, and I'm expecting a great malty brew.   Alot if dark fruit in the front, but the kind of dark fruit that is wrapped up in a big ball of molasses. Really a great blend of malts here. As it continues on, a shot of expresso comes through and lingers with you after you set your glass down. As I am about halfway through the 12 oz bottle, a little heat builds up at the top of my mouth and throat from the alcohol.   Feel is eh. For as full flavored as this beer is, I was expecting a little more body in it. It was kind of thin with little to no carbonation.

This settles to a single bubble layer, but leaves a decent blanket of lace on the glass.  Not like a typical stout (much less a RIS): No coffee or dark chocolate smells. This comes across as a creamy brown ale to the nose. Not bad, just not what I expected.  Potent alcohol bite with a chewy, patent malt bitterness. The flavor is closest to espresso. There's a decent dollop of hop bitterness in the swallow. The brew is very thick, like half and half cream. This is enhanced by a lower level of carbonation.

Appearance: Served in a small brandy snifter, comes with a toasty foamy head like a macchiato coffee in a piazza in Rome. Almost two fingers of head, brown and thick. Remarkable lacing.  Smell: Smells like men cologne, intense but dry. Also like a barn, pigs gamboling in their muddy, hay-covered pens. Horse poop, very earthy. A bit of bourbon-y booze at the end. Wet grass, rain.  Taste: Mud, coffee, roastiness. Some hard-to-pin flavors, uncommon for an Imperial stout. Sugar, chocolate shake, expensive chocolates. Espresso beans, smoke. A tad of vanilla. Good, but strange.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, full body, finishes dry and roasty and bitter. Smooth and creamy feel.

287,1444,Jadjunk,3.88,"""Here's a beer that thirsts for travel, holding up impressively under the rigors of any journey. At the same time, it's perfectly content to sit quietly in your cellar, aging and improving while you wait for the moment that seems perfectly appropriate for its consumption."" Brewed in the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Available in 12 oz. 6 packs and on draft as a fall imperial series seasonal release. I will be reviewing this immensely popular stout alongside two other vintages, 1 year aged (2013) and 2 years aged (2012).  Poured from a 12oz. bottle to a snifter. Served above 54º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Expedition pours a crisp foamy chocolate brown head over a nearly solid black body, moderately viscous. Retention is above average, lacing is light and streaked. 3.75  (Smell) Aromas of moderate roasted malt, chocolate malt and spicy licorice with a moderate sweetness. The potency is modest. 3.75  (Taste) Earthy roasted barley malt finishing with a strong driving roast with chocolate undertones. 4  (Mouthfeel) The texture is moderately viscous, sticky and slightly dry. The carbonation generates a soft frothiness for a smooth mouthfeel. The body is medium/heavy for the style, heavy overall. Balance is earthy bitter over sweet. Alcohol presence is moderate, and off characters are few to none. 4  (Overall) As a fresh stout, Expedition is quite enjoyable, roasty, sweet and viscous with a solid mouthfeel and simple yet deep flavor profile. There are other Russian Imperial Stouts out there that will very likely pump up the flavor variety, but Expedition will likely get the job done for most. 3.75  Bell's Brewery, Inc.'s Expedition Stout 3.89/5.00  Vintage Notes:  2013 (1 Year Aged): Pours a frothy creamy head of a similar head and body tone. The aroma shares similarities with the fresh batch with a mild creeping fruitiness. Lesser striking roast with a more solid balance with chocolate and finishing with a stronger spicy licorice. The texture is slightly smoother, slicker and oilier. Overall it's at least as enjoyable as the fresh batch if not better.  2012 (2 Years Aged): 2012 forms a creamy frothed head of a slightly darker tone over a jet black body. The nose continues the transition from heavy roast and sweetness to a more gradual balance with tart fruit subtleties coming in strong. The flavor is just as complex and balanced out as the 2013 batch, with a further reduced roast and chocolate balanced out with a mild acidic fruitiness. The texture continues the trend of smooth, slick and oily with a tame low carbonation for a very subtle soft frothiness. Another fine vintage, although I slightly prefer the 1 year over this vintage.  Recommended vintage: Fresh-2 years or older. Bells doesn't give a best by as per their website, so your patience is the limit as far as this beer is concerned.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,PeprSprYoFace,3.48,This is an aged bottle. About 2 years old. I've had it before but never reviewed it. Pulled from my cellar.  Appearance isn't much. Had to force a head as it was pouring out flat and like motor oil. A film stayed though after I poured it hard. Minimal lacing.  Aroma is weird. Lots of roastyness like a stout should be but there is a hint of either soy sauce or BBQ sauce. Not a ton of aroma either.  Taste is very roasty. Like a double roasty Old Rasputen. A little too roasty. A little bit of rasen and toasted sugar.  Mouthfeel is low on carb. Makes the beer too viscus.  Overall it's a little heavy and it's an ok beer.

I don't think I have ever seen a more gorgeous pour.  this nose is all sweet, but never too much. sweet chocolate, roasted malts and, maybe, maple syrup and molasses. some slight hop aromas round off the back end. taste brings out some vanilla, dark chocolate bitterness and a light touch touch of coffee. this is almost masterful the balance of flavors!  imo, this is what practically every stout should feel like. medium to thick and viscous. I love the almost chewy nature! neither syrupy nor hot, surprising due to high abv.  I'm probably ranking drinkability lower than I normally would. this isnt really a stout I would drink in the summertime like I normally would with some other stouts.  this is probably my go to, everyday, big stout in the cold months.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pretty hoppy for a stout as well. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy, thick and chewy; full-bodied. The drinkability is its' downfall. High abv, plus the chewiness and bold flavors make this a sipper for sure. Balance isn't Expedition's strong suit.  No doubt this is one of the better Imperial Stouts out there.

As I give my glass a swirl the viscosity is very thick and creeps slowly down the walls of my glass.  Smell:  Like opening a jar of molasses and maple syrup. There are loads of licorice, chocolate, slight ash, jagermeister, with absolutely no hop presence. In the back end I am pulling out black cherries, brownie mix, and some heat alcohol.  Taste:  Huge robust flavors, dark smoky chocolate, charred meat, raisins and burnt caramel. As I let my glass warm up a little bit more and more espresso flavors are coming out with faint earthy hops that have faded greatly. Very thick on the mouthfeel, mouse, creamy and very thick and long lasting finish that coasts your throat like cough syrup.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Elendinn,4.37,"Poured into a half-pint pilsner glass.  Thanks hellomisterp!  A - pitch black with a very miniscule amount of caramely, milk chocolate head. No lacing.  S - lots of dark chocolate up front, a bit of coffee, with some hoppy bitterness and bourbon in the backend.  T - chocolate, coffee, alcohol, bruleed sugar, spice, a bit of char-- finishes with a hoppy dryness and a lingering coffee flavor.  M - pretty carbonated, full-bodied, not syrupy -- not quite as smooth as I'd like.  D - a little too dry in the finish to be easily drinkable, but still very good. One bottle's plenty as the alcohol is rather noticeable. Pairs extremely well with pumpkin pie creme brulee. Could've used another year or two of age on it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bmohead,4.18,"From a bottle, poured into a pint glass. A hard pour produced a slow building, 2 finger mocha head. Heavy lacing follows this one down the side of the glass. Appears a deep black, with no light penetrating. Smell up front is of raisin and plum, then a deeper coffee and slightly chocolate aroma follows. Taste follows smell, with a roasty bitterness that is not at all overwhelming. Mouthfeel is quite thick and creamy, but finishes rather dry. Nice. Overall this is a fairly drinkable RIS, and one I will have again",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,orangesol,4.03,"Served on-tap at Al's of Hampden into a nonic pint.  A - Pours dark as can be with a thick, pillowy, one finger head, dissipating down to a thick film of head, leaving thick rings of lacing down the glass.  S - Rich, chocolatey, nose with a bit of lightly roasted dark malt. Chocolate is quite bitter but not to the point of being overpowering. A bit on the sweeter side compared to others in the style. More and more roast comes thru as it begins to warm.  T - Lots of dark, roasty, flavors in this one. Plenty of bitter chocolate up front giving way slowly to a mix of sweetness and rich roasty malt. Finish is very roasty that lingers long after consumption. Alcohol is ever present, unable to hide in the shadows for long, offering a warming sensation on finish. Not the best I have had but still very nice.  M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Fairly creamy feel with a very nice balance of flavors.  D - Fairly high. I really like this one a lot but it can become overpowering after the first glass. I could have one or two of these but that would be about all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rbrianforrester,3.78,"All in all, I liked this beer. It's not something I could sit down and drink all night, a bit too sweet for me. My bottle didn't produce as much head as I would like, and I felt the nose was lacking some of the characteristics I'd like to see in a stout.  That said, at 10.5% ABV this is definitely something I'd like to cellar and open next winter. Very probable that the sweetness would mellow and the chocolate and smoke would be more present.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mckeowbc,3.37,"A - Pours like used motor oil. Dark and think for a beer. Almost no head, what little there is is caramel colored. Beer leaves no lacing on the glass. S - Smell is sweet, hints of alcohol, caramel, coffee. T - I'm not wowed by the taste. It's sweet and the high alcohol was apparent and it leaves a sweet lingering taste on your tongue but it seems somewhat out of balance. Maybe too much alcohol. M - Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, but the lack of carbonation hurts this beer. It isn't creamy and it doesn't have the body of something like Great Divide's Yeti. D - The sweetness in this beer is out of balance and it's kind of cloying. After one I don't really want a second right away. It's an okay beer, but not a great beer.  I'm kinda disappointed by this beer. I'm a big fan of Bell's Two Hearted and this fell short for me. It's an okay stout, but it's lacking something. I'll finish off the 6-pack but I can't see buying another, especially at what it cost me. Also the 10.5% ABV makes this prohibitive for me to drink on a regular basis. It's not a session beer or weeknight with dinner beer and when I want something for a special occasion I want something more impressive than this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,masonjer,5,"Expedition stout! I have had this beer out of the bottle, on tap, on handpull, fresh, slightly aged, 10 years old and enjoyed it each time. This might be my favorite beer of all time. Pours pitch black, huge aroma of roast and bitter hops, chocolate and even a touch of bitter licorice. Taste is much the same, fills the mouth and coats the tongue. A great sipper that is complex and full of flavor. Good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,elgiacomo,4.8,"12oz bottle, batch 9459, bottled Nov 19, 2009. Over a year old. Served cellar temp in a New Belgium globe/snifter. I've enjoyed this a few times in its youth but wanted to wait to review til it was over a year old.  Pours black with a two finger brown head that leaves some pretty lacing and holds a small cap.  Aroma is rich roasted malts, chocolate, anise, coffee, vanilla, dark fruits of plums, figs, cherries, and raisins, some alcohol. Great strength.  Flavor is also very rich much like the aroma with chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, cherries, plums, figs, raisins, vanilla, there is still a noticeable alcohol bite/burn which is to be expected for the ABV but I thought it would have diminished more over a year's time. Still, can't really fault a big Imperial Stout for being a touch hot.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, medium carbonation.  A world-class Imperial Stout for sure, so very rich and decadent. Can't wait to try some of the 2010 batch.  EDIT: By FAR my favorite non-barrel aged Imperial Stout. Just can't get enough of this magical brew. Numerous batches, numerous years at a variety of ages and they're all fantastic in their own way. Age certainly benefits this one as well and I can't wait to try some extended aging well beyond 2 years on this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,AllFineThings,3.68,"Pours pretty dark, and has a half inch head which settles down to a wisp which lingers throughout.  Smells like a dark heavy licorice and chocolate, nutty malt.

Is a decent drinker and I could buy another single, but nothing mind blowing, just a decent stout from a good brewery.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,scottfrie,3.88,"12oz bottle into snifter. Bottled November 11, 2009. I forget which generous BA traded me this, but thank you.  A: A hard pour into my glass yielded about a finger of dense dark brown head under near-black liquid. A ton of small, soapy looking dots and strings of lacing were left down the glass. S: Reminds me of a chocolate malt, or a chocolate-vanilla milkshake. Strong creamy chocolate smell, different from the normal dark chocolate smell found in a lot of stouts. T: Follows the nose with a big creamy milk chocolate taste. The backside is sweet, and the finish has notes of dark fruits, molasses, and raisins. Aftertaste has notes blueberries and other berries. Aftertaste is actually pretty bitter as well. M: Very soft and smooth mouthfeel over a medium-full body with delicate carbonation. Finish is chewy and lingering. Alcohol is noticeable in the aftertaste, but it doesn't even warm my throat. D: Wonderful RIS. A bit rough in the finish, but I'm loving the mouthfeel. I could see this being even better if it were aged longer than 13 months.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A- Pitch black with a thin tan head that left some fuzzy lacing around the side. Carbonation seems low and that is how I like it. Seems a fairly thick body, again, how I like it.  S- Sweet roasty aroma, Vanilla?  T- Like it smells, sweet roasty flavor gives way to a even bitter roastiness in the finish. Very smooth with a wonderful chocolate flavor Thick mouthfeel. Warms the belly!  D- Pretty high. I love this style and I could drink these all day.

287,1444,wvsabbath,4.27,"Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Black as oil, large thick chocolate colored 3 inch foamy head  Smell - Could smell malts, coffee, barley and alcohol as i was pouring it. After sniffing got some chocolate, nuts, some spices and smoke  Taste - Shocked at how smooth and mild this was, but as i swallowed, it got stronger and the warm sensation on tounge was nice. Rich coffee, carmael, barley and choclate, with some spices really make this tastey. I really enjoy the long lasting kick this beer has.  Mouthfeel - Starts out pretty mild, then it kicks in with warmth on tounge, and a bold thick covering of the palette. Its rich and sweeth, bold and strong, a real rollercoaster for mouth. Very stout and bold, forget about tasting anything else until you eat or drink some water.  Drinkabilty - Its so strong, and at 10.5%, no more then 1-2 and done. But, you will love each drink espcially as this beer warms up, it really comes alive. Fantasic, made my top 10 RIS list for sure.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Eldalonde,5,"Pours pitch black with a dark brown full head. The smell just fills the room once the cap has been cracked...phenomenal. Rich aromas of bourbon, tobacco, sweet and bitter dark chocolate, copious amounts of coffee. There is also a bit of a hoppy bite in the aroma. The flavor is just spot on. Rich oily mouthfeel gives flavors that are close to the nose. Bitter roasted coffee and dark chocolate are the most accessible flavors with those heavily roasted malts coming across with such brilliance. Tobacco and toffee combine with molasses to give an incredible complexity. This beer also has that 'raw' edge that I love in stouts so much. The finish is long, dry, and lingering. This beer provides everything I look for in a RIS and leaves nothing undone. This is just wonderful",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BBP,4.65,"A- Pours a little less dark than the average RIS with a very good creamy full head, which holds decently, and superb lacing.  S- A very all around aroma. Hints of bitterness from the hops as well as coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and dark malts.  T- Everything you'd expect from an RIS. Begins with a semi-sweet chocolate taste and works it's way towards the roasted malt and hop bitterness quickly. After they play their parts the chocolate really comes into play. The aftertaste is loaded with it. It does a great job at bringing all of the flavors up to the front and making them big. There's a little bit of alcohol noticed in this one, but it's easy to look by with all of the other good flavor.  M- Very nice and full. Creamy feel and just a little dry and sticky in the finish. I've heard chewy being used for a mouthfeel description several times, and I think that this is the first one that is getting there.  D- Too drinkable. I only bought one of these which makes me a little sad, as I really have to drink this slower than I want to. It's good for very easy drinking without being watered down or having weak flavor. The 10.5% is there and easy to notice, but not overbearing and it didn't take away from the experience at all for me. I'll get a 6pk of this next time for sure rather than the single.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,afksports,4.23,"What a solid RIS! Thanks Emily for the bottle from Michigan, and thanks John for this in my Secret Santa box.  It pours rich and dark brown near black. Thick. There's nice carbonation that helps with lacing and actually stis on top which is nice for a Russian Imperial Stout. Smells a bit boozy, but the coffee and chocolate poke through. It tastes thick, rich, and sweet - like you want an RIS to. But it's well-composed and not overly watery or boozy. You only taste the good parts.  Drinking it is smooth through the palate from start to finish, and it's very easy to forget about the 10.5% alcohol by volume.

S: Dark fruit, molasses, cinnamon, cocoa, coffee, a bit of burnt malt, and perhaps a hit of piney hops, in that order. A good nose, but not overly potent.  T: Huge, sweet roasted chocolate body greets you up front, with dark fruit in the middle, ending on burnt cocoa and a slight embittering hops.

The color is a completely opaque black; no light passed through when I held it to my lamp. Three fingers of a thick, chocolate-tan head developed and dissipated slowly to leave trails along the glass, a spotted lacing, and a ring around the edge.  Smell: My first whiff was a mélange of roasted coffee, chocolate, and caramel; dark fruit (mostly plum, cherry, and raisins); molasses; black licorice; and brown sugar. Tinged with a spiced rum-like edge and slight hint of Belgian yeast (really?), the general aroma reminds me of dubbel.  Taste: The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy, which perfectly exemplifies the flavor experience that follows. Though subtle, the complexity is there: roasted coffee, chocolate, and a little caramel; brown sugar; molasses; the dark fruit plum, cherry, and raisin from the smell; and the spiced rum-like tingle of alcohol. Though it sounds crazy, I seriously think I taste a little bready, Belgian yeast. The roasted coffee leaves a nice, bitter aftertaste, which sometimes pushed my bitterness threshold as the pint warmed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Slight coffee like bitterness on the finish. Very little alcohol detection.  M - Full bodied, rich, thick, and chewy. Light carbonation which to me is perfect for an imperial stout.

287,1444,portia99,4.17,"12oz bottle (batch 10068) received as a great extra in my latest trade with jpmclaug. Thanks - this one is long overdue...poured into a Bruery tulip.  A - Pours thick and oily/syrupy looking coming out of the bottle. Pitch black without a hint of light allowed to pass thru it, even when held up to a light. A low dark mocha colored head fades quickly and leaves only a thin collar and a vague attempt at lacing on the glass.  S - Dark and roasty in the nose. Heavily scented with licorice that blends into coffee, bakers chocolate and a hint of burnt malt. Faint touches of caramel and vanilla round things out nicely.  T - Very bitter with a good dose of heavily kilned malt. They is a heavy char that lingers throughout the beer - burnt toast, charcoal, espresso beans and some accompanying acidity. The licorice in the aroma makes an equally strong showing in the flavor too. Dark fruits - prunes and a bit of raisin-like flavors creep into the mix. I really don't get much for hops - I think the scorched malt contributes plenty of bitterness and overwhelms whatever hops are here. Alcohol is practically non-existant in the flavor which is pretty impressive being a 10.5% beer.  M - A strong point for this beer. Body is full with a thick and viscous but oily slick feel. Carbonation is on the lower side giving barely a tingle, but works really well with the big body. Incredibly smooth...very nice.  D - Incredibly smooth...the intensely burnt character is a bit on the intense side and limits the drinkability a bit. Perhaps it just serves to slow me down a little bit in emptying this glass, which is probably a good thing considering the strength of this beer.

287,1444,CBlack85,4.43,"On tap at Duckworths in Charlotte. Served in a small chalice  The beer pours black as midnight, with no highlights at all. There is about one and a half fingers worth of dense dark tan head that slowly recedes leaving behind spotty lacing.  The aroma is big and roasty with lots of chocolate and coffee, and to a lesser degree dark fruits and even a bit of citrusy hops. The alcohol is present in the nose, but not as much as you would think at 10.5% ABV.  The flavor is much bigger than the aroma would lead you to believe. Loaded with caramel and chocolate, and accented by roasty grains and coffee, this beer screams desert. The dark fruitiness is just barely noticable. The hops are noticable, but not enough to get in the way of the sweet, desert like qualities of the beer. Full bodied and creamy with a very restrained carbonation. Finishes sweet with just a slight alcohol burn. Remarkably drinkable for the style and ABV.

Appearance: black as night, aggressive pour, brown head, good lacing  Nose: remarkable, and I have had some amazing wines in my time, but this is irresistible to a great nose. Dark rich chocolate, like 80% cacao, followed by rich, rum and brandy macerated raisins. Very few beers warrant savoring the nose for so long as this one. So rich, so indulgent, can the flavor measure up?  Taste: brandy, chocolate-covered raisins, smoke, this one is definitely in its prime. Mostly I get the rich brandy/rum flavors, which is a nice change from the usual roasted coffee IRS flavors. Only the Bell's Batch 7000 that I was fortunate enough to try bests this one in complexity.  Mouthfeel: A little thin, expected it to be more creamy.

Dark brown hues in the color, basically what I was expecting.  The smell has a very sweet, dried fruit smell. Not exactly raisin, maybe a bit of apricot? Not quite sure, but it does smell good.  My first sip I was blown away by this. It didn't smell anything like the way it tasted. The first surprise was how boozy this thing is. It tastes like it has been aged quite a while, but is a new batch. There is a delightful sweetness that lingers underneath the rum/bourbon taste about halfway through. The finish is an exceptional coffee taste that stays with you for quite some time.  In other words, it's not the best I've ever had but solid nonetheless.

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass an impenetrable black with a solid mocha head that left a thick, hearty lacing down the glass.  I must say that all I could pick up from the nose was molasses and licorice. For a RIS, I really was expecting some chocolate and coffee, but I got neither of these from the nose.  The flavor followed the nose almost exactly, but there was a hint of chocolate in the end that was lacking in the nose. Also picked up some hop bitterness at the end.  Yummy, creamy smooth feel. Not a ton of carbonation, but wasn't expecting this in a RIS. Hit the spot.  I was disappointed. I've not had this beer before and thought one that was aged a year (or more) might be better.

287,1444,nhindian,3.86,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip.  Batch 9971, bottled on September 13, 2010.  A - Pours a viscous, black motor oil black that culminates in a visually impressive, 3-fingered, dark mocha head. Retention is fantastic, and if it weren't for how slowly this beer drinks, it would last for more than half of the life of the beer. Body is pitch black, with only the slightest bit of chocolate highlights appearing at the bottom of the snifter, where it's at its thinnest. Lots of beautiful lacing as it drinks.  S - The nose is very sweet, full of malts and chocolate goodness. Also some appearances of thick molasses, raisins, and licorice. Throughout the whole nose there is a lot of alcohol presence. Overall a thick and heavy smell that is a bit intimidating.  T - First impression and all I can think of is that this is thick, chewy, and comes with wave after wave of flavor. The malts have a sweet, burnt flavor that contributes a nice, robust coffee flavor. Next comes some bittersweet chocolate and the dark fruits. These fruits help give a nice sugar characteristics that complements the high alcohol heat that this beer currently exhibits. A nice touch of hops at the end to complement the alcohol.  M - Mouthfeel is thick thick thick. And syrupy. Even after a few minutes between sips, all of the flavors still dance on the palate and there's a noticeable coating on the mouth. A long lasting bitterness in the finish resembling that of bittersweet baker's chocolate.  D - Drinkability is moderate. Even though this beer screams complexity, it's just a bit too much in terms of mouthfeel and alcohol. Being a little over 2 months old, it's still a bit hot for a RIS, so I can only assume the heat will dissipate after a few more months.

The alcohol slightly stings my nose. Paired with Thanksgiving dessert of apple pie and pumpkin pie. Tastes go well together. Slightly bitter with a taste of bittersweet dark chocolate. Coffee tones work into the mouth. I expected this to be a little tougher to drink with a 10% abv, but the alcohol is not overwhelming and drinks quite easily. Probably not a beer I would have more than two of though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

You have the sweet hitting the front of the tongue, the bitters on the back with hints of smoke. You can also taste sweet caramel and some coffee/toffee flavor.

287,1444,liamt07,4.68,"Bottle courtesy of TMoney2591, via the Support Your Team BIF. Thanks for this one, dude. Batch 9435, 341ml bottle into a snifter. Almost a year on this one at this point.  Pours a heavy and thick black with a short milk chocolate brown head, both thick and creamy. Tons of beautiful lace. So much in the nose in terms of dark fruits (figs, plums), licorice, molasses and a touch of milk chocolate. Molasses and dark fruits lead the charge on the tongue, and flows effortlessly into some bitter dark chocolate and dry coffee beans. Finishes slightly dry as a result, full and syrupy with a ton of body. Excellent mouthfeel and outstanding drinkability for the alcohol content. One of the best I've had, easily.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TheFightfan1,3.38,Poured into a snifter. Opague black with an extremely thick coca-cola colored heading. Stays around for a little white. Great lacing at first then turns flat.  Smell is more or so very ordinary. Heavy roasted aroma with a decent backing of chocolate. No heavy alcohol detected.  Taste is insanely hoppy. Something that caught me off guard for a stout. Black licorice and a heavy warming booziness that burns the tummy.Alcohol is not very well hidden.  Mouth is rough. A bit chewy and thick like molasses. Full bodied for sure but not too smooth.  A decent RIS. A bit overhyped IMO.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T - like motor oil, which isn't a bad thing for a beer that's going to only (in my opinion) get better as mellowed out a few yrs from now. The taste is really easy, but not easy to do a lot of. In my opinion at the point, I do want some more though. I really dig Expedition Stout...its more of me not being able to completely understand this beer with the great complexity it has at this time.

287,1444,DefenCorps,3.96,"Over the years, as my tastes evolved, I think this is one of the beers that's seen the greatest falloff in palatability to me. The first time I reviewed this, I gave it a 4.8 or 4.85. Batch 8728 from Sept 2008.  Jet black with a dense, very dark brown (almost Hunahpu's-like) that falls off to a ring, leaving a little lace. As always, very motor oil-like. The nose is intense. Licorice and soy are most noticeable, and there's dark chocolate, plenty of roasted malt with a firm, grainy bitterness on the back end. Molasses is also quite noticeable. Alcohol is *very* well hidden here. The palate is quite gargantuan. Massive waves of flavors roll through, with licorice and molasses being most noticeable. This is closer to the British interpretation, with the only sweetness present being roasty, bitter and grainy without much caramel or brown sugar, both which seem to be embraced by more brewers because they make for more drinkable beers. Thankfully, the soy that I picked up on the nose isn't as intense on the palate. Fresh, I remember this being pretty hoppy, but 2+years has given this time to mellow out and the hops have pretty much disappeared. Quite sweet without being cloying (in no small part, thanks to the lower levels of crystal malt?) A little ashy as well. Again, a touch of soy appears on the finish with some licorice. Full in body with soft carbonation, this beast is a treat on the palate, but ultimately, too intense to be drinkable in large quantities. Still, this is an intense sipper and a rewarding one.  **Original review dated 01-23-2008 03:11:43** 4.5/4.5/4.5/5/4.5 12oz bottle (Batch # 8145) poured into my Duvel tulip. Poured like motor oil  A: Jet black with a dense 1 1/2 finger head. Good retention and lacing  S: Roasted malts, dark chocolate and some hops right up front. Definite vanilla presence. Hints of alcohol. Excellent! As it warms up, a bitterness reminiscent of licorice is apparent.  T: Damn, this is one tasty beer. Massive chocolate, espresso up front with a wave of creamy vanilla. A smorgasbord of all flavors dark - roasted malt, molasses, licorice. The finish is mildly bitter, with a touch of hops and some licorice.  M: Soft, creamy and viscous. Perfect  D: This goes down easier than it should and i will pay for it if i have more than a couple. In any case, this one's near perfect.  Get it.

287,1444,Chaney,3.9,"This brew was a tough one to review, because I consider it one of the ""I just saw the light"" beers that turned me onto craft beers years ago. I still remember where I was the first time I tried this brew.  I had this on tap (and on tap for the first time!) at the new Pizza Paradiso in Old Town Alexandria.  A: Poured the blackest black of any black you will ever see! The almost two finger head (yikes!) was roughly the same color as black coffee, with about a tablespoon of milk. I didn't have any night vision goggles handy, so I couldn't see if there were any bubbles lurking or not.  S: Bitter, dark chocolate, roasted (almost charred) barley, and a hint of licorice.  T: Did I mention bitter chocolate? Jeez, this was one bitter mutha! As a matter of fact, this brew needed more sweetness to help balance some of that ""pure grain coffee ground"" quality that I found a bit offensive. Still, the thick body on this sucker should be studied by every novice craft brewer on the planet.  M: Thick, but not syrupy. The lacing was fairly subdued, considering the brew's octane level. The carbonation was good here, and I didn't find the booze offensive in the slightest (although others on BA definetely have).  D: It really pains me to no end to state this, but I feel there are at least five other Imperial Stouts in the immediate area that blow this out of the water. Still, I totally respect this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A decent amount of lacing stays behind just to remind you of where you began your experience.  Smell: A heavy blast of dark chocolate, holy sh_t! Need I say more, chocolate..  Taste: Big dark chocolate taste with some roastiness. A touch of molasses and coffee grounds.  Mouthfeel: Chewy with a heavy body and an oily feel. Alcohol warms things up in the middle which is not a surprise @ 10.5%. Not very smooth due to the heat. Could use a little more carbonation. Finishes bitter and dry.  Drinkability: This one's drinking damn good this time of year and with some age on it. Pretty good balance. Definitely worth putting some cellar time on it. It's just too hot for me when it's fresh.  **Update 12/15/11 I've been drinking some 08's right now and it's drinking like an A+ beer.

The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, alcohol, and molasses. The flavor ws of roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. The alcohol on it was very warming to say the least. Had a nice flavor and aroma to it. However, the aroma was very weak to start out but upon warming it was dominated by alcohol.

287,1444,Spider889,4.27,"Had on tap at Bodega. Probably the best offering there in recent memory.  This beer has about the best head retention I've seen outside of a Guinness Draught. Arrived with a solid 1 1/2 finger of head that receded to a 1/2 finger and remained that way the duration of the entire glass. When I finished my last sip, there was still a dollop of foam at the bottom of my glass. Left an extremely thick blanketing of lace wrapped around all sides of my glass. Black and heavy looking, the foam is the color of a dark coffee meringue, and has about the same consistency.  The smell didn't come through as much as the flavor and appearance did, but there's plenty of roasted malt aroma and faint hop bitterness in the nose.  This is a heavy and complex beer! You begin with loads of typical imperial stout flavors - roasted barley and bitter coffee. This leads into a creamy sweetness, reminiscent of their Double Cream Stout. This is followed by a nice spiciness lent by the hops, and it finishes very dry and bitter with earthy notes outlasting all else.  One of the chewiest beers I can remember, this is dry and sticky on the palate. A little hot but perfectly manageable. If the abv were any lower the ingredients would simply call the beer a pussy until it manned up and became stronger anyway. Drinkability is good, and is bumped up a notch because I will order this beer anytime it is available. Possibly my favorite Bell's offering at this point!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,JizackFH,4.17,"A - This one pours black with a thin brown head. There is no light able to pass through its body. The head left a bit of lacing as it fell.  S - It smells of roasted malts. There are also notes of coffee, chocolate, licorice, dark fruits, brown sugar, and a touch of alcohol. Smells great.  T - The chocolate and roasted malts come out first. Then, the flavors of molasses, licorice, dark fruits, and coffee come into play. There is also some hop and alcohol presence at the finish, which also has a bitterness to it.  M - This has a full body and low carbonation. It goes down nice and smooth, and also has a silky quality to it. There is also a warming sensation at the end of each drink.  D - I would say this is a pretty drinkable beer considering the ABV. It goes down nice and easy. This is a perfect beer for the colder months. This is a great RIS and I would recommend it to anyone.

(review from some old notes, I would love to try it again and see if the opinion sticks):  Looks pretty standard, dark brown, crappy head. Smell and taste wise,I thought that it was simply dominated by roasted dark malts and it lacked the depth (for an RIS). There were some sweet fig or date like flavors in there which (strangely) reminded me of a dopplebock. However, it also had a strong alcohol presence overall... more than it should have.  The mouth-feel was too thick and coupled with the ABV, it did not go down very smoothly. The beer was also really syrupy.

287,1444,devilben02,3.85,"Poured from the bottle, I could tell that this one was a shade of dark brown, but it was as dark as can be, with a medium-dark brown head that clung tenaciously to the side of the glass. The aroma is interestingly different from many other imperial stouts, with an up-front alcohol character that seems like a licorice liqueur along with some underlying sweetness. The flavor is roasy, sweet, and almost tangy, featuring the same licorice character found in the aroma, with complementing characteristics of charred firewood and bitter chocolate. Texturally, it is mouth-filling and resinous, but not to the point of being syrupy.  Overall, although it is not potently boozy, the flavors are dense (but I wouldn't characterize them as ""rich""), making it readily apparent that this beer is a force.

The smell is oddly more hoppy than it is roasted. There is a bit of coffee in the back but not strong in the slightest. It's still a good aroma, but the mixture of hop and rum is a weird. The flavor is has oak, smokey chipotle pepper, with some booze. The booze is really the only off-putting part about the flavor. It could do well with some aging.

287,1444,HitokiriNate85,3.51,"Batch 9384, bottled in October, 2009.  A - Pitch black with a nice mocha cap that is surprisingly sticking around and giving off some nice lace as it sits for a couple minutes.  S - Lots of a sort of dry roastiness upfront. Some dark chocolate, but not nearly enough to provide any sort of backbone to the roast. There's something that's kinda leafy to it. It doesn't really come across as hoppy, but more earthy.  T - Now things are starting to pull together a bit. The smell wasn't too impressive, but this is helping. Huge roastiness upfront, with some dark chocolate behind it. Slightly sharp, but not nearly as much as when fresh. There are some fruit flavors as well, but the roastiness just carries over and tinges everything. Alcohol is nicely hidden at this point, and probably the best aspect of aging. It could really use some sweetness to provide some backing to all the roast and bitterness(which is moderate).  MF - Easily the best aspect of the beer. Thick, chewy, and coating, with a slight burst of carbonation.  D - At 10.5%, Expedition carries itself really well, which is definitely a benefit of aging for one year. However, it's kind of disappointing because it doesn't coalesce into a total package.

287,1444,Star80,3.73,"Beer pours out a midnight black with a very dark brown head, some lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some stale hops. Yep, might be a great candidate for cellaring, but I wish I could get a fresh hoppy sample, i.e. no date code. Anyway, taste is dark bittersweet chocolate, some hints of coffee/espresso, and some bitter leaf hop. Has a decent carbonation so its, fairly smooth....but I really wish the hops were still present in their fruity/spiceyness doing their thing. The taste still has a nice interplay and balance between the roasted malts and the bittering hop. Sooo, as you can tell I am not a fan of cellaring cause the hops lose their flavor and have that weird faded hops taste, like this beer has. Funny, too the label suggests cellaring, no thanks. I will have to take a few points off because I have no idea the freshness of this or any Bell's beers, so the best category to adjust would have to be drinkability, although if were fresher it would easily rate a ""4"" or higher, very smooth and quite drinkable for 10.5% abv!

Chocolate chips, cocoa powder, big roasted and burnt malts, tangy dark fruits. Hints of tobacoo and molasses. Pleasing notes of blackberry liqueur. Pleasantly warming booziness.

I can certainly understand why this brew gets such high marks across the board, however I also think that a lot of brews within this style are comperable in look and aroma.  The look and aroma are as expected with the style, dark, minimal head, good full malt roast aroma.  The taste is malt and cocoa nib notes in the background. The carbonation is spot on and helps bring the subtle notes of roast to the front. This also makes this beer one of the best feeling brews I've ever had. Considering I had this out of a 12oz bottle shipped 1/2 way across the US, I would love to get to try this on draft sometime. Full, slightly coats but the carbonation keeps the weighy brew from sticking on the tounge or roof of the mouth.  The drinkability is very good. I have a hard time w/ this for this brew.

While it's impressive for the abv, even more so is the webbed lace that remains.  The aroma is mighty powerful. Situated amid a slight booziness are notes of burnt dark malts (first & foremost), molasses, prune, notions of cocoa, wisps of smoke & a few stray hints of hops. Warmth brings a musty smell; bread & yeast, though it becomes less apparent with more time.  The tastes starts out with a smooth, almost syrupy, chocolate presence that is tempered by bitterness courtesy of dark cocoa & roasted coffee. Some hop bite remains & is there for the assist. Enter the strong burnt flavors, which are prevalent till the end. Nips of tobacco & dark sugars. Hints of toasted dark bread toward the finish, though it's obscured by the more potent aspects.  For all the more inky Expedition Stout looked while being poured, the feel is so compounded exponentially. Obviously full bodied, it's chewy & monstrously viscous. Carbonation is spot-on for the heft of the beer, which keeps the carbonation from being over-ambitious. Alcohol is warming but very well-hidden. Somewhat dry finish with lots of lingering burnt flavors & some bitterness.  Considering my preferences for such a stout, everything about Expedition screams, ""hell yeah, drinkability."" It's all the more impressive how well hidden is the alcohol. I've enjoyed the six pack over many months & am slightly bummed they're now gone. I'll be getting more next release.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,GabrielM,3.89,"Poured into a snifter.  A - looks great except for some mysterious sediment, which is a little off-putting.  S - coffee, roasted malts, molasses, burnt brown sugar.  T - same as nose but with some definite alcohol heat. The coffee flavors are intense as is the molasses.  M - the alcohol heat and bitter espresso flavors are a little much on the palate right now. Carbonation is good.  D - I drink one or two now, but would much rather let them sit for a year or two.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gobzilla,4.07,"A: poured a dark as night black with a super thin brown head and left hardly any lacing sticking to the glass.  S: I definitely was greeted by roasted chocolate malts, some oat grains, slight smokey, booze, and some cookie notes as well; very nice nose.  T/M: there was actually some hop bitterness on the backend but upfront the chocolate roasted malts were dominate alongside toffee, slight licorice, coffee, and a touch of bourbon. The brew was full inbody with a low amount of carbonation which had a roasty, sweet, slight astringent, boozy, hoppy bitter, and silky finish.  D: it drank pretty good considering the ABV but I'm not much of a hoppy RIS type of dude I would much rather stick to the ones that aren't as bitter on the finish.

A hard pour yielded a nice tan head, sitting atop a viscous, black concoction. Decent lacing.  S: I smell a lot of chocolate, some dark fruit, and alcohol.  T: The chocolate is the most noticeable aspect of this beer, but it brings a lot of complex flavors with it, including plum and raisin. Comes through with a warming kick at the end. Delicious.  M: Medium-full bodied with an ideal amount of carbonation. Smooth and coats the mouth.  D: The 10.50% ABV is not hidden here. I can't imagine drinking more than one of these in a sitting. This isn't untypical for the style though.  Overall, a good stout.

Good amount of dark chocolate, cocoa, and roasted coffee. Dried fruits of prunes, dates, cherries. A bit of the alcohol is detected as well.  Good taste of dark chocolate and milk chocolate, espresso, a bit of roasted malts midway with a sweet chocolate brownie taste. A bit of bitterness along with a touch of coffee is in the finish.

Appearance: Midnight black and very thick on the pour. One finger dark mocha brown head with decent retention. Recedes to a very thing lacing.  Aroma: Dark cocoa, brownies, coffee and some toffee notes all blend together very nicely. Very balanced. A touch of booze in the nose as well. Very complex and well intergrated.  Taste: A full spectrum of chocolate flavors are the first note that really asserts itself. Dark chocolate, fudge, and brownies all appear at some level. Some nice backing notes of caramel, vanilla, and dark fruit. I'm not getting any hop notes (a sign of its age perhaps), but that is fine as they are not missed. Really complex and well balanced.  Mouthfeel: A very full bodied stout with a nice, creamy mouthfeel. Fits well for the style.  Drinkability: The ABV makes this impossible to drink a ton of, but I find myself wanting more and more.  Overall, definitely among my favorite stouts. With almost a year on this, it is pretty amazing. really decadent and tasty. Highly recommended. I wish it was sold anywhere near where I live.

287,1444,optimistictour,4.73,"My profile says my favorite style is Russian Imperial Stout so the first statement in this review should be an admission that I'm *somewhat* partial to the style. That being said, I'm a critical cartographer of this fertile land with a discerning nose (and tongue) for what makes an RIS really stand tall.  First of all, the Expedition Stout looks devastating. It's oubliette dark, conjuring a head not halfway towards normal light froth coloring, both bigger and lacier than I'd expect given the hearty ABV. Basically this is the strongest beer I've witnessed with such visual poetry.  It smells like there's a lot more going on than in your average RIS. It's true. This one hints at a faint licorice and/or candied raisin veneer, framed in a darker than dark chocolate sea. There's a sweet whiff of danger here, too.  Hitting my tongue, it's at once everything an RIS should be and ingratiatingly different. There's more sweetness and less coffee than expected; a thicker body and more buzziness help convey the idiosyncratic blend. This beer lives up to its name with tastes lifted across the globe, and will, with all certainty, leave its distinctive mark on the drinker.  Sure the 10.5% abv reveals itself at times, flickering out like the sun behind some strange delicious clouds... but it's almost always wrapped in the sweetness or dark chocolate bath of the flavor. Even acknowledging the slightly confrontational physical nature of the beer, it's one of the best I've ever had. A true adventure, something to challenge and savor and absolutely relish.  Maybe you won't drink more than 2 of these in any one sitting, but it'll always be worth the trip when you choose to do so.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,domtronzero,3.92,"A - Clear deep dark brown, almost opaque. Average lasting, big mocha head with lots of lacing.  S - Dark fruits, caramel and sweet malts. Chocolate and a little roast. Light alcohol.  F/M - Bitter baker's chocolate with toffee, caramel and sweet bready malts. Medium high bitterness accentuated by the dark malts. Dry finish with a lingering chocolaty roasty aftertaste. Moderate carbonation, light alcoholic warmth.  D - Okay, but this is a pretty big beer. Thick and rich makes it quite challenging to put down more than a bottle of this in a single sitting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Naugros,4.05,"Really dark with one of the darkest heads I've ever seen on a beer...it was almost brown. However, it's one of the thinnest heads I've seen on a stout and the retention is not all that great.  The smell took me aback as it smelled like a Belgian triple at first more than a stout, but the usual cast of characters are hiding in the back. Super malty with raisins in the forefront with coffee bitterness and chocolate behind and a touch of bourbon...okay more than a touch...a bit more.  It tastes more like a stout than a Belgian double though and that makes me smile. The coffee comes to the front and a chalky chocolate follows it, adding to a standard RIP mouthfeel. The alcohol does make an appearance in the finish supplying bourbon-like notes. The raisins detected in the nose are gone. Very yummy!  If you're used to drinking RIPs, you'll love this example once you start to drink it. There's nothing special to make it stand out, but it is a solid effort",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,herman77,3.88,"Wanted to try this fresh after having it on aged 3 years on tap a few weeks back. This was bottled 9/13/10.  A: Black with a big dark brown, very tight and compact head. Pretty good lacing.  S: Sweet dark fruits, dark cherries, dates and rum soaked raisins. Roasted malt and a little bit of dark chocolate. I think I like the nose on this one slightly better than the aged one I had on tap. Smells more vibrant, but still a little weak for what it is.  T: Roasted malt with dark chocolate covered dark cherries and dates. Rum soaked raisins and bold earthy bitter hops come through as well. Slight acidic char near the finish. Not as chocolaty and a shorter finish when this is fresh. Warming alcohol burn in the finish. A touch on the hot side.  M: Full bodied, thick and smooth. Moderate carbonation, it would feel even smoother and creamy if the carbonation was a tad lower. Great mouthfeel though.  D: A sipper. You can really feel the 10.5% on this one. Its a good cold winter night beer. This really mellows and rounds out with age.

287,1444,bigdonniebrasco,4.1,2009 edition: vigorous pour produces HUGE mocha head pure black contents that brings on the burnt motor oil references.  Hoppy nose with lots of chocolate and roasty malts. A hint of almost mint/menthol. This may just be the hops though.  Matches up well with the nose. A bit more deep toasted malt and dark chocolate. Kiss of coffee bean. Really huge hop profile. Toasty finish.  Very smooth and lightly creamy. The body just feels spot on for what a RIS should have.  Great all around RIS.

Lots of lacing on the sides of the glass - this beer looks a bit like something you'd brew in a cauldron. Smells mainly of alcohol and molasses underpinned by hints of coffee and cacao - very nice.  Roasted malt is the primary flavor component on first sip - it's a little overpowering, and tastes somewhat over-roasted to the point of being burnt. Unfortunately this flavor gets more prominent as the beer warms. There's some alcoholic heat here too, but it's less than I expected, and I actually quite like it. Not as sweet as I expected either. The mouthfeel is very full-bodied, viscous, and a bit syrupy. There's moderate carbonation, and it helps keep my mouth feeling refreshed between sips.  A solid beer overall, but the burnt-grain taste definitely hurts this brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very small head upon the pour, which dissipates very quickly to a light lacing on the sides of the glass.  Sweet on the front, with a dark chocolate/coffee raisiny flavored finish. This is a good one from Bell's, but one that I will only have once in a while and one at a sitting. Not a beer I want to drink all night, but definitely a beer I want to savor and slowly enjoy.

287,1444,tewaris,4.26,"Note: Taste score raised to 4 and drinkability to 4.5 after a different sampling of a 13 months old bottle that was noticeably smoother. Also, a tart dry fruit character (prunes, cherry) was noted in this tasting.  ---  Bell's Expedition Stout Bell's Brewery, Inc. Russian Imperial Stout 10.5% ABV 1.11 OG IBUs? 12 oz bottle, bottled December 18, 2009, poured into a Bell's tulip.  Appearance 5/5 Pours black and opaque with a big, dark brown head that takes its own sweet time to build up. The head recedes to a thin collar eventually and leaves an excellent lacing. On a first glance, it's impossible to comment on clarity but after the head has receded, clear dark brown edges can be seen. Inviting!  Aroma 4/5 This is the smell of a big badass stout. Hard to describe fully because there are a lot of things going on here. Reeks of molasses and malts initially. Then chocolate, and possibly, coffee and vanilla. Booze, especially when it gets warm.  Taste 3.5/5 Big, dark malts surrounded by hoppy bitterness that stays until the long finish. There's booze in finish, noticeable even 9 months after bottling. Then plenty of rich aftertaste which is so roasty, that it seems burnt at times. Everything about this beer is big, but too rough and oddly bitter.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Silky, but not cloying over one bottle, which is the ideal amount to drink for this beer. Low carbonation, which is perfect for this beast. Body is big, as expected.  Drinkability 4/5 I have had the cask conditioned version too, and that was one of the best beer experiences I have had. Noticeably better on cask. Still, the drinkability is alright.

Somewhat muted nose comprised of light roasts, sweet malts, hint of licorice, and oaky vanilla.  BAM! this hits the palette strong. All of the notes composed in the Nose are here and in much stronger force, but a nice alcohol comes in and warms you up in a way that makes you want to sip all night long. All the flavors are melded wonderfully, ive had other batches that were either brand new fresh or not as refined as this one, but this bottle really surprised me even tough i've had this beer dozens of times.  mouthfeel is, as you guessed from the appearance, just as thick as you could hope for. Inky & Creamy. Also, the low-moderate carbination is a positive for me personally. I don't need bubbles in my bourbon, and i don't in my Stouts either.  I've drank a few of these before, and about 2.5 is the safe limit, for me.

I've been a member here since 2008 but never really participated in reviewing or forums. I used the site to check reviews and ratings of the beers around me only. Last year my brother and his fiancee drove to Iowa to spend time with their friends. There first stop was Kalamazoo... Never heard of Bell's before and off they went. Two weeks later I here of Bell's (specifically Expedition stout and Hopslam) and am floored remembering that my brother drove through there not even a week prior... been trying to hunt them down ever since, and here we are now, a year later and finally sucess. Thanks Marcus!  A- Thick black syrupy pour producing a dense two finger dark khaki head. Quickly recedes to a faint ring. Lacing is wonderful.  S- Dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, medium roast coffee, cream, brown sugar, vanilla, faint earth and wood, slight bourbon.  T- Bitter coffee, molasses, vanilla, smoke taste reminds me of cedar grilling on the bbq. Slight cherry taste. Alcohol is nowhere to be found in the taste.  M- Creamy and chewy. Sticky sweet on the lips after each sip. Very little carbonation (I know this was a point deduction for the Bro's but I kinda like it in this case, there is so much going on flavor wise that I didn't realize it until my third or fourth sip.  D- It's quite cold today so I decided itm was going to be a stout and barleywine day. So far this is keeping me quite warm. Come winter i could see this being a staple.

287,1444,goldbot,3.96,"Bottled on 11/19/2009. Reviewed on 8/18/2010.  Pours pitch black with thin, brown head. The foam fades quickly, leaving bits of lace on the surface of the beer.  Roasty, malty aroma. Hints of chocolate and coffee, but malt, bread, and roasted flavors really dominate. Lacks depth in a way compared to many of its peers.  Sweet milk chocolate flavor followed by a smooth malt and sweet caramel. Fresh roasted coffee beans linger on the palate and provide a nice bitterness.  Full bodied, on the sweet side which works well with the strong malt and coffee flavors. Reminiscent of a mocha dessert drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,harpus,4.47,"A: pours like used motor oil, one of the thickest imperial stouts out there (behind Hunahpus/Mashal Zhukov), with a nice dark head, decent retention and lacing  S: huge notes of dark chocolate and oats up front, compared to the fresh version, this is much more mellow and chocolatey...personally I think this smells better now than before  T: deep rich roasted notes up front with tons of chocolate, a little licorice and molasses, some coffee, everything is big and bold but nicely in balance. The finish is long and leaves a hint of roastieness on the palate. Wow, 2 years have done wonders for this brew.  MF: thick, velvety viscous, low carbonation  D: I have always loved Expo, but have never tried it at this age. I must say that I am amazed by how much chocolate character comes through now. Delicious.  I have tried this beer three times. The second time was in a stout tasting and this was pick #1 out of 13 different stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A tight tiny bubbled lacing  S - Chocolate coffee and to a lesser degree hops.  T - Dark chocolate, coffee, hints of dark fruit and roasted malt with a latent alcohol warming and piney hops flavor  M - Big bodied thick molten flow engulfs the palate.  D - A great first or last brew but I don't consider it a session brew, as to be expected for an Impy Stout.

287,1444,axeman9182,3.21,"12oz bottle (cheers to IdrinkGas), warmed slightly from fridge temperature and poured into my Chimay goblet.  The beer pours absolute black, with a two finger dark coffee head. It quickly dissipates halfway and just sits at a finger in height for a long time. A little bit more lacing would have garnered Expedition Stout a five. The smell is of dark chocolate (good) and some black licorice (not as much). As long as the flavor pulls more from the former than the latter I think I'll still dig it. Well, I got my wish, but this beer is *very* rough around the edges. The dark chocolate overpowers the licorice, after an opening dollop of caramel, but there's a harsh graininess and a bitterness that I want to say comes from hops, but there's no accompanying hop flavor. I was ready to score the flavor lower, but it did smooth out some as the beer hit room temperatureIt's a shame too, because the mouthfeel on this beer is great, a chewy and luxurious body and carbonation that's just a tiny bit too high for my taste. The poor taste really hurts drinkability, but the beer gets some credit for effectively masking any alcohol. I'd never had Bell's beer that was less than top notch until Expedition Stout, but I'm glad I got to try and I'd like to try this beer with a few years on it to see if it smooths out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SFLpunk,4.31,"Thanks to chubbyswans for this one!  12oz brown glass pry-top bottle. Code on back label translates to bottle Nov 11, 2009.  Appearance: Pours a thick, gloopy blacker-than-black black with huge amounts of cascading brown head - looks like a nitro beer poured wrong.  Nose: Bitter chocolate, espresso, tree bark, toffee, molasses and vanilla. Big nose.  Palate: HUGE! Thick with dense tiny bubbles. Lots of smokiness on the palate and something like iodine. It actuallly tastes a lot like a blended Scotch...Lots of black malt, dark roast coffee, espresso grounds, tobacco and licorice.  Notes: One of the most complex behemoths out there.

287,1444,FreshHawk,4.65,"A - Dark black color with an average sized, creamy, smooth, cafe colored head. Nice retention leaving a beautiful ring of lace.  S - Dark and milk chocolate are abound in the aroma. Cream with touches of coffee. Hints of dark fruit toward the end.  T - Similar to the nose. Loads of chocolate (sweet and dark) along with a fair amount of cream and caramel. Some espresso but not much. Touches of date and fig. A faint whisper of alcohol shows up on the finish.  M - Full body and creamy. Average to low carbonation. Very smooth and velvety.  D - Wonderful beer to sip on. Alcohol is mellow and the flavors meld together well. Not complex but bold.  Notes: The batch was in the 8,000s (from 2009) and it was consumed 06/13/11. Much better with a couple of years on it. Alcohol and the harsh flavors have mellowed and made this a perfect beer to sit back and sip on. I'll have to get some to cellar now. ___  A - Deep dark black with a large creamy, frothy, thick, meringue-like, dark tan head. Really good retention that settles into a nice thick, creamy lace.  S - Good amount of chocolate and some black coffee. Roasted malt is very prominent. Some dark fruit tartness and hints of licorice and soy aroma. Some caramel as well. Tartness is fairly strong (for the style).  T - Rich and fairly complex flavors. Dark chocolate and roasted malt are the strongest flavors. Has some burnt sugar and coffee flavors as well. Some dark fruit, although none really stand out much. Also a bit of anise and soy. The tartness in the aroma is also there and mixes along with some roasted bitterness. Alcohol heat is also present. Usually the tartness is toward the beginning of the taste with more of the chocolate and burnt flavors and alcohol mid to finish of the sip. Hints of citrus hops in there.  M - Full thick feel with a good amount of carbonation. Very thick and creamy feel.  D - A little much to want to drink a lot or to have it on a regular basis. Very much a sipper, with the alcohol heat and slight tartness and bitterness making it a bit less drinkable. Wasn't quite as balanced as I would have liked.  Notes: Batch 9554, consumed 08/28/10. Decent stout, but not my favorite. Seemed just a little off balanced. Not bad overall and I would drink it again, but for the price there are others that are better. The score is for the cellared 3 year offering not this one that was consumed fairly fresh.

287,1444,Phelps,4.12,"Batch 9512, which means it was bottled in December 2009. An 8-month-aged stout? Don't mind if I do!  Looks: Stygian. The liquid creeps from the bottle an inky, syrupy, dense, all-encompassing black. Absolutely ZERO light penetration. The head is such a late arrival I'd almost given up hope of it even showing up to this party, but when it comes, it does so in full form: nearly 1.5 fingers of thick, sticky mahogany. While it leaves rather quickly, it doesn't go quietly; great expanses of unbroken lace grip the sides of the glass.  Smells: like all the best parts of roasted malt. Espresso, dark chocolate, molasses, tree bark, steak, a tinge of vanilla and charred oak. If I didn't know any better, I'd say this was wood-aged.  Tastes: charred. These malt must have been roasted to within an inch of their lives, as the flavor of twice-burnt toast overloads the palate. While the liquid sits in the mouth, the beer's raw and woodsy -- I get a lot of pine, oak and fruity dates. After the swallow, waves of flavors shift and transition like the hues of the Wizard of Oz's horse of a different color. First there's vanilla, then brown sugar, then port, then peanut skins, then plums, then rum, and a satisfying finish of bitter espresso and charcoal rounds it all out. Each sip evokes a different experience.  Feels: treacly. Full-bodied and nearly syrupy, with a perfectly subtle carbonation. The alcohol is warming but not distracting -- impressive when you're wrangling in nearly 11 percent.  Drinks: below the radar. If Expedition Stout was a limited release, I can almost guarantee it would be a far more popular beer. As it is, it's one of the better RISes out there, and easily accessible -- an dangerous combination.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rembrant,4.75,"visual....1 finger light brown head,lots of lacing,opaque and very dark brown-near black  aroma,initial impression...grape? Then a real nice dark chocolate,toasty malt blends,hops. As it warms and airs some coffee + licorice appear. rather aromatic and complex.  Taste? Oh My...  10% abv? They did a slick job hiding it.. The coffee,chocolate,step up...along with that hint of grape juice. Big Malts all tastefully balanced and deep. Hops?...there but not very upfront,besides the mouthfeel the taste is rich, a meal in a mug,with the main brown food groups fullfilled...chocol;ate,coffee,ale, though Bell's pulled of the illusion without adding coffee or chocolate...or that fresh concord grape juice. That makes it quite the crafty gem at weaving in flavors and illusions of flavors in a fashion where like a good bluegrass band, each steps up for his solo.  Mouth...pretty fine,about perfect. The foam is tasty,the brew is tasty,everything has body,the texture shows substance and the flavor really lasts  Drinkable? At 10%,WTF? get a buddy to drive you or somebody to put you to bed. This puppy is WAY too drinkable. Were it cheaper and about 7% I'd do these a lot.  I like me some chunky stouts, but I'm all for that perfect balance as much as the ""Blow Me Away"" intensity.

S - Dark roasted malt, coffee, licorice and raisins.  T - Very rich and sweet with a ton of dark roasted malt character, cocoa powder and coffee. Getting a bit of an alcohol burn towards the end, but it's not unpleasant.  M - Rich and creamy with low carbonation. Very dry finish, almost as if my mouths been coated with cocoa powder.  D - Very solid drinkability, I could see sipping on one or two of these throughout the night.

287,1444,Dreadnaught33,4.26,"Poured into a snifter, I believe its about 6 months old or so. I've always been a fan of this beer, figured it's time to put in a review, also my first one on BA.  A- Pours out dark as night, with a great finger of brown cola colored head, just what I like to see in a big stout like this.  S- First off, the smell is definitely there, but not as big as I'd thought i'd be for a beer of this magnitude. Perhaps its the snifter not doing it justice. The smell is of huge roast/malt character, smoke, licorice, and that molasses/sweet caramalized smell that you fear if you are smelling an IPA (meant its gone bad). Good thing its not a hoppy beer!  T- A huge malted roast flavor. Huge! I love that taste in a stout. Must be black malt. There is a beautiful straight black coffee taste at the back of the flavor. That burned, smoky flavor thats present in the smell is definitely in the flavor as well. Personally, I really dig smoky flavor. Not sweet at all, a dry flicker probably from the hops and a nice lingering finish from the alcohol, which for 10.5% is balanced very nicely. Awesome. I am defintely the opposite of a super taster, I always go for the beers with a lot going on.  M- I'd say on a scale of 10, this has about a 8.5/9 out of 10 on thickness in this catagory. Very creamy and beautiful. Again that lingering alcohol flavor is beautiful.  D- This is a beer perfect for winter or late fall, but also enjoyable any time of year of course. Awesome roast meant for warming. I love this, in my opinion one of the best big stouts thats somewhat easy to find in most areas these days. Highly recommended, surprised at some of the lower ratings on this one.

There are some notes of booze and brown sugar, maybe dark fruits, but one thing for sure, not a lot of hops.  T: A very rich roasted malt flavor with notes of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. A somewhat complex taste with hints of some booze. Also, a long lasting and bitterness aftertaste that is on the pleasant side of things. Exactly how I imagine a stout to taste.

A thick, hearty malt aroma of chocolate and roasted malts along with a touch of breadiness; hops are minimal but give off dark fruit like black cherry. A sweet stickiness greets my tongue and then I pick up chocolate and hints of toffee but there's a greater bready, biscuity, almost coffee-like roasted sensation that gives this thick beer a hearty finish.

287,1444,Lauthaha,3.52,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer mug.  Appearance: Opaque black with perhaps a tinge of brown to it. Outstanding burned-tan head, about one finger thick.  Smell: Exciting! Black licorice and/or sun-dried raisins up front. A little bit of a coffee edge follows, rounded out with a toasty alcohol vibe. Not a lot of hop action in the scent, let's see if that changes at all...  Taste: Ultra, ultra sweet. Not balanced out with bitterness. As much as I want to give this rave reviews, it's not a good example of my favorite style of beer. Minutes later, still tasting sugars within it. The coffee flavor is minimal, but the malt tone is HEAVY. No hops though, just as the nose determined.  Mouthfeel: It's like a beer Vesuvius in my mouth. You know the reaction that you get from mixing baking soda and vinegar? Same thing here. A small sip ballooned into a piledriver of foam in my mouth. The maltiness gets more handleable as the beer warms a bit. Set apart from the taste, the mouthfeel is decent.  Drinkability: Eh, it's not a BAD beer by any means. But it's a little heavy to call a ""usual"" and a little strong to drink more than two or three of at any given time. So-so drinkability.  Decent beer. Definitely a sipper.

The coffee notes blend well with the chocolate. Alcohol is present, but well tamed. This stout is more bitter then sweet, and darker in the grain than most.  MF/D: The mouthfeel is full and creamy, the drink can improve with age (this bottle is about a year old or so...batch 8728).  Overall, I really enjoy expedition stout.

Pretty well carbonated, quite thick and oily and the alcohol and carb leave a bit of stinging on the tongue. Much better with some warming.

287,1444,Durge,4.47,"Another nice find at Stub & Herb's in Minneapolis, MN, which I was glad to have had prior to dipping into the even more prized ""Black Note"" version - this black beauty shows an opaque brown/black with a good head of brown foam and decent lacing. The nose picks up seaweed malt and decidedly herbal hops. Very nice and not over the top at all. The flavor jumps out a surprising licorice which now makes a lot of sense from the aroma but I missed it I guess. But this is a licorice malt flavor fest, intense yet mellow enough to neutralize the 10.5 ABV just enough for some drinkabiity. No session beer, but it's hard to slow down too much once you grab a hold of this taste wallop. There is that herbal hop idea that adds a real nice highlight to this full bodied, viscous feeling stout. Wow. I do enjoy this. Very little carbonation as you might expect from a cask but this holds together very well. I start to pick up some berry notes and definitely some coffee and marshmallow sweetness as my palate adjusts to the dominant licorice malt theme. Intense but not a ""choker"".

The head is reasonably retained. No visible carbonation; although any carbonation present could be easily hidden by the opacity of the brew.  S- The aroma is comprised of stewed and roasted malts; very malt-forward... with a light & zesty hop aroma, reminiscent of citrus zest. No esters- simple and elegant.  T- An exceptionally bold flavor. The roasted malt peeks though- intensely roasty- and then the hops kick-in with a piney intense bitterness that lingers on the tongue substantially after each sip. There's also a little bit of booziness that hits you partway through as well. While it's bold and dynamic, it's almost overboard...  M- A full chewy body, with texture presumed to be from unattenuated sugar. Very soft carbonation and a moderate astringency. Just a touch of heat from the EtOH. Stellar mouthfeel.

287,1444,Chico1985,3.93,"Thanks to cbutova for sharing this. Batch 9512, which according to Bell's website, means this is from 12/18/09.  Pours black with a pretty excellent brown head. Retains pretty well and leaves nice lacing, stains the glass.  Smell is roasted malt, licorice, booze.  Taste is a solid, no frills imperial stout. Mostly just roasted malt, booze, and dark burnt coffee. A little bit of smoke and anise. Gets more boozy as it goes on but not really a bother. Very dense in the same way as Stone IRS, though not nearly as complex.  Mouthfeel is oily and a little hot, low carbonation. Pretty much an imperial stout in the rawest form, which I like, it is a tad harsh but good. I bet this would be nice to age.  ** more notes - 1/5/14** - Great beer to revisit. Opened a bottle I bought in Philly or NY a while back, the batch # is 10105, I believe this to be from 2010 sometime. Huge+robust but smoothed out with maybe some slight oxidation. Roasty dark chocolate licorice all the way. Less alcohol than I remember.

The lacing coats the glass as it fades.  The smell is sweet; cocoa, burnt molasses, roasted malts. Theres a faint, but easily noticeable on a big sniff, presence of coffee/espresso. Bitterness seems to be from roasted coffee alone from what I can tell.  Noticeably bitter and faintly tart/sour at first...boozy. Reminds me of a milder Mephistopheles stout...only drinkable! Midway through, a nice coffee taste shown through. It's fairly roasted and/or burnt in the malt department.  This is very thick, rich, and on the chewy side. Very fine RIS stats.  Very tasty, but noticeably boozy. 1 satisfies just fine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,cavedave,4.13,"Thanks to Jager68 for this thick wonderful beer. Consumed 7/31/10  Pours an opaque black topped by a brownish beige one finger head that slowly relaxes to a nice topper. Lots of resin and lace on the glass.  Smell is not that strong for a big beer, full of a variety of sweet maltiness, roasted, caramel, molasses, chocolate, rounded off by hints of tart yeast and a slight bitter edge.  Taste is like the nose, not super complex, but the flavors are extremely clean and bright. Alcohol is there but just a background warmth to it. The chocolate isn't as bitter as in some stouts, and the roasted notes aren't over the top char. The bitter in the finish is just right to balance the sweet.  Very thick, very viscous, perhaps a bit too much carb., and perhaps a finish needing a bit more more complexity. Very silky.  Due to the silky nature, and simple deliciousness this baby goes down very easily.  Impression: One of a crop of truly exceptional American RIS that I hope to try again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,buschbeer,3.83,"Batch 9512  I poured into my glass to maybe a half inch of brown head. This beer is dark to say the least. The is no light coming through this beast. The aroma is chocolate, molasses, and some alcohol. The taste is black coffee and I get a fairly strong alcohol presence. That's about it. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. I like that. I think this beer is a little hot yet. I am going to sit on my remaining bottles for at least a year and give this review an update. If the alcohol mellows out this could be a great beer.  revisited 6/13/2012  The alcohol has faded. I get some dark chocolate on the nose and in taste. I get some almost anise taste. Very thick and tons of flavor. Not sure if I like the flavor now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SamuelJackson45,4.04,First time I pour this beer. I can't believe how dark it is. I put it by the light and still couldn't see the shine threw the glass.

And will drink it again.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Khazadum,4.24,"The last of my blind beer series. Thank you so much Prufrock... you've been the best! This was the icing on the cake. Twelve ounce bottle poured into a brandy snifter for immediate enjoyment.  Vision What a fighter! I poured 3/4 of it into the glass like I normally do and NO carbonation appeared. Literally it was a placid lake of ebony swirling about in its vesicle. I had to swirl the contents of the bottle and viciously splash it down into the center to create a chaos of head. Unfortunately the color of raw, fresh clay bubbles disappeared to a speckle of itself ( is it raw umber? Is that the color I've heard before? ).  The carbonation is non-existent, but that is not to say there isn't a skin of promise. . There are no bubbles to be found. The liquid itself is black like many I've had this week. I may sound like a broken record but it is motor oil again. It is darkness.. midnight in the cornfields with storm clouds blocking out anything that could even be remotely mistaken as illumination.  Bouquet Sweet momma. Oh my goodness with whip cream on top. Do I dare say I detect the overwhelming deliciousness that is bourbon? I can't help myself but keep taking deep breaths over and over again. There also is the faintness of raisins and bitter chocolate ( of course, that means a dark chocolate ;) ).  Layered gently behind all of these scrumptious aromas is the tell tale signs of alcohol. This medicinal spear is wrapped with comforting flavors. I always think of ethanol as an awful smell... something to be abhorred and hidden deep within the dank confines of your brew. It is this beer that helps me realize once again how it can be properly used.  Flavor Profile I hope I do it honor with my description. The very moments it hits my taste buds I find myself remarkable confused. It is quickly salty while being sweet at the same time. I find myself thinking of childhood candies and random Chinese restaurants performing the same feats. It is by all means welcome from me. That sugary nature reminds me deeply of bourbon barrel aged beers to a T. It is almost like a freshly barrel aged ( &lt;12 month aging ) bourbon stout. The strong sweetness hides many flavors that further sipping slowly unravel.  There is a smokiness that hits milliseconds after the sweetness arrives but lingers momentarily. It can't hold its composition into the finish and finds itself dwindling away as the coolness dissipates from the tip of my tongue. That same smokiness is playing buddy system with the alcohol trident. I can feel it limping along causing pin pricks of recognition as it too flutters away into my gullet.  All of this was beheld upon quick cursory sips and dissection. If I take things further, swish it around my mouth and allow it to linger and roam as it pleases I am slapped with milk chocolate. It isn't just bitter chocolate, but creamy and smooth melted Hershey's. Whats that you say? You want the bitterness that is possible with some chocolate? Look no further! The finish of this beer screams prickly dark chocolate tree( I wish such a thing existed...). I rub the roof of my mouth with my tongue and lap up any residual flavors I can find. Shockingly, it is a raisin, chocolate amalgam of yum. Tasty!  I had to steal this last bit... my tasting partner has put it perfectly. This beer is the trail mix of beers. Salty, sweet, nutty, and above all unique.  Oral Sensations This creamy beer harbors absolutely little in the world of carbonation. However, it reminds me of chocolate milk shakes without the thickness. It has that smooth nature with big flavors constantly erupting. It never had any lacing to really speak of and this still shocks me. It lingers long after on all my oral surfaces to an extreme point. This beer is the thickest of the six beers to date, and yet I still consider it liquid feathers. I find myself desiring some carbonation here, but that is the only fault I can find.  Conclusions I'm steaming... the alcohol in this beverage is a skyscraper compared to yesterdays. I got a quarter of the way through it, and my extremities were feeling a bit damp with sweat. I truly enjoy a monster of a beer like the next person, but I'm beginning to think that this may be a problem. Great flavors, amazing body, and top notch nose are only as good as long as they all last.  As soon as that carbonation is mostly gone, all three of these aspects begin to falter and fall down upon one another. Thank goodness I had only a quarter of the beer left ( too much time writing, not enough drinking! ), but I noticed that the alcohol becomes the dominant player above anything else in both flavor and nose. There needs to be more carbonation in this beverage to prolong its life. If I had just gulped down the last bit I would have been more impressed than I am right now. Don't get me wrong, still impressed, but the amazement is beginning to dwindle.  I would drink this beer again in a heartbeat ( and only one for an evening ).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Hints of wood and booze.  T- huge dark roasted malts and burnt brown sugar. 92 percent dark chocolate and brownie batter. Port soaked dark fruits and berries. Tons of dark roasted coffee and some burt wood.  M- full bodied but by not means to thick with a lite carb. Slick and syrupy on the palate. Heat on the finish big time. And this has two years on it.

287,1444,ryno09,3.61,Pours pitch black with one of the darker brown heads I have seen. The finger head quickly fades do to the high ABV. Carbonation seems a little on the high side of the style.  On the aroma I get a ton of roasted malts along with dark fruits and molasses. Some alcohol present as well. On the palate I get a ton of chocolate - something I didn't get from the aroma. Up front some of the dark fruits are present before the chocolate takes over leaving a lingering somewhat sweet finish,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ToasterChef,4.3,"Poured from a 1+ year old cellar temperature bottle into a Delerium Tremens snifter. It is an opaque, dark brown liquid with a small head of tan foam and bubbles. I can see bubbles popping on top of the foam. There is no light penetration. Swirling the beer produces a bit of a film and a very good foam coating. The head has now settles to just a skim of foam. It's a pretty beer, but I've seen better looking RISes. I can smell roasted malts, alcohol, caramel and some chocolate. Even with all of these candy scents, it doesn't smell overly sweet. This is a tasty stout. Creamy milk chocolate and a few dark roasted malts greet my tongue as soon as I sip. Some bitterness moves in aa I swallow. It's akin to dark chocolate, but not quite the same. Prehaps the year of aging has made the bitterness harder to identify? Also present in the finish and moreso in the aftertaste is a bit of alcohol burn. It is hot, but not exclusively in an alcoholic sense; it's also ever so slightly peppery. The alcohol flavors aren't too strong, but are certainly present. I imagine that the year of age has mellowed this flavor out as well. After swallowing, I can run my tongue over my mouth and pick up more chocolate and alcohol flavors. The Expedition leaves behind a persistent coat. It has lower levels of carbonation and is full-bodied. For a 10%+ ABV stout, this beer is pretty drinkable. I wouldn't have more than one bottle of this, but each swallow goes down very well. If you can get your hands on some of this, I would highly recommend putting a few bottles in your cellar for a year or more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,djmichaelk,3.56,"12oz bottle (courtesy of Bucwild, thanks Dave!) into a snifter.  A - Very black, with just a bit of maroon edging when held to the light. Only a rumor of head, with the slightest of rings around the glass. Wisps of what might be considered lacing remain on the glass. If it had legs it'd be great looking.  S - When freshly poured, it definitely reminds me of cheerios, along with some caramelized sugar. Some dark fruits -- figs and raisins -- linger in the background. And a hint of the alcohol to come.  T - Again with that bready, cheerio-ey, oat taste, which is very pleasant to me. Not much in the way of the sweetness that I got in the nose, but there is a lactic cherry flavor lurking somewhere in there (which doesn't bother me in the slightest). I usually expect coffee flavors in this style, but I'm not getting any of that here. The roastiness is very much in the back.  M - Thick and viscous, like motor oil. As it should be. The strong flavors stick around for a while after each sip. The high alcohol gives it a dryness that keeps it from being cloying.  D - Over 10% abv shows in this one. It doesn't burn, but it makes itself known early on. More than one of these and you're probably done for the afternoon (although it's morning for me -- hey, don't judge me!).  O - Nice one from Bell's. In my search for the perfect morning beer, this might not quite fit the bill, but it definitely makes an impression.

287,1444,DovaliHops,4.52,"Pours Very thick black with a thick, frothy, espresso colored head that hangs around for a bit. I got about 2 inches of head pouring this thing aggressively. Very nice! The smell is very interesting. I'm getting a lot of chocolate and coffee...but the smell that stand out the most is BREAD. I'm getting a nose full of fresh baked bread when I smell this thing. More than any other bread-smelling beer I've tasted. The taste just blows me away. I don't get any bread in the taste. I get immediate bitterness, followed my such sweet chocolate it's insane. A lot of espresso/coffee in the aftertaste. This beer reminds me a lot of a cafe mocha. No matter how good this beer tastes, I still can't get over how much this smelled like fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is wonderful. Very thick and full-bodies. Ohhhh...just burped and there's that bread taste. Very interesting. This beer is for sure a sipper.

287,1444,Shakesbeere,4.5,"Pours like engine oil -- very deliciously dark appearance. Aroma is of alcohol and black licorice with a hint of soy. Very thick palate. Flavor is initially of smooth black licorice and sweet malt, then transforms into bitter hops and roasted molasses -- though not burnt. Some notes of earthy coffee and chocolate coruscate through to a dry, dark finish. Very thick, very viscous, very creamy, and very complex. A balanced taste between bitter hops and dark characters delivers a spectacular brew with a phenomenal finish. Spectacular! Think Dark City epiphany and dénouement.

The finish is long and leaves a hint of roastieness on the palate. Wow, 2 years have done wonders for this brew.

It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a short finger of tan foam that fades fairly quickly. The nose comprises plenty o' roasted malts, dark wheat, chocolate syrup, nutmeg, and a surprising dose of rye bread. A general sweetness pervades. The taste darkens the proceedings, roasting some of the sweet notes and replacing the rye bread with a leather-like character. Some light prune notes gurgle up from th bottom, but don't pool all that much. Something's missing here, but I can't quite put my finger on it. The body is fairly hefty, with a heavy light carbonation and a borderline chewy feel. Overall, a solid RIS, but I've had better, even among regularly available offerings.

Almost liquor like in aroma. Very strong. Pretty sweet. Its a little bit of a turnoff.  Very full bodied stout, finishes brighter than it starts. Pretty roasty, kind of bourbony in the mouthfeel and forward flavors. Its a big big beer. I didn't realize the ABV on this until I started writing this review foolishly. I will pay for my ignorance for sure. Its pretty drinkable especially if I'm grading on a curve. I had the 2005 recently, also a gift from Huhzubendah and it had began to turn.

The actual beer is black as night - there is absolutely no light coming through. This beer is pretty, no one around it.  Aroma: Coffee is right up front, followed by toasted malts, dark chocolate and a definitely perceivable alcohol note  Taste/Mouthfeel: Lots of coffee, maybe some dried fruits and toasted malts on the back side. You can taste the liquor for sure - this is definitely not a low ABV beer and you can taste it right up front. The mouthfeel is chewy and thick - very full in the mouth, which I like in a stout.  Drinkability: This one is definitely a sipper. It's nice and rich and tasty, but there's no way you could - or should - put down more than 1 or 2 12oz bottles of this baby.

Pretty sweet in the nose, chocolaty...bits of ripe dark fruit with molasses and licorice, complex, a bit sweet, but nice...The 2 years of cellaring seems to have improved the nose, much more sweet, subtle and smooth than a fresher Vintage I had a few weeks back...no trace of roast or bitterness/hops in the nose...

The high abv is nice sometimes, but it seems to interfere with my enjoyment of the beer. Coffee taste is nice, but it's a bit off here, less of a good coffee, and more of an old stale coffee taste, with a bit of chocolate background. It's very chewy, and most certainly a sipper.

Rich & malty, but not overly sweet. Still has a good bitterness to it from the roasted profile, but toned down at this point. The age has really smoothed out its edges.

The mouth feel is slick, smooth and oh so full. Malt dominates the aroma: roasted malt, dark chocolate, raisin, vanilla and sweet alcohol are all present. There are enough hops in the taste to balance, but they aren't a true player in the beer beyond grounding its more eccentric tendencies. Candied plum, chocolate, vanilla, bitter toast and a bit of rum round out the flavor notes for me.

287,1444,bevdaddy,4.08,"Poured in to a TK Tulip from batch 9512. picked up on a recent trip to Philly.  A - Pours out nice and black. In contrast to other reviews, I got a good almost two finger head on this beer which was a nice brown cocoa color.  S - Big whiff of roasted malts. Im getting equal parts chocolate and coffee. there may be a bit of caramel in there too. and i'm also getting some alcohol.  T - the first thing that comes to mind is the balance. all the bigger flavors (coffee, chocolate, some sweetness, roasted malt in general) are all even. nothing stands out too much. and i mean that in a good way. not detecting the hops until i concentrate - so a bit less than other reviews. definite ""hotness"" present but in a comforting way (less alcohol than i expected after smelling it).  M - medium to low carbonation. but not an issue. feels full and creamy - i really like the mouthfeel on this beer for this style.  D - i like the beer alot, but don't see myself having more than one. for the 10.5 ABV, they did a great job on smoothness, but it is a very rich beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,alkemy,4.13,"This thing is uber dark brown with a dark tan head. There is absolutely no light getting through this one. Just pouring this gives a sense of its thickness. Alcohol is immediately apparent in the nose. It's also got some fig, prune, dates, and cherry rounding things out with vanilla and coffee. Dark fruits at first, which I really like. The finish is strong with espresso and leaves a taste somewhat akin to burnt toast. I also get bitter chocolate in the taste that was missing in the smell. Sure, the alcohol is present, but not as noticeable as in the scent. I love the rich, silky smooth feel. The level of carbonation matches up quite well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Dark roasted malts - dark chocolate with some coffee. Some dark fruit and hops are present in the background. Seems to be a slight alcohol nose in the background as well, but that may be the hops.  T - Dark roasted malts with some dark fruit and sweet molasses. Not an overwhelming coffee or chocolate taste but but both are present in a more subdued fashion. Bitter hops are present as well that become more and more prominent as I continue to drink the beer. There is also a nice licorice taste in the background. A little bit hot.  M - Thick & silky. A perfect mouth feel for an imperial stout. Moderate carbonation.  D - A very nice RIS.

Poured solidly black with just under an inch of light brown head that had decent retention and lacing.  The aroma full and rich, lots of roasted and toasted scents. The flavors were also well executed examples of the style. In addition to the roasted flavors there was a nice little hop tang at the end.  The body was typically full, rich and tongue coating. Drinkability will vary depending on your personal taste for the style, 1 of these at a time is usually enough for me, YMMV.  Overall, a very good example of the style and better than some much more highly hyped versions.

About an inch of brown head and great big clingy lace rings all the way down, with decent retention. Inky creamy texture, very smooth with little carbonation disturbance. Pitch black with no light penetration.  Smell is very malty in a bakers chocolate and coffee, with a hint of swetness and creamy milk. Aromas though are a bit subdued as compared to the bottle.  Taste is filled with large amounts of chocolate and a little coffee as well as bitter grains and plenty of malt. This here is amlt bomb indeed. Through the finish a dry sweeping of earthy hops.

287,1444,Arbitrator,4.7,"Lightly chilled bottle into a glass (2009 vintage).  A: Pours a pitch black in the snifter, totally impenetrable. The head is an attractive inch of fluffy mocha-colored foam, with impressive retention for the ABV. Minutes later, it has collapsed onto thick clumps of scattered bubbles on top of the brew, with a heavy collar that deposits some lace.  S: Smoke, earth, and roasted grain jumps out at me; it reminds me of a cigar in some respects. Plenty of bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee, with some anise, caramel, and toffee lurking beneath.  T: The taste progression is interesting. Where I usually find the malts jump out first, this one leads the way with smoke, earth, roasted grain, and some small citrus hop character. It remains smoky and earthy even as bittersweet chocolate develops in the flavor. I find anise throughout. One of my favorite non-barrel aged imperial stouts; the combination of smoke, roasted grain, and anise just does something for me.  M: Creamy, full-bodied. Very fine bubbles that pepper the tongue slightly and assist in the slight warming effect from the alcohol.  D: It's hard to criticize this imperial stout. I find the smoke unusual, but it works somehow. I'm really impressed by this beer.  ---  I also had a 2008 vintage. I'd give that a 4.5 / 4.5 / 5.0 / 4.5 / 4.5 (overall 4.7 / A+). I definitely prefer this with some age.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A touch of lacing occurs around the glass. The beer is very vicious. S- Quite nice smell. Dark fruits and toffee. Notes of dry dark chocolate. Sweet malt comes through also. T- A bit more toasty for RIS then sweet. The dark fruits don't seem to come forward as much as they do in the nose. A decent amount of Dark Chocolate. The flavor doesn't have much more than that. M- Carbonation is a touch low for this beer. Coasts the tongue well. No heat from the alcohol. Thick beer overall. Slight astringency towards the end. O- This beer after a few sips started to let me down. The complexity falls way short with just roasted barley taste and a touch of dark chocolate.

287,1444,CarolinaCardinals,4.43,"Original Review 5-9-2010 Picked up a couple of singles in late February from AJ's in Scottsdale for $3.19. From batch 9512 which was bottled on 12-18-09. Beer poured black as night with a nice tan head that is leaving lacing behind - 4.0. Nose is mocha, roasted malts, floral hops-4.5. Taste is a wonderful combination of roasted malts, mocha, chocolate, and bittering hops-4.5. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, perfectly smooth, creamy with good viscosity-5.0. Drinkability is amazingly great, even at a young age - 5.0. The abv is very well hidden. I think I will save the other bottle for awhile to see how well it ages! Awesome beer, glad to see Bell's in Arizona!  Review of Batch 11503 dated 10-22-2012 on 7-11-2018. Beer poured black as night with a solid tan head that has some good hang time - 4.25. Nose is roasty with some cocoa, very nice - 4.25. Taste is dry cocoa, heavy roasted malts, balanced nicely by an ample hopping. - 4.5. Mouthfeel is full, smooth, with each sip extremely satisfying - 4.5. Overall this is still one of my favorite imperial stouts in which i try to get a sixer every year - 4.5. My aging consists of putting this on the side shelf of my beer fridge at roughly 43 - 45 degrees. Hops are definitely mellower, tasting mighty fine - glad i have one more bottle from 2012!  Batch 12348 from 9-25-13 sampled 9-21-18. Down to my last two bottles from this batch. Tasting mighty fine still. Catching some licorice this time around (likely due to the Deschutes Fruit Fight IPA i just had). The consistency from year to year amazes me!

287,1444,Spiekerbox,4.48,"A- Pours jet black, with a brown, mocha looking head that is a little larger than i expected and slowly goes down, leaving brown lacing on the glass.  S- smell is of toasty malts, with a slight hop presence and a bit of a chocolate scent, not as strong as i was expecting, but still a good smelling beer  T- really a lot going on here, lots of roasted malt with a chocolate, coffee bitterness. Also has some of the taste of dark fruits, with hops making an appearance. Also taste brewers licorice.  M- Low carbonation with a big beer body, creamy texture that makes the flavors linger in your mouth long after taking a drink.  D- for the ABV it is way too easy to drink, the alcohol presence never really makes itself know, still a big beer that takes a while to drink but it sure is enjoyable for the entire time you are drinking it",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,AdamMY,4.07,"The color is nice and dark, and poured a half centemeter of dirty head which has been fading very slowly.  Smells a bit hoppy, and bitter like a really strong coffee, and bitter chocolate.  The taste is strong, lots of roasted malt. The taste is borderline burnt but oh so strong, and there are actually slight hints of a grapefruit note hidden in there.  The finish is great, lots of caramelized sugars, but again borderline burnt.  But the mouth feel is impeccable, so smooth and creamy.  The drink ability is way to good for a beer with this High of an ABV.

287,1444,Mooseky,3.68,"Deep and dark, with an impatient head.  This beer is rich in flavor with so much potential hiding behind the harsh alcohol taste. At first there are little bits of coffee and tobacco, then the alcohol hits... after the fact, there is a lingering taste of fig/ prune/ raisen that hangs around to coat my mouth.  I have no intention of having another anytime soon, but I look forward to reviewing the rest of the six-pack over an incremental period of time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Jeffo,3.2,"Found this at the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a small medium-looking mocha colored head that quickly recedes to a ring and a really faint wisp. Not as thick as expected coming out of the bottle. Jet black body in the glass with no carbonation evident. A ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass. Average at best here.  SMELL: Mild nose of roasted malts, milk chocolate and smoked meat. I pick up some smoked salami even. Very different and interesting, but not bold enough to stand out.  TASTE: Much bigger than the nose. Roasted malts, smoked malts, and licorice. Strong flavors of smoked and salted salami. Finish is bitter-sweet, with caramel and bitter coffee notes, along side some hints of smoked meat again. Aftertaste is bolder and lingers nicely on the palate. An odd flavor that I'm not quite sure about, but an intrigued enough to continue  PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Starts out a little airy, but as it sits, it thickens up a bit. Eventually turns relative creamy smooth on the palate, and goes down fine finishing slightly dry. Fine for the style.  OVERALL: Not sure what to think about this one. The appearance and nose were average for the style, but the addition of some kind of smoked salami was odd yet enticing at the same time. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I enjoyed it enough that I'd buy it again if I came across it again. Definitely not a standard Imperial Stout offering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,markskar,4.64,"There isn't much of a head to this brew, but it pours pitch black--no light escapes. It'd be nice if it were a bit more carbonated, both visually and in the nose, but it's quite fine the way it is.  The aroma is dark roasted coffee, with a dark, dried fruit aroma (I always found the ""dark fruit"" descriptor to be vague--but I'm thinking of how raisins would smell if they smelled the way the taste). Nice chocolate notes in the nose too.  Flavor is much the same as the aroma--coffee, chocolate, and dark fruits. I am absolutely floored by the flavor. I would rate the taste up there with any world class RIS I've ever had.  Mouthfeel is mostly smooth and creamy, but just a bit sticky. The mild stickiness allows the wonderful flavors to linger on the tongue though--in a very pleasant way.  Extremely drinkable for a brew over 10% abv. Goes down nice and easy, with a flavor that just begs for more.

287,1444,Thur123,3.36,"This beer is black, very dark and cannot be seen through. Little to no head of a toffee color. A mellow blended malt is the smell. Not overpowering in any way. Chocolate, earthiness and a surprising lack of smoke or char smell.  Glug glug glug  The flavor is big. Bitter chocolate with roasted bread. The backend of the flavor is heavy with herbal hop bitterness and the aforementioned char. Heavy viscous mouth feel. Good but actually kind of messy to me, and sitting on one of these would most likely make this better.

S: Lots of roasted malts along with some bitter dark chocolate, a little bit of dried dark fruit and a hint of hops. As it warms, there is a small bit of smoke and ash. T: Black patent and roasted malt combined with what appears to be chocolate malt lead to a burnt sugar flavor. Hints of dark caramel and dried fruits along with a definite hops presence in the background. A spot of alcohol heat as well. This ends up being more ""charred"" than I remember, but I still love it. M: Oily, astrigent, very low carbonation, makes for a creamy, rich mouthfeel. D: A definite sipping beer, very good for desert. I don't want to drink one of these often, but I am always happy when I do. This is an excellent example of the style  12oz bottle in Sam Adam's glass (thanks SA) reviewed 9/28/07 bottle # 7817 (bottled 2/1/07)  A: Pours a completely black color, no light comes though. Not much of a head, what there is looks like caramel, very dark brown. S: As it is poured, a wave of sweetness hits the nose. Smells like dried fruit, maybe cherries. T: Bitter sweetness, like dried cherries dipped in a very dark chocolate. There is a hint of alcohol warmth in the back, just the right amount. M: Does not come across as thick or cloying. It is clearly a big beer but it goes down very smoothly D: WOW, this is a great dessert beer. Just the right amount of alcohol heat combined with a nicely balanced sweet/bitter.

287,1444,Soilworker,4.65,"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz bottle, fresh no aging, into a standard stout/pint glass. Bottle has a batch number on it...this is batch number: 9554.  A: Pitch black with zero light shining through even with a strong flashlight put up to the glass. Nice caramel colored head that is slow to dissipate and the bubbles are very fine. The liquid seems to almost stain the glass.  S: Dominated by an intense and strong blast of fig, plum, and raisin. Bittersweet chocolate, dark roasted malts, and perhaps a hint of roasted coffee provided the backboard for the dark fruit character. There are also small hints of alcohol and vanilla that hit the nose from time to time. Very rich, savory, and bold.  T: Starts off with pretty much an explosion of burnt and roasted malts. I was expecting a start with some wateriness to it but that is definitely not the case. After the blast of malt this settles down to a pleasant bittersweet chocolate flavor with vanilla and espresso notes playing along with it. Somewhat sweet at the beginning. This then fades towards the end to a flavor characterized by burnt coffee and roasted malts and some oaky wood notes that seem to be somewhat charred. The finish holds on the burnt and roasted malt character and there is plenty of bitterness here which seem to be primarily hoppy in nature but have an interesting bitter burnt malt aspect. As you drink it, especially when you start there is a lovely warming feeling in both your mouth but primary in the throat all the way down the stomach. A very impressive taste profile!!!  M: Amazing!!! As you swirl it through your mouth it is smooth and creamy and very bold with a little bit a zing on the tongue from the carbonation. As oily and creamy as the beer is at first, the finish definitely feels dry.  D: Did I mention this was a bold beer? The flavor profile is huge and definitely takes the right palate to enjoy this one. I would love to drink this all night and I would, but this is a beer for sipping if I ever tasted one. The ABV is pretty aggressive but not terribly noticeable during the taste but I'm sure if you managed to get a few of these down it would start to catch up to you.  Overall I loved this beer. I especially liked the rich, bold taste and creamy mouthfeel. This was my first Expedition ever and I can definitely see how aging this one would be a smart move since this would most likely tone down the bitterness a bit. I definitely plan on buying a second or third six pack just for aging past 2yrs.

Plenty of chocolate and coffee but neither of the bitter variety. Light hints of smoked malt can be picked up as it warms.  The flavor is rich roast malt with intense black coffee. Light chocolate tones come through as well. The hops are very present in every sip. Some molasses and moderate smokiness is present as well.  Full thick body. Little to no carbonation.

287,1444,Flashsp2,4.63,"Bell's Expedition Stout into snifter (roughly 1yr old)  Pours from the bottle a deep brown, but in the glass it sits a depth of black that can only be described as moonless midnight. On top of this sits a medium tan head that looks more reminiscent of a whole wheat pancake, dense with tiny bubbles. Spots of lace stick after a few drink. The head leaves lots of bubbles and patching on top, never letting the surface break through.  Nose is powerful and balanced. Lots of roasted black malt, dark roasted coffee, earth, dark cocoa, booze, raw/oily hops. Doesn't jump from the glass, but sits and lets you enjoy it fully. I sniffed this for a good 5 minutes before pulling back a drink.  The palette isn't as roasty and raw as the nose leads on. Lots of roasted malt, espresso, dark cooking cocoa powder, high cocoa chocolate, hop biting bitterness that is subdued and balanced. This is not a cloyingly sweet imperial stout, it is balanced and rich. The hops are surprisingly oily and flavorful at this age, I want to hold one for another year or two and see what it's like. Right not the espresso/chocolate/hop dance is beautiful. Such an immensely long finish.  The mouthfeel is heavy, thick, lightly carbonated with an oily finish. It moves around in the mouth and penetrates every taste bud with a velvet vengeance.  Now this is a proper drinking imperial stout. Big and bold, in your face attitude with a graceful refinement. I could easily kill half a sixer of these, but that would be some bad juju. This is so much better than many of the other in the style, I think this is my new favorite imperial (non-adjust/barrel aged) stout, right up there with Nogne O and Old Rasputin.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,slimstout,4.34,"Appearance: Black and very thick -- reminds me of syrup. Almost no head.  Smell: I can smell the alcohol (10.5% abv). It also smells malty.  Taste: Rich and malty. The alcohol taste is largely masked by its richness, I would have expected to taste the alcohol more. Chocolate (but not so much as to be a chocolate stout), vanilla. It has loads of malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Very, very little carbonation. It seems thick and smooth. Slight alcohol burn.  Drinkability: It's definitely a sipper. If you're a something of a lightweight (like me), you'll definitely notice the alcohol in your system through the second half of the beer even when sipping it slowly and drinking water and eating.  This beer brought a big smile to my face as I poured it, watching its thick viscous blackness, and seeing the last bits of it drizzling like a syrup over the thin head that slowly developed.

Moderate lacing. The aromas coming off were initially very strongly of molasses with a slight coffee undertone, evolving to a more balanced nose of molasses and malt.  Burns lightly of alcohol on the palate. Feels too cold initially,so I need to let it warm up. A strong bitterness that is upfront and lingers. Molasses, with maybe a bit of roasted malt underneath.

Solid retention and some spotty lace. Beautiful and extremely dark stout.  S: Dark fruits, roasted malt (slightly more coffee than bittersweet chocolate), and some smooth vanilla. Huge, sweet, and roasty. Terrific.  T: Extremely creamy flavors of raisins, prunes, licorice, port, and coffee. Good balance of big sweetness and bitterness. Some alcohol on the finish, but not too much considering the strength and relative youth. Gorgeous beer.  M: Mouth-filling and eminently creamy. Wonderful.  D: Delicious, but not the easiest to drink - lots of booze, lots of sweetness.  Notes: This is undeniably a huge beer, but it's remarkably well refined as well. The dark fruits are especially prevalent, but never overbearing. I'm really surprised this one isn't in the top 100, as IMO it's distinctly better than a number of stouts that are on there. I'll enjoy drinking (at least) one each year for the next half-decade.  Cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,oregonskibum,3.68,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Thanks bainard for throwing this in as an extra.  A: dark inky brown, approaching pure black. Pours a really nice, big, cocoa colored head that stays around for a while. Looks great.  S: Strong dark chocolate flavors. Very little roasted coffee bitterness like many RIS. Seems sweet, but smooth. Very little bitterness present on the nose.  T: Deep, rich, creamy. Chocolate flavors dominate with a slightly sweet, syrupy finish. A touch of hop bitterness, but very mellow and only noticed on the long finish. This is all about the rich malts and chocolate flavors. As the beer warmed, I noticed a sligh roasted coffee flavor sneak in, but only slightly. For the ABV, this has almost no heat or boozy sensation.  M: Slightly heavy with moderate carbonation. This is a big RIS, so I guess in character.  D: Reminds me of a baby Chokolat seeking a home. This was enjoyable to drink, don't get me wrong. In fact, I'll likely hunt out a couple more to put in the cellar. But this beer doesn't quite have enough cocoa flavors to be called a chocolate stout, yet carries many of the sweet flavors to fall in that category. Overall, a very nice beer and something I'll enjoy again in the future.  Follow up note: I wrote notes on this beer while consuming it. Unfortunately, the beer got a little tiring to drink as I finished the bottle and I knocked its score down appropriately.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rawthar,4.57,"One more from my Bell's Darkside case, about two months after purchase. This is my favorite of the bunch, time to rate it.  A- As dark as a black hole, no light that enters makes it through to the other side. A finger-and-a-half capaccino head, light and fluffy slowly dissipates, leaving some of the nicest lacing I've seen, and a nice thick filmy froth on top. Beautiful.  S- Hints of chocolate and dark roasted coffee mingle and swell like a double helix around a strong backbone of booze, and a buttery loaf of whole grain bread.  T- Boozy flavor hits like a wave against a cliff during a squall, followed promptly by the billowing smoke of a tribal bonfire carrying the essence of the roasting meat of a fresh hunt. Sweet notes of the darkest caramelized sugar rendered with dripping animal fat.  M- Oily alcohol floats on the brine like the rendered fat referenced above while the creamy carbonation bubbles from the darkest depths.  D- One is enough for even the fiercest of warriors after the most viscous of battles. Undoubtedly drank by Cimmerians during the spring raids into Pictland and Vaneheim.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,GregSVT,3.95,"12oz bottle into a snifter...extra from a recent trade. Thanks Edgar!  A: Pours pitch black like motor oil with a big dark brown head that fades relatively quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass.  S: The nose is very different from most RIS I've smelled. I can't quite place the aroma but it's very good. After some warming I can smell loads of sweet malt.  T: The taste is very unique as well. A sharp hop bite that is quickly overwhelmed by dark fruits, licorice, slight roasted malt, very sweet malts, and a boozy alcohol flavor. The alcohol isn't that bad and doesn't really detract from the enjoyment but the large amount of sweetness does.  M: Relatively thick and creamy. Good carbonation and slick.  D: Pretty good and unique from most other RIS I've tasted over the past year or 2. I'd buy a 4pack if it was available in my area. The sweetness and ABV would make it tough to drink more than one though.  Worth a try if you can get some and you like malt bombs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,zoso493,4.3,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head signature glass.  Appearance: Expedition Stout pours a creamy, deep black that allows absolutely no light to pass through. Atop the beer is a minuscule but very dark tan head that recedes quickly but maintains an omnipresence over the surface of the beer.  Smell: The nose is a typical imperial stout. There is a huge presence of dark, syrupy malts that smells as if it might be an extract of some fudge-brownie mix. In addition, there is a milky alcohol sweetness emanating from somewhere. To counter these is a nice roasted malt bitterness that only partially resembles coffee and a pine sap blend of hops.  Taste: Expedition Stout is a nice example of the style and what I would call prototypical without being exceptional. This is no knock on the beer at all, as it is very tasty and has all the ingredients for a good imperial stout. The fudge tastes come out first, followed by a good roasted malt bitterness and ending with a burst of piney hops. There's no doubt that Expedition Stout is a big, bold and brash stout that makes no qualms about being unrefined. I suspect this would make a nice brew to stick in the cellar for a year or two.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel in this is almost perfect. It is very full-bodied and feels like an oil coating your tongue. I think some of this body is derived from an intermediate amount of carbonation, which does leave an oily feeling on your palate.  Drinkability: This is one of the more drinkable imperial stouts that I've had. Despite being extremely thick and high in alcohol, it goes down very smoothly and there is absolutely no trace of the alcohol anywhere in the taste. I wouldn't drink a lot of these, but this is a very pleasant glass of beer.  Overall, Expedition Stout is just yet another example of why Bell's Brewery is a fantastic producer of beer. It's a rough example of an imperial stout and I'm a big fan of it's raw display of flavors. I only bought this one but I plan on buying a six pack as soon as is convenient to stick a couple in the cellar. There's a thunderstorm happening outside right now, and I couldn't imagine a better scenario for opening up an Expedition Stout. Do yourself a favor and buy a couple of these, stash them away and open them up when the weather turns sour - Expedition Stout won't disappoint.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ryanonline,4.53,"deliciously thick looking black pour with no light coming through, very little deep tan head with a vigorous pour. excellent lacing.  smells of a wonderful raisiny sweet smell with a hint of roasty chocolate malts and anise. very syrupy/sugary scent.  the chocolate and coffee i expect from an imperial stout come jumping right up front on the first sip, subsiding into a roasty, almost tobacco like flavor a little raisin notes throughout. brown sugary malts in the finish. there is also a definite hoppy presence.  very viscous, almost syrupy and slightly creamy in the finish. strong sweet finish that gradually becomes dry.  this is an incredibly complex beer but not so much so to the point it ruins your palette and its not to filling despite it's thick and syrupy body. really good, kind of different from most imperial stouts but in a really excellent way.  man oh man, bells has some good stuff, i really love two hearted and hopslam and this one has really opened my heart to them. cheers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,khumbard,4.37,"Bottled in 2008.  Pours thick and dark. Small tan head that falls pretty quickly. Nose is full of roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit, and a little coffee. Taste follows suit. Roasty and delicious. Finishes with a slight bitterness, similar to a really dark chocolate. Very good. Little to no alcohol noticeable. I love Expedition with over a year on it. Fresh is good, but a little too hot. Buy some, and put it down for a year and it will hold up against some of the more highly regarded big boy stouts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mrkrispy,4,"Got a bottle at the Cafe, enjoyed it in my hotel room so to speak.  Pours black as death. No head or foam whatsoever. Thin tan layer of bubbles from the pour immediately disappear.  Aroma of dark malts, some coffee, some dark chocolate, plums?, some hop aroma.  I get a lot of cocoa and roasted malts immediately in the taste. Lingering chocolate, some coffee...bit of a roasty finish. Bit hot. Coffee flavors linger afterwards too.  Could benefit with 6-12 months in the cellar. Quite a drinkable stout though. Nice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, alcohol. Smells like an Imperial Stout should. Nothing amazing about the smell, but good.  T. Big flavors of chocolate and coffee. Pretty sweet. Some alcohol but not overpowering.  M. Thick and full bodied. Very smooth. Low carbonation.  D. This a a big beer. Its a sipper for me. Not the very best Imperial Stout I have had, but very good.

287,1444,TCHopCraver,3.75,"A: Pours black with just a hint of brown into a standard pint glass. One finger head is dark brown and disappears rather quickly. I cannot see through its defenses.  S: Lots of dark chocolate with touches of anise and toasted malts. Some dark cherry and fig scents are also present.  T: Has a very smoky taste upfront that marries with the sweet chocolate/fruit flavors decently. Over the duration of the sip, the smokiness wins out over the sweetness, leaving a slightly unbalanced taste. The finish has a pretty acidic coffee flavor. The taste kind of reminds me of a s'more with a marshmallow that was held over the campfire a bit too long.  M: It has a pretty big feel, which I appreciate. It doesn't quite coat my palate in waves like other beers of the style I have had, though.  D: The high a.b.v. and competition between the sweetness and acidity in the taste make this beer lack in the drinkability category a little for me.  I think this is definitely a beer that could improve with some age on it and I will probably update my review when I've had a bottle with a year or more in the cellar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jeffthecheff,3.64,"Thanks Joe for the bottle. I've been wanting to try Expedition stout for a long time. Batch 9384  Poured straight in to my tulip, it has an unimpressive appearance. It's black in color with a dark brown head. Unfortunately, the head is thin, making the beer look flat. Very quickly after pouring, it needs a swirl just to have a visible head.  I really liked the aroma. It had a medium intensity, which was fitting since the aromas were subtle. Sweet dark malts, chocolate truffle, a bit of coffee and a touch of hops round out the nose. No alcohol detected.  The flavor is very sweet and dark up front with notes of brown sugar/molasses and licorice. Some dry roast on the finish. This beer really needs to warm up to be fully enjoyed, as its a bit harsh and poorly integrated when cold. The flavors are really intense, but there is too much heat from the alcohol for my tastes.  The mouthfeel of this beer is impressively big. It's thick and full on the palate with substantial weight. Carbonation is low, and towards the end of the glass, it was low enough to change the texture to a syrupy consistency. Expedition is a little hot for my tastes, but it had some good things going on that make me want to try this after its aged a bit more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Damian,4.88,"Drank from a 12 fl oz/355 ml bottle Batch 8728 Served in a snifter Acquired in a trade with Popkas  The beer poured an oily, viscous, absolute pitch black with a creamy, near one-finger head of reddish-tinged, saddle brown froth. Rather quickly, the head faded to a thin yet clingy ring. Spotty drops of lacing trickled down the glass with each sip.  The aroma was huge. Quite sweet overall. Milk chocolate and brown sugar notes were instantly detectable. Roasted malts came through strong. Slight char. Woody and a bit boozy with port-like accents.  The flavor profile was spectacular, and similar to the aroma in many ways. Lots of sweet malts and brown sugar up front. Roasty. Woody and slightly oaky. Coffee and maple syrup were quite noticeable in the center. The coffee flavor could be likened to that of coffee ice cream. Both milk and dark chocolate notes were apparent as well. Espresso came through strong on the finish, along with a touch of char and a pinch of piney hops. A bit smoky. Some bourbon notes appeared as well. The hops definitely showed their head more in the lingering aftertaste. Overall, an incredibly well balanced brew.  The mouthfeel was uber thick, viscous and oily. Super rich and creamy. Chewy. The residual sugars in the liquid left a sticky coating on my lips.  This beer was remarkably drinkable for a 10.5% ABV Russian imperial stout. While the flavor profile was so intense, it was also super mellow, smooth and well rounded. Perhaps the year of aging helped in this regard.  Bell's Expedition Stout is a world-class beer that unfortunately does not garner the attention on BA that it deserves. If you have not yet had the opportunity to try this, definitely seek it out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Appearance: Very dark, almost black with a dark reddish/brown hue about the sides of the glass at beer's surface.  Taste: Burnt malt noted upfront with some dark fruit and caramel sweetness. Lingering bitterness from the hops caresses the palate as roasted malt sticks to the lips and back of tongue. Some coffee notes present as well as alcohol.  Palate: Full body with mild carbonation.

287,1444,CharlatanSin,4.33,"All right! Time to pop my Bell's cherry, finally. Thanks to my dad for bringing this back to me after his road trip. Poured into an oversized wine glass.  A: Pours a super dark brown into the wine glass. It looks like chocolate sauce as it pours, and looks more black as it settles. An aggressive pour yields a healthy milk chocolate colored head which won't go away. It leaves an uneven patchwork of lacing.  S: Roasted malt, a fair bit of chocolate, and a healthy dose of booze. Nothing spectacular, but what a good RIS should smell like.  T: The usual suspects. The roasted malt seems especially astringent, which is very nice. Dark baker's chocolate comes through powerfully. I'm detecting less coffee than with its brethren, though the astringency of the roast makes up for it. A hint of prune. Booze isn't as prominent as in the nose, though naturally it comes out more as it warms. One thing I'm tasting that I haven't had in a stout before is a hint of a spicy, peppery character. I thought I was making it up, but I'm finishing the six pack now (not all in one sitting, of course), and it's still there. I have no idea what it is. I like it.  M: Thick, thick, thick. Carbonation is on the high side of the style, lively and prickly. Super sticky.  D: A great RIS and a fine introduction to Bell's. Why can't they distribute in New York?

287,1444,Nesued,4.45,"12oz bottle, aged for about 7 months.  Appearance - Dark pour, huge head (at least four-finger) pour formed, big frothy deep tan head I might add, with great lacing holding on to the glass as the head slowly retracts to a rough ""lunar landscape"". No way to see through this offering so I'll take it for granted that due to the ample head there's ample good carbonation.  Smell - Dense chocolate and sweet malt nose. Nice body of caramel and a roasty, almost refreshing sweetness. Not getting much hop aroma a good bit of anise as well. Nice.  Taste - Roasty malts come shining through in the opening a very present middle-game lead by some great chocolate and sweet notes. The end-game gives a pronounced hop bite that is my only down-tick. I would have thought that having a few months under it's belt would mellow out by now. Good that I have several more in the cellar. The ABV is exceedingly well hidden, amazing.  Mouthfeel - A creamy smoothness is the best way to describe this offering. Little carbonation is present, but no matter. There are good legs here, able to hold it's own based upon the grain bill.  Drinkability - I was suprised by this one. Wasn't expecting an exceptional stout but this is very, very close one of the best in class.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,superdedooperboy,4.02,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a snifter glass. Served at cellar temperature, 45 degrees F.  Pours a deep, dark, inky black. Virtually opaque, but showing some faint deep brown highlights around the edges. A dark cocoa-tinged head rises to a finger in height before falling away slowly to a thick crown, leaving behind some thin traces of lace on the walls of the glass.  The nose shows a nice mix of plum, prune, fig, and sweet dark cherry, with notes of espresso and dark cocoa. As it warms, alcohol becomes rather prevalent, nearly overpowering everything else.  Smooth and rich in mouthfeel with a full body and mild carbonation. Lots of decadent dark chocolate shows up front, nice and velvety, with some espresso coming in next. Things move into a middle that combines dark roasted malt and coffee notes with a large hit of hop bitterness, all of which carries over into the finish, leaving a lingering dryness with a bit of bittersweet cocoa powder lingering on the back of the tongue. Alcohol becomes somewhat noticeable as the temperature rises, but is nowhere near so dominating as in the nose.  Drinkability here is hindered for some obvious reasons, mainly the powerful flavors and the high dosage of alcohol.

Taste follows the aroma, only the 10.5% really kicks in, maybe to the extent of overpowering everything else. It was really thick and lowly carbonated, almost drinking like a thin syrup.

T - sweet start, roasted malts and nuts, big alcohol kick livens things up, chocolate, coffee, minerals. finishes with more alcohol burn, burnt toast, healthy hop bite.  M - outstanding - insanely thick body, unbelievably creamy. carbonation is tight and lively, but not distracting...more of a vehicle to break up some monotony.  D - this was one of the first ""big"" RIS i can remember having, and loving it at the time. still holds its own against all the special one-off bourbon barreled whatevers. a damn fine RIS, easily attainable, and good for the price point. definitely need to stock up on these and see how it ages.

287,1444,Telix,4.48,"I was lucky enough to have this served from a cask at Slows BBQ in Detroit, MI.  A: The pour is a tarry jet black, with a nice 1/2"" puffy, bubbly head. There is a bit of cool looking lacing around the head, but not much in the remainder. It's perfectly attractive, but most stouts aren't anything unique.  S: The aroma is mild, with a bit of roasted nuts and booze. I wish it were bigger, to be honest.  T: Extremely complex and inviting you to drink more. A super creamy maltiness forms the backbone, as bright sharp citrus notes shine through and give it an awesome acidity and tongue bite, aided by a controlled booziness. Some roasted coffee notes are in the background. I realized that THIS is what a coffee stout should be, really, not those beers that taste like cold coffee in a bottle, but this complex beverage with hints of tropical fruit, roasted malts, honey and caramel sweetness.... truly epic goodness.  M: Creamy, thick, somehow avoiding syrupyness even though it lacked much carbonation in the cask. So smooth, I almost think it has to have some oats. Great.  D: I could sit and sip this all day. It's such a smooth, creamy, complex ale, truly exceptional.

Smell and taste are roasted malt, slight earthiness, fruity, floral, and resinous hops, figgy-plummy notes, thick caramel and taffy flavours, burnt toast, nuts, and a beautifully smoky aftertaste with warm, biting alcohol.

Smells of burnt toast, roasted malts, maybe some dark fruits, and alcohol. Tastes imediately sweet with a hot finish, mildly peppery. Leaves a minerally bitter aftertaste. Aromatics faintly present. Coats the mouth and thankfully not overly carbonated so it lingers for ponderance. Unfortunately, the aromatics are so faint, it doesn't leave much to ponder.

A: Pours a dark semi thick rich pitch black color with a dark almost black head, which rises about a finger of thick creamy goodness.  N: Nose is loaded with chocolate! Bakers and milk chocolate dominate. Also adds some roast and a little coffee on the nose. Some sweet caramel, and a slight bright fruit. A slight boozy aroma also comes out.  T: Taste starts with tons of dark chocolate and bakers chocolate. Very earthy bitter stout flavor! Some creamy darkness. More roast and spicy dark malt flavor. Lots of malt to go with that. A little coffee with the roasted flavor. Some dark fruit. It's very heavy, thick, rich, spicy, earthy, bitter, roasted, chocolate, and perhaps too much of all. Some boozy warmth adds to the spicy dark flavor.  M: Super thick and heavy, rich, and more carbonation than I expected for the style.  F: Finishes pretty dry and super bitter still. Lots of earthy dark stout like char and scorched malts. The dark flavors just feel like they are pulling the water and nutrients out of my mouth. The thick syrupy barely liquid seems to stick to everything as well and coats the mouth, leaving the flavors for a while. More chocolate, roast, coffee, bitter earthy stout, and the lingering boozy flavors just go for a while.

This pour yielded a nice big mocha colored fluffy head that throws all sorts of lacing. The beer is a the typical solid black.  S- Roasted malts, jerky, charcoal, vanilla and chocolate chip cookies. Smells really good. There is a big of hops hiding under it all, but this is dominantly a sweet and roasty smelling beer.  T- Chocolate, charcoal and jerky, some whiskey like alcohol. A very rich bittersweet dark chocolate finish. The flavors are sharp and powerful. I be some age would make this a truly stellar beer.  M- Barely any carbonation. Very full bodied beer with a creamy smooth texture.  D- Pretty warm and high in alcohol. This is one rich beer. Sip on this one. ___  7/19/10 This is beer #5 from the blind beers BIF. Sent to me by MMAJYK Reviewed totally blind.  #5, quite obviously an imperial stout. Marc has me going from dark to light to dark to light. This seems well thought out.  4.5/5/4/4.5/4 Pours very thick with a head that struggles to survive. The foam is a deep red and the beer is crazy opaque.  Smells very vinous and malty. Oak, vanilla, port wine, berries, deeply roasted malt, milk, charcoal, caramel. The smells just go on and on. This is one complex beast. In many way it shares smells with this year's Dark Lord.  Very sweet and vinous, just like the nose leads on. Lots of licorice all over. A milky creaminess, dark berries, charcoal and more. This beer is huge, Id say the ABV is damn near double digits. It is nice but overall I think its way too sweet. Licorice and port wine are very strong.  Very full body. Chewy and smooth. Low carbonation. Slightly sticky, mostly in the throat.  The guy who sent it to me says he thinks its an 06 but there is no batch #. Either way this was phenomenal. It ages very very well. Thanks Marc!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jdg204,3.73,"The good folks at Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem, Pa have provided me with some long sought after brews these best few weeks. Bell's Expedition Stout was next on this list.  A: Pours a thick, pitch black color with a nice mocha colored head that stuck around for the ride.  S: There's a lot going on here with strong roasted coffee, chocolate, and boozy aromas.  T: Once again a lot going on here (too much to be honest). Rich, rich roasted flavors of coffee and chocolate which then has a big, robust boozy compliment. Then an extremely raw hoppy undertone showed up to just add to the overwhelming flavor blend. This was an odd brew where instead of one of the flavors being out of control, they were all WAY TOO BIG resulting in an over the top taste. Just too much...  M: Thick texture with good carbonation.  D: This brew wasn't bad, but it didn't really work for me and was well below expectations. Expedition Stout seemed to suffer from the curse of too much, where all the flavors where just way over the top and resulted in an overwhelming brew. A decent sipping brew but I've had a lot better RIS's and this is not one I'll be looking for again. Not recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,backfat,4.35,"this was the last beer during one of our epic stout tastings. after all the 10%+, my beer notes aren't as detailed and start to become hard to read/understand. this beer had been cellar aged for one year. enjoy. pours beautiful, with a gorgeous one finger brown sugar head. smells strong a potent. clean as cream. tastes like angels tears. the 10.5% is apparent but i don't care at this point. low carbonation. roast malts. time to take a nap.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,RedBrewer83,4.17,"Aggressively poured into snifter...  A: Pours a thick black and very viscous with almost no head, half a finger maybe and dark mocha in color, quickly falls to a thin ring around the edge and leaves decent lacing.  S: Huge roasted malt profile with molasses, raisin and brown sugar rounding things out along with just a hint of booze. Pick up just a hint of roasted coffee as well. Very nice, but not overly complex or huge.  T: Follows nose with added bitterness in the finish from a little hop and it really helps balance things out. A lot more depth in the flavor profile than in the nose.  M: Heavy body with nice carbonation, fine bubbles that are really smooth. Very nice.  D: Booze is only faintly detected and this beer goes down pretty darn smooth for the high abv. Very nice overall and would love to get my hands on more of these!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,beeragent,4.33,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle.  A - Pours a thick motor oil black, forming a good 1 inch mocha head. Thick rings of lace stick to the glass and dont move.  S - The aroma is all roasted malts on this one. Maybe a hint of bitter cocoa, but mainly the roasted malts. No alcohol is present on the nose.  T - Thick and smooth roasted malts coat the palate. A light coffee cocoa flavor then dominates the finish, with a hint of raisins. Not as complex as other RIS's but still very tasty. The taste still coats the mouth long after the swallow. Again, the alcohol is very well hidden.  M - Heavy bodied with a smooth and thick mouthfeel. Low carbonation.  D - Great flavor in this beer. I think its the appearance and mouthfeel that really make this beer stand out from the rest. Good thick taste just like an RIS should be along with the heavy body. Thick rings of lace cling to the glass the entire time. Overall just a great looking and tasting RIS!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,alleykatking,3.81,Poured from 12oz bottle. Quite surprised I haven't reviewed this beer on here!  A- Pours a nice black color. When held to the light you can see faint brown hues on the sides of the glass. Two finger mocha colored head stays for a good couple of minutes before dying down to whisps of foam on the top of the beer. Lacing was streaked on the sides of the glass.  S- Big roasted malts in the front of the aroma. Ground coffee smell was muted a little in the middle with some light chocolate notes and even lighter hints of prunes. Alcohol is present in this but it almost takes on a semi-sweet note to it. I picked up some brown sugar hanging around the alcohol. For a stout of this size though the overall aroma was muted.  T- This beer starts off with a nice roasted taste that lasts well into the middle of the beer. Light darker fruits in the middle that shine through in small doses. The ending on this one is a little more chocolate sweet than I remembered. Light roasted taste in the back end of this one as well.  M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good with the style. Left a oily slick roasted mess on the palate and into the aftertaste. Chewy is good feature with this beer. Sludge like...heh. Makes you want to take a sip right after you are done with the first one.  D- This is a good drinkable stout. The only reason I gave it a 3.5 was because I could not drink a sixer of this even if I tried. It was a very filling beer for me and after a couple I would need to switch to something lighter in feel.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,hardy008,4.05,"Dark black color with which lets no light pass through. Has a large brown head with good retention. Smells of chocolate, molasses, raisins, and coffee. The taste mirrors the aroma nicely. Has a nice mixture of sweetness and coffee bitterness. Full bodied, creamy, and properly carbonated. Bell's does a nice job of disguising the 10.5% abv. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Florida9,4.07,"A: Black in color, but not overly viscous. Pours with a light brown crema-like head .  S: Sweet chocolate, raisins, plums. Complex of dark fruit aromas.  T: Bittersweet chocolate and a little coffee. Long dry cocoa finish. Alcohol is perceptible.  M: Thick, but not overly thick. Carbonation is on the lighter side, but is appropriate. Leaves a powdery or dry sawdust feeling in the mouth.  D: A very good, quite complex beer. Excellent sipper and another very good beer from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ILikeGoodCider,3.4,"Enjoyed on 02.07.2010. Batch number on bottle: 9384. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a 14 oz. pint glass.  A: Pours thick and black, viscous, remind me of motor oil. I was a little surprised at the head that developed on this, it just kept rising to almost two inches of light brown creamy foam. Lacing was down the glass.  S: Aromas were a bit complex with a mix of coffee, prunes, and a bit of brown sugar. There is also a faint bit of alcohol but no hops.  T&M: Heavy and full on the tongue, thick & chewy. Lots of coffee and thick sweet malts. It's hard to tell where the bittering is coming from - the bittering of the dark roast or something else. There are other flavorful hints in here too, like raisins, candy sugar, something like black licorice, and several layers of other malts. The carbonation is very fine and rather minimal, but it is there and seems to be well matched to the brew. The finish on this is long, as you might expect, with sweet malts that fade quickly to a long linger of bitter coffee tones.  D: Smooth and creamy texture is an interesting contrast to the aggressive coffee bittering, sort of a hard & soft complex. The ABV makes this a stiff drink, but it's enjoyable just the same.  I do love me a Bell's Stout...I've cellared three of these for sampling in the future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rustymoore,3.51,"I strongly disagree with the recent rash of poor reviews for this beer and I am thinking that a bad batch got out to the public or something. I find this to be a good to fair imperial stout.  A: Pours midnight black with my aggressive pour creating a massive creamy head that seems to go on forever, excellent lacing throughout.  S: Maybe the weakest attribute to this one. Just nothing interesting. Very high alcohol notes with some coffee sprinkled in there.  T: Thick and sweet (two attributes I like in a stout most of the time) with coffee and chocolate throughout. I wouldn't call it the best imp stout I have had but definitely is worthy of a ""good"" rating.  M: Somewhat acidic, thick like most stouts you would want to drink.  D: I wouldn't drink many of these in a sitting but definitely a good sipping beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: A very understated aroma of coffee, malt, and chocolate.  T: Tasted of espresso, roasted malt, and a hint of chocolate. It's a big, bold flavor - very robust, as a Russian Imperial Stout should be.  M: A very well-carbonated beer with a dry finish. Full-bodied, but not obnoxiously so.  D: This is a very drinkable beer, well made and easy to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,glid02,4.3,Cask at the Atlanta Cask Ale Festival.  Pours black with a surprisingly large one-finger brown head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of mild dark malts with a nice roastiness and hints of pine hops.  Tastes much more robust than it smells. Smooth roasted malts with large unsweetened chocolate flavors kick things off. Hints of anise enter into things midway through the sip along with very mild amounts of pine hop flavors. Roasted malt flavors mosey back in before a solidly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is great. I was looking forward to trying this on cask simply because of the mouthfeel and I was not disappointed. A great thickness with grainy and soft carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I finished my glass without a problem and could have another.  Overall this is a more intense smell away from being a great beer however as it is it's still knocking on the door. Well worth a shot.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

No gimmicks to this beer, just a serious imperial stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Daniellobo,4.3,"Five year´s since the review below this review... This has grown significantly in my appreciation: this is one of the top RIS around, and maybe my favorite from Bell´s? We´ll, there is no need to choose. Still prefer the edge of the draft whenever I´ve been lucky to have it. But the the bottle also shines. Top notch stout with all the right roasted notes and a marked liquorice angle (a bit more prominent on draft...). Ah, and it does age beautifully...  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Simple and unattractive (if iconic.. I would not change it at this point) front label with a straight forward star (a compass?) Back label includes a minimal narrative bragging about its quality, and cellaring ability. Now it shows package code and date, things have changed here: 09/11/15. Notes Alc. by Vol. (10.5%) Served into a snifter.  A - Black and viscous pour, fair frothy head, with moderate and nice retention, some touches of lacing.  S - Rich roasted nose, coffee, hint of vanilla in some of the faint sweetness, emerging liquorice, a herbal hoppy note...  T - Roasted goodness, long complexity with ample notes of coffee, a dash of cocoa, woven with a nine hoppy resinous bitterness, a dash of grass links to the emerging and liquorice resonance on the palate.  M - Full body, not too heavy, some sense of oil and chewiness that helps translate the finish in to a slick lasting memory...  O - We've come a long way. A personal favorite, and one the stouts that best highlights the memory of liquorice root with roasted/bitter notes.  Notes: Yep, palates have changed... I was surprised by my own assessment of this brew in the prior review. I've been seeking it out proactively for quite a few years, and I'm surprised I did not have a chance to revisit this before. Also had Black Note in the interim, which is spectacular, but I feel no need to age this wonder of a stout. Again, fortunately, one has no need to choose...  --------------  2010 Review  Rich, hefty, and remarkable stout, but not as memorable as its draft version.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Simple and unattractive front label with a straight forward star (a compass?) Back label includes a minimal narrative bragging about its quality, and cellaring ability. Lacks freshness or bottling date, but shows a batch number (9359). Notes Alc. by Vol. (10.5%) Served into a snifter.  A - Black body with a small frothy head. Average to small retention with brief touches of lacing.  S - Rich roasted malt aroma with a coffee and chocolate rhythm. A boozy and aromatic whiff emerges as it warms up. It is quite different from its draft counterpart. A bit medicinal even  T - Complex and assertive dark malts, coffee, a bit of caramel with an emerging medicinal character.  M - Full body, creamy and thick feel with fine carbonation.  D - A good sipper, best to be enjoyed slowly and with some care.  Notes: Hmmm, it does not stand up to its draft form.... At least not the one I had recently that made me revisit the bottle. In fact I had a couple of ounces a few days ago from a cask version and this sits nowhere near it. The brew remains reliable and quite tasty but does not feel extraordinary. The draft was much more memorable and had a range of subtleties that were missing from the bottle. In fact, it is close to boredom at times.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,zoso1967,4.28,"Pours super dark black. Completely opaque. Probably the darkest beer I have ever seen with a very dark tan head. Nice fluffy head with good retention. Aroma is roasty and rich with coffee, bitter chocolate, some raisin, toffee sweetness and a bit of alcohol. Taste is much sweeter than expected. This beer has a lot going on. While the coffee and roasted malt taste is there, they are not as prevalent as in the aroma. I would say the main flavors are bitter chocolate, malt sweetness and a smokiness that reminds me of burnt marshmallows. I also detect a sort of herbal and fruity taste. Quite alcoholic, I can taste it and feel the warmth. A full bodied beer that is silky smooth and chewy. Definitely one to savor.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,manahansf,3.71,"Pours thick and dark brown with a light lacy brown head. Vinous malty aromas flow from the glass foreshadowing the brews strength and flavor which is also vinous and has a fig ester flavor. The body is big and heavy with very low carbonation levels making it flow very slow. Likewise, the finish is slow and warms with a vinous end.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,teovaldi,4.52,"Pours a thick motor oil black with a 1 finger head that lingers.  The nose is huge. I pick up coffee and chocolate foremost with roasted malts and toffee, along with dark cherry's.  The taste is the same and the alcohol is apparent but with how thick this bad boy is you almost welcome the warmth.  The mouthfeel can only be described as chewy creamy and HEAVY.  As far as drinkablity goes, this is a one and done for me. There are a few other RIS that I've had more than one, but an Expedition is just so damn heavy its either an enjoyable one beer night or an equally enjoyable nightcap.

287,1444,pmccallum86,3.93,"Pours a dark brownish black color with a massive thick bubbly mocha colored head.  Lots of licorice and hops in the nose. Some chocolate and toffee aromas as well. Roasted malts come through too, but the licorice is the top dog here.  Boom! Flavors galore here; licorice, chocolates, cocoa powder, big roasted malts and hops. Very flavorful beer, as with the smell centered on the licorice. Quite a delicious and original RIS.  Mouthfeel is thick with a medium level of carbonation. Viscous as a mf'er.

287,1444,abrand,4.22,"12 ounce bottle poured into the snifter. This bottle has been aging in the cellar for about 1 year.  Pours midnight dark black. No visibility is seen through the liquid with even the slowest of pours. After an aggressive pour, there is a very faint tan head that quickly fades away. The nose is quite strong with some sweet raisins, chocolate and malts. Also some hints of vanilla beans and molasses. After enjoying the smell and letting this warm up to room temperature, I finally took my first sip. The taste is hoppy, malty, sweet, all the above. Sweetness is coming through as raisins and caramel while there is the hoppy bitterness as well as a roasted toasted malty finish. I really enjoy the taste of the Expedition. Mouthfeel is quite thick and syrupy. Drinkability is moderate with this being a run of the mill Imperial Stout",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,afausser,4.22,"A: A vigorous pour into a 12 oz snifter results in a thin half finger of burgundy-singed dark tan head. The retention on it is not very good, though to be fair, it is fairly high in ABV so I'm not sure I should have expected too much more. Leaves an uneven ring of bubbles around the top of the glass and little wisps of foam on the top of the brew. The color itself is an opaque dark cherry that lets little to no light in, with tiny, slow moving carbonation bubbles. As you drink, a fine sheet of tiny bubbles of lacing glitter down the edge of the glass and leave a few patchy areas behind.  S: Smells wonderful from the moment you crack the bottle--I can't wait to see how it warms. Heavy milky caramel, vanilla, and slight toffee, as well as rum soaked fruits--raisins, prunes, apricots, and sweet cherries. Also quite a bit of licorice, particularly when agitated, as well as a hint of sweet apple pie as it warms.  T: Quite earthy and smoky, particularly in the aftertaste. Roasted malts and very dry burnt toast. The fruit and candy flavors in the nose definitely take a back seat here, at least while it's still relatively cold. Does get a bit sweeter as it warms--almost syrupy in the flavor, and then evens out and is nicely balanced. The rum soaked fruits also come out quite a bit when warmed. Lesson learned, let it warm--it's almost a totally different beer.  M: Very dry, and the fine carbonation doesn't do this one any favors. Feels like I just ate something on fire--very smoky in addition to how dry my mouth feels after just a couple sips--oh, and it's foamy, too. It's not especially hot, particularly for the style and ABV, yet the aftertaste is almost overwhelming. Does get far better as it warms, but I'm not really impressed with this mouthfeel/style combination.  D: Does go down rather smooth and creamy with little heat for the ABV, but the mouthfeel is pretty frustrating until it warms significantly and the carbonation nearly dies down completely. A great beer overall, but drinkable? One to let warm and sip.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ocelot2500,3.95,"Pours a deep black with a small tan head that leaves enough lacing on the glass.  Smells of coffee and molasses mostly with a nice chocolate undertone.  Tastes of the roasted malts upront followed by a subtle hop bitterness and ending with a little sweetness. Notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and molasses all make their way through. Sweetness supports the chocolate and caramel. Hops are very subtle as they should be. Alcohol is noticeable, but that should be expected.  Mouthfeel is full, but on the lighter side of full. The carbonation is appropriate, but could be a bit creamier.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,civilizedpsycho,4,"Poured bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a solid black color that had about a half-inch of a light tan colored head. Looks very nice and appealing.  Smell: Strong roasted coffee smell dominates the aroma. Hidden are hints of chocolate and a bit of alcohol.  Taste: Again, the roasted coffee flavor dominates here. There's a bit of chocolate to create almost a mocha flavor. The alcohol is also nicely masked.  Mouthfeel: While it had a pretty full body, I expected better in this area. It felt almost like I was drinking syrup as the carbonation didn't seem to last after the initial pour.  Drinkability: While I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, the high alcohol brings down the drinkability.

Unlike others I got a nice towering dark brown head, minimal lace and aroma is burnt chocolate, roasted grains and bitter coffee. Like others I found a slight fruitiness in the taste which added a very mild tartness to the middle. Nothing special in any category, more dark chocolate flavors and roasted barley notes in the taste, mild graham cracker crust and the head did have some gold dust particles that sparkled like glitter when held to the light. Good beer but much better RIS's more readily available.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,tegelaar,2.42,Pours thick like an oil slick with a small amount of head that took a bit to appear. Clear film of lacing sticks to the glass for just a moment while you drink. Smells of earthy fruit and dirt. Also some badly burned meat. Uh oh at this point I know I am in trouble. The taste also does nothing for me. Like drinking oven cleaner. I can respect that it is very rich and flavorful but can't finish this beast.

287,1444,weatherdog,3.62,12oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass  Batch 9435  It pours a almost black with ruby highlights. The head is deep cherry wood color that is very apealing. I've had a few different stouts from Bell's and they seems the head color seems to be distinctly darker than other breweries. It's kind of nice to see a deep carmel red color as opposed to the normal tan. there is minimal lacing as I am finishing the drink.  The smell is pretty off-putting. There is a strong medicinal smell like isopropyl alcohol; not pleasant at all. Behind those off smells are the usual roasty coffee type but I can not get past the medicinal character.  The taste thankfully redeems itself with a rich deep roastiness cholocalte with a large helping of residual sweetness. The sweetness is heavy but not cloying as to hamper drinkability. The roasty notes last through out the sip and linger a little bit. just a hint of alcohol hotness on the end but that is to be expected.  I think it is a little to carbonated for me. I prefer my bigger stouts that have a lot of sweetness to be on the low side of carbonation. Drinkability is above average for the style for me. I'm not sipping this as i normally do with big stouts but drinking it rather quickly.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,IronCitySteve,4.03,"A: Pours a thick viscous black color, with some small amounts of red hues. Head is a thick tan head with ample lacing.  S: Alcohol, smoke, coffee, bready/burnt toast, black licorice and some dark chocolate. Lots going on, but the alcohol and smoke dominate.  T: I find the alochol hitting the palate first, followed up by some intense coffee and licorice with some lingering chocolate.  M: Leaves a thick creamy sweet, yet tingling feel on the palate. The tingling from the alcohol.  D: I really enjoy this beer a lot, but it is thick and has a high ABV.

287,1444,hayesez,4.55,"The Expedition is an outstanding Russian Imperial that I always keep on hand. At only $15 a six-pack, I keep about 12 in my basement and rotate them so that I'm always drinking one that has been aged for over a year. It's a great stand-by when craving a heavy stout. Cracked one open today during the football games. Poured into my Russian Imperial Stout tulip glass.  Pours dark as can be with no penetrating light at all. A two-finger heavy brown cap quickly forms on the top before dissipating to a thick ring around the edges. Blotches of tiny bubbled lacing remain long after the beer is gone. Every time I swirl this, a one finger head rises on top of my beer releasing that wonderful aroma!  A strong smell of chocolate dominates each sniff. Even after over a year of chilling out, there is a still a presence of alcohol in there as well. There is also a vinous quality that I get on the end...and I'm sure there is a lot more that I'm missing as well. Although I don't get it in this glass as much as with other Expeditions I've had, there is generally that overripe fruit smell as well. Not so much in this bottle, but common in this beer.  I really do enjoy this beer. The flavors have had a chance to blend together well to produce a very nice balance of chocolate and roasted malts. It starts with a sweet cocoa and then finishes just a tad more bitter than I would prefer, although that is pretty common in the style. The alcohol is well masked although as it warms up, it is a little more obvious.  This is a thick and heavy beer. Very chewy and lingers around in my mouth, exactly like I like Russian Imperials. Very drinkable given the 12 ounce serving size. Too much more than that and I think it would begin to be a bit of a challenge.

Nothing different there. The taste is unlike any RIS I have ever had. Molasses, malts and a bit of chocolate make up the initial taste. Then Bitter hits my tongue and takes over. All I can taste now is the bitter from some unknown source. I think a little age would do wonders for this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, velvety and a bit creamy. I could not drink another of these right now. It just is way to bitter for me.

287,1444,Minotaur,4.4,"On tap at Spinnerstown Hotel for a Bell's event. The pint glass delivered to the table is a deep black-brown with no light coming through. The head is bright tan, about half a finger, and retains longer than expected for many stouts. There is moderate carbonation initially then it slows to a thick stillness.  The aroma is malty, roasted, chocolate and spicy with a little bit of yeast esters. Good...representative, but doesn't really illustrate the intensity of flavor.  Upon taking a sip the flavor is a veritable explosion of deep, dark tastes that also make their way to the nose. There is licorice, chocolate - sweet and bitter, hops, toasted bread, cinnamon, vanilla, and a heady coffee and roast taste. As you drink through the melange becomes more complex and richer. Sweet tastes come through more strongly and any bitterness recedes. The blasts of cinnamon and spice are truly impressive. Through out the glass the alcohol becomes apparent and the beer almost takes on a bitter chocolate liquor quality.  The mouthfeel is satisfying and smooth, and lighter than the flavor density; it is good - but I'd almost like something a little thicker in the mouth to match up to the cake-like quality of the taste.

287,1444,cpetrone84,4.46,"I have previously reviewed this beer in bottle but the cask was something different and I thought it was entitled to a new review.  A-jet black in color that lets no light through. thick creamy dark coffee colored head that has solid retention and leaves nice lacing  S-light roasted malts, hints of milk chocolate and some molasses  T/M-it is extremely smooth and creamy, very robust and full bodied, almost chewy. the taste brings big dark chocolate, a light roasted malt, some molasses, alcohol is slightly present, hints of dark fruit towards the finish.  D-amazing! so creamy, so chocolate, and huge flavors!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Heavenisbeer,3.96,"Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a deep chocolate-black, with suspended, flurried sediment throughout, including a thick layer on the bottom of the glass. Thin head dissipates rapidly, leaving in its wake splotchy caramel-brown puddles. Light, transitory lacing. Appearance is extremely warm and inviting, exciting even. Other than gentle bubbling on its surface, no sign of carbonation.  S: Nose is sweet, lightly infused with prunes, and a little buttery. There is also a hint of saltiness, soy sauce even.  T: Complex. The chocolaty appearance is not seconded by the taste--sweet and salty malt burst, followed by a molasses middle, ending in a bitter finish. The taste is not commensurate to its body (see Mouthfeel). The high ABV is masked very well, although the final kick is a delicate alcohol finish on the back of the tongue.  M: Wonderfully dense, viscous, and chewy. Rich and syrupy, a little oily. Thickest stout I've probably ever had. Warm alcohol finish.  D: Delicious, but definitely not a beer that I could drink more than one of in one sitting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BigBigPickle,4.5,"Was at Sheffield's in Chicago for the Hopslam release party and they tapped a firkin of Expedition Stout prior to the Hopslam.  A: Dark brown, casading down the glass - it looked almost like Guiness (bad lighting). Great toasty brown head with tremendous staying power and fantastic lacing. Looked like a glass of chocolate!  S: Malt, sugar - Brown sugar, very big coffee.  T: Bourbon - Heavy Coffee - Brown Sugar. A little maple syrup with a very peaty taste. Also a backing of carmelized brown sugar.  M: Wow!!! All I can say.  D: Only one. I could not have had another, Too much to handle, but what an experience!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Tucquan,4.15,"Had this on 2010-01-11 in a bottle from my trading buddy, Steve.  Pours a deep, dark brown with a very short, dark tan head. The head fades quickly.  The smells are of fruit, chocolate, coffee and licorice.  The taste profile follows the aroma very well but with the addition of caramel and molasses complimenting the chocolate, acrid coffee, alcohol, and to a lesser extent the licorice and fruit flavors. It seems most of the bitterness is from the malt roast but I taste a bit of grassy, hops bitterness too. At 10.5% ABV, this brew certainly warms the belly but the alcohol is well-balanced with the other flavors.  The mouthfeel is very creamy. I could've used a bit more carbonation to smooth it out.  All-in-all, a well-crafted and delicious brew that can be drunk now or aged for years.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,diybrun,3.93,"Poured into a pint glass stout black (is stout black not a color? it is now) with a 1/2 finger head that left very little lacing. Smells of... hops? Maybe my nose is off, but I smell a bit of citrus, not something I'm used to from a stout. Some roasted barley, too. Carbonation is there, but it's weak. Cream and alcohol are predominant, smoked barley and hints of mocha and caramel too. Definite hop presence, especially in the aftertaste, which I don't mind. This beer has a kick, as I would expect from an imperial stout, but it isn't that balanced. I don't see myself kicking back and enjoying a couple of these. Still a perfectly enjoyable stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,FickleBeast,4.35,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a thick, viscous, motor oil black. A vigorous pour manages to coax out a full finger of tan foam. It leaves sheets of lace as it recedes, this beer has some serious viscosity to it.  Aroma is rich - dominant is a sweet milk chocolate aroma, with some coffee  First flavor is a hot alcohol burn, subsiding quickly into a dark fruity flavor, then finishing with coffee and lingering bitterness. Flavors are intense and there is a lot going on with this beer. The flavors blend together as the beer warms, overall this is pretty damn tasty.  As stated before, this beer is very thick. The carbonation has a hard time poking through. Drinkability is high considering the ABV",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jera1350,4.42,"Pretty fresh 2009 edition:  Pours a thick pure black with thin layer of tan suds.  Quite hoppy nose with lots of chocolate and roasty malts. A hint of almost mint/menthol. This may just be the hops though.  Matches up well with the nose. A bit more deep toasted malt and dark chocolate. Kiss of coffee bean. Pretty big grassy hop profile that I'm digging. Toasty finish.  Very smooth and lightly creamy. The body just feels a bit short of what a RIS should have.  Well, that not so huge body allows the drinkability to run very high. Great all around RIS. Bell's has to be one of my favorite breweries. Looking forward to aging a few of these to see how it develops.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,NYCWheatFanSC,2.83,"A - Pours a thick dark black with a small, cherry mocha head that recedes quickly to a microfilm on top with a sturdy collar that leaves alot of lacing as the beer goes down.  S - Licorice, alcohol, and burnt brown sugar dominate.  T - The estery alcohols impart an almost robitussin-eque flavor that is rather off-putting from the start. Smoke, and caramelized molasses are also big players here, but not strong enough to mask the cough syrup flavors.  M - Nice and chewy, with a bit more carbonation than I would expect which unfortunately brings out alot of the more acrid flavors.  D - Would not seek this one out again over many, many others I have readily available.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,crossovert,3.6,"12 oz bottle purchased from the Bell's General Store.  Pours into my pint a dark black with slight ruby edges when held to light. The head is thick and creamy and large. It is brown/tan and leaves thick lacing behind.  SMell is very carmally, also some molasses, nuts, maple, brown sugar, coffee, and cocoa.  Mouthfeel is extra thick but the alcohola nd slight carbonation do bite the lips. It tastes chocolatey and fruity, with a definite alcohol bite. It is pretty sweet and bittersweet but it doesn't reach cloying levels. This is one of those big ass beers that you drink to warm up. They could have bumped it up to 12% though considering the strength of the alcohol already on the palate.  This is a big and bold Russian imperial stout, but for a true Michigan jewel I recommend the Dark Horse Plead the 5th.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BeerInReview,3.66,"It's a typical dark black stout color, but I manage to get some decent head, two fingers worth. The dark tan head gradually dissipated into a collar around the beer and provided nice lacing. I could smell a lot of malt and a twinge of alcohol. The taste was sweet at first but quickly transitioned to heavy roasted malt. The finish left my mouth dry with chocolate notes. The beer was thin, but full bodied with an appropriate amount of carbonation. The 10.5% ABV is making my mouth very dry and I don't think I could drink another. One is enough. Overall, the beer was good, as I would not turn this one down if offered, but I've had better stouts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,techfed87,4.4,"Pours a strong, mocha colored head. Smells strongly of caramels and heavy malts. Head is very slow to dissipate.  First taste comes off almost salty for a second, quickly turning to a bitter, coffee-like taste and consistency. H'oh my, this beer is a thick one. In terms of flavor, it's much tightly packed together than many other Imp stouts out on the market. At the same time saying that, it's much easier to drink than many imperial stouts are. Carbonation on this batch is just right. It picks up where the natural bitterness ends off, giving it a real kick in flavor just as the after-taste is beginning to show its head.  Several minutes into drinking this one, and the head is still present. This puts it in a category of beer that you usually don't see.  At 10.5%, the beer is one of the stronger ones. However, it keeps itself within reason. A definite treat for a winter night. This is one of Bell's best brews hands down. Try it sometime!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ShadesOfGray,3.99,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Ommegang tall snifter. Pours a dark, thick black with little initial head. As the pour taps off, the head grows big, light brown with great sticky frothy lacing.  Aroma is fairly light with lots of bitter notes. Roasted coffee...but a slight ash-tray smell...weird.  Very thick creamy taste. Pleasant flavor...bitter-sweet chocolates, dark roasted coffee. Great warming sensation down the throat. Wow, after smelling this beer, I espected a bad stout. Flavor is actually very good! Full body. Drinkability down due to thickness...but a must try!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ThatWineGuy,4.32,"A half finger charcoal mocha head diminished and retreated revealing a tar black, oily brew with minor ribbon lace. The beer is perfectly opaque - a deep dark black hole to look at. Heady smell of burnt toast and dark chocolate, coffee beans, tree bark, smoke, very complex.  Make no mistake, this is a huge RIS and very strong and assertive. Black licorice dominates, charcoal, flashes of sour that initially made me pucker - must be the hop presence. Overpoweringly rich, boozy, like a high ABV barley wine made with anise. Very creamy in the mouth, dense, heavy with hops, dark toasted malt, burnt and smokey. This beer literally blew me away, savoured and sipped, it took on subtler aspects with air and warming but demanded respect. It took me a long time to finish it. Next time I find a bottle of this, it will stay considerably longer in my cellar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Lunch,4.55,"Served from a 12oz. bottle purchased at Shangy's in Emmaus, PA into my Bell's tulip at the appropriate temperature (01/01/10).  A: Pours a deep oily jet black with a two finger cap of a cappuccino foam that dissolves slowly leaving some patchy lace.  S: Excellent bouquet of fresh espresso and dark chocolate along with a roasted malt. Some tones of milk chocolate and cocoa are present as well.  T: Beautiful flavor containing notes of fresh coffee, espresso, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, chocolate malt, and some bittering hops. The bitterness seems to linger on the tougne for some time and continues into the finish.  M: Thick and full-bodied with smooth and creamy carbonation. None of the 10.5% abv is present at all.  D: Incredibly drinkable as the flavors are well balanced and rich. The 10.5% abv. is hidden expertly never showing itself at in the slightest.  Overall this was a truly a wonderful Imperial Stout that certainly lives up to the hype. Another quality product from Bell's and certainly one that has to tried by all Imperial Stout fans.

287,1444,babaracas,4.17,"Pours an opaque very dark brown with thin light brown head, fast fading, no lacing. Smell: roasty, dark brown sugar, a little wood smoke, dark fruit, touch of soy sauce. Taste: molasses, not quite burnt, dates, milk chocolate aftertaste, rich roasty coffee, leafy and spicy hop in the background, quite sweet. Mouthfeel: syrupy but low on carbonation.

287,1444,Mora2000,4.03,Picked up in a trade from Exiled.  2007 vintage. Pours pitch black with basically no head. What little head is present is is a brown color. Aroma is strong coffee with some roasted malt and dark fruit. the flavor is heavy on the roasted malt with some smokiness. Some dark fruit and bitter chocolate as well. There is also a slight soy sauce character to the beer. The alcohol has a nice alcohol warming affect. Very thick body and low carbonation. Slightly creamy mouthfeel.

Some dark fruit character and I think I get some roasty-dark-chocolate notes in the finish. Good balance between the residual sweetness and bitter roasted malt, but just not the right balance for me.  Mouthfeel: Medium-low carbonation. Somewhat of a mouth-coating oil-slick.  Overall impression: Better around 55-60F than right out of the fridge. Slight alcohol warmth. Definitely a sipper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Less roasty than I would expect, more salty and malty. Small bitter chocolate and black licorice.  T – Shockingly, vividly flavorful. Smoky and slightly estery and tanned leather with a bitter piney hop. So complex and potent, as compared to a year ago. Still not astounding.  M – Extremely thick and, dare I say, slimy.  D – Not so much.

All the molasses, cocoa and roasted goodness one can expect from an RIS.  T- Where do I begin? How can I do it jutice? Roasted malts galore, coffee, espresso, black barley, bourbon-soaked raisins, and on and on. Wonderfully balanced.  M- Velvety, smooth, and exquisitely mouth-coating. Dessert in a glass.  D- Wonderful sipper on a cold winters night. Bell's got this one right.  Not my all-time, but close!  Bro's, you guys got a bad one.

Molasses & chocolate dominate along with the booziness that's pretty noticeable in the nose.  Taste: The molasses & chocolate from the nose are very present in the palate as well. Rich and roasty; heavy on the malts. Not a whole heck of a lot in the way of hop bitterness. Very sweet & boozy.  Mouthfeel: Not very carbonated. Rich, creamy, & smooth... like a chocolate milkshake in that respect. Moderate alcohol warmth felt in the palate.  Ok. I prefer a little more carbonation and more roastiness.

Milk chocolate and some liquorish. Smoke, dry wood/oak aromas as well. A huge nose. T: Roasted malt and chocolate again. The malt seems sticky and chewy. Sweet toffee and some liquorish. A little one dimensional, but good. M/D: A full and thick body that is low on the carbonation. Creamy and velvety smooth. This is a good beer to sip on, but one is more than enough for a night.

287,1444,Kegatron,4.33,"On tap @ the Capital Ale House (Richmond, VA) on 12/13/09. Served in a cervoise.  Pours a deep flat black in the glass, with a finger of smooth looking dark & burnt mocha head. Retains with some huge frothy bunching around the edges, that leaves a huge cascade of drenching foam in its wake. The aroma is very floral and hoppy up front, with thickish sweet notes of chocolate and toffee mixing in with sharp coffee and roasted bitterness. Alcohol gives this some heft and punch in the nose.  The taste is even more sweetness, milk chocolate and toffee, with some extra sticky notes of brown sugar and molasses. Even a bit of dark fruit towards the back of the profile. Hops, coffee, and roast surround this, with a deeply burnt and bitter feel that really sticks hard in the finish. The mouthfeel is as full as can be, with a massively creamy feel up front that coats the back of the palate. Thick, sweet, and gooey, this is the rare feel here that's up there some of the best Imperial Stouts. There is some warmth on the tale end of the swallow but the alcohol is so entrenched in the rich flavors, it's not really detectable at all.  Man, I had forgot how hoppy this is fresh and it's no wonder that this is a great candidate for aging. The flavors are just so robust on this and the feel is one of my favorites on a Stout.

Wait long enough and a little lingering bitterness from the hops comes in. A little detectable booziness, but it hides it's strength remarkably well. mmm. Everything and more I'd expect from a giant of a stout.  Mouthfeel: smooth and scrumptious. Like drinking a milkshake...with a lot of booze  Overall: a superlative brew. A phenom. Wicked.

Aromas of earthy dark chocolate, smoke, and roasted grain leap from the glass. The smoke, which hints at peppery country ham, really sets this beer apart. Then comes a (dried) leafy hoppiness in the background to add further complexity. A strong base of sweet caramel ties everything together.  Loads of chocolate on the palate, with sweet and bitter notes pulsating back and forth. There's an unexpectedly strong resinous hop character underneath, providing contrast but contributing to the whole. Very smooth, especially for an imperial stout. This beer lacks any roasty bite found in many similar beers, and is really quite light on the roast on the whole.  Thick and rich and dense, but not unnecessarily chewy. Low level of carbonation, which works with this beer. Finishes bitter--a combination of hops and roast (about the only place the roast shows itself, really)--but fades as the beer lingers on the palate.  Fantastic.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours nearly black with a half inch tan head that settled to a thin covering that sticks to the sides. Nice lacing on the glass as well.  Aroma has coffee and bitter chocolate with some slightly sweet roastyness to it.  Taste has some dark chocolate, coffee and roastedness followed by a nice long bitterness that lingers in the mouth.

S - Roasted malts and chocolate at first sniff. As beer warms starts to smell like playdough, very odd.  T - Dark malts, slight rum flavor, chocolate, not a lot of dark fruit flavors. A sharp bitterness on the finish from the amount of yeast in the pour.  M - Nice thick/slick mouthfeel. Not too carbonated (how I like my big stouts).  D - Given the sharp bitterness, this one is not real pleasant to drink. Certainly not meant to be a sessionable beer, but the sharp bitter flavor really takes away from the overall experience and is hard for the beer to show any complexity with such a dominating force to compete with.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,cassanoj,2.77,"Poured into a stange glass. Thick, black and syrupy. Brownish head, but not much of it.  Smells like chocolate and licorice. Other flavors - molasses, coffee, nice roasted maltiness. Some dark fruits - plums, raisins.  Tastes like... beef. Not a fan. I like how thick it is, it's a nice sipper. Kind of weird that there's virtually no carbonation. I can't get over that beef taste. Behind the beef lies some sweet chocolate, dried fruit, caramel, malty.  The mouthfeel is okay. I like the thickness but I wish it was balanced out with some nice carbonation. Not a very complex beer, or if it is, I think it's rather unbalanced on the thick, chocolate side.  Overall, I think I would have liked this beer more if it didn't feel like I just hunt it down and shot it. I definitely understand the name though. It is what it tries to be and I can certainly appreciate that. Just... not my cup o' tea.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Taste is dark malt forward with dark chocolate and coffee taking center stage. Backed up by lighter notes of molasses, rasisin, plum. Faint earthy and smoky qualities. Full bodied, dry, earthy, slightly chalky. Good RIS, true to style, big bold flavors and nice balance with a well hidden ABV (in the taste anyway).

Poured a dark chocolate brown with a monstrous head, dark brown bubbles which hung out for a long time with long spiderlegs after settling.  Smell of dark roasty malt, with a lot of sweetness, raisins, rum, caramel  Taste hit it off the first sip. A deep dark sweet stout with great body, caramel, lots of chocolate, raisin, tons of plum flavor, and a finish that has that similar chalk/ dry finish - only in expedition stout, I dont mind it at all because of the lingering chocolate flavor. Some RIS have a finishing afterbite that tastes of charcoal, this one seems to be a lot lighter on that end. Nice body, not too thick, and in no ways near being watery.

Head starts out about an inch thick and quickly thins out, but sligh tan heads remains the entire time.  Smells slightly sweet with a pleasant aroma.  First taste is heaven. Great balance of alcohol heat and darker grains (bitter coffee and chocolate notes). Mouthfeel is just right; not too thick, not too thin.  Alcohol creeps up on you towards the end of the glass.

287,1444,gmcfarre,4.47,"Batch #7251 - Packaged on February 25, 2006 12 oz bottle poured into St. Bernardus Chalice  A - Pours a thick, pitch black sludge that closely resembles oil (in a delicious, inviting way). Very little head appears, but its a rich tan color when it does. Lacing is mild, given the tiny bits of carbonation around the edges of the glass.  S - Rich espresso & dark, bitter chocolate immediately leap out of the chalice, along with a strong slightly sweet roasted malt flavor. Some dark caramel & fruit flavors emerge as it warms.  T - Starts with a rich, dark chocolate sweetness that is quickly accompanied by a nice bitterness that lasts well through the finish of this fine stout. Espresso is not as dominant as chocolate, but well represented. Some fig & raisin flavor comes to mind, and it pairs well with the strong roasted malt. Alcohol is present, but complementary in a minor fashion.  M - Smooth and very rich with a thick oily mouthfeel. There is some bitterness, but it seems directly related to the chocolate flavor and not to any hops. Finish is full of residual sweetness with a mild drying effect.  D - Haven't had an Expedition without the aging, but it seems to have held up in fine form over the past 3+ years. Alcohol is fairly high, but thats to be expected. Certainly worth seeking out, as this is a fine example of a hearty American stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jrallen34,4.28,"I drank this on tap into a tasting glass.  The beer is black with a medium tan head that has lots of retention and great lacing.  The aroma is very malty, lots of sweet chocolate with vanilla and hops right at the end.  The taste is off from the aroma with lots of coffee on the front and big hoppy finish.  The feel is very heavy and viscous with a decent drinkability.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Mavajo,4.35,"Pours a total jet black. Head is a surprisingly dark brown - one of the darker brown heads I've encountered, especially the crown. Decent head retention - even after sitting for 15+ minutes, there's still an all-enveloping film over the top with a generous dark brown crown. Thin, stringy pretty lacing...a bit more would probably notch a perfect 5.  Nose is extremely rich - roasty, chocolatey, surprising notes of hops. Taste is similarly bold and impressive. The roasted malts hit first with chocolate, coffee and hops. Dark-chocolate bitter aftertaste. Notes of prune start to develop in both the nose and taste as it warms. The alcohol is a bit more noticeable than I would like, but it's not a significant problem. Very full bodied - chewy and creamy with medium carbonation.  Really enjoyed this. Top-notch - bold, rich and impressive stout. There's no subtlety here.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,chickenflea,4.08,"Coffee, soy sauce, prune aroma. Black color with dark, one-finger head that dissipated quickly. Sweet and heavy but dark chocolate finishing notes keep the sweetness at bay. Thick and chewy on the palate. Good carbonation keeps the beer alive in your mouth despite its heaviness. Long finish. A very big beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,d0ggnate,4.22,"After a less than careful pour, my glass is filled with this appearingly viscous beer and topped with a single-finger deep tan head.  The aroma abounds from my glass, rising up as chocolate/cocoa powder. As I get closer, I find cold bitter coffee notes with more chocolate (syrup-like).  Deliciously bitter with flavors of dark, bitter chocolate. Subtle dark roasted coffee lives here, too. The end notes are slightly sweet and lip-smacking.  I found this offering from Bell's to have a solid body, while being both rich and creamy. Drinks very well and I would love to have this available to me more often. Might make a great dessert beer or even pour well into a dessert recipe.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Anthony1,4,"Appears a pitch black with a thick tan head that slowly fades into a small oily, tan film and thick tan collar. Lots of spotty lacing and webs left around the glass. Smell is of intense roasty nuts, chocolate cake, caramel, molasses, espresso, along with minty and piney hops. Taste is of rich, chocolate cake, laden with rum drenched espresso beans. Lots of hops in here. Mouthfeel is thick,smooth, velvetty, richly of chocolate, bitter cocoa, a potent punch of hops and mild, mild carbonation that makes this almost like syrup.

287,1444,darklordlager,3.35,"Bell's Expedition Stout (2009)  A Pours like motor oil. Viscous, syrupy. Black, and dark brown on the edges when held up to the light. Brown head that recedes after a couple of minutes.  S-Mix of sweet milk and dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit-raisons, figs. Light coffee. Molasses. Alcohol meshes well with the dark fruit, mellowing it out. Sweet.  T Sweet chocolate upfront, a little alcohol heat right away. Dark fruit, roasted malt. Sloppy finish--The bitterness from the dark malt and hops mesh with the dark fruit and alcohol, making it somewhat unpleasant.  Syrupy, and very mildly carbonated. Somewhat creamy as well, but the syrupy element is definitely at the forefront.  D-This could definitely use some time to mellow--quite a few months at the least.

287,1444,davey,3.55,"Bought this beer at the wine and cheese place in St. Louis on 10/19/09. Appearance is black with a whispy dark brown head, that is gone as soon as I put the beer down. Smells of burnt coffee, alcohol, and malts. A little bit of cocoa powder. Tastes of burnt coffee, dark roasted malts, some smoke, and the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Also some unsweetened chocolate. I did catch some bitter hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy rich. Not very much carbonation though. Overall I was not disappointed with Expedition Stout. I have heard that it's a little rough fresh, and I couldn't agree more. With some age, it could be impressive.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Genghis22,4.18,"A - Pours a thick deep dark black. Huge coffee colored head that lasts for days. Fair amount of lacing afterwards. Pitch black, no light comes through at all.  S - Licorice, dry wood, burnt coffee and roasted malt in the nose. Slight tinge of alcohol. None of the usual suspects here, but very interesting, can't wait to sip it.  T - That is a RIS for sure. Big hit in the mouth from the alcohol. Smokey, with touches of oak. Hops come in the back door and take over your tongue with a harsh bitterness that is only fueled by the alcohol. The aftertaste reveals the usual tastes associated with this style: cofee, dark chocolate, smokey roasted malts. There is a sweetness that washes over the tongue, finishing an epic journey.  M - Nice, thick, full bodied, slightly oily. Moderate carbonation, very fine bubbles.  D - Hard to say. I liked it. I appreciated it. I think it would improve with age. This is a HUGE beer, with lots of room to grow, currently though, I'd say one and done. There is just too much alcohol to drink more than one in a sitting. Really curious to see how this would hold up over the next few years.  Big thanks to Stephen for hooking be up with a couple bottles of this.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,kiddynamite920,3.75,"Pours pitch black with very, very minimal head. Seems very low on carbonation. Smell is strong of soy sauce and coffee, I don't remember smelling the soy so strong last time I had this beer. Has a raisin type smell on the end. Taste is not very reminiscent of the aroma of the beer. Very roasty and toasty. I get a coffee grind and dry cocoa taste. A large bitter hop profile as well. The beer fills the mouth and sticks around, with a nice syrupy finish. Not too drinkable IMO, halfway between a sipper and a standard Imp stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,chicagobeerriot,2.77,"Drinking this fresh to get a baseline to compare flavors as this beer ages. Completely opaque, even when held to the light. A vigorous pour produced a thick, rocky, mocha colored head that produces substantial lacing.  The smell is complex, but causes some concern for what's to come. Some light soy sauce and over-charred coffee beans are in the mix with some more pleasant molasses notes.  The taste is a mixed bag. Thankfully, the soy smell does not translate to the flavor profile. There's a bit of soy there, but not enough to be offputting. The first sips begin well, but the balanced sweetness is soon overwhelmed by the char and alcohol finish. The finish is too bitter, too boozy, simply too much. I've heard so much about how this beer ages and I sincerely hope that the conventional wisdom is true because it's kind of a mess fresh. The alcohol and burnt toast flavors have to moderate and the sweetness has to develop before this beer is worth your time. Hopefully that's exactly what will happen. Will check back a year from now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jiggahertz,4.24,"A: 12oz bottle poured into a snifter after having this for ~8 months in the cellar. Deep dark chocolate brown with a sudsy dark cappucino single finger head. Lacing is faint.  S: Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee have a nice fragrance.  T: Really a lot going on here. Alcohol up front and everything else that was present in the nose. Quite a bite of chocolate, hops are almost non-existent. Finish is dry and long, slightly on the bitter side.  M: Finish stays around for quite a while, almost too long, really coats the mouth.  D: Was impressed by the complexities in the taste, the finish was slightly less than desirable, but one of the top stouts on my list.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,OnThenIn,3.93,"Appearance: The beer is jet black and was poured with a half finger of a dark tan head. This is even darker than the Bell's special double cream stout, which I had during a side-by-side (mixing them, made a glorious concoction that was better than the it's parts, with about a 50-50 mix).  Smell: Huge caramel and sweet nose. There is a roasted malt note and a hint of chocolate. This beer had a tiny bit of chalkyness in the nose. I was expecting a bit of coffee, but it seemed to either meld extremely well to the point of not being noticeable, or was rather covered up by the sweet malt smell.  Taste: There is a lot of sweetness, which did battle and won with a decently strong alcohol presence that did happily did not seem offensive. The roasted barley kicked in right after, which lead to a nice added depth. There is definitely a bit of molasses and caramel present as well. The finish is sweet, and this beer seemed immensely more complex and sweeter than bell's milk stout (Bell's Special Double Cream Stout).  Mouthfeel: This is a full bodied beer that is very rich and still has a nice bit of carbonation. This is a sipper through and through, but so enjoyable you won't be able to help yourself.  Drinkabiltity: Due to the rich mouthfeel and high abv, this beer is a sipper, but man is it a good one. I really enjoyed this beer and if you can pick up a single, I would not hesitate to buy it, but the 6 pack price is a bit much for a beer which is somewhat difficult to finish due to its size.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A year old bottle from a six-pack that I've had in my closet since early this year(Jan Feb?) or maybe the end of last year.  Pours with out a head. There's a trace of foam but really what I'd expect from an older bottle. Paper thin lace.  Dark color, what a true stout looks like. Some slight sediment in the bottle.  Faint aromas. Molasses. Ru balls.  Medium-heavy body. Roasted flavors. Dark chocolate dryness.  Some fizz, carbon flavor. Might let the other 5 sit a year.

Smells pretty sweet-raisins, malty goodness, prunes. Taste is by far the best part of this stout-starts of sweet, followed by some bitterness from chocolate that start pushing out the sweet. I like the balance of this. Mouthfeel is pretty good, smooth and velvety on the tongue. I could drink this all night long.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,feelmefoam,4.28,"Had this one in my fridge for a couple weeks, decided I'd save him for my 50th review on the site. Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a Stone Pint glass.  This bad boy pours a deep, tar-black color that has no real highlights to it, just simply black. Although you can tell it's thick on the pour, it still threw up about a finger of chocolate colored foam that provides some really sticky lacing as the beer mellows.  The nose isn't extremely aromatic, but you can still pick out some of the chief ingredients, namely chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and some roasted malts.  When the Expedition first hits your tongue, the thickness of the beer has an interesting way of moving the flavors around in your mouth. First, the dark malts and coffee flavors do battle, followed closely by a bittersweet chocolate flavor that is quickly outdone by a mellow fruitiness. An earthy hop tone finishes everything up, with the alcohol providing warmth throughout the whole taste experience. Pretty interesting. Delicious, but I'd also be intrigued to find how well it ages.  The mouthfeel is very thick and syrupy, but not in a way that is detrimental to the beer. Rather, it has a certain creamy aspect to it that helps it move smoothly around your mouth. The alcohol and slight amount of carbonation provide a constant tingle and warmth on the tongue.  My first RIS, this is an interesting experience. I really love the bold medley of flavors going on in the beer, and despite its big flavor, ABV and mouthfeel, I find it surprisingly drinkable. I'll probably purchase another one and lock it away for a year or two to see how it changes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,smm,3.99,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my new Darkness snifter (looks even better with beer in it!). Batch #8729, packaged last September.  A- Dark brown/ Black. Pours out like chocolate syrup.  S- Sweet like molasses, with touches of alcohol.  T- Initial reaction is quite pleasant. Definitely hitting the hops up front, lays in with the sweetness of brown sugar and the roastness of coffee beans, without the coffee flavor. Nice aftertaste, lingering bitterness.  M- Real smooth and thick, low carbonation that only really hits in the back of your throat.  D- Super drinkable in my opinion, I could down a few of these in a row no problem. Not too sweet for a high ABV beer.  Overall I quite enjoyed this brew. It held up fabulously over the year and is a great deal for an RIS at $15 a sixer.

287,1444,Lolli1315,3.47,"A- A dark opaque black with a brown head. Head is generally small and the lacing could use a little work. Still looks pretty nice though.  S- Strong smell of alcohol comes through at first, followed by roasted malts and almost a burnt smell. Roasted coffee is specific and works well with the roasted malts. Faint hints of chocolate also are apparent as well.  T- This is one of the strongest tasting stouts that I have tasted, if not the strongest tasting stout. Alcohol is very prevalent in the taste (about as much as it was during the smell) and creates an interesting taste. The roasted malts are strong, almost overwhelming. At the end of the taste, there is a large bitter chocolate after taste. Interesting stout, but I think some things need toned down a little bit.  M- Chewy mouthfeel, nice and thick. The most concerning aspect here is the lack of carbonation.  D- The strong tastes in this beer would leave me with the wanting to have another stout rather than grabbing another one of these. No problem finishing this though.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ThreeWiseMen,4.28,"Acquired a three year vertical ('07-'09) of Expedition Stout in a trade with nflmvp. Steve, I love you. Decided to share the vertical with my fellow BAs at the Central Coast BA Gathering at the Pour House in Paso Robles, CA this past weekend. Following review written from notes.  Sampled only a couple ounces of each beer. Poured into an 8oz. Rémy Martin snifter each time.  Appearance: Totally opaque and thick as hell! No noticeable carbonation in any of the samples, and not much head to speak of either: a small brown cap that disappeared quickly each time. Light, spotty lacing.  Smell: Molasses, loads of roasted malt, and espresso greet the nostrils first. Hints of barbecue and flowery hops jump in and out of the picture. Alcohol is also apparent, but not dissatisfying. This was the one characteristic of the beer that really changed over the years, becoming duller and more alcoholic with time (or at least that's what my drunken notes read).  Taste: Big molasses, charred oak, and solid hop bitterness. Very roasty and bold. Not harsh for a Russian Imperial Stout, but certainly assertive.  Mouthfeel: Quite possibly the thickest beer I've had (right up there with Bourbon County Stout). The lack of carbonation makes this beer even more dense, and at times I was reminded of yogurt... yes, RIS yogurt. Super creamy and slightly warm. I want to give this a 5.0, however I believe that some extra carbonation would make it even better.  Drinkability: This was sooo damn thick, but in small portions it worked out fantastically. I doubt I could have drank this whole vertical on my own, let alone more than one bottle, but I'm still gonna give drinkability a high score since my only complaints are based on assumptions.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,donkeyrunner,3.83,"Viscous, oily black--nice. Thin, muddy brown head that I had to force on there. Disappeared instantly...no lace, no retention, nada. My beer boner just died.  Aroma is hickory, chocolate, and espresso accentuated by a mild alcoholic kiss. Deep and provocative.  Sweet tips the scales vs. roast malt on this stout. Chicory, baker's chocolate bitter with dark fruit and espresso. Deadly alcoholic, you'll feel it before tasting it. Big, full mouthfeel.  Good, but I expect more from Bells.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,DrDoitchbig,4.28,"Appearance: This has to be one of the most viscous beers I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. It almost looked like jet black maple syrup coming out of the bottle. An aggressive pour yielded nothing but a chocolate brown cap that disappeared to reveal the black hole of a beer beneath.  Smell: Roasted malts, sweet chocolate and perhaps a bit of licorice.  Taste: Surprisingly sweet at the start, like a decadent chocolate liquor. Followed by a bitter backbone that balances that sweetness very nicely. The bitterness lingers for awhile after every sip.  Mouthfeel: Extremely full-bodied with low carbonation. It's so thick, almost like a heavy cream. Now I know what people are talking about when they describe a beer as chewy.  Drinkability: This stuff is incredibly rich and smooth. It's quite a treat. I could drink it all night. But with such a high abv that's probably not the best idea.  This has to be one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had yet. Granted I haven't delved too deep into the style, but this certainly inspires me to try more.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mbudner,4.6,"Poured into a snifter. Batch 8944 (1/29/09)  A- Pours a deep black with a beautiful 2-finger, medium-brown head. Great lacing as it dissipates, lots of depth and fluff to the coating on the glass. Looks nice and viscous as it pours and as I swirl it.  S- Sweet molasses, dark fruits like figs, sweet chocolate. Slight booziness comes through in the nose. Caramelized sugar. Mild salty, soy-sauce like flavors, which seem to be appearing a little early, but inviting.  T- Very much mirrors the smell. Chocolate sweetness with a little soy-sauciness. Slightly more roasty than I expected from the aroma. A little bit of booze. This reminds me A LOT of the Dark Lord '08 I sampled back in May 2009 (less chewy.) The finish is kind of disappointing, but thats my only complaint and its not bad in the scheme of things. The bitterness from the roasted malts become in more prevalent as I move through this one. As it warms, I get more tobacco and leathery smokiness. Really complex.  M- Great creamy, coating mouthfeel. Slightly more carbonated on the tongue than some of the bigger stouts, but not overly-carbonated in general.  D- Overall, this was a great stout. I had tried it years ago before having some of the hyped greats and I would say that the aroma and taste of this were remarkably similar to the '08 vintage of DL. It was noticeably thinner, however, and slightly more carbonated. The finish in the taste was also a little more plain that I had hoped for. A really remarkable brew that doesn't get enough credit, most likely because of the fact that it is not rare.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bsp77,4.17,"200th review!  This was bottled in Sept 08 and consumed Nov 09. Saved it a year, as I heard it improves the beer tremendously.  Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.  Appearance: Pitch motor oil black with chocolate covered head that leaves some very spotty lacing behind.  Smell: Huge roasted aroma of burnt molasses, semi-sweet chocolate, licorice root, dark fruit and noticeable alcohol.  Taste: The roasted malt taste also drifts toward burnt molasses, with some notes of sweet chocolate, anise and coffee. Ends somewhat bitter and with an alcohol kick. Even after aging a year, still seems a trifle raw.  Feel: Very thick and chewy. Low carbonation, quite smooth and extremely warming.  Drinkability: Overall, a luxurious (if somewhat raw) late evening sipper.

287,1444,Mistofminn,4.23,"I've had this on tap (most recently at Stub and Herb Darkness Day Eve, I think I had 08) but for some reason I've never had a bottle of this! Thats all about to change.  Picked up a sixer, extremely fresh (cases at the store had 10/29/09 on the side, literally 2 weeks ago) so this is as fresh as it gets. I've heard Expedition is a stellar in the cellar, so lets see how it is fresh!  Poured into a Darkness tulip, how fitting, as this is about as dark as it gets. Deep deep brown, nearly black-hole black, with a very creamy two finger smooth brown sugar colored head. Head has good retention, but nothing spectacular, and leaves tons of lacing. Great looking beer.  The nose is very strong on sweet and toasted malts, chocolate, molasses and raisins. Pretty complex and pleasing smell. Light warming alcohol in the finish.  The taste is sweet and toasted malts, bitter chocolate, raisins and lightly toasted coffee beans, molasses and more dark fruits. Very complex. A nice earthyness in the finish, with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Come to think of it, this is pretty bitter, but you wouldn't get a clue from the nose, which is very sweet smelling. Alcohol comes out in the finish.  Mouthfeel is rich and thick, with a high carbonation that gives a sharp bite when swallowing. Drinkability is pretty good.  Overall, a solid Imperial Stout. I know that this beer is highly regarded on the ""other"" beer rating web site (pretty sure it's Top 10 in the world) but I think this site has the rating closer to it's actual rating. It's a great RIS, don't get me wrong, just not spectacular.

The head fades over the course of five minutes or so, but leaves behind intricate patterns of lace.  S - Very malt-driven nose, with roast barley, sweet chocolate, dulce de leche, molasses, anise, raisin, and plum; some faint coffee in the background. Earthy, fruity hop aromas are just noticeable.  T - Plenty of maltiness on the palate as well, though there's also a rather high level of hop bitterness complementing a roasted char character. Sweetness of chocolate, caramel, and vanilla provides balance. Molasses and espresso flavors come out as the beer warms, along with a note of sherry. The finish is long and balanced.

287,1444,IDS,4.08,"Expedition was a beer that I would have fairly regularly and enjoy before really getting into craft beer and one that I have not been able to try in the last three years due to my move out West. Since my palate has changed since then, I decided to fork out the money and have some Expedition shipped out.  I got my bottles yesterday and immediately cracked one open. The FexEx shipping on a crisp fall day provided the beer with a perfect temperature in which to enjoy. Poured into a pint glass, Expedition looked just how I remembered, black, with a quickly dissipating caramel colored head.  The taste was fantastic. Big malt taste and what reminds me of baker's chocolate hit me the most. The syrupy texture and low carbonation of this beer, in my opinion, lends itself to the taste as opposed to hampering it. When I got to the bottom of the glass I found myself full and delighted.  While I do not believe this to be the most accurate representation of an RIS, I do believe it to be one of the most creative ones. I am glad I have 5 more waiting for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BARFLYB,4.28,"Bottle poured into a small snifter. This bottle has to be at least two years old right now, I could not hold out anymore. I found this to be to sweet fresh.  Bell's Expedition is a dark pitch black oily looking beer. It looks mean and tough coming out of the bottle with a gooey togetherness. Thick with staining power, don't spill this. A gorgeous dark mocha colored head rose up about an inch or more with a thickness and milkshake look on top, creamy, lasting. Coats of dirty lace on the way down.  Expe has mellowed nice in just two years time. The nose discovered Chocolate cake with enough roasted malt scent to stop a horse. Caramel and slight toffee With the roast comes some smoke and molasses. Really not getting any coffee from this, perhaps that's the 1st thing to go with time, the hops are next with minimal screen time. Just a hint of dark fruit with some figs among others. This smells great.  Big amounts of roasted malt on the palate with some smoke and sweetness. The chocolate is huge and rich, bittersweet. There is some coffee espresso with some warming. Taste with figs and molasses and just a bit of wood. Some alcohol in the back but hidden over two years. In the after, I get some soy sauce which is more noticeable cold. When fresh, this was a bit to sweet and off putting, that's not the case now, great integration.  A big bold thick feel on this one, somewhat robust, creamy and large. The feel is almost bordering on syrupy, but it goes down like a charm, what's going on here? Just a bit of alcohol after all is said and done and a touch of heat, not hot at all. Hidden very well but not 100%. The hops are not completely faded as there is some bitter sense hanging around. Sweet but subdued.  Drinkability takes a slight hit due to a high ABV, but I wont dock points for that, this is a Russian after all. Whatever I did not like about this when young (alot) is completely opposite now. I would not do more than one of these a night though and won't drink it in a bottle younger than two years. You need to take your time with this to see what it holds.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S- Dark chocolate, burnt and heavily roasted malts, a touch of char and sweetness, also a hint of cocoa.  T- Leads with syrupy dark fruits, coffee, and dark chocolate. Midpalate has a touch of candied citrus on it and the beer finishes with caramel sweetness and piny bitterness.  M- This beer brings meaning to having a syrupy texture. It is viscous and rich. Carbonation is a bit high but the beer is young and in addition it spins out fairly easily.  D- The flavors are bit high on the high notes and ever so slightly disjointed but not to a fault.

Brew is opaque black with thin webby lacing that doesn't cling.  S: The color green and unripened come to mind throughout the nose. Also chocolate, hops, mellow coffee, and nutty caramel. Very grassy and too unripened.  T: Very grassy and green again throughout. Like unripened coffee beans. Also chocolate, bitter coffee, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, unripened green figs, pine, and hoppy in the finish with a punch of alcohol. Not what I expect from a RIS. Not malty and why do I taste unripened green anything?!?  M: Medium to full bodied, oily, finishes a bit dry but its clean. Rather carbonated and that really prevents the flavors from melding here. Coffee beans linger a bit in the finish.  D: Not the best interpretation of the RIS style. Its not malty enough and the carbonation in the mouth takes away from the whole picture that the different flavors try to paint. It also makes this brew less robust.

287,1444,spartanfan,3.42,"batch 9359 packaged 9/17/09  A: Pours an opaque black with a tight dark brown head which leaves much lacing on the walls of the glass as it fades to a thin layer.  S: Smells of rich roasted malts and coffee  T: Tastes slightly smoky off the bat. Lots of flavors going on here; chocolate, coffee, caramel. Also, piney hops are detectable in the swallow and leave a bitter aftertaste.  M: This might be the creamiest beer I have tasted yet, it almost feels as though I'm drinking cool whip. Leaves a sticky sweet coating in my mouth after each swallow. There is a slight warming character from the alcohol.  D: While I'm really digging this beer, it's just a little to thick and heavy for me to drink more than one in a sitting. It's definitely a sipper",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,KickbacksSteve,4.62,"Batch #8311, 2/7/08. Poured vigorously into a Unibroue tulip to stimulate a light brown thick head atop a black body. Never had one fresh and probably never will after smelling this liquid gold. Aroma is of dark chocolate, toasted malts and the sweetness of a RIS with some age on it, and its bursting out of the glass. Beautiful smell, simply spectacular. Taste follows closely to the aroma and it should be noted how easy it is to drink this one is considering the ABV. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and almost seems chewy. Buy this one by the case and find a place to stick it for a few years. Drink from the old cases, keep buying new ones. Do it. Just do it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,droomyster,4.29,"Pours an inky black with a rich, frumpy brown head. Smells are remarkably toasty (rather than roasty) with a dark chocolate aroma as well. The taste, on the other hand, is very roasty indeed. Big flavors of dark and burnt chocolate, with some sweet phenolic action going on. My favorite Bell's beer. Very good stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bung,4.4,"Flying Saucer Charlotte. All black pour with 1 finger brown head. More booze and bourbon in the aroma than I ever remember this having. Heavy roast, molasses as well. This is BIG this year, either that or it's just so long since I've had it on draft. Full body, thick oily mouthfeel. I could swear this was barrel aged. A large amount of oaky toffee accents the heavy roast malts chocolates and espresso. Mild hops in the bite at the finish. Not nearly as much dark fruits as I've noticed in the past and much more of this barrel like qualities. Excellent, big sipper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Flavor is smoky and surprisingly bitter, and has an undertone of chocolate and a hint of molasses. Texture is very smooth and tingly, and leaves a rather bitter aftertaste, not hoppy bitter but a tad unpleasing.

287,1444,andrewm190,4.17,"This beer came highly recommended by a knowledgeable friend; he did not lead me astray. This is a great beer. It pours a thick and aromatic head, dark in color, as is the liquid itself. Impenetrable by light. Very deep, rich chocolaty taste that lingers. Minor detraction is that it is a bit heavy on the alchohol, but then, it is a Russian Imperial Stout, and that comes with the territory. Highly recommend the beer, another winner from Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BlackBearForge,4.5,"Per the Bell's Brewery website this bottle, batch 8864, was packaged on December 4, 2008.  This stout pours a deep opaque Stygian black, like used motor oil or a moonless night in the countryside, without a hint of any light coming through when held up to a lamp. The foamy frothy head is a deep chocolate milkshake brown, lingering a while and then leaving a thick curtain of mocha lacing in it's wake as it subsides.  The aroma is of dark sweet chocolate and dark roasted malts along with an earthy grassy hop note and also just a hint of alcohol.  Wow, the flavor profile on this beer is intense. This stout slowly floods your mouth with the deep bittersweet chocolate heralded by the aroma. Chocolate on chocolate and roasted grains, topped by sweet chocolate and finishing with bitter chocolate and an alochol warmth which takes it's place. There's bitter espresso and chocolate candy bars, Hershies Kisses and caramel coffee and deep dark mysterious fruit. The alcohol warms, barely noted as a taste but as an integral intensifier of the waves of flavour inherent in this beer.  Mouthfeel is heavy, full bodied, thick and chewy but velvety smooth and creamy too. A little chalky, it's a lot like drinking a big alcoholic chocolate milkshake made with coffee.  Wow, I think I may have discovered my new favorite RIS! This is a great beer for savoring. Each sip provides a massive flood of sensory input, very nice and very warming on this first cool day and night we've had here in North Florida this year. I'm drinking this with nearly a year of aging on it, I can only imagine it with another year or so. Simply amazing!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,apbarwood,3.78,"I'm drinking this one hot off the presses, just a couple weeks after it arrived on the shelves. It looks black, or at the very least a dark brown-black. Not much head to speak of and just the faintest amount of caramel-colored lace. The aroma isn't exactly weak but it's not strong. I'm definitely picking up some roasted malt and a bit of dark fruit, maybe raisins. There's also a bit of alcohol in the bouquet that carries over in the flavor and while it's not really unpleasant, it doesn't seem to add anything. I hope and assume that will mellow with age. The flavor leads with some bittersweet chocolate and a trace of a sweeter caramel. It's followed quickly and overpowered by a strong, bitter, roasted malt and coffee flavor. The raisin-ish dark fruit flavor is still around and comes through a bit more as the beer warms up and seems more noticeable on the finish. There's definitely a nice complexity to this beer that seems to attach itself to every part of my palate and it has nice mouth-coating and warming qualities. When fresh, it definitely seems to show it's youth and is quite aggressive and biting but I can definitely see this beers potential to age nicely. I'd let this one sit for six months or so at least to let it mellow out a bit and allow some of it's more subtle qualities to step forward.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,punkrkr27,4.68,"Pours a thick brown black that looks like used motor oil with a small brown head. Aroma is loaded with roasted hops, malts, coffee beans and molasses.

Nice medium full body.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,kegger22,3.97,"Poured a very dark brown with a tiny head that dissipated to the barest of collars. The aroma was chocolate, coffee and alcohol. The taste was a blend of bitter and sweet. Bitter chocolate, bitter coffee and I believe the alcohol added some harshness. Sweet from the malt. The feel was thick, viscous, heavy with light carbonation. Drinkability was average due to a high ABV and the robust flavors.  I originally sampled Expedition Stout 3 months ago and found it so strongly flavored, I could barely drink it. I decided not to review at that time, to give my palate, and the beer, a chance to mature. I am sure the beer hasn't changed that much in 3 month, but my tastes have, and I'm glad I waited. While still very strong, I can now appreciate the complexities. I bought a sixer and have four left, they are still in the cellar for at least a year. We'll see how Expedition ages.  BTW, I'm thinking my first impression of Expe Stout would have been around 2.2 to 2.5, and now is a 4.05.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,theghost3,3.21,"Pours an extreme dark brown, almost black. No head to speak of, just a light brown ring that disappears quickly. No lacing.  The smell is rather sweet from lots of chocolate along with some dark fruits (cherry, plums) & molasses. The taste is nothing like the smell--bitter citrus-like hop flavor with burnt coffee & some booziness. The lack of sweetness is a negative. Mouthfeel is kind of carbonated at first, but then ends up flat at the end; weird.  This should probably be aged to cut down on the bitter flavor. Not the most drinkable at this moment. An RIS should have some trace of sweetness. My concern is that if the carbonation goes away this quickly, it will be nonexistent with age.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BigAl723,4.48,"Purchased from the local market, single bottle. Poured into my Founders KBS snifter.  A: Dark as night. Zero and I mean zero light comes through. Pretty simply put, its real dark. Almost no head.  S: Very dark fruits, bread, earth, molasses, all of the above. Real floral stout. Slightly hoppy but not too much. Malts with real heavy character at the nose.  T: Well first off, I drank five Sam Adams' Octoberfests before drinking this so it should be a ""treat."" Dark bitter chocolate, coffee, toffee, sweet malts, hops, wow! One of the most complex stouts I've ever had in my life. Blows my mind every time I drink one. It's so dark, so evil, so hoppy, so bitter. I love it!  M: Real heavy! This baby leaves a coating in my mouth. Heavy mouthfeel with real nice carbonation. Very pleasant.  D: Not real drinkable but this isn't the kind of beer you sit back and drink a six pack of. If you're just drinking one 12oz bottle or maybe two, you're money. It's pretty drinkable for how heavy and complex it is.  Overall, like I mentioned earlier, one of the best stouts I've had for how bitter, heavy, and complex it is. The 11% can take a toll though.

287,1444,bulletrain76,4.62,"12oz bottle. I really wasn't terribly impressed with Bells's other stouts, but this is pretty damn good stuff. I'm going to skip the beer color and go right to the head because that's really all that sets stout apart; I mean, you know it's black, right? has a good sized brown head off the bat, but settle into a solid ring of tan foam in a couple minutes. Big, vinous, chocolate, port-like aroma, with cherry and other fruity accents. Like a delectable black forest cake in a glass really. The flavor is the same rich dark chocolate with fruity, port-like complexity. You can tell that there are plenty of hops to balance the malt, but they don't really protrude at all. There is a light alcoholic bite in the finish that reminds you how strong this is and dries enough sugar off on your tongue to invite the next sip. Thick, mouth-coating body. Definitely the most balanced imperial stout that I have had to date. Amazing beer actually",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,JohnQVegas,4.09,"Bottle into red wine glass. Thanks again to Jeff (mnjeff) for the sample!  Pours impenetrable black, with almost no visible carbonation, just a thin soapy head.  Nose is roasty, with a big, hoppy acidity on top of everything. Lots of citrus, chocolate, coffee... really, really hoppy for an RIS.  Taste is excellent. Starts off with a big dose of bright, hoppy citrus acidity, bit of pine, borne on the back of a huge, chocolatey malt body with nice coffee bite. Significant resiny hop bitterness lingers on the palate, more of that big, bright citrusy acidity, this time with a stout, roasty counterpart. Reminiscent of Night Stalker, Smutty IS - well done. I can see why this is such a huge favorite to age.  Mouthfeel is great - so smooth and creamy, a light undercurrent of carbonation that lets the acidity from the hops do a lot of the work. Massive body is bigger than full.  Drinkability is mainly hurt by just how massively hoppy this beer is. Big, big bitterness works against that aspect. Still, a tasty treat.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The nose is full of chocolate, raisins, dates, burnt sugar, roasted malt, booze, tobacco, some coffee.  The first sip gives me tons of roasted malts, raisins, chocolate, some maple, some vanilla. There are some slight bitter hoppy notes in the tail end and a tiny bit of soy, but it works well. It's extremely rich and filling with no harsh booziness although it is quite warming.  Mouthfeel is big and slick with moderate carbonation.  Up until now I've only had fresh Expedition because I hadn't the will power to age any longer than half a year. This is almost sublime with 3 years on it and I wish I had more.

287,1444,BeerFMAndy,4.25,"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial Pint. Batch #8728 - Packaged Sept. 16th, 2008. 10.5% ABV. Thanks to Sweemzander for this one!  A - Poured with the color and near consistency of molasses it was a visible clear dark brown while hitting the glass until it was full. The result was a pitch black beer with a loose-bubbled, one-finger, milk chocolate colored head. It stayed around for a good amount of time considering the alcohol percent which left visible legs on the glass. A thin layer was left while little lacing adorned the glass.  S - Huge roasted malts pour out with out any regard for overwhelming your senses. Carried with them are a toffee and caramel with brown sugar sweetness along side a sharp, unmistakable molasses aroma. Drifting in the background is a coffee bean burnt-ness and what seems like a light hop aroma. Up front with the malts is a slightly warm boozy spice scent too. Full of brute strength yet complex.  T - You may call this a malt punch in the mouth. One of the most robust beers I've ever encountered in my beer expedition, it's heavily bitter from the roastiness with a caramel sweetness that takes the back seat to the molasses kick, coffee roast, and alcoholic boozy spice. A touch of toffee can be sampled here and there but is pretty scarce amidst the malty onslaught. Woody notes are also present as well.  M - Full-bodied in every sense of the word, it features almost no carbonation detection and coats the mouth and throat like syrup. The roasted malts give off a hefty bitterness that balances well with the sweetness and finishes with a very warm alcohol spice. The lingering alcohol kick is a bit much to finish out with in conjunction with the cocoa powder dryness.  D - While I love and respect this beer for what it is, it is not drinkable. It's thick as molasses and twice as strong but don't get me wrong; it's a great sipper for a cold winter day. Otherwise the alcohol is a bit too present for my tastes.

Poured into Maudite snifter  A - another perfect pour from this guy: pitch black body, big two finger dark tan head. the head, if one forces a pour, makes this great cascading effect. The only thing I can possibly find wrong with the appearance is that perhaps the head does not retain as long as it could, but the retention is normal and it leaves a juicy half a fingers worth of foam on top, so its good enough to be perfect for me!  S - espresso, bakers chocolate, and some boozed up raisins with molasses are the most identifiable. the front of the nose is the chocolate and coffee, concentrating on the bitterness of both; there is also a slight nuttiness evident in with these ntoes. the middle is slightly sweet, showing some slight frutiness and alcohol. the background nose is a fresh, grassy hop note that is pretty easy to key in on once it is recognized. the nose isn't readily accessible as I would like it, it doesnt pop out from the glass.  T - quite a phenomenal beer for such a low price; they even come in six packs! the first thing one notices with the beer is the definitive presence of alcohol and those coffee flavours. initial taste is bitter, boozy, and slightly coffee like; perhaps a cinnamon like burn from. the finish is very much flavoured with choco-coffee and a slight alcohol burn. the aftertaste is like I just had a big espresso; bitter, and a distinctive lemon peel citrus bitterness from the hops. all in all quite a good beer, but the flavour profile could be more of a whallop  MF&D - the feel is perfect, no doubt about it; just thick and viscous enough, not less, and not going into american double territory. the amount of booze and the presence of it will eventually wear one down, however.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The head that is left leaves almost nothing as lacing down the glass. The smell is typical of the style, coffee and chocolate mainly stand out. There is also the typical roasted smell found in stouts. As far as taste goes it starts off kind of boozey with chocolate following shortly after. The chocolate stands out more right after the booze and especially when it warms up. There is some coffee in the taste that is in there but it's not jumping out or anything.

287,1444,bum732,4.33,"Pours black as all black, nice creamy tan head leaving amazing lacing. Smells of anise, roasted coffee, dark fruits, touch of metal, molasses, chocolate. Tastes of sweet roasty malt followed by a low bitterness of coffee. Hints of dark fruits and sweetness of chocolate. Finishes nice and roasty, very roasty with just a touch of chocolate sweetness. Nice creamy mouthfeel, no alcohol present, which is hard to believe. Carbonation just right.  Just an amazing beer, so well balanced for a RIS. Tons of complexity, dark fruits, coffee roastiness and chocolate sweetness. I love the roastiness in this beer, it keeps the dark fruitiness and alcohol in check. Unbelievable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Plenum,4.45,"Bell's just makes good beer. Their Expedition Stout is an excellent example of the style. Probably the best stout for the money...eventually they're going to figure out that the public will pay more than $2/bottle for this exceptional brew...but for now...hat's off to them.  Color was very dark. 10+% came through on this one. Not by much, but you could tell this was not a small beer.  Taste was excellent. Not too thick. Little bit of lacing on the glass.  This is a go-to-brew for those of you seeking an everyday stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,projectflam86,4.55,"A- Pours a deep black color that doesn't allow any light through. Completely opaque with a creamy mocha colored head that leaves lots of sticky lacing.  S- Huge aroma of chocolate, espresso, and roasted scents. Alcohol is noticeable.  T- Bitter cocoa and coffee flavors initially that give way to some sweet malt in the finish. Big roasted flavor that develops into espresso, molasses, dark malts and bittersweet chocolate. Strong and robust flavor with plenty of alcohol coming through.  M- Big and chewy with nice carbonation. Very full body with a creamy feel. Incredibly smooth.  D- This is one killer RIS! Big and bold with a menacing amount of roasted flavor. The only thing that hurts its drinkability is the very noticeable alcohol level. One of these with a year or two on it would be fantastic!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,sgoodship,4.13,"Picked up a 6 in St. Joe's while camping in Michigan. I'd been wanting to try it for quite some time.  A: Dark brown almost black. Looks thick and viscousy on the pour. Has some brown/red in it and shows mahogany highlights against the light. The head is a golden copper brown - almost metallic looking. It took a pretty aggressive pour to coax it into providing a finger head. The head dissipated almost immediately. As the drink was sipped, it provided some spotty lacing and left oily brown coffee residue on the glass that slowly slid back to join the liquid.  S: Nice bold smell. Bitter cocoa, coffee. A hint of booze and bready maltiness.  T: The dark chocolate and coffee milk shake is what hit me first. The burn from booze comes in and there is a distinct strong burnt bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. The aftertaste becomes dry and the bite becomes an almost metallic coffee. A touch much at times but it is certainly makes you want to go in for more.  M: Full bodied and velvety smooth. There is enough carb there to liven this thick brew up a bit.  D: Love this RIS. It's pretty smooth. Booze sneaks in here and there but overall it is pretty well hidden. The pronounced bitterness was a touch much for my personal tastes at times but it didn't stop me from pounding this back quicker than I intended to.

Appearance: Ultra dark brown/black beer, opaque; a hard pour produces a huge dark mocha head with great retention...damn, this beer is thick and viscous  Smell: Big roasted character, with lots of dark roasted coffee and a touch of vanilla cream  Taste: This is just awesome; there are tons of big roasty flavors, vanilla, coffee, some burnt grains, dark cocoa powder, and some alcohol BURN on the finish...it's sweet and mild until the finish and then the alcohol comes through like a punch to the face  Mouthfeel: Creamy and full  Drinkability: 1-2 and done, but nice for what it is  Conclusion: Great RIS...the alcohol is a bit hot, but this is fresh; I'd really like to see what a year or so in the cellar would do to this beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mdwalsh,4.65,"Had this at Indulge first, never really wanted to until then, I've been dieing to get this. Batch no. 8944  A: Blackity black black black. Poured like motor oil with legs. This thing almost got up and crawled away. There's not real head, and no active carb, and thus no lacing. Holding this up to the SUN and I'm not getting any light. I just wish it had a bit more head.  S: Dark sweet fruit and mildly roasted malt. Burnt sugar and caramel is great. It isn't a too strong of a scent, but it's there. Not overly complex nor simple, just right. No hops, of course.  T: The burnt sugar really takes over and the fruit takes a backseat. The caramel-toffee chocolate -I almost say fudge, is great. There isn't coffee, which is awesome. Usually, I don't like RIS right right off the bat. This one, I would.  M: Like drinking chocolate syrup. That's about it. Flat and smooth.

Hot alcohal content is not hidden. Very warming. Fairly prominent in your face bittersweet/dark/chocolate/coffee/roasted malt flavor. Pretty aggressive beer as far as hotness and bitterness goes. Bitter finish that stays on your pallet longer after you have had your sip.  M- Low to moderate carbonation. OK body. Gets creamier as it warms up.  D- Fairly good example of style. A pretty good beer. Nothing oustanding though.

S: Roasted coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla extract, complementing a dark roasted malt character.  T: Strong roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. The roasted flavor really shines through, although it is lacking a (somewhat expected) smokiness. Faint sweetness counters a bitter note at the end.  M: Big and smooth; heavy as anything.

287,1444,movingtrain,4.15,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Piraat glass.  Nice and dark with a fine, two finger head cascading down the sides of the glass. The head is slowly diminishing, but still sticking around pretty well...and clinging to the sides of the glass.  Smells of vanilla, chocolate, dates, dark-roasted coffee (on the sweeter side), licorice (anise), cake batter. The alcohol is fairly present in the nose, but seems to be mixing well with the other flavors coming out here. It smells like a big stout...  Taste is bitter-sweet, with serious chocolate and coffee notes. Roasted malts, roasting coffee...tastes like a super sweet espresso. The alcohol really comes through here as it goes down...but it really isn't overpowering. Not sure I could handle another one of these right away, but it is drinkable.  Overall, this seems like a typical imperial stout style...and I think it's a pretty good representation of the style. Not too outlandish, but not bad by any means. It's just good. Check it out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Patrick999,4.07,"I choose my snifter for this one. The contents poured as viscous black oil, as any self-respecting imperial stout should. Small cap of espresso crema.  Not lacking in the aroma department, but really, what imperial stout is? Big hit of vanilla and even a little whiskey, though there's no wood aging here. Nilla wafers. I'm not really getting much of the chocolate and coffee I usually get from big-assed stouts, which is OK as this is definitely a nice aroma. There's banana, rum, and almond in there too.  It didn't necessarily smell like it, but this is indeed quite bitter and roasty. Charred malts bring the bitter first, then the substantial citric hop brings it home and keeps it there. Not much alcohol heat noted at all, but then again, I have no idea how old this bottle is - for all I know, it could be two years old. I was going to say that this isn't sweet, and I was going to say that this beer would be better if there was a little more sweetness balancing all the bitter roastiness, but there *is* definitely a creeping sweetness here that helps balance the beer out considerably. Again, beyond the hop bitterness I get much more vanilla and whiskey than I do chocolate and coffee.  Feel is soft and fluffy, just what I want out of an imperial stout. Please don't kick my ass with big bubbles in a 10.5% dark-as-night beer. Thankfully, this doesn't. Softness is almost as if it was poured from nitro-tap or cask.  As you would expect, this is a sipper. It could be easily shared with 2-3 as a dessert beer. This isn't, to me, overtly chocolate-y for an imperial stout...I could see this contrasting really, really well with a quality chocolate dessert. One bottle is a bit much, however, at least for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jbone78,4.35,"I love this one. I am not a fan of super bitter Imperials and this beer is not all bitter.  A- Pours thick black into my small snifter with a dark mocha head. The small amount of head leaves in a short time, but who cares? S- You can smell the dryness. Toasted malts, light coffee and not a lot of alcohol. At 10.5%, you can not smell it. T- As I mentioned, the bitterness is countered well with the sweet sugars and coffee/caramel malts? Not over the top with the black malts either. I like. M- Smooth. Not super malty or hoppy in my opinion. The key word for me would be balanced.

S: Burnt malts, chocolate is big, nice and hoppy, coffee, licorice, molasses, brown sugar. A little subtle for such a big brew, but otherwise well done  T: Much more bitter than I had expected, and to tell you the truth, I don't really like that too much. Alcohol is upfront and aggressive, and the malts are all over the place.  MF/D: Chewy, creamy full body that finishes semi-dry.

S--Wood, cocoa, molasses, roasted malts, a hint of booziness. Big and complex.  T--Taste mirrors the nose, with the roasted malts taking the forefront. This is a big, bad ass beer. Not for beginners. This is probably deserving of a 5, but I'm having a tough time pulling the trigger because it seems that one more layer of complexity is just waiting to burst out but is held back by the wood and roastiness.  M--Thick, chewy, creamy, syrupy, whatever words you use this puppy is FULL bodied and wonderful  D--I had this once before, early in my craft beer life, and I was underwhelmed. I thought it was too thick and boozy. I suspect that the less-than-world-class rating on Beer Advocate is due to the same reason. This beer is easy to find if Bell's distributes to your state, but it is not meant for a developing palate. But I can tell you that this is 10 times better than I originally thought. Definitely one of the best stouts in the world.

T - Bitter coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, roasted malts, alcohol come through immediately. Nice bitter finish.  M - Thick, like sauce, with some decent carbonation though not a whole lot. Mouthfeel has never been a highlight of Imperial Stouts for me.  D - Again, this is a sipping beer. Thick and viscous, Imperial stouts do not lend themselves to chugging.

Mid-stream shows a bitterness, with only the lightest amount of hops. Finishes with a very direct, in your face chocolate note. Aftertaste is roasted, with a light amount of coffee. Well hidden phenolic notes.  M - Some alcohol warming on the tongue. Carbonation bite is not present. Cloying and clinging, with a load of syrupy sugars.  D - A hard beer to call drinkable - although the way the abv is masked in this beer, it could easily sneak up on you.

It starts out almost like a milkshake, but it becomes a little bitter, smoky and more bitter. It IS delicious, but normally, I find that I like a stout more as it warms from fridge temp.

Moderate fruit notes - grape or almost-prune. Dry roasty powderiness. Finishes dry and lingers on leaving 15% of a just-smoked-a-cigar feeling in its wake. Tastes great. Feels even better. Top-notch drinkability.  A substantial beverage, to say the least, Expedition® is on a level playing field with the better stouts I've tried. It's rich, raw, and bursting with flavor.

287,1444,cvaypai,4.12,"Poured from bottle into snifter.  Appearance- Deep dark midnight black, cannot see through at all, even when held up to light. 1 finger dark tan creamy head that stays.  Smell- Smells of chocolate, dark roasted malts, toffee, caramel, very nice nose to it. I really like the smell of this beer. Surprisingly no alcohol detected in the nose.  Taste- Deep dark roasted taste with a bit of sweetness and then bitter. Chocolate up front is very subtle but delicious. Pretty well balanced beer, surprised for a beer of its stature.  Mouthfeel- Not impressed with its mouthfeel, stings my mouth for some reason and just seems a bit off. Though it is fairly smooth.  Drinkability- This is not a beer you should enjoy on the first day that hits the 90's of the year. Though I couldn't wait to taste it.

Chocolate and roated malt are the most dominant smells and both are strong. There's a little coffee in the finish. I'm also picking up a slight maple syrup in there.  Flat out delicious. Chocolate and dark roast coffee are the nose, and then a dark fruit taste that resembles black cherries. The finish has a slightly bitter aftertaste and black licorice. A very complex stout.  Mouthfeel is creamy with light carbonation. The alcohol is hid very well. It does show up, but barely. Dry finish.  I found myself drinking this one rather quickly and had a few in a sitting.

It pours a luxurious dark color with medium fluffy head. The aroma is very inviting with chocolate and rich, dark malts. The taste is excellent, even though I must admit I'm not always the biggest fan of imperial stouts. To be honest, I often prefer a flavored (coffee or sometimes chocolate) stout to a ""regular"" version. Whatever the case, Bell's Expedition is an excellent brew!

Dark fruits, espresso, bourbon, soy sauce, chocolate, and burnt flavors all in one sip. There is another round of flavors after you swallow. I get tastes of tobacco, vanilla, and other flavors my limited palate can't describe. There is a kind of unpleasent bitterness/booziness that I am sure would mellow out with age.

On to the beer:  Pours a small, mocha-tanned head on top with the usual pitch black body associated with the style. The aroma is good. Some cocoa, licorice, a side of fruit, and a faint fume of cardboard.  At first taste, this is an easy going imperial stout. A little roasty with some hops (piney)burst on to the scene as it enters your mouth. Baker's chocolate appears, and then it morphs into chocolate brownie liquid. Faint smokiness and molasses. Where's the booze? Bitter astringent coffee lingers on in the aftertaste. Full bodied with a tick of carbonation, it soaks and coats the tongue.  This will conclude the Third Unorganized Invitational, and now in the usual fashion, it is time to announce the winner of it all, and it is:  Girardin (black label) Gueuze!

Head retention and lacing are above average  Smell is big on roasted and chocolate malt. Also there is a bit of coffee, sweet nuttiness, and slight alcohol  Taste is bitter sweet and more hoppy than the smell leads it to be. Alcohol leaves a hot warming sensation down the throat. The malts are very roasted, almost burnt like overly done caramelized sugar. There is an after taste of coffee  Mouth feel is nice and thick, carbonation is slightly high for a RIS. Wish there was more creaminess to the head, it's slightly there but nothing impressive.  Drink ability was above average. Being 11 percent, the alcohol was definitely apparent and inhibited it from being more than a sipping type beer.

Pours a deep cola black with a three finger head that recedes to a half inch cap of chocolate cream mousse.  Aroma is of chocolate and cream. Husk and mealy sweet grain come through on the nose. There is a sweetness that comes through almost dextrose like int he nose.  Flavor is deep roasted grain followed by phenolic alcohol. Day old coffee and dark rum and raisins. There is a phenolic alcohol character that can't be placed, but it dominates. Creaminess in the finish and dryness from the roast is mixed with a huge hit of booze.  Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Very nice carbonation with ample soft edged bubbles. Consistency is thick and viscous.  I think this is too extreme for me, but it is to style. Although well within the style guidelines this beer just doesn't make me want to go back for more.

287,1444,MisterDeeds,4.22,"Aged over a year in the wonderful cellar of RixBeer.  Pours a solid black with no light showing through. Very slight head, cocoa powder in color.  Smell is nice and roasted. Coffee with a raisin or plum-like fruitiness. Also picking up on that boozy brandy-like aroma that hints at the aging.  Taste has a few different kicks going on. It begins with a very subtle semi-sweet raisin taste, and is quickly overcome by the roasted coffee bitterness. Very unique from most aged beers I have had, in that the warm alcohol kick comes more towards the front than in the aftertaste.  Very little carbonation to it, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on who you ask. I happen to like it with this brew, because I think that too many bubbles would make the bitterness too overpowering.  The mouthfeel is thick almost milky, and the roasted coffee (almost burnt) seems to line your entire throat. (Again this could be good or bad, depending on your taste, but for me it is very strong.)  A very nice treat (thanks Rick!) and I would love to try one a year down the line to see what else goes on.

This goes away quickly leaving a very thin sheet of lace.  S: Alcohol fumes abound. This one could do better with a toned down abv. If the nose is a clear indicator, this is gonna be one raw IRS, and probably not one of my favorites.  Also getting dark chocolate and espresso notes, and a sharp molasses sweetness underneath the alcohol phenols - sort of unpleasant.  T: Boozy. The alcohol hits hard and fast, with an almost bourbon twang to it. Black licorice and anise dominate any coffee or chocolate notes. I think I need to cellar my remaining stash to smooth this one out around the edges.  M: Thick and chewy. Fairly creamy and would be quite smooth without the alcohol burn on the way down. Overall, very good fit for the style.  D: Slow sipper, need to move on after one.  Overall, this is a decent IRS, but does not live up to the hype. I'd easily place Stone's RIS and Old Rasputin above this one. Heck, give me a Kalamazoo or Double Cream/Expedition Blend over this one.

T - Alcohol, dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, bitterness all melded pretty well together. Maybe a little too much alcohol burn on this right away, but I'm digging the other flavors afterwards. Pretty dry finish, bitter aftertaste with some chocolate notes. Too much booze for me, needs some cellar time to chill out.  M - Just about right for me with enough fizzy carbonation to satisfy. I would say medium bodied, but a very ""light"" medium. Def better then the Bourbon Barrel Aged Cherry Stout I just had.

Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. Coffee and roasted malts also but dominated my chocolate. Smokey and woody also.  Mouthfeel: Smooth mouthfeel. 10.5%abv is pretty much hidden.

I'm getting a hint of sweetness too... can't really pick it out but maybe raisin? Pleasant.  T- This is a good stout. Wood, smoke, espresso. Slight bitterness from hops, a little alcohol bite. Aftertaste is great- dark and roasty.  M- Smooth, oily, creamy. Little or no carbonation. I like it for the style, but personally I would prefer a little more carbonation.

Silky smooth, mouth-coating, thick, robust, rich and warming from the ethanol.  D: A great RIS here, just wish I could get it more living in CA.

After the finish, I have a nice slight alcoholic flavor in my mouth.  M - Smooth, creamy, and a very well carbonated. Not overly carbonated, for the style, I believe it is perfect.

287,1444,BZero007,4.28,"Bottle poured in to a Guinness glass. Beer pours extremely dark, looks like oil and chocolate mix. Poured and formed a perfect head that was a chocolate brown color to it. The perfect head gave a great aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and dark fruits. The head dissipated after a few minutes and left a wonderful chocolate lace on the glass. Taste was wonderfully complex, as a mix of roasted malts and chocolate powered forward with a support of dark fruits and the slightest hint of coffee. Carbonation was a medium intensity which helped the flavors shine in this particular beer. The flavors and carbonation levels seemed to feed of each other and every sip I felt one was stronger then the other. I really enjoyed this Stout as it was not overwhelming on any front, and forced my self to purchase a six pack to last til this winter. Mouth feel was fine as the carbonation and alcohol was not overwhelming at all.

Nose was faint, doughy, some sweetness, dark chocolate, and smallest bit of smoke. Taste followed suit though a bit of bitterness and alcohol picked up in the middle but good flavor and certainly on par with the style. Overall mouthfeel was somewhat lacking without carbondation.

287,1444,pmcadamis,4.47,"A - Pitch black, very little head, and a small amount of lace. This looks evil, thick , viscous, and vile. As an RIS should. Oh yeah. This still-life in black has me anticipating what's to come.  S - Black licorice (a trace of Kalamazoo stout perhaps?), coffee with French vanilla cream, and a hint of black gooey candy. I can't think of what it's called, but there is a gelatinous black candy that is sort of like black licorice, only more gooey. Damn. Anyhow, this smells like that.  T - Again, coffee with vanilla creamer. Black licorice, sunflower seeds, and top shelf maple syrup... sans the maple if that makes any sense (molasses?)  M - Thick, creamy, solid, and smooth. This has only a touch of alcohol warmth despite the elevated ABV. The finish is surprisingly smooth and not as bitter as most RIS's or even regular stouts for that matter. Its almost as if this is an Imperial Oatmeal Stout (IOS?).  D - A damn fine brew! I tend to like milk stouts and oatmeal stouts for their smoothness and lack of sharp bitterness that can often be found in ""regular"" stouts, since although I am a caffeine addict, I am a person who puts tons of creamer and Splenda in my coffee.

This is part of batch 7251 and was packaged on 2/25/06. No abv info is given.  A-Pours black with a very dark brown 3/4 finger head that dissolves quickly into a small dark ring that hovers for the duration that it is in the glass. A lone island of foam also sticks around.  S-When I first cracked this open, it smells exactly like a chocolate malt that I would get at an old fashioned soda stand. Once it is in the snifter, it smells like a big imperial stout. Vanilla notes and alcohol are noticeable and as it warms, roasted malt and smoky notes are quite evident.  T-Sweet chocolate malt hits the tongue first and the initial sweetness stays for awhile. Alcohol is picked up as it goes down and it gives this beer a nice warming feel. I found the level to be perfect and did not find it to be abrasive. The roasted malt flavor is generally not super dry on the tongue and it gives off great notes of coffee.  M-Not as heavy as expected. I would put it in the medium spectrum. It is very smooth and does not have very much carbonation.  D-What a great nightcap. After 3 years this one is a great sipper that I would love to have more access to in California.

The head is a dark tan color, that is foamy and creamy. The clarity of the beer is opaque. There is lacing on the glass.

287,1444,Buschyfor3,4.3,"Poured from a 12 oz single into a Hoegaarden pint glass.  A: Pours a thick, viscous deep brown that sloshes into the bottom of the glass; this beer looks like motor oil. This stout is absolutely opaque when held up to the light; no lighter hues around the edges of the glass, just a deep, rich brown. A thin, creamy tan head forms on top but is quickly pulled back down into the beer.  S: Roasted coffee, burnt toast, dark chocolate, caramel, dark fruits (cherries, dates).  T: First note is bold, roasted coffee/espresso followed by mellowing melted chocolate and dark fruit, like chocolate dipped cherries; malty sweetness upfront lingers through the body; finishes dry, like roasted oats or burnt toast.  M: Thick and chewy with little carbonation; this beer has a creamy consistency on the palate that is quite pleasing.  D: Decent for a high ABV stout (10.5%). The alcohol is hidden fairly well at the start, but it does begin to assert itself with a peppery flash and a noticeable warming sensation once you delve deeper into the bottle. A sipper, but I imagine that some cellaring would really round off the alcohol and push some of the complexities to the next level. Still, what Bell's has created is a pleasant RIS. A bevy of roasted flavors blend into a creamy, delicious body that IMO lives up to the hype. My friend's told me to check this stout out, and after having a good first impression with Bell's via their Kalamazoo Stout, I must say I am quite pleased with their bigger, badder Expedition Stout. The cost is a bit steep ($15.50 for a 6er) but a local place sells single bottles for $2.50 a pop, so I may very well purchase a couple more bottles just to see how this beer ages.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bamadog,3.83,"Appearance: Very thick on the pour and very viscous - like motor oil, probably the thickest I've seen since I first poured a FBS; A good size two finger head is present at first and it's dark tan, possibly the darkest tan I've seen; solid retention as it's just about done fading into a pretty thick and chewy looking skim on the sruface; a thick spongey looking lacing is coating the glass where the head once was.  Smell: Alcohol is actually the first scent I picked up on and with an ABV of 10.5%, I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Behind that is dark, very roasty and burnt coffee-esque malts.  Taste: Again like the smell, the first thing that I pick up on is the alcohol, but it's not especially overpowering, just the most present flavor; behind that is a slightly subdued burnt roast; I would almost swear there is a very faint hint of some kind of a dark fruit, but if it is, it is buried very well amidst the strong roastiness.  Mouthfeel: Almost a little gritty, there's definitely some sediment floating in the darkness that is this beer; the alchol causes some burn in the mouth and definitely in the chest as it goes down and adds a slightly drying affect to the mouthfeel, but beyond that it's got a decent coating that again feels a little gritty.  Drinkability: It's a very good beer, but definitely sits heavy like most RISs are apt to do, so I don't feel like I would want to sit through too many of these because I would start to feel like a bit of a load.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TequilaSauer,4.64,"From 2007. Aged 2 years.  Pours thinner than expected but with very light head that quickly dissipates.  Smells of chocolate liquer, alcohol, dark fruits (fig) and maybe brandy. The nose reminded me a lot of Old Rasputin.  The taste is out of this world. Attacks HUGE with equal parts of extreme bitterness and heavy dark chocolate. Very balanced, VERY balanced, much more than the unaged Expedition. Finishes with more bitterness and a woody flavor.  Very thick mouthfeel, like molasses, but very smooth with little carbonation.  The aging did this beer a lot of justice. Expedition is a phenomenal stout, but the aging adds a lot more to the balance and attack. It's not a beer of which you could probably enjoy more than one at a time and I still don't think it stacks up with some of the other heavy hitters in that style, but it's got it where it counts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Coffee and chocolate become more present, but the biggest factor is still with the dark fruit.  Velvety chocolate flavor. Not what I expected from the nose. Very nice hints of caramel. Big taste on this one. Seems to be almost the reverse of the nose with dark fruits becoming more present with time.  So creamy wow, one of the creamiest beers I've ever had. Very low carbonation.

287,1444,biegaman,4.4,"Beyond just inky or oily, this is a total solar eclipse. It is utter darkness. Needless to say, no highlighting or transparency is afforded. The surface is, unlikely considering its strength, crusted in a spring mud-like substance. A beer that's simply black doesn't require much inspection, it can simply sit and be admired for what it is.  And it smells big enough to block out the sun as well! Tremendous (frankly intimating) notes of bitter espresso, port soaked berries, black licorice, charred oak barrel and artisan dark chocolate truffles resonate through the senses. With a long list like that you ask: is there any stone left unturned? Nope. It seems they've thought of everything.  A rich and heavyset flavour profile offers decadent notes of dark chocolate and espresso. While still young, a backdrop of green, lightly zesty hops is easily discerned. These seem to grow a tad more piquant with warmth. Ironically, so too does the beer's sweetness which is now starting to resemble such flavours as double-double coffee and creme brulee.  At only 6 months of age this has plenty of potential yet to blend and develop flavours. From experience I know it will. The beer won't only sustain a little time on the cellar shelf, it'll most likely benefit from it, too. The alcohol's a bit forward (not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that) and the flavours could stand to meld a little more.  I don't care if it takes an expedition to find this beer, it's worth searching out! Bell's Brewing should be conferred the highest possible accolade of beer for their lineup of stouts, of which the Expedition is arguably the most impressive.

287,1444,pjohnston007,4.8,"One of the Kings of brew. I must vehemently disagree with the brothers on this one.  A: Tar Black, ""Abysmal Void"" liquid with beautiful caramel head and lacing. Good lacing that retains well.  S: Oaked molassas, honey, coffee, vanilla, peat. Bourbon-esque.  T: Deep and complex: Creamy, thick, sweet, balanced acidity (neutral), oaky.  M: Creamy, velvety, clean finish. Luscious and not at all dry. Carbonation (indeed!) that livens up the head (nearly over-poured due to explosion of carbonation).  D: Special occasion--great one-at-a-time, but not something I would keep on-tap (although I would love to try this on-tap!).  Great brew. This evaluation is based on a bottle that I have kept ""cellared"" for well over a year--perhaps two years. As dark and ""strong"" as this beer is, it is an absolute pleasure (ease) to drink. Very enjoyable beverage, whether after dinner or after mowing the lawn.

It has the molasses black oil look, with a faint bit of dark brown bubbles that shoot up and form a tiny ring right after the pour. It settled down too quickly though and appeared somewhat lifeless. Should have a bit more life to it.  Smell - Real BIG! Heavy burnt espresso notes, and a noticeable alcohol personality behind it. Also has that cherry oak scent to it that is present in some stouts. Hops also play their part too, backed by a bittersweet chocolate.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Smooth as silk with a sticky oily mouthfeel. I really frickin love this beer. Coffee and sweet chocolate are the biggest part of this beer, and hit you the whole way through the front half of the taste. The second half is a hoppy licorice taste with a oak and wood flavor. Maybe some vanilla dropped into to smooth things out as well. Hardly taste any alcohol at all, and it's a sledgehammer of a sipper.  Drinkability - This turned out to be a bad ass mofo of a beer, especially since I put some age on it.

287,1444,marvin213,4.13,"I think this beer looks purty darned good. WAY black like a big-time stout should be. A thin layer of dark foam tops her off. As I look at this here stout sitting in my Smoke on the Water (Greenville, SC) pint glass, I must say it appears mouth-watering appealing to me.  The smell, quite frankly, is good. I don't know what exactly it is that gives Russian Imperials their distinctive smell (I know, I'm sure it's explained on BA somewhere), but this one's got it. And I like it. Nothing else though--no chocolate, no coffee, etc. It's a good-smellin' Russian Imperial Stout.  Interestingly, I seem to taste some coffee. The taste is suprisingly light, which is good, I suppose, for a 10.5% RIS. Is there a such thing as a Stout Light? I like it, but it lacks character. Unless, as I discover with each sip, it is that it's a Stout Light (w/ a big ABV). Yep, that's my conclusion: this beverage is a basic RIS with the maximum amount of water allowed by the style. That would explain why it travels so well and ages so gracefully. It's like a Bud Russian Imperial Stout Light. I think that's purty cool, but it helps with drinkability more than taste.  The mouthfeel is good, but light. How is this signature Bell's Stout so like water to me? I'm simply not that tough. The more I analyze this beer, the more I'm convinced that it is indeed a Stout Light. The mouthfeel is a malty good with a surprisingly watery residue. Since I enjoy it, it's good.  Drinkability is better than good. If I were to enjoy a Russian Imperial Stout while throwing frisbee on a sandy Hawaiian beach, this'd be the one. I marvel at the 10.5%. As I try to make sense of the discrepancy b/w BA and the bros on this one, I figure that the Expedition is quaffable enough for us Plebians to appreciate it, but not quite distinctive and unique enough for the bros (i.e. Patricians) to outright endorse it with an ""A"" or a ""B"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gyle41386,4.36,"Randomly decided to grab a bottle of Expedition Stout from the cellar...probably because I wanted to make brownies with it. Regardless, this bottle is from batch 8728 (Sept. 08) and has been poured into a snifter.  This beer is black. Like, Kueth Duany black. Or Charlie Murphy Darkness black...you get the point. So black, you think it could possibly be a really dark blue. About a finger of rich, chocolate mousse foam absolutely will not go away, and the walls of the glass are completely coated. Hard to imagine a better-looking stout.  Big, rich chocolate nose. Dark and milk chocolates, with plenty of roasted barley. It's got a great balance between bitter/sweet chocolate and bitter, smoky, coffee-like roast. I can't decide if I'm actually smelling licorice, or if I've just associated it with this beer via Kalamazoo Stout. The nose is big, it's robust, it's not really alcoholic at all (BIG bonus, can't wait to see what more time does)...It's definitely mellowed down and has become a bit sweeter, and more subtle/complex.  Bell's Expedition Stout is pretty much everything I want my imperial stouts to taste like. Big chocolate sweetness, balancing roast and bitter hops in the finish...just a HUGE flavor.  The only thing bigger than the flavor is the texture. This beer may have the absolute best texture of any beer I've had. Deliciously rich and very, very chewy. And, again, after a little over a year and a half, the alcohol isn't nearly at noticeable as, say, Stone IRS. Perfect carbonation. Never-ending finish. Unbeatable.  I thought Expedition Stout was actually pretty drinkable fresh. With 21 months on it, it's hard to keep it in the glass. Really, really tasty stuff. Can't wait to put some more years on my remaining bottles.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,numinorian,4.15,"A Opaque black with a thick dark brown head. The lace sticks like paint on the glass that leaves thick swaths of tiny sticky bubbles  S Strong thick smell that has a sugary sweetness, aside from the malty coco and coffee flavors that you would expect from the style. A slight nutty scant as well.  T Coco taste is prevalant, with a strong hoppy kick. Strong alchahol taste.  MF Has the concistancy of motor oil. Thick and increadibly rich and brash, this one is not for the faint of heart.  DA not very easy to drink. Definitly a sipper.  Overall this is a magnificent beer. This doesn't try to be an easy going beer and it doesn't try to make everybody happy. When bells set out to make a powerfull stout they pulled out all the stops.

In the light it's as close as you can get to Black and still be Brown.  Smells of a roasted coffee and molasses in January.  Tastes of cocoa in smokey-coffee and rum...? Really good. Smooth and delicious. I love this beer.  Feel's great going in... nothing too special.

S: Alcohol, roastiness, a bit of chocolate, something between licorice and soy sauce.  T: Roasted malts with hints of licorice. As the beer warms up, chocolate notes start to show up. Finishes with huge hop bitterness. Pretty big alcohol burn.  M: Thick, almost viscous. The hops dry the mouth out in a hurry.

287,1444,dotsonjamesg,4.97,"Special thanks to jcdgoad for recommending this brew to me....  I purchased this brew from liquorama.net. Not that bad of a price either but shipping costs made it a little pricey, but hopefully worth it. I would really like to point out that Russian Imperial Stout is my favorite style, so you can imagine that I tend to have somewhat of a bias concerning them. In my defense, I would like to let those who read this know that I also grade them very harsh. If this one is truly as good as I have heard, it must be truly impressive; though I have noticed the wide-array views so I am very skeptical and curious.  Served in a chilled 14oz snifter  Appearance: Whoa...probably one of the thickest, darkest ales I have ever poured. The brew had a thin, ½ finger head that quickly dissipated. I have heard some complaints stating the brew is over-carbonated. Since my head was so weak, maybe my pour wasn't aggressive enough. Still looks good to me.  Smell: Probably one of the most aromatic stouts I have ever experienced. I poured the brew and set it aside, as not to be hindered by the heat of my ""super-laptop."" The brew is sitting about 18 inches away from my nose and I can still smell it...not very common, even with the most aggressive of stouts. The nose is full of chocolate, fig, currants, dark roasted malts, a tinge of hops, and alcohol.  Taste: Much like its intense nose, the brew is rich with dark roasted malts, chocolate syrup, and alcohol. Starts with a smooth and intense chocolate flavor and moves in to brutal bitter, dark roasted coffee-like flavor. The bitterness is harsh and lasts for quite some time. I can see why some people have given this brew some varying reviews. It stays true to its legacy in being a Russian Stout, but it might be a little too bitter. Russian Stouts should be strong, and extremely sugary. This brew is absent of the EXTREME levels of caramelized sugars, commonly found in many Russian Stouts. The enormous, backed-up bitterness may be too intense for most people.  Mouthfeel: Thick, velvety, and very smooth. Carbonation was also pretty nice and matched well.  Drinkability: It is a definite sipper. If you can stand the extreme bitterness, it is heavenly, but you have to possess the ability to drink some of the heaviest of ales ever brewed; and this most certainly qualifies. This brew is extreme, and that's being nice. Don't let the simplistic label or bad reviews fool you...this epic-brew is anything but simplistic. Its character is tremendous and unfathomable by most, and enjoyed by even fewer.  Excuses for the bad reviews? Russian Stouts are definately an aquired taste. This one is pretty intense and not as balanced as others and will probably drive away most people who aren't use to the extreme levels of burnt-bitterness, flavor of alcohol, and syrup-like viscosity.  I would recommend this only to a seasoned Russian Imperial Stout drinker. I would also recommend a very nice cigar with this lovely brew, it would match perfectly.  Enjoy this as much as I did.  Cheers!  -Dotson",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,AdmiralDiaz,4.42,"A: Pours almost jet black with a large brown head holding good retention and minimal lacing.  S: Strong roasted malts with lots of alcohol, chocolate and a decent amount of hops.  T: Very similar the the scent. Strong chocolate and roasted malts with a very good hop balance adding just the right amount of bitterness all with an alcohol overtone. Very big and very good.  M: Very heavy with little carbonation and extremely silky. I've heard many complaints about the carbonation level, but it's just where I like it for a big stout like this one. It's also fairly drinkable for the style and how big it is. Could easily do a couple bottles.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,macktbone,3.33,"As part of a trade with Aforbes and hoped to be enjoyed with ThirdLap. I was told this would be one of my top stouts...not so much  This beer is jet black with a dark brown head that quickly dissappears in an alcoholic haze. It stains the glass an oily brown.  The smell is super soy with figs.  Taste & mouthfeel leave a lot to be desired  So little carbonation that it is hard to get down. Hold your breath prior to contact, the soy is overpowering. Bitter end with a sweet aftertaste that grows on you a little.  Extremely thin for a ""good"" stout. When I pour a beer and it glubs, I expect it to be thick, or at least feel thick on the toungue.  I was glad this was split two ways.

287,1444,scifan,4.1,"Pours very thick like used motor oil. Very black no light could possible penetrate this beer. A very aggressive pour only revealed a slight dark brown head. Smells very sweet upfront, sherry or port, dark fruits, this stuff even smells thick. I am getting some of typical stout aromas in the background some chocolate and coffee aromas are there just not in the forefront. Taste really good. Lots of complex malty goodness. Very sweet, syrupy. then there is some nice dark chocolate flavors, followed by a some coffee bitterness to balance it out. This beer is very viscous almost chewy, but it's also very delicious.

287,1444,drtth,4.42,"Lighly chilled and poured into a Duvel glass for tasting. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. Bottle has no batch code but given when and where I purchased it the bottle age should be between 13 and 18 months.  Appearance: Black (a black hole?) with a thick dark brownish head which may be the darkest head I've ever seen. The head dissipates very slowly with solid lacing. Eventually there is a thin surface cover with a ring of foam around the edges of the liquid.  Smell: Dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, and with very faint hops at this age (maybe I'm even imagining them).  Taste: The flavor is much more powerful than you'd expect from the aroma. There is an intial sweetness layered over strong roasted malt bitterness with tastes of espresso and dark molasses and a touch of caramel. The bitterness at the end has the character of both burnt malt and a residue of the hops. What I don't find is any strong alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a long slow bitter finish.  Drinkability: This is a beer to sip and enjoy but its hard to imagine drinking more than one in an evening. Indeed one may be more than enough.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The alcohol is very apparent in this beer.  Kind of an oily smooth feel, very low carbonation, the flavors linger in my mouth for a while after swallowed.  Drinkability - A very heavy beer, personally I could only drink one or so in a sitting. I enjoyed it in small sips best.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,crayphish,2.72,"I waited a fairly long time to get my hands on an Expedition. Expectations were huge. The stout pours a fairly thin black, carbonation barren liquid. The lack of any sort of head and carbonation really hurts this brew. Hard to get a handle on the smell. I get some roasted elements, along with a vegetable oil bleh. Not appealing. The taste is weak chocolate, roasted barley, and the vegetable unpleasantness again. I'm hoping that this batch might have gotten funked. Hopslam is an amazing imperial style brew, I can't see Bell's missing this badly. This beer was hard to finish.

The smell has a mild roastiness and hints of licorice.  First taste is nice, smooth but strong. The spiciness remains present. It almost creates a tingle on the tip of my tongue. Not your typical stout, there is more present here. A thick, rich flavor.  It is heavy and as noted above, rich. Full of underlying flavors. Mild coffee perhaps, with a bit of roasted essence.  A really good representation of a stout. Bought a single bottle at Capone's in Norritown.

287,1444,Aenema,3.97,"Picked this up in DC earlier this month. Appearance - Pours jet black with a thin cap of brown foam. Smell - Aromas of roasted malt, cocoa and bourbon fill the nose. Taste - Roasted, chocolaty malts transition to a nuttiness before finishing with a bitter hoppy note reminiscent of black coffee. The alcohol is a bit too noticeable at the moment. Mouthfeel - Silky smooth with light carbonation that works very well. Drinkability - A very rich brew that is difficult to drink more than one of at a time. Overall - A very tasty stout, though one that I am looking forward to aging both to allow flavors to emerge/meld and so the alcohol recedes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells predominately of coffee and dark chocolate with hints of caramel, toffee, and fruit. Bit of hops in the background.  Rich coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel on the palette. Fruit and hop bitterness follow and finishes slightly astringent from the alcohol. Alcohol is a bit more overpowering than I would have liked. Leaves a nice mocha aftertaste.

287,1444,ElGrecoVerde,4.18,"This beer is black. There's no highlights or anything. It has a nice, rich bitter chocolate aroma blended with coffee.  The most notable flavors are dark chocolates and dark fruits. Rich coffee, a little sweet caramel and toffee, and a unique nuttiness make this a great tasting brew.  Maybe mine was a bit flat, but the mouthfeel is the only thing holding this back. It was more oily than creamy, but still above average, and leaves a nice coat of flavor behind.  Definitely a sipper brew. But watch out, the 10.5% ABV creeps in unnoticed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

When pooring it, I could see some reddish hues in the beer as it ran down the side of the glass.  Smell is chocolate, alcohol, grain. nice.  taste: chocolate, alcohol, spicy, roasted barley, and a taste I find in all russian imperial stouts that I can't identify. I don't know if it's a fruit taste or what. I like this taste more than the taste of Old Rasputin.  Mf: very unusual. Very low carbonation gives this a heavy, thick, oily feel.  D: I had to drink this pretty slowly, and I wouldn't want to drink any more, at least not until the next day. I liked this more than Old Rasputin.

287,1444,damienblack,3.33,"At first appears lowly carbonated, minimal head that takes a minute to billow up just a bit, like one finger or less, thin and dissipate, doesn't leave much in the way of bubbles or lacing on the side. Smells like chalky cocoa powder, and a blast of yeast. Not a great start on the first 2 senses.  Impressions: Reminds me a lot of Yeti in that it's a hop forward Impy Stout. Also in that way, most of the flavor comes from the harsh roast malt. Not much impressions of coffee or chocolate flavors at all. Slightly grassy, very hoppy in finish. Almost lingers like an IPA on the palate. Not much depth of flavor for me, unfortunately. I can see where the bros comment on a lack of creaminess, this feels pretty flat and dead to me. Dead hops linger on the palate, there is no refreshment, no cleansing to it. This may be the least enjoyable Impy stout I've had thus far.

287,1444,sweetbrew82,3.97,"12 oz. into a snifter/ no freshness date  P: Syrupy black from the bottle, pitch black with streams of pecan brown light trickling in through the edges. Even with a vigorous pour, there was barely even a thin sheet of chocolatey brown foam that was gone immediately, dissipating into an island on top.  A: Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, subtle citric hops, and alcohol.  T: Opens big with deep, roasted malts with chocolate/fudge, molasses, and citrusy hops that lay low. It also seem to get more nutty in the middle with some black licorice flavor, too. Black coffee comes out on the back-end to provide some bitterness. The alcohol pokes its head a little too far out of the water for me, but it's not overwhelming. It does show some warmth, though.  M & D: The mouthfeel of Expedition Stout is good. It's full-bodied, syrupy, thick, and chewy. But, it's just falls short of reaching the upper eschalon of RIS body's.  Notes: While Bell's has produced a pretty solid RIS here, it's just not up to snuff with the elites in such a top-heavy category. Still a really good beer, and if I could buy a sixer for a decent price it would be in my rotation.

Mild notes of dark chocolate and coffee, mix with a large presence of (very) dark roasted malts. A touch of molasses. Sweet notes of brown sugar, with hints of vanilla and caramel. Definite hints of a bourbon-like quality. Light presence of dark fruits.  Huge dark roasted malt profile. Nice amount of smokiness. Loads of chocolate flavor. Sweetness of brown sugar.

Well, it certainly acts like an Imp Stout out of the bottle. 2-3 finger head, cocoa in color with incredible retention... black motor oil. Sometimes, I think I need another way to describe this, then I realize I don't... That's what it is. Looks a bit like a milkshake. I think the entire inside of the glass is covered in thick lacing.  Aroma was a bit more muted than I had anticipated. Light cocoa.  My god is this smooth and lovely. Where to begin? Is this a chocolate milkshake or a great beer? Is there an intersection between the two? OK, I can't pretend not to know the rating of this beer which is why I traded for it. I also saw that ""the bros"" rated this a ""C"" I know sometimes I'm in a bad beer mood. I'm going to have to say that Jason must have been in that same type of mood that day. Just my opinion. Roasted, chocolate... Roasted chocolate. Slightly nutty. Some spices Love it.  Man, this is creamy and smooth.. Big and thick mouth feel...  I could drink this all day long if not for the ABV.

Quite a complex aroma but very nice...cant' really compare it to anything else.  T - Very complex, difficult taste to me. The sweetness from the malt is present initially but the aftertaste is all chocolate, hazelnut, and slight espresso. Very nice transition with a hop bite right at the end as well.  M/D - Very thick and velvety on the palate. Doesn't have a lot of carbonation, which is typical of stouts. Drinkability is limited to the heaviness of this beer but overall very nice.

I smell bittersweet chocolate, coffee, alcohol and burnt caramel or chocolate malt which is remarkably similar to the taste. The alcohol seems to become more pronounced as it warms which could be good if that's what you're in to.  It has a body like syrup or 2-cycle oil with a bite of bitter.

The meager head was reddish in color and the stout poured with the consistency of SAE 30 only darker. The ale was opague in appearance and had the color of dark mahogany.  The aroma was of roasted dried fruit, cherries, plums and maple and was pleasantly smokey. The flavors exploded in your mouth. Dried cherries, maple syrup, caramel, roasted nuts and a backgroung note of alcohol. A combination that I never tired of during my tasting.

Taste: Like a dark chocolate covered cherry right away with subtle coffee bean and more bitter than you would expect, due to the assertive hopping I assume. Hops don't make much of a flavor appearance but when they do peek through it's more orange than anything. There's also and iron-y flavor that hits at the end, not bad, just interesting.  Mouthfeel: Thick, viscous, appropriate carbonation, very smooth.  Drinkability: Be careful with this one. I've been known to want one after I'm done with the first but your entering tipsy town.  Overall: This remains one of my favorite imperial stouts and is a must try. So go get it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,CHSLBrew,4.15,"Poured into a snifter.  A-Deep brown head, small but substantial and dense, but it receded quickly. The beer is black, and it looked akin to diesel fuel as it flowed out of the bottle. Opaque and dark as a moonless sky.  S-The snifter overflowed with roasted malts, alongside chocolate and dark dried fruits.  T-Heavy roasted malts with a huge chocolate flavor. Hop bitterness is moderate with some dcefinite hop character. Alcohol is present, but quite smooth. Finished is roasty, choco-coffee and lip-smacking.  M-Full, full body. As I said earier, akin to diesel. Chewey to the fullest extent. Alcohol is evident and the warming property is big, with a slight boozy feel in my mouth.  D-GOOD BEER! I really enjoy this brew. It's exceedingly easy to drink, while its flavor profile demands the drinker's respect. Approach with caution: you will fall for this beer. Good thing it comes in six-packs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, slightly woody perhaps.  T - Roasty, bitter chocolate, coffee all come to mind. It again has a slightly woody character to me. There's a hop bitterness in the end that keep this in check.  M - Velvety smooth. Low level of carbonation.  D - Obviously not high drinkability but very good for the style and abv.  Definitely plan to hang on to some of these to age for a while.

Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Thick and smooth mouth feel. Low carbonation level present, and a noticeable bitterness and dryness left on the palate.

287,1444,taylorhamrick,4.31,"Pours out a pitch black color with a massive foamy brown head. Very beautiful. Some decent retention and lacing. Looks like a beer you want to drink. The smell is the least exiting aspect. Really I only get a smell of alcohol and carbonation. You might be able to detect some sweetness and roasted coffee type smells if you try hard. The taste is really great though. There's a caramel sweetness, almost like cola, but its backed with a deep roasted flavor. There is a sort of barbequed soy sauce taste which is a bit harsh but nice and interesting. The taste is accompanied with a nice pleasant burn. The mouthfeel is amazing. There's a wonderful creaminess and a ton of complexity. The carbonation is not overly done, which makes the alcohol burn not too harsh. And I found it to be a great drinker. You want to reach back into it and taste more. Recommended to anyone interested in stouts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: Dark dark dark, with about a half inch of very brown head that hung around for a few minutes before dissipating, leaving a ring of foam around the edges. Looks like some nice, low-level carbonation and pours pretty thick.  S: Maybe my nose was a little off, but not as much going on here as I remember. But what I do smell is dark toasty malts, hops, and alcohol.  T: Roasted malts, some chocolate and coffee-like notes, a little sweet. Pretty solid.  M: Creamy, low carbonation but lively.

287,1444,Chad_Benson,4.78,"This is my favorite beer, hands down, the stout by which all others are judged and fall short. Follow me if you will, but imagine that chocolate and espresso decided to make sweet, sweet love...and they invited over their friend roasted malt, that's what it's like (perhaps a graphic comparison, but I love this beer). It is heavy, hold it up to your eye and watch an eclipse with no fear...not that you'd see a thing. The alcohol content is heafty, I'd avoid (next time) having...oh...say 8 in 3 hours and attempting to stand up straight, but this is an exceptional beer in my opinion, and better enjoyed in moderation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

On the sweeter side some caramel, dark fruits and molasses. There were also some hints of ginger bread, alcohol.  T- Complex layers of sweet and roasty bitterness. Sweet caramel and molasses hits the tongue first then some dark chocolate, roasted barley and hints of dark fruit, maybe cherries. Some alcohol warmth in the end.  M- Thick.

287,1444,ThirdLap,2.89,"Got this through a great trade with aforbes10. Thanks Andrew!  Split this one with BA member 'macktbone' in two standard pint glasses. The minimal amount of dark brown head dissipates quickly, leaving only thirty-weight motor oil. Swirling the glass coats it with a translucent brown coating that is slow to disappear.  Lots of soy on the nose, with molasses, dark roasted malt, along with some sweet alcoholic beverage that I can't put my finger on. Some have said sherry, but I'm not sure that's it.  As promised, I'll be honest about what left my lips upon taking my first taste of this beer. I think the exact words were something along the lines of ""holy shit"".  It's not bad, just not well-balanced. I get way too much soy here. Very tangy and astringent with lots of burnt flavors... I get some coffee and caramel. The alcohol is very in-your-face.  Mouthfeel is much how it looks to be, thick and viscous. This beer really coats the mouth. Carbonation is minimal, and I really think a bit more would perk this beer up a bit.  Getting through my half was a bit of a challenge. I will probably return to it someday, hopefully on tap. Right now it just reminds me a bit too much of a SA Triple Bock. Hopefully the HopSlam arriving tomorrow will provide a better example of what Bell's is capable of.  [EDIT: I'm really thinking my bottle had gone bad.

287,1444,abfraser,4.62,"A: Dark, viscous black with a dense mocha smallish head.  S: Sweet molasses, roasted malt, some dark raisin-like fruit. A nicely complex beer.  T/M: Awesome stuff. Very well balanced, with a good creamy mouthfeel. Not a ton of carbonation but enough that it's not syrupy or cloying. The smells are all there in the mouth, with a nice lingering sweetness that is never overpowering. Very complex.  D: Despite the 10%+ abv I could drink several of these. Not something you'd normally say about a RIS, which is a testament to how well this one is balanced.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jkendrick,3.82,"Appearance: Pours dark and viscous. A moderately aggressive pour yields a half inch brown head. There is no light shining through and little carbonation visible rising up in the glass. The head recedes relatively quickly, but leaves some foam stuck to the side of the glass. After a few sips, nice lacing is left in its wake.  Aroma: The aroma isn't as strong as many Imperial Stouts but what is there is malt. and some alcohol. I smell dark and sweet fruit. I don't smell coffee and chocolate as was expected. Maybe just a touch of molasses.  Mouthfeel: Not a ton of carbonation, but it is oily and full-bodied.  Taste: The taste is where the chocolate - dry, powdery cocoa to be exact - that was absent in the nose makes itself known. The fruit, so dominant in the aroma, is relegated to the back. The alcohol is definitely present, but for a 10% abv, it isn't bad. I think the alcohol could have been hidden a bit better. The molasses flavors are most dominant in the middle and there is bitterness in the finish. The alcohol is somewhat warming, but is mostly noticeable in the mouth.  Overall Impressions: This is good imperial stout. It has a very interesting difference from aroma to taste. While the aroma screams fruit and had me excited for something a bit different than the typical coffee/chocolate/molasses dominated impy stouts, ultimately it is the cocoa and molasses that rule the flavor. I'd definitely buy this one again and it's the best offering I've had from Bell's, but it has some flaws.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,koopa,4.23,"I've received a few of these bottles in trades over the past 6 months. I believe the one I am drinking at the moment came courtesy of JohnTravolta21. Thanks for the opportunity!  Appearance: Very dark black with a nice 2 finger foam cap. Some retention and great lacing. So far I'm impressed!  Smell: Roasted malt that gives off a hint of coffee, some vanillia, and a wood note stand out. The notes are there but are not the most pronounced. You have to dig for them a bit.  Taste: I get bread pudding, roasted malt, some dark chocolate (but nothing like Choklat from Southern Tier), and a hint of anise. Better than the nose!  Mouthfeel: A full bodied brew that is a touch thick and a little flat. I think more carbonation would help in this category and this is the least impressive category for ES so far.  UPDATE 11/29/09: I've since had this brew several more times and have found more recent samplings to have better carbonation so I'm changing my score from a 3.5 to 4.0  Drinkability: Tastes great and is fairly drinkable for a full bodied low carbonation brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,Jekster,4.23,"Appearance: This beer pours a thick oily opaque umbral black with a dark chocolately brown head which quickly fades to a light lacing.  Smell: This beer smells of salt cured smoked bacon. There is a hint of vanilla ice cream and a dark coffee roastyness. The smell is deep and inhaling feels full and enjoyable like taking a deep breath of fresh cut flowers. There is actually a slight grassy or spicy hop character along with a wood bark character.  Taste: This beer taste of bitter dark chocolate and dark espresso. There is a definite sweetness of bread pudding and a well reduced caramel sauce or brown sugar. There is the flavor of bitter dark cherry, bourbon and licorice. The beer has a definite alcohol warmth like sipping fine bourbon. There is a linger roast bitter ashyness after swallowing.  Mouthfeel: This is a full bodied thick, chewy, and pleasant mouth feel. When swallowed the slickness dissipates quickly into a dry pallet.  Drinkability: This beer is a sipper in the best way. I think it would be a waste to do anything but sip one possibly two of these in an evening.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: I really enjoy sipping on this beer during a cold winter evening. It has a nice complexity while balancing the sweetness with a deep rich bitterness.

287,1444,Klgkenny,4.51,"Poured from a cellar temp bottle into a room temp pint glass.  A dense one-finger head, of the darkest shade of mocha, floats atop the black hole mass of a body, and like a black hole, no light penetrates.  Roasted malts and aromas of alcohol waft into the nostrils, and these strong scents almost drown the lesser supporting olfactory hints of chocolate, raisins, vanilla, and licorice. The flavors are slightly more balanced, but the roasted malt and alcohol are still at the forefront. Very, very sweet, which is balanced by a strong presence of alcohol. The big sweet combined with the alcohol make for a not unpleasant drinking experience! This is borderline, but it is just on this side of wonderful! The taste is mighty fine.  I wish that this beer were just a bit thicker, fuller. It has a creamy feel, and I would say it has a medium-thick body. As sweet as this beer is, it should pour like molasses.  Drinks like a session beer. If not for the $16 price for a 6 pack, this would be a session beer, regardless of the abv.

Smell is strong chocolate and to a lesser extent roasted malt.  Taste is heavy licorice and roasted coffee way out front. Boozy.  Mouth is thick and low carbonation but has a chalky feeling. This gets better as the drink warms, and oh yeah, the drink will warm you.

287,1444,SLeffler27,4.15,"The Otter Creek Pint Glass turns to a rich, dark, black with no visible light passing under a velvety, dense, dark, mocha head. If only the head were a little taller, this would be outstanding.  Strong, sweet molasses greets the nose from the pour and is joined by toasted wheat bread, espresso and some spruce. Raisins, vanilla, and perhaps a touch of smoke fill out the profile.  An impressive combination of bitter chocolate and black coffee is immediately followed by a punch of alcohol. Sweet cereals in the middle lead to a seemingly endless bitter finish. Yum.  A full-bodied, just shy of syrupy, elixir with biting carbonation and strong alcohol awaits all.  One must select this for the proper occasion and make an appointment for exploration. I am presently reading ""Beer Philosophy"" while sipping and may invite a cigar to elevate the experience.

T - All of the above flavors were present, as well as a little alcohol warmth in the finish, but not overwhelming for as high as its content is. Pleasant.  M - Generally smooth and almost creamy, though sadly absent from my sample was much carbonation, which I think would have improved mouthfeel.  D - I am generally pleased with this beer.

287,1444,CrellMoset,4.33,"Bell's Expedition Stout, on tap at Flying Saucer, Charlotte, NC. Served in a traditional American pint glass.  Appearance: Huge finger-plus of deep chocolately, cocoa head with absolutely great sticking power. It sits atop a thick, black sea of bottomless gook - though it doesn't look as unpleasant as that might read. Some sticky, thick lacing, sheetlike, fluffy in places looks really nice - definitely an attractive beer.  Aroma: Char and heavy black roasts with flourishes of French roast and cocoa dominate. This one's nearly pushed to the edge, heavy and thick, with a few wooden, green earthy notes peeking their head through the black clouds every once in a while.  Taste: Very nice. Heavily, deeply roasted astringencies, but also plenty of sweet cocoa, toast, some light bittering hops and grassy, hay-like notes. As the haze clears, one can detect a few faint but increasingly noticeably dark fruit notes, the obligatory raisin and fig. A very complex and well-rounded beer.  Mouthfeel: Fluffy, even, and milky, this one is of a perfect thickness and body, cut by a perfect amount of effervescence. Simply velvet.  Drinkability: Better than out of the bottle, in my opinion. The flavors just really came through on this one, and I'm beginning to appreciate this beer much more than I previously did. Sure the alcohol's way up there, but it's well-hidden and really takes a backseat to the great array of flavors and aromas here.

287,1444,roadhouse,5,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. This is a re-review. My last tasting was 6/18/08. There is no batch number on the bottle but at it's youngest it must only be 6-7 months or so, my last tasting was bottled 2/8/08. Edit: I contacted Bell's and it was probably batch 8270 bottled 1/3/08 when their ink system failed.  Pours an opague charcoal black with very dark tan one inch tall head. There was a big pop when I opened it, these reviews about it having no carbonation must have gotten bad bottles. The head sinks down to a skim and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.  Aroma of molasses, rum, chocolate, raisins, vanilla, a very faint smokiness, coffee in the back, and some alcohol. When I last reviewed this the alcohol smell was very prominent and almost overbearing, but it seems to have faded away.  The taste starts out very sweet, but not cloying, kind of like brown sugar and molasses. After the initial burst of sweetness I am tasting rum-soaked candied fruits and chocolate covered raisins. On the finish we finanlly get some bitterness in the form of roasted coffee beans and as it lingers on I am getting some piney hops, but overall the sweet flavors keep them under control and the aftertaste ends up more like coffee.  This is a very thick beer, almost the consistency of maple syrup. It goes down oh so smooth and creamy, some might say velvety. Flavors just glide through the mouth.  An exquisite beer. I never really found any flavor trying to dominate here; they all blended together quite nicely. For the alcohol content it goes down really smooth. Very drinkable for what it is, definitely a sipper though. Some aging really seems to help this one out. I'm heading to the liquor store right now to get the other 5 bottles that were left so I can cellar them, that is if I can control myself from drinking them.  1/06/09 Tasting: The aroma and taste are very similar only blended together better than before. This is basically the perfect RIS and I see no way that it can possibly be topped. If I wouldn't die from it I could drink a keg of this.

287,1444,Birchgrove77,3.7,"2008 Expedition Stout purchased from Binny's.  Appearance - Soot black. No light penetrates the depths of this beer. An amazing two-inch cocoa brown head coaxed from a vigorous pour. Fantastic lacing as the glass emptied.  Smell - Seems almost to have a dark chocolate cake smell interspersed with a slight coffee aroma. Maybe a slight raisiny aroma as the beer warms.  Taste - If you could melt a good dark chocolate into a nicely brewed cup of coffee and top up with a nice bourbon you'd have this pint of Expedition. Definitely, an alcohol burn on the back of the throat. As it warmed more of a vanilla character came through that was nice, and reinforced the alcohol warmth as having a bourbon characteristic. As I finished the glass the alcohol warmth and bitterness almost took on a cough syrup undertone.  Mouthfeel - Flavors stay on the tounge and mouth for a while. Definitely has some viscosity to it, but was what I thought it would have.  Overall - This beer surpasses my expectations based on other's reviews. This beer goes great with a couple of Oreos.  Have the rest of the six pack cellared as I think this is a once a year type of beer. A great offering by Bells, but not something that I would want often.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,argock,4.58,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness date.  A: The darkest black stout that I have ever seen with a baking German chocolate cake 1-finger head that lasts for over 10 minutes as I allow the beer to warm some more. The top of the glass is draped with lace. A beauty.  S: This beer smells like a brewery with dark but sweet malt delivering the majority of the aroma. There are some chocolate, espresso, raisin, and dark rum notes there, but the malty smell hangs heavy and is atypical for the style.  T: The flavor, however, is a brilliant combination of hefty maltiness and complex components such as coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruits like raisin, date, and plum, with leafy, aggressive hopping. There are a lot of extra milky sugars in this brew, but they are welcome and enhance rather than detract from this brew.  M: The mouthfeel is as full as you can get with beer at least a half-inch thick with each chewy swallow. The aftertaste has more fruity, chocolate, coffee, and bitter hops tones than the flavor belies.  D: This is an exceptional beer with incredible fullness in body, aroma, and flavor. I will be seeking out more RIS style brews in the near future to see if any can match Expedition Stout.  12/5/09: Cellared for 6 months, this brew has gotten smoother and less boozy with plenty of strong bitter chocolate and coffee flavors. The sweetness has faded a bit. This is a formdiable brew that will grow some more in the cellar.  10/20/10: Sampled a nearly 1-year old bottle tonight -- still a little boozy and could use more time. Flavors are not very sweet and mostly bitter chocolate, coffee, and molasses.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,PerzentRizen,4.23,"I found this beer on one of my yearly runs to Cincy. This is the third time I've had it and it was great all three times.  I poured this one into a Duvel glass which is the glass I typically taste new beers or review them. All I have to say is wow this beer is amazing.  From the first pour all I have to say is ""motor oil"". It's not quite as thick as Ten Fidy but it's close. The head is fairly impressive even at the 45 degrees I ended up opening this at. I figured it would warm over the hour I spend drinking it on this nice brisk Mississippi winter's day. The head is dark tan and full of soft small bubbles that quickly reduce to a thin lacing that will completely fade to nothing.  The taste is of burnt flavors, toffee, dried fruit, raisins, and hard hitting hops. I love the flavors here. This is much better than Old Rasputin but very very similar.  The mouthfeel is big and biscuity. The smoothness of the swallow is shocked by the finish which is quite bitter (which will mellow with 1-3 years of aging I expect).  Overall I would rate this beer a solid find. Enjoy this one at the end of a evening or big meal.

S: A lot of alcohol on the nose, with some roasty smells. But mostly alcohol.  T: Heavy espresso flavors accompanied by a surprisingly smooth alcohol burn that's pleasantly warming.  M: Chewy and thick. Looks like motor oil, and has a slightly lighter texture. Relatively low carbonation.  D: I can't say I could do more than one of these in a sitting, but it's pretty drinkable for a 10.5% RIS.

287,1444,sprucetip,3.98,"I had fun in my review session with mom a couple years ago, but deep into it we got to this beer, and I have to update the scoring. What I scored, largely based on mom not being into the intense roasty bitterness, though we'd been on a mostly impy stout/porter binge, just isn't fair to such an impressive ale. The original is still below, and it may be good for a laugh, if I remember right.  pours thick black, creamy mocha head with good retention and thick lacing. Very attractive.  Smells pretty boozy, as this is a pretty fresh sample. But this succumbs to smoky, roasty, coffee and molasses influences.  Malty sweet, roasty flavor and bitterness, black licorice/molasses, and booze which is none too bashful. The roasty bitterness does linger, as I recall, and is a little bit harsh. But still, this is pretty smooth and complex while fresh, and bound to improve with age.  Well carbonated, a bit of a hot alcohol bite penetrates an otherwise velvety rich, full body. The bitter aftertaste is, as mentioned, a bit distracting. I should put some away and see what happens to it.  This is one aggressive, bold, and crass, but classy Imperial Stout. It deserves to at least be compared to the elite the elite of the style, if it isn't one of them. I'm looking forward to see how it might smooth and mellow with some time.  ***  First review, winter 2008 with Mom starts here; bottle into snifters. Share with my mom. From notes.  Mom is an aspiring beer geek who has been drinking craft beers mainly over the last 15 years, after a lifetime of macro lagers. She mainly drinks whatever decent porter is on sale, but likes stouts, and when introduced to some Belgians recently, seems to like them as well. She's not a hophead and doesn't like bitterness generally. She doesn't experiment much when I'm not around, but she is open to it. When asked what she thinks about various ales, she often pulls common descriptors off the top of her head. I think she is a bit of a natural, and could make a great reviewer.  Dark black, moderate mocha head, some retention, thin spotty lacing. Mom wanted to give it a 5, but I decided on 4.5  Big molasses, sweet, malty, smoky, woody, has legs. Mom:""Chocolaty, woodsy. sorgham."" ""I do appreciate the smell. It smells good. I really like the smell.""  Tastes of molasses, coffee, bitter, hint of sweetness, and sharp bitterness that lingers well past the finish (and past the next beer). Kind of harsh and way out of balance on the bitter side. Mom:""That's bad."" ""I would never order or drink another one of these."" ""Nasty.""  Storng bitter tang from front to middle. Low carbonation. Feels thin despite its huge size. Sharp bitter finish and aftertaste. Mom:""I don't like it.""  A sipper at best. I like sharp roasty stouts, but this is too much for me. The bitterness on the tongue lasted way past the next beer! Way out of balance on the roasty bitter side. I appreciate the boldness, but mom didn't. From memory, I thought I liked this one and will definitely have it again. Mom won't. Mom:""Not a drain pour, but I wouldn't get it again."" ""almost like syrup."" Mom on aftertaste 30 minutes after it was gone and we were on another beer ""like if I had a tablespoon of pure molasses. I can't get it out of my mouth.""",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells DARK, as in dark coffee and chocolate, but not ""dark"" in the sense of good and rich. Smells slightly sweet...  Taste is very syrupy, dark, and sharp; very much not for me, one of the more disagreeable tasting beers I've had in a while. Similarly, this stuff is thicker than I was expecting (though it isn't too too thick). It really sticks to your tongue, and with its taste that's not a good thing at all in my book.  I have very low drinkability with this. It's very slightly warming as it goes down, and its taste is so sharp that it's definitely not something you'd want to drink one than one of... or in my case more than one sip of...

287,1444,Reaper16,4.35,"served on-tap (!) into a globe glass at Flying Saucer  Looked like an RIS, basically. Rich blackness with a creamy, tan/leather head. Lacing was superb all throughout the drink.  Lots of chocolate in the nose, with pleasant characteristics of nuts (almonds, maybe). Sweet, luxurious malt aromas provide an awful lot of enticement. I think, not quite dark fruits, but maybe berries of some kind? Either way, its intriguing.  This is a terrific tasting beer. Loads of creamy chocolate, roasted-to-burnt malts, a touch of hops somewhere in the middle, and a nutty, clean finish. The alcohol asserts itself, making this beer pretty hot and warming. This is like a delicious glass of chocolate milk, only with booze.  Expedition Stout is thick like a milkshake, but remains drinkable throughout. If you can handle the hot alcohol characteristics, you could be in danger put a few down too fast. Splendid.  I'm ecstatic that I had the chance to try Expedition Stout on-tap, though I can only wonder how an aged/cellared bottle might do to the alcohol taste. I suspect that this is too young to be at its optimum tasting age.

Poured absolutely black as ink with a medium brown foamy head. I could just look at the behaviour of the liquid as it poured into my goblet and tell it was going to be thick as hell in the mouth. Perfect. This was a terrific looking stout; enough to justify me handing out a 5.0. Smell was full of burnt coffee notes with a healthy dose of chocolate and caramel, and toffee, as suspected. Good, for sure, but no higher than a 4.0. Taste let me down a bit. Sort of a, ""...hm...that's it, eh?"" The flavour profiles one would expect were all there, but I just felt this lacked the deep complexity I was anticipating, and honestly, it wasn't as sweet as the aroma alluded to. Also, I feel that there is no question that this is 10% abv+. The first breath you take after having swallowed has a bit of heat on it. Mouthfeel is right where I was hoping it would be. Thick, chewy, heavy as hell. Great. Drinkability on this one is average at best, I felt. I think this is another classic case of generating hype over a beer and just *knowing* that's it's gowing to be the greatest beer you've sampled in many years, and then the moment arrives, and all you've done is set yourself up for disappointment. A good stout, overall, though. Just not the ""be-all end-all"" I was thinking it would be.

Very nice deep brown head, little bit of carbonation, leaving a slight ring of tan head around the rim of my glass. Looks very drinkable. Smells of bitter espressos,overall Argmanac-soaked prune alcoholic bite,musty leather,tabacco, molasses raisins, port wine, figs, rum-spiked coffees with bitter chocolates. The nose is quite alcoholic,but offers a wide array of fruity spiciness that really is interesting. Taste is very rendolent of the nose. Bitter espresso, followed by rummy roasted malty fullness. Coffee, peppery spices, cocoa, jammy fruits, tobacco. The thickness of the mouthfeel is pleasant, as the alcoholic finish cuts through the richness, leading to a nicely balanced RIS.

287,1444,birchstick,4.22,"A - pours thick and black with no head whatsoever.  S - smells of sweet malt at first, with huge tones of roasted malts and some chocolate.  T - At first I was hit with a hint of vanilla and then tasted burnt malts, with a little bit of coffee grounds. This melted into some dark chocolate in the flavors. This is nicely balanced between the two. I also tasted an interesting sunflower seed flavor on the finish with a dash of hops. I like the taste so much because other RIS's tend to be overpowering, while this one is not too amped up on one particular flavor and is well balanced between the coffee and chocolate.  M - this is very sticky and leaves a cough-syrup-like coating in your mouth. It is also nice and full and goes down very smoothly.  D - if you like dark chocolates, this beer makes for the perfect liquid dessert. This also has a nice balance of roastiness to it as well. It has a decently high abv, which means you can't have more than a couple if you want to talk coherently. This is a great RIS and has become one of my favorites.  --- Cracked open a 1 year-old, bottled 9/16/08  A - poured very thick and oily without any head to speak of  S - milk chocolate dominates, with some licorice and a touch of toffee  T - very chocolately - from prior review I noted a lot of dark chocolates; they have sweetened and taste more like milk chocolate. There is a nice touch of roasted malt that lingers on the finish.  M - very full and smooth - there is hardly any carbonation  D - this isn't as hot and in-your-face as a fresh one.

Looks like used motor oil, awesome! 1.5 inch head with an agressive pour that retreats rather quickly - not a problem though once you see and feel the body.  Smells of bittersweet chocolate and cocoa powder. Heavily roasted malts and some vanilla. The nose is quite complex! Taste went a bit down, but not much. All the things in the nose are there - vanilla, bittersweet chocolate and a huge roasted malt bill. As a matter of fact almost too huge - quite burnt. Sorched barely provide an anstringent bitterness to the brew that would otherwise be perfect IMO. Fusel alcohols are quite noticable as well. Body is lucious and creamy.

Figured I should give it another go, esp with the horrid weather outside. 12oz bottle. btw, one of the more basic labels I've picked up on in some time, and I like it. My eyes are drawn right to the strange diamond crest.  Pours thick true and syrupy. Two shades from black, this brown beast looks like the coffee in your office poured at 7pm. spills into the glass like motor oil, it seems to halt movement immediately. Densiness as Colbert might say. Only after the glass is full does a dark caramel head emerge. head is gorgeous...thick. too heavy to float away so instead it falls back into the glass. Eventually the surface is a reflective black mirror. Couldn't be better. I let the glass sit for 20min. This brew is warm now.  Smells like almonds, various nuts and some other nut varietals and also some roasted nuts. Huge whiff of maple syrup, coffee beans, brandy, cherries, hints of flowers, vanilla extract cookie dough & cough syrup. An unweildy feast.  The flavors are bursting in this beer as it slowly approaches room temp. Powerful stuff according to my tastebuds - It is almost too much. The alcohol is breathing heavy now below the sweetness. Cake batter. milk chocolate. dark chocolate. Grenadine. maple syrup. milk & honey. roasted almonds. espresso. but these metaphors don't do this beer total justice. It feels old - an ancient recipe (NOT rough though, velvety smooth to drink). You can build a story around it. Vikings ladled this on cold nights before they set sail. It was poured before pagan sacrifices, and found oozing yada yada yada. You get the drift. But maybe I'm getting a bit exuberant with this 10+% abv. Its got some downfalls. Its almost cloyingly sweet, and is a bit of a hot mess, but a hot mess in almost all the right ways. okay I'm going in circles.  MF. Syrup. Butter. Densiness.

287,1444,swizzlenuts,4.3,"When pouring the stout into an over sized wine glass, only a small head was formed, which has okay retention. When it was being poured, it looked like I was pouring motor oil. The nose on the beer is incredibly strong; it has hints of chocolate, roasty malts, and a pleasant sweetness. At 10.5% alcohol, it's impressive that the alcohol doesn't really come through in the nose; there is a slight hint, but it's not distracting at all. Sipping this beer at just above cellar temperature really accentuates the flavours. The beer has loads of roasted chocolaty flavours, with hints of alcohol. It's so balanced, that I could not quite sipping on the beer. Each sip contained something I had not previously tasted, but it must be mentioned that the beers complexity is perfect for the overal balance of the flavours. Some tasty hop flavours come through as well initially, while the bitterness comes from the roasted malts, the hop flavour is a nice addition. The mouthfeel is superb on the beer; it's exactly what I'd expect plus a little more. There is a light amount of carbonation and enormously thick mouthfeel. Solid. Drinkability on this beer is not easy to rate because the flavours are very tasty and I could drink many in a night, but I just won't see myself craving another one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A shade away from pitch black, as a slight amount of light comes in around the edges.  My olfactory nerves pick up some great coffee roasts, my senses pointing me towards a huge malty backbone. Dark cherries and slight hints of caramel appear as well. Very balanced in this portion of the beer, only complaints lie with subtlety, but its well balanced, as hops can be picked up here as well.  Incredibly creamy with a great blend of oats. In the middle comes slight chocolates, a little bit of caramel, but great dark cherries stand out from the crowd. The beer ends with a great twist of fresh hops and tons of bitter coffee roasts. Its different from most RIS' but it's well and right.

No light comes through. NONE. Small head that says goodnite after about 15 seconds. Other than that, looks perfect.  S - Big Bold smell that I notice with the glass sitting a few feet away. It is tempting me, calling to me. Woods, Nuts, Molasses, bitter chocolate, brown sugar, burnt caramel, malt....its all good. And now for the crutial taste...I have been waiting for a long time.

This is one BOLD beer. The best RIS I have had to date. Period. One of if not the best stout I have ever had. It would at least be in my top five beers of all time.  M - Coats as it medicates all of your troubles away. Wonderful. It is like a great dream that you never want to end. The warming effect continues when the beer hits the stomach. Get a fork boys cause this one is in a food group all by itself.  D - Only problem is that it is high in alcohol but that is ok...Its a RIS. Excellent.  Bells, you continue to impresses.

The head stuck around forever, and turned to a 1/4 inch thick creamy layer that left all kinds of lace on the glass.  This has a very nice chocolaty malt aroma. Very much a milk chocolate smell on this with an earthy, almost smoky end.  A surprisingly complex and very rich chocolate/roasted malt flavor up front with a delectable earthy, bitter chocolate finish. A hint of sweet toffee throughout.  This is a full bodied brew and contrary to many reviewers my bottle actually had the perfect amount of carbonation. Not overly carbonated but far from flat, it felt perfect considering the richness of this beer. This is an excellent RIS, complex, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Too well almost. I decided to pick up a 6-pack of this today since it's 15 degrees outside and snowy...I couldn't have picked up a better compliment to the weather. I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm going to cellar 2 bottles and open them up at this time next year.  *EDIT 12/25/09* Wow. Expedition stout with a year on it....ti's God-like. Like a thick chocolate malt milk shake. The flavors are some complex and the body on the beer improves ten-fold. It was good fresh...it's incredible aged, even only 1 year.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,DoctorDog,2.48,"A- Deep brown/black, opaque in appearance. Aggressive pour yields just barely 1/2 finger of brown head, which fades as quickly as it formed, leaving a thin ring and an oil slick looking surface. Milky chunks/streaks of yeasty sediment pooling at the bottom as I let it warm. Random globs of lacing.  S- The alcohol odor dominates the nose, and is making it difficult for me to adequately ascertain any other odors to any level of specificity or enjoyability.  T- Harsh alcohol bite greets my tongue from the first drop to hit my tongue. Some indiscernible burned tastes. The flavors just aren't blending satisfactorily at all here, and are being dominated by the booziness and astringency.  M- Creamy and oily, but no carbonation whatsoever. Somewhat off-putting.  D- Clearly nothing more than a very slow, somewhat labored ""one glass slow-sipper"" of a beer IMO.  Future outlook: I suppose I'll sock a few of these away in the basement, cross my fingers, and hope for a better day with this beer in the distant future.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,LilBeerDoctor,4.51,"Reviewed on 5/11/08. Bottle. Pours a dark black with the most beautiful dark brown/red head, as thick as a milkshake, man I can't wait to drink this! Aroma of chocolate, coffee, roast, sweet aroma (the aroma is probably the weakest component of the beer). Flavor of similar chocolate, coffee, roast, light alcohol, sweet sweet malt with a bitter hops finish. So rich, probably one of the richest beers I've ever had. The mouthfeel is just incredible. Although it is rich, it is fairly smooth and easy to drink. The best Imperial Stout that I've had to date--just super awesome and I'm so sad we don't get this in NY. 8/5/10/5/18 (4.6/5)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,zeff80,4.47,"A - Poured out an opaque, jet black color with a velvety smooth appearance. It had a foamy, brown, long-lasting head that left behind rings of sticky lace.  S - It smelled of tons of chocolate, very sweet smelling with toffee notes. Also, some nice floral notes.  T - It tasted of dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses and some oaky notes. It had a sharp bitter kick from the hops.  M - It was smooth and creamy, possibly the smoothest RIS that I've ever had. It was medium to full-bodied.  D - This is a very good RIS. Potent and very well balanced.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,corby112,5,"On-tap at the South Philly Taproom.  Perfection! Dark black pour with a coffee colored head. Very full aroma with hints of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, caramel. This beer is so smooth that it become dangerous at 10.5 abv. The flavor is very complex with malty chocolate and coffee, dark berries, and many other things that are silly to even try to list. Simply amazing!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Monkeyknife,4.35,"Poured from the bottle a very deep red brown with two fingers of red-tinted brown head.  Aroma of sweet roasted malts, dark ripe fruit, coffee, dark chocolate, some earthiness, and some booze.  Taste was much like the aroma. Sweet roasted malts, dark chocolate, espresso, dark ripe fruits, vanilla, raisins, and of course, the alcohol. It's mighty hard to hide 10.5%. Very well-balanced.  Thick and bold, a warm tingle from the alcohol, and lightly carbonated.  The perfect beer for the first light snow of the year here in St. Louis. Drink it slow and enjoy.

287,1444,spointon,4.06,"I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a tulip pint glass.  A= This stout poured black as night with zero light penetration. With a very aggressive pour, the dark tan head rose a full 2"" and took a long time to settle to a thin cap. Lots of sticky lace down my glass.  S= The aroma profile started from a base of sweet/syrupy dark malts, accompanied by bittersweet chocolate, licorice, treacle, and some earthy hops. Lots of alcohol present as well.  T= As in the smell, I found flavors of sweet dark maltiness and treacle as well as roasted grain, bitter dark chocolate, and mild black licorice. I was surprised that the hop notes were as strong as they were, bringing an earthy bitterness to the middle of each sip. The finish dried considerably and was alcohol filled. The aftertaste was long and pleasantly packed with sweet and roasty flavor.  MF= Heavy and full bodied with carbonation being on the lower side of medium. Slightly slick in the mouth yet very much a tongue coating beer.  D= While this is an outstanding RIS, it is not something I could have more than two of in a sitting due to the very strong flavors and heaviness. Still, I enjoyed this stout a lot and will definitely buy it again when I have the chance.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TLove,4.61,"A super-rich roasted toffee, anise, and dark chocolate tastes, this stout is exceptional in nearly every way. Pouring the beer, you can see the richness of the beer - it looks like motor oil at first and then the head slowly rises to the top. The smell is similar to other strong stouts, though the almost harsh consistency of the liquid bring out such smells far more prevalently than the others.  True to its Russian Imperial Stout roots, the high ABV (11%) is apparent in the taste, as are the abovementioned flavors of toffee, anise, and chocolate, which give the mouthfeel of a dark chocolate liquor. The drinkability, depending on your tolerance of high ABV, ultra-rich, virile liquids, varies between the difficult to swallow and the can't-wait-to-relax-with-and-enjoy-its-beautiful-balance.  This beer is phenomenal for the avid stout drinker, though not for the faint of heart.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Greggy,4.31,"A- Pours a large fluffy dark tan head with great lacing. The head has excellent retention. The body is pitch-black. Lacing is pretty large on this brew.  S- Deep dark roasted chocolate, anise, dark fruits, raisin, plum, deep caramel and toffee.  T- Starts out with a nice large balanced roasted chocoalte and dark fruits with loads of caramel, while transitioning into a drier finish with loads of extra dry bakers chocolate and hints of coffee.  M- Low carbonation, velvety smooth.  D- I was a bit anxious about having this young as I thought it would be too boozy, however, I found this to be very smooth. I look forward to seeing how these age.. if I can keep from drinking them all!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,caskstrength,4.28,"Haven't had a lot of big stouts like this before. Actually none this big.  Dense, black. Coffee in the nose and taste, roasted bitterness offset by gooey sweet fruits and molasses. Very thick, which I like for the first bottle, and starts to annoy me on the second bottle. So I generally limit myself to one.  Coffee, toffee, fruit, sugar, bitterness (maybe too much?), hops, all in proportion. What else is there to say? A thick, dense, bursting with flavor sort of stout.  No compromises here. When you're in the mood for a thick, complex sipper, seems hard to beat this one. 12oz bottles an extra bonus.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,KeefD,4.48,"Pours black with a huge, creamy chocolate milk colored head into my Darkness tulip, leaving behind some nice lacing. Aroma is boozy off the bat, lots of alcohol that isn't terribly well-hidden in the nose, plus some notes of coffee, chocolate and graham cracker goodness. Flavor smacks you hard with roasted coffee flavors, backed up by some bitter roasted malt chocolatiness, and some green hops in the background that are barely noticeable because they get smacked around by the roasted malt. Very nice flavor, not overly complex, but very tasty. Thick, chewy mouthfeel, creamy, very nice carbonation for the style. The booze is very noticeable on this one and will do well in the cellar. I drank two of these, laid the other four down. Great stuff, a real treat. Probably the second best RIS I've tasted next to the one this glass was meant for.

287,1444,rtepiak,4.03,"bought as six pack and have been hoggin' them all for myself. have found that its quite an inconsistent brew. my best judge so far has been... on the pour if the head recedes downward its a better bottle. and obviously the odor will be a defining factor when popping it.  when popped an aroma of chocolate and coffee filled the room. another pops and had a smooth malt odor. but another with nothing. pour is great. opaque with thick creamy head of a dark chocolate color. lace indeed. good density. foam is delicious. on an aggressive pour head graduates from light to dark down into the beer. when right the smell is a wonderful blend. equally coffee, chocolate, molasses and caramel. (in a bad bottle a mild banana and dough. sticky on the lips in that one.) taste is sweet... not intensely. light apple. nice chives hop. lightly smoky. goes down warm and smooth. one of the doughiest over all RIS i've had. liquor like but smooth bitter when best put for an RIS. that wonderful honey malt warmth i seek in RIS when at its best. excellent after a meal during winter. would like to have along side a stone's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,acrawf6,4.23,"Pours out black with a nice dark tan head that sticks around for quite a while and has nice lacing.  Smell. I'm getting a bit of a mocha like coffee bean aroma with a touch of vanilla bean. Heavy burnt malt aroma that gives it a smooth licorice bit to it.  Taste. Has a bold and potent flavor, but is still on the smoother side. A bit of an espresso flavor comes out nicely as does the bitterness. There is an alcoholic bite to it that is a little spicy to my tongue and warming, but is not all that out of hand. Has just a small fruity bit to it too; cherries is what i get. Aftertaste has a little smoky flavor to it that i did not get in the aroma or initial taste, with a little cocoa.  Mouthfeel. Body is full, but as it warms it seems to get a little bit of a slickness to it. Has a nice balance as I can certainly taste the malts and hops and the flavors go together nicely. Carbonation is at a proper level.  Overall, a real nice RIS that i am glad to try. I like the the potent flavors on both sides and how its balanced so well. It's not one i would say i must have again, but would be happy if that happens.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very 'toasty' that is. Taste is quite similar very very chocolaty. It also tastes like something was burnt. Some dark fruit notes in there. Maybe some coffee as well.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, just a little crisp. After it lingers around enough, the 10.5% abv shows. Full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.  Overall, this is a great RIS. Not too expensive for a 6er and at 10.5% you really can't go wrong. I will be getting this every year. If you see this at the stores, do yourself a favor and buy some!  Edit: 12/2016 and still drinking this beer every year. Hasn't changed in quality. Still amazing as ever.

This beer is thick and dark, it even has sediment which I love. It's also slightly hot, so I'm glad I have a few more bottle to sit on for a while. I think this will get better with a year on it.

Aftertaste lingers a bit too long, especially with the excessive astringent taste this beer permits. The feel is round, sticky but invasive to the palate, I feel like it's setting up unwanted camp on my tastebuds. Drinkability is low, although the ABV is high the balance of off flavors and peculiar aftertaste leaves me longing for something different. Suggestion: Try all Bell's as a single first.

287,1444,SykDoc,4.47,"Poured this from a bottle into a snifter. It pours like a motor oil. Very little head is formed which primarily turns into a very thin brown lace. Held to the light, it is completely opaque.  The aroma is a nice mix of coffee, malt, and yeast.  The taste is the part I enjoyed the most. It is a pleasant blend of coffee and malty caramel. The coffee taste lingers nicely with some spicy notes towards the end. A nice blend of alcohol and bitter/dark chocolate make the taste very nice.  The mouthfeel is interesting because it seems low in carbonation based on the pour but a medium level comes across in the actual drink. There is a definite bitter note that closes out the beer and is likely the explanation for the carbonated feel. It finishes dry and is a thick and creamy stout, the way I like it.  Overall it is quite a very good stout. I will certainly enjoy having many more of these. It is perfect for a cold winter night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Head is just about the darkest I have encountered and that is saying alot. Rich chocolate brown bubbles make a foam brick like top that sits at about three fingers. Great carbonation for a beer nearly 2 years aged.  Nose is deeply malty with coco, coffee, a hint of port and smokey malt that shows great promise.  My how mellow while still being a monster of a stout I think to myself with first sip. Dark rich fruits are accompanied by burnt malt. Bakers chocolate and and a nice cordial alchol bite are there also. I am surprised at how well the hops have stayed prevalent in this beer after all this time. Dare I say this beer tastes so much like Darkness now.  There is a bit of age that shows in the mouthfeel with some raw rustic bitter tones and dirty minerals. All of this is overshadowed by the abrubt bitter feel.  Still a very nicely drinkable cold night sipper.

It's the color of chocolate milk. The amount of lacing is obscene. Gorgeous.  Aroma is a heavenly combo of chocolate, coffee and the most deeply roasted malts you've ever smelled.  Tastes like being punched in the mouth will roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, cream and some bold-ass Central American coffee.  Mouthfeel is as thick as it gets. Creamy and silky. Imperial stouts don't get much better.

287,1444,semihobo,1.91,"A 12 oz of Batch 8728, bottled just over 2 months ago so pretty fresh. Incidentally, while looking up the age of this batch, I found out that a bottle is a neat 400 calories... fun to know :)  Pours with a thin dark brown head, darker than such standby terms as ""mocha."" The head simmers down pretty fast but that little bit that remains hangs in tenaciously. Go ahead and backlight this with your cellphone -- a searchlight wouldn't go through this baby. Back in black.  Smells like tar and liquor distilled from some dark homemade molasses. Also smells of mint, drywall mud, and funk. And regular mud, not just drywall compound but swampy mud. And chicory, although I'm not getting much coffee. And nutmeg. And vanilla. The first ominous notes of Pink Floyd's ""Time"" just came on, foreshadowing a scary taste...  Exceedingly sharp. Pungent, bitter, veering toward evil. Very plant like bitterness, like eating bark or some root and being told by nature, ""people are not supposed to eat this, fool."" Slightly sour on the finish, the bitterness and sour blend to create a smoked coffee grounds-like taste. Mix in rum and asphalt. Some alcohol warming, but it's pretty well masked by the 500 pound gorilla flavor. Becomes more chocolatey as it warms. I grasp the complexity, and I am trying to stay positive within the style.  Mouthfeel is thick, it's tough to not gulp as mouthfuls are overwhelming. Finish is, sadly, sickening -- definitely making a face. Severely undercarbonated. The mouthfeel is the worst part of this beer and detracts from all other aspects.  It was some serious work to get through 12 oz of Expedition Stout. Definitely do not want another, thanks. Highly disappointing. I kept trying to like it, but I don't... to each their own. Tried to finish it as a matter of principle -- however, when it came time to choose between booting in the sink from the taste or pouring it out, the last few sips ran down the drain.  :(",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Expedition pours a pure jet black with a tight bubbled, chocolate milk colored head and features a thick malted nose with tones of coffee and dark fruit and a wicked alcohol lace on the side.  This is stunningly thick and powerful. The taste and texture remind me of molasses. Plum and fig notes are present but are almost swept away by an enormous swath of alcohol which rules the taste and finish. The texture is remarkably smooth considering the extreme bulk this one is carrying.  This is a terrific and well crafted brew but a little too muscular for me most of the time.

Notes of bittersweet chocolate and roasty coffee in the nose. Taste follows smell, with the chocolate and coffee flavors mingling; a nice hint of hops is detectable on the finish as well. Mouthfeel was very nice, with a thick richness characteristic of the style. It didn't have the viscosity of Dark Lord, but then, exceedingly few do. Drinkability was exceptional; I found myself finishing the glass rather quickly and wanting more. Had to wake up early the next morning, so I refrained.

287,1444,Donnie2112,4.37,"it's black, light doesn't make it through there is no head there was a little bit of carbonation going up the side of the glass, doesn't look bad, but also nothing special  smells slightly nutty, a bit of vanilla, some chocolate  lots of roasty bitterness, a bit of chocolate and some dark coffee flavors as well, vanilla a bit of dark chocolate there is also a bit of black pepper and a bit of whisky like flavors coming from the alcohol  I found none of the problems with the mouthfeel that other reviewers did, I found it delightfully warm with the right ammount of carbonation and a nice heavy body. Seems about right for an imperial stout to me.  This is a nice beer, I might just have to pick up a sixer the next time I see this stuff. If they made this in uber limited quantities, people might just pilgramage for it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,danielharper,4.72,"Appearance: Black. Really black. No, even blacker than that. No light gets through even when held up to a light bulb. The only thing knocking this down is the very minimal head -- it leaves no appreciable head in this snifter, although I believe in a pint glass it's a bit more aggressive.  Smell: Sweet bitter chocolate malts, a slight astringency from the alcohol, the barest hints of raisin and other tarty sweet dark fruits. Very slight notes of grapes. Incredibly complex, very invigorating.  Taste: Highly alcoholic, strongly malty, very dry in the aftertaste. Thick with grains and barley in the middle, Strong notes of coffee and chocolate, of course, but with a sort of dry roastiness underneath that's less expected.  Mouthfeel: Thick, coats the tongue amazingly. Very low carbonation, pretty much nonexistent, beer goes down smooth as anything you can imagine at this alcohol level.  Drinkability: One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Amazingly drinkable, worth every penny. Having just moved to Kalamazoo, I'm going to be drinking a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of this over the next few years....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,allergictomacros,4.53,"A - Pours an opaque brown with a huge head of brown foam. Oddly, the head starts out looking weak, but build and builds as the bubbles trickle up through the viscous liquid. Anyway, foam is thick, solid, and pretty much crawls out of the glass of its own accord.  S - Ripe fruit, coffee and molasses. Raisins/prunes, sharp alcohol and chocolate cake.  T - Toasty, coffee etc etc. The real flavour is in the fruit though - ripe, juicy, sweet, fruit with a hint of tartness. Finishes with a big bitterness.  M - Heavy, creamy, chewy.  D - Very tasty, very big. Not something I would session but certainly delicious",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,GJ40,3.13,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle in a pint glass.  A - A deep, dark black beer with no light able to fight through it. A thick, creamy tan head.  S - Strong roasted aroma with chocolate and coffee notes.  T - Sweet, malty and syrupy. This one really caught me by surprise. I guess I've been focusing on hops and IPAs too much these days. I just couldn't enjoy this but I attribute that more to the style than the beer.  M - Very thick and chewy. A bit like cough syrup. Good moderate carbonation with lots of tiny bubbles.  D - I found this way too rich and malty to enjoy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bluemoonswoon,4.2,"12oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass.  A: Pours a bloody black, that is to say, black with dark, almost rusty highlights. The beer supports a thick and creamy one and a half inch head that cascades wonderfully until reaching its final height.  S: Big powerful hits of roasted barly, chocolate and big earthy hops. There is also a slight milkiness in here as well which adds some interesting character to this beer.  T/MF: Quite hot, bits of bourbon and vanilla but then quickly moves into sweet, dark chocolate with touches of coffee bean. This beer is super sticky, not quite like Dark Lord, which left a sticky beer film on the glass, but still pretty oily nonetheless. I think the carbonation level is right where it needs to be for a beer this full in body and leaves the pallate rather clean compared to some other impy stouts out there. I think though this beer is just the slightest bit too fresh and would probably benifit from some aging to coax out even more character from this massive beer.  D: A big, hot, heavy drinking experience. This beer is a great sipper but still remains quite quaffable (in my opinion, i like my beers a bit hot), but again, this beer may be a bit too hot for its own good and risks overshadowing more subtle flavors that might be lurking beneath the surface.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BamaBeerBuff,4.45,"This was bottled in February 2008.  A: It's a deep jet black with a really creamy chocolate colored head. The head looks like melted down milk chocolate and recedes slowly, leaving some nice sheets and lattices of lace as it goes. More lacing than one might expect for a beer with such a high ABV--I'm pleased. You really can kick the head back up nicely with a good swirl, too. The delicate, fine carbonation is visible in the head development.  S: Smell isn't as intense and robust as I would expect, but it's still really complex. Loads of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate, buttery rum aroma, some bitter, pungent espresso aromas. Upon each return to the glass my nose seems to find something new. Dark fruits now begin to make their entrance almost 10 minutes after the initial pour. The complexity is pleasing, but it's just not robust or chocolaty enough for me to bump it up.  T&M: The mouthfeel on this is absolutely perfect. Unreal silkiness and smoothness. It's got JUST enough carbonation to get by, and that's the brilliance of it. This is a huge beer that demands all your attention. Tons of flavors--sweet fudge (interplay of chocolate with a buttery/caramel flavor), figs/raisins, tempered with some bitter espresso and a kiss of earthy hops. The finish is long, but not abrasively bitter or roasty. No one flavor dominates, but the totality of the experience is overbearing.  D: So big it's not that easy to drink. Can't hamper it THAT much though, because its to style. I'm laying down a couple of bottles of this to see how it ages. I would only hope that some of the more intricate fruit and chocolate flavors continue to emerge at the expense of the hops (not a big fan of psycho-hopped RIS's). Anyway, get yourself a bottle and sip it on down--this one's a great.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,association330,4.52,"Outstanding stout here. Makes a perfect dessert beer.  A - Pours like motor oil, a thick, inky blackness with zero light penetration. Creamy, one-finger head slowly fades to a thick cap of dense foam. A ring of lacing coats the glass well.  S - The richness of rum, freshly ground coffee, dark fruit such as raisins, caramelized burnt sugar/molasses, and a noticeable, but not overpowering, alcoholic astringency.  T - Initially sweet and fronted by caramel, with raisins, roasted coffee, and dark chocolate coming through mid-palate. A notable alcoholic presence throughout. Finishes with an interesting contrast between sweet and bitter, with a swallow of roasted coffee, chocolate, and just the right touch of alcoholic prickliness. Mild to moderate bitterness lingers on the tongue, demanding another sip to bring back the sweet burnt sugar/molasses flavors.  M - Pretty close to perfect. Thick, oily, slick, and moderately carbonated. Finishes creamy and sinks right to the pit of your stomach.  D - Dangerously drinkable at 10.5%. I'd have zero problem making a slow, steady evening of enjoying a few of these, but at $15 for a six pack, my wallet knows better.

Creamy but pungent aromas of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and caramel.  Big, rich palate here. Tastes of dark chocolate, bitter dark-roasted coffee, overripe figs, and caramel, caramel and more caramel. Long, bitter finish with a big malty sweetness on the intake. A seriously hefty presence.  Feels thick and slick in the mouth with a deceptively sharp carbonation.  Very enjoyable -- one of the best of its kind.

287,1444,beachbum1975,4.46,"So here I am, ready to engage in my latest expedition - what's more fitting then an Expedition Stout! I had my 3rd child yesterday (10/9/08) and I can't stop reviewing beer because of a new baby! ;) After sneaking in a beer from the newest batch, I'm sitting in the recovery room of the hospital typing up this review...  Today I bought a six-pack of the uber-fresh 2008 edition - Batch # 8728.  A: A dead ringer for its' style, this one pours like black, thick motor oil into my fine Styrofoam cup (Sorry, no fancy beer glasses at the hospital). A large, creamy, dark mocha head sits during the entire session- amazing... Lacing runs all the way up the walls.  S: I whiffed a big pounding of freshly roasted coffee trailed by some heavily roasted malts and floral hops.  T/M: WOW! This one is thick, complex and full flavored. My mouth exploded with a wave of dry and complex flavors each sip. Starts with a bitter smashing of thick, oily heavily roasted malts, black expresso shots, molasses and booze. The middleis chocked with more dry flavors including oats and burnt brown sugar. Finishes with a cherry like flavor and unsweetened dark chocolate. Very bitter overall, possibly due to the hops being blended in there so quietly. Age will certainly do this beer well, as it seemed very sharp and bitey at times - but great today, nonetheless.  This is a serious beer. I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10 on the imaginary flavor scale.

The head on this thing is frickin enormous, real sticky and brown, the thing looks like a sponge soaked in coffee atop the brew. Sweet burnt malts in the nose, its an all out marshmallow roasting campfire in a glass. Sweet toasty grain, and lots of it, come through initially, definitely some quality malt used here. A bit of boozy heat while tasting but its warming, rather than unpleasant, very nice. Coffee and cream come through as well as the usual suspects of chocolate, molasses and brown sugar notes.

287,1444,TheodorHerzl,4.77,"Aged for two years.  This beer pours an opaque black with no highlights around the edges capped off by a dark mocha head that has surprising staying power on it. The smell is a rich and decadent combination of roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, roasted grain, and anise. A top notch and superb nose on this imperial stout. The flavor profile starts with roasted grain and bitter chocolate upfront followed by a myriad of dark fruits, a bit of caramel, cocoa, and only a touch of alcohol in the flavor profile. This is full bodied with low carbonation with the alcohol present on the mouthfeel. The drinkability for this beer is as a sipper at the higher ABV, but I could have had another one of these quite easily.  I've had this beer fresh, with one year of age on it, and now with two years of age on it, and this bottles was the two year old version and was by far the best I've had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,sleazo,4.43,"A_As I initially poured this, there appeared to be no head coming through. Seeing this I gave the beer a hard pour midway through. This produced a huge cocoa coloured head that overflowed my imperial sized mug. The retention is outstanding as the head just sort of sits there. As it does subside through drinking it leves a foam clinging to the sides of the glass akin to drinking a chocolate milkshake. The liquid itself is jet black.  S_Sweet roasted malt intermingles with coffee, licorice, and a bit of alcohol. Intense.  T_Intensely sweet at first with the licorice and coffee coming through the forefront. The middle leaves a bit of alcohol astringency on the palatte in a warming sort of way. The finish comes back with a slightly more restrained sweetness. As this subsides the aftertaste is a deep roasted grain flavour, almost bordering on burnt.  M_Viscous but not overly so. The rich head adds to the experience and the carbonation is medium for the style.  D_I have had this on tap before as a clandestine offering in a NYC beer bar but was slightly buzzed when it happened. This bottled version is simply outstanding.

Plenty of lacing through out.  Smells like a wonderful rich toasted malt filled tongue pleaser  Taste is black malt and viscous coffee and alcohol. Slightly cloying aftertaste. The thickness is the real downside for me. A little lighter would have been great.  I liked it overall but this maybe my last six pack.

The first one I had seemed to be tough to finish, as it was not very carbonated and it was overly tart and licorice-tasting.  This one was great! It went into a Corsendonk tulip and left a monstrous three-inch head. The carbonation stayed, and left a nice creamy, bready head.  The appearance is jet black (what does that even mean?) with a thin head that endures through the final half of the glass.  Taste is a bit too licorice for me. The alcohol is here, and the aftertaste leaves a bit of a sharp alcohol taste that fights with the anise to leave something a bit too sticky and sharp for me to want another.

Coffee and chocolate are there too, but not quite as prominent as usual in an imperial. Luxurious smooth body gives way to flavours of bittersweet chocolate, caramel and coffee, culminating in a surprisingly bitter finish. Chewy texture appropriate to the flavour profile and minimal carbonation. Warming feeling on the way down.  This is an awesome beer, and its not hard to tell why its so well-regarded.

287,1444,gmuller,3.94,"I acquired this beer from a friend who lives closer to the brewery. This one was relatively young, and I will probably age the other one after tasting it.  Appearance - There wasn't much to look at, thus the 3.0 on the appearance score. Completely black, very little head to speak of, largely due to the lack of carbonation. In retrospect...this beer was almost impressively black.  Smell - Caramel, sweet, candy-ish, but with enough balls behind it that you can tell the hops and bitterness waiting.  Taste - What I expect in an Imperial Stout, hoppy and bitter, with enough coffee and malt note to balance it. Sweet at the start, bitter on the finish. Somewhat more alcohol flavor than I like, and the aftertaste is...odd.  Mouthfeel - HEAVY. A bit like oil. You can see this beer coat the glass and the imagine it does the same to your esophageal tract.  Drinkability - Despite a lot of high notes to this beer, it isn't as drinkable as you might expect. After about a half of one you're left feeling somewhat tired of it. The alcohol bite tends to wear on you, and though the mouthfeel is impressive, it tends to get tiresome as well.

The flavor on this one is excellent with dark malt up front supported by a bit of chocolate and molasses with a little bit of a hoppy finish. It's well balanced with sweet up from and bitter at the end.  Mouth feel leaves a little bit to be desired, in that the carbonation is a little low.

Very rich with coffee and black malt, along with dark fruits and alcohol.  T: Wow. That is all I can say. One of the richest RIS I have had to date - almost comparable to Abyss. Very complex with cherry, black malt, coffee, dark fruits, and tons of chocolate. Slight alcohol on the finish, but nothing that is distracting.  Overall, this rivals the Abyss for most flavor and body for a RIS. One of the most richest brews I have ever had!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bubba83,4.38,"A special thanks goes out to my pal Kegatron for the trade.  How is this beer only #100?  Poured at 45 degrees into a tulip glass. It looked like there wouldn't be much head so I poured vigorously, turns out it is a late riser, cascading almost like a beer on nitro. This only added to the effect. It's midnight black and viscous looking with DARK mocha head. Tiny bubbles too, just the way I wanted it to look, perfect. Great lacing all the way through as well.  Aroma is of roasted chocolate figs, with a background of alcohol and roasty malts. Slight coffee hints but mostly a beautiful chocolate.  Outstanding first impression on taste. Deep, dark chocolate, starts sweet and rich, ends bitter and roasty. Expected a bigger alcohol presence in the flavor but it's barely lurking in the background behind tons of layers of rich decadent chocolate. Some people may say, isn't it a little one dimensional because of all the chocolate? No... Because there is tons of different chocolate varieties here.  Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, without really any pop on the tongue from the bubbles. I expected about as much from a strong imperial stout like this, but it could be a little more lively. Still, feels really smooth and oily, soothes the mouth.  Drinkability is hard to gauge. A plus is that the alcohol level isn't too apparent. Also, it's quite delicious and you want to go back for more. It's a bit too rich to easily quaff though, a definite sipper as you experience how the temperature changes effect the beer.  Terrific, well done Bell's.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,daythree16,4.15,"Pours jet black with a thin brown head into a snifter.  Smells strongly of chocolate with a bit of licorice and coffee in the mix. Kind of reminds me of a moccaccino. Taste is similar to the smell. Licorice and coffee up front with a bitter chocolate finish and a noticeable alcohol burn. A bit of molasses tends to creep in as it warms.  The consistency is almost like a milkshake. Smooth and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. High alcohol hinders the drinkability a bit, but the flavors are on point.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Definitely a good ""dessert beer"" with a nice abv of 10.5%. Sweet chocolate invades your mouth at first sip, followed by a long lingering chocolate/cocoa taste thats a tad bit bitter. Defintely one of my favorite stouts. Hope the brothers on beer advocate try it again. Sounds like they got a bad batch.

All kinds of lacing.  S- Vanilla & bittersweet chocolate , woody, prunes/raisins' sweet coffee, touch of alcohol.  T- Bitter woodiness with the same hints of vanilla and bittersweet chocolate and dark dried fruits. Roasted coffee subtle. More boozy on the palate than the nose.  M- Some creaminess cut by the bitter wood/coffee/alcohol bite. Low carbonation.  D- I will admit that I am partial to this style.

287,1444,GatorBeerNerd,4.26,"A: I had to give this just a low score because of its complete lack of any head. I wasn't really trying to pour it slowly either. I have a second bottle I will try a more aggressive pour with to see if there is any carbonation at all. One of my favorite parts of the style is typical frothy brown head that they have. Otherwise it looks like others in the style. It could pass for a pint of oil due to its extremely dark color.  S: Roasted coffee with a hint of a molasses aroma is the main aroma. Following the roasted theme is hints of roasted malt aromas. A very good aroma, but nothing that sets it apart from its competitors.  T: Dark chocolate and coffee bitterness mix well with the roasted malt taste. Hints of molasses that match the nose come through also. Luckily, this one is much more pleasing in the mouth than in the glass.  M: Very viscous in the mouth. It is very thick and almost syrup like. You can almost chew it. I do not know what causes it since there seems to be no carbonation at all, but something in it tickles the inside of the mouth as if it was carbonated.  D: Maybe the lack of carbonation aids in it going down easy. For a beer with this level of alcohol in this style, it is very easy to drink.  This one doesn't pass the looks test, but it certainly passes the taste test. If I have to pick a category for a beer to fail, that would be it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The aromas that really come through are dark fruits and molasses  T- Again, very dark, but very complex. Chocolate, roasted malts, french-roasted coffee, molasses, and stone fruits all blend in a thick black sea of flavor.  M- I really like it even though there's minimal carbonation. It's so thick, it's almost like drinking syrup, but not in an unpleasant way.  D- Absolutely must be sipped upon",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

D-I could drink these all night if I am not driving. What an awesome beer!  A great stout from Bell's, quite underrated in my opinion. Had this one for the first time in a few months as we did a side by side with Peche Mortel, KBS and regular Founders BS.

Caribian island dark rum, roasted malt. Coffee. There is a flavor, maybe an inhibitor along side of the alcohol. Almost a smell when I taste it. Sherry sweet, maybe port.  There is something in the taste of this in my mouth that is really neat. I want to say syrup. It is a bit thicker than I would like. Im surprised at how they were able to make it this thick.  Hard core. Reminds me a bit of Brooklyn BCS in the content, but more syrupy. I dont think I could drink many of them, but a single of this will slap you in the face ... one that I would enjoy. Though I think my tummy would not be happy. Thinking about it, a full growler of this would make me a weekend. Sign me up.  Maybe this bottle brew needs to sit a bit, maybe not.

S: The smell has a quick hint of dark chocolate and espresso up front before giving way to a massive roasted malt and molasses sweetness with a noticeable alcohol burn in the nostrils. Hops are barely noticeable as far as I can tell.  T: There really is a lot going on with the taste. The initial taste of chocolate and coffee gives way to the aforementioned sweet molasses malt flavor followed by dark fruits in the form of raisins and plums. The finish has a slight hop bitterness and a definite alochol burn.  M: Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy with very little carbonation. Very thick and decadent.

Beer poured an inky black color with a one-finger, toffee colored head. Very slow, soft carbonation and excellent lacing around the glass.  Aroma was coffee, licorice, roasted malt, molasses and light hops.  Taste was bitter chocolate, roasted grains, burnt coffee and toffee. Big thick mouthfeel with a long, bitter finish.

An oil thick brew, very chewy and a sipper; lots of dark bitter cocoa with black unsweetened coffee in the taste. Definitely more bittersweet than most of my usual RIP's, a bittersweet collaboration by the dark malts and the hops than just a usual hoppy bitterness.  Wow, a very dark and complex brew.

A half-finger brown head sits atop the blackness that embodies this brew.  S - Roast. Roasty malts, roasty coffee, roasty roast. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee... maybe slight vanilla on the back end, but that's my imagination.  T - Pretty damn hoppy for a RIS. Lots of roasty, chocolate malts, plus a nice hop bite at the end. A well-balanced, and well made RIS. Not the most complex compared to the giants of the style, but definitely nothing to scoff at.  M - Fucking awesome. I can't describe it better. It reminds me of DL, and that says alot. Viscous, coating, syrupy, thick... with the nicest amount of carbonation to offset this huge-bodied beast.  D - Great drinkability for the strength and flavors involved. A sipper, but an easy sipper.  Notes: I always steered clear of this Bell's offering due to reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a more-than-enjoyable brew. It's a well-crafted brew, and not just because I'm a homeboy.

A small mocha colored cap vanishes quickly.  Smell, like the rest of this brew, is big. Big roasted malt, coffee and molasses. Faint chocolate aroma sneaks through but it overwhelmed by the stronger scents.  The is a sweetness to this brew, blends well with the roasted malt. A slightly burnt coffee and dark chocolate taste tie in very well.  Mouthfeel is big but exceptionally smooth for the abv. Heavy slightly oily finish. Almost creamy.  Beers this big are not something to sit down with a sixer of. But for what it is, I can drink the hell out of it.  Growing up in Kalamazoo, Bell's has always been a favorite of mine.

Molasses, a floral hop texture, and a rich chocolate scent rounds out the aroma. The taste warms through and through with a thick malt note, big in your face hops, fresh Columbian coffee undertones, molasses, and slightly tasting of caramel.

The creamy foam alone teases the nose and the palate. Rich dark malty molasses and deep chocolatey mocha with charcoal and strong black coffee lead the way... but the drink is thick, heavy, and syrupy; under carbonated, oily, and darkly mocha sweet. Molasses flavor and viscosity with chocolate and coffee, and sticky icky.  Oily, chewy. Full-bodied and decadent. A guilty pleasure like silky dark mocha ice cream... perhaps edible--but not all that drinkable. Second half of the drink was more of a snack than a drink, but a tasty snack, for sure.  *Note* It is imperative to serve this brew at cellar temperature, else it is a flat, sticky mess not worth drinking.

287,1444,FleeVT,2.36,"12oz. brown bottle with no dates into a snifter.  A: This pours an extremely thick black brew with almost no carbonation. I thought it might be flat until I checked some other reviews. Got a brief thin dark tan head by snifting.  S: Espresso, alcohol, and sweetness in the form of molasses. Slight hop bitterness on the nose as well.  T/M: Thick and again, no carbonation. There is a bite in this that comes from the alcohol and something else. Extremely astringent. Extremely hard on the palate, not balanced and not a good complexity. Lots of smokiness and burnt coffee beans.  D: No thank you. Not your typical from Bell's. Avoid",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,megapyro6,3.63,"Strong initial hop aroma that fades quickly after pour into glass. Pours somewhat like motor oil with a moderate medium brown head. Head seems pretty strong and resistant to go away. Eventually subsides and leaves some decent lacing. Coffee and malt aromas most noticeable with slight hints of sweetness from fruit, raisins, and hops. Rather strong taste with thick mouthfeel. Strong sweetness to the taste. Not as drinkable as some other imperial stouts I've had, but still tasty.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jayrod20,4.15,"Poured pitch black, with a one finger creamy brown head that lasts forever. Complex aroma; coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, plum, and hops. Big malt flavor, complimented with coffee, smoke, hops, and some dried fruit. Full bodied. The beer is excellent, but I recall finding previous batches more flavorful and more enjoyable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SIRIUS2,3.96,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours thick and black, viscous, remind me of motor oil. I was a little surprised at the head that developed on this, it just kept rising to more than an inch of light brown creamy foam. Lacing was good - all the way down the glass.  S: Aromas were a bit complex with a mix of coffee, prunes, and something on the order of brown sugar. There is also a faint whiff of alcohol but no discernible hops.  T&M: Heavy and full on the tongue, thick & chewy. Lots of coffee and thick sweet malts. It's hard to tell where the bittering is coming from - the bittering of the dark roast or something else. There are other flavorful hints in here too, like raisins, candy sugar, something like black licorice, and several layers of other malts. The carbonation is very fine and rather minimal, but it is there and seems to be well matched to the brew. The finish on this is long, as you might expect, with sweet malts that fade quickly to a long linger of bitter coffee tones.  D: Smooth and creamy texture is an interesting contrast to the aggressive coffee bittering, sort of a hard & soft complex. The ABV makes this a stiff drink, but it's enjoyable just the same.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SchmoTerp,3.83,"Pours and looks like a stout should with a dark tan head. Head took some time to dissapate. The mouthfeel are thick, robust, with some slight smokiness.

287,1444,bloberglawp,4.48,"Pours pitch black, murky thick off-brown white head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, malt and vanilla. Flavor is a incredibly well balanced dark chocolate, roasted barley and hop bitterness followed by a thick satisfying reminder of dark rum, thick chocolate sauce and caramelised figs.  I'm starting to wonder if imperial stouts are hard to brew wrong, all the one's i've had these last couple of months have been exeptional.... maybe I'm just enjoying this style more than I did before.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The equally dark brown head lays down very quickly leaving patchy lace around the glass. It did not smell as strong as I was expecting but it was a pleasant, subtle chocolate and sweet alcohol aroma. The taste is great, bitter chocolate and sweet malt at the same time. A dull bitter aftertaste hangs out on the back of the tongue begging for another sip. Mouthfeel is full and bursting with flavor. I get coffee, chocolate, rye bread even. Anything dark I can think of is contained in this beer.

S-Sweet and malty, Roasted coffee, A little bit of a smoked aroma T-Coffee up front with vanilla and malt sweetness finishing the end and a smokiness to the whole taste. Unsweetened dark chocolate came through on the end as it warmed. Did not detect alot of fruit flavors. Alcohol barely noticeable. There was a slight vegetable taste throughout. M-Very creamy and caoted the mouth. This bottle had a slight fizzing effect when I drank which was surprising. D-I could sip on this one for quite a while, but the high alcohol content would really catch up with me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,beavers,4.45,"[2007] Syrupy and gooey blackness poured into a SA pint. A huge two fingers of dark brown foam that look more like the head of a rich Italian espresso. Outstanding retention and gorgeous lacing down the sides. Smells of rich espresso, vanilla bean, molasses, chocolate malt, alcohol is in the very back. There's a little smokiness going on here too. Immensely thick, creamy, and viscous mouthfeel. Sweet vanilla and brown sugar notes hit the tongue first before being consumed by huge flavorful and bitter coffee, cigar tobacco, oak, with a long and lingering (bittering) charred finish that stays in your cheeks. This is a clear definition of bittersweet. An alcoholic finish that is noticeable but not undesirable. This is an intense RIS and one of my favorites for sure. Will review more later with a little time on it to see how the intense bitterness and alcohol evolve. A brilliantly balanced beer nonetheless.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,btuthill,4.3,"Violent pour from 12 oz bottle produces ~2 inches of medium density brown foam. smells like a stout, simply. previous bottles poured more gently held too much carbonation and interfered with the enjoyable taste of this beer. the heavier pour allows the sweet chocolate and dark fruit tastes to swirl. the 10.5% alcohol is barely noticeable. this is very nearly a 5 in taste, but that number is saved for a rare few. the mouthfeel is smooth and well palatable. my 'drinkability' is based pretty highly on taste, so i could see myself enjoying a couple of these.  a nice part of the bell's repertoire. i would gladly have another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,SQNfan,4.38,"This was back in color with a brown head of fine bubbles. There were scents of molasses, chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruit and a slight spicyness toward the end. In the mouth this was concentrated with lots of midpalate power and shows off mainly coffe & chocolate flavors with a hint of the alcohol. Very well balanced with the hops just poking out at the end.

287,1444,nickfl,4.12,"A - Small, brownish-orange head that dissipates quickly. Virtually opaque black body with just a hint of ruby showing through.  S - Roasty malt aroma with subtle notes of both chocolate and coffee. A velvety hop note lurks in the background as a nice complimnet to the roasted malt.  T - Sweet and malty up front with some deep, dark chocolate flavors. Hop flavor kicks in early with a resiny, velvety smooth note and a round bitterness that compliments rather than cuts the sweetness. The finish is strongly bitter with competing bitter components from the malt and the hops and lingering notes of coffee, tobacco, and smoke.  M - Very thick, oily body with low carbonation and a sweet, slightly alcoholic finish.  D - Reasonably drinkable considering how huge this beer is. The flavors are profoundly dark and quite complex, and the only flaw I can find is the mildly hot alcohol in the finish.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smallish mocha-colored head disipates to a ring around the glass  S- Molassas, roasted malts and dark chocolate with a spiciness & booze in the background. Different but sexy.  T- Nothing like the smell but, wow. Intense coffee in the finishing fumes. I know that's starting backwards but that's what hit first. Rich roasted malts & chocolate malts make up the body with a background of coffee beans & molassas. Finishes up with coffee and a slightly too bitter hop intensity.  M- Thick & chewy like a tootsie roll.  D- Brilliant drinkability from something so intense in flavors & mouthfeel. Splitting a 12 oz bottle is enough for a lengthy sitting.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,aerozeppl,4.46,Thanks to goryshkewych for this beer.  A: Super deep black with a finger of tan head. Some lacing.  S: Smell is a little off for me on this one. Little musty and almost a spicy cinnamon smell. Definitely different.  T: Everything you want in a RIS. Bitter roast. Chocolate. Roasted coffee beans. Then a sweet rush then a chocolate covered coffee bean finish. Little boozy at the end but I love it.  M: Thick. Really dense stout. Creamy as well.  D: For the ABV doesn't get much more drinkable than this. Too bad RIS season is coming to an end. I feel dirty wearing shorts while drinking this. Would definitely seek out again.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I just got to reviewing this and I love it. There is a sweet smoky malty taste to the beer and the carbonation was spot on. I am confused as to why some people had such a negative review of this beer because it had no off or cardboard tastes to it. There was an alcohol aftertaste and it was thicker than your average stout, but in my opinion that is the appeal of this beer. Hopefully your experience is more in line with mine than the other reviewers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jdubjacket,4.43,"Pours a pitch black out of the bottle. The aroma immediately fills the air. It's VERY SWEET. The aroma is almost too sweet, which is the only drawback for this beer.

I personally thought it was quite good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,RomanW70,4.36,"Pours almost black with a thick tan head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roast, and caramel. Extremely smooth but complex at the same time.

I can't wait to taste this one aged.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Metalmonk,4.75,"Pours a creamy head of tan froth that leaves big patches of lace over time. Color is dark as night in hell. A beauty of a thing.  Aroma is char, wet coffee grounds, dark baking chocolate, fast-food chocolate shake. Couldn't get my nose out of it. An excellent representation of the style.  Oh damn...that flavor. So insanely delicious...something to be enjoyed and savored...something to sink right into. Black cherry...chocolate fudge...old-fashioned drugstore malts...premium coffee...fudgy and coffee-bitter in the finish. Milky, creamy, gooey mouthfeel with barely any carbonation but just enough to keep it from plodding over the tongue.  One of the best beers out there, in any style. Who needs barrel-aging? Not Bell's Expedition Stout. This thing is just about perfect as is. A regular supply would make life that much sweeter. If you don't like them big, sweet, lovingly-brewed and freakin' delicious, then 1) this is not for you, and 2) what's your problem?

287,1444,dnichols,4.25,"I poured a 12 ounce capped bottle into a pint glass.  A: It poured a thick black body with hints of reddish chocolate. The one finger head was a dark bakers chocolate with varied sided bubbles. The head did not linger long but it did leave a ring around the collar. There was a dense lacing that became spotty over time.  S: It had the full aroma of roasted malts, dark bakers chocolate and hints of coffee. There are ripe dark fruit flavors as well as charred brown sugar.  T: The chocolate flavors dominate. It has the taste of milk and bitter chocolates complemented by ripe dark fruits (figs, plums). As the beer rests on the tongue there is a bitter bite and some light coffee flavors.  M: It is creamy and full-bodied with a rich sweet front and biting bitter back. It finishes arm and clean with some minor sweet and sour aftertaste.  D: This is an enjoyable RIS with decent balance and excellent richness. It is too heavy and has too high an ABV to be a session brew but it is an excellent beer for a cold winter night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,MiScusi,3.28,"Bottle code of 7740 indicating a bottling date of Dec 19, 2006. Pours a really thick black color. Found the smell and flavor to be somewhat paralleled with the Kalamazoo stout, although kicked up a couple notches of course. More of a sour dark malty character to this, or what seems kinda like soy to me. I didn't like it all that much. The roastiness just wasn't that big.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,nmyers,3.1,"This beer poured black with a very thin dark brown head on it with little retention and it looked really thick. It seemed to ooze out of the tap. The smell was good molasses, raisins and dates very sweet smelling. The smell was much better than the taste, it was slightly sweet in the beginning and finished very bitter. There was not much alcohol flavor for being 10.5%. It also had very little carbonation. Over it was ok because I am a fan of stouts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,iuhophead87,2.82,"A- Dark black with almost no head! Looks almost like molasses or barbeque sauce.  S- It smells like molasses, raisons, and dates. Smells much sweeter than it tastes.  T- I had high expectations for this beer, but was greatly disappointed. There seemed to be almost no carbonation. It is more malty than sweet and where is the creaminess of a stout, it is not in this beer. Almost reminds me of cough syrup with a little hops added. Not a big fan of this beer, although I do like most beers brewed by ""BELLS"" .  MF- Thick and starts out sweet, then the flavor goes quickly as you choke down this raison juice.  D- The taste + alcohol content make this beer almost undrinkable. However, If you are able to get one down the 10% ABV is a plus. There is no way I could drink more than one of these.  I'm a big fan of Bells, but could do without this concoction of hopped up prune juice.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,IPAcraig,4.17,"This Bell's stout was poured upon arriving home after what seemed like a successful interview with a solid firm. Cheers to a good outcome on both items.  It is off to a slow start. I dont know what it is about Bell's stouts (maybe the bottle conditioning), but they all lack in carbonation and head. What head that does appear is a wonderful, dark mocha brown atop the blackest of bodies.  The aroma is undeniably weak on this massive beverage. It comes with high credentials, but it is falling a bit short. Sweet cream is nearly the only aroma detectable ... okay, and some roasted coffee flavors.  Its not looking so good for this one, and them Bam! there is an explosion of flavor. This is a massively sweet chocoaltey brew. It is like chocolate syrup almost, in a good way.  The mouthfeel is syrup, with very low carbonation. I like the thick viscosity of this one, but a tinge more carbonation would have helped.  This is a big beer. It started slow, butted it pulled through in then end. Drizzled over vanilla ice cream is amazing,",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Exceptional depth and complexity.  M: Smooth transitions with a sharp dry bitter finish...

S - Smells very sweet, almost like a heavily creamed and sweetened coffee with some booze thrown in.  T - Front is slight hop bite followed by overly sweetened and creamed coffee and chocolate with a bit too much roasty bitterness on the finish. No alcohol apparent.  M - Not thin but not full either. Complete lack of carbonation hurts quite a bit but slightly thick and smooth for the most.  D - I really can't see drinking more of one of these at a time.  Not bad but much too sweet for my tastes. The lack of carbonation also took me by surprise and made me feel this was more of a cold coffee drink than a beer. It's too bloody sweet in my opinion. Overall I'd not turn this down if offered but I can't say I would buy it if available.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bunnyhustle,4.35,"Pours jet black with mocha colored head. Somewhat thin head however there is pretty good retention and heavy lacing. Smell is of toasted grain, chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and raisin. Taste is great. Heavy coffee flavors and an overall ""burnt"" taste to it. Dark chocolate and dark fruit as well, really dont detect too many hops. Mouthfeel is thick as hell. Thickest beer I've ever drank. Very low carbonation and a slick, oily feeling left behind. One thing to note is the alcohol is well hidden, could barely tell this was 10.5%.

Aroma is wine like, with roasted malts, licorice, some chocolate and coffee too. Taste is sweet. I pick up some dried fruit, molasses, some roast and some faint hop or roast bitterness in the end. Mouthfeel is thick, and a bit sweet. Almost leaves my lips sticky like my kids with candy. Not your average Imp Stout, but I love this stuff.

287,1444,rodrot,4.58,"This is by far one of the boldest Imperial stouts I've ever had. It poured totally black with a nice half inch tan head that hung around. Aroma was very roasty and coffeeish with lots of ripe fruit and a hint of madeira in the nose. Taste was very complex with a medley of flavors coming through. Espresso, dark chocolate, licorice and port wine were just a few of the flavors in each taste. Alcohol was barely evident, making this stout highly drinkable. Mouthfeel was quite rich and full bodied. This is not a beer for folks who favor light or less assertive styles. Next year, I'm buying a case of this stuff.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Pencible,4.62,"Another outstanding stout from Bell's. This time an imperial, it poured opaque black with good brown head. It smelled like molasses and dark chocolate with some roasted coffee. It tasted strongly like very bitter/dark chocolate with a roasted flavor, mixed with natural/wood cask notes and a bit of alcohol taste. It was very thick but not too sticky, with a strong but mostly sweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very flavorful stout, but not too strong to drink more than one. Very enjoyable, reminiscent of the Old Rasputin with slightly different flavoring.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Slatetank,4.55,"This is the ale I chose to celebrate my 500th review. I picked this up at Capone's in Norristown and cellared this for 6 months. Decanted at approx 45 degrees in a snifter and goblet for the sake of experiment.  A - Very, very very deep brown w/ medium brown head that appears like a sturdy tree trunk w/ rings after a swirl of the glass. The bead is ultra fine w/ a smooth cappuccino-like appearance on the foam.  M - Dry, luscious roasted malt w/ a toasted charred feel like the texture of over-roasted marshmallows. Intense spice and sweetness w/ moderately low carbonation and a decent amount of hop bitterness as the liquid is swallowed.  S - Supreme dark malt w/ heavy roast and fruit aromas. The sweet chewy malt has a creamy milky caramel aroma. There is subtle molasses and smokey wood notes w/ light spiced hop odors that round out the smell of this complex ale.  T - Dark fruit and berry flavors w/ vanilla-like oaky and slightly smokey flavored sweet chocolate cookie-like malt. The hops are pungent w/ sweet leafy and piney flavors that have a sugar coated taste. The flavors of dark crystal malt w/ roasted grains tastes as fresh as fresh brewed wort. A nice brown sugar-like note w/ a nice accent of citrus coming from the hops works in a synergystic way. There are many flavor layers w/ a dominant dark chocolate flavor that surrounds the tongue and makes this stout seem like a hoppy version of liquid truffles w/ anise spice added for good measure.  D - One of the best American Imperial Stouts I have tasted in a bottle. Just about flawless w/ a balance of hops and so much malt flavor you can't go wrong here. Even the boozy taste is within optimal range for my taste (6 months cellared) I prefer the bottled version, but I will update this when I can w/ the draft version. I can honestly say this deserves all the accolades this big stout receives.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,abankovich,2.79,"Poured with a pretty nice light brown head with the beer being extremely dark as it should be.  Smells very strong and sweet of molasses and maple syrup maybe some brown sugar as well. Some chocolate notes as well.  Very sweet on the initial sip, a lot of malt and syrupy flavors present. Almost a little too syrupy for me. I wish there was a little more bitterness throughout to balance it out. Chocolate and Java hints on the very back end as it washes down.  Mouthfeel is medium to thick and the drinkability isn't too high on this one for me due to the overwhelming sweetness for the style.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours with a thin brown foam, which my wife immediately commented on (""why isn't it white? That's weird!""). I think it looked very cool. Smells good to my weak nose.  Taste is borderline fantastic. A hint of coffee, which is all I like, & lacking the heaviness of a less-excellent stout that fills you up after a few sips. Very drinkable - I might even be able to down more than one per hour, which isn't the normal relationship I have with stouts.  Great beer. I'm going to try to convince my wife to hold off on trying stouts until the six-pack has been relegated to a fond memory.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Thick and big with nice head retention that settles into a low but persistent lacing.  Aroma: Slightly sweet roasted bitterness, big chocolate nose, with underlying alcohol aroma. Toffee plus coffee sweetness. Good roasted nuttiness all the way through with almost barleywine-like characteristics.  Taste: Big flavor up front; sweet and chocolatey, followed in the middle by alcohol, then finishes roasty sweet and bitter. Too much alcohol but really nice big full flavors alongside it. A slight hop bite at the finish.  Mouth: Full, thick and chewy. Smooth and full mouthfeel. Good carbonation to balance the size. Surprisingly effervescent.  Drink: Nice, buy the alcohol impedes on any real continuous drinking, but for a sipping stout, it's drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,esv,2.52,"12z 10.5% abv  Brown-chocolate, milkshake head. Thick head. The beer is thick to the eye when poured. The beer is black.  I smell salty, smoked ham. It smells Malty Sweet. Hops have a real presence in the nose, which seems out of style. And now I'm sure I've got a pig in my nose.  It's a bitter-bulldozer that ploughs over the tongue but the wake is more like that of a loaded down barge. Sweet medicinal flavors dominate the finish.  Mouthfeel. Thick, heavy and smooth. Like the mother of all imperial oatmeals, hyped up on nitro.  While I can drink it, I also have a high, distorting threshold for imperial stouts.  Sometimes a severe beating can be less painful than a couple of light jabs. Adrenaline kicks in at higher levels and masks the really brutal stuff. I think my tongue went into survival mode.

Pours a very dark brown/black into a snifter with a thick clumpy tan head. Smell is very sweet and intense. Strong alcohol aroma.  Taste is extremely sweet. Too sweet for me. The flavors are very complex and indulgent, but it leaves a sticky taste in my mouth. The aging has helped quite a bit, though. I would be interested to see what another six months would do to this one.  Overall: Malt-heads will love it.

The stout poured nice into a pint glass with less head than I had expected from my experience with other Bell's stouts. The nose was rich with sweet and roasted flavors. The texture was thicker than I had expected but the flavors were well-balanced with roasted coffee, chocolate, toffee, and even a hint of hazelnut.

Dark roasted malts, chocolate, a touch of coffee. The citric hops are there but just a little more subdued that the nose suggested, still plentiful though. This is delicious. Hard to really describe in words.  D: Not real sure if you would want more than one of these at a time. Its a beer to savor - a sipper for sure.

Slight sourness in the background. Alcohol not masked too well -- which could possibly be fixed with a year or two in my beer closet.

The thick, creamy, dark brown head slowly settles into a dense film. An appealing start.  The aroma was a little softer than I thought it would be. Notes of roasted malt, and chocolate cappuccino are underpinned by a light molasses sweetness. Occasionally I pick up a faint fruitiness but I can't nail it down.  The flavor starts out with a sweet mix of caramel and toffee that fades into a mild dark chocolate with a roasty and slightly bitter finish. The thickness of this brew coupled with a moderate carbonation allows the chocolaty bitterness to really linger around. Alcohol is not noticed at all in the mouth, but at 10.5% it does slowly warm you up.  Overall, a really tasty stout. It could use a little more carbonation which should help the aroma pop a little more. I like how the alcohol is very subdued and the overall balance of sweet and bitter is spot on.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Brutally viscous with an almost jelly-like milk chocolate-colored head with strength. Blown away - can't get better than this.  Don't know how they did this but it smells like BBQ in the smoker and cinnamon toast all at once. Sweet, roasted malt is still not unbalanced at all.  Deep, thick roasted, smoky, charred malt combines with sweet brown sugar to generate one of the best beer tastes I've ever experienced. Still blown away - amazing.  So, so warm on the mouth - a tinge of carbonation keeps it from getting heavy.  I could drink more of this than I probably should - it's heavy, but quite drinkable.

A one finger dark tan head forms and fades soon into sticky foam on the sides of the glass.  Aroma has a bit of soy sauce to it and a medicinal character.  Texture is thick, baby, thick, like chocolate milk that's heavy on the syrup. Needs more carbonation to break through that mouth-coating stickiness.  Flavor is raw: bitter chocolate syrup with undertones of cherry cough drops, charcoal and soy sauce. Alcohol burns as the beer slides down, leaving behind a disagreeable bitterness. Coats the mouth like cough syrup.  Can you tell I'm not a fan of this one? And read my review below to see my views on an aged bottle...  I'm going to have to declare this one as not a favorite based on these two samples, but I'm willing to try it again after it ages a while (but less than the bottle below). ___  2004 bottle, consumed 12/17/07.  So dark brown it's almost black. No head on pour, but it spontaneously erupts a few seconds later, dying quickly. Coats the sides of the glass when swirled. Aroma is a little musty, salty. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Red wine flavors, saltiness (like soy sauce) bitter finish. No carbonation a major bummer; this bottle must have passed its prime. Too bad, as it's supposed to be so good.

A: Poured solid black with good viscosity to it. 2-3 fingers of deep mocha head forms and fills the rest of the tulip. Great retention and lacing.  S: Deep roasted malts and plenty of lightly bitter coffee. A nice molasses sweetness covers everything. A hint of creamy melted milk chocolate in the back.  T/M: A nice hop bite. Just a touch of citrus but a pleasant bitterness that melds nicely with the strong espresso. Sweetness is a little further back, caused from the strong burnt malts, but levels things out a bit. Alcohol is present and will occasionally add a small sting past it's usual warmness. Body is very full and carbonation adds just enough to make it smooth and creamy.

287,1444,SierraGS,3.26,"This is a polarizing beverage. It pours beautiful, dark and syrupy - sort of like motor oil or molasses - and the alcohol aroma that came from the pour convinced me to stick to a small glass. The head was thin, but lacing remained from rim to bottom of my small snifter glass.  Roasted malt dominates, caving to flavors of espresso, chocolate, carmel and tobacco.

Sheets of lace spotted the glass.  S - Roasted notes and bittersweet chocolate are first apparent. They are quickly backed up by espresso and a sweet aroma that reminds me of maple syrup.  T - Bitter roasted flavors abound. Followed by chocoloate, coffee, cherries, and burnt caramel. All this is tied together with a warm alcohol flavor. Balance is very good considering all the strong flavors that are present.  M - Full bodied. Bitter. Carbonation is at a level that I like for this strong of a beer.  D - Drinkability is high.

287,1444,jeonseh,3.01,"From this years batch of Expedition and poured into my brandy snifter  A - Deep and dark black with a reflective sheen to it. There are no traces of carbonation or anything moving within this brew. On top sits about 1/2 a thumb of a creamy, lighty carbonated head that seems to be composed of a bunch of little bubbles settling on top of one another.  S - smells like a mixture of things that seem to come at me at different times. At first impression, I thought it smelled mostly like chocolate malt and then after awhile, there also were hints of cherry coming up through the nose. Additionally, there seemed to be a bit of a deep, dark coffee roastiness as well. Nose is actually a bit muted on this one as the scent is there but just barely and not really overpowering at all.  T - initially, have to say this was a lot sweeter than I expected. The beer seems to come in and swirl caramel and toffee flavors in over your mouth as it reminded me a lot of sucking on a caramel. There is also a slight hoppiness that is mixed in and also a bit of a tartness that seems to go alongside the cherry flavors a bit and comes in between the sweeter flavors that come first and the darker roastier flavors. After these fade away, the impression is the taste of bitter coffee coming in as well that appears to counteract the sweeter flavors and prepares you for the warming alcohol feeling that this beer leaves you with. After drinking more and more of this, it seems that some of the sweeter flavors have faded and instead there seems to be an earthy, raw hops flavor that has come to dominate the beer and in away is a bit overpowering and unbalanced as it is the only real flavor tasted and destroys some of the sweeter notes that initally went so well with this brew. Moreover the longer I drink it and the warmer it gets, the more out of balance this beer seems to be as the greener, earthy hops seem to really dominate this brew and be the only thing I can taste.  MF - has a decent body which comes right in the middle of being too thick and thin but instead is just right. Also has a decent amount of carbonation for an RIS and this carbonation really seems to pop out when you first sip this beer as it was one of the first things I noticed. It seems to be what ushers in the sweeter caramel flavors that come to the tongue. There is also a slight tingly and bitter feeling left in the mouth after drinking this one that makes me have a desire to munch on something while drinking it.  D - overall a decent stout but just think that the raw hoppiness of it makes it a bit too out of balance to really appreciate its finer points. After awhile it seems to be all you can taste. have to say this is also a nice beer to drink on a cold winter's night for the simple fact that the alcohol in it really does warm up your whole body and yet it does not stand out in the flavor such that this beer is undrinkable or overly boozy. Would like to try one after it has aged some to see if the raw hoppiness fades away some and makes this even creamier and smoother.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Moderate sweetness; flavors of molasses and dark chocolate are met with an almost burnt bitterness. The finish is long and coating, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste. Well crafted, but too intense, acrid and sweet. If that's your thing, you'll probably love this.  Mouthfeel - Incredibly rich and creamy; easily one of the most full-bodied brews I've had.

Taste: As promised in the aroma, the flavor profile is very sweet. Caramel, plums, figs, and molasses lead the charge while cocoa, coffee with a shot of grappa, and toffee provide the backbone along with a hint of grassy and citrusy hop bitterness with warming alcohol looming throughout the palate. The aftertaste lingers for a long, long time.  Mouthfeel: It's full-bodied and oily with plenty of carbonation and a dry finish.

About a finger and a half of chocolatey colored head. The head quickly disappeared after a couple minutes. Smells roasty and lots of chocolate and coffee. Very nice smell.  Taste is of dark chocolate and coffee. Sweet at first then a bitter aftertaste. The alcohol taste (10%) creeps in there. This one's definitely a sipper. It's a very thick beer. The carbonation is low and it leaves a sticky coating around the mouth.  Drinkability I think is lower on this one. It is very tasty, but the thickness and stickiness make it harder to drink.

Smell: A rich combination of chocolate and roasted malts, with tart fruit and a hint of alcohol.  Taste: An incredibly complex stout, it struck me immediately with rich roasted chocolate, coffee, and toffee malt, and then tart, dark fruits and licorice. The bitterness was minimal, and the alcohol warmed my mouth and throat a little as it went down.  Mouthfeel: It was the chewiest, thickest stout I've tasted yet.The carbonation was quite low, but not at all missing entirely. The mouth-coating was enhanced by the wonderful complex combination of sweet and tart.  Drinkability: I'd had a few other 9-10% beers before this one last night, which I wouldn't recommend. It might as well have been laced with Lunesta after those. NOT a session beer. Sip slowly, as it should be savored. I feel bad for those who didn't come to love this stout.

It got to about a finger and a half of dark chocolate looking head. It held up for a few minutes before going down to a skim.  s - sweet smelling with chocolate, coffee, and caramel notes.  t - sweet coffee flavor up front. After that the alcohol sets in. I figured it was going to be hard to cover up 10.5% abv and it is. The alcohol gives a good warming with a strong bite. It has a hoppy bitterness that I wasn't expecting. It doesn't really strike me as hoppy, just oddly bitter. This is a little much for me.  m - looked like motor oil pouring it into my glass, and that is also about the consistency. Normally I don't mind a really smooth beer, but I just can't get that image out of my head. More carbonation in the mouth than you would think after pouring it though.  d - I don't know if my palate just isn't ready for this or not, but it's way too much.

287,1444,lightindarkness,3.93,"12oz bottle, no batch number printed on label  An aggressive pour yields a full two finger tan head that sticks around a while, leaving nice lace. It pours a little like tar.  Nose is sweet and malty. Big dark grainy bread and a warm sugar sweetness. Some juicy hops and dark fruits emerge as it sits, with much more complexity in the back: light smoke, earthy root, faint coffee, oak, and alcohol.  Taste is full and smooth, with up front roasted grains and cocoa filling in with a wash of bitterness and hop character. Finishes with a nice mix of malt and hops, very tanic in taste and feel mixing with a sticky sweetness that really lingers on the palate.  Feel is full bodied and smooth, extra sticky, even a little puckery from the surprising bitter finish. Little carbonation to speak of, swallowed by the thick body.  Overall drinkability is in question. Certainly a very tasty beer that should be on every big beer lovers list to try. Bitterness and thickness of body leave my mouth and tongue a bit worn, but not necessarily a negative. Might do well with some age to mellow the finish.

Hops are notable and are more prevalant than I would've expected.  Taste: Loads of dark chocolate and mocha flavor. Chocolate and roasted malts are excellent. Very slight toasted nut and smoked flavors. Alcohol is noticeable, but blended well. Hops provide a little bitterness, but not too much. Bell's got this one just right.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's relatively thick, but very smooth and creamy. Carbonation is on the light side, but perfect for this beer. It is strong at 10.5%, but it's very drinkable.

(2.5) S: Roasted malts and chocolate. Can smell the high ABV...too prominent. (2.5) T: Completely unbalanced. Very weak malt can't offset the very high ABV. Roasted malt, chocolate...but not enough of it. (2) M: I hate to harp on it, but the high ABV distracts too much. Weak body and no taste to linger...just the alcohol. (1.5) D: Undrinkable...I hate to do this, but I'm not even going to finish this. I love high ABV beers, but they have to be balanced and have enough malt, flavors, etc. to hold up. This doesn't cut it. I see that others had difficulty with no carbonation. Either this is a major bottling problem or Bell's needs to rethink their approach here. Definitely the worst russian imperial stout I've had in a long time...and I doubt this will age well as the bottle suggests.

Thick, coating, and darkly sweet with balancing roast and bitter notes. Lingers nicely on the palate. (4.75) D: What a wonderful winter sipper!

Consistent, sticky lacing coated the sides of the glass throughout the tasting. Strong scents of malt, coffee and alcohol. Taste similar to nose, but also extremely sugary sweet (maybe molasses); burnt taste lingers at the finish. Somewhat of a syrupy mouthfeel with a hint of carbonation. Not bad, but drinkability is somewhat compromised by the thick mouthfeel, pronounced flavor of alcohol and bitter finish that lingers in the mouth.

Mouthfeel is best part. This is the most incredibly smooth, creamy and rich stout I have had. The combination of taste and mouthfeel are exceptional.  Drinkability is very good.

Potent alcoholic fumes as well.  Appearance: Black as Dick Cheney's soul. Holds a thin cover of dark tan lacing that laces in a half curtain with thin tidemarks.  Flavor: An American Stout to be sure, the citric and pine hop flavors come through pretty well. For as heavy as the mouthfeel is, it is remarkably balanced and almost mellow in flavor. A fair amount of creamed coffee, roasted barley, and hop finish. A pretty simple profile with a chicory deep roast aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Tons of chew in a frothy melted milkshake texture. Carbonation is pretty low and the finish is surprisingly dry. A bit oily.  Overall Impression: Clean, simple, tasty. Heavy body, full but not over the top taste, definitely worth some praise. A must try for stout lovers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gehrig,4.1,"The most expensive six-pack I've ever purchased (over $18 at the Good Time Beer Store in Northville, MI; review of the establishment soon on its way), Expedition Stout is a full-throated monster of an imperial stout. It's not the best, but certainly one of the most unique, IS's I've ever had. A solid, durable finger of brown froth rests atop a black body. The appearance is nothing short of menacing.  The smell is positively loaded with coffee and caramel, more of the latter than I would have thought, and it's a fascinating melange, and is followed by some brown sugar striving for air. The taste is quite good, but here I'm impelled to review it with the mouthfeel, which drags down the taste, and the beer as a whole. Lots of caramel and coffee, good enough. But it's a bit gritty and, coupled with tinges of bitterness which aren't in and of themselves bad, Expedition Stout seems to be working at cross purposes, rather than just being complicated. Its carbonation is good and durable--good show--but I think it would work better if it were smoother.  Nonetheless, it's quite good, but a big, brawny brew. I felt the very high ABV (10.5%) was hidden fairly well. But the texture ensures sipping this rather than quaffing. All told, that might not be so bad. Grab it but, unless you can afford it, try grabbing a couple and spending the rest of the scratch on a few others. The price is as big as the beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ChainGangGuy,4.37,"Appearance: Pours a jet black body with a full, frothy tan-colored head.  Smell: Aroma of black malts, roasted coffee, dark chocolate syrup, scorched almonds, molasses, and herbal, piney hops.  Taste: Black roasted malts with flavors of coffee and exceedingly dark chocolate. Some burnt almonds and fire-blackened marshmallows. The hops are bold in their bitterness, but not overbearing, and provide a taste of dried herbs and pine. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and acidic char taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Mild carbonation. Chewy mouthfeel. Warming from the first sip.  Drinkability: A very fine stout both fresh and cellared. To wit, I had an '02 this past weekend that had morphed into a slightly roasty chocolate liqueur.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,tastybeer,4.4,"Looks like deep brown-black oil topped by a tight medium sized frothy head. Head is a dark cocoa brown color and bits of straggly but dense lace appear, disappear and reappear in new locations as the beer moves in my glass. Head fades to a thin but even layer resembling the top surface of a hot cocoa. Smells full of densely gritty-deep rich coffee, raisins, semi tart berries, chocolate cream, evergreens, molasses, thick chewy malts, butterscotch, and flowery ethanol. Good. Taste begins with a smooth wave of malt and chocolate and piles of soft sweet fruit and flowers. Then it erupts with a surge of biittersweet coffee/chocolate and tingly 10.5% abv.

287,1444,goethean,4.8,"This beer was purchased at the brewery and aged 3-4 years before being consumed. It was poured into a Duvel tulip glass at about 50F on the night that Barack Obama won the Virginia primary.  Appearance is pitch effing black. Almost no visible carbonation. Aroma is of strong dark roasted, nearly burnt, malt.  assertive hoppiness, strong roastiness, strong malt backbone, and a beautiful sweetness spotlighted right in the middle of the palate. There is a slight lingering hops aftertaste.  Shockingly, there is amazing hops character considering the age of this beer. almost any other beer would have no hop character at this point. with this beer, it is right there, almost in your face. very well-balanced. This beer must be pretty much undrinkable when young.  One quasi-negative thing --- I don't detect the wine-like qualities which I normally associate with a fine, well-aged English barleywine or imperial stout. I might opt for a more English version next time. Or maybe I should have aged it a little longer!

287,1444,GratefulBeerGuy,4.94,"Thanks to ncvbc for this brew!  12 oz.&gt;postel chalice glass  This one pours out slow and thick, black as a moonless night night with a healthy, one-finger deep head at first then it slowly settles to 1/4"" deep ULTRA tight, compact, smooth and perfectly even dark-mocha brown head that is retained throughout the duration. Very impressive look, the lacing left behind is intricate patterns and very sticky. It doesn't get any heavier looking than this.  The nose is sweet, smokey molasses, Guatamalan coffee and cream, peanutbutter, and a high alcohol heat, but it's not overpowering. Big Wow aroma.  I'm stunned, my mind is blown, my tastebuds have been nuked, it has a deer-in-headlights effect on my brain. The malt is Soooo huge it's unreal. World class Malt complexity which includes: A very sweet, dark chocolate covered caramel, brown sugar and a big roasty coffee edge, but the thick, sticky sweetness is what's amazing here. The hops are big too, which is needed to form some kind of balance beyone the roastiness and sweetness...it's easily achieved here with an agressive earthy and bitter hop, not as hoppy as the Smuttynose RIS or some West-coast style RIS's but it's pretty big. The bitter, earthy hops blend well with the high heat of the alcohol which just adds further depth and balance. As the brew warms up even more I can taste wild blackberries and an almost zesty edge to the hops. The complexity has never been better...This stuff is extreme in all ways, pushing the envelope...totally beyond the pale.  The feel is as heavy, full and thick as you could want, the carbonation is low, but not void of feel, which is fine with me. I love my RIS's to be as heavy and thick as possible, this one is just that. My lips got sticky really fast, due to it's massively sweet malt.  This is really everything I could ask for from this style. totally rightous stuff...a true sipper, enjoy slowly.

287,1444,blackie,4.63,"Probably my introduction to the Midwestern beer world, or maybe it was Two Hearted. In any case, a review is long overdue.  a: Pours a nice brick-mocha head with decent retention. The beer is a deep brown in color, essentially black.  s: Rich roasted malt aromas coupled with earthy, pine hops. A touch of creamy bittersweet chocolate and espresso. Welcome ethanol note. Very rich.  m: Carbonation on the low side, and very smooth. The body is very full, and everything balances out very well. Creamy. Can't ask for much more here.  t: Roasted malt backbone with a big dose of piney Centennial hop flavor...perhaps killing some complexity. A range of creamy roasts makes up the bulk of the flavor, with a touch of smoke coming through. Moderate bitterness in the long espresso finish. A great RIS, but this fresh the depth is lost to the astringent roast and fresh hop combination.  d: easy enough for the style  batch 8295  bottle dated 9.25.13 consumed 12.06.13 - 5/6 on this rootsy Bell's night - perhaps my first realization of what an ris or double stout could be, lovely black in color with a rich mocha head, the nose swims with rich, impressive dark chocolate played off blackstrap molasses, coffee cream, tobacco fruit leather, the trademark soy sauce, and a touch of pine hops, full and smooth in body with a low, creamy carbonation, the flavor follows with dark chocolate, molasses, charred sugar, tobacco, dark fruits, and a nice little pine hop flavor and bitterness...incredible and tough to beat in the ris world, no hype, no frills  previous scores 4.5, 4.5, 4, 5, 4",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Totally black with no light able to show thru. Heavy, heavy lacing. Strong coffee taste of espresso along with a lot of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy.  Not my favorite of this style. The hop bitterness does not balance well with the rich malts and coffee. It's a clash, like an unhappy marriage. Why can't they get along?

Head recedes to a nice lace and leaves a little bit of stick.  Smells of chocolate, molasses and caramel, quite sweet, along with strong aromas of ripe dark fruits. Also some alcohol in the nose.  Taste is much bolder than the smell, with tons of sweet (but not too sweet) malty flavor. Chocolate, molasses and some caramel, and then midway through there is a blast of roasted malt that fades into a chocolaty sweet and roasty aftertaste. There is some dark fruit flavor toward the back end, as well, but not as prominent as in the nose. Alcohol shows up a little bit in the finish. Delicious.  This is incredibly thick and rich in the mouth, very full bodied and very creamy. Smooth and chewy. Dangerously drinkable as the alcohol is masked quite well.

287,1444,kkipple,3.78,"** 2007 vintage, drunk early 08.  A. What's left to say? Uber-dark, thick brew with a small lingering dark red-brown head, some lacing. Thick and absolutely opaque.  S. Heavy malt, heaps of molasses, cocoa and coffee. Dark bread and burnt sugar, deadening alcohol, a single bitter, angry hop note and a touch of red grape. Very hefty, this one. Could be more complex.  T. Very dense roasted grain in this one, pure darkness! Big big roasty flavor with the usual coffee and dark chocolate, pretty aggressive alcohol, molasses and brown sugar. Viscous and oily, dense and slick. Hints of vanilla and charcoal. Sort of like a mini World Wide Stout. It's all very intense, but wears on you after a while and I must confess, couldn't sustain my interest for the duration.  M. Extremely slick, low carbonation, warming. Massive roast-coffee / malt aftertaste.  D. No. This is pretty solid, but too thick and intense for more than a single bottle. Even then I'd recommend 6 ounces as an optimal pour.

287,1444,jbphoto88,4.61,"Dark black, thick beer. Looks almost as if you can cut the beer with a knife. It has a milk chocolate colored head that starts small and builds to a billowy one inch pillow. One of the best looking beers I've ever seen.  Smells like warmed dark malts, a little chocolate, dried cherries, currants and some love by the brewers at Bell's.  Taste is nothing short of exceptional. It has a silky mouthfeel that coats your tongue with flavor. There is a little of everything in this beer and the flavor are so well balanced they don't fight. It starts out with some sweet dark malts followed by dark fruits and mild hops. There is a nice chocolate after taste that lasts through the warmth from the higher ABV. Spectacular.  I've read some of the earlier reviews of this beer and I have to give credit to Bell's. If the old batches were poor they definitely got their act together for this one.

287,1444,muffins,4.8,"Batch 7205 (aged a year or more)  Poured into a thin-walled brandy glass, as a small pour, as I am wont to do with massive brews. The viscosity is readily apparent. Swirl the glass and it coats the sides like a chocolate sauce. Literally after minutes the beer has not completely settled back down. Color is dark, dark dark. Hints of dark amber peek through around the edges, but otherwise it is opaque. After 30 seconds I can count the bubbles in the head. There are 104 bubbles and they do not appear to be going anywhere. Aroma: medium roast coffee, dark cherries--almost brandied or dried cherries; prunes, raisins, some woods and soil, toffee and other sugar notes (brown, notably), fresh cut tobacco, high notes of all the citruses, Spanish anise's high note and licorice root's low note, toasted pecans, smokiness including peat, and the alcohol is present but fits well, as with other things I'd put in a snifter and smell all night, and I could just keep smelling it all night, it is so vibrant and complex.  Mouthfeel is true to the notorious thickness of the style. It's like taking a cola and reducing it by half--nearly a syrup. Carbonation kicks up a little when sipped.  Taste- the malt is huge, the hops might be huge, but it picks up more as accents off of the mammoth malt. Everything I picked up in the aroma is in there, playing off the dark malt. Images of pecan pies, fudge, maple syrup. More subdued is grapefruit. Alcohol is present but again, only slightly and it fits in.  You could probably cut it with soda water by half and it would still be awesome. In fact, I just got a second glass and put a little ES in and added some water. The color is that of a darkly caramelized sugar. The flavor is stretched out, emphasizing the berries.  This is one of my all-time favorite beers. I can barely drink a bottle by myself. I wish it came in 4 oz bottles. A hazelnut-chocolate biscotti is a fantastic accompaniment, as is a large chair and a fine checkers match. 3",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The finish reveals the alcohol, and lingers with bitterness that momentarily saturates the taste buds on the back of the tongue. I don't know whether to attribute this uniquely to the well-done grains, or partially to hops as well.  M-Thick and syrupy, this stout coats the mouth and clings to the taste buds for dear life.

M: Very, very full bodied but slightly under-carbonated for my taste. Smooth, filling, but lacking in some respect I can't quite put my finger on.  D: The high ABV means one of these is about enough.

No freshness date on the bottle - what's up with that, Bell's? - but this one was cellared for at least 6 months after I got it.  And while Expedition Stout has some worthy attributes, ultimately this is for me more a miss than any sort of hit.  Pours into my snifter a thick, dark brown. Not quite one finger of dark brown head. Very nice aroma, toffee, lots of roast, some chocolate. But it's all downhill from there - taste is unintegrated, hot, liquorice-y to the point of cinnamon candies. The sweetness doesn't balance that heat, and the heavy alcohol exacerbates the problem. Very prominent, causes a certain burn on the tongue and the back of the throat.

Head appears the very end - short, but a gorgeous tawny.  S: Rich, creamy caramel... light anise notes, yeasts & toffee. Quite a nice aroma, all in all.

A bit of bitterness on the finish, along with the alcohol previously noted.  M: A little syrupy, perhaps... a bit sugary or grainy. Wraps around the tongue and sticks a little on the way down.  D & Notes: I feel this is a reasonably example of a stout. A decent balance topped with flavour.

I mean, the flavors are there from the aroma and tastes like it should be a good RIS, but I don't know, I don't feel like thinking any harder about this. M: Thick, creamy, flat, no carbonation, just....not good. Too sweet, no bitterness or hops detectable... D: Ok, I'm being redundant, I only bump up the drinkability for the 10.5% alcohol being well hidden, otherwise it was very difficult for me to finish this bottle as I just didn't enjoy and would rather just have Kalamazoo, Double Cream, Java or basically any of their other stouts (for much cheaper).

287,1444,morimech,3.36,"Poured into a chalice. It has a very deep, dark black color with a large chocolate milk colored head. Good head retention with plenty of lacing. A thick cap lingers long after the pour.  The smell is a bit lacking. Dark fruit and roasted malt dominate with alcohol barely coming through. Smells more sweet than bitter.  The malt and alcohol dominate the taste. It is not well balanced. A little of the flavor complexity that other reviewers noticed is there but very faint in my sample. It finishes bitter with the alcohol combining making it difficult to finish. The body is thick and creamy but maybe has a bit too much carbonation. This beer seems a bit ""raw"" and would benefit from some aging. I will stow a few bottles away to sample years from now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,deltatauhobbit,4.18,"Thanks to tpd975 for the chance to try.  Wow, this beer pours out wicked black with lots of thick brown head, as well as, lots of lacing.  This is a strong smelling beer, roasted malt and coffee, other hints of chocolate, caramel and possibly some molasses, a rather bitter aroma overall though.  Taste is initially sweet from the roasted malt and ends with a strong bitter aftertaste, most likely from the coffee character. The roasted elements really take hold of your mouth with this one. Expedition is fairly smooth and creamy, not too much carbonation though, and this beer is quite sticky, it just coats my mouth. Can make out some of the alcohol though and I can feel the warming sensation in my stomach.  A rather excellent brew although the sweetness makes it difficult to enjoy more than one at a time, but it certainly is a treat. Might be good to cellar one for 5 years and see if it mellows out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,adams82,4.32,"Pours black, opaque, with a big dark brown head.  Smells of dried fruit, intensely roasty, deep black coffee/espresso, slightly sweet. Tastes slightly sweet, bitter sweet chocolate, heavy caramel flavours, finishes with a nice hoppy bite. Very intense flavours, deep dark and roasty, balanced with a nice hop finish.  Full bodied, creamy and smooth... Excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,elmore,4.43,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Thick, viscous, and pitch black. Thick, fluffy, brown-tan two finger head with excellent retention. Thick sticky lace coats the sides as you drink. This is a serious beer. Beautiful!!!  Smells of burnt malt, espresso, dark chocolate, some dark fruits. I detect some vague citrusy smell, which may be related to hops.  Taste is similar to the smell, very complex. Nice hoppy bite in the aftertaste, which I like, but often is overpowered by malts in most RIS's. A little smokiness in the after taste that I didn't really detect in the nose.  Chewy, creamy, big mouthfeel. High carbonation for the style, but pleasant. Has a big enough body and malt prescence to mask the 10.5%. The alcohol does produce a nice warming effect in the throat and chest.  Wow!!! Excellent RIS, one of the best I have had so far. Very complex. There is so much going on with this one. I'll definetly have to try this again to fully appreciate it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,NCSUdo,4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, batch 8183  A: Pours a thick black under a small, brown head. You know you are getting a big beer here. Ok retention, no lace.  S: Get some chocolate, roasted malt and slight fruitiness on first sniff. A cream-like sweetness underneath, hints of alcohol.  T: Woah. Was not prepared for the intense flavor profile that first hit me. Vanilla and a sweet cream up front that just explodes into a chocolate and huge roasted bitterness on the back of the tongue that will not go away. Was not expecting this level of bitterness. Even some grassy hop hints and some dark fruits thrown in as well. There is a huge spicy hotness as well, but doesn't have the characteristics of alcohol.  M/D: Carbonation is high, too high, but does lend in small part a creamy texture. Body is extremely full, a little slick, sticks to the lips a little, no hints of the alcohol, nice. Drinkability is lowered due to 10.50% and just how aggresive this beer is. A sipper for sure. Can't wait to sample some of this batch a few years from now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I also pick up a little chocolate muffin? T:Coffee lingers on the back for ever with a touch of hops. Super sweet through out. Like sweet sweet chocolate. M:Warm fat bubbles. D:The sweetness of this beer is a bit to much for me, could stand to be cellared for awhile. Was not bad, just had better.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jasonjlewis,4.2,"Thanks to MuenchnerKindl for the sample.  Pours a nice big head with great retention. Nice dark brown color.  Smell is of mint and chocolate and caramel with some coffee beans. Raisiny smell comes out as the beer warms.  Toffee sweetness upfront. Taste is sweet with chocolate malts. Roasted malts are not dominant at all. It finished wit a nice dry hop bitterness. Mint comes through as an undertone and coffee flavor helps to add a bit of complexity. Not boozy at all for a 10.5% abv beer.  Smooth and creamy mouthfeel adds to the enjoyability of this beer.  A very easy RIS to drink. I wish there was a little bit more complexity to it, but it is still very nice.  Very easy to drink. Not a lot of complexity for the style, but not hard to drink at all.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,OWSLEY069,4.38,"Pours jet black, with a tan/ light brown head. In the aroma, a roasty malt and grapefruity hops. In the taste, hoppy, coffee, and a sweet roasty malt. A small bitter, big body mouthfeel and a sweet roasty malt and a small grapefruity hop aftertaste. Big malt, nice hops, hides alcohol and quite easy to drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Overlord,4.23,"Thanks to Grynder33 for the generosity.  Gorgeous looking black pour with a dark brown half an inch head. Carbonation and head died down fairly quickly. Nice chewy mouthfeel.  Taste is rich and flavorful. Chocolate, coffee (more dark roasted than espresso; I approve) and dark rum (people keep saying molasses, but it tastes more like flavorful, sweet dark rum to me ... I think there may be a hole in my palate).  To be honest, not the most drinkable stout, but oz. for oz. one of my favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells of deep dark chocolate followed by a good does of bitter hops for balance. Feels super silky in the mouth, like a melted chocolate bar, wow! Starts out chocolatey that turns into deep roasted malt flavors which then magically transition to a nice hop bitterness. A slight smokiness to it mixed in there too. Aftertaste is slightly boozey. I want to drink this beer till my ears bleed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,AKBelgianBeast,4.45,Thanks to xmarcnolanx for this trade.  Pours jet black with a thin brown head. The nose is of chocolate cake and java beans. Incredibly tasty with lots of dark malt. Coffee bean and dark chocolate come to mind. Big big flavor with great hop bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy as hell and rides slick down the throat. Hop and coffee bean flavors dominate the finish and there is a strong alcohol presence in the aftertaste. Very warming and quite drinkable for 10%. This is a great offering from Bells. i would love some of their double cream. This expedition will have a nice home in my cellar for a few years.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Slynger,4.55,"Pours an inky black with the barest glints of ruby highlights in the lower portions of the glass. A small but creamy mocha colored head with a touch of redness rises slowly from the depths of the glass then rescinds at the same pace. The nose is deep and distinct without being overly complex. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and cherries with some citrus hops in the background. Whew doggies! One sip is all it takes to get excited about this one. It is so full, smooth, and creamy but with enough carbonation to liken it perfectly to a milkshake. Tastes of creamy caramel, smooth dark chocolate, sweet cherries, and a lightly bitter mocha / roasted espresso finish that lingers along with some citric hops. This one is really good. And ranks up close to Old Rasputin and Blackout Stout for me. I hear this one ages well, but I may have trouble waiting on the other five.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,RblWthACoz,5,"I hate molasses.  Pours pitch black with a large dark tan head. Nose is dusty with strong molasses tones. Flavor is oh so smooth. Strong molasses flavors prevail, but stay perfectly balanced. Feel is thick in the liquid and thin on the carbonation. This is a beautiful stout that is a hard one to surpass. Amazingly crafted and worth seeking out...at all costs.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,GRPunk,4.46,Bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured a jet black with a 1 finger deep red-brown head that turned into a nice lace that left sticky rings on the glass.  S- It had mostly roasty chocolate tones. More coffee aroma came through as the beer warmed.  T- It had more roasty chocolate character in the flavor. The alcohol was pretty well masked. There were hints of coffee and a sweet bourbon-like flavor (similar to what I think of as a smoke flavor in the sour mash). The hop flavors were fairly light.  M- It was thick and creamy with medium-light carbonation.  D- The alcohol was nicely hidden in the rich flavor. It was an easy sipper that I most recently enjoyed while watching the snow fall down.  Overall- A great example in my opinion. It had robust flavor and was easily sippable.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,brewcrew76,4.55,"A - Solid black with a good 2 fingers of creamy dark brown head. Brown sticky lacing everywhere  S - Roasted malt, chocolate, leather, smoke and dark fruits.  T - Roasted malt, cocolate, bitter coffee, molasses, dark fruits, sweet candy and a touch of boozyness that actually goes well with the other flavors.  M - Thick and chewy but more creamy than syrupy. Bitter finish that lingers.  D - A very strong beer for how little you can taste the alcohol. One of the better RIS I have tasted.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Completely opaque when held up to light. Taste: Again, very sweet. Almost overpowering, but somewhat balanced by the burnt, malty flavors. The sweetness wore out my palate toward the end, but still a great beer. Would definitely buy again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,potownbill,4.59,"Popped open the top,, took the first sniff, and knew this one was going to be good. The beer pours a very thick black, with a thin dark brown head. The smell was of roasted malt, coffee, molassas, rum, etc. Early on, there was some strong alcohol, but the beer smoothed out with some warming. There was a bit of carbonation, and I thought it was well balanced. Overall, I was very satisfied with this beer. I will gladly invest in a few more bottles.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It's as good as I remember. Since this beer has been reviewed a million times, I'll keep it brief.  It pours oil black into my glass with a brown head that dissipates almost immediately.  It has a very chocolately/coffee-like aroma to it and is very pleasant to the senses. It made me want to find an afghan or a quilt, I was so comfortable.  It's a very thick, chewy concoction... which is right up my alley when looking for a stout. The experience did not wane as I made my way through the glass. It coated my mouth and throat in a way sore throat medicines only dream of! I enjoyed it until the last drop.  Overall, it's a great stout. Not as good as DarkLord, Darkness or perhaps even Storm King, but it should be mentioned in the same breath.

Lacing is like cake.  S: Smells like a roll of fudge and chocolate charleston chew.  T: Intense chocolate and coffee with some serious warming alcohol with the backing of this one. Truly intense and chewy. The sweet chocolate is increasing throughout this beer. During the second beer, couldnt get past the taste of licorice that was embetted in my tastebuds. M: Full bodied mouthfeel to put it mildly. Truly unique mouthfeel that is coating and full of complex texture.  D: Could only have one of these at a time but enjoyable nonetheless. Having several could be dangerous.  Definitely worth the try.

M- The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy with little carbonation. This is one of the thickest beers that I have tried.  D- The high ABV hinders the drinkability of this brew but it is not meant to drink a sixer of these in one sitting. It is a very nice brew to sip on a chilly night.

287,1444,boogles,3.24,"This is an overrated beer, a real let down for me.  The *amount* of flavor is the only thing it has going for it. Poured into glass from 12 oz. bottle, with no head until dumped very hard at the end, and it quickly dissipated, although with some lingering lace--very light tan, not at all dark for an imperial stout.  The scent was on par for a regular stout, but with more alcohol, burnt raisins, and roastiness, characteristic of Russian imperial stouts. The taste was very strong and full, about the only thing that distinguishes this beer. Way too sweet, though.  The mouthfeel was no good--far too creamy and very low carbonation, and this begets low drinkability. In all, a decent beer--I'd be impressed to find a beer this good at any unknown microbrewery--but this is in no way deserving of the honor of a top 100 beer, nor is it on par with other offerings from Bell's, such as its simple, well-crafted Two-hearted Ale.  Most egregious, however, is the price at $15/6 pack. There are way better options for as low as $9-$11 in this category alone (especially Victory and Thirsty Dog). This is one Expedition I probably won't be making again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jamie2dope,4.72,"Ive been wanting to taste this beer for a very long time. Thanks to akorsak for the opportunity. Apparently this beer is a little over a year old, which I am sure is a good thing, as a beer like this tends to cellar well. Pours a jet black color, with a small tan lacing for a head. Definitely one of the blackest beers I have run in to. Aroma has deep notes of dark chocolate cake, port plum and molasses. Taste is nothing short of exquisite. It starts off very sweet and round, with much of the chocolate and alcohol coming through. It ends on a slightly more bitter roasted coffee note, but at the same time maintains that initial alcohol presence. Body of this one is thick and chewy. There are hops present, but are not overly detectable. There is a good dose of carbonation, however to balance out the big body of it. I could see myself drinking one more of these before moving on to something else for no other reason than that otherwise I might get knocked on my ass from the high alcohol. Damn, I wish this beer, and this brewery for that matter were available here in Mass (maybe one day). This one definitely falls within the top five biggest and baddest stouts I have sampled.

Some initial aromas that I couldn't put my finger on, almost like alcohol-soaked fruits. The smell invites you to take a sip.  T: Sweet start. Roasty finish. This flavor is very full and very good. The finish is a combination of roast barley and burnt chocolate and seems to go on forever. As it warmed more, the alcohol character became more prevalent.  M: Full, thick, almost like a thin syrup. Carbonation was right where it should be.  D: For such a heavy, strong beer, I definitely wanted another one. This one goes down dangerously easily.

287,1444,atrus138,4.28,"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass. Thick, thick, thick. Akin to motor oil. The opaquest of blacks. It actually made me do an experiment - I put a flashlight up to it to see if any light went through (it didn't). No head formed at all, though there are some streaks of froth. Smell was very faint, though not bad. The usual suspects for a stout are present: coffee, chocolate, with some woody character. Despite the weak aroma, this is a very flavorful beer. Very heavily malted. Notes of coffee, chocolate, burnt wood, and even a bit of soy sauce. Finds a decent balance between being bitter and sweet, though it leans toward bitter. This is one of the thickest beers I've had. Very heavy and smooth mouthfeel. This is one to drink slowly, which allows the flavors to come out more after it warms up a bit and also prevents the high alcohol content from getting the best of you. A great pick for the winter.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S- Bourbon smells are the first to hit my nose, perhaps reminiscent of sweet oak. Then some dark, going on blackened, roastiness, like freshly ground coffee.  T- Bourbon, mixes with sweet dark fruit- prunes and dates. After this blast comes an intense roastiness, mostly coffee, not too sweet or chocolaty. Powerful taste, as expected.  M- Thick as hell! Awsome. My only complaint is the alcohol is not amazingly hidden, but with a 10.5%, it's hard to complain too much about that.

287,1444,CWiggins,4.25,"This is currently on tap at Tyler's Taproom in Durham, along with three other stouts by Bell's. (It's quite cute, actually, seeing those four distinctive tap handles all in a row.) Served in a Bell's tulip glass, I was struck by the black appearance of the beer, with that dark-tan, one-finger head. (The head looks like it could be its own food group!) It certainly looks like a Russian Imperial Stout, that's for sure. One whiff revealed aromas of sweet dark fruits and heavily roasted malts. A bit of coffee jumps out of the glass, and there's a little bittersweet chocolate lurking there as well. The flavor is quite sweet, with a sugary prune character leaping to the forefront. Balanced in the middle by roasted grains, the flavor mellows a bit and allows the darker, coffee-like characters to dominate. Here's where the alcohol is easily detected! The finish includes some hops to contrast with the malts, but it's really in the background to everything else going on. Wow! That's something else! The lower carbonation lets the smooth and creamy texture slurp around the palate, allowing all the flavor elements to intermingle in an ecstasy of brewing delight. This is a wonderful thing!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,becktone,4.36,"Eye: Black in appearance, like used motor oil, HAHAHA (laugh of a madman) looks great! Head is light brown in color and very creamy. Reminds me of chocolate french silk pie, chocolate mousse, or Chocolate Redi-Whip. This looks truly amazing.  Nose: Nice aroma on this brew. Huge malt aroma. Lots of chocolate aroma, roasted/burnt malt aromas. Aroma could be a bit more potent all in all.  Tongue: Lots of great dark flavors here. Chocolate in the foreground with roasted/burnt malt flavors make up the primary profile of this brew. Alcohol is also detectable and warms the stomach. Hops are there in just enough of a presence to balance the brew. Hop flavor is also notable, not in the foreground but detectable nonetheless-floral.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Great feel in the mouth. Very full bodied and creamy, perfect pairing for dessert, or drink this as a dessert. Also as mentioned before warms a bit as it goes down. They don't get better than this, feels perfect in the mouth. This beer is one I could drink all night, it is that good.

Looks very good.  Smell is textbook stout, the key here is that everything is balanced and under control. Roasted coffee, lots of chocolate, warming booze. Very good.  Taste is very similar, thick and creamy mouthfeel, too. A damn fine stout.

Tastes great - again, dark chocolate, espresso, licorice and a healthy portion of citrusy hops, giving the sweet and creamy aspect a balancing tartness and nice finish. This is fantastic.

Some hints of fruit that smelled almost like strawberries. Some hoppiness was also present.  Nice sweetness on the front palate. The sweetness was followed by bitter, dark chocolate notes. The same strawberry fruit flavors came through in the taste. Nice, mellow hoppiness on the back palate. Very long finish. The flavors just went on and on.  Low carbonation and insanely rich and creamy mouthfeel. Some alcohol came through in the tasting but not the nose. Very drinkable beer that reminds me of Storm King...or maybe it is the other way around. I don't know which was brewed first.

287,1444,Domingo,4.76,"Thanks to kryptic for this bottle. I'll make this review short and sweet. If you like Imperial stouts, this is one of the better ones out there. While some tend to by drier and focused more on the roasted flavors, this one's sweeter and has more of a molasses focus. Even though this one isn't oak aged, it has some vanilla hints that I really enjoyed as well. The only real knock on it is that's it doesn't have much carbonation, but it's not a major issue. Still, it lowers the appearance and mouthfeel scores a little. This brew hides it's 10.5% abv. better than almost any of the others. Still, this is an excellent Imperial stout, and one I'd seek out if it were available here in Colorado. I'd like to put this in a taste test with Yeti, Stone,and Storm King. If it had a little more carbonation, it would be exactly on par with them in my eyes.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,GClarkage,4.85,"11/24/07- Received via trade with Lou91.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with a code marked 6672 on the bottom of the back label. Not a clue what that means. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Very black in color. 3/4 inch milk chocolate colored head. Head has nice staying power. Lace streaks and spots and patchwork remain after the finish.  Smell- Strong nose of molasses, deep sweet malt, coffee, licorice and chocolate. Full house in this nose. One of the better ones out there.  Taste- Wow, this is right up there with my all time favorite tasting imperials. Huge milgled flavors of dark chocolate, roasted fresh coffee beans and mollasses. Sweet and dark like candy. Just an explosion of flavors that meld so well together. Hops are there, but come out more in the aftertaste than the actual consumption.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, viscous, extremely mouthcoating. Thick and chewy, but unlike cough syrup. Medium carbonation level with a bitter aftertaste that gets stronger and stronger.  Drinkability- Abv is noticeable, but doesn't seem like the 11.5% Seems high though. Damn I wish I could get these out here. May have to do some mail order. Top notch stuff that competes with Stone, Alesmith and a few other ones IMO.

The taste was strong like a Russian stout and very stout indeed. The thick coffee taste blended well with the smokey chickory taste that oozed around in my mouth. I will buy this beer again. Bell's makes a fine product.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BeerBelcher,3.94,"Quite a nice imperial stout. I remember having this perhaps 2 years ago, and being a bit turned off by it, but my how my tastes have changed. This beer is not the biggest imperial stout I've had, but still has plenty to offer.  It poured a bit viscous, and was the opaque black that characterizes the style. A pretty thick cappuccino colored head topped it. Aroma was of liquorice, chocolate and coffee. Flavor was definitely more liquorice-y...gave a nice sweetness to the beer and accompanied the dark malt. Mouthfeel was full but not syrupy and was quite nice.  I don't know why it's taken me so long to return to this beer. It is a winner!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,malcontent,4.16,"The black body that doesn't allow an iota of light in is mounted by an unmovable flinger of khaki-colored head. Simply beautiful.  Layers of aromas stack up as following; chocolate, leather, smoke, cinnamon, and butter. Dark fruit surfaces upon further inspection. Nice.  Roasted malt jumps out right away accompanied by a bittersweet chocolate that never relents. Much less dark fruit here instead hints of juniper and earth are the supporting flavors. A strong coffee taste finishes as part of a dual bitterness along with a shocking (and welcome) hop kick. Falls a bit short of greatness due to the aforementioned hop character; the aggressive nature makes me think they went with Chinook or Challenger or another freakish varietal.  Creamy and rich without ever feeling sticky or oily. Carbonation is certainly there preventing the listlessness the style sometimes suffers from.  It's obviously a dastardly strong beer but the alcohol is scarcely detectable. I have had a few substandard bottles of this in years past. However, it appears as though Bells' has worked out the kinks with Expedition and they now have a beverage firing on all cylinders.

287,1444,joe1510,4.2,"12oz Bottle $15.00 6-Pack Bell's General Store  Packaged 10/25/07  This is a fresh bottle consumed on 11/23/07. Expedition Stout pours midnight black and actually swallows up the light present. A one finger faded brown head grew on the pour and fell rather quickly to a thin skim coat leaving somespotted lacing on it's way down. An expected expierence with the high abv.  The aroma starts off with some deeply and freshly roasted barley. This roastiness is consistent throught the aroma and everything else is just a compliment. Deeply roasted coffee beans, a quick flash of dark fruit, quick lactic quality on the second half, and a flash of spicy alcohol and mild hops on the backend.  Flavor goes hand in hand with the aroma. There's deep roasted qualities from both coffee and malts. Lactic, still green from the freshness, a touch of dak fruit, and a nice alcohol spiciness on the swallow. It's actually nice to get an alcohol kick from an RIS since most don't let the alcohol add the complexity needed.  Body is heavy but leaning more toward the medium side of the spectrum than the hugely creamy side. Alcohol fumes exhale through the nose. Spiciness warms my cheeks. There's more of a hop presence than tasted or smelled and it leaves the tongue somewhat beat up.  This, especially in it's raw young age, is a sipper without a doubt. I could easily drink a couple in a night but that's about all.  Another great beer from Bell's. Their stouts are above verage to outstanding. This is one that leans toward outstanding. I reviewed this one while it was very fresh. Up next will be an ged example and this beer ages with the best of them.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass (DATE CODE: 8145: Packaged on September 14th, 2007).... oops! Improper glassware.... oh well.... let's see what happens... The head formed up to 1-1/2 inch and it wasn't THAT hard of a pour. It was rocky tan and very thick. The lacing was VERY Pronounced. The beer was a deep ebony.  The nose was of chocolate/caramel/charcoal and burnt malt.  The taste was very good. Charcoal, dark chocolate, sweet malt but with a burnt finish. AND a big alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, robust.... quite good. I have to try my 4 favorite RIS's side by side one day.... will this ever happen?.... I doubt it... they are all so close, it's difficult to differentiate them.  Right now (11-20-2007) I think they're pretty even.

287,1444,sacrelicio,4.36,"Legendary stout, my first taste of it. Beautiful appearance, total pitch midnight in a glass topped with creamy mocha head, rocky with lacing to boot. Smell is good, but doesn't leap out like expected. Still, nice sublime chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is intense. Very bitter, but rich with coffee, chocolate, wood, and spice. As it warms, green pepper and green olive notes reveal themselves. Mouthfeel is amazing, hefty yet with a lift that elevates this to the exceptional. Drinkable, not easygoing, but you would certainly like another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,soulgrowl,3.87,"Appearance: Tamari-thick blacker-than-midnight opaque black. Spotty mocha latte brown head with poor retention.  Smell: Smoked cherries - does that make sense? Because that's what comes to mind. Extremely roasty and deeply fruity, a massive malt anvil. Light soy sauce, sherry with lots of warm alcohol, honey graham crackers, sweet caramel, apple jelly, brown sugar on toasted wheat bread. Moist, molassesy gingerbread and lots of raisins, Cracklin' Oat Bran... I could go on. Insanely complex, and in a somewhat atypical way - low on chocolate and coffee aromas, high on grain aromas. Clean, acidic, oily hops add a fine, pointed spice, distilled by the volatile alcohol.  Taste: Weird - spicy as hell from the alcohol and hops, with burnt coffee, 90% cacao chocolate, tangy sherry, aniseseed spice. Aggressive alcohol impedes the full development of the malts' nuances (if they're there) on the palate, which is sort of a shame. This could probably improve with a year or two in the cellar. Piney, Goldings-esque hops stoke the flames of alcohol for a hot, spicy finish with a blossom of chocolate and tannic nut notes, similar to an Snickers bar laced with rum.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and very, very thick - yet somehow, not syrupy at all.  Drinkability: Aggressive as hell, and in my opinion, not complex enough to warrant it. Not bad - try it if you like Stone's RIS - but not my favorite.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,malty,4.67,"Batch 7817: Fall 2007 - gave it a good year to age in the cellar.  Force poured - pitch black with a khaki head almost 3"" high. Very dense & creamy head.  Chouffe coffee liqour-esqe scents; basically high-grade coffee spirits drenched in bitter dark chocolate, dark fruits; figs, black cherries, black strap molasses - all up in your nose!  Smooooth deep flavors of gourmet espresso, dark chocolate powder dissolved into thick cream with marshmallows and rum. Intoxicating flavors that scream (actually moan) rich and full-on deep dark and devilish flavors I already mentioned.  Mouthfeel is oily slick and quite velvety. Ultra full-bodied with fine carbonation at the perfect level. Long, full, lingering bold dark malty/liqouresque finish.  Drinkability is good. I don't know how well I'd be operating after a couple/few of these - but I'd give it the 'ole college try.  Overall an ale that I wasn't truly able to appreciate a couple years ago (this is my 2nd review). After sampling the bourbon barrel version at the Great Taste of the Midwest a couple years ago (poured by Larry Bell himself) and several stints with Kentucky Breakfast & original Breakfast Stout, Ive been tempered and educated enough to truly appreciate the masterpiece this stout truly is. This RIS is utmost decadent and supremely balanced, and with just enough understated attitude (kinda like Billy Jack) to kick your ass if you mishandle it. I'm humbled to think I gave this a poor rating just over two years ago. This is one of the finest HUGE ales I've ever had the pleasure to drink.

Very formidable looking poured in to a tulip glass.  Amazing aroma; primarily heavily roasted malt and spent coffee grounds. Earthy and robust. Lots of bitter cocoa. Fills the nostrils. Exactly what I look for in a RIS.  Again the flavor is primarily of heavily roasted; dark malty goodness. Rich and decadent. Black coffee and bitter dark cocoa. Some toffee sweetness. Deep caramelization. A bit of milk chocolate comes through in the finish. As does a good amount of warmth. Some booze and dark fruit are there too. Earthy and complex with just a hint of smoke. All the fundamental characteristics that make this style great.  Thick and creamy on the palate with low carbonation and a somewhat syrupy texture. Again there is some nice warmth in the finish that rounds out this amazing beer. One of the best examples of a RIS I can think of. Such a great selection.

Pours deep black, not a trace of red edges. The head is brown (actually brown), about one finger head, and lasts forever. The lacing hold well too, generally a solid wall down the glass.  Deep roasted flavors with some bitter chocolate. Some hopiness is detectable, mostly as a citrus like flavor, although it's masked well by the bitterness of the malts. The alcohol is hidden well, considering it's amount. Full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. The finish is 95% barly, 5% bitter hops.  This is one exceptional stout. One reason to keep it out of the nonic is so you don't drink it too fast. Recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Forms a large, voluminous sticky dark cocoa head with excellent retention and lacing. Very nice looking beer. Nose of heavily roasted grains, big malts, lots of herbal hops, vanilla, walnut (a little more subdued than prior versions) and a wisp of alcohol. Mouthfeel is big and coating. Big bodied, but not as big as I remember it..certainly not as oily. Hrmm, off-flavors galore...the requisite cocoa, prunes, and big dark malts are there, but it has a very definite ""homebrew"" plastic-y pang, and by that I mean, there are some off-flavor fusels and aldehydes (but not in a good way). It reminds me almost exactly of a RIS I brewed a long time ago..fermented it too warm and it kinda had this funky rubbery taste. Bitterness is moderate. The finish is kinda rubbery...tastes likes plastic and bleach.  Hrmm, quite the disappointment. I'm glad I didn't pick up a 6'er of this.

287,1444,Blybloke,4.68,"I love this time of year. Just bought this and sixer of Sierra Nevada Celebration. I've had this before and it's nice to compare the flavors year to year.  Poured pitch black into a snifter. The caramel-colored head rose an inch and a half. Lace in curtains after about 5 minutes. A gorgeous and intimidating beer.  The alcohol is perhaps a bit too prevalent in the nose but... it still smells incredible - the old stand-bys introduce themselves: toffee, chocolate, coffee, figs, licorice, caramel and banana. But, over everything, there's just a small fraction too much alcohol.  Taste is what you'd expect from the pour and the aroma. It's one of the most complex flavors I've ever come across in 33 years of food and drink. Everything in the aroma is represented here in spades. Plus there's a pleasant subtle sting of alcohol as this clocks in at 10%+ abv.  Mouthfeel is heavy, thick and oily. It leaves a syrupy film wherever it touches on the palate. This is as heavy a stout as you'll come across. Simply wonderful.  This is a perfect beer for a feast, or perhaps to sip while you stare at the fire.

287,1444,stuckonhops,4.9,"I had heard about this beer and was told i should try it and also was recommended by many people. I decided to see if it would live up to expectations. Which it did and also surpassed mine so so much.  A-- EXTREMELY dark. Not a speckle of light passes through. The head has to be formed manualy during the pour. Be careful though, on my first pour i tried to induce head and it grew VERY slow but made almost my whole pint glass foamy.(rookie mistake i guess). The head is a definet cocoa color, looks like cocoa foam to say the least.  S-- smells of roasted malts and coffee. also hints of chocolate and maybe fig? definetly an alcohol smell but not at all overwhelming as in some ALES.  T-- WOW WOW WOW. as i said it is amazing. first sip you taste alcohol with roasted malts and a semi-sweet cocoa finish. as you go on the alcohol COMPLETELY diminishes fairly quickly. After that it becomes a battle between the fig and chocolate with hops setting in. I have been so amazed with the way all the flavors play against each other in such harmony its ridiculus.  M-- very thick and coats the mouth and tounge with so many flavors i think you bite lemon and this beer would still shine through. very nice.  D-- another one to be careful with. after the first one you may be inclined to keep going. but trust me, pace yourself more than a nascar driver this one will take you for a ride...

After reading this site, I decided that this would be a reasonable choice.  Bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Jet black w/ a dark toffee colored head.  Smell: Not a whole lot of aroma. Smells of burnt grains, a hint of chocolate, and a little bit of alcohol.  Taste: Nice strong bite initially. Pleasant roasted coffee flavors mixed in with toffee and caramel flavors. A little sweet. Finishes w/ a nice bitterness. One of the best things about this beer is that I don't really taste the ABV that is listed. I barely taste the ABV at all.  Mouthfeel: Very heavy, rich mouthfeel. Despite this, it is quite smooth and relaxing. Good carbonation.  Drinkability: I was quite afraid of Imperial Stouts before trying this beer. I had always thought it would taste more like bourbon than beer. This beer is not like that at all. It is similar to a nice dry stout, but there is much more complexity there.

Smell: Decent smell of roasted chocolates and nuts, a rather large alcohol smell present as well, which takes away from it a bit.  Taste: Very good taste here. Starts off slightly sweet, with a taste of the chocolates and a bit of a fruity taste. I'm thinking raisins and figs. After that comes the roasted nutty flavor, which is then overpowered by hops and alcohol. As you go, this beer improves, with the alcohol and hop flavor slowly fading, giving this an everchanging, complex taste throughout the glass.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and chewy. One of the thickest beers I've had. Coats the mouth very nicely and leaves whichever flavor you are getting at the end behind.  Drinkability: Very good beer. Could see this being a staple this winter. The only hold-ups could be the thickness and the ABV. Both of which could eventually prove to be too much.

287,1444,InsolublePancake,4.22,"The fourth and final installment in my Bell's stout tasting. I intentionally saved this one for last because... well, you know, I heard it was supposed to be good or something.  A- Inky black with a nice tan head that dissipates over the course of about a minute, leaving behind a silky lace. Nice.  S- Oh man... wow. This doesn't give off the typical stout aromas of burnt toast and coffee. No, this has aromas of sweet dark chocolate, raspberries, and licorice. There is a slight burnt edge to the aroma, enough to let you know that this is a stout and not some kind of chocolate liqueur. Slight alcohol fumes invade the nostrils as well, leaving a fruity aroma that lingers in the nose for a couple of seconds. Amazing.  T- Starts off sweet with chocolate and dark fruit flavors. More burnt edges, with the roasted malt coming into play a little more than the aroma indicated. The alcohol is definitely present, but not in a bad way; it's definitely not overwhelming. What's surprising in this beer is the substantial hop bitterness. The hops only add a touch of flavor ( vague leafy taste), but contribute a lot of bitterness, which I don't think really jives with the rest of the flavor.  M- Thick and syrupy with a nice fizzy carbonation that somehow works for this beer.  D- Definitely a pleasure to drink, but it can only go so far. One is enough.  A fantastic stout to be sure, and one of the best-smelling beers I've ever had. However, the flavor falls a little short of my personal gold standard (Stone), so I'd have to rate this beer as slightly inferior. I believe that some aging would greatly improve this beer as it should mellow out the bitterness a bit. As it is, it's fantastic, but it could be better.

So I figure I'll grab a nice relaxing Bell's Brown ale. Maybe that mental exhaustion was too much, as I uncorked my only bottle of Expedition Stout. Apparently this was that special occasion I was waiting for...  Note: The guy at the store said this was last year's batch... no real way to tell. 12oz bottle to pint glass.  Appearance: A beauty, A dark mocha tan sits perched atop a black body. The head rises up as the beer cascades a bit, and then settles to a finger. Will be interesting to see where this goes at almost 11%ABV. Update: down to a nice covering, with some good sticky lacing.  Smell: Chocolate, burnt, smokey undertones. Toffee and some mocha beans. Fantastic.  Taste: Both myself and Peter noticed how strong it is right off the bat. And as that first sip sinks in I can already feel it warming my stomach. Clearly not for the faint of heart. Initial sweetness gives way to a burnt undercurrent with notes of coffee beans and chocolate. Gone is the toffee and smoked flavours, but present is a bit of an exepected hop twang. If this is last years, and this has mellowed out... one can only imagine what it tastes fresh.  Mouthfeel: The flavours just linger and linger. The carbonation level is great. Perfect for a stout, in no way overwhelming, yet there.  Drinkability: Certainly not the beer I was looking for at this time of night, or on a Wednesday, but alas... It is a sipping beer.  Final thoughts: The addition of Bell's to the Mid-Atlantic market has brought many treats over the last year. And while I do like the two hearted IPA, I can't say enough about their stouts. Kalamazoo stout is great, double cream stout is great, and this one, oh this one is right up there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours an oily blackish/brown with a pleasing mocha colored head, coffe and sweet on the nose, I taste coffee and perhaps a bit of unsweetened cocoa, heavy but not quite as heavy as you might think it should be (as far as I'm concerned it's perfect for the style), nice finish that hangs around for a while.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,markaberrant,4.7,"A - jet black, big and creamy dark tan head. Sticking lacing. Head does not hold up that great, but readily comes back with a swirl of the glass.  S - HUGE figgy/raisin notes, some cocoa undertones, not exactly what I think of when it comes to stout aroma, but it is awesome.  T - big dark fruit sweetness to start, it just washes over your mouth like a tidal wave on a beach, but then as it recedes, a smooth chocolately finish slowly reveals itself. Hop character and bitterness are both low, although I don't see how they could possibly compete with the malt anyways.  M - Chewy, creamy, sticky, soft; just a lucious mouthfeel. Huge alcohol, but oh so refined.  D - Amazing.  I am totally blown away by this beer. I don't know if my brain and tastebuds could handle anything much bigger or complex. The best beer I have had to date.  Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,seaoflament,4.23,"I have about 3 of these and all came from different people, so I don't know who exactly to thank, I guess all three.  This bottle has a number 7817 on the back label (bottled February 1, 2007).  Wow, pours incredibly dark with a huge amount of mocha colored foam that almost overflowed over my glass. The foam lasts, and lasts, and lasts.  Big roasted malt aroma complemented with cocoa, chocolate covered raisins & cherries, wet grains, and a faint fruity alcohol presence in the background. Some earthy hop notes also seem to be there along with some woodsy tones.  Tastes of bitter-sweet chocolate, roasted and chocolate malts, cocoa, some fruit and alcohol. My only complaint is that it tastes a little hot and the alcohol is too noticeable.  Mouthfeel is thick and well rounded. Dry and modest bitter finish.  I think I'll keep the other two beers for a few more months as I see this is a beer than will improve with age. Very tasty RIS, but I wasn't overly won.  ***update 7/14*** Thanks to illinismitty over at RateBeer for this vintage bottle. Batch 6811 which the website says is from April 26, 2005.  A good ""hiss"" when I crack the cap. Pours dark and viscous, I didn't think I would get some head but about an inch of mocha colored foam covered the head of the beer. The head lasted for about a minute and reduced to a thin ring. 4  The aroma is a mixture of dark and milk chocolate, cherries, roasted malts, lots of molasses, maple syrup and various sweet, dark fruits. I'm still picking up more things; sugar covered raisins, plums, maybe just a hint of soy sauce (but very little), and salty meat. After a few moments I can pick up a bit of oxidation, like wet paper. After the beer settles the aroma is pretty tame and the dominant fragrance is a syrupy sweet one, not in a bad way. 4  Taste is pretty much in line with the aroma. First I get a bid dose of chocolate (dark, milk, syrup) and then I get the sweet, dark, fruits in the middle which is quickly overtaken by some roasted barley and finishes with some coffee and toast. Second sip revealed more sweetness in the form of molasses, maple syrup and brown sugar. A couple more sips later I pick up some cherries, grapes and apricot pit in the aftertaste. A little bit of anise flavor half-way through the beer. Near the last fourth of the beer I can taste some dry graham crackers, multi-grain bread, a bit of vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. 4.5  Mouthfeel is syrupy, thick, but the low lever of carbonation makes this one pretty drinkable...sticky lips after each sip. 4.5  Pretty tasty stuff, glad I traded for this one and will have to get more of this to age. 4.5",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,John_M,3.83,"Was very pleasantly surprised to see this on tap at Capone's the other night.  This has to be one of the oddest looking stouts I've ever seen. The beer looks more like a cup of dark hot chocoate then beer, with a hazy chocolate appearance, good lacing and decent head retention. On the nose one gets some more chocolate (quite a bit of it in fact), with a hint of vanilla, coffee and cherry. The flavors are replicated on the palate, especially in terms of the chocolate. However, there's also almost what I would call an underlying grittiness to this beer, which while fine for the most part, hurts the finish a bit I think. There is considerable bitterness in the finish, and at least for me, that coupled with the sweet chocolate and high abv. makes this a difficult beer to drink.  This is absolutely a solid beer, but is just not my cup of tea.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,errantnight,4.31,"The first Russian Imperial Stout to really blow me away... (not at the time of this review, but ever... I first experienced this beer over a year ago, and it's stuck with me... this bottle was picked up a couple months ago when I was in Iowa)  Pours like motor oil, with a gorgeous deep brown head. The lacing and head are definitely on the thin side, but it sticks around as well as any. It just looks fantastic.  The aroma and taste are definitely dominated more by raisins, prunes, and coffee. The chocolate/mocha notes are present but subdued, and particularly towards room temperature rich, french pressed coffee and a rich sweetness providing great balance. A dessert, for sure. Aroma could be more intense, but it hands in there nicely. A delightful sipper.  So rich and thick that it doesn't go down as nicely as Stone's, or Smutty's (two of my favorites), but I love this beer, and I pick up a few every time I'm in the midwest. Even at 12 oz I like this best as a beer to share at the end of an evening, best with a little bit of chocolate.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It has a warm black, chocolate, and roasted malt scent. It's rich and creamy with a stiff non malted roasted barley aroma. The taste is great. It is rich with malt complexity. It starts out smooth and creamy with a chocolate malt taste. Then it quickly warms with a roasted malt feel and finishes with a bold black malt blast. This is a damn tastey beer. The mouthfeel is great. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the perfect RIS. It's bold and challenging with loads of flavor and malt complexity. It's warm and inviting.

I will highly recommending refridgerating it then let it rest in your glass a little while. Great oily opaque black color with a nice tan head that hangs on for dear life, lacing never stops. Smell is awesome with a hint of sweet malty carmel, coffee and anise. taste is much like the aroma, maybe not quite as pronounced, but now you find the hops, hidden just below the malty flavors. in the mouth this beer feels like a smooth chewy stout like it should.

287,1444,younger35,4.5,"Received in a trade from tpd975. Have wanted to try this brew for quite some time and cant wait to take a sip. Drank from my Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale pint glass.  Appearance- Pours the blackest of blacks. This is by far the murkiest, dirtiest, oiliest, grimiest beer Ive ever seen and its beautiful. Thin dark brown head that slowly recedes leaving a soft cap and fluffy collar. Fantastic lacing is randomly left around the side of the glass. Smell- Rich chocolate and sweet molasses seem to jump out of the glass into my nostrils. Dark ripe cherries and hints of citrus are surprisingly prevalent and stronger than any other IRS that Ive smelled. Roasted coffee, caramel and toffee help bring all the scents together allowing some alcohol to show. Incredible! Taste- Extremely in your face, brash flavors that scream at my taste buds. Starts with a roasted toffee sweetness that tickles the tongue and quickly gives way to dark roast coffee. Nice bitter fruity kick reminiscent of raspberries shocks the palate back to its senses. Finishes with a slight alcohol kick that leaves an espresso like aftertaste that doesnt seem to ever leave. So amazingly good but honestly was somehow expecting more after the nose. Amazing how big everything is in this brew. Mouthfeel- So thick and rich it seems to coat your entire mouth in an oily, viscous substance. Velvety smooth with tiny carbonation that fits perfectly. Drinkability- This is definitely a beer that should be sipped and slowly enjoyed. Its so complex and flavorful that Im almost at a loss for words. Wish I had more access to beers from Bells but so far the two that Ive had (Two Hearted) are tremendous. I enjoyed this beer thoroughly and cant thank tpd975 enough. Terrific beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,elricorico,4.39,"Very deep brown, near black and opaque. Only a thin ring of tan head.  Smells of rich coffee and chocolate liquer. Very sweet and roasty impression.  Brown sugar sweetness throughout. Coffee rich through the front half and roasted bitterness in the finish. Well balanced. Alcohol warms but isn't overwhelming. Very nice.  Thick, almost syrupy, and carbonation just barely cuts through. Works well for the style.  This was very nice, one of my favorites of the style so far.

287,1444,BlindPig,3.33,"A- About a 1/4-1/2"" mocha head on a pitch black body. When pouring it looks like black ink. S- Big roasted malts, maple syrup, toffee, black currants, hints of coffee, brownies, alcohol, and just a tiny hint of grass hops. T- Alcohol, light syrup, brownies, burnt malts...lots of them, black currants, and a really dry medium bitterness on tongue. It is mostly made up of burnt malts and different roasted flavors. Alcohol comes in after tickling the tongue and warms up back of throat and makes it quite hot. M- Really dry finish! Full body with low carbonation. D- It is alright. I think it focuses to much on just the different burnt flavors for my liking.

287,1444,akorsak,4.32,"A snifter glass served at Capone's during both Founders/Bell's nights.  A: The stout is pitch black, no other words adequately describe the dark depths of this stout. Unfortunately there was no head atop this black beauty, besmirching the nice appearance.  S: The nose is roasted malts, dark thick grains that have bready and vinous characteristics. Some sweeter grains punch up the strong burnt aromas.  T: The taste is right in line with the big aromas from the nose. There is a thick roasted burnt malt flavor, bitter and strong that remains throughout the drink. That burnt flavor is nicely matched up against a graham sweetness. The alcohol underlying this beer is huge, completely unable to hide itself even amongst the abundance of flavor here. The finish is burnt and bitter, leaving a long full taste in the mouth.  M: The stout is huge, easily overwhelming the tastebuds with dark roasted flavors and big alcohol. This is not a stout for the faint of heart.  D: A snifter is great, more than one and you'll be seein' double.

287,1444,Budlum,4.85,"This stout pours very thick, nearing a maple syrup texture. A tall, dense, deep brown head forms while pouring. The body of this stout is dense and about as black as it gets. Head retention is excellent. This is what premium stout look like.  A short burst of sharp, roasted barley flavors hit the nose before a sweet rush takes over. Smells of licorice, tobacco, brown sugar, prunes, nutmeg, hops and espresso appear in a complete display of power. Alcohol is notable on the nose but it provides just enough strength to tingle the nose without overpowering the senses. Excellent all around.  A sweet rush of chocolate, espresso and candied sugars lead the flavors of this beer with authority. A blend of dark fruits and faint spices are joined by a powerful, charred and roasted barley flavor backed by a strong hop presence. An alcohol presence is provided by a mild burn. The finish is long, epic actually. The strong hop flavors and charred barley mixed with pipe tobacco seem to hold forever. This is a top notch stout.  The mouthfeel is very luxurious and the body is quite thick. Mild carbonation is present but this beer is just a little too oily to be perfect. Overall, the mouthfeel is still supreme.  Drinkability is very good for a stout with this level of flavor. The strong flavors and long finish should make this a slow sipper but this beer just disappears from the glass.

Smelt of strong dark chocolate and mocha without even putting my nose up to it. Upon closer inspection,strong dark chocolate, dried plums, mocha, burnt grain, sherry.  Taste was upfront rich sweet dark chocolate, strong bitter burnt grain, moderate sherry and vinous bitterness, moderate fruity esters, like dried plums or figs, followed by a harsh bitter burnt grain and yeast, and sherry with moderate chocolate sweetness on a long lingering bitter burnt finish.  Palate was full bodied, creamy, silky and viscous, softly but slightly stinging carbonation, strongly astringent and moderately alcoholic.  Overall, a good strong Imperial stout.

287,1444,mentor,4.8,"Batch #7817, purchased from The Beer Depot (Ann Arbor) and hand carried back to Colorado for my enjoyment. Pours a strong 2 finger dark dark brown head. Cascading carbonation in a pitch liquid. The head just hangs around. Beautiful. Smells sour chocolate milky. Sweet dark caramel scorch. Alcohol is prominent and clean. The alcohol and black patent mix well together.  Tastes wow. Complex grains and sweetness with an alcohol that just pierces through and tempers things. Amazing complexity and delicousness. Black patent sour with strong roast and a thick creamy malt sweetness. Roast is a drying factor, as is the clean alchol...but overall, the dessert-like malt sweet wins out. Molasses. Some rough grassy, which could be fusel alcohol, but I think is more likely from an old school hop like Bullion. The only improvement I'd like to see is a touch less overall sweetness to amke for a bit more prominence of the caramel sweet that is under all the dark grains.  Mouthfeel is super thick with modest carbonation. Carb sting blends into the black patent sour and alcohol sting/warmth. July 21st is a brutal hot summer night in Colorado, but I'm still loving this thick heavy stout. Drinkablity is stunning. Yeah, I'd take another.  I've had this beer several times before and always remember it as a really good beer. I always remember it standing up to up to big expectations. That's tough to do. This beer is about as good as it gets. I could see some reviewers hitting the sweet as too much, but I find the alcohol and hops are a counterpoint that makes this beer blanaced and complex.

Poured a serious inky jet black color, that no light could pass through. About a half inch of somewhat thin, dark brown head formed. Head quickly dispersed into a thin ring atop the beer. Left little lace behind. Strong chocolate, bitter coffee, some almost oaky notes, followed by a ton of alcohol. Also noted were caramel, toffee, and some nice roasted aromas. The smell was almost mouth watering. Tons of flavor. More strong coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, roasted malts. All of this finished with a hot alcohol burn in the back of the throat. The alcohol seems much more pronounced than I can remember. Very little carbonation was noticed. Mouthfeel was thick, full, syrupy and chewey. Awesome.

Perhaps it was because of that excellent beer that I thought this one wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be..  Poured opaque with an off-white medium head with medium retention. Surprisingly light in the nose. Some coffee and roast with malt sweetness, but nose overall lighter than I thought it would be. Flavor exhibited a blend of roastiness, malt, with a hint of chocolate.

Having to go through that torture, I asked for a couple samples alongside, just to pass the time.  After watching the game for an inning & a half, I made the decision to ask for a knife & fork. That thing would of easily lasted till the weekend had I not intervened. :P  Ovaltine. It looks like Ovaltine. Rich, frothy, chocolate head that just wouldn't quit. The body wasn't black, but close.  Strong scents of burnt sugar, whole milk, rum cake, tapoica, & mesquite.  My God, this is Ovaltine! Just so insanely rich & frothy. Creaminess only found in the most fattening of milk shakes. I realize the misguided impressions of nitro, but still, what a joyous invention.  I don't particularly like coffee, so enjoying this beer is even more of a surprise. None of that stale, over-roasted crap(burnt), but genuinely fresh, intense, aromatic, & just plain tasty java. When added in to all this caramel & whole milk I taste, it's just beautiful. As a bonus, the dryness beats back the now subtle bitterness into a corner that's just barely within reach. Any alcohol that was overly obvious has also been beaten back.

Pours a complete opaque motor oil black with a huge three finger brown head that takes forever to die down to a generous lacing. Stickiness is truly amazing. Probably the best looking RIS I've seen to date. Smell is a sweet caramel malt mixed with a nice dark chocolate and molasses that tingles the nose as well. A bit of alcohol is also present in the smell. Taste has a lot of coffee and espresso to it, much more than the smell leads on, especially the aftertaste. Starts off with a sweet chocolate malt followed by a whole bunch of roasted nut mixed with brown sugar. Some alcohol on the tongue as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich with very little, but just enough, carbonation. I could only have one in a sitting, but I will definitely be drinking this one in the future.

287,1444,kenito799,4.7,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Brought back from the midwest.  Pours an opaque chocolate brown/black, hard pour raises a slowly forming, relentlessly growing chestnut brown head, which slowly recedes...beautiful lacing pattern from the start. One look and you know this is a serious beer.  Dark roasted aroma,chocolate, coffee, and interesing fresh vegetal notes, I guess it's hops. Good dark stout aromas.  This is one amazingly rich and complex brew. Roasted coffee and dark chocolate is the first impression, with some fruity (raspberries!) sweetness, and then spicy allspice-gingerbread underneath. Fantastically drinkable for such a big rich beer. The most impressive aspect for me is the long, evolving finish...a lasting bitterness from the dark roast...then floral grapefruity hoppy bitterness comes in...then your tongue continues to pulsate with flavor and bitterness for a full two minutes, the flavor keeps coming back in waves, perhaps because the rich creaminess of the brew has coated your palate and taken full command...really amazing.  A wonderful after dinner beer to savor and contemplate. This beer definitely passes the ""I am so sad the glass is finished"" test.

287,1444,TexIndy,3.58,"Re-review: original 7/10/07 review at bottom: Brought back from Indy during Xmas. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Back label has bottling code that you can check on website. This one was bottle in late Sept. It was dark black in color even against a light. Slight carb in center with sliding, non-stick lacing. It had a small dark brown head that quickly evaporated into a very thin collar.  The aroma was coffee, dark fruit, roasted malt and still a big hint of the 10.5% ABV. Didn't really enjoy - too much dark fruit and alcohol for me. The taste followed the aroma. Too much dark fruit and alcohol and not enough coffee, roasted malt or chocolate that I find in the RIS that I really enjoy. Creamy texture but too bitter a finish and ABV too present.  Overall, this one misses the mark for me. Shame since I really love most other Bell's and most RIS. One and done (OK two and done since I did re-sample it).  ***Original 7/10/07 review*** 4.5 4.0 3.5 4.0 3.5 Got from my brother-in-law in Indy. Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottling code on back label. It was a dark black color. It had about a finger of dark brown head that settled into a thin film. Slight lacing. The aroma was coffee, roasted malts and a big hint of the ABV. The taste was good but had a really bitter finish that kinda ruined it for me. It got better as it continued to warm but still too much. This is only the 2nd RIS I've had with Siberian Nights being the other. I loved the Siberian so not sure which is more representative of the style but hoping Siberian.

287,1444,jjayjaye,4.62,"Pours an opaque darkness with a wispy head of those cherished tiny bubbles that lend themselves to a soft texture in the mouth. A bunch of lacing present.  The smell is amazing and complex. In fact it changes around the warmer it gets. At about 55deg it starts out with that sweet tootsie roll chocolate aroma that's kicked up by a touch of bourbon. The barrel-aged aroma tends to take over gradually as it warms up. It begins to smell like a Kahlua chocolate then it warms to a steady state choco-cherry-vanilla.  Full bodied, the mouth feel is a horse race. The mouth is being conditioned by the warmth from the alcohol while the smooth mocha flavor demands equal time. That complexity itself is 'MONEY' but it doesn't stop there.  The oak aged flavor of sweet chocolate, light coffee, cherries and vanilla are really pronounced. It finishes with another level of coffee and that java flavor tends to linger nicely.  Definitely one to be savored. The 10.50 % ABV is showcased. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,tpd975,4.04,"Like the java stout I just reviewed this one comes to Florida from Indiana with love from my brother. God bless him.  A: The perfect pouring stout. Nice large 3 finger espresso colored head that settles down nicely to a small pillow atop the brew. There is also very nice lacing down the glass. This one could make People' Magazines 100 most beautiful list.  S: Lacking. There is not much really coming from the glass. I like big bold smells when it comes to beer and this one just don't have it. There is some sweetness that I can detect along with some char of the malt. I wanted nice strong tones of coffee and chocolate, none were found here.  T: The taste is good, but not great. The taste of charred malt is in there, which gives you a sense of coffee. The chocolate taste is of bitter chocolate. To be honest I expected more.  M: This one is thick like a milkshake. The coating is wonderful on your mouth. Had the taste been great this would have helped to put the beer over the top.  D: If this is your cup of tea you could drink several despite the ABV. It goes down rather smooth and hides the alcohol nicely.  Overall: I was expecting this to be Bell's best stout. Right before drinking this one I had a Java Stout which I like sooo much better. I have also had their Kalamazoo stout which I also prefer to this one. I realize those are lighter stouts with this being a RIS. Maybe I was expecting too much coming in to this one. I will revisit in a few days as I have a six pack of it. I will also put a few back to age. Time may be on its side.  I almost feel as though I am being too critical.

287,1444,CharlieMopps,4.6,"A: Pours an oil-like pitch black, topped by two and a half fingers of dense khaki head. Displays excellent retention, some lacing.  S: Chocolate and malt goodness come forth, with a bit of graininess and a hop scent. There is an airiness to it, and a faint hint of alcohol.  T: An immaculate first sip! Introduces itself with a roasted malt character that sticks around and fades in the aftertaste, coupled with a solid chocolate taste that's not overpowering. These two traits are coupled with a smooth middle that slides into an mild alcohol kick, ending with a hop flavor that is unrivaled for its balance to this beer.  M: A combination of great characteristics. Well-carbonated, full bodied and mealy, but shows off a lighter side as well. Somewhat viscous and syrupy, but this too is near perfection.  D: My god, I would have no problem stocking an entire fridge with this stuff. This is one of the best stouts I've had for a couple reasons. For one, its balance of malt and hop flavor is incredible. Two, Bell's hits the mark with the mouthfeel of this stout, making it taste like a benchmark beer, something by which other stouts should be measured. So, in closing, this stuff is damn good, so try it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aromas of sweet malts with a good amount of hops and chocolate. Undertones of coffee and alcohol. Flavor is dry malts, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and some wine. You can feel the alcohol warm your tounge when it hits your mouth. Very well balanced with all flavors weaving together and hiding the alcohol. Full bodied, but a bit more carbonation than I would prefer. Still, a superb imperial stout!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ILiveOffHops,4.57,"Thanks to my brother Sean for the 12 oz purchased at the Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA.  Appearance - Jet black in color. Thin head, but good retention. I love the etching on the bottom of the Chimay glass, it does help produce more head.  Nose - Sweet sweet, roasted, slightly fruity- plums and blackberries.  Taste - Sweet, but not too much, roasted, very chocolately, melted brown sugar, slightly fruity, finishing with an nice roasted acrid bitterness and a slight alcohol taste. The malty, roasted, and, most prominently, chocolately flavors beat down the alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Heavy, smooth, viscious and a little sticky in the finish.  Drinkability - This could be the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. The lack of a sharp or even strong alcohol taste makes it a lot more drinkable to me. Smooth and damn tasty.

287,1444,froggyfrog,4.48,"This beer earns its overall rating on this site honestly. This isn't hype or rarity speaking. This is a damn fine RIS. It's big and syrupy and bad-ass. Let's take a closer look:  A: This beer is an enticing right from the get-go. My snifter bowl fills with a the blackest opaque blackness as the one-finger mocha cream head spreads luxuriously across the top and lingers, languid in its efforts to vacate its perch.  S: Earthy hops and dark roast malts greet the nose. Vienna malt character is apparent with strong notes of creamy toffee and toasted caramel. Heavy coffee and a sage-like spiciness round out the nose.  T: This beers leaves much to be described when it comes to the flavors to be gleaned from its taste. First there is the obvious continuation of flavors picked out in the aroma: caramel, toffee, dark coffee, etc. Herein also lies powdered cacao and espresso roast. Sweet chocolate syrup and lightly toasted barley finish things up.  M: Syrupy is probably a common word used to describe the texture of this beer. Chewy and creamy are also accurate descriptors. The mouthfeel on this beer is really one of its most inspiring features, as velvety and crushed velour-smooth as one could ask for.  D: Drinkable? Absolutely. Though I suppose it depends on the circumstances. For the style this is one of the stronger and also heavier and more filling examples. As my second and last beer of the evening it works perfectly.  Overall Impressions: This is one of those beers that really is a thing unto itself. It may not be for the timid or for those unappreciative of the heavier and darker flavors this world has to offer, but as a nightcap it has few equals. I like how the weighty burnt roast flavors mingle with the super-smooth full-mouth creaminess. I like how the creaminess of the malt comes back on eructation. I like the slightly warming, though otherwise expertly hidden, 11.5% alcohol. Suffice to say: I lock this beer, I lock it a lot.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,kajerm,4.03,"Bottle, batch 7740. Pours thick and black with a finger of brown head that recedes a little and then hangs around, lacing up the glass. Color is right on for an imp-- this is where light goes to die.  The aroma is mostly mixed dark malts-- chocolate, molasses, and coffee in good balance. Some general spices and maybe alcohol. Some notes of dark fruit. There is an undertone of sweetness that ties it all together pretty nicely.  Opens up malty and a little spicy, with coffee flavor appearing mid-palate, which turns into black malt bitterness on the finish. Molasses and restrained alcohol show up in the finish as well. With repeated sips, molasses and dark fruit notes become more evident; the beer also gets hotter. Black patent astringency is strong but not over the top. Outside of the alcohol and maybe being slightly heavy on bitterness, the balance is good.  Boppar's review said his bottle (a previous batch) tasted coiny, but I didn't have that problem at all with this one, even though I've tasted it in bottled Bell's stuff in the past.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, looks and feels like 10W40.  A little hot at times, but weirdly pretty drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mpyle,3.86,"Very opaque with a thick, brown head. Head is dense, creamy, and with a decent linger for the small head size.  A strong chocolately sweet aroma - straightforward but clean. Not much alcohol and no hops in the aroma.  Malty sweet chooclate flavor, nice dark malt roastiness, alcohol evident but controlled. Finishes roasty and sweet. Sweetness doesn't quite approach the cloying level - enough hop bitterness and dark grain bitterness to maintain a semblance of balance.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with lowish carbonation. Alcohol warming evident, as should be for style. Minimal astringency from the dark grains - actually some sensation of chocolate milk - a bit creamy.  Overall a bit sweet, but doesn't deviate too far from its stout roots. Very flavorful without being overpowering. I'm afraid to say I could drink more than one of these, which at 11.5% ABV might not be a good idea!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Doughy, sugary notes and a hint of alcohol in here as well.  Taste is a complex beast, raisin and hops again balancing the chocolatey malts. Alcoholic flavor isn't afraid to rear its beautiful head. Body is thick and creamy and leaves a great bitter finish. This RIS comes on a bit too strong for my liking, despite the fact that is is very tasty.

In all, a fantastic stout.  Appearance: Pours like syrup into my tulip glass. Pitch black with a dark tan head. Gorgeous lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts and a woody aroma with distinct molasses and coffee essence.  Taste: Alcohol more present than expected here. Woodiness is here, too, as is a smoky element I didn't detect in the nose. Definite molasses presence with accents of dark chocolate. Pronounced hop bitterness on the way down, too, like a swift kick in the ass (like you need it with this sucker).  Mouthfeel: Creamy and thick. Light carbonation. Slightly sticky. Just awesome.  Drinkability: It's pretty hefty. A sipper. A damn tasty sipper, but a sipper.

Almost no ""soy sauce"" taste that I associate with most RISs until it warms up a bit. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. The carbonation is all in the head. Well, I'm glad this came in a 12 oz. A 750 would be way too much. This is a heavy beer - a real sipper. The tastes and alcohol are both way aggressive.

There is a coffee and sligth caramel sweetness. it has some nice complexity and balance, but a little too much alcohol taste for me, makes it less smooth for me.

287,1444,soupyman10,4.6,"I tried this beer twice, 10 months apart, and decided to average the scores to create my final score.  BEFORE AGING: Pours jet black beer with nary a hint of brown. Dark tan head with great lacing. Nose is incredible - molasses, roasted malt, raisins, and other dried fruit. Complex and aromatic. Taste is likewise amazing. First roasted malt and coffee. Soon after lots of sweetness, brown sugar. Some light but not offensive alcohol, raisins and apricot, lemon. Closes with good hop bitterness and roasted malt again. Feel is full-bodied and creamy, almost syrupy. Absolutely excellent, one of the best beers I've ever tasted.  AFTER AGING: Tried this one after aging from a sixer for about a 10 months. Pours an exceptional dark black color with a deep orange-brown head that quickly dissolves down to a fine glaze of foam. Looks pretty solid, and the lacing stays with it as the beer drains, although I would have liked the head to stick around a little longer. Nose is extremely sweet: caramel, chocolate malt, and lots of dried fruit. Maybe pomegranate. Breadiness. A nice nose, although you really have to dig at it to get all the aromas out. Felt like I was just about dip my nose in the thing. Flavor is sweet as well. Dried fruit up front, all over the place. Roasted malt shows up in the middle a bit and wears on the tongue, adding some graininess and toning the whole thing down a bit. Alcohol shows up at the back end, although its fairly well hidden in the spicy hops. The hops makes a sort of bitter coffee malt taste. Breadiness as well. Body is low on carbonation (although it feels a bit fizzier as the beer goes on) and high on body - very thick and exceptionally creamy. Interesting to notice that the Bros do not feel this one due to the lack of carbonation. I guess in my mind that's not a problem, and adds to the creaminess of the beer - its almost Guinness-esque. Overall, after a year I expected the alcohol to be non-existent, but its still a fairly strong presence. I guess that sort of diminishes the score for me a little bit. Overall though, quite tasty, still.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

No head just a dark brown rim of lace on the crown. Smells of dark liquer chocolate. Molassas. The aroma is not as punget as I was expecting. Maybe this is because of the age. Huge dark chocolate flavor. Nice bitter hoppiness. Molassas. Slight roasted flavor and a hint of coffee. Spot on for the style with a bit more bitterness. Alcohol is barley noticable. This is one smooth beer. Mouthfeel is creamy, smoooth, with a very minimum carbonation.

A Coffee black/brown frothy head that lingered like an uninvited guest that just won't leave. It seemed like hours and was at least a full 20 min before the head died down sufficiently. The tension mounted as the head retained.  S-Slight rasin, plum, Chocolate, coffee, cream? must be lactose sugars  T-A little sweet, frothy from the force carbonation of the cask. Chocolate malt, Black Patent, non-malted barley, hints of smoke. finish thick and sweet but still black like my lungs back when I smoked clove cigarettes. Sticky on the lips like back when I smoked them as well. Alcohol creeps up and quick. I'm wondering if it's the same percentage it has always been, but 11.5 isn't shabby by a long shot. Oh, hoppiness comes out in the finish as well.  M-Thick like a mouthfull of blood after getting hit with a baseball bat. I'm a little morbid today, let's go closer to thick like eggnog, with almost as much creaminess. I'm glad I had water nearby as well to balance it out so I could drink it all and soak it in over the duration. Slight drying finish.  D-This is by far the best cask conditioned beer I have ever had. I could have drank this all night but only dealt with one due to the tasting after. I regret that I have but one palate to blow away for my community.

Incredible retention, and great patches of lace.  Nose full of roasty malts, tobacco, chocolate and some darker fruits. Floral and citrusy hops in the background. Not as pronounced nose as the bottle or draft version.  Great roasty, chocolate flavors, and dark fruity flavors at the end. The fruits seem to have a slight sourness to them. A good amount of floral bitterness that helps to round all of it out. Very nice.  Full body, nice soft, gentle carbonation, and a creamy mouthfeel.

287,1444,mcallister,4.58,"Sampled on cask at Boston's in Dayton. Been waiting a month for them too tap this and off the pour it's not dissapointing at all. Black as midnight with a 2 inch creamy, fluffy mocha head that has retention that won't quit. Head has not faded after a good 5 minutes and counting...and counting....and counting....and counting.  Chewy caramel aromas with a dark chocolate backing, vanilla, black currant, coffee, hints of strawberry milk? huh, mollasses, and many other dark fruits. Delightful and pleasing to say the least.  As usual a huge masculine, robust, bold beast of a beer. Full of bitter as hell and full of dark bakers chocolate. Caramel with hints of roasty barley stand forward on the mid palate. But damn the bittering hops and pure tannin from the ground coffee and barley shine through the entire palate spectrum.FInish lasts longer than most insect lifetimes. Black and red currants, mollasses, gooey and resiny mouthfeel, hot fudge, creamy and delicious.

287,1444,Boppar,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass with a half-finger of leathery head. Standard evil-looking obsidian black.  Aroma of raisins, molasses and chocolate.  Tastes pretty much the way it smells, but with chocolate far and away the leading flavor. Some alcoholic spiciness, but not nearly as much as one would expect from 11.5% ABV. Lingering dry finish of smoke, leather, spicy hops and... damn it! Pennies! A slight metallic aftertaste knocks this down from a 4.5 to a 4.0 in the flavor department.  Mouthfeel is thick, sticky, and briskly carbonated (much more so than I had expected).  Drinkability is about what you'd expect from a Russian Imperial with 11.5%, which is to say not that much.

287,1444,nickss,3.67,"Poured into a pint glass.  The darkest beer I've ever seen? Quite possibly. Absolutely pitch black with a smallish chocolate colored head. Aside from its intense darkness, nothing to write home about.  Delicious aroma... wine and vinous berries... molasses and even a touch of peppermint,,, quite interesting. Strong toffee notes are intermingled with some coffee as well... fantastic and complex aroma.... so much going on here.  Bam! Bitterness hits the tongue like a freight train.... strong coffee flavours with a huge alcohol kick. Certainly not as balanced as the aroma would have suggested... this one is way too hot and could use a year or more in the cellar. As it warms, it rounds out a bit more... some of the berries come through the bitterness. Still... I'll be aging the rest of these for another time.  The mouthfeel would also be aided by some aging. The carbonation is a bit too active in my opinion, making the beer seem a bit thin (which it most certainly is NOT).  Big time sipper... it's going to take me well over an hour to drain through this one. Will that change as the beer ages? Stay tuned....",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nice strong flavor with bitter aftertaste. Good, but nothing special. Somewhat thick, low carbonation mouthfeel. Average stout. I was dying to try this after seeing some reviews and had a friend bring me a six pack from Michigan since I couldn't find it here in Florida. Was also excited when I poured the first glass (I love seeing a brown head, not white, on a stout) but was disappointed in the taste.

It is pitch black and it makes a nice dark brown head that looks nice but has almost no retention, although it does lace the glass well. Nose is very rich, roasted malts, coffee, burnt sugar, milk and alcohol. It has a very nice, creamy, velvety full body, and it starts sweetish on the palate, finishing dry and bitter, with intermediate layers of roasted malts, hops, chocolate and sugar. Very satisfying with a single small bottle. I might have a new favorite stout; this is one impressive brew, and every time I go back to it, it amazes me more.

287,1444,AltBock,4.72,"12 oz. bottle that has a simple beige with blue edges label that has a picture of a compass or what Bell's thinks the North Star looks like. Above the North Star is the Bell's symbol of 3 big chiming bells and below the North Star is the name of the beer and where the Bell's Brewery is located. The neck label is the same color and has the same picture as the main label, but it's just a small variation of it. The back label has a little blurb about how it ages well, Government warning, refund prices, and a batch number you need to input into their website to see when your beer was packaged. Mine was batch # 7740, which means it was packaged on December 19, 2006. Hopefully this beer isn't like their label, plain and simple. Served in an average Snifter.  Appearance: Do you know what used motor oil looks like? Of course you do. You take the color of the used motor oil, add some black ink into it and you'll come close to what the color of Expedition Stout really is. I'm not exaggerating, it is that black! Just when I thought the color of the beer was really nice, you should see the head of foam. On top of this motor oil/black ink beer was a beautiful 1 finger tan/mocha colored head of foam that had pretty good retention that left behind a small tan film, a few mocha colored rings, and a dab of mocha lace around the glass. After it warms up a little bit, all the film, rings, and lace are gone and looks more like a fine black brandy (if it exists) instead of a really black beer.  Smell: Had a rich complex aroma of alcohol soaked black cherries, roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, a pinch of fresh baked wheat bread, roasted hops, a splash of roasted coffee beans, more alcohol, and then this complex aroma ended with a with a small whiff of bing cherries. I can't get enough of this wonderful aroma! Bell's Brewery just filled the aroma to brink with all the dark and roasted flavors they could find. You need to smell this beer for yourself to believe.  Taste: When I first took a sip of Expedition Stout, my senses were overwhelmed with dark and roasted flavors. I could believe it at first, so I took another sip and got the same reaction. I actually had to build my body's tolerance of Expedition Stout before I could take a big sip of it. It has most of the same flavors that are in aroma with just a few differences here and there. The taste was chock full of roasted malts, dry roasted hops, bitter dark chocolate, a touch of sweet caramel, roasted coffee beans, dark fruits, and then finished with a slight alcohol burn. I would have thought the dark and roasted flavors would have enhanced the alcohol burn, but instead it calmed it down to just a slight taste of it.  Mouthfeel: If you haven't guessed already, it's definitely full bodied with a complex aftertaste that's almost as complex as the initial taste. The aftertaste was filled with roasted malts, a few roasted hops, dark fruits, and a pinch of alcohol. For a beer that has a 10.5% ABV (that's what Bell's website says), the alcohol was actually quite mellow. It came in like a tired lion and came out like a ferocious lamb. Just watch out because this will probably sneak up on you.  Drinkability: This beer is nothing like the plain and simple label that's adorns the bottle. It's in fact the complete opposite. Is it well suited for November storms and trips across the Sahara? It sure is! In fact it's suitable for any journey, just as long you're not driving there. I don't know about you, but I sure could go for another one. If drinking another one is wrong, then I don't want to be right. Another winner from Bell's Brewery! I'm finally going to end this review by saying this beer is black gold and worth ever penny.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The body is so black its unquestionable opaque, mahogany times four, slightly oily, but o so pretty. The smell is straight up dry roast coffee, some buiscuit, dark chocolate, nutty notes, with a pinch of salt and smoke, but just a pinch (which becomes much more apperent as it warms up). Alcohol is almost undetectable in the nose. Hops are not very present, except for a tinge of earth or grass / dirt. This is definitely a malt forward beer. Taste is excellent I might even say huge"" tons and tons of roasted malt, black patent, good maybe crystal or even Munich malt sweetness, which is balanced excellently by a tasty IBU. I get roast coffee, chocolate, home made soy sauce (only in the good way), biscuit, with that same slight smoky salty flavor.

287,1444,abcsofbeer,4.28,"Poured from a bottle with no drink by date. The appearance is quite nice with a pitch black color topped by a brown head, two fingers high and perfect. The head is a color brown that I rarely see in a beer, but, it is frothy and leaves some very nice lacing.  The aroma is brought in as sweet and roasted malts along with some caramel notes. The roasted malts have a small sense of burntness. The taste is excellent and a couple of times, it took me by surprise with its boldness. There are definitely the roasted malt and coffee flavoring, but, there is a very nice addition of some very tangy hop flavor, which you don't expect from a stout.  As the beer warms, the flavor deepens and becomes sweeter. There is a distinctive fruit flavor in there. The alcohol is present and accounted for and rises up with the warming of the beer.

T--- All chocolate malt and warming alcohol in the front. Fruity and vinous like in the middle. It finished with a nice astringent dryness provided by the roasted malt.  M--- Full bodied with a chewy mouth feel.  D--- This was a very well made American imperial stout. It had a very complex malt profile and a big mouth feel that I expect from this style. It has a little too much alcohol to session but it was the perfect winter dessert ale.

287,1444,pmcavena,4.46,"Some friends of mine hyped up this beer quite a bit. I opened the beer with excitement and high expectations, needless to say upon taking the first sip from the lavishly thick and creamy head I was not disappointed.  I continued to sip on the head for a few minutes, enjoying its subtle tastes of dark chocolate, and toffee, mixed with a malty texture.  The beer its self is beautiful, rich, creamy and bold. There is a mild, bitterness however most of the flavors of the beer are very balanced with a nice sweet after taste that leaves you wanting more.  If there was such a thing as a beer latte, this would be a fine example. It's so rich and thick, with so many flavors and subtle textures.  This beer has a hint of peppermint, mixed with a chocolate undertone, that makes for a developed rich taste and it makes this beer a very unique stout. There are also hints of banana, that blend into the mix perfectly. The lacing is beautiful, golden brown rims of delight surround the sides of the pint glass.  About half way through the beer, the lushes head is still present, still as rich and creamy as when I took my first sip. I begin to feel a tingle of warm alcohol, however it is ever so slight, and not over powering. This is a strong beer, but because of its rich and creamy taste, it is extremely drinkable.  The beer is beautiful, its almost completely black, but has a tinge of purple, complimented by a golden brown head thats still present almost to the end.  This is truly a beer that has one down fall, its so delicious that when its gone, I want another. I do have another six pack five feet away from me, but thats another story. If you can find this gem your in for a real treat, Cheers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,greenbeaner,4.28,"Poured into a pint glass, the first thing I noticed about this beer was how thick it was coming out of the bottle, very oily and syrupy. It quickly formed two-fingers of dark caramel head with some retention throughout. The lacing was thick and long lasting patches.  The scent of chocolate and espresso came up front with a mild candy sweetness following close behind. There was also a definite presence of alcohol. Overall however, for as strong as this beer is in every other aspect I felt the smell was a little mild. Not necesarily a bad thing, just not overpowering by any means. Pleasent.  This beer tasted great, coffee and chocolate once again, very mild bitterness in my opinion...there's almost some saltiness to this brew, but I think the sweet and salty maintains a nice balance. Finishes with a fairly warm flavor of alcohol.  I've gotta say this is by far the creamiest beer I've had. It's almost milky and chewy. Not one to just swallow immediately, it really takes some time to get through your mouth, and it leaves your mouth feeling sort of wet and dry at the same time. Very intriguing and enjoyable.  All in all this is an excellent beer that I'd definitely recommend, and I'm sure I'll be drinking it again, but due to the high abv and it's intense flavor and thickness, it's one to watch out for...I could probably only handle a couple of these at a time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,hunteraw,4.02,"Thanks to mymrngjckt for sending this one my way in the Secret Bunny '07 exchange.  Appearance: black as the night, with a seriously dark and seriously big head. Some retention, good lacing.  Smell: Heavy on cocoa, roast (almost burnt - black malt?) and some soysauce. Hops come across as somewhat grassy. This is one you can keep smelling for a while before taking the first taste. Some alcohol.  Taste: Very similar profile to the nose, but I think soy sauce is a bit more pronounced. Caramel notes come out more on the palate, as well. Good finish. Reminds me of a homebrewed stout I made, except better. Solid bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Nice and thick, good carbonation. Sticks to your tongue - after this, an APA would taste like water. I'm surprised at the bros' reviews - the carbonation on mine was fine, must have been a batch issue??

Smell: Some roasted chocolate malts provide the major notes, but coffee, mild dark fruits, sour apple, and piney hops are there as well.  Taste: The roasted chocolate malts drive the flavor here. The coffee and plums intermingle nicely. The sour apples provide a nice mild tartness. The finish is a nice dry hop bitter.  Mouthfeel - Thick and chewy with minimal carbonation.

287,1444,DogFood11,4.29,12oz brown bottle very basic bottle graphics. Poured into a chalice I had to be fairly aggressive to get the most out of it but it does form a loose chocolaty head. Lace is an occasional ring. Jet black body.  My initial reaction was they threw in everything AND the kitchen sink. This is a palate stretcher. Mollasses seems to edge its way out as the champ but followed closely behind with chocolate and huge levels of charred bitterness. Mouthfeel was a drawback as its ultra creamy and far from smooth. More or less it coats the mouth and you have to chew for a while to get it all down. There is a touch of a candied backside but the beer never allows it to develope any presence. This brew is incredibly huge in every way including a rum like alcohol presence.  Notes: Not for the faint of heart. I can see why some would be turned off by this as its alot to take in (or dissect). I thought it was really good but not in the elite category for the style.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,umustdrink,4.83,"I've had this one once before and have always thought it to be the best stout I have ever had, it still is.  Served at slightly more than 50 degrees.  A - I poured this one rather aggressively in my tulip so I got a gigantic head. It was kind of fun to watch the head change forms from a solid looking head with TINY little bubbles to a big rocky formation with a smooth top. Head is deep brown in color and gets darker as it gets closer to the actual beer. Lacing sticks in thick patches.  S - Aroma is of lightly roasted malts, more sweet than bitter chocolate and a creamy milky background. Very slight alcohol vapor like scent just barely detectable.  T - Oh yes...this is it. Slightly bitter up front, quickly leading into a dark toasty malt with a creamy chocolate note, grainy in texture. Warming, comforting alcohol as it goes down. Heaven in a glass.  M - THICK consistency with a nice oilyness allowing for maximum taste retention. Parts of it are noticeably grainy, like unmixed hot cocoa.  D - I've never had Darklord, but to me this is the best stout and one of the best beers allover I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.

287,1444,dogger6253,4.85,"This beer pours out like motor oil, dark and viscous, almost black. The head is a beautiful mocha color that dissipated to a thin ring around the top.  Smells like chocolate, slight alcohol present blended into the licorice. I also noted hints of citrus and a definite roasted-coffee scent. There are other fruity aromas present too, but I have trouble picking them out, raisins/plums perhaps? Also a definite molasses tone in the aroma. The chocolate and fruits come through more as the beer settles.  The taste is dominated by roasted malt and chocolate with hints of coffee or cocoa coming through. Towards the finish, a very slight hint of alcohol balanced by a fruity sweetness, figs and plums.  Very thick in the mouth, but not overly so. This is what my idea of a stout should be; thick and heavy, yet delicious and easy to sip. I would drink this all night. The alcohol definitely affects you so be aware if you're having a few.

287,1444,kdoc8,4.92,"I had this both on tap at the brewery and in a bottle, but reviewed from the bottle purchased at the brewery. I can't believe this is an 11.5% stout. You simply cannot taste the alcohol content at all. It pours a deep dark black color with some hints of red to it. I didn't get too much of a head from either on tap or the bottle. The little there was was dark brown in color. The aromas were so complex. Chocolates and fruits and coffee or mocha roast with just a twinge of alcohol. The taste was similar. Started out with a little bitterness and then erupting into the complexity of the malts. This was the winner of I'm Bored Tonight Stout-Off, pitted against Deschutes Obsidian Stout and Rogue's Imperial Stout. It was a hard choice - they were all amazing, but I found the Bell's Expedition to be the most complex and and exceptional. Way to go Bell's.

287,1444,udubdawg,4.31,"12 oz bottle. From the code I see this was bottled Feb 2006. Let's see how this has evolved over 13 months. Over the last 3 days I've had Old Rasputin, Bourbon County, and now this. I can't very well drink all three of these monsters at once to do a proper comparison, but I'm curious to see how this stacks up anyway.  Pours nearly jet black, and thick, almost syrapy. After seeing no initial carbonation or head I expected I got another of the bottles I've been reading reviews about - ""where is the carbonation?"" - etc. But no...as the pour finished it suddenly formed a huge dark brown frothy head. After a VERY impressive display of reverse cascading this would subside but a quarter inch of it would last to the bottom. Unexpectedly nice lacing too. For those that haven't gotten a head on their pour, let me say that it is beautiful. On appearance, this beer easily defeated the other big stouts I mentioned.  Nose is strong alcohol, with added dark roasted coffee and chocolate. A hint of char on this one. I didn't notice fruitiness at all at first, but as it warmed it was quite strong - raisin and plum especially. Not quite as complex as the Rasputin (or if so it was overshadowed by the alcohol) and not nearly as strong in the nose as the Bourbon County. Not the best, but quite good.  Well this beer hasn't lost it's edge after more than a year. I don't think I'd have liked this one that much fresh. Malty chocolate/sugary plum/coffee flavors. Strong alcohol which is heating up my throat. Some hits of carmelized sugar and char. Nice hoppy/coffee bitterness in the finish. Overall pretty boozy as one would expect from this ABV, but quite good. Not my favorite combination of flavors, but relatively complex, tasty, and warming. If I could, I'd rate this flavor as 4.25. I'll give it another shot one day at 4.5. Nice full mouthfeel with some alcohol burn. Though not heavily carbonated, it is far from missing as many have experienced, and I give thanks for that. Truly a meal in a glass.  I can't conceive of drinking more than one of these. It is huge, relatively complex, with a bitter finish and very warming. Though I won't rate it as highly as the Rasputin or Bourbon County I had the last two days (at least on the BA scale) if I were looking to SIP one beer over the course of an evening in front of the fire, this might be my choice.

Very black, pretty viscous.  S: Smells of roasted malt, dark chocolate, raisins, alcohol, and a licorice or molasses kind of smell that I find a few of Bell's high gravity beers.  T: Very rich, strong flavor. Dried fruit, dark chocolate up front with roasted malt, a hint of coffee and alcohol coming in through the finish. Nice level of sweetness. Very tasty!  M: Nice viscosity, coats your mouth. Very warming alcohol.  D: It's pretty drinkable for an Imperial Stout but you probably wouldn't (or at least shouldn't) want more than one of these.

287,1444,loving44,4.48,"I've been sitting on this one for months waiting for a good time to sample it... it's time!  Pours extremely thick and black... probably the thickest stout I have ever seen. I held my pint glass up to a very bright desk lamp and no light made it's way through at all! Very little head... even after a fairly aggressive pour only a thin caramel colored film of bubbles rose and they vanished quickly. Small whisps of carbonationation can be seen slowly sneaking through the think crude of a beer to the surface.  The nose is full of dark fruits, raisin, plum, fig... also I smell chocolate pudding, black cherry, butterscotch, deep roasted coffee, and slight alcohol. The alcohol is very slight... give no hint to the massiveness of this beer.  Taste: coffee hits me right away with a deep roasted malt character that I don't think I've experienced in many stouts. A very ""heavy"" flavor if that makes any sense.... This is followed by rich chocolate, coco powder, ripe plum, very intence. As the beer warms more alcohol bitterness comes though.  Mouthfeel: This is like drinking tar.... the thickest beer I have ever had in my life. Carbonation is there but the massive body in this beer keeps it in check. It coats your mouth and stays there.... leaving a protective beer barrier that you will enjoy for hours!  Drinkability: I can't see how anyone could survive drinking more than one of these... two at most. The beer hides it's alcohol very well, but it will catch up with you for sure! If you can find this, pick it up. This is a must try for stout lovers!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,quikfish13,4.15,Poured a very thick black with no sign of carbonation in the pour. Suddenly a nice foamy and thick two finger head appeared out of no where threatening to spill over the glass. Smells of roasted malts and dark chocolate were very prominent with a slight hint of coffee and alcohol.  This stout smacks you heavily with alcohol in the after taste with a very dark chocolate and bitter hops flavor in the middle. Virtually no carbonation in the mouthfeel.  Leaves a very heavy taste and sometimes a lttle hard to swallow. Not really a beer I could see having a session with a six pack with. None the less a good beer to drink and savor for the extremely bold flavors.

Mouthfeel is quite good, very full, and well rounded.  Drinkability is good. This has a bit of a boozy feel to it, but it's not overwhelming at all.

Full bodied for sure, but not dense. The flavors are not weighed down by their collective substance, but are on full display to be enjoyed. Delicious and smooth, but huge flavors and high abv limit its drinkability. If a better RIS exists, I haven't had it.

287,1444,rallison,4.66,"Served from a 12oz bottle into a Chimay goblet at cellar temp.  A: Beautiful jet black with a 2 finger brown (yes, this is one dark head too!) head that cascades upon pour (like Guiness from the tap, except that you'll truly look forward to tasting what shows up). Not quite as thick as motor oil, but not all that far off (and I just changed the oil on my car today, so you can trust my comparison!). Head lasts nicely, especially considering the alcohol level.  S: Good roasted coffee, dark chocolate, some more roastiness, and some more chocolate!  T: Amazing. Tons of bitter chocolate and espresso. This is truly one of those beers that will keep you warm on a cold night. Get some fig and prune flavor in there too, with maybe a bit of black licorice. Alcohol is there, but not overpowering - just a nice warming at the end. This is on the extreme end of imperial stouts flavorwise - you better like the roasted, bitter chocolate and coffee flavors - not for the faint of heart indeed! Needless to say, that makes this one of my favorite beers. So, you ask, what can you really call this beer? And I shall answer. It is one delicious, luxuriant journey to chocolate spiked espresso heaven!  M: Exceptionally rich and full mouthfeel. I guess it could get a bit intense after a few, but the mouthfeel is quite enjoyable.  D: All I can say is this: The amazing flavors far outweigh the heaviness of this beer. And considering this is 11.5%, it's pretty drinkable.  Delightful! Exceptionally well crafted, worthy of all the praise it receives. This beer took a special trip to Lone Hill to get, and was worth every penny (well, if I could get this for just pennies...wait, that would prevent me from ever being productive again...).  In a word, extremely highly recommended. Stone makes one amazing RIS, but in my mind, the title (for now) must go to Bell's. Go. Buy.

287,1444,nriech,4.82,"Appearance: Thick, completely black, little bit of med brown head. If there were any bubbles there, they were eaten by the thickness of this brew.  Smell: Dark fruits, heavily roasted malts, a bit of hops and vanilla. Alcohol is present in the smell along with some sweetness. Very nice.  Taste: Shamalamadingdong, this is truly an awesome beer! Dark semi-sweet chocolate mixed with rasins and hop then meld with hops and a nice warming of the palate from the alcohol. Coffee seems to linger later as the warming continues. Almost like one of those fancy coffee cordials, but without all the sugar. Not quite like and RIS I have had before.  Mouthfeel: Very sticky. I could see this being very harsh to the light beer drinkers. Unless you like your beer to hang out and have a party in your mouth for a while, steer away from this one. I liked it though!

Aromas of roasted malt, coffee, alcohol, chocolate, dried dark fruits like plums, raisins, even some prunes. Also caught some fig and date notes.  Tastes are the same as aromas with a big whiskey-ish alcohol taste and chocolate, coffee and dark fruit character.  Creamy and full bodied with a strong alcohol warmth.

As noted by other reviews the aroma is dominated by dark fruit and chocolate, very enticing. Awesome flavor. This brew has everything from sweet chocolate to roasted coffee and everything in between with only a hint of alcohol. It's so rich and smooth.

287,1444,jmalex,4.57,"Part 2 of 2 of Bell's stout tasting session for me tonight. While the first was a sweet stout (Kalamazoo), this one is quite the change up. Either way though, tonight is a good beer night for me.  APPEARANCE: Pours a thick, chunky, motor oil black with a small but sturdy latte brown head. It falls to a hearty collar with a thin layer of bubbles.  SMELL: A fantastic balance of roasted malts, dark fruits, floral hops, and even a hint of winter spice. This is really, really nice. The various aromas work so well in balance with each other. The smells are strong and let you know you're about to drink one hell of a beer, but they don't overwhelm to the point of being offensive. Simply wonderful.  TASTE: Good lord, this one packs a punch. This beer comes out with fists a-flying, and the intensity of this is something to behold. It starts out with a full malt flavor (chocolate, roasty) and hits your taste buds with a hop bitterness to match. Flavors of sweet licorice and then coffee start to come on. The finish is bitter and roasted with strong indications of black malt and burnt coffee. Every imaginable RIS flavor can be found in this beer, and with great balance. Alcohol is detectable, but certainly not 11.5% worth.  MOUTHFEEL: This is the other striking thing about the initial taste. The thickness of this beer just assaults your mouth, forcing you to savor every last drop. Full-bodied would be a gross understatement. Now that's what I'm looking for in a RIS!  DRINKABILITY: Sadly, this beer is so hard hitting that it'll take some time to get through. And it's got to be one and done... at least for me. But that doesn't mean my one is a chore. Far from it. I will enjoy and savor this one for as long as I need to.  Bell's continues to impress. This is exactly what I think of when I want a heavy hitting Russian Imperial Stout. It simply has it all. It may suffer from being so hard hitting, but that just means I'm getting my money's worth.

287,1444,northernbrews,4.43,"12oz bottle purchased from Champane's in Warren MI.  Batch 7740...bottled on December 19, 2006...we'll see how this is this young.  Appearance: This looks absolutely beautiful in my Bell's tulip. I wish the glass was a little bigger. I guess I should have picked up the Expedition Stout snifter I saw on Bell's website a few years ago...This pours like some thick ass motor oil...a khaki two-finger head tops this beauty.This fads to about a half inch leaving a wonderful trail of lace.  Smell: This initially has some dark chocolate with dark fruit notes...followed by roasted malts and a nice hop bite...perhaps a little bit of orange, cherries and pine in the finish.  Taste: Starts off with the creamy head and some roasty malt...this also has a bit of dark chocolate and quite a bit of hops....the hops have some orange and pine notes with a slight alcohol tingle near the finish  Mouthfeel: Nice thick creamy mouthfeel. The hops, chocolate, and roasted malts hang on the roof and back of my mouth for the duration of the party...  Drinkability: This goes down smoothly for being 11.5% or so....I could sip on a few of these throughout the night...or just enjoy one as a nitecap...You will definitely feel pretty good after a few of these.  Overall: This is the best stout from the BEST stout brewery in the world IMO (the only one I've had that is better is the one-time Batch 7000). There might be a few stouts that are stonger and better, but for the price and quality, you can get a six-pack of this for the price of a 22oz bomber of something on par. Another world-class beer from the wonderful Bell's Brewery.  I'm glad I picked up a 12 pack of this, and I might have to pick another 12 pack of this to cellar.

Pours black with a mocha head that is about an inch and a half and never goes away. There is plenty of lacing ""caked"" to the side of the glass. This is what a beer should look like. The smell is not up to par with the bottled version. Hard to pick out a lot of anything in the nose besides loads of roasted malt. Taste is the most surprising of all. This is hot! The alcohol is so present in this beer that I was taken back by it. An immediate warming sensation engulfs my mouth/nose. Lots of roasted malt and cocoa are present in the taste. But for the most part the taste is dominated by this hot, alcohol taste. It lacks the complexity of the bottled version. Mouthfeel is incredible. It's an alcoholic chocolate malt. Thick, creamy, smooth. The mouthfeel adds to the drinkability. It makes it very easy to get through. A little too easy. Expedition never ceases to please. A truly world class beer and one of my favorites.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mmmbeer,4.87,"12 oz. bottle, batch 7740 - packaged 12/19/06. This fresh, young, yet immense imperial stout pours into my chalice a viscous inky black, and is topped with a thin, dark cappucino head that reduces to a collar. After an hour there is no head, but swirling the beer seems to revive it some. The bouquet is strong and aromatic, yet soft, consisting of roasted, coffee, and chocolate malts, licorice, raisins, plums?, green hops, and hints of red and green apples. Although the aroma is big, it still doesn't prepare you for the amount of flavor and body that this beer throws at you. It tastes of strong, black coffee, bitter charred/roasted malts, tobacco, anise, dark chocolate, leather, green/piney hops, port wine, green apple?, caramel?, and just a touch of alcohol - massive and incredibly tasty. The body is full, coating, drying, and silky smooth, with low/medium carbonation, and a long, roasted/coffee finish. This is an awesome, huge stout that demands respect; consuming it is a truly memorable beer experience that just makes you crave more. I can only imagine how it would improve with age. Mmmm...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,DGryger,4.08,"Appearance: Black. Opaque black. Seriously, I poured this into a pint glass, held it up to the light and there was not light transmittance through the body. Very impressive. Poured with about a 0.75 viscous coffee/caramel colored head. Would have liked to see more lacing and retention.  Smell: Heavy scent of raisins and dried fruits with a malty cocoa scent. Smells sweet.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate and toffee with dried fruit hints, mostly raisin with a little bit of prune. No hop taste detected, but plenty of malt at first but a bit of hoppy bitterness become noticeable as the beer warms.. The perceived imbalance is acceptable because at least malts wont destroy your tongue. Although as the beer warms the alcohol starts to overpower the other tastes.  Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy with a very suitable amount of carbonation. This is a very creamy brew. I wouldnt consider this a very dry beer, and that is refreshing. Alcohol warming in the finish at first and moves forward with increasing temperature.  Drinkability: For the style I would consider it very drinkable given its sweet smoothness and overall tastiness. However halfway through a bottle the alcohol will start to catch up with you. A little too much alcohol in the beer and I think I could only drink one of these at a time. This is a great beer for a nightcap thought.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bort11,4.35,"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Mild tan head that recedes to a thin ring. Color is pure black, no light can penetrate the glass. Smell is a roasted espresso. Very bold, I can smell it without putting my nose in the glass. Taste follows smell. Very bold espresso flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a little more carbonation than what I would expect. Very good RIS, and I would love to have more",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,dedrinker,3.9,"Mmm. Used motor oil. Chocolate with booze filling. Brazil nuts dusted in cocoa powder. Monstrous, full bodied, lingering, viscous. If your stomach experiences high viscosity break-down, then a bottle of this ought to lube your chassis. If you don't try it fresh enough (as I did my first time) it might just seem dense, heavy, oily - a lot of malty heft without much complexity or depth, but this time around I got in peak condidtion and the layers revealed themselves.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ClockworkOrange,4.23,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a shaker glass. Appears an opaque black with two fingers of dark tan creamy head. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee. Tastes of fresh roasted espresso beans, and sharp hops. Very rich and full bodied. The hop bite lingers in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Delicious and satisfying. Highly recommended. Cheers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,treedoctor5002,4.77,"First of all this is by far the thickest and darkest beer I've ever had. Pours more like a quart of used motor oil than a beer and has a thin dark tan head to it. At first it's like drinking liquid dark chocolate. I detected some maple, molasses, rum raison and coffee flavors. Finish is full of roasted malt flavors. I could only sip this beer at first but as it warmed up it got smoother and smoother. Kind of odd in a way. You really have to let this one warm up to get the full effect. Slightly high on the alcohol level so I had to mark it down just a notch for drinkability. Not for the faint of heart! The most complex stout I've ever tried. If your buddy says he's a beer guy, test him with this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Jessefive,3.88,"My first Bells, and my first Imperial Stout. As I expected, the color was the darkest black. A creamy thick body. The flavor was dark chocolate with a soft fruity sweetness hidden in there. There was a little roasted malt flavor, but it wasn't nearly as prominent as I would have imagined. It had a bitter finish. As it warmed a bit, the bitterness of the alcohol and hops became more prominent. Overall, a very tasty and interesting beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Dubbercody,4.2,"Batch 7205  Thick and dark and viscous in that freaking awesome imperial way. Good warming, a bit of a ABV burn that I would foresee mellowing out with a bit more age on it. I would love to try a few year old bottle of this.  I have to say I love this style of beer, gotta enjoy it when you can, cause I won't be cold forever...damn global warming.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,asabreed,3.9,"12 oz. bottle into a Thomas Hardy's snifter.  Appearance: With the ABV and the style you know the darkness will be present, and surely it is. Wish there was more lacing and more retention, but still, this sucker lives up mostly to its wishes of pure oblivion.  Smell: I've been drinking this for a long time in the snifter, and I wanted to wait until it warmed to close to room temperature say some words. The initial aroma's all chalky burnt and roasted malts with some sourness, along with some bitter chocolate, and of course as I said previously, any malt character is heavily roasted and charcoaled to the ends of the earth. Still a good thing, but I think with the high ABV, that's the thing that's possibly bringing it to a lower level.  Taste: What's dominating here is the sourness, the burnt malt, the roasted chocolate, and the slight citrus from the hops. Lots of complexity without a lot of balance and depth, or at least as much as I had hoped for. Granted, this is still young, and yes, its tasty and warming, but I feel like the aging process may have to be a part of this brew for it to do good things in the future.  Mouthfeel: Thick yet almost powdery, which somehow works for this. More carbonation could make it worse, yet it could do some great things for it.  Drinkability: I'd liken this to Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout or possible Thirsty Dog's Siberian Night, but what's missing here is the visceral, creamy, heady, and ultimately thick and malty delicious nature of those brews. I was a bit taken aback with the hype of this brew, and now that makes sense, as I don't personally think the ratings are giving it the experience I'd hoped. Still, I enjoyed it, and I can certainly see years bringing good things to this. Not sure I'd spring for a sixer in its green nature, but the one bottle I purchased certainly was anything but a bad decision.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,russpowell,4.66,"Props to zrrbrrt for this one.  Pours a deep mahogany with a rocky 2 fingers deep dirt/mocha colored head. Great lacing ( small dark flecks are glued to the glass almost like tiny grains of glass or obsidian) & very good head retention  S: Rich chocolate, plums & toast  T: Huge roasted malt & bitter chocolate up front. Iron, burnt coffee dark choclate follow as this warms up. This made me think of a choclate malted milk with booze pulsing through its body. Finishes with a flourish of choclate, hint of booze, a kiss of iron & roasted grain bitterness.  MF: Rich & chewy, makes me thik Christmas pudding! Very low carbonation.  The chewyness kind of detracts form the drinkability, but a lovely fireside sipper that demands respect & adoration. A great Russian IMP stout",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,beermanbrian,4.52,"Oil black in color with a a thin tan head that foams up to only 1/4 inch with a heavy pour. The head is the foamy fine bubbled consistancy and has a slightly reddish tint to it. Smell hits you with a huge wash of flavors. Dark fruits are the most prominant followed by coffee, chocolate and the other typical stout flavors. Also, as it warms you get a real wiff of the high ABV. The taste is just as enjoyable as the smell. I think beer might have the most prominant dark fruit flavors of any stout i've ever tasted. Finishes with some nice bitterness and some alchohol burn. Overall a wonderful beer. Hurt a little on drinkability due to the high ABV. I couldn't see having more than 2 in a night and really 1 is just about perfect.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,oakbluff,4.25,"I thought this beverage would be appropriate considering it is -35 degrees celsius out tonight.  Pours out like ten month old motor oil from my car. I had to run upstairs to get the knife and fork for this baby. Wow that is a thick stout. Hops are quite pronounced even though there is obviously an avalanche of malt here. Chocolate, plum, raisins, hops are main tastes. As thick as it is at the beginning, it actually finishes lightly and dry. carbonation is medium to low, but is at an appropriate level for this style.  A slow sipper for sure, but a perfect match for a soul sucking cold ass night. I'm looking forward to aging a couple of these to see how it/if it mellows out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Atlas1,3.99,"Poured from the bottle into a generic pint glass. This beer is deep pitch black. I hold it up to the light and nothing gets through. A seriously dark stout. Very nice. Pours a fat, heavy two-finger head which is a burnt orange color. It is thick and sticky, and cakes along the side of the glass as the beer recedes, leaving a very nice lace. It's strange, but I just don't get much out of the aroma here. I would have expected more, but the aroma is thin, with some slight coffee notes and hints of hoppiness. But otherwise, there's just not much in the way of aroma here. However, what it lacks in smell is made up for in flavor. This beer is delicious. Creamy, dark chocolate sweetnees mixed with a bitter coffee taste. It is nutty as well. Finishes with a noticeable amount of heat; you can really taste the alcohol in the aftertaste. Still, it's not a huge distraction, but it's just too hard to hide all of that 11.5% ABV. A wonderful winter brew, this stout will definitely keep you warm on a cold February night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,oelergud,4.53,"Completely opaque black body with a silken brown head. Great lace and good retention. Strong sweet malts, roasted burnt expresso beans. Vanilla and powerful nutskin bitterness. Taste has all the elements of the smell but expands into a rough smoked hop experience mingled with bitter roasted chocolate beans and expresso. Almond bitter aftertaste and smoke undulating along hoppy notes. Full thick body, lots of residual sugars and decent coating. Very high drinkability but watch the abv, it'll kick your ass.  -Oelergud",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,dfried,4.38,"Black as night, thick and oily, dark tan head like creme brule almost. The aroma was of rich molasses, black licorice, chocolate and coco powder, and some tropical fruity notes. Some alcohol lingered but I wont knock you off your seat. A lot of coco powder in the taste as well, fruity flavors, pears, a lot of black cherry. Quite sweet and tart. Some black licorice and coffee in the background. Very rich and creamy mouthfeel, silky.  Verdict: one of the better RISs out there in my opinion. The flavors come together very well, and while it is a sipping beer, it is easy to get lost, look down, and see that it is gone and want another.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,crwills,4.54,"The highlight of a pre-Christmas trade with CBA out in Alberta; thanks Chris, this was awesome!  Poured an opaque, jet black into my Sinha glass. A slightly pinkish, relatively small chocolate-milk head fades fast but leaves a ton of brown lacing.  Aroma is very dark and planty. Licorice and anise, damp roots, milk chocolate, and good Caribbean rum. Just fantastic.  Taste was very bitter (moreso than I expected). Damp earth and plants right up front, which evolved into dry coffee or espresso and cocoa beans in the middle. Some warming alcohol and toffee as well. Finish is oaky vanilla, with a little bit of those grapefruit/pine citrus hops coming through in the aftertaste. Complex as hell, all the way through.  Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and milk- or cream-like, with almost no carbonation. Only dropped marks for drinkability due to the ABV and the fact that I couldn't finish more than one.  One of my top beers of all time.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bitterbill,4.7,"Pours from 12oz bottle a pitch black with a medium sized head of foam that shrinks rather quickly leaving just a fine ring around the edge of the glass.  The smell is very strong but nice. There's oodles of roasted and sweet malt on the nose and also some fruitiness.  The taste is also hugely malty. Lots of roastiness and sweet caramel malt along with chocolate and hot cocoa that adds some nice bitterness that creates one heck of a complex and pleasing experience to my palate. Wow is this ever a great sipping Imperial Stout! I did have a couple bottles of it a few years back but I think I'm enjoying it more now because of my ""evolved"" appreciation of quality microbrews.  I'm about halfway through now and though the abv is pretty darned high, I'm not getting any of it in the taste, just some warming as it goes down. What a great brew to have on this very cold Casper winter evening...  Bottom line: A *superb* full bodied, full flavoured Imperial Stout that borders on perfection. I can't recommend this one enough!  Thanks to ColoradoBobs for allowing me to try this beauty again!!!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,arguemaniac,4.03,"Pours a viscous, opaque black with a long-lasting, creamy brown head. Chocolately, roasted aroma. Big chocolate and bitter coffee in the rich, burnt palate. Dark fruit and a fairly intense malt sweetness make their way through as well. Intense coffee and burnt grain in the robust finish.  Ive heard good things about this one and I would say it lives up to the hype. Its rich and complex with a nice balance between the rich malt sweetness and bitter, burnt flavors. Highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,beerphan,4.25,"12oz bottle batch# 7740 packaged 12/19/2006 according to http://www.bellsbeer.com/  Pours black with a full 2inch dark tan head that calmly settles to a thick blanket, then a small film. Lacing is minimal.  Nose: Roasted chocolate malts, some mild dark fruit, a tad bit of sour apple, and some piney hops. Alcohol becomes present with some time.  Taste: Roasted dark malts gives chocolate, plum, and coffee. Finishes with a stiff drying bitterness that balances the complex roasted flavors well. Flavors seem a little more sharp, than the mellow balance i got from the tap this afternoon at Vintage Beer and Wine in Boardman, OH.  Mouth is thick and chewy.  An imperial stout that could be sipped delicately during long winter sessions.

287,1444,techdiver,4.7,"Pours a dense black with a modest head that dissipates quickly.  Chocolate, coffee, and anise to the nose.  Taste of coffee and roasted malt. So smooth and decadent, with a hint of alcohol in the finish.  Coats the mouth as one of the densest brews I've tried. The taste just lingers.  Quite drinkable concidering the ABV, which is really well hidden.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Chaz,4.77,"Served in a logoed Bell's tulip. Looks black as pitch! Head is dark tan / mahoganny, about half a finger with very good duration and excellent lacing, and served in this glassware it looks better than ever! Nose is everything I've come to expect in this brew, a near perfect blend of espresso, roasted and dark malts, and yeast. I let the glass warm a bit out of custom, but on first sip it is tangy, bittersweet, and roasty all at once. The lingering bitterness and roasted malt / espresso notes really stick in yer craw. Rather full mouthfeel and rather complex, with broad strokes of green apple, licorice, and molasses. Boozy? Yes and no: there's no arguing with 11.5%, but it's so well hidden here that it would be somewhat easy to drink this all night, and more than one of these in a sitting can be downright dangerous! As it warms the notes of bitter chocolate and light, dusty cocoa emerge and begin a nuanced and masterful interplay with the bigger, broader flavors mentioned above. Hop use is just about perfect: this isn't a style or a rendition that will suit everyone, but Bell's have thankfully resisted the 'bigger is better' approach to bittering hops that resulted in the Imperial IPA style. Carbonation is great here, and apart from one rather infamous batch has always been so. Full-bodied but not heavy, and warming rather than hot. Well balanced but not-quite sessionable . . . this is the epitome of a sipping beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S- molasses and brown sugar with hints of cocoa and mocha.  T- this is very complex. It is strong, full and over the top in a good way. I taste everything that I smell and this beer engulfs the full flavor palate. One of the best stouts I have been honored to have.  M- really does feel thick and syrup like. not carbonated nor fizzy.  D- man, I can only hope to sample this beer again.

287,1444,Tyrawlings,4.47,2005 Edition: 12oz. Bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Brew pours like black sludge. Very little if any cinnamon brown head. Virtually no lacing.  S: Smells of roasted coffee. Dark chocolate. Sweet molasses and earth. Oak barrel and alcohol.  T: Rich roasted coffee is followed by dark bitter cocoa. Dark fruit and sweet molasses meld together well with burnt malts. The beer finishes a smooth bourbon oak barrel flavor and warming alcohol with vanilla undertones.  M: Extremely thick. Creamy and chewy. No carbination and very dry due to the alcohol bite.  D: A magical elixir! The perfect brew to warm the soul on the most bitter cold winter evenings. A special treat that is to be sipped and savored over time. I highly recommend aging this beer for at least one year before trying.

287,1444,BeerHonky,4.55,"I purchased a case about a year ago from the Beer Yard in Wayne, PA. I realized right away that this is a beer that you have to let age. I drank a few fresh, but the flavors were all competing and too strong. After a year of aging, I have to say this beer is unbelievbale. It pours thick and black and totally opaque. Two finger's worth of super thick, fluffy tan colored head. The beer smells of dark roasty malt, lots and lots of roasty flavors appear to be on the way. There is also some hints of figs and raisins soaked in alcohol. The aroma leaves to mystery as to how this tastes. There are good hints of chocolate and coffee amongst all the roasty malt and dark fruit flavors. The mouthfeel on the aged beer is significantly different than when fresh. Its much creamier and smoother now. My only problem with this beer is that its a tad sticky, sweet. But thats something that is part of this style of beer. The drinkability is a tad difficult because its sweet and high in alcohol. This is just a great beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,OStrungT,5,"This beer pours an oily black color. It boasts a thick, creamy brown head that fades slowly, leaving a massive lacing that coats the entire glass. This beer is so thick, it looks like tar.  This beer has so many aromas that it is hard to describe it all. I smell figs, and raisins. Also some chocolate covered cherries. Some chocolate and coffee are also present. It has some licorice aroma also. Molasses and caramel are also present. The beer smells very sweet.  As with the aroma, this beer has a multitude of flavors. Dark fruits mostly. It has a bittersweet chocolate flavor. The caramel sweet malt flavor is quite nice. The alcohol content is well hidden in the flavor. A slight coffee flavor is also present.  This beer is very full bodied. It goes down smooth, but very thick, leaving a sweet malty aftertaste. This beer is very aggressive. It is low in carbonation, adding to the style.  This beer is not a session beer. It is very aggressive, and with the high alcohol content, it might prove to be hard to put down many. However, just one is easy to put down.  Overall: Wow. Thank you Himerman for this trade. I think this is one of the best beers I have ever had. I owe you one man. Cheers",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bluejacket74,4.43,"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very, very dark brown with a thick brown head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. It smells like chocolate, molasses, coffee, dark fruit and a bit of alcohol. It tastes mostly bitter with a bit of sweetness, like coffee, plums and/or figs, semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malt. The alcohol warming in the taste is noticeable, but it's not too much. Mouthfeel is full, smooth and creamy. The drinkability is good, but I don't think I'd want any more than 2 at a time.

Its about all you could ask for in an RIS. Aroma is broad, intoxicating, rich, sexy, lots of chocolate and espresso and all other things stouty, hinting on caramel toffee and the alcohol comes through just a smidge harsh.  This is a delicious beer. It starts off immense, loads of sweet chocolate and caramel and toffee and roasted malts, some fruits take a brief stab in the middle, plum perhaps, which give way to a slight earthy herbal hop that spurts through the sweetly onslought, just as its washed down the hatch. Defines 'rich', is intoxicating in both flavor and abv. Very warm in the mouth, silky smooth and thick, kept alive by slight carbonation. The finish just lingers, pitches a tent, it stays.

287,1444,neenerzig,4.25,"This beer is a very dark brown/black color that lets in no light whatsoever. has a fairly good foamy, tan head. Pretty decent lacing as well. Aromas of roasted malt and coffee with maybe a hint of caramel or chocolate are present. Bitter flavors of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and malt are prsent upfront followed by a sort of slight sweetness that I can only describe as tasting like a steak with A1 sauce on it. Very interesting taste indeed as I have never had a beer that tasted quite like this before. I certainly enjoyed it. Has a thick, creamy, and crisp mouthfeel with light to moderate carbonation. It becomes more and more drinkable as it warms. This is an ass kicking beer!  Eric",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,rayjay,4.45,"Batch 6811, which I believe dates it to 4/05, according to the interweb. Via trade with northernbrews.  Rich, thick, black, viscous sludge.  Rich 99% cacoa dark chocolate, licorice liqour, and heavily carmelized maple syrup. Soft, settled, and thick from sitting in the bottle; lacks much carbonation, but it's got plently of spunk with the rich flavor notes. Maybe the thickest beer I've had yet, behind Sam Adams Tripel Bock. Highly recommended for big beer fans.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,emerge077,4.33,"Pours a deep brownish-black, not quite opaque. Two fingers of tan latte foam rise and settle. Above the rim, the surface could pass for a chocolate chip cookie.  Aroma of roasted malt, vague sweetness, with a possible lactic note. Not especially bold, but complimentary to the huge flavor.  Rich taste, notes of smoky malt, bitter chocolate, and creamy coffee. Residual hop bitterness. Very powerful and bold flavors, the alcohol isn't overwhelming, but it packs a punch.  Mouthfeel is intensely smooth and velvety, creamy and luscious. Lactic milk sugar contributes a boatload of palate-smudging heft.  Although it's not one for sessioning, it has a sublime quality that makes you savor every sip. Every so often I crave an Expedition, so it has a year-round place in the cellar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Risser09,4.6,"12 oz. Bottle  Appearance: Dark black liquid pours thick and viscous. Looks like a thick espresso. Head is about 1 finger thick and subsides quickly. Brown head.  Smell: Burnt barley and coffee. I would say that there is some smoke in there somewhere.  Taste: Wow. Did I just take a huge bite of dark chocolate? This beer is thick enough to be chewed indeed. Burnt flavors of dark chocolate, barley malt, and espresso. Molasses sweetness hits in the midtones. Coffee-like finish that is dry. I don't sense the 11.5% alcohol at all. Very well masked.  Mouthfeel: Thick, viscous and delicious. Easy to swallow as there is not very much carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer would be best consumed as a dessert in itself. It has the body to fill your stomach and complete a meal. At 11.5% alcohol it will bring on a buzz even after a meal. This is definitely not a session beer. Enjoy it slowly and thoroughly.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,beveritt,4.6,"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a snifter. The label is the standard Bell's style, with a compass rose. The batch number (7251) indicates that this was bottled on February 25. 2006. Gotta love that batch lookup on Bell's website.  Appearance: Pours a thick, viscous black, with almost no head. A millimeter thick layer of dark brown foam that quickly settles into just a few bubbles. The beer is completely opaque.  Smell: Alcohol sweetness backs a roasted barley aroma with strong hints of licorice and raisins.  Taste: Thick and caramelly sweet, alcohol is present, but blends well. Mouthfilling flavors of fum-raisin cake and malty sweetness. Slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Low level of carbonation, incredible body.  Drinkability: A great nightcap drink, but certainly not a session beer. Spend the time to enjoy this one.  Update: Sampled a bottle from this six pack last night, 12/28/08. This makes it two years in the cellar and 3 months shy of 3 years since production. Sampled against a fresh bottle. The aging helped to mixed some of the incongruous flavors together, and made an all out great beer. This is going to become a cellar staple for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,MDekker,4.67,"I've long avoided this brew, due to its price only, but I finally succumbed and bought one...and I'm glad I did.  It pours out black as night, with a little bit of creamy brown head. It dissipates rather quickly but reappears a bit after every swig. The aroma is rich, filled with caramel, chocolate, roasted coffee, doughy yeast, and a little alcohol. Really interesting. The flavor follows a similar line - starting with the chocolatey roasted malts and finishing nicely with a dark bitter taste. A hearty one, this is. In the mouth it's great, too - creamy, with smooth carbonation. Finally, the richness and the alcohol might stop one from downing multiple mugs of this, but overall it's a great brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,vwcraig,4.15,"Poured black into a goblet. Camel colored head. Pruney and chocolatey smell that really sticks in the nose. Very appetizing smells. Caramelly, roasted malts jump out. Initial tastes were of hot cocoa and even a dark fruitiness switching into a bitter hop profile and some burnt malt flavors. Bitterness is felt throughout the mouth even on the roof. Heavy and slick mouthfeel barely any carbonation. Leaves a thick ring of lacing behind and clings to the glass. Booze level becomes more revealed as it warms up. Excellent for the last stout of the night.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SacoDeToro,4.15,"Poured blacker and thicker than Saudi Arabian crude with a small brown head. This may be the most viscous beer I've poured.  The aroma was of rich roasted malts, chocolate, some hops, and herbal notes.  The flavor of the beer was richly roasty without being harsh or ashen. The malts cascaded through a variety of flavors. There were notes of dried fruits, herbs, and licorice. The hops were well balanced and weren't too powerful.  The mouthfeel was thick and creamy. The carbonation was spot on. The drinkability was good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BMoney575,4.72,"Sampled on 12-11-06 Batch: 7251 Bottled: 2-25-06  Looked fantastic pouring out of the bottle, thick and pitch black, with a good amount of carbonation to create a one-inch head that went away decently quickly.  The smell hits you as soon as the cap comes off. Dark fruits, raisin, plum, are very apparent, a malty sweetness and a good amount of smokiness make it even better.  Taste is unbelievable. Same fruit flavor up front, with the sweet malt balanced by a perfect amount of hoppiness. The finish is smoky and stays around for awhile. No noticeable alcohol taste, which shows how very balanced this beer is.  The mouthfeel is great, thick and creamy.  Drinkability is very good, it would not be hard to finish two or three of these.  Overall my favorite example of an RIS, and maybe one of the best beers I've ever had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,plaid75,3.7,Poured an oily black hue with a one finger dark tan creamy head. There was decent retention and good sticky lacing.  The smell featured a rich coffee and caramel aroma with hints of dried fruit.  The taste consisted of nice caramel and chocolate malts with elements of raisin and coffee. There was a significant warming alcoholand a bit of an uncomfortable sweetness.  The mouthfeel was full and chewy.  Overall a tasty RIS.

287,1444,tjthresh,4.78,"Friggin outstanding in almost everyway. Mocha, molasses, burnt sugar, with a touch of alcohol in the nose. Loads of bitter chocolate, a certain grittyness to it. Very mouth filling. Long finish. Onyx black. I sure would like to see some sort of head on this bear though. Tastes great, and fills me up just fine",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Melchizedek,4.52,"Oh goodness. Black, black, black - pours like motor oil, builds a solid brown head, and sucks light out of its surroundings.  Aroma is BOLD, full of powdered chocolate, a touch of hop, alcohol, caramel, spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove maybe?), dark fruit, bread... in the mouth, rich, full, creamy, with intense roasted, toasted grains pushing aggressively to the fore. Survive the onslaught and you can start to catch the flavors of the aroma, especially the caramel/chocolate, while alcohol makes itself known and warms things up. A bit of sweetness moderates the bitter and almost harsh flavor profile (alcohol helps with this). Some nutty and maybe yeasty notes round out the finish.  I can't say much bad about this beer, except that you don't want to try to taste anything afterwards. I'm in love. I wish I could get this locally - I'd certainly try cellaring it if I had the means, as I think the mellowing effects of a bit of aging would enhance the subtler notes that are for now a bit hard to pick out from the flavor onslaught.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,EvilKeith,4.52,"Expedition Stout poured thick and utterly black in color. Light does not pass through this one. It may actually bend light like a black hole, for all I know. The head was creamy and camel in color. The glass was coated with a heavy sheet of thick and sticky lace. It was a real treat for the eyes. The bouquet was incredible! There was everything you could ask from a Russian Imperial Stout. There was rich dark chocolate notes, dark roasted coffee beans, hints of prune, a deeply roasted character with subtle traces of hardwood smoke and a light grassiness from the hops. The taste was pretty much dead on with the scent with the dark chocolate coming across more as bitter sweet cocoa. The hops added a pleasant light bitterness and exquisite balancing. The alcohol makes it self known, spicy and a warming on the swallow. The body was full with a fine tight carbonation and the mouthfeel was Oh So creamy!  I do not often give out 5s in my reviews. The bouquet left me little choice, the smell was truly exceptional. If the alcohol had been a touch less overt my numbers for taste and drinkability would have been a little higher.  A year or two of cellaring might make this my first 5 across the board. I will have to revisit this one and re-review in a year. I hope I can wait that long.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,IntriqKen,4.68,"Feloniousmonk said, ""this pours dark as sin"". Yep...the poet writes and the blind man sees. Pours motor oil black but not as thick with a tan half finger that melts to a ring of sticky lacing. Aromas are coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of dark raisins. Taste is far more complex. Dark fruits...mostly dark raisins and prunes,....coffee...not quite espresso but very, very dark and rich...bittersweet chocolate...a touch of vanilla....then you swallow and it's all alcohol warmth without the nasty taste going down. Aftertaste is chocolate covered raisins with a touch of bitter hops drying your mouth. Someone PLEASE get the brothers another bottle or two to taste and hopefully enjoy this time.

287,1444,JohnnyM2002,4.26,"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at exactly 52 degrees.  A - Beautiful milk chocolate head sits atop a black-licorice body. Extremely thick pour that led to the creamy head almost escaping my snifter. Wonderful colors.  S - Sweet and fruity dark chocolate wallops the nose. A side of smoke on the side...  T - A lot of flavors working very well together. Immediately, the smoked aspect comes out in the taste as it blends very well with burnt chocolate and toffee. At first, the alcohol didn't really make itself known, but it could only hide for so long. Joining the alcohol sensation is a combination of dry and sweet fruits.  M - Very thick, but goes down very easily. The complex flavors make for a little tough finish - by that I mean you don't really know what to think. I smelled one thing, tasted another at first, then got a completely different flavor on the way down. This isn't a bad thing though - the beer is very well put together by all means.  D - I'm very glad I was finally able to get my hands on a few of these, but I can honestly say it was worth the wait. Instantly became one of my favorites from Bell's.

287,1444,Vancer,4.19,"Well, here we go: what a start  pours like used motor oil, black as nite, yum! Just a thin ring of tan lace around the edge of my paper cup. This brew has a viscosity level not normally seen!  TONS of chocolate malt, coffee, anise, plums, raisons  a fruit blender of aromas. Bold coffee, burnt charcoal/toast start in the quaff, but a bit too sugary sweet in the finish. Also pops with an alcohol medicine finish.  Dry, powdery and gritty brew, full bodied rich and thick. Just too darn syrupy for a real long drinker. It really needed more hops to balance this bad boy out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,doppelmeup,3.96,"Many thanks to shbobdb for this fine brew.  Pours like thick motor oil into a wine glass. (That's all I have, as I'm reviewing this from a hotel room). Daark cocoa head slowly builds, but doesn't remain for long. Black as night. One of the darkest beers I've ever seen. Winey legs slowly slide down the glass, with specks of foam dotting the outside of the glass.  Not a real strong smelling RIS. Definite roasted malts, slightly sweet. Slightly musty. Maybe some chicory?  Taste is strong on dark roasted coffee. Quite a bit of hop bitterness, and the alcohol is quite well hidden. Roasted malts prevail.  Definite bitter aftertaste, which sticks around just long enough to make sure know you've had really big beer. Chewy mouthfeel, with a surprisingly clean finish.  Overall, this is a really big, really solid RIS. It would be hard to drink more than one at a time, but IMO this rivals, if not surpasses, Stone RIS and the other big stouts for the top of the list.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Licorice, cherry, liquor, sherry, prunes, dates, cream, and a hint of chocolate. Breathing out trhough the nose, , you can feel a slight alcoholic burn. There is some chocolate bitterness, also.  Mouthful is certainly thick and syrupy. Oily and slick.  Drinkability could be a pain for some. High alcoholic content, sweetness, and thickness.  I really enjoyed this beer. A little sweet for me, but very enjoyable. I'm quite surprised by some of the reviews stating this beer's high ABV being a turnoff, yet enjoying certain Quads that I found higher in alcoholic flavor. I'm guessing that what the real deal here is that they enjoyed the flavor of those beers more, and I enjoy this beer's combination of flavors instead. What gets you through a big beer?

Thanks to BA, I learned a bit about being able to let beers sit for awhile. Otherwise this beer might not have been truly appreciated.  This pours like motor oil with a nice tan head about an inch or so thick. The head disappeared within minutes, leaving a thin ring around the glass that left some lacing with each sip. Burnt, roasted, and alcohol aromas hit the nose equally. Espresso-like flavor balanced with a touch of alcohol that warms the soul on a chilly evening.

Poured with minimal rich caramel head, not too high. Has the sweet smell of burnt caramel. It tastes delicious with a hint of sweetness and has a thick, dry mouthfeel that lasts a while. It is rather expensive, but I don't regret having spent the money.

At the time, I had enough beers in me that I didn't respect it. Silky black motor oil, without an aggresive head.I let it sit and witnessed a very lovely tannish three finger head grow like a chia-pet. Monster burnt chocolate espresso flavor that goes lovely with my braised chicken dinner. The smell is inviting, and the taste completely delivers. Alcohol is masked nicely, but I'm warmed on the first snow of the season quite pleasantly. I appreciate the silky smooth deliverance of a uniquely bold drink that finishes almost dry.

287,1444,MuenchenerKindl,4.72,"The pour alone supports the hype on this brew. This was poured from a 12 oz bottle to a pint glass and acquired from Shbobdb via trade. The liquid is a thick syrup like opaque black that sticks to the sides of the glass. The head in a finger or two depending on the pour, it is also dark chocolate colored and quite sudsy.  The smell is burnt coffee, dark and robust. A slight sweet tone to the malt and light alcohol lifting through.  The taste is of burnt toast and extra dark concentrated espresso. As it warms alcohol, chocolate and fruit flavors are released. By far this beer is best served warmer then cooler. I would say it is near perfect at 60+ deg. The mouthfeel is full, thick, coating and penetrating, the carbonation is good, nothing out of order here.  Drinkability is top notch, this is by far a leeding example of the style.

Foam settles immediately to a ring of dirty lacing and pockets of bubbles in the center of the glass. Huge punches of chocolatey roasted malts and alcohol. Taste, well I took a bite and chewed on itlike an alcohol soaked piece of dark chocolate cake with molasses icing. It feels like it was brewed with roofing tar. Immensely chunky mouthfeel.

The nose is comprised of sweet aromas--chocolate, molassass, licorice, and something alcoholic that resembles bug spray.  The state consists of chcolate, licorice, vanilla, cream sherry, coffee in the finish, and maybe just a whisper of hops.  The mouth is complex, sweet and creamy in the middle, and features a drier sherry finish--very lively on the palate, despite a lack of carbonation.

One finger head falls quickly, leaving nothing behind at all.  Aroma filled with chocolate, coffee, and booze. Rum soaked raisons, kaluha liquor, and dark bakers chocolate aromas are huge. Smells pretty good to me.  Flavor here is massive. Big time chocolate flavors, backed by good amount of espresso. Fairly roasty, but not astringent at all. Bit of alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is very heavy and smooth, due to light carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but alcohol shows through a bit much.  I really enjoyed this beer, and thanks again to TheManiacalOne for sending it to me. I think it could use a bit of age, and wish I had another for the cellar.

287,1444,PeatReek,4.65,"Reviewing a bottle from batch ___, packaged in April 2005. Sweet. Pours deep, opaque black as always, oily thick with a thin rim of deep brown head. Smell is dried-fruity, like raisins and figs and a leathery savoriness. Distinct aroma of home-baked bread crust... hm. The first thing to strike me on taking a sip is how incredibly THICK this beer is. It's like drinking syrup, but not cloyingly sweet. An interesting effect. The sip starts with the same prune / raisin elements as in the nose, followed by a round, Port-style alcohol warmth. Finishes with a prominent sweetness, well balanced by the mellow carbonation. Aftertaste is a profoundly dry, dark chocolate flavor with a roasty-charcoal aspect.  Wow. Just... wow. A tremendously complex, deeply delicious beer. Makes Wordwide Stout taste like a pile of puke!

287,1444,ElGordo,4.36,"Thought I'd break this out for review #500. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Consistency while pouring goes from a thick stout consistency to motor oil to chocoloate pudding by the end of the bottle. Body is pitch black and very thick, topped by a huge, sturdy, creamy brown head that likely could support the weight of the bottle cap. Huge aroma of roasted dark and chocolate malts is evident as soon as the cap is popped and just continues to build. A whiff or two of sweet molasses and funky, salty peat are mixed in with the malt. Palate is huge - rich, roasted, chocolatey malt, with notes of molasses, chestnut, and maple. I think I noted some scotch whisky in there, too, but that may have just been the high alcohol level coming through. Beautifully creamy body is like a beer milkshake. The creaminess strangely subsides to become more like a dry stout right before the swallow, then reappears in the throat. Contrary to what others have said, I think this is remarkably drinkable for how big a beer it is. Sure, I wouldn't want more than one bottle, but that's not the point. I savor every drop of the 12 oz bottle and end up very satisfied. An all-around amazing beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,orfeu,4.82,"Knowing that I've got six more of these scheduled for delivery tomorrow (along with several other awesome MI brews, courtesy of BA hoppymeal), I decided to crack open this bottle I received in a trade from BA nflmvp last summer. Poured into a 17-ounce snifter, Expedition Stout is viscous and tar-black. The ghost of a coffee-colored foam cap appears for a brief moment, then is gone, leaving only a nascent tan ring around the glass. Deep chocolate aromas emerge at first sniff; then scents of dark Bing cherries soaked in anejo rum along with a slight coffee aroma as well as a heady cabernet character. The taste starts off with bitter Belgian chocolate bar flavors -- at least 75% cocoa -- and dark fruits (plums, cherries, blackberries) all drunkenly swimming in a bourbon bath. Then -- and this is my favorite part -- there is the most wonderful roasted coffee finish, thick and damn near burnt it's roasted so dark. Lovely vinous aftertaste. Appropriately heavy on the palate, but incredibly silky overall. Low carbonation, dryness from alcohol content, but the booze has melded nicely (I think this bottle may be a little over a year old). This is the first Russian Imperial Stout I've had in a few months, and I certainly feel welcomed back home. Bell's brewed the hell out of this one.

287,1444,Ego,4.17,"muchos gracias to my main pimp biggie E-pseja for this little treat smuggled on over from the midwest during his latest sojourn to see the family (aka an excuse to by beer and go to 3floyds...).  eyes... an expeditiously designed bottle to be sure but alas this beer will only have one more expedition, right into my eager mouth and stomach. parting is such sweet sorrow but a beer left unopened is pure tragedy (this means you dan, you better start drinking some of your damn beers already!) ahem, where was I? this is bee-atch #7251 (2/25/6) wow, what a 'fro' on this beer (and I left my hair pick at the office...)! deep chocolate head of about 1/4 a finger, the head dissapates rather quickly into an Oring and this thing stares at you... like one big, bad ass black eye... this has the legs you would expect from someting packing 11 in the ABV pants. the color? tar? oil? asphalt at midnight during the 6 months in alaska where there is no sun... yeah, something like that. a good looking RIS, I'm psyched.  nose... chocolate rum raisins soaked in alcohol, coffee notes with a deep cocoa mystique drawing you in like the pizza guy in porno movies, this is deep and dark like nel carter's... never mind, it's deep and dark with hints of dark fruits but the domination is laid down by the cocoa powder mixed in with the alcohol. perhaps to some the alcohol might be a detriment but I think it works here, kind of like goose island's bourbon county stout, granted it is not as boozy as that one in the nose imo.  taste et al... thick and oily on the mouth, it leaves behind a slick syrup snail trail across the toungue, this is a touch hot alcohol wise, it is a hint out of balance in that regard and takes some acclimation to move past that detriment and enjoy the darker riches offerred here on this journey through 12 ounces. when held in the mouth there is an absolutely lovely smoke flavor (well, burnt really, as in burnt beyond recognition, you know like a great white concert). Once you get over the alcohol this is one to savor (a definite sipper... of course). The flavors are assertive as they are in the nose. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for me, nice and thick, total viscosity (like velvet soaked in rum). The more I sip this the more I like it, definitely give it a go at cellar temp.  verdict? I would probably have this on hand if it were local/available. Definitely needs to mellow out a bit in the cellar but alas I was awarded only one bottle. I would love to age this for a couple of years and lay it up against Stone/Raspy/Rogue etc. I think it can hang with those boys. thanks again eric, next time you are in illinois I have a request...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TheBungyo,4.65,"Props to Faro for trading this to me.  This is darker than a pit! Very little head, but what there is looks like the froth on top of a chocolate shake. Nose is full of cocoa and espresso ... maybe a little molasses and chocolate syrup as well.  Bruce Campbell might say the taste is groovey! Very big on chocolate, like dark fudge flavored with espresso. There's also some nice hop bitterness going on.  Whoa, talk about slick mouthfeel. Carbonation is low and and makes quite a minimal appearance. This is thick, rich and creamy ... I LOVE it!  If I could buy this again and again I definitely would. This is extremely delicious.

287,1444,maek228,4.2,"Appearance: the first thing you notice about this stout is how it pours. its thick like oil or syrup. there is a noticeable lack of carbonation, but that is somehow sexy when you factor in the thick pour.  Smell: Rich smell....cooking chocolate, dark chocolate, expresso....extremely ""stoutish""  Taste: Thick as a buh-dunk-ah-dunk. upfront is the bitter strength and taste expresso, with hints of chocolate and bitter burnt malts. dark fruits round this flavor out. the hops at the end of this beer are strong and they linger...the linger of the hops and expresso mesh so nice.

287,1444,BlackAngus,4.72,"A - Pours like bubblin' crude oil. Very slight head that dissipated to lace quickly. Head is color of dark coffee, beer is black like, like, something really black. Crankcase oil. A QUANTUM SINGULARITY.  S - Jesus, but this is complex. Coffee, roasted malt, bitter chocolate, no discernable hops. I could go on here, but suffice it to say it's very, very pleasantly complex.  T - Taste is coffee and roasted malts big at the front, with the other complex flavors backing it up. See the Smell portion, they're all here. I get none of the soy sauce others have picked up on, but it just may be me. Just as complex as the aroma.  M - Body on this baby is like syrup. Very full-bodied, very little carbonation. Roasted malt/coffee in the finish. Not clean, but it's not supposed to be. You taste this one for a while after you finish it.  D - Exceptionally drinkable over the long term, I don't think I could have more than one or two a day.

T - Huge, rich complexity of roasted and burnt malts, soy sauce, coffee, chocolate. Subdued hop bitterness, no hop flavor. Clean, no diacetyl.  M - Viscious, sticky coating on the palate, quite still -- almost no carbonation, slick.  D - I've never had this fresh, but it has held up well for the most part. Rather complex and enjoyable.

I had a flashback to Vicks 44-D cough syrup. Could this Imperial Stout with ABV of 11.5% become lightstruck? this made my cheekbone muscles cramp up. Kalamazoo by this brewer is the best stout Ive ever enjoyed. This is a big beer though, its like climbing a wall. To me the Hop and Cherry flavors didnt mix. My throat and torso burned for hours after consuming this. Did I drink it too cold? did I get too much sediment? Is this diactyl flavor from being light struck? or do I just not like the hop/fruit balance?(Ive stated before that I really do not care much for fruit beers...)

Great lace is left in it's wake. Nose is full of dark chocolate, cherry, and what would seem to be a boat load of alcohol. Roasty burnt toffee dark chocolate. Nice amount of cherry like fruit behind. The alcohol is very evident, more so than some stronger beers. Full bodied and moderateley carbonated. Kind of creamy. Has quite the alcohol kick. Good beer, but is most definately a sipper.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jwc215,2.73,"Pours pitch black with a light brown head that soon fades to a patch, then disappears. Nice color, but disappointing head. I know that the abv works against head retention, but there was none to speak of.  The smell is of dark chocolate with some subtle dark fruit notes. The alcohol masks most of the aromas.  Thick, dark chocolate with an alcohol punch upfront. The sweet chocolate is so dominant that it reminded me of a chocolate stout more than an IRS. It is certainly full-bodied, but more in a chocolate malt sort of way. It reminds me of when I was a child and would put too much chocolate syrup in my milk. The alcohol creates a harsh edge, as it is not masked in any way. As there is little, if any hops, it becomes cloyingly sweet. They have the chocolate and alcohol down pat, but where is the complexity that the style calls for? A dark fruit essence tries to come through, but that is too syrupy and masked by the chocolate and alcohol. The feel is creamy and softer than the taste, but without any carbonation it does not go down so easily. And, again, the sharp alcohol edge detracts more than adds. I can appreciate a beer with a high abv, and this is one of my favorite styles, but this one doesn't do it for me. Overly malty, even for the style, no carbonation, and the alcohol is not masked and doesn't really add to the flavor, leaving the sweet rich chocolate to be the only dimension to its potential.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,yelterdow,4.28,"Enormous thanks to EPseja for procuring this beer from his recent Michigan trip... at $18.99 a sixer, this one's got some explaining to do!  Served at cellar temperature in a snifter. Batch 7251, bottled on February 25, 2006.  Appearance- Black as night, with the darkest head I've ever seen on a beer... amazing swelling carbonation from within the depths of the beer, growing to about a finger-thick head and reducing to a half centimeter. Looks like a liquid Hershey's dark chocolate pool... with bubble size ranging from indiscernable to medium and large size. Upon swirling, the black abyss regenerates a new creamy head and becomes even darker than before. Wow.  Smell- Rich, fudge brownie with mocha-laced aromas of chocolate, cookies, and rum. Notes of floral hops tingle the tip of the nose. Very ingredient-dense. Alcohol is not a detractor here at all.  Taste- A virtual oil slick of flavor, with an incredible length of hop bitterness. First comes a rich, dark cocoa combined with a mocha character... then the wickedly decadent and smooth richness follows.  Mouthfeel/Drinkabililty- Fantastic in the mouth... sublime swelling from milky liquid to creamy foam. Savor each sip, it's genuinely huge and enjoyable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,onsite416,4.75,"Appearance: black. Head bubbles to a glorious brownish froth. A lacing almost as impressive as true Turkish coffee is left as you swirl the glass, exquisite. Smell: roasted malts right away, and a smokiness I cant put my finger on. An enticing aroma! Taste: with all of the aromas the taste does not disappoint. very thick. It starts off very roasty, the alcohol pretty well hidden for a beer of this caliber, it ends with a nuttiness that does not end. You are constantly chewing for different flavors. There are also hints of caramel and coco too. The finish is a little bitter. Mouth feel: This is not a harsh beer, but it is certainly not easy one either. Very smooth and extremely creamy. Drinkability: OK they should almost have a warning on the label ""one is more than enough."" Session beer? (You will hurt yourself 11.5 ABV). This is a big Imperial stout.

Poured a thick black motor oil w/ a 1 2/2 inch mocha brown head. The sight made me think I was going to drinking a cuban expresso. The aroma was amazing and well balanced, sweet molasses, strong coffee and a vicious alcohol scent. The scent of alcohol doesn't disappoint as it also lingers in your mouth forever w/ a thick full body syrupy feeling.

However, I found that it is NOT the beer for a hot summers night. Great aroma of very sweet malty chocolate and carmel. The taste follows suit, and at first was enjoyable. However, by mid glass, the beer seemed to get thicker and sweeter, and by the end, the alcohol was leaving a very warming sensation and it was like drinking a sweet thick syrup. I intend to pick up another bottle of this when Im in the midwest, and next time drink it on a cold winters night, maybe as an after-dinner drink.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Raisin and plum and cherry are the first thing I smell.Sugar and malt are the second thing. First taste is quite bitter but the chocolate and coffee are strong here. No alcohol present even though it is a high abv. Grapes and raisins and dark malt with a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is very clean and the dark tastes stay in the mouth for a while. The alcohol is only present at the very end of the taste. I like this beer.

The smell is wonderful, of intense/complex chocolate malts with hints of caramel. The taste is just as complex, with an alcohol bite at the end, but not too bad considering the 11.5%. Almost no hop taste is apparent, covered completely by the roasted chocolate malt taste. The mouthfeel is dense and smooth, a very thick beer with little carbonation. This beer would be best served as a nightcap, served in a snifter - to be smelled, enjoyed and sipped, not drank in mass quantity.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Six years ago, a camp counselor friend in Michigan told how great Expedition Stout was and since then, I've been looking forward to trying it. I was not disappointed one bit.

287,1444,jdoolin,4.39,"Presentation: 12oz bottle, poured into a brandy snifter  Appearance: Dead black, like old motor oil. A slight brown head formed and dissipated quickly, leaving a ring of brown lace the entire time.  Aroma: Heavenly aroma of roasted barley, molasses, hints of coffee and chocolate, and of course a bit of alcohol. This beer smelled so good, I couldn't keep my nose out of the snifter the entire time.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Thick, smooth and creamy, like velvet. Just enough carbonation to achieve this and maintain the ring of lace. Taste was an ode to roasted malt. All of the usual roasted malt flavors are here and are wonderfully exemplifed. Of course, the roasted barley itself, coffee (especially in the finish) and chocolate. No hop flavor. Bitterness seems to be achieved more by the roasted malt than the hops. The alcohol was present but subdued by the roasted malt flavors.  Notes: A superb imperial stout. I thought the alcohol would have more presence, but I was pleasantly surprised. The roasted malts are the center of this beer, and Kalamazoo has done a fantastic job exploiting them.

It's black. But not relaly much of a head. A tan head surfaced at first, but by the time I sat down, the head was gone, and didn't really bother to cling to the side of the glass, either. Oh well. The smell is lovely. Chocolate, coffee, and jsut general sweetness. No alcohol is discernable on the nose. It's nice. Really nice. Taste? Holy cow! Huge! Massive! Chocolate just kicked me in the face. It's sweet, but with a bitter finish. Warm on the back of the throat. Really nice.

287,1444,mjc410,4.1,"First bottle from my very own case...  The pour into my venerable La Moneuse tulip at first made me fear that there would be head head whatsoever, but out of nowhere bubbles appeared in the incredibly viscous ink. The bubbles themselves are incredibly thick-walled and oily looking. I had a Yeti the other day, and this appears even more massive, although the head is a good deal lighter, only a medium light brown, with large bubbles and thick lacing. It hangs around for quite a while, too. And what can be said about the body except BLACK? No light, no hope. None.  Smell is incredibly toasty and espresso-like. Definitely smells like expensive brownies, and fudge. Smells bitter, too. I like.  Good gracious, what is this taste? I'm at a loss for words - this is unique! Alcohol, definitely, and wood, for sure. Caramel leads the flavors. I'm picking up on some chocolate notes, and a coffee finish. I was hoping for more chocolate coffee flavors, though. Does become a bit cloying, as well.  Too heavy? Maybe...this certainly is the thickest beer I've ever had. No carbonation, either. Still, it is fitting. Although this beer certainly would be a good candidate for a nip bottle...  I will reach for another, and I do like this a lot, but I wished for a bit more. Not the best RIS I've had, but still nice.

Poured out of a bottle, there is minimum tan colored head that disappears quickley and leaves a little lacing around the glace. The color is jet black.  There is a smell of alcohol and dark chocolate and maybe raisons.  The taste is of espresso and chocolate. There is a bitterness consistant with espresso. The taste of alcohol is also very present, yet is pretty drinkable with the high levels of alcohol.  The mouthfeel of this beer is the only subpar aspect of this beer.

A ring remains with faint remnants of the head that once was across the top.  S: Molasses, marshmallow cream, cherries, red grape juice, black patent and resinous chocolate. Delightful  T: Begins very rich and creamy with some serious chocolate expressions. Reminds me of a luxurious chocolate-espresso cream you'd find in the middle of a killer cake. Moments remind me of a premeire chocolate syrup laced with cognac. The beer then transitions from a quaint dessert to something a bit more unrefined....the roasted coffee characteristics and severe bittering hops turn this once friendly puppy into an aggresive beast. With out an ounce of remorse, the roastedness dominates the palate before ever so slowly dwindling away leaving the mouth in shock and awe.  M: Full bodied with a great mouthfeel.

S: Heavy coffee & chocolate aroma with roasted malt, a touch of dark fruits and a hint of alcohol.  T: Heavy roasted coffee flavor dominates the taste. As you drink more of it, you start to get a little bit of the bitter dark chocolate & hops which completely hides the high ABV.  M: Smooth, oily & thick, full bodied, light carbonation, very sticky finish though.

Well hopped and burning aroma of vanilla, coffee, plum, and booze. Tastes and feels like bitter and acidic coffee sludge with a hint of chocolate and a shot of gasoline thrown in for good measure. Dark fruits are also present. Very assertive, butt kicking beer. A bit much to drink more than a few ounces of. Long term aging would do this beer well.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,expatsteve,3.8,"Thanks for sharing this one, Golden2wenty1.  Appearance: Black, with a 1/2 inch cappucino head. Nice thick lacing on the beer and the glass. Medium viscosity.  Aroma: Plum, cane sugar, chocolate and a booze/hops edge.  Taste: Booze over chocolate and molasses. Cream, toffee, raisin developments, along with a sharp boozy bite. Plum sweetness and a few espresso bursts, but definitely the most spicy stout I've ever had.  Mouthfeel: Thick and spicy, with a lot of hops and booze character. Low carbonation focuses attention squarely on the more aggressive characteristics of the beer.  Drinkability: While the flavor is balanced and fairly impressive, the bite in this beer is definitely a challenge. Enjoyable and distinct, but not most drinkable big stout I've had. Will probably please hopheads and strong beer fans who appreciate aggressive flavors.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Golden2wenty1,4.13,"Been sitting on a few bottles left over from a six pack for a few months. Broke them out for the Madison Big Stout Session, already known as one of the most epic tastings ever to be attempted.  Pour: crude oil thick and black, glug, glug, glugs into a taster under soapy capuccino head with a bit of chunky lacing.  Nose: espresso, vanilla cream, gasoline booze/hops, oatmeal malt, dark fruit and oatmeal malt.  Taste: appleskin tart, espresso bitterness, creamy vanilla sweet, unleaded booze-spicy, chocolate booze, black cherry and currant booze and a bit of nuttiness in the finish.  Feel: chocolate syrup thick, oily slick, uber-fine carbonation.  Drinkability/Overall: J.H.C., this is a potent beast of a beer - kudos for that - but a bit of a chore to drink, even 6 ounces worth.

287,1444,twelvinlucifer,4.73,"Pours slow and thick. The head looks like chocolate milk foam! Tapers off after a while into a very nice lacing cover. Smells of chocolate and and coffee. Unbelievable smooth taste, lots of roasted malt in this one! There has to be a ton of chocolate malt in this as well. There is a nice bitter back-end on this that I can't quite put my finger on, but, it balances out quite nicely. Mouth feel is very nice, very clean for a stout of this magnitude. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste and when it hits the tummy it really warms you up!  This is probably My favorite stout of all time so far.

287,1444,bjohnson,3.67,"A: As I'm pouring this, I'm wondering if it's engine oil or a beer. Very thick jet black color with no head. No head=no carbonation....hmmm. Is it flat? It's got the color of a RIS, but I'm a bit curious. S: Caramel, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit notes hit the palate all at once. Hard to decipher what is what in there. It's like getting lost in a black hole. Smells spicy and and a bit sweet for an RIS. High abv is definately noticeable. T/M: Prickly on the lips even before I swallow some. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, and dark fruit flavors blend in and out with each peaking through here and there. After it initially goes down, theres an over eager sweet spicyness that floods the senses. Big long coffee aftertaste with a slight bitterness. Smooth, creamy, and velvety in the mouth. Coats the mouth, but doesn't hold like oil. Washes away pretty fast leaving you with a dry aftertaste. Huge body and very very complex. No carbonation on this guy makes me wonder if I'm drinking oil or a beer. D: Abv is very noticeable. This could be a very drinkable RIS if it just calms a bit more--Possibly I cracked it too soon? Luckily I have another in the fridge. Pretty decent tasting RIS from Bell's, but I'm not sure about it. There was just something amiss. Everyone seemed to like it, but I'll swim against the current on this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Phatz,4.85,"Thanks to Jasonm for giving me this beer. I really enjoyed this beer. Sorry to take so long until I reviewed it.  Appearance: This beer pour absolute black! The head is moderate in size but rich in red brown color. A nice lacing is left as you swirl the beer, it simply looks exquisite.  Smell: Smelling this beer just absolutely teases the senses! A magnificent plethora of dark rum tobacco, leather, roasted malts, dark vinous grape aromas and more flood through the nose and straight to the brain sending me instantly into a state of awe! I guess you could simply say that it is a *very* enticing aroma!  Taste: After all the anticipation from the aroma the beer does not disappoint as it enters the mouth. It is vinous and thick. It starts off very roasty and the alcohol and hop dance like pins and needles on your tongue then as your palate adjust you begin to taste the remarkable depth and complexity with deep red flavors of grape and cherries meeting tobacco rum charcoal bitter flavor and balancing brilliantly. There are also hints of sweet like a caramel and coco with vanilla in there too. The finish is very bitter, with a spicy alcohol burn like a great bourbon. The alcohol is not shy and I love that feature as a whiskey fan.  Mouthfeel: There is plenty of rough around the edges that keep you awake and appreciating each sip. It is not *harsh* but it is certainly not easy either. This is for a fan of RIS who likes liquor. The feel in the mouth is thick and smooth. It is so creamy I can hardly imagine any beer could be creamier.  Drinkability: Simply put this beer is a perfect night cap! It is not a session beer (unless you want to hurt yourself). This beer is very big and not one I would call approachable. It is intimidating but for those who want a big ass Russian Imperial Stout stand back and get ready because here comes Bell's Expedition Stout.  Hope this is helpful.

287,1444,KilgoreTrout27,3.47,"Poured into a standard pint glass.  This beer could be exceptional, but it has some problems that are holding it back. Pours a deep black with no head whatsoever. Looks like motor oil, which isn't necessarily a bad thing with this beer. The smell of toasted malts is faint. The flavors of the beer are good, with coffee dominating as well as hints of chocolate. Big alcohol taste with this one, that gives off a nice burn. The mouthfeel is where this one misses out. Its thick and oily, which is okay, but where is the carbonation? If this had more carbonation it would help balance the oily finish. Drinkability is also hurt by this, as well as the high alcohol taste.  As I stated at the beginning, this beer could be great, and many other BA reviews don't seem to have a problem with the way this is put together, but I found that the lack of carbonation really held this beer back.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bigman147,4.23,"Appearance: Pours like dark crude oil. Viscous and black with dark brown bubbles as the only head formed. Impressive how black this stout is.  Aroma: Lots of malt, some raisin, Coffe, maybe toffee. Very aromatic with lots of depth. As the beer warms in my glass, each layer is peeled off like an onion. Absolutely wonderful with a slight amouth of hops and alcohol  Taste: Almost completely malt but with such depth. Slight sweet syrupy taste with good malt balance and slight hop bitterness. Malt makes way to a coffee finish. Slight sourness in the finish and a slight amount of smoke also.  Mouthfeel: Heavy syrupy notes with good carbonation to avoid being cloying. A slight creaminess in the finish.  Drinkability: I think that this is a wonderful beer. But it is by no means a session beer. The alcohol is powerful and the shear syrupy liquidness would make drinking 2 difficult.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,HimerMan,4.38,"12 oz bottle served in an AleSmith pint glass (just got them in).  Awesome pour - (poured side by side with Victory Storm King aged from Nov 04 2004), black like tar with a nice dark ruby hue in the light. Head was strong dark-brown.  Taste - near exceptional, this comes in at a dark chocolate taste with a nice, and appropiate, alcohol finish (not harsh though). Wonderful head and retention, aroma is excellent and no hops flavor at all.  This is hard to drink more than one of, and it would be hard giving this anything higher than 4.25 in the drinkability category - though, in no way is this hard to drink if you are trying it. Same for mouthfeel - this is not for the faint of stout. Imperial Stout fans - this is a must.  I am drinking this on the colder side, note why the hops are low, and am enjoying it more this way than at warmer temperatures.  Buy this beer, it is absolutely worth it, I am going to age some for 6-9 months to see if some of the alcohol gets masked.  Wonderful.

287,1444,maundythirsty,4.52,"There was so much sludge in the bottle that I left a half-inch of beer behind on the pour. I dumped a bunch of it in my first Expedition Stout and the taste suffered quite a bit.  Head? From this barrel of oil? Skimpy layer of greasy brown bubbles turns quickly into a tiny ring of bubbles around the top of a glass full of midnight. Smell is baker's chocolate, roasted grains and maple. This beer has serious weight. I may be imagining the hops, but I think it's there up front before a round moutful of sweet roasted coffe and bitter chocolate.  Thick in your mouth to great effect, but I think it would do better with more carbonation. You understand the high alcohol is there without being distracted. A stunner. I don't know about having more than one in a sitting. However, I'm rating the third bottle I've had, and I'm already thinking about how wise it is to have only three more on hand.  Put off only by the sheer amount of greasy yellow goop that is fairly hard to keep out of the pour.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Smelled mainly of the deep roasted malts that gave off a strong coffee and chocolate aroma. It also carried along a strong alcohol aroma.  T: Very similar that the aroma that fit well with the rainy and dark day that Cincinnati was having on the day that I drank this beer. It was a lovely coffee and chocolate taste that just really hit the spot, not unlike a comfort food.  M: Very very thick. This beer coated your whole mouth when it entered. When it was in you mouth and after you swallowed it left a lovely warming sensation throughout the body that was lovely on the rainy day.  D: I found this beer highly drinkable.

287,1444,shbobdb,3.48,"Strange.  There is a lot of cookie dough in this beer. That isn't a bad thing . . . but I'm not sure I'm feeling it right now. The cookie dough is married first with coffee, which is where I think the flavours clash a little. A low-milk, high sugar latte with a dash of chocolate thrown in. Maybe a dash of molassas as well.  It actually reminds me of my homebrewed RIS. Here is the recipe: 2 Edme Stout Kits 3lbs Laaglander Amber DME 1lb Dextrose 6oz Blackstap Molassas 10oz Brown sugar 1oz Chinook hops at 90 minutes.

287,1444,veggiemafia,4.2,"Pours blacker than black. You have to ask yourself how much more black it can be, and the answer is none, it can be none more black. Moderate dark tan head that dissolves pretty quickly to thin islands. But hey, with 11.5% I think that's kind of excusable.  Smell is big on baker's chocolate with a booziness reminiscent of Tia Maria coffee rum. Also, raisins/prunes/dark fruit make a huge appearance, as do some really earthy smelling hops.  The hops in this serve to rein it in and keep it from getting too sweet, but it REALLY pushes it for me in terms of being too sweet and fruity. That earthiness keeps it dry and pretty refreshing, but it's still really big on dark fruits and raisins and maybe like a tart blackberry jam thing. That distinct tart fruitines is something I've only experienced in this and Batch 7000, and Southern Tier Jah-Va.  Mouthfeel is viscous and thick, but still really creamy and velvety and luxurious.

287,1444,Tupperwolf,4.44,"Poured from a 12oz bottle purchased at Warehouse Liquor in Duluth, MN.  It pours a solid, deep, cowboy-coffee black, with no light showing through; A thin, very dark tan head hangs around for a little while, becoming a thin ring after a minute or two. It fills the pint glass like a near-solid mass - very stout beer indeed.  dark, extremely intense coffee and chocolate flavors are present in the nose - some beers smell like coffee, this beer smells like coffeee!!! Ther are vinuous notes, and a sort of nutty banana-bread twinge, along with the warm liqueur of alcohol.  The flavors follow the scents extremely well, with a deep, wine-like fruitiness mingling with tongue-tingling, throat, soaking chocolate and coffee - I get huge notes of hazelnut three-espresso-shot latte! Delicious!  Mouthfeel is complex, seeming both light and very heavy all at once. It's lightly carbonated, but thick, so the mouth is very happy. Just enough lovely, lightly sticky aftertaste hangs around to invite further sips.  Definitely a world-class imperial stout.

287,1444,Zorro,4.03,"12 Oz bottle sampled through the efforts of dirtylou and The No BS BIF.  Pours an opaque black colored beer that passes no light. A small but extremely dark brown head forms and then disappears. Not a bad stab at trying to create a beer with a black head.  Smell is Sharp sweet and very much like Kahlua. Strong coffee and chocolate aromas. Fruity and wine like scents are also in this one, mostly figs and dates with a slight amount of banana in the very fringe of it. Brown sugar and burnt sugar aromas and a little pineapple upside down cake.  Taste is thick and sharply bitter and charred in the first sip, long lasting charcoal flavor. A thick bitter beer that is very much a concentrated stout, almost like a beer mix that you just add carbonated water. After you get past the charred shock of the first taste there is a lot of chocolate flavor here and it is fairly sweet. There is some fruitiness here but it is pretty much hidden by the charred flavor.  Mouthfeel is syrup thick.  This is a beer a lot like Turkish coffee, it is OK in small amounts but you tire of it quickly. This would be a great beer for a 4 oz shot but a glassful gets tiring quickly.

The finish is slightly rough, as the alcohol bashes on the back of the tongue. It lingers a bit too.  The first few I had of these were a bit... um... too thick. Too much.

287,1444,BAbaracus,5,"My scores are going to be largely out of line with everyone elses, but my only explanation for this is that the Expedition may be a hit-and-miss beer. This is my first time experiencing it so its possible I stumbled across one of their better batches aged for just long enough to blend the flavors perfectly. Anyway, disclaimer out of the way, here we go: Pours pitch black with a gorgeous (almost edible) milk chocolate head, with dense packs of carb bubbles clinging seductively to the sides of the glass. Smells of brown sugar, molasses, a touch of black licorice, and dark malt, all of which blends into a bouquet far more inviting and less intrusive than other beers of this abv magnitude. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, very milkshake like, leaving a sticky coating on the lips and tongue. Cholocate and sugars predominant up front followed by dark roasted malt on finish. Superb flavoring - all other ingredients whiffed before drinking blend so well into the chocolate and malt as to be almost individually imperceptible. Alcohol is unbelievably well hidden, probably the best that Ive ever seen for this strong of a brew. Although the alcohol does eventually make its presence known, its more in the ""gullet burn"" than in the taste. You really have to be looking for it on the tongue to even realize its there. No perceptible way to improve this beer at all in my eyes, so perfect 5.0s all around. I do believe this one has slipped into my top 5.

Aroma is overpowering with alcohol...extremely distracting. Possibly a little chocolate comes through but all I can smell is that alcohol. Taste is of carmel, burnt chocolate and coffee, but again, the alcohol taste is hugely overpowering. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little oily and the drinkability is definitely low. Don't get fooled by the high rating, this is hardly in the top 20 stouts in my book, unless you happen to like the taste of alcohol overpowering everything.

Sweet malt tries to squeeze through the alcohol but is unsuccessful. When I noticed this beer was 11.5, I was taken back but it really ruins the nose of this beer.  The taste is a tad bit maltier but once again completely spoiled by the alcohol. There are some dark fruits (raisins, plums) trying to poke through following and it finishes with a black coffee taste which is very dry after swallowing .  This brew is very thick.

287,1444,benito,5,"Here is a wonderful beer.  Dark as midnight, oily and heavy with a dark tan head that dissipates quickly. The bouquet is a mix of currant, rum, and dark chocolate (pure cocoa). Yet, it is the complexity of the taste, the swirl of different spices and flavors--coconut, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, raisin, burnt wood, black pepper, and smoke--that makes me swoon.  The various layers of flavor weave in and out of a smooth, albeit heavy, texture that glides across the tongue, leaving a slightly bittersweet aftertaste. For something so heavy, so strong, and so complex, I moved through my first bottle of this with frightening speed and would have kept going if I had had more on hand.  This may be the RIS by which all others should be measured.

There is no question this is a massive brew, It assaults you with chocolate, roasted malts, and hops.  Mouthfeel- Thick and creamy, clings like cough syrup.

287,1444,RedwoodGeorge,4.38,"The pour was much more exciting that I first thought - this comes out a thick, chunky, heavy black liquid that kind of ""plops"" into the glass with no release of carbonation at all. ""Oh great,"" I thought, ""a heavy, flat stout - yippee..."" I finished the pour with a flourish but still no more than a few bubbles. I turned my back to toss the bottle in the recycling bin and by the time I turned back around - beercano! A huge head of mocha foam had risen up, out and over the pint glass leaving a small black puddle on the countertop. Even in a very thin layer in the puddle it was completely opaque. The remaining three finger head stuck around for a long time and left a surprising amount of lacing on the glass.  The aroma was very nice - lots of heavy fruit notes with a dark sweet malt and cocoa scents mixed in.  The taste was just short of perfect. (My stout loving girlfriend may not rate beer here on BA but one sip and she declared ""This is the best beer I've ever tasted!"") There are very strong notes of fig and raisin on top of a rather sweet caramel and treacle base. Echoes of dark chocolate and coffee serve to finish each sip. No hint of alcohol at all - though some of the sweetness may have been due to the high ABV. Good balance to the flavors - they're all strong but none of them is overpowering.  Mouthfeel is rather impressive as well. This is a seriously heavy bodied brew with a viscosity close to maple syrup but it didn't leave a sweet or sticky residue on the palate (quite a trick) There was still enough fine bodied carbonation left to give the beer a creamy consistency similar to hot cocoa. Just a small amount of roasted grain bittering at the end but it's enough to provide a good finish.  Wow - what a beer! I can't imagine how they could have improved it. (Well, okay, if they had tossed it in an oak barrel for a few months it could have been even more awesome but that's about it) This brew was just shy of perfect in nearly every category.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The aroma is sweet chocolate, lots of alcohol, raisins, anise and cola.  The flavor is the same as the aroma...very sweet chocolate malts, lots of alcohol, and some dark fruits. It finishes sweet and sugary but with a burnt bitterness that helps to balance it out some. The mouthfeel is medium to full and smooth but low on carbonation.  I was worried that this would be another disappointment like the Mephistopheles. It was similar in some ways (lots of sweetness and alcohol), but this was not as over the top and better balanced.

287,1444,neonbrown82,4.62,"This is the second time I've had this brew. The first time was obviously a bad batch with a thick jism-like substance coating the bottom of the bottle, what I presumed was yeast and proteins.  The beer pours to a completely opaque black with a very thin chocolatey head. Tried hard to get more foam, but the high alcohol must have prevented it from getting to where I would have liked it to be. Pours very thick and viscous, almost as thick as I've seen.  The smell is good. Very sweet with molasses with some rich roasted barley and fruity esters. A little bit smokey. Quite complex and interesting, but still has that hint of anise and soy sauce that prevents me from giving it the extra .5%.  The taste is very similar. Very rich, flavorful and complex. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, Expedition Stout. If I were to pick out one prime example of Imperial Stout, I would be hard pressed to choose between Sam Smith's, Stone's, and this one.  The body is uber thick and chewey. Very nice. Not too bitter or sweet, doesn't dry out too bad in the finish. Good stuff. This sludge almost demands a knife and fork to drink it. As good as it is, it would be hard to drink much more than one in a night.

Smell is roasted malts, smoke, soy, peat/earth, nuts, serious dark chocolate, you know, the 70% kind. Nice complexity and great balance. Taste is very close to the nose. Rich, malty, smoke, peat/earth, soy and noticeable but not overpowering alcohol bloom. I had no idea this brew was 11.5%. Chewy, creamy, borderline viscous, it just flows across your tongue. Full bodied with light effervescence. Unexpected, but pleasant, memories of Samiclaus without the overwhelming presence of that brew.

It pours incredibly thick, yet silky smooth, with a great big, ruby brown head that leaves a dusting on top of the beer and lacing on the sides of the glass. No light escapes from this beer. The nose of this stout is full of great burnt smells -- espresso, caramel, molasses -- and some yeasty dark fruits and berries. The aroma reminds me very much of Victory's Storm King Stout, actually.  Tastewise, again, ""huge"" is the theme here. Tons of sweet dark berry flavors, followed by burnt coffee, dark chocolate, and just a hint of peppery alcohol. Considering this thing is 11.5 percent ABV, it hides its alcohol extremely well. Expedition Stout rolls around the mouth with extreme thickness and creaminess, almost like a melted milkshake. I could swill this stuff all night were it not for the staggering -- literally -- ABV.

S - Coffee and chocolate, sweet but with just enough roast to stop it from being sugar. For sure a bittersweet chocolate resides.  T - Roast at the very front, and very back, otherwise all chocolate. A very sweet RIS, most are a charcoal fire in my mouth. Also, if you know what you are looking for you can still get a nice hop touch out in front.  M - Outside of maybe Dark Lord, and maybe even running with that, the richest and creamiest I've had. Super thick and smooth.  D - Drinkability is outstanding, even at a more than wealthy 11.5%. I've had this a few times, and this is the first time I am reviewing it and for some reason it seems so much better this time around.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Erdinger2003,3.93,"Appearance is very nice, the head is thick and doesn't dissapte very fast and has a good lacing that sticks. Black color is solid.  Smell has coffee, molasses, dark fruit tones and is full in body and flavor.  Taste has flavors of coffee, molasses, and slight flavors of dark fruit like prune.

287,1444,SethB2,4.36,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beer pours heavy. Bell's Expedition is the very definition of the motor oil comparison. Pours black with a deep brown head and a very nice amount of lacing. Smells good as well. Roasted, nutty malts covering a slight alcohol smell. Taste is very good. Chocolaty malts and a sweet bite going down. Very nice. Mouthfeel is as chewy as they come, but also like silk. Drinkablility is only hampered by the high alcohol content.  Very nice beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,badbeer,4.78,"Very dark brown, almost black, pretty thick tan head leaving waves, yes waves of lacing on the glass. Chocolate aroma, only a faint coffee smell and a little bit of alcohol in the nose; a little more coffee roasted flavor and this would have had a five. Chocolate starts you off, leading you into a bit of coffee flavor mixed with some hopiness, then chocolate and coffee paired together with an alcohol warmth at the finish. A complete joyride the taste is. Thick, full bodied, little carbonation and seems to be perfect. Each drink is great and an all out experience of the senses, just a little short of perfect. With reviews varying in quality levels, I'm glad I picked up a good one. Scratch that, great one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Large roasted malt smells... whiff is wonderful... big coffee and nice caramel and bourbon.  Mouthfeel is exceptional... silky smooth palate. Milky. Slight alcohol burn in the throat and stomach. Utterly terrific.  Taste is chocolatey/coffee... large roasted grain leftover on the palate and a great balance of alcohol.

Some sweet fruity (prunes) alcohol in the nose. Hits the tongue with a wave of coffee perfection. Sweet prune and chocolately flavors as well. Low but appropriate carbonation levels.

Tastes like deep cocoa fudge with mellow raspberry. Oily and strong herbage. Very nice, though I could like a little more bite. The alcohol is at a perfect level.

287,1444,skizziks,3.83,"12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pour gives about an inch of dark cocoa foam, thick, leaves thick sheets on the side as it settles. A thin layer sticks around for a long time. The beer is a deep mahogany, not quite opaque.  Aroma is immediately vinous, roasty, with raisins and figs. Deep and complex.  Flavor starts out with some sharp acid, vinous with a wash of malt syrup. Figs follow with coffee beans and cocoa leading to a long lingering finish of burnt coffee. A little astringent, but not overpoweringly so. A nice counterpoint to the syrupy sweetness and roasted bitter.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. Coats the tongue with a lasting impression of powdered cocoa. I don't mean to give the idea that this is some sort of cocoa flavored beer, but there is definitely an element of unsweetened cocoa down in there with all of the other flavors. This is a wonderful, rich, complex beer. I have been sipping on this one for about an hour and a half and enjoying the hell out of it. Drinkability is rated low because the burnt flavors really slow me down (in a good way) where others of the style are relatively easy to sip continuously. Overall, this is a very very good beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Shovelbum,4.75,"Pourslike motor oil. Dark brown, almost like the foam on chocolate milk but darker, finger and half head over a solid black body. Head recedes but leaves a delicate web of chocolate lace. Rich aromas of chocolate, a bit of espresso and a light nuttiness. A trace of earthy hops as well. Upfront, the flavor is the embodiment of richness. Smooth, sweet milk chocolate flavor provides the base joined by a bit of burnt espresso. The scene changes however when a spicy, earthy character makes itself known half-way through the sip. Also a nice vinous fruit character throughout and delectable sweetness that is there in quite a substantial way, but is never demands center stage. Full bodiedno doubt about that. Low to moderate carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel with a clean finish.  Praise the heavens this fine ale. Waves of complexity unfold in your mouth in nearly perfect succession. Depth too. To do this one justice most certainly requires more research. That and a larger vocabulary.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Graham21,3.9,"BLACK BLACK BLACK! This beer is dark, looks like motor oil. Head was only about a mm thick and left nice lacing in the glass.  In the nose I picked up on chocolate, cherries, roasted malts, hops, light coffee and maple undertones. I tasted chocolate covered cherries, sweet and roasted malts, raisins, along with maple and coffee undertones, coffee becoming very stong in the aftertaste. Carbonation is lacking to say the least, and the alcohol isnt hidden, it burns my throat slightly, but the beer seems to be fairly creamy and oil like on the palate. I enjoyed this imperial stout but would have enjoyed it more if the finish would have been smoother and the carbonation would have been there.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,woodychandler,4.53,"My first reaction was ""WTF, did they fill my bottle with motor oil by mistake?!?"" I tried an aggressive pour and still only managed wisps of head in the glass. The beer was viscous, black (even the white bits was black), oily, with the only head a thin coating on the top of the liquid. The nose was huge with alcohol and chocolate. The mouthfeel was both slick and thick. After my first swallow, I realized that Larry ain't playin' around here. This is lights out action in a bottle. Nitey nite. My notes remind me to sic Carolyn Blowers on this one, since she has proven capable of drinking Russian Imperial Stouts first thing in the morning. I got an interesting mix of bittersweet chocolate, charcoal, and smoke floating across my tongue. The finish was smoky and chocolaty, just beautiful.

287,1444,ColoradoBobs,4.85,"Had this paired with FFF Dark Lord in a tasting with Crosling. (PROPS TO CROSLING!!!!) Talk about sensory overload!  Vigorous pour into a tulip glass produces a black opaque body under a decent light brown reverse-cascading head.  Smell of dark chocolate covered raisins, prunes, malty malt on malted malt.  Taste of intense sweet malt, chocolate malt, raisins, figs, charred apples(?), espresso, rye bread and pepper. Ridiculously intense.  Mouthfeel is thick and rich, like a melted chocolate malt. It's round, dense, full, smooth and chewy, with a gluteny, bread-like quality.  Very drinkable for 11.5%. Wowow. Dangerous.  Overall, this is the most incredible beer for the money I've ever had: at $2.33 for a 12-ounce bottle (= 19.43 cents per ounce), it is nearly as good as Dark Lord, which is $15 for 22 ounces (=68.2 cents per ounce).

The smell has light toasted milk chocolate notes, with a hint of raspberry and cherry. Slight alcoholic nose also. The taste begins with sweet chocolate and mild hops, the finish turns dry with a roasty bitterness that I enjoy immensely, though it is fairly subdued. Alcohol is not that noticible, but does burn a bit as it goes down. Thick and chewy mouthfeel, rich with subtle carbonation.  This stout nearly achieves a delicate balance, except the smoky finish is slightly overpowered by the fruity chocolate malt that is perhaps overly sweet. It's a strong brew also, making it hard to drink more that one or two.

Mouthfeel: Thick Mouthfeel with hardly any carbonation.  Drinkability: Due to the alcohol and richness of the beer I only could have 1 in a sitting.  A great example of the style.

Oh, if only all beers looked this mouth-watering.  Smells like chocolate chip cookies dipped in alcohol. A warm cookiedough smell to it with subtle hints of dark, rich fruits.  The first sip coats your mouth with melted dark german chocolate as a plethora of flavors make themselves known. Chocolate chip cookie taste as stated before, plenty of alcohol but isn't over-bearing. Has a rich winey taste of a red wine with some prune and dark cherries to round it out. Finishes very smoothly for a stout with this kind of power. Wow.  What a great beer. I would've given it solid 5's except for the drinkability gets a little rough as it warms.

To quote the great Garrett Oliver on his opinion of this beer, ""...seems to absorb light, mopping it up like a black hole in space."" I couldn't agree more. A film of foam is leftover after the pour and gradually thins to a ring around the beer.  Smell- Reminds me of 7-eleven coffee that has been sitting on the burner too long. With some smokey and burnt malts mixed with a little mocha.  Taste- When the beer is a bit chilled, the flavor of mocha and smoked malts ndominates with a little grassy hops jumping in. Once it warms to almost rom temperature, the flavors take on a slightly milky and dark roast 7-Eleven coffee taste.

287,1444,macster,4.45,"Just a huge, classy, but muscular Imperial Stout. Pours inky black and as thick and viscous as year old motor oil. Develops a thin slick of a deep tan head. Luscious, rich aromas of roasted espresso beans, dark semi-sweet chocolate, molasses and a faint smokiness waft up from the snifter. The palate is near perfection; syrupy thick and oily with a restrained minimal level of carbonation. This is the mouthfeel all big Imperial style beers should attain. The first sip is a life changing experience. Intense flavors of melted dark chocolate and espresso are initially noted followed by a pleasing molasses/maple syrup/dark fruit sweetness. The finish shows off a subtle presence of the alcohol to warm things up with a late palate appearance of a hefty hop bitterness to cut down the sweetness of the immense malt profile. An amazing, close to perfection beer. One that shouldnt be missed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - The charred malt smell coincides with the smell of portobella mushrooms. As it warms a slight alcohol smell comes out. The smell is opposite of the taste.  T - The taste is very sweet with a burnt character. Then lots of hops kicks in at the end to balance out the sweetness of the dark malts. After it warmed I finally was able to grab a chocolate note at the end of the swallow.  M - The mouthfeel is kind of syrupy especially as the beer warms. It is nice.  D - This beer is quality. Do I want more than one at a sitting? No. For my first venture into imperial stouts, I am happy.  It was pretty cold out of the fridge but as it warmed it developed so much more.

Lots of hops in here. Mouthfeel is thick,smooth, velvetty, richly of chocolate, bitter cocoa, a potent punch of hops and mild, mild carbonation that makes this almost like syrup.

It subsides quickly. The nose is fairly potent. Chocolate and a roastiness are the most noticeable. Some coffee and alcohol come through also. A bit of a sweetness to it also. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and silky: definitely a full bodied beer. The taste seems to be more complex than the aroma. The chocolate is there, but not as strong as I thought it would be. Hints of dark fruits, roastiness are in the taste profile also. Almost no sweetness, and a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste.

S: Plenty of piney hops and roasted/burnt (almost smokey) aroma.  T: Plenty of hop flavour (resiny pine) and bitterness. Plenty of DARK roasted/burnt malt (with a little caramel & molases). There's a little dark-fruit/wine-like quality. The flavour is predominantly bittersweet, with the balanced tipped to the bitter side. Personally, I think Russian Imperial stouts should have more fruity esters & tertiary alcohols.  M: Full body is syrupy, acidic and a little oily. Carbonation is on the lower side of moderate.

Not the greatest thing I'd like to see, but who cares.  S - Dark malts. Chocolate, some molasses, some smoke. It's pretty good but not really strong.  T - Threre is some gummy paper and some alcohol. These are encompassed by the afforementioned flavors of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and I guess there is cardboard in there. The after taste reminds me of cigarette butts.  M - Thick, and chewy. there is no carbination to speak of and there is some bitterness at the end.  D - It is a little heavy , not a session beer.

In all fairness, I almost need to go back through my reviews and adjust any other stout ratings using this beer as the standard. Whew, what a sampling this turned out to be.  Pours a brownish-black with a mocha-brown head, very sticky creamy lace that ain't goin' nowhere! The aroma nearly qualifies as tasting it, it's that intense. Sweet espresso, heavily roasted malts, you can smell that much without trying. The look and smell absolutely give away what you're about to experience, no punches pulled.  The taste is Jurassic, nothing less. Huge, bold, dark roasted malts and espresso, coated with a sweet syrupiness. The taste kind of evolves into a bitter chocolate and charcoal finish completely off the scale.  The beer coats the mouth and is in no hurry to clear out. You can just sit and savor for a minute between each sip. High alcohol, for sure, but you won't need many of these to make it through the night.  I split one of these 3 ways, if I have one just to myself it will take an hour or more, there's just so much flavor, you dare not rush it and short circuit any taste along the way. Thank you, Kalamazoo!  *** Aged another 2 1/2 years to see what happens...  Appearance - pours an inky black with a trace of coca cola brown/red at the bottom edge of the glass. Very thick dark mocha bubbles form up a half-finger or so cap, receding to a thin but solid cover. Hasn't lost a step. 5.0  Aroma - the sweet roastiness, the syrupy coffee and espresso and bitter chocolate, what a great aroma. 5.0  Taste - heavy, charred malts, sweetness and bitter espresso bean. A touch of soy somewhere from mid-palate to swallow, followed by much charcoal and some late hop bitterness. The end tries to regain a little of the sweetness but the bolder side has stepped it up through the rest period and doesn't allow it to develop. Some fleeting bittersweet chocolate as the flavors dissipate, which takes a bit. Very late warming alcohol, often only felt down in the belly. Perhaps experience has tempered my palate or my tastes aren't quite as impressed or maybe the beer's best has waned, I don't know. It's not as memorable but for the smoky, burnt stout lovers out there, give this a shot after two to three years. 4.0  Mouthfeel - incredibly thick, the carbonation has held up well. It's still huge. 5.0  Drinkability - at this point, this is a tasty beer but not one I'd age again. 4.0",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,DarkerTheBetter,4.62,"This beer pours a mysterious midnight black that looks like a void in space itself. The head was a dark copper and tan that started quite small, but then fell to a thin ring, leaving no head what so ever.  Smells of syrupy chocolate and an awesome, dare I say wholesome, roasted barley. There are also swirling bits of dark fruits and a subtle nip of fruity hops. This one just makes me feel good smelling it. Five stars! er, points.  Tastes exceptionally sweet, but the sweetness is clearly natural and wholesome. This emanates from the smooth dry roasted barley that isnt too charred (espresso), nor underdone (barley wine), but just right. Bells hit that right on the nose. Theres also some port like qualities with some cherries and a definite brandy, presumably where the alcohol is hiding out of sight.  The mouth feel is thick as hell and sticky with a light easy going carbonation that only adds to the over all thickness.

One of those beers you could just smell forever.  Flavor explodes on my palate with tons of malt goodness, thick and viscous. Bittersweet Belgian chocolate, freshly ground Colombian coffee beans, toasted black bread drizzled with molasses, sweet dark fruit, prunes, raisins, melted brown sugar and more. There are hints of charred wood smoke and a perfect hop finish that is green and piney. As it warms, some sweetness emerges, but not cloying or obtrusive.

Taste is rich and complex, characterized mostly of chocolatly malts, coffee, undertones of roasted grain and alcohol, starts sweetly and then finishes off with a slightly bitter bite from the coffee/hop profiles. Hard to believe this brew is packing 11.5% abv somewhere, covers up nicely. Mouthfeel is light carbonation, smooth and creamy, thicker bodied.

A minimal tan colored head forms and then quickly disappears. No lacing, low carbonation, but an oily coating clings to my glass. Lots of dark fruit smells, raisins and prunes. Hints of burnt coffee and chocolate and roasted malts. Taste mimics the smell, but heavy on the burnt coffee and chocolate then fades with some hop bitterness. Slight alcohol burn in the belly. Lots of aftertaste. Creamy, smooth, medium bodied feel. Hard to drink more than one, especially with an abv of 11.5%. If your a fan of Russian Imperial Stouts its a must try.

287,1444,zjungleist,4.27,"Batch #6811. Pours pretty much pitch black with a small tan head. I can tell just by looking how thick this stuff is. Actually, at first, there was no head, and slowly one bubbled up from the inky depths. The smell is great, with boatloads of bakers chocolate and a nice sharp, green hop smell. The taste is not perfect though, it was really really sweet. It started with pretty much perfect hops, and then immediately became very sweet. I would say the sweetness overpowered what would be the peak flavors, but then mellowed with some great chocolate and cream flavors and a lingering coffee aftertaste. But seriously, this stuff is sweet. Maybe with a little bit of age that would mellow. I'll probably cellar the bulk of what I have. I wish there were dates instead of batch numbers, but I'll wing it. The mouthfeel was pretty thick, and though there was a bit of carbonation that could be summonsed with a good swirl, it was a bit off balance in the respect. So.. flavor and mouthfeel are both a bit off balance, yet it was quite enjoyable and complex.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,unclederby,4.85,"Batch 6811  So i'm gonna go ahead and say it now, this is absolutely one of the best beers i've ever tasted.  The pour was an opaque pitch black topped by a smallish mocha-colred head which dissapated quickly. Impossible by sight to guess if there is any carbonation activity.  Smell is sweet, dominated by smoke and chocolate, wheat toast and with the faintest hint of hops.  And the taste! Rich with flavours of milk chocolate, roasted malts, hazelnuts, coffee and the slightest hint of hop bitterness on the finish. How the hell did i get all of this? I would never know this is 11.5 ABV.  What superb flavors!  I'm drinking too fast...  Mouthfeel to me is perfect for a double stout, thick and chewy, smooth and creamy... just a bit slick and oily. Who needs carbonation?  Drinkability? Give me another... but just one more. Not because it's harsh on the palate but just the opposite; it's delicious and very rich and quite filling.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,RedHaze,4.4,"For some reason there's no batch #, but I know it was bottled in 2004.  Pours absulutely pitch black with a very thin dark brown head, that quickly fades to a very thin ring that leaves only bits of lacing.  Smell; at first there was a little bit of a soy sauce aroma going on, but that disappeared after I let it sit for a few minutes. I smell dark roasted choclate malts, slight coffee presence and some anise.  Taste; wow, those roasted choclate malts really hit right up front, with a little bit of the cooffee blanded in. There's a slight bitterness for the hops, but those are somewhat subdued due to some age. I get a little bit of a vinous and molasses flavors as this warms, with a little bit of an alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but smooth for the the style. I don't think I would be able to drink more than one of these in a night without drooling all over myself..",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ghostwalker,4.33,"12 oz. bottle serving.  Body is black hole, bottom of a well, midnight in a coal mine black. One finger of dark brown head. Beautiful!  Nose is rich and boozy.  Flavor is deep, dark, roasted malt. Dark fruits are present, prunes, plums, currants. Not much coffee or chocolate. More of a extra roasted, almost burned maltiness. Piney hops also are present in strength. Overall, this kind of reminds me of Great Divide's Yeti. Boozy, I can taste the alcohol, and there is a definite warming effect.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy and oily. You really know you are drinking an RIS with this bad boy. Top marks!  Drinkability is OK. It's really good, but also really strong and intense. One will do me for now.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bruachan,4.25,"i didn't know motor oil was so delicious. huge mouthfeel that contains toffee and chocolate, velvety all the while. bitterness stems an otherwise very sweet finish. and there's a cola character there at the end too, along with a very slight aged flavor. esters are not pronounced, but detectable  bitter chocolate and licorice aroma. i might be getting a touch of hop  compared to the speedway stout i tried last night this is fairly tame, but balance can be a virtue amongst the imperials as well",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nose is full of dates, chocolate, coffee, currants, & a wee bit of alcohol.  Nice. Well balanced blend of sweet malt, coffee & chocolate. Dark fruit flavours move in & out freely. Agressive hopping - grapefruit & pine. Off dry finish. Smooth, full bodied. Gentle carbonation. Well put together.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,kohoutek,4.77,"Dark as the darkest night with a nice brown head. The foam quickly dissipates into an oil drop experiment of xylem cells and migrating plasmodium.  The beer smells of dark fruits, plums, slivovicz, cherry pits and currants. A good swirling reveals smoky roasts with layers of complexity, herbal hops, fruity acidity and chocolatey/espresso warmth. This beer is heavily ester laden. These aromas are beautifully integrated into this complex, rich beer.  The flavors are winey/vinous and maltiliciously acidic, all wrapped in a roasty, fruity, chocolately/caramel blanket.  The mouthfeel is rich, medium-thick. It is enhanced by the lively acidity, hop bitterness and low carbonation.  I have enjoyed up to four expeditions in a row (lots of time in between) and they are very drinkable.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ToggleEyes,4.35,"It poured out thick and black and settled with a tiny head that disappeared fast. The color is quite black, but around the top it looks like the brown is sepparating from the black. The smell is intoxicationg with coffee, dark chocolate, mollases, malt, small bits of alcohol, toffee and raisin maybe? There is a lot going on with this one if you take the time to really ""waft it in"". The taste is awsome. Creamy and smooth, sweet and not overly bitter. This is great in a stout this way you can bare to let it sit in your mouth for a while and find all the flavors. Has a great aftertaste that has some burn and punch to it. I think I have found my measuring stick when it comes to Imperial Stouts.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jaluria,4.43,"So dark in color it's difficult to identify anything else within this beer. A slight head with a mocha-color that stays around for awhile. I could smell nuts, chocolate, coffee beans, and roasted sugar; somewhat expected for this style, but still appealing. The taste was just incredible with a richness in flavor and texture that makes it one of the best RIS around. Smooth and creamy from the first sip to the last drop. The sweetness is never so dominant it takes away from the beer or blows out your taste buds. The drinkability is excellent in terms of whether or not I would want another pint, but the double digit ABV prevents me from having more than 1 of these beers.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,hero27,4.85,"Deep rich chocolate color with an extremely creamy head. Aroma is rich chocolate, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, etc. Tastes are incredible and mirror the smells, but with an added complexity of burnt malts and a brutally bitter character as well. Amazing..this exceeded the hype for me, and then some. The mouthfeel is endlessly smooth & creamy.. The alcohol shows itself perfectly, and compliments the other flavors exceptionally well. Mindblowing drinkability for a nearly 12% alcohol beer. Definitely one of the best stouts I've ever had..nearly flawless.  A top-notch offering from Bell's.

Medium heavy body with a oily mouthfeel. Rich taste of dark chocolate truffles, expresso, and plums with a slight hint of alcohol. A cloying finish has that expresso taste to it. One of the best stouts brewed these days. Excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ncbrewerbun,4.45,"From a brown 12 oz. bottle.  This is approaching extreme beer status. The appearance is black -- an opaque black, jet black with a thin tan head.  Complex aroma -- the malt, yes...dark fruits, molasses, chocolate. An all around imperial aroma.  A big hit of malt, but balanced. The alcohol is subdued. And one thing that set this apart from some of the other stouts we were tasting as the same time was this beer's relative smoothness. It is not harsh and overly bitter.  Chewy. You know you are drinking a big beer.  You have to appreciate this beer like you would a work of art. It's complex, flavorful and an enjoyable experience! Happy Holidays. Have another!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,SupaCelt,4.05,"Murky and dark brown. Minimal head from a conservative pour. Fears of overflow quelled. Small bubbles carbonate. Chocolate coloured ring is substituted for head. Smells of chocolate syrup and coffee, licorice and some fruitiness, and slight alcoholic impressions. The flavours are mostly a bitter chocolate and coffee bean experience. The body is creamy and smooth. This is at least a 9 on Bob's smoothness scale. The drinkability is good in terms of the style. Too much stout can cause pain and chocolate brown dookie.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,TheBlackMallard,4.17,"Poured an oily black. The tan head grew out of nowhere and quickly disappeared. Smells of sugar, coffee, dates. Tastes of sweet roasted mocha coffee. The aftertaste starts bitter and quickly gives way to sweetness. Thick creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth, but I think one is enough for me.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,nlmartin,3.72,Poured from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer poured almost straight black. The head was a very nice creamy coffee color. The only problem the head was dead on arrival. The beer has a dotting pattern of lacing down the glass.  Smell: Sweet carmelly fruity chocolatey coffee assault my nose. Rum soaked raisons make up the fruity smell.  Taste: The beer comes on with a spicy peppery sweetness. Then waves of chocolate and coffee do there thing.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy with almost no carbonation. I think carbonation would have helped the flavors explode from the glass.  Drinkability: This beer would have been far more drinkable with a little more carbonation.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Shultzerdugen,4.88,"12 oz. brown bottle.  Pours inky black/brown capped by a large tan head with dark brown threads though it. As the beer went down in the glass it left small globules of chunky goodness.  Aroma is dark chocolate, espresso, molasses, vanilla, and a hint of raisins.  The body is full to the extreme, but still creamy from carbonation and the ample head. Roasted malts come right out front, followed by a juicy center, finished with coffee and dark chocolate notes carried through from the nose and a molasses sweetness . Alcohol is superbly hidden.  I savored a six pack I bought in March for nine months, and the beer seemed to hold its character brilliantly. So damned good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,budsboy,4.58,"Pours thick, opaque onyx black. Cascading head grows slowly to a two-finger thick layer of rocky, poofy tan foam.  Smell is deep and rich -- coffee, chocolate, raisen, roasted bread, oak and alcohol.  Taste is every bit as good as the smell. Tart, almost sour plum quickly changes to a deep and rich dark chocolate, then burnt espresso and a grainy bread. Finish is thick black coffee bitterness that sticks around. Fantastic.  Smooth and silky. Full bodied. Chewy. This is a meal. You know you've got something special when this hits the tongue.  Exceptional brew. Bigger than many Russian imperial stouts. If anything, this feels more like an American double stout to me, mostly because of its size and fullness. The last two Bell's I've had are the 7000 and this. I'm convinced ... nobody does big stouts better than Bell's. Good, good, good.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,phishgator,4.69,"Vintage 2002 This pours into and Imperial pint glass with large clunks and chugs. A thick brownish black (liquid?) with a decent head for such a big brew. Thought the head does receed in just a short time. The aroma is of perfection for an Imp. Stout, roasted coffee and dark bitter choclate. The taste is every bit the same as the aroma but with a bit of heat from the alcohol! There is also a strong bitter presence. The mouthfeel is thick and coating, as it should be. The drinkability is out of this world. I always want more after I finish the first one; although I'm not too sure that I should have another?!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,MuddyFeet,4.63,"I am completely fascinated with the beer. Thank you so much to CRJMellor for this bottle.  Poured an incredibly deep brown in color. Slight head that was slightly tinted brown. Not much lace, but what the lace that was tere was in the form of a spotty and stringy hybrid. Nose was a very, very dark chocolate and almost as if I stuck my head into a fireplace where the flu was a bit dirty.  Wow! What can I say about the flavor. Knocked me over and left me sippign this beer as if it were the nectar of life. It was full of coffee. but not a dark or even mild roast. It was more of a flavored coffee. Little bits of mocha and hazelnut coffee. Not so much as choclate as flavored coffee. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich. Very smotth drinking--even for such a high ABV. So tough to put the glass down.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,HopHeadKen,4.32,"I have been drinking Expedition for over a year. It is time to tell others how nice this beer is ! (BTW- Stouts are my favorite, Imperial, Double, Oatmeal, etc)  Pours deep mahogony black with rich garnet highlights at the edge, develops a creamy tan head, fine bubbles that takes several minutes to fade to an edge ring.  Smell is big toasty caramel malt over a hop backbone with a faint smell of alcohol.  Taste is rich, chocolate, coffee, toasted grains and caramel, followed by a well balanced big hop bitterness and then a slpash of alcohol.  Full rich mouthfeel that finished with a subtle alcohol bite (I find this a good characteristic), viscous and substantial.  Drinkable - Imperial Stouts are an acquired taste.

Lots of sweet dark fruits including raisins and currants. Some light chocolate comes through as well. Flavor is loaded with dark toasted malts followed by a sweet caramel body. The alcohol presents an overall sweetness adding possibly a touch of vanilla. Alcohol isn't really overwhelming, definately blended with the flavor in a tasty fashion.  Mouthfeel is oily and creamy on the tongue. Coats well and lingers for quite a while. Dangerously drinkable. Probably one of the most drinkable brews I""ve had with this much alcohol.

The aroma is of chocolate, cream, crackers, butter, with Bell's house aroma peaking slightly though. The taste is chocolate, and club crackers, with some really nice bitterness in the finish. The bitterness slowly fades during the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout; full bodied with just enough carbonation to make things interesting.

287,1444,connecticutpoet,4.56,"This beer poured into my chalice a clear, almost opaque brown-black with a thin layer of head that disappeared immediately.  The aroma was stangely faint... slightly sweet, some alcohol, no roasted character at all. And I served it at a little above cellar temperature.  This did NOT carry through to the flavor. It was not sweet at all... I got MASSIVE roasted barley, which faded to a coffee aftertaste. DAMN this was powerful. But 11.5%? Where? Sure as hell didn't taste like it. Very deceptive.  Mouthfeel was wonderful... thick, chewy, and it coated the tongue.  Drinkability... very good, but the flavor was so strong and powerful that I couldn't give it a perfect rating. I could only have one of these and I would have my fill. I would gladly go back to it, however.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Frozensoul327,4.63,"Yes. This is a good beer. Solid, heavy, thick, powerful. Quite possibly the ultimate winter brew. Poured out to a pitch black color with a motor oil level of thickness. Very high viscosity. Lower carbonation, but a nice dense brown head arose from the beer totaling about 3/4 of an inch, and remained consistant. Aromas of chocolatey malts, roasted coffee, earth and soft wood notes. Very appealing. Taste was direct and filling. Flavors of dark turkish coffee, cocoa, heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate and burnt molassas. Amazing, and worthy of the exceptional designation. Mouthfeel was thick and chewy, while still having a smooth and creamy element to it. Very hearty. A good level of drinkability, this brew's 11.5% ABV is hardly detectable, which could mean trouble for those with a six pack on hand and a low level of moderation ability. An amazing brew, and worth the price. The best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had.

I am immediately amazed and slightly worried by the smell--this thing is probably going to taste too boozy and vinous for me but maybe not...  Taste is of dark malts, caramel, licorice with some cherries and other fruits, nuts--almonds, raisins, etc. I can tell this will improve as it warms. It finishes fairly clean but does have a little bourbon-esque burn in the throat after. It is also a bit too flat in mouthfeel. I've had better imperial stouts.

There seems to be little to no lacing on the glass as the beer is consumed.  Sticking my nose into the glass, I detect a bit of chocolate and a lot of alcohol.  The beer tastes pretty good: coffee, a hint of chocolate, and a malty sweetness. It also has quite a bit of alcoholic spiciness, which doesn't bother me since when I'm not drinking beer, I enjoy Scotch neat. I could see the alcoholic nature of this beer being off putting to many people, though.  The mouthfeel is good--low carbonation and a nice, thick body.

Smell: Large, fabulous aroma of chocolate, coffee, malts, molasses and light buttery herbs.  Taste: Big, thick malts, bitter coffee, cheery, and soy sauce (I know, it sounds odd and the last time I tasted soy sauce in a beer it was a homebrew gone wrong, but its good in this flavor). The finish is sweet and very long in duration.  Mouthfeel: Full body, thick chewy texture, no carbonation.  Drinkability: My was this wonderful.

Holdng this one up to the light, I'm seeing nothing. VERY dark...OK, wait...there's a little ruby fringe...Nothing like a really black beer. :)  It smells like the first beer I ever made....very heavy and thick dark molasses aroma, with a hoppy nose under. There's even a *slight* hint of cedar in there.. It's very nice.  Wow....sweet and smoky all at the same time. Nice pungency on this. There's definitely a boatload of roasted malt there...and the alcohol is not overly apparent, but is there, particulary on the end and the aftertaste. There's a great chocolatey quality right in the middle. The hops are there, but aren't overbearing or distracting.  This one isn't too thick or 'gritty' as sme stouts have been. It's definitley 40-weight, but is very smooth. You don't feel you need a hammer and chisel to serve this one.  Yowsa. Shake your groove thing. Get down, and then get back up again.

287,1444,waldowin,4.68,"Got this beer in a trade that resulted in a *lot* of wonderful already-cellared beers, and I suspect this one was cellared for a while as well, as the carbonation was almost non-existant, and the hops had faded back to a nice compliment to the main tastes.  Appearance - If I saw the oil in my car this color, I'd assume the car was toast. In a beer though, it's glorious. It's a rare treat to see such a dark beer, especially one so viscous. The beer in the glass literally folded around the beer pouring from the bottle. Almost no head, just a thin layer of very dark brown foam that subsided to a ring quickly, but then stuck around forever. Inky black. No light gets through, not even at the edges. This brew sucks ambient light in, darkening a room as soon as the cap is popped. With a better head, this would be the ideal appearance. I suspect this has been aged however, hindering that, so I'm only knocking off a half.  Smell - Thick, thick smell, if that makes any sense. Very faint. Biscuits, cherries and coffee.  When cold, it's an extremely smooth, slightly sweet syrup that rolls along the tongue. Chewy, smooth, and with a nice tingle of carbonation at the end. Like a black coffee with a maraschino cherry bobbing in it. Delicious. It's hard to wait for this to warm up.  Now that it's warm, a strong dough-like flavor is coming through, with some cinnamon and brown sugar. Amazingly thick and big in feel and flavor. Almost too much for my tastebuds to take, with all this biscuit, cherry, raisin, cinnamon and coffee goodness. Definitely heartburn material.  This is probably on of the best examples of a RIS I've had to date. If only we had stouts like this in my state, I'd never have to trade to find them.

Of course I'm not testing this on my VW. Beautifully cascading head cascade FOREVER! Finally settles to three fingers of barely moving thick creamy brown foam. It looks like it will aslt forever, to the point of needing scooped off so I can drink this already! (not likely) Oh well, this will give the brew time to warm I guess, as I'm sure it needs to be warmer than my fridge! You could give the earth a solar eclips if you could put this beer inbetween you and the sun.  Ok I'm back, I let the head die a while while I took care of other business. 8"" away from this beast I can smell toasty biscuity malt. As I get closer the toasty quickly changes to extremely dark roasted bitter malt.  Now take this taste rating with a grain of salt, as I'm not a huge stout fan, I'm just starting to like them. Well this beast is the extreme stout and should probably have not been one of my first stout experiments since gaining a taste for them. This thing is way bitter with dark roasted malt. Did they intentionally burn the malt? Quickly coffee bitterness steps in to stomp on my tastebuds to make room for the extremely sweet syrupy malt. Next up is the resinous, oily, sappy hops. Not like it needs to be more bitter. Bitter malt and slightly hoppy aftertaste.  It feels like motor oil in the mouth to, maybe 5W-20 as it's not as thick as 10W-30 (yes I do know what 10W-30 feels like in my mouth. Don't ask.)  Respectable, but way too big for me.

287,1444,Oktoberfest,2.87,"My wife said motor oil as I poured a bottle into our newest pilsner. Her father, an avowed Busch Light drinker, calls all the craft beers we drink motor oil. At last, though, the name is accurate.  Its dark. REAL dark. A searchlight wouldnt cut through it. The text printed on the back of the pilsner is completely illegible.  The smell is mostly coffee, layered with alcohol. I dont detect much chocolate from the odor, or its overcome by the alcohol smell.  My wife tried a sip after saying she wouldnt like it. She did like it, it turned out, but she added that she couldnt drink much more. She also said it needed to warm up.  Its a RIS so its a big beer and goes down very warm. Im guessing its last years stock since we bought a single bottle just last week. Virtually no head save a few stings of bubbles clinging to the glass. Bitter, coffee tasting with touches of raisin and very light hints of chocolate. Unlike some other Russian Stouts Ive had, the prevailing taste seems to be the alcohol itself. It tends to crowd out the other tastes, leaving the usual complexities of a stout left to muddle around with one another until none of them come to the fore.  They were speaking of this beer in hushed tones at the Dayton Alefest last week but I wonder if thats for the $14.99 sticker shock than the actual taste. Its not bad at all. But for Bells and for fifteen bucks I expected better.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells like a mix between soy sauce and worcestershire. Meaty with nodes of cheese and roated malt. This beer is going to be a meal.  Tastes like a good smoked porter, only without the smoke and with a tart alchol zip. Meat and potatoes upfron, salt and bread in the back.

287,1444,therica,4.3,"We happened to be in Kalamazoo for a few days, and Bell's was recommended, so we tracked down the brew-pup and brewery-store - WHAT A HASSLE! After an hour of driving in circles, stopping and asking people on the streets (EVERYONE seemed to know where it was but were useless in giving helpful directions), we finally succeeded. There wasn't enough time to stay for the pub, but we hit the store and bought a few cases-- including a case of Expedition Stout.  We'd been told that ""it's supposed to be the best stout ever made,"" by our referrer. Well, it's a lot like Guinness, in my own personal experience and of others as well-- but better, that's our consensus.  The clerk at the store said that the Expedition Stout is 12%, versus their Kalamazoo Stout at 6% or so.  Most of the Bell's that we tried are far too hop-ish for any of us-- except the Expedition Stout. Drink some and enjoy.  === 11 months later update-- I found a neglected bottle buried in the refrigerator. I poured it-- and it was like thin chocolate-syrup coming out of the bottle. The taste was okay for a while, although a lot more liquor-tasting than when it was fresher. The mug sat for a while and when I went to take another sip, it was like paint-thinner with plenty of paint-residue mixed through it. If this were the first try of this stout, I'd rate it far lower-- but given the circumstances, I simply thought I'd add my 11-month followup on what happens with this, after some aging.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,jakester,4.87,"I got this as a single from Union Jack's on the Manatawny. No date on the label, but it won't matter with this.  This looks like used motor oil when you pour it. Black and thick and opaque. A one finger head of brown foam forms on top, eventually dropping to a ring and a few islands. Lacing throughout.  This just smells so fantastic. Deep, dark chocolate, mocha coffee, dried prunes and dates, very fruity and aromatic. Herbal/grassy hops, and just a hint of alcohol. Wonderful!  OMG, my mouth is so full of flavors...Super rich mocha, ultra dark chocolate cake, like a coffee milkshake. The huge malt presence is expertly balanced by a perfect amount of bittering. Chocolate covered dates, molasses, with a touch of alcohol at the end. Hard to believe this is 11.5%. Roasted barley flavor is cleverly muted by everything else. WOW! Aftertaste is a very long warm molasses flavor.  Mouthfeel is unbelieveably rich, creamy and smooth. This must age for a long time. Big sweetness, but not even slightly cloying. Lips stick together from sugars. Nice little tug at the back of your throat from bitterness. Finish is long, dark, and sweet.  I don't remember having an RIS this good.

Expedition pours a deep, dark, inscrutable black, impenetrable as a nun, with almsot no head. I think Bell's has solved the oil crisis.  Smells sweet, like vanilla and prunes. There may be some coffee there, but next to the Java Stout, who could ever tell?  Tastes sweet and syrupy, anise and prunes and some nice bitterness at the end. It's good, but I just prefer the Java Stout and its intense coffee flavor to the sweet/sour dark fruit characteristics of this Russian imperial stout. Does have a nice mouthfeel, chewy and juicy.

287,1444,rxmaster,4.26,"Appearance - Dark, almost black body with very large and thick dark tan or cappucino colored head. The head reminds me of what you get when you wash oily hands with pumice soap at a garage. A nice lacing was left all the way down the glass after the drink was consumed.  Smell - Burnt coffee and bitter chocolate mix with a light smell of alcohol, hinting at the treat to come.  Taste - Slightly sweet beginning with roasted malts and grains predominating, followed by hops, burnt coffee and alcohol flavor at the end  Mouthfeel - Thick, much the same as it's appearance. Slight tingling and bitterness from the hops.  Drinkability - I wouldn't go to the bar and drink a few of these in a row, but these would be perfect for the occasional treat to a truly world class brew or with steaks on the grill.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BEERchitect,4.55,"Do large stouts get any more classy than this? Bell's makes it look easy as they layer the taste of roast, chocolate, alcohol, and fruit onto a succulent and savory base that seduces the palate at every turn.  The onyx-black ale arrives at the bar with a stern, disciplined, and masculine appearance. It's depth of clarity gives the beer a mirror-like sheen although it's black color makes it opaque. A mocha-stained head caps the beer with a blanket of foam that easily retains the session and laces the glass with confidence. Even a gentle swirl of the glass leaves brandy-like shiny legs clinging to the glass.  High roast, light smoke, and cocoa-rich chocolates overwhelm the nose with a backing of rum and bourbon booze that reveal notes of toffee and molasses. Underlying fruit aromas of red grape, cherry, and blackberry seem to carry a charred character and create a mouthwatering effect heading into the first sip.  Notions of chocolate wrapped espresso beans come to mind as the sweeter malts coat the front of the tongue and palate with its malty richness. Slightly scorched molasses allows for a rich and savory taste to rise at middle palate. This is the point where espresso roast, bittersweet chocolate, and charred dark fruit weave together for a complex but pleasantly rounded taste. Bold however, the taste is further complemented by piney and citrusy hops that assist the roast bitterness to finish. Cherry flavored alcohols and walnut oils all integrate into taste and continue the varying tastes that unveil themselves as the beer warms.  And with its marshmallowy texture, the enormous malt complexes provide a nearly chewy body to start. This silky and succulent texture keeps the beer's flavor squarely focused on the taste buds. But a patient transition to semi-dry maltiness is rewarded in finish as the beer's alcohols act like port wine and fine cognac to signal closure. It's extended roasty bitterness melds seamlessly with the next sip.  Bell's Expedition is a world-class stout, by which all others could be measured. I'm not sure if it is perfect at any one attribute, but it's near that on all. Plus there's several complexities that go above and beyond what the style prescribes. It pairs well with rich foods like honey-dripped dates, smoky bacon, and well aged gruyere.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Morris729,4.87,"Ive been aging this one for some time but cant bring myself to wait any longer. Pours a thick-as-motor-oil deep black ruby color with a very creamy brown head that continues to grow taller as the beer sits for quite some time before it eventually reverses direction and starts to recede. The nose is quite rich with notes of estery alcohol, dark cherries, roasted coffee beans, and unsweetened chocolate. The aromas continue to grow stronger and develop more complexity as the beer warms. Full-bodied, thick, and creamy in texture. Taste begins with sweet roasted malts, dark toffee, and molasses followed by some rather intense notes of burnt coffee that balance out the initial sweetness. Next up are some spicy bitter hops and a bit of smoky charcoal towards the finish. The smokiness remains in a lasting aftertaste on the back of the throat.

This quickly dissipates to a thin ring which stays around the edge of the beer. It appears to be black, but when held in the light at the proper angle, one can see that it is dark ruby in color.  The nose is very complex. It is roasty and has a vinous quality. I detect just a slight licorice aroma. The nose is very well blended. The taste does not disappoint either. There is coffee, licorice, port wine, and others I am sure. Beneath all of this, I detect me some hops. There is absolutely no hint at the 11.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is great. It is thick and chewy, but is not syrupy. As I am writing this review, the quality of this beer is starting to sink in. The drinkability is high, especially with the way the alcohol is masked.

It has a remarkable flavor evolution too, moving from hops, to dark fruit, to alcohol, and finally to the dark-roasted coffee, nut, and dark chocolate. Its also insanely heavy in the mouth.

Heavy body, chewy and viscous, low carbonation, with the texture of heavy cream. Afterwards, I poured the dregs into my glass.

Starts creamy with sweet molasses and then the mishmash of hops and cough cyrup kicks in. Finish is somewhat thin, bitter without either a bite or pleasant hoppiness.

287,1444,karst,4.9,"The vintage port of American stout. Suited for November storms on Lake Michigan when your shipload of Edmund Fitzgerald goes down and trips across Indianna only to find Dark Lord missing.  I stare at an empty pint glass with lace on the far side and a gelatinous mucus on the near side and a bottom covering of crankcase drippings. This ""sleeper"" is packaged with little fanfare (no red wax or other B.S.) I pull one of the 6 bottles that were refrigeratered at Brown Derby # 24 AKA ""Party Central"" and pour its coal lumpy contents out of its 12 oz bottle.  A vigorous pour yields an excellent Stout head of one finger that is foamy and chocolate brown. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate dark roasted coffee and nearly burnt molasses arise as the head slowly becomes a covering of thinner frouth. Flaovrs abound and offer up more bittersweet choc. coffee molasses along with burnt wood and roasted malt and dark fruits. Knowing I will adjust to its huge flavors, I settle in to enjoy a super heavy weight body with a true chewy Mouthfeel. The drying bitterness of the finish and all those dark roasted flavors clinging as an aftertaste are outstanding.  Viscosity finally drops back into the liquid state as the CO2 drops with about a third of the pour remaining. Thick, gellatious material stays near the bottom.

Aroma mainly dominated by roasted malt with some subtle coffee and chocolate notes. The roasted malt dominates taste at first and then chocolate and coffee are also easily identifiable. Creamy texture makes this even more enjoyable. It all ends with some well balance bitterness. Body is incredibly full and there is even quite a lot of sediment at the bottom of my glass.

Total dark chocolate fills the nose w/ the slightest sense of alcohol. Some coffee in there, along with caramel and malt. The taste if huge...tastes like mocha ice cream, which I dig. Huge malt blast w/ even some hop sweetness in the finish. I even detect just a hint of smoked flavor in there. Not at all bitter and very smooth in its mouthfeel. The alcohol is more apparent in the taste, but it is still so subtle for its ABV%. I must agree w/ the majority on this one...one of the best RIS's I have had to date.

287,1444,NearerMyBeerToMe,3.88,"Labelled with the number ""6672,"" although I don't know what that represents. Pours coffee black and raises a tight, dirty sienna head about 1/4 inch deep. When swirled, the head leaves a pleasant, melting cling on the sides of the glass, but overall this is not as visually robust (read: gloopy) than some of the others in its style. Aroma is mostly dark chocolate with hints of vanilla extract, finishing with well-integrated touch of alcohol. Nosefeel could benefit from either a fuller body or an added dimension of bitterness; right now it just feels like sniffing at a glass of chocolate milk. Flavor begins with sweetness of raisin jelly, shifts to baking chocolate and finishes bitter and charred. As a whole, it tastes good in an unconventional way, like caramelized onions that got left too long in an iron skillet and burned. Mouthfeel is admirably smooth with a very slight carbonation and no twangy bitterness; but again, more viscosity would be welcome.

I swirled the last few ounces around in my snifter for what seemed like hours, and almost couldn't bear to end the aromatic romance by drinking it. Outstanding. The flavor outdoes the nose!

Faint hints of the high alcohol. Lots of roasty smells.  Taste: Bitter chocolate and bitter espresso. Lots of hops. Rather creamy mouthfeel. Bitter roasty flavors linger on the tongue.

Excellent lacing. Note: I don't deduct for bad labels, which is a good thing. Awful bland package considering the contents.  Deep roasty nose of dark chocolate, expresso, and licorice.  Each taste explodes across the tongue, a deep roasted surge of darkness: chocolate and coffee, dark fruits, with a sharp hop snap, and a small burst of alcoholic warming.

287,1444,orbitalr0x,4.9,"Ahhh...another Russian Imperial Stout that I have been longing after....pours from the bottle amazingly thick and syrupy, like I just let the old oil flow while I was doing an oil change on my car. A nice creamy dark tan head develops and then slowly fades to a ring with spotty lacing on the glass. I think this brew actually absorbs light. Awesome. First smell brings intensly rich, dark chocolate, molasses, roasted/toasted malts, hints of coffee with a heaping helping of dark fruits..a bit vinous. Fucking decadent...a punch in the nose...the aromas coming off this brew are big and in your face....killer.  First sip brings a tidal wave of roasted, slightly burnt maltiness upfront along with a nice helping of chocolate, dark molasses, and dark, vinous fruits. I'm getting some good pine hoppy bitterness on the way down along with hints of coffee. Incredibly well put together and a joy to drink. Alcohol is nearly non existant in the taste. Simply an amazing imperial stout.  Mouthfeel is big, thick and creamy. Give this to people who say Guinness is a meal in a glass and watch them shit their pants in astonishment. As for me....this is how I like my Russian Imperial Stout...huge. Obviously...this is not a session brew by any means..but it is an incredibly tasty treat that no one should miss out on.

I also catch a whiff of raisins and caramel. Delightfully thick mouthfeel coats your mouth like cough syrup, and low carbonation does not offer much relief. Quite the big stout feeling - you almost have to chew it. The blend of malts is wonderful - slighty smokey roasted malts are huge in the beginning. Then you notice the dark fruits, I'm thinking cherry and raisin. Then come the glorious hops. Delightfully bitter citrous taste finishes as the stout coats your throat. The aftertaste is a damn near perfect blend of roasted malt and citrous hops, heightened by a warming alcohol taste. Possibly my favorite RIS now.

287,1444,GreenWBush,4.68,"In a chalice, this beer provided me a glimpse of visual beer nirvana. A vigorous pour kicked up a more than healthy stack of satanically dark head and storm-cloud drapery. It meringued a full 2"" above the rim of the glass. Surface tension, meet Larry Bell. Outrageously gorgeous.  The nose of this beer is a car-crash of ridiculously gooey sweetness and a tanker truck of roastiness. Baker's chocolate soaked in boozy fudge.  The taste of this beer is less explosive, and while amazingly viscous it still has a remarkably un-fat mouth cloaking capacity to it. Thin or watery isn't it, but not necessarily what you expect for something so filled (and filling). It has to be experienced.  Bitterness and sweetness have never existed in such harmony on these taste buds before. This beer is everything, oily, gooey, roasty, stupidly sweet, mouth-meltingly stark and chocolately. I can't believe the lack of booze. Best of both overblown worlds? I think so.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gaisgeil,4.37,"Ever wonder what motor oil tastes like? Me either, but that's what this looks like coming from the bottle. Incredibly thick and dark dark black in color with a dark brown head to compliment.  Nose is really expansive, chocolate, coffee, heaps of roast, molasses, grain, a bit of vanilla? The taste is very powerful, the roast flavors are really very prominent, with the coffee and molasses not far behind. The mouthfeel is so very thick and chewy that the taste lingers for quite a while, almost syrup like, I love it!  This is one heavy-duty no playing around sort of stout. It's definatly not for the meek.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,sweethome,4.28,"I've been drinking this for many years now. I've found the quality to be up and down the last few years. This years model:  Black, opaque as ever. So thick. Actually developed a head, which in some years it does not. Big bubbles in the head leave rocky, surface of the moon apperance.  Huge chocolate nose with some roast, and signature hops fighting through.  The thickest mouthfeel I've ever had - always has been and I still wait for the day something thicker comes along. The heft of this beer is amazing. Somewhat overwhelming, even after having it every winter it shocks me with it's depth.  Chocolate off the tip, but hops present right away too. Mid mouth it delivers a bit of a soy sauce flavor - something I noticed in the 2002 version. That really detracts. But hold on, this comes back for so much more. It fills out with lush chocolate and roast. How the hops fight through the huge amount of malt is beyond me. A liquid chocolate bar - decadent. Pour it over vanilla ice cream - it'll hold up.  Over the top and one of a kind.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,silenius,4.83,"Holy Moley!  I really wasn't expecting much from this beer since some other Bell's offerings I find too common.  Appearance: The black hole of beers! I shined a 300W halogen light up to it and could not see a bit of light through the glass! Dark tan espresso crema head that after one year of ageing is still very thick, lively and coats the glass with substantial lacing.  Smell: OHHH! My mom's gingerbread cookies, molasses, dark chocolate and espresso. I could tell this would be good!  Taste: Magnificent dark chocolate, molassess, and espresso. The dark chocolate and espresso linger forever.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. As a beer like this should be.  Drinkability: I can't keep myself from continually taking sip after sip. I think this is my first 5 in drinkability. Excellent, excellent, excellent!!  I will be buying more and more!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ypsifly,4.12,"12oz bottle with no dates.  Yep, pours like you read about: used motor oil at about 160F. I should know, I changed the oil on my truck this morning. I have the used oil in a pan out in the garage. I'm really tempted to go outside and compare the two in a goblet. Small tan head that disappeared quickly, this was after a rather forced pour.  Smells of alcohol, bread, almonds, cocoa, and a hint of hop. There's some roasted aroma, but its rather slight for the style.  Tastes of mollases, roasted malts, chocolate, and a nice mix of alcohol and hops in the finish. The alcohol comes on with a nice warming affect. The full mouthfeel is what one would expect for the style. Feels like a meal in a bottle, without any carbonation.  This beer suffers only in its drinkability. The high abv alone makes it too much for a session beer. I have a few more bottles cellaring and am anticipating this one after a couple years. Once the alc mellows this will be one kick ass impy.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,profzoom,3.56,"This is a bold stout with a thick black color and a gorgeous chocolate milk head. Its high alcohol content is not hidden by its aroma. The sweet malt smell is accompanied by the distinct scent of alcohol. The taste is similar; robust, almost tangy malts which are unable to mask the taste of the alcohol. This is a beer one must definitely sit down and experience. It's not for relaxing or shooting the breeze. Like many of Bell's beers, it is of high quality but doesn't stand out as something exceptional.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Fish113d,4.47,"Served from a bottle into a pint, this poured a very dark ""black"" color with some ruby tints when held into the light at the surface, but not much light got through the glass. No head at all on a rather gentle pour. Aromas are of some roasted malts with hints of chocolate and some earthy hops in there. Nicely balanced aromas and nothing stood out more than the other. Taking a sip, the roasted malts I tasted right away, but this soon gives way to coffee and chocolate flavors by the swallow w/ a nice sweet caramel finish; pretty darn complex. Little carbonation let the flavors burst onto my palete, and the smoothness was incredible! Overall, I would drink this all day if I could, or until I fell over in a drunken stooper! Great brew!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jlervine,4.22,"Poured used diesel oil black and about as thick. Copper head tried really hard to stay put, but succumbed very quickly. Wonderful coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt flavors swirl in a mist of earthy medicinal hop bitterness. Sure does smell delicious! The first taste just totally sucker punches your mouth. Numbing alcohol and tingling carbonation (hey, guess there WAS some in there after all!) set the stage for a toffee and mocha orgy on the tongue. Lots of chocolate and roasted barley in there. Hop bitterness is present but is more or less chaperoning this dance, making sure that the malts and alcohol don't get too close during the slow songs. The mouthfeel is much less thick than I was anticipating. Kinda disappointing, but it's by no means thin. The strong roasted character gives a very noticeable astringency to the finish that makes this beer not very thirst-quenching at all. That's no problem, though, as the mere thought of another sip is mouth-watering enough in its own right. A surprisingly drinkable impy!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,assurbanipaul,3.96,"Pours motor-oil black with ruby highlights, including the darkest, thickest meaty head I've seen. Looks like oatmeal floating on top, settles to a thin ring after a while. Aroma is dark malts, pungent but with a fruity, smokey element.  This is a story of two beers in the same glass: At first, the taste is dark burnt malts, almost charcoal, like the crust on a grilled chicken. Has a vinous element, like a merlot spilled into the batch. Very bitter, almost no sweetness, a little salty. Drinks hot with alcohol, like a barleywine.  But after being interrupted by a phone call and returning to the remainder of the glass, this beer awakens: Traces of coffee, raisins, licorice, baker's cocoa. Still with a prominent alcohol presence but silky smooth on the palate, heavy with no apparent carbonation.  Mouthfeel is thick like flannel, fuzzy and sticky. Initially, I was rather nonplussed by this one but the taste and my impressions and ratings improved greatly as the beer warmed. This is one where the rhetoric is true: you *must* let it warm up to just cool before drinking it. I'd like to try this one again after aging it a bit. Thanks to trbeer for sharing this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,vladtheimpaler,4.48,"12 oz bottle aged 1 year. Deep dark brown with a lasting dark tan head. Real nice aroma of coffee, chocolate (dark), carmel, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol carrying the fragrances up the snifter. Flavor is roasty and smooth, with big chocolate malts and roasted barley bitterness. Big thick palate. Bitterness lingers. This is an ager, for to age gets rid of the hot alcohol burn that is present when young. Should be present en every BA's cellar!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,NeroFiddled,4.77,"Two bottles of Expedition were tasted side by side for this review. One was roughly 6 months to a year old, while the other was around 2 years old. Neither bottle showed any defect, but the 2 year old was remarkably smoother and far more caramelish as some of the roastiness and hop character had softened. Both were quite similar, but the aged bottle was stellar. This scoring for this review is based on the aged bottle, but even if the newer sample had been rated it would have scored almost as high.  A completely opaque black body is capped by a good-sized head of frothy dark tan foam with a slightly reddish tint to it. The alcohol cuts the head a bit, and it dies a slow death; but, surprisingly, it maintains a solid surface covering and the spotty and splashy lacing it leaves is very nice!  The nose is rich and bold, loaded with bittersweet chocolate, some simple, straight-forward graininess, and a whiff of citrusy hops (a little quirky - but it works!); and accentuated by a thin thread of dark fruitiness and background whiffs of espresso, dark caramel, nutty toffee, and alcohol. And although it's not overtly complex, simply based on its richness, this is a beer that could be enjoyed based on just the nose alone - although the temptation to partake of its flavors would be too great for any man to resist!  In the mouth it's exceptionally creamy and rich with a very full body and exceptionally fine-bubbled, restrained carbonation that leaves it overtly creamy and velvety smooth! WOW!  The flavor, however, is more full-throttle than that! It's almost too much to comprehend - and yet again, it never goes too far out on a limb in it's complexity. It's succulently rich, but not confusingly diverse. Upfront, rich caramel lathers the palate; followed by a mild slap of fruitiness (apple, very soft prune, figs) and notes of toffee and mocha. It's always slightly awash in alcohol (although it's never agressive); and as it crosses the palate a smear of leafy and grassy hops appears (far more so in the younger version than the 2 year old), ushering in a drying bitterness and some mild licorice flavors. It lingers in the mouth, seemingly forever, not unlike the smoke from a good cigar; an amazing cup of cappuchino; or some caramel-chocolate-coffee-and-liquor-drenched dessert. Again, this is STUNNING! This is an amazing beer to cellar, believe me!!!! Go get some now for next year or the year after!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ahking,4.1,"I was very impressed by the flavor and complexity of this brew. Kalamazoo/Bell's has so many stouts out there right now that I usually just throw up my hands and pick something else. But I ordered this in a bar in Detroit and was glad I did. High alcohol is evident at first sip and this can be a good thing after a snow storm. Pour thick as motor oil. Hints of coffee and chocolate in the nose. Flavor is rich with molasses and brown sugar goodness. Low on carbonation, but this is to be expected for this style. Highly recommeded.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,skybluewater,4.35,"Pours a coal-black color. Smells of coffee beans and maybe a bit of chocolate, as well as some prune. Taste is actually very good. Bitter like espresso, with some chocolate and some fruitiness (rather like chocolate-covered cherries). Mouthfeel is milkshake thick, with almost no alcohol burn.  To be honest, I haven't liked any of the previous Bell's beers I've tried. They just seemed....off to me. As such, I was very reluctant to drop even $2.50 on this bottle. But, with the bitter cold upon us, I was in the mood for an impy, and I had (obviously) never tried this one. I'm glad I did. This is a very good brew. While I like Storm King, Old Raspy, and Yeti a bit more, I'm glad to know that there's one more great imperial available to me!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,kmpitz2,4.16,"This beer pours a jet black color with a quarter inch of brown head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is full of dark fruits, more like a belgian quad to me than an impy stout. The flavor is more roated than the nose would say. There is a bit of dark fruit but a ton of chocolate and big coffee on the finish. The beer is just as thick as could ever be. Maybe even more than the breakfast stout. Drinkability is nice. The thickness and the flavor keep it from being a 5 on drinkability, but this is a damn nice stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,carln26,3.73,"From a bottle (thanks Zac!). It poured a deep black color with virtually no head, and a thin brown lace. Deep roasted malt smell with a backing of caramel and chocolate. The taste is a rosy malt explosion. More chocolate, and a mild alcohol bite. More caramel and a mild hop backing on the finish. That velvet mouth feel I now expect with Bell's. Reasonable drinkability (especially considering the alcohol content).",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Mostly malt in the nose with some hints of alcohol, cocoa, and prunes. After my first taste, all I can think is chewy. The weight of this beer makes me feel like I'm drinking brownie mix. As the beer warms alcohol makes its apearance, along with figs, burnt malt, semi-sweet chocolate, and piney hops. As the beer warms it goes from being sweet to sour and then maybe even to malty (feels like a jam band song). Anyway, quite an interesting RIS and well worth the price.  Gripe: Not knowing the age of this beer blows.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mntlover,4.78,"Pours a black on black with a dark tan head that falls to a ring with clumps of foam floating in the middle, some light spotty lace not bad for 11.5% brew. Aroma is lots roasted malt nutty chocolate mixed with nice expresso and citrus grassy mix of hops brought forth by light alcohol presence. Taste is creamy and dreamy chocolate mixed with some nuts that lasts for a while, Then some bitter coffee like flavors appear and hops pick up on them and add there own bitterness to the coffee and intensify then drop off. Finish is lightly hoppy and sweet at the same time, chocolate flavors reappear at the end. This is a very complex very nice Impy Stout. No real alcohol in the taste, except for hints in the finish, but it does warm the body. Mouthfeel is very full, creamy very nice, almost think you could cut out chunks with a knife. Drinkability is great goes down quick for a big beer finished by the time it took to type down my thoughts. This will be on my list of beers to pick up when I make to a store up north.

A dark brown creamy head of .5 cm foams up and fades to an edge layer rather quickly. Aroma is nice and balanced with a mix of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate and a bit of earthy and grassy hops. First sip reveals a rather thick body and small yet prickly carbonation. Flavor is coffee bitter up front with a hint of grassy hops in the middle and a smooth chocolate finish.

Fabulously complex and perfectly balanced. There's no alcohol there what-so-ever. A huge, grand tasting beer that has to be sipped to be understood. Rich, malty goodness with a great amount of hops finishing off this well-rounded beer. I can't say enough, the best tasting stout I've had to date. Feels nice and chewy in the mouth with a rich, creamy texture that just doesn't quit.  Drinkability and Overall: I didn't think my long-time favorite Storm King could be topped, but goddammit this did it. Bell's totally suprised me with this. If this were more readily available this might be one of the few beers I drink. This is my new desert island beer. As close to perfection in a stout as you can get.

287,1444,rajendra82,4.3,"Arriving as a part of a trade from clvand0, this beer was in an ordinary looking brown 12 oz. bottle. Once the cap was popped the word ordinary left my vocabulary immediately.  Very thick and viscous with a dark brown body and little to no head to speak of, this was one robust looking drink. The lack of head is understandable given the strength of the beer.  The aroma was roasty and vinous with chocolate, coffee, smoke, raisins, and roasted grains abounding. The taste was mellow and smooth, with flavors of dark chocolate, creamed coffee, toffee, and raisins soaked in brandy. With all the sweet and roasty flavors, the hop bitterness had taken a back seat.  Mouthfeel was thick and tongue numbingly rich. The aftertaste was a bit peppery and alcoholic.  Very nice example of an Imperial Stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Dithyramb,4.02,"Just received via BIF 14. This is my second beer of the eight received. Mad props to Signor CRJMellor for his excellent trade opinions. Presentation was a bottle matching the photo. No freshness or bottling date was evident.  This is the deepest, darkest blackness that Ive seen for some time. Appears to have an oily, thick goodness and it is completely opaque. Only loses points for the lack of carbonation. Initial pour was tepid, with no head. I held back, since my last few stouts were the Love Stout, with its heavy fizziness. Dumped the rest in, the forceful pour left a quarter inched, small bubbled, dark brown head that left quickly. No carbonation or lacing to speak of.  Slightly burnt caramel and roasted coffee aromas. A very diverse mixture of flavors is available. There are some darker roasted malts, with both chocolate and espresso evident. Hops dance around on the finish. ABV warmness creeps in after a nice creamy bodied beverage. Leaves your mouth warm, dry, and slightly acidic. Has the same slight flatness that I recently experienced with the Czar.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BrewMaster,4.37,"Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness markings on it. It pours an impervious black and brown color with no true head on it, just a ring of bubbles around the top.  Smell: Toffee, coffee, soy sauce, uncooked semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Taste: Very rich and roasty from the start with notes of chocolate, roasty coffee, caramel, and burnt oak. The beginning is very sweet and it yields to a bit of hop bitterness towards the middle and the end. As the beer warms there is a sour sweetness that develops. An alcohol warmth sits in the mouth and warms the whole body.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth in the mouth. The bold flavors are delivered well with the smooth texture.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It finishes dry and with a nice burnt coffee dark bitter chocolate that goes on froever. There is an alcohol taste. I can tell it is there, almost overwhelming, it's also warming.  Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied, robust with just the right amount of carbination, I would even call it creamy.  Drinkability would be great but for the abv. The abv. is too noticeable.

Taste is great, dark expresso flavor with heavy amounts of chocolate with a sweet toffee maltyness breaking through and finishing with a suprisingly strong amount of hops that really balance this beer out very well.  Mouthfeel is a thick motor oil like consistancy, seems to run down your throat with the speed of lava, I had to stop and chew a couple times. Plus the ABV lends to a nice fuzzy tongue tingling.

Great retention and chunks of lace left decorating the glass as I consumed this. Aroma is thick with dark chocolate and roasty coffee as well as a touch of fruit and some other unidentifiables. I will have to try and figure out more with my other bottle. The flavor was similar with a strong chocolate taste and notes of roasted malt and espresso. Dark fruits were also in the mix as well as some earthy hops. The finish was a mixed of roasted malts, hop bitterness and a slight alcohol bit.

Chocolate and caramel notes are prominent in an overall sweet, malty aroma. Along with the chocolate and caramel, a coffee flavor dominates this beer. A surprisingly light mouthfeel; slightly bitter on the palate, feels like a light syrup on the back of the mouth/throat, finishes fairly clean. The high ABV of this beer is masked very well, much more so than other strong beers I've had in the past.

287,1444,Rastacouere,4.36,"Pitch black motor-oil when pouring, a mirror to any trace of light adventurous enough to try to get through. Superb chocolate brown 1-inch head, long-lasting and displaying awesome lacing, foamy, sticky like it came nitro-pushed. Very rich malt aroma, satisfyingly bittersweet with tons of molasses, dark belgian chocolate over home-made cookies, dark european bread, torrefied coffee with two creams. Subtle fruitiness (plums, blackberries), just as subtle complementing hops as I love them, piney and obvious hints of smoke. Very complex, but still not overly envelopping in the aroma department. In mouth though, this is a very intense experience, contemplative flavour development with the typical Bells milky aspect although theres almost no sweetness here. Just great smoked chocolate. Multi-dimensional spicy hoppy aftertaste, piney, bitter and very long. Carbonation was much more generous than I was lead to believe from other reviews, its just perfect here and I think Id have enjoyed it less or found it a bit less lively if it hadnt been for a little tongue-cleaning carbonation to entertain such a thick body. Holy Crap, totally dominant monument that I never expected to enjoy all that much and Ill admit liking some sweetness in my beers and not being a fan of hopfests.

Nose is a mix of dark fruits, chocolate & sweetbread. Very nice.  Taste is bittersweet on the front of palate. Just a bit too salty for me. Hints of chocolate are here and make the finish nice.

287,1444,FormatKid,5,"I received this beer as a part of BIF XII and have to admit this was the one I was most excited about. Im glad it made it all the way to me.  The packaging is a standard 12oz bottle and I poured this into my La Trappe goblet. The body of this beer is blacker than blackity-black yall, nothing more can be said. A dense and rather creamy head rolls up impressively especially for a beer of this girth and alcohol content. The head is the color of creamed coffee.  The nose is surprisingly sweet, and inviting. Alongside the standard stout aromas of burnt caramel, dark roasted coffee, and charred malt, I pick up sweeter scents of vanilla, ripe dark fruits, and berry, tons of berry is in the nose on this brew. Further inspection also reveals a sophisticated woody aroma.  First of all this is the thickest beer on the palate I have ever experienced. From the first sip it coats your mouth and just hangs around lovingly not letting you forget the sweet flavor for a second. If you let it sit in your mouth it brings on a milkshake like mouthfeel, youll be spitting black malt residue like youve been chewing tobacco. That being said the flavor is even more elegant and assertive than I would have ever imagined. I taste so many things as I drink it and ponder. Chocolate covered cherries, tons of berries again, bitter bakers chocolate, espresso, and vanilla. The finish of this is a duel between charred malt flavors and stunning hop bitterness so arrogant you almost feel inferior. The alcohol only registers with a slight vinous flavor note and small burn in the back of my throat.  This beer is amazing and has absolutely bowled me over like no beer has yet. I cannot fathom taking points away for anything so here it ismy first perfect score.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bruiser81,4.01,"This beer just looks yummy on the pour. Very dark black, with no light getting through. A huge two finger head that is the darkest creamiest head I've seen yet. Excellent lacing The aroma is nice, mostly dark usweetened chocolate,small amounts of coffee and tons of roasted malt. The flavor is familiar in all the higher quality stouts. Same ones only in different amounts. This one seems to have a major roasted barley thing happening, not overpowering though. Small hints of carmel and coffee same as the smell. A slight kick of hops later towards the finish, just enough. Very creamy full bodied beer Probably wouldn't be able to drink more than two. A delicious beer. I believe I need to thank pheloniousmonk for this trade that was done over a year ago. So this has to have some age on it. Thanks brother.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,oxmasterscream,5,"Poured an opaque dark brown, nearly black, with a small, thick brown head. The aromas this beer gave off were nothing short of mouthwatering... all very desert-like, predominantly raisins and chocolate, with some sweet spices thrown in, but some deeper whiffs revealed smells of a dark raisin cake, oatmeal raisin cookies, even maraschino cherries. Taste was just as huge... obviously, a big malty flavor right off the bat with some cascade hoppiness. The tastes of all things present in the aroma coat your tongue  burnt malts, raisins, chocolate, dark and sour fruits like cherries, baking spices and a slight alcohol burn on the tongue and throat, then a bitter coffee-like finish that is unbelievable. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy like it should be. This is a top-notch Imperial Stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Shaw,4.13,"This beer was part of the second batch of Bell's beer my friend's girlfriend brought down to Florida from her home in Indiana. Thank you Anna and Adam for sharing. And Anna, this elevates you to goddess status in my eyes.  This looks just like an imperial stout should: super black with a dark brown head. It has a roasted smell that competes with malt aromas.  The taste is heavy on roasted flavors and unfermented sugars. It is sweet, but well balanced with bitter flavors. This is one of the more subtle Russian Imperial Stouts I've had. It doesn't knock you over the head like Rogue's. Maybe you could call this the thinking man's imperial stout?  I really like its mouthfeel. It's huge. It's got more back than a Sir Mix-A-Lot song. It's got a better body than Jane Mansfield. It's ... well, you get the point.  This is a drinkable stout, despite the high ABV. Check it out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,StuFox,4.85,This is a beer so dark not even light can escape it's surface. The singularity of stouts. Delicious. The Expedition Stout has a crazy array of spices that are balanced very well against the maltiness. Any thicker and you would spread mustard on it and place ham and cheese between it. My whole dinner never went down so smooth. This is a great beer that all but has to be used as the measuring stick for other stouts of this league.,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,GuinnessSmurf,4.88,"I'm pretty sure that a beer doesn't get any darker than this. This beer looks so good that I fear it - (fear that a 6pk was not enough). A low ring of thick condensed head circles the glass.  The smell is has cocoa malts, alcohol, and scotch.  The taste is amazing - very full bodied. The pallette is massaged with coffee, butter, dark bitter chocolate, toffee and a dark alcohol flavor. Yum.  Drinking this beer is like pounding a pint of super rich icecream. You know that you shouldn't but there is no way you are going to stop short of finishing it.  Every sip was as good as it gets.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,IrishRedRock,4.14,"Thick, viscous and black with a large tan head that quickly drops down to a thin lace. Had to force the head with a very hard pour. Rich chocolatey nose with the pungent cascades shining through. The alcohol is very very well hidden in both aroma and flavor. Wouldnt have guessed nearly 12% by volume. Nice burnt flavor with a good smacking of hops and roasty malts, but not as aggressive as some of its American Imperial counterparts. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth...quite seductive. Jack up the complexity and this one is a classic; nonetheless, Bell's has done an excellent job with this offering.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,faernt,4.49,"I looked at my reviews and, diggy doo, I haven't reviewed one of my stalwarts. It pours with a pleasant head and a little bit of white on top of the cappucino. I have no idea how they do this but I'm thrilled when it happens. It's very dark brown in this glass. I don't get much smell, (escuze me!) The taste is what I want in an Imperial. The mouthfeel is seriously thick and chocolatey. This beer is drinkable. I keep it around all year.  01.04.07  Each year I put back a bottle or two of Expedition Stout. Initially, I wrote the year date on the crown cap and thanks now to the Bell's site I can look for bottling dates for the batches. Tonight, as I was reading posts on the site I read one about oldest beers. I have a bottle of 1999 Expedition in the cellar and now it's open and in a chalice beside me. It poured still as expected. The aroma is chocolate and port. The taste is raisins and port with a nutty bitterness like English walnuts. The flavors are beguilingly blended. The hops are subdued into the blend. This is a silky delight. I urge any fan of this beer to go for the long aging. It's beyond any old beer I've had.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nearly flawless.  Smell: This is where it missed for me. I couldn't pick up anything. I had to practically bury my nose in this beer to pick up anything. A hint of smoke was about the only thing I could get. Glad I didn't judge this brew soley on the basis of smell.  Taste: Here we go....sweetness, dried fruits, vanilla, espresso. All the cool things you would expect from an Imperial Stout. I didn't even notice the high ABV and I was in fact suprised when I saw how high it was. Certainly didn't pick up any of that in this brew. Just the slightest hint of a dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. A meal for your palate!  Drinkability: I could see myself going through a lot of these but since I bought a single, I'll have to wait for more. This truly lived up to expectations. I put this up there in my ""Top 5"" for RIS (I know, who cares?? I do!)

287,1444,jayb,4.42,"This syrup poured out as black as night into the glass. when pouring it almost looked like oil, as far as its thickness. started with no head but as i finished pouring a nice chocolate milk colored, 2 fingered head appeared....then settled to a film. lacing was ...decent. a very lovely beer to behold while the head remained. smell was of sweet chocolate, burnt malts, and what my sister described as ""soy sauce"". Taste: gee whiz. what a powerful brew. Most probably wouldnt think so as much as i, but from this was probably the strongest brew ive had in my limited experience. Taste was of chocolate, coffee, and a very roasty, burnt taste that lingered in the mouth. with such a sweet nose on this, the bitterness is a suprise, and a welcome one. Hint of candy flavoring, toffee and butterscotch? weird for me, id never expect that in a beer. wow, that burnt taste, as well as the bitterness keeps kicking me in the teeth! Toasty, just like my stomach. definite warming effect in my gut. Alcohol level is high but isnt a prevailent characteristic. mouthfeel is FULL and lovely, thickest ive had (I imagine not the thickest there is though) For my first imperial stout experience im a overcome with joy... and the roasted bitterness. Delightful. drinklability is low just for the fact that i could in no way drink more than two of these in an evening. Mighty tasty!

287,1444,noclue,4.67,"Serving Type: 11.2 ounce bottle served in matching tulip/snifter.  Appearance: Pours a thick pitch-black liquid. Tall brown creamy head that dies quickly. Decent lacing.  Smell: chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, faint whiff of hops.  Taste: Brutally harsh malty sweetness. Sweet and fruity up front, but the coffee comes kicking up from behind. Pleasantly bitter finish that lingers on and on. High alcohol content is noticeable, but not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, Smooth, and syrupy.  Drinkability/Overall: This is definately a brew to sit back, relax, drink slowly, and enjoy. Let the temperature come down a bit to enjoy some subtle changes. Maybe even stow some away in the cellar.

287,1444,GCBrewingCo,4.77,"The beer poured pitch black with slight ruby highlights. The head was brown and rose huge as the beer was poured and fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was chocolate, coffee and caramel with a huge dark fruit aroma in tow.  The flavor was excellent with well bittered chocolate and coffee flavors and dark fruits with hints of alcohol. Very complex and interesting.  The finish was dry with chocolate and coffee and alcohol warming.

287,1444,mobyfann,2.59,"Paid $2.99 for a 12oz. single  The appearence is a thick black bace with a thin if any brown head that doesn't last and the lacing is hard to find. The aroma is pretty good of roasted chocolate and coffee.  The taste was mixed personality, the thickness of the beer I didn't like, so I lowered mouthfeel down, the taste is a bit too strong, as not well defined, I really didn't find anything to special in this department. It's kind of drinkable but I didn't enjoy finishing my glass...  Final Thought: Extremely high expectations down the drain, almost literally, I don't know if this is common in high alcholic stouts, or if I had a bad bottle or what, I can't believe this is a Kalamazoo BC product... love their porter and double cream stout, but this was below par...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,psyco1,4.1,"This is strong beer.  It comes out of the bottle black and thick as I think beer can get. Not much of a head at all and while tilting the glass, it coats the side like bubbly paint. Can you roast alcohol? That's what it smells like, roasted barley, chocolate, coffee and a heaping helping of alcohol. The taste... a bit of alcohol, roasty and a bit of sweet then ending bitter. Not unpleasant, just more of everything that most stouts are known for. It coats the mouth like it coats the inside of the glass, almost like oil.  I gave it a lower mark on drinkability because I'd only drink one or maybe two before moving on to something else a little less ""stout"".",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

This is a beauty to look at, perfection marred by the tons of large pieces of sediment throughout. Scents of chocolate, toffee, sassafrass...roasted yumminess.... So great and creamy, wonderful mouthfeel. Tastes so dark and yummy... Chocolate, very dark black coffee, burnt toast, grapefruit. Light carbination. Very good and one I could sit back and handle a damn few in a sitting. Good amount of thickness to it, but not so it is too heavy. Very great stout.

Poured into an imperial pint glass, WOW, some almost nitro action from a CO2 bottle beer, weird, but cool. Formed a thick, frothy 2"" chocolate-hued head above a dark, dark brown/black brew. Head lasts more or less forever, and laces like you wouldn't believe. Aroma is is of heavy grains and malts, but not the bitterness that is usually associated with such a constructed brew. Heavy malts dominate the flavor, but their bitter ness seems to hide behind their sweetness, and make for an easy drinking brew, considering the heaviness and alcohol strength that is hiding somewhere in there... Mouthfeel is excellent, and drinkability is dangerously high for such a brew.

287,1444,DPMomutant,4.03,"The body is the expected pitch black. The head is very brown and much larger than I expected. I did not need to pour nearly this hard but I was not expecting as much head. Obviously, this bottle has not suffered the flatness problems as some batches apparently did. This head is lasting absolutely forever, no matter, a beer of this style needs to warm a bit anyway. Massive lacing.  The smell is mostly very strong fruit, like raisins but bolder. I'm catching a hint of brown sugar. Reminds me some of wine or sherry, but not much alcohol in the smell as I would expect of a big beer like this.  The taste does not come out quite as sweet as the smell. There is some coffee taste here and the wine-like alcohol comes out as well, but is not overpowering.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, I'm imagining what it will be like if I let the rest of the bottles sit until the dead of winter.  Obviously as big as this is, more than 12oz of this in a session where you've already had a couple, you don't want more than one.

287,1444,Boilermaker88,4.28,"Well, it's cooled off out here in SoCal so I decided to finally pop the cap off my Bell's Expedition Stout, graciously sent my way by CRJMellor. Poured into my handy-dandy tasting glass, the first thing I noticed was the 1"" tall, firm, resilient mocha-colored head that slowly settled down to a ring, leaving blotchy lace behind. Then I noticed the complete absence of light penetrating the brew. Just an inky blackness. No ruby highlights, no maroon or brown edging. Just a uniform deep-in-a-mine black. The nose was rich and inviting, loaded with a hearty roasted malt aroma, a bit of a prune note, sherry, port wine, and coffee. Some cocoa aroma, too. The taste had a potent vinous flavor, a la port wine. Lots of roasted dark malts and baker's chocolate. Some mild dark fruit sweetness and molasses mid-palate before a counterpointing herbal hops bitterness struck in the finish. The feel was full, viscous, and dry with a real tight zippy carbonation lending a creaminess that was quite pleasant. Overall, I really enjoyed this imperial stout, actually one of the best I've tried so far. Interesting that the reviews (and consistancy) are all over the map for this brew. Guess I'll just sit back, enjoy what's left in my glass and count my blessings. Mmm...Expedition Stout..",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,HappyHourHero,4.15,"Dark coco colored head fades slowly leaving a scattered coat of lace. Deep black colored beer, the kind that sucks all the light out of the room. Raisins, brandy, a bit of spice (fig), and pretzels? Nice aroma. Fairly thick body, smooth mouthfeel almost feels like microscopic carbonation. Flavors of roasted malt, coco, red wine until a bitter bite, kind of coffee-ish, kicks in half way and holds solid throught the finish. Let it warm up a little and the bitter finish fades and the subtle flavors come out.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Skidz,4.33,"Pours out the darkest brown imaginable and appears silky smooth out of the bottle. Sits completely black, and totally opaque in the glass with thick brown head on top.  Smells sweet, with caramel, chocolate, roasted grains and a light hint of dark fruits.  Tastes of bitter-sweet chocolate, heavy on the roastedness, alcohol becomes present in the full bitter finish. Great taste all around the board.  This beer is as smooth and silky as I could ever imagine a beer to be. Big, thick body really compliments this.

The taste, like the aroma, is of roasted chocolate and coffee malts. Some hop bitterness comes through nicely in the finish. This beer has a thick, oily mouthfeel, and goes down quite smooth although it does feel a bit heavy.

287,1444,99bottles,4.22,"Apperance: Pours an ultra dark brown-black with a poofy dark tan head of about an 1.5"". Looks quite thick. Nasty lace sticks as the beer is drank.  Smell: I can stand 5 feet away and smell rich black roasted malts and twinges of imperial bitterness. I'm salivating. Rich chocolate smell also. Very Storm Kingesque with regard to smell.  Taste: Uh oh. I might just go back to the store and clean them out of the rest of these. This is better than good. Immense hop profile gives this the perfect imperial stout aftertaste and such a good signature. There is an obvious roasted barley body, good presence of chocolate, some light butterscotch, lots of molasses, coffee. Very classic flavor, quite aged Rogue Imperial Stoutesque.  Mouthfeel: Super heavy, slick and smooth. Paints a coating on your tongue, and it's a nice memory of the beer. Very sludgy and super low carbonation begins to become really bothersome towards the finish.  Drinkability: Well, this is where it gets kind of odd. This beer goes down really slowly. It's sort of tough to have more than one, and even that has to go slow. I feel like its almost too heavy, doesn't dance on the tongue as much as it ought. It initally doesn't seem like 11.5%, but it does feel heavy and slow due to a lack in carbonation, even for an imperial stout. Still excellent though, just a bit off.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,murphyl,4.12,"Appearance: Poured thickly, about the consistency of Kahlua coming out of the bottle, pitch black, absolutely opaque (no joke - I put my emergency see-it-a-mile-away LED flashlight against the glass and saw nothing out the other side). Piles of toffee-colored head left copious lace on the glass.  Smell: Hmm, that's interesting. Alcohol is definitely right up front, along with chocolate, raisins and dried cherries (appropriate for Michigan, but in a stout...?). This certainly piques my interest.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Reminiscent of Kalamazoo Stout, only heavier and thicker, almost like a barley wine in terms of mouthfeel. Chocolate and rum flavors, plus a hefty hit of alcohol up front, fading a long, long roasted finish, with the dried cherries making an encore appearance.  Drinkability: I wouldn't advise you drink more than two of these a night, as the 11.5% ABV will sock your brain and your tastebuds into next week. As a nightcap, a special occasion beer or the end of a session, however, you could do far, far worse.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,LuckySevens82,3.45,"12 oz bottle. I have to thank FeloniousMonk for letting me try this one. Pours an oil black with a very similar viscosity. Almost no carbonation, a head was forced and disappeared very quickly. Smell is coffee, chocolate, some alcohol. You can smell the sweetness right off the bat. Taste is overwhelmingly sweet. While this beer is very smooth (which I like in an imperial stout) I think the complete lack of carbonation in the brew is a detriment. This brew has a huge chocolate taste. This is like alcoholic chocolate syrup. It is way to thick and syrupy for my tastes. I can certainly understand why people like it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Crosling,5,"My first Bell's beer.  Black as black gets. The head is well developed, a light chocolate brown, dense, creamy and sticky.  Deeply roasted malts, chocolate, anise, dark fruits, coffee beans, charcoal and cream all add to a splendid nose.  The texture is so smooth and so creamy. It just glides across the palate. Pecan, roasted malt, chocolate and coffee beans compete with vanilla, nutmeg and sharp fruits. The bitterness is well perceived. A delicious malt experience but it has a few issues. The lack of carbonation does not effect the flavor but it does effect the way I perceive the flavor. This could be so much better. That being said, the 11.5% tastes more like 7. Very drinkable for the style. A very solid imperial stout. Rereview. After several dozen bottling and batches, this is my favorite beer ever.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Beutiful chocolate brown with the head initial pour, then head tails off as expected. 11.5% was not detactable, thought it was 6 and change. Expresso soft drink.

Pours deep dank dark black brown into my imperial mug with a low brown head that only rises up on a vigorous pour. But once it's there, it holds like a Irishman to a blade of glass.  Aroma is deep raisin and tobacco. molasses gingerbread and brown sugar.  Beer starts deep and rich with coffee and toffee. Surprisingly little roast for a beer this dark and toasted, In the middle of the brew I get a bunch of bready biscuit and chewing tobacco.  The finish veers to port and chcocolate and a ton of malty goodness.  Is this good beer? Nope. Is it a great beer? Yup.

287,1444,freed,3.83,"Another batch imported by our man in the midwest; Bill. Thanks!  Yet another lovely label from Bell's, simple and elegant. I should have been wary when I popped the cap and there was no rush of gas. Pouring was enough confirmation though - there was no carbonation to the beer. The pouring was uneventful, despite the troubling black liquid. It sat dully in the glass, deeply brown with body. The very top, visible without any head, gave hints of amber around the edges. There's even some odd sediment that almost looks like it belongs in hot & sour soup.  The aroma is welcoming though - deep, filling, and robust with mocha goodness. The combination of malted barley and coffee hide the barely noticeable smell of alcohol.  The taste is also very robust - nearly syrupy without carbonation, but still good. There are very bitter chocolate flavors, dark espresso flavors, and a smooth maltiness all around.  The sensation is somewhat lacking without the balance of gasses, and the mouthfeel is somewhat alcoholic. Especially while brewing beer and having skipped breakfast and lunch.  This is a very tasty beer, but I feel it must be tried on cask, or tap. Preferably close to the source. I'll see what I can do.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,cerevisiaephilus,4.7,"Good lord. I'm sad I hadn't rediscovered Imperial stouts sooner. This one is fantastic. Really nice pillowy head that rises when summoned, but otherwise doesn't. I like having this control.  Big nose. Fruity and chocolaty...very rich. Definately some hops in there too. Also get some nice wine maybe port notes too. Just a little 'sour' like that is quite nice.  Big flavor. Very rich. Very very nice. Like a big hunk of dark dank chocolate cake that makes ethanol run through your nose after you eat a bite...nice. Get a touch of wineyness too...just right for such a big beer. This is hoppy but just enough (which is still a ton!) to balance this beer out.  A very nice mouthfeel. Not as nice as Rogue's Imperial, just a touch on the thick side here, but still really nice...and I suppose it wouldn't be nearly as rich without it.  Actually quite drinkable. Not too bitter to wear your palette out, and just enough roasted toasty to dry out the sweetness.  A beautiful beer to say the least.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,abents,4.15,"Pours a thick oily black that looks delicious. Thick brown head that laces beautifuly. Smells of roasted malts and chocolate hint of alcohol. Tastes of coffee with a bigger malt taste that follows. Very noticible alcohol, but not overpowering the taste is smoothed out and feels very creamy. Some bitterness but very sudden. Mouthfeel is a full bodied with that interesting creamy texture. Low carbonation and alcohol warming. A very drinkable brew to say the least.

Midnight black in color, like liquid coal and completely opaque. The aroma yields rich and roasted grains, dark chocolates, vanilla extract and gives a slight hint of the alcohol in this beer. Smells rich and complex. Wonderful flavors in this one  Dry roasted coffee, dry spices, alcohol among other thing. Actually, theres no mistaking the alcohol in this beer. It isnt shy. This has a dry and woody roasted bitterness that is very intense, and is very prominent in the finish. It actually coats the tongue. Theres a medium to full body of malt somewhere in here. I must say that I enjoyed this strong dark beer and can appreciate the craft here, but it is for the initiated only, and not for the faint of heart. Very powerful and intense, but mellows a bit as it warms. Way to go!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BeerResearcher,4.54,"12oz brown bottle. No freshness date. It pours a very dark espresso color with a small but lasting mocha head and some stringy-type lace. The aroma of fresh coffee and then dark cocoa rise up. A smell of fresh baked bread and dark rum are also pretty noticeable. A nice floral hop nose manages to work its way into the scene. The luxuriously oily malt body offers up a potent extra dark bitter chocolate flavor. Sweet roasted malt, cookie dough and buttered biscuits come to mind. The tastes of rum-soaked prunes and licorice are also in the mix. The big fresh hop cluster taste releases piney esters, along with tangy citrus bitterness and orange peel zestiness. I splashed a little on my keyboard tray setting it down. When I touched it with fingers, I noticed just how thick and oily this brew is.

287,1444,Foxman,4.6,"It pours an inky black, as dark as the darkest night, impassable to light. One finger of frothy cocoa colored head swells promptly, then settles slowly to patches of foam. Sticky fingers of lacing gild the inside of the glass.  The aroma brings earthy tones of dark roasted malt, bitter and burnt, but full of espresso and chocolate notes. A milder caramel undercurrent duels with a sherry character in the olfactory underworld, and gives way to a hoppy resonance. The alcohol throughout is present but fairly mild.  First sip delivers a dense, syrupy malt sweetness, roasted and leathery, which is allied with chocolate covered espresso beans and a mellow biscuit grain presence. A vinous character plies its trade in the middle in unison with the warming, vaporous strains of alcohol. A black cherry sweetness caresses the sides of the tongue briefly. The finish is a lingering bitterness of artfully burnt grain and distantly floral hops. This is one delightfully complex blend of bitter and sweet.  Heavy bodied, pouring like ebony oil, it slides about the mouth like chilled molasses, leaving traces of nectar everywhere. A dry glow at the finish caps a textural massage of the palate.  It captures light and transforms it splendidly into a smooth and distinguished elixir. Everything about it takes the extra steps to excel, delivering more than you expected, no matter what you expected. The balance is fun but seriously grounded in the down-to-earth components. The high ABV is very apparent, but everything about this makes you want to ignore its strident warnings and have yet another, and I think it's worth whatever risk you may run. Any expedition you need to undertake to procure this fine stout is one you should make gladly, and soon.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jwilli7122,3.42,"I finally located this one, and am quite eager to try it out...  pours an opaque black with a purple tinge. absolutely zero head - I poured it hard and I can literally count the bubbles. there is a somewhat frightening looking smoke-colored film covering about 1/3 of the surface.  smell is wicked plum and alchohol, smells more like a barley wine than a stout.  taste: wow. unlike anything i have ever had. i shouldn't, but i'll try -black licorice, chocolate syrup and...some sort of coffee-type flavor that i have never experienced...with alchohol, dark fruit and black malt in the back.  mouthfeel is syrupy-thick with almost no carbonation, and it's right. absolutely the most aggressive, indefinable beer i have ever had.  note: after reading other reviews - and seeing that this beer is supposed to have a head and big hops - i wonder if my bottle was abnormal.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,kwalters,3.91,"The grand daddy of the Bell's stout lineup finally makes an appearance in my glass.  My expectations were very high having read many good reviews and having enjoyed several other imperial stouts and Bell's stouts. Expedition pours as black as a new moon in a midnight sky. The head is small but tightly bubbled and beautiful. Surprisingly, the aroma from this brew is subdued. You can pick out roasty tones, but you'll have to work a bit.  The taste is not at all subdued. Roastiness and burnt wood abound. Bittersweet chocolate and hoppiness are easy to find and enjoy. But I kept wondering if something was missing. The best part of Expedition is the mouthfeel. Like so many of Bell's stouts, Expedition is very creamy and smooth.  If it weren't for the big price ($14.99/sixer) this big brew would be topnotch. But considering that I can get comparable Michigan imperial stouts from Arcadia and Founders for $5 less, Expedition will have a hard go of it trying to frequent my fridge.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,crookedhalo,4.26,"Like many other beers, I've had this one a few times before I got around to reviewing it. My remembrance of it was that it was just about the best Imperial Stout one got get stateside. I've let the bottle warm up some before I uncapped it. Pours inky darkest brown color with a generous milk chocolate brown head that goes to a lacing around the glass. Dark chocolate, black patent malt, nutty Kona blend coffee bean and some fruitiness from the yeast comes through in the aroma. Whoo. Intese roasty malt flavors intertwined with a vinous, yeasty alcohol bite that warms the esophagus. Bittersweet and winey. Lovitt man... This beer should be a one time in a while kind of beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BitteBier,4.43,"This stout means business. Pours black and opaque with a cakey, bronze head that remains intact and laces nicely. Smell is striking, melding alcohol dryness, roasted notes, and the standard choco-coffee mix one expects from a stout. Taste smoothes out after a few drinks, especially after the optimum temperature is reached. Taste mimics the smell--rather smooth with a dry bite that piques your interest. Mouthfeel is pleasant; despite a somewhat sticky feel, the taste lingers, rather than the texture. Its strong smell and taste weaken its drinkability a bit, but this beer is worth having even just one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gueuzedude,4.35,"Sampled February 2004 Pours a deep black color with a creamy brown head. Thick aromas of chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, an aroma I usually associate with Lactose stouts, and alcohol all waft form my glass. What a thick viscous brew, it is quite creamy on my tongue. The thickness and body of this brew helps to balance the roast character, so that it is not overwhelming. It is like a rich, creamy, chocolate covered espresso bean, but accentuated a bit more towards the creamy dark chocolate. This beer has a burnt/ roast astringent finish, which, helps to balance the rich malty sweet flavors that are up front. There is not much in the way of hops, but they would seem out of place in this brew. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste, and is only really noticeable in the aroma. Wow, what a wonderful, smooth, sipping beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,merlin48,4.55,"Served at room temperature into a Fuller's pint glass, this pours an inky, opaque dark brown with a fascinating head that is only 2 cm, but appears to give garnet hues on the tan fringe. Nice sheets of lace are left behind. Aroma is inviting, with a big mocha chocolate punch, some wood smoke, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with medium carbonation. Taste is delicious. Creamy, milk chocolate dominates the palate, with burnt coffee, wood smoke, walnut nuttiness, raisins, and some English hops for bittering balance. Alcohol remains well hidden until it emerges a bit near room temperature. Finish is dry and bitter, with a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. Exceptional flavor here, and very nice balance. One of the best stouts I've ever enjoyed.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,jackndan,4.42,"Bells Expedition Stout: In a twelve ounce brown bottle. This beer has a small label around the neck, so I believe it to be a recent vintage.  An extremely vigorous pour spills up a large (two inch) head. The head is deeply packed with tiny bubbles and pours a creamy brown color. The last few drips of the brew slowly work their way through the dense head. The color of the beer is almost pure black, and even when held up to the strongest light, does not let any light through.  The aroma is very nice, as it poured out of the bottle, I could smell the coffee/chocolate malts. Giving this brew a nice swirl emits the same aroma, very nice and rich with just a bit of alcohol.  The taste is fantastic. Extremely malty, very nice dark chocolate flavors, with a hint of dried fruits, raisins, and a tiny bit of freshly mown hay. As the beer moves over the palate, the coffee espresso flavors assert themselves. Leaves a malty aftertaste, almost like melted dark chocolate. There is a definite warming from the alcohol towards the end as well. This beer is not a smooth stout, its got more than a little bite to it as well.  Extremely tasty, and highly recommended.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Gavage,4.09,"Pours a deep black color with no head. The aroma was huge, as espresso and alcohol were most notible. The flavors followed the aroma as roasted malt, espresso, and alcohol pummeled the tastebuds into overload. Decent bittering balanced this out.  But this bottle poured with no head and was relatively flat compared to others like Storm King. Do not know if this was an aberation, but this caused a lower score in mouthfeel. Drinkability is decent, but the alcohol level was a little over the top.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,bigbubba,4.31,"This was an awesome stout! It is one of the darkest black beers I've ever seen. And the head was huge and dark brown. Lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and hops.

I really wish it wasn't so expensive because this was an awesome beer!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,yankeeheel,4.7,"My, my, my, what have we here. Pours like a big fat cup of adult dark cocoa. Nice two finger espresso head.  Lots of chocolate and malt coming up through the vapors. Smells heavenly to this stout lover.  Tastes almost like someone tried a little homemade concoction of melted chocolate and then added some really good colombian coffee. Malts just busting out from every direction. Smoky, charcoal, ash, oak. This one has it all. A huge beer in every sense of the word. Finishes dry.  Mouthfeel strikes a balance between being super fat and creamy but due to the goods winds up being fat. Not oily, just big.  Drinkability is very good for such a big beer. I could see having three of these and then calling a cab. Get you some.

287,1444,GreatPondBrewer,4.78,"This beer could be the be all end all for me. A huge thanks goes out to nomad for this one.  Poured the viscous black of some place in the heavens where starlight has never penetrated. Pearched atop what I could only call dark matter was a regal crown the shade and consistancy of a coffee milkshake.  Smelled divine with rich notes of figs, other assorted dry fruits and port which morphed into rolling waves of brown sugar, massive esters and the darkest of dark chocolates.  Tasted something akin to the ambrosia of the Olympian gods. It started out with a rum soaked, chocolate covered cherry flavor, which moved seamlessly into a deep roasty espresso vying for time with bitter grains and slight resinous hops. As it moved back down my throat it changed once again to more bitter chocolate notes and a dry smokey finish. Only in the back of my mind did the alcohol ever even remotely show itself. The mouthfeel was the consistancy of carbonated motor oil.  Since it is 11.5% I had to drink this slow, which was fine with me as it gave me time to savor each and every sip. This is a beer to take in on a cold winters night in front of a fire with one or two close friends and a fine conversation.

287,1444,JMH_,4.43,"was a little wary of this one as i'm usually on the fence when it comes to imperial stouts. started out with an absolutely amazing pour. dark as night black (and thick as hell) with an deep tan head that is absolutely massive and creamy. it leaves anice streaky stickiness on the glass. bravo. the smell is great as well, with notes of cookies dough, spice, chocolate, malt with maybe some coffee hints in the back. i am a bit giddy at this point and can't wait for my first sip. so, while i'm on the fence with imperial stouts as i stated earlier, this one is just a winner. the best imperial stout i have tasted thusfar. starts with a chocolate malt flavour that moves into some bitterness then a dry coffee finish. it gets bonus points from me for not being overly aggressive with the coffee flavouring. there is a nice alcohol warmth in the throat on every sip as well, but the alcohol is maked nicely otherwise. while i would still turn down the coffee flavouring a bit (though just an ever so slight notch), this is a damn near perfectly balanced beer in terms of flavour. mouthfeel is heavy and smooth for this full bodied brew, which is just right in my book. easy drinking and i wish i had access to this brew and to this brewery more often. an excellent brew.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,BuckeyeNation,4.13,"Midnight black with no highlights to speak of. The head is a massive milk chocolate brown monster, one of the darkest I've ever seen. The foam is melting slowly and is depositing thick, shredded sheets of lace on the glass.  The aroma doesn't exactly jump out of the glass, but it does become bolder with warming. Each sniff delivers chocolate, coffee and hops, in order from most prominent to least. The flavor is strong, rich and dark, with boatloads of roasted malt. Specifics include generous helpings of black licorice/anise, molasses and bitter espresso.  Expedition tastes rougher, more bitter and more alcoholic than Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout. It'd be a better beer if the alcohol were masked more completely and the edges were smoothed off a little. The mouthfeel is some kind of amazing. This brew is thick, chewy, ultra creamy smooth and goes down like heavy cream.  This is a Big Beer, one that should be sipped and savored. If you like your Imperial stouts with an unapologetically brash, bold, slightly raw taste, but with a refined, well-mannered mouthfeel, then you'll enjoy Expedition Stout immensely. I think I'll age the next bottle.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,nomad,4.25,"Pours quite a rolling, bulbous, and pocky head, showing a wide lattice stain and slow dripping lace.  Smells of smoky and dark malts, as well as plain dark coffee with some aromatics.  Tastes like big roastiness, big dark malts, big dark coffee, and big alcohol, and then some herbaceous, minty hops. Plenty of espresso-like bitterness once you settle in, too. After adjusting to this beer, you can feel it standing on the verge of falling off into a rollicking mess. Fruity anise slowly comes through, as the finish tastes like chewing coffee grounds and a creamy bitterness - interesting finish to say the least. Complex, rough, but smooth, the bigger the harder fall, and this one is dangerously close.  Its a thick doozy. Can't wait to try some more, I feel it takes more than a couple to wrap your mouth around this behemoth. Also aging two bottles to see what happens.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,deejaydan,4.45,"Pours like used motor oil. Thick and black as night. Modest head, but leaves some lacing on the glass. Has a french roast coffee to molassess aroma. Thick mouthfeel, which is appropriate for a this style. The carbonation is light, and needed to make the thick liquid dance on the tounge. This is defineatly a sipping beer. One or two of these would be plenty for the night. The taste is a tad heavy on the roasted barley-roasted coffee flavor for me, but this is an exceptional stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,RoyalT,4.85,"Appearance - Black in color with a slightly reddish hue and an awesome, dark tan head that showed great retention and laced the hell out of my glass. I can't say enough about how cool this looks at the pour.  Smell - Big, beautiful roasted malt notes along with some nice coffee and very dark fruiting, most notably figs and dates. There's also some brown sugar to this one along with a hop balance of some kind. This nose is very complex, and I'm sure that I'm missing a lot.  Taste - The bitter coffee comes out huge at the taste. All the other players from the aroma are here as well, but it's the coffee that takes things up a notch. There's also some malty cocoa to the flavor profile. This is not for the faint of heart.  Mouthfeel - Super creamy and milky smooth. This is a full-bodied stout if there ever was one. The bitter nature of this ale will give you the shakes.  Drinkability - I loved this stout, although it may be too bitter for some. I'll give Stone the edge simply because it has a bit more balance (with more big fruits) but this is certainly one of my Top Ten beers of all time.  Comments - A big thumbs up to francisweizen for sending me this awesome offering from Bell's. This is an experience that I'll never forget - and one I hope to repeat : )  Update - I got an '04 bottle of this from my brother-in-law in Madison, WI, and cellared it for four years. For some reason I was in a giddy mood tonight and decided to pop it open.  Oh, Lordy, is this a good beer. First let me say that this has not changed nearly as much as I thought it would after four years of cellaring. It hasn't sweetened up like I thought it would and could probably stomach another four years. Having said that, this is one of the most flavorful beers on the planet and is probably STILL too bitter for most even after four years in the cellar. Damn the torpedoes though I am enjoying the hell outta this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ElGuapo,4.75,"A deep dark black brew covered in a thick dark brown head. Oh, this one is certainly a looker. Sweet chocolate hits the nose first, followed by burnt malts. Coffee and espresso are in there as well. So rich and roasty, I can only imagine how great this one is going to be.  It is very smooth and rich with very mild carbonation. The body is full, very full, and I would even say a little thick. Flavors come at me from everywhere. Coffee is huge and very dark and roasty. Chocolate still manages to show off some sweetness. Espresso, and burnt flavors come in to play near the finish. There are small kicks of alcohol from time to time. This is an imperial alright. It also has a nice hop presence, so just when you think you had tasted it all, it gives you a little more. Warming effect is nice, and despite this being a big big beer, it is very drinkable.  Well, Bell's sure made a great first impression. The PA beer laws were good to me on this one. I ""had"" to buy a case. Looks like this one worked out real fine.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,kbub6f,4.9,"Side-by-side tasting with North Coast Old Rasputin (because I drink a lot of Raspy and it always makes me happy).  I didn't have the carbonation problem some have mentioned. The head was small, but it didn't take any extra coaxing to get one. Dark brown and a little noisy, too. There is a strong roasty edge to the nose. It's almost nutty. There's also chocolate and maybe a little smoke. The beer starts strong, thick and chocolatey. It's very buttery (like a dollop of butter melted into it). The middle is thick, thick, malty, choco, sweet, buttery. A strong alcohol finish seems almost toxic.  So how does it compare to my standard Rasputin? It's thicker, maltier and more buttery. Much less hoppy and bitter. Stronger than Raspy, quite a bit more intense. Very rich. So they're different, but each one impresses me as I switch between them. I'm going to ding Expedition on drinkability because for me the richness gets almost cloying (I said ""almost""). But for that, it would beat Rasputin, I think.  Thanks Al. I think I owe you.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Winter,2.87,"Presumably from the 2002 bottling as none of this six pack's residents are sporting any neck labels. Pours a thick viscous black with absolutely no head what-so-ever, even after an attempted hard pour. Aroma consists of alcohol, expresso and chocolate. Some sweetness also detected. Full-bodied and coating mouthfeel. The taste is vinous and alcoholic. Grainy and chocolate flavors emerge toward the back. Finishes dry with a roasted malt and ghost-like tabacco flavors.  Defintely a sipping beer and very hard to finish. I did not want another one, and quite frankly, how many of these could one desire, especially with the carbonation issues? My impression, at least from this batch, is that this beer is highly overrated. I'm not completely turned off, but I'll wait for the new bottles. The Bell's retailer should have these pulled off the shelf and supply a more fresher, properly brewed and bottled product.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mikeys01,4.32,"Served froma 12 oz brown bottle, this is from the 2002 batch. The expedition poured out an inky black the color of well used motor oil, and unfortunately with just about as much carbonation...however that was only a minor bump in the road and overlooked fairly easily. My only frustration was that I bought this under the inpression that it was the more-carbonated 2003. Aroma coming off this deep dark brew is full of espresso, roasted barley, and sugary sweetnees. The taste is even more rewarding with deep roasty coffee flavor coming right out. Then it begins to be enhances by just a touch of hop bitternes and a fruitiness that I can only describe as reminiscent of the fruit you used to see in big glass jars soaked in brandy once upon a time. Quite smooth and sweet, the alcohol this one sneaks up on you. I'd love to try a more carbonated sample of this one...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,CortexBomb,5,"The Black Hole of Beers.  Expedition pours out jet black into a pint glass with little carbonation evident, just enough to form a thin head which hangs around. The beer clings to the sides of the glass much like motor oil upon shifting and has an intense roasted and molasses scent which invites you to partake.  Strong and varied flavour on this one with coffee and chocolate being dominant but not overwhelming and an exceptional roasty bitter finale. Feels incredibly 'thick' in the mouth with a strong taste that lingers on your taste buds seemingly forever.  The drinkability rating represents my overall feelings about this beer relative to other imperial stouts. I've had a lot of them at this point, as it's one of my favourite styles, and though it might be hometown pride talking, I still think Expy is the best, plain jane Russian Imperial out there. It's affordable given its style, and I'm always in the mood for it.  Hard to find a more flavourful or tasty imperial stout, my current favourite, and the crown jewel of Bell's impressive line of stouts.  (Also worth noting that Expy ages wonderfully, like many of the more powerful beers, letting this stuff sit for a year or two only deepends the flavour, and takes the edge off the hops, an interesting juxtaposition with the fresh product, and just as tasty, simply in a different way)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It poured still and looked like soy sauce  black and opaque. The nose was like a stout perfume with scents of roasting coffee, sugar and alcohol. The taste is intense with chocolate, coffee and buttered rum. Rich, thick and delicious. Try it with a piece of good chocolate and experience bliss.

Definitely has nutty roasted malt flavors but also has strong sweet dark chocolate flavors present thoughout as well as some coffee.  Mouth feel is chewy, smooth, slick, chewy, outstanding.

287,1444,HiroProtagonist,4.46,"Note:I had a friend lug a six pack of this back from Michigan (where it was in a cooler), to Portland... the bottle I review below has been sitting in my closet since April 2002. Poured out of the bottle into a Duvel tulip with little fanfare. Poured like a dark chocolate syrup, a dark burnt brown. Appearance score would have been better if there was evidence of carbonation. In the glass it was black, with some dark burnt red- brown peaking out at the edges of the glass. Wafting some distance away from the glass were powerful aromas of decadently dark chocolate, dry cocoa, and alcohol with some ester notes attached to it. I love it! It entered my mouth in what seemed like a dormant state, shunning my taste buds for a few moments. Then blam!! Ultra-dark smokey chocolate bitterness exploded on my palate, and my lips assumed the conformation of a blissful smile. Exceptional...a riot in my mouth. This flavor lingers on long after a sip is taken. After recovering from the shock I sought out other flavors. I found alcohol, raisins or prunes, hearty grainy malts, and maybe some cough syrup. I had a hard time distinguishing the bitter chocolate from bitter hops, maybe it comes from both the hops and the roasty malts? Mouthfeel was pure velvet, full and smooth. Notable was the complete lack of carbonation. I have heard that older bottlings are nearly flat (which I think this is because of the lack of a band on the neck or upper part of main label). Or it could be the travel mishandling on the way to my glass? I imagine that carbonation would improve the flavor and mouthfeel significantly. When I acquire a more carbonated bottle of Expedition a re-review may yield higher marks for taste and mouthfeel. It isn't extremely drinkable (though good), due to its power and explosiveness. This is the nature of a stout of this caliber. This is one to experience!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It had bittersweet chocolate, toasted bread crust, charcoal, and paper match smoke in the nose. Occasional whiffs of alcohol can be found. This was 11.5%?!?! This beer does an immaculate job hiding the alcohol. I would not have guessed it over 8.5%! In the mouth this beer was one harsh mofo. It tastes like it looks, dense and black. It actually smells like it could have been a sweet imperial stout, but it was not. It was dry and charred from start through everlasting, salty finish. It kinda funny, but there were some hop burps. Hops? They get lost in the blackened mess. Good creamy mouthfeel.  This was a gigantic stout. There is no doubt about that. I was a bit let down though. Id been waiting to try this for years, and I finally cracked one of my two that I brought home from Michigan this Thanksgiving. I wish it was a bit sweeter. It grew on me, but it was no what I expected. While I can appreciate a aggressive beer like this (and Monster, Blithering Idiot, Quad, etc) I like them a bit more smooth.

Really potent, the alcohol doesn't burn though it doesn't overdo anything just adds another depth level there.

Aroma was slightly chocolate with a little smoke or peat, also a little bit medicinal and maybe a raisin hint. Slight hop aroma deep in the background. Mouthfeel is not as strong as the look would indicate, smooth, rich and syrupy. Taste is overpoweringly coffee, roasted caramel and highly alcoholic on the back end.

The mouthfeel is thick and gooey-very viscous and reminds me of a really rich chocolate malted in which the ice cream has melted and what is left is that syrupy mass of ultra rich, ice creamy turned liquid goodness.

287,1444,ManekiNeko,4.95,"12 oz bottle served lightly chilled in a Trois Pistoles goblet.  Appearance: Inky black with no highlights whatsoever. Wow, über-dark. Topped with a fantabulously gorgeous and healthy mahogany brown head. It eventually settles down to a film and a ring, but only after a good long while. Extraordinary lacing, just plain extraordinary.  Smell: Dark roasted coffee, high quality cocoa, light prunes, mild smoke, and slight biscuit aromas. Damn, that's dark and complex. I spent a good few minutes just sniffing this incredible elixir of the gods.  Taste: Intense and bittersweet coffee flavor with hints of smoke. Notes of prunes and raisins. Aftertastes of pepper and piney hops that last forever. Just friggin' incredible.  Mouthfeel: Thick, robust body. I've often pondered comparing the body of a beer to a woman's body, but have quavered for consideration of those possessing homozygous sex chromomes. Now, I shall throw caution to the wind and just say it: if this beer were a woman, she'd have the body of a 50's starlet like Jane Mansfield of Marilyn Monroe. Va-va-voom!  Drinkability: Well, I sadly only have one bottle, and this is it. *sniff* &gt;.&lt; *weep* I love this. Trades will be made, oh, yess.. yes they will. Worthy of it's placement in the top 50. Curse you Bell's for making such tasty stouts of all stripes!!!  Mad crazy props to feloniousmonk for making this possible.

287,1444,steelreign,4.62,"This beer is HUGE! Pitch black pour with zero head (And I mean nothing). Looks like motor oil sitting in my glass....but motor oil never smelled this good!! Aroma is so complex - roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, licorice....hops, liquor....you name it! Wow.  The taste is dense, thick with roasted maltiness with a nice hop hammer balance. So incredibly smooth and complex. A party in the mouth.  Viscous mouthfeel. Thick, nice low carbonation. High ABV is apparent, but enjoyable, on a small consumption scale at least. Not to be drank in mass quantities (unless you are a masochist). This is one of the best of the style without question!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,PhantomVodoo,4.07,"Minimal brown head that shortly became nothing more than a film sits atop an opaque black beer. Aroma is mesmerizing. The best aroma on a stout I can remember. Chocolate covered fruit (strawberries come to mind) pretty much sums it up.  Taste is big and bold. Sweet chocolate covered fruit (melons come to mind) up front. This gives way to roasty bitterness, alcohol and hops. The two extremes balance this one out nicely between sweet and bitter.  Lots of body and some creaminess to the mouthfeel. Thick? I think your car could get 3000 miles out of this stuff if you used it in place of 10W-30. Drinkability is the drawback of this one for me. I just don't find it real drinkable. Overall, this is a big beer and one of the better imperial stouts out there, IMO. Big thanks to Blatzman for providing me with the bottle and prompting me to give this beer another try!

Appearance: The very essence of black with this beauty. Poured a Grand Canyon-deep black with no even the faintest hint of light making its way through the edges of the glass. A wispy-thin layer of dark tan-colored head paints a new picture on the top of the beer after each sip.  Smell: All sorts of lovliness going here. Bitter baking chocolate, roasted nuts, toffee, roasted coffee beans. Dancing around the edges are hints of daark fruit.  Taste: Holy shnikeys!! This is an incredible beer. The flavor washes all over your palate, soaking it in flavor. Freshly-roasted coffee with about 8 pounds of chocolate syrup added to it. Throw in a Heath bar for good measure. Slow roast this and you have a good idea of just how big this beer is. Finishes with a long-lasting bittersweet chocolate taste on the palate, reminding you of what has just traversed your mouth. Absolutely fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Lovingly coats your palate with thick and syrupy richness. Huge-bodied and the good carbonation really helps make this a bubbly-creamy brew.  Drinkability: Briefly...very. So very well-balanced and easy on the palate. I refuse to believe that this beer is 11.5% ABV. Almost no indication anywhere in the profile do I detect any alcohol. It just got better and better as it warmed. An excellent combination of flavors make for one of the best beers I had to date.  Notes: 11.5%? Are you *sure*?

287,1444,alexgash,5,"100th review time. I've been hanging onto this one for awhile. I drank it's five carton mates last winter, and it was all I could do to not touch this one. This bottle was from the 2001 batch. This beer/batch is also now the number one beer on my short, but growing list. This is also my first (and last?) all ""5s"" beer. It pours as black as any beer or used motor oil I've ever seen. The head, which is on the smaller side, is a dark brown (probably the darkest head I have seen). Beautiful. The nose is insanely complex: chocolate, rum, raisins, plums, alcohol, oak, soy sauce, ???. I'm getting dizzy. Taste is ahhh. Big, rich dark fruity malts start off, then chocolate caramel takes over, then smoky oakiness, and then, finally, roasted bitterness. Alcohol is there, but it doesn' feel like 11.5%. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, yet beautifully smooth. I could drink this until detox.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,clvand0,2.78,"This beer poured a very very dark black color and it seemed quite thick. The head was thick and dark brown. Lots of lacing on the glass as well. The aroma was full of maltiness, chocolate, and coffee. Very powerful aroma. The main part of the flavor is the thick, dark maltiness but it also has some chocolates, coffees, (a small amount of) fruits, and several other things. Quite complex taste. The mouthfeel was interesting because the flavor is so strong. It almost killed my tastebuds at first.

287,1444,TheLongBeachBum,4.38,"Presentation: 12 fluid ounce, long neck, simple label with the word Bell&#8217;s, beneath which there is a strange compass like drawing on the front, with the words Expediton Stout below. 2002 offering.  Appearance: Holy Shit! - that reminds me I need to change the oil in my Car. Jet black viscous pour, I&#8217;ve seen lighter colored heavy fractions from the bottom of a tar filled Refinery Distillation column. The massive head is a dark brown, expansive & well aerated at first, after which, it settles to an incredibly smooth offering with shallow ravines & some pock-marks give a lunar landscape look about this Stout. The head eventually breaks, but not after it leaves an amazing lace. Solid inherent carbonation.  Nose: Roasted malts, coffee beans, dark chocolate & some fruit aspects, I actually got a light whiff of fresh Strawberries at first, but mixed with the dark chocolate - I can see why people get Cherries.  Taste: Starts & finishes with a long, deep, massive bitter-roast missives, which makes it a delight to re-taste after each swallow. After a while, I get a cherry fruitiness in the beginning as well as a Cocoa powder dryness in the middle, the ending has some Vanilla aspects. It takes a while & quite a bit of concentration to work this one out.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, but the bitter, roasted flavors coat the mouth like synthetic lubricating oil. It takes a few swallows before the bitter-roast flavors are eroded by the mere act of salivation. Mmmm, nice! Solid.  Drinkability: I simply do not believe that this is 11.5%, is it? &#8211; Nah, never! - it can&#8217;t be! - can it? Wow, if it is, it hides the alcohol so incredibly well. I will be honest to admit that if I sampled this blind, others could easily fool me into telling me it is between 6-8%, such is the balance. Bloody Hell, my Glass is empty!  Overall: Excellent ! I am so glad I got a good sample of this Expedition Stout from Bell&#8217;s, now I know why people are so pissed when they get less than par samples of this quite stupendous Stout &#8211; it would be a huge disappointment & a let-down for me also after tasting a good one.

The aroma comes right up to my nose - hops followed by raisin and burnt malt with distinct sweet chocolate hints. Taste is pungent. Flavor is bitter cofee and dark chocolate, with a strong alcohol finish and tingle. Chocolate and raisin lingers, as does a sting in the top of the palate, behind the nose. Mouthfeel feels a little thin for this one, and the drinkability is low due to the incredibly strong flavor.

The head was small at first then build to a sheer mountainous head full of bubbles, craigs, and peaks. Simply beautiful to watch it build. As the head starts to receed over time it leaves a webbing of lacing on the glass that simple defies gravity and clings to the glass. The head does fade but a quick swirl builds a new 1/8 inch head.  Aromas of cocoa, coffee, espresso, something similar to raisins, and molasses. Simply wonderful and begging to be tasted  The first sip was amazing, perhaps breath taking. Harsh and brash like a true Italian espresso with alcohol behind the bitter coffee. Wonderful, thick, chewy. Tastes of cocoa, coffee, toasted malt sweetness, that finishes with the taste of unsweetened coffee. A truly monsterous brew. A wonderful beer. A true pleasure.

The smell is invigorating, roasted coffee with a hint of sweetness, maybe caramel or chocolate. All of these smells are brought forth in the taste. Very heavy coffee taste with a great punch of hops.

A tannish head quickly fizzed about, and then departed, thereafter the beer seemed quite lightly carbonated. Aroma was sweet and creamy, boasting of highly roasted malts. Dark roasted malt flavors packed the liquid, like strong brewed coffee, without the coffee flavor. Mouthfeel was rather disconcertingly thin, which seemed out of place against the onslaught of roasted malt. Hops in the finish vied with a rather harsh alcohol flavor for control of the finishing note, with the alcohol winning out after a hard-fought battle. Overall, the flavor profile seemed out of whack for the style - a great deal of effort had gone into crafting the beer, but the final product is one which failed to win me over.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

287,1444,garymuchow,4.28,"4/4/09 New trial with '08-'09 version. Still highly hopped. Really quite dry, but holds nice deep and dark fruit flavors and enough sweetness. Aroma is largely malt with well intentioned roast (coffee) and some hops. Appearance holds a very stubborn and persistent rign of a very dark head. Opaque. The alcohol is very well subdued. No burning or hotness. Even with a couple of months aging the hops have settled some and I wonder what will happen with aging a couple of years. I look forward to that. Certainly better than my original trial (which in hindsight appeared to be part of a batch in which the brewery was in transition and showed some inconsistency).  I'm glad I read some reviews before making a decision on this beer, because for a time I thought that I may have had a bad bottle, but it seems several had the same experience as I. No sound upon opening and absolutely no head and no evidence of carbonation. Looks like motor oil and pours like it too. I found it very difficult to pick up much for aroma, it seemed dead to me. Flavor was different, extremely rich (too rich for my tastes) with coffee, dark roasted malt, burnt, dark fruit, alcohol and bitterness characteristics. Very heavy mouthfeel. For a beer lover, this style holds much ambiguity for me. I wouldn't list it as a favorite style, and therefore may hold a less objective position from which to review. Thus, even more than normal I'll own that not all samples of this style fit my tastes, i.e., some ones I like and some popular and well scored ones I don't. This falls in the later.

287,1444,marburg,3.22,"The last time I drank this beer, it was called Robitussin. Seriously.  Poured a deep, purple-black with zero head. It's Valvoline in a bottle, baby -- viscous doesn't even begin to describe this. In fact, there's no carbonation in this beer at all. Low carbonation seems normal enough for a stout, sure. But this is just flat.  Anyhow, the aroma is mostly derived from the high alcohol content -- rubbing alcohol, pine needles, raisins (or grapes?). The taste is the lone redeeming factor of this beer but even then, I rate it highly only because of its complexity. I think this beer is actually kind of poorly balanced, and the alcohol flavor is way too overpowering. I generally dig high-abv beers -- trappists, barleywines, even Sam Adams Triple Bock. But this just didn't do it for me. If you don't drink this nearly ice cold, the flavor -- like many overdone American microbrews -- just overpowers any semblence of balance. And having so little carbonation in this really hurts the texture and feel.  Naturally, I couldn't see myself having more than (n)one of these -- at most. I have a pretty wide range of tastes for beer, but this one just didn't fit into it.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,purplehops,3.95,"Expedition Stout pours a jet black with no and I mean no head of any form or fashion. Carbonation is unheard of here. Lacing? Not a chance. The aroma is molasses and alcohol with some faint herb and medicinal offerings. The taste starts with a syrupy sweetness that quickly melds into coffee and bitter black malt flavors. This is followed by flavors of barley, caramel, and some hints of fruit such as apple and pear. The finish is dry with flavors of French Roast coffee and black malt. Aftertaste is coffee and alcohol with first notes of hops starting to make an appearance. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with quite a bit of weight to it. Overall a stout with great taste characteristics but, in my humble opinion, not enough complexity to carry off the lack of carbonation and the dense syrupy body. Perhaps it needs this density to balance the 10% alcohol. Personally this stout feels a bit dead to me. Don't get me wrong I would buy it again given the chance but it would only be drunk on the coldest winter night by the fire after a great dinner.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,StevieW,4.82,"12 oz bottle. Nothing on the opening, not even a whisper. I've heard the reports, read the reviews about the lack of carbonation, is it flat ? is it made that way ? That's subject to debate I guess. But, it doesn't bother me. Murky darker than the inside of a stovepipe. Thick and dense. Flat, viscous, full fledged motor oil viscosity. Slick is an understatement. Nearly molasses like, much like Utopias MII without the maple syrup and vanilla, or the alcohol burn. A few bubbles cling together on the side of glass, like the Chess team at the homecoming dance, they never make it alone, nor do they create any action. Smell is an earthy full combination of burnt fruits, figs, plums, and maybe some carmel apples. Initial taste is full of roasted bitter malt. Bitterness, beyond regular coffee, this is burnt espresso, the Starbucks guy run amok. Hints of chocolate malt, extremely smooth. Some hops whisper by, lots of them, cascade, who knows, theres a bunch. Then after the flavors slip a highly charged shot of hop bitterness. Striking, and attacks the inside of the mouth, puckering. Flat, lifeless carbonation, any glass swills yeild only the smallest, individual bubbles. High alcohol leaves no trace either feel or taste wise. Just a sublte belly warming comfort it. Slick, with a resiny hop induced, Celebration Ale stickiness to it. The ultimate experience beer, or after dinner beer. I almost want to visit the North again in the winter to truly experience this one. Maybe not, I'll just turn the AC down low and enjoy this one. What an experience...again earns my highest compliment......Magic in a glass !",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,tavernjef,5,"Color is a deep, deep, brownish-black with a deeper purple like tone in certain lighting and is absolutley thicker then all hell. Put it up to the light, nothing? I must have a brand new batch, cuz the super dark tan head grew fast up the edge of the glass. One of the darkest heads I've ever seen, very dark tan-chocolatey brown and it is nice and frothy with some bigger bubbles on the opposite side from which I poured it. Some large patches of tight tan lace cling forever. Eventually the head shrunk down leaving a nice settled coat of caramel colored head just on top. Overwhelming aroma of chocolate, molasses, corriander, and licorice, very warm and alcoholic in back on bigger whiffs. Has an extremely fresh quality, very lightly hinted dark roastyness and coffee. Taste is damn good, super smooth and silky, nicely coats and has a bit of sweet bitterness in the finish. Heavily roasted malt with some coffee and lots of dark chocolate in there. Some spices play underneath of nutmeg, white pepper, yeasty stuff, and corriander The feel is nera perfect for a Imp. stout, very smooth, rich, silky, bold, and heavy, hardly any carbonation really and has a nice little sweet twinge in the finish and leaves your tongue with a bit of bitterness on it. This an amazing brew and is very soothing to drink. That powerful 10% is hardly noticeable in the smell or taste, but its there. It sinks in about 3/4 of the way through.

287,1444,aaronh,4.79,"After several beer expeditions over the previous few months, the time has come for an Expedition beer. Once it is time to embark, I remove the beer from the fridge. I gradually leverage the bottle cap open. It turns over with little protest, yet seems strangely silent. As I gradually start the pour, something seems amiss. I push the accelerator and roughly finish the pour. Oh no! Do I have a flat?! Something's not right! I stop, and gaze at the level of liquid in the glass. A fine bead of bubbles rings the glass, as a few larger bubbles surface on one side. I tentatively raise the glass and give it a slight swirl. A small ring of very fine carbonation surfaces. Phew! Maybe a little low on air, but not a flat. Probably due to the cooler temperatures at the start of the trip. I decide it's time to move on.  As I settle in for the journey, I roll down the windows a bit to partake of the wonderful scents of nature. Black chocolate, plums, molasses, and toasted marshmallows are on the breeze. Did someone have a campfire with smores nearby? Then I notice a hint of alcohol in the air as well. Maybe its just me; Ive been known to think of alcohol of all sorts, and at the strangest times. As I travel to an unknown place (as most of my expeditions start), I take a look in my stash to see what there might be to eat. Ahh, one of my favorites, dark chocolate. Mmmmmm. I love these treats that are chewy with all kinds of taste! That smoky roasted marshmallow pops back into my mind again, so I reach back into the bag to find all kinds of dark, ripe fruits.  After a while, I feel a need for a bit more sustenance. I take a big bite, and discover a bit of bitter spices in a thick molasses and chocolate sauce. I take a sip of coffee with a bit of whiskey to wash it down. Who put this sweet cream in my coffee! I can tell it's there by the way it coats my throat and has that silky feel to it. I've gotten so wrapped up in all the different taste experiences on this expedition that I've forgotten where I'm going! Oh well, I don't mind. I'll make this a long trip, because who knows when I'll get another? But I could definitely take another one of these any time. What a great trip this is! Thanks to cretemixer for supplying the compass. This Expedition won't steer you wrong, although you may find yourself a bit lost. Lost to the world while you're enjoying the trip, and then again feeling lost when it's over, not knowing when you'll take another trip like this one again.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bierman9,4.44,"Damn! Had you set a glass down of this in front of me I would have said that this was my homebrew Russian Imperial Stout. It was almost identical!! Start with the pour. Came out like motor oil. Black, black, black....and with no head at all!! Exactly like my homebrew. I figure I did not let mine condition at room temp enough, and the cold cut-off any carbonation. Just like this bier. No carbonation, head, or lacing at all. The nose was roasty, rich, and exhibited dark fruit notes. Mmmmm!! The mouthfeel was nice!!!! Medium to full body, with a real smooth feel on the tongue. Again, NO carbonation whatsoever... Flavor was rich, full-flavored....coffee, roasty....dark fruit flavors like figs, currants and raisins.... with a bit of a hoppy finish. Way good!! Again, SOOO much like my homebrew. Does that mean my brew is real good, or is this bier lacking something...lol???  Still, enjoyed verrry much!! Thnx to jeffboo!!

Aromas of coffee, chocolate and molasses emerge from the glass. The initial taste seems to complement the aromas, but with a strong taste of alcohol that was extremely overpowering, almost medicinal. Maybe my taste buds havent progressed enough for this one. I just couldnt see myself drinking this on a regular basis. By having such high ratings, I guess I just expected more out of this one.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,AtLagerHeads,4.85,"Wow! I've been waiting to get my hands on this beer for some time because it's from a neighboring state and has legendary reviews and ratings. Everything I've read has been impressive and so is this beer. It is without question one of the most full-bodied beers I can imagine being brewed. My first bottle poured an absolutley non-light-transmitting black with a quarter inch head that lingered for about one minute and one sip. The head was thick, creamy, and dark tan to light brown in color. The lacing was light and not clingy but lasted throughout the glass. Expect to pay $2.50 to $3 a glass at the beverage outlet.  This is a full night's beer. The taste overwhelms the taste buds and it has an immediate impact on the senses. I found the aroma to be on the light side initially, but very rich and caramelly. As the glass warmed the aromas strengthened and became much more pronounced. The taste is very full; again it overwhelms the senses with its complex blend of tastes that start somewhat sweet at the front, but end very bitter at the back. The aftertaste starts very bitter but begins to mellow to a bit of a tangy licorice spiciness as the bitters lighten. To call this a creamy, full-bodied beer is indeed an understatement. This is really rich stuff and not to be taken lightly. Wear a seatbelt and designate a driver before you sample this baby!

It is a sweet aroma. Licorice, malt and alcohol meet your nose. Maybe some chocolate present. Zero on the hops, but Im sure they are somewhere.   The taste is unreal. The sweet licorice flavor moves quickly to hint of malt and then the alcohol hits and warms the belly. Then there is a slight bitter finish in the back of your mouth. Maybe there are the hops? This stout sits heavy on the pallet.  This is a very hard beer for me to rate. Why, I dont know. Maybe due to its sweetness or the alcohol punch, I couldnt drink more than 2.

I was a bit surprised by this stout's appearance and thought perhaps I had an ""off"" bottle, but after glancing at a few reviews, my bottle sounds typical. This stout poured black like soy sauce with almost no foam whatsoever, despite coaxing. The surface was shiny and mirror-like. The smell was rather strong: dark roasted malt, caramel, nuts, and a whiff of alcohol. The taste was very full: initial sweetness turns to hop bitterness and then to nutty coffee mellowness and finally finishes with a long lasting lingering hoppy flavor. Wow! This is a complex stout. The mouthfeel was full, and the flavors coat the mouth and roll around. Slightly warming, but no carbonation at all. The drinkability was good. This stout was full of good flavors, but I can't help but think that some carbonation would really improve it.  Thanks to feloniousmonk for this bottle!  Sampled another bottle 9/26/03  Fairly similar to the first bottle. No carbonation at all (obvious from the moment the cap was removed). Some small foam with coaxing. The smell had notes of figs and raisins, dark caramel, and cocoa. Tastes of roasted barley, bitter coffee, dark molasses, and caramel were detected. Other than this, very similar to the other reviewed bottle. Scores adjusted.

Nose has the aroma of bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, sweet malt, and black strap molasses, what a treat to sniff this magnificent beer. Start is cotton candy sweet, the malt thick and heavy upon the palate, the top thick as a piece of chocolate fudge, the finish delicately carbonated the hops spiteful in their spicy bite, the alcohol quite evident in the bitter dry aftertaste.

No light gets through this beer, its the thickest I've seen. Totally opaque. I usually pour it roughly so the head amounts to a little more than it normally would. It disappears none the less. The head is real chocolatey and also coffee-like. Taste follows the nose. It tastes very chocolatey at first and then you can pick up on its heavy coffee notes and maltiness. Good mouthfeel.

I thought maybe I had a ""old"" sixer because of the lack of carbonation. Smelled like a, oh hell, I forgot to smell it, but then again, my sence of smell is trashed due to, well I won't go into my life story! I don't think it had much smell to it.  Taste was like a ""stout"" no doubt about er, very complex taste. Hoppy, malty, STRONG alcohol content which I felt! Flat as my ""love life""!

It got tastier as I went, and left me feeling no pain. Quite bitter, with some chocolate sweetness. I'm glad I got to try this (thanks, Monk).

The night had been pitch black, with the weight and substance of melted dark-chocolate; despite the thinness of the air and the lack of clouds.  As I stuck my nose out of the tent, I smelled the smoky aromas released by the cooking fire, and I could detect the beckoning smell of sweet, strong coffee wafting across the South Col campsite. I picked up a cup and filled it with the unctuous fluid and took a sip. I could tell Sambhu had added some cocoa in addition to the sweetened condensed milk enhancing the body. The strong brew opened my eyes. Sonam proffered a pull-top can, which I popped open, discovering a compote of stewed fruit. The treacly syrup covered lovely raisins, prunes, apricots, and bananas; balancing the coffee&#8217;s astringency. A nice start. I would need the energy for the rest of the day. Climbing the mountain no longer seemed as daunting as it had yesterday.  Package: 12oz. brown bottle, no ABV or date information listed. Simple but elegant white label depicting compass-points.  Cost: Trade with Sidabeef7 who noted it as $14.99 a 6-pack  Presentation: Imperial Pint glass at 50º  Appearance: A super-viscous pour, resulting in only a brief head. Darkest brown.  Smell: Rich and subtle. Sweet roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee and dark fruits. Some Madeira-like alcohol notes.  Taste: Surprising. In a role reversal, this was sweeter than the Double Cream Stout, almost like a super-ABV Mackesons or a World Wide Stout, although the alcohol is well-masked. This exhibited a decidedly sweet character, more than any other Imperial I&#8217;ve tried. Well-balanced, with flavors of coffee, roasted malt, stewed fruits, a distinct nuttiness and enough edge to be interesting. Hops present, but not assertively at the forefront. None of the sourness some have described as common to Bell&#8217;s stouts. Extremely long, dark finish.  Mouthfeel: Sweetly viscous. A full-bodied, warming stout that is very satisfying. The light carbonation lasted throughout the beer.  Drinkability: What to say? Not something you&#8217;ll have many of in one sitting, but disappears from the glass all too quickly.  Bottom Line: Storm King, although different, doesn&#8217;t even compare. I only wish the carbonation were a bit stronger.

Taste is also a 5 to me now, but this stuff is just too thick so I have to drop .5 for drinkabiity and mouthfeel. Still, this is one of the best imperial stouts out there on the market!  Like the previous reviewer my bottle was also very flat. Rendering me with only an almost inaudible 'pfft' as I popped the cap. This beer poured as dark as darkness itself but unfrotunately for me, it had no head. The aroma was a little intense at first, but as this beer warmed up you could small dark roasted flavors, malts, chocolate, candies, and fruits...very nice. The taste was, of course, exceptional but the mouthfeel was a little too thick for the low carbonation of this bottle. This has a good drinkability and it is one of my favorite Imperial Stouts by far. If I could get this with a nice head on it and some more carbonation it would probably rate all 5's.

Swirling releases deeply burnt malt and rich bittersweet dark chocolate notes, with buttery malt and nutty, caramelized toffee and brittle emerging late in aroma. Fruitiness is aroma is quite mild, and consists of mellow, dried date and prune notes. Quite similar to Third Coast Old Ale aromawise, but with a obviously pronounced roasted barley character. Quick waft of heaty ethanol and higher alcohols. Treacle laced sweetness bathes the palate at first, then is superceded by a drying combination of carbonaceous roasted barley and sharp, but clean hop bitterness. Malt sweetness resurfaces as hop bitterness diminishes, taking on a concomitant milk chocolate like and ripe prune character, which lend a candied, cocoa sprinkled plum impression mid palate. Full bodied, with a dextrinous mouthfeel that lacks liveliness that would otherwise be present with greater carbonation. Ghostly undertone of citric hops. Finishes slowly and long, with lingering dark chocolate and maple sap like sweetness. Wow-- Expedition Stout embodies the style. Rich, balanced, intense, yet very drinkable.

Aroma is a dark and foreboding roasty smell with some black coffee and dark chocolate. The aroma really did not prepare me for how strong this beer is. Somehow the smell does not warn you of the sinister alcohol content that waits to pounce on you the second you take your first sip. Flavors of alcohol, coffee, roasted malt and burnt wood.

The first sip coats my mouth and oozes down my throat warming everything as it goes down. A ""belly warmer"" as Gusler calls it. Bitter chocolate like fine Dutch cocoa is at the forefront, currants and port wine follow behind. The carbonation is not apparent unless you just let a swallow sit in your mouth for a while.

287,1444,ZAP,5,"The King of Imperial Stouts in my opinion....we did a blind taste test a few years back and everything else paled in comparision..this is thick...rich...and chewy....black in color with a tinge of ruby red...no light gets through....the nose is sweet dark fruits, burnt malts, dark cocoa, and alcohol...mouthfeel is not quite as overbearingly thick as I remember...don't get me wrong because it is thick, but it is surprisingly drinkable...taste mimicks the nose. The dark cocoa and burnt malts emerge at first but as it warms it I get more of the sweet dark fruits....finishes with a dry bite...outstanding beer..among the best I've tried...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,zerk,4.1,"I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of Imperial Stouts... they are usually too powerful flavorwise for me to really enjoy. Having said that, there is absolutely nothing I can fault in this beer... black as can be, with a thick reddish brown head that leaves a ton of lace on the glass. Aroma is full of complixety... coffee, chocolate, cherries, port wine... and on the first sip, I was knocked to my knees with flavor... it began with some sweet and sour port-like flavors... then the chocolate and rum, finishing with creamy and bitter coffee. It feels thick and oily in the mouth, but has quite a bit of carbonation. This is a HUGE beer, and not something you drink quickly. Even though I don't really care too much for the style, I can definately appreciate the craft and care that went into making this fine brew.  ------  Reveiw edited on Jan 22, 2003  ------  Although I still find this to be a fine beer, I'm altering the scores based off of a blind veritcal tasting against other Imperial Stouts. Expedition was basically middle-of-the-pack for the style, in my mind.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,MJR,4.9,"Appearance: Blacker than any other stout I've ever encountered...no light gets through at all. A massive head forms as the bottle is poured and stays a good size the whole time.  Smell: All kinds of aromas here: roasted grain, burnt malt, chocolate, molasses, and a bit of licorice. I could be happy just smelling this beer...well, almost.  Taste: The flavor is just as complex as the smell. There is just so much flavor in here, novices are warned to stay away! There's a 'huge' malt flavor that is balanced quite well with a 'massive' hop bitterness. Starts with a hop tingle on the lips, moves to the malt flavors, then the hop bitterness comes in as you swallow. Amazing.  Mouthfeel: Huge, thick, oily...enough said.  Drinkability: Good for a 10%abv brew that makes 10W30 motor oil seem like water. I can't imagine ever drinking more than, say, 2 of these in one night, but this kind of beer you pull out for special occasions or when the mood strikes you.  My absolute favorite of the style. The shear breadth of this brew is incredible and something every beer lover should try at least once.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Wildman,5,"This beer poured as black as oil and almost the same texture. The head was huge, bubbly and a very dark brown color, leaving some nice lace. The aroma was amazing and had many things going on. I detected chocolate, coffee, anise and other smells. The flavor was of chocolate and burnt coffee. The finish included some of the burnt aspect. This is an amazing stout and another fine addition to the Bell's line. I am just sorry that living in Ohio(next door)it took me and the state this long to get it. This one is not for the weak and definately a sipping style of beer best done in a snifter. The amazing impact it does on all sensory levels still amazes me, even the off year with no carbonation.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,mjohn27603,4.9,"From 12 oz bottle no best before date. Pours black as asphalt, very opaque. As Spinal Tap might say, ""None blacker."" Head developed very big oozing over the edge of the glass and unfortuantely wasting some. Aroma is of figs, roasted malt, raisins, and licorice. Taste has lots 'o stuff going on. The beer is sweet, roasty, and bitter all at the same time. A warming alcohol presence is felt. I'm getting a flavor almost like raspberry with chocolate. The only reason it doesn't give 5's all around is I couldn't imagine having more than one so drinkability is less than perfect.  By the way, if you are looking for a special treat I recently attended a beer class at Henry Ford Museum where the dessert course was an Expedition Stout Float. They added a scoop of vanilla ice cream to Expedition Stout and it was truly a great ending to a meal. I know it is hard to sacrifice one for an experiment but if so inclined give it a try.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Realale,4.9,"This example was cellared for about two and a half years.  Absolutely opaque black color. Can't see any light through it even when held up to a 225 watt light bulb.  Head was a little less than in the past, but a persisitent espresso-crema-like cap of foam is there and remains throughout the pint.  The nose is roasty coffee and chocolate with incredible sweet fruity notes of dates and dried cherries. There is no hop aroma, but a definite bitter note exists in the nose.  Amazingly thick and rich on the palate, but a very fine beaded carbonation keeps it from being too much. There is a ton of malt character, but its not sweet, and its well-balanced by a coffee-like bitterness. In fact, the lingering impression is one of bitterness, but the good kind that just keeps making you reach for another sip.  Simply stated, a triumph of the brewer's art. IMHO this is even better than a bottle sampled from this six pack about five months ago - the fruity complexity was much greater here. Still one bottle left, and can't wait for a cold night in front of the fireplace to try it!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Jon,4.53,"Everything about this beer is huge. It pours truly black with a small, brown head that leaves some nice lace. The smell and taste is of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and hops. Just huge on the palate. This is easily Bell's best stout (which says a lot), but it certainly isn't one that I could drink one after another. It's just an excellent imperial stout.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Murph,4.85,"Pours a midnight black with a decent brown head that leaves a great lace all the way down the glass. Smell is of dark chocolate, slightly bitter coffee, raisins, dark fruit and some light toffee as well. Sweet chocolatey goodness starts off this brew with some slight warming alcohol in the background. Raisins and some other sweet, dark fruits are then brought in with a slightly bitter coffee finish. Extremely creamy and smooth, this brew is amazingly drinkable for its 10% abv. The alcohol is barely perceived and then only in its warming effects. This is one great beer, not quite a Storm King, but damn close. I am going to have to get some of this to sip on this winter. A big thanks to Deuce for the sample.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,inebrius,4.42,"Christ it was dark. Dark and damp, but I had to move on. I started by probing the darkness and cutting a swath through the dense roasted barley jungle. Juicy currants bathed my sides and cacao beans landed on my back. Vines of hop wrapped around me in bitter spite but I kept on, through the clouded mire of malt, I kept on. I kept on and a sense of elation had begun to wash over me. It wrapped me up in its warm and furry embrace and I was happy now. It was right and good now. It was Expedition Stout.  Cheers to Deuce for the sample!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,aracauna,4.1,"Imperial Stout Blind Tasting notes (11-16-02): Another no-header. Pitch black. Nice rich aroma, chocolate fruitiness, coffee. The flavor is bitter, nice roasty. Creamy mouthfeel. Smooth.  It didn't matter how hard I poured the beer, there was no head gonna form. This is an intensely black beer that sucks the light from the surrounding aread giving it a sort of dark halo. Light can't even pass through the edges. When you pour, you immediately pick up chocolately, coffeeish aromas before you even lean in for a sniff. Upon closer inspection a bit of caramel can be picked up. The flavor is very similiar to the smell except that it explodes on your tongue and can be overwhelming at first. Huge. It leaves the same aftertaste as dark coffee with cream. The mouthfeel is very creamy and chewy. It's a very rich, dessert-like beer.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Viking,4.73,"Black as pitch? Black as midnight? No, those are understatements. Expedition Stout is the very definition of the color 'black'. And it's got a nice thick, brown head with excellent retention. Few non-nitro brews hold a head like Expedition Stout.  Aroma is filled with rich roasted malt and chocolate, with something spicy which I can't quite place (licorice maybe?) and a bit of coffee and caramel. Very rich and complex, very well blended aroma. Taste delivers everything the aroma offers and more. Roasted malt and chocolate form the base taste, with bitter spice and caramel blending in the middle. Finishes with a fairly strong and bitter coffee taste while holding onto the base flavors.  This beer is thick and oily. Perhaps a bit too thick, but still incredibly smooth. Surprisingly drinkable considering the thickness of the brew along with the high abv (something around 10% I think?). This will certainly be one of the brews I keep around for Sunday breakfast!",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,ADR,4.39,"Crikey, this poured out like dirty oil out of a crankcase! Black as night, dark yellow skim on top. Coffee and lemon aromas, very rich and inviting. Thick, thick, thick mouthfeel... Molasses, some coffee, and a dense and vaguely cherry flavor. Java at the back of the throat. Sharper and a little richer than Storm King, if a tad less flavorful and without the fruitiness. In some ways, a highly unique beer among beers. Bitter as all get out. Skoal on this one. It can come off as unidimensional, and that is something that can annoy me about some Imperial Stouts overall...",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,Bighuge,5,"This beer pours like motor oil. It is midnight black in appearance. Beautiful. With a creamy brown head that has some retention. On the nose, I get deep roasted malt, burnt tones, anise and licorice. Smells great. The sensory overload on the buds with the first taste is incredible. Coffee, cocoa, burnt malt, licorice, dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate and a HUGE bitterness that I love. One thing that I do not note is a significant alcohol taste. (Surprising being that it is 10%.) Saying that this beer has a full body is like saying that Claudia Schiffer is good looking. Both are understatements. This is a brew to behold.  This is the first brew I've rated 5's across the board. (I've reconsidered my stance of not giving all 5's after seeing somebody's opinion that all 5's mean exceptional in every category, but not necessarily the Perfect Beer, which I believe may be impossible to find.)",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,proc,4.78,"Re-rate 1/15/03: What an intense beer. It breaks all rules and it will break your spirit if you aren't ready for it. Pours out to the darkest of dark. Picture being in a pitch black room with no lights. No head to speak of visible. Initial aroma is that of fruit, coffee and molasses. Taste is a veritable explosion starting with plums and raisins and ending with a wonderful hop bite. A beer to sip and enjoy not pound. A beer for serious beer drinkers who have developed thier palates. Excellent.  Original Rating 4/3/02: Out-freakin' standing. Wonderful beer. Dark as the darkest night, with an alcohol presence that lets you know you are going to be warmed up. Very full flavored, with malt that creeps up on you as the beer warms in the glass to the point that you sit back and say...""Wow"". Not a beer that you just open and throw back, but one in which you chill out and enjoy. Excellent.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
287,1444,cokes,4.95,"I am stunned by this amazing concoction. A masterpiece through and through. It is easly the best imperial I have tried. As good, if not better than the much heralded Storm King.  Expedition pours pitch black...light enters but cannot escape. A wispy tan head appears, but the beer itself is hardly carbonated. Makes the mouth feel wonderfully slippery.  Smell is of dark fruit, charcoal, sharp hops and alcohol. Taste contains all of these plus expresso, chocolate, molasses, caramel, and faint vanilla bean. Starts with some burnt sweetness, the comes the onslaught of the hops (cascades?). Even the huge hop profile is quickly buried beneath the avalanche of massive roasted flavors. Alcohol is not too evident (especially for 10%ABV) but provides a delighful warming sensation.  Very well integrated right now, but I can't wait to see how this matures. Kepping my hands off the rest will truly test my will-power.  Update 3.22.03: (2yr old bottle.) Holy shit.",Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,"Michigan, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
