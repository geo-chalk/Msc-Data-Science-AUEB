42,3457,Griffin2,4.16,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass. L - Pours an opaque brown color with a tan head that dissipates quickly leaving a slight ring around the glass. S - Smells of dark fruits, molasses and booze. T - Tastes of raisins and molasses, with some cherry on the finish. F - Has kind of a fizzy carbonation with a medium body. O - Very nice quadrupel.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,izraelc,4,Pours a deep brown. Light foam. Nutty aroma. Sweet fruity body. Warm bread finish. Not too sweet. Smooth for a quad. Makes for a great holiday beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,md3kcn,4.84,"Given to me a couple of weeks ago as a corked bottle by a close friend of mine. Poured into a proper tulip glass.  L - Chestnut red and hazy, with a two-finger faintly reddish-tan head. Head stays awhile. Decent lacing. S - Super complex. Raisin, toffee, cacao. Woodsy. A hint of earth. Burnt sugar. Strong. T - Right off the bat, I'm getting a heavy burnt brown sugar. It eases into a toffee-raisin, followed by a faint hint of allspice. Extremely faint cherry. While I can't taste ethanol, it's definitely present. Well-balanced throughout, and the finish is a dry candied plum. F - Full-bodied, with mild carbonation. Strong. Warming. O - A fantastic representation of the style. Perfect in nearly every way. My biggest gripe however, is the distinct lack of cherry throughout (aside from a faint background note). If you're putting it on the label, I'm going to expect it as a dominant flavor! That aside, this is a crazy good quad to sip on. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Perioddicals,3.98,"L - Poured from a 16 oz. can into an oversized wine glass. Pours a dark brown with reddish hue in the light. Has a tan one finger head. Head quickly dissipates to a ring. Had definite clear alcohol “legs.”  S - Scents start with light malts before dark fruits. Some booziness at 9.7% ABV. A little sugar scent.  T - The dark fruit and specifically cherry flavors are front and center. The alcohol is up front too. A little more bourbon like.  F - Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is cola-like.  O - Overall, this is a quality beer that I recommend trying out. It’s higher ABV is very apparent while drinking and for that reason I don’t think I’ll add it to my regular rotation. Also the cherry flavoring sounds good in theory, but I don’t prefer it in practice. I enjoy other straight-forward Belgian Quadrupels more than this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Vykk_Draygo,4.68,"Opaque reddish brown (colorblind, so best guess) with plenty of sediment. Thick off-white head that dissipates quickly with no real lacing to speak of.  The aroma is rich, tend towards cherry, and dark dried fruits. Sugar, burnt sugar. Moist earth, loam, and wet wood. Cola. Phenolic spice. Buried in there is a creamy oatmeal like aroma, trending towards nutty (like steel cut oats with almond milk). There's also a bit of cocoa powder hanging around the edges.  Taste is faithful to the aroma, just bigger and more intense. It leans heavily toward cola, even having a similar lingering sweet bitterness. It's almost bourbon like (Knob Creek), but too chocolatey and bitter to do more than insinuate a connection. The finish is rather prune like, and slowly fades to a lingering bitterness of hops and cocoa powder. Alcohol is apparent, but in a pleasant way (again, like with a good bourbon). As it warms, you get more fermentation funk (in a good way), and malty sweetness.   There is a lot going on here. Each sip is different as it warms. It's like a journey in a glass, and it's well worth taking. Delicious beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,CuriousAgilist,5,"The pour and the head is spectacular and very aggressive (quite a head; don't over pour or you're sure to waste some). The aroma of that first pour, especially into a chilled/frozen standard beer glass, is not to be missed. Everything there on out is just as enjoyable right up until you have to decide: ""Shall I have another?""",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,highdesertdrinker,4.35,"Pours the typical plum color with a tan head, it looks like a quadruple or a strong ale. Smells like cinnamon, raisins, with a whiff of alcohol. Tastes like cinnamon, raisins, sugar, malty, with a little burn. Not quite as good as the Belgian standards but it’s a tasty beer and has it’s own personality, cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,MNAle,4.19,"Surprisingly (to me), the head is short and very short-lived, despite as vigorous a pour as I could manage in the small 250ml chalice. While it lasts (look quickly), the head is a light tan color and bubbly. It quickly shrinks into sparse islands (and, then, also fairly quickly, disappears altogether), leaving a tea-like appearance. Dark reddish-brown from the front becomes a hazy bright ruby with a backlight. Active carbonation (also short-lived, though) rises to cause the islands to swirl around a bit. The color is great looking. Unfortunately, that is all that is great about the look.  Nice aroma, strong at first (I picked it up as soon as I cracked the can) but becomes pretty weak once the head is gone. I had to swizzle it to get a good whiff. Dark fruit, sweet candy, cherries. (Since I could tease an nice aroma with a swizzle, I didn't penalize the ""smell"" rating due to the limitation of the head - that was taken care of in the ""look"" rating.)  The flavor is very nice. Dark fruit, of course, sweet sugary candy, cherries-slightly tart. Spicy - coriander, perhaps some clove. No bittering. The middle exposes a malty foundation lending some needed gravitas to the beer. The interplay of the flavors never actually blends, but they do play off of each other very nicely. This is an excellent-tasting sipping beer, with lots going on in the flavor to keep me interested. The alcohol comes through into the flavor at the ~⅓-point of the beer and lingers through the remaining time. The finish is - oddly - a blend of sweet and dry. The candy bringing the sweet, and the cherries bringing the tart-dry.  The body is thinner than I expected for such a strong beer, and the feel is flat despite the initially active carbonation (which, as I mentioned above, seems to have disappeared along with the head). The feel ends up being a bit annoying (that is, for a flavor that is so great, there is a feel is so meh).  Overall, this beer might have among the widest variation among my rating of the individual elements (3.25 to 4.5), but the ones that count the most are the highest, so overall, it ends up at a weighted rating of 4.19. But, somehow, a bit of a disappointing 4.19.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,shu,4.74,Intro description is pretty accurate. Heavy on the dark dried fruit. Feel and head is abbey style. Not a go to beer but def worth indulging. Seems a good winter holiday selection.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Iamaskier,4.08,"Hazy light brown body, with a fizzy head. Smell is deep and sweet; roasted malt, caramel, raspberry, pepper, hints of spice and esters, a bit of chocolate. Taste is also fairly sweet; immediately comes the spice, with coriander, and pepper; orange peel and citrus too, followed by a strong malty backbone. The kriek comes out on the finish, with cherry and raspberry that add a sweet balance to the upfront spice. Fairly high carbonation, and the ABV is quite noticeable. This is bigger than I expected, and while I very much enjoy the complexity it comes off a tad unbalanced.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,klarcbarr3,3.94,"Three Philosophers pours a medium, cloudy brown beneath an off-white two finger head. Actual chocolate flakes do float about the bottom of the glass, the cherry ale lightens the color and eye appeal of this brew. Chocolate, cherry, almond and sugary notes create a parfum more admirable for complexity than actually enjoyable. The taste is perplexing. The chocolate and cherry flavors stand apart, rather than melding. Hops, malt, and an overbearing fruit sweetness collide to create a delicate, fussy, overthought delight, with a saccharin mouthfeel aftertaste, much like marzipan. I never understood the appeal of marzipan. Pretty much the same here. I get the mission, I sense quality ingredients. It just doesn't ring my bell.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,cwm51662,4.23,"As I scroll down the reviews, I see a lot of variation. This one's a dark amber, lots of sediment, which ain't a bad thing. Prune, cherry, and tang (not the orange juice) are noticeable first, then a sticky thickness. THEN the alcohol (again, not a bad thing. Notes of bread on the back channel. I had a 4-pack a while back and forgot to review, enjoyed it then and now. A lot like an unsweetened thick cider that's fermenting to alcohol instead of vinegar.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ATL6245,4.32,"Appearance: Dark brown, tan colored mousse-like head, tight compact bubbles with excellent retention.  Aroma: Yeast forward, bubble gum is prominent. Caramel. Dark fruit.  Flavor & Aftertaste: Alcohol noted. Some chocolate notes mixed with caramel. Faint, mild cherry flavor. Dry start to finish.  Mouth-feel: Light to medium bodied, high carbonation.  Overall: Demonstrates quite a jarring bite between the higher ABV & high carbonation. Gets your attention. Label mentions cherries, but that's pretty well hidden in there. But, as you drink it, you start noticing the tart, sour finish. Highly effervescent. Visually, it promotes a lengthy, creamy looking head, more so than most beer styles. I'll admit, this beer is not my normal cup of tea. But, it's interesting and a nice change of pace. Not quite sure where it fits into my seasonal/regular beer routine. Well worth a shot.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,sulldaddy,4.43,"I cannot believe Ive never reviewed this beer! I used to drink the 750 corked and caged bottles of this beer on the regular! Tonight I have a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. The beer pours a rich mahogany color with deep garnet undertones when held up to the light. A dense creamy beige head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a very sturdy surface layer that sticks around through the sampling. Aroma on this one features some toffee and brown sugar and a bit of tart cherry note. Almost a little funky too, but no hop notes and the abv is well hidden at this point. First sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly, yet soft carbonation. The beer feels a little slick, I expected and remembered more of a sticky feel, but its what Ive got right now. Flavor is some brief brown sugar and a bit of dark fruit, raisins mostly. This rolls to some faint tart cherry notes and a little bit of a black peppery bite, which I attribute to the ABV. Even with this bite, the drying finish encourages me to take another sip, which gets me to emptying my glass much to quickly. QUite a nice beer that Im glad to have revisited. Definitely a classic and one I will gladly drink again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,VTbrewfan,4.38,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Teku glass. Deep mahogany in color, fluffy white head, slowly receding. Watch that pour because this guy will get a little out of control. Scents of raisins, dates, prune juice and red wine. Flavors of baking spice, oak, brandy, dark cherries, prune, fig. It’s funny, I’ve been drinking 3 philosophers for years now but just realized I have never rated it. First time I’ve tried it from a can- no discernible difference from bottles but I also haven’t tried them head to head. I do appreciate the pint vs ~12 oz volume though- basically the same price between 4 cans and 4 bottles but going to have a nice buzz on by the time I’m done drinking a pint! Maybe the best Belgian style beer I’ve had from the US. I always like to pick up some of these when the weather starts getting cold and reminds me of decorating the Christmas tree.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,NCSapiens,4.18,"For my money this is as good as an American Belgian style beer can get. I tried this for the first time about 10 years ago, somehow never reviewed. I saw it in the local gas station in Delhi NY, about 30 minutes from the brewery. I knew nothing about it, but it was the only craft beer available, so I bought a six pack (well truthfully I also bought a sixer by Saranac, but that is an entirely different story). Needless to say I wasn’t expecting much. When I poured the first bottle into a goblet, it had a billowing three finger frothy head and gorgeous brown color with ruby highlights. Next I discovered a pleasant cherry and malt aroma. Then I had the first sip, and I couldn’t believe my taste buds. Cherries, plums, raisins, molasses, a subtle bread-like yeast, and a nice malt backbone. I took another sip, and it was just as good. Somehow the beer I bought between the Miller and Bud at my crappy local gas station was clearly a world class beer. I had previously lived in Colorado, and enjoyed New Belgium, but this was better! These days Ommegang is nationally known because of its Game of Thrones beer. But 3 Philosophers is truly the one and only king of American made Quads.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,spectru,3.9,"August 13, 2021 - Opaquish dark copper color, nice cream color head slowly recedes to a cap, and then to a ring, no lacing; A noticeable aroma - citrus tangy, fruity; Mouthfeel is quite good; The flavor is odd, and leaves a yucky aftertaste? Well, let's see if it grows on ya. It is robust. And sour, but not too sour, but it has a bad flavor I can't name. I do not like it.  August 20, 2021 - Second bottle much better. Whatever that bad taste was it didn't recur. So its not bad. The 9.7 ABV is quite noticeable, not in the flavor, but in the effect. So I must have gotten a skunky one before. I raised the score for taste and overall.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,reknirdsuomynona,4.36,"Poured from a pint can into a pint mug  L - Clear amber in color. Substantial light tan head three-fingers thick which settles to a complete and persistent layer. Lacing is present thanks to the thick ring of foam along edges of the glass though the head is so thick it takes a while to display. Looks like a glass of honey.  S - The cherry aroma is at the forefront. Very strong and sweet. Malt of brown sugar/molasses on the backend. No hops to be found. Smells just like a holiday fruitcake. Not detecting the typical notes found in lambics however.  T - A cornucopia of flavors intermingling. It's very hard to nail down individual ones. The typical fresh tartness and earthiness of the kriek yeast are dominant on the palate. It's sweet but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Fruitcake in a glass would be a fair comparison. Cinnamon spices and brown sugar mix expertly with the cherries. There is a slight medicinal quality that a bit off-putting, possibly from the high gravity. Some may like that, but I don't. Thankfully it doesn't mar the experience too much.  F - This is a big boy. Each sip of this syrupy brew is like a bite of food. Very heavy body, carbonation level is medium but suitable for this. Probably best to drink this one on its own. You won't have much room for food otherwise.  Ommegang really delivered on this one. Will definitely get it again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,1BrewBacca,4.31,Look: I believe this appears to be the quintessential Quadruple Ale. Deep amber liquid with a creamy yellowish head that tames down to a thin foam layer with nice lace on the glass. Smell and Taste: Roasted malts and cherries. Feel: 9.7% ABV is a perfect setting for this brew. Leans toward the high end on the carbonation scale but it's not overbearing. Overall: Got to stick with the taste grade on this one. A very good Quad.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,hreb,4.22,"An old classic. Haven't had this in years... but how did I manage to avoid reviewing it a decade a ago? 750mL cork-and-cage topped bottle served in a Chimay chalice. Beer is deeply hued brown and forms a thick chestnut head which gradually falls. Aroma is intruiging with cherry, oak, and the distinct twang of Belgian yeast.  Flavor has an immediate fruity taste of kriek. Sweet red cherries, but also raisins and brown sugar. Complimented exquisitely by dark malt flavors, bread and treacle. The mouthfeel is outstanding, smooth and weighty, punched up more by the allspice and clove spicy flavors than carbonation.  Out of all of Ommegang's mainstay beers, I'm probably most likely to pass over this one because I'm so rarely in the mood for a cherry beer. But that doesn't detract one bit from how delicious it is.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,rawbraves,4.68,"So, I’ve had some of the best Belgian Quads in the world, Lindemans Kriek and plenty of beers on bourbon barrels and lots of good bourbon. I’d say this is a near perfect combination of them all. I can taste the raisiny character of the quad and cherry hints from the kriek. If had one complaint it would be it’s a little heavy on the bourbon barrel. Not really a complaint but wish it didn’t partially hide the excellent flavors in the other ingredients.

Bigger alcohol and phenols than Abt. 12, my only other experience with a true quad. Lingering phenolic finish.  M: this is where these quads amaze me, sweet, phenolic and boozy, but they are crisp, clean, and effervescent.  Overall: I’ve waited a long time to try this beer, wanted it for a while.

42,3457,Jaysauras,4.52,"L: Really have always loved the quad look. Enjoyed in a tulip glass with a wonderful deep red clay color. Looks dark, but deceives in a way with the flavor. Head was creamy, island-like, evident but not excessive, dissipated quickly.  S: Sweet liquor, wood, and cherries. A wonderful mixture.  T: This is such a complex and enjoyable beer. It's a combination of the booze you'd expect from a quad, the sweet cherry flavor you'd expect from a novelty beer, but the craftsmanship of a finely brewed barrel aged. There's also a surprising malt and chocolaty finish to the beer that puts a nice bow on everything. You get sweet up front, you get woody oak middle, and a great malt and chocolate finish.  F: I don't give many 5s because it's hard to believe a ""Perfect"" score exists, but for a 9.7% beer, this is artisan level. It smells and feels like a lighter beer despite it being a near 10% BA quad. It's drinkable in all of the best ways. The fruit isn't overpowering, it's crisp, it's somewhat lighter in feel, but it's a complex finish that urges further drinks without being too heavy to bog you down with any sort of overpowering flavor or feel.   O: Just a wonderfully crafted beer. Hits on a lot of traditional quad beer feels without the downside of a boozy high % belgian. It adds cherry and a delectable complexity of flavors without letting one thing dominate, nor go unnoticed. It's one of the most drinkable BA Quads i've ever had, with a flavor that is up there with one of the most simple, yet complex and well executed ones I've ever had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,notjaredlouche,4.52,"2015 bottle received as a workplace Secret Santa gift probably in that same year. Opened this on Super Tuesday 2020. Served at winter room temperature (67F currently), not 50F as recommended on bottle, and in Ommegang large snifter-type glass included with gift box that the bottle came in.  Pours easy (slowly, but not too slowly per bottle recommendation), less carbonation than expected, tiny one-finger head that vanishes quickly. Lacing is very slight at the top of the liquid when swishing, but dissipates almost instantly. Looks dark, but deep red when held up to the light.  As for smell, I don't exactly have a golden nose, but it's a pleasant, vaguely fruity smell. Little to no alcohol smell.  Tastes vaguely of cherries, sweet, mild tartness, a little bourbon-y too on the back end.  Smooth in the mouth, low but noticeable carbonation. No alcohol burn, goes down almost too easily. Sweet enough to make your lips sticky.  First time trying one of these, always heard this talked up as the pretentious but amazing quad to end all quads, but never tried it in 10 years of being old enough to drink. Was trying to save this bottle for a special occasion, but figured a disappointing Super Tuesday was good enough reason to bring it out. Would be curious to compare to a fresh bottle, or one aged even longer, like I see in some of the other reviews (2007, wow).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,graysonslamsbrews,4.42,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. For the love of God, respect the label on the side that says ""pour slowly"". Look: Cherry sunburst on a Les Paul when held up to a weaker light source, but looks pretty dark - almost stoutlike to the unaware consumer. Big pieces of sediment floating in the haze. Sediment is lifted by strong carbonation. Hefty, dark yellow caps on waves of head. Smell: Definitely a strong cherry aroma but with a certain sweetness, like a cherry DQ milkshake. Caramel and brown sugar malt tones peek through I suspect. Strong alcohol scent the further you get into it. Taste: There's a pronounced sweetness, but in a different way than I expected. It's more malted sweetness dominated than fruity sweetness dominated, so it's more representative of raisin than cherry when tasting. Definitely, spices push through as well. Sweet in a way where you would end a night on this beer, rather than start one. Although the bottle itself is maybe a pregame to a pregame. Feel: It's got a nice, gentler carbonation on the mouth, but is certainly present. Has a tingling, numbing sensation that is pleasant from the alcohol and carbonation.  Really interesting complex brew that also appeals to other fruit beer lovers. Kind of wish I was eating pancakes with this beer. I might just be drunk, though.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TheGent,4,"Look: Murky and translucent. Deep and dark amber - light brown color with a ton of sediment as I drained the entire bottle into my glass. Khaki colored head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer and a thicker ring of foam around the edge of the glass. A small amount of visible carbonation.  Smell: Estery yeast Aromas of pear, raisins and apple. Some rotten fruit too. Dark bread.  Taste: On the tip of the tongue you get sweet some sweet sugary notes that carry through to the middle. The fruits are similar to the aroma, but getting more of the raisin and some light fog flavor. The sweet fruitiness has a little bit of a caramel apple thing going on. The yeast contributes greatly to the flavor. Some overly ripened banana. A touch of woody bitterness in the middle and on the finish. I think there are some cherry notes but they really come through as something like a brandied cherry. Nothing about this beer says kriek, if that’s what you’re looking.  Feel: Medium bodied, semi dry, prickly carbonation. The 9.7% ABV warms the palate perfectly.  Overall: A classic beer. And a great introductory beer for someone new to Belgian style beers. It’s not the most complex of Belgian style beers, but it’s really good. It’s also priced well compare to imports.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Aroma of cherry and other pitted fruit, spicy phenols. Taste is sweet, rich cherry, candi sugar, and spice. A bit of alcohol heat in there too. Pretty clean finish. Feel is medium with decent carbonation that just keeps coming. Overall, I've always enjoyed this beer. I wish the flavor was a bit deeper, but that is a minor bit of personal preference.

42,3457,RaulMondesi,4,"For some reason I kind of came into this beer with different ideas than what it is. Once I read the words “cherries” and “Kriek,” well, I was thinking exactly that. Something more sour and tart. Which is completely the opposite here. I mean, it’d be like if Kim K made a Tinder profile back when she was blonde and not as thick. Then when you show up... wowzer! What a difference. I mean, both versions are worthy, but they just ain’t the same, ya feel me? And right here, we have an almost straight up Belgian Quad with hints of Kriek. It is straight up huge, yet composed like a sailor during a sobriety test. We are talking smooth. It’s super rich, but very earthy. It has some dark fruits, and maybe just a touch of cherry. It’s so beautiful that I would actually put a ring on it (even if it came with a lil soldier from a prior relationship). Think about that. I am willing to “step daddy” this beer.  Yep!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,spdemon91,4.28,"Went to Tanczos looking for an alternative to my favorite beer, Chimay Grand Reserve. Love that beer but don't love the cost. I don't drink that much and don't know that much about beers. Asked for help at the front and the guys there were wonderful. They explained that the reason Chimay is expensive is because of the brewing style being a quadrupel belgian. They listed several others and to my surprise most of those were more expensive than Chimay. Then they referred this one which was about 40% cheaper than Chimay. I gave it a shot and loved it! It is not Chimay but similar. One noticeable difference is that this beer while it only has 0.75% more alcohol than Chimay, it definitely has more of an alcohol smell and taste to it than Chimay. And for me anyway, there was definitely a harder kick to it versus Chimay which goes down so smooth. Still very good and for the price, I would definitely buy again!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The aroma is of Belgian yeast intertwined with tart cherry and toffee notes the tartness of the cherries balance the sweet aroma of the malt nicely. The flavor is rich and complex subtle cherry flavor mixed with malt hints of dark fruit like dates ripe figs plums of dark cherries also prunes or raisins there’s also some brown sugar and molasses flavors it almost comes across as a barrel aged quadruple in that you get a little bit of brandy or some type of barrel aged alcohol notes it all finishes with a slight bitterness which is welcomed to balance out what would be a overly sweet beer if it wasn’t there. 4/5,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,DrBeergood,4.5,"""Serve at 50F""  Sorry, this is America.  The bottle I have is labelled 2017, I'm drinking it June 15th, 2019. The bottle has been abused, subjected to wild temperature variations and exposed to sunlight, but I'm not scared.  The bottle is shaped like it's a quad. The labelling says ""98% quad, 2% ale with cherries added, 9.7% ABV"" So it's honest. It has the appearance of being a sophisticated, but pretentious brew. Pressing on.  Opaque amber in color. I gave it a mild pour, not reading about the yeast sediment until too late. There was some head dissipating into a rim of lacing.  It smells boozy, like a Cabernet Sauvginon. Tangy yeast, possibly cleaved by mishandling. Not to suggest it's hard on the nose, but you don't come across it every day. Onward.  The flavor is dark and delicious. Toasty Roasty malt, molasses, brown sugar, brandied raisins, chocolate, tart cherry. Do I need to continue?  Just read the commercial description, it's spot on. They aren't just making things up. This is for real.  Perhaps, as suggested, such a complex brew, will leave you something to contemplate during a lapse in conversation.  10/10, would recommend, this brew rivals, maybe even surpasses, Stone Arrogant Bastard.

42,3457,Ozzylizard,3.21,"$ 17.00 (Including tax)/4-pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.354/oz) from Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA. Reviewed 6/13/19. Undated other than “2017” as part of the front label design. On shelf at point of sale. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 57 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Appearance – 3.5. First pour – Amber, slight haze. Body – Muddy medium brown. When held to the light, a definite reddish cast is noted. Head – Large (Maximum 7.2 cm, aggressive center pour), tannish, initially medium density but quickly becomes fizzy and opens into low density froth, short retention, diminishing to a three to four mm crown and a thin partial cap. Lacing – None. Aroma – 3 – Begins on a strong sour note but this quickly fades to nothing. No fruit, no yeast, no malt, no phenolics, no alcohol. In fact, after the initial burst of sourness, this settles into a barely detectable generic sweetness. Flavor – 3.25 – Distinct notes of cherry cough syrup. No alcohol taste or aroma (9.7% ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. The alcohol does produce a slight gastric warming. The general maltiness and dark fruit/phenolic/yeasty hints of most quads are absent. Palate – 3.25 – Full, approaching syrupy, somewhat lively carbonation. It leaves my lips sticky.

Rough around the edges at fridge temps with prominent mineral and licorice overpowering the show early on. The aroma opens up before the flavor and tells me this is going to be excellent as it warms. The flavor follows shortly thereafter, showcasing the layers of dark malt and ripe yeast flavors as it nears cellar temps. Sweet and tart...bit of dry bitterness tries to compete for the finish but is outlasted by caramelized sugar, grain, fruity/nutty yeast, and a slight alcoholic heat. Yum.

Dark and sturdy, it has a very, very sweet smell, with a quality Belgian yeast aroma, and later on some notes of dark cherry cobbler. The body is lighter, with a muted, bubbly head on every drink, and lots of dark cherry, fig, blueberries and grape.

42,3457,Myros,3.99,"2017 vintage From a bottle to a chalice. Pours a beautiful ruby brown color, clear but opaque from darkness. Serious effervescence can be seen and heard. A thick, one finger, beige head stayed in place for a bit with spotty lacing as it receded.  Aroma is of sweet, dark fruit; cherry; apple; oloroso Sherry; subtle phenolic spiciness; and mild alcohol.  Taste is cherry prominent, somewhat surprisingly. It has a good deal of complexity outside of the cherry, but definitely secondary to the Kriek. Esters of raisin, plum, and fig are joined by phenols of cinnamon, vanilla, and subtle clove. A malty sweetness prevails with brown sugar and light molasses flavor. A Sherry-like quality is noticeable and pleasant. Alcohol is noticeable as warmth but not in taste, not nearly as much as expected from a 9.7% ABV. The finish is dry and pithy bitter.  Mouthfeel is a lighter than expected medium-full, mouth-coating body with heavy carbonation.  Overall, an exceptional Belgian dark strong ale with a twist of Kriek ale.

Taste is also still up front and personal...with a mild edge with the fruity cherry/prune coming thru & a mild sweetness to it along with some mild funk & a slight roasty edge. The feel follows the taste and I feel better with age...being on the edgey side, but maybe from the nice ABV & carbonation it has...that holds up thru-out that may give the edge as well.

42,3457,jkblr,4.33,"750mL corked bottle 2015 vintage poured into a Chimay chalice at 55F 9.7% ABV. The beer pours bright reddish brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is ripe fruit, more cherry, and brown sugar. The taste is a wonderful mixture of barely tart cherry, caramel, dried fruit, and dark sugar. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium plus carbonation and mostly dry in the finish. There is no appreciable bitterness, but it's not cloying. Overall, excellent. This is a great beer. Recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Pontzie,3.43,Bought from the alewife store in a 4 pack.  L: Pours a dark brownish amber. Opaque. Solid golden head rhat lasted fairly long. Didnt leave any lacing.  S: Yeasty bread and alcohol scented. The sourdough smell had me excited for the first taste.  T: hits that palatte flat and sort of bitter in a stale way. After a few sips and some warming up I start to see more appeal. It holds the high alvobol content well and does start to display a bit of heartiness.  F: The first sip hit all up front and didn't maintain any structure to the back of the palette. Finish is weak and not noteworthy. It does wotk better as it warmed up a bit  O: It is ok. probably not worth going back to as there are other options at this price that have more appeal to me.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

While I do get the expected cherries in the taste there seems to be a lot of apple as well. Woody and smoky undertones.

42,3457,qjholler,4.32,"A) Pours an opaque mahogany with traces of red here and there. Decent tan head recedes quickly, leaving little lacing.  S) Sweet, malty, and somewhat sharp. The smell of cherries is a bit hidden beneath the stronger scents of malt, spices, and booze, but it's certainly there. A very pleasant, inviting smell.  T) Bready and sweet at first, followed by cherries and a slight hint of alcohol. The final notes are not unlike a fine port wine. Each successive sip sees a new flavor brought to the fore, and the interplay between all of them is fantastic.  M) Not quite thin, but very smooth. The carbonation helps the sharper components of the beer prick at the tongue, providing an enlivening combination of sensations. The feel fits perfectly with the rest of the beer.  O) A wonderful quad that I would buy again a lot sooner if it weren't $11 a bottle. Its quality cannot be doubted, but this is one that will have to remain as a rare treat for someone without an abundance of money to spend on beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The crown is bubbling vigorously for about a minute until it calms down and completes into a very dense, tightly formed land of very small bubbles. The smell is cherries with some esters. Some banana as well. Almost like a banana cherry milkshake. The taste is very much the same. Beautiful cherries mix well with banana notes. The feeling is well carbonated making the cherries bounce. Slightly tart from the cherries as well. Overall, good representation of the style. I like it a lot.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

This is my first Quad so I'm not sure about retention for the style, but after about a minute all that was left is a 1/4 inch ring around the edge of the glass. There are a few filmy chunks of lacing left on the glass.  Smell is very nice. Sweet and tart cherry, raisins, caramel, molasses, brown sugar and a touch of spice. Complex and not overly sweet.  Taste is similar, but a bit more sweet. The finish in particular is very heavy on the sweet caramel, but the cherries hold their own and help round it out throughout most of the sip.  Feel is medium bodied and slightly sticky with prickly carbonation.  Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. By the end of the glass it became a touch too sweet for me (not sure if that's just the beer or par for the style) but I still really liked it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

O - Yep, I feel like it's a kriek by a different name. No matter, I really like this beer. Very well blended.

In terms of taste a get a little spice, banana, prune, and a lot of cherry, it is too much cherry for my liking. It feels like it should. Overall, it doesn't quite feel balanced to me.

42,3457,VoxRationis,4.47,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information. A: Pours a hazy to cloudy copper color with modest clearing to an initially one inch, tan head. Retention good, minimal spotty lacing. S: Aromas of molasses, plum, spice (mostly cloves), and rum, but in a complex melange that is well blended and distinct. Maybe a little grainy at the end. T: the flavor of cloves predominates against the malty backbone. A cherry note is appreciable but subtle and nice. Bitterness present and a nice counterpoint to the malt. M: Medium to full bodied. Very good carbonation leaving a tingling on the tongue and palate. Alcohol appreciable, but not overpower. O: Really an inviting, complex Quad. I alway have reservations about fruit additives (outside of say lambics and Berliner Weisse style beers), because I find they often impart sourness to the beer that subtracts from the experience, but here I do think it really delivered. A somewhat different take on the style, clearly, but also definitely a well designed, well crafted one. Kudos!

42,3457,Eddieeight,4.25,So many people love this beer. First quad I've had. Looks dark Amber to brown with a thick creamy head. Smells like dark fruits and leathery. Tastes sweet like cherry up front (kriek added) then gradually fades to a darker burned prune or molasses. Feels fluffy and fuzzy. Someone else described it as dancing in the mouth and I would agree.

A great beer to enjoy slowly and you will notice a sweet cherry aftertaste and a dry finish. I did not get much of a spice in the aroma but for me, I got a cherry and leathery experience. Great balance, wonderful color. A must try for Quad fans.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Malfunkt,4.01,"Ommegang is a fine brewery and this is a complex one. Make sure to serve this one properly and be mindful of your palette. After properly airing and coming down a bit in temperature, this beer tasted great. After some salt organic nachos, not so much, but in the same sitting the taste transformed after eating some hearty stew. Suddenly the cherry notes were abundant.  Hard to say if this was the finest quad I've had, but one thing is for certain, it keeps getting better after every sip.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Dewsby,4.34,"L) Pours an opaque, hazelnut brown with an off-white head.  S) The nose is very strong on biscuit, currant, and a smidgen of molasses. Very pleasant, although I would prefer it stronger in a quad.  T) Everything in the nose is in the taste, with the addition of dark cherry, honey. and a tinge of roastiness. It is quite rich, but well balanced.  F) It has a medium carbonation, and a full-bodied mouthfeel. Not insanely silky.  O) Solid quad and the cherries are quite detectable.

Not memorably good, but good. Dark brown appearance and a delicate aroma, meaning not a whole lot to smell. I do get mild cherry notes... and alcohol.  Flavor is similar. A tad sour, but not off-putting. Carbonation is on the heavy side - a little too tickly.

42,3457,Rufus1,4,Poured medium into a fifteen ounce mug the same temperature as the beer. Pours a reddish brown with small caramel head that lasts. Hazy to opaque. Sticky lacing. Some legs.  Blast of cherry and sweet malts on the nose with an underlying whiff of apricot. Alcohol. Prune?  Taste follows the nose closely. First up is a mixture of cherries and sweet malt. Followed by apricot and dark fruit. Again the prune. Hardly any bitterness at all. The hops are there but not a major flavor component. Boozy.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel with some warming alcohol on the palate. Sweet in the beginning. Ends sweet as well. Definitely hits the Quad mark. A very complex brew. Extremely hard to review. I'll have another go with this later. Cheers!!,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Lone_Freighter,4.49,"Poured into a chalice. The appearance was a dark brown body with light edges near the bottom, one finger foamy off-white head with some light clingy lacing that eventually spider webs a bit. The smell had cherries up front with plums, sugar, Belgian yeast, malts, light booze really faint in the background, cherries continue to dominate as the beer warms. The taste was sweet through all of the previously mentioned flavors and combined eloquently together. The palate was about a medium, not sessionable - good sipper over a period of time, sticky sweet cherry aftertaste and a dry finish. Overall, one of my all time favorite quads brewed by an American brewer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

This fine ale pours a deep and moderately murky ruby tinged brown with a fantastic head of pale tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, thick layer, and showcases some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of brown sugars, rich cherries, leather, dark fruit notes of raspberry, and strong phenol alcohol. Flavors hit the perfect notes with warming cherry and brandy notes touched with raisin and raspberry flavors that are steeped in brown sugars and finishing with a subtle flowery hop flavor mingling with leather and tobacco notes. Excellent medium body, lightly slick warming middle, medium high lively carbonation, and a lightly tart and subtly dry finish with warming booze.

Malt-forward with notes of caramel, milk chocolate, dark fruit (raisins and plums), almonds (amaretto-ish), cherries, bready/toasty pale malts, and yeast funk. Moderate alcohol presence.  Taste: Delicious and complex. Strong and sweet with a faint tartness. The malts and esters dominate the palate. Notes of dark fruit (raisins and plums), caramel, bready/toasty pale malts, cherries, and banana. Some subtle floral and earthy hop-character. The finish is long and well-balanced.  Feel: Medium body with lively carbonation. Creamy with significant alcohol warming and prickliness. Medium-dry and mildly astringent.

Pours a clear, deep-hued amber, taking on a considerably redder tinge when held to the light. The two fingers of loose, soapy, off white-coloured head generated require a few minutes to melt down to a creamier-looking cap and collar about half as high. A classy-looking glass of beer. The nuances of the aroma are subtle, and challenging to identify with specificity - boozy, overripe dark fruit (mostly cherry) is the closest I can muster, with a fair amount of sweet demerara sugar in there, too. Plum, fig, raisin and spicy yeast add depth beyond the cherry - it's a warming, inviting aroma, and the temptation to take a sip is difficult to resist.  Just a superb sipper all around. Candi sugar sweetness is a consistent presence from the start, as a mélange of dark fruit flavours excites the taste buds. Of course, cherry is the most prominent culprit - imparting a subtly tart quality that helps to blunt the saccharinity of the base quad - but I'm also getting hints of raisin, plum, and rich date sweetness by mid-sip, as well as suggestions of banana esters. The spiciness of the yeast begins to assert itself towards the finish, mostly in the form of clove, while a mild dusting of earthy, herbal hops simultaneously settles upon the palate - up until the ethanol starts to warm (and eventually numb) it up. Boozy, fruity, yeasty aftertaste that lingers. Medium-full in body, with sharp carbonation that seems unnecessarily aggressive and, at times, foamy.  Final Grade: 4.25, an A-. Ommegang's Three Philosophers is truly satisfying to sip, and that's good enough for me. The underlying quad is satisfactory, but the kriek blend is what really cements it as a quality Belgian dark ale. The mouthfeel is probably the weakest aspect, but all in all this is still a high quality beer that I highly recommend. Probably the best North American quad I've tried to date - and while I'd still say that all of the top-tier Trappist imports handily outperform it, Three Philosophers is at least well within the vicinity of that same hallowed ballpark. I'll definitely be grabbing a second bottle for the cellar.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Not that there's anything wrong with a sweet quadrupel, but this style succeeds magnificently in itself. The flavours are definitely in line with good Belgian examples of the styles. The carbonation doesn't taste quite as 'bottle-conditioned' as the Belgian quadrupels I'm used to - maybe they gave it a bit of a head start?

Aroma: Probably one of the best smelling Quads I've ever had the pleasure of sampling. Lots of red licorice and candied plums. Tamarind, peat smoke, rye bread, banana, clove, dates and figs.  Flavor: At first I tasted this chilled, the taste was a little muted so I had to let it warm up.  Served at room temp, this beer really opens up. I'm getting lots of fruit, like red figs, dates, raisins, plums, tamarind, apples, cherries, cranberries... even pomegranate. There are also delicious tones of red licorice candy throughout.  Restrained yet complex notes of caramel and chocolate dance in the background, as well as yeasty belgian flavors of banana, clove, bubblegum and white pepper... it's understated but provides an excellent contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.  Feel: Creamy, heady and smooth. Dry and estery; sweet but balanced by a mild floral character. Heavy body with low carbonation. Alcohol is there, but you will only notice it once if you really search for it.  Overall: This is one you really want to take your time with and sip over the course of an hour or so.

42,3457,Cramshawbar,3.75,"I don't know for sure, but I have this feeling that reviewers tend to rate a non traditional beer market's attempt at a traditional beer without direct comparison. So for example, here is an American attempt at a Belgian style and wow, that is pretty good for a US attempt, so 4.25. As I said, I don't have proof of this but I have read that type of review and I must say that it is rather unhelpful. Allow me to compare this to St. Bernardus, Rochefort or Westvleteren and no, this one is not even close. Of course elements are there, of course it is a fantastic attempt but this is not among the great Quadrupels, no matter how we want it to be. It is strong and yet watery, missing the full body and all its intricacies. It is absolutely worth a try, but for me here in Toronto, why would I pay the same amount (for an extremely limited time at that) for something that costs as much as St. Bernardus (available year 'round)? That would be ridiculous. So if Three Philosophers is all you can fetch in this style, go for it, this is decent.

Not off-putting, but somewhat strong compared to the ""standard"" of the style.  Taste--A rich blend of spice, anise, dark fruits, and a boozy/dry finish (most likely the kriek coming through). Not as malty-caramely as typically found in the style, but again, not offputting. Perhaps a bit too medicinal, however.  Feel--The carbonation does not personally bother me, but this is too carbonated to be true to the style.  Overall--I've yet to be let down by Ommegang's takes on the Belgian styles. This is a nice American take on the Belgian dark strong. It doesn't measure up to the ""originals,"" but for the price and pedigree, it is excellent.

F: medium-thick wave up front, whoosh of moderately-hot booze follows, mostly glassy finish with less residual matter than expected... so it ends up being slightly top-heavy, weightless, and dry (and sort of altogether dull)... could use a bit more warmth toward the back (instead of 'tween my side teefs)... based on drag, one could drink as many as 3-4 in a row and not slouch...

Just behind the initial wiff, the faintest hint of the kriek's cherries can be detected. T-The taste is similar to the nose, with the cherries being slightly stronger in the taste vs the nose. The cherries get stronger as the beer warms, but never become the dominant flavor. They serve to take some of the alchohol edge off the beer as well as toning down the charr. Overall the kriek added to the beer has made it easier drinking than I was expecting for a quad. F- The carbonation is prickly, but not overly strong for the style. The mouthfeel is thinner than I was expecting. O-A good, but not great beer that I'm glad I tried. Still it's probably not something I would shell out the cash for again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Spicy, sweet, and savory, this beer offers some stone fruit, fig, nutmeg, peaty scotch, licorice, bubblegum, and all sorts of other cool things on the nose. So much going on! The taste is similar, but with a few more sweet notes than expected. Can't tell if the 1.5 years of aging in my cellar has made it better or not, but it's a glorious beer no matter when you drink it. And yeah, you can definitely taste those cherries. Smooth and refeshing enough that it doesn't just make you thirstier when you drink it, and it can even pair well with salty foods, which I normally recommend with paler ales - impressive considering it's close to 10% abv.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Lunchboxhead,4.05,Found a bottle from 2010 in my liquor cabinet. Chilled it and opened it today 1/2/2016. This is a seriously complex beer. A ton going on from the spicy opening through to the almost sour finish. This is a beer to be savored as it changes as it warms and oxidizes. This reminds me of almost of a prosecco with the grape overtones but the alcohol reminder at the end elicits a nice warm fuzzy that will keep you coming back until the bottle is empty. I do not know how often I would drink this but I am particularly happy I am doing it now. Consider this a beer you should try at least once.

The head is a creamy brown that started as one finger width and slowly reduced to a thin film.  S: Amazingly fruity yeast aroma full of cherry, plum, raisin, dark malt, caramel, and spices like cinnamon and allspice. I wish I could rate it higher than a five, it's that good.  T: Starts with spicy malt and caramel, then transitions to tart dark fruits, and ends with an alcoholic kick.  F: Medium / full bodied and really foamy with medium carbonation.

This is an excerpt from a review below that describes the taste exactly as I tasted it.  this beer is quite nutty and the dominant flavor profile is malty. It has a medium-full body that definitely doesn't leave you wanting more body, which is to say there is something in this glass that your tongue can get a good grip on. It is moderately carbonated with a light hint of cocoa, and after a swig, there is a noticeable but unhindering amount of bitterness that rests on the back of the tongue.  However, the bitterness was too much for me to handle. Absolutely awful. Ruined the rich mouth feel and malty/chocolate notes.

42,3457,jp32,3.72,"Pours either a dark auburn color with some real red highlights that shine through the edges. A smooth khaki colored head resolves itself back into the beer fairly quickly.  Aroma is of wood, cedarwood predominantly, alcohol, tart cherries, and red cabernet wine.  The flavor reminds me much more of wine than it does anything else. Red wine, most likely either cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. I'm not a big wine person so I'm not sure which one to call it. Alcohol is present in the flavor, as is some kind of grain. Occasionally has a slightly bready aftertaste. Oak, or some other kind of wood is also present. In fact, the flavor profile here is mostly oak, alcohol, and red wine. The flavor REALLY has a strong barrel-aged or oak-aged presence, yet I don't see that noted anywhere on the beer's label so I'm assuming it's not. Hard to imagine.  I just don't think this is my favorite style. If you have a significant other who loves their wine and you're trying to sway them to the other side, this would be a lovely introduction beer for that person.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy brown color that really isn't all that pretty. There is a faint copper tinge to the beer, but nothing astounding. The head is off-white bordering on dishwater brown.  Smell: Dates, raisins, currants, prunes, molasses, sour cherry, and alcohol  Taste: Very similar to the nose. The cherry flavors are not as prevalent as I would have imagined based on other reviews or the description. There is definitely a soft, tart cherry presence to the beer but it is by no means the main note of the beer. Flavor notes include sweet dates, banana esters, brown sugar, honey wheat bread, cherry, and a faint booziness. The booziness is noticeable but not overpowering or astringent.  Mouthfeel: Medium-high body.  Overall: A great beer from Ommegang and one that I will anxiously try again.

Three Philosophers pours a deep brown-amber mix with a light redness in there, looks like it should hold a mosquito being used for dna samples in a Jurassic Park franchise movie. It is a seriously fine looking beer. The aroma has a waft of sherry in there. Carbonation is fast and bulbous, tight also. Enjoying the cherry and fig notes that come through as this beer warms. English bonfire toffee and an element of clove come through. The complexity is outstanding, each sip opening something new up, much like listening to one of your favorite Kraftwerk albums on vinyl.

The smell was full of cherries, had a light apple aroma, Belgian sweet malts, an ample amount of Belgian spices and a light cocoa flavor underneath. The taste was blended nicely between the sweetness and the spiciness. There's the lingering sweet to spicy Belgian aftertaste. The mouthfeel had about a medium body with that back of the throat tightness gripping my tongue I normally associate with quads. I'm not exactly sure if I described that well to anyone reading this, but I think it might be somewhat hard to explain.

42,3457,SensorySupernova,4.35,"Appearance: Dark brown with a tan head which doesn’t last too long.  Smell: Spice, bread, banana, alcohol.  Taste: Moderately sweet up front. Belgian yeast - not too strong. In the middle there is a dark fruit flavor - like cherries or plumbs. Slightly more bitter at the end, just a little alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Thick and moderately carbonated.  Overall: Good. It says on the label that this is mixed with cherry ale, but it is definitely not overdone or cloying.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,lastmango,4.09,Pour was a beautiful mahogany color with a two finger fizzy head. I probably poured too cold as I was expecting a more luxurious head. Little lacing. Nose was of light malt and cherry like the old safety lollipops. Initial sweet malt with cherry on the end and almost no hop kick. Toffee and a bit of pepper in the mix. Carbonation was a bit crisp at first but mellowed later . . . or perhaps that was me mellowing. Feel was a bit thick for me. This is a very filling beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ZBowden,4.14,"Bottle states from the year 2014, poured on 8/29/2015. Pours rich amber with fine sediment, smells spicy clove and cinnamon and molasses, tastes of sharp bright yeast with slight lemongrass and clove, mouthfeel is rich with a lasting finish.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,taxandbeerguy,4.35,"355 ml bottle served fairly cold into a Amsterdam Bonehsaker snifter. Purchased while in the US a few weeks ago.  Appearance - a dark, hazy, muddy brown coloured beer is poured. Topped by a finger and a half of tan head, it doesn't last too long before coalescening into a small thin layer of foam that rests on top of the beer. A little sediment rests in the bottom of the glass.  Smell - butterscotch comes to mind right away. Some caramel, vanilla and maybe marshmallows too. Then the cherries bring up the rear while a subtle but steady fruity aroma. Delicious and complex.  Taste - cherries up front, cherries in the rear. A little treacle on the aftertaste with the caramel and butterscotch flavours mingled in with the cherries in the middle. Really tasty and really refined. Reminds me of a slightly different Chimay Blue with the steady cherry presence.  Mouthfeel - smooth and fairly light for a quad, nice soft carbonation, and the booze is reasonably well hidden, drinks more like a 8% ABV beer than one nearing 10%.  Overall - absolutely top notch beer here, a great quad that stands up with the best of the class, very delightful and relatively light with a huge cherry base. Really enjoyable and while pricey, worth the treat once in a while.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Dionysus777,4.44,I am writing this based on memory if it serves me well. Poured into a tulip from a bottle from 2014 and a Best By date of 2020. Smells of dark fruit. Taste is identical to the nose except I found the alcohol to be more up front. It was a little too hot for my palate and it took away from the other flavors. Would love to taste this after a few years in the cellar.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Emersonio,4.51,Pour: Bomber bottle into a snifter. Appearance: Hazy brown/bronze with a thick off color head. Aroma: Very malty with deep dark berry fruits present. Taste: Deep dark berry fruits...plum. Spicy with hints of clove and very malty. Aftertaste: Alcohol warming effect and spicy on the back end. Overall: I enjoyed this complex brew. Very good: 4 out of 5.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Gajo74,4.34,"Pours a mahogany color with a fluffy foam head that retains quite well; it leaves a creamy film that beckons you to keep on drinking, as well as plenty of lacing. A good looking brew. Nice complexity n the nose. Raisins and dark bread are at the forefront. There is a slight citrus zest that tingles the nose and a whiff of alcohol spice. There is even a touch of cherry tartness. In the mouth, several of the flavors reflect the aroma. The dark fruit, raisins in particular, provide the middle, while the tart cherry lingers in its backbone. Sweet malts are balanced by just the slightest hint of clove like spice. The alcohol is well masked. Smooth, velvety and creamy with a finish that is slightly dry. Big bodied, supple but wholly drinkable. An excellent American made Quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Slaterlovesbeer,4.26,"Pours a beautiful dark brown color with a tannish three finger head that quickly dissapates with zero lacing. Smell is sweet, malty and pastoral. Flavors are rich, roasty, malts, the perfect notes of hops. Perfect balance of sweet and bitter, the complexity of this beer is on par with a fine wine. Fantastic brew on all levels, never heard of it and decided to give it a go. High abv is completly overshadowed by the depth of flavor.

42,3457,hopphead31415,4.27,"I tried this beer several years ago on tap, but it was in a different era in which the artful act of drinking and reviewing beers had not yet been found upon me. Per the request of my dear brother, I have renewed my enthusiasm in this Quadrupel ale by one of the greatest brewers around which is, of course, Ommegang. It boasts a powerful 9.7% ABV and a rather rare one at that, as it is not even. It promises depth and beauty, it tells tales of flavors unspoken, and qualities rare to find in the world of beers dominated by tree-swinging monkeys with zero palate and even less brains (hello Coors, Bud Light, Miller, and Milwaukee).  Look-This beer pours an enigma of color. This means to me that it has a plethora of hues available to those who wish to gaze upon the beauty of this brew. In its natural state, it has a cola-dark and brown ale primary hue. However, in different lights, it will shimmer with a variety of flavor colors. You get copper and amber and also dark freckled beauty with hues that make you want to jump into a syrup tree in Vermont. It leaves thick foamy off-white lacing on the glass that is so heavy that it droops under its own weight.  Smell-I get toffee, nutmeg, spices, brown sugar, and of course a smokey oak and cedar. I get a malt-forward aroma that is laced with a smokey pleasantry that shows up again in the flavor. The smell tells no tales of any alcohol content to speak of. This spins silky tales of deception, for the tongue picks up a different story in the alcohol department.  Taste-The flavor is dynamic and dynamite and complex. It has no hops that are discernable, and a malt-forward medium-bodied complexity that does well on the palate. It plays a game with your nose, but the flavors can be captured by the following description. It has a candied cherry, sherry wine, molasses, smoked cedar, brown sugar, candied plum, red wine like a pinot noir, an earthy pepperiness, nutmeg, cinnamon, chocolate, fruit, and for the holidays a strong note of fruit cake. It was not overly sweet nor distractingly syrupy.  Mouthfeel-The feel is creamy and sweet with a tinge of tartness. It has a high carbonation content that results in a perfectly effervescent component that plays well with the variety of flavors. If you have no tongue to taste, then don’t even bother with this one because it will only tease you.  Overall-This brew is absolutely off the hook. If you normally drink the beer of a moron, then don’t even bother for you are not even close to worthy. If you want a beer that is drinkable and crisp, then this one is for you, but give it a chance and a cold glass to pour into. I think that this one will give a different variety of flavor in each sip so treat her well and pay attention. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Sour cherry taste comes through more heavily on the tongue, almost so much so as the chocolate.  M: Relatively thin for a quadrupel with very little carbonation. The lightness goes well with the cherry flavor, leaving only a bit of creaminess to be desired.  O: A slight departure from your typical quadrupel, this one is well-crafted with a cherry flare. Very drinkable with almost no medicinal qualities.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Lots of cherries on the middle of the tongue. Nice malty bread finish. Overall: This is a fantastic beer. A Lil outside the box for a quad but we'll executed.

42,3457,GarthDanielson,4.25,"Poured from a 750ml cork and cage into a stemmed chalice, the beer is a deep, ruby-tinted mahogany coloring with a foamy, bubbly, dense, off-white head. Aromas of date, fig, tart cherry, molasses, caramel, toffee, nutty highlights, and a spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and all spice, all on a bready backbone. Flavors are very rich and sweet forward, with toffee and rich caramel blending with a tart and slightly sour cherry character. The old world fruit richness comes in shortly after, providing depth and layering alongside the spice blend and a slowly building booze warmth. As you continue to drink, you start to pick up some earthy tones, as well as subtle funky yeast characteristics. Heavy beer, with a full, slick feel. The aftertaste is more of the old world fruit notes, slightly cloying but very balanced, lingering on through the slick, slow finish. Great beer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,hophead723,4.35,"After doing some research I decided to give this one a try. I poured it from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet. The bottle was dated 2014 so this is a relatively fresh example of this beer, which can be aged like wine.  Look: It pours a dark chestnut but when held to the light it shimmers a plethora of the finest amber hues; ranging from dark ruby to light clover honey. The edges shine like an eclipsed sun. I witness a lively stream of bubbles coming from the base of the glass, as well as some that flutter around erratically. The lacing left distinctive and amorphous rings down the glass. Beautiful.  Smell: Candied banana, brown sugar, caramel, yeast, fig, and plum are present in the exquisite aroma of this high quality brew. As it warms to around 50 °F more overripe banana becomes apparent as well as flourishes of spiced rum. It is an absolutely delicious smell.  Taste: The taste is robust and full: candied banana, dark fruits like plumb, and lots of fruity yeast characteristics. It has a touch of tartness at the end from the cherries accompanying a bourbon-like sweetness. The alcohol reveals itself in flashes of warmth like sunlight peeking through the branches of a tree. Exquisite.  Feel: The texture is satiny smooth and full bodied, luscious and satisfying, luxurious and rich. There is coating that lingers as long as the taste itself does. The carbonation is there to support the richness of it all.  Overall: This is definitely one of the most exquisite beers I have had. It is amazingly complex and the cherries are extraordinarily well integrated in the overall flavor profile.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,m_hall,4.15,"From a corked and caged 750 ml bottle (2014 bottling) into a tulip. Pours a dark reddish, almost tea-like hue, cloudy, topped by a tan head that fell away quickly. Very light spotty lacing  Aroma is fairly intense- big fruit notes (banana, dark berries, apricot, cherries) with wine-like highlights.  Flavors are big with the fruits, as well - the expected ripe cherries, also plum and fig-like notes, augmented with spicy cloves. There are also hints of toasted bread, burnt sugar and a rum-like booziness. The finish is fairly tart and a bit dry.  Mouthfeel is moderately full, alcohol is not overbearing but definitely present. There's enough carbonation to give this a bit of a tingle on the palate.  A fine Quad, and a good offering from Ommegang, if not perhaps my personal favorite from them. The flavors are nicely balanced, though I could go for just a touch more complexity in a 'big' beer like this one. Though this is a year-round beer, I see this working well as a winter-warmer, and would be interested in seeing how this one ages long-term.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Nugganooch,3.78,"750ml cork&caged bottle – 2014 Chimay Chalice glass Notes taken from 12/24/2014  A: Three Philosophers pours a russet brown body with some cloudy yeast haze stirring about. Smallish bubbles form a thin layer of khaki cream across the brim. Moderate stay power to this one with only a few light swaths of lace left hanging around.  S: Deep dark fruity malts invoke a mélange of darkened breads and plumy fruits with dried currants, cherries, and figs. Not super aromatic I would say but fairly pleasant and inviting. I get some weak chocolate and dark caramel or molasses like sweetness to this. Finishes with a dusty mineral quality and earthy spices. Definite clove there and more dark fruits shown in the close.  T: Bready dark crust soaked in rum and molasses with raisin, fig, and mild cherry or dark berry. The Belgian style yeast conjures up some nice clovey spice flavors with a touch of bubblegum and light smoky phenols. Earthy minerals and more spice with a moderately low amount of bitterness. Alcohol is well masked only asserting a touch in the finish. What’s here is nice but is most certainly restrained. I am not getting a real deep dive to this one at all.  M: Fairly full bodied with a moderate amount of heftiness to it. Could use to have a bit more carbonation. Rests a bit heavy on the palate for the style these are usually more bouncy and soft. Slight drying attempts in the finish. Pretty clean balance overall.  D: A nice year round offering that is easily obtainable but just doesn’t hold up to its Belgian counterparts. And I really wanted to love this one however it falls a bit short of expectations and mostly in the flavor department. Not nearly as complex or in depth as it should take you. That said I found the beer to be well crafted with nice balance and some tasty flavors. Not going to be my favorite Quad, nor will it be my last go with the Philosophers of Three.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Flavors of near-wine grape, with less sweet than the style typically, with bitterness and tartness starting mid-sip and lasting with a dryness.

Flavour is pronounced dark fruit, of figs and plums and dates; sugary sweet toffee, banana, cloves, spices, a slight bit of sulfur. Mild ground peppercorn. Mild dry tobacco.

Strong fruity esters are fairly powerful and mask the alcohol well – a slight alcohol presence (med-low) noted. No noticeable ‘breadiness’, no diacetyl. No off scents detected. Heavy inhales catch the high alcohol that is otherwise subdued.  Appearance (3/3) Beautiful Medium Brown/Chestnut hue with a slight maroon tincture. Large luscious light tan head that persists, great clarity, can see the underside of the head from below. The head sheets very well along the side of the glass as it retreats.  Flavor (18/20) The beer’s full range of flavors are released as soon as it is moved about in the mouth. The many dried fruit scents noted in the aroma manifest as a backbone for the malt-balanced but alcoholic flavor left on the tongue. Again, the dark plum and cherry flavors, along with the high alcohol content balance the maltiness out. Not much apparent bitterness, potentially a floral addition somewhere in the complexity. The finish is moderately sweet maltiness with apparent alcohol which dissipates to leave the sweeter fruit notes. The very complex flavor is hard to describe but definitely malt balanced with some very slight astringency. No other off-flavors apparent.   Mouthfeel (5/5) High carbonation is apparent with no stinging bite, very smooth but alcoholic bite comes on fairly strong toward the finish. Body is fairly full, malty, and creamy.   Overall Impression (9/10) Overall, this is a very complex aromatic quadrupel which masks it’s alcohol well. The beer has a beautiful appearance in both color and head and dances around the mouth. A complicated mixture of aromas and flavors will keep you delighted and guessing all the way through. A wonderful sit-down beer for beer lovers to contemplate the way others will study a glass of scotch. Top notch quadrupel I would drink any day of the week.

Aroma is a complex mix of caramel malts, fig, dark licorice, and booze.  Taste follows the nose. Leads wig fig, cherry and dark licorice. Joined by the caramel malts. Sugary. A slight hint of lightly roasted chocolate. A little bit of fruitiness. The fruit combined with the carbonation gives it a bit of a lambic feel to it. Taste transforms a bit after it warms. Dark fruits and sweetness start to come on a lot stronger.  Silky and creamy, like a good quad. Not much bite from the alcohol. Medium bodied, fairly easy the drink.

I did it very slowly, but there was still significant head to it. I let it sit for a bit, and once it settled, the head was a beautiful brownish-white layer of fluff. It retained itself throughout the drink, and provided the ale a nice creamy element. Lacing was superb. The ale is smooth, with the cherries providing a very nice touch.

The taste lacks a defining identity - it has some warm phenol flavor but without definition, the cherry is there but less pronounced than on the nose, same with the yeast.

42,3457,infinitebruner,4.21,"February 9, 2015  12 oz bottle, tulip  A – About an inch-plus of light tan, moussy foam head, with moderate-long retention, sits on top a somewhat hazy deep amber to mahogany liquid. Appears a bit thick, with some viscosity, and some light lacing in the glass.  S – Bready, toasty malt, some toffee there as well, with some fruity esters of pear, and residual brown or candi sugar. A very light touch of cherry, and a bit of barnyard funk. Some dried raisins and plums in the background. Hops seem to be low, a somewhat woodsy or herbal impression from what I could find. No bitterness on the nose. Some impression of alcohol.  T – Very malty, again bready and toffee notes, and very sweet, with a lot of residual sugar, possibly dark candi sugar. The slightest hint of bittersweet chocolate. Very light impression of dark fruit, like plums or cherries, and little lambic/Brett character here. Hop flavor is basically non-existent, a touch of bitterness comes through in the finish.  M – Very high carbonation helps to offset the residual sweetness, actually lending some dryness on the palate and finish despite the sugar. A very light hop bitterness is present, but not very notable. Moderate-full body.  O – A complex, layered beer, a lot going on here, the residual sweetness needs to be balanced out a bit, but an excellent sipper.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell: Great smell of dark fruits and malt. Very yeasty also. Sweetness from the grain, this can most be felt by getting some of this godly nectar into your nostril (as I did so accidentally)  Taste: Masking alcohol less well than other quad such as St. Bernardus or Rochefort 10. Taste of prune, and dark fruits. Did not have any tobacco smells. Some bitter taste at the end, together with a little bit of tartness from the cherry kriek on the palate, which is an excellent addition.  Overall: A great blend and brew.

You gotta pour carefully to avoid decanting the sediment. Not the best-looking beverage, but hey - you don't buy 'em to look at 'em. And I do believe this is typical for the style.  The first thing that hits you is the malt, but immediately an almost equal burst of fruit - cherry, maybe raisins, some other stuff that I can't identify. Funkiness, too. Carbonation is perhaps a bit on the light side, producing a really thick, sticky mouthfeel. Sweet, fruity finish. The 9.7% ABV makes its presence known. No bitterness at all.

42,3457,SerialTicker,4.27,"$4.49 single poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: Steady pour into the glass gave a finger of a creamy, tan head. The rest of the beer doesn't look so sexy, but it looks like I figured it might -- a very murky orange/red/brown color with tons of floaters in there. Regardless, looks very good for the style.  Smell: Awesome. Belgian funk that's so potent it makes this smell like a sour... well actually, it almost makes it smell like a wine with all the grape/dark fruits I'm smelling. Little bit of malts in the background to let you know you're about to drink a BEER. The bottle says this beer has cherries, but I'm really getting a wine-y red grape character that I love.  Taste/feel: Does not taste like it smells -- it tastes more like I would expect a Quad to. While the aroma is surprisingly ""bright"" with a fresh grape juice kind of aroma, the taste brings a wallop of malt with more of a raisin or date flavor as opposed to fresh grapes. There's also a fair amount of alcohol in the flavor -- which I actually love in the style -- and just a little bit of heat. The finish is dry and warm, yet Three Philosophers leaves a syrupy residue in the mouth. The feel is good, but I think a little more carbonation or a touch less thickness would really make this beer shine. As it stands now, I feel like the thick body with only a little carbonation keeps from getting all the flavor I could get from this beer.  This is a marvelous beer. Pricy no doubt at $4.49 a single, but it's easily World Class in the style. Big fan of this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The cherries blend with dates, raisins and baking spices in aroma and with a slight hint of barnyard funk.  T: Rich and fruit forward, with the Kriek strongly representing itself in the blend.

Dark, rich, and smooth with a slight alcohol burn and beautiful presentation, this beer is unmistakably a fine piece of craftsmanship. However, to my taste it was not complex enough to be world class in this style.  I also should note that my rating reflects my preference for dark, malty beers with minimal hop character.

The cork pops easily, with pressure from inside the bottle helping. I wait for the gush, but it doesn't come. The carbonation, however fills the glass. An easy pour still provides several inches of rocky head,which (eventally) becomes a small cap. Attractive rings of sticky lacing are left after each sip. Ruby brown and cloudy, the aroma is bread, carmalized sugars, dark fruits (plum, raisin), with a bit of booze as it warms. Never too boozy, though.

42,3457,JackRWatkins,2.73,"Bottle 750 ml in tulip glass  A: lighter than I had remembered/expected, a color very similar (if I recall correctly) to St. Bernardus prior 8, heavy, oily brown color but with a dash of subtle cherry red (derived from the blending of the kriek I'm assuming). A decent head presence, 2 fingers ivory and creamish color, retention was mild at best, decent lacing.  S: very underwhelming. If I had it to do over again, I would not have used the St. Bernardus glass, the mouth being as open as it is, any prominent aroma dissipated rather quickly, so that may or may not have been my fault. Still, it feels unfair to blame the glass for a shortcoming that a beer of this esteem and stature has. With the inclusion of the leifmans kriek, one would expect to get at least a modicum of cherry in the nose but I detected little to none. mainly it smelled sweet in a boozy fashion, not boozy in and of itself but simply in terms of the nature of the sweetness.  T:Honestly I found the two beers blended here to be, at least in this case, not complementary and generally incompatible, this is not to say that the idea of blending a quad with a kriek is inherently bad, simply to say that to me, it does not so much work here. the dryness, tartness, and acidity of the kriek take center stage here in a big way, disappointingly though, the fruit notes have been relegated to the very back of the profile at best. the cherry is overpowered by the quad, which is in turn overpowered by the tart dry acidity of the kriek.  M:Waaaaaaay too carbonated, as I believe someone else noted, this beer kinda destroys the palate, the heavy carbonation bolsters the briney flavor coming through from the dryness and acidity of the kriek, it buries the malt of the quad under all of that fizzy weight. this beer is very sharp and burns a tad  O:this is not a bad beer, but I believe it to be an overly ambitious one, I think perhaps most of all that's what makes it unsuccessful. The quad style is a monster of a beer style built on the legendary brewing traditions of the trappists. generally, though not as much so in the wake of the later phase of this our american craft beer revolution, very few brewers even attempt to brew quadrupels and even fewer do so with true success. the great ones generally come from the trappists of belgium. three philosophers then, may very well be an adequate or to be more descriptive not a bad beer but once again that's the largest part of the problem, Making a 'passable' quad, either in the sense that it's just not bad for beer or even in the sense that it's just not bad for a quad and even tastes like one, is a lot like duplicating a famous painting, sure you have the skill, but if it is not better than the original or at least equally good yet different, who gives a shit. the equally good yet different here was supposed to be the kriek, and if it truly worked in this beer, I'd be inclined to give it high praise indeed all of the praise it deserves. So while points are most assuredly deserved here for craft and a willingness to experiment, what we are left with is a briny, adequate beer with all of the worst characteristics of the beer it blends in, with none of the things that render those bad characteristics complementary.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Fear4Beer,4.4,"AMAZING when poured into a glass: that reddish hue looks absolutely beautiful. What I get on a few sips is a nice malt backbone, cherries, a very low amount of bitters to balance out the maltiness, smooth, and an alcohol warmth as it goes down into the stomach. I think I might be the first to say this (I really hope I am) but while I was drinking it what came to mind was ""Dr. Pepper"". Try drinking this and tell me you don't get that vibe too! That is definitely not a negative because if you don't like Dr. Pepper you don't deserve to be American. That's in the constitution. haha. It doesn't taste exactly like Dr. Pepper of course but it must be that blend of cherries and the maltiness that just reminds me of it. The drink is absolutely divine. Another home run from Ommegang. I've tried several of their beers now and they are among the elite breweries in America.  I drank the 2014 version in 2014 (for you people in the future reading this). Be aware that this drink is suggested by Ommegang to be cellared and many people reviewing it are drinking cellared versions from years ago.

Grassy hops lend a bitterness that doesn't entirely mesh with the rest of the flavor profile, though this is a minor grievance. The kriek/cherry manifests mildly in the finish but is not a major factor. Alcohol is extremely well concealed, in no way betraying its nearly 10% ABV.

The nose of this beer is sweet, but not overwhelming; just the right amount of sweetness.  T: Flavors of sour cherries and sweet malts perfectly blend together without being too sweet or tart.

Head dies down to a thin film.  Smell brings in aroma of malts, fruits, and slight spice.  Taste almost reminds one of drinking a red wine of sorts. Hints of cherry and slightly burnt toast on the starting line, then opens up to nice malts, some hops, and the same spice as smelled. Alcohol is somewhat noticeable in this one.  Has a nice mouthfeel, full bodied and dry. Carries on the comparison to a red wine.  This beer definitely lets you know its there. A lot of flavors mixed in. This is my first beer of this type, but still it made a good impression.

M- On the thicker side of medium, which is pretty cool considering how crisp it is. Drying.  O- I can't say I was the biggest fan of this one. I finished the bottle, which I don't always do when I'm not overly impressed, so it gets points for that. You could definitely tell it was a combination of styles.

42,3457,amano_h,4.03,"The nose is a gorgeous combination of jammy figs, raisins, faint white pepper, dried cherries, and a slight hint of booze. The more Belgian-inspired elements of raisins and figs intensity with the passage of time and a slight clove-like sprinkle reveals itself toward the rear end with sufficient airation.  The palate emulates the nose to the dot. A plethora of dried dark fruit is accompanied by shy accentuations of yeast-derived white pepper and clove, with cherry entering the fray late in the game. Whereas I expected booze-burn to accompany the range of flavors and the ABV sported by this beer, it ends somewhat bitter-sweet, with the end result favoring the drier end of the spectrum; if only I could go back ten years in time and tell my young self to enjoy the shit out of this beer for what it is.  Medium-bodied with a gorgeous creamy initial mouthfeel.

A- Pours a reddish light brown color with a 1/2 inch tan head that retains well before meandering down to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and sporadic bubbly surface foam. Sudsy, not-so-resilient lacing.  S- Lots of dark fruit notes including black cherry, raisin and fig. Quite sweet with a noticeable booze fume.  T- More dark fruit plus some Belgian candi sugar. Has a dryness that bounces off the fruity sweetness to make for a great duality. There's that booze again making itself known but not so much that it spoils the party.  M- As said before, dry with medium carbonation and a fullish body.

Tasted malty with hints of cherry fruit. High alcohol taste. Fair amount of carbonation. As several reviewers noted not a drinking beer, but a sipping beer best paired with something. Not my favorite beer, probably would not buy again, but worth a try.  4/2014 Almost 4 years later I tried this beer again. I was out to dinner and the beer choices were limited.

It had a bit more kick to it than I expected, which was surprising but very nice! Nothing here knocked me out of the park, but it was a very tasty and nuanced set of flavors.  M: The wheat was fairly prominent, and stuck in the mouth, displaying the flavors nicely. The beer was smooth and went down quickly, hiding somewhat the fact that the ABV was in the 9's.  O: Like I said, nothing that wowed me, but still a very very good beer. I love Ommegang, and this one holds up to the name.

Tastes of the dark fruits with some bready malt and spice. Notes of chocolate, caramel, and toasted bread lead off. This leads into figs, raisins, and a hint of cherries. Not particularly sweet. Some booze adds to the fruits and gives a little bit of a rum cake feel to it. Herbal and spice notes round out the finish along with a touch of alcohol warmth.

A little sour, with a nice warming finish from the alcohol. A little bitterness, hops/toasted malt/ licorice flavors contributing. A little sour plum/banana.  Mouthfeel: creamy and lightly carbonated, just enough. Really enjoyable.  Notes: Complex to say the least, each sip gives me something new. The alcohol is very present in this one.

Nose is pretty absent-I really don't get much.. a little dark fruit and earthiness, but nothing is distinct.  Taste impression is tangy dark fruit. It starts a bit sour even-lime or lemon notes, backed entirely by dark fruit and dark bread notes. The carbonation helps the feel on what is at best a medium bodied beer.

42,3457,Chrysostom,4.17,"2012 vintage, as always reviewed live and not from notes. Poured from 750mL bottle ($8.99) in to Chimay chalice with a soft hand. Cellared a bit too cold, warming to 50-60ºF as I write the review.  Appearance is good, but nothing special for the style. It is a mostly clear (very mildly cloudy) reddish brown, or deep brown with sharp blood-to-ruby-red highlights, almost approaching the best examples of the Irish Red such as Great Lakes' Conway's. A very thin head is left on a gentle pour, which recedes first rather quickly, and then a bit more slowly, to a small ring of a cap on the surface of the beer. Lacing appears to be minimal to nonexistent.  On a more vigorous pour, the head is larger, similar to the colour of the head of a Coca-Cola, with a similar sound from how quickly it recedes, in an uneven and ""rocky"" manner, within 15 seconds. Other characteristics remain the same.  Smell is of mustiness or funkiness, grape must, cherries, aldehydes, and some banana-like smells (ketones?). Some, but little, characteristic smells of either ""beer"" or ""Belgian"". A fresh bottle smells a bit better, IIRC.  Taste is of the best American replica of a Belgian beer I've ever had. It hits all the bases well, if not perfectly. Cherries are evident on the palate, and alcohol is virtually absent. Some warmth as it hits the stomach, but the 9.8% ABV is almost entirely occluded. Cherries and candied dark fruits predominate. It is definitely sweet -- but a thin sweetness, not a thick, sugary one. The sweetness does not seem to be all malt sweetness: maybe some comes from the kriek blend? It is sweet even to a regular drinker of dubbels and quads who dislikes hop-heavy brews. There are hops on the back-end to help modify the sweetness in the aftertaste, but they do little to keep it in check up front. It's not extraordinarily complex, but it does what it does with grace.  Mouthfeel is moderate. It seems to be low on the carbonation in appearance, but is well-balanced, and even feels lively on some sips. There's a sharpness to the drink which is surprising, and which I can't define. It does not coat the mouth unpleasantly, combining characteristics of light- and full-bodied. However, with this sort of malt and ABV, the body will tend to be heavy; not so much here. Again, very well-done. Combined with the occluded alcohol, drinkability is dangerously high, although the sweetness would likely deter from a second fifth.  Taste and mouthfeel are more important than smell, when it comes to beer, so I'm giving this one just below a 4.5 overall -- I'd probably put it at 85 for style (16e specialty), and 85 to taste.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,flyingpig,4.55,"355ml Bottle from BeersOfEurope.co.uk (£5.39): Amber with brownish red tinges throughout the body and topped with a decent sized, foamy beige head that is nice considering the abv. but sadly is doesn't hold all that well, turning to a single patch in the centre of the surface after a little under a minute.  Sweet with a solid fruity aroma that is dominated by cherries yet doesn't overpower the senses. There is some spice with lots of darker, ripe fruits. Dates and some figs feature and there is plenty of sugary sweetness & the alcohol is very well hidden too.  Sweet with the lambic style cherries & some spice, a little sugar and various other sweet fruits and malts plus a touch of yeast. The alcohol comes through a little stronger here but again it doesn't overpower or spoil the taste.  Sweet & very well balanced with the alcohol hidden quite well, coming through just enough to give the beer a nice feel to it. The finish is dry but not overly whilst carbonation is good and the beer is smooth, creamy and frighteningly easy to drink.

42,3457,artoolemomo,3.79,"Appearance- Pours up a huge amount of head which appears to have equally good retention. The head is a light to medium beige/tan that has a little rosiness to it. The body is a muddy mix of chestnut and maroon which appears as a medium to dark amber with hints of maroon when held up to the light. Some wisps of lacing and some spots.  Nose- Starts off with a rounded front of banana and cloves when slight notes of cherry peek in. Some caramel and honey. Light raisins. Hints of brown bread but very light. Swirling gives the slight cherry of the background a tiny tartness. Lacks some presence but still nice.  Taste- Starts off with raisins and brown bread while a faint tinge of cherries linger in the background before it moves into slightly abrasive cloves. A little too phenolic for me at the moment. There's a bit of woody bitterness that combines with the cloves to make this beer a little more harsh than I like. Hints of bittersweet chocolate around the edges. Some vinosity which ranges from white to red grapes. Lots of dark fruit flesh but not enough combat the ashiness of the cloves on the finish. Because of that, this beer is just a solid, good beer in my opinion. The phenols definitely prevent me from considering it a really good beer. Some molasses and brown sugar. Perhaps even a slight amount of heat. Some spice which tends toward pepper and cinnamon. Fairly complex but at points, it seems the balance could be better. Touches of honey as this begins to mellow a bit.  Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with some syrup to the texture. Light carbonation with a dry finish.  Drinkability- A little messier than a lot of the quads I've had but still pretty drinkable. Slight notion of heat may just be the astringent nature of the cloves and spices. Glad I spent 4.75 on a small bottle instead of the 12, 13 bucks that a 750 can be. Probably would not buy again.  Overall- Solid, good beer that has slight inclinations toward being a really good beer. The cherries really go a long way to smoothing this beer out. Not the biggest fan of the style but this is fairly faithful to it. Definitely worth a try but this is probably not a repurchase",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,BlackHaddock,4.07,"Finally got my hands on a bottle of this on 31st Jan 2014: had to share it though. Someone very kind (unknown) had brought it to a bottle exchange in De Bierboom, lucky me (I had two medium sized samples, which came to about half a pint).  Loved it.  Deep amber with a slight haze (been poured a few times before I grabbed it), tanned head on both my pours.  Malty molasses hit the nose and taste buds straight away, this is a true malty brew, but there is so much more to it than just a heavy hand of maltiness. Dark berries, chocolate and cherry hints are easy to find in the mouth, some people will pick up other notes with the flavours but my taste buds were aching from all the wonderful beers I was gorging on during the bottle swap and I most likely missed a few subtle esters and tastes.  I need a bottle all to myself!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,SoupKitchenBeerSnob,4.4,"I've had this a few times and loved it. This one was poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Aggressive pour yielded a thick, foamy head that dissipated slowly. Fruity, spicy aroma with a very dark, reddish color. Taste is very complex that leaves a tingly mouthfeel. Good carbonation without a serious bite. These guys specialize in Belgian ales and it shows. Who knew Americans from New York could pull it off so well? According to the label they're part of the Duvel family of beers... Ah, it makes sense now. If you like the abbey ale style as I do, you'll love the Ommegang offerings.

42,3457,youknowmyname,4.55,"Odor: Smoke billowed out of the top of the bottle as soon as I popped the cork. I don't know why, but I always love this. As soon as the bottle was opened, I could instantly smell cherries, plum and cocoa. Sniffing a bit closer to the bottle, the smells became stronger with an accompanying strong alcohol scent. Really clears the sinuses.  Pour: Pours a filtered dark brown with amber hues. Has a slight head that dissipates quickly which produces a even lacing on the glass. Served in a challis.  Taste: Sweet chocolate covered cherry taste on the start of the drink. You can almost anticipate the cordial flavor smelling the glass that close. The drink quickly moves to a brown sugar and caramel taste before the strong warming sensation of the alcohol begins to take hold. Smooth going down. The heat of the alcohol stays with you for a few moments after you swallow. Low carbonation keeps the palate wet waiting for the next drink.  Opinion: I felt this was a fantastic drink but beers like this don't quench a beer thirst. These are a one and done type of beer. I've had other beers with higher abv that hid it better. Don't mistake what I am saying, It really is a fantastic drink, very complex and I would probably buy this again. My wife loved it. She was of the opinion that it would be better if served at room temperature instead of cold as we had it. She felt the flavors really came out more as it warmed in your mouth and I can't disagree.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Eventually it dissolves into a ring that sticks around. The lacing is incredible, it covers the whole glass and slowly drips down.  Smell: A sweet malt scent dominates, complemented by a strong ripe fruit note. There's also an alcohol sting in the background.  Taste: Basically a mirror image of the nose. A strong and sweet malt taste dominates, and is accompanied by ripe fruit and cranberry notes.  Mouthfeel: It's creamy and smooth, very drinkable. It finishes dry and despite the sweetness it is not cloying whatsoever.  Overall: An amazing beer, with a lot of sweetness from the malt and fruit notes, but so well balanced that it's not cloying.

Haven't had one of these in a few years, and this has been in the cellar fit over a year. Really solid for the style.

Overall, an exceptionally tasty and enjoyable beverage.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Jenks,4.19,"Aroma – Very pronounced plum and raisin esters along with cherry. No hop aroma. Strong malt aroma that brings a biscuit characteristic. No diacetyl or alcohol aromas.  Appearance – Deep mahogany, red color. Pours clear with a fair amount of carbonation. Very thick off-white head after the pour which stays throughout the drinking experience.  Flavor – Very nice malt flavor of the biscuit malt with a little bit of cherry showing up at the end of the taste. Big fruity esters from the Belgium yeast. Some residual sweetness.  Mouthfeel – Fairly high carbonation which is complementary to the beer. Full and creamy mouthfeel that also has a very slight tartness at the end. Finishes slightly sweet.  Overall – This beer provides a very enjoyable drinking experience with the deep malt and big Belgium flavor.

42,3457,JohnGalt1,3.99,Hard to believe I haven't reviewed this one yet.... Picked up the 750 from Bier Thirty in Bown over the weekend... Paid a very reasonable $9 and change... Pours with a long lasting tan head... great lacing. The brew is hazy amber.  Big Belgian malt bomb on the nose... deep malt and caramel... dark fruits with apple and hints of cherry... Peppery with a background sweet clove.  Cherry presence is much bigger on the palate... it is pretty bright almost immediately and then moves quickly into the maltiness and then resides primarily as a tart kriek essence. Malts are not nearly as complex as the aroma... light raisin and dark toast. Personally I would like a slightly sweeter malt complexity mid palate to balance the kriek acidity and make the Belgian phenols bloom.  Body is light/medium with the expected great carbonation.  Very well done... Ommegang does Belgians right and this is no exception.  4/4.25/3.75/4.25/4,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Andrew041180,4.14,"A - Poured into a Chimay chalice. Color is predominately brown, with various strains of gold and ruby. Murky look to it, but with bright colors along the edges when held to light. Little to no lacing, but maintains a thin head that lasts for nearly the full glass.  S - Nice mixes, nothing stands out. Mostly what you might expect with a vague sweetness and a slightly funky yeasty smell. I'm looking for cherries here but not really encountering them.  T - Here is where the cherries show up, but not really so much in cherry flavor, as an up-front tartness. It's not strong, but it's definitely present, and gets rolled in with the sweet malts, a clearly Belgian-style yeast that has an ever-so-slightly sour note to it, and light bitterness.  M - Rich and medium-full bodied. The carbonation adds a lushness to it.  O - Very flavorful and enjoyable. Split this bomber with my wife and we both enjoyed it. We had it after dinner. I would probably recommend that you drink it before dinner so that you fully enjoy all of the rich characteristics and subtle flavors.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Badger6,4.19,"Poured out of a 750mL bottle into an Ommegang tulip.  A: Deep reddish amber body. Lovely off-white head, builds quickly and then rapidly diminished to a swirly thick foam layer not he surface of the beer. Heaving lacing on the glass.  S: Nose on the beer is very subtle and pleasant. Hints of barley and malt and clear scents of Belgian yeast. there is the slightest hint of cherries, if one looks for it, easily missed.  T: Semi-sweet flavor immediately. Barley comes out in the front, but not strongly. The middle is malty, with hints of cherry. The finish is marked by the Belgian yeast, some indistinguishable fruits, and some subtle spiciness. Really a great finish. Short aftertaste, very balance notes of malt and cherry, again not powerful. Oddly, for a beer with this high abv the flavors are not very alcoholic at all.  M: Medium light body, feels creamy and smooth with balancing carbonation. The mouthfeel got better through the bottle.  O: Outstanding beer. The beer's individual performance in each category of evaluation belie how good it really is overall. Furthermore as a hybrid, it has done a great job of taking all the great aspects of its parts and saved only those for this. A truly enjoyable beer, but at an abv near 10% this makes for a short, but lively and enjoyable, session.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell is of ripe dark cherries, burnt sugar and caramel with a hint of musty yeast. Very inviting.  Taste is bready malt, sweet dark fruit (plums, cherries and raisins) up front with toffee sweetness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. A steady stream of tiny bubbles rises from the bottom of the glass during the drink down.  Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. I struggle to find a major flaw.

The cherry remains hidden but comes out on the rear of the nose. It becomes very floral when you warm a small amount up slightly. . - 4.5  Taste - The initial attack is all malt.

42,3457,BeerDocT,3.98,"This is blended with a kriek???? Why didn't anyone tell me? I had to find out the old fashioned way: reading the label. :)  Appearance 4.0: Poured out a deep mahogany brown with red highlights at the sides. Nice 1/2"" head quickly faded away to a thick swirly foam on top. Excellent lacing.  Smell 3.5: Very subdued nose on this brew. Slight barley notes and some brief hints of that wonderful Belgian yeast, but that's it.  Taste 4.25: Front is semi-sweet with some mild -yet delicious-- hints of barley. Middle is where a very slight cherry taste comes to the fore along with a lovely maltiness and a slight hint of hops. Finish is where a very subdued berry taste mingles with a big hit of Belgian yeast and some other elements of spiciness for a fantastic end note. Aftertaste is remarkably short and is focused on yet another hint of cherry and malt, blended together perfectly.  Mouthfeel 4.0: Creamy, smooth and balanced. The mouthfeel improved as the session continued.  Overall 4.0: Excellent beer. That old chestnut about the whole being greater than the ""sum of the parts"" comes to mind and is certainly applicable here (especially since it was uttered by one of the world's greatest philosophers). There are remarkable aspects of taste and other levels of enjoyment in this beer that would not be found in the individual beers of which it consists. I would recommend it, but with a warning: its high ABV will knock you on your nates. Great and unique Belgian Quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Has a healthy yeast haze and topped with a fiercely effervescent tan head that pours big, but eventually lowers to an inch or so. Good retention; beautiful but sparse lacing.  S: Nutty and subtly boozy smells on the whole. Jerky, oak, nuts, overripe cherries.  T: Earthy and woody up front with a progressive sweetening with some tart cherry flavors and a long warm finish.  M: Dry and subtly sticky. Medium to full body with a prickly feel but a soft and creamy coating mouthfeel. Lingering alcohol finish, but no shuddering it is quite nice.  O: Fabulous beer. Let me preface by saying that not 30 minutes ago I was lamenting the fact that I don't believe I have ever had what I would consider a Belgian style that was ""up to snuff"" brewed in the US. This is a whole nother game. The beer pours looking just like a Quad should. The nose is the most peculiar part for me. The overall smell is rich and has a lot going on, but it kind of smells weird. Real smoky and something I can't put my finger on (their yeast, perhaps). Pleasantly, the taste is completely different from the smell and further fleshes out the beer. A pleasure to loosely swish in your mouth, this brew is a fine one for sipping on a winter's night by the fire. Share with friends.

First sip is a boozy, sour cherry, phenolic flavor with a fizzy mouthfeel. Sweet candi-sugar like flavors are present, sourness is very faint.

Looks like murky, hazy root beer with a little cream mixed into it, with ample brown foam. Aroma a sweet and heady mixture of rich toffee, floral tobacco, vanilla bourbon, and brown spices. Very sweet smell but there's a little bitter grain to provide balance. Palate is all rich sweet malts, dark fruits, and spice, minimal toast or roast. Milk chocolate, dates, nutmeg and clove, vanilla cream, a little banana, and licorice toffee with a semi-chewy, buttery mouthfeel. A small amount of ale brewed with Belgian kriek cherries imparts a subtle red fruit acidity from start to finish. Low to moderate carbonation. A very nice quad with a lot of complexity and character.

Scents of bubblegum, Belgian yeast spiciness, candi sugar sweetness, cherry, caramel, sweet spices, raisins, dark fruit, prunes and a hint of alcohol. A very rich, complex aroma, fitting a Belgian Quad. Flavor begins with Belgian yeast spiciness, tart cherry and candi sugar, sustaining spice and tart cherry throughout the sip. The middle moves into raisin, plum, sweet spices, peppery spiciness in the background, some apricot pit-like bitterness, dark fruit and dark chocolate. There is faint alcohol towards the finish, which also has a yeasty, spicy and dark fruit quality. Very rich, sweet, spicy and complex. A well done mix of flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with low carbonation and semi-drying finish. Very good for sipping, though almost smooth enough to gulp. Excellent feel. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Quad. The usual flavors are there and the addition of cherries during fermentation add a nice tartness in the back of the aroma and flavor that is quite pleasant.

Moderate fruity quality, mostly cherry, but there are notes of raisin, prune, and tamarind in the mix as well. Finish is fairly quick, a little watery even, leaving a faint raisiny port wash in the mouth.  M: On the heavier side of medium. Actually expected this one to have a bit more body to it.

A good bit of tart cherry drifts in and among other flavors of raisin bread, yeast, mellow dark berries, whole grains, molasses and a little booze. Very sweet without being cloying. A nice malty blend that hides it's alcohol well.  Medium body with fairly strong carbonation. A bit thin and over carbed for my tastes. Sweet cherry aftertaste.

Mild, medicinal phenols show up late, and meld into the gently bitter hops of the finish.  M: heavily carbonated, and crisp. The booze is a little forward, and the finish just hints at dry.

I didn’t pick up any huge cherry flavor only a slight tartness on the end that gave this brew a nice complexity along with the Belgian yeasts and sweet malt.

42,3457,TheBiercast,4.1,"Appearance: It pours a deep burnt sienna. Held about a finger of light tan creamy head. Tight bubbles held to the side of the glass. The beer also produced decent lacing.  Smell: the nose is very strong in dark fruits and candied sugars. Think plums, figs, and raisins coated with sugar.  Mouthfeel: Three Philosophers holds a middle of the road mouthfeel. It’s us not a thick beer, but it is definitely not light. It is very effervescent in the carbonation as you would expect in a Belgian quad done in the style of the oh so wonderful Trappists.  Taste: I may be slightly biased as quads are my favorite styles of beers, but the combination of the mouthfeel and flavored of candied dark fruits makes this a pure joy. The beer also contains two percent ale with cherries added. This does not add a tart flavor, but rather it suggests the sweet notes in a maraschino cherry you’d find on ice cream or in a cocktail. It’s not overpowering and the small hop profile just balances out the sweetness. Nothing really here for hop heads as you’d expect.  Overall: This has always been one of my favorite beers especially when I’m thirsty for a Trappist ale, but either want to save a little money or can’t find what I’m looking for. It’s very accessible.

42,3457,BethanyB,3.97,"Appearance: A slightly hazy copper color, with a large, tightly beaded, light-tan head that persists until the very last drop. A good amount of lacing trails down the side of the glass. Very nice!  Smell: Sweet cinnamon raisin toast, a bit of caramel, and some subdued stone fruit esters, e.g., apricots, plums, etc. Lacks the malty complexity and whiff of alcohol I would have expected from this style.  Taste: Dates, plums, cherries, and figs dominate, backed by peppery phenols and alcohol flavors. A very light bitterness mixes with complex malt flavors, with both the hops and the malt present at the very beginning, then lingering well into the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation is balanced by a smooth, clean texture. As light as the bitterness is, it manages to provide a slight dryness that counterbalances the prominent sweetness. The alcohol warming is very light for the style.  Overall: An excellent example of a strong dark ale. There are no qualities that make it a true standout in my opinion, but this is a big beer style, and with every beer in this category making quite the statement, it's difficult to outshine the others. Absent of faults, but also lacking the complex characteristics I was hoping to find.

I am not finding all these dark fruits, maybe because ive been hitting the stouts more so I am going off of those. Has a slight spice in the finish that fades relatively quick.  M- A medium to full body that I found to be slightly heavier than what the sweetness would present. Lots of carbonation that actually went well with the fruitiness. Has a slickness that makes it go down easy.  O- I find this a pretty good tasting brew, lots of flavor, easy on the nose. Very good mouthfeel that makes it pretty easy to drink.

Big let down on the head.  S - Definitely a Belgian. Lot's of sweet malt, dark fruits ; especially grape and figs. Also noted hints of apricot and even a bit of peach. Fermenty wine-like smell in there, too. That killed it a tad. Still though, nice smelling beer.  T - Not a bas tasting beer, just not really my style. All the aromas were noted in the taste. I could really notice the sweet malts throughout. Not a bad beer, but kind of disappointing. Didn't think it was outstanding, even though it seems to get reviews as such.  F - Sticky, thick, a lot to it. Certainly a sipping beer. Not meant to be chugged obviously, but for what it is, it's drinkable.  O - Not a bad brew, but not one I'd buy again. Who knows, maybe the single I bought wasn't the freshest. I enjoyed drinking it, but I was a bit disappointed as it usually gets outstanding reviews.

S-The smell is interesting and lighter than I remember it (although it has been a few years since I had this beer). I get some musty white grapes, golden raison, clove spice, and just a bit of sour cherries. Nice, but not mind-blowing.  T-The taste, like the smell, is lighter than some quads. I taste a lot of holiday spices (clove, cinnamon, and ginger), some molasses, as well as the aforementioned golden raisin and kiss of sour cherry. There is a light hit of bitterness in the finish. The alcohol is well-integrated/concealed.  M-The feel, as you might expect, is pretty soft, but the carbonation is more active here than in many Belgian examples of the style. Medium to full body.  O-This is a pretty good beer, just not a great one. I thought it was a bit overly-spiced and carried too much light fruit and bitterness to compare against the Belgians. I could have used more raisin/plum/fig/prune. On the plus side, the alcohol is nicely concealed and, if you're into spices, there are a plenty here.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,StoutHunter,4.02,"I picked up a bottle of Brewery Ommegang's Three Philosophers Belgian Style Blend about a month ago for $4.75 at Boyne Country Provisions. This is the last of the Ommegang beers that I picked up while I was up north, A Quad blended with a Kriek peaks my interests, so lets see how it goes. Bottled on April 23rd 2013. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into tulip.  A- The bottle is nice looking, and it's a little eye catching with the James Bond style silhouettes on the label. It poured a slightly amber like red color that took on some ruby and crimson hues when held to the light with four fingers worth of rocky tan head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end and left lots of sticky lacing behind. This is a very good looking beer, I have no complaints at all and I've never gotten this good of head and lacing from a Quad before.  S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of sweetness followed by a good amount of dark fruit aromas with no single fruit sticking out the most and it's immediately followed by a nice cherry like aroma that had just a slight medicinal like aroma to it, the cherries blend nicely with the dark fruit and there's a good balance to it. Up next comes the malts that have a slight brown bread and caramel malt aromas, but it's a nice toffee aroma that seems to stick out the most and it's followed by a Belgian yeast aroma and lighter alcohol aroma. This beer has a pretty good aroma, the Kriek aspect was noticeable and it blended well with those typical Quad aromas.  T- The taste seems to be fairly similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness followed by those same fruit aspects that I got in the aroma, but this time the dark fruits seems to stick out most and the cherries show up in the background and they aren't a little medicinal like they were in the aroma. Up next comes the malts with the toffee showing up and there's just a slight bit sweet and caramel like malts in the background followed by a lighter amount of Belgian yeast flavors. On the finish there's some noticeable alcohol that's a little more warming than I expected and there's a hardly any bitterness on the finish with a malty and dark fruit aftertaste with a little bit of cherries in the background.  M- Fairly smooth, a little rich, creamy, slightly sticky, on the lighter side of being full bodied with a higher amount of carbonation that surprisingly works well with this beer. The mouthfeel was pretty good and it worked nicely with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a Quad, even though it's a blend of a Quad and a Kriek I thought this beer was much more Quad like with Kriek aspects showing up in the background and blending well with the Quad Like flavors. I would be able to tell there was at least some cherries in this beer by the aroma, but I don't think I could tell that this was blended with a Kriek by the flavors alone. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was slightly warming, but I thought it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I wouldn't rule out drinking a couple of these if I was in the mood for this kind of beer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, I'm not sure how this beer would be if the Kriek was the dominant aspect, but I don't think I would enjoy as much since I liked the Quad flavors taking the lead with the Kriek aspects showing up in the background. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but I do think that cherries could have shown up just a little more in the taste. I would buy this beer again, it was a little expensive, but I could see myself buying a bottle or two once in a while and I would recommend this to anyone who likes Quads. All in all I was happy with this beer, I enjoyed it just the way it was and I now see why this beer is as popular as it is, I don't know what took me so long to try it, but I'm glad I did. Good job guys, this is a nice take on a Quard and I think blending is something that is very under utilized by American Brewery's. Keep up the good work guys, so far this is my Favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang and even through this was a blend I still think it's one of better Quads I have tried.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,joe1510,4.3,"750ml Bottle 2005  Three Philosophers poured a muddy copper. Bright ruby highlights when held to the light. There was 1 finger off white head that faded fairly quickly to a light sprinkling of foam along the top. Looks like it will be very flavorful. Kind of mysterious and inviting. I cant wait to see what flavors will come out of this.  When I popped the cork I smelled the bottle and it smelled exactly like a chocolate covered cherry. When poured into the glass a lot more scents came along. I still smell the chocolat although it did die down slightly. Theres damp soil, spice from the yeasts, a sweetness, and cherries coming through faintly at the end. For some reason every now and then I'll smell it and get scents I associate with a spiced cider but only occasionally.  The taste is really good. There's so much going on it's hard to describe but I'll give it a shot. There is a punch in the mouth right up front which quickly mellows into all kinds of flavors. I'm picking up sweet malts, an earthiness/musty, spice, chocolate every now and then, and cherries. I pick up something new with every drink. As it warms there's a touch of alcohol. Just enough so it warms your throat. Very complex.  The mouthfeel is perfect. Velvety and creamy. A nice touch of carbonation. Hits quickly and vanishes. Coats my mouth and is slick as I drink.  Drinkability is ridiculous. This beer is so smooth and so easy drinking for a 9+%.  This is a really great beer. I have a few more I'm going to celler but I think I'm going to have to pick up some more to drink in the meantime. Excellent!

42,3457,1sophrosyne1,4.32,"Enjoyed in a snifter over 35 minutes. Pours a thick rosy-brown with pink corona under an ivory-tan cream cap. retention is long, leaving patchwork quilt of cell-like swirls of head. Too opaque to notice much else. Laces in sheets that slip down fast. Smells festive and sweet with cherries, raisins, bubble gum, banana, and brandy. There's some clove and a dash of both cinnamon and ginger. It's potently heady. Big sniffs bring out a campfire smokiness underneath, as well as rubber, petrol, and baked macadam. While sitting with the aftertaste, I feel pumpernickel bread working its way from the back of my tongue up into my nose. The complexity is worth pausing to unravel. There's a spiciness right up front that's accentuated by the carbonation. It's a pleasant slice through what would otherwise be a very heavy fruitcake. It is sweet with flavors matching the nose, but tart acids (tasting of apricot) also aide with balance that promotes drinkability. With nose deep in the glass, there's a Stilton essence that comes up and also later lingers on the tongue, but it's mild and in check with a malt foundation, caramel shell, hint of espresso, and a dash of pepper. Surprisingly, this heavy brew doesn't linger in the mouth. And I find it a relief that it slides by in a blend of tart and cream without being too chewy or sticky. The bright carbonation early and late-gulp lightness offset the heft of flavors. Warmth in the belly warns that it will catch up with you, though. Overall, I like this creation even more that many Belgian counterparts. It's the mouthfeel that really makes that happen for me--as a contrast to the syrupy cordial character that can make these beers intriguing, but tiring to try to consume. I'd drink this one too long for my health, especially on a chilly evening.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Strong aroma of fig and malt, with cherries layered behind - while a bright acidity lays atop the overall experience. There is a funk smell of cheese as well.  T: Toasty flavor and malt richness envelop the tastebuds first - then dark cherries come through soon after, followed by a more subdued fig appearance.  M: Medium to full bodied - highly carbonated, which makes it feel lighter than it would otherwise. Surprisingly stimulating on the tongue and palate. A full mouth experience.  O: Overall a very nice creation. For the ethanol content- as well as the true richness of its flavor components, this is an incredibly drinkable beer, and surprisingly somewhat refreshing as well. Not insanely filling, as many beers with similar flavor profiles can be - and also does not scream winter warming seasonal brew.

There is a fair amount of alcohol flavor that can be tasted in the beer, but no burning. It has a very full flavor.  M: The mouthfeel is very nice on this beer.

Toasted malt and Belgian candi sugar surface late.  Flavor is fairly sweet and malty initially, with sour cherries dominating mid palate, finishing bready, toasted, and fairly dry. Subsequent sips reveal the dark fruit character at the base, with raisins and dates adding sweetness and complexity.  Body is full, smooth, and syrupy, with moderate to low carbonation that is accentuated by the tart cherries to give a more effervescent feel. Alcohol warmth is present and lingers.

The taste is similar- apparently the quad is laced with a small amount of kriek- and it shows, nice subtle smooth cherry flavor throughout. Other fruits tasted include plums and raisins. Some brown sugar and molasses here as well, with a pretty strong alcohol burn.  Medium bodied, sticky sweet mouthfeel, a slow sipper due to the alcohol.  One of Ommegang's more well-known brews. It's elegant, but a bit overstated at times- very boozy, especially as it warms. A prime candidate for aging, I'd think.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,IchLiebeBier,4.25,"Appearance: chestnut; cloudy; medium frothy head, long lasting  Aroma: Light hops; peppery Belgian yeast smell; cherries; very interesting smell  Taste: Creamy on start with very quick kick from warming alcohol; light hop bite in the mid with lingering hops and cherries in finish; smooth and complex all around; excellent  Remarks: didn't score A, S, T, M at that time; please disregard those scores.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ManekiNeko13,3.75,"Nice full head, definite complex aromas, bitter but a tolerable to me sort of bitter (if it's not Manischewicz, I generally don't like it). I picked up on some nice coffee hints, and actually did try mixing some with milk to cut the bitterness (don't judge me). It was pretty good with the milk added, believe it or not. I didn't get any of the kriek, but since it's only 2% of the formula, I'm not surprised.  Very attractive dark brown color, again not unlike coffee. Smell was similar to a strong lager--basically hoppy and maybe some malt, but again, no lambic-ness detected. Nice mouthfeel--good carbonation, good body. Since I haven't yet tried an actual Trappist ale, I can't compare, but I believe that's what they were going for.  All in all, a pretty good ale, one I'd probably try again after I get some more tasting experience.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Jeffreysan,4.96,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Three Philosophers chalice.  Appearance: The beer pours a dark mahogany that almost looks like a cola, with hints of red speckled throughout. Held up to the light, more red highlights come through (due to the addition of Kriek Lambic?). Freshly poured, the beer had a finger of a tan head that dissipated into a lacy halo of foam settled up against the glass.  Aroma: Strong aromas of cherries, dark bread, and chocolate are what I first get, followed by caramel, plums, and figs. Very rich, very pleasant.  Taste: Cherry and plum, followed by dark bread, a little brown sugar and caramel, some earthiness and just a touch of dark chocolate. The slight tartness of the cherries intermingle well with sweetness of the brown sugar and caramel, and then are balanced nicely with some slight bitterness of the dark chocolate. While not a traditional quad, the addition of Kriek really gives the beer an extra depth of flavor and makes it stand out among the typical quad. This is a really delicious beer.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with just enough carbonation so as to leave the palate clean, and just the slightest amount of alcohol warmth in the finish.  Overall: I loved this beer. It’s become my favorite American Quad, as well as one of my favorite beers period. Simply outstanding!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Taste is just as complex as the nose; sweet malt up front, with the standard Belgian yeast flavor hiding in the wings; it fades into sweet chocolate and a bit of sweet dark fruit.

The head is light and fizzy and collars thickly around the edge. The effervescent bubbling keeps that collaring alive.  The scent is weaker than most quads but somewhat varied. Plum like aroma is at the front with a touch of crabapple. Hints of malt and cherry can be found amongst weaker scents of molasses and prune.  The feel is strong and thick and is certainly a sipper. There appears to be no alcohol tinnieness but there is a brief harshness at the swallow.  A bit of cherry, malt, sugary sweetness, date or prune, and a touch more cherry can all be found on the tongue. A bit tart and a touch of fig comes near the end.

A little alcohol and some caramel as well, more of both as the beer warms. No hop aroma.  T: Sweet, sweet caramel malt up front with some tartness in the finish. Mostly caramel and dark malt flavors. The cherries come through as a dark stone fruit but in my opinion wouldn't be immediately recognizable as cherries on the tongue. Hops are virtually no where to be found.  M: Heavy on the palate with moderate carbonation. This beer really coats your mouth and the sweet sugary flavors linger.  O: A solid beer overall but perhaps a bit too sweet for my tastes.

42,3457,Roguer,4.53,"A - Absolutely beautiful beer. Completely opaque, dark, with a hint of red.  S - Smells like a quad. Slightest hint of malts and cherries. Slightly sweeter, and less overwhelming, than other quads and Dubbels. Good, two-finger head; extremely mild lacing.  T - Oh wow. Lovely, absolutely lovely. There are three distinct phases of flavor: the initial taste, a false aftertaste, and then the real aftertaste. The first taste is mildly sweet and a bit sharp with alcohol; the second hit is where the cherries come through, as well as prunes (or dates); the aftertaste allows the cherries to linger, and there's a bit of a nutty finish. Not extremely complex, but nice and layered. Very, very pleasant.  M - Not as thick as a quad could be, but very full in the mouth. Definitely sips designed to be savored, not at all gulped. Might be improved at a slightly lower temperature (mine was fresh from the fridge). The carbonation and alcohol combine to sting your palate and tongue a little bit, but not unpleasantly.  O - Very, very impressive. Smooth for a nearly 10% ABV beer. This is a fresh quad; I have two saved for aging in the cellar. This is truly among the best beers I have ever had. It's not the most incredibly complex, but there are some subtleties, and absolutely every flavor is complementary, clean, and lovely.

The aroma is more or less as expected, but no less impressive because of the fact: raisins, brown sugar, cherries, slight alcohol.  Taste is fairly similar to the aroma: brown sugar, dark malts, lots of dark fruit (raisins and figs in particular), a bit of cherry, a fair amount (albeit not an unpleasant amount) of alcohol warmth.

42,3457,BigBarley,3.85,"Reviewed live, bottle I swapped from a friend for a Deviant Dale's 16oz. Poured hard into a tulip, yields a large, khaki head with a strange reddish tint. The body is a murky amber, think if you mixed blood and orange soda.  The aroma is one of wild yeast, a sour cherry smell, and a hint of banana. Almost dusty or woody aromas detectable, some sharp or sour notes all over. You can tell this is a quad but there are definite characteristics of the kriek present. Very interesting  Dark fruit, dark cherry, banana, roasted flavors, a hint of smoke, more dark fruit sweetness, bready hints of malt... Very complexed and multi-layered. The kriek has imparted much of itself in this beer, but it is still clearly a quad. Not a beginner's quad, there is so much going on here it could drive someone away if they aren't prepared for the depth and complexity. There are hints of cinnamon, caramel, banana, plums, figs, wheat bread, chocolate cherries, and that good old funky yeast carrying it all along.  Syrupy mouthfeel, carbonation doesn't really carry over. Thick and hearty, but not unbelievably so.  Pricy beer, but worth it if you're hunting for something complex, layered and unique. I've never had a beer like this one. It has it's flaws, but it is a must try for any fans of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Fizzy light brown head of substantial size, that settles very creamy some lacing. The smell is mostly tart and clean fruits (cherries like they advertise but also hints of prunes). The aroma also contains pungent yeast. Not much unfiltered elements.  T&M: crisp and clean. Extremely well-hidden abv, but the burning in my belly says differently. Not really much of a malty palate. Similar to the smell as far as the dark fruit elements along with some slight sourness. High carbonation, medium body. Very low bitterness bit of sweetness in the finish. Not as complex as I was expecting.  Overall: Pretty delicious beer overall. I think there are some lacking elements to this beer, but nothing that is boldly wrong with it.

I'm almost sensing no alcohol in the nose, they hid it very well.  T-The yeast shows up in the taste as it overpowers everything at the front.

42,3457,JackMcAwesome,4.35,"Grabbed up a 750ml of this finally.  Poured it into my standard pint glass.  Look: Pours a deeply rich red with a two finger head that billows like clouds. The lacing is prominent and stays.  Smell: A dark cherry aroma is the foundation that also has a bit of yeast/malt to it. I was worried about it being in a mug and losing it's aroma early, but it stayed throughout, all the way to the final sip.  Taste: All sorts of things happening. The cherry is definitely there, with a bit of grape in some fashion. The alcohol takes a back seat and is hidden very well. It did not seem like a 9.70abv to me. The malt is featured really well and with the cherry, makes for a relaxing experience.  Feel: A heavy feel that's warming from the moment you drink it all the way down to your stomach. It shares a lot of features with a heavy dark wine in this manner, and with the low carbonation, reminded me of such.  Overall: My first quad, so I don't anything to compare it too, but if they are all like this, I'm in for a treat. I hope to delve more into this style in the future, but with summer fast approaching, I'll probably go with lighter styles for the time being.

Malty and scratchy with some non-hoppy bitterness. The long aftertaste is like burnt raisins and gets stronger as you sip. Less of the dry Belgian character though maybe that is more typical for these sweet Quads.  Intriguing, full of character, but not one for sipping more than a small glass at a time.

I think this is what exactly what they were going for but like I said, I just don't enjoy this style. I shared a bomber of this with my brother in law and I am glad I did.

One of the best I have ever seen.  At first the aromas are of caramel like malt sweetness with perhaps that notable Belgian yeast aroma and a little bit of cherry. Half way through the drink as the beer heats up strong alcohol notes float cherry up to your nose and almost commandeer the malt aroma.  Tasting this beer is orgasmic! You are going to get very nice smooth caramel malts in perfect union (Belgian motto: Strength in Union) with cherry and other dark fruit flavours along with that Belgian yeast taste. Alcohol is in the mix as well, but not crazy hot like you would think with a 10% ABV beer. As the beer warms up, the flavors all become distinct, but still even keeled. Barely any dry hop finish, but it is there and it is just only noticeable making me believe that this is an incredibly balanced beer.  Full creamy sweet mouthfeel with just above moderate carbonation that kind of effervesces the alcohol notes and fruits to your nose as you sip. There is a slight warming feeling as you down your sip.  This beer comes alive as it gets warmer! It's really interesting and entertaining (10% abv) to drink. I have a strong feeling that Ommegang is becoming one of my favorite Belgian breweries! I'm not sure if this beer is absolutely true to it's style, but WOW! I have to give it high 4's!  I'm going to go ahead and give this beer a 4.5 overall. Once I get to know this style better, I may be a better judge, it may go up, it may go down. I don't know, but I am sure to always seek this beer out!  Don't drink crappy beer! Life is too short!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,SurfboardCollector,3.95,"Poured from corked bottle into Duvel chalice. Dark brown color with creamy one thumb head that quickly diminished. Strong smell of cherry at first, settling down to a malty chocolate by the third taste. Taste of chocolate covered cherries with slight alcohol. Mouthfeel is dessert like, unlike the Belgian Quads which have usually one strong characteristic that defines them. Overall, I think the price keeps me coming back to this beer. A comparable Belgian costs about 50 percent more in my area.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BelgiumBill,4.18,"2011 uncorked today and poured into an Ommegang tulip glass. The cork came out easily and poured with a 3/4 inch beige head which receded to a ring and thin blanket. The color was nutmeg brown and translucent at the edges. Smelled of ripe fruits, date, raisin, brown bread. It has candied sweet aromas. Fruit cake and a little booze as you sip it. A viscous body with some light but lively carbonation. Lingering sweetness in the mouth. I had this when it first came out and liked it but I was concerned it might not be so good after sitting in my cabinet for over a year. It held up really well. I don't recall all the characteristics of it when I first had it but I feel like it is more complex and subtle than I remember.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

S- A dry sweetness hits the nose, yeast esters, with a slight cherry malt combination.  T- Malty biscuit, with a slight tang. It may be cherry, but I think I'm just searching for the flavor since I know it's in there. It becomes more apparent with temperature increase.  M- Smooth, deceivingly high ABV is well hidden, but has a slight warming feel, and a stick bitter tang.  O- I think the combination with the kriek is very interesting. It adds tang to what would be a powerfully sweet beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,DenverLogan,3.95,"From corked bottle...packaged 9/6/2012. Label is different from one in BA stock photo...newer design. Says best by 9/2017...I guess I'm jumping the gun a tad! Significant pop...poured into big Gulden Draak chalice. Dark copper brown with big tan head. Big aroma of oak, oats, booze, candy sugar, roasted malts, chestnuts, fresh baked sugar doughnuts. Modest carbonation and mouthfeel. Flavors of tropical fruit rind, powdered sugar, roasted malts, chestnuts, alcohol..let's give this 5 minutest to open up... OK...small head remains...big aroma of alcohol, caramel, roasted malts. Flavors of molassas, bitter tropical fruit rind, alcohol, burnt malts...I'll give this another 5 minutes... Yeah...this is a big, bad, rough & tough and complex quad...the aroma and flavors stay strong from start to finish. Twenty minutes into the brew it's mellowed only a little, which is fine for a quad. What kinda puts me back is the strong fruit melon compared to sweet malts that I might expect from, say, a Koningshoeven, which has varied quit a bit over the years. Not to be rough, and with quads the flavor profile can vary greatly, but, perhaps largely because of the yeast, this brew doesn't have the taste appeal of a St Bernardus Abt 12, Westy, Pannepot, or Allagash Four, depending what you call a quad. Those beer I love, this one is challenging, but also enjoyable for the big beer seeker. Re-edit...50 minutes into this beer it's fully opened up. I'm upping the overall & taste categories, but note, it takes at last half an hour for this brew, even in a big chalice, to fully open and start to resemble the qualities of the above mentioned brews.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Served in a snifter.  A: Pours a deep, rec-brown, cloudy, cherry color, with a short light tan head with bits of lacing  S: Incredible aroma, rich fruitiness, plums, cherries, bananas, simply wonderful, also yeast is very dominant, vanilla as well, malt sugars, very inviting  T: Robust flavor to it, very complex, enriching. Yeast is very present, also fruity notes, cherries, plums, it is a fairly sweet beer, has earthy tones to it, yeast, malt sugars, wheat, barley, hints of citrus even, also alcohol is very present.  M: Fairly balanced, at times I felt it was over carbonated, but the robustness, complexity and richness of the flavors well overcame the carbonation, booze levels gave a nice, complementing warmness to it.  O: Of course, Ommegang, lives up to it's name, I've never been disappointed by an Ommegang beer, and probably never will. Although I got the beer for a good deal, it is generally expensive but it its well worth it, wonderful taste, very rich and robust, very delicious, basically a dessert rather than a beverage, at least once everyone should make the effort to try this.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,coreyfmcdonald,4.09,"750ml bottle into a snifter  A: Pours a clear dark amber color with two fingers of off white head.  S: Strong prune aroma in this beer - dark fruits really dominate the smell. As i keep smelling, i get some dark cherry and a hint of sour cherry with the prines. I get a bit of clove and orange bitters in the background, but it's faint.  T: Prunes are still quite strong in the flavor, but the beer is a bit brighter than I expected based on the aroma. I get dark cherries, a bit of toffee, and a nice, subtle sour cherry finish. Spices are fairly restrained until the finish, where I get a nice clove flavor to add some complexity and balance. As the beer warms up, I get more and more spices - cloves, cardamom, and orange bitters. No hint of ABV.  M: Medium thickness for the style with strong carbonation.  O: Age has done this beer well. I got no boozy taste whatsoever, and the yeast brought out some nice spiciness, particularly in the aftertaste.

42,3457,Tomhet,4.29,"Appearance is a very dark brown with some ruby tinges when held up to light. A 1.5-finger tan head rests atop the body and dissipates rather quickly, leaving a moderate amount of lacing that continues to cling to the glass. Spiced cherries obviously hit the nose first, but this mellows into an blend of herbs, figs, and roasted malts. When digging deep, that cherry note is so fresh and organic that any sort of harsh alcohol presence is immediately cast aside. Some banana is faint along with the overall breadiness that provides a nice foundation for the nose.  The first thing that hits the nose is a mix of the sweet, organic cherries found in the aroma and a bitter earthy hop note with a touch of alcohol. This mellows into a very smooth bready malt taste that gradually caresses the tongue until finishing with a subdued Belgian yeast note with some of the downplayed banana mentioned earlier. Carbonation is medium to low, though the high point of the mouthfeel is the gradual way in which the brew continually reveals itself, as opposed to the typically discrete tripartite view of ""front, middle, finish"". Overall, a very nice quad and a great go-to beer if you want something a little sweeter than St. Bernardus Abt 12 for a readily accessible quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,JerzDevl2000,3.97,"Had this years ago and finally got a chance to enjoy this again since I was given the Ommegang Ales gift pack for Christmas. Yes, this beer packs quite a punch and the bomber I had took quite a while to down but it was worth savoring every sip, and as so many others have commented on here, this is nearly on par with its European counterparts from start to finish.  The pour to this was quite dark, with a solid head and lacing to match. The sediment that floated in this gave it a near-amber appearance in terms of the glow and the edges just let enough light through to give this a radiance that I've never seen in a Quad before. The aroma was mostly that of sugary booze, as was expected. The fruit did not come out in the nose but was certainly felt in the taste. Lots of plum, cherry, and currant, which was quickly reinforced with the sweetness of this beer that lingered well in the aftertaste. The carbonation was spot on - visible but not overpowering and helped ease the transition into the lemony aftertaste that somehow brought out the sweetness of the brown sugar that stayed underneath the heavier flavors of this beer. It was amazing to have a beer this heavy finish so cleanly without any cloying aftertaste that lingered.  However, this booze did linger and even though I couldn't feel the warmth from this, I could certainly notice the alcohol by the time I finished the bottle off. It's here but the way this was crafted relegated the strength of this brew as an afterthought once the serving was over with. It's a testament to this beer that the teeth behind it didn't come out from the onset. Even though it's crafted here in the U.S.A., you wouldn't know it unless the bottle was in front of you. This was solid from start to finish and worth getting your hands on if you have two hours on your hands to enjoy all that this has to offer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell: Dark fruit, plum, raisins, cherry, banana bread. Alcohol is hidden fairly well.  Taste: Cherry, dark fruit, Belgian yeast spiciness. Starts out sweet but is balanced nicely with a tart cherry finish. Alcohol is bit more present in the taste, but still masked very well.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Carbonation is on the lighter side of medium. Really nice mouthfeel.  Overall: One of the best American quads I've had. Doesn't quite reach the level of some of the authentic Belgian offerings, but it's not too far behind. Definitely worth picking up a bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I guess there is some lingering black cherry in there? The flavor is pretty decent but I am picking up some metallic notes. Also the booze is pretty noticeable.  M-Medium-full. Massaging bubbles. Booze dries you out a bit. The feel is mostly creamy. It has nice texture. Aftertaste lingers.  O/D-Not bad. The subtle cherry nuance is actually pretty cool; I'd rather have that as opposed to a cough-syrup cherry overload. Its a pleasant take on the Quad.

42,3457,JMScowcroft,4.5,"Ommegang - Three Philosophers - 1pt 9.4fl oz ""bomber""  Look - Excellent re-branding, the pictures here on BA haven't been updated yet, but I love the new marketing. This brew pours like a dark burnt caramel with a thick, frothy head. When held up, only a faint glow is seen. When held directly in front of a light, the entire brew illuminates red.  Smell - Sweet scent of cherries with a hint of malt, smells hearty and big.  Taste - Malty bite with a smooth cherry finish, the first thing that came to mind from the bite was nicknaming it a ""cherry porter"".  Mouthfeel - Leaves a bit of a burnt taste, pleasing though, but depends on your preferences I would say. This brew would definitely pair well with something creamy or cheesy.  Overall - Another one of Ommegang's great brews (I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like). This particular brew is a little heartier than my usual preference, but nonetheless, if I had to choose a full bodied brew of this style, I'd pick this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The touch of cherry flavor from the added Liefmans Kriek is, in my opinion, just about the perfect amount to add some sweetness to this dark, rich ale.

Plum, rum-soaked raisin, sweet bread and just a hint of cherry in the nose.  Much more cherry forward in the taste, although it's not the dominant note. Slightly tart cherries intermingle with the plum, raisin and fig, some sweet and bready malt, a little brown sugar and caramel, some earthiness and just a touch of vinegar. The Kriek really sets this off and makes it stand out among the typical quad. Really delicious stuff.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, almost no alcohol noticeable, dry finish.  Quads and BSDA's are more and more becoming one of my favorite styles (and in fact I used to not care for them at all), and this one definitely stands out as one of my favorites.

I pick up the over-ripe banana, berry, and soaked bread notes right after. The finish is bread and booze.  M: Full bodied beer. This beer has some serious heft. It's like liquid alcoholic bread.

There's a mild sourness, topped off by a solid sweetness. The finish is nicely tart, but not so much that it hurts your teeth. These are generalizations, but it's neat that this beer hits several flavor profiles. The tartness is certainly cherry flavored, and finishes very nicely and not too candy-like.

Heavy and syrupy. Smooth and creamy with a hugely warming alcoholic evaporation quality.  Great quad, the lambic addition gives a relative lightness at points but at 2% I is just enough; but it could have used .5-1% more. It will age amazingly.

The boozy end might be blended better, but it doesn't detract enough to find heavy fault (it is 9.7% after all).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Moss,4.57,"A - Pours a reddish brown. Tan, two finger head which didn't take long to go down but left nice lacing.  S - Smells sweet with a cherry, fruity smell. Right on point with what you would expect a great quadrupel to smell like.  T - Sweet, cherries and other fruits from the yeast and kriek. Taste slight liquorice. Complex taste that is up there with the best quadrupels. Slight spiceyness to it.  M - Medium to heavy bodied but has a good amount of carbonation tickling my tounge.  O - Very good tasty quadrupel and very glad I got it. Would definitely age one if I could. This one was bottled 6 months ago so I feel like aging this would be excellent. Drink by date is 5 years later. Only thing I could say about this is I would prefer slightly less carbonation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Kevin73,4.55,"This is my personal favorite quad. Pours dark brownish red with a thick egg white head and lots of lacing. Some quads are dry, others are sweet. This one is on the sweeter side due to the cherry blend. But don't mistake this for a cherry beer because it is merely an ingredient and not the focus. The cherry flavor accentuates the natural dried fruit flavors of the quad. The result is an extraordinarily well balanced strongly flavored beer that is not overly hoppy or malty beer and no hint of an aftertaste. Just beautiful.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,StonedTrippin,4.1,"one of the best, a real unique quad. the beer pours a hazy and pale red to brown color, with a huge rising white head courtesy of the belgian yeast. the nose is very complex, some chocolate, sour cherry, funky yeast, and spices. i taste cherry first, but it isnt sweet or sour, sort of neutral in terms of feel, layered in is cocoa powder, peppery yeast, and some brown sugar. lots going on here, and i feel like this beer may have changed a little over the years. real bright mouthfeel, lots of bubbles and a surprisingly dry finish for a bigger and sweeter beer. the alcohol content is barely perceptible at all. overall this is much different than most quads ive come across, and one of the classic beers from the state of new york. id be happy to make a night on this, really tasty, and i figure more out about it each time i enjoy one. not to be missed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BradtheGreat7,4.38,"Review taken exactly 3 nights ago - winter 2012. I've been overly impressed with Brewery Ommegang's gift box deals I've recently found. An 8 pack with 2x 4 year round offerings and a 3 pack of huge abbey style bottles with a signature glass. Top notch stuff!  12 oz brown bottle poured into a Stemmed Belgian style tulip as the bottle recommends. Label is very appealing and clean cut. The 3 Philosophers themselves make an appearance at the bottom and im spending way too much time wondering who these gentlemen actually are.. Let's get started.  A - Rich ruby brown with an excellent Tan head that dissapates slowly and settles to a solid ring of lace. Lacing offers some superb effects on the glass.  S - Aroma is of dark fruits, licorice, sugary malts, hints of cherry, tobacco, small whiff of wheat, and a good lick of alcohol spice. Top notch Belgian style yeast notes.  T - flavor has some dark fruit up front with faint soft dark chocolate(very faint). Cherry and candied sugar notes are excellent. Hints of peach in the depths. Baked bread character with a semi sweet molasses note. Peppery spices creep in toward the finish. Very complex flavor that's sweet, spicey and tart with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Ommegang's Belgian yeast strains are scary good.  M - fairly Smooth and full bodied. Very complex mouthfeel that's moderately drinkable. Very enjoyable brew nonetheless.  O - I have grown fond of Brewery Ommegang and even more so recently. This Quad is a Very unique brew that screams complexity with the blending method Ommegang uses. Three Philosophers is unbelievably unique with its complexity yet remaining wise with its tasty character. It's a true work of class from a brewery who doesn't pretend to give you Belgian style ales for the fact that they do give you Belgian ales and quality. I'm definitely putting one of these in the cellar as I know for certain it will sit nicely as time passes on. However I will buy a few more to enjoy now. 3 philosophers is one of the greatest quads ever brewed and luckily the majority of us can grab a bottle of this.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TownDunkel,4.02,"I'd been itching to try this one, just had to wait for pay day to enjoy it!  Appearance - A really smart reddish brown, i guess a bit of the fruit coming out in it. Also, a heavy cream head that tops it off.  Smell - Cherries, tobacco, wheat tones. Really top of the line scents  Taste - Smooth, luscious, and complex.  Mouthfeel - Good feel that sticks around but only seems like the cherry taste is there. I wish the complexity could have stuck around  Overall - This is a nice beer, I would make this a daily drinker if I won the lottery",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JimTeal,4.37,"Yumm, yumm. Malted banana nut bread in a bottle. This is a very acceptable and drinkable beer, far from excellent but very good. The first scents of both banana and with a nutty subaroma make this one intriguing. Upon further review as I enjoy this beer, it does hang in to a nice flavor, well worth giving a try. I have developed a big soft spot for quads anyway, so anytime I try one this accomplished and up front I just relax, enjoy and don't overanalyze. The Liefmans Kreik is right there and adds a bit of mystery to the overall finish, Enjoy this one with a friend, it's special, different and I'll comment later on it's aging properties.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Resuin,4.13,"750 mL served into a Golden Monkey Goblet. This is a 2012, so still relatively young.  Appearance: This beer pours a lovely cherry-wood color and leaves about a half-inch of off-white head. The beer's deep, rich, dark mahogany color is one to behold, I am a fan of the look.  Smell: Surprising underwhelming, but not in a bad way. Definitely some cherry in there, but not overpowering by any means. Some oak, caramel, pleasant.  Taste: Woody, the alcohol definitely isn't overbearing but adds to the taste. Finishes with a crisp cherry flavor. The cherry really ties this beer together, and separates it from other, more traditional quads.  Mouth-feel: A good amount of carbonation in this one, pretty smooth for this type of beer. I am a big fan of the feel of this one, the carbonation is very well balanced - not light but lighter than most quads.  Overall: A great version of a Belgian Quad. I really think the cherries add to this beer and make it a strong, unique brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

S- Not an overpowering nose, but enjoyable, filled with dark fruits and of course, cherries. The alcohol peaks in here.  T- Any alcohol noticed in the smell is not present in the taste. The mouth is filled with an awesome complex of sweet dark fruits, cherries, caramel, and Belgian yeast spice. I love this, plain and simple.  M- Mouthfeel is spot on. Full-bodied with a small amount of carbonation, but just enough to tickle the tongue. Creamy and delicious.  O- My favorite quad and one of my overall favorite beers in general.

42,3457,ummswimmin,4.2,"I've had this bottle in my beer fridge for about 9 months. I don't know why I kept putting it off, but it felt like a good beer to open night. This is the 2011 vintage.  I poured this into a glass that is a hybrid chalice open/tapered glass. There was a ton of foam from the pour. The coloring is deep red, which looks pretty good when held to the light.  Off the top I pick up the belgian yeastiness. There is also some fruity presence. Smells like a good quad.  The flavor is very, very good. I like the blend of quad with the cherry base. The balance is exceptional.  Overall a very good beer. I recommend getting some. It should be an easy trade if you don't have it in your area.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,PhantasIPA,4.42,"Three Philosophers has a reddish-brown color. The beer is pretty cloudy. It poured with a 1 inch head and left a heavy lacing on the glass.  The smell is powerful. The high alcohol content (9.7% ABV according to my 750ml bottle) is present, as is a dark, rich, fruity aroma. It is pungent and smells like apricots and cherries. There is also a hearty, barley scent that is mixed with spices that are reminiscent of pumpkin ales.  The taste of this beer is very similar to the smell, as it should be. The hearty, yeasty, barley flavour is present first. This is followed by the dark, fruity flavours and then the spices show up. The high alcohol content is present with every drink but it does not interfere with the complexity of the brew; in fact it only adds to it.  The mouthfeel is heavy! It is not too carbonated. The apricot flavour and the heavy barley sit on the tongue in a pleasant way.  Overall, this beer has a flavour and feel like few other beers. It has a unique taste, it has balance and it has a high alcohol content; all of which are factors that I enjoy and why it earns high ratings from me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,alesaram,4.15,"I decided to drink this brew again before rating it and I was not disappointed. While it was not as ""hoppy"" as I remembered, this is a great beer to share with friends new to the brand. Popping the cork, you could smell the sweetness of the cherries that makes your mouth water. Pouring it in the glass, it was very smooth, thick, and showed minimal carbonation. The head was a beautiful pale with just a slight rust coloring that makes you just want to 'taste this beer!""  I was a little shocked though by the sudden sweetness and it's consistently throughout. If you are looking for a true taste of hops, you might have to wait a while. Even chilled the Three Philosophers was thicker than I remembered but it is a brew to be savored, not slammed. All in all a really good brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,washburnkid,4.36,"Frothy light tan head over chestnut brown. Aroma is wonderfully complex, with dark fruit and a mild sour note. Berries and alcohol with a deep pull. Flavors mirror aromas, sweet and tangy and sour. Nutty and bready malt is noticeable as well. Each last sip is tangy stone fruit. Medium mouthfeel leaving a bit of a sour residue on my palate. Good carbonation, good froth retention, and good lacing. It's gorgeous to look at, it smells wonderful, and the flavors are well balanced. Ommegang does a great job with this style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,LiquidAmber,4.2,"A side by side tasting of a fresh bottle and properly cellared 2009 bottle. 2012: Poured into an Ommegang flute glass. Pours a medium to dark red mahogany amber with a fine two finger light tan head that slowly dissipated, leaving lacing. Spicy aroma of dark and dried fruit, light caramel malt, slightly vinous. Flavor follows aroma with dark and light stone fruit, apple juice, cherry and light caramel, finishes semi-dry with residual cherry and light wood and herbal bitterness. Medium bodied, just a hint of creaminess. A very nice, well made quadrupel that was a pleasure to drink.  2009: Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass. Pours a medium to dark red mahogany amber with a fine two finger light tan head that slowly dissipated, leaving lacing. Visually very similar to the 2012 with the same color, head and the head height was identical. The head on this 2009 was much more persistent and had barely subsided to half height after 10 minutes, leaving massive lacing. Similar aroma of dark and dried fruit, light caramel malt and a little sour. Flavor with similar components of dark and light stone fruit, apple juice, cherry and light caramel, finishing with more complex dark fruit, slightly oxidized, but a bright cherry element. Body is significantly heavier, with a very nice creamy mouth feel. The flavors have dramatically integrated over the years, becoming less distinct and bright, but combining into a great cohesive, rich dark fruit flavor.  I honestly can't decide which I like better. The 2009 has beautifully aged and mellowed, but the bright fruit and cherry flavors in the 2012 are quite nice too. The scores are very similar, except the 2009 gets an extra half point each for the exquisite long lasting head and improvement in body. I will definitely age another one of these just to have this debate again. It's win-win.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Theheroguy,4.48,Brewey Ommegang never ceases to impress me.  This beer is a deep red color like the dark cherries that went into it. Curiously if you're like me and lift your glass above your head you see that from this angle the beer looks to be a bright red color.  When I smelled this beer the first thing I got was big dark fruit aroma most likely from the cherry ale component. Following that there was some malt sweetness and then familiar Belgian yeast aromas.  Taste wise it is very similar with dark fruits and sweetness. The Belgian yeast is not nearly as prominent as it is in the smell.  Being a quadruple and 9.8% ABV you should enjoy this over a long time.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Darkmagus82,4.08,"Poured from bottle into tulip glass  Appearance – The brew is poured a hazy ruby red –brown color brew with a nice two finger white head. The head fades over about a two minute time span to leave a moderate amount of lacing.  Smell - The aroma is of a yeasty and cherry nature. Mixed with these smells are nice aromas of a bready, sweet caramel, and a nice spicy nature. A rather tasty smelling brew.  Taste – The taste begins rather large of a more bready and cherry flavor. As the taste advances the fruit flavor of cherry grows even stronger with some notes of a more yeasty as well as a lighter more “wild” sour and tart flavor coming to the tongue. Other sweet flavors of a more toffee nature then come to the tongue more toward the end of the taste. These when combined with some alcohol and a light toasted flavor leave a balanced, fruity Belgian flavor linger on the tongue as the taste commences.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the just above average side in terms of creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The creamy body is nice for the more yeasty and some of the fruit flavors. But yet with its carbonation the beer is still more on the refreshing and drinkable side (even at ~10% abv.)  Overall – A quite tasty beer. A nice quad with all its fruit, yeasty and boozy flavor, but mixed with a nice but balanced cherry flavor. Very enjoyable and drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The very light tan head picks up a touch of the red hue and has long lasting creamy bubbles that form a thin head and leave fine lacing on the glass.  S: Cherries, Figs and some malt sweetness that kind of comes together like candy coated dried fruit. There is a light perfumey alcohol note and mild Belgian esters and very light peppery phenols.  T: A moderate cherry tartness with light fig flavors. The light malt sweetness is counter balanced by the fruit tartness and a light hops bitterness. There is a moderately-light peppery phenols. The balance is slightly tart and bitter. The finish is slightly sweet and the aftertaste is of dark dried fruit and a light hops bitterness.  M: medium bodied with moderately-high carbonation.

I smell caramel, toffee, cherries, alcohol, and yeast. The aroma from this beer is fairly strong and long lasting which I can appreciate. The taste is mostly malts with rich caramel which is then followed slightly tart cherries. The cherries are not over the top but mesh just right. This is a medium bodied beer and is smooth and coats my mouth. It finishes with some effervescence from the carbonation followed by cherries and leaves a toffee flavored aftertaste. An excellent beer for a cool autumn day, rich flavors of caramel and toffee coupled with cherries are a fantastic way to keep my palate craving more.

A - Pours a walnut color with off-white large head that disappears rather quickly leaving a thin topping that lasts forever.  S - Very nice blend of Quadrupel (strong Belgian yeast character, biscuity, dark fruits, estery, spicy) with obvious aromas from the Kriek (ciderish/tart notes from sour cherries).  T/M - Dominated by the Quad character at first but then blend nicely the wild flavors and finishes with a slightly tart feeling. Smooth palate and nice touch of alcohol which adds a warming feeling and spices to the mix. Sweetness is kept moderate to give space to other flavors to develop (esters and cherry).

S - Cherries initially, then comes a wave of rich malts, caramel, dark candied fruits, toffee, brown sugar and spicy yeast. A touch of warming alcohol on the finish. Smooth and rich.  T - Ripe cherries, caramelized dark fruits, oak, brown sugar, and a yeasty finish. Incredibly delicious and smooth with all the right Quad notes. The finish has a light lactic twang, almost in the form of oxidation...but its very pleasant and complimentary. Mouth feel is creamy and medium bodied with the alcohol very well hidden.

In the glass, the beer is a dark brown, copper and rust color. The head is about 1/3rd inch high and end up retaining roughly 1/3rd of that; thicker around the collar and with a dense blob of foam in the center. Thin sheets of solid lace.  Dark cherry notes move about the aroma, blanketing layers of banana bread, dark bread, raisins and figs. Some sweet, sugary overtones, too. Mild spiciness. This smells quite nice.  The flavor actually kicks off with a dose of earthy, almost herbal hops before shifting to spice and black pepper that are made a point of focus by vigorous carbonation emerging med-sip. The feel is full, bolstered by a large bready flavor; baked, toasty and dark. The cherries are easily appreciable, though, to me, they seem better blended with the rest of the flavors than with the aromas. Other dark fruity sugars rest near the bottom; notions of raisins and prunes. Hints of dates. The finish is earthy and somewhat nutty with long lingering residuals.  This is my first time trying Three Philosophers after passing over it for several years. I like it a lot for what it is, an American take on a Quad. With cherries. It is malty, and even sugary, without being too sweet; it treads that distinction with conviction.

Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, pepper, earth, toast, molasses, cherry, toffee, chocolate, herbal, and yeast spices. Lightly tart earthiness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, toast, cherry, pepper, herbal, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit.

S - Surprisingly subtle, even when allowed to warm for several minutes. Dark fruits, no noticeable malt or bitterness, which is a bit disappointing, but no alcohol either.  T - Sweet and filling, with a stronger hoppy/ester character than the nose would lead you to expect. The cherry takes on many characteristics throughout the sip - at times sweet, late in the bottle and in the back of the throat, it can become more tart. That change can be very interesting, but it is subtle. The fruitiness of a fortified wine. Alcohol comes through more in the aftertaste than in the first taste.  M - Significant alcohol bite blends well with the carbonation as the luxuriously thick liquid flows over the tongue. The best characters of the taste remain in the mouth after swallowing without leaving the feeling that it has coated your mouth.  O - Used a brandy snifter (closest proximity to the right glass - something I need to remedy). This is a very enjoyable slow quaff, but I'm glad I took the time to update my ""had it"" to a full review, because I believe I was too generous.

Fades somewhat quickly. Moderate lacing but good head retention.  S: Really nice strong and sweet chocolate. Hints of caramel and dark fruits. Some earthy yeastiness with a little spice.  T: Lots of sweet chocolate and cherries up front. Dries out and becomes more bitter with some tart cherries instead. Chalky cocoa, char and earth in the middle. Spicy and quite dry on the back end with hints of smoke.  M: Fairly effervescent, cuts it down a bit. Very dry.  O: Not a bad quad, the cherries add some nice complexity without overpowering it. Has some roasty aspects even though I don't think it actually has any roasted malt. Chocolate and char and smoke in there for sure though. A nice semi-tart and quite dry quad, if that's you thing.

42,3457,Mgm54,4.6,"2011 25.4 Oz Bottle, cork in cage, poured into a brandy snifter  A - A wonderful deep copper color. only small amounts of light coming through the beer  S - Great traditional Quad smell. A nice bled of sweetness and booze, with the malt sweetness in the forefront. Just the right amount of booziness for my nose.  T - This is what I want my quads to taste like. slightly sweet, with notes of mild winter spices and smoke. Has a boozy finish, but one which is just right for a Quad. I often find quads too boozy, such as I prefer the Westy 8 to the 12, and this booze taste feels just right. I would give the taste a five, but I would like some more complexity to the flavor such as those found in Westvleteren 12, Rochefort 10, and St. Bernardos 12.  Feel - smooth and lightly carbonated. The blending in the the Kriek seems to make it extra smooth.  O - Fantastic beer. I was skeptical to buy it at first because of the blend, but the Kriek seems to be only a slight addition of it, and it truly does balance the beer out; it mellows out the booziness of the beer that can sometimes mask the complexity that quads should (and mostly do) have. If you see this beer, pick it up. Even if you don't usually like the style, this one might surprise you.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Deep ambers and rubys swirl together under a massive head that has a delicious chocolate tint.  S- Again smells almost identical to a Trappist Belgain quad with very deep dark fruits that are complimented nicely by the alcoholic undertones. The malts are present throughout all the nose and are consistently appreciated.  M-Not as creamy as I would have liked. That is not necessarily a characteristic of Quad's, it is simply a personal preference.  T-Very nice American Quad. The fruits shine through first and foremost with a different note on every sip. Cherry is very apparent, but the more I drank the more the citrus became noticeable. The malts are a touch too smokey for me that leave just a bit too harsh of an aftertaste, but over all very nice.  O-One of the best American Quad's I have had. Not quite up to Belgian standards, but hardly anything is.

The aromas begin with dark caramel, brown sugar and some slighly darker roasted malts. As it warms you get a lot of dark cherry and prune with emerging Belgian yeast spicy phenols.  The tastes initally brings a burst of dark sour cherries that is tempered by the sweetness of caramelized brown sugar. As it warms there is a strong Belgian yeast spiciness coupled with a hearty bready malt backbone.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Overall there is a semi-dry, slightly sticky finish.  Overall I am just not toally sold on this beer. This particular bottle is around 4 years old but I still don't feel the flavor profile has melded enough.

Some threads of banana bread. There's a lot going on here. I don't know why I never tried this in the past. This is a fantastic Belgian-style ale. Its a blend of a Quadrupel and a classic Kriek.

I get some cherry, raisin and a little grape to the aroma. The Belgian yeast gives it some earthy spice notes. It's got a great mix of lighter, crisp fruits and darker, sweeter fruits. The yeast spice brings it all together, and it comes together pretty perfectly.  The taste shows a little more of the lighter, crisp fruits up front with notes of grape and apple. The finish is where the darker fruits and malty flavors come out with some really good notes of cherry and caramel linger into the finish. The yeast spice is there throughout, but doesn't dominate. Again, the flavors really come together well.  The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and silky smooth. Carbonation is a little above average. Overall, it's a great version of the style.

The cherries also come through in the flavor pretty well and I do taste the alcohol. The beer is also a bit tart, which is expected since this is a blend of kriek and a Belgian quadruple.

42,3457,TheElusiveAlexT,3.47,"Appearance: This beer is a dark, cherry hue with a thick head at the pour. The head thins out to a little thicker than a collar and stays with the beer until the bottom of the glass were it pools. Lacing sticks well to the glass and there is a moderate amount after the beer has been finished.  Smell: Strong smell of cherry and raisins with some spice kicking to your nostrils. A prominent and aggressive odor that is pleasing. The beer is here ladies and gentleman. Sweet malts and a little grape linger. The hops are not present or perhaps hidden by the spice.  Taste: Like all the other reviews on BeerAdvocate I would agree that the taste is similar to the smell only slightly missing the mark leading to disappointment. Yes the cherry is there but its drowned out by the pomegranate and is deceptively sour and acidic. Its not unpleasant, its more like it promised more from the smell and then didn't deliver. I also disagree with the other reviews about it being somewhat sweet from the malts, it should have been sweeter to round out the sourness.  Moutfeel: Medium-heavy side of a beer. Carbonation is present but it feels like drinking a glass of wine more than a beer. Hell of a kick too (9.8) either that or its because I'm a lightweight.  Overall: This is a enjoyable if you have time to sip it and can drink it with someone else. Treat it like you would treat a glass of wine.

I do like wild and complex beers. This one meets that description.

The beer is a deep plum color, though it retains more of a seedy brown hue than purple. A bit musky.  Smell - Smells oddly of Brett yeast to me, and reminds me more an American wild ale. Tart dark cherry and plum with a light grainy smell.  Taste - Oh my. I wasn't quite expecting such a strong assault of cherry and pomegranate. The fruit and alcohol destroy the palate, but not in a good way. Heavy carbonation combines poorly with the beers ingredients.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Quite unpleasant if you ask me. Fizzy cherries are soaked in alcohol and then smashed in the mouth. The alcohol is unpleasantly mis-balanced, and the aftertaste is among the worst I've encountered. I wouldn't call it sour, more funky and odd.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TheCondor,4.25,"I was actually at World Market the other day shopping for a new computer desk, when I happened upon the Three Philosophers. I have heard a lot about this beer, and was anxious to try it, so I grabbed it. I shared a little with my neighbor, but certainly drank enough of the 750mL bottle to do a solid review. Side poured with medium vigor (not to disturb the sediments) into a Boulevard tulip.  Appearance - Pours a deep brown color with a nice, two finger head that is very creamy and stays around for a while. No real lacing observed, or carbonation action inside the glass. Looks like a good beer though. Cool bottle.  Smell - The nose is dominated by fruits, spices and a lot of sweet maltiness. It is a fairly complex nose, but delicious. This beer, just like it says on the bottle, needs to be poured aggressively enough to get a decent head to release the scents, which are fantastic. Cherries, berries, and raisins are strong in the nose. Alcohol becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.  Taste - Much like the nose, strong, sweet malts being a little more pronounced on the palate than in the nose. Again the fruits make a strong showing, as well as some spices. No detectable hop character, mercifully.  Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth, alcohol can be detected more and more as the beer warms. I think it is a good complement to the taste, but to those who do not like booziness it would liekly be a turn off. Medium body, low carbonation.  Overall - From a dood who doesn't like Quads much, this is an outstanding beer. Many of the Quads I have had should be ashamed to be in the same category as this one, as this was an excellent beer. Highly recommended, I will buy and drink this again. And it has a cool bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Light to moderate aromas of dark fruits (raisins and cherries) along with some spices. The smell intensifies as the beer warms and the presence of the alcohol can be observed at that point.  T: The flavor is similar to the smell but with a very strong sweet malt body.

Looks great with a big tan head with medium lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance is the most impressive of this beer. The nose is cherry syrup and it just eats up everything else. The yeast in the background, the malt, all are eaten alive by the cherry on this nose. I just couldn’t get past it. The cherry eases up on the first taste. There is lots of fruit ester, phenols, and of course, cherry. It’s very fizzy, and very big on the palate and finishes quite dry.

Also, it tastes pretty hot. Lotta booze coming through.

T - Quite a weird Quad the cherries make it very tart clashing with the alcohol giving it a acidic finish. Mild fruits and yeasts make it kind of enjoyable but ABV is very noticeable.  M - Heavy bodied and acidic.  Overall it's really not worth buying again and kind of cloying. Not that's its bad it's just a bit much.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BostonHops,3.65,"12oz bottle served in a chalice.  here is an example of a highly regarded beer that, while good - definitely above averge - just didn't live up to expectations for me. well, to each his own.  pours a deep reddish brown with a finger of beige head; middling retention, strong lacing. aroma offers cherries, plums, yeast, alcohol. taste follows the nose, except - and maybe this is me - you lose some of the yeast characters evident in the nose. some caramel and muted spice notes. mouthfeel is medium bodied with some prickly carbonation... pretty drinkable and worth trying - interesting take on the style with the lambic addition - but not on par with the upper echelon (i.e. belgian/trappist brews).  original review: 07-13-2010",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,argock,3.77,"Poured from a brown 750mL bottle into a oversized wine glass. 2011 on sticker on bottle neck. Sampled courtesy of good friend Nate.  A: Dusty chestnut brown with skimpy cap of off-white head that leaves only bits of lace.  S: Chocolate, dark malt with fruity tones like fig, currant, and raisin, and solid yeast character. I don't get much if any cherry aside from some acidic tartness.  T: The flavor is a little raw with a lot of alcohol blasting through but receding to figgy dark malt with some cookie-ish sweetness countered smartly with the tartness of the cherries. The yeast character is blended in just enough to add more complexity. I would like this more if it was less boozy, which makes me excited to try the cellared bottles I have.  M: The tart dry mouthfeel is excellently done and helps this drink a bit lighter than the ~10%. The carbonation is lively as it should be which also improves drinkability.  O: I liked this beer but I think I'll like the cellared version even more. Planning to crack the 2008 without delay.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Poured about a finger of khaki colored head and then dissipated in to a nice later of foam on top of the beer.  The burn of alcohol is very apparent, but then notes of dark fruit and cherries come out. Mainly the booze and cherries, though.  The booziness mellows out while drinking. Fruitiness of tart cherries, raisins, and prunes. Fairly malty-sweet but not in an unpleasant way. Lingering bitterness at the end that finishes clean.  Medium-heavy body with a creamy amount of carbonation. very smooth and all flavors finish very clean.  Very drinkable and the taste of the alcohol is subdued just enough so you know you're drinking something high, but it doesn't taste like straight ethanol. All of the flavors have their place.

42,3457,jmarklan,4.2,"Pours a very dark amber/mahogany color. Moderate head and nice lacing.  Smells like warming, peppery alcohol, malty and fruity.  Very well balanced and complex. Sweet, bread like malt, caramel and maybe vanilla, very fruity throughout. Cherry asserts itself very well towards the end and is very pronounced, adding some sourness. The alcohol blends in well but is still noticeable as it adds a very warming effect and some spice.  Medium body, smooth, a bit sticky and dry from the cherries.

42,3457,Reaper16,3.43,"12oz. bottle served into a tulip glass  Pours a ruddy, rustic brown color. Like some mudwater where the water has lots of iron in it. Like runoff. The yeast floaties don't help. It doesn't look bad, especially not with the two fingers of tan-inflected foam, foam the color of coffee with a lot of milk added.  The aroma was surprisingly... distant and closed. I pick up on the blended cherry sweetness, and there's a bit of raisin. But the malts are mostly lacking. The yeast strain gives off a lot of cloves, but that's it. It's an unrefined aroma, and I wasn't expecting that.  The taste is better: there's a richness to the malt profile that the aroma didn't at all hint at. Caramelized raisins, fruitcake, and cherry candy make for a sweet sipper. The beer lacks pizzazz, though. It lacks tastiness. It has positive flavor components, but they aren't in an optimal balance or level of intensity.  The mouthfeel is pretty spot-on, admittedly. The attenuation level is Belgian-appropriate. The body is in the medium range and lifted up by the active carbonation. It's super-sweet but balanced a bit by the yeast's phenols and spice. Overall, this is an above-average Quad. A damn fine American attempt at the style, but not a great example compared to the revered Belgian inspirations.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Cherries and sourness up front. Some grainy and musty aromas also make themselves known, but they are more subtle.  Tastes of dark fruit (more specifically, cherries), and is quite yeasty. A mild spiciness is in the background, but it is still pretty grainy/sweet. Great complexity here.  Extremely well balanced. The alcohol is masked, but the warming quality is still there.

Very active bubbles.  S: Kriek whiff is overwhelming at first, then mellows gradually. Candied cherries, grapes. This is admittedly less insane smelling than expected.  T: Wow. Cherries on the front end (slightly medicinal), then it slowly develops into a malty, rich, beautifully complicated taste. Incredible as it warms; every sip is different.  M: Pretty carbonated -- it dances around on your palate. Slightly numbing. A little sticky as it warms.  O: Three Philosophers is exciting and anyone with access owes themselves to at least a single.

42,3457,deadonhisfeet,4.5,"2011 vintage poured from a bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery tulip. The beer looks beautiful! It is clear and dark reddish-amber in color with a huge chunky off-white head that has excellent retention. The nose is fruit-forward and gives notes of toast, cherries, apples, and grapes.  The beer is medium bodied, highly carbonated, and very drinkable. The first taste is sweet cherries and some rich, malty notes (like shortbread cookies). At mid-palate, the cherries get tart and the beer takes on a wonderfully appetizing, wine-like acidity all the way to the finish. Despite the nearly 10% abv, there isn't even a trace of alcohol in the flavor.  This is one unique beer. I have never had anything quite like it. It seems to combine the complex maltiness of a quad with the tangy acidity of a kriek. Lots of the maltiness is lost, but it is still delicious. I will keep a couple bottles for a while and see how it ages. My only gripe with this stuff is the price. It must be a difficult beer to make.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The fruit sweetness is really present, but not totally dominant, such as you see in the Lindeman's Kriek. The malty base beer is here as well. The finish does have a touch of warming alcohol, but no harshness is present.  M- Bright high carbonation. Very full body, but not cloying.  O- A fun beer to experience. A sipping after dinner beer.

42,3457,EnemyWithin,4.05,"1st time: Bottle into Duvel tulip glass on June 30, 2011 2nd time: Bottle into Duvel glass on March 18, 2011  Appearance - 4 Cherry brown/auburn color. ½ inch of yellow brown head that fades into a thin but complete covering. Mild lacing. Visible presence of yeast, offers slight haziness.  Smell – 4 Very prominent fruity and spicy smell from the yeast . Notes of cherries, plum, raisin. Sweet bready smell, almost like a fruitcake. Also notes of brown sugar.  Taste – 4 Starts with a very yeasty, fruitiness and some bitterness from the hops. Transitions so that the spiciness of the yeast comes through with the warmth of the alcohol. Finishes on notes of dark cherries. Leaves a lingering cherry flavor on palate that is a little sour.  Mouthfeel – 4.5 Really excellent. Perfect amount of carbonation to give it crispness, but fullness off body without being overly heavy. Carbonation breaks up the flavors of the beer so that is doesn’t become overpowering. Really a great balance.  Overall – 4 Better than expected when I had it the first time. But the second time I had it, it didn't wow me as much.  As such, I adjusted my scores a bit. Different than most quads I’ve had before, but despite being distinct with the element of cherries, it doesn’t deviate too far form the style to feel unfamiliar. Sneaky, at 9.8%; cannot detect that amount of alcohol by any means. Very easy to drink, but complex and interesting. Worth seeking out.

I'm pretty impressed with its head, it's a tan color with decent retention and lacing.  S: It's a bit hard for me to evaluate the smell, but it nonetheless has some notes of cherry, mint, darker fruit, and licorice. I like it, but it's not as complex or intense smelling as it could be.  T: I enjoy its flavors and complexity...but there's something missing. I can't put my finger on it, but there's just something lacking. Even still, it has some nice notes going on, and it improves with subsequent sips. I can taste plenty of raisin, fig, mint, cherry, chocolate, and licorice. Good balance and complexity, but it kind of lacks the 'oomph' I wanted it to have. Still, it's a good sipper to cap the night off.  M: It has a fairly thick body with average carbonation. The yeasty aftertaste lingers nicely, and doesn't get in the way of the rest of the beer.  O: I cant figure this one out. In some aspects, it's a great beer, but in the aspect of simply sipping and enjoying it piece by piece, it unfortunately isn't. There's just something hindering its drinkability.

Sweet and malty with enough Belgian character to give it life.  Taste: Candi sugar and cherry cough syrup. Minty with a touch of something akin to solvent. Malts are just as big as the nose. Deep caramel wrapped around a cherry. Biscuit dough rounds out the back. Sweetness is cloying on a big sip. Belgian yeast adds a peppery clove finish. Lots going on. Dark heavy malts.  Mouthfeel: Big and creamy. A higher than anticipated carbonation prevents it from treading in to syrupy (in large part because of the cherry thing). Creamy too.  Overall: Every time I try this beer I have a different reaction. The first time it was mindblowing. The second time it was a giant piece of crap. This time, it's solid.

A thick moderately creamy cap of tan foam presents very well in the glass.  Smell - The aroma is a rich mix of raisins, fig, a touch of cherry, and a deep brooding malt sweetness. Everything is rounded off by Belgian yeast notes. Wonderful pinch of spice.  Taste - Spicy clove up front with rich waves of malt sweetness that is accented by a lightly tart touch of cherry. The cherry blend is perfectly balanced and adds just enough character. As this beer warms, the dark fruit become deliciously complete and the complexity of the malt leads into a long sweet finish with cherry and spice lingering for a long time. Fig and raisin are the most prominent fruit tones.  Mouthfeel - Light fluffy carbonation accent a medium body. Really pleasant as it warns and becomes a bit more juicy and full.  Overall - This beer is a great dessert by itself. Very rich, complex, sweet, and interesting. Ommegang does a great job with this beer and the nearly two years of age have brought the raisiny sweetness even more to the forefront. The yeasty spice is the perfect accent to this sweetness and really helps this beer shine. Simply fantastic!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Brenden,3.83,"Catching up. Notes are recent and thorough.  The color is a thick red-brown. A nice, large, dense light brown head rests on top for quite a while and dissipates very slowly, never fading entirely, and leaves some good, chunky patches of lacing. Cherry is more tart than sweet and quite prevalent in the inital aroma and in the taste. Malt lays down a thick, strong backbone without much roast to it. Chocolate malts? There's something a bit like anise in the smell, and the interplay allows for notes of other dark fruits. Lightly hopped, there's a light hops bitterness with an herbal edge to it underneath the big malt foundation. Once in the flavor, I can't quite get over the tartness of the cherry, as it tends to dominate the other flavors. Sweet, yes, though not very, but the tangy element draws from other flavors. Alcohol is pretty well-masked but quite warming. This is a pretty thick quad, though that may be more an effect of the heavier carbonation than the body itself. in fact it's both, as the body proves to be on the heftier side of medium. There's a crisp nip and a pretty smooth flow to it. I absolutely love Ommegang and everything they do. What I really want is for the tangy tartness to be lowered ever so slightly, and everything comes together for this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,rickyleepotts,4,"I feel like I have had this beer before. Maybe not. I have seen it before, I can tell you that. I love the label, and until I sat down to research this beer had no idea there were actually three philosophers. I like the fact they would sit around and “think about nothing”. I do that. The next time I look like I am starring off into space, just know that I am sitting there thinking about nothing!  Let’s see what this big beer has in store for us. It’s just shy of 10% ABV… bottoms up!  In the Glass: It looks like a barleywine in the glass, and there are tons of bubbles racing to the top. It has a very thick, creamy head that produces a solid lace. The beer doesn’t appear to be thick, but with an ABV that big I am sure it has something in there for the liking.  Nose: With an ABV of 10% I would expect to smell some of that booze. You don’t. The nose is weak, and has a subtle old ale sort of scent. The nose doesn’t stick around either, which worries me. I want this beer, based on all the talk, to be great. No better way to see than by drinking it! Here we go…  Flavor: Whoa. There are like ten things going on there. There is barely any carbonation. Those bubbles are deceiving. You get the simple sweetness on the front half of the palate before the smooth and warm alcohol induced finish takes hold. That heat sticks around too, and gives you a longing for another sip. Be careful though, because a beer like this can and will sneak up on you.  Mouthfeel: It feels good. It’s smooth, and doesn’t have the boozy flavors until the aftertaste. But even then, you are hit with the dark caramel and chocolate notes that make it easy to drink. I have been sipping on a Bell’s old style this week, so I am trying my best to not compare… but it’s close to that.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is good. It changes as time goes by, too. At first the aftertaste is warm, and covered with alcohol. Then it settles down and you get those dark fruits and that chocolate they talked about in the tasting notes. This beer is a quad, and whatever that means… it’s good. I would totally order this bad boy again. Bottoms up people!

Lots of visible carbonation and looks like I poured some yeast in too. Head remains an 1/8"" until the end.  S: Lots of cherry upfront. Smell of alcohol. Hints of oak wood and other dark fruits. Seem to be able to taste the smell.  T: Strong cherry up front, balanced by belgian yeast. Notes of oak wood in the middle. Carmel/molasses malt finish. Not a big fan of cherries so the best part for me is the aftertaste.  M: Fairly light on the palette. Pretty high carbonation. Smooth and drinkable. Doesn't leave any sticky resins on the palette.

Full of spice (clove, nutmeg), sweet malts (toasted but not so dark to be roasted), fruit (plum, fig, cherry, raisins), and a booziness that can catch you off-guard.  M - Medium; rich malty body. Lively carbonation throughout.  O - I have had this ale many times before reviewing. Each time lends more and more awareness. Complex and wild.

Pleasant, but not anything mind-blowing.  T- Deep brooding flavors showing nutty malts and dark fruit. This needs more bottle age to show the sour components.  M- Heavy carbonation and full bodied. The alcohol adds a bit of heat at the end.  O- This is a serious beer and it bears that weight literally and figuratively.

Body is deep mahogany with one finger off white head. head disappears quickly but laces well.  S: A bit less traditional quad here. Not as meaty as its old world Belgian counterparts. Instead, its a bit medicinal and clove forward. Maybe it's the cherries that brings this out.  T: Most of the usual Quad prune and dark fruit flavors are quite muted.

S - Quite fruity on the nose, with hints of cherry, strawberry and red grapes. I'm also getting some chocolate, caramel, and some clove.  T - The taste builds up from a bursting complex fruitiness, with hints of cherries, plums, dates, grapes, even strawberries. Then enter the bready caramel malts, with a slight funkiness from the yeast. Moderate sweetness. The finish is slight tart and bitter, with lingering cherry and caramel notes.  M - Medium (or maybe medium-to-full) body. Medium level of carbonation. Very smooth and creamy texture to it. A bit of clovey spiciness on the palate.

42,3457,TheBrewo,3.67,"We pour a rich, tawny brew showing maroon and reddish hues when held to the light. It holds a half finger tall head of tan bubbles, but this recedes quickly to leave a smoky film over the top of the liquid. Lacing is spotty and wet, dripping down the sides of the glass. There is serious haze with little yeasty chunks. Carbonation appears active. The kriek inclusions are obvious immediately on smelling. These are sour, with big fresh cherries and booze. Otherwise, the aroma is a total malt bomb, with deep caramel, light molasses, and sweet sugars. Clovey phenols add to the cherry as a bittering complement. As we sip, a souring grain mash mixes with fermented cherries and bready yeast. Sweet banana esters add a sugary component, softening the front. The middle moves with those sweet esters, and more white sugar and steely grain. The finish is boozy, but not overly so. The tartness of the cherries finally swoops in, with more steely yeast, and darker, more caramel grain. There is the faintest grassiness of hops as the final drops leave your mouth. The aftertaste is of steely yeast, strong kriek flavors, and lactic milkiness. The body is full, broad, and chewy, while the carbonation is medium. There is big coating, with wet grain and slight metallics affording slickness. There is great froth and cream to each sip, with good slurpability. The abv is appropriate and the beer is very warming. The beer drinks easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. The aroma sets things up nicely, but the tastes showcased a creative way to present a Quad. The blend of the malty base with the sweeter and tarter fruit was very nice, and unique for the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I wasn't sure what I would think of this, as quad's can often be a little too sweet for me, but the presence of the cherries is a great addition and really cuts into the sweetness so it never becomes too overbearing for me.

It took some swirling of the beer to get a good whiff. After doing this, I could pick up breads, raisins, grapes, and sugar.  T - The thing I notice on the first sip is its tartness. The tartness is definitely on the back end, as it starts off sweet. But the tartness fades as the beer warms. After a dozen more sips, the taste is mostly sweet. The sweetness tastes like dark fruits and sugar.  M - Nice and smooth mouthfeel. It is fairly carbonated, but not too much  O - Overall, I am really enjoying this quad.

Pretty much what was expected.  S - Candied sugar, raisins, tart cherry, spice, and reserved malt and yeast tones. It's a modest strength aroma, if a bit reserved, but nice all together.  T - Spicy and tart fruits open. Dark cherries and raisins build over sweet malt and candy. Yeast comes through near the climax, with a bit of tart funk. The well handled alcohol peeks through near then end, but it's far from obtrusive. Well built, and the addition of the kriek is a nice compliment to the beers understated complexity.

The yeast is in there, just subdued.  Taste is fruity, cherry, raisin, spices, malt is there to carry it, but the fruit and spice are the big tastes.  Texture is smooth and rich, great to drink. Bubbly with out being over carbonated, and slightly boozy in the nicest way.  I liked this beer, it lives up to it's claim to have cherry.

Dark tawny-ruby, with a billowing head of lively foam. The lacing on this is quite spectacular. Serving temperature is absolutely essential for this one, which for me was just a few degrees below room.  Nose is herbs, caramel, brown sugar, a bit of booze.  One tasty brew that opens up exponentially as it warms. Rich malt, notes of brown sugar, herbal hops and warming alcohol. A bit of grape, chocolate and a few other goodies tantalize the tastebuds. Lively carbonation, slightly creamy body. Lingering dryness from the warming alcohol. A fine brew for one of the coldest nights of the year.  An excellent quad.

A great sipping and night cap beer, will definitely try it again in the future, worthy getting for sure.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BeerMaverick,4.62,"This is the beer that originally attracted me to good beer.  A - Darkish brown brew that has an opaque character representative of the style. About a half inch of khaki head that lasts throughout the session and produces a nice lace profile. Some sediment is seen floating near the bottom of the chalice indicative of Belgian yeast strains.  S - As expected for a Quad, negligible hop contribution/bitterness. The sweetness of darker fruits is the dominant element here. Some licorice, caramel, and hints of cinnamon are present.  T - Foreshadowed by the aroma, dark fruit represents most of the flavor. Plum, red pear, raisin, fig, and some faint grape make up this niche. Some hop bitterness is present, but barely noticeable.  M - The blatant pioneers of this beer (dark fruits) are what linger in the aftertaste. Complex Belgian yeasts fill in any gaps to make this a truly full-bodied beer. Some sweet malt character presents itself here as well.  O - Despite not being made in Belgium, this beer represents the accuracy and precision with which Ommegang produces tasty Belgian-style ales. Three Philosophers is better than many Belgian quads despite being US-made and it is definitely my favorite American quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

M: Full to medium creamy mouthfeel. The minimal carbonation gives this almost a cordial feel. O: Holy shit! I can't believe how well this beer ages. A fucking treat for sure!

Good retention and a smidgen of lacing.  Smell - Banana esters, cloves, some cherries. I feel like the cherries cover the malt aromas that would really round it out nicely.  Taste - Bananas, apple, and cherries again. A very nice fruit flavor that again lacks a bit of depth that some stronger caramel malt would solve. It's certainly more prevalent in the flavor than the taste, but still leaves a bit to be desired. Earthy dry finish.  Mouthfeel - Very highly carbonated that distracts a bit from the flavor. Looking for more of a slick mouthfeel to enhance the depth of flavors.  Overall - Perhaps my review is a bit harsh, because it tastes great. American Quads are always missing just a hint of something, but I love the style, so it's tough to criticize too much.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,phenomenologian,3.9,"This has that screw on thing, with a cork on it. It pours with a one finger off white head that retains pretty well and then laces nicely. The body is translucent and you can see bubbles rise to the top.  It smells of figs, cloves, bananas, cherries. It has a deep complex flavor where at smelling it it smells very fruity and heavy.  At first taste it is very very complex as it is a quad. As you continue to taste it you can taste cloves and bananas and figs that dissect and come out on their own. It also has cherries and other fruits as flavors that come out.  It is carbonated but not a whole lot. It feels heavy which makes it one of those beers that you drink a bit of and wait a bit and drink some more. Its not one of those that goes down smooth and quenches thirst. Its a complex thing to be tasted and evaluated.  Overall, its not one of those everyday beers but one of those every once in a great while. I like the tastes but the fruitiness is not something Im used to so I have to get used to it, but overall its good and enjoyable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BeerdedEric,4.45,"Poured into a snifter. Beige head with a bloody red body with sporadic yeast sediment. The head fades into thick ring around the glass. Carbonation is noticeable.  Strong bananas, cloves and some cherries. The aroma is in your face. I'm also thinking raisins.  Cloves, bananas, cherries are there,grapes, raisins and some alcohol. Very complex flavors in here and is quite delicious.  Carbonation is on the spritzy side, some alcohol warmth as it goes down, it leaves a dry feeling in the mouth, light to medium body.  I've only had a few Quads before. I'm trying to get into the Belgian Style of beers; most of my focus has been on American brews, so I decided to branch off a little. I have to say, I'm impressed with this style. Very complex and it exercised my palate -- it made me wonder -- what are all these flavors that I'm indulging? I have tried my hardest to describe them, since they are so different than the typical American Style beer; although, this is brewed in America, this has a genuine Belgian taste.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Duvel tulip. 2011 vintage.  a - Pours a deep mahogany brown color with two and a half fingers of fluffy light tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Head lasts for several minutes and leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass.  s - Smells of Belgian style yeast, spices, pepper, dark fruits, cherries, fruity malts, toasted malts, bready malts, and a little bit of molasses. Spice and yeast are up front, followed by the fruit. As it warms up, getting more cherries which is nice.  t - Tastes of spice, pepper, Belgian yeast, cherries, dark fruits, alcohol, fruity malts, molasses, caramel malts, and toffee. Also some light toasted malts and bready malts. Pretty nice.  m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Little bit of alcohol present, but doesn't make it too hard to drink or anything.  o - Overall a pretty nice quad. It's nice that it is available all over the place and year round, though I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper. At first I enjoyed the taste much more than the nose, but as it warmed up the nose got significantly, as more fruit and cherry came out. Worth checking out, and something I would have again.

42,3457,magictacosinus,4.08,"Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.  If Ommegang is attempting to reach maximum authenticity of Belgian Trappist and Abbey styles here at home, they are successfully doing so with this beer. This is absolutely nearly identical to some of the top quads I've had in appearance. The darkened, nearly reddish and violet color of quads is in full form here, as well as having noticeable alcohol leggings and lacing all around the glass. Look at all those floaties as well! Not much carbonation or head, but I don't usually expect any with this much ABV.  Smell is really intense, often resembling molasses, chocolate, raisins and rum - yet more importantly, cherry. Indeed, the smell of dark cherries due to the lambic blend within the beer is so vivid and fantastic here that I may as well convince myself that I'm having a dark fruit drink spiked with tons of alcohol. Yes, there's some zestiness and acidity as well, but those cherries really wash the other flavors away. Not as authentic smell-wise, but fascinating nonetheless.  While I expected a cherry cascade with this beer's taste, some curious things happened upon consumption. At the front, there's tons of bitterness and carbonation that literally shoots out like a jet stream onto the tongue. In the middle, the roasted notes appear pretty openly and the alcohol takes its shape. However, it's what happens at the back of the tongue and throat that makes this beer worth a try: an entire explosion of cherries mellow out the bitterness and roastedness to create a fruity, warming sensation that is absolutely delicious. If not careful, someone could drink this like cherry cola. Still, while its fun to drink, it must be done while it's cold, as it literally becomes a cherry-based syrup when it fully warms up, which can produce nauseating results for those not into that sort of thing.  Ommegang seems to have developed a hybrid of Belgian styles that produces intriguing results. Quite an interesting and experimental beer, and definitely one that is suitable for grand occasions budget-wise - although a Belgian Trappist could do just has fine. Recommended a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The fruit taste that does come through does not hang around for too long. It's still a very good tasting beer though.  M - does not really coat the mouth but does leave a spicy sensation on the lips after having a few sips. The aftertaste lingers from quite some time on this brew.

Colour is a textbook copper; nontransparent.  Sm: Caramel, milk, lovely amber hops, and incredible dark fruit - the best aspect of the aroma. A mild strength aroma.  T: Lovely candied sugar, dark fruit (albeit unfortunately light in the balance), dominant heavy amber hops, and cream. The promise of the aroma, unfortunately, is unfulfilled. I do love the dark fruit that is present, but I wish there was more. Overall, it's complex, well-balanced, and nicely built.  Mf: Smooth, pleasant, and wet. Suits the flavour nicely.

Some may find it too fruity (cherry), but I think it is a classy beer that desereves a drinking.

Some alcohol warmth on the swallow. A lot of dry malt on the tip of the tongue which gets cut off by the big herbal Belgian presence. Some cherry flavor is noticeable.  Alcohol presence is more pronounced as the beer warms as well as the spice.  Unfortunately im not finding anything too special about these beer.

S: Cherries of course!...and a dose of fresh dark fruit and a wisp of vanilla. It really is the combo of the Belgian yeast and cherries that gives this beer its signature aroma and flavor.  T: Mmmm...more cherries. There is a pronounced phenolic presence from start to finish that keeps it dry. This, along with a slightly woody component are nice counterpoints to the sweet and tangy provided by the fruit and bready yeast and keeps it from crossing over the line into being syrupy.

Smell is vinuous, with hints of fruity (cherry, fig) with a nice balanced ester note.  Taste is suprisingly clean for such strong beer, but still flavorful: mixture of malt quickly covered by the mild fruitiness of the cherry and fig type flavors; yeast and ester flavors are throughout with a very light breadiness.

42,3457,jrenihan,4.03,"2010 Vintage.  Beer is a dark ruby red, with a large, thick-looking, off-white head. Head recedes at a moderate pace leaving a good amount of lacing.  From the nose, the first smell that sticks out for me is brown sugar, followed by cherry and some other dark fruit flavours: plum, grape. Bready malt behind that.  The bready malt flavours play a larger role in the taste than I would have guessed from the nose. The cherry and plum flavours are certainly present, as is the brown sugar, giving the beer a slightly syrupy taste. As the style goes, it is fairly dry. A bit of alcohol heat, but not much.  Beer is lighter bodied than expected, carbontation is moderate but comprised of very tiny bubbles. Has a syrupy feel.  I like this beer but it was not as good as I had hoped it would be. I was actually hoping for a more pronounced tart cherry flavour. The cherry is clearly there, but that flavour is not unusual in the style and doesn't really differentiate this beer that much.

I'm really trying to pull out the cherries on the nose but I'm not getting a whole lot though there is an ever-so slight acidic note there as well.  The taste is again dark fruits, very slight acidity, dates, plums, belgian yeast. Pretty nice  The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but it's actually really nice.

42,3457,rand,3.76,"From bottle to Duvel tulip glass  A: The pour creates a huge, foamy, two inch head, which is slow to recede, while the beer displays a beautiful dark amber-red color. Surprisingly little lacing traces the glass.  S: Fruity esters are noticed first, ripe cherries and plums. Plenty of alcohol burn, the volatiles carry grainy malts and an assortment of other scents, banana peel, leather, bubble gum.  T: Ripe fruity esters up front, as the cherry notes bash up against the phenolic undertone. A touch of hop bitterness balances the sweet, fruity nuances. It's layered and complex, but more singular in flavor than I expected. The alcohol bite is there throughout the sip and helps to dry the palate.  M: Rich and creamy. Really smooth, as the carbonation nicely rinses the palate between each sip.  I could name a few Quads I like better, but Three Philosophers has a unique and trademark flavor. It tastes distinctly Belgian, but unlike many US attempts at this style, it doesn't just taste like a ""Quad"". And for such a young brewery, this ale might as well come from a recipe passed down for 200 years.

T- starts out with a foundation of doughy malt and sticky caramel. Soft Belgian yeast that imparts raisin and plum. The cherry gives a touch of tartness with a cherry pit character. A rum like alchohol brings some warmth and some spicy notes. Finishes with a Belgian candy and a dry caramel that lingers on the palate.

42,3457,datalager,4.6,"Ommegang really knows it's Belgians. Three Philosophers is no exception.  Appearance in the glass is stunning. The body is the color of blood orange marmalade...a deep vermillion that begins almost transparent, but quickly reveals loads of sediment for an organic and cloudy presentation. The two finger whipped, ivory head fades with moderate effort and leaves virtually no lacing behind. More lacing and I'd give this a 5 for looks.  Aroma upon opening presents strong yeast, a lovely bread-like smell, that slowly glides into fruit, alcohol, and a touch of hop. Once sipped the bread disappears for me, revealing more of the represented ""cherry-like"" odor, a touch of woodiness, and an increased alcohol presence.  Flavors are rich, sweet, and robust. Plum, vanilla, malt, and raw cherry in the finish, with a citrus hop in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is bright, but not too sharp. I prefer smoother ales, but the representation here is authentic for the style.  This is a dessert beer, through and through. Sip it, enjoy it, take your time with it.

42,3457,ChadQuest,3.53,"After the pour this one is a translucent reddish brown color with a bit of an off white head. The aroma is a hard to pick apart blend of cherry and malts, it is very rounded and uniform. The cherries at this stage seem to be notably tart, at least i expect them to be to an extend, and the malt aspect is rather indecipherable. The bottle says that only 2% are with cherry added before blending, and i think2% is a good amount, any more might be too much, but as it sits right now it adds depth to this beer that would be hard to achieve otherwise. I can tell from the taste that this beer without the tart cherry would have a lot of various dark fruit notes anyway imparted by the malt base, otherwise added to a toasty bread and chocolate nibs.  The cherries really make this what it is, the tartness completes this beer and makes it very good.

42,3457,biboergosum,4,"750ml caged and corked, solid-ass bottle, 2011 edition.  This beer pours, after an ethereal snaking of post-pop ethereal smoke, a dark, hazy, and red-brick amber colour, with one finger of loosely foamy off-white head, which wisps away rather quickly, leaving a few specks of wayward clouds in the way of lace around the glass.  It smells of sweet bready malt, with hints of cherry cough syrup, a sturdy dark fleshy black fruitiness, some middling crackery breadiness, and soft notes of salty licorice. The taste is caramel/toffee malt, one readily consumed by a wallop of sassy dark fruit (plums and prunes, mostly), all mildly sour in their bearing, a subtle yeastiness, more Halls-esque medicinal cherry, and some almost hidden clove notes, with the big-boy ABV quite well obfuscated.  The carbonation is quite sedate, just an updraft here and there, the body a plucky medium weight, and innocuously smooth. It finishes rather off-dry, the fruity malt the life of the party, and Big Cherry the ringleader.  Well, at only 2% of the blend, the cherry Kriek component does well to represent, spurring other thoughts of comparatively low number, high value providers in our cultural midst - I only somewhat kid. I sense here a decent ode to a strong Belgian dark ale, but going all upstart colony with the cherry juicing gag. Once past the academic firsties, I can say that they've succeeded in their melange of traditional Belgian flavours - as my oblivious initial confusion slowly turns to gentle appreciation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,cradke,3.75,"Appearance: Dark Brown with deep plums and caramels when held to light. Light fine head the dissipates rather quickly. Some sediment.  Smell: Raisins, cranberry and other dark fruit. Mild alcohol, and full malt. Very little hop profile is evident.  Taste: Bitter, cherries and plum first with some malt notes. A lasting malt profile. Finishes with evolving sweetness from the cherries and dark notes.  Mouthfeel: Light and thin for a quad. Spreads quickly across the palate with light to medium carbonation.  Overall: A very different take on the Belgian quad. The cherries make for prominent fruit notes and a much more bitter taste. Not enough sweetness to balance out the bitter. Certainly not my favorite but a very interesting take on the quad.  Pouring type: Bottle into chalice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A - cloudy, dark amber brew with a light tan single finger head  S - really delightful on the nose with very fresh floral and grassy notes  T - very light hop character overtaken by complex floral and fruit. Dried apricots and peach. Super tangy and ultra lip-smacking. Sticks in the back of the throat. Some medicinal notes in the finish.  M - fairly heavy with moderate carbonation - not oily, but definitely coats the mouth and throat; delightfully warming throughout  D - powerful but drinkable; leans a little toward being a sipper as one would expect with the big alcohol profile  Great beer - competes will with the Belgian and delivers a powerful and complex punch.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

All that you would expect (dark fruits, malt, brown sugar sweet, toffee) in a quad...with a nice tart cherry addition. This is a very nice surprise.  M: Medium heavy...chewy...creamy.

Strong alcohol blends in and is mellowed out by candy, cherry, caramel, mild bitterness and a hint of sourness. Its definitely exciting and varied.

I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some fair lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for 5 minutes before it was gone.  Smell - Butterscotch, malts, raisins, yeast, spices, earthiness  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an above average amount of carbonation and I can taste lots of dark fruit.. cherries, and raisins, mixed with malts and a bit of banana. There is also a yeasty/medicine like flavour going on. It ends with a dark fruit slightly tart aftertaste.  Overall – The alcohol was very well hidden and the beer was very drinkable. The taste seemed well balanced, but it didn't blow me away as much as I expected it to. It just seemed to be missing a little something in the taste and mouthfeel department. Regardless, it's still a very very good beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Pours a huge head that eventually dissipates after awhile to a nice healthy finger or so of head. Lots of tiny bubbles slowly rise to the surface, seems moderately carbonated. Light lacing occurs.  Aroma is fairly complex. Strong and sweet malt hit right up front followed by complex dark fruits and cherries. Can't detect any noticeable hop aromas. Real slight alcohol aroma.  Up front taste is sweet dark malt with Belgian yeast characteristics, ie dark fruits, a little bit of spiciness too. This transitions nicely into a little bit of cherry tartness. Warming alcohol on the end and more Belgian yeast flavors.  Mouthfeel is right on. Moderate carbonation, full bodied.  Haven't had a ton of quads, but I would say this is better than some of the others I've had. Really think they hit the mark with the cherries. Nothing too much, but a nice complement to the beer. Would love to try an aged one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,amphion1065,3.63,"750 mL bottle from 7/14/11, poured into a Duvel tulip. Reviewed from notes.  Pours a very deep caramel hue, with ruby red throughout. A 1.5-finger frothy light brown head with very tight bubbles forms, leaving sheets of soapy lacing around the glass. Wonderful retention. The only thing holding this beer back from visual perfection is the rather significant amount of suspended yeast.  The aroma is very sweet and fruity. It's a somewhat artificial, cloying syrup smell, but it's still very pleasant. Plums and prunes, but little to no cherry presence. A touch of bready malt. Vanilla.  Cherries really take center stage in the taste. It's a very natural flavor, with a sour twang that offsets the dark fruit sweetness. Lots of bready, biscuit malt. Unfortunately, the alcohol is not particularly well-hidden. There is an astringent bitterness in the finish that is also pretty unappealing.  Carbonation is on the high side, this would benefit from slightly less effervescence. I enjoy the medium body, but the carbonation is distracting.  One of the best American quads I've had. This remains largely faithful to its Belgian counterparts, but the addition of cherries is a pleasant tweak. I'm curious if this would indeed hold up until 7/2016, as Ommegang suggests on the bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Almost has a butter tart aroma to it.  T- Typical quad (stone fruits and sugar) Yeast, cloves, and faint cinnamon. Cherries are sweet with a quick tart finish. Warming alcohol is minimal.

Was glad to see some nice strings of lacing wrap the glass following each sip.  S: Had a cold so my nose was a bit stuffed, but I was able to detect some dark fruits and herbs, with hints of spice on the tail end.  T/M: Lots of fruits, with a great undertone of spice. Sweet caramel malts back up the fruit and accompany nicely, a slight burn from the alcohol resonates on the tongue after each sip of this medium/heavy brew.

Nose is full of sweetness. Notes of dark fruit, some cherries and the nice heavy malts. There is some spiciness, but nothing that noticeable. Taste is very sweet upfront. Lots of dark fruits, cherries and sweet, dark malts. This is what dominates the flavor. Not a lot of balance, but it does finish with some tartness from the fruits.  Mouthfeel is medium to medium-full with that nice smooth carbonation feel that also leaves a little bite on your tongue. Overall, a good brew. Not the best quad I've ever had, but still satisfying.

Notes of brown sugar, yeast and spices. You can taste the alcohol a bit, but not much.  Medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Well-balanced brew that is drinkable.

42,3457,BilbosNuts,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A: This is an awesome looking beer. It pours a solid brown with deep red, sort of purple, and beautiful garnet hues. Light bubble streams rise from the bottom to give it an inviting and lively appearance. Its huge, and I mean massive, light khaki colored head leaves solid lacing and has great retention.  S: Sweet dark fruits (plums, dates, and of course cherries) and your typical belgian phenols provide the foundation for the aroma. A bit of sweet malts and a slight medicinal scent round out the aroma, while a significant touch of alcohol finishes it off.  T: The taste is very similar to the aroma with significant sweet cherry and dark fruits. Belgian yeast is also noticeable with a bit of alcohol at the end.  M: This is very smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. It is medium bodied and leaves a slight alcoholic warming effect.  O: This is a very solid example of a quad. I particularly enjoyed the role of the kriek in this one to give it that dark fruit and cherry input.

Some yeast sediment slowly orbits around within the glass.  S - Strong cherry and wooden tones with a robust sweetness and very pushy pungent alcoholic aroma.  T - Dark plum and cherry of course - all the fixings of a solid Belgian quad. A warm, yeasty characteristic in the backbone with a soothing yet rather strong finish in alcohol.  M - Yeasty, soothing creaminess that persists the whole way.  O - A very valuable Belgian like all of the other beers from Ommegang. A true sipper that some may find a little difficult to get through, especially a 750ml bottle. If I had known what this would have taken, I would have shared with someone else.

There was a nice off white and somewhat pink head that soon turned into a skirt around the glass.  The aroma was a dark rich malts with a slight hint of fruit and Belgian yeast.  The beer tasted wonderful. It was complex as rich malt flavors provided a backbone that included molasses, dark fruits, and raisins. It was accented nicely by a fruity cherry taste and left my pallet begging for another sip and warmed by the alcohol.

T: Right up front, hoppy, bitterness. Transitions to a double punch. First, I'm hit with the black cherries. Then the sweet finish takes over which tastes of maple, caramel, toffee, and smoke. The warming undertones of the ABV is really nice.  M: Up front a whirl of flavor, speaking to this beer's complexity. Carbonation is perfect; it matures to almost a creaminess with the fineness.

It is reddish rusty color like an Irish Setter. It looks the same as my favorite quads like Rochefort 10 or St. Benardus 12.  Smell: Subtle dark fruit smell like a date, fig or even a plum with a minor alcohol smell as well.  Taste: More like a Rochefort 10 than a St. Benardus, more of a tart citrus than a rich spicy flavor, this is more crisp and closer to Rochefort 10.  Mouthfeel: Overall good mouthfeel, but there is a flat aftertaste with this beer. Other than that I would compare this beer to Rochefort in its smooth and rich feel/  Overall: For the value minded BA, this is very close to a Rochefort 10, but at a third of the price. I would rate this very close to Rochefort 10 and St. Benardus, of the different quads I have had, this would be my third favorite. This actually has a better head and lacing than the previous mentioned beers, the coloring is closer, maybe a little bit more ale-ish, clearer than the those two.

Smell: Belgian yeast with a big aroma of cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins, plums, prunes, and brown sugar. Also some hints of clove spice, bananas, and caramel malts. Smells fairly balanced with none of the fruits dominating the others.  Taste: Spicy Belgian yeast up front with a full flavor of cherries that are sweet and lightly sour. The dark fruits follow with notes of raisins, plums, and prunes blending in. Also some caramel malts and hints of banana and clove. Cherries stand out the most in the flavors but they are mild enough to blend in with everything else and avoid being too tart or sweet.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation.

42,3457,plfahey,4.17,"12 oz. bottle (2011 vintage) poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Ruby-amber-brown in color with a slight cast of haze. A moderate dollop of tan foam sits contentedly atop the surface and clings to the sides of the glass when swirled.  Aroma-Alcohol soaked cherries with a sort of rum raisin note close behind. Absolutely redolent of dark and dried fruit, with plum, prune, and black currant all coming to mind, with an occasional whiff of caramelly malt and rich bread pudding peeking through. Banana and slight clove spice appear for an instant, and spicy alcohols round out the profile. Smells fantastic.  Flavor-Lightly sweet up front with caramel and dark candi syrup leading the way. Flavor moves quickly through some rummy raisins and prunes before being consumed by licorice and drying alcohol. Finishes with a burst of black cherries and sweeping alcohol. Dry and almost acrid in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel-Medium full mouthfeel is tempered by typical, moderate to moderately high carbonation, which lifts the beer from the palate. Hefty alcohol warming on the palate hints at how devastingly boozy this beverage can be.  A strong example of an American-brewed Belgian-Style quad-in fact, this does a decent job of standing up to its Belgian counterparts, and I can't think of another American brewer that does it better, at least not as part of their standard line-up.

The aroma is dominated by Kriek than anything else in my opinion. Some malty/caramel-y/candi sugar goodness dances in the background. Nowhere as massive as the best examples in its malts or spices though.  I loathed the taste initially but it seems to be growing on me. I am still having a hard time deciding whether the addition of Kriek works or not and I am leaning more towards the idea that it does. Still not sure if I would want Kriek in my Rochefort. Sweet caramel, slightly tart, definitely too bitter and appropriately tannic. A bit boozy at times.  The mouthfeel is certainly good with low carbonation and good presence on the palate, as one would expect from a bigger beer. All in all it's a pretty mediocre Quadrupel but then it's priced right.

The aroma caramel malts, dark fruits and sweet cherries and some alcohol.  The flavor is toffee malt, figs, and some cherry with a little roast bitterness and some noticeable alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.  Overall, a bit pricey ($16 a 4 pack), but I like. It's a decent quad with added fruitiness from the kriek.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,maleman,3.86,"Poured into a pint glass (sorry, didn't have a clean chalice). The pour was dark amber, almost red with a creamy, tan-colored two-finger head. Lacing was thick and clingy. The nose was leaning heavily to the malt side with some phenol notes detectable. The taste included some subdued clove with a touch of cherry. Not malty at all as I would have anticipated from the smell. I didn't detect any alcohol in the taste, either. It was medium bodied with higher than average carbonation. Overall, not as much punch as I had expected from a quad, but not bad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,aquaderek,4.5,"Poured this beer into a tulip Duvel glass. The appearance of this beer is very nice. It looks like a hearty reddish brown, with noticeable yeast and large bubbles of carbonation. The nose is complex, and changes as the beer the warms. It is sweet and spicy, figs and nutmeg, with the slightest bit of caramel. The alcohol and bitterness is up front followed by a balanced spiciness. Definitely some ying and yang, going on here. Good beer, will drink a few this winter.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,nppeders,4.39,"appearance - murky, brownish, and hints of purple.  smell - cherries, bready malt, raisins and fruity belgian yeast  taste - caramel, dark fruit, plums, fairly sweet.  mouthfeel - nice carbonation, thick mouthfeel, syrupy, with a ton of spritzy carbonation on the end.  overall - tons of dark fruits, caramel, bread, and toffee. Haven't had many quads but this is fantastic. Extremely complex. You gotta love when the smell of a beer is similar, yet different then the flavor.

The alcohol is apparent.  T: Sour up front with sweet dark cherries. Slight spices, and the alcohol comes through heavily. Heavily roasted malt and some fruity hops come out. Yeasty.  M: Heavy and warming. A cold day kind of body. Just enough carbonation to stay interesting.  O: A great beer for sure. It's unique and unbalanced. Different from any other quad I've ever had...but quads are all pretty different.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Cresant,4.07,"Served this 12 oz. brown bottle in a New Belgium balloon glass. 2009 vintage. The beer was a rich, deep amber color with a modest, fine, tan head. Minimal lace.  The smell was of aluminum and raisins. Walnuts and dark bread. Cherries as it warmed.  The taste was fruity and syrupy malts. Brown sugar notes but not too sweet. Muted cherries. Finishes a bit lighter/dryer with some fruits and a bit of tartness. Well hidden alcohol.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a fine, understated carbonation. Easy to drink, not too sweet and far from boozy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Callaghan,4.13,"750ml bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. I got two full glasses out of this bottle, and both were excellent.  A: Pouring gently yielded a nice off white head, about 1 finger height. A rusty colored brew, with hints of ruby around the edge. Cloudy and almost translucent, it intrigued my wife. The head dies after a few sips, leaving moderate, sticky lacing. I have become accustomed to this, but others that haven't (present company) called it ""beautiful.""  S: Confectioners sugar, Sweet fruit like cherries and , more sugar...it smells really sweet. Digging deeper, I get some floral hints, and a malty sweetness, giving me the impression of chewy bread. An alcohol scent keeps everything in check. I've had this beer before, so I know it doesn't taste this sweet, but if this was my first time, I would think I was in for a sip of Kool-aid.  T: Cherries, like a Kriek. But then the ale overpowers, and this I prefer. It pushes the cherry to the background, but it's still present all the way to the end. I get lots of caramel malts, a little alcohol, and then that familiar Belgian yeast. I would not guess this was 9.5%...but then again, most Belgian styles seem to hide the alcohol well, in my experience. On the aftertaste, it resembles a good Dark Belgian Ale, mixed with a Kriek. Apparently, this is what is stated on the label, and it certainly tastes like it. The alcohol is there, but mild, bringing everything together.  M: At first it seemed like it coated my mouth and tongue quite heavily, but I think this is a result of the sugar. After a few seconds, that feeling went away, and it became silky smooth, with a decent amount of carbonation. I would like just a little more bubbles. It almost feels too smooth, as if it is missing some bite, however; this may be due to the fact that I poured it cold, and let it warm in the glass.  O: Another good brew from Ommegang. I have enjoyed this beer thoroughly. It is a simple beer in some aspects, but is complex enough to capture your attention. It does not overwhelm your senses, and pack quite a punch. If you are not careful (or if you like it that much...) it can get you pretty tipsy by itself. You can pair it with a hearty meal, or drink it by itself.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,BeerManDanNYC,4.58,From the home of the baseball hall of fame comes this exquisite and unique rendition of a Belgian ale. A really caramel-sweet aroma leads to an extremely complex flavor with a full mouth-feel and finishes in grand fashion.

42,3457,Kendo,4.35,"2007 bottle (750 ml). Consumed on 9/24/11.  A: Poured into a Chimay chalice. Body is slightly hazy dark amber with mahogany hues when backlit. A 1-finger tan head is on top, settles fairly quickly.  S: Caramel malt and toffee or brown sugar is noted. Lots of fruit too - raisins, plums, berries and cherries are all there. Waft of alcohol at the finish.  T: Nice fruity and sweet maltiness up front - cherries, berries, toffee and caramel malt all do battle for the general impression, but play nicely together. Finishes with a bit of alcohol warmth, but I suspect it would've been stronger had this one not been laid down for over 4 years.  M: Call it medium-to-full in heft. Moderate carbonation with a nice fizziness.  O: Not as boozy as I remember from past experiences with fresher bottles; I think the age mellowed this one nicely. Went amazingly well with a steak from the grill.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,BrewCrew2010,4.3,"A: Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights. Head is a tan, not long lasting, but with decent lacing.  S: Dark fruits, like ripe cherries, dominate the senses. There are some caramel and perhaps chocolate malts in there balanced with some sweet brown sugar and a bit of spice.  T: Very similar to the nose, dark fruits play the main role in the flavor. A lot of raisins and cherry with notes of molasses and caramel. Finishes slightly warm in the end from the high ABV. Overall, a nice complex flavor.  M: Nice creamy texture; full body; mild carbonation.  O: This is one of that beer for me- the one that turned me into a craft beer lover.

T - Cherry and dark, sweet malts. Strong alcohol aftertaste.  M - Creamy and amazingly smooth for a beer this complex.  O - Wow.

Smell - Sweet malt blend. Licorice, some herbal notes and a medicinal feel. Yeast with a faint alcohol.  Taste & Mouthfeel - It's complicated. Herbal and earthy. Hint of a cherry lambic. I'm really having difficulty being more specific than that. Very soft in the hop department. Yeasty thickness. Smooth, creamy, light carbonation.

42,3457,kjyost,4.54,"Same batch as below aged 1+ year.  Notes are similar except cherry has dropped off leaving molasses, brown sugar, raisins, dried cherries on the nose and palate. Lingering alcoholic warmth. More enjoyable than last time around...  Purchased at the brewery 2 months ago. Bottled Aug 8, 2010. Poured into a Duvel tulip (also from the brewery).  Pours a nice clear reddish brown with a nice head and light cap with too little head. Aromas of sweet malt, cherry & raisin. Fantastic, though not mindblowing. The taste though is a little too dominated by the cherry, with a thick maltiness also sticking to the tongue. A nice beer to drink, though the thickness slows you down. I have 4 x 12oz in the cellar and hoping to see how this one ages...  Interestingly at the brewery they said that BA gave this an A+.

42,3457,DelMontiac,3.7,"Poured from a 2010 caged and corked 750ml bottle into an imperial pint glass.  Pours a turbid tea tinged orange color topped off with 2 fingers of popping eggshell head that hangs around for a few minutes before vanishing. Slight lace on the glass.  Aroma is nice. Sweet molasses and simmering fruits like plums, cherries, oranges, apples. Some honey and slight lemon with a bit of bourbon.  Flavors are off color and out of balance for my taste. I get a metallic overtone as I have with other Ommegang brews. I can't get over that. I shared this with some friends and they said the same thing. The cherries are there, just very subtle. I do get some apple, pear, and plum along with some warming booze. Not terribly bad, but not terribly good either.  Feel is medium bite with a bit more fizzy carb than I'd like from a quad. Maybe that's what they were going for.  Overall, I was kind of disappointed in this beer. I'm a big fan of the quad style. It gets a lot of hype, but I just don't see why.  Edited on 02/12/13: After encountering 3P on several more occasions since my initial review, I have raised some of my scoring. I find 3P to be insconsistent from batch to batch and my initial impression was likely made from an off batch even though now I can appreciate the beer only slightly more.

I expected a LOT more from this beer. The only reason why I didn't give the smell a 1, was because I just don't smell anything. Its not offensive, it's just not there.  T: Improves on the taste quite a bit, but I think it's still on the weak side. I get figs and plums right up front, and some toffee in the mid palate. The finish is dominated by alcohol presence and residual flavors.  M: Full bodied and moderately carbonated. This beer is nothing special on the palate.  D: It's okay at best, due to the alcohol.

First the aftertaste, I think it taste like a barely wine at least that is the flavors I taste. It has a slightly fruity, with a wheat-y taste.  Mouthfeel is fine.

Very raisiny flavor. Sweet, with a hint of the metallic when cold. As it warms, I get molasses, a bit of sherry or brandy (lots of ethanol here), dark cherries, some toasted bread and maple syrup. Complex aromas travel through the nose after the swallow. Layers and layers of flavor emerge as the thing becomes sweeter and more complex as it warms. It’s not perfect, but it’s pretty damn close and earns every point.  The creamy, expansive medium body gets steadily bigger in the mouth as it moves, foaming densely. Plenty of booze in the nose and gentle carbonation.  Much passed over; too-rarely purchased. Three Philosophers has always been available, and now that I know how high-caliber this is, I’ll be purchasing more often.

Alcohol pretty much overwhelms everything else in the smell.  T: BIG flavor in this beer. Malty sweetness, some candied fruits, Belgian yeast all under a nice gentle umbrella of alcohol. Cherry on the aftertaste. Complex and balanced.  M: Surprisingly light for a quad, which is to say medium bodied with a fair amount of stickiness, especially in the back of the throat. Lots of carbonation.  O: Definitely a sipper, and good with food. Sweetness and alcohol get pretty overwhelming and need to be cut but something sharp and/or vinegary.

S: Yeasty, medicinal and earthy with tangy dark cherries intertwined with the malt. The alcohol is plain even in the nose.  T: Mind blown. This is delicious and not as strong as I'd expected. Cherry and toasted caramel malt with a slight nuttiness as it waves bye bye down your esophagus. Getting a slightly woody flavor and a touch of bitterness as it warms.

S: Wonderful, warm nose of red vine fruit, toasted golden malt and booze. The damn thing is awesome.  T: Wildly complex. Fruit, malt, alcohol, vanilla bean, black cherries and char. Somehow all of these elements merge together in the mouth to create a sublimely balanced yet agressive brew.  M: Surprising bubbles here. It's got a bit more carbonation then typical for the quad style, but it doesn't drop the ball. It's drinkable and approachable.  O: I hadn't quaffed an Ommegang Three Philosophers in ages, and I'm thrilled to have returned to it. Luckily for me, this is still one of the best American quads being brewed today.

42,3457,Wreckoncile,4.09,"Poured from 750ml into Chimay goblet.  A - Pours a dark chocolate so hazy that it almost completely obstructs light. A thin head leaves limited lacing, but maintains the quintessential center foam.  S - Although ale with cherries is added on this one, the fruits I get in the nose are different. A definite fig note pierces through the maltiness, and some other, more confectionary flavors, possibly caramel. A sweet scent.  T - The taste departs from the scent a lot. The cherry is out front, but sours a bit towards the end of the sip. A sweet maltiness pleasantly balances and counters the sourness of the cherry, creating an ideal compliment, and leaving the overall aftertaste as slightly grassy, but in a distinctly non-hoppy way.  M - Drinkable mouthfeel with some bite and a lingering alochol flavor. The malt softens the mouthfeel and the low overall carbonation makes it an enjoyable sipping drink.  O - A solid offering from one of America's premier Belgian style brewers. The sourness from the Kreik addition really matches well and balances the sweetness of the malt.

Lacing, with a cascade of tiny formed bubbles, clung tightly to the sides as the glass is tilted.  Smell: Belgian yeast hits the nose right away, followed by mild booziness with sweet apple cider, cherry, and spicy undertones.  Taste: Belgian yeast finds its way up front first followed by sweet plums, malty spice, raisins, mild cherry tartness, finishing with just the right amount of alcohol warmth for the style. Flavors are more pronounced as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Thick, but lively as it rolls across the tongue. Perfect carbonation that lends to the creamy, but boozy texture.  Overall: A complex and unique beer for sure. This is a slow sipper to be enjoyed over an extended period of time. I had no problem finishing the bottle with two separate glass pours. Ommegang hasn't disappointed me yet. I really enjoyed the Kriek style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,RickS95,3.68,"This beer looks amazing in the chalice I'm using. It's a rich, cloudy brown with a thick khaki head. The retention is above average, but as it dissipates, there's no lacing. Makes no difference, it looks majestic.  Again, there's a richness to this beer. Spices are prevalent in the nose, as well as some toffee notes and the sweet fruits from the kriek.  While the taste isn't bad, it's a bit disappointing as the flavors don't shine through over the power of the high ABV. Mostly, I can only detect some cloves and alcohol in the taste.  The alcohol is just a bit too strong for this to score higher in the mouth. The heat from the ABV is ever present and overpowers everything else. There's slight sweetness, but the finish is both hot and ever so slightly tart and dry.  I had high hopes for this beer, but it didn't really deliver. The alcohol needs to be toned down a bit so the cherry plays more of a factor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A: Pours a deep woody-redish color with a huge, dense and oily dark tan head that took forever to fade into a thick fuzzy film that left some decent patches of lacing down the glass. S: Sweet and spicy notes of dark fruits, green apples, red pears, cardamom, Belgian yeast and the cherry kriek it’s blended with. It’s lightly tart smelling, and just a tad musty. T: Follows the nose with a complex blend of fruits, Belgian style spices, and tart cherry skins. I definitely get flavors of plums and rich buttery toffee. The finish is herbal and a bit syrupy. M: Very airy and fluffy carbonation over a medium-thick body create a full yet soft mouthfeel. The alcohol is noticeable in the finish, but it’s not all that warm or distracting. O: A very enjoyable and unique version of the style with the addition of the kriek. It wasn’t as bold or complex as the greatest of the quads, but I loved drinking this nonetheless. This would age nicely, and I may have to re-review after I sit on a bottle for a couple years. I bet the alcohol would become more integrated and the flavors would become deeper.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Small tight bubbles that slowly reduces to a thin film atop the swamp.  Smell-Sweet, but not overly sweet. Dark fruits with some sourness. Black Pepper. Whats great about the aroma is that it's not overbearing, just very inviting.  Taste-Tart cherries up front. Sweet malts along with some pepper. Towards the end you still get some cherries along with the other dark fruits and some nice spices from the yeast. The sour cherries definitely adds an extra element I really enjoy.  Mouthfeel-Creamy, light booze. Medium bodied with lower carbonation that I prefer.  Overall-I prefer this over St. Bernardus. The light tartness adds that extra ummmphhh that I like. The lower carbonation level really lets the flavors shine as well. Great beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

There was no gushing though, guess the yeast has done plenty of munching over the past four years. This brew pours a hazy deep ruby color with a modest head that quickly drops down to a ring around the edge of the glass. The aroma is big on sweet and dark fruits, and not too much else.  The taste is excellent, this bottle progressed very well. The sweet fruit flavors, especially cherry, are still dominant, but lacking their sharp edge. The dark fruits and chocolate get their chance to shine on the finish. There's a nice backing provided by the yeast. The alcohol sometimes present in fresher bottles has now completely mellowed, this is now a super-easy drinker. The mouthfeel is solid, it's lightly carbonated and goes down very smoothly. The drinkability? Off-the-charts. This brew just goes down so easily, any hint of alcohol this beer presented is completely gone, making this one very dangerous.

42,3457,Kuromaru,4.14,"Appearance--Pours an opaque, lightish tawny/ caramel with a full, creamy two-finger head. Very complex in appearance, with an array of colors presenting themselves in the light. Retention wasn't fantastic, but otherwise very, very nice to look at.  Smell--Sweet bread with notes of cherry, fig, apricot and toffee up front, followed by spice and lightly zesty citrus. Alcohol presence detected at the end. Nice, delicately complex in the nose.  Mouthfeel--It's pretty important to let this beer warm up. While still chilled, the alcohol presence seems to jump out a bit more, and the finish is stickier. However, as the beer warms, it becomes very pleasantly creamy, working better with the warming alcohol. Pretty full-bodied.  Taste--Toasty sweetness. Cherries, plum, alcohol, lightly bitter chocolately malts, some spice and distant orange zest. Delicately complex balance. Sweetness up front, followed by alcohol and finishes with some spice. Even warmed up, alcohol presence is distinct.  Overall--Kind of surprising alcohol presence, considering the strength of the other flavors. Even when warmed up and creamy, alcohol presence is strong. I was a bit dubious about the presence of cherries here at first, but it is not at all dominant, and adds very nicely to this beer's complexity.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Beerenauslese,4.33,"This one is a 2010 vintage and has aged in my cellar a year. 12 oz. bottle.  Body is a translucent reddish brown. Poured to a half inch head in a Gouden Carolus chalice, the head is at first lumpy with big bubbles, but then settles down to a thin, but creamy foam head, leaving little curtains of lace. Eventually settles to a ring.  Smells of dark malt--sort of old aleish, muted spice, a bit of cola, and dark cherries.  I believe this beer is a little sweeter when fresh. Aged, it has mellowed in sweetness a bit, and has become drier. Both the quad and the kriek profiles are amply evident. First taste is sweet cola and dark fruit, with the swallow, there comes a wave of cherry which lingers into the long dry finish. The roasted malt gives this a dry taste sensation, amplified by cellaring. There is a metallic cola taste in the finish as is often present in quads. As it warms, the fruit flavor intensifies.  Body is medium and the carbonation is sufficient to give this a slightly creamy mouthfeel. There is a bit of prickly sensation on the tongue which also spices up the experience.  Overall, a good beer. Alcohol is well masked by the complexity of flavors. This has benefited a bit from aging. Of course, Ommegang knows that as they have cave aged this beer. Could age this longer before cracking it open.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,DabblinWiscCraft,4.46,"This beer was initially reviewed on 7/15/11 in Bad Genie Lounge in Milwaukee--the bottle is dated 2011.  Pours a foggy, semi-translucent burnt sienna. Held to the light, it's a nice plum color. Begins with a decent 3/4 inch head that falls to a resilient lace that clings well. It has a cherry-forward nose--with additional notes of yeasty wheat and caramel malts--but it seems a fairly muted bouquet, overall. The taste is cherry right out of the gates, hitting the front of the tongue with a reserved yet potent sweetness. From here, the flavor meanders around the palate with a nice toasted malt sweetness and an ever-so-subtle sourness that reveals wonderful balance and craftsmanship. The feel is medium-bodied, creamy, effervescent, slightly syrupy, and very well balanced.  This beer is quite impressive: It has a balance, feel, and flavor that are very engaging and, almost contradictorily, very comfortable. I can't imagine a way they could have brewed this quad differently that would have improved the final taste. I think that's one of the marks of a really great beer, which this certainly is.

Cherry fruitcake might be a good description on this. Slightly syrupy quality in the nose, still quite nice though.  T-- Black cherry. Not candied at all. really sort of thin in a way. lacking the bread quality that it needs.  M-- Get a slight amount of bread in the mouth but this is about cherry and more cherry. Starts as black cherry and changes to red ruby sweet cherry with small bit of sourness. Not that it is infected or anything like that. Finishes as sweet cherry. Has a bit of an alcohol burn to finish but the cherry sweetness does hide it a bit.  O-- to me this is still the bar standard for US Quads.

42,3457,Rschis16,4.1,"Deep burgundy color with dark red hues throughout, poured out of a very cool bottle. Nice light khaki head on top with decent lacing down the glass. Boozy cherries in the nose, caramel notes and vanilla. Mocha notes shine through as well, making this a complex and awesome aromatic beer.  A bourbon-like booze taste is what I get heavily out of the first sip. Dark malts shine through as well, mixed with dried fruits and fresh cherries. Its sweet, but so pleasant that it doesn't even register as sweet at first, just delicious and pleasant. It isn't cloyingly sweet at all, which is why the taste succeeds so well. The booziness isn't overwhelming at any point, even after warming, but is definitely present and accounted for. It slowly warms the body. The carbonation level is moderate to high, and fizzier more than smooth, but still the smoothness doesn't lack. It leaves a slight syrupy deposit in the back of the mouth, which can be distracting at times. Finishes like a dry wine, and leaves an almost wine-like aftertaste especially considering the booziness.  In the 2nd half of the bottle, there is more sediment floating around and an overall fuller taste. The higher carbonation is actually smoothed out really nicely. Still the same beer with the same characteristics, but the booziness is less noticeable and the tastes all seem a little more full-bodied and in your face. Interesting to see the effects of more of that Belgian style yeast in a pour.  Overall, this is a really good beer, and I'm glad to have picked it up. I bet this would only improve and mature if cellared, but its pretty darn good either way.

A little musty. Pretty great.  Big and malty in the mouth as well with quite a lot of alcohol, though it's well played. Sweet and bready with light-but-noticeable cherries, a soft spice blend and extremely earthy hops, which leave a somewhat powdery dryness on the finish (hinting toward cocoa). Definitely improves as it warms with some nice sourness from the cherries emerging.  Decent medium body with a light, prickly carbonation. I would appreciate a fuller body on this one.

Very dark, brown color. There is considerable visible yeast throughout the pour. Some lacing but I expected more.  Very enjoyable aroma, yeast dominated of course, but less so than there regular Abby Dubble, malt and dark bread. When it warms up to at least 55 degrees you do detect just a hint of heat from the ABV. Lasts from the initial pour to the last sip.  Delicious, crisp, very full bodied entry in the mouth, followed by very rich deep malt, distinct Belgium yeast, and that wonderful mouth feel of champagne like carbonation. Just a hint of sweetness, very well balanced. There is not even the slightest hint of this beers 9.8% ABV. The Belgium style when well done is such a pleasure to drink and this brew certainly qualifies. Did I mention that this brew is delicious!  Long, rich, malt dominated finish, some lingering yeast.  This appears to be one of their “Flagship” beers so I was perhaps expecting a little more intensity, not that it is by any means an ordinary brew.

S: Restrained bready yeast aroma with a hint of cherries from the Kriek, but not overwhelming. I pick up some light fruit and banana from the yeast. Some alcohol in the nose following a deep whiff.  T: More light fruit up front, but a darker flavor profile overall. As the beer warms, the dark fruits and cherry become more prominent. A slight alcohol flavor and a warming brings up the rear.  M: Heavy body with moderate carbonation suits the beer well. Not a thick brew, but definitely a sipper.  O: A very nice malty quad and a solid choice for an evening sipper. Alcohol is well hidden.

No lacing remains on the glass.  S: Very spirituous, with abundant dark fruit that shows elements of vinous as well as stone fruit. There is also a soft, almost soapy, earthiness that tries to balance the fruit, which borders on being cloying and artificial.  T: Begins nearly dry, with dark cherry fruit and airy carbonic acid. Malt surges on the palate toward the middle, first with grainy toast but then showing more refined toffee into the finish. Citric acidity toward the finish gives longevity to the prominent fruity flavors. A sharp mineral bite lingers, with the finish showing minimal bitterness. No alcohol is detected.  M: Thin to medium viscosity, acidity is lively on the palate(a little too much so at times), with brisk carbonation.  D/O: This beer is a well-intentioned American-brewed take on the quadrupel style, worth a comparison to the more well-distributed Belgian standards. The involvement of cherries is evident, and does enhance the overall product. Acidity is a factor and could be less assertive, while less carbonation would help to make for a smoother and more velvety texture.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TamTamIam,4.01,"Three Philosophers brewed by Ommegang is a Belgian-style Quadrupel. This beer is brewed with 98% ale and 2% ale with cherries added. It drinks nicely in a chalice. The hazy, bright red, brew swirls into the glass, as the thick caramel head fills it to the rim then dissipates to a small layer of foam. Moderate carbonation rises to the top and releases the fruity aroma with a malty character. Each sip is smooth, and leaves your palate feeling fresh. This beer contains 9.8% alcohol, and you can taste it, but that's a good thing. It adds a nice bite at first, then mellows out gradually. A sweet cherry taste is noted with a good bit of dark Belgian yeast, followed by an unsweetened cocoa finish. Three Philosophers is a slightly different take on the Quad, but is a very well balanced beer. I would highly recommend it if you want something dark, fresh, and easy to drink.

Some stickage to the sides of the glass as it is swirled around.  Smell - Sweet, malty aromas with a hint of raisin and plum. Not the most overpowering smell in the world and not as strong as some other Quadrupels.  Taste - Overall, the taste was pretty underwhelming. The initial taste was a slight bitterness which transitioned into sweet near the end of the sip. With some retro-nasal breathing you could taste the raisins and plums and some maltiness. Maybe a slight caramel flavor too. Fairly complex taste.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied. Not much carbonation and very smooth. Could not feel the affects of the abv. until after I had drunk nearly the whole 750 mL bottle.  Overall - It was good, but not great. I have had better Quadrupels (from Rochefort) and better overall beers (Hopslam). The taste was very similar to the other Quadrupels, but not as strong and not nearly as sweet and pleasing near the end of the sip. I am going to be trying th Ommegang Abbey Ale next; let's hope that one blows me away.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,damndirtyape,4.18,"12oz bottle (2010 year) poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Very slow pour gave a ruby red slightly hazy beer with a very light tan foam across the top. Tiny delicate islands and lacing...although the lacing slides down a bit over time and doesn't stick to the glass that well. The bubbles near the surface keep coming up and building the foam back up as it slowly dissipates. Great looking beer.  Smell: Malt and a hint of phenol with cherry - but the cherry is what you would get with a backed tart or a crumble. Not medicinal, not overpowering, but just right. It's an accent at the end which makes the beer smell oh so very good. With a swirl though the cherry gets mixed up with some other sour smells - not as good then. Better when the foam dissipates a bit.  Taste: Definitely a Belgian quad. Malt is complex - with some caramel and sugary flavors, but there is some sour here, and the cherry is well in that sour flavor. It's that tart/sour cherry that you get when you bite into a fresh cherry that would typically be used for baking. Alcohol very well hidden. The smell and the taste are not connecting for me though...I'm expecting something sweeter based off the smell. Don't get me wrong, I like this, it's just a sensory disconnect.  Mouthfeel: Spicy carbonation on the tongue, but velvety smooth. There is some clinging sensation to the teeth though.  Overall / Drinkability: A slow sipping beer for savoring by itself, although I think it would work well with dessert. Interesting beer and worth trying out. Really impressed with the appearance and smell, but more sour than I expected.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell: Fruity, plums, cherries, a little grape, sweet malts, a little booze, anise  Taste: Fruity, with tart cherries up front, some plums and a little grape, some sweet malt, some anise, and some earthiness.  Mouthfeel: Full body, high carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, dry finish  Overall: Excellent rendition of a classic Belgian style, honestly I think this is better than Rochefort 10.

42,3457,Smakawhat,3.26,"Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Vintage 2011.  Same appearance as it's younger abbey ale sibling. Body color is a great dark ruby and somewhat clear. Snapping noises come from the bubbles of the head. Seems to leave a good puck as well on the top.  Mild cherry, malt muted, very similar to regular abbey ale but seems a little thicker... perhaps bolder. I was hoping for something more pronounced but it's just not happening.  Taste is virtually nearly identical to it's sibling, with maybe a hint of chocolate milk on the finish. I am missing or not getting the fruit background off this at all, or a big malt caramel back bone for a quad. Somewhat milkshake like in body with a little fizz which is a classic touch, but missing the flavor punch I think needed for this style.  Overall I am not really that impressed by this quad, but it's certainly a good passable brew. Not for me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A - Pours a deep, murky ruby-mahogany with a two finger golden tan head. Good retention on the head with very sticky lacing.  S - Roasted malt and dark cherry with a good amount of bready character. Some brown sugar and alcohol in the aroma as well.  T - Sweet and fruity initially and then toasty tasting with a dry, slightly grassy finish. Cherry taste is fresh and tart. Hints of chocolate and caramel become more noticeable as the beer warms. Very rich and sweet with noticeable alcohol.  M - Creamy and moderately carbonated. Slightly slick on the lips.  D - This one should be a sipper, way too flavorful and potent for me to session.

42,3457,BarryMFBurton,4.38,"Three Philosophers: a beer that has intrigued me for quite a while. I love Duvel, and I’m more than happy to be trying anything from their line. Thanks to Bill from Kahn’s on 86th, whose trade for this has been the highlight of my beer journey so far!  A: Pours a thick, gorgeous red. Like Duvel, the head is foamy and white, rising very quickly to make a big first impression. Although it fades after only a few minutes, it’s huge out of the gate – you definitely can’t be too aggressive with your pour. I also can make out a few bits of yeast leftovers in the bottom of the bottle, and the bottom of my tulip. These guys definitely know the unfiltered glory that makes a Belgian a Belgian.  S: Hmmm; a modest dryness in the nose presents a merlot sort of feel. In fact, given a blind smell test, I’m sure most people would identify this as wine instead of beer. The cherries are subtle, but hard to miss, providing a sweet ambience to a rather heavy alcoholic presence.  T: This is one hell of a sweet quad. Like Duvel, the malts are a ripe, tangy testament to Belgian quality. The yeast tries to overtake the palate after the malts have their moment, and it does give a slight estery pronouncement. However, it is soon pushed out of the way in favor of a Kriek cherry kick. And the best part is, it’s real – the cherry is genuine flavor, not the overly-sweet cherry tastes that you find in candies and pie fillings. Now, it’s not quite the flavor of the freshest fruit, but it’s definitely enjoyable.  M: Goes down unbelievably smooth, and even has a distinct warming on the first few sips. It’s probably due to the softness of the carbonation, but I don’t feel like I’m drinking a quad at all. It’s good, but it suffers from the tragedy of easy-drinking beers: causing me to drink it faster than I expected! Damn, where did the rest of that bottle go?  O: To me, this is every bit the little brother of Rochefort 10. It’s great, but not quite as thick, not quite as warming, not quite as flavorful. It’s more of an everyday beer, and I’m more than ok with that. If I ever, and I mean EVER find this on-tap, you can be sure that I’ll be at least two or three glasses deep by the end of the night. This stuff is great.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jifigz,3.68,"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  A: A dark rich mahogany red/brown with a small cream/white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Some yeast sediment that seems suspended.  S: This brew has a thick cough syrup like cherry smell. The ethanol is noticeable in the aroma as well.  T: The cherry cough syrup and ethanol that are in the nose are most certainly evident in the taste as well. The aftertaste is alcohol and sweetness blended together.  M: This is a pretty heavy feeling beer in your mouth. The carbonation feels very minimal and the beer feels thick and viscous.  O: I don't overly enjoy this beer. The reminders I get of a cough medicine totally taint the quality of this beer for me. I believe it is a well crafted beer and very respectable, but I just don't go crazy over the taste.

Nice thick off-brown head. Darn good looking. Filmy streaks though  Aroma is cherry and banana. Some baked caramel and dark chocolate. Some earthen spices and rich orchard fruits.  The cherry is there in the taste, but leaves the tannin quality behind. Thus we get the 'meat' of the cherry, dark and just a hint tart. The banana fades and the earthy spices come in, some nutmeg and soaked raisin. Dark plum subtleties on the end. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, but does come in on the end.

Awesome name, awesome bottle, awesome beer. It's definitely more on the ""quad"" side than on the ""kriek"" side, as the cherry taste is more implied than infused, as opposed to other stronger/actual krieks.  Pours a hazy burgundy with a fine, small layer of white bubbles for a head. Complex aroma of yeast, spice, and fruit. Roasty malts in the taste, with flavors of cherry, plum, brown sugar, cloves, and rum. A little boozy, but not harsh. Medium mouthfeel, can be a bit syrupy. Can be enjoyed cold or closer to room temperature. Highly complex, highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Almost reminiscent of Mad Elf, but in this one, the cherries are a little more subdued.  Tastes great. Tastes like a typical dubbel I think. But it has those cherries in the background that adds that layer that makes this good. The cherries give a nice subtle tart surprise. Alcohol is warming, but really is hidden well for 9.8%.

Carbonation isn't very visible.  Smell - Dark cherries, brown sugar, and a bit of chocolate come through. The nose is a bit medicinal though ... a bit off from what I'm expecting.  Taste - Really thick tasting and the cherry flavor comes across pretty strong throughout each sip. It starts out really deep with strong malt and fruit flavors, then towards the end it really opens up and the alcohol reveals itself. Although the alcohol does show up, this beer does a really good job of hiding the fact that it's nearly 10%. It also leaves a bit of a tart/dry taste after each sip which I find to be really nice.

42,3457,maximum12,4.17,"This is a bottle with a history. It's the very first bottle I picked up off of a store shelf with the specific intention of aging; so it's a bit of a historic bottle around here. Vintage 2007, popped open on a sultry May evening with heat, humidity, & wild storms all around. I slept through our four hours of Minnesota spring, I guess. Sticker says 7.49. Ha! Bet it's gone up significantly since '07.  Pours coppery red, carefully, carefully, to not let out the quad-mud at the bottom of the barrel. Smell pours forth from the open neck of the bottle; cherries, sweet sugar gum. Little licorice & tart, too.  Three Philosophers is good fresh, but this aged bottle has notched it up a level. The cherry is succulent, ripe, with an razor-edge of tartness that's much needed. Rock-candy sweetness anchors the cherry. Garden of Eden mix of fruits, both light & dark, with a nod towards the bananas. Bank-shot of yeast, & I believe it's the yeast that lends a flick of allspice. Mouthfeel is where this is at, very light & approachable for a quad. I'm draining my half of the bomber rather quickly; maybe drink a bit more water when it's 90 & I'm sweating out at third base. Nah.  Well, this beer could definitely go longer. I'm only sad I don't have a fresh one to bust open & compare, but that's not a very good idea on a school night.

S: german chocolate cake, raisins, chocolate covered cherries, maple syrup and vanilla. some bourbon-like booze aromas in the background. finishes out almost like it has been aged in oak whiskey barrels.  T: just as rich as the nose. raisins and vanilla up front, then more chocolate covered cherries that follows into the woodsy, sweet, and boozy finish.  M: medium full and velvety smooth. becomes bitter and increasingly dry when the wood flavors hit in the finish. adds another dimension to the entire profile of the beer.  Overall, a big, hearty beer only intended for the wise. I tend to stray from most fruit, spiced, or lambic beers so i haven't tried this one due to the fact that cherry ale is added. If you have been doing the same, you owe it to yourself to try this one. I plan to compare this one to the 2010 and 2011 i have.  2010  Poured into chalice...  A: poured slowly, it shows a big fluffy tan head atop a murky mahogany body. head settles really slow leaving lace.  S: rich aromas of sweet caramel and belgian candy sugar, roasted nuts, and a cherry cola aroma. only a light tingle on the nose hairs from the high alcohol  T: again, very rich, sweet brown sugar flavors up front, with a bittering woodsy character melding together with a hint of liquor soaked black cherries, finishing out sweet with flavors of dark fruit.  M: lush and full bodied upfront, countered by a soda pop-like fizziness, then finishing slick, warm, and off dry, and adding to the complexity of the flavor profile.  Overall, this version seems to be more boozy than the 2009. I say ""seems to be"" because I did not check the notes from my 2009 before I reviewed this 2010, and I did the 09 review several weeks ago.

Medium carbonation with some sediment floating about.  Decent hit of cherries (or some light syrupy sweet stone fruit) for only a 2% blend. Sweet slight cloying malt and a touch of alcohol. Being the 2010 version maybe this hasn't had enough time to really meld together. Just seems a bit rough around the edges and uncoordinated.  Taste is a bit better put together once it warms. Slight cherry adds some lightness and complexity. Pretty intense overall with lots of dark malt character without being roast or chocolate. More towards the dark fruit character which may be a fermentation influence. Still quite young though as the flavors are more independent than working together as a unit.  Mouthfeel has some room for improvement with the carbonation and yeast adding some harshness which should mellow with age.  Quite nice but yet to reach its peak.

O - Not bad, but I feel like they were going for more than they should've been. A nice beer to try, but being a HUGE fan of quads, I was a bit let down by what this could've been.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,quine,4.2,"A: Poured a deep brown with reddish hues with a decent tan head. Retention was okay, and it left a nice lacing as well.  S: Great smell. Sweet dark fruits and malts, and a little tinge of alcohol.  T: Taste is much like the smell at first. Dark fruits (like plums and raisins) dominate, with an unexpected tartness. The taste of alcohol comes afterwards but somehow mixes well with the other flavors.  M: Thick, smooth and nicely carbonated.  D: The flavors were nicely balanced. The sweetness combined well with the slight tartness, and it's dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Great brew overall.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TheSupremeAJ,4.35,"12oz capped bottle, 2011, poured into chalice. Served cellar temperature (55F)  Beautiful dark ruby brown hue. Huge fluffy white head fills my St Bernardus chalice and fades to a healthy layer.  Aroma is sweet, tart, and complex. It is inviting me for a sip!  Taste is kind of musty and a lot more cherry than I expected considering. Hints of cholocate and fruit cake. Hops shine lightly.  Mouth feel is magnificent. High carbonation and a lively feel. Lingers gently with a pleasant aftertaste.  Overall this is the best American Quad I've had yet far.... although I wish it was available sans cherry juice, or with less cherry per my preferences.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,chicagoabbot,4.07,"12 oz into my snifter...brown body that is quite clear underneath a surging cap...the head just keeps rising. Good carbonation for such a huge beer. I catch a whiff of alcohol in the nose, along with big malts and cherries, but it still hides the booze decently. It scores points on uniqueness and I like that there are a few different things going on here.  It's big on the tongue, but the alcohol is still pretty well hidden. It's a little sweet for my taste, and not really bitter at all, but there is some desirable sourness from the cherries...not as much as I would like though, I think the blend could be a little heavier on the kriek side of life. Scores points on uniqueness alone though.  Good mouthfeel, smooth. Big beer that goes down easy. Points.  Definitely worth a try or two. It's its own beer, which is huge. Nice sipper.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Ralphus,4.35,"My first Ommegang brew (that I can remember).  A: It pours a dark and murky brown color. The large bubbled head receded to a ring of foam leaving some lacing down the side of the glass.  S: The smell is slightly muted but dark fruits, raisins and cherries are present. Fairly average really.  T: Much bigger and more enjoyable. Chocolate, dark fruit, cherries and spice all come through. It lively and demands your attention but at the same time it's balance is sublime. Really well done.  M: Mouthfeel is good. The carbonation is crisp but not dominating and the beer drinks goes down really well.  O: A really solid quad - especially if you like cherries!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BuckyFresh,4.29,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Color is a cloudy reddish brown, with a fairly minimal head given the hard pour. Retention and lacing are decent, but not great. A bit of carbonation is visible, but it's mostly obscured by the presence of lots of yeasty chunks in the glass.  Smell: Lots of fig, raisin, brown sugar, molasses, plumb, licorice, funky yeast, mineral water, and a touch of tartness. Some alcohol character is present, and a substantial malt punch gives this one a pretty sweet aroma.  Taste: Very creamy and smooth. Nice dark fruit presence and just the right amount of sweetness are balanced by the influence from the Kriek. I honestly thought there would be a bit more sourness with the blend and all, but this really just tasted like a well-balanced, delicious quad.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy and delicious. Nice malt body, and touch of dryness from the Kriek, and a slight warming from the alcohol at the end.  Overall: This beer actually exceeded my expectations going in. I wasn't sure whether or not the Kriek addition would be to my liking, but it seems as though the blend was quite judicious and the unique quad character was preserved. I will definitely go back to this one again in the future!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,jhtipton,4.5,"Thanks to Mr. Klain for the export of this from USA to Spain. I've been trying my share of quadrupels from Belgian while over here and it's nice to see that we have some superior Belgian style to look forward to when I return home in 2013. Pours a dark brownish red into my Affligem chalice. Mild head, certainly nothing too crazy and some mild lacing. Didn't check the glass for wetness so maybe I detracted from the head others write about or maybe the cork got beat up on its journey?! Smell is what I like about belgian quads - brown sugar figs apricot and plums I suppose. The alcohol is prevalent in both smell and taste. Tastes great- some of the belgian yeast, alcohol is prevalent, dark fruits, and a tad sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and warming (alcohol). Overall, I would try again and recommend to friends. Recommended for promotion and retention.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Head is dense light brown foam, with moderate clinging lace. Color is a 27 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is crisp, and has aromas of chocolate, honey, fudge, roasted coffee, apricot, and pepper. Taste is intense, with flavors of caramel, molasses, green tea, licorice, pepper, and chives. The flavor is remarkable and wonderful blend of melon, green tea, clover, watermelon rind, licorice, coco, rye, and overcooked lamb. Mouthfeel is a great experience of creamy and prickly flow over tongue and soft palate.

Plenty of thick creamy head. Lots of sticky lace.  S - Banana bread, sweet dark fruits, multiple layers of dark malt, a hint of wood. The aroma is very good, but not exceptional.  T/M - Very smooth with a heavy body, but not as heavy as I expected from such a big dark beer. The sensation of the high carbonation hits the senses before you're able to taste anything, but once the flavor comes through the tastebuds are hit with big mix of dark malty sweetness. Toward the middle the taste is somewhat medicinal, with the sweet and tart cherries making their appearance but not stealing the show, and an earthy/herbal hop bitterness helping to round out the finish. The high carbonation goes well with the tart cherry flavor in the middle. The the tingly, tart, sweetness stays with you in the aftertaste, but it's hidden behind the earthy and herbal hops.  D - I keep finding new flavors with every sip, and the beer takes on a completely new character as it warms.

Settles fairly slowly leaving a blanket of foam on the surface. Some nice spiderweb lacing remains.  S: Baked bread, wood, and cherry.  T: Pungent malty flavor. Yeast is prominent. Woody and lightly sweet cherry. Nothing overpowering though. Well balanced.  M: Light body, despite high alcohol profile. Pungent and sweet, with a dry finish. Soft and subtle.  D: Mmmm... Sip and enjoy.  Great atmosphere. Nice appearance including a decent head and some fair lacing. Nose is not strong, but a really well-done combination of grain, wood, and cherry.

Deep rich figs, rasins with a very thick bready yeast to take the final scent into the nose.  T- WOW, Rich fruits, figs, apricots, dates, sweet sugary kindness, thick belgian yeast touch, and cherries of course, dominate, and in charge. Phenomenal.

S: Lots of dark fruit esters (prune, plum, raisin), brown sugar, and a nice suprising tart cherry.  T: A lot like the nose, but more intense and complex. Very fruity, mainly dark fruits and wonderfully tart cherry. The alcohol has a strong presence, especially upfront.  M: Very effervescent, medium body.

T- A little bit of tartness from the cherries. Very sweet, the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Very fruity.

The head is off white and a little frothy. The aroma is a little bready and also the cherries come through. The flavor is complex: cherry, biscuit, apricot, raisin and ripe fruit in the backend, a hint of of toffee? The finish is bold and lingers for a bit, and maybe there was just a hint of strawberry?

The aroma was nice and enticing with a moderate dose of sweet malts, a smidgen of resin hops and a nice sweet yeast with notes of caramel and dried fruit and a mild alcohol tinge.  It tasted quite sweet and a little acidic with a note of caramel and maybe a little brown sugar at first and finished with a nice sweet-bitter flavor and had hints of dried fruit and a slight alcohol flavor at the end with the flavor staying with you for a nice enjoyable duration.

Sticky toffee sweetness up front with biscuit, gently spicy hops, dark fruit, and a sweet cherry finish that escalates to a mild tartness.

Taste- A smaller feeling quad but was still very tasty. A sweet raisiny taste with some nice malts. Well balanced and the almost 10% is well hidden.  Mouth- As I mentioned, a smaller feeling quad that was medium bodied with a matching medium carb level. The fruit retains on the tounge for quite a bit.  Drink- I enjoyed this alot.

Taste - The taste provided a very strong booze presence with a noticable burn at the back. Again, I'm gathering the dark fruit flavors. Cherry and prune. Mostly tart. Even getting some toasted malt. This is very reminiscent of red wine.  Mouthfeel - Medium/full mouthfeel. Really covers the palate. A significant amount of alcohol warmth. Sort of rough around the edges going down. Leaves a tremendous amount of flavor on the palate.  Drinkability - I'm sure that this brew has a tremendous following. A bit much on the alcohol flavoring for me however.

I'm going to guess plum but I can't really tell except for that it's mixed with cherry.  Taste: Cherries! Dark cherry flavor definitely dominates the taste, which gives it tart and sour taste. After letting the beer warm a little bit, I've noticed that the beer also has some sweetness either sugar or another fruit. I'm going to guess probably another fruit, which may be the plum I smelled.

One finger light brown head that was frothy with insanely tight bubbles; the head slowly dissipated to about a half finger and then stuck around for at least 5+ minutes. Left a good amount of lacing. Very impressive.  S: Lots of dark fruit esters (prune, plum, raisin), brown sugar, and a slightly cherry tart/funk.  T: A lot like the nose, but more intense and complex. Starts off with a ton of dark fruit and moves into brown sugar, fruitcake like malt, and slight belgian funk in the middle. The finish is where the cherries take over, lots of tart cherries, red wine characteristics, dry and sweet. The aftertaste is strikingly long, mostly with the sweet tart cherries/dark fruits. The alcohol has a strong presence, especially upfront with some hot phenols. There's a bit of a licorice quality between the sweetness and dark fruit esters that my buddy noted. Complex, fairly intense, and I loved how the flavor profile changed throughout the taste to the tart cherry finish.  M: Very effervescent , medium body. It's a little light and heavily carbonated for the style. Dry and sweet. Seemed more to fit a Triple or sour than a Quad, though it was still quite pleasant and made it a bit easier to drink.  D: The alcohol doesn't hide itself, but the light body and heavy carbonation make it very easy to drink, not to mention how delicious it is. It's a sipper, but one that can go quickly if you're not paying attention.  While this isn't my favorite quad, it is a fairly unique and delicious.

The taste, extraordinarily robust. There's that cherry you can pick out from all the malty alcohol. The flavor borders on overbearing, but becomes much more acceptable as it warms up, I'd say that slightly chilled is the ideal temperature to serve this at. The body is thick but not chewy.

T: Plums, Figs, and black currents are really complemented by the cherry qualities. Cherry character is nice and not tart (does a way better job then the BBQ-FAIL by Boulevard). Slightly sweet.  M: Really nice carbonation with a medium mouth feel. Alcohol good and not over powering. There but not a problem.  D: Excellent with this beer!!

Poured into my Ommegang glass, the beer has a beautiful dark brown color and a two finger head that gradually fades away. Plums, figs, cherries, and alcohol are present in the aroma. Taste is comprised of the dark fruit from the smell, with some raisin. The cherries make a subtle appearance, and they complement the taste very well. Mouthfeel is light bodied, and probably the weak point of this beer. Drinkability is dangerously high as the ABV is nearly hidden.

42,3457,Schnapsidee,4.35,"Poured into my Karmeliet Tripel glass, with a 2 finger off white head of fine bubbles that resides fairly quickly after a minute or two. When held to the light it is deeply red and lacing is minimal. Cherries and currants are apparent in the nose with the aroma of yeast on the back end. First sip begins tart but drops to a sweetness. Overall the taste finishes dry with some heat on the back end probably due to the 9.5% alcohol. Yeast makes the texture that much better and the tart dryness blends well with the malt. For being a quad this beer is dangerously drinkable and doesn't come off too fruity despite being blended with cherries. Great beer overall.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Head is pillowy and inviting, staying around and leaving average lacing. A good amount of carbonation is coming up the sides of the Chimay chalice, moving sediment around that I just barely see.  S - Very subtle, like many Quads I've had. Aromas are often deceptive I've found with this style, but their subtlety for what they are and what they become with more investigation is lovely. I get some caramelized or sugary dark fruits, rich malty aromas, breadiness, a little bit of booze, and a molasses character.  T - More boozy fruits, like fruitcake with alcohol. Dark fruits are great with a little tiny bit of chery. There's some yeast and rich maltiness too. It takes some effort to pull out everything that's there but it's worth the investigation. Quality Quads take time.  M - Coats the mouth great, good amount of carbonation, full bodied.  D - Really tasty stuff.

42,3457,DoubleSimcoe,3.96,"Ommegang Three Philosophers, 750-ml bottle, poured into a large snifter/oversize wine glass/Viking cup.  Appearance: A beautiful pour that produces a luxurious tan head indeed; three fingers rapidly receding into one, with considerable retention, great carbonation and no lacing at all. Color is ruby dark, like raisin puree or some very old liquor that was just unearthed from a centuries-old cellar.  Smell: Yeast, fruit, dark juices. Sweetness, sugar. Must, old wine. Some bitterness and booze as it warms up. Very timid, though, compared to the amazing taste.  Taste: Follows nose, only intensified, with more of those dark fruits, sour cherries and some burnt/liquefied sugar. Tart and dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thin for such a huge quadrupel. Maybe the lambic part of the beer? Nice tingly carbonation and chewy finish, but really, I would expect a bomb.  Drinkability: Very nice. A sipper, yes, but a delectable one. I'm not a huge fan of Belgians but love this one.  I also recently had an aged Philosophers from 2008 on tap at Blind Tiger. Very smooth, creamy, subdued.

A creamy tan head faded fast but left some nice lacing and a frothy cap that lasted throughout.  Smell: Bready, yeasty and fruity with deep plum and dark cherry accents. Very nice.  Taste: Much like it smells, dark malts and Belgian yeast gives way to an underlying sweetness with the dark cherry flavors lingering on the tongue. A very deep and warming brew with a little alcohol heat on the first couple sips, but no overpowering alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied. Smooth, creamy with that nice cherry aftertaste.  Drinkability: Some may not like the cherry flavor, but I think it's what gives this excellent Quad it's edge. Very tasty and easy to down a 750 ml bottle in one sitting. Although at 10% ABV, I'd probably stop my session after one big bottle.

Aromas are pleasing albeit a tad subdued (4)  T - Brown sugar sweetness upfront lifting to reveal dark fruity notes with suggestions of plums and raisins blended with phenols in the middle; flavors of cherries were detected towards the finish where a tart and dark fruity after taste ensues (4.5)  M - Between thin and medium bodied thickness with an apt amount of carbonation; goes down smooth, dry and with a pleasant warming. However it's probably a tad thin for a Quadrupel (3.5)  D - Very delectable fruity flavors with interesting lambic qualities in a Quadrupel; however the mouthfeel was a little too thin in my opinion. Nonetheless, this brew is very easy drinking with the alcohol hardly showing through (4)  I had pretty high expectations on this Quadrupel as it is from the Ommegang brewery which I have heard and read so much about and this Quadrupel, a bottle from 2009, happens to be my first beer from Ommegang.

Like a glass of coke with ice after the ice melts. Very obvious carbonation in glass. Nice to look at.  Smell - Somewhat masked. A nice richness, but I did not let it develop well or take notes.  Taste - This is the first that I have had of the style. I like it a lot, but have a hard time finding something to compare it to. The flavor was complex and I look forward to sipping more to develop a better feel for it. Despite its lighter brown color, I found it to be complicated (a bias I should learn to get over).  Mouthfeel - This hit the spot. I liked the thickness and abundant carbonation. Left a clean feeling in my mouth.  Drinkability - Not a summertime slamming beer, but perfect for a meal with strong flavors or a night of relaxing with brews and heady conversation.  *** Edit on 2/18/11 (original 2/2/11): Had a couple more of these and I am even more impressed than originally. I am bumping my smell and taste reviews from 4.0 to 4.5 and my drinkability to 5.0. This is definitely going to be one of my favorites. I was actually saddened when I got the bottom of my last glass.

S: Very interesting-- there's the presence of dark fruit and Belgian yeast that is sort of shrouded with tart/sweet cherry that is slightly medicinal and boozy, but altogether very complex and unique. T: Not as fruity as the nose suggests, but rather a mix of roasted malt and dark fruit and first, and then some fruitiness leading to a dry/tart finish. The cherry flavours still come across as a bit cough-syrup like, but still rather enjoyable. Alcohol apparent, but not over-the-top. M: Slightly tart aftertaste that may be due to the lambic component. Medium-bodied and nice prickly carbonation. D: While I loved the layers of complexity that the cherry added, I think that this beer would improve dramatically with a bit of age on it.

42,3457,CuriousMonk,4.32,"Poured from 750ml bottle into heavy chalice glass. Pours a deep brown with garnet tints and a super tight beige head. Aroma is loaded with fruity esters that fill the room before the first sniffs even transpire. Plum, prune, dates, raisin, caramel, toasty sweet malt, molasses, brown sugar and light fruity notes that seem to proliferate with the accompanying of some mild alcoholic warming notes. Fruity esters that showed up in the aroma make a similar impression in terms of the light fruit flavor profile. Dark fruits, however, take the day with nearly every facet making its respective way in the swirling dark sugar torrent that is so prevalent. Dark syrup like sugars are complemented nicely by a wholly evident alcohol note that warms the nasals but doesn't detract from the experience. Palate is effervescent with lots of bubbly prickling amongst a high viscosity torrent. Mouthfeel is thick and quite rich- even chewy with warming booze and an ever so slight roasty dryness. This is only very subtle, though, for the overall theme of the finish strays away from attenuation and presents itself with a sticky smacking fullness. I was pleasantly surprised by this American example of a style that American brewers rarely edge out the Belgians in...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,RossCain,4.03,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet  A: Pours a slightly dark, opaque amber/garnet hue with about 1"" of a frothy, cappuccino colored head. The head features tight lacing with tiny foamy bubbles abound which cling to the side of the glass. The head settles into about a quarter inch cap after a while which simply persist for the entire duration of the beer. Attractive presentation overall.  S: The beer has a strong throw which even from arms length you can pick up right away on the phenolic smell of bananas with a certain mild clove spice tossed in the mix. Closer in, there is a (very) subtle undertone of tart cherries and thick, bready malts with a kiss of sweetness in the finish of the aroma. A tad too phenolic upfront, though, in my opinion which was actually reminiscent of Jack Daniels in the aroma.  T: A complex brew with dominant spicy and phenolic notes upfront which delicately blend into a thick concoction of flavors in the middle. Dashes of tart fruity notes from the cherry, sweet doughy notes from the malts, and touches of thick molasses and brown sugar topped upon toasted bread as the beer moves into the finish. Well blended flavor profile which really coats the palate upon the finish imparting a semi-sweet and slightly smokey aftertaste.  M: Thick, full bodied and chewy. Well done carbonation with a pleasing mouth feel with a good blend of warming alcohol in the back of the throat. The aftertaste could have been slightly better with a certain smokiness drying out the back of the throat for 5 to 10 seconds after sipping.  D: As mentioned, Three Philosophers is a complex, sippable brew that in my opinion was a good value for the money and fine example of a Belgian style quad. However, this one lacked just a tad in the drinkability due to the aftertaste; I'm glad I shared this bottle as it is unlikely I could have finished the full 750ml without going to another drink in between.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,TheQuietMan22,4,"Appearance: Straight pour into a tulip glass. The color is a hazy, dark, ruby/caramel color. Two fingers of slightly tanned head developed and dissipated slowly to leave a thin skim and ring around the edge. There is a little sedimentation at the bottom of the bottle.  Smell: Noticeable at first is the Belgian yeast, which is most prominent. Underneath are aromas of slightly roasted caramel, a little chocolate, and tart cherry, which is unfortunately reminiscent of cough syrup. There is also a little herbal spice (maybe clove?) and raspberry, too, but it is very faint and may have just been a part of my imagination. It is also a little on the boozy side; the alcohol definitely makes the nose hairs stand at attention.  Taste: Massive Belgian yeast character that shares the lead role with the cherry tartness, though it thankfully does not taste like cherry cough syrup because it is missing the cherry flavor; it is just a dark fruit tartness. I would much rather have a general tartness than full blown cough syrup, though. There is, however, a little bit of plum and clove spiciness. Flavors of chocolate and slightly roasted caramel are also present. Each sip leaves a hint of bitterness lingering on the cheeks, and the alcohol is very well hidden.

42,3457,rdub,4,Poured from the corked 22 into my Ommegang glass. It came with the gift pack. Medium black with some brown foam and nice lacing. Smell was malty and roasty with the slightest hint of cherry. Taste was also malty and roasty. Mouthfeel was bit thick and drinkability was good. The alcohol snuck up on me.

42,3457,lordredsnake,4,"A: Served in a Chimay goblet at the Terrace Taproom. Cloudy deep reddish amber color, without much head. Leaves a fair amount of lacing.  S: Malty, yeasty, slightly fruity.  T: Definitely malty, I could not taste any cherry as hard as I tried, but it did have more of a sweet caramel flavor than the bottle I had before.  M: Carbonated but still smooth and creamy.  D: I tried this on tap a few days after being quite disappointed by a bottle serving. I usually prefer the taste of bottle-conditioned beers being served from the bottle, but this seemed quite a bit more appealing to me on tap. I'll give the bottle a re-review some day. The draft serving lacked the carbonation and alcohol burn that turned me off from the bottled serving and seemed maltier which I enjoyed. It seemed also to have lost the slight cherry taste it had from the bottle, but this could be due to the bar serving it too cold. I tried to let it warm up but had a hard time resisting. All in all an enjoyable quad but unlikely to be a regular choice for me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Hints of cherry tartness run through it. Medium body feel with alcohol warming and a dry tart finish. Personally, not my style. It is a very strong tasting beer that works well as an apertif for after dinner. I could see this being a decent dessert beer.

42,3457,airheadmtrcycle,4,"Poured from a bottle into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. Three fingers of tan foam kept me from adding the whole 12 oz. to prevent overflow. The beer is an opaque brown with red and orange hues. The head settled immediately to a film and left lacing.  Smells of dark fruit, sour cherries and booze. The first taste lets you know you're in for a boozy ride, yet it's quite smooth. There are loads and loads of sweet malts that balance the alcohol or perhaps it's the other way around. It warms the belly all the way down. Sour cherries are trying to hide, but as the ale warms they are revealed. As far as I remember this is my first quad, and frankly my palate is having a little trouble relishing the super sweet malts and high alcohol. It's not off putting by any means, just something strong and different.  The mouth feel is rich and kinda thick yet carbonated, a really nice balance. I have another but I couldn't drink it right away. I think I'll age it for a year or so.  02/26/11 After drinking my second Three Philosophers I had to come back and increase my ratings. The balance of sweet malts, spice and alcohol is really impressive and delicious. I'll get this again very soon. I will also reach out and experiment with other quads.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,CHickman,4.11,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass, it was cloudy red brown in color with a 2-3 finger massive tan head that was thick and foamy, and had tons of bubbles in it (the head) and faded very slowly; fast bubble carbonation raced up the beer and left very good lacing clinging to the glass. A very attractive beer to look at overall with a lot of sediment swirling around in it.  Smells of sweet malt, pepper, spices, caramel, syrup, coriander, yeast, cinnamon, herbs, mint and then some alcohol and slight funky-ness; a very nice overall aroma that has a mix of sweetness, spices and funky-ness.  Tastes of sweet malt, pepper, spices, herbs, caramel, yeast, cinnamon, floral hops, orange peel, coriander, flowers, hay, grass, light grapefruit, metallic funk, light brown sugar, grains, biscuit, moldy wet bread, dark fruits, a smoky barrel age essence and light alcohol; the cherry flavor was very light and less than advertised, but still a nice addition. It was complex and a little too malty for my current palate, but the yeast and hop spices gave it some balance and hid the alcohol well enough to make this enjoyable. There is alcohol heat throughout this brew, so don't let the flavor fool you into thinking this won't mess you up.  Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and slick, with a medium body, light to almost no carbonation and an overall dense malty feel to it that lets you know it packs a kick.  Decent drinkability, it's not a session beer but it was very tasty. Dry bitter finish that was almost sour and left a pucker.

42,3457,Mancer,2.83,"This beer poured a dark hazy brown with a one finger high off-white head. The head dissipated quickly to a small ring of lace. The immediate smell of the beer was belgian yeast and some dark cherries. The initial taste of the beer was that of yeast, dark cherries, and some other slightly masked dark fruits. This taste is really hard to describe as I thought it initially tasted like bacteria infected beer. The brew had a full body with medium carbonation.  Overall, I was expecting way better. People seem to overly hype this beer for some reason, not just from reviews but from other people I know.

42,3457,afksports,3.25,"I was so excited to open this beer, because it's the first craft beer given to me by my mother. I knew my previous Ommegang feelings had been mixed, but sentimentality goes a long way, people!  The appearance is a standard dark belgian style with deep reddish amber hues, solid lacing, and without too much head on the initial pour. Doesn't hang on the glass too much, which for the abv is a small surprise. It smells of deep cherry, lots of sweet malts, and whatever hops are in there are mostly covered. As far as taste goes, that description follows. Although it says on the bottle that it's 98% ale and 2% cherries, you really taste the cherry. Almost too much. This one reminds me of Brooklyn Local 2. Similar style, similar appearance, similar taste. But Local 2 had somewhat of a better composition. Something in this just doesn't work. Plus it's boozy.  I capped this one to save the nice carbonation and in the hopes that I would drink it later to get the value of the bottle. But I haven't returned to it. It's just not that appealing. Sorry, Mom.

There is maybe a bit too much black cherry for my liking and the flavor is not as full as I like in this style.  M-Medium bodied, nicely carbonated.  D-A pleasant drinking quad.

A little sour,a little malt,a little cherry,a little alcohol- I love it  Very refreshing for such a flavorful strong beer. Not as thick a many others.

Hints of wild yeast, probably brett leaves a touch of acidity in the nose  T - More bready malt but the hint of sweetness in the nose comes thru much more in the taste primarily in the back with a sweet finish. Much more of the spicy yeast and more of the funk than I was anticipating. Not terribly complex but more odd in that the malt back is there and what seems to be a great base beer but the blend makes this more like 2 beers mixed 50-50 in a pitcher.  M - Higly carbed but very full bodied. The sweetness sticks much more than I anticipated.  D - At 9.8% a very drinkable beer. A bit sweet for me, less complex than other quads I've had.

Kind of like sour cherry candy, only less pucker factor. After the first few gulps, the sourness mellowed out quite a bit and left behind a rich, malty cherry taste that was reminiscent of cherry coke.

Very decent quad flavour - sweet, bready grains, prominent spicy yeast. Hints of sour cherry and chocolate malt. Warming alcohol. Cherries not as prominent as I thought they'd be. The dregs of the bottle really add a whole new level to the brew and elevate it. Fairly full, sticky mouthfeel, with a great billowy carbonation.  Another spot-on Ommegang beer.

42,3457,axeman9182,4.16,"750mL bottle of 2010 Three Philosophers, poured into my Duvel tulip.  The beer pours a rich blend of mahogany and maroon, with some ruby spots shining through upon direct lighting. The off white head is monstrous, filling top half of the glass. Retention is great, and so is lacing, even for a style where I expect a bit of each. I took 3 Philosophers out of the fridge and served immediately, and cold the kriek comes through very strongly, cherry and earthy notes. It takes a long time to open up and let the caramel, plum, and fig notes really shine through as well. The taste rounded into shape much sooner, and Ommegang really did nail the blend of quad and kriek. Sour cherry is a slight, but very welcome addition to the standard quad flavors. The only thing holding it back is some alcohol on the close that passes from a pleasant warming to a bit of harsh heat. The mouthfeel is superb, a rich and full body that stops short of stout like viscosity. The carbonation seems muted at first, but by the time it hits the back of my tongue it's exploded, refreshing my palate and highlighting some of the otherwise more background notes (specifically some of the spicy yeast phenols). The aforementioned slight booziness hurts the drinkability some, but other than that it's a great beer, and the cherry kriek blend helps distinguish it from most of the rest of the quads.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

This is a truly well-balanced beer. The alcohol is there (and it packs a punch), but the drink managed to stay smooth and not too sweet. The cherry lambic does add a bit to the sweetness, but when later revisited discovered the tartness it brings to the table. This beer will warm you up.

Smells strongly of Belgian abbey yeast, with a strong sweetness and slight cherry notes woven in between. The beer is incredibly full-bodied (as it damn well should be) and packs a punch. A formidable malt/yeast combo combines with the alcohol to give the brew a strong yet creamy feel, while the addition of kriek gives it a lasting sweetness all the way through and one doesn't have to try hard to taste the cherries. It finishes with a faintly tart, tangy bite on the sides of tongue.  As a New Yorker by birth and a Belgian in spirit, Ommegang has long been at the top of my list of must-try American breweries, and needless to say this beer did not disappoint. All this beer needed was a French/Dutch label and I would have been convinced it was an import.

Booze is present, but not dominant.  Well carbonated, full bodied, modest warming, balanced finish. pleasant, luxurious texture.  Can't believe I haven't tried (or don't remember having tried) this one before. Wow. Super complex, unique, smooth and balanced.

42,3457,StarshipPoopers,4.25,"A - Murky and deep reddish/brown in colour. A fair amount of carbonation is present. Creates a thin but full creamy tan-coloured head with great retention. The lacing is nothing special but certainly exists in small amounts.  S - When you let it sit still it smells like a typical quad with some slight fruitiness. You can certainly smell the spices and yeast with a very gentle touch of an alcoholic freshness and subtle yet sweet fruits. Upon agitating the beer by swirling, the smell becomes engulfed by absolutely great smelling cherries that come straight to the forefront and smell very fresh.  T - The taste has a sort of depth to it that is a welcome change from many beers. Sitting on the tongue you get the spices and yeast with a tinge of rich, dark fruits upfront. The beer is simply fantastic when you swish it around your mouth though, the cherries jump through from the background and blend with the quad perfectly. I'm not tasting any of the alcohol that others mentioned at a slightly cool temperature. Fantastic taste, nice complexity despite the seemingly simple number of notable flavours.  M/D - Quite light bodied and pleasant on the tongue. The drinkability suffers slightly because of the carbonation. A few sips in and I am already feeling the carbonation building up within. Still, it's a great tasting beer that is definitely worth trying. I will be picking up some more of this on my next run to the US.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Splendid looking brew.  Initial smell is nothing like the taste. Some alcoholic, yeasty, sweet, dark fruits (prunes? grapes?) and a somewhat non-descript aroma that reminds me of an olympic swimming pool.  You can definitely taste the cherries, and I like it. Mellow yet noticeable cherry flavors accent a strongly caramel malt / dark fruity backdrop, complete with a spicy bitterness, but few to no hops. A bit of yeast. Could have more cherries and I wouldn't be at all upset as they seem to be the strong point of this brew. Alcohol isn't concealed all that well but the cherries balance it out to a 4 on taste.  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, thick, rich, with a slight dryness and medium bitter follow-through that's just a tad overpowering. Warming as the high ABV permeates the gullet.  Drinks nicely but definitely a slow drinking, sampling/sharing/pairing with food type of brew.  I love quads, but this one isn't my favorite. A fine brew to be sure tho, no complaints.

42,3457,radioscooter,3.68,"Ommegang is one of my least favorite Faux Belgian breweries. Haven't liked any of them yet. I read a few reviews of this one and listened to the crew comment on it on Beer School podcast, so it seemed like I had to try it anyway.  Poured from a 750 into a goblet.  Appearance is slightly cloudy mahogany, occluded lets say, the head is complex and multi-colored and dissipates quickly into puddles.  The nose is unpromising. It has the Belgian spice smell for sure, but it smells more like it's heading to a midweight Chimay style. That's great, but this is supposed to be a Quad/Blend so I am skeptical.  Flavor is what the nose hinted at. Overpowering alcohol taste, if you can get past the waaay-high carbonation there's some nice flavors there that apparently start with Kriek, but they're being overshadowed by alcohol and carbonation.  The flavors are very promising, but the blend is off. I taste the cherry and the Belgian yeast but there's a bit of a cough syrup thing going on.  Someone described this as syrupy - it's really not. Here's what it is: Take a goblet of Chimay Blue, add 2 tbs. of Cherry Robitussin to the glass, then an unflavored Alka Seltzer tablet for more carbonation. Presto - 3 Philosophers.  For those who like sours or lambics or Kriek - I'm sure this is tasty as all get out. I can drink it, but I wouldn't order it twice.  Not bad, just not a great Quad style example.

There is a slight yeast coating to the bottom of the bottle...I am very excited  S: Interesting almost a champagne smell to this brew. Fruits and cherry? Ok, this is not what I expected, but I am still looking forward to the taste of this one.  T: Very interesting taste and similar to champagne, fruity more than malty, and not very hoppy. You can taste a bit of the 9.8% alcohol in this one. It is very interesting, you should try this beer  M: Highly carbonated, think champagne. Almost too much  D: More of a sipping beer than a drinking beer.  I am going to have to remember this one for New Years.

A: dark yellow head that doesn't last too long. very little lacing. beautiful mahogany color with slight cloudiness.  S: At first smell, it had a hint of wine smell to it. Smelled a hint of fruits and char.  T: Interesting taste. Yeast came through right away. Slightly bitter, but not too bad. Faint cherry taste at times. Last mouthful I had a very distinct taste of cherries. Very Good.  M: I would say a medium carbonation. At first mouthful, it had an almost numbing effect, my wife tried it and she had the same effect. Could have been the carbonation. Left my mouth feeling ""coated"", but in a good way. Very Interesting.  D: Very drinkable. Needs to be sipped to enjoy the mouthfeel and aftertaste. This one is going into by beer cellar. Want to age it and try it again.

I've had this beer cellared for about 2 years and that was really good. Fruity notes, which are typical to the style.  It's very smooth for a 9.8% beer.

Dark tasting, with decent tanins, clear cherry and raspberry tart, faint yeast, and some honey.  Medium mouthfeel, with plenty of tart to keep the tongue honest.

Overall: Had this on tap at a sports bar (it was the only thing worth while on tap) and am very happy I did.

42,3457,RBassSFHOPit2ME,3.78,"2010 label. As fresh as I'm going to taste this beer I'd imagine.  To note - I'll review this beer to style based on the 3 beers I've had in the style. Rochefort 10, St Bernardus abt 12, and Judgment Day. This is my 4th. So all you BAs can take this with a grain of salt if I admit my experience isn't up to par.  From the others I mention, I love that the dark fruits are the base, loving the plum forward, alcohol soaked raisin and brown sugar flavors intertwined together beautifully with a smoooth mouthfeel. Complex. Obviously Judgment Day's profile is moseso lighter fruit forward with pear and plumish apple if that makes sense.  Three Philosophers is much less complex substituting black cherry for the plum and raisin, although the plum and raisin are there if you really look for it. Leaves you wondering a bit ""did I miss something?"" Solid but bland for a Quad. Raisin and Cherry forward and a bit medicinal as explained in other reviews. Very dry. You can tell this beer is a Quad but very average for the style that I've experienced so far. Don't get me wrong...this beer is enjoyable. Grew on me some as I finished the bomber.  Here is where this beer shines. Drinkability for the style. Finishes bone dry leaving you OK being able to finish a second bomber if this beer is your bag.  I'm happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought this beer. No regrets. However, I won't be buying this one again but would never turn it down if offered to me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,PCBrewski,4.1,"Pour: Highly carbonated. Poured from a corked Bomber, marked 2009, so its at least a year old but from my understanding Ommegang is all warm fermented bottle conditioned, so I wasnt worried about spoilage. The head was a tan color and very thick reducing slowly to a nicely sustained lace. Beer color is dark dark red and pretty speckled when held up to light due to all the carbonation.  Smell: Malty Cherry smell, with a very noticeable alcohol smell, almost wine like.  Taste: Malt with slight fruitiness, not too much and a deep dark cherry that lingers. You can certainly taste the alcohol at the finish as well as a lingering cherry.  Drnkability: This is definitly a sipping beer, because it will sneak up on you.

Aroma is predominantly cherries, with hints of yeast and alcohol. Delicious brew, taste is again predominantly cherry with the ABV masked very well. Smooth, silky finish with excellent lacing.

S- Lots of toasty maltiness, some caramel with a slight hint of cherry and a small but noticeable amount of alcohol.  T- Less complex than I expected, although it grew on me throughout the glass. Nice malty taste giving way to faint (almost medicinal) cherry and other dark fruit flavors with a slight alcoholic bite at the end.  M- Full bodied and really incredible mouthfeel. One of the beer's high points in my opinion.  D- Given the high ABV it is quite drinkable. I probably wouldn't reach for another immediately after due to the ABV but outside of that it isn't too much to handle more than one of at all.

42,3457,nickthetick,4.04,"A: dark mahogany, almost burnt brick. Poured into a Ommegang flute like chalice with a khaki head that doesn't hang around a long time or leave a lot of lacing.  S: there is a lot of dark fruit and robust, toasty malt. The hops come out in a citrus note that hangs among the rest of the fruit.  T: the taste matches the nose a lot with a whole lot more of the malt character coming out. Biscuit like malt and yeasty; a lot of those dark fruits and raisins. Not to terrible on the alcohol for being a quad. I get tartness from the cherries at the end, but its a good tart and helps further mask the alcohol content. It has a sweet musty after taste that's nice but doesn't linger.  MF: for as well as the alcohol is masked it still leaves a nice warmth in the mouth that makes it nice for sipping. A heavy body that is common for a quad and is nice, the tingle across the tongue is a nice treat from the Kriek part of this brew.  D: I picked this up in a gift set with a BPA and Triple Perfection and the chalice I mentioned for about 18$ which wasn't terrible at all. I would get this again on a chilly night when I'm in the mood for a sipper but I wouldn't see myself buying it regularly.

Sweet graininess is present. Some sour cherries are noticeable, and the flavor of the cherries increases as the beer warms. I let this one warm up to room temperature and it was fantastic.

The aroma is vaguely reminiscent of cherries, but a little musty and otherwise fairly muted.  Flavor-wise, this beer is quite complex. It is sweet, smooth, and malty with a nice crisp tart finish of cherry flavor and alcoholic warmth. The aftertaste is of booze and raisins in the way the best white ports are.

M: Medium bodied with above average carbonation, finish is smooth and dry.  D: This ale is very drinkable for the higher ABV, but I wouldn't have more than one.

42,3457,BeerNemesis,4.54,"Three Philosophers | 750 ml. | 9.8% ABV | 2008 vintage  Brewer: Brewery Ommegang Style: Quadrupel Glass: Ommegang chalice  Presentation: After a year of cellaring, I popped this bottle out. A line of sediment has settled at the bottom.  Appearance: Coca cola brown with a lackluster mocha head and a lot of bubbles. Subpar lacing. Much of this is due to the aging I think.  Aroma: Dark fruits--raisins, plums, and cherries--drenched in sweet alcohol. There's an ominous musty, earthy smell as well.  Taste: Mon dieu, this is delightful. I wasn't sure what aging would do to it, but there's an inexplicable brightness to the earthy flavors. The dark fruit tastes recede a bit, and while the alcohol is definitely prominent, its saccharine quality is less evident with age. Sweet finish. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Amazingly prickly carbonation after all this time--a nice counterpoint to its velvety body.  Harmony: Aging was a success!  Would I cellar it again?: Yes.

You get a hint of cherry but less then the smell. A bit dry.  M - Medium to full bodied. Creamy and just damn tasty. Carbonation is just right.  D - Yes but don't think you are going to have a few.

T- Wonderful. Cherries and bready, toffee malts that sit smoothly on the tongue with a touch of alcohol warming. This one was pretty sweet.  M- Big, rich body that was very well carbonated.

42,3457,BBP,4.59,"A- Pours a reddish chestnut with great carbonation which supports a thin head. Unfiltered with a good amount of sediment floating around. A thin head when compared to most Belgian beers, but it is still substantial enough to know that it's well crafted.  S- Very nice fruit aroma, even for a quad. Not the standard dark fruit aroma or the standard light fruit aroma, but a bit more sharp and crisp. Cherry, plum, tart, and carmel. The alcohol blends terrifically with the nose as it seems to be directly underneath the fruit, and that enhanced the fruit aroma for me. There are hints of candied fruits as well.  T- Starts with about a quarter cherry flavor, a quarter grape/plum, and the other quarters being caramel, and bready malts. It achieves some very nice balance, and is a bit of a change from the typical quad with the cherry in it. The flavors of the malt and fruit are actually enhanced by the alcohol. Shortly after the drink, there's a small amount of hop bitterness to be noticed.  M- Medium/full mouthfeel. Considerably creamy and the carbonation seemed to be perfectly suited for the drink. Has a slightly dry, moderately sticky finish.  D- I found this to be very easy drinking. The 10% was there, but it blended in with the drink tremendously. The biggest downside of this drink, was that the flavor didn't last as long as it could have. I wish it had more follow through. Aside from that it was a great quad, especially considering that it's an American take on Belgian beer. It is true to the style, and a quality brew.

42,3457,nickfl,3.82,"A - Pours with one finger of off white foam on top of a slightly hazy, amber brown body. The head settles quickly and leaves nice lace.  S - An aroma of tart cherries and spicy caramel malt.  T - Tart pie cherries up front with some sweet caramel. The caramel is joined in the middle by toasted grain and spicy yeast. Clove and coriander notes remain though the finish with some increasingly medicinal cherry.  M - medium body, moderate carbonation, and a balanced finish.  D - This certainly isn't a drain pour, but I am kind of disappointed. I hadn't had this beer in a couple of years and I remembered it being much better than this. The aroma is spot on, but the flavor is dissonant and unpleasant. The spicy yeast character seems inappropriate for a dark belgian and it clashes with the cherry. Maybe it its just that this beer is better in the bottle or maybe it has lost something in the last couple of years, but it seems like a shadow of what I remember it as.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Minimal carbonation up the sides with fantastic full coat lacing.  S- Sweet, very mild toffee and earthiness in the final moments of inhalation. Slight sourness from cherries, strong presence of astringent/rubbing alcohol scent. As it warmed cherry smell became more prominent.  T- Presence of alcohol but blended and finished nicely by the sweet/sour cherry flavor. A good presence of malts, not roasty but the slightest hint of semi sweet chocolate. Licking the lips is full of candy sweetness.  M- especially smooth, not thick. Bleand of frothy head gives creaminess with loads of residue left in the mouth to stimulate the mind to pinpoint the complexity of the taste.  D- not a style of beer I usually drink but am trying to expose myself to.

Taste was like the liquid center of a chocolate covered cherry - The cherry taste was just enough to give you hints of sweet hand picked cherries but not to overpowering,The malt really brought a nice toasted taste that blends the beer together nicely.

This is my first ever quadrupel so take this review with a grain of salt.  Look: reddish brown, and in the right light it looks purple like an eggplant. The head is off white, a little on the brown side, and is fairly short lived. It leaves a small amount of lacing. There is some sediment apparent that settles towards the bottom of the glass.  Smell: there's some mustiness to it with some hints of funky cherry flavors (probably from the cherry lambic added in), with other dark fruit like raisins and fig and alcohol. There are some spices as well as some yeast. There's a lot going on here.  Taste: there's some dark toffee flavors, plums, figs, and some dark chocolate as well as the sour cherries. There's raisins and spices. As it warms it takes on wine like qualities and becomes much more sour. The alcohol is present in the taste as well. Very complex flavor on this.  Feel: full bodied, not a whole lot of carbonation. There's some alcohol warmth, especially when the beer gets warm. Its very dry.  Drink: definitely a sipper. I am sure that is appropriate for the style so I won't hold that against this beer.  Overall, this is really good. I think I now need to revisit their Abbey Ale since I think I reviewed it before my palate was ready for Belgian beer. This was very good and I definitely recommend.

Purple body, with some rusty, reddish brown highlights. Maybe a bit cloudier than I remember it. Thin, slightly red head forms and retains quite well but doesn't leave behind much in the way of lacing. Good looking.  Smell: more than I remember it, the sour cherry aroma is standing out to me. A bit of funk and some dark fruit.  Taste: follows the nose. Dark fruit like figs, black cherry, some raisin and spices. Not as complex as I remember the two year old, 2008 version being. Still, quite good.  Feel/Drinkability: full bodied, a bit thicker than I remember it being, creamy carbonation, and the alcohol is hidden nicely. A bit easier drinking than I remember and I drank my glass fairly quickly.  Overall: quite good. A very solid quad but I prefer it with some age.

The most appealing aspect to this quad is the cherry-esque color, fantastic head/retention and lacing, and overall appearance. Really a great looking beer.  The smell is a strange and difficult entity. At first sniff it's slightly potpourri, medicinal....a bit like a red wine. Definitely alcoholic in smell as well. It's powerful, decadent and alluring.  Wow. I just can't stop thinking wine. Taste, like smell, has a bite of medicine. Strong fruity taste; cherry. Cherry cough syrup. Obviously far more complex.  Aftertaste lingers, and it actually makes you recall and pin-point the taste. Smooth, creamy and not as boozy as you would think; but it is a warming beer.  Drinkability surrounds the evening's activities. Not a session beer, and two of these beers is more than enough. Take my advice, if you have friends that don't like beer, but enjoy red wine....bring this to your next snooty box social.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

S: Lots of dark fruit malt scents come through. Raisins and dates mostly. There is ample cherry scents as well and an underlying caramel/brown sugar richness.  T: There is ample malt flavor throughout the tasting. The cherry flavor is present first, but the dark fruit, rum and brown sugar come through in the middle and the backend. This beer, despite the malt profile, is not overly sweet.  M: Leaves a nice slick feel on the palate.  D: This is a nice beer for a dreary rainy or snowy day. Warms you up on the inside.

42,3457,Lukafer,3.7,"Review from notes  vintage 2010  Pours a dark red/amber with little head.  Smells are the darkest of fruits, some yeast, alcohol and some malt.

42,3457,ryantaussig,4.62,"2010 release.  A: Absolutely beautiful in a tulip glass. Big head gives to a good lacing. Clings to cup well. Reddish brown color.  S: Smells of malt and a bit of cherry. Plenty of alcohol present in the nose. A bit medicinal.  T: Heavy and complex flavors make a great profile. Lots of unroasted malts create a meld of flavor. A trace amount of hops and the heat of the alcohol balance it well. Cherries are noticeable, but not over the top. Very typical of Ommegang to put out such a well balanced beer.  M: Thick and smooth. Has a medium finish that I had expected to be a bit dryer due to the ABV.  D: Thick in body and flavor profile. Definitely goes best with food.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,nhindian,3.9,"A - Poured from a 12oz bottle into an Ommegang flute. Builds up a creamy tan 1.5 finger head that reduces quickly to a little cap. Body is a deep cherry, mahogany color and is cloudy with some sediment. Lacing sticks to the glass for a few seconds, than slowly runs back down to the head, leaving most of the glass fairly clean.  S - Smell is pretty interesting. Getting a lot of dark, candied fruits, plums, figs, malt, and some sweet Belgian sugar. Cherries are also a prominent smell in the nose. Deep and complex, and buried beneath and after agitation, you get a few whiffs of boozy alcohol.  T - Taste follows the nose on this one for the most part, but isn't as well blended. Most of the candied sweetness is lost behind the contrasting tart and sourness of the cherries and as it warms up, the alcohol definitely makes itself known. I would have liked to see this one be a bit more complex. A nice mixture of the alcohol, however, results from the combination of it with the cherry and darker fruits that imparts a sort of rum quality to the beer.  M - Mouthfeel is solid-bodied with slight carbonation. Tingly and the alcohol plays to warm up the mouth.  D - Drinkability is moderate. The taste for the ABV is certainly great, but it's an assured sipper that really sneaks up on you.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,scifan,4.03,"Poured from a 750ml bottle that's been sitting in my cellar since last year. Pours a nice dark amber color with a large off white head. The head starts off huge but soon quickly settles to just a light dusting of foam on top. Nose is a nice mix of caramel malts, cherries, and alcohol. Also picking up a hint of yeasty spiciness in the background. Taste similar to nose. There's a nice caramel flavor and also hints of raisin. But the main flavor on display is the cherry. For such a small part of the blend the kriek really shines. Also getting a bit of that earthy funky yeast flavor from the kriek as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin and is just a little too carbonated. Overall a nice beer and an interesting twist on the standard quad. For the price its hard to beat and of Ommegangs lineup.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Appearance: Dark brown with some light cromson highlights. Two finger beige and fluffy head with average retention.  Aroma: Raisans and other dark fruits splashed in rum upfront. Some caramel and molasses notes are pretty strong too. Background note of cherry. Not very boozy.  Taste: The caramel and rasian notes come out first. Not overly sweet at all. Actually a nice balance of herbal/bitter and sweet. Some rum notes play nicely in there too. The booze is well hidden as well. As it warms, the rum and raisan notes really start to come out much nicer. Some tart cherries come through every once in a while too. Not overpowering in the least.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and chewy with some slight carbonation.  Drinkability: At 9.8% ABV, this is definitely a sipper. One bottle is certainly enough.  Overall, a nice and flavorful quad, but its not overly in your face or complex and suffers from that a bit. Certainly a good beer for the proce, just not a standout.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

S - Fairly deep fruity aroma with cherry being the most prominent. A bit of floral hops and a little maltiness behind the fruitiness.  T - Very heavy fruit flavor early on, most predominantly cherry, but not too sweet. The maltiness and floral hops join in and the beer winds up very balanced. The tartness of the taste sticks around for a bit afterwards.  M - Fairly medium-bodied and carbonated. Though it is fairly smooth and crisp.  D - Fairly bold, but very drinkable. The tartness helps to cover some of the alcohol taste and stays crisp.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

T - Not as complex as I would like out of a quad. Mostly cherry flavors again with little other flavors from the dark fruits that I have come to expect from the style. The cherry flavor seemed syrupy and was not subtle at all. Although the alcohol comes through as a fairly nice taste in the beer.  M - A bit too carbonated, kind of like champagne.  D - For being almost 10%, the alcohol blends well with all the flavors so it is easier to drink than some beers with a similar abv.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,minishfinish,4.52,"This beer has a fantastic malty bouquet with hints of cherry. It's a great bouquet,, and I would suggest the pouring instruction on the bottle be followed. The bottle I had didn't have an exception amount of yeast settlement by any means. Flavor very much malt driven with cherry undertones and strong yeast flavors. Well balanced with great structure. It's a malt bomb, with an almost buttery mouth feel. I love this beer. I must admit that this is my first Quadruple, and my my first from Ommegang.

S: Verynice chocolate toffee notes along with some sticky type fruits like dates and raisins. More so raisin. Nice belgian quality textbook quad nose.  T: alot of the cherry comes through initially and raisin. Most of the complexities from the nose don't seem to carry over to the taste.  M: Not overly impressed with the mouthfeel. A bit lighter and thinner then I like. Light carbonation and not difficult to drink.  Overall: Just a so so quad IMO. Not overly impressive.

Smell was pleasant with a few noticeable notes of cherry (which may have been partially influence by the liner notes on the bottle itself).  Taste - 8/10. I'd have to describe as creamy, large, and very heavy on the 'fruit'. Crispness not so much, but again much so on the cream dept. Good beer overall, just not my favorite.

42,3457,Lauthaha,4.45,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a half-liter beer mug for maximum head enjoyment.  Appearance: Pours a rich mahogany (nearly-ruby) color with a lot of darkness. Head reaches the top of the glass, then recedes to about a half-finger remnant that is sure to stay throughout the drinking process. Lightly dimpled head. Moderate lacing around the sides of the glass.  Smell: Heavy solvent odor which fares well against licorice, clove, nutmeg, etc. The hops are largely floral and hidden against the blanket of spices. Smells like a good autumn beer. Light-syrupy sweetness is also moderately perceivable.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Piney, tingly flavor. The beer comes alive on the tongue, as earthy tones explode into citrus- or banana-like flashes of flavor. Only slightly sweet, with a medium-level of bitterness. Moderate carbonation allows for maximum enjoyment.  Drinkability: I could easily drink one every night. Two on weekends.  I first had Three Philosophers out of a 750 mL bottle, and wasn't cultured enough at the time to actually enjoy it...but even then, it tasted amazing. I bought a four-pack of 12-ounce bottles for about $16, and I think that was a pretty good deal for this brew.

Taste: A medium amount of caramel malts, dark fruits, a bit of clove and cherry, and a ton of esters and booziness. There is a bunch of subtle complexities going on in this beer.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Body is just under medium, carbonation is about right and leads to a bit of a peppery alcohol finish. This beer is nearly 10% ABV and honestly, I can tell. However, it seems to fit the beer about right; the other flavors mix well with it. Overall, nicely done quad by Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Nose brings forward subtle hints of cherries along with some light caramel and dark fruits. Hints of molasses. The taste really doesn't bring much cherry flavor at all. Really, I can't detect it, and it was faint enough in the nose. The taste does bring some Belgian yeasty esters and some caramel. Good, sturdy body that is slightly creamy.

The overall appearance is a thing of beauty and only alludes to the overall quality of the brew. The first taste produces nice cherry hints which can also be smelled as it is being drank. Overall it is a great beer but lost points for me in the drinkability category because of the strong taste.

Good retention, some spotty lace left behind.  Smell- Dark malts, sweet, cherries are deffinitly in there. Carmalized sugar. A tad medicinal.  Taste- This is good. Cherry is hitting me right up front. It tastes Authentic, not medicinal or artifical in taste thankfully. Brown sugar and dark malt sweetness in middle. A subtle breadyness as well.

42,3457,NODAK,4.42,"Aroma is thick and nice....your typical quad smells, such as molasses, burnt sugar, alcohol and caramel. There's also some cherries present as well, which isn't a surprise given what it says on the label.  Pours a brown color in the glass...somewhat thin head.  Mouthfeel is a little thin for what I'd expected. Taste is an interesting mix between malts and sweetness...there's the obligatory molasses and caramel...and there's also a tart cherry taste in the background. The flavors are in pretty good harmony with one another. The sweet malt is pulled back a bit compared to other beers like this as to let the fruit show. In the finish, there's a bit of residual tartness along with a bit of brown sugar...but really, it finishes pretty clean without any astringency, bitterness or roasted character. Much cleaner than most beers like this. The cherry flavor is great in my opinion. Not overdone or fake. Alcohol very, very well hidden.  Absolutely delicious. I highly approve of this beer. Whereas some beers of this style may try to blow people away with flavor, this one has a nice harmony between two flavors which go together quite well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Ta- Hints of cherries, walnut and garden vegetable, only a tad sweet for the first portion of the session then opened up quite well as it warmed. Slight alcohol in the finish nicely complimented the back flavors of yeast and brown sugar.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied and pure, grabbed the tongue and walls of the mouth and made them beg the flavor to open up more.  Drinkability- Yes but not too much, it was a good beer at first and a great beer after about a half hour, I just don't think waiting that long for it to develop deserves too much.

The nose is a menage-a-trois of black cherries, rye bread, and dried wheat. The taste begins with the wheat, burnt this time, then moves into a solid helping of slightly medicinal cherry. If it weren't for that bit o' cough medicine, this would have been great. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a somewhat sticky feel. Overall, a solid outing, but falls a bit short of gem status.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The aroma smells strongly of oranges in addition there is a cough syrup like aroma that is rather strong for my liking, but the pleasant aroma all together with the orangy booze is rather nice. The taste is really nice. There is the bready, banana yeast flavors that would be expected in a Belgian style. The mouthfeel is pretty darn smooth no harshness or bitterness from the alcohol like you would expect. It's pretty drinkable and an overall solid brew.

There was a slight head, with big foam bubbles, but it disappeared quickly.  The nose was really gorgeous with hints of cherries and a definite touch of malty caramel to it. It was certainly inviting.  The mouthfeel was the winning aspect. I have tried a new Three Philosophers, and it appears that the time in the bottle softened the beer. It did not have as sharp of acidity, and the bitterness had all but dissipated. Many people might see this as a flaw, but it actually put the beer more into my preferred style.  Overall, I really enjoyed it. I wish I had more of it, this was simply a left over bottle from a while back. I really enjoyed the experience and it was neat to try the specific vintage.

This was the first craft beer I truly loved (Hennepin was my introduction), and I don't know how I've not reviewed it yet. No time like the present.  It's a gorgeous beer. Thick, pale, fluffy head (suitable for drawing smiley faces in) that eventually simmers down. Deep black-cherry red coloring (no wonder because of the cherry lambic and strong cherry scents and flavors that saturate the beer) that gets a bit lighter towards the bottom of my chalice. The boyfriend (resident beer nerd to my fledgling one) says young Ommegang beers have a distinctive taste, but I haven't had enough to tell. As it stands, the alcohol comes through most tellingly in its scent, though it isn't overpowering or offputting.  Tastewise, this is complex and nigh quaffable.

My mistake was probly serving it cold. But compared to other quads this one does not mask the booze well at all.  Notes: I feel like I need to review this one again. My other Ommegang experiences were good, I waited to try this one last because I love Quads. I gotta say, it looks like a quad, it smells like a quad, but it did not taste like one, or have the same mouthfeel.

Cherry and raisin, some tangy, mildly phenolic spice, and sugar cookies are evident. Maybe a little bit of overripe pear also. A light alcoholic twang is also present, but not overwhelmingly so.  T: Sweet up front - sugar cookieish, with lighter toffee and caramel notes. Also quite fruity - raisins, figs, and of course, cherries.

42,3457,ThePorterSorter,4.32,"This beer. So many things must be said to describe it while also doing it justice.  The three philosophers pours a definite dark amber and has a nice tan head. Flavors that come from this beer are dark and rare, I would recommend the warmer serving temperature of 50F.  First sip of this brew and I know that I'm drinking an incredible lambic. This beer has such character with strong caramel, cherry, and rhubarb all blended into a smooth and surprisingly drinkable beer. The bite this beer provides, with such intense flavors and such a high ABV are exceptional and there is almost no visible weakness.  I am so impressed with the brewery and what the have to offer with the 3 philosophers. My first time trying it was at their brewery tour, however, there is a huge difference between tasting this beer in a 1oz. dixie cup vs. a full 12oz glass. This beer takes time to mellow and reveal its true character. You will not be disappointed with this beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,trf32,3.94,"First of all, a discussion I had with my friend regarding this beer. I told him I got this Ommegang quad, and he says ""Quad? So is that like 13% abv?"" I said no, it's 9.8, and he responds ""Are you sure it's not a Tripel?"" I said that as far as I knew, the name just refers to the amount of malt used and the style of the beer, and some naming discretion is up to the brewer. Not to say this isn't an asskicker of a beer, but perhaps there is a decent argument to be made for it being considered more of a tripel. Anyway, it's just a name, so I'll review it like I'm expecting a dark, heavy, belgian ale. And that it certainly is.  A- Dark amber brown. Leaves a small tan head that retains alright.  S- The first thing I thought was ""sherry-casked scotch."" Then a smell came to me that reminded me of climbing the neighbors' sappy old cherry tree in the summer. I don't know if others had quite such an experience, but I think the aroma is a highlight of this brew.  T- Immediately after taking a sip, I recognize there is some deep complexity here that I might not be able to pick out. However, some flavors are certainly dominant. Immediately the burnt sugar rushes in, followed by cherries, cherries, and cherry pie. In fact, the cherries seem to be pretty much overpowering. The thick malt body is obvious, with the roasted malt character being the only sensation that tops the cherries, however the sticky sweet cherry taste remains much longer. Licking my lips, it tastes like... well, cherries.  M- This is a sipping drink. I took a big gulp just to see if it was a good idea... and it isn't. Sticky, sweet, and burnt; sip this after eating a meal, maybe with some chocolates or, um, cherries.  D- It's not fair to give this low marks here considering that ""drinkability"" is not really supposed to be a feature of this style. However, the intense cherry flavor makes this a drink that you'll probably only want one of even if you like to knock back a few huge, dark, complex malty ales in a row.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

T: Lots of dark fruits, but the cherries really pop here, runs to fine line of cough syrup.... the yeast is pulling it back... There is a slight alcohol burn... Aftertaste is pretty balanced.  M: Medium to heavy mouthfeel, smooth and kind of coats the palate. The carbonation is very slight and the finish is dry.  D: OK this is not a session beer... one and done.

42,3457,StephenRich,4.32,"In Cooperstown NY lie two very amazing spectacles; the Baseball Hall of Fame, and Brewery Ommegang. Since 1997 Ommegang has been brewing award-winning Belgian-style ales which are truly unique. Over the weekend I revisited one of my favorite beers; the Ommegang Three Philosophers.  The Three Philosophers is 98% a Belgian-Style Quadrupel and 2% a Belgian Kreik (Cheery Ale), comes in a corked 750ml bottle at 9.8% abv, and to me it is truly a perfect pairing of flavors; Brewery Ommegang was able to create a beer which is magnificently delicious. It has a perfect balance of sweet and savory (a balance whose line is very thin) making it an amazing beer choice for so many occasions.  The Three Philosophers pours smooth and creamy raising a dense and richly tan to brown head almost one inch off the surface of the beer. With a close look you can see that the the bubbles are so tightly packed together that you could probably spoon the head alone. The beer is an opaque deep purple, showing a lot of mahogany and brown tones. There is an amber hue that glows in the beer every time light catches a glimpse of it, probably due to the small amount of Kriek in the beer.  The nose is perfect also! It opens you up with a rush of tart cherries and cinnamon spice right away, then underneath you get the rich plum and dried fruits thats that I was expecting from the Belgian Quad. There is a balance of roasted chocolate and malt also, with a slight finish of floral alcohol (it does come out as a very distinct yeast scent which is purely Belgian, paying homage to how well Ommegang has matched the authentic Belgian style) . It is close to 10%, and certainly so far is very obvious of that fact. Really, to me it is everything that a good Belgian Quadroupel of this sort should be: rich, deep, alluring, sexy and seductive with huge amounts of flavor and complexity showing themselves even before the first sip.  As you bring the beer close the nose gets richer, and I can almost taste it before it hits my lips! When you bring it in, all the cherry, ripe fruits, cinnamon, clove and spice rush over your tongue penetrating every inch of your mouth. I had to let this beer really sit and caress my entire palate so that I could absorb all of the flavors. The most powerful characteristic is the fruity malt and spice, no question. But its so complex and there is so much going on that you really need to focus to get everything out of it. Underneath, really coming out in the cheeks is dark chocolate and hazelnut, with also fades into the richness of plums, dates, banana, roast and more spice. There is a rum and molasses sweetness everywhere which is complimented by the tart cherries, and balanced by a very specific Belgian dryness coming out of the yeast. This is really they key; without the dryness, the beer would almost be too much. It would be too sweet, and to complicated. But because it is balanced perfectly between sweet and savory, you don't have to focus as I just was. You can sit back, relax, and just let the Three Philosophers serenade your palate with beautiful words of wisdom. Its is absolutely gorgeous.  The mouthfeel is the same; complex, filled with life, but also smooth and calming. It feels like it has a great presence, but at the same time doesn't force the issue. It has a understanding of how to be the man, without running around and shouting about it. Its like your best friend - you know that they are always there for you and will always show you a great time, but they would never have to tell you that. You just know it.  Overall, I love it! This is absolutely a beer I would recommend to everyone, and would be a fantastic beer to use to introduce to new comers who are interested in Belgian beers. Its much easier to drink than it may seem, and it is thoroughly enjoyable. I am willing to bet that it will cellar exceptionally well, however I would also bet that I don't have the patience to find out, unfortunately! If you are enjoying this with food, I would stick with deserts to best pull out the sweet cherries and chocolate. In such case, try it with a flourless chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, Chocolate Cherry Trifle, or really anything with either chocolate or cherries in it!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

There is a bunch of spicy goodness going on, the roastyness of the malt evens it all out, and becomes a warmer due to the fairly strong alcohol presence. Complex is an understatement here.

The aroma was big and Belgian, with medicinal phenols, cherries, sweet malts, hints of spice, and alcohol. Very complex and quite pleasing. The cherry becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. I'm loving the taste of this beer. It is a complex affair, with sweet malts, dark fruit, tart cherries, a splash of bitterness near the end, and quite a dry finish. There is a definite booziness to the beer, and not in a bad way. The alcohol warms as it goes down. As with the nose, the cherry starts to shine as the beer warms.

The cherry flavor is beautifully integrated into the entire taste profile, from the broad malt flavor to the slightly spicy finish of yeast. Dark fruits and malts best describe the flavor, not too many exotic flavors but what's there comes together very well. The nice thing about this beer is that the cherry flavor does not come across as syrupy as is the case in many other cherry-infused beers. Not much alcohol for a 10% brew.  M - Creamy yet light and crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. I feel that it could use a slightly heavier feel to really shine, but it is far from a detractor.

42,3457,bsp77,4.03,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.  Appearance: Very dark mahogany with thick cream-colored head and great lacing.  Smell: Quite pungent with figs, plum, toffee, clove and tart cherry.  Taste: Semi-sweet figs and plum upfront with a nice clove and earthy yeast counterbalance. Cherry tartness rears its head after the initial sip and lasts for a long time. Seems as if this is more than 2% cherry-infused.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, chewy full body, quite warming.  Drinkability: Nice, alternative take on a Quad with the addition of cherry. Personally, I may have enjoyed it more without the cherry, but personal taste aside, this really is a great beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,kwjd,3.77,"Pours a amber-brown colour that starts off with a lot of head, but it quickly dissipates without any lacing. Smell is cherry, plum, raisin and faint Belgian yeast. Taste is a bit tart. Has the cherry that this beer advertises, but not enough of everything else I'd expect in a quad. Carbonation level is nice. A tad boozy, but I still had no trouble finishing my half of this bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jporf911,4,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. No freshness date provided, but this kind of brew could probably age for a year or two.  Appearance- 4 out of 5. The ruby-brown color is somewhat cloudy in the first glass and very cloudy in the second due to the yeast from the bottom being poured into the glass. It is very reminiscent of cherry skin held up to a light, which I suspect is a sign of things to come. The off-white head was two fingers tall and medium in body but left wonderful lacing all around the glass.  Smell- 4 out of 5. Dark fruit, light malt, and cherries dominate the nose of this beer. A deeper whiff brings hints of alcohol and hops, but the overall scent is sweet.  Taste- 4 out of 5. Sweet and smooth. The cherry ale may only embody 2% of the overall volume, but it definitely dominates the taste. Creamy yeast flows along the tongue, bringing tastes of sweet malt and a bit of brown sugar. Gentle hops tingle on the back of the tongue before giving way to a long-lasting sweet aftertaste. There's a reason that the word ""sweet"" is in five of the six sentences of this part of the review; that aspect best characterizes the taste. It's not bad at all, but it should be avoided if you don't have a taste for beers on the sweeter side of the fermented spectrum.  Mouthfeel- 4 out of 5. Medium and creamy, not at all crisp but pleasant on the tongue. The alcohol is warming but otherwise unnoticeable.  Drinkability- 4 out of 5. This is an interesting change of pace from typical quadrupels, but it's only for those who can handle a burst of sweetness that's almost like a bunch of gang-banging cherries orgasmically exploding in your mouth. I could down easily down the whole 750ml bottle, but this beer deserves to at least be sipped frequently instead of outright chugged.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I wouldn't take another one for free...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,gboy515duo,4.77,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a chalice.  The first glass I poured was only a one finger head, but I chalked that up to it not being served at 50 degrees, it was closer to 40. The second glass was nice and frothy and 3 fingers tall.  The body was a dark cherry wood color with a very distinct beige froth on top. It smelled immediately of malt and cherry, with bigger sniffs making you aware of the high alcohol content in the brew.  At first taste, the beer is hoppy, but smooth, with hints of cherry, alcohol nowhere to be found. The malts break through and bring sweetness that leave your cheeks wondering where the next sip is and when it is coming. The cherry flavor slowly takes over with each sip, masking the ever present 10% ABV. You feel the warmth of the alcohol after a few sips, and it's not too overpowering at first. It has a slight burn that is almost unnoticeable. When you swallow it, it is extremely frothy and the flavor doesn't go anywhere. It sticks to your palate for a long period of time.  Considering such a high ABV, it is crazy easy to drink. It goes down so easy. The flavors break through as you keep drinking revealing tastes of caramel malts and the great taste and smell of a variety of nuts.  As you end up taking larger gulps further into the bottle, they bring a nasally alcohol filled feeling along with fruity aromas to make the flavors even bigger. The alcohol only comes out at the very bottom of the 750, and might I add that at this point, you're probably sufficiently inebriated where you just won't care.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this offering from Ommegang, and the whole 750ml to myself had me buzzed to a great point that didn't go away for a few hours. I drank it while I watched the MLB All-Star Game, and finished it before the 4th inning and I was feeling it well up until I went to bed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Shakesbeere,4,"2008 brew. Deep red amber pour. Light head. Strong wine aroma -- alcoholic and fruity (cherry). Flavor comes in two stages. The primary stage is malty cherry and dark fruit. The secondary stage is alcoholic -- with a cherry base -- with some limited floral hints. The body is of medium thickness. The flavor and aroma are sophisticated and complex and lead into a delicate finish. If philosophy is an intellectual method of elucidation compared to a scientific doctrine of propositions, then beer philosophizing is too an activity that clarifies our thoughts of the fine brew. The Three Philosophers quadrupel exemplifies this activity.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,zoolzoo,3.92,"A: Just about red, appears to be more than 2% Kriek. When held up to light, the body shifts to a cloudy copper more-so than red. Bubbly, spritzy, two finger head into a white cap, no real lacing to speak of.  S: Rich buttery malt..cherries and spices. Cherry jam and butter spread on a warm biscuit. I would give the aroma a 5.0, if not for some distracting booze. Still, excellent.  T: Yeasty/spicy characteristics are more apparent than in the nose, but buttery malt and dark fruits reign supreme. Subtle hints of cherry set the overall tone, and also lend a surprisingly tart finish. Warming alcohol lingers.  M: Medium bodied, aggressively carbed - which lends it self pretty well to the tartness of the cherries, especially in the finish.  D: Although pretty easy to drink when it warms a bit, this beer remains around 10% ABV...and I can taste it. Its flavorful, surprisingly tart, sweet, and a bit boozy. 12oz is enough, but I am enjoying every bit of it!.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Plum and brown with amber edges, a half finger white head sticks around forever (it's still there, they had to throw out the glass).  Smells lke some dark ripe fruit. Plum, cherry, raisins, brown sugar and Belgian yeast. Some noticeable alcohol.  Taste is rather underwhelming. I've had this beer a ton in the past, I'm a fan of quads, but this is just too ambitious and too transparent for me. I'd love a bit more yeasty esters, but instead I get dark fruit, brown sugar, vanilla, booze, and puke. I'm not kidding. The aftertaste from this beer tastes like vomit from someone who has been drinking raisin vodka. Disgusting.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy carb, and tons of heat from the obvious alcohol.  Drinkability suffers from the hotness. I have a 2006 bottle in the cellar and will re-rate, but this beer just falls waaaay short of the legends of quadrupel fame.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

S - Absolutely lovely aromas of sweet malt with nice bready hints. Sourdough and some toasted spicy hints as well. Very nice aromas. Mild cloves and some yeast aromas as well.  T - Starts of with sweet almost honey like malt and nice bready hints. There is also some nice toasted character and flavors to it. Spicy flavors are abundant as well with some clove and some peppery hints. This is a very delicious beer comparable to Belgian produced Quads. The high ABV is not as perceivable as other 9.8 beers.

The only aromas I could pick up on were fruit wtih a trace of alcohol. The flavor followed the smell with only fruit and alcohol showing up. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not bad for a quad. It was very smooth and drinkable.

Smells include plums, maraschino cherries, grapes, and sweet candy. Taste is again a sweet blend of fruits and fruity candy: cherries, plums, grapes, and apples are all prominent. This is really mellow with only a mild alcohol flavor that is hidden really well for something approaching 10% ABV.

O: Such a pleasure to drink! What a unique beer. It's satisfyingly rich but isn't cloying or heavy. Lives up to the hype. Curious how it will age.

Great two finger sized light brownish and red head that provided nice lacing throughout.  Nice nose with some malt notes and fruit notes. The fruit is not overwhelming on the olfactory senses, but nicely understated with some noticeable cherry hints along with some other fruits including plums and raisins.  The medium bodied mouthfeel hits you with some malt caramel upfront, moved smoothly into a lingering lightly tart cherry finish with a slight alcoholic warmth. Also noticeable on the palate are notes of vanilla and even some semblance of chocolate (?!) malt.  This was an enjoyable quadrupel and something I will revisit on an annual basis and maybe even head back to get another one to age at temperature for 9-12 months and see what happens then...

I imagine time in the bottle will remedy this issue. As for right now, the flavors are there but they don't mead together in a smooth fashion.  M - Light and airy through until the finish where it gains some weight and stickiness.  ~ This is a good beer. I have a feeling I'm drinking this bottle at a somewhat premature state.

S - Nice smell of dark fruits - plums, cherries, grapes, dates, raisins, and maybe a little banana. Alcohol is detectable.  T - Good taste. Plums and cherries definitely come through the most. There is a nice malty backbone that gives this brew a warming sensation which is supplemented by the alcohol doing the same. Very very rich flavors - almost too rich - that interact very complexly.  M - Medium bodied. Limited carbonation. Very malty overall.  D - Fairly drinkable though not overly so. The sweetness becomes a bit much after a while. The aroma, flavor, and look of this beer are enough for me to buy it again though. If anything, buy this beer so that you can LOOK at it.

For me it tasted like a chocolate covered cherry with liquor infused into it, which I do not find very appetizing but I can appreciate the complexity and subtleties of this Belgium style brew. I feel that it had great length from start to finish and the taste lingered long after my last sip. The color is a deep red with a nice rich head. With a slightly aggressive pour, the nose opens up and the aromas are exactly as they taste. The texture is very smooth, slightly thick and easy to drink, perhaps comparable to Guinness from tap but much larger in complexity and body.

42,3457,DefenCorps,3.88,"Bottle from 2008 that I shared at dinner tonight.  Pouring a beautiful crimson with a dense, brown head with great retention and lacing, this beer looks gorgeous. The benefit of having been undisturbed for a month shows, the clarity is great.  The nose is solid. I'm not one to like sweeter quads, but this one is good. Fruity cherry and plums are apparent right away, with vanilla, brown sugar., caramel and a little yeast. In general, this is richer and sweeter than the best of the style. The kriek character doesn't really show, as IMO, the base beer is rather fruity to start with. There's some chocolate in there too. The palate opens with a rich brown sugar and vanilla sweetness with some bready character, along with a pronounced fruity character. The fruit nature strikes me as particularly yeasty, again, suggesting that it's from the base quad and less from the Lindemans Kriek. There might be a whisper of tartness in there as this beer finishes sweet with brown sugar and cherries. This medium-full bodied beer has a soft, smooth carbonation and feels lush on the palate. Solid stuff, I wonder how the 05 in my cellar is doing.  ** 14 Mar 2014**  2006 vintage. Happy Pi day!  The nose is a blend of spice, dark fruit , a mild medicinal cherry character, a little Brett and warming booze. The palate is fruity, mildly brown sugar, honey, cherry, a little paper.

Has a scent that smells like an assortment of fruits (Mainly Cherries). The smell also reminds me of wine. Of course you get a hit of the 9.8% alcohol in the nose.  T-M: Has a very strong kick to the taste. Can taste the assortment of fruits (cherries). Kind of get a earthy bitter taste in the transition into the aftertaste. Pretty malty at the beginning.

The smell is full of cherries, can't go wrong w/ that in my book. The taste is very warm and sweet, filled with cherries. The alcohol is present w/ every sip and leaves a slight tasty burn. This beer is very creamy and smooth. Although the alcohol is very present, the drinkabilty is dangerously good. Must respect this one.

42,3457,SpdKilz,4.2,"Appearance - Pours a murky dark reddish brown color into my sniffer. About a finger of tan head is achieved with a moderate pour though it quickly recedes, leaving moderate lacing.  Smell - Dark fruits such as cherries (obviously), plums, raisins, and alcohol on the initial sniff. As it warms up spices and caramel become more prevalent.  Taste - Surprisingly this has quite a kick to it. Malty up front with a massive kick of cherry flavor though not in the ""fake"" sense. Honestly, it reminds me of Michigan cherries. A refreshing yet malty sensation oddly (for such a heavy and high abv beer). Also, heavy fig and raisin presence after the cherry flavor dissipates.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation (a bit low but fits the style) and a sweet finish.  Drinkability - I will no doubt seek this out again. I have been drinking this for the past forty five minutes or so and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Honestly, the cherry taste in it just makes my day. This is a great tasting quad and for a style I have not really enjoyed in the past, this has made me look highly upon Brewery Ommegang.

42,3457,wikk3d,3.82,"Appearance - Darker than I thought it would be for a Belgian Style brew. Dark amber body with a very light tan foam head that fills the glass pretty thick. The lacing was also very ""wet"" for a Belgian style. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Aroma - Very robust smell, hint of fruit, cherry, and alcohol. I almost got a hint chocolate, although it's very subtle.  Taste - Very sweet for it's color and smell, cherry is noticeable as well as the strong alcohol taste. Almost bitter like a red wine. There was also a slight woodyness that lingers as it goes down.  Mouth - Much like a wine, this tasted a little dry as I sipped on it. Very full bodied flavor however. You can tell once you pour it by the color that it's going to be a heft beer. The after taste lingered for a while on my tongue. Again the bitter and woody flavors come out the most.  Drinkability - This is a very good beer that has a style of it's own as far as most other Belgian style beers I have had. The dark body and taste give it a very rich, full bodied flavor that lingers for a while.

42,3457,bamadog,4.22,"Finally picked up a 12 oz. bottle of this to try. I've had a 2008 750 mL in my closet for a while now and was wondering when a good time to crack it would be, so I figured this would at least give me some frame of reference. Review is from notes taken on 5/15/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip.  Appearance: Pour is a deep dark mahogany with ruby highlights; starts with a massive 3 finger light tan (cinnamon colored) head with solid retention that takes a while to fade; body is hard to see through, but it shows moderately strong carbonation; a nice, nearly full curtain of lacing is left behind.  Smell: Sweet Belgian-style candi malts with wonderful dark and rich spiciness; there are deep and dark fruits as well, like raisins, plums and figs; nice caramel maltiness and a bit of a tart cherry scent; at the end of whiff, there's a definite presence of an alcoholic vapor, but at 9.8%, this should be expected.  Taste: What a wonderful quad, and I'm sorry that I've waited this long to sample it. The tart cherries are definitely present, as well as deep, dark caramel malts with strong hints of chocolate and sweet dark fruits; nice Belgian yeast and spiciness (coriander); definite presence of alcohol; the bottle is from 2009, and I may give my '08 another year to let it mellow out a bit more, but even if I didn't, I'd still really enjoy it.  Mouthfeel: Body is of medium weight; a thick, moist and sticky coating hangs on the roof of the mouth; a warm drying vaporous air is left, leaving the cheeks tingly and the belly especially warm; carbonation is soft and smooth.  Drinkability: While I really enjoyed all the aspects about this beer, it sits a tad heavy and the higher ABV definitely made itself known by the end. I really think 12 oz. is a great serving size of this as it allows for moderate indulgence, so when I do crack my '08, it will HAVE to be in the presence of friends.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,hbis2gut,3.5,"I'm a big fan of this brewery, but this particular offering falls a bit flat for me. There's something particularly cloying to me in the aftertaste. It claims a small percentage of cherry added, but I don't pick that up at all. I think some tartness or sourness could really perk up or balance the heavy malt character.  Granted, I don't know if ""Quadruple"" is even a real category, and if so, whether or not this fits the style. It's simply ok. The flagship and the Hennepin are far better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,omnigrits,4.2,"750ml bottle into a tulip.  A rich, dark colour. not quite opaque, with a typical Belgian style head and plenty of lace. The aroma is sweet and malty; there's a hint of the cherries within. It almost reminds me of my favourite cough syrup from when I was a kid, but nowhere near as medicinal. Taste is a little on the sweet side for my palate, but I'm sure that if I was pairing this with a dessert or some fine cheese I'd enjoy it a whole lot more. This is a very well made beer to be sure.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Thick full amber head, well carbonated, very effervescent. Dark russet brown color. Smells like brown suagr and tart cherries, but overall aroma is light. Starts with molasses and dried fruit, dates, prues. Finishes herbal, caramel and with a fair amount of heat from the ethanol. Light to medium body.  Would definitely get this one again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Zekezilla,3.7,"Appearance-2 finger head, didn't linger. Not much lacing either. I'm torn on this beer, overall. I had very high expectations based on what I've read a/b this brewery but I'm a little disappointed. The taste is good (cherries, raisins, warmth) but the booziness in the taste is just too prominent for me to really enjoy it. As others have mentioned, this one is definitely a sipper and best with food.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BabyBastard,3.75,"Picked out one of my '09 bottles to review. Cork and caged, pours into chalice very dark brownish red, hazy with not much head and spotty lacing. Given, this was the initial pour, and it is slightly chilled.  This has a strange, sour smell, predominately cherry in nature. Surprising considering the 2% addition, but it is very pronounced. Too me, this has a hard liquor scent, very strong alcohol in the nose, though it is still slightly chilled. Who knows, this may calm itself as it warms a bit. We will see. Dark malts and cherries, slight bit of sugary sweetness also present in the nose, though it's overwhelmed by this hot alcohol nose.  Taste has that odd cherry front, followed by a nice, malt backbone. Not overly sweet on the palate, though a bit of sweetness can be detected on aftertaste. This sweetness seems to be washed away with the alcohol burn, shortly after consumption. Not a major burn, more like a gentle, warming of the stomach once it hits. Still, crazy how the 2% of cherries can add such a pronounced, cherry flavour to this brew. Not unpleaseant, if you like cherries, but may be a bit too much for some who are not used to the whole ""cherry"" thing. It is good, in my opinion.  Feel is very unlively. Not much carbonation to be had, and agitation of the brew does not seem to help much. Feels a bit flat on the palate, though it may just be my bottle. Still, this is smooth, not sticky or oily in the least, and a very easy drinker, if you can get past the up front cherry characteristics of the ale. Drinkability is slightly above the average for me, though I'll keep the rest of my bottles for evaluation further down the road. My opinion, if you see this one, give it a shot.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BARFLYB,3.15,"2009 12oz bottle into a tulip style glass in the late afternoon of a sunday. This was one of my 1st craft beers around eight years ago.  Hisss as the cap was pryed off, three philosophers pours out a mixture of muddy waters brown sprinkled with some red spots from the cherry addition. As the liquid reached 1/2 way up top a dark beige head exploded upwards looking beautiful. Straggely lace.  On first whiffs, it's apparent this quad was not made in Belgium, It's just not sweet enough for all that. There is a nice mixture of sweet malt, cherries, plums, chocolate, nuts and alcohol. This is a freshie so the alcohol I kinda expected. Seems to meld better with warming.  Im first greeted by a malt blast that's kinda sweet kinda caramele kinda whatever. After that the cherries poke their heads through giving off a cherry pie vibe. It's amazing the amount of cherries come through from just a 2% addition. A bit of chocolate but for some reason the residual sugar vibe I get out of foreign quads is lost altogether. 3P needs more sugar, preferably the turbinado kind.  Feels a bit thin for the style, I would say it's a healthy medium with a low amount of carb. Im used to low carbed quads so there is that. Small bursts of alcohol in spots depending how I swish it in the mouth, but no heat of any kind.  I think I know why I have not had this in awhile, it's just underwhelming in many area's andI remember those same thoughts from years ago. It's pretty drinkable but after 6oz's or so I was pretty much done with it. The bottle says this is ageable for up to five years, but I don't see this getting any better, it's just not that complex enough as it is.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JBogan,2.82,"Poured a dark brown with reddish tint. Small off white head which left minimal lacing.  The aroma was of malt, cherry and alcohol.  The taste followed the smell, yet wasn't as satisfying. The cherries gave it a cloying sweetness which I found too much to take after less than half the bottle was gone.  The mouthfeel was nothing special. Somewhat thin and lifeless.  Overall I was quite disappointed in this beer. it seemed to be yet another example of a non Belgian brewer trying to make a Belgian style beer and coming up well short. I might try this again at some point, but won't be in any hurry.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,theboozecruise,4.18,"Picked this one up on a trip to Houston... poured it from the 22 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. It's a murky reddish brown color... creamy off-white head with great retention. Certainly looks good!  It smells of fruit... cherries and raisins primarily. There's a hint of floral note behind the fruit aromas. The taste is fruity as well... sweeter up front and slightly bitter towards the end. The alcohol presence is noted on the tongue slightly but not overpowering. A melon flavor comes out as well as some of the cherry flavors. One of the more wine-esque beers I've tried recently.  Not a bad beer at all, but far from my favorite Belgian quad style ale. Seems to be lacking a little malt balance in there.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A: Pours a translucent reddish-brown. About a three finger whitish head that lasts and lasts.  S: Malt and caramel, a touch of cherry. Could be stronger in the smell.  T: Cherries are the first thing I notice- not overly tart, not too sweet either. Caramel and malts follow. Cherries become even more prominent as the beer warms. Nice.  M: A little thin for a quad, probably due to the kriek blended in. Carbonation is good.  D: Obviously, if I hadn't had another 9+% beer before this one, it wouldn't have hit me so hard.

Nearly opaque, but some bubbles visibly rise to the top of the glass. Decent head retention with some lace stick.  Smell: Dark fruits power the olfaction, primarily cherry. Surprisingly sugary malt on the nose as well. Alcohol is present, along with a slightly medicinal nature.  Taste: Caramel malt sweetness up front, quickly followed by sweet and tart cherries. Alcohol bursts through, and a tart cherry / medicinal flavor ends the sip. Alcohol lingers in the aftertaste. The 2008 is more mellow, with nearly no hop presence to note.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, a little bit creamy in the middle as well. It loses its carbonation as it warms, although the character becomes somewhat deeper. Warming.  Drinkability: A sipper. The tart cherry taste provides an interesting foil to the style. Aftertaste limits viability of having more than one or two. Probably better to have paired, than alone, as I did.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Not much malt sweetness, but LOTS of fruit. Prolonged bitterness on the finish reminds me of a port wine or a peaty scotch. Very organic, very sweet, and a great hop.  Mouthfeel - smooth, sweet and very silky. Almost a creaminess to it. Aftertaste is mellow and inviting. A very good ale.

A rich, foamy, off-white head sits on top and retains very well thanks to some hefty carbonation. Body is cloudy and reddish brown, barely allowing light through. Each sip coats the wall in thick, frothy lacing, though that lacing doesn't have much staying power.  Smell: Tart cherries, doughy malts, and potpourri-like esters. Honeysuckel and some sort of mild citrus also peak through. Cinnamon? Not as complex as I had hoped. Still pleasant; very smooth.  Taste: Dough, lemon, white pepper, red currants, caramel, and earth. Finishes on a strong, cherry schnapps note. Lots of phenols in this on - dang! Not a huge fan of this beer, but it's certainly bold and interesting.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is fantastic: active but very soft; tons of minute bubbles caress the palate. Foamy when swished. Finishes very dry and warm, leaving a good deal of alcohol in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel is much smoother than I expected, just a little tingly carbonation. Right down the middle neither heavy nor light.

A rich-dark red-brown beer with about two fingers of head and small bubble trails up the sides of the glass. Beautiful lacing.  S: Malty fruits (the label suggests cherries) dominate the nose, with a background spiciness and a tinge of alcohol. Very complex, very pleasant.  T: Hmm, a difficult beer to describe. It tastes of alcohol laced with fruit, or maybe fruits soaked in alcohol. The sweetness is met by some slight bitterness, on which I can't quite put my finger -- maybe tea or some herb? Mildly sour aftertaste, but in a good way, as with wine.  M: Perhaps the weakest point of this otherwise excellent brew, but not much bad to say. Much lighter than I anticipated, little carbonation. Unlike some quads, there is no stickage or film in the mouth, something I miss. It is, if anything, too clean a mouthfeel for my taste.  D: Exceptional. The complexity of the beer is engaging, keeping me smelling and sipping. The surprising lightness of taste allows many such sips to continue.

True to the ingredients in it, you can get some tart cherry in the nose. 3.5/5.0  Taste - Definitely a Belgian beer with all of the spices that I would expected in a Dubbel/Trippel/Quadrepel beer, but the tart and mildly sweet cherry flavor (which isn't overpowering - you're not drinking a cider here) adds a very different spin. It subdues the normal spiciness of the Belgian beer, then adds a level of tartness that finishes off each taste.

The aroma increases as the beer warms up, after which you can start to smell some of the alcohol. T: Cherries are very apparent in the taste along with hints of raisins and spices.

42,3457,TCHopCraver,3.77,"Review is from notes taken on 2/10/10.  A: Poured into an over-sized wine glass. Showed a deep mahogany color with an off-white/brownish colored 2-finger head. There was a bit of a reddish tint in the body from the 2% Kriek. Light lacing on the glass disappeared after a bit.  S: Lots of raisin, fig, fig newton (tehe) with a hearty yeast character supporting the fruitiness. There was an unmistakable aroma of maraschino cherries in the background. I don't really care for maraschinos, but it was not a dominant smell, so it didn't offend me that much. A caramel sweetness was also evident, and as the beer warmed, the cherry smell faded and some alcohol notes appeared.  T: Big, rich malt taste. I have to say that the fake cherry taste was just a little too much for me. There was, however, a pretty good balance between the fruity (raisin, fig) sweetness and a spicy, clean finish from the yeast and hops. The good fruit flavors became the dominant taste as the beer warmed.  M: Nice, full, tingly feel. It really nailed all of my taste buds and warmed my palate.  D: I like a lot about this beer, but that darned maraschino cherry flavor was just too heavy in the flavor mix for me.

42,3457,ncfranklin,3.31,"Poured into a small goblet.  A : Gorgeous. Love this blood red to burnt orange appearance.There is just something very alluring about this tone.  S : We start with a little rich malt smell, and slowly flow into a strong lambic of seemingly cherry. Fitting of the color, and enjoyable. Not overly powerful however, the only lacking quality.  T : Follows the smell almost to a tee. Malty start, the hint of the fruit lambic pokes in, but it quickly resides into a warming alcohol burn. Nothing, overly stands out again.. which is a negative in my book, but might be a plus to someone who wants a more complex flavor.  M : Medium, especially for a Quad. As it sticks around, the tingling says hi.  D : Despite the high ABV%, and the obvious presence of it in the taste, this one is relatively cheerful on the way down. You won't be gulping it, but its complexity intends it to be sipped in the first place.  Overall, this isn't my favorite beer because I prefer stronger prominent flavors. However, I can appreciate its subtly and use of lambic as a mix to create something unique, if not muddled. Something everyone should probably at least try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jeffthecheff,3.55,"2009 750ml bottle from the Ommegang gift pack.  Poured into the stemmed Ommegang gift set glass, it has a really dark, ruby red color. The head from the second glass on was almost non existent for some reason, with just the weakest of thin white lace.  The aroma has some nice dark fruit character to help incorporate the cherries, which is the most interesting part of the beer. Three Philosophers has the classic quad characters...dark fruits, spicy yeast character, and some dark malts. Unfortunately, they don't seem to come together as well as they could. There is also a little bit more alcohol on the nose than I would like, especially as it warms. I can't find a lot wrong with the aroma, but it's not great either.  The flavor is nice with some syrupy fruit character of grapes, plums, and of course, cherries. There is some light acidity that reminds me of green apples. Alcohol is a bit stronger on the palate than most Quads. There is a lingering, sticky sweetness on the finish. Again, not bad but all the characters don't fit together the way I would like. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a lot of carbonation. It's full and lively, but some foam in each sip would be nice.  Finishing this bottle became a bit of a chore towards the end.

42,3457,zoso493,4.35,"Poured from a 750 ml corked and caged bottle into a Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Pours a reddish auburn color that has a very bubbly two-finger head that dies down fairly quickly, leaving a little lacing on the side of the glass as it goes down. Three Philosophers is a much redder quadruple than is average, but it makes a pretty beer all the same.  Smell: The cherries display themselves very prominently in the nose, so much so that smell almost resembles that of what might be a cherry lambic. The yeast strain is spot on, though, as you would expect from the dedicated brewers at Ommegang, and it released a lot of floral esters. There is also a touch of graininess in the smell as well.  Taste: Again, the cherries are the primary actor in the taste, but this time this added fruitiness gives the beer a Merlot-like quality. It also gives the beer a unique tartness to it that is unlike many other examples of the style. Apart from the cherries, there are some rum-soaked dark fruit which I am particularly enjoying, as well as a healthy but tolerable tinge of estery alcohol. The lightly toasted malts round out the taste, though I'm sure I've overlooked some specific flavors.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel in Three Philosophers is exceptional in my opinion. It is extremely highly carbonated yet manages to retain just the optimal amount of body. It remains crisp but still has just enough ""stick"" to it to remind you that yes, this a beer worth remembering. The cherry tartness probably adds a good bit of the crisping sensation, which is a great highlight of the beer.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable quadruple, despite weighing in at almost 10% ABV. It's so smooth and it hides the alcohol much better than most quadruples or Belgian strong dark ales that you'll find, though I will concede that I can tell it's there.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable example of the style, and I would expect nothing less from the guys at Brewery Ommegang. The cherries added a nice and very unique touch, but still allowed the beer to remain true to style, which is a huge prerequisite, in my opinion, for American brewers making Belgian-style ales. It's complex but still very drinkable. This is a must-try beer for anyone, and I would gladly drink it again.  Edit: I bumped the appearance score from 4 - 4.5 to represent what I thought was a fair score for the beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A- Pours a dark amber fluid that has a thick haze of sediment floating inside it. Quarter inch head falls to a light froth leaving random patches of lace.  S- Rich malts upfront with massive alcohol presence. This very forward scent is followed by dried plums, sweet raisins and figs.  T-M- Taste is one of a kind with a heavy dose of strong ale flavors of vanilla, oak, alcohol and fruit. In more depth i'd say the flavors are a yeasty plum, thick carmel malt, sweet raisin and a hell of a dose of grain alcohol warm. Great beer in the aspect of being almost 10% and drinking like a Dubbel. Mouthfeel is a bit raw with light carbonation leading to excessive alcohol warming on the tongue but hey its a Quad!

The smell is maple, cherry, and alcohol with a nice refreshing breeze of hop.  There is a definate alcohol burn to the beer, but the other flavors manage to dominate the palate. The sweet malts and cherry taste really hit the tongue nicely, though I generally don't care for cherries those used in this beer did not affect me adversely. That could be due to the subtleness of Ommegang's use of it; it enhances the sweet molases and maple flavors rather than overtaking.  This was a nice thick bodied quad I'm glad to have tried.

Otherwise it was a plenty dry sour malt, though not as heavy as I expected. The aftertaste was a pleasant light bitterness.  Given the cherry additions, I guess I was expecting a lambic-esque or Flemish Red Ale type brew. It wasn't like either, but it was nice.

Spicy Belgian yeast notes are noticeable as well.  Rather malty flavor without much sweetness to speak of. Lots of spice notes and complex, yeasty flavor. Fruit notes are more subdued, but some tartness and a bit of funk are certainly noticeable. Dry finish.  Velvety texture with nice, crisp carbonation. A deep, rich, and complex beer. A sipper, although any alcohol character is quite subdued.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,carwreCk,3.85,"This is an odd one. I don't have much experience with quads or lambics. I dislike the banana flavor often found in quads but I'm not finding it here. I am, however, finding lots of dark malts that can be described as tasting like prunes, grapes, dark cherries, and caramel and even a bit of chocolate in the background. The lambic provides a tartness on the finish, and some cherry before. An odd beer, indeed, but a good one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BeanBone,4.64,"Appearance: A nearly clear reddish-orange body capped by a little less than a finger of cream-colored head that features good retention and lacing.  Aroma: A complex mix of rich burnt-sugar malt, a little funk, a splash of cherries, and a hint of booze--top marks.  Taste: Almost exactly what the aroma promised. Roasty burnt-sugar malt, raisins, sour cherries, a hint of nuttiness, and a nice spice component (mostly clove)--again, complex and satisfying (though it sounds substantially more simple on the page). The alcohol peeks through from time to time, but I wouldn't have guessed it weighs in at almost ten percent. Dark fruit, hints of booze, and rich malt in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with good carbonation and a sticky finish. It leaves a little slick residue and some warmth on the tongue.  Drinkability: With damn near double-digit alcohol content and acres of complexity, this is a beer that does best when you slow down and pay attention.  Verdict: This is a beer I love to sit down with and enjoy over the course of an evening--it's also a versatile pairing for a meal, working well with a variety of entrees and desserts. Thoroughly interesting when fresh, I'm dying to find out how this will taste in a few years.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Cherries hit first, then honey rum cake malts, and phenol pop and a touch of peppermint hops. Tight bitter finish, medium body, round feel, slight burn.  This is a puzzle - too thin and not malty enough to be a real quad. But there's not just balance here, also an Orval-type depth.

G: English style pint glass and cognac snifter (tried both types)  A: dark cherry red/ruddy brown. Nice head when poured as directed on the big bottle.  S: hint-o-cherry, informing me of what's to come. After a few sips, it gets a bit overwhelming. Certainly the cherry is masking some strong essences otherwise, but I can't pick them out right now.  T: the addition of cherries breaks up the boozieness on the initial hit. Definitely a strong beer. Good tasting.  M: smooth and very coating, probably due to the booziness. Disappears slowly. Very satisfying to me.  D: It's a bit rough after a few sips. I needed a snack to break it up, so I had some sharp cheddar slices.  I liked it overall.

Cherries aren't quite my thing, so for me, this isn't great, but it's still good.  Mouthfeel: Feels almost like a soda with vigorous carbonation.  Drinkability: This isn't quite my thing.

Big head that subsides into a patchy foam and a bit of lace.  S &#8211; Quite similar to most Quads, except better olfactory than most.

The foam begins as a crown, but quickly recedes into the darkness that is the Three Philosophers.  The smell gave a strong, but not overwhelming presence of alcohol. The fruity cherry scent begins to foreshadow itself during this stage of the experience.  When it encircles your taste buds, the dark fruit flavor begin to awaken you to a very familiar taste as a Michigander... Cherries. Although I'm not a huge fan of the fruit, this flavor is very welcoming to my palate.  The feel in the mouth is velvet. The sharp sting of alcohol is absent as the warming Belgium Quadrupel warms and pleasantly tickles your now smiling lips.

The first thing that I thought of when I tasted this was that it would be delicious as a sour. Just at some Brett, Pedio and Lacto and this could be amazing.  The appearance is dark amber with lighter edges. It has a gradient of dark to lighter ambers which is pretty. The head has a really nasty tan-green color that is really disturbing. It doesn't last long and turns into a few bubbles hanging on to the sides of the glass. No lacing.  The smell is faint, but what is there is good. Cherries is a big one, and with this being two years old that is impressive. Yeasts are very strong, as well as other fruits like peaches and apricot.  The tastes in this one are pleasant, and after being two years old I believe some tastes have faded and given way for the dominant tastes. Cherries, strong grassy yeasts, caramel malts, and peaches. This thing is pretty tasty.  The mouthfeel is carbonated aggressively, but it has died down enough for it to just push the flavors out perfectly. Still not really thick on the palate as I would like it to be. Maybe a little higher gravity would do this thing wonders. The cherries and fruits bring a great sweetness to it. This is a good brew that I would buy again. Granted I bought the 2008 version, and it has been aging in the dark parts of a fridge for two years, I still would buy another. I enjoyed this.

Soft scents of raisins, cherries, figs, yeast and brown sugar can be found punctuated by a nice pungent earthy/herbal aroma.  Taste begins with prickly carbonation on the tongue up front quickly giving way to a dazzling array of cherries and raisins. About mid palate caramel, and light toffee notes begin to really shine through the fruit along with a medicinal cloves. Finishes quite smooth leaving the flavors to linger for a long time on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is medium body. The initial pour and ABV had lead me to believe that this would be a thicker beer, but is infact misleading. Despite that, it still very good for the style.  Drinkability is superb.

Light refracts shimmeringly in the thick brew. Nice.  Smell is full of rounded notes of yeast, a tart fragrance, raisin, hints of citrus, earth, caramel, and alcohol. It's a medium aroma, and quite tempting.  Taste is a marvelous blend of caramel, candy sugar, raisin, plum, yeast, and it crests with notes of soft spice, herbosity. The finish is juicy, full of sweet and tart, with a wonderful bitterness sneaking in to make it a clean and wonderful sip. As it warms the sweet and fruit flavors become more prominent, the tart starts to mingle, and so does the herb and bitter to balance. Alcohol, which was present in the nose, is undetectable in the flavor. Yumm.  It looks thicker than it drinks, it's actually medium body, and has a very tasteful (read low) carbonation. This mouthfeel presents the flavors well, and promotes a truly excellent finish.  Drinkability is very good. While this is a sipper, I found myself taking larger gulps and multiple swallows because it tastes that good.

Pours a deep cherrywood hue with a finger of beige foam that shows moderate retention and leaves behind a few legs of lacing on the walls of the glass.  Aroma is quite complex, showing a bouquet of spicy notes, dark, sweet maltiness, and cherry-and-plum fruitiness.  Body and mouthfeel seem light with a high effervescence. Dark, sweet malt notes show their presence up front, with toffee, chocolate, and prune notes, all being swept away as the bright spicy body takes center: pepper, ginger, clove, and anise meld with the distinct character of dark cherries and alcohol before moving into a spicy-sweet finish with a lingering malt-and-cherry fade. There's a lot going on, and a bit of age would probably help calm things down and bring forth a smoother, richer nature.

Aroma is very strong and sweet. Lot's of raisins, over-ripe fruit, roasted sweet malts, Belgian yeast, and booze. Flavor, at first was a little hidden by carbonation...but sweet none-the-less. As the beer warms, very complimenting sweet malts and dark dried fruits mixing with a slight warming booze. Somewhat complex and a very tasty quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,irishking1977,3.98,"Three Philosophers is an interesting blend of a Belgian quad and cherry lambic. I haven't had too many quads nor have I had too many lambics, but it seems the combination of the two might be interesting.  A: A deep amber/ebony with an immense head that leaves tons of lacing. This is a fine looking brew.  S: Malt and cherries with a hint of alcohol. No surprise; this one clocks in at a hefty 9.8% ABV.  T: Malt at the forefront along with mild cherries and other dark fruits. In addition, alcohol can be slightly detected, but hidden fairly well. On one hand that is good, since a heavy alcohol profile can detract from enjoying a beer (who really likes the taste of alcohol?) but it is quite sneaky.  M: Smooth, thick and creamy with good carbonation.  D: This one is somewhat complex, and also has a somewhat heavy feel to it. The malt and cherry aspects might wear a bit after two. I think I could drink a maximum of two of these before I would want to move on to something else. Nonetheless, a good and interesting brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Kallessin,4.77,"2008 Bottle (12oz):  Pours a deep hazy brown color with dark amber highlights. Has a somewhat smallish off-white head. A little sediment made it into the glass.  Has a fruity and spicy aroma with the cherries being the most prominent. Very malty and the alcohol is present along with some oakey/woody aromas.  Has a very rich, malty flavor with lots of cherries, with some molasses and brown sugar. The alcohol is not as prominent as the aroma would suggest and is very well hidden. This really has a fantastic flavor with the cherries pairing very well with the maltiness.  It's a lot lighter body then I expected, but it works very well. Smooth up front, followed by tingly carbonation. It has almost a juicy feel to it.  A really amazing beer. Very rich and flavorful. A perfect combination of cherries and full flavored malt. One of the those rare experiences with beer that makes you say wow when you taste it.  2009 Bottle (22oz):  This pours very similar to the 2008, but has much more of a head. A foamy cream color that stuck around for a short time.  It has much more grainy malt and sweet caramel in the aroma. The alcohol and the oakiness are still there, but the cherries are not as obvious.  The cherries are not as prominent in the flavor either. This flavor is much more fleeting. The malt is much more prevalent with some bready flavors and more bitterness.  It's a little more dry in the mouth, but otherwise it's much the same.  I happened to have both a 12oz bottle from 2008, which came in a mixed 12 pack and a 22oz bottle of 2009 from another gift pack that I received this Christmas (2009). I have to say the 2008 was much better. I'm thinking the extra year of aging much improved the flavor. My rating is based on the 2008 bottle, but both were great beers.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A bit more dry than expected, but still has great brown sugar and booze-soaked frui elements. Nice toasty malt, tons of herbal notes, and no real chemical alcohol bite. Very nice.  Not as full bodied as expected. Some decent carbonation lightens this one and makes it quite drinkable. Not as heavy, complex, or dense as other quads, but worth the try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,boatshoes,3.93,"Received a 2005 vintage from Brewfan in a recent BIF. Not my first experience with this beer, but it is my first experience with a four year old vintage. Interested to see what cellaring does to this one. Thanks!  Appearance- Pours a ruby brown with a huge three finger beige head rising off of a very mild pour. Lots of beading and great head retention, with about a quarter finger sticking around throughout the entire drink. A small amount of lace left on the side of the glass as well.  Smell- Smells of bread and caramel malt dominating. A bit of tart character and dark fruit remain in the background despite four years in the cellar. Reminiscent of chocolate covered cherries and dates.  Taste- Very malt forward with sweet malt and dark candy sugar up front on the palate. A strong breadiness is retained in the flavor profile for me as well, along with more sweet, dark fruits. Some minor tartness remains from the addition of the Lindemans Kriek, though in combination with the malt and having mellowed out in the cellar the cherry flavors come out more in the dark fruit profile. Very nice and mellow.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is great with excellent levels of carbonation, being both smooth and effervescent. Carbonation retained very well despite length of cellaring. Drinkability is a touch lowered given the sweetness of this one but still quite good for a quad.  Overall, a very good interpretation of a quadrupel. Also very reasonably priced for the style as well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Also getting a wee bit of bitterness from the hops on the back end.  M: Very smooth and weighty on the palate. This beer does not F around.

Banana-bubble gum wheatiness. And a nice booziness that isn't overpowering. Ends with a nice wheat-straw dryness. This is a nice complex taster.  M: Very nice medium feel.

42,3457,Pecorasc,3.87,"12oz capped bottle, dated 2009. Best looking of all the Ommegang artwork. Probably drank a bit too warm and poured too much yeast into the glass.  Pours with a great looking off-white, rocky head, but receedes down to a thin layer of dense foam, void of any head in the center. A deep ruby color with some chill haze that cleared up by the time I got around to drinking it. No visible carbonation.  All I can think about when smelling this is chocolate covered cherries. Tart cherries. It also may smell of cardboard a bit, tough to tell.  Fruity at the start. Then hits you with the alcohol and finishes oxidized. Very sweet. Leaves a sugary residue and a warming sensation.  Body is juicy, with just a tingle of carbonation.  Average drinkability for a 9.8%'er. The heat really makes this beer limited.

S - Smells great. Hints of cherry and spices and (alcohol which I like the smell of).  T - This is where I'm bowled over. A medley of spices with a touch of cherry and sweetness. There is a lot going on with the flavor of this beer. You can definitely taste that 9.8% ABV, but I'm a fan of that...especially the way it sits with the other flavors.  M - Really comes alive it your mouth and lights up your taste buds.  D - Although this is one of my favorite beers, the ABV content is a bit much to drink too much of it at one time. Typically a 750mL bottle does it just right for me.  Another fine offering from Brewery Ommegang. Have yet to find one of these that I don't love.

42,3457,brownbeer,4.1,"2007 vintage  I'm greeted with a rather violent popping of the cork, though it was in transit earlier today so that could have something to do with it.  Pours reddish-brown with a tan head that doesn't look promising but stays for the duration of the glass. Looks as good as a Rochefort or Chimay in my opinion.  Subtle, yet interesting nose. Woody cherry, fig, toffee, prune, and mellow alcohol.  A slap of wood on the front palate, faint sour cherries, rum-raisin, bread dough, a little perfumey, a cola note. A lot of individual flavors that distinguish themselves well.  Full bodied, a bit of a CO2 bite that I could live without.

A- Big eggshell white head from what perhaps was an overly rough pour into my Unibroue tulip. :- Theres lots of lacing as it slowly subsides. The beer is a totally clouded ruby/brown color. Similar color to many barleywines I've had.  S- Cherry, malt, caramel, alcohol and some other fruits. Again, its nice but pretty un-quad-like, but thats the goal here.  T- This was too cold at first, I let it warm and had to bump up the score here a notch.That said, I think this beer is better with more of a chill on it that regular quads (I like my trappist quads really close to room temp). Im getting cherry,spice, some oakiness and alcohol similar to cognac.  M- Low, fluffy carbonation, medium body, slightly dry finish. This is some what of a sticky beer.

Taste is very much what I expect from this style, fruity and sweet, with a pronounced Belgian candy sugar flavor. There is raisin there, and a decent amount of malt. There is a bit of alcohol warming at the end as well.  Feel is nice and solid, nothing wimpy about this one. Maybe a touch thinner than others of this style, but still nice.

Kriek lambic notes fuse with the hops and create a one of a kind finish and balance. Multifaceted layers of flavor including some belgian spice notes. Some alcohol in the finish gives a wine like quality that is gently pushed away by the cherries and lambic tartness. An earthy, clean dryness in the finish as well.

The retention is good and lasts about one finger throughout the entire drink. S= Cherries of course but theres a lot more than that. It really smells a lot like a chocolate covered cherry to me.... One of those ones you get around Easter time with the cream in the middle. There are a lot of apple notes in it as well with some dark fruit like plums and figs but they sit in the back seat to the nice Easter chocolate cherry smell. Almost perfumey smelling. T= Werid. again it tastes like one of those Easter cherries with the chocolate and cream. There are the same notes that I smelled but they take the back seat. I don't know if they used real cherries in this but it tastes like they used the candy cherries you find on top if ice cream sundaes. Really unique for a quad and delicious none the less. I love the taste but it isn't regual Quad flavors by any stretch of the imagination. The dark fruits take the back seat in this one and still play a roll in balancing out the sweet candy cherry flavors. When I burp up some I notice how much cherry there really is in this. Delicious and well balanced between a quad and fruit beer. M= Wet and coating. This one isn't a lick of dry. Instead it has a nice coating wet delicious feel. D= solid. well balanced and smooth. A good sipper with some nice strong cheese or a solid meal. This one is really a great quad but not a beginners quad at all.

42,3457,kkipple,3.98,"2007 vintage, reviewed at the back end of '09. 12oz bottle.  A. A rich and full, lacy and dense light brown head caps off this dingy, burgundy-brown beast. Pretty. Hmm, wasn't Dingy Brown Beast a Zappa album?  S. Arbitrator here mentioned ""Cherry Pepsi"" and he's not far off. The cherry here is more pronounced than I recall it being, and along with the alcohol heat gives it a cherry-brandy character. Further down, nuts, deeply singed sugars, toffee, and hints of cocoa swirl. Unusual, there is a sweetness present but it's complex and understated.  T. Either this has dried out a good bit in 2 years (likely) or the recipe has changed; either way this is a rewarding, if subtle and very-cherry beer. Big cherry notes up front, Robotussin, cherry Icee, that sort of thing. There's a meaty malt backbone that goes throughout, with chocolate and deep brown malt flavors popping out, evident alcohol (still), and a woodsy, dry-sweet flavor. It's warming and ultimately a bit soured by the cherry finish. The flavor is not particularly ""Belgian"", and lacks a certain memorable house character that the best Quads have, but this is still quite solid.  M / D. Fine, reserved carbonation, medium-full mouthfeel, finish is sour cherry and dry brown sugar booze. Rather enjoyable, I could have another 12 ounces of this...  Ultimately, I'm not sure that the aging helped this particular beer, but I quite clearly need to have it again fresh and compare. The not-quite real cherry seems much more prominent and the beer as a whole more dried out and a bit exhausted; that said, Three Philosophers is still on my short list of top American Quads.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Arbitrator,2.49,"Chilled 750mL bottle into a glass. 2008 vintage.  A: Pours a slightly murky amber / maroon body in my 1L Hofbrau mug. The first pour is literally more than half foam, with a fluffy 5-finger-thick cap enveloping most of the mug. It retains for over a minute, crackling and snapping all the while, leaving a few wispy trails of lacing in its wake.  S: Cherry up front, but in that artificial manner of Wild Cherry Pepsi; spices, toast, figs, and herbs.  T: Yup, definitely Wild Cherry Pepsi. Not a solid example of cherry flavor, but it's there, nonetheless. Caramel, brown sugar, rummy figs, light spices (cloves), chocolate. Cherries linger well into the aftertaste.  M: Medium-full body with a chewy feel to it. Slightly on the sticky side, with the seemingly artificial cherry giving it a syrupy aftertaste. Well-disguised ABV.  D: I kind of have mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand, it's a pretty solid mid-range quad. On the other hand, a few more bucks will get me a MUCH better beer. The heft of this body (and relatively affordable price) makes me want to use this for food pairing or cooking, but for plain ol' drinking, I think I'll stick with something else.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jamie2dope,4.32,"I was lucky enough to find a bottle of the cave aged version of this beer from 2006 at a local store where nobody seems to buy craft beer. Color is a dark ruby, and comes with a quick to fade white head. Nose is wonderfully fruity, with the cherries really shining. At the same time the booze comes in with some chocolate, caramel, and brandy notes, and really makes for a great smelling brew. Taste is really full of fruit and dark malt goodness. You can tell that the age on this beer has mellowed some of the flavors in a good way. Body is full, and although you can taste the alcohol, it is really tame, and in the end adds depth to the whole experience. This beer reminds me a little bit of Brandy Angel's Share from Lost Abbey. I could sip this beer all day every day. I have to admit that I rarely go for this beer; instead usually opting for Hennepin or Ommegang. I really wish they would release the cave aged beers more, as I think I can tell a difference. All in all this is a sensational brew that has multiple layers of complexity. I have had a lot of the to[p rated Quads out there, and this one still sits close to the top. Cheers",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,advill88,4.2,"Pours a dark reddish brown with a creamy 1/2 inch head. Strong lacing clings all the way down the glass while I'm drinking.  Mainly a delicate smell of cherries with a bit of yeast in the background.  Taste is pleasingly complex with the same interplay of yeastiness and cherry flavors joined by a light malt and a touch of bitterness at the back end. Medium mouthfeel with a touch of carbonation.  Quite a nice brew, and my first from Ommegang. I can't say I've ever had a quad with so many lambic elements, but it's a good uniqueness, and the fruit is prominent in the brew, without being saccharine, or overtaking all the other elements. Alcohol is well hidden too; it doesn't taste like a 9.8 ABV brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A good amount of lacing forms on the glass with each sip, but settles back into the glass as it waits for me to take another.  S: raisins, cherries, and brown sugar. Maple syrup, a bit of clove and alcohol as it warms.  T: tastes of raisins, cherries, and a bit of milk chocolate, with the cherry and brown sugar taking prominent roles as I make my way to the bottom of the glass. Just the right amount of warming alcohol presents itself with each subsequent sip.  M: full bodied, smooth and creamy, with a light finish. Leaves an oily, puckering feel on the sides of the cheeks. A good balance of sweet and sour that really has my mouth salivating for another sip. Carbonation feels just about right.  D: a quality after dinner beer. Right about now I'm wishing I'd sliced up some gouda and a few pieces of dark chocolate- good thing I have a couple more of these so I can try out that combination. I think I'll even cellar one of my remaining bottles and see how this tastes another year from now, though I should also probably grab a 2009 vintage to compare a fresh one to the 2008.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Dark dried fruits. Earthy hops. Very nice, but very dry.  Mouthfeel: Mediudm, almost full bodied, decent amount of carbonation, a little low. Very smooth and creamy, a little hot.

A: A deep, deep red/brown color; very clear, pouring with a good amount of head that quickly dies off. Nice lacing on the glass.  S: Rich and sweet, it reminds me of a tawny port. Raisin and prune notes.  T: A nice deep sweet taste, again, reminiscent of raisin and prune. The bottle mentions cherry/kriek, but I really can't notice it. A lot of ""heat"" from the alcohol is a little distracting, but such is the style of a quad. A nice touch of sour and bitterness.  M: Velvety smooth.

Smells of cherries, grapes, honey, and a little Belgian funk. Very complex.  Just as nice in the mouth. Lots of complex fruit and a little funk. I hate the fact that Belgians often have an underlying taste of onions to me, but I blame that on myself and not the beer.  In the mouth it has a ncie consistency, not too thick, not too thin. Great for the style.  This one is pretty damn drinkable. It was also my test bottle to see if I invest in the mini vertical I stumbled upon.

The aroma is of rum-soaked dark fruits, spicy Belgian yeast, brown sugar, and toffee.  The taste is again full of dark fruits like plum, raisin, figs, and cherry. There's also fruity/spicy yeast and rich malts reminiscent of caramelized sugar, toffee, and molasses. Hop bitterness is low resulting in a semi-sweet finish. Some rummy booziness lets you know this ale has plenty of strength.  Overall, a nice American attempt at Belgian Quad. It falls short of the classics like Westvleteren and Rochefort, and even Chimay Grande Reserve for that matter, but it's easy on the wallet and still delivers plenty of enjoyment. It's excellent paired with cured meats, homemade mozzarella cheese, and olives.  Note: At 2 years, the 2% cherry ale really begins to stand out. I should buy this more often.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Full bodied feel and taste: like a stronger version of the Abbey dubble, featuring moderately toasty malts and lots of yeast. Cherry comes through, of course, but never makes the flavor overtly cloying nor tart.  Mouthfeel is less bubbly than other Belgians but makes up for it with an oily, almost sticky coating.

Starts with a spicy nutmeg/cinnamon flavor which turns into a coco powder sprinkled cookie like flavor. This beer has a long and fingering mouthfeel. There is a chocolate covered cherry finish on it as well. Im very impressed with this beer and at a stunning 8 dollars and 49 cents a bottle its a hell of a deal.  M: Long and fantastic finish on this beer. It has a prickly beginning and a creamy finish... quite a feat!

42,3457,craftaholic,4.2,"Appearance: Poured from a magnum to a snifter. Has a very appealing copper brown that has a nice tinge of orange when held to light. The head is a nice 2 finger length that has a nice retention and leaves a soapy foam.  Smell: Has a nice candied fruit chocolatey malt that is somewhat bready but all together pleasing. There is a slight amount of esters and alcohol but it isn't overpowering.  Taste: The nose was a great precursor for this one, there is a great deal of sweet dried dark fruits. There is touches of each from some figs, plums and even raisins. The breadiness really is a backbone to this one its almost like a fruitcake of the aforementioned ingredients. The phenols are present and although it isn't very strong for an almost 10% abv it's fume-like qualities make themselves known. Theres nothing bitter in sight from hops to any lingering off aftertastes. Throughout its a great complex flavor thats rich and balanced and nothing seems out of place. The finish is a nice sweet cherry touch to round it out.  Mouthfeel: Has a moderate carbonation that tickles the throat with each sip but is also robust enough to be a bit 'chewy' basically a few steps down from a stout but incredibly smooth. It coats the mouth with a slickness and leaves your mouth wet as it waters for the next sip.  Drinkability: Can't taste the alcohol at all in this one, and with an exceptional 'ability to drink' it means you should be able to limit yourself because it won't warn you.  Overall: Never been disappointed from Ommegang and it makes me proud to be a new yorker and have them as a home state representation. Is a homerun hit in its belgian style representation and as a whole. Is quite delicious and really is an example of a perfected craft that makes craft beer what it's known for.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The head is impressive, it maintains a solid 1/8 inch foam surrounding throughout my duvel glassware.  S: A very light cherry tinge added to a ranging aroma of herbivorous goodness.  T: Absolutely wonderful as this beer overtakes the mouth, the first wave of flavors reach into the mouth with a very thick, medium carbonated, herbal back-drop of light sweet cherries that extenuates the malts of this beer. The alcohol is crash of this beer is the main weak-point. Once the beer reaches back into the throat a slight burn begins to overtake the amazing first wave. I love the taste of this beer, but I wish it was finished with a stronger flavor profile that extended the wonderful complexities of this brew.  M: Again the thickness and carbonation of this beer are fantastic. It is thick with a strong kick of medium carbonation that brings out the wonderful complexities of this brew(I just wished they hung-out on the palate). A great feel in the mouth.  D: Solid, this beer doesn't beg me to drink it nor does it deter my sip rate.  Overall this beer could be one of my all-time favorites if it was able to finish. The first wave of taste combined with the mouth-feel are absolutely fantastic, it just lacking a smooth finish.

This reminds me strongly of an English barleywine, but slightly more approachable. This would make a fantastic dessert beer.  Mouthfeel: thick but with nice carbonation; not quite syrupy but definitely going down that road.  Drinkability: this is a delicious beer, but definitely a sipper.

Also some fig or raisin in the nose.  T - Malt and dark fruits, the raisin or fig taste I smelled came through with an alcohol warmth that seemed to linger for a while in my throat. 9.8% ABV is not very well masked but this is still one tasty brew. The cherry taste was very minute to me, but as the brew warmed it seemed to become a little more pronounced.  M & D - Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with a medium to full body.

42,3457,Daniellobo,3.83,"A solid, relatively complex- if a bit too fizzy - US quad.  Presentation: 750 ml corked bottle. Classic iconic design with subdued old fashion fonts and classic aiming icons. Side displays serving notes, brewery references, and a brief brew description. Shows brewing date as 2009 on the neck label, and Alc. by Vol. (9.8) Poured into a snifter.  A - Amber brown - deep scarlet hue, with a large smooth head that shrinks softly to a stubborn cap and small touches of lacing.  S - Sweet malt with some fruitiness, it might be the noted cherries but it is not clear to my nose. A Belgium distinctive blend takes the last and persistent presence.  T - Malty sweetness with an interesting mix of fruitiness that comes like one package, not too subtle but is there in a straight forward form: figs? raisins? Maybe eve the cherries? Maybe, but in the most distant of notes.  M - Medium body and carbonation, although with the way it comes together it feels a bit fizzy and asking for more body, or flavor, or both... Pleasing but a bit soft for the style.  D - Goes down well but it is actually nothing that extraordinary and since it is a nicely crafted brew it requires no effort it also feels a bit dull the more one progresses.  Notes: Hmmm, this is a good approach to a great quad but for me it falls a bit short of the extraordinary. A bit too fizzy, and unfortunately in my palate the range of notes that would make it really memorable do not show up. Better than most US attempts at the style I´ve tried but still not reaching the source of original inspiration. On the other hand the type of quality offered by Ommegang at the range of prices compared to the imports is tremendous so they have a totally deserved spot in cellars across the US, and in that context I am sure I´ll be revisiting sometimes in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Definitely a high gravity beer, the alcohol hits you upon first sip. I can pick out raisons, and cherry (not sour more like the cherries were mulled). I would call this beer sweet AND savory  M-Very light but not thin  D- I could not see myself drinking more than one at a time.

Closer inspection reveals some diacetyls, faint hops and a note of distant caramel. Taste isn't quite as complex, but big and bold just the same with a graininess up front followed by ripened dark fruit (cherries and plums) some sour fruit, a welcomed hop hit, some sweet malts and spice.

The color was a deep, dark reddish. Very nice head that retained. My major qualm with this beer was the overwhelming taste of cherries. Maybe it was a psychological thing, but all I could taste every time I took a sip was cherries. However, that's not a fault in the beer - it's just personal preference.  The ABV was disguised nicely and it went down very easily.

Pours a rusty copper with almost no head, although this was slow-poured as per bottle indications. Coloration is nice.  S- Smells like a red wine. Deep, tangy and tart. Hmm.  T- Follows the nose. Tart, sweet, a bit dry, tangy, mildly puckering. Not what I expected, although still pretty good.  As I get about 1/2 way in, the tart cherries come out to play and this beer dances across my tongue. Not for the novice, this beer has several different levels of flavors that really beg to be combed through and catalog. I'll just call them tasty.  M- Crisp, full, thick, healthy carbonation considering, and no alcohol detected besides a residual warming. Very intense, very good.  D- A 750 went down easy. At 9.8%, you know that's a good beer.

There is lots of carbonation with a light tan head 2 fingers that lasts awhile with good lacing. When you swirl head comes back quickly and stays for a while again.  The aroma is sweet hints of raisins, chocolate, can really smell the malts.  The taste is a bit of a letdown, its ok, but drinking next to a R10 its quite lacking. There are notes of chocolate, with a little bitter end.  Has a nice mouthfeel, lasts several seconds. Decent drinkabiliyt.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,OldSchoolGamer,3.16,"Ommegang is easily one of the premier American-Belgian style brewers. I have had a few of their brews in the past, and was not too impressed. They were okay, but nothing to write home about. Here is my review of their Quad.  A: Pours a murky brownish red. Head fizzes away rather quickly. No lacing present.  S/T: Smells like a typical dark Belgian Ale. Dark fruits, spice and alcohol. Taste is actually a little too harsh for my taste. Not a smooth beer at all. Alcohol is quite prominant in the taste. There is also quite a bit of malt. Caramel and toffee. Cherry and cherry pits along with an oaky and woody character. A touch of banana in there as well. Flavors do not seem very well blended it is just a bit too unremarkable overall.  M/D: Medium bodied with a very fizzy and bubbly mouthfeel. Quite a bit of alcohol burn in the finish. Definetly a sipper. Too harsh to gulp.  I will admit, I am not the biggest Quad fan. But compared to others I have had, this one is pretty middle-of-the-road. Flavor needs more refinement and the alcohol presence needs to be more masked. Probably not one I would drink again. I recommend it if you are a big Belgian Quad fan. If not, then you might want to pass.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,kingcrowing,3.85,"12oz beer poured into a fancy glass.  Pours a dark brown with some reddish hues. Very little head. Smell is somewhat malty and a little sweet and slightly sour, you can notice the cherries.  Taste is very complex. Not very warming but a bit sharp from the alcohol. The taste is sour and a bit sweet from the cherries, but not too harsh, very good for someone trying to get into sours. There are also some oaky and woody notes to it, reminds me of Bourbon.Nice amount of carbonation. For a Quad, this is really drinkable and quite smooth for such a complex beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,r0nyn,3.61,"Poured into a snifter from a bottle.  A hazy, mellow reddish liquid filled the glass as I poured it. It looks rather pretty, especially when held up to the light. There's a large-ish head that bubbles up as the glass is filled, then slowly dissipates into a paper-thin layer floating at the top. The smell is definitely alcoholic, with subtle nuances of berries wafting through as well.  Has a tangy, tart bite that masks the alcohol at first, but then the 9.8% asserts itself. It's not overpowering by any means, but definitely evident. The finish has some of that alcoholic taste, along with some of the berries from the smell. Mouthfeel is decent, has a medium body which, combined with the alcohol content, definitely makes it a sipper.  Overall, a good beer. Perhaps a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but quite drinkable all the same.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Overlord,3.11,"Decided to re-try a few of these Ommegang brews and put in some reviews.  Pours a hazy/cloudy brown with ruddy hues when held to light. Gigantic billowing off-white foam head.  Smells like fruit laden yeasty bread, surprising amount of cherry, and some spice.  Flavor adds add in Belgian candi, a strange astringent ... yeasty spiciness. A bit watery and thin, but some bubbling carbonation. I don't know. It's basically a sweet Belgian dark ale with a bit of puckery cherry to it. Just too astringent, yet cloyingly spicy sweet at same time.  As you work through the bottle (Even a 12 oz.er), it gets wearisome.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,badesign,4.07,"Pours the dark reddish-brown of dried blood with garnet highlights. Aroma is very strong and consists of big brown sugar and molasses notes, cherries, of course, and sticky dark fruits, namely raisin and fig.  In tasting this beer I started with it far too cold; don't make the same mistake! Don't bother taking a sip till it warms to maybe 55-60 degrees or more; it doesn't taste very good, and frankly doesn't taste like much of anything. When the temperature comes around, the flavor is of hard candy with lightly medicinal cherry notes, lemon and white bread. There is some alcohol, especially in the strong, lingering aftertaste, but not much associated warming sensation.  The carbonation is tight and effervescent, very pleasing. Drinkability is great insfar as you'll enjoy the beer so much that you'll wish you had more, but the alcohol will catch up eventually.  A truly great beer that represents a compromise between tradition and innovation and pulls it off with aplomb. I only got one to try but would buy it again in a heartbeat.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,mjaskula,4.49,"12 oz. bottle served in a large wine glass. Pours a dark amber brown with a thin tan head. I don't think I poured it as vigorously as i should have, the head was thin and there was no lacing. Otherwise looks great.  The aroma from this beer is excellent, sweet dark fruits, cherries, spices and alcohol. The flavor doesn't disappoint either, more sweetness, full of raisin and cherries, a tiny bit of hop bitterness and some alcohol warmth. Carbonation is perfect and mouth feel is clean and dry.  This is easily one of my favorite beers.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,alcstradamus,3.55,"Bottle pours a rich amber/copper color with less than a half finger of head. Smell is rich caramel malt and huge spice notes, hints of raisin and chocolate, stinging alcohol, and some floral hop notes.  Taste up front is overripe dark fruit with a splash of spices washing it down. Reminds me quite a bit of a less-boozy version of Rochefort 10....which means I ""sort of"" like it. There is a lot of flavor here, but it is not a flavor that is particularly appealing to me.  Drinkability suffers because after a while the flavor begins to get boring and it becomes a task to finish the bottle. Not a bad quad by any stretch of the imagination, but not one that I will be seeking again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,woosterbill,3.85,"750ml corked and caged, 2009 vintage, into a Duvel tulip.  A: Deep, dark, translucent ruby body with lively, fine carbonation from the bottom of the tulip (thanks, Duvel, for the etched ""D""); big, foamy, off-white head slowly dissipates into a cap, leaving lots of lacing. Great-looking brew.  S: Staying strong. Ripe cherries dominate the nose, backed up by sweet dark fruits (raisins, for the most part - maybe some prunes as well). Hugely malty and fruity, with just a faint whiff of yeast.  T: Starts out as a straightforward continuation of the smell: rich, sweet, fruity malts, with cherries predominant. Tastes great. Unfortunately, upon the finish the flavors devolve from rich and mellow to harsh and cloying - a strongly bitter, astringent cherry aftertaste keeps this from being a truly top-notch quad. Perhaps some age would help mellow this out, but for now this beer fails to follow through on the potential of its aroma and initial flavors.  M: A little thinner than I expected, but nice and smooth with abundant, fine carbonation.  D: I'm doing fine finishing off the 750 by myself, but the harsh aftertaste keeps me from wanting to quaff this intense brew.  Notes: I was really looking forward to trying this, and I'm very glad I did - yet another strong offering from Ommegang. I wish they would offer this beer without the 2% Kriek portion - the rich malts and alcohol of the quad base were blowing me away, but the bitter astringency of the lambic left me disappointed. Still, an extremely tasty beer, and at least a couple bucks cheaper than any Belgian quad - although, having had both recently, I'd gladly pay the extra 2.50 to get St. Bernardus Abt 12.  Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Casey10,4.33,Thought this would be a good one for my 80th review.  A - brown hazy copper color small lingering head.  S - light smell of cherry  T - cherries with slight fig a bit acidic.

42,3457,alkemy,4.5,"2009 bottle Poured deep, dark coppery brown with a slight red hint around the edges of the glass. The thick head was a bit fleeting, but laced my glass nicely. Spicy Belgian yeast smell with sour cherries in the background. Nice alcohol and cherry flavor at first, then you get the bready sweet malts. Damn, this stuff is good! Very drinkable despite the ABV. Luckily, I only had one 750, because if more was at my disposal it would have been downed as well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Vonerichs,4.12,"Poured into a tulip with a one finger head, no lacing to be seen. Copper color.  The smell is vinous with a berry esther. The malts are of the dark fruit variety. There's no problem picking up any scent. It's very robust and pronounced.  This is a very distinct tasting quad. The esthers come through as a mix of berries and black cherries. The finish is medicinal and has a numbing effect.  Mouthfeel is slightly tannic and bitter, leaving a very dry feeling on the palate. By then end of this 750ml I was in dire need of a glass of water, but that was expected.  Definitely a sipper, but no problem finishing a bottle solo. Very tastey with a complex variety of dark fruits.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Head was a tall frothy tan mass with good retention and lacing.  S: Molasses, dried cherries, and black currants compliment the rich caramel and roasted malt aroma. Hops come through only slightly as a spicy pepper aroma. Fruity yeast and fusel alcohol are present too.  T: Sweet nuttiness, caramel and slightly burnt sugar fill the malt profile. Dried cherries are a wonderful compliment to the rich malts. Yeast ads a bit more fruity esters.  M: Smooth medium body with some alcohol warmth. Carbonation tight.  D: A sipper but a lovely flavorful beer to experience. I would definitely have this one again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,majesticsock,5,"The beer has a red & brown tint to it. Pours with a medium head that looks great and incredibly rich.  The smell on this is amazing. Smells like a true Belgian ale with a hint of cherry.  Has a sweet and a bit heavy taste. Difficult to taste the 9.8% alcohol, but I can definitely feel it.  Mouthfeel was a bit thicker than I expected and foams up quick when swooshing around, but has a nice soft texture to it.  Drinkability is exceptional. I could easily stick with this the whole night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,goblue3509,3,"Pours a dark amber brownish color with a little one finger head that gave way to some lacing. The smell is of black cherries and sweet roasted malts. The taste is a strong malt backbone with black cherries overriding the malt at the tail end. There is also an alcohol taste from middle to end, there is a good deal of bitterness that starts at the beginning and is present throughout. The mouthfeel is a little slick and oily, with a low to moderate carbonation, not as high as i would have thought.

42,3457,Natural510,4.31,"2008 bottling. Pours a medium mahogany-brown with immense head which slowly dissipates; eventually a 2mm layer is left which remains to the end and helps coat the glass nicely. Nose is malty with brown sugar/molasses and hints of dark fruit. Malted sweetness in flavor as well, with a high yeast character. The added kriek is very subdued, merely another player in the overall flavor. A nice raisin/fig note kicks around along with the cherry fruitiness. Body is full, creamy and smooth in the mouth. Perhaps not the most traditional of the ""quads"", this is still a nice offering on its own. The elements meld well together and this makes for an excellent after-dinner drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,SaucyA,4.07,"2008.  A - Sniftered. Pours a deep, apple-cider brown with a creamy 1 finger off-white head. Little lacing. Lots of floaties on a relatively careful pour.  S - Very interesting nose, and completely unique, which I love. A definite malty quad vibe, with layers of sour complexity. The cherries peek out in the nose more as it warms, but never really take an extreme forefront. Yeasty, sweet, sour, slight herbal notes... runs the gamut. Mouth is definitely watering. Surprisingly little booze.  T - Again, incredibly unique. Relatively sweet as opposed to sour, the cherries add a nice little twist to the quad base. While neither aspect detracts from the other, I think I prefer my quads without fruit. Plums, booze on the back, toasty malts, notes of black cherries. All in all a really solid beer, just not necessarily my favorite combination of tastes. I really wish the aftertaste lingered longer.  M - Creamy, even carbonation and on the lighter side of medium-bodied. I think if it were a little less attenuated, it'd stick to my palate more.  D - Quite drinkable despite my lack of enthusiasm for this brew. While it's not exactly my cup of tea (or bottle of brew), it's well-made and easy to drink... so I can't dock points.  Notes: I'm probably gonna revisit this yearly, and try to get an older bottle... just to see. I'm not the hugest fan, but it's still a nice beer all around.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,melagnus,4.2,"A - Three wise men (1. two finger-thick sudsy off-white head that sparkles in the sunlight, 2. Ruby Brown hue [SRM 24] with murky (turbid mashing?) look, 3. carbonic activity medium-high). The beer settles down to a fine film after a good minute; amazing head retention! Lacing on the glass forms, as the lactic cherry glues itself to the side of the snifter.  S - Purely intoxicating! A yeasty (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Acetobacteria, or all three?!?) smell rises with mixes of acidic cherries into the nasal canals. An undertone of sweet booziness makes it way through, but at 9.8% ABV this is to be expected; it is a Quad after all!!  T - Unbelievable complexity! Sourness coming most likely from the Pediococcus yeast, slight earthiness in the finish from probably the Brettanomyces, which creates a drier finish. Slight acidity from the Lactobacillus, with that blend of sweet cherry. The body comes through as medium on the palate with a slight syrupiness to it. The alcohol definitely hits the head in a soothing way, though it just adds to the incredible nature of this beer. Lastly, a spiciness via the hops tickles the palate and leaves a slight lasting impression, but only through licking the chops does one re-experience this! Overall, a nice clean, dry finish with little aftertaste.  D/C - Drinkability is a tossup. On one end the mind quickly alters to another realm with the high toxicity of this brew and yet on another end the palate is left with a feeling of not only desiring more, but being able to handle more. Polishing off a 750ml bottle of this brew would be possible, though after just 354ml of the stuff I question the logic in proceeding forth. Knowing how amazing their Cave-Aged Abbey Ale is, I feel as though I truly missed out on the cave-aged variant of this beer.

Flavor is similar to aroma, quite sweet with a sugary, candy-ish presence. Some dark fruit and a hint of Belgian spice but mostly a malty, sweet affair. No hop bitterness at all (but why would you expect any?). Mouth is full-bodied and pleasant. Crisp carbonation. Not too heavy really.. If you're into sweetness its very good, I could see it being a bit much for some but even with the higher abv I could easily drink more than one in a sitting.

The back end the alcohol hits you, but it isn't uncomfortable.  M- Good level of carbonation and medium bodied.  D- This certainly isn't a beer that you are going to drink quickly, but that is the beauty of it. This is great for a dessert when you want to wind down the night rather than start it up.

42,3457,jnezda,4.35,This is one of my favorite Belgian styles beers. Perhaps because it is an American beer it is priced below the import Belgians and over the past year I have enjoyed a number of bottles of this brew. At home I drink this beer in my favorite snifter since that glass opens the smell nicely bringing out the fruit tones and earthiness of the beer. The color is a dark caramel with a white head that pours nicely from the bottle. The head does tend to fade quickly with no lacing which leads the drinker to think there will be no body but the mouth feel is big and full while not being over powering. This is a drinkable beer great to enjoy with a number of foods. I have paired this with grilled chicken and fish and vegetables with great success.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Strong boubon smell! Honey with bubblegummy yeast.  T - What a balance! Bitter leaves, maple at the start, bourbon and honey in the middle, finished with a dry cidery taste but the boubon chases it down.  MF - thick, substantial, and moderately fizzy. Less carbonation than I'd have expected but what I'd have prefered - so a happy surprise.  D - Easy to drink for the type. It does sit heavy in the stomach. A great beer for sipping at a fire, having philosophical thoughts - much like wine in that regard.  I typically like a more traditional Belgian dark or abbey, bit this was a pretty cool switch-up!

It was reddish brown colour (maybe it was the dim lighting in the beerhall) with a thin head. The mouthfeel was pleasant. As for the taste, it also reminded me of a chocolatey, cognac-y concoction.

Taste is a full bodied elixir of complex black patent, chocolate, cara malts and dark fruit. Cherry lambic in the finish very complex and gratifying  More over it is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand, and what those things are.

42,3457,ricke,3.98,"2008 vintage.  A: Dark reddish brown, almost more red than brown actually. Slightly hazy. A very big yellowish head fizzes away rather quickly but leaves stylish lacings.  S: An interesting smell that's kind of hard to pinpoint. Plenty of malts, dark bread yeast and prominent notes of berries. Quite a lot of chocolate as well, herbs and grass. After a while an unusual smell of roasted and tart aromas develops. This is really a complex smell with a wide range of different components. It's slightly edgy and perhaps it doesn't make it all the way, but it's still pleasant and interesting.  T: A nice character of sweet Belgian style dark ale in the fore, with the typical mix of powerful malts and vinous notes of cherries and other dark berries and spicy and herbal yeast. Some caramelized sugar, chocolate and grass. Faint notes of bubblegum and soft candy. In the middle, a gentle tartness develops (might this be the kriek lurking in the shadows?). The finish is slightly bitter with notes of coffee, iron and stale bread, perhaps even some hop notes. The alcohol is noticeable in a not entirely integrated way.  M: The body is not as big as I think I would have wanted it to be, and the lack of body results in the flavors coming out as a bit thin as well. The finish is slightly dry, whilst the mouthfeel is smooth.  D: An impressive tasty and complex beer which I enjoyed quite a bit.

This one looked as though it headed in the same direction at first, reddish hued pour and a medium white to tan head. spicy scent, burnt sugar.  The taste was unexpected. at first more inclined to a red ale type...quite sweet, maybe l¡ke a goudeband, but then a strong alcohol feel brought me back to the quad style. very strong bodied and piercing alcohol-roasted malt blend. palatable throughout, but not an easy one to chug down after a few.

42,3457,PDXHops,3.64,"Updated notes- 2004 vintage 12 oz bottle courtesy of pieper, consumed 6/15/10: * Appearance largely the same with the addition of some floaties. * Aromas now include sherry, raisin and a bit of vanilla. Still smells pretty fresh, yet more complex. Heavy dark brown sugar sweetness. * Flavor profile includes a bit of oxidation, but it's not overpowering or out of place. The tart cherry has turned into more of a cherry pie flavor, and there's a plentiful cola sweetness that dominates to a distracting level, although there's plenty of spice and fruit notes to sort out. * Mouthfeel still includes a healthy level of fine-bubbled carbonation. The cherry pie morphs into a lingering figgy flavor at the finish. A bit of warming alcohol in the swallow.  Overall impression: Not as complex as I'd hoped for, as the sweetness proves to be a bit much to overcome. Still an easy recommendation, though, as it seems to be holding up well.  2007 vintage, 750 ml bottle poured into a Chimay chalice.  The cork bursts from the bottle with a loud pop. Even without that hint, carbonation is obviously vigorous, as this beer fluffs up to a 2+ finger head, even with a gentle pour. Oddly enough, the head settles down pretty quickly and minimal lacing is left. The body is murky mahogany.  Smells plenty boozy with loads of sweet maltiness, dark fruit and cherries.  In the mouth, a pleasantly tart cherry bite quickly immediately asserts itself, but quickly shares the spotlight with plentiful sweet dark malt, toffee and molasses. A bit of cloves and some other vague spiciness. It's sweet, bready and yeasty, but the constant cherry tanginess keeps it (barely) from becoming too sticky sweet.  As noted before, this brew has very active carbonation, even after 2 years in the bottle. Mouthfeel's pretty good- doesn't linger as long as I figured it would.  Overall impression: A definite candidate for extended aging, as it seems to just now be hitting it's stride. Good beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,MADhombrewer,3.96,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip.  A- Deep reddish-brown color with a very big, off white head.  S- The overall aroma is not very big. I smell alcohol first then caramel and toffee flavors.  T- The alcohol is not as apparent in the smell as it is in the taste. This is very sweet. I can taste the caramel more than I could smell it. I also taste the toffee. When I lick my lips they are sweet and sticky.  M- I enjoyed the mouthfeel. Very good, very balanced.  D- After drinking a whole bottle by myself, and it being 9.8%, I am surprised I would like to have a little more.  I am just starting to find my way through the Belgian forest. I think I found a clearing to sit and enjoy the scenery. I will have to try Ommegangs other offerings.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Reagan1984,4.18,"2008 Vintage. Bought at the brewery last August and cellared properly since then.  Pours with a robust tan head that is lively and has great substance. Deep amber color with mahogany tones that has excellent clarity. If you look deep into the beer you can see some active carbonation that is very tiny. The head has great retention, however leaves no lacing.  Aroma smells like black cherry soda to me. In a very good way. One of my favorite flavors growing up. A slight bit of alcohol in the nose and a touch of yeast.  Wow, very smooth flavor. Fairly deep and inviting. Initial fruit, some malty, then some earthy tones. After this a moment of tart cherry then a slightly bitter finish. The finish is not like a fresh hop flavor in IPA's, but deeper and it mingles nicely with the moment of tart. ABV is almost non-detectable in the flavor. As it warms more layers of malt come through and just add to the complexity.  The mouth feel is velvet like and smooth. The carbonation is very subdued.  Goes down very smoothly, especially for a 9.8% quad.  I enjoy this. And will look to age some more. Another nice beer from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bbeane,4.57,A- Poured into a 16oz pint glass... Dark red/brown in color. Not a very large head... but does leave a nice lacing behind.  S- Smells very fruity on top of the sweet malt/caramel smell  T- Very sweet malt taste... caramel accompanies the fruity overtones. Very little detection of the high abv  M- Smooth with little carbonation... leaves a lingering sweet taste that clings mouth  D- Delicious. Definately would appreciate a few more of these... could definately get me in trouble  CHEERS,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,markaberrant,4.4,"A - very deep red, clear, tan head, very frothy to start, then stabilizes into thick cream, and eventually settles. Does not leave much lacing, just a bit of froth from where I sip.  S - tantalizing aroma, definitely pick up the cherry, not a lot of other ""dark"" fruits, but still very fruity, clove spice  T - tart cherries, rich maltiness, whisps of smooth chocolate, delicious spicy aftertaste lingers with more chocolate notes, full of layers and depth  M - soft and smooth on the palette, med high carbonation, alcohol is very well hidden, though there is a gentle warmth, overall mouthful really aids in the drinkability  D - ridiculously drinkable, downright dangerous given the abv, smoothness and complexity  I tried their Abbey dubbel 2 years ago and loved it. Recently tried the Hennepin, and didn't care for the huge banana profile. I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, especially considering I hate the kriek they use in this beer for blending.  Well, this is definitely the best Ommegang I've tasted yet. The cherry character is just fantastic, though not really typical of a quad, but who's complaining? Then you've got some lovely spice notes and that hint of chocolate that is oh so appealing in dark belgians when done right (I have been personally searching for this in my homebrewed attempts). And then the mouthfeel really adds to the overall character of the beer, they just nailed it absolutely perfect. Wow.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ecoastman,4.16,"Thanks again to JZED for bringing this great one back from Boston.  Drinkability - great stuff. I could easily have another and will pour the rest of the bottle into my chalice as soon as I hit ""review"" on this submission. Of course, the high alcohol limits the intake volume. I hope I can find this stuff in my region.  Appearance - A nice deep cherry red that looks great on the edges of the glass. The fine carbonation gives a thin head with decent retention.  Smell - Very mildly sweet and fruity. Almost difficult to detect. Surprising considering the high alcohol.  Taste - a very smooth tasting beer with a pleasant cherry tone that is not overpowering. There's a lot of flavour compared to what I expected from the mild aroma - some dark fruits to start in the malt. The sweetness isn't overdone and the finishing bitterness is low. Like a good Belgian Quad, the alcohol content is well hidden. They've done a great job on this style and it's well balanced. The flavour lingers nicely for a long time on the palate.  Mouthfeel - the medium body is quite smooth and creamy with the low, fine carbonation and is not too course in the finish for a high octane beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Is sweet and malty, and the alcohol comes to the front. Caramel is the dominant flavor. Full bodied with a lot of carbonation. Decent drinkability, but the alcohol taste is not well disguised, and is a reminder that this is not a session beer.  This is the 2nd beer I have reviewed from Brewery Ommegang, and I have been impressed so far. I can't wait to review another offering from them.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,WolfmanK,4.92,"Three Philosophers is a blended brew. It is 98% a Belgian style abbey ale but kick ass strong. Considered a Quadruple in their measuring standards it boasts a huge 9.8% ABV. The other 2% is a Cherry Iambic. What you end up with is a very smooth highly drinkable, and decadent brew.  The Cherries do not overpower the beer at all, but enhance and blend with the natural fruit like flavor of the abbey ale. Although the alcohol content is very high you do not get a strong ""booze"" or alcohol after taste like Rob and I have found in some of these very high ABV beers. (Yes Brooklyn, I am looking at you...)  The complexity and flavors remind me a bit of port wine, and no doubt this would make a great after dinner beer or a good compliment to a dinner with strong flavors, but I would not reserve it just for that. I would not call it a light beer by any means, and I would probably not reach for it on a hot day, but... I'd also say this is drinkable year round.  All in all it may be the best craft brew I have ever had. I love this beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,sirdrinkwell,4.83,"This is the one that started it all for me...i went into the store looking for something else, but was intrigued enough to purchase this upon not finding what i initially went to get. i have recently taken a break from the Three Philosophers, but now that I have a new bottle in the house I will take this opportunity to post my thoughts on the subject...  Appearance: served from a corked and caged bottle, Three Philosophers pours an attractive dark autumn copper with a fair amount of light tine head, slowly fading to a slight ring and nice lacing.  Smell: The cherries are evident up front, along with a slight almost wine-like cabernet scent on the back end.  Taste: Rich and sweet, the cherries are evident on the tongue but they far from overpower the taste, which is balanced by a medium flavored and relatively subtle announcement of alcohol (given the 9.8% content, i would have figured a more pronounced alcohol taste)  Mouthfeel: this is a very pleasant, subtle brew; sweet and smooth on the palate.  Drinkability: This is a wonderful drink, perfect in its 25oz. serving size; this is a great sipper for a relaxing weekend afternoon or dinner/after-dinner compliment.  As previously mentioned, this is the drink that piqued my interest in the style in particular and the craft in general. This brew from Ommegand has my highest praise.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,rapidsequence,4.2,"Another nice corked and caged 750 from Ommegang.  Appearance: Dark amber red with a thick head that lasts. Some nice lacing.  Smell: Belgian yeast and sharp spicy smell that almost burns. Dark fruit and lots of cherry.  Taste: Thankfully much less cherry than I smell. I only really notice some cherry sourness on the back end. Good spicy dark fruit taste and lots of heavy breadiness.  Mouthfeel: Its nice and heavy, but with lots of tingly carbonation that keeps it from being too syrupy. You get a little creamy head with each sip which is nice.  Drinkablility: I've put off trying this for a long time because I don't think I like lambics. I'm not sure why they blend this, because I think it would be great without the cherry notes. That being said, its delicious as is. Its not cheap though-- cost me $8.50, and I'd rather have a $6 11.2 oz Abt 12. Its a nice change of pace though, and I'll have it again I'm sure.

Taste is a little sweet at first on my tongue, but then turns sour after it has been in my mouth for a few seconds. Nice tart, sour cherry flavor throughout. I get a nice warmth in my belly a few minutes after swallowing. As it warms the hops start to come through as well.  It is not the strongest quad that I have ever had, but the kreik lambic brings it home nicely.  I really enjoy this beer.

42,3457,MLasoski,4.23,"Presented: 25oz bottle, poured into an ale glass.  A: The body has a shadowy, cherrywood color. The pour allowed for a frothy, two-finger thick head to form. Looks like a wine mixed with beer to be completely straightforward.  S: Has a cherry and ale aroma that arises softly from the body.  T: As I read a couple reviews, some users stated that this brew has a hint of cabernet. I couldn't agree more. It's not a complex beer, but it is well balanced between a cherry, wine, and ale flavor.  M: The ale flavor flows through at the start, but is quickly complemented by the cherries that were added. The aftertaste reminds me of a carbonated church wine (typically sherry). It's not a bad thing, I actually enjoy it.  D: This is my first quadrupel and I must say that I am not dissappointed.

It was too light and airy for a 10% belgian though. Unlike other reviewers i didn't find it very complex and thus far this is my least favorite offering from Ommegang.

The head was light and fluffy, showing a tint of red, that stuck around. The beer maintained a great level of lacing throughout the drink.  The aroma was herbal with some smells of spice and dark fruit. It tasted of dark fruits which was a great mix. I did not taste or smell an cheery, which the label said was added. The medium body maintained its mild level of carbonation and flowed very smoothly.  This beer was delicious.

42,3457,HalfFull,3.38,"Poured from a corked 750 ml. bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a clear light mahogany, more red than brown, with a half inch of slightly off white head. Retention is brief, surrendering to a surface ring within a couple minutes, and lacing is light as a result.  Sweet malts on the nose and a touch of yeast. Cherry and raisin notes are dominant but not overwhelming, with some more dried sweet fruits in play as well as some alcohol at times. The yeast is subtle and not very complex, and in fact a good swirl with one third of a glass re-ups the malt structure but doesn't yield much of a yeast nose.  A light carbonation on the tongue delivers a light peppery clove spice. Dark cherry with a bit of tartness and just a hint of chocolate on the close. Moderate depth as the finish lingers briefly but yet not as long as others.  Overall this is a decent brew yet an average stab at a good Quad. Nothing detracts from this brew, it's smooth, has a good feel and drinks easily for its heft. At the same time, it's not too exciting either. Preferred over their Dubbel Abbey Ale due to slightly more complexity, yet somewhat lacking..  Too much raisin a la Lost Abbey and not enough yeast esters. Too sweet in the end.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

If you had to choose between port wine or three philosophers for dessert go with the three philosophers.  To be honest not my style of beer but i gave it a 4.5 cuz it gave me a slight buzz and no other dessert that tastes like cherry cream pie can do that  Also, this beer is the 2009 version.

I would still go with the rustic for the taste.  Mouthfeel: delicately carbonated, a nice alcoholic warmth till the end. Surprising because its not all that high in ABV.  Drinkability: defiantly a sipping beer. You have to take your time with this one. I really should of tried some food pairings with this one.

42,3457,BrewsCrewSA,4.78,"Exceptional. I picked this one up after having tried Ommegang's Abbey Ale a few weeks ago. And being a fan of krieks and cherry-based beers, I couldn't resist the curiosity of just what ""2% ale with cherries added"" meant.  A - Poured out of a 750ml capped and corked bottle into my Delirium Tremens snifter. Shades of ruby, blood and garnet, holding up to the light, it turned solid red with a layer of orange on top. Minimal head retention, but great lacing throughout.  S - Smells of a true Belgian. Tart, fruity banana aroma that's typical of the style/origin. Appetizing, sweet, it smacks of great taste and better things to come.  T - Carbonation first crashes against the palate, but is almost immediately overwhelmed by a big, fat, alcoholic cherry. I love that effect! Tart notes of alcohol come first, but are instantly settled by tones of cherry, biscuit malts. Again, exceptional. Alcohol on the high notes, sugary complex cherry in the middle, biscuits and undertones of toast on the bottom. Imagine crushing a soothing brandy-soaked cherry between your tongue and upper palate.  M + D - Alcohol settled quickly along my tastebuds, it's still a Quadrupel so I'm not knocking it. Wonderful drinkability for this style.  One of the best beers I've ever tried.

42,3457,biegaman,4.25,"2008 Vintage.  Three Philosophers has the very same rustic tone of falu red that adorns the fences, barns and summerhouses along the Swedish countryside. The beer is also touched with the pinkish blush of English country garden rose hips. Alas, the beer is topped with a frothy bounty of never ceasing head and the most prototypical of Belgian lace.  Belgian Quad and Belgian Kriek seemed unlikely bedfellows, at least until first whiff. The spicy, sugary sweetness of the quad is underlined by the tart, juicy fruitiness of the cherries. It takes many a big sniffs to even begin to plumb the depths of this layered, multi-faceted bouquet. It is magnificent and tireless.  Each mouthful is a bustling marketplace of tastes and textures. The beer is sweet but also lightly tart. Its flavour is comprised of black cherries and an assortment of other dark fruits and berries including plum, raisin and, notably, currants.  If you wanted to pair your port-like notes of brandied raisins and juicy currants with something a little heartier and more decadent, Ommegang has you covered. The sweet malty base provides more than enough chewy chocolaty caramel to elate anyone's sweet tooth. A clove-like spiciness floats to the surface with warmth.  Time will likely invoke an eternal dance between all of the beer's different elements. I'm unsure what to expect from aging, at any stage. Will the fruitiness fade? Will the intensity of flavour increase or decrease? It will be wonderful to see what combinations emerge from its time spent in the cellar; the best may be yet to come.  I'll conclude my thoughts on the Three Philosophers Quad with a rather philosophical question: Is brewing beer a craft or an art? That is to ask, does it involve skill or artistic impression? I think it is the latter that shows the most. That said, if this beer is any indication, the answer is that it inevitably involves a great deal of both.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,mwilbur,4.63,"Decided to finally pop open my 2004 (after about 5 yrs cellaring). Poured from 750 mL corked and caged bottle into my Three Philosophers chalice. A: Pours a very dark and very cloudy burnt orange with 1 inch tan head. Some sediment in the bottom of the glass. Very little light comes through with backlighting. A very nice looking brew! S: Cherry, malt, hint of belgian spice, and maybe a bit of black pepper. T: The first thing that comes to mind is fine port. This has aged very well. Softened and deepened in taste and texture. Mild and soft cherry and sweet malt. Background backbone of caramel malt. M: Very soft and smooth. Matures a bit, but wish it did more. Very nice lingering aftertaste. D: Highly drinkable, especially for style. One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries. At times I wish it had a bit more (strength, complexity, depth), but then I take another sip and savor the goodness. I am pleasantly surprised by how well this one ages. I would definitely let another one of these go 5 yrs or more. In fact I would highly recommend it.  5/19/15: 2007 vintage Poured from 750 mL bottle into snifter. A: Pours a dark cola brown with hint of red-amber around the edges with backlighting. Thin 1/4 inch light tan head quickly recedes. (4) S: Cherries, raisins, bready yeast, and chewy caramel malt. (4) T: Cherries and raisins up front followed by bready yeast and chewy caramel malt. It seems this has lost a step...perhaps 8 years is a bit long for this one. (4) M: Medium body. Soft and sweet with just a hint of tart cherry bite still left. Lingers and matures nicely on the palate. (4.25) D: Still an awfully good brew even at 8 years out. Still hanging in there well, but definitely starting to wane. (4)  11/27/16: 2012 vintage Poured from 750 mL bottle into Three Philosophers glass. A: Pours a dark, murky brown hue (more brown/yellow/amber at the edges with backlighting) with 1 inch light tan head with decent retention...eventually settling to a thin skim. (4.5) S: Cherry and sweet malt, bourbon, dark dried fruit (raisin and fig), mild molasses, and a hint of honey (4.25) T: Cherries hit first (and still fairly fresh tasting) followed by sweet malt, dark dried fruit (raisin and fig), vanilla, and honey notes. With warming, the chewy Belgian yeast becomes more apparent. (4.5) M: Medium body (drinks lighter than the 9.8% ABV would suggest). Fruit sweetness with a soft malt feel. Lingers and matures nicely on the palate too (the nice cherry note continues strong into the finish). (4.5) D: I love coming back to this one from time to time and trying different vintages at different cellaring times. This is still drinking quite fresh at 4 years out. (4.5)  11/6/17: 2016 vintage. Poured from 750 mL bottle into snifter. Best by 5/2021. A: Pours a clear ruby amber hue with 1-2 inch light tan frothy head with good retention. Fairly high carbonation continues to fuel the head. (4.5) S: Cherries, Belgian yeast, candi sugar, raisins, cinnamon, sweet caramel malt, and a hint of honey. (4.5) T: Cherries again hit first, quickly followed by Belgian yeast, sweet caramel malt, cinnamon, raisins, honey, and a hint of vanilla. (4.5) M: Medium-heavy feel. Dark fruit sweetness. ABV is extremely well hidden. Lingers and matures beautifully on the palate with a nice lingering cherry note. (4.5) D: Still drinking super fresh. A personal favorite. Love this one. A very easily accessible quad. (4.5)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Mistofminn,4.33,"Pulled one of two 2008 750 ml's from the cellar.  Cork popped with a familiar hiss. Pours a deep crimson color. Large pluming tan Belgian head produced. Excellent clarity, however the deep crimson color prevents the brew from being transparent. Soft carbonation that is barely noticeable.  I'm having a hard time picking up the cherries on the nose. I hope that the lambic will be more forthcoming in the taste department. Honestly, if it didn't say it on the bottle, I would have never pegged this beer for having cherries in it. Aroma is sweet maltyness and a spicey quality. I'm also getting some dark fruits, maybe this is from the combination of the cherries and spices. Unfortunately, I am picking up the high ABV in the nose.  Wow, what a fantastic beer! The taste is so complex, there is a party going on in my mouth. Malty sweetness is dominant, then I get earthy tones. Almost medicinal. There is a hint of alcohol, but it's not overpowering at all. Unfortunately, I'm also having a hard time picking up the cherries in the taste department as well, but thats ok. This is one incredibly complex and interesting brew. I can only assume that time will make this brew better.  Mouthfeel is medium. Sticky almost. Incredibly smooth and creamy. Carbonation is barely noticeable in the mouth. Incredibly drinkable. I'm glad I had one of these fresh(er), but now I'm curious as to what a couple years will do to this. Only time will tell!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Shikitohno,3.77,"This ale from Ommegang strikes me as there more subdued offering, although that isn't a bad thing. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a glass, it produces a thick head. Very dark red in colour, almost opaque when held up to a light. It states on the label that it's a blend of a traditional ale and cherry ale (I believe it's 96%:4%), and this shows.  The cherry scent lingers there, along with a smell somewhat akin to fragrant wood. Unlike the other Ommegang ales I've had, this one has a suitably simple taste, not as complex as the Abbey Ale or Rare Vos. Initially, it tastes like a normal ale, but after swallowing the cherry flavour comes out in full force. One thing my friends and I agree on (although I'm not sure Ommegang would want people going around saying this) is that this and the Abbey Ale have the most delicious beer burps. What I mean is, it doesn't taste absolutely vile as many brews do (Guinness comes to mind), but sort of tastes like the beer.  This ale doesn't strike as being as heavy as the others produced by Ommegang, but it does have a kick. Unfortunately, it's between $8-$9/bottle around here, so I reserve this one for occaisional purchases. Still, a fairly good ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,connecticutpoet,4.07,"Sampled at Julio's in Westborough. Clear, brown ale with a thin foamy head.  Aroma was of sweet caramel malts and cherries. Definite fruit presence.  Taste was of deep rich malt, with notes of chocolate. No cherries at all in the flavor. Wow. Interesting switch from the cherries to the chocolate.  Mouthfeel was nice, not heavy, but it definitely lets you know it's a big beer. Loaded with flavor.  Deceptively high drinkability. The ABV is well hidden, and it's not overpowering. You could go through this quickly without even trying.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,iNHaze,4.62,"From a 750mL to a wine glass  This beer pours a deep garnet with excellent clarity and ruby highlights. I had a nice 1/4"" creamy head on mine.  The smell is spectacular. Cherries, first and foremost, followed by honey, alcohol, and an olfactory wallop of caramel.  Taste is a nice malty caramel, decently sweet without being overpowering, and a slight hint of cherries, also not overpowering or cough syrupy. This is chased by a slight bitter hoppiness, which progresses to a distinctive metallic hop taste and then rounds back out with caramel. The way the flavors move across the palette is pretty impressive here.  Mouthfeel is very full and round, with a hint of yeasty carbonation. You can feel the alcohol going down, like a sip of brandy.  Drinkability really goes two ways for me. This is a great brew to drink in moderation, a glass with a meal, possibly a dessert, or even a nice cut of prime rib. But I could also see, on one of those nights when drinking just for the sake of drinking, killing quite a few glasses of this beer in a sitting. Impressive.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,gabeerfan,4.22,"Pours a deep, clear reddish brown. Nice, bubbly tan head that hangs around for a little while. Nice, complex aroma. Lots of dark fruit, raisins, dark cherries. Good whiff of chocolate. Lots of Belgian yeast aromas. Bourbon and brandy aromas from the alcohol. Lots of fruit flavors. The cherries really come out in the flavor, along with the other dark fruit. Raisins, bits of stone fruit. Chocolate and hints of spice. The alcohol is better hidden in the taste, but there are still some bourbon/brandy flavors present. Fairly thick mouthfeel. Syrupy and a little sticky, but not cloying sweet. Good drinkability. But, at almost 10%, it would be tough to have more than 2 in a night. Great dessert beer. This is one of my favorite beers and I always thoroughly enjoy it whenever I pick it up. Highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,UA8,4.3,"A- Pours a deep and dark ruby/ orange with a tall tan head.  S- Toffee malt, raisins, dried cherries, big Belgian yeast twang. A touch of rich sherry/ bourbon alcohol.  T- Rich chocolate taste up front, roasted malts and dried fruits on the midpalate. Finishes with cherry tartness and heavily roasted grain bitterness.  M- Rich and full, moderately heavy carbonation.  D- This beer is highly complex and enjoyable to drink. For the high abv it is very smooth.

Slight notes of alcohol; not much hop aroma at all.  T- Layered malt flavors; each malt flavor lends itself to the coming one. Dark fruit and rock sugary sweet notes jump out at me. Alcohol notes are present toward the end and some slight phenols linger.  M- Smooth and full body; almost creamy feel toward the back of the tongue. Carbonation is higher up front and mellows towards the finish.  D- Really an awesome quad. Good representation of the style.

Less complexity than other quads, altough the 2% Lambic adds another dimension to the taste.  M. Medium-full bodied. Well Carbonated. Smooth finish.  D. A very drinkable beer.

42,3457,ArrogantDeadGuy,3.7,"I bought this bottle during the summer of 2005 and opened it Apr. 2009. I poured the beer into the tulip-ish glass that accompanied the beer when I bought it. The ale poured an apple cider color with a brief ecru head. The ciderlike aroma set the tone for the rich cherry cider like taste and feel of the ale. There is a red wine like after taste that doesn't linger. The flavors are clean and to the point with a bigh show of cherry. The 9.8 ABV is definately there but blends well. Though the lacing is faint it sticks with the brew down to the final sip. there is a good amount of carbonation in this beer, you tell at a glance but the bubbly look doesn't convey exactly in the mouthfeel. This isn't really a ""knock 'em back"" beer for me but went well with dessert and cheese. THe coolest thing about the beer was the relatively substanital sediment hanging out in the bottom of the glass left behind just to reinforce the Belgian in this ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,cooncat,4.23,"Decanted into my Stone crystal tulip, for maximum enjoyment.  On the pour, you get a nearly opaque garnet colored brew, with orange around the edges. The mountainous head is fig colored, and quite nice, though not long lived. Some lacing is left on the glass. A beautiful beer to look at.  The nose is very malty; sweet dark breads and fruit come to mind. Hidden behind this malt is a little hint of cherries. I noticed them, because it is mentioned on the bottle.  The taste is huge and awesome. Plenty of complex malt flavors come to mind. As mentioned, dark breads, dark fruits, and figs figure prominently. The dark cherries are more noticeable in the taste, along with a very hidden funk. The mouthfeel is medium to full, and the carbonation makes this Quad do a happy dance on your palate. Each sip makes you want to take another. The 9.8% abv is well hidden, but you can feel some warming in the stomach.  Another dangerously drinkable beer, which is highly recommended. Very complex, and you could easily spend an hour with the corked bomber and the time would fly by. By all means, give this one a try!

42,3457,sonicdescent,4.22,"Looks good, though not much in the way of head, something a belgian usually takes for granted. Nice color though.  Smells of bread and cherries, with some other malty goodness in the mix. Very good.  Tastes bready and dry, I have a difficult time discerning the flavors added by the lambic. Very good however.  Mouth is again very crisp and dry, medium in body, and high in carbonation. Perhaps my pour was the reason for the lack of head, because the bubbles are there.

T- Very complex. Dark fruit, berries, light fruits, candi sugar. TONGUE: Sweetness balanced with tart herbal characters and a low level of bitter hops.  M- BODY: Medium and slightly alcoholic. CARBONATION: Active and tingly with many small bubbles.  D- I gotta say, I didn't think I'd be able to taste the ""2% ale brewed with cherries""(LAMBIC), but it was really brought out by the simplistic yet complex, ""dark quad"" base.

A: The beer is a deep dark reddish brown color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of cherries, caramel, brown sugar, some spice, roasted malts & Belgian yeast.  T: The taste likewise has a strong burst of sour cherries that is tempered by the sweetness of caramel & brown sugar. There's a good Belgian yeast background and a hearty malt character. The hops presence is very mild as to be expected any beer that's 5-years-old and particularly in this style. The after-taste is slightly sour.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish.  D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a good high-powered Belgian that adds the tartness of a lambic.

A: Poured a rich, murky mahogany amber brown color with a glowing ember edge and a bubbly three-finger head of dark butterscotch foam. Lacing is terrific, leaving walls of sugary suds on the glass.  S: Smells slightly fruity and medicinal. Cherries and sugary fruits combine with an alcoholic ester bite.  T: A bit of earthy, herbal spiciness flows so smoothly with the full, rich malt profile of this quad. There is a fruity ester flavor with that semisweet dextrose maltiness. A little hop spice rounds out the otherwise smooth, malty alcoholic dark cherry flavors.  M: A bit harsh at first, but given a minute to warm a bit and this quad flows beautifully with a creamy, medium body with the superior smoothness.  D: Very flavorful, the nearly 10% ABV is masked fairly well, and when this quad warmed a bit, I could have drank the magnum by by lonesome. A very well-crafted sipping Belgian ale.  The alcohol flavors are a little harsh and biting with the sugary fruits if you have it straight away.

Malts and spice up front with a nice fruity cherry finish. Excellent.  Mouthfeel - Slight carbonation , nice and smooth. Slight alcohol finish & burn.

If you are going to give the beer some pretense, give me some background....  Oh well...lets drink.  A-Deep garnet/ ruby with marked clarity. This is not at all what I was expecting from a Quad.

But you know something? It works, and is just fine.  M-On the light side of the Belgian spectrum, both on mouthfeel, and on carbonation.  D-The ABV is so well hidden that this is a very drinkable brew, and drink it I did....bring on another!  I like this, and will definately pick up another bottle, but I can't help wondering what this would taste like with a bit more moxie...ie a real quad taste with a real cherry kicker.

Definitely some dark berry flavor in there, which I know is supposed to be cherry, but without knowing it was brewed with 2% cherry lambic, I would say it was a medley of dark berries that included plum as well as cherry.

Big caramel malt, sweet brown sugar, raisin and cherry flavor up front with undertones of raisins and dates. Alcohol phenols are a lot more prevalent than I was expecting from the nose.

Solid one-finger plus head of light tan foam. Not extremely dense, but fairly tight. Retention is very good. Lacing is fairly full and nicely sticky.  Big, bold nose of dark fruits. The cherry scent does indeed stand out, which surprises me, slightly, since it's only 2% of the blend. Big presence of banana. Solid yeasty presence. Nice hints of caramel malts. This smells like candy. Yummy.  Not quite as sweet as the nose would imply. This is still a good thing. Dark fruits are still dominant, but the cherries are more blended. Big belgian yeastiness. Slight funk. Mild hints of caramel malts. Light spiciness of corriander and clove.  This one is light and smooth, with a medium body. Carbonation is very good, with lots of tiny little bubbles that like to dance on your tongue. Very good spring/summer drinker.

42,3457,BringusKilkenney,4.15,Poured from bottle to petrus chalice and had a medium head at first and then died quite quickly with small lacing. Has a brown color but with light is a very nice looking amber.  The smell is of fruits and yeast mostly cherries and bananas can definitely pick up the alcohol after it has sat for a min. Slight yeast smells can also be detected.  The taste is amazing for a quadruple and that is saying alot for me i am not a fan of any belgian style. The cherries definately add alot to this beer. The alcohol is hidden very well despite the abv. It has great fruity notes along with the yeast in the back ground.  The mouthfeel is good heavy carbonation and the whole thing feels a bit heavy to me but over all good.  I couldnt handle more than one of these mostly because i am not a big fan of the style but for the type it is i think it is one of the best by far. Thought i would try something new and while still not my style it is a great beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Aroma: oh my malt, sweet caramel malts, fresh fresh fresh, smells like some candy right out of the oven, elegant!  The taste hits the spot, light in the mouth, moderate carbonation, starts off a little smokey, sweet and fresh malts through delivery, smooth finish, excellent aftertaste, no sign of alcohol as other quads usually fault here; very nice! Excellent in the mouth for a beer that acts like a wine and at 9.8% the bomber is an ideal sized session brew!

42,3457,mackd,3.85,"Poured from a 2008 Bottle into an Ommegang Tulip.  A: When held to the light the beer has a rich amber color with the fine beads of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Upon initial pour the beer formed a rich, beige head about 2.5 fingers in height. The head reduced to a fine layer of bubbles which would stick with the beer throughout.  S: Following a quick pass of the glass under the nose, the first smell that comes to mind is bananas. However, allowing the head to die down, giving the beer a slight swirl reveals hints of a smell reminiscent of a sweet Bing cherry's taste, yeasty dough,mashed ripe banana and if you smell immediately after swirling you can catch a hint of vanilla that seems to be intertwined with the banana.  T: The first taste thing you taste are the cherries, and not the overly sweet Maraschinos, but rather the restrained sweetness of a perfectly ripe Bing and its a big flavor that will influence the rest of the of your experience. If you can move beyond the tingling being experienced by the tip of your tongue thanks to both the sweet cherries and fine carbonation, you'll find your mid palette treated to a bitter-sweet cocoa, espresso and maybe a touch of clove. If you hold the beer in your mouth and allow the vapors to trail through your sinuses and into your nose, allowing for an interpretation of the smell enhanced by the taste, you'll notice sweeter cherry and chocolate notes, making a smell which reminds me of the taste of a chocolate covered cherry. The beer finishes strong on the back of the palette, bitter with a hint of restrained sweetness, reminding me very much of pumpernickel raisin bread. There is a hint of mashed banana as it makes it's way out of your mouth. For a beer with a rather high ABV at 9.8%, the beer manages to hide the alcohol taste quite well, though the slight alcoholic warmth could be felt, it was an entirely enjoyable experience. My only real complaint is that this delicious beer, which starts and finishes so well, leaves an unpleasant and extremely bitter aftertaste in the back of your mouth, should you take too long between sips.  M: the beer has a light, frothy feel thanks to its fine bubble carbonation. I can imagine that this beer would go exceptionally well with a nice ripe brie.  D: While I would never turn down a glass, I don't really feel that this is an exceptionally drinkable beer. The taste, while at first exceptional and delicious, becomes almost burdensome over the course of the 1pt 9.4oz bottle. I see this as a sipping beer for special occasions with a group of people who appreciate and unique and delicious beer, though I don't see it as something meriting more then one bottle for an evening.  All in all, this was a delicious beer and something quite different from the Quadrupels I've had in the past. That said, if I decide to pick up a few more bottles, they will definitely be for aging and special gatherings, rather than regular consumption.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,rayjay,4,"2005 vintage just screaming to be drank. Poured into the 60's era Chimay chalice...why not, I figure it needs some action too.  Stunning raspberry red color, a fine slightly hazy brew that stirs up a small but long-lived white foam. Aroma of deep sweet malts and cherry Slurpee; no Smarties aroma like many other quads including Westy 12.  Slightly sweet like a good quad should be, with malt dominance and good drinkability for the strength. Alcohol is no where to be found, but an experienced beerie could tell it's there from the esters and sheet malt presence, which is slightly sticky. Faint hop bitterness gets sidelined almost as fast as it appears by the sheer malt mayhem.  Mouthfeel is deceptive, because despite the beer's weight and stickiness the body still doesn't seem that big. Mineral content is present in the water and comes through similar to a fine Scotch.  As for the age, I suspect this beer is past it's prime and is probably better around a year old and not with the 4 years this one has on it. Still remarkable and very authentic for the Belgian style. Very different from others in it's class, though.  Carbonation is fairly low, even for my standards. I'd care for a tiny bit more. No where near the typical Belgian foamer that you need to let settle (I'm thinking especially of Chimay and Orval).  A very good beer for quad lovers. Would make an excellent pairing with mussels, especially if cooked with them as well. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The taste is cherries at first, which quickly fades into a yeasty malty balance that is quite nice. The mouthfeel is nice, a bit thin, but layered quite nicely between the cherry and the malt.

Appearance: Mahogony in color with a ¾"" thick light tan head that recedes eventually to leave behind a small ring of foam around the glass and some fine spots of lacing.  Smell: The first impression is of dark brown sugar or dark caramel malt, dark fruits and cherry. Repeated samplings of the aroma reveal a hint of alcohol but it is not so strong as to be really noticeable at first.  Taste: The dark brown sugar and caramel hit the tongue first with a light tart cherry flavor following on. There is plum in here along with some other dark fruit. The alcohol comes through in the finish but is not unpleasant.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium bodied with minimal carbonation. The finish is lightly sweet with dark brown sugar taste and cherry tartness that goes on and on and on.

42,3457,sweetbrew82,4.16,"750 ML into a snifter/ 2008 version  P: Caramel brown from the bottle, bright crimson shaded plum in the glass. The two fingered khaki-colored head is thick & frothy, showing superb retention. Seriously, the head was around for more than 10 minutes! It faded in a somewhat rocky fashion and left plenty of webbed lacing behind.  A: Sweet malts, very pronounced sour cherries, candied sugar, alcohol, and yeast.  T: Whoa! You can definitely taste the Lambic characteristics in here. It lends that certain sour, kind of tart flavor to the beer. And I like it! Sweet, toasted malt bill takes center stage and never relinquishes the spotlight. The cherries are both deliciously sweet like maraschino juice, and tart like a Lambic. A moderate amount of candied sugar is there to make sure that sweet stomps the hell out of any bitter that might try to flare up. Slightly herbal hops are faint, but work nicely with the cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper-like spiciness on the back half and the finish.  M: Three Philosophers weighs in just a notch below full-bodied, but is rich & smooth nevertheless. It's also aggressively carbonated for an expansive feel on the palate.  D: Drinkability is well above average due to the great flavors. But like all Quads, it's too sweet and intoxicating to possibly partake of another.  Notes: Definitely on the sweet side (like a Quad should be) but not at all overwhelming. What really makes this beer standout to me is the Cherry Lambic that was blended in. It gives it that sour tartness that really plays well off of the sweetness, while providing the palate with a dazzling display of cherry brilliance.

Actually smelled really sour until it warmed up a bit.  Taste is great. Drinkable and smooth without showing the 9.8% ABV. Definitely a good amount of cherry from the blended lambic in there, but also some molasses or caramel and maybe even cinnamon, but malts are the real star here.  Mouthfeel is pretty darn smooth.

Nice in that while it has a strong malt presence, it isn't overbearingly sweet. Smooth if not overly deep, or creamy, or alluring. I just find the depth and flavor a little shallow. A rush of dark fruit at the end provides a slightly harsh (or a little bittersweet) ending. I much prefer this to other similar belgian cherry-inspired beers, like Mad Elf.

Hops are non-existant.  This one is definitely a sipper. It's better shared, of course. The alcohol rears its head when warmed up to room temperature. I still dig it though. Also, it is a bit wine-like too, which is a nice thing if you want to convert people to the wonders of beer.

I drank half of the 750 at around 40-45 degrees and the other half at around 50-55 degrees. It is much sweeter and more complex at the higher temp but also much more ""boozy"".

42,3457,masterhomebrewer,4.4,"Nice one-inch white head atop a beautiful dark rouge body. Raisins, cherries, candi sugar in the aroma. Tastes like a Belgian quad with a sour twist, which of course is exactly what the beer is. Sweet, complex, creamy up front and finishing perfectly with the light-sour bite. Smooth in the mouth with tight, intense carbonation and chewy goodness. The drinkability is above average considering the big abv -- and is a testament to the sweet/dry balance provided by the touch of sour. Good shit.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,darklordlager,3.85,"Picked up from the Coffee Grounds in Eau Claire on my 21st Birthday.  Pours a big fluffy tan head, that sat there and later reduced to practically nothing. Colour is an intriguing brown.  Smell is of dark fruit, some alcohol, and candi sugar.  Taste is big brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit, caramel, faint cherry notes, vanilla. Alcohol is detectable as it warms.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy.  Drinkability- Not something that I would drink on a regular basis, or have more than one of in a sitting. A great treat.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,brewcrew76,3.65,"2007 Vintage  A - Cherry brown with ruby highlights and a thin tan head that quickly changes to a ring of lace around the rim.  S - Spicy belgian yeast with tart cherries, hints of dark fruits, raisins and licorice. Slightly sweet, brown sugar and a hint of caramel. Complex and subtle at the same time.  T - Nutty with dark fruits, raisins, prunes and figs. Molasses, sweet malts and tart black cherry. The cherry is much darker in taste than aroma. Fairly sweet and seems to get sweeter as it warms.  M - Medium mouthfeel and it is sweet enough to feel a touch syrupy. Alcohol is hidden in taste but has a slight warming feeling going down.  D - Better than I remember it but the sweetness would prevent me from having more than 1 12oz bottle. A 750 might be a bit much.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The cherry flavor is noticeable in the aftertaste, and is quite sour. I am not immediately sold. A bit plainer that what I expect from Quad (hard to keep Trappist examples out of mind), but the addition of the sour lambic is nice.  MF: Light bodied, especially considering the ABV. Nice carbonation.  D: Not bad at all, but not a ""wow"" either. Lacks a bit of expected complexity.

Main flavors noticed are cherry, plum, clove, and a little yeast....all with sweet and sugary malt backbone behind it, with a little alcohol in the finish. Good complexity here. Alcohol warmth becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. With the exception of the alcohol, this beer is not too heavy in the mouth, but I probably couldn't drink more then one in a sitting.

42,3457,MrIncognito,4.28,"Got a 12oz bottle from Total Wine while in Carey, NC.  A - Poured into a stemless wine glass, the beer is opague reddish-brown with a nice fluffy tan head of about 2 fingers. Head lasts for a very long time and settles to a nice 1/4-inch film and leaves great sticky lacing on the glass.  S - The smell of cherries hits me up front with a nice tartness followed by that nice belgian yeast and dark malt. Bready yet sweet at the same time with hints of chocolate and alcohol in the back.  T&M - Very much like the smell but with less of a cherry presence than expected. Nice and malty with dark fruits and then the sweet and somewhat tart cherries following suit. Alohol is smooth and evens out the slightly high carbonation. Nice and warming with a great flavor.  D - I could sip on this all night. A great brew and a definite sipper. I was a little wierded out when I read it was a kriek and quad blend, but it came out nice. They compliment each other well. Will definite cellar one next time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JohnQVegas,4.47,"Bottle.  Cloudy red-brown, decent light-khaki head, sifts down in short order to a tiny smattering of bubbles.  Aroma is fantastic - pureed raisins and brown sugar, fresh baked spice bread, loads of gingerbread.  Dry body, very well executed - brown sugar coated, lightly sour cherries up front, light breadcrust and spicebread notes, bit of tingly alcohol, with that effervescent, dry, ethereal lightness the best Belgian Quads & Strong Darks have. Finish lingers with perfect cherry on the tongue, just a bit of spicy brown sugar, hints of that breadcrusty bitterness. Beautifully done.  Lively carbonation, full bodied, seems to expand beautifully on the swallow, coating the throat and leaving behind some fantastic lingering flavors. Fantastic beer.  Nicely drinkable for such a huge beer, surprisingly so - a world class Quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,fingerlaker,4.35,"A little note before starting- buy a bottle of this and put it in your basement for a year. This dessert beer tastes much better after some time to mature.  Bottle is a 750 (Imperial)  Blasting the cork off 20 feet straight into the air, I pour it into a glass and get a soda-like fizz. TERRIBLE! So I give it a ""top pour"" and that leaves a nice, two finger head that sticks around a bit. I guess the first time around I poured it wrong. The head leaves tiny bands on the glass.  The smell is of wood, the sweetness of carmel and a little bit of medicine smell. Heavy alcohol scent. Quite nice.  Taste is a TON sweeter than expected, but still fantastic. This is a dessert beer. You have it after a meal as a treat. Taste is of a good toffee, carmel with nice spicing. A wee hop infusion in the middle- this beer wasn't designed to be bitter, so that is fine. The alcohol is VERY prominent and will kick your ass if you don't respect this 9.8% brew.  Despite it's heavy body and quite rich flavor, it's not grating or polarizing. It is very drinkable and is one of my favorites.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Quite a pleasant smell.  T - First thing I taste is a muted cherry, then a yeasty heart and the finish is almost entirely alcohol.  M - Super slick, but the ABV is quite apparent in the aftertaste. Finish is dry and, again, quite a bit of alcohol present.  D - Though I feel like the alcohol is a bit out of balance with the rest of the beer it's still a good brew, and a pleasure to drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Syrupy  I deffinatly picked up on the cherries right away. Not over powering though. Balanced well with the sweet malty goodness.

Three finger beige head.  s - It's al yeast,l malts, and cherries in there with a lingering hint of spice and the slightest touch of alcohol.  t - A peppery sweetness with a bit of cherry in the mildly bitter aftertaste. The carbonation hits in the right spot to mask the 9.8% ABV. Warming on the throat. A little numbing on the palate.  m - Good stuff. Malty, almost syrupy as it arrives but mellows after the swallow.  d - Great Belgian ale for a cold winters day. Hearty with a warming sensation. The only downside is that it seems to be a little bit over carbonated but I'll try a pour a little rougher to see if I can take care of that. Probably not a session beer but a fine sipper for its style. Seems to deliver its ABV pretty quickly - maybe the high carbonation helped? Nice touch with the 2% cherry lambic without overdoing it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ruckzuck,4.08,"A - pours a hazy brown that turns sort of cherry colored when held up to light. Really nice beige head  S - candied pecans anyone? Definitely a nose full of cherries accompanied by brown sugar and a bit of Belgian yeast. There's also a hint of ABV in there. Nice  T - the cherry taste really jumps out initially and actually sticks around a fair bit in the aftertaste sort of in the roof of your mouth. I still get a bit of brown sugar and a lot of sweet dark malt. There's a bit of ABV present as well, but for almost 10% it's fairly well hidden. Also, it gives the beer that nice booze-soaked fig or raisin or plum taste us BA's are so fond of  M - creamy as all get out, yet the carbonation is just right to dance on your tongue as it massages it. Great  D - for a blend between a quad and a kriek it's quite good. I think this is the first time I've had this in like 4.5 years maybe, and it's still very enjoyable.

42,3457,katan,3.73,"750 mil, 2008 vintage  A - Dark orange - somewhere between a dark red and brown in color. Head formation is very strong and thick - at about 5mm. It is darker in color, similar to a stout. Carbonation is quite obvious. Little hazing that I can find.  S - Very yeasty - dominated by the belgian earthy yet spicy yeast. Some malt sweetness in the background, almost reminding me of cherries.  T - Starts of with a smooth sweet flavor. Starts to develop a hair of balance mid-stream with the yeast. Not very assertive. At the end is a strong bitter bite that comes way out of left field for me. Aftertaste is a acidic sour bite associated with a sort of cherry flavor.  M - Very carbonated, which is leading towards alot of bite on the tongue. The body of the beer itself is moderate to perhaps a bit light.  D - A filling beer combined with a high ABV in a 750 ml container - that speaks volumes for it being a single and special occasion beer. I believe that is the brewers intent anyway.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

S - Ripe cherries, sweet malt, hints of phenolic character and a tad bit of licorice on the nose initially, also accompanied by a bit of a general herb-like character.  T - Sweetness of the malt mixed with ripened cherries hit the palate first. This is followed by a bit of licorice and tiny hint of alcohol that combine with a small hit of phenols which leaves a sweet, dry cherry finish. Quite a taste that challenges the palate.  MF - On the lighter end of full-bodied with a smooth feel punctuated only by a twinge of the combination of slight alcohol and a higher carbonation.  D - Relatively drinkable although the ABV is on the higher side.  Notes - A good tasting Quad-blend and quite interesting with the addition of cherries, however I feel that this aspect would get too sweet too quick. Granted, I would really only have this as an aperitif or to compliment a cheese or chocolate.

Smell is of Belgian yeast, black cherries, brown sugar, and alcohol.  I was surprised to taste a good bit of rich and roasted nuttiness, much like a brown ale. The cherry is not overpowering at all, which is nice. Other dried fruits are apparent. Just a fantastic balance. The ABV isn't really that noticeable.  The mouthfeel is fantastic.

Wow, I was very impressed with the deep cherries and light malts molasses flavors. Very drinkable, I thought it was a cherry-porter, until I went to BA, and saw that it was a quadrupel with 9.8% ABV. Never would have guessed it, It felt more like a 6~7%, which goes more to the smoothness and drinkability.  I could have easily had another.

Dark brown-red in color -- almost like bricks or mud, but translucent -- with three fingers of thick pale red head (don't know why some people weren't getting any foam on their pours) that lingers well after the pour.  Wow, that Belgian swirl of flavors... Really amazing for an American brewery, but then again Ommegang is owned (in part?) by Duvel and, let's face it, they're basically a brewery transplanted from Belgium to New York. The cherry flavor is light in the nose, and that phenolic blend so typical of a quad is really allowed to take the foreground.  On the taste, the cherry turns darker, almost becoming the backbone of the flavor palate. Alcohol burn is fairly pronounced -- definitely tastes like it has more alcohol than 9.8%. All sorts of dried fruits (apricots and prunes especially) with syrupy malts lingering around the sides. Feel is medium in the mouth -- about what you'd expect.  Definitely a sipping beer, but really great. I think the four packs are the way to go, as a 12oz bottle of this stuff is more than enough for one person, especially after having another beer to warm up on, which you should. This brew is incredibly complicated and is not to be trifled with.

Taste is lots of sweet sugary goodness. This one has that quad taste that keeps brining us back for more. The cherry blend adds some tart back to the very sweet, but not cloying, tones.

Full-bodied if not outright heavy, plops onto the tongue with all its weight. The sweetness of the cherry, raspberry, plum fruit not to be denied here either, even slightly cloaks the ginger, clove spice, licorice, brown sugar and honey. Syrupy texture has it clinging hard to the mouth pores, lack of lift makes it hard to get a clear impression of the malts, never mind the hops. Average carbonation.

Enjoyably so. A well balanced, continually interesting flavor that opens up more and more as time goes on. The body is pleasingly full, smooth and and well-rounded.

Strong cherry and roasted spice in the nose! Lovely presence in the nose that makes me start to salivate.  The cherry is very evident and just keeps this from being perfect, sadly. But what a taste!

Thinly dispersed lacing, but that colour - if it didn't remind me so much of Timmerman's Kriek it would be outstanding.  Delicious nose, with burnt toffee, slight - although I'm probably wrong about this - smokey character with a lot of sweet dried fruit to boot. Sweet, blossoming and delicious. So much character, so much sublimity. Stop the presses, we have just discovered perfection.  Has that slightly, subtly smoked flavour on the very front palate, then trails off into a really full-bodied, sweet 'n' sour full mouth flavour. Has hints of lime mixed with raisins, cinnamon, wood smoke and treacle. Slightly too tart for me to absolutely cream my jeans, but it's delicious, complex, very flavoursome and has enough pleasantness to power a small jet-propelled shuttle to the moon and back.

The beer itself is a mildly sweet quad with wonderful complexity. Notes of fig and dark cherries predominate against a backdrop of candied fruit and lightly toasted brown bread. Roast is moderate.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and rich, moderately full.  Could drink this any time, although it doesn't inspire the devotion I feel towards some of the most superior quads I've ever tried... it's accessibility, price, and availability make it a must try, a classic, and a worthy respect garnerer.

42,3457,Dirty1,4.42,I picked up a 750ml. of this a few nights ago and poured it into a tulip glass.  A- Pours a nice cloudy dark amber with a strong red tint when held to the light. 2 finger thick white head that settled rather slowly. It also left a good bit of lace around the glass.  S- It had that typicaly strong Belgian yeast smell that is so lovely. It also had a nice chocolate malt and roasted grain pressence with a nice subtle sour cherry note. It smells delicious!  T- Taste is similar to the smell. The yeast is up front with sweat chocolate malts and subtle caramel. Then comes the tart cherries and a subtle spice. The cherries become more pronounced as the beer warmes a bit. It has a wonderfull balance about it that is a thing of beauty! Some alcohol warming is present but hidden pretty well.  M- Medium body with a lively carbonation thats not over done. It has a nice crisp finish that is slightly dry with not much aftertaste.  D- This beer is great! Its a unique blend that works really well for me. Its very drinkable despite the 9.8%. It did sneak up on me a little by the end of the bottle. I will definatly add this to my frequent rotation list!

42,3457,ncstateplaya,4.25,"This is typically my beer of choice when I go to 5 Star in Raleigh, its one of the few places in Raleigh I have been able to find it. This review is for the bottle I had on Saturday night.  Appearance: Wow, a beautiful hazy mahogany with an outstanding head. The head appears to be extremely soft and fluffy, upon further inspection, it holds true. The head is an oatmeal/cookie dough color and was easily an inch thick in my chalice. Of course there was yeast floating in the glass.  Smell: The cherries speak loud and clear to the senses. Dark malts and sweet caramel rush the nose. There is a yeasty funk that goes along with the alcohol esters. The smell is very inviting.  Taste: There is a dark brown sugar sweetness that pairs extremely well with the tart cherries. Through the fruit and maltiness, the alcohol sneaks by unnoticed (almost undetected).  Mouthfeel: This beer is extremely smooth and pretty chewy. Coats the mouth very soothingly. I would almost say it is biscuity, but not quite. The carbonation is great.  Drinkability: As with my earlier spill, of course I think the drinkability is high. It goes down so smooth and easy for the ABV. A little sweet, but that only detracts slightly from the drinkability of this brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,morebeergood,3.85,"Opened a 2007 bottle this past New Year's Eve. Poured into a Three Philosophers glass that I purchased at the brewery a while back. Hazy red color. Large white head at first but that burned off quickly. Some bits of sediment noticed at the bottom of the glass. Smelled nice and spicy, with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg present. Tasted very smooth. Some aging did this bottle well. The alcohol was definitely more mellow, but also, the cherry flavor was less noticeable than fresher bottles I have had. The two glasses that I got out of this bottle went down very easily. While the taste made have been smoothed out a bit more than I would have expected, some aging definitely changed this beer in a good way.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,pokesbeerdude,4.3,"Picked up a single 750ml from Wilbur's in Ft. Collins. Approximately $8.  A: Poured with care so as to not disturb the dregs. Hazy brown/red cherry colored with an enormous off white head. At least two inches thick. Slowly recedes.  S: There is a definite alcohol characteristic with this one, slight hint of cherries and some big malty smells too, some nice apple smells, and a lot of Belgian spiciness.  T: Big hit of cinnamon and spices up front, and a slightly tart cherry flavor as well, though not as pronounced as in the nose, nice lingering coffee aftertaste, and somewhat of a buttery flavor as well. Very spicy, and quite boozey. As it warms, cherry flavor become more up front, still quite malty and alcoholic though.  M: Relatively thin, nicely carbonated, and really hot from the alcohol, this one burninates the gullet. Relatively smooth, and a nice dry finish.  D: This one is sneaky. Lots of alcohol, but it drinks quite easily, goes down nicely and I could easily see popping open another 750 if I had one on hand. Great beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,kellsean,4.32,"Could not stop drinking these while at my parents' house in upstate NY.  Poured into a pint glass at fridge temp. A rich two finger head lingers for a minute then gives way to some decent lacing. The ruby/copper cloudiness of this brew makes me curious.  Smell is quite malty with some sour fruit (cherries) and alcohol.  The beer initially has a soda-like taste (and mouthfeel) and is almost too sweet. Letting this one warm does wonders; the cherry aftertaste really stands out and the alcohol seems to become more well hidden.  For me, this beer is somewhere in between a session beer and a sipper. Three Philosophers is a great, different take on a quad.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,StarlightSeraph,3.55,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a snifter:  Appearance: Pours a dark, murky reddish brown. A thin white, half-finger head formed, that dissipated very quickly. A little bit of the head continued to float on the beer the entire time. Tiny bit of lacing on the sides  Smell: Sour cherries, and other fruits, against a background of malt. The cherry smell grew sweeter as the beer warmed. The 'Belgian' nature of this brew was also evident.  Taste: Cherries hit the tongue first, by a background of malt. The cherry taste is very faint, and replaces the initial 'hop bite' you might normally find in a beer. Hints of coffee and chocolate as well. Slightly bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of coffee. The aftertaste lingered for quite some time. Hides the alcohol content very well.  Mouthfeel: Very highly carbonated, almost like soda or champagne. Also surprisingly thin bodied, which in this case, I felt was a good thing. It prevented the malt from becoming cloyingly sweet and feeling 'syrupy'.  Drinkability: I enjoyed the beer. I liked it more the more I got into it, as the beer warmed and the flavors began to come out more. Definitely a sipper, as it is fairly sweet. This is my first real introduction into Belgian beers, so I can't really compare this to any others.  Once I have more quads and Belgians, I might modify this review I would probably buy this at some point, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,oddfire,4.25,Wow this beer is good! Had it in a 750mL corked bottle. The smell is nutty with a hint of fruit. The taste is very strong. You get notes of cherries and raspberries with a hint of nut brown ale. The finish is clean and refreshing but it could be the alcohol evaporating. This beer is one you need to savor the flavour with. The alcohol content will sneak up on you. Very well worth the money in either a bar or store.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Dark amber brown with an offwhite head which quickly turns to a tiny bubbly lace with several areas of slightly larger bubbles.  Smells of spices, mint, bubble gum, licorice, and alcohol.  Lots of sweet malt, some dried fruits, caramelized sugars. Spices and bananas - some yeasty notes as well. The flavor is a bit thinner than I'd like, at least given the mouthfeel. There's some bitterness. The finish is too sweet and carries that bubblegum flavor with it.  Hit immediately with a cloying, sticky mouthfeel. Plenty of carbonation, but it didn't clean up the feel on this.  This will get old before the bottle is done. A bit too sweet to be terribly drinkable on this nearly 10% ABV sipper.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange color with a small off white head that disappears quickly.  Smell: Sweet with fruits and alcohol dominating.  Taste: Very sweet with a strong alcohol presence that dominated this beer for me.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and creamy.  Drinkability: Very good brew despite the dominance of the alcohol.

Aroma is very sweet and fruity, slight hints of alcohol. Taste is good and complex. Very strong alcohol unlike other Belgain quads with a tart finish. Good texture and body. The taste was good and I would recommend this as a good session beer.

42,3457,beefbait,4.2,"3P's Quad has a dark amber color similar to whiskey. It tastes just like it smells, sweet and malty, not as sweet as St. B's or Rochefort, which, to this reviewer, is a positive (StB and Roche are fine). Upon tasting, it starts off with a maltly flavor and full bodied mouthfeel, immediately becomes delicately sweet, very cider-like--fruity, apples come to mind, then finishes subtley with a twangy sweetness on the palate. The bottle does contain sediment, so the last pour is cloudy, but the flavor and body are not affected. I drank it out of a crystal goblet and, later, a pint glass, preferred drinking it from the pint. What I write next is probably a heresy, but I made a batch of beer using that ""cheesy"" beer making kit--""senor cerveza"" Recipe: 1 can r*d ale and m*llow a*ber, 1 pk of b**ster, 2 cups honey and 4 wks fermenting and 2 wks conditioning in bottles, 7.8 abv--and it had a similar smell, taste, appearance, and mouthfeel as 3P's Quad.

42,3457,yesyouam,4.4,"This beer is a muddled haze of red-orange-brown topped with a thin white head that quickly vanishes. (SRM: 17?) The aroma is of smooth sweet grain and malt-- a tight and solid smell. It is quite full-bodied and very smooth!

A slight tan head fizzed up, and stayed there for a few minutes. Great flavor of brandied cherries, with some clove and some other earthy spice notes I couldn't quite identify. I liked the slight sweetness level. Slight alcohol presence, but I did not consider that a bad thing. A decent amount of malt in there as well, and gave the brew a slight biscuit or bread dough character. Nice, substantial, slightly velvety mouth feel.  Great sipping brew, although would probably pair well with strong cheeses....have three or four of these, and you'll be spouting out some great philosophy!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bluemoonswoon,3.87,"Have seen this for just about forever at Binny's and have always ignored it for some reason, but it seems that I'm well overdue to knock out a few Quads before 08 ends.  Says it's brewed with cherries and from an appearance standpoint I would agree with that statement. Deep and dark cherry to be exact, like the kind of dark reddish brown you get from cooking up old fashioned cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. A vigorous pour yields a dime thick head that fades into a thin, but creamy looking cap.  Smells heavily of sweet cooked cherries, brown sugar reduced in butter so everything gets nice and caramelized, but its not all sweet, the cherries impart a slight acidity to balanced  Tart and sweet, slightly woody and even a bit smokey. Seems like the amalgamation of a Kriek and a Quad and it sort of seems like they don't belong together at first. Complexity gets a little higher, flavors become less muddled, when the beer gets a chance to warm up and breathe. Maltier, warm alcoholic heat keeps the back of the throat feeling like its wrapped in blankets. Tart cherry and sweet brown sugar and an earthy spiciness make this beer a definite sipper, this is where the beers tartness works in the beers favor and keeps an already sweet beer from becoming mind bendingly saccharin.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Heavily malted from the beginning with a light a burn to the back of the throat, finishing exceptionally clean with a hint of dark cherries and brown sugar. The finish then echoes around the back of the mouth, bouncing from the roof of the tongue and back, with lingering and added nuttiness. Enjoyable, if only for the unique combination of flavors, but not wholly so, but I can't put my finger on why. As I near the end of the glass, it continually numbs the mouth like shots of completely wonderful liquid novacaine.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,afoersch,3.33,"My first foray into the world of Ommegang - I've heard good things of the brewery, and I was excited for this beer.  This fine beverage appeared a dark red-orange-brown, fairly hazy, with a thin, light tan head that looks almost sandy, but stuck around until the finish with a little bit of splotchy lacing - plenty inviting. Looks, indeed, like a quad blended with a bit of some sort of cherry brew; not strikingly beautiful, but far from ugly.  There is some cherry up front in the nose, but a very dark cherry. Other familiar Belgian fragrances drift in and out, mostly sweet but there's a cold sense to them - as if one were to smell spring and summer flowers and vegetation during the middle of winter. Maybe that only makes sense to me, but it's what I felt consistently after a few whiffs. A strange sensation, and one I'm not sure I like. However, there's definitely a sense of both styles in the smell.  The taste of this beer is subtle but not complex. The cherries have almost all gone (to be expected, when only 2% of the ale was brewed with cherries), but haunt a little bit from the smell. A bit too sweet overall, but surprisingly not in a very fruity way. I taste some pecan pie and pastry dough in there, along with raisins and green tea (with honey, maybe?) and a tiny bit of sweet lemon flavor, and nothing quite balances out. Some of the most unique malty flavors I've had yet, but they don't really jibe with each other.  Mouthfeel gets good marks because this beer has just the right amount of weight and cohesiveness in the mouth, which then leads to good drinkability. The beer just feels like it's not complete - it lacks balance and depth, but I'm hoping for good things from future batches, perhaps.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,popery,4.15,"A very good blended beer that flirts with greatness. Three Philosophers is a delightful quad blended with a cherry lambic. This worried me a bit as I'm not the biggest fan of fruit blend lambics, but then I haven't sampled the heights of that style. On the other hand, my feelings for quads are not so complex as they are almost entirely positive.  At any rate, this beer pours a deep red brown and looks brilliant in the chalice. The head is a touch foamy. The cork came off with a solid kick. The smell is fantastic. Sour cherries combine with earthy, fruity and spicy Belgian notes. There are bananas, plums, cloves, peppercorns, deep woody tones and slightly funky earth flavors all over the taste and nose. Now, I will say that I like the Ommegang yeast flavor but I don't love it. It doesn't have the character of some of the Trappists, but that's the sort of criticism that should be good to hear. My main problem with the beer is the cherry lambic. It's a very interesting flavor, but I would prefer it not to be there if I were to choose. It's just a little puckery and a little sweet fro the quad. It's a very interesting thought and I really liked it at first, but over the course of even just a full Chimay goblet, I started to just want the quad without the cherry noise. That said, Ommegang did a tremendous job with this beer. I bet that I could easily introduce this beer to non-craft beer crowds. It's a little expensive for that, but the big quad flavor and the cherry hook would help grab a crowd.  I would love to age a bottle. I would enjoy a less carbonated feel and a more blended flavor. We'll see about hiding one from myself. Always a challenge. I paired this beer with some creamy cheddar, which was ok but I didn't really have much else around at the moment. (Time delay edit) I just remembered that I had a Specialty's Direct thick rich semi-sweet chocolate chip cookie. It pairs quite well with the chocolate. It brings out more of the fruitiness of the yeast rather than the cherry. I imagine the beer would go well with good rich food, maybe a braised pork tenderloin or something. The sour cherry could really cut a rich flavor well and the quad is a joy anytime.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jkendrick,3.16,"2008 vintage  Appearance: Hazy amber color with frothy, tan head that recedes quickly. Minimal lacing.  Aroma: Aroma is sweet with licorice, raisins/dark fruits dominating. The malty sweetness reminds me a bit of cough syrup.  Mouthfeel: Rather full-bodied for the style and creamy.  Taste: Very sweet and cough syrupy with a strong alcohol presence. The sweetness dominates up front, but is soon overtaken by the alcohol which is just too powerful, in my opinion. It's a bit tougher to identify the flavors over the alcohol, but the dark fruits and caramelized sugars are there. I don't taste the cherries mentioned on the label much.  Overall impression: Very boozy. Too much for me, even for a quad. The medicinal aroma and taste don't help it much either. Perhaps more time in the cellar would serve this one well. Overall, it's not BAD but I wish I had opened this with my fiance or a friend to share the bottle with as one glass to sip would definitely be enough for me.  UPDATE: 2009-08-17  Nine months of cellaring later and it is definitely better, but now feels a bit thin and certainly doesn't eel any more complex.

42,3457,WalrusJockey,3.77,"Brewed 2004, 750ml bottle poured into Chimay goblets.  Appearance - extremely dark amber color. When not held to light, appears nearly opaque, but is in fact translucent. Very cloudy, reasonable amount of sediment (~1inch left in bottle, un-poured).  Smell - very fruity. Almost like a wine, but with a sweet-malt smell, behind the fruit.  Taste - Grapes, then malt. Upon swallowing, cherries, then more malt. Aftertaste is also malty, with lingering fruitiness. Fruit flavors throughout are all very rich, well developed, and natural tasting, none of that 'fruit flavoring' nonsense here. The over-all taste almost reminds me of a port, if port were beer.  Mouthfeel - very smooth. The bottle was very lightly carbonated (I nearly had to yank the cork out,) so the beer lays in the mouth almost like a wine. Very silky, very smooth; also not dissimilar to port.  Drinkability - this is, without a doubt, a well made beer. It may very well be a Great Beer. But it isn't a great beer for me. Even though I am enjoying this glass, I can't imagine having another without a nice bowl of really good vanilla ice cream on the side of it. As someone who doesn't love fruit-beer, this is not the beer for me. But I would recommend it to anyone who like a good fruity beer, because for what it is, it is very nice.

It had been sitting in my fridge for what seemed like forever waiting for me to get close to it. Decided to pop it open the other night. Served chilled and poured into a snifter, this one was consumed on 12/05/2008.  The pour was very nice with a rich brown color that was loaded down with ruby highlights that abounded. Huge off white head rose up from the depths and clung to the sides of the glass for what seemed like forever before finally settling back down and relaxing.  The aroma was rich, nice notes of dark fruity yeast, hints of swet cherry notes and an herbal tone that prickled at the nose quite nicely. Rich malts lying underneath provided a nice level of sweetness. The flavor was about as big and rich as you could get. Most of the alcohol was well hidden under rich fruit notes. Huge flavor here that dissolves and transforms with each passing sip. Nice touches of cherry and unique sour notes. Smooth, incredibly smooth with a rich carbonation and velvet like touch to it.

This beer is extraordinarily well-balanced with a little bit of everything and perhaps even thought-provokingly so. The finish is light and welcoming, though not smooth or refreshing. The mouthfeel and drinkability derive from the beer's fruit component, though allows for a bitterness rarely matched with fruity beers.

The aroma is dark ripe fruit, the cherries perhaps, and seductive alcohol over a malt background. Exceedingly smooth but not syrupy. The flavors are similar to the aroma with sweet malt, dark complex fruit, some sugary character as well. It finishes warm from the alcohol. This beer is warmly inviting, like the crackling of a fireplace on a cold winters eve. A sipper indeed, but do sip.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,bhalter8,4.33,"Pours a wide, but light head on top that quickly dissolves into the deep, hazy, brown beer. Only faint light comes through the goblet. A nice looking beer, indeed. The smell is not very strong, but a nice fruity, sweetness, though. The taste is excellent, a sweet, but surprisingly light quad. All this adds to the smooth, and deceiving considering the alcohol, drinkability. I could very easily drink too many, its almost like a candy goodness with its sweetness",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,elricorico,4.57,"2007 vintage. Clear and deep ruby brown colour. One finger of tan head that is supported by some visible carbonation. Takes some time for head to recede.  Sweet and malty aroma, with a hint of cherry. Suggests candy sugar and red licorice.  Sweet to taste, but not as sweet as it smelled. Up front is a little spicy while sweetness is strongest through the middle, a mix of big malt and musty cherries. Finish is just slightly warming. Overall it has a smooth, complex flavour.  Medium to full bodied with subtle carbonation. Smooth and pleasant to the mouth.  For 9.8%, I can't think of many beers as drinkable. It goes down far too easily. I'd buy this again in a second.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Nice lacing remained after drinking the beer. The smell was a pleasant hoppy smell but the taste is what strikes you about this ale. It's plenty hoppy and there's the tartness associated with a Belgian style ale, but the taste is an ale version of a chocolate covered cherry. Very flavorful and very drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Likeburning,4.17,"A deep translucent woody maroon brown color with a thich tan creamy head. The aroma is a bit fruity (cherry aroma) The aroma is reminiscent of chocolate covered carries, like when you break open a chocolate covered cherry and the filling pours out. Just like that. The flavor is similar to other Belgian style strong ales but significantly darker with a distinct hint of cherries. Memories of pleasant Valentine's days past come to mind with the first taste. Definitely a beer to be savored.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,2LBrew,4.23,"Poured out of a bomber from Bev Mo.  The appearance was reddish brown with a dirty white head that disappears rather quickly.  The smell is of fruits, but also has hints of molasses.  The taste has a lot of sugars and malt miced together. Also cherry, and a hint of tastness.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonated.  The drinkability of this beer is an awesome adventure. I could definitely only drink about one of these but I enjoyed every drop of it. I also enjoyed it more as it warmed up and released more of the cherry flavor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell - Dark roasted malts with some brown sugar smells, and faint fruity aromas.  Taste - The malts take over here, caramel and chocolate notable. The lambic barely shows its head on the finish with a slight tart. A few spices mull around as well, namely cinnamon and ginger, as well as the alcohol showing its head on the finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium body with a moderately light amount of carbonation for a Belgian-style brew.  Drinkability - This won't be a staple as something doesn't quite sit right, but its definitely tasty.

The aroma is very sweet with candy sugar and caramel malts dominating. There are generous amounts of dark fruits as well, raisins and the like.  The taste is as sweet as the aroma suggests, tons of caramelized sugar, dark fruits and caramel malts. Cherries are in there as well, with a hint of sourness.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation. It may be just a tad thin.  This is a decent example of a quad despite not being extremely complex.

A fully tan head that lasts for years. 2% Blended with a cherry lambic style, its great, you can really taste they tartness of the cherry. Its a very malty chewy beer, smooth and rich all the way down, this bottle would have been hard to finish without my drinking partner.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smooth start, fruits kick in with cherry being the most prominent. The apricot and peaches come through but very subtly. Kind of bite to it, but not in a pleasing way.  All in all, I really can't recommend this beer. I didn't enjoy it very much from the get go do to its lack of smoothness and semi tart flavors.

Taste is cherry, plum, whiskey, brown sugar and Belgian yeast.  Mouthfeel doesn't hide the abv very well but the warming alcohol adds to the taste. Full and smooth.  Another great beer from Ommegang. This is one hell of a quadrupel from an American brewery. It's big, warm and tasty.

42,3457,glid02,4.25,"Got this at Green's on Ponce in Atlanta.  Pours a golden brown color with a foamy two-finger off-white head. There's a little bit of suspended yeast and the head dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles on top and a thick ring around the glass. Lacing is decent.  Smells mostly of molasses and Belgian sugar, but as it warms the cherries become more apparent.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Molasses and Belgian sugar up front, with a very slight cherry taste coming in at the end. There's a dry finish with little bitterness and a hint of the ABV at the end.  Mouthfeel is good. This beer has a good thickness and grainy carbonation that makes this go down smoothly.  Drinkability is good. The slight cherry flavors make this one interesting. It's certainly a solid quad with or without the cherries, and I didn't have a problem finishing the bomber.  Overall this is a good Belgian ale.

T: Nice light brown sugar mixed with a lot a dark malt. The kriek, while being only 2% of the beer plays a more substantial role, adding a bit of fruit and medicinal character.  M: Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side for a close to 10% ale, off-dry finish, not bad.  D: Another quality ale and blend from the fellows at Ommegang, I wish it wasn't so pricey, it's good stuff.

Touch of funky Belgian yeast.  T - Sweet, rich and fruity. Cherry isn't that prominent, with much of the flavour being caramelized sugars and molasses. Not overly tart, but with a hint of acidity. Malt is huge and works well with the kiss of hop bitterness in the back end. Alcohols well hidden.  M - Medium bodied with a slight chewiness and mild carbonation/  D- Heck yeah.

Some sediment was noticed suspended in the medium carbonation.  S: The nose yielded fresh ripe fruit, cherries being the most prominent with some supporting aromas of plums, candi-sugar sweetness and dates. Some alcohol fusels were also present.  T: The beer starts out with nice burnt carmalized sugar notes with light smoky hints. Some dried cherries, dates, alcohol fusels (cinnamon) and a good yeasty character rounds things out. There was a nice bitterness and some chocolate notes detected before the finish which was dry and velvety.  M: thick and viscous, with a light-medium carbonation with a very smooth texture.

There are small particles of yeast in suspension but nothing to get concerned about.  Aroma is rich and spicy with a little bit of fruit and a little bit of funk.  Flavor is big and strong, nice layers of black cherries, cloves, and raisins. There's an underlying funky flavor there that isn't familiar and makes me wonder if this is normal. It's a little earthy, a little sour, and a little unpleasant. Perhaps it's the yeast because their saison is similar in that respect.  Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style, medium-full body, good carbonation.  Drinkability is okay but not the best. High alcohol and unusual esters and funk make it a bit of a mystery.

42,3457,CrellMoset,3.88,"Appearance: Pours a deep hazy chocolate brown with nice lighter highlights, and a bubbly, foamy, volcanic-looking tan-colored head that gades into non-existence fairly quickly, as is typical for a quadrupel. Good start.  Aroma: Malty sweetness starts off strong - brown sugar, chocolate, a lot of nondescript dark fruit, some faint leafyness ... interesting, and I suppose inviting.  Taste: An initial burst of sweetness, but then the cherry really cuts the edge on this one, at least initially. It definitely mellows out and sweetens as it warms. I can definitely see the Dr. Pepper comparison, though I can't quite county 23 flavors - I get definitely black cherry (though that could be several distinct flavors tossed into one), vanilla, sweet, sweet chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, raisins and other dark fruits that are tough to differentiate from the other lighter stone fruit notes at times, and a leafy hop note that's as interesting as it is out-of-place. No heavier notes, and I gradually knocked this one up as I reviewed it.  Mouthfeel: Bubbly, fluffy, and spritzy, but it fades way and collapses too quickly to be considered a true Belgian ""sublimation"" kinda feel, in my book. Almost like soda. Ok, this one's getting a lot better as it warms. I served it waaaay too cold. Knocking it up a few points as it smooths and evens out. Pretty good, actually.  Drinkability: Ok, I really didn't like this one at first, but as it warmed (or as I got progressively more intoxicated?), it grew on me, though my score may not reflect that. This is one seriously strange brew - malty, fruity, light, dark, sweet, dry. It's definitely a study in contrasts, all with a hefty alcohol bill, though perhaps not for the style. I slowly but surely appreciated this one more as it warmed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,hoppymeal,4.03,"2006 Cave aged. Pours a murky rusty brown in color with a massive cream head that very slowly recedes with a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a nice breadiness, spice, cinnamon, rich caramel, raisins, and belgian yeast. Taste follows the aroma with some good yeastiness and breadiness, some sweet fruit, good dose of cherry and vanilla, dry hoppiness towards the finish leads into a spicey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, carbonation is light and soft, good dryness and a little pepperiness towards the finish at the back of the throat.

Head was a frothy beige, with nice lacing and good retention. Nose is quite complex - picking up cinnamon, some alcohol, and of course the great fruit bouquet of a nice Belgian.  The taste begins with a nice bready malt that really smothers the back of your tongue. There's a big punch of fig as well as some hints of plum. Ends with a nice warming yet subtle alcohol. The consistency is really quite nice as well, medium bodied with solid carbonation.  Definitely a sipper, but a very enjoyable sipper.

S: Very sweet and malty, but with some additional harshness from the alcohol. Dark fruits, some candy-like sweetness, but also a slight hint of musky, herbal, and ""funky"" aroma. I feel like the alcohol could be masked better, while still increasing some of the other aromatics.  T&M: Full and intense. Strong toasted, yet intensely sweet malt flavors with a tartness from the added lambic that provides a welcome addition to the complexity. Rather intense fruit flavors--some fig, plum, raisin, apple, all blended with a kind of earthy, nutty undertone. I really enjoy the flavor of this beer. The body is fuller than average, but still adequate. Fine carbonation creates a tingling, lovely effect.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Cylinsier,4.22,"Poured from a pint 9 bottle.  Beautiful cloudy reddish brown color.  Smells of fruit, specifically cherries and figs, maybe a hint of licorice.  Taste starts hoppy and ends a little sweet. There's a bit of alcohol apparent as it goes down.  The mouthfeel is good, mildly bubbly but very smooth going down.  Overall, great drinkability. Not my type of a beer but I'd definitely have one again.  Edit: It's been a while since I've had this one and I'd like to think my tastes have evolved, so I'm re-reviewing. This is from a 12 oz. bottle. Original attribute scores were 4.5/4/4/4.5/4.5.  Pours a beautiful deep ruddy brown, hazy with a thick finely textured yellowish white head which dissipates very slowly.  Smells of mild caramel malt behind a bouquet of fresh tart cherry.  Tastes mildly of fresh cherry sweetness, followed by an oak woodiness. Malts are rich but subdued.  Medium to full body with a velvety carbonation on the roof of the mouth.  Of course the batches will vary from year to year, but my opinions on the beer have changed somewhat. I'm much more appreciative of the appearance and aroma on this one now, but I feel the body ought to be a bit fuller for this style.

Aroma is a nice combination of dark fruits, with some cherries, but likely given the aging, not as much as in some other reviews. Medium, nearing full body, the flavor has a lot of dark fruits, some candy sweetness, more cherries than the aroma, adding a nice twist with a little tartness to balance the fruity sweetness. Certainly worth trying, a good take on a classic style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,lacqueredmouse,4.68,"2007 Vintage. Wonderful looking bottle. Caged and corked, decorks with a sucking thunk sound. Love it.  Pours thick as treacle, a gorgeous burgundy red colour with excellent clarity. Head is a consistent almost-pure-white crown of filmy bubbles. This is a majestic, serious looking beer - the colour is magnificent, and it looks like a wonderful, wonderful brew.  Coppery sour on the nose. Beautiful notes of Belgian yeast, roasted malt, and a citrus/fruit acidity that sets all the rest off nicely. Not overtly strong, but subtle and complex. Wonderful.  There's layers to the palate, all delicate, but intermingling in a wonderful way. An initial hint of alcohol heat is mellowed by a sweet, slick character like melted candi sugar. This in turn dries out a little, leaving a residual cherry-sour character that explores the taste-buds. Aside from this, there's a tessitura of citrus sitting above all, and a darker spicy undertone to everything. What a wonderful harmony of so many disparate elements - this is a magnificent brew, thoroughly delicious.  Mouthfeel is lighter than you would expect, like the strong Belgian ales in this regard. Doesn't leave the palate overwhelmed, which is what is required of an ale this strong.  Despite the strength, the lightness of the body, and the lighter, fruitier characteristics of this beer make it supremely drinkable. This is a truly wonderful brew. Not just one of the best Belgium ales brewed outside Belgium, but one of the best Belgian ales period.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I can't get over the quality of the carbonation or the taste and finish. Tops Bernardus for me. The cherries can be a bit medicinal.  Very complex. Cloves, toffee, cherries, apricot, plum. The cherries really come out as you get closer to the bottom.  Lots of loose yeast in the bottom.  Fabulous beer; I really enjoyed it.

Smell: Sour cherries and green apples with a slight muskiness. Slight acidity reminds me of some German white wines. Hints of vanilla and oak.  Taste: Wheat twang flows smoothly into the typical caramel maltiness of a Belgian Ale. Mild aged hops are next, riding on the backbone of slightly cloying alcohol. Some cherries in the finish, but I find them only because I know to look.  Mouthfeel: Higher than average carbonation level, appropriate for the style. Body is good.

A heavy malt taste, kind of sweet, has a dry finish but there's only a hint of roasted malts. ABV hidden well in this medium-bodied beer as there is no alcohol burn or warming sensation, just a smooth passing that contains said sweetness along with dark fruit taste.

Maybe my taste buds are not avanced enough for this Belgian brew, I don't know but you should buy it and try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Tdizzle,4.3,"2008 edition purchased at Vendome Fullerton.  A- Poured from a corked and caged 750mL bottle into a Chimay chalice, this beer pours an opaque deep-amber color with a decent amount of head that resembles the color of sand. The head settles to a thick layer that leaves some thick sheets of lacing on the glass.  S- Sweet malts and sugary dark fruits are supported by a moderate amount of alcohol with a trace of dark cherries off in the distance.  T- The taste is primarily of bready malts, Belgian yeast and candied dark fruits like raisins, dates, figs and dark cherries. The medium-dry finish yields a fruity flavor coupled with a malty sweetness. The cherry aspect of the flavor is beautifully understated.  M- The mouthfeel is generally full-bodied and smooth, but it's just a tad thin for the style and the carbonation is fairly aggressive. Everything evens out quite a bit as the beer hits room temperature though.  D- The 9.8% ABV is well-hidden. Nothing gets in the way of enjoying a couple goblets full of this beer.  My favorite beer from Ommegang thus far and definitely a must try for those who are a fan of the style. Highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,deanhead,4.58,"2006 Bottle- consumed May 2008  Highly carnonated, it poured a rich garnet color with a healthy head, and a brilliant lace of bubbles on the glass.  Aroma is that of cherry cola, no hop nose whatsoever. Right on the money for the style.  Taste of cherries, currants, raisins. Almost rummy. Rich, but not overbearing. Malty ayet well balanced.  Very smooth medium bodied beer that has aged well. Not so chewy but very warming.  It's highly drinkable, but not something to over indulge in!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,buffettfan,4.68,"Poured from the 22oz bottle, into a tulip glass.  Pours a dark red, almost ruby, with a head so thick, looks like you could walk across it!  Smells almost like a brandy, a sweet, fruity smell, with what my wife said ""you can smell the booze!""  Taste- WOW! A sweet, malty taste. Taste some of fruit in the finish as well. Man, this one surprised me. Awesome beer! I will make sure if I can, to always have some of this in the house! If I can keep a bottle long enough without drinking it!  A very drinkable, flavorful beer, one of my instant favorites!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,schoolboy,4.4,"When I get on a Belgian kick, this is my staple. It is such a nice blend of flavors, and they pre-age it for you. I have not aged any of this any further (there may be some in my storage, but I have not drank any really old ones). I would guess that it smooths out a bit with age, as it can be a little harsh and boozy. But this is definitely one of my favorites. I buy it over and over!  Revision - today, 11/1/2014, I am drinking a 2010. It seems a little less interesting - a little too mellow. I think this means one year is enough. They don't seem to be pre-aged any more either.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Don't know if the glass or my pour was bad but a very large head. maybe 2in length. The color a nice dark amber. Its laces pretty well and the head has stayed with me through most of the beer.  The smell is quite awesome, the smell of sweet fruits/cherries is quite abundant. The alcohol is noticeable as well.  Very sweet and malty. Don't let that fool you, you can taste some hops in there as well, along with that alcohol kick. A thick and syrupy mouth taste, rich indeed.

Tastse: there is quite a bit going on here! The alcohol is quite present, especially for on a 9% abv. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment though. Dark fruit sweetness, cherry and raisin, come through as well as some caramelish candy sweetness. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good. This is a sipping beer among sipping beers. Not my favorite quad, but a good one. I may buy again just for variety, but it won't be a regular purchase for me.

42,3457,tonytuffnuts,3.8,"Poured outta the bomber into the Abbey Ale-appropriate chalice. 1.5 finger head of pearly bubbles atop an amber body. A hue of light shyly smiles through the bottom of the glass. Mulchy malt whiff that gets sweeter the harder I pull--cherry and red-apple. I smell that Ommegang yeast, which rings up fond memories of many-a-visit to the brewery. The longer it sits in the open air, the more the fruit comes out and the alcohol dies (fruit's not as present in the taste as the smell, however). Sweet on the front of my tongue, a hop bark on the back, and toffee all over. Although it takes a while to oxidize, the balance of its parts levels after about 15 anxious minutes. A bomber is the right size, much more would be forced consumption. That being said, I would prefer a generous glass-full with cherry/blueberry/strawberry pie during holiday dessert.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Thunderball,4.85,"Poured into my Chimay goblet this beautiful red,amber liquid produced a one finger head. The smell was of the promise of just what this beer is, a rich Belgian ale mixed with a cherry Lambic. The mouth feel is creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation to keep it interesting. The taste is heavenly. I love the sweet malts,caramel, and the cherry-vanilla finish. Just enough of the Lambic coming through to end on a sweet note. Where the 9.8% abv is hiding, I can't tell. This is by far one of the best drinking experiences I have encountered. The ""breast milk"" of beer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JRed,4.2,"Dark amber nights with a cloud of off white head, a delicious looking beer. Smells of black licorice mixed with some chocolate kisses. Exquisite tastes of slight malt and dark chocolate with medium body. Midway through the experience comes a landslide of cherries that has an alcoholic punch at the back. Finishes much like a liquor with a touch of dryness and alcohol coating. A blend of great taste makes for an original personality in a beer, a fine specialty of brewing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bonkers,3.9,"I poured a 750 ml bottle into 2 large chalices to split with a friend. It poured a cherry/caramel color with a very thick white head. The head retention was decent with moderate lacing. My first impression of the aroma was of cherry soda, but later smells detected medicinal and alcohol notes. The first taste is a mix of alchohol and cherries, followed by a mixed bag of fruit. This is a full bodied beer that needs to be sipped, not quaffed. This brew is good, but definitely not something I would want every day.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

T: Once you get through the head...just a tinge of alcohol up front, which is quickly cut by the expansive malts, candied sugars, like caramelized fruits, dates, plum, cherry, light chocolate.

A nice rich complex flavor consisting of malts, brown sugar with a sweet and sour alcoholic rush. Subtle hints of cherry. Bottle states that this is ""98% Ale with 2% Ale with cherries added"" so I was concerned about a dominant cherry flavor. That was not the case as it blended in quite well. The beer is more enjoyable the more you get through the bottle. A sour presence constantly lingers. Even at 3/4 through the beer there is still a thin frothy lacing present on top.

Smell: Malty and fruity, subtle tones of cherry and alocohol.  Taste: Wonderful sweet malt taste, and undertones of cherry. balanced just right with hops so sweetness is not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully smooth and full bodied. Finishes creamy.  Drinkability: I absolutely love this beer and usually have a bottle on hand for when I get a craving. I've had this both fresh and then lightly aged. After 2 years the alcohol flavors and aromas tend to subside and not be as strong but still noticeable.

Now, because of the rich maltiness and fairly assertive brett flavors, this brew, like all ""sour"" or ""wild"" beers, is not one I can see myself drinking all the time. But it's a welcomed change of pace and, when I'm in the mood for it, I really enjoy beers like this. Three Philosophers, in particular, is especially drinkable given the added fruit sweetness, as that element adds an extra bit of balance to a malt-heavy style. The fruitiness also rounds off the edge of the intense brett flavors.  Highly recommended...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Taste: Malt sweetness and hot alcohol, cherries, chocolate with just a touch of bitter chocolate in the finish. Complexity is not there like I'd hoped. Still no disrespect to the brewers it's a very tasty brew.  Mouthfeel: My first quad, and it's thick and rich but not comparable to the Old Rasputin from last night.  Drinkablity: 7.99 at a local liqour store which is cheaper than I normally see it at 9.99 very tasty, but at practically 10% alcohol it's a sipping brew.

Caged and corked, have had this stored upright in a dark cool place just as the back label suggests for going on 4 years.  Opens with a decent ""pop"" and pours a dark caramel colour with a decent tan head that lingers.  Beautiful nose, rich and complex: Strong dark fruits like cherry and prunes mix wonderfully with cacao, leather, orange peel and other spices. Just gorgeous. As it warms/airs it changes, developing stronger fruit flavours.  Strongly flavoured palate that is a top mixture of chocolate, anise, cherry and fruitcake. So luscious, with a delicious bittersweet chocolate malt feel. As with the aroma, it shows it dark cherry side as time goes on.  Great texture, really round and full. Fantastic balance, so drinkable. A real creeper that is ever changing.  What a great beer. One can only imagine how far this could go in the cellar. A brilliant lesson in ageing beer. I am convinced - More quads required in the cellar. Another reminder of how far ahead the micro/premium beer scene is in the US.

Tastes heavily of bing cherry with a bit of cocoa and fig behind. Fairly vinous with a very faint oaky bitterness in the finish. In the end, I find the mouthfeel a bit too thick, lacking the effervescent lift I like in most Belgian versions of the style. It has some prickle but feels too syrupy.

After a few sips the sweetness subsides a bit and it's coming through as caramel malts, spice, and a touch of cherries. Finishes nice and tart but with a slight residual sweetness right before it.

Strong alcohol heat becomes present as it warms. Highly complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is slick and well-carbonated. Excellent brew, and fairly easy to drink despite the high ABV. Another winner from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,callmescraps,4.35,"Been holding on to this one until the special lady friend finished yet another architecture licensing test. Needless to say, we're both relieved it's over; this guy has been taunting me for months.  Appearance - A very deep amber with a solid quarter inch of head that sticks around for the duration.  Smell - A hint of orange peel and lemon, the belgian hopness is in effect. Also a little maltiness, with almost a hint of nutmeg.  Taste- Comes with a bitter orange taste, with some definite spice. It's got that nice belgian spice/citrus balance with some definite malt. Kind of a lemon bitterness on the finish balanced out by some more spice. A lot smoother and less bitter than many quadruples, but not sacrificing anything in terms of depth or complexity.  Mouthfeel - Highly carbonated, but smooth. Almost tingles on the tongue.  Drinkability - Pretty easy going down. Glad I'm spitting this guy, since I'd easily polish off the bottle on my own.  Dammit, I just love Ommegang. They make such fantastic beers (including the heavenly Hennepin). This is just another feather in their cap.

42,3457,MrHungryMonkey,4.12,"2007 corked bottle. Served at refrigerator temperature, allowed to warm throughout the (60 minute) review. Let round one commence:  Nose- Pleasantly tart/sour Belgian yeast with massive fruitiness. Vanilla caramel sweetness. Rich maltiness. Minor alcohol. Minor spicy yeast aromas. Smells both soft and sharp.  Look- Dark ruby-tinted brown color, highly translucent. Moderate head with poor retention.  Flavor- First sip brings a swift tart pucker to the jaws. Follows with delicately soft sweetness that tastes like malt, bread, and sugar (hard to describe exactly, stay tuned for updates). Wild sour flavors dance about the palate and tease the tastebuds. I can dig the cherry, especially really tart cherry. Powdery yeast flavors come and go, as do various fruits that I can't yet pin down. A soft, dull bitterness rises that reminds me of the peaceful earth-grounding tannins in green tea. Cantaloupe suddenly jumps out at me with musty melon flavors. More cherry sensation presents itself in the finish and aftertaste - kind of a fruit skin feeling. More sweetness, still hard to describe.  I just got a taste of hop tartness. Way down deep, hidden amongst the yeast flavors and alcohol, this tartness adds to the already roaring barrage against the malt. The malt, which is still quite shy, holds a steady footing against this attack.  Intermission- What a kick in the palate! The flavor evolves so quickly and is different on each sip. Fruit, fruit, fruit. Almost makes it taste healthy ;-). Now, on to my second glass and I feel great; let round two begin:  Deep, richer, darker roasted sugar becomes pronounced. Dark and bright fruit too - grape, cherry, kiwi, and so on (maybe it would be easier to list off the fruits that this beer doesn't remind me of). More tannic bitterness juxtapositions itself against the sweet malty malt. With all the tart and bitter yeast and hops working against the seemingly submissive malt and sweetness, one would think the balance was to the former. The balance, though, is quite even (perhaps even skewed a bit towards the malt).  For most of the tasting and sipping I get way more tart, sour, and bitter yeast/hop flavors than I do sweet or malt flavors, but the malt/sweet characters stay fairly constant throughout the entire sitting and the contradictory flavors are constantly changing, jumping around, and evolving in every sip. It's like I'm sitting in a racing malt boxcar watching the yeast/hop scenery go by. At every point throughout the journey, the view is balanced, but when I recollect over the time spent watching the hops and yeast speed by, my boxcar gets lost in the sea of memories.  Feel- Medium-to-medium-thick body, ample carbonation.  Final Thoughts- It's hard to believe this is 9.8% alcohol, because the alcohol flavor/feeling sure is well hidden. I really like that the label tells me strait out that this beer is ""98% Ale - 2% Ale with Cherries Added."" It's a proud brewer what can boast the blending of his beer.  The Verdict: A fruity, dark Belgian ale, different with each sip. Time spent interacting with this beer is phenomenally better than time spent just watching tv. The only conceivable downside is that with 1.5875 pints of anything 9.8% abv, one tends to have a hard time logging memories. I had a good time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,cvstrickland,4.25,"750 ml cork-in-caged bottle, poured into a goblet yields a hazy chestnut body with a brilliant sparkle of honey-gold in the highlights. A nice creamy finger of pale ivory foam settles atop the drink at a fat sheet that clings stubbornly to the glass leaving abstract swatches of fine lacing.  Smells of brown sugar-covered raisins and ripe plums, plus spicy cherries and a tangy yeasty note. Warm brown bread and cherry liqueur notes emerge as the beer moves toward room temperature.  Taste is sweet, fruity and rich with a substantial alcohol bite. Fruity flavors of cherry and plum are dried quickly by an astringent bitterness; dry, biscuity malt and tangy yeast complement a warm alcohol burn. Caramel flavors emerge and take center stage as the drink warms, as does a bitter crabapple note of alcohol plus another toasty, dry malt note.  Crisp when cold, the drink warms, seeming smoother and more medium-full bodied, even a touch syrupy and sticky in the mouth. A definite sipper, and plenty sippable.  As the drink warms further, the rich brown sugar evident in the aroma sidles up to the caramel leader, bringing an evolving alcohol flavor now much more smoky, grapefruity, and citric. A juicy flavor of ripe golden apples makes an appearance, rolling around with sweet, grassy hops and Granny Smith tartness.  I could go on, but as brevity is the soul of wit, I'll just dumb it down and say, ""This beer kicks a lot of ass in a lot of different ways.""

A= This ale poured a cloudy, hazy, dark mahogany color with tons of yeast particulates in suspension. The initial pour produced a big 3"" tan head which slowly dropped to a 1/4 of an inch. Moderate lacing down the glass.  S= I got funky Belgian yeast, phenols, black licorice, and faint cherries in the aroma. When swirled, this ale also released alcohol aromas.  T= This one tasted of sweet malts and Belgian yeast coupled with faint cherry flavors. The cherry was in there, but not overpoweringly so. Surprisingly little alcohol in the taste, but a bit of faint sour/tartness did show up in the finish.  MF= Medium-high carbonation gave this a lighter body and mouthfeel than it would have otherwise. Despite this carbonation, it felt creamy on the tongue.  D= I was pleasantly surprised by this ale.

Smell: Dark cherries pervade, with some apple cider on the back end. Candy sugar, alcohol, dates, grapes (less vinous-ish, more table grapes), banana, clove, cork wood.

However, honestly, there is nothing wrong with this beer. It is an excellent brew and all people that like Belgian beer should give this beer brewed over 3000 miles form Belgian a try. It has a nice dark color, pours nicely, smells good, and has a taste to die for. Unlike other Belgians I have enjoyed, this also has a great drinkability (sometimes I enjoy my initial tastes of a Belgian and i grows old half way through - but not this one).

Throughout the rest, you get fruit teasings (not necessarily the 2% added cherries though?) This finishes strong; and as usual, you get more alcohol towards the end. The best part about this brew is how well the mouthfeel adds to the drinkability. The aftertaste keeps you wanting more-even more than the taste itself!

It is actually the cave aged version which was cave aged in the Howe Caverns in upstate NY. According to the label attached to this bottle it was cave aged in 2006 at a depth of a 156 feet for 9 months at a constant temperature of 52 degrees. It also states that this brewery is the only American brewery that has cave-aged in over a century. They sampled both the regular and cave aged and said there is a huge difference.  The beer from a 750 ml corked bomber poured a dark brown/amber with a half inch creamy tan head leaving behind a nice layer of sticky webbed lacing covering the glass.  The smell was malty and fruity sweet with a nice earthy alcohol finish.  The taste was phenominal, an easy 5.0. Started with sweet/sour cherries mixed with raisins followed by a nice bready, earthy malt mix. Finished with a perfect alcohol warm finish.  Nice thick chewy mouthfeel with a sweet sticky mouthcoat.

T- flavor is nearly as nuts as the aroma, only with more chocolate. i would have like to taste a bit more of the lambic, but i'm sure the geniuses made it this way for a reason. tart cherry fruit up front is then slowly covered by melted chocolate and bitter cocoa powder and a dash of spearmint. malt is nice and roasted and the flavor profile is deep and with a noticeable cognac type alcohol bite, other references of this beer tasting like bourbon soaked fruit pretty much hits it on the money. the fruity sourness and the malt seem to blend seamlessly and is more than backed up by earthy limestone, damp rotting wood, compost, plum skin, and roasted nuts. the finish may be the best part, as roasted malt bitterness, melted dark chocolate, and faint black cherries seem to go on forever, bouncing off all facets of the palate.  MF- velvety smooth feel, a slight menthol coolness, perfect amount of fizz. leaves me with a real dessert feeling in my mouth without cloying, i guess the same as a rich chocolate cake topped with cherries, garnished with a sprig of mint and washed down with a russian imperial stout would feel...

A thin wisp remains with dots of bubble clusters stemming from a central spot of remaining foam, looking oddly like a fractal. Lace is spotty.  Aroma is excellent. Sweet fruits including cherries and creamy banana. Subdued Belgian spices accent toffee and nutty malts. Black cherry clings to the only slightly noticeable alcohol.  An exquisitely complex flavor. Sweet and sour dark fruits blend with an Earthy nuttiness. Spice lingers on the tongue after swallowing. Richly bitter hints of black coffee in the finish. Flavors become darker and malt richens as it warms. This is apparently a blend of 98% Quad and 2% Cherry Lambic, which is interesting. The cherry flavor is perfectly subtle, adding another layer to the as previously stated vastly complex flavor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,zdk9,4.1,"A- Pours out a nice brown color- like the color of black cherry wood. Not much head, and not much lacing.  S- Warm bready notes, like freshly baked puffy whole wheat bread. A touch of fruitiness, and a touch of alcohol.  T- Quite a complex taste which is greatly appealing to my tongue. There's a strong malt presence. And then some fruit swoops in from the wings- cherry, like kirsch. Very well blended. And then the aftertaste lingers on as the malt subsides, and the cherries take over, using the power of alcohols.  M- Too sharp for my taste, and though the bitterness in the aftertaste is okay, I would prefer more while I'm tasting.  D- Delicious tasting and I would happily have another.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,quad07,4.57,"$6.49 from UFS for a single 1pt, 9.4oz dark brown bottle with a cork. 9.8 ABV Bottled date 2007.  It was very exciting when the cork was popped. This beer poured into my large 23oz beer glass a dark brown murky color with a vigorous & tight large off white tan head. I was very careful not to stir up or pour the sediment from the bottom of the bottle. When the glass was held up to the light you could see dark cheery red highlights that sparkled around the outer edge of the glass. Lots of carbonation rising to the top.  This Belgium had a very pleasant but faint floral smell with hints of sweet fruit and nutty malt.  After my first sip I could taste rich caramel malt with a slight sweet fruity finish. The more I drank of it the fruity taste was similar to cherry and raisin. There caramel malt & some vanilla coming through also. There was no hop flavor to it that I noticed and the alcohol taste was not there either but I could start to feel affects of it very quickly.  This was a real treat for me because every thing was well balanced which made it very drinkable. I only wished I purchased two bottles because I was ready for more.

T-Slightly sweet specialty malt in attack with faint cherry and bittersweet chocolate and coffee midpalate, and warming alcohol in the finish. M-A little on the lighter side for style, with strong carbonation that creates an interesting blend of fizz and alcohol at the end. D-Good, but I don't feel the body was sufficient to carry through the strong malt character.

Had a full, off white head that remained for duration of the tasting.  S: Clean, slight black cherry aroma with malt.  T: Malt is the initial flavor with the slightest amount of alcohol. Cherries finish it off.  M: Smooth and rich on the palate. No lingering flavors and carbonation is perfect. The added lambic did not create too much carbonation.  D: I could drink this all day. From start to finish, this beer is almost perfect.  Be careful with cooling this beer, it loses a lot if it is too cold. If you don't have a way to regulate temperature, I would cool in fridge and leave out until it is a bit above the 50 degree cellar temp.

The head builds up to a thick pale tan head that bubbles down to a thinner layer that just covers the body. An inviting aroma of sweet dark cherries, caramel, malts and alcohol leads you to the first sip. Sweet dried cherries mixes with caramel and chocolaty malts, sour cherries, plum and raisins. All of these flavors are surrounded by a warming alcohol that fades off slowly with some bitter notes into the finish. The palate is full bodied, smooth and a little sticky.

Mild egg custard head that quickly dissipates to spotty flecks on the surface. It is the color of black cherries.  Smell is mildly sweet and malty with a hint of yeast spices. Taste has a solid malt base with a mild sourness from the blended lambic. Cherry skins are hinted at but never overwhelming. Alcohol is hinted at as well.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Not too dry and pretty drinkable.

The taste is sweet caramel malts that are cut fairly quickly by a some tart cherries that leads to some warming and a nice dry finish. The mouthfeel is nice and thick with a decent amount of carbonation and some pleasant alcohol warming.

Anyways, what I enjoy about Three Philosophers it that it's a heavy complicated beer, but it's so balanced and drinkable. It pours a deep mahogany color, which most closely resembles a dark tea, with a foamy light tan head. It has a very subtle scent, with slight cherry notes and a maple sweetness to it. The flavor ranges from a caramel nuttiness to an oaky barrel character. The finish is crisp and brings home the cherry undertones.

42,3457,GeoffW,4.35,"Poured from a 750 bottle into a tulip glass. Very dark color with a nice head and good lacing.  Smell is nice and malty with a touch of yeast to it. A little sweet, but I can't make out the 2% lambic in the nose of this one.  Taste is outstanding. Nice toasted malt flavors, and a hint of sweet that suggests maybe a touch of honey. Not extremely complex, but what is there is good. The beer does become more complex as it warms up a bit. The cherry lambic is a nice treat that comes out in the aftertaste if you look for it. Mouthfeel was very nice. This stuff is really smooth and is content to sit in your mouth in a civilized manner. Doing so also lets the cherry flavor out.  As with most Belgians, the drinkability is excellent. A great session beer for someone who can really hold their booze. I wouldn't recommend going and having a good piss up with beer of this quality, but it is easy going enough to where I could easily have 3 of them in an afternoon and enjoy them all.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Couldn't detect much hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, low carbonation.

Smell- Sweet candied fruit and alcohol really jump off the nose, quite pleasant.  Taste- Begins with a sweet fruit-malt flavor that spreads a lot of warmth through its alcohol. As the expirience progresses the alcohol begins to really assert itself as the sweetness begins to subside. Sweet, fruity and delicious.  Mouthfeel- Fairly good palate coverage, very smooth over the mouth and it leaves a pleasant aftertaste.

Head reduces but stays with the brew, leaving nice foamy trails down the glass.  S: Rich, complex malts, mostly caramel. Dark sweet fruit smells too like fig or prune, and a sweet hint aroma of candied brown sugar.  T: Interesting malt flavors, sort of a mix of pale and caramel malts. It's interesting that the the flavors start out a little stronger and fade to quickly to something a bit less, but no less complex. A little fruity, but not really sweet. There is a mostly dry finish and a some warming during the linger.  M&D: Relatively heavy mouthfeel but less than most dark Belgian styles, especially of this ABV. Carbonation is relatively light, which lends well to the creamy texture. Goes down smooth. I enjoyed the brew but I don't know if I could drink more than one at a time.

Yeasty nose... nice malt, dark fruits... sweet. Taste is quite complex... malty.. (Ommegang beers all share a similar malt backbone... kinda a brewery signature I suppose). Cherries stand out more and more the deeper you get into the glass. The alcohol warms you up, and the fruits really start to show their face. 9.8% abv is noticeable, but adds character.

42,3457,DmanGTR,4.87,"Never heard about this until I went into the Pittsford Wegmans' beer center, for $4.99 I couldn't resist... and I was not disappointed!  A - poured a lovely clear reddish brown copper color with a creamy white head that kept well until the last drop from the wine glass.  S - like many other reviews, I concur with a distinct initial cherry aroma, but I also get a hint of malts, grapes, and yeast, all adding towards a complex mixture with a touch of spices and burn of alcohol  T - where to begin?! The malty tartness is complemented with a dash of cherries and a kick of alcohol that is actually well hidden in the flavor. You get more of an alcohol ""texture"" than an alcohol ""taste"". Complex and bold.  M - medium bodied, texture is well emphasized especially by the generous carbonation.  D - I feel that this is a beer that we should consider for quality, not quantity. With that said, I daresay this is a most drinkable beer that is not for the faint of heart, nor is it a beer for the chugger. This is a classy beer that should be treated with respect and care.  Overall - After the first bottle was emptied, I bought another 3: 2 for cellaring and 1 for immediate use. This beer was the first Ommegang product I've had the pleasure to try and I was not disappointed. I hope their other brews are as good, if not better!  btw, I found this to go well at cellar temperature (or room temperature too!) with a light dinner (perhaps some Greek food or a chicken caesar salad) and mild cheddar cheese :)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Aroma of dark sweet fruit and yeast with a definite cherry influence. A bit like a Belgian but then again, there is a bit different aroma going on here.  Sweet and fruity with a bit of a booziness present that even the sweet tang of those cherries can't hide. The cherries add a nice sweet tartness to it that isn't present in other quads so this one is unique.

A strong beer, no question, but with a complex flavor, smooth and light mouth feel, extremely pleasant aroma, and very drinkable, provided you know how to appreciate a beer of this strength and style.  It's strong, which is evident in every aspect, but the flavors do not let the alcohol take over. Reddish-brown in color, with a minimal head and carbonation make this a fine sipping beer.

Also, some earthy, sour grains emerge.  t: Quads often have sour fruit flavors, courtesy of the yeast, without the addition of 2% cherry lambic. I'm not sure why the addition was necessary. It blots out the subtlties found in quads, and it lacks the kick of a full-blown lambic. I found myself constantly trying to see beyond the cherries, but it was difficult. I did find some sour apples, mild candied sugar, and alcohol. It does have a nice sour, dry finish.  m: Good syrupy body, but the carbonation is a bit fizzy.  d: This is by no means a bad beer, I'd just rather have a quad OR a lambic, not both.

It didn't take much vigor to create a luxurious head as suggested there. The body was deep red and brown, and the head was quite stable and frothy. Quite a bit of lace formed each time the glass was tilted. The smell was floral sweet with a ton of dark fruit character showing through as well. The taste wavered between sweet and dry and finished spicy. The blended nature of the beer was apparent in a mellow smoothness that muted some of the edgier and earthier tones found typically in Quadrupels. The alcohol was more of a factor in the taste than I initially expected it to be, and the warmth was quite noticeable after each sip. This was a well built Quadrupel with a lot of good facets.

T-Tart cherry, dark fruits, lemon, caramel, wood, brown sugar, toffee all make an appearance and then disappear quickly under a drying tart, yet semi-sweet, finish. M-Good carbonation, fairly smooth with a good medium thickness. D-It's a little strong to drink too many of these, but it's good tasting and pleasant. Easy to have more than one of the smaller bottles. Overall a tasty beer. I'm not a big fan of belgian beers, but this one is alright. Glad they have smaller bottles of this.

Not my favorite quad but quite interesting nonetheless.  M: Medium bodied and creamy, and pretty smooth.  D: Not my favorite quad, this one is to be shared.

Sweet smell with hints of fruit (cherry?) and possibly chocolate. Kind of heavy on Malt and perhaps dirt... but good dirt. Tastes yeasty, malty, and sweet with not much alcohol burn considering the ABV. Flavors described in the aroma are present as well. There are intense carbonation bubbles. It feels like there are thousands of them with each sip. Heavy and ass-kicking beer. A six pack should be streched out over a couple weeks and supplimented by lesser beers. Good Beer.

A thick fluffy beige head forms and coats everything it touches. Nice lacing and fantastic head retention.  Smells of cherries, chocolates, fine malts and a light grain alcohol twinge that tickles your nose.  The taste is a smooth fruity start. The 2% cherrie ale that the label states is apparent but not overpowering. There is a little chocolate that compliments a tart fruitiness. The malts are very much in the distance, not a roast flavor but just a warm sweet malt taste.  The brew feels good on the mouth. It has a silky creamy mouthfeel and a nice twinge of astringency that leaves you wanting another sip. The only set back is a slightly higher carbonation level that seems to strip the flavors from your pallet.

42,3457,manleyphoto,4.24,"Three Philosophers, Belgian-style blended beer, Brewery Ommegang, Cooperstown, NY.  As a beer, Three Philosophers is a bit of a strange duck. It is a blend of a typically dark, and high alcohol, Belgian abbey-style quadrupel; so called because of the high grain, and therefore high alcohol content, as opposed to a singel, dubbel, or tripel, combined with a typically tart cherry lambic. Honestly speaking the taste of Three Philosophers is more like 98% quadrupel and 2% lambic, but the cherries unlock a world of flavor.  Three Philosophers pours a deep reddish amber-brown with a moderate tan foamy head that disappears pretty quickly. It has a rich vinous wine-like character with lots of dark fruit, milk chocolate, caramel, and black cherry flavor. This beer is bottle conditioned which means there are live yeast cells in the bottle that both naturally carbonate the beer, and round out the flavors over time. Ommegang cellars their beer before it is shipped out to the store to smooth out any rowdy flavors and generally mellow out the beer. The bottle conditioning combined with the high alcohol content of Three Philosophers makes this beer a good candidate for cellaring one you buy it and I can only imagine the flavors will improve over time. The high quality combined with the very reasonable price of under seven bucks a bottle, easily half of what it's Belgian pedigreed cousins might charge for a similar product, make me want to pick up several bottles to try it out myself, if i can only keep my hands off of them long enough to see how they age.

Light brown and hazy.  S: Malty, not as much alcohol in the aroma as there was in the taste. Sweet malts and fruits, I guess the cherry. As it warmed, aromas came out a ton more.  T: Cherries and maple sap malts right away along with the alcohol. Definite strength in this one's backbone.  M: Yeasty with an alcohol that has clear taste. A little bit on the syrupy side.

Alcohol spiciness, and what comes through like the tiniest bit of a chocolatey finish. I haven't been a huge fan of lambics to date, but having a little thrown in there didn't seem to be a bad idea at all.  M: A bit biting on the tip of the tongue.... almost a little aggressive over expressive or assertive. Mellows after a few sips to becomes quite dry and crisp towards the finish.  D: It's a decent drink, though I prefer others over it... it is unique, I'll give it that.

Sweet sour maltiness but with a hint of alcohol as well. As it warms it smells a bit more of rubbing alcohol. Not a terribly appealing smell either. Taste is really rather dry, muddy and bland actually with alcohol definitely noticeable but i've had stronger alcohol tastes in less alcoholic beers. Cherry isn't really noticeable, but maybe comes through it the tartness rather than big cherry flavor. Reminds me of a cross between beer and wine. Like a carbonated wine almost. This isn't awful, but I don't see it being anybody's dream beer as its story and creation indicates. The best thing about this to me was that it didn't have the awful belgian yeast taste and smell that I really abhor.

Mouthfeel is a little heavy but creamy at the end. Drinkability is up there. I love it. A must pickup whenever I can find a big bottle.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The cherries were the main taste component I picked up. Also a bit of malt and Belgian yeast in it as well. A little overly tart for my taste.  Had a zesty mouthfeel due to typically high carbonation rate.  Like most of Ommegang's beers, Three Philosophers is a drinkable beer.

I have had this fine Belgium-style quad before and felt it fitting to offer my humble opinion now. The fine people at the Brewery Ommegang have really out done themselves with The Three Philosophers. I truly believe that their beers are very much in sync with their Belgium counterparts.  The Three Philosophers poured a deep rusty reddish color, wish a creamy off white head that quickly dissipated. There was no lacing on the inside of the crystal snifter, which has been the medium that I sample all of my beers in. The smell was sweet with hints of sour cherries and yeast. The taste was suburb both hoppy and fruity with a sour finish. This beer is a wonderful American take on a traditional Belgium quadruple.

A: There was a thick creamy light brownish head that left a thick clear residue on the glass as it faded. The beer was a very dark red-brown. Even with the dark color of the beer seeing through the glass is no problem.  S: From the first poor and the froth of the head released a powerful cherry smell. The smell of the malts and yeasts used are not over powered by the cherries, but heightened.  T: The years were good to this beer as the flavors seemed to come together. The cherries seem to be of the dark variety. They mix well with a sweet, almost sugary, and a spicy yeast. The malts tend to give it a little sour backbone and keep it from being to fruity.  M: Feels very think on the tongue, but the carbonation keeps it from being flat and boring. There is enough carbonation to make it seem like the cherries are dancing in your mouth.

Nose is moderatly citrus-hoppy with light yeast undertones (dough). Can also smell elements of Cherry/Casis, port wine and cinnamon. Taste starts lightly bitter with elements of fruit and over the long duration finishes moderatly sweet. Wait even longer and there is a slight nutty aftertaste on the rear end.

About a quarter inch of foam quickly settles to a ring with some activity in the center.  A wonderful combination of tart cherries and bread are the first notes I can detect. Then I get the spicy yeast with dark fruits. Clove, a bit of cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, and a touch of alcohol is my attempt to make my description a little more detailed.  The taste is very similar to the nose of this beer. Cherries soaked in alcohol, heavy bread, spices, and dark fruits. As I continue sipping this beer it reminds me of the strawberry-walnut bread I make sometimes (it's good by the way).  Heavily carbonated and a little sharp on the tongue. There is also a touch of alcohol that hangs around for a while in the back of the throat. After the beer warms up a bit the mouthfeel is a little better but I still think it's a tad over-carbonated.

42,3457,BigRedN,4.15,"Appearance: Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Following the bottle suggested pour, I poured softly so as to not disturb the yeast (at least not too much). Still I was able to produce an off white head nearly two inches in height on top of the hazy, brownish red liquid. It takes a while for the head to fade to a solid cover which leaves some lacing.  Smell: Rich malt aromas, still somewhat yeasty as well, bready, with cherries, (black cherries). Also comes off a bit boozy.  Taste: Big and malty; a touch yeasty/bready and a bit sweet. The blend of a belgian style ale and a cherry lambic (thinking Sam Adams here, yech) had me dreading what this beer might be, but it turned out great. The cherry-ness does not overpower.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with what seems like a natural low carbonation. A clean (low aftertaste) finish. The alcohol burn comes through on this one.  Drinkability: A good beer, but a sipper. I do not know if I could get through a 750 ml bottle due to the alcohol (nearly 10%!). This bottle is nice on a cold, snowy night.

Pours with a relativly thin slightly off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a fine white collar around the glass. Minimal lacing is left behind.  S- Nose is strong of cherries, alcohol, chocolate, caramel, and a spicy Belgian yeast strain.  T- Upfront is sour cherries with sweet caramel malt backbone. Spicy Belgian yeast and alcohol emerge for the finish and seem to make the initial flavor disappear. All of these components linger equally-which is the highlight of the flavor. The intricate complexity of all these characters that don't usually mix together plus the addition of sweet chocolate. It's good and it really makes you think.  M- Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is mostly smooth and yeasty with hints of an alcohol slickness/burn.  D- This is a very interesting and complex brew that I do enjoy-but the blatant booziness of it all keeps the drinkability above average-but less than ""good.""

Not as spicy as a lot of Belgians. It's fairly complex, but not as complex as I would think a quadrupel should be. Still, quite inviting.  Taste- A big malty, bready, taste up front with some yeast and spices in the background. Some dark fruits, but not at a level to where you could identify them. A nice subtle sourness as it slides down the gullet, with a nice hop flavor. Amazingly, there is little alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel- Medium to heavy body. It's syrupy enough to give you a nice lingering after-taste. Yum. Not as carbonated as a lot of Belgians, but that is a good thing. This one is quite nice. A bit astringent towards the end.  Drinkability- Quite nice. I haven't tried a lot of quadrupels, bt if this one is a good example, I'll start seeking them out.

Similarly, the beer is sweetly malty and with a slight cheery flavor (as advertised), but the sweetness arrives first, but the rest of the finish carries the maltiness of the beer. Eminently drinkable with a medium mouthfeel, slightly carbonate, and a smooth texture. This beer actually meets expectations. Excellent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I would have liked the cherries to be up front a little more, but still a very nice brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ppoitras,3.56,"750ml bottle from BeerTruth via trade. Thanks for the opportunity. Cave-aged, corked and caged, 2006 vintage.  Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1"" tan head above the vigorously bubbling reddish brown brew. Very dense head stands tall, with sporadic chunky lacing. Aroma is sweet ,alts, sour cherries, and alcohol. Taste mirrors the nose, although the alcohol is brash at the end, in a rubbing alcohol sort of way, and shouts down some of the flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are quashed for me due to that alcohol character as noted. Not quite what I expected this time around.  (5/4/4/4/4, 4/4/04) 750mL bottle from Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA. Presentation corked and caged, as illustrated in accompanying BA file photo.  Poured into an Ommegang gold-rimmed chalice, formed a dense inch tall tan head above the deeply reddish-brown brew. Aroma is quite yeasty, with it's other main essence being the whiff of the cherry lambic. Excellent lacing as drinking commenses, and the taste is pretty much as expected, with a heartier mouthfeel than you would expect and also a lessening for the tart mouthfeel that you would expect from the cherry lambic. It seems the quadrupel ale tastes are upfront, with the cherry flavors wandering along afterward, giving the aftertaste an interesting change. A novel product from Ommegang, and worth the trouble to obtain, for occasional enjoyment, but not an everyday in my book.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The nose is nice, smells like it came from belgium. dark fruits with the slightest cherry hint. Taste is quite thin. The dark raisin flavors are there and the candy sugars are there but kind of weak. The finish is ok and has a very coppery taste. The taste does not linger well. Mouthfeel is quite thin for a quad. A very good shot, but just not belgian! The cherries dont add alot of flavor.

After settling a bit, the body looks like a glass marble or something, layers of colors swirling inside - gorgeous.  Strong alcohol in the nose, coupled with cherries. It's almost like cough medicine, sort of a turn off. Almonds come in, bits of dates and raisins hide among hops and more alcohol. There are bits of cedar and pine buried in here. Sort of smells like my musty cellar, which I would love, but that alcohol is just too much. There are bits of lemon zest and oranges inside this too.  The taste is a step up, less alcohol, but still very much a part of the flavor. Cherries are major, raisins and hops, dates, cedar, almonds, chocolate and tobacco. Nice.  This is silky smooth, great feel. Moderately carbonated, slightly sticky. There is a great warming feel to this. This is my kind of beer.

42,3457,deapokid,4.4,"Even though I was a Central New York resident for 99% of my life, I never really got a chance to try too many of the local brews. I've done Middle Age's Syracuse Pale and Wailing Wench, but I only tried Ommegang once and I was 19 and more interested in getting drunk than enjoying the Abbey Ale's subtle nuances. Seeing the Three Philosophers sitting on a shelf at Wegmans, I figured it was finally time to give Cooperstown's favorite brew serious consideration.  A bold smelling drink with a sweet fruit aroma juxtaposed with an obviously high ABV, this quad coats the tongue like caramel featuring just the right amount of hoppy zest. I was absolutely amazed by the complex taste and feel, noting its alcohol power while sensing roasted nuts and cherries. The coloration was also pretty profound, initially looking brown and murky, but turning to a festive red under bright light.  This beer was a total delight from beginning to end and it got me really excited about the great beer scene going on in the CNY.  *Update from 1/22/2010:  Just tried the 2009 edition and was equally amazed.

Cherries, loads of dark malt, chocolate, raisens, a treat.  Taste: Predominatley... smooth. So smooth. Silky. The style of this beverage has been embraced by this brewer, and they have done well.

42,3457,Zraly,4.28,"Vintage 2004 - Opened on December 1, 2007  After holding onto this gem for a few years, I decided to pop it open tonight. This is a wonderful treat and I have thoroughly enjoyed sipping on this through dinner and onto dessert. I had a steamed artichoke with mayo and worcestershire sauce as an appetizer. Dinner consisted of crusty french bread, brie, and a touch of slow roasted garlic olive oil. I am going to top off my evening with some liqueur-filled chocolate covered cherries. My advice is that this ale is best served with food.  The initial smell is a subtle funk. It pours a medium, opaque brown with a bit of a rusty red tinge to it. Minimal head, but with nice lacing in a St. Bernardus chalice.  The taste is out-of-this-world mellow, malt heaven. Dried fruits and a soft ""leathery"" note. The lambic holds its presence in the finish, with a tart, juicy hint of dark cherry juice. Some phenols float around to give some spice and fullness on the palate. Earthy, smooth, and warming to the belly. Carbonation sustains and prevents this from tasting too syrupy or having any cloying effect. Outstanding.  I love that this is a domestic selection. Ommegang has hit the mark with this Quad. Classy and classic. I suggest that you buy a few and cellar; this will be well worth your effort and patience.  **2007 Vintage -- Opened on November 12, 2010. I have aged this in a cool, dark place for almost three years.  Pours a deep, rich, dark burnt amber with a thin, but tightly-bubbled, head. Notes of rum-soaked cherries (or how I imagine them) and a whiff of alcohol up front.  Good God -- this is delicious. Smooth and deep. Rich flavors of dark rum and fruit. Slight sour note in the finish. Sour cherry. This drinks like a tawny port. Alcohol is completely hidden, which makes it dangerously good. A fabulous example of the Belgian Quad -- straight from Cooperstown.  This ale does wonderfully aged, as my previous review shows. I've actually yet to try it ""fresh,"" and maybe need to put that task on my list. And for the price, this beats most wines, hands down.  I can drink this alone by the fireplace with my sweetie cuddled up next to me. Great with Flemish beef stew. Venison would go nice. I can also imagine it with dessert courses as well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Quite a complex aroma, with a nice strong maltiness and very evident kriek influence. Standard quadrupel notes of dark fruits like raisin and prune.  The kriek manifests as a very dark black cherry flavor with a little bitterness to it. Again, the other 98% of the beer is quadrupel, so you get the standard raisin, prune, plum, dark strong malt, currant, and chocolate notes.  Smooth mouthfeel, good carbonation. Rich and luxurious body. Not a lot of booziness despite the high alcohol. Very easy to drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The smell is dark malt, cherries and other dark fruit, and alcohol. Really inviting aroma.  I was surpised how evident the alcohol was in this beer. I think it dominates with the malt and fruity elements only noticed in the background. It does have a bit of a wild funky taste that makes this beer rather unique. Medium bodied with good carbonation ease consumption but the alcohol warming may be a little too much. Definately a sipper.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Attractive argyle-pattern tap handle is recognized immediately as Ommegang, a slightly different color scheme than Hennepin, very classy. Pours with a small head into a tiny 3 Philosophers chalice. I'm guessing 10 oz., but wouldn't be surprised if it was 8 oz. Color glints ruby red through a chestnut body. Some lacing as this kiddie goblet is drained.  Aroma of Belgian yeast, malt, and stewed cherries. Kind of funky, it's restrained but nice enough.  Caramel toffee flavors, black cherry, low bitterness in the finish is the only indication of hops in the finish. Medium bodied with perceivable drying alcohol. It's about what I remember from the bottle I had a year or so ago.

A decent off white head fades rather quickly, however good sticky lacing. It looks so inviting.  After admiring its beauty I must take a long draw thru the nose. Not disappointed in the aroma, even after the magnificent view. It smells of dark fruits and sugars, I am also getting hints of licorice. A few more sniffs and I pick up on the alcohol aroma. Subtle hints at the yeast are also present.  Very smooth, full-body. Semi-sweet again with the dark sugars and fruits. The malts are very pleasant and the hops are on the mild side. The cherry-Lambic is present but very subtle. The balance is phenomenal. Along with the marvelous flavor you get a throat warming feeling from the 9.8% Alc./vol.  The mouthfeel is excellent as one should expect. It is so silky smooth and easy to drink. Carbonation is low to moderate but complements the warmth very well. It is very pleasant to sip on.  Very very easy to drink. I was very impressed with this beer. I would not think twice on purchasing another bottle of this fine brew. Highly recommended to any BA.

Very appetizing smell.  T - While my girlfriend felt it had an aftertaste of soy sauce, I felt the traditional Belgian ale flavor came through well. The taste of cherries came through only slightly, but the light carbonation made the flavor enhancement of the cherries come though a little more than usual.  M - the beer felt amazing. It was't too heavy. A light feel of the beer was great in the mouth and went down very easy.  D - It's a great beer to sample and try.

I love quadrupels and I really like lambics. This....is just not for me. The mouthfeel is silky and carbonated, right on the money.

42,3457,BWH3,4.26,"Three Philosophers Quadrupel Brewery Ommegang Large Corked 750mL Bottle from a Goblet at 50 F  Interesting concept of 98% Belgian Dark Strong Ale and 2% Lindeman's Kriek (a classic cherry lambic directly from Belgium) blended and bottle conditioned.  A: I have to give it to Ommegang the aesthetics of their beers are amazing. The beer pours a beautiful hazy amber brown ale with moderate carbonation creating a medium sized beige head. The head dissipates at a steady rate into gorgeous clinging ring and stable island of foam (5.0)  S: This beer has terrific aroma. The Special B is unmistakable. The raisin scent dominates the initial sniff. The cherry and sour aromas breathe up from the depths of the beer accompanied by a mineral/earthy note. A touch of caramel/bread-like sweetness rounds out the scent. Some detectable spiciness from the yeast or notes of Munich malt would make this beer more complex. Overall malt aromas could be bigger from a Quad. This seems to have the malt aromas of a Dubbel. (4.0)  T: Great translation of the scent to the palate. The prune/raisin and caramel sweetness hits the tongue first followed by the sour cherry note. The bitterness of the hops comes to neutralize the sweetness. The finish is not really strong. It is neither dry like the Trappists nor sweet like the Abbey styles. Bitterness perfectly balances sweetness. Again the overall strength of flavors could be stronger for a Quad. (4.0)  M: This is how a Belgian Ale should be. Good carbonation, accompanied by a light body compared to the sweetness and alcohol content. Well done. (5.0)  D: I really enjoyed this beer. I find this more in line with a Dubbel with a special twist than a Quad or Belgian Dark Strong in terms of richness of flavors. Everything is well balanced and very enjoyable. At less than ten dollars a bottle this is a terrific deal. (4.5)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Gehrig,5,"Simply one of the best beers I've ever had. This creamy, smooth flavorful Quadrupel from Ommegang comes in a 25.4 oz. as part of a pack that included Rare Vos and Hennepin, as well as a complementary 12 oz. Ommegang glass. What a delight. It pours a beautiful, rich, three-fingered head with a cloudy reddish amber body--gorgeous. The aroma is a melange of fruit and spice, mainly cherry and a hint of cinnamon. The taste is an excellent balance of the fruitiness of a Quadrupel, with modest spiciness. There is a slightly roasted flavor to it as well, yet nothing overbearing. Cherry is prominent, as is orange, and the fruit blends expertly with a modest amount of pepper. Its creamy texture makes for an easy beer to consume, though its high ABV (9.8%) is something of which to be mindful.  With Ommegang, this is my favorite product from the Cooperstown-based brewery. It does not disappoint, packs a smooth punch, and is right at the top of domestic Belgian-style beers. It's also great for sharing and sampling, and easy to make converts to it. Nearly perfect, in my humble opinion.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,blakesell,4.06,"Poured off the tap into a belgian tulip.  Appearance- Beer pours a dark red brown with a large head that rises all the way to the top of the glass. Lacing clings to the glass throughout.  Smell- Cherry upfront, then raspberry and candi sugar. Almost no hop presence whatsoever. A slight earthiness that I can only assume is hop.  Taste- Belgian sour cherries with candi sugar and lingering bittering hops. A slight hint of chocolate ties the beer together. I'm on the fence at this point on weather this or the bottle is better. Sugar content seems a bit more subdued in the bottle, but there is more freshness and hop on the tap.  Mouthfeel- Slightly sticky, creamy, full-bodied, slightly sour and fully carbonated. Suprisingly not warming considering the high gravity.  Drinkability- For me the drinkability on this one is high. I give it a 4.5 on these grounds.

T: Smooth and tart berry and then a deep caramel with a subtle wooden and savory aftertaste.

Aroma was slightly sweet, with a hint of cherry, wood-like, with a hint of spice and alcohol. Very pleasant on both accounts.  Wow, what a beer. The cherry lambic certainly shines through first, with a stern tart cherry taste, but it is quickly followed up by a rigorous dose of cloves, flowers, and raisins. Everything is so complex, yet works in perfect harmony. The finish is sweet with a warming alcohol that isn't overbearing. Mouthfeel is full, and carbonation is kept at a minimum.

I know enough that this needs to be poured into a goblet or chalice. Well best I have is a nice crystal whiskey glass.  A - really dark color. it's really near opaque. Poured a nice head which dissipated in time. Kind of impressive.  S - really sweet, more like a wine. It's fruity and kinda boozy too.  T - more boozy than what I typically drink (pale ales and IPAs). Not as sweet as the smell. Taste doesn't hang too heavy. The cherry flavor is really subtle. this is more like a wine in taste as well. I'm not much of a wine drinker but I'm ok with this tonite. I was in the mood for something different.  M - Smooth and light for it's appearance. Slightly bubbly.  D - This bottle might be enough. Glad I experienced it tho. As mentioned this is very different than what I usually drink. I'll enjoy the bottle tonite, but I don't think this bottle will be a regular thing.  ok. If I were going to make a beer out of a cherry fruit roll-up, this would be it.

I'd like it better if it was slightly thicker and maltier; its still slammin, dont get me wrong.  The first glass was right out of the fridge and a little too chilly, now I am on my second which is warmer. The malt and spices come through better, I'd recomend letting this one sit a while before drinking it.

The retention in the head is very very good. The color ranges from dark ruby brown to light brown at the neck of the glass. The smell is Belgian candy sugar and spices. There is also some clove in the smell. The taste is lighter than expected. The sweetness is not as much as you'd think, the clove stands out in the aftertaste with spices in the background. The taste is nice, but the aftertaste is bitter with sweetness still on your mind. Overall I would have another one, just not very soon.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Excellent !!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Cyberkedi,4.77,"Color is a beautiful reddish-brown. When I first popped open the bottle, the aroma was very strong and malty with an alcohol nip - it said ""Drink me!"" very clearly.

Smooth and mouth-filling, this is one delightful ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,roan22,3.8,"This beer I tried for the first time at my tasting club's 'Belgian Night.' I remarked that it tasted like root beer a little, with a little bit of cherries. It is soda-ish, and I appreciated its effervescent qualities, as the alcohol content is so high. A quad would be a beer I can't handle well, so I had about two shot glasses worth. I would drink this again, in a small glass nonetheless, but I am proud of myself for at least trying different and bigger Belgian beers .",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,jakon,4.12,"750ml bottle (2007) purchased for $6.99 on 9-24-7 at Cedar Hills New Seasons.  Pours a dark ruby-ish brown color with a sizable loosely packed tan head that steadily collapses on itself leaving splotches of lacing in its wake. The aroma is unique. Very complex and difficult to pick out individual scents. Dark fruits, cherries, fresh cut wood, yeast and caramel meld nicely. The taste was surprising and almost offensive at first. But it finishes cleanly and I find myself quickly going back for more. There's so much going on with this beer that I'm having a hard time dissecting it. The alcohol is hiding backstage waiting for the final act to reveal itself. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, yet there is plenty of prickly carbonation. This is a good beer that I will surely revisit. I'll likely grab another bottle or two and forget about them for a few years to see what happens.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Taste has the sweet tartness of dried cherries with spice and a slice of bread. Mouthfeel has full body to it with a good carbonation.

42,3457,Patrick999,4.02,"Poured into an oversized wine glass - what can I say, it looked like a quadrupel, no question. Head was nice at first, fizzled quickly.  Smell was very good, especially as it became warmer. Lots of caramel malt, but also sweet cherries. The addition of cherry lambic has done this beer well.  It tastes like a quadrupel....vinous, lots of sticky caramel malts, somewhat flat mouthfeel (which I'm never all that fond of...I wish quads could be more prickly somehow)...but again, the addition of the slightly sour cherry keeps this from being a garden-variety quad.  I don't drink quads often, but this probably just became my favorite. Of course, I have a St. Bernardus waiting to be sampled...but based on what I've tasted of Ommegang's other brews, they truly know how to do a Belgian-style beer. And you can't beat the ridiculously low price.  A very good dinner-party beer that won't burn a hole in your wallet. Yet another beer you can safely hand to your wine-drinking friends.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell was strong, full of nuts,spices,fruit and alcohol, overall nice pleasant complex aroma. Taste was strong as well, this is a sipping brew. Light cherries & sweet mild malts masked the alcohol flavor well, but the warm feeling gave away the abv. Nice warm , bready taste with an arrangement of varying spices, and a real mild fruitiness which I prefer. Mouthfeel was a nice medium body, with a warm alcohol feeling. This is a strong brew, one is a enough for one evening.

Nose os crazy strong toffee malt, lots of spiciness too, and light dried fruit. Taste is similar, lots of toffee malt, some alcohol presence (although it's fairly well covered for a near-10% ABV). Cotton candy, dried fruit, and a touch of licorice. A light hit of hops at the back end. Body is full and creamy with fairly low carbonation, although it works here nicely. I liked this one a lot, although it's not quite in the same league as some of the really mind-blowing quads out there.

It has an almost opaque body of rich mahogany and maroon hints. The tan head thins out swiftly.  Scent of cherries, with a malty, chocolaty hint.  On the tongue there's cherries, some milk chocolate, and to my surprise, a small hint of mint. Theres just the slightest hint of bitterness and alcohol on the finish. But wow, I dig this.  It's not filling really. It has the mouthfeel of say, vermouth but not nearly as alcoholic.

Aroma: I didn't notice cherries specifically but fruitness prevailed nonetheless  Taste: Smooth and mature textured without overabundance of sweetness. The cherries appear to have taken off some of the bite of the unassuming appx 10% abv brew. Should hve let is warm up a bit, could tell there was alot left back with colder glass  M; Creamy and easy to quaf down with minor acidity towards the end.

42,3457,dnichols,3.93,"I poured a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a challis.  A: Deep amber red. The head is creamy and beige colored. The fluffy abundant head held on deep into the experience and formed a healthy lace down the side of the glass.  S: The aroma was dominated by the abundant sweetness of the malts and the fruity odor of cherries. As the beer settled the sweetness was complemented by an earthy aroma and the fruity odors turned to more of reminiscent of plums.  T: Sweet and malty but more bitter than I expected. It finishes with the flavor of cherries that reminds me of childrens cough medicine. There is a surprisingly dryness to the finish that leaves an unpleasant sour aftertaste.  M: Moderately filling, warming, and fruity in the mouth. The carbonation was spot onnot too dominate but sufficient to refresh.  D: This is a one and out beer meant to be an after dinner drink that one can linger over as the evening progresses. Its a fine sipping beer. However, a second one would be too much for a single drinking session.  Comments: A very likeable beer.

42,3457,SkeeterHawk,3.48,"They recently brought this beer back to Texas, but this is a bottle that I have had in my closet since before it was here. It is about a year old 2006 version when trying it.  Appearance: Pours a pretty hazy chestnut color with a bit of a Burgundy hue. There was a thick 1/2"" of tan foam at first that was made of small bubbles. The bubbles fall back into the beer within a minute or so to end up as a small island of bubbles on top of the beer to last for some time. There are quite a few bubbles rising to maintain the island.  Aroma: I initially get a good bit of cherries along with a dark caramel aromatic that gives way to an almost woody impression. I can pick up a very faint amount of hops in here that comes across to me as grassy more than anything. The beer gets a lot more toasty as it warms.  Taste: This beer is a whole lot bigger in the flavor than I suspected from the aroma. It was so much that my palate got confused. I know that there was huge sweet caramel malt in here as a backbone. This is masked quickly by the high carbonation as it fizzes across the tongue on its way toward the inevitable stomach. There is some cherry and mild astringency (Oxidation?) to the beer as it leads into the finish. The finish is dry and spicy from the alcohol and attenuation, and there is a defined alcoholic warming that sets in and has no intention of going anywhere long after the sip. Up to the next sip, there is still warming, dark caramel sweetness, and a dry cherry lingering on the back of my throat.  Opinion: This is a very complex beer. I definitely like that it has a whole lot going on in the flavor. The alcohol is a little distracting for me in that it is so strong that it has a tendency to muddle all of the flavors a bit. I have had the beer fresh, and I seem to recall that it was easier to drink. I am assuming that was from the oxidation, and is not a vintage thing. It says on the label to enjoy immediately, and I would take that recommendation in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,counterpart9,4.32,"Poured from a 750mL corked bottle. The head which forms is strong and sticks around for a while, with great lacing on the side of the glass, while a cloudy dark brown billows underneath.  The smell is a complex maltiness with a little herbal hints.  The taste reveals a bit more of the herbal smell through a very smooth and wonderful mouthfeel.

42,3457,Maracuja,4.3,"A blurred, glassy burgundy below a short-lived khaki bonnet. Fumes of bourbon drenched cherries, bananas, permanent markers, maple and moss. Burnt prunes yield to smoked kiwis, which succumb to charred figs, fended off by blackened raisins. Covered in toffee sweetness, sugarcane and esters of banana. Cotton candy airiness towards the center; Rum-soaked pound cake later on. Towards the finish, a chlorophyll sensation materializes. Green ponds in August, with tire swings and lilypads. Ends lightly chocolaty, rum-sweet and algae-like. Medium-thin body with sparse carbonation, yet enough to keep this from being overly sweet or cloying. Easily, and thoughtfully consumed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,yemenmocha,3.28,"Pours reddish brown with enduring head and swirls.  Nose is sour brown ale like, with some fruitiness and fresh bread.  Palate is a rather ordinary sour lambic, perhaps sour brown like New Belgium's la folie, but with a modest amount of the cherry kriek in the mix. Honestly I can't figure out why this beer exists, and why it is reviewed so highly. It tastes neither like a traditional quad, nor like a good fruit lambic. It's almost as if it was a mediocre quad so they had to add the cherry lambic to offset the poor results. Nothing extraordinary here other than the cool name and bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,srroos,4.32,"Found one last bottle marked 2005 and picked it up. Poured a slightly cloudy reddish brown with little head (there was more of a head when I poured more after the bottle had warmed a little). Smells absolutely incredible, hard to describe other than distinctly Belgian with a hint of cherries. Taste reminds me of Chimay Blue plus the sour taste of the cherry lambic. Very good beer, but found myself wishing I had someone to share the bottle with. Aside from the drinkability, a top notch beer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Jmamay22,3.97,"The carefully poured twelve oz. bottle shows a brown red with a thick creamy tan head that eventually settles out to thin cap tha leaves occasional spotty lacing along the sides of my snifter.  Smells of absolute funk and mustiness with extra funk. In the background there are hints of the cherry tartness and sour fruit. A unique blend that is a little more funky than I anticipated. Very Belgianesque.  First half of the glass lacks the depth in taste typically found in a quad. Begins tasting sweet and finishes with tart cherries. Maybe I should have let it warm more, but it was close to room temperature at pour. After generating some warmth additional notes the brew opens up. There are hints of fig, prunes, plum, sweet cherries, tart cherries, and dark rum. Each flavor melds and works well with one another rolling from one flavor into the next.  Mouthfeel comes off as being a little thin with a bit too much carbonation. Both of these would likely improve with aging and I may buy a single for this purpose. I don't see this as being typically drinkable even given the style, but one is more than enough.  Perfect amount of cherry lambic added. Its not overwhelming but adds character to the brew. Its not a typical quad, but worth a try at least once. Ommegang has always been a great American brewer of Belgian beers, but I'm mixed on this one and may have to revisit in a few years.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,edskirk3,4.2,"A single 12 oz bottle, bought at the brewery last month.  Pours into a Duvel glass a deep soulful ruby shade. Thick, full creamy head on top. Very sticky and lots of lacing.  Aroma is lighter than I had anticipated. Slight alcohol, cherries, fresh mint, bread, and malty sweetness.  Let's see how well I can describe this. There's so much going on. It's earthy, sweet and chocolaty. Dark grains, some tartness coming from there. Also a definite presence of cherries supplying their own tart flavor. Creamy chocolate, nearly milky. Chocolate and cherries. Yes, I surely dig that meld of flavor. Presence of alcohol is negligible.  This is seriously hitting the spot and I think a large part of that is drinking it at the right temperature. Heed what it says on the bottle: try it lightly chilled. And pair it up with some cheese for Pete's sake, even if it's just sharp cheddar.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,elinash,3.97,"12 oz bottle poured into a goblet.  Appearance is the least tempting quality of the beer. It's a deep ruby brown with minimal head and lacing after the initial pour. Aroma is caramel and tart cherries. Taste is rich with chocolate, plum and tart cherry, but the cherries are light and balanced with the overall complexity of the beer. Mouthfeel is pretty good, if a little lght...and maybe that's alright for this one because it's pretty drinkable. I've tried it as an ice cream float and I tried it at Ommegang's Belgium Comes to Cooperstown 2007 with a ice cream laden tart. So, dessert pairings with it are necessary.

I can detect a slight hint of the lambic infused with this beer, but also a sweet doughy aroma as well.  The taste of this brew is a medly of cherry, molasses, and a metallic tartness.

42,3457,albern,3.8,"This is a very fine quadrupel. Mine was from a smaller bottle with no cork, so I'm wondering if the company may have downsized the quantity from the 750 ml. It pours a very dark brown, hazy color with a reasonable head, decent retention and some lacing. You can almost see the candied sugars in the glass. This is a medium to full bodied beer and has the carbonation to go along with it. This is a Belgian style for sure. The smell is sweet malts, some raisin, some caramel, maybe other fruits as it warms a bit. The color seems to mellow as it warms as well. The taste is strong malts, warming alcohol tones, some raisin, cherries, and some caramels. There were some pepperish snaps, but these seem to fade as the beer mellows. The down side is that the alcohol is too prevalent. The after taste is mild, and the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It is just the overly strong alcohol tastes that compromise this beer for me.

Smell is malt-syrup, raisin bread dough, English toffee, dried cherries, cinnamon rolls and pepper. The aroma brightens up as it warms.  Taste is toffee and cherry, both tart & sweet. Bready and brandy-like. Pepper notes come up near the finish, which is crispy dry-sour, long and tingly. I want to say watermelon, but can that be?  Mouthfeel is tingly, warming, rich and smooth.  Drinkability is fine in consideration of the relatively stout ABV.  A real treat from this New York partner of Duvel.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The aroma was pretty floral, maybe lillies, mild with a hint of cherries. The initial flavor was of brown sugar and malt with a little sour yeast that grades quickly into a long-lived complex aftertaste that picks up the cherry lambic. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with creamy texture and very active carbonation. Overall, this is a solid beer and is not overly sweet despite the lambic addition. This makes a great dessert beer that stands up well on its own. We tried it with dark chocolate truffles toward the end of the glass, and it seemed a little overpowered.

42,3457,diego,4.05,"2006 vintage  I was a little too excited pouring and ended up with half a glass of sandy brown head. It smelled strongly of yeast with a background of nuts and spices. The color is like maple syrup: deep, rich brown in the middle with orangeish red hues at the ends. It tastes thicker than most other beers. Caramelized malt and yeast hit you full force. Hints of berries and nuts round out the flavor before returning to caramel in the finish. I dont think Three Philosophers should call itself a quadrupel. It is a unique beer that doesnt fit well with other quadruples. It has its own wonderful style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Budro,3.96,"First time trying this one. Picked up a 2006 vintage 750 ml bottle at Smitty's in Valdosta to supplement my Sunday beer stash. Smitty's keeps this beer out on the shelf, not in the cooler, so when I got home, into the fridge it went. Now it's Sunday, and I've popped the cork. A: The label's illustrated instructions recommend pouring this one into a snifter or goblet, but pint glasses are all I've got. That said, the body of this beer is colored a deep red-hued caramel, like a rich cordovan leather. It's dense nearly to the point of opacity, but without being cloudy or hazy. My first pour didn't yield much head, though a sheet of foam retained across the surface till the end; second pour into the same glass yielded a foamy two-finger head that quickly dissipated. I could hear the foam crackling. Very little lacing, but when it comes to lacing, I wonder what to attribute to the qualities of the brew itself and what to attribute to the qualities of my dishwasher. S: I don't have a great nose--no Proustian reveries for me--so take this for what it's worth. Cherries are prominent, but I don't detect much else. I can smell the jacked-up ABV beneath the cherry-scented mist. Smells good, but even with my weak nose, I expected to detect a more complex interplay of aromas. T: Mild cherry cola front, quickly displaced by a pronounced and enjoyable bitterness in the back. The front lengthens as the beer warms. The sweetness fades as well. The warmth from the alcohol emerges as the bitterness fades. It lingers pleasantly. M: It's worth only 10% to the aggregate score, but the mouthfeel is one of this beer's best qualities--IMHO, it's where the craft shines most brightly. Brisk carbonation, especially when it's at its coldest, almost like champagne. Feels thick but not dry, creamy but not sticky. The alcohol warms the palate and sparks a nice glow in the belly (what about ""belly-feel"" as a separate scoring category?). The palate tingles and feels clean after you swallow. A hint of hop oils keeps the palate moist in spite of the bitter finish. D: In ""Osso Buco,"" Billy Collins writes, ""the lion of contentment / has placed a warm, heavy paw on my chest."" Finish 750 ml of this brew and you'll know what he means. With the high ABV, the lion starts sneaking up on you after only a few swallows. Although the flavor is surprisingly mild and light, you won't open a second one unless you want to make jelly of your brain. Regardless, popping the cork and passing an hour or so with this brew has proved to be a most delightful experience. I look forward to enjoying another one on a cold, rainy winter day.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I can smell cherries and chocolate, with some oaky and earthy notes as well as something sugary (perhaps caramel?) T: Rich and malty, much like the smell. Tastes of chocolate and caramel covered cherries, but not outright; its all masked beneath a smooth and full maltiness. Very unique taste. M: Warming and filling.

Aroma: Deep fruit and alcohol notes, with hints of wood, rather like cognac, also subtle dark cherry notes.  Taste: Opens with a wave of dark cherries and wood, with a strong undercurrent of spicy phenol alcohol. Midway trough the taste, the oak notes ascend, while brown sugar and molasses provide a gracious accompaniment. The high ABV of 9.7% is so gracefully presented, as to be almost obscured, leaving nothing in its wake, save a gracious warming note. Finishes with lingering notes of mild hops and earth. The flavor is both extraordinarily complex and superbly well-balanced.  Mouth feel: Smooth and full, very soft, and quite pleasant.  Drinkability/notes: Superb in its complexity, rivals the very best Belgian-brewed beers.

Sort of tart and fruity with less Belgian character than expected. Well balanced, but oddly had little bitterness or hop flavor. Thought the mouthfeel was average as was the drinkability.

A little bit of alcohol heat on the finish.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,fightingirishcmk,4.25,"A: Hazy amber/copper in color. Poured into a Duvel glass, and a great amount of long lasting creamy head was obtained.  S: A slightly subdued yet beautiful bouquet of sweet smelling malts mingled with a cherry, raisin, alcohol, dates, and reminded me that yes, this is a quadrupel style ale.  T: Quite tasty, sweet, with notes of cherry, plum, alcohol, and malt.  M: Slightly chewy and creamy, and very smooth.  D: Quite strong. The taste was ever so slightly subdued which I believe actually promotes its drinkability. I would drink it again if given the opportunity.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,DoubleJ,4.07,"I celebrated my 22nd birthday a few nights ago with one of these. From it's 12 ounce bottle and poured into a chalice, on to the beer:  Copper to red in color with a nice two finger head. In the body, a glimpse of sediment floats around. Smell reminds me of black licorish, yeast, spice, and cherries. The first thing you think when this beer hits your tongue is how much cherry is in the flavor. The beer actually has a bit of cherry lambic mixed into the receipe, but it sometimes became cloying. More black licorish, with touhes of bourbon and banana. A sweet treat to end my night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,willjschmidt,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a St Bernardus goblet.  A: Pours a dark brown with reddish undertones. Decent tan head forms on top leaving a little bit of lacing.  S: Some malt sweetness in the form of dark fruits and brown sugar along with just the slightest hint of sour cherries.  T: There are some very interesting layers of complex flavors in this brew. It starts out tasting like a quad. Rich malt flavors (figs, toffee, etc.) but the entire time there is a slight cherry tartness lingering in the background. Towards the end is where the kriek really starts to break through resulting in a tart finish and aftertaste. The cherry lambic is really rather subtle throughout the entire sip.  M: It's creamy and smooth, just as any quad should be.  D: A very interesting experiment of a beer and certainly worth a try. I enjoyed it but not as much as I'd enjoyed pure quad's in the past.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ballenc,4.05,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a large goblet  A - Opaque with a brown/reddish hue - likely from the cherries. Towering two fingers of off-white (top) to tan (bottom), rocky head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving little to no lacing.  S - Initial fig-like sweetness. Then strong malt aroma. Not as much alcohol overtones as I expected. Additional dark fruit (plum/dates) notes.  T - Not a bold and forward as I expected - also not as overpowering from an alcohol standpoint. Similar to the aroma - malts and dark fruits such plums and figs. A slight hint of dark chocolate. Somewhat flat and lacking in carbonation.  M - More medium bodied than other Belgian Quads I've had recently (e.g. Koninghoeven/La Trappe). Not as sticky sweet as others I've tried. Overall, very smooth.  D - Although I was expecting something bolder (stronger), this is a very satisfying quad - particularly for those that prefer a less sweet, less heavy dark Belgian. I'd love to try this on tap.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BrewSomerville,3.57,"In the aroma I get some grapes, cherries, plums, dates, raisins and a little hint of sweet chocolate. Alcohol is obvious in the nose.  It looks dark brown with orange highlights and some haze. Big light-biege head that fades down to a thin cover quickly. The thin cover of head lasts until the end, and leaves a little bit of lace.  Tastes sweet at first with a tart/bitter finish. Alcohol is made obvious to the palate, and warms you up as you enjoy the Beer. It is vinous, and quite fruity. Fruit flavours are the same as the ones in the aroma.  The mouthfeel is good, but would be better if the carbonation was toned down a touch. The carbonation is more prickly when it first enters your mouth and then becomes softer as you hold it in your mouth. It is full bodied.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The aroma is of prunes, dates, and cherries. The taste is of dates, prunes, caramel, malt, and has a hint of cherry. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a high level of fine carbonation.

42,3457,PCmofo,4.52,"I have seen Ommegang beers in my local Wegmans for quite some time now and just passed them by. This may be due to their obscure location in the cooler or maybe my unwillingness to explore outside of the standard 12oz and pint servings of beer. My friend turned me on to this company and wow is this beer amazing. No, its not the every day drinking beer but rather something you can sit down and enjoy a bottle of with a friend, it also goes great with a cigar as the potent aroma and taste still make their way through the smoke to your taste buds. In the same way that good scotch is great after being aged this beer gets better and more flavorful with age. Only downside really is its a bit gassy of a beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Some spotty lacing left on the glass. The smell is of dark cherries, figs, carob. The taste has a big cherry hit due to the added lambic, the sweetness is offset with a nice roasted malt backbone, has hints of tobacco. Maybe just a hair too sweet. This is a very flavorful brew. The feel is well carbonated and well bodied. The drinkability is scary with the 9.8% ABV, this goes down way easy.

Other dark fruits are blended in there also. Toffee and light chocolate malts with some grass hops to help balance it out come through also. Some sweet caramel also hidden in there with maybe a little bit of Belgian sugar. Alcohol lightly tingles the taste buds and warms throat gently. M- Medium/full body with medium carbonation.

42,3457,thebreadguy,3.91,"My first review - and I'm feeling the pressure!  I've been enjoying Brewery Ommegang's Abbey Ale for a while, and was looking forward to trying this one. I was certainly not disappointed. The beer poured a beautiful medium brown color with red highlights. The aroma was a bit more subdued than I would hope for, with some nice malt aromas and a hint of cherry way down deep. It did open up over time, though. The flavor was very pleasant and nicely balanced, but rather hard to get a handle on. Definite caramel notes, and cherry of course with a moderate but enjoyable alcohol presence. I drank a 750 ml bottle through a roast pork dinner (an excellent pairing) and the cherry flavors changed with each course - modest when alone as an aperitif... more obvious with the main course and then absolutely popping with the chocolate cake dessert. The mouthfeel was as it should be - chewy and rich, but not overly so.  All in alll, a very drinkable brew. I don't think I'd undertake more than 1 of the larger bottles at time. I'm looking forward to picking up a 4 pack of the 12 oz. bottles so I could include a smaller portion in an evening of multiple delights.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Maerzen,4.33,"I decided that I needed a good choice for my 20th review. Happened to have a 12oz bottle of this (from City Beer Store) in the fridge so it seemed fitting.  It poured a wonderful dark amber. Darker than I was expecting, but still amber with golden highlights. Nice cream head after good pour but not much lacing afterward.  The smell was difficult to pin down as it is very subdued. Although it has cherry lambic added, at first the only thing I could pin down was a slight hint of pear. About half way through the glass the cherry finally started to come out with a touch of chocolate. A nice sweetness without overdoing it.  Nice taste. Caramel and malt up front with a hint of the alcohol at the end. One thing I like is that at 9.8% the alcohol isn't as present as say a strong porter or stout. It is a bit carbonated.  Very enjoyable. It seems to need to breath like a good wine; the complexity continues and changes as you drink it.  Very glad a friend from Cooperstown introduced this to me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,onehomesickalien,3.3,"I am not the biggest Quad fan, but I do appreciate a good one when I come across it. The biggest problem I had with this one was the addition of cherry Iambic. This seemed to enhance the already existing sweetness to a level too high for me. It was also a bit too carbonated for my taste. I did appreciate the warmth of the alcohol and its beautiful ruby red appearance. Definitely not a bad beer (better than many) but there are Quads I prefer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Great looking beer.  S: Sweet smell up front, with cherries and other fruity hints. Some caramel. An unforntunate subdued nose. Seems to border on incredibly complex and incredibly mundane.  T: Sweet up front, with some cherries. A warm alcohol finish with small bitterness. Malty with hints of caramel. Another part of the brew that may seem to border on complexity and mundaneness, but for me it is really well balanced for 9.8% blended quadrupel.  M/D: Fair amount of carbonation, a little thick on the mouthfeel. Great sipper, 9.8% concealed well enough, drinkability is surprising.  Incredibly complex/ambiguous beer.

T - Starts fruity, both light and sweet and also a deeper oily fruitiness. The deeper oily fruitiness retains through the whole taste, but becomes slightly sour toward the end. Fruitiness shares the spotlight with the same rich and caramely malt character as mentioned in the smell.  M - Consistency is a bit thinner than I would have liked, but its not terrible.

Very powerful aroma that I could smell even when the bottle was a couple feet away.  Taste starts off sweet and alcoholic and quickly disappears into a watery taste. Not much to write home about here.  Overall drinkability was average. The high ABV is masked fairly well and the beer goes down easy. However, the lack of taste doesn't make the beer particularly enjoyable or unenjoyable.  This is one of the more disappointing quads I've had.

42,3457,jar2574,4,"2007 Vintage. I got this beer on the first day the store put it on display. I was quite excited to see a new belgian style beer.  Had to pour this lovely beer into an oversized wineglass, it's the best I could do. Nice dark brown color. Nice head, and lacing coats the glass all the way down.  Smells great, I can smell the alcohol and some sweetness. It has a nice, warm taste that gets a bit hot if you take a deep gulp. The alcohol isn't overpowering though. A touch of sweetness, perhaps from the cherry lambic they add to this beer. A bit yeasty upfront, and if you roll it to the back of your tongue you'll get a cola flavor. That's a lot of flavors rolled into one beer!  Nice level of carbonation. Quite a chewy mouthfeel. A slight buildup in the back of the throat is my only downer with this beer.  Very enjoyable.

A - Strawberry blond colored ale when backlit with an eggshell hued head the generates a moderate amount of lace from the appealing microfoam.  S - a mellifluous, unctuous blend of aromas: cherry, spice, belgian yeast, wood and caramel.  M - an extremely active and yet gentle bouyancy is felt. Sweetness steps up, as it fades creamy and bitter textures are felt in the finish.  T -- A spicy yeast flavor gives way to sweet fruit flavors as very subtle cherry tastes are surrounded with effervescence and a sweet tangy essence presents itself with a natural caramel/sugar flavor. Vanilla is another pleasant spice that is interwoven into the enticing tapestry. It is like art in a bottle-subtle shades of tart and bitter combine with hues of sweet and fruity. Only as the ale becomes warm does the alcoholic muscle stretch out and dazzle the palette. A clean but earthy woodiness is experienced which ties in well with the quote imprinted on the label: ""Philosophy begins in wonder"" I have no doubt of the inspiration for the splendor contained in this ale. The complexity and dexterity of Three Philosophers is a true tribute to the skill of the brewers and blending at Ommegang  D - A great pleasure for my taste buds. Sweet, strong, balanced and complex - a great example of a hybrid of styles done with inspiration and skill. A superb fruit blend with Quadruple punch. Not gentle in heft, but graceful and sophisticated all the while. Perhaps the most drinkable Quad I have had. Versatile to the extreme.

Three Philosophers pours like dark amber-maple syrup, and while sipping it, it's almost as thick. About the only beer I've had which is thicker would be various barley-wines. The aroma is complementary to the flavor in that you get a hint of the cherries, but it comes out when sipping it. I say sipping it because it's kind of like a bourbon, too strong to quaff, but the characteristics come out when sipping it.

Taste is slightly sour, definitely fruity, with a respectable hop bitterness, and a slightly sweet but dry finish. Alcohol is covered well in the taste as well. The slight blending of cherry lambic into this beer seems to be responsible for much of this beers unique flavor. The only place this beer loses points it the mouthfeel. Feels sharp. Too much carbonation. The good news is that by the time I got to second half of the bottle, the carbonation had calmed down considerably. I would definitely recommend opening this and letting it sit for a few minutes before pouring. You can tell your wine drinking friends that you're letting it ""breathe"".

There's a nice dry, sweet finish, no doubt from the cherry lambic that's been added to it.  M - Fairly smooth, although the alcohol comes across here again and hurts it, IMO.  D - Very drinkable for something that is almost 10% ABV, but I know of other beers near the same content that are much more drinkable than this.  Overall it's a very good brew, I'm not disappointed but I don't know if I'd pick this up again. It was good, just nothing that overly impressed me. It pretty much tastes exactly like it should, like a belgian that had some cherry lambic added to it. I think I'd be more happy to just have the quadruple part of the beer and skip the cherry lambic.

42,3457,mithrascruor,3.42,"750 mL bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy brown-reddish-copper color with a small, foamy light-tan head. Gradually becomes a film, but doesn't leave any lacing.  Smell: Has a nice aroma of malts (sweet), a bit of dark fruits, and some spices.  Taste: Rich and malty, but there's very little complexity or other flavors here. Has a proper amount of sweetness. The other flavors (though minimal) tend to not come out until the aftertaste with cherries and some bitterness... plus the occasional hint of alcohol. Underwhelming.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is more than I would like -- it's intense, but thankfully not sharp. Medium-bodied and rather smooth.  Drinkability: Though strong alcohol-wise, it seems to be generally well-masked. The carbonation is a turn-off.  An okay attempt at a Belgian ale. Flavor is pretty lacking, but it's not bad.

The smell of good, trademark quadrupel spices with a light cherry scent. The taste begins with a thin mixing of the contents, spicy yet smooth with rich, thick dark cherry finish. Interesting how the cherries are light in the scent, but strong and dark in the taste. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy, chewy enough to bite down into. A good sipper, but the dark cherry aftertaste puts a very slight damper on the drinkability but not enough to keep me from going for this one on several occasions.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BretSikkink,4.23,"Hazy brown brew, look quite dark but then the yeast sediment added a little lighter brown. Good head retention and lacing, pretty nice for a quadrupel.  I get some herb-earth aromas, aniseed and clove. The malt is present but nothing is overpowering, dark fruits mostly.  The flavor is quite incredible, there's milky chocolate malts which leads to a noticeable black cherry presence, creamy clove (almost weissbier-like) in finish. Also some medicinal alcohol tempered by flavors of sweet lighter fruit peel. This was served quite warm, almost room temperature when opened. I slam all the sediment in after a vigorous shake with the bottle, which may account for the bubble gum and clove flavors here, I remember it cold as having good balancing hop characteristics, popping carbonation, and being a thick but inviting kiln-malt cherry bomb - slight bitterness, a little sour, and not too much sweetness. But there's huge flavor nonetheless: it has the fruity yeast component of a tripel, the dark fruit and sweet malt of a complex Belgian strong dark, and a silky smooth hefeweiss finish for drinkability.  Wonderfully complex and drinkable beer, I would love to see this on cask and if I can put it down I'll save a bottle or two for next winter.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BuckSpin,4.35,"Presentation: c.2005 750ml wiretop bottle in an oversized crystal snifter  Poured lush & hushed, with a semi-thickness and a subtle crackle. Deep, dark nose, full of fruits like dark cherry, raisins, fig, dried currants. Malts are thickly & deeply caramelized, deeply sweet but not sugary or burnt, traces of yeast bread. Soft spice is noticeable, but no where near what one usually encounters in a Belgian style ale, or from Ommegang. A fat finger of mixed, crackled, slightly sculpted cream hued foam snapped subtly, eventually fading to a thin sheen, then a glass ring that laced faintly. The body is a deep, brassy-rudy mahogany amber, looks thicker than it is, a striking hue, made even more so with the slow dance of bubbles rising thru it. Thus far Ommegang has crafted some nice eye candy.  Its so beautifully filled with caramelized malts and lush dried fruit, bordering on the edge of a mild cordial. Many of the fruited nose qualities carry over onto the tongue - raisin, dark cherry, dried currant, even some fig and maybe a whisper of apricot hiding in that caramel. This is a malt bomb, a real lush sipper, but the slight spicy crispness (echo of black pepper) and the carbonation keep it balanced. Some faint spice is there (clove, nutmeg, ginger), but very faint. Bready, but more quick breads like a muffin or pound cake in feel, thick, not so yeasty. As it warms on the palate a wonderful semi-sweet milk chocolate quality emerges from the malts, mixing with the other tastes (now subdued but still present) in a slightly syrupy sweet elixir that can best be described as a lightly spiced, aged properly, and well ""soaked"" with fruit cordial Xmas fruitcake. Not that abomination full of whatever the hell those green fruit thingamabobs are, but a REAL fruitcake made months ago from a handed down recipe and aged in someone's cellar until Christmas Eve. This is like that in a glass.  It finishes as it started, but with a warm coating of the mouth in a semi-syrupy bath of all the aforementioned, only now you add in the pleasing warmth of the alcohol to ""bake"" everything, with a slight lean to the fruited qualities & the caramel.  Amazingly, pared with some triple chocolate cake as a match, the cake triggered a lot of the hidden spices to ROAR to the front, as well as the alcohol...not what I expected but very nice!  This was just luscious. A beauty in every respect, a true malt lover's brew and as close as you can get to a great Holiday dessert in liquid form. Outstanding. Will definitely keep a bottle or two around for special meals or a great treat. Highly recommended!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Tyrawlings,4.18,750 ml. Bottle poured into a snifter glass.  A: Dark brown in color with ruby red hues. Dense off white head pours two fingers thick. Good retention. Sheets of beautiful lacing that cover the sides of the glass.  S: Sweet malts. Grain. Dark fruit. Herbs. Cherry. Asprin. Alcohol.  T: Very thick and sweet malts dominate the front end of the sample.

Dark chestnut brown with big foamy tan head, recedes slowly leaving little wisps of lace here and there.  Nose has lots of malty sweetness, root beer/cola notes, and soem underlying winy black cherry notes.  On the palate it is not as complex as I recall from an on-tap serving I had last year...rich and malty, fairly sweet but not cloying, a solid example of a dark brown Belgian ale but doesn't thrill me.

42,3457,CortexBomb,3.37,"Dark/red toned brown with quite a head on it, took some time to pour out a full glass of it. Smell is cherry tinged malts, with a definite sweet edge.  The flavour on this is a smooth malty quad with a touch of cherry and a bite of spice and a mild sour tone. It's not bad for the style, but not particularly remarkable either. The cherry adds some depth, but the base of the beer is not particularly remarkable.  Mouth, some bite, but not a lot. Drinkability, decent but not spectacular. Not hard to have a glass of, but more than that would be pushing it.  The bottom line: not a bad blend, but I think I would rather have a straight quad, or a straight cherry lambic.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Notable belgian yeast flavors, fresh berries and sticky malts at first taste. Extremely well carbonated, and dry like an expensive champagne. Mild hops come through in the finish, along with a yeasty sourness that evens out the sweetness. Interesting blend- the quad style mixes well with the lambic berry flavors- a very refreshing brew with a deceptively high abv. Not my pick for Ommegang's, best but well worth a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,GregMcQ,4.38,"Pours with a decently carbonated head; cream in color; maybe a half-inch in all. Color is a nice clean and clear brown-rose. The smell on this one is good... low on hops, high on malt, with a sweet undercurrent that doesn't overpower the smell or the taste of the beer. In all, just from the smell you can tell that this is a BIG beer. The taste... it's richer than most American Belgian style beers (which is a good thing); a tad bit too carbonated, but that's just me being nitpicky; it's got that aforementioned sweet undercurrent going without being overpowering.  If you're a Belgian Quadrupel fan, and you don't want to go all the way to Belgium to get a good Quad, then this is a pretty decent fill-in. Personally, I love quads... this one really does do the style justice. I bought this in Houston, and amongst several other Ommegang beers (which are all good in their own right) this is the only one that was depleted to just two left in the store (and, of course, I bought both).  Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of quads; and even if you're not it's still worth a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bluejacket74,3.5,"750 ml bottle, brewed in 2005. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with a small tan head. It smells like cherries, pepper, and other dark fruit. The aroma wasn't very strong. It tastes spicy (pepper and cloves) and like cherries, herbs, caramel and dark fruit. Finishes bitter, peppery and sour, and a bit dry with some alcohol warming too. Mouthfeel is medium, with a lot of carbonation. It's also a little bit slick. Drinkability is OK, but would be better if the carbonation was lower. Overall I think it's good, but I wasn't impressed with this beer. That being said, I'd try it again in the future but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,cro250klr,3.7,"My first blend. After reading the bottle, I see that Lindeman's Kriek is used in the mix. Kreik isn't on my top ten, so I didn't know what to expect.  The pour is really nice, a copperish/brown with a tan head.  The smell is rather complex. Malt, cherry, banana, dirt, and a whole lot of other musty stuff. A whirl wind of aromas.  The taste is pretty much the same. It starts out on the lighter cherry side, a bit tart, then comes the malt and banana. A hint of sweetness starts then it fades to a slightly drier finish.  This has a really smooth mouthfeel but the complex blend of flavors leave me wondering, "" Do I really want another one of these?"" I really can not figure out what to pair this with. It's would make a for a great appertif but, to complement a meal?  This one may just be to overly complex to make it a session beer. It's not the 9.8 ABV that scares me, I've had much higher and have made a session out of them .

42,3457,rallison,4.35,"Served from a 12oz bottle into my brand new Gulden Draak goblet at just under cellar temp.  A: Dark reddish brown with a 2 finger off-white head that sticks around nicely.  S: Ohhh, nice! Dark fruits, cherries, candi sugar, rum. Smells delicious.  T: Wonderful use of cherry lambic. Cherry flavor (with just a touch of tartness) is there in the background. Nice candi sweetness up front with some prune flavors. Bit of a port flavor in the too. Wonderful blend of flavors in my opinion. Ultimately, this excels at blending some nice more subtle flavors together.  M: Good, relatively full mouthfeel for a quad. Medium to highish carbonation gives the swallow a tickle. Some alcohol in the background (but it does provide a nice warming).  D: Very, very drinkable for a quad. The great balance leaves me wanting more after every swallow. Maybe I should've picked up the 750...  Highly recommended. A wonderful take on the quad style (and by an American brewer no less).

42,3457,beertastegood,2.52,"Pours a reddish gold with a head that quickly collapses.  Aroma: woody, tart, musty, earthy, peppery, fruity (cherries of course), but solvent. As it warms, a caramel-like sweetness comes out, along with a slight chocolate note.  Taste: intense phenolic notes, candied fruit (think fruitcake) pervades the palate with a slight mustiness. Alcohol comes on quite strong here, and not the good alcohol either - I'm talking fusels. Fermentation seems to have been run a mite too hot. The cherry essence is there, but it gets buried under an astringent, pepper-and-clove mess of flavors that leads into a finish that is surprisingly tolerable. Almost wine-like, and not in a good way.  Mouthfeel: medium body, high carbonation. Slick on the tongue (fusels again?)  Drinkability: Not so much. And by not so much I mean not really at all.  Disappointing - I have been looking forward to this beer and was happy to hear it had landed in Texas. It *could* be a good beer - IMO it just needs more attention to fermentation of the base (98%) beer and blending.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

A smooth, even, creamy looking head, two-finger, tan colored head is also impressive. The head never dissipates fully and leaves a 1/8"" in depth at all times. Pretty amazing.  A very sweet malt scent with cherries, red-grape juice, brown sugar, nutmeg, green herbs and subtle spices.  A giant candy-sugar malt, herbalized chocolate that's wonderfully sweet with some mild heat. The fruitiness is great, with Pacific Northwest Bing Cherries when they're sweet, red grapes, raspberry and a mild current of nutmeg. This has an amazingly complex flavor...allow this one to warm up closer to room temp because many subtle flavors pop out. The complex flavor is wonderful with sweet red fruits and mildly spicey, herbal hop balance. Overall: Yummy.

Estery and tart fruit aromas mixed with a little bit of alcohol. A hint of cherry can be detected.  Both smooth and tart at the same time. The malts lend a toasty core along with sweeter fruit flavors. A bit of tart cherry flavor mixes in. The alcohol makes its presence known, but it is not overpowering. The smoothness is matched by the creaminess from start to finish, with little bitterness. Phenols are low.  Ultra complex and a thrill to drink.

The aroma is full with a very floral sweetness. Like rose petals and sugar. There is just a tinge of acidity.  The first taste strikes me as very spicy. There is certainly a clove character. I also get the impression of mint. The finish is sour with a bit of alcohol bite.  This one sips pretty light but burns going down until about mid glass. I can't picture drinking this regularly.

42,3457,objectivemonkey,4.52,"A 750mL bottle bought straight from the source on a cool autumn day, carted carefully home with 11 bretheren, a beautiful bottle and label, a 2005 vintage thats been sitting patiently in my cellar for two years. Here we go!  Into an Ommagang chalice, pours from the bottle like a golden elixir, settling to a dark brown to deep ruby red with a light tan quarter inch head, very soft looking, receding to a lovely thin film. There is light bubblies floating steadily up from the bottom, lacing falls in sheets, leaving little but shine and a few bubbles left on the sides. I remember the head being a lot better at a younger age, but this is quite lovely.  Aroma is a lovely and beaurtiful thing, figs and raisins and other dark fruits, the spices are delicious and the herbal qualities are just great. The lambic seems a little downplayed here, and the cherry is faint if anything.  Taste near perfect, all of those great dark fruits, the sweet malts, the herbs and spices, the lambic sour coming out to play... really, I wasn't getting too much out of the cherry lambic in aroma, but here in taste its out in force and a wonderful thing paired with a quad. So many fruits, plum, cherry, apricot, fig, different feel with each. The finish is sooo long, sweet, sour, fruity, the spices sticking around, just delicious.  The mouth is absolutely perfect, the body is perfect, carbonation perfect, alcohol warms and soothing, feels good going down. Just great. A great beer, I take my time with it, slow down life, think about it, ponder, philosophize, wonder at such great thing man can achieve. Beers like this, and this brewery, are a testiment to all things good. It does well right out of the brewery, great at a year, and great at two years. Well done, well done.  Now, I usually don't go talking about prices for beers, but at five bucks a pop, this is just an unbelievable deal.

You can detect the alcohol but it isn't very strong. Chocolate cherry cordial centers. Taste is citrusy but with a cherry coke flavor to go along with it. Dark chocolate cherrys with a little coffee bean thrown in there. Alcohol is very present in the taste. Aftertaste is sugar. Can I loose weight drinking this one? I think not. I just bet the calories are out the roof. Mouthfeel is oily and sugary. High % means it's not a session brew but it is still a very nice quad and worthy of another go in the near future.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Appearance: Garnet colored in the glass, smaller than expected head with not much in the way of retention or lacing. A bit disappointing in this respect.  Smell: Lots of cherry character in the nose. Alcohol and slight caramel, but to me at least mostly cherry.  Taste: Again, lots of cherry character but not a lot of anything else... Wishing there was more complexity here... Somewhat tart, with some flavor reminiscent of a dubbel here, too... Not surprised this a blend. I get the feeling I would have liked each of the constituent parts more than the whole...

42,3457,Jwaks,2.53,"Serving 12 oz bottle.  Pours a very hazy deep maroon boasting little carbonation feeding a lasting half finger thick head with fine red-tinted froth and very little if any lacing to speak of.  Vinous dark stone fruit (think cherries, plums, grapes) dominates the nose with caramel malt, interesting medicinal phenols and some sugary apple. lingering in the background. Sweet fruit seems a bit overdone on the nose.  Dark vinous fruit, cherries and candied apple take hold and maintain their prescense throughout revealing moderate tannins and lemon zest on the finish and aftertaste. After a bit of acid on the entry light dark malts come into play on the mid palate dissapearing back into a sea of ripe vinous fruit. Why does this taste so artificially sweet and fruity, it's way overdone for a quad with little caramel malt to balance so much sweet fruit.  Cloyingly sweet and drying on the aftertaste it's not a dream, I'll give it kudos for a very smooth, neat and thick mouthfeel. A bit of warming alcohol comes through on the off-dry finish. Drink it quickly because this only gets worse as it warms.  I can hardly stand to finish just one. For those who like sweet fruity beers, this is for you but it isn't my cup of tea nor it is a good quad. It is far to sweet, fruity and artificial; contrived is a good word to describe it. Give me a real quad like Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12 or any other quad out there, this can't even being to approach them.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,pmcadamis,4.24,"A - Classy corked and caged big ass bottle. A monsterous four finger plus tan head of creamy foam rises above a cloudy reddish-brown brew. Lots of fine bubbles rise to the top and tons of sticky dry arcs of lace are left on the glass. The head eventually diminishes to a thin tan cap.  S - Honey, whole honeycomb, pancake syrup, Bit-O-Honey candy, caramel, powdered sugar, oatmeal cookies, raisin studded scones.  T - Again, honey and syrup along with dark fruits and rum. Also, a very sour flavor can be detected (cranberry?) (Note: I didn't read the bottle before drinking....this flavor I detect must be the cherry lambic added...this adulteration must also be the reason that this isn't as good as I thought it was going to be). This has Champagne-like vinous qualities that I often detect in Belgian beers. A touch of outdoorsy yeast flavors are there too. Grassy hops are there in the background and they come out a little more in the aftertaste. Really shines as it warms....I would recommend letting this sit out at room temp for half an hour or so before uncorking.  M - Full bodied with a lively carbonation, but not as thick as I expected it to be. Gets more syrupy towards the end of the glass as the carbonation dissapears.  D - Excellent...except for the price.

The flavor is sweet at first, with malts and dark fruits predominating, but follows with the taste of bitter cherries, and a slight yeasty undertone. All in all, rather pleasant, with a good balance between the sweet and bitter flavors.  The mouthfeel is substantial, as you'd expect from this style of ale, but not overwhelming. Drinkability is rather high as well, especially for so strong a brew.  Overall, very nice. Highly recommended to fans of Belgian-style ales. Also good for cherry fans who are put off by sour ales.

Taste was absolutely wonderful. The vibrant cherry flavor was accented with a complex malt flavor and very subtle hops that were almost unnoticeable, but they did their job. This beer was vibrantly carbonated, once again, almost feels like Cheerwine in the mouth. It is very hard to tell that this is 9.8% alcohol.

It makes you look smart just by carrying it.  Poured it into a glass goblet, and boy did the head grow! Very quickly, indeed, considering the fastest I've seen to date was a Duvel. But then again, I'm new at this... The color was a beautiful amber, dark and opaque, with the foam think and receding very slowly. Wait 5 minutes... The taste is somewhat predictable, very malty, with caramel and apple undertones. The alcohol breaks through immediately, and disturbs the pleasure that you were experiencing from that breif second there. The mouthfeel is great. Fine carbonation that you can barely see, give the beer an exciting feel, and makes you want to finish the whole pint yourself. But the taste, again, is slightly discouraging.

Overall smells like a delicious apple crumble or apple pie. Tastes of the apple, with tangy cherry in the center and aftertaste. I really enjoy the addition of the cherry lambic to the quadrupel - it complements the apple and sugar flavors without overpowering them. Good thickness to the mouthfeel - like a thick cider.

A vigorous pour produced a large tan head with medium bubbles, that quickly subsided to a 1 finger collar, leaving some thick, sticky lace. The aroma is very rich and complex, earthy and vinous and mainly sour cherries. The taste is sweet, rich malt, caramel, prunes and yeast, reminiscent of Gulden Drak, but with a very pleasant tartness from the Cherry lambic and brett. that really takes it to the next level, before fading to a boozy and slightly dry finish. The 3 Philosophers had a moderate mouthfeel and a great flavor profile that takes a while to unlock, but is a bit rich to drink more then a bottle or too of...that said, it is choice for enjoying with a robust cigar, such as a Romeo y Julieta Reserva Real # 2 Belicoso, which is suburb.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,torchedpunk,4.1,"Came across this guy while in a store I only heard about and wanted to see what they offered. I picked up cause I never got my hands on a quadrupel before and I was dying to give it a try.  Appearance- pours dark and solid, I didn't expect much of a head, and there wasnt much to offer. But looked beautiful in a nice wide mouth glass.  Smell- Contained what seemed to be an endless amount of aroma. I was hardly able to put my finger on anything but really just enjoyed the full blend of it all. The most noticeable that i could catch was the dark malt, subtle but bold from its strengh.  Taste- Sip it real slow. It took a good 5 seconds before all the flavor developed. Strong malt taste of different kinds, definetly some fruit mixed in it. Resembled a barley wine.  Mouthfeel- Not extrememly thick, but definetly heavy. Slow and steady is best. Personally I spent a little less then an hour enjoying this guy.  Drinkability- I would love to bring this with me to a bring your own restaurant. This easily takes the place of a wine when accompanied by any high end meat. Beautiful for long romantic nights, or a very quiet elegant sitting. Really is a mood maker. I'll buy it again when I have an occasion for it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

It is a full bodied, dark and very tasty. This brew also packs a 10%ABV punch, so be careful. It tastes so good, you tend not to realize that once glass of this potion equals about 3 of your domestic beers. The main reason this beer strikes my fancy is the intense taste that it brings to the table. It's not something that you can just drink and not give it a second thought. It makes you stop to realize the quality of beverage that is flooding your palate. It makes you sit up and recognize that this is not just another beer.

Reviewed 1/17/06  A: deep brown body, edges of dark garnet. a ruby hue but this is one dark brew. a light dusting of dirty beige head and even a nice lacing for a brew with this much age. agitation brings back a momentary but creamy 1/2 inch.  S: let me preface by saying im pretty stuffed up...but here goes. butter and raw pastry dough. spent cigarette filters, smoke, and some over ripe fruit. im searching for the cherry but it seems to have melded into the overall aroma. lingering malt, sugar.  T/M: soft and creamy, very smooth. medium bodied, rich malt, a blend of smashed almost rotten fruit (in a ripe way, not a bad way), and even some of that cigarette filter. lots of vinous qualities, grapey, reminiscent of 2 day old wine. back pallete presents a little bitterness, a touch of booze, and some toffee sweetness. sugar is nicely balanced and the finish is long enough to be interesting, but nothing spectacular.  D: goes down so soft and easy. a little dangerous at nearly 10%. allow this to warm up a bit and its one nice presentation. cheers.  this bottle has been preserved very well. i would prefer all my 3 philos to have a few years on them.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JohnnyM2002,4.27,"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle, poured into a chalice at 50 degrees.  A - Pours a deep ruby red with a medium white head; foamy, but didn't take too long until it became a small white ring that followed the brew all the way down the glass. No real lacing along the glass, but the color stayed intact as it got warmer.  S - Powerful aroma; black cherries and malt dominate the initial whiff. The more I drank (also, as it warmed up), more of a spiced scent came through, with traces of alcohol. For a higher ABV brew, I expected to smell more of it up front, but it blended very well with the stronger scents. A very enjoyable aroma.  T - Black cherries with some pretty intense malt and a touch of honey. Alcohol begins to poke through the bittersweet flavors. Noticed some plum and a little peppery spice. I'm struggling to find the words to express the complexity of flavors, but they elude me. There is a wonderful warming sensation that combines the flavors extremely nicely and makes the experience much more enjoyable.  M - Creamy and medium in body...finishes very strong with a long-lasting warming sensation. Alcohol lingers for a little while, which I was hoping for.  D - This is my first time trying an entire bottle of this, and as expected, Ommegang nailed it again. I consider them a great alternative to wine for those special occasions, but they also make for a great relaxation beer...I sampled this one after a pretty rough day at work, when I just wanted to relax. An excellent Quad from a great brewery. I'm going to pick up some more to cellar them, because I'm sure this ages beautifully!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,SilentSabre,4.03,"Nice. Better than average all the way around. The appearance especially was very nice, indeed. Poured a wark cooked plum colour with a very pretty sand coloured foamy head that stayed in place for a very long time. This looks fantastic! Smell was warm brown sugar, stewed dark fruit and candied cherries, a touch of vanilla bean and a slightly noticeable trace of warm alcohol hiding in the background. Very nice. Taste was sweeter than I was anticipating. Cooked fruit up front, brown sugary sweetness in the middle which seemed to be followed up rather quickly with warm alcohol, and then a mild bitterness on the finish. CO2 level seemed to be just right for this brew, and mouthfeel was smooth and very drinkable.

42,3457,Onibubba,3.53,"Label indicates 2005. Let this set for about 30 minutes after removing from the fridge. Healthy ""pop"" and pours with about a 2 inch pink head into my tulip. Nice deep brown color. Head diminishes into fair lacing. Head and lacing is the same for each subsequent pour. Nice looking beer. The cherry comes through heavily in the smell, as well as in the taste. Mouthfeel is nice and on the mark for a quad. Thick and chewy, alcohol was not very noticeable at first, but began to assert itself about halfway through. As this warmed, the dominant cherry flavors began to take on a more medecinal taste - cherry cough syrup. At this point, the beer lost its appeal for me. Drinking the entire bottle became a bit of a chore. Score for taste would have marked higher if I had just had a small glass. By the end of the bottle, it was becoming offensive, so I had to score somewhere in the middle.  If someone offered me a 12 oz, or a glass of this beer, I would gladly accept, but nothing more.

Smell - A deep roasted malt and cherry flavor comes through most prevelantly.  Taste - STRONG flavor, the cherries and roasted flavor is almost overpowering. The complexity is amazing, but as said earlier it might come on a little strong.  Mouthfeel - Very thick texture, you definetly won't be gulping this bad boy down in a hurry, a sipping beer if there ever was one.  Drinkability - Definetly a unique brew that I'm glad I tried, though a bit too strong/ meaty to have on a regular basis. Have this one on an empty stomach as it is very filling.

42,3457,Romulus141,5,"Poured from a 3-Liter bottle (wax-sealed and corked) into a clear pub glass. I received this as a Christmas gift, and the presentation was nice. I opened it for New Year's Eve to share with my family.  Appearance: Pours a deep, beautiful red with a fluffy white head. The warmer the beer, the better the head is retained. Lacing stains the edges of the glass, and will not let go. The glow of this beer when held up to a light is a sight to behold. Truly a wonderful looking brew.  Smell: A nice malty smell intermixed with grains (particularly a sweet wheaty aroma). This reminds me of Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel, but even better in the smell department. The smell is quite present, and easy to detect, and delightful. You cannot smell the alcohol. All around one of the best beers I've smelled.  Taste: This is some great stuff. Very complex, and it would be tough to list all the different flavors I experience. There is the wheaty taste, which is followed up with an almost chocolately sweetness. The finish is crisp and smooth. I even detect some citrus style flavors in here from time to time. This beer also goes great with food. Pair it with cheese and crackers, or spicy food. Very versatile.  Mouthfeel: It has a good weight to it, and the carbonation balance is just right. Like a proper ale, it is thicker than most lagers, but not on the degree of a stout. It really caresses the tongue, and is incredibly smooth.  Drinkability: I needed to check the bottle again to remind myself that the ABV is almost 10%. You can't taste the alcohol at all! This is a sipping beer, but if you respect it, it can last you the entire evening, along with a nice meal. You'll probably reach for more afterwards, as I did.  I can't recommend this enough.

Lots of different smells to sort through. Mint, herbs, and wine like aromas. Very overbearing.  Very smooth but definitly a sipper. Has a nice creaminess from middle to end.

Smell: A waft of sour tartness is observed along with a rose like malty sweetness. Bready and floral notes are all mixed into the aroma, different but nice.  Taste: The flavor reminds me of a sour cherry mead with an almost sharp alcohol bite. It has a fresh homeade banana nut bread taste, but without the bananas. Not bad at all.

Carbonation is lively leading to a somewhat astringent mouthfeel. Malty with a slight sourness and a noticeable cherry presence. Pours a gorgeous deep reddish color. Have to say, two years of aging o this beer makes a big difference. Really enjoyed it.  My original review:  Pours a deep reddish color with good clarity. Smell is sweet, malty with hints of cherry. Flavor suffers from an excessive sweetness that is rather cloying.

This is a sipping brew, as the petite Three Philosophers glassware hints to. There are also some spicy herbal overtones to the taste, that become more apparent as you drink.  Very complex brew, but was enjoyable to drink. I was the DD when I drank this. It was my only drink, and it lasted me over an hour, and I still got a slight buzz.

42,3457,orfeu,3.97,"In October 2005 I purchased a couple mixed cases of 750 ml bottles of each of Ommegang's four ""main"" beers when I camped overnight at the Waffles and Puppets event. Most of those beers have since been drunk or given as gifts, but of those that remain there are three specimens of the 2005 bottling of Three Philosophers ""Belgian Style Blend."" This bottle has sat quietly with its Ommegang brethren since then, and now seems like a good time for a review. The bottle was opened at cellar temperature. A careful pour into a Three Philosophers bulb yields a slightly murky burnt-orange glowing brew with a steady, densely-bubbled light brown head. Slightly boozy, almost medicinal aromas of prunes and cherry juice, along with brown sugar and faint canned-pineapple notes. Very noticeable cherry flavor rings the edges of the first sip, surrounding a caramel-drizzled spiced poundcake center. Spicy alcohol prickliness subsides toward the finish. Clean, fruity (plums, cherries) flavors in the aftertaste. Slightly tart, almost vinous, but mostly a caramel-fruit melange. Vaguely funky ""farmhouse"" yeasty esters in the burps. Moderate alcohol slickness, medium body. The year and change this has spent sitting tight in the cellar has brought the Lindemans Kriek out from the shadows -- or maybe I've just had a difficult time discerning it in the past. As of now, this is drinking fine, but I've got two left to try for the next couple of years, and it should be interesting to see what additional time will do to this beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

It's sweet and fruity, and within it holds everything I love about the belgian beer styles.  Taste is good, a bit of sweet tartness, almost no alcohol, which is surprising for such a strong brew.  Feels slightly tingly (beyond the normal carbonation), likely from the cherry. Overall, not unpleasant.  It's drinkable, but not something I'd do over an over.

The smell is fantastic: complex with notes of fruit, spice, yeast, malt, and even a twinge of caramel.  Taste is a bit too sweet from the cherry lambic, but also nicely crisp, with a nice malt backbone and a long tart finish. My one complaint is that it does not quite exhibit enough of the abbey yeast flavor profile to balance with the lambic.  Mouthfeel is thick and gummy, with some astringency from the cherries.  Drinkability: good not great. This beer puts the palate through the wringer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Underlying presence of raisins and dates as well, which bouquet nicely as it warms.  I was afraid the cherry lambic would overwhelm but it doesnt. This is a mostly malty ale with a fruity finish, though all in all, theres nothing overly distinctive that I can say about the taste. In fact, as the label states, the sweet caramel malt and dark cherries do in fact confound my tongue  just not in the best way.  Smooth mouthfeel is achieved with a mild carbonation balanced with a nice creaminess.  Glad I had a chance to sample it.

T: Spiced plums, black cherry, brown sugar, toasted malt, and a slight orange rind-like bitterness round things out here.  M: Well rounded creamy-ness with a hoppy, spicy bitterness that adds great balance.  D: Quite drinkable. Best served slightly cooler than room temp.

Excellent dissolved carbonation. 2 hours after popping the cork, it still pours a solid head. Deep amber color with a hint of rose.  Aroma: Initial hint of cherry followed with resemblances of cotton candy. LET IT WARM!!!! As it warms, more aromas become apparent, including toffee, chocolate and hints of port.  Flavor: On a most basic assessment, cherry lambic flavor mixes with toasted malt. Inexplicable complexity and esters abound. Somewhat tart...perhaps from cherries or plums. Even something resembling peach or apricot occasionally appears as a complement. This is a delightful and complex beer. Little spice, negligible hops...the masterful balance of malt, fruitlike flavors and esters is unbelievable.  Mouthfeel: Slightly acidic and well balanced, smooth, coats well but isn't cloying. Enticing carbonation but not explosive. The finish starts sweet and finishes moderately dry. I wish I had cheesecake with a fruit compote to work with this.  Drinkability: Drinkability is unmatched.

Head is a nice roasted marshmallow color made up of medium sized bubbles. The head has fallen to what I can only compare to what pond scum looks like (and I mean that in a good way)! Various streams of bubbles raise to the surface from the depths of the glass.  S: Smores, cherry, caramel, banana, some vanilla and butterscotch.  T: Begins like a refined cordial; dried cherry, vanilla and caramel are the front runners. From there I get sort of a coffee cake with underlying powdered cocoa. Some marshmallow in there with cherry cream candy moments. Finishes with some butterscotch and a tad of bitterness with evident alcohol on the tip of the tongue.  M: Full body and smooth with a bit of carbo fluff.  D: I think I like this beer more fresh opposed to aged. The cherry isn't as apparent but it does get more caramel personality.

The cherry never is overpowering.  Fairly full-bodied and well carbonated, a marvelous brew.  So drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden; except for the buzz.

It's nice... a muddy brown beer with a reddish hue when held to the light. But the head... wow! Great head on this beer. Thick, foamy and long lasting.  The smell is sweet and fruity with a bit of tartness and banana in the background.  Taste is really unique. The beginning is a great sweet belgian dubble, then a transition into a sour lambic. The transition is extremely smooth. Much smoother than expected. This is a really fine tasting brew. For 9.8%, the alcohol is superbly hidden. I'm tempted to give this thing a 5 for taste. Should I? (gulp) 5 it is!  Mouthfeel is right where it should be. Fairly highly carbonated with a bit of bite at the end, but a nice heavy mouthfeel that supports that bite.  This is a really nice beer.

42,3457,geetlord,4.2,"This beer poured a coppery amber in color with a very large foamy head that remained for quite a while. The aroma carried spices, some alcohol, and cherries. The flavor was very complex, flavors changed rapidly and smoothly from one to the next making it dificult for me to give specific descriptions of each. I tasted spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves), dark molasses and brown sugar, some hints of tart citrus. On top of this the blended cherry lambic was very prominent adding sweet cherries, and some red wine like qualities to taste. The finish very dry and carries a bit of an alcohol kick. I enjoyed the flavors and complexities of this beer a lot, however the lambic blending added a slightly disjoint set of flavors, that while good, would have been much better had they blended better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Nesued,4.62,"750ml bottle, no freshness date however a collar label describes this as ""Brewed 2005"". Should store nicely.  Appearance - Ruddy brown/amber color. Clear to the view. Fine carbonation. Outstanding tan/off-white lacing follows a well developed head. Remaining head is a ring and thin layer.  Smell - Malty aroma is brighted with the cherry presence. Nice aroma without the alcohol overtones as many 9%'s have.  Taste - Mellow yet tart taste. The malt is well positioned from the first sip with the cherry giving an added bite. A bit of a bitter presence that may be both the cherry and the malt components. The alcohol makes it's presence known in a big way.  Mouthfeel - What a dense complex brew. My palate is coated after a good long drag on this beer. Not as much a heavy, but a dense feel.  Drinkability - As with most Belgian and Belgian-styles this bad boy is for sipping. Anyone who thinks they can drink several of these needs to drink cheaper beer for the buzz they are looking for! This is a well presented Quadrupel without suffering from the oft-times overbearing alcohol presence. One of my favorates in the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jwc215,4.28,"12 oz. bottle  Pours deeep reddish-brown with ruby highlights. The thick, creamy head descends to a lasting cover.  The smell is of cherry and sweet malt. A pleasant aroma.  A sweet brown sugar coats a barley breadiness and an underlying cherry taste. Some spiciness is present, but not sharp. The sweetness is offset by a touch of tartness. A warming alcohol adds to the mild spiciness. Medium to full-bodied.  Rich and complex, it's very smooth.  This is a wonderful, unique brew. The mixture of barley malt and cherry lambic makes this one interesting and delicious. As the bottle states, this one is better to have when at room temperature or slightly chilled. It's a very nice occassional ""sipping"" brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JasonA,3.88,"750ml brewed 2005 purchased fromCorridor Liquors in Laurel MD.  Pours a slightly cloudy reddish (almost cherry) copper. Little head which dissapates quickly. Some lacing, I expected much more. Head leaves and islands while sitting  Smells ligth barley, barely some malts. Very surprised no alcohol smell for 9.8abv. Also expected more smells at this point.  I am no quad expert, so bear with me on the taste. Taste some non-sweet dried fruit like curant or maybe date. Maybe oak and somewhat dry. Also not what I expected.  Mouthfeel is good, but I guess my expectations were much higher for this brew. Medium carbonation in the mouth, but much very dry and almost oak tasting (like in chard wine). Alcohol bite early in the mouth, but goes away quick with dryness.  I am worried about this bottle. I am hoping this was a bad bottle, its the first from this place. I guess I was expecting something different. Since it is so close, I am going to definately try again.  Let me finish with this thought: This beer reminds me of wine. A very dry chard with hops and barley. Not a barley wine, not that sweet. I would like to revisit this thought on another bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

There is some fruity undertones with the obvious representation of alcohol. Taste is incredibly creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation in the mouthfeel. There is a good amount of cherry coming out midway through the taste. This is a really good beer. The alcohol was quite apparent in the nose, but nowhere to be found in the taste. Absolutely no burn. This is a fine offering from Brewery Ommegang and at a price point that makes it a very easy buying decision. If you have access to this beer, it is a must try.

Smellis complex and winey, but with a sharp stewed sour cherry smell in the background. This isn't unpleasant, but it could be more well integrated.  Taste is better, and more balanced. Here the fruit is more subtle and doesn't predominate. Instead you have a nice layered malt profile with sweet sour underpinning of cherry and some slight hops to give a little spiciness.  Mouthfeel is also quite balanced somewhat crisp, somewhat creamy, nice carbonation level.

42,3457,EPseja,3.44,"Served from a 12oz bottle at just below cellar temperature in a Chimay chalice. Tasting conducted slowly to allow the temperature to rise even more.  A - A hazy, golden burnt orange color at the start turns to a glass with the color of a light prune juice -- completely opaque. Head is light coffee colored and modest. Lacing is present, but average.  S - Dark fruits like figs, raisins and prunes along with the smell of wet newspaper and alcohol. Big, caramel maltiness. Raw candy sugar. Slight vanilla and maple. The smell of cherries is buried way in the back, and just barely noticeable.  T - Well balanced dark cherry and fig-newton sweetness is immediately offset by a fairly strong alcohol kick that runs beside the tart yeast. I also perceive a slight, unidentifiable spice note that might be a derivitave of the added cherry lambic. Medium dryness in the swallow and finish.  M - Creamy on the way in, turning quite tingly on the tip of the tongue, but without over-expansion. Chewy in the mouth. Swallow is throat filling and dense.  D - A very tasty quad indeed, but I just don't see where the cherries come in. Perhaps this is a good thing, however, since an overtly cherry smack in the face would be an affront to the style. A pleasure to drink, and satisfying nonetheless!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,largadeer,4,"2005 vintage, poured into an oversized wine glass.  A - Burgundy-colored, with a formidable head that dissipates into a light cake on the surface.  S - Spicy/sweet alcohol, chocolate, and cherries of course. Kind of reminds me of those alcoholic chocolate covered cherries (go figure).  T - Exceptionally mellow and smooth, like a nice cognac. The cherry lambic is pretty subdued in this bottle; it's there in the background, adding a bit of tart sourness, but it's blended evenly with flavors of dark chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla. I'm curious to see if the kriek is more prominent in fresher bottles. I would guess that aging mellows out the lambic and blends the flavors a bit.  M - On the fuller side of medium-bodied. The long-lasting head gives it some creaminess. This is a rich, heavy, filling beer.  D - Surprisingly good considering how rich and alcoholic it is, largely thanks to the rather mellow flavor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,trevorwideman,4.35,"Thanks to demcorhip for the amazing bunch of brews he brought for me! Included were 2 of these. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a dark translucent ruby colour with lots of sediment. Healthy, reddish-coloured 1/2 inch head that recedes slowly to 1/8 inch with a nice lacing and mild carbonation. Nose is quite sweet with hints of cherry, plum, port, chocolate, molasses, and mild alcohol sending it straight to the brain. Intense!  Taste is immediately alcoholic with the sourish cherry flavour coming in just behind. This is a little more tart than I thought it would be, but I like it. The cherries give way to a mild chocolate sweetness, some fruitcake flavour. Figs, plums, blackberries all make an appearance, along with a hint of coriander. Mild yeastiness in here as well. There's a multitude of complexities to this beer, very impressive. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, and it leaves the palate a little sticky. Carbonation is medium and dances the flavours around the palate just enough. Drinkable is more like sippable as this is one hefty brew, and I could keep sipping this all night. Not more than two though!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The nose has lots of dark fruit, blackberries, plums, dark caramel toffee, dates, and the lightest hint of spice. There is a light citrus finish. The flavor really turns up the dark fruit. There must be some Belgian candy syrup in this beer. Tons and tons of blackberry, blackcherry, and dates. Light orange citrus bitterness comes across midway. The finish blends the sweet fruit, and the bitterness. There is just a mils alcohol hint on the finish. The mouth feel is just a touch thin.

42,3457,kajerm,3.39,"Pours a gorgeous ruby brown with a slightly-lacing off-white head; the head is about half a finger and fades after about ten seconds or so. The appearance is absolutely breathtaking: if you hold Three Philosophers up to the light, it's almost pure red and translucent, with visible yeast in suspension.  Smell is a little weak-- Belgian yeast is the dominant note, with a secondary smell of bananas. It's pleasant, but a fairly standard quadrupel kind of smell, maybe a little brettier than usual. Cherries are nowhere to be found, at least not by my nose.  The kriek shows up in force in the taste. Dark malt is strong at first, but it doesn't last. Brett pops all over your tongue like in Orval, but blended with a drop of quadruppel spiciness and that. Kriek sourness lingers. The alcohol is hidden VERY well by the kriek, but is just barely noticeable on the back of the tongue.  It's weird, but I like it. I'd be interested to see how this beer tasted if they toned down the kriek slightly.  Feels like quadrupel-- smooth, substantial, and a little foamy at the end. It's my favorite beer style, so it should be no surprise that I liked it. I was actually surprised it didn't feel lighter from the added lambic, but it's 9.8%ABV, so maybe I shouldn't be.  You're not going to knock back this beer. It's too heavy, too alcoholic, and too Bretty. Savor it with a good meal and a lot of free time. I imagine this might actually be a good introduction to Belgian yeast (and even lambic), as the Brett and sourness are strong but balanced nicely by the quadrupel-style weight.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell: Mild scents of sourdough bread, sweet chocolate, and figs. It's not very overwhelming but it's a pleasant scent.  Taste and Mouthfeel: For the most part it tastes like bittersweet chocolate from the malts. It's very smooth with little carbonation. Has a nice cherry cordial finish and pretty clean after that.  Drinkability: It's a big malty, high ABV quad so that right there says take it easy. It's pretty tasty but the alcohol can sneak up on you.  Bottom Line: It's kind of a ""stouty"" quad to me. It tastes pretty good but I don't think it's necesarilly a very good showing for the style. A good dinner beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Highly carbonated.  Aroma: Anise, Vanilla, Butterscotch, Berries...just about the kitchen sink here. Everything but hops.  Tastes sweet with that odd astringency that belgian style ales always have to me. Malt dominates, with caramel and butterscotch qualities. The lambic's fruitiness is present in every sip but takes second fiddle to the malt. Again, no hop flavor that I could tell.  The aforementioned astringency dominates the mouthfeel, making this a dry, dry beer. Combine this with the high alcohol content and this is not an overly drinkable beer.  I know a lot of people who love this beer and I'm happy to join them in partaking of its qualities. That said, it's not one I seek out on my own.

There is an after taste of cherry taffy as well.  Mouthfeel is ok and I wouldn't want to drink to many of these but it is pretty good.  Definitely an interesting combo and a good one at that.

In general I found the lambic to dominate this beer, losing some of the more subtle flavors. There were still some good dark fruit flavors, but I'd prefer more focus on them.

42,3457,mmcave,4.38,"Id seen this beer on the shelf a long while and always been intrigued by the idea of a quad with blended cherry lambic. So I finally caved, and here it goes. Poured it into my chimay chalice, careful not to disturb the sediment. Nice off white tan head with good retention. The body is a dark coffee brown with deep reddish highlights. It smells of Belgian yeast, sweet and charred malt, mild hints of coffee and caramel with a little subtle, but pleasing natural funk of lambic. The taste is crisp and malty, some definite sweetness coupled with a mild yet well balance hint of hoppy bitterness and the cherry lambic funk is definitely there yet not over pouring in the least. If one dislikes lambics they need not worry this is not a 100 funk its more just the right amount for a great all round flavor. This beer is a really fun modified quad. Honestly the flavor of cherry lambic and charred malt, with caramel, coffee and chocolate notes makes for a great beer. Id definitely buy this again especially to show it to a friend.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,demcorhip,4.38,"Appearance A medium brown coloured ale with reddish hues. Nice compact 1 finger light tan coloured head. A well, medium laced, spritzy carbonated brew.  Aroma A treacly toffee with cherries, some sour funk, a touch of oak and vanilla.  Taste Buttery and almost nutty treacle toffee. Almost vineous in character sour cherry which goes great with the touch of barnyard funk. A touch of oak and vanilla, and a wonderful earthy character.  Mouthfel/Drinkability This is an amazingly drinkable and balanced big beer. The touch of cherry lambic wonderfully compliments and adds amazing depth to the dark ale. Slight alcohol warmth is the only clue of the high alcohol content. A rich earthy feel with a hint of spice, along with the sour cherry and barnyard funk are a great counterpoint to the rich malts in this fine ale. What an incredibly drinkable big beer full of subtle and substantial flavours. What a decadent session this would make, and also quite accessible for something with so much depth of flavour.  Was very happy to find this one almost locally. Will be a staple in my beer cupboard.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,gueuzeonhigh,4.38,"I was somewhat concerned upon seeing with cherry-lambic added on the label. I had, however slight an expectation of drinking cloying sweet soda pop homage to the Belgian brewing art. How wrong my expectations were!  This beer poured a rosewood red hue with a tan tightly knit and sculptured head.  My particular sample had-- be it my glass the brew or the temperature, a less than exuberant head which burst forth onto the scene, than perhaps other bottle conditioned Belgian style beers Ive experienced. Hurray!  The nose was slight- almost thin but with aromatic wafts of citrus commingled with a bit of tartnessIm not certain what created that notebut tart comes to mind.  The flavor was a-- for the lack of a better term riddle. It was clean, sharp, maybe exact and right to the point but I couldnt identify a particular stereotypical beer characteristic that made me take notice. The flavor was bitter but I couldnt declare hops. The flavor had underpinnings of sweet but I couldnt justify malt. The flavor bore hints of the bucolic but there wasnt an underpinning of yeast stashed in there. The flavor was tart but by no means wild cherries. Perhaps the flavor's stance was a well-balanced combination of those four elements that made it such a taste conundrum.  The finish was much like the flavorI could taste its presence but I am unable to arrive at an apt description. My best effort at a description settles to clean and neutral. This is not to say that the finish was nondescript or unremarkablein fact the finish was rather an enjoyable part of this beer.  The mouthfeel was such that it didnt ruffle feathers but rather a drinkable combination of excitement and comfort. Despite this beers nearly 10% ABV, its cordial blended combinations made for a very pleasant pint-and-a-half.  After the last morsel dripped forth from the bottle I mused over what Id reportThree Philosophers is indeed best described as the ghost moniker on the label suggests Belgian Style Blend.  Three Philosophers was an enjoyable beer experience.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Not to dare is to lose oneself.""  --Soren Kierkegaard   Brewed 2004. Softly glowing coral with ripe orange trim, a beautiful color that reminds me of a tropical sunset in a glass. The Belgianesque head is at least as gorgeous as the beer with its tangerine caramel color and its sticky, whipped frothiness. A meager amount of lace is the only thing keeps the appearance from perfection.  The aroma is musty and funky and spicy and herbal and all kinds of interesting; I just wish that it was more cherry-like. I would never have guessed that that particular fruit was added if it didn't say so on the label. My hope is that the cherry lambic will be more evident on the palate than it is in the nose.  This is fabulous beer! I haven't had too many quadrupels yet, but I've had enough to know what to expect. Three Philosophers is an excellent version with the added benefit of sour cherries. There's so much complexity here that my mouth doesn't know where to start, it just wants to enjoy for a while.  The malt is on the border between heavily toasted and lightly roasted, delivering such flavors as dark toffee, plum pudding, rum-soaked figs and even a little dark chocolate. Can't forget the black cherries. And the raisins. And the ground clove. This beer tastes like liquified dark Christmas fruitcake. It can't possibly become more delicious with warming, can it?  I wish now that I had poured the beer into a snifter. It deserves to be philosophized over because I'm sure that the meaning of life is in here somewhere. I'm enjoying the tartness provided by the cherry lambic, but am glad that it wasn't added with a heavier hand. No sense in turning this stately beer into a cherry fruit beer with quadrupel accents.  The body/mouthfeel is the best of both worlds. There's enough malt on hand to give the beer a mouthfillingness and a finishing stickiness, yet the energetic amount of carbonation keeps things brisk and amazingly supple. Drinkability didn't need any help, but was provided with it anyway by virtue of an outstanding mouthfeel.  I need to revisit what Brewery Ommegang has to offer since I reviewed most of their regular offerings prior to knowing what the hell I was tasting. Still though, it's hard to believe that anything in their oeuvre can compare to Three Philosophers. This is a stunning creation that was a steal at only $5.99 per bottle. I'm seriously considering buying a case because I'm sure that this nectar will age like a dream. Highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,dblinkhorn,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - A super murky (can't see through it, and I didn't pour the yeast in, either) brownish red color is what is left in the glass after the pour. The head is about three fingers in height and is a light tan color. The texture of the head is quite creamy and it has excellent retention with superb lacing down the glass.  Smell - Upon smelling this brew, you can definitely affirm what's on the label, that it is blended with a cherry lambic. Accordingly, it has a quite pungent cherry aroma right off the bat. Other dark ripe fruits along with some very floral hops characters pair with the cherry. A rich, grainy, and cooked malt aroma ties it all together, along with a moderate alcohol spiciness. Just smelling this stuff, you know you're in for something powerful.  Taste - A very complex brew, you really have to strain your tasting ability to nail all the flavors in this beer. Obviously the cherry lambic blend comes out quite strong, along with some strong dark chocolate and coffee notes. Caramel and molasses are also present. Plum, fig, and other dark fruits, along with a strong floral hops presense are just a few more of the wide array of flavors in this brew. The malt character now almost tasted a bit toasted. It is very rich and strong in flavor. This stuff reminds me of the Rogue Old Crustacean. The alcohol, at nearly 10%, is actually well-hidden for that high of a level. Make no mistake, though, it is certainly noticeable.  Mouthfeel - On the high end of medium-bodied and of excellent smoothness. The carbonation is a bit more than I would have liked for this style. There is a slightly unpleasant bite accompanying every sip. I think letting the beer warm or sit for a few minutes extra may help this, though.  Drinkability - Huge and robust flavors in every department, especially the malt character. One of these and I'm done with any kind of strong dark ale for the night. But this stuff is so darn good that I simply can't bring myself to dock points from this category that much.  This is a powerful and quite strong beer that is ultra complex. If you don't like full-flavored and robust beers, then steer clear of this one, because you will surely cower in fear at its awesome power.

Fruity apples and Belgium yeast in the aroma. Wheres the cherry? Oh, there it is, just underneath the malty backbone. Almost had an anise undertone  reminiscent of a RIS. Very fizzy and highly carbonated.  I thought it was pretty boozy, as it put my wife right to bed Heh, more for me.. but at only 10%, I wished I had more than one bomber.

The reason that I am reviewing it again is because I just opened a new bottle of it (same year as the last one: 2005) and I noticed a DRASTIC difference in taste.  It poured a deep reddish brown color. Fizzy thick head that took a while to settle down. Smell was similar, but more fruity. Then the first taste--BANG. This is completely different than my last experience. The black cherry flavor was overwhelmingly strong and it finished much more bitter than dry. It's incredible to see such variation. Wow.

42,3457,jhollick,3.83,"2005 Edition  Poured dark and opaque with deep crimson tones. A large head formed, and clinged for a long time. NOTE: DANGER!!!! I unscrewed and removed the cage, and several seconds later the cork popped off on its own. Quite a shock, and a potentially dangerous situation. Zoinks!  The smell was not near as strong as I expected, with malt and yeast smells being dominant. The smell is all sweet with a slight hint of alcohol, cherry, and other candied flavors.  In the mouth, the beer was very thick and syrupy. This is expected behavior, but it is always an experience even if you know its coming.  Tastewise, there was a surprisingly strong hop presence. The beer has a spicy and warm flavor that nicely compliments the bitter. Aftertaste has a touch of cherry, but not all that much for this being a lambic-blended Quad. Definitely a complex and tasty beer, but not al that drinkable. The 750mL size was bordering on too much for me by myself. It didn't take long for my cheeks to flush drinking this.  Overall, it was an interesting beer. The bottle size allowed it to warm to room temperature, offering a variety of flavors and temperatures to take in. The hop presence was surprising, but not offensive. Excellent beer. I'm warm and happy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,phisig137,3.79,"2005 bottle pours a murky mahogany color, with a one finger head and nice retention. No lacing, and only a small ring of bubbles are left behind.  Aroma is massively aromatic and complex. cherries, both sweet and sour, malt, toffee, caramel, roasted grains, and other dark berried dominate the nose. Smells fairly sweet, and has a faint hint of alcohol to it as well.  The flavor is also hugely complex. Very well balanced and blended, not allowing either the malt or the cherries to overpower one another. Slightly sweet up front, with a dry finish, the flavor lingers for quite some time. Nice to have a fruit flavored beer that doesn't taste artificial.... quite hard to do in my opinion. No alcohol present on the palate. Mouthfeel is very heavy, coating and smooth. Drinkability is decent, but I think it could improve with a bit more carbonation to lift the heavy flavors from your tongue.  Quite good overall, as are all of the Ommegang products.

42,3457,malcontent,3.22,"Deep red/brown poured into a snifter; not opaque but very hazy with very sturdy lacing after the head dies down. Definitely one of those beers that simply look like they must taste good.  Man! Flat-out loaded with fragrances. Sour cherry, roasted malt, English toffee, cream sherry & many others that my still-budding nose will be able to detect with more training. Looks & smells like a winner, just need to let it warm up a bit.  Hmmtart (cherry) at first, but then spreads across the palate with a harsh-bitterness; like over-roasted malt which leaves a rather unwelcome aftertaste. Definite alcohol presence with a bread-like flavor in the back end, almost a marble rye. Not very enjoyable thus far but I think Ill take Jasons advice & pair it with some Danish blue.  After pairing with the cheese I must say there is some improvement in taste; the unsavory aftertaste is certainly reduced. However, Im still just not wild about this beer.  Has a nice bubbly texture but then coats the mouth with some unwelcome astringency. That aside, its not nearly as heavy a brew as Id expected & thus, if its to your taste, makes for a pretty drinkable beverage.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Suspect some sediment to be floating around in there but can't see it, as it's nearly opaque. Two-finger off-white head, fluffy but not very stiff, dissipates quickly leaving considerble lacing around the underside of the tulip's rim.  The nose consists of sweet yeast and toasty malts, cherry, black berry, butterscotch, and toffee. The flavor profile follows the aroma's, along with some of a phenolic characteristic and a moderate flash of alcohol, as to be expected at 9.8%.  The mouth is light on the tip of the tongue, moving into a semi-dry stretch of malt and yeast, then into the sugary, yet some what harsh and medicinal finish. It has decent drinkability, and I don't mind a strong presence of alcohol, but I think they over did it just a bit on this one.  Solid, but not worthy of regular revisits.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Damian,4.1,"Drank from a 750 ml bottle purchased at Mall Discount Liquors, Cambridge, MA  Poured a dark, murky, ruby-brown with a large, caramel-colored head that was thick and foamy. Spotty, cascading lacing trickled down the glass.  Aroma was rich and complex, sweet and malty. Some cherry and/or raspberry was immediately noticeable. Hints of caramel, raisins, prunes, spices and brown sugar were also detectable.  Taste was malty, creamy, toffee-like and alcohol rich with a consistent, subtle, hoppy overtone detectable from start to finish. Nice melding of flavors. Alcohol was somewhat noticeable at the start and crescendoed at the finish. Slightly dry and hoppy aftertaste. No cherry flavor was detectable but there was a touch of tartness (the bottle stated that this was a quadrupel with cherry lambic added).  Mouthfeel was rich and creamy but somewhat thinner than expected. Carbonation was a bit overdone.  Drinkability was quite good considering the 9.8% ABV.  Overall, a terrific quadrupel and an outstanding value for your money.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,kimcgolf,4.2,"This was really good. Poured from the bomber to a reddish brown color with off-white head, that lingered and left very good lacing. Aroma was strongly cherry, with malty sweetness evident. Body was medium, and at first, highly carbonated. Taste was more of the cherry, mixed well with the traditional ale taste. As beer warmed, the alcohol became more evident in the nose and taste, but still well blended with the cherry ale. Excellent warming finish as the alcohol took hold, and a very smooth after-taste. I will look for more of this in the coming winter.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,becktone,3.45,"Labeled ""Brewed 2005"" at the top: Real nice three to four finger head. As it receedes a bit the head leaves some lacing along the sides of the glass. The color can only be described as garnet. Head retention could be better, the head continusously receedes Lacing qualities aren't all that great.  The nose is malty sweet. Caramel malts, small amouts of phenols-cloves/banannas. No hop aroma as can be expected with this style... Well I can't say no hop aroma-there's a very small amount of a spicy aroma in this brew, probably from the use of some noble hop.  In my opinion the taste of this beer is just not as good as it smells. I definitely expected to taste something much more sweet; something more reminiscent of the aroma. The beer is good, but dosen't seem to live up to its aroma. The flavors aren't very pronounced. Perhaps my taste buds are off today, or perhaps the flavors or just to complex and blended so well that I'm missing something. Alcohol is detectable, but in small amounts-basically its not all that perceieable.  This beer is full bodied and is easy to drink. I think that I'll definitely try this one again. I want to see if I have the same experience that I've had with this one. This beer goes down very well there's nothing wrong with it that would make it hard to drink, could almost drink this all night. However, I find the flavor of this beer to be more bland than other beers I've had; beers that I would rather drink all night. All in all its above average and I like it, but in the way of Quadrupel, I prefer Rochefort 10.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Doomcifer,3.7,"Poured a very rich, dark brown with ruby hues to it. about a half-inch head that dissipated quickly into a tiny head that was formed just around the circumfrence of the galss, leaving behind very little lacing. Smells of ripe, dark fruits, cherries, figs, sweet, and some alcohol. Taste is also of very ripe dark fruits, figs, prunes, raisins, cherry flavors, very noticeable alcohol burn in the finish. This beer could mask the alcohol better but I guess with a beer like this, aging it would be a wise move to mellow it out. Mouthfeel is full and airy, silky, with a good amount of carbonation. I've had better quads but they are usually from Belgium. This Three Philosophers is probably the best quad coming from the USA, or at least from what I have had.

Dark brown with a big off white head with good size bubbles. Nice lace but not a lot of retension.  From what I can remember it smells and tastes similar to the Hennepin but stronger in flavor and alcohol. I smell fruits, maybe prunes, apples, some malt. Taste is the same with a finish of alcohol and some hops. Pretty drinkable. Another good brew from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

It is a hazy light brown color with abundant sediment.  S: Smell is malty-cherry mix, with the cherry being more of a sour (liefmans) than sweet (lindemans).  T: The taste is cherry and chewy malts. The malts are dominant but give way to a certain heat from hops. The malt finish is long and the formidble alcohol is well hidden. Maybe its just me, but the malts have a muscat grape and chocolate finish.  M: The depth of the quad and the cherry hints makes this a beer that thoroughly confuses the tastebuds.

42,3457,greebsnarf,3.84,"Three Philosophers (2004), on tap at the Belgian Room in NYC for an Ommegang event. The appearance was stunning: a rich dark red color, almost syrupy, and a large but quickly fading head. It looked incredible in a large wine glass. That said, I found the aroma a little disappointing. It smelled primarily malty and sweet, but, I thought, deserved to be much more pronounced.  When it came to drinking it, though, this beer did not disappoint at all. Moderately thick and a little bubbly, it was a real pleasure to sip, and the taste was extremely complex; with each sip I noticed another flavor. Malty and sweet are followed by a slight yeasty taste and sour cherries, with a number of other flavors, spicy and roasted, that I couldn't quite pick out. It tasted quite peaty and smokey throughout--reminding me of Scotch whisky. The alcohol was well masked at first but became increasingly (and, I thought, surprisingly) pronounced as the beer warmed.  Between the thickness and the strength and complexity of flavor, this really is best enjoyed slowly, in small amounts, and without food; as much as I enjoyed it, I could only have one small glass in an evening. But I'll happily have that one glass any opportunity I get.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BabaJohn,4.17,"Looks like a nice, dark red wine with some brown tints. Head fades fast, in its place comes some consistent and evenly placed streams of carbonation. Smells sour and malty, with cherry and caramel aromas. A delicious clean taste up front, very sweet and wine-like, cherries, grapes, bitter greens. Nice alcohol warmth follows. The carbonation is well integrated. Some slightly roasted, smoky flavors as well, predominantly in the aftertaste. Slightly dry all in all, but this trait is presented well. Goes straight to my head; drink slowly. Mmm",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,mynie,4.08,"2003 Vintage.  Pours a beautiful bubbly dark rust cherry. Bubbly bubbles, very bubbly, huge big pretty bubbles visible miles away from the class. It's all topped off by a rocky retentive head.  Smells sweet, sour, and cidery. A little too strong, maybe--I can only imagine how intense a fresh bottle's odor would be!  Tastes great. Complexity grows as it warms. At first you're overwhelmed with the two styles that are blended, you get the sharp tart cherries and sour yeast of the lambic and then the spicy burn of a quad. The stages become more pronounced as your pallete adjusts. It still starts out tart, but the chewy lambic yeast comes more into play. Then it shoots into a sweet and spicy quadrupel that tastes like a very strong ommegang--bitter start, very sweet and fruity middle, and then a bitter end. It all ends on a nice alcohol burn.  This tastes a bit more alcoholic than it is, and that hampers drinkabliity a little bit, but it's well worth it otherwise.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ChillMike,4.12,"Pours a very deep and dark plumish amber color, with a medium sized light brown head, that doesn't seem to leave much lacing. Smells of sweet malts, chocolate, and cherries, a very pleasant smell that begs to be drank. A waterfall of flavors hits the palette upon first taste. I first get plenty of chocolate flavor, some malty flavors, then sugar cane, followed by the slightly sour cherry lambic flavor to finish it off. Leaves a very pleasant aftertaste. Quite enjoyed this one, however, it is about 2 years old, I wonder how it tasted upon fresh brewing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,beerogre,4.68,"As a general rule, when I visit the beer store after finishing work on Friday and make my selections for the weekend, I like to look for something new. Something a little bit different, something of an experiment. After sampling this beer for the second time (the first was several weeks ago) I have already decided that this will definitely be one of next Friday's purchases and thus, once again, one of next weekend's highlights.  It's hard to put into words how impressed I am with Brewery Ommegang's products and drinking this beer once more only serves to reinforce how highly I rate them.  I've been trying quite a lot of Belgian beers in the last few months and as great of a time as I've had with that (and it has been wonderful) I really don't think I've enjoyed any of them more than the pleasure I derive from the Ommegang beers.  Comparing this beer to other Quadrupels, I've had St. Bernardus Abt 12 many times, Trappistes Rochefort 10 several times recently, and Avery's The Reverend (read my other reviews to see how highly I rate Avery) and to be honest I'm reaching for the shelf with the Ommegang.  It reminds me of when I used to go to the horse races back in England. Sometimes a famous owner like the Aga Khan IV would have horses at the event and you always knew they were going to be class horses. Well, for me, I always know it's going to be a class beer when it says Ommegang on the label.  Ommegang beers: First past the post.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,dancinwillie,4.53,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle marked 2005 into a pint glass.  Giant head on this one, had to top off with another pour, due to huge head. The result is a creamy looking, off white head that rises above the glass, much like a root beer float. The brew itself is an inviting shade of red that comes as close to black as it possibly could.  Aroma is dominated by cherries, with the yeast coming through minimally.  The taste is very sweet upfront. A complex mixture of sour cherries, yeast, and a solid malt backbone. Taste a little chocolate on the back end. Cherry leads the flavor, but not overwhelming at all. This is a very complex beer. Very delicious too. Picking up what may be vanilla as well. My, this is good!  Mouthfeel is wonderful. Thick without being overbearing, and nowhere near thin. Smooth, and refreshing, and left me wanting more.  Overall, I would say for the price, and the quality of Three Philosophers, this is a HIGHLY drinkable quad. Definately going to be putting it into my regular rotation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I almost got a nose full of beer on this one it smelled so good.  T: Similar to smell. Traditional yeast sourness followed by sweet and earthy malts. Darks fruits are noticable and finished with subtly warm alcohol.  M&D: Medium mouthfeel and body. Nice balance between sweet, sour, and alcohol. I could have more than one or two if the high abv didn't knock me down so quickly.  I will definitely have this beer again.

42,3457,atozymurgy,4.37,"As great as this beer is, it's even better with the right food pairing...  Pours with a huge, long-lasting head, even with a slow careful pour. The color is deep, rich brown, almost black, but with ruby highlights. Very enticing.  The aroma is thick, with lots of malt, noticeable cherries, and hints of bitter roastiness, slight sourness, and a slight whiff of chocolate.  The taste is almost beyond description. One of the most complex beers around. It starts sweet and malty, but this is quickly balanced by roasty bitterness and a touch of sourness. The cherry flavor perfectly balances the richness of this beer, without being overwhelming. The slight notes of chocolate also add roast and bitterness, but it's different here and complements the cherries beautifully.  This beer really fills the mouth, though it's surprisingly light given how big it is. It goes down very easily, especially with the help of the sourness. Not exactly refreshing, but I could easily drink more than one (if I'm not standing).  Now to the food. This might not work so well with most entrees, but there are few better dessert beers around, IMO. With a dark chocolate cake, a cherry cheesecake, or other rich dessert this beer shines. But to my surprise, it goes nicely with lighter desserts too. For this tasting, I had it with a fresh raspberry and blueberry tart with B&J's vanilla ice cream and some excellent chocolate cookies. Absolutely perfect - the cherries and the sourness meld with the berries and the richness matches up well with the ice cream.

The traveler suggested that this ale was an exceptional find after finding it in storage in a cave.  I tried this after finding it in a very warm Shoreline store today. I tried the dark quadrupel and it looked like any dark Belgian ale. It poured well into an oatmeal head and it tasted like the dark ale of Westmalle with a slight bite to it.

Smells like brown bread and spice cake, with chocolate sauce, a little brandy, some fruit - black cherry, cherry preserves, peach.  Great creamy mouthfeel, very nicely controlled fizz. Sweet malt, spice cake, Christmas pudding. Nice fruit. Hint of chocolate sauce, less than nose. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but pleasant, like a faint whiff of brandy. Sweetness is restrained, for a quadrupel (thankfully). Faint bitterness, this must be balancing the sweetness. Really drinkable, for the style.  Delicious, and balanced.

The beer poured a deep hazy amber color with a thick tan head that disapated rather quickly and left behind a solid ring around the edge of the glass and some floating islands in the middle. The beer has a very distinct aroma of cloves, yeast, cherries and maybe some other dried fruits. Sweet and malty and hard to put down. The taste is a bit tart but balances out well with the cherry taste, malty sweetness and then rounds out with an alcohol kick on the back end which is pleasing to the palate.

Aroma: Fresh nose of grains, grass and a background suggestion of cherries. Fairly robust but refreshing, with mild raisin notes and a little alcohol spice developing as it warms.  Taste: Fantastic. Restrained chocolate, raisin, and apricot malts upfront, with a burst of cherries on the middle palate. Alcohol is pretty well masked, with just a slight vegetal finish in the throat. Mild grainy finish throughout the mouthful balances the sweet finish from the malts. Perfect balance of all flavors.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with medium but subdued carbonation. Easy in and easy the whole way down.  Drinkability: A great offering from the folks at Ommegang. Had the opportunity to drink this on-tap a few times at Zeno's in State College, PA, and enjoyed just as much now as I did then. Drinkable, well-balanced example of the style.

This one has some pinkish notes to it, though. Decent head sticks around, with lots of lacing.  Aroma is all dark fruits and caramel, but with some 'spritziness' to it, like someone squirted a bit of fresh lemon in it.  Taste is roasted malt, fresh cherries, and espresso. Really, really nice. Mild cough syrup notes as it warms, but that's ok. Medium body that avoids being syrupy (regardless of the flavour). Sweet chocolate-like aftertaste.

The color is an earthy dark brown with plenty of bubbles and even some tiny floaters.  Leathery smell comes on strong at the forefront, followed by dark fruits, also cherry and raspberry. Nice round maltiness in the nose. Good depth to the aroma, though quite subtle.  Oh yeah. Tastes sort of like an old ale, but sweeter. The leathery aroma also comes through in the flavors, adding a subtle dirtiness, or earthiness. Also strong cherry, smooth caramel and creamy milk chocolate. Slightly tart in the finish. Alcohol is superbly well-hidden. This is dessert-y, but the mouthfeel isn't thick or heavy. It's buoyant and bubbly while also being full-on creamy, which perfectly complements the wild and wonderful flavors dancing around.  Hard to pin down, but easy to love. Definitely on the sweet side, but you almost don't realize it because the flavors have so much depth. There are many sides to this one. Utterly enjoyable, a fantastic piece of work.

42,3457,Lupin,4.01,"I was going to get my friend a 1.5l magnum of duvel for a housewarming gift, but as I walked into New England Beverage Company, my eyes were diverted by a three liter magnum of this brew for $43. I'd had the abbey ale in the past and have some respect for that brew, but had always wanted to try this one.  Served, chilled, into highball glasses. Head on the first pour was monstrous. I actually had to interrupt my friend and show him how to properly pour a beer of the caliber, namely, with the assistance of a friend to hold the glass at a proper angle. Once poured correctly, the head was ideal. The magnum pours were absolutely filled with yeast. This stuff was murky, and dark splotches of caramel-colored yeast were the reward for the last pouree.  Upon redrinking this brew, it is not nearly as murky out of a 12 oz. bottle, but the same tasting notes still apply.  The malt hits you first, as does an almost sour/tangy hint of cherry. If they had chosen any other of Lindeman's Lambics, this would probably be too sour or too sweet. It's definitely not juicy, but perhaps a bit too yeasty. Very refreshing in the Boston sun nonetheless. Ambiguous fruity yeast is dominant, though. A little syrupy, but definitely not thin.  I like balance in beers, but drinking this one out of a 3l magnum was quite an experience. I've never seen so much yeast floating around in a beer without it bothering me. It actually tasted thicker out of a 12 ounce bottle with a far clearer pour.  This brew definitely needs to be tried if you like quadrupels for its fruity nuances. I would add .5 to both taste and drinkability if you could get this in a magnum.  Otherwise, there are plenty of other beers to explore if you're not into something as meaty as a quarupel. This isn't a proper introduction.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The aroma is rich a full of dark carmel malts The flavor begins with an excellent blend of sweet dark malts and dark cherries. The flavor segues into a dry crisp finish that has a warm alcoholic finish but isn't too hot or unpleasent at all. This is a red wine drinkers beer, I don't know how else to phrase what i am experiencing. The mouthfeel is crisp and full but it has a bit of a warm finish.

42,3457,andythejerk,3.32,"The least head I've ever seen on any belgian-style beer, but a beautiful dark, mahogany colored brew. Smells tight and pointedly fruity--kind of a flat and musty fruit. It's actual taste is not as fruity as I expected, especially since I still cringe at the thought of sickly-sweet lambic style, and I figured it would be a moderated version of that. Really, it's more of a sour, compromised version of a fairly good belgian ale. It's pretty good and definitely worth trying and enjoying, but it wouldn't be a priority for my personal future purchasing schedule. It's very different and interesting, and the 9.8% in this bomber is going to knock me out for the night.

Head started as a half finger of biege tiny bubbles, fades to a wispy cap with a halo ring around the glass. Lace was spotty.  Smell is sweet malts with plenty of fruity esters, raisin, apricot, and faintly earthy. Alcohol is well hidden from the nose.  Taste starts faintly sweet, malts, yeast, a cranberry-like tartness and alcohol.  A wine-like mouthfeel. Medium bodied.  It must be drinkable. I finished a 750ml during this review.

The head is a tad on the small side, but other than that, this is a good looking beer. Smell is like a quad, but a bit more sour. Ripe fruits with a tart bite. Taste is much like the smell. The beer starts out with a fruity sweetness, but toward the end of the drink, transitions smoothly into a sour note (in a good way). Mouthfeel is good. Full bodied, but a little alcoholic.

Taste: what a mess, how do i describe a taste so unique? this beer tightly maintains the characteristics of a quadrupel....the malts be sweet, the phenols be present, and the alcohol is there...but that touch of cherry lambic just puts this over the top. I love quads, i love strong beers, and i love unique beers. this taste captures these three criteria with honors.

A relatively small amount of tan head that nonetheless sticks around for a while and clings pretty well. Nose improved noticeably as this one warmed, with sweet but complex malts (reminding me of Scotch ales) tinged with sour cherry, spices, and a bit of alcohol. The taste too improved as the beer (and I) warmed. That malty-cherry-spicy blend faded nicely into a slightly warm and nicely lingering finish. The mouthfeel is intriguingly soft and full with a lasting crispness. While I will stick with some of Ommegang's other offerings, this one is worth another go.

42,3457,jettjon,4.02,"Highs: Appearance, nose Lows: A bit too bitter and too much alcohol presence  Pours a caramel brown, translucent, nearly opaque color, quite attractive. Head is initially large, thick, creamy, and a yellow-brown tannish color that fades very slowly leaving little lacing behind. Nose is excellent, heavy with dark fruits including dark cherriespretty standard for a quadrupel or dark ale. Taste is similarly characteristic: plums, apricots, and a strong dark cherry presence. Theres also quite a bit of alcohol at work here, and sadly, it detracts. Theres also an annoying bitterness, but both the alcohol and bitterness are diminished if the beer is sipped rather than gulped. Mouth is creamy, thick, and smoothvery smooth. Mouthfeel is excellent and adds to the enjoyability of this ale. Finishes up on an alcohol/bitter note, sort of a bitter fruit rind flavor that detracts from the overall flavor. Drinkability is good *as a sipping beer* but other than that is only a bit above averagethis is an acerbic beer to be sure.  Overall: An interesting take on the quadrupelthey claim to mix with a cherry lambic, and it shows, yielding a bittersweet, nearly syrupy concoction much better sipped than gulped, especially at 9.8% ABV. Not my favorite quadrupel, but worth a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Bitterbill,4.32,"Poured from caged and corked 750ml(2005-room temp) a deep amber with a huge head of foam that dissipates slowly leaving a fine layer with nice lacing.  The smell is a wonderfully sweet malt and cherry that explodes out of the bottle upon opening and continues from my New Belgium goblet.  The taste is a mix of caramel sweetness and cherry tartness, an unusual combination for my taste buds but the more I sip, the more I realize that this brew is quite enjoyable and the near 10%abv? I don't find it in the taste at all and after swallowing, there's just a slight warming. Good stuff!  Bottom line: This is a fine brew that I *know* I'll be trying again. I recommend it.  Edit, Nov 2 1010: My first bottle since my review, a 12ozer. As deliciously cherry tarty and with the same caramel sweetness as the 750ML bottles.

I could taste a little bit of sour wineyness in the finish. This is a very rich and warming brew that is very easy to drink despite the heavy body.

The head is a bit foamy then settles down to a nice thin head that retains is structure the entire time it is being consumed.  The nose has notes of stone fruit and sweet alcohol. The yeast comes through nicely as well. The mouthfeel is incredibly smoothe and rich. The cheeries are prominent and go well with the rest of the blend.

The scent of alchohol is subtly present on the nose mingling with lovely fruity notes (the cherry lambic is present though subtle) Also present on the nose are scents of caramel and faint scent of perhaps milk chocolate. Also earthy scents and some medicinal properties  Taste of cooked fruit, slight carmel malt character. The cherry lambic is definitly present. Not as many other notes that are present on the nose appear in the taste. A bit sugary...with some earthy flavors  Strong ammount of carbonation, very effervescent with a light and round mouth feel.

The notes of fruit and cherry are present just like in the nose. Also get some nice fresh baked bread flavors with a little of sourness. The complexity of the beer is just great my one issue is its a little on the sweet side.

This is by far the most carbonated beer I've ever encountered, the cork definitely did not fool around and kind of shot off with a little bit of twisting. Head is as you'd expect it, huge and foamy and rocky. Nice color, dark, translucent, good wall color.  Smell is huge, Belgian yeast, sugar, not a lot of the cherry thing, but tart smelling from the yeast maybe? Really well balanced, sweet, but with a really nice spine of tartness.  Taste is more of the same, but the Kriek makes a notable appearance and this works really well. Balance is the key, and this totally has that going on in many good ways.

42,3457,ultralarry2006,5,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Left a one finger head that was colored like espresso foam, that is, it was a biege-brown foam that receded after a while into surface skim that lingered until the end. Not really much in way of lacing. The body was deepest brown, maybe deepest maroon, almost black. Can see through it though, if you hold it up to the light.  Aroma - sweet candied fruit, chocolate, and phenols upfront, some bready malt, some caramelly malt even, in the middle and both some ester and alcohol solvency at the end.  Taste - exactly as nose indicates. Sweet dried and candied fruits ( think dates, plums, raisins ) Add to that a rich hearty sweet bread containing all those dried, candied fruits. The finish is of phenols and the tinyest hint of the high abv of almost 10%. No hop flavor to speak of. Aftertaste of raisiny, date-y, sweet rolls with a little hint of lemon ( there's the hops after all; maybe? ), and yet more of this taste if you lick your lips. Leaves you sweet and dry at the same time, with no bitterness at all, or parching dryness either, nor any kind of cloying sweetness at all. That hint of the alcohol from the high abv I mentioned?, well you kind of have to look for it, or just be aware that it's there to really taste it at all, which I think is always an excellent thing in a beer. Just well balanced deliciously rich ( but not nauseatingly so ) sweet malts and candied, dried fruits.This is excellent beer.  Mouthfeel - very full, moderately chewy, with very little carbonation. Slight hop oil coating. Finishes very dry, but not parchingly so, but does leave your mouth watering for the next sip.  Drinkablity - this goes down very easy, and is delicious! High abv limits it to one 750ml ( or two 12 oz.'ers ) per sitting. I was going to ding it a half point on this trait, but I just can't - it gets the full 5 -just excersize due diligence and repsonsilblity, you'll be wasted in no time flat after two 750's without seeing it coming because this excellent ale completely hides, and I mean completely hides, the potency of its high abv.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,blackie,3.95,"appearance: Pours a fluffy 0.8"" khaki head that slowly recedes, though only partially. Little lacing is left behind. The beer is a dark reddish amber in color, with plenty of floaters suspended throughout.  smell: Upon swirling the glass and inhaling deeply, wonderful aromas assault the palate, propelled forth by the ample carbonation. Tart and sweet cherries, fresh aromatic hardwoods, candied tree fruits, and dark sugars are found. The hop aroma seems light, but it may simply be overpowered by the other goodness going on. Nary a hint of the ethanol presence.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is on the lower half of the high range, and composed of small, smooth bubbles. The body is light.  taste: Wild and fruity notes up front. Hints of cherry, oak, slight ethanol, and various fruits are found. Moderate noble hop flavors are found, and considerable bitterness cleans everything up and dries out the finish. Not quite as pleasing as the aroma, but good nonetheless. Just not enough malt character or depth for me.  drinkability: Limited by the dryness, carbonation, and alcohol content (the effects, not the presence), but still good.  Purchased last August, and cellared about 8 months since then.  note: Sometime early in the winter of 2006-2007, probably around November, I had a 2003 bottle sent to me by goodbyeohio in ""These go to eleven...a bif,"" and it was absolutely awesome.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Crisp scent brings to mind green apples, cherries, and ripe plums. Slightly chalky, earthy hints of yeast.  Taste: Heavy on dark malts. Smooth caramel sweetness up front, with some fruity notes. Prunes, dark fruit. The foundation is sweet and a little earthy. Lightly sweet, tangy flavors of cherry and sour apple clash with the heavy, chewy richness of the dark malts. The alcohol is subdued in the middle, but it provides some explosive warmth in the finish.  Mouthfeel: A touch light-bodied for the style; it doesn't have the heavy, sticky feel of a St. Bernardus or a La Trappe. It has more body than the average beer, but it's lighter and a little crisper than the average quadrupel.  Verdict: I can't hate anything from Ommegang. I enjoyed this beer, but it didn't fully come together for me. The alcohol isn't as well hidden as it is in other quads, and I didn't think that the lighter fruit flavors were an ideal match for the rich caramel flavor of the malt.

There's some cherry flavor but it seems artificial and doens't really blend well with the other characters. There's some darker malt complexity but there's also a saccrine like sweetness. Flavor is a bit medicinal from the saccrine and what I pick up as cherry extract and not the real deal.  Full bodied and pretty warming in the stomach from the alcohol level.

Smell: You can smell the alcohol fairly well, as well as some nice malty scents, almost bread-like, and just a hint of the cherry lambic that's in the beer.  Taste: This is quite a powerful and complex beer. More complex than my palate is able to translate. That doesn't mean I didn't like it though. It's got a nice malty flavor, and it seems that (predictably) I tasted most of what I smelled. It's got a nice bready, malty taste, with just a hint of the cherry lambic. It's not a syrupy cherry taste at all. Very classy. At first sip it's very drinkable, not seeming at all like it's ABV would suggest. The finish is a nice, dry and warm, which balances nicely with the slight sweetness.  Notes: This is absolutely a big beer, and not something I'd want to drink too much of.

Smell is of alcohol, deep dark fruity undertones though, cherries abound (similar in this way to Mad Elf) I also detect some hops and malt but not enough to cut through the fruit and alcohol.  Taste-cherries up front, fruity undertones come alive here with mild traces of apple, banana, and even grape for me (not sure if that is correct) followed by a massive alcohol onslaught, this thing doesn't wait to kick as soon as it falls down your throat you feel it.  Mouthfeel is ok, heavy and thick but the alcohol is not hidden, still the fruit does help it out, that kick is wicked though.  Drinkability- a good belgian brew, a sipping beer like any quadrupel, could do without the kick but the fruit flavor is dominant as well making this quite enjoyable.  Overall-yikes, massive beer with lots of flavor but loads of alcohol kick as well, still definitely worth trying, I'd be interested to see what it would have tasted like on its own without the cherry lambic added, but still this is an interesting combonation brew and definitely worth trying.

I transferred it to a snifter, where it became quite luscious, full of cherries, banana, Scotch whisky, toffee, amaretto, bay leaves, and caramel malts that border on chocolate.  Taste: Subdued pie-like cherries, tangy yeast, spicy hops, smooth caramel malts. Good stuff.  Mouthfeel: Raw alcohol and hops make this a little rough on the palate.

The balance is good- nice, malty body, a spicy/hoppy/mineral backbone, and, best of all, a restrained, tart, pure cherry essence. There is some alcohol there as well, but not out of proportion.

A - What a look. A reddish brown that really looks a translucent ruby red when held to light with a nice off white head sitting atop.  S - A lot coming at you on the nose. That Belgian yeasty smell leads but that cherry smell from the lambic blend, along with a caramelly sweet malt is kicking around on the nose. Very complez aromas.  T - In the taste I;m getting a lot of yeastiness along with the cherry taste coming through. Much tarter cherry taste than I expected. The alcohol tinges as well and the brew also has a spiciness that won't quit. Also a bit of a smoky flavor towar dthe finish/aftertaste. Nice overall.  M - A very chewy full bodied brew. Feels nice in the mouth.  D - A ton of complexity here, makes you want to sip and analyze. Only complaint is I;m picking up a tiny metallic tinge that I;ve noticed in all Ommegang brews, however here it's masked and/or blended with so many other flavors that it's opk with me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,mattcrill,4.03,"Aroma: Fruity esters that remind you of cherries, plums, and raisins. A bit of yeast spiciness and clove notes also brush the nose.  Appearance: A deep cloudy copper-brown pour with a thick and creamy looking head. The retention is beautiful.  Flavor: A cherry sourness on the palate and first that lends itself to a sweeter middle and a drying slightly phenolic finish. There are peppery notes throughout and the cherry essence keeps coming back. It doesn't dominate but it's noticeable and quite enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation, a warming alcohol presence, and a slightly astringent feel (probably from the cherries).  Overall impression: A sipper that should be enjoyed. Amazing complexity. The alcohol was a little too prominent and took away some of the enjoyment for me. Nicely done. A good choice for my 400th formal BA review.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bennetj17,3.78,"Dark ruby color that glows in the light, fairly hazy. Thin head disappears rapidly into a frothy ring. The aroma has light notes of fruity sweet malt, perhaps raspberry or cherry, with a slight nuttiness. The is initially cinnamon sweet malt, becoming more fruity with winey and cherry notes. The finish is fairly unremarkable, with the strong alcohol showing itself a bit. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but nice and bubbly. Decent drinkability, needs more finish to round it out, also a bit alcoholic...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,tom444,3.83,"750mL bottle w/ cork.  Pours a deep brown with a heavy tan head.  Initial aroma is of a malty sweetness, with some citrusy and spicy notes, and a bit of bourbon-like alcohol.  Thick, creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Plenty of dark malt flavor, with some herbal and medicinal notes and just a little bit of hop bitterness. Some warming alcohol on the finish.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,MagicLantern,3.58,"Poured into a Snifter.  A: Heavy taupe head settles to a 1/4"" lace that clings to edges of glass. Notes don't tell me how the head settles at the center of the glass, a second review will correct this oversite. Caramel brown darkening towards center. So thick, only translucent at edges of glass, though couldn't see my fingers even at the edge of glass. Darkness of beer prevents one from seeing carbonation.  A great looking quad.  S: Cherry! A malty smell with carmel and spice. Cherry is very clear and overpowering. It's appetizing and inviting.  T: Malt and carmel combine to make this a slight coffeesque tasted with an overpowering cherry lambic on top. While the carbonation isn't easily seen, it's evident in the taste mixing with the spice to give this beer a slight bite. No alchohol taste, or at least very well hidden.  M: This is a smooth beer, that ends with a carbonated bitter bite, followed by the cherry lambic. The cherry is incredibly strong and nearly overpowering. It's almost two seperate beers in one. Tasting it is pleasant, but the swallow changes the beer to an bitter cherry end. It's kind of tough until one gets use to it.  Drinkability: This is a hard one. I am not a fan of Cherry. I take them off my ice cream and shakes. Having said that, I've been told this a great brew and I wanted to try it. I think I've been fair in my review overcoming my dislike of Cherry. I'm new to reviewing beers and I haven't always been certain what lambic is. This beer made it very clear to me. I immediately realized 'that's the cherry lambic!"" I personally found the cherry incredibly strong and it made it hard for me to drink this quad. Having said this I love quads and continued through. As I got use to it, it became easier to drink. Having said that, I did toss out my drink rather than finish it.  I want to be fair so I'm going to get another and try it. I want to overcome my aversion of cherry, but it's unlikely that I would ever drink this regularly. Because of the cherry, perhaps I'd open one at a celebration, a party with good friends or something. If you like Cherry dig in. If you don't like Cherry avoid. Finally I'm told the pleasant flavor and I enjoy at the beginning and the unpleasant cherry that finishes the brew 'merge' if this is aged. I am definetly going to age a bottle to find out and see if this improves over time. I'm also going to review this beer to make sure I've been fair to it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.03,"This is a wonderful beer. I enjoyed it as a cordial towards the end of the evening. Ended up capping it with a cleaver capping device, and was able to enjoy it the following day. I had been off Belgian for a while; they seemed to overpowering, this was a ""subtle"" reminder of what powers be held within these beers.  A wonderful rich body, glowing with caramel and vanilla flavors. Topped of by a very thick head. Almost like a soda float of some type. Alcohol everywhere in this one, listed @ 9.8, but hits like a 14+. A little hard to get through the bottle.

Sweet , grassy. No hop notes , but the cherry is evident.  Taste has a sweet/sour lambic balance , normally handled by sweet/bitter hops. Hops do come through slightly on the finish.  Mouthfeel is thick , syrupy , very highly carbonated.  Drinkabitly of this 10%'er is pretty good.  I was hesitant to try this with cherry-lambic added, but overall found it refreshing.

Aroma of dark cherry syrup, caramel and brown sugar, some figginess. Fruity alcohol esters.  Dark fruity dusted lightly with cocao on the palate. Juicy cherries through the middle. Almost citric tartness in the semi-dry finish.  Smooth and hugely carbonated -- belch inducingly so. A unique and complex offering from Ommegang.

42,3457,3Vandoo,4.24,"new review on Nov 17th 2019.  Very deep dark burgundy with no head retention.  When I openned the bottle a deep odor of bread yeast  In glass a sweet candy like smell with fruity easter with a shy banana flair.

42,3457,scottoale,3.91,"Brewed in 2005, nice corked 750ml. brown bottle. Uncork and slow pour a dark copper-mahogany ale that yields a billowing tan, frothy head that lasts till the finish. The carbonation is lively which keeps growing, tons of thick lacing as well.  First off the nose is cherries, sweet candied cherry with some caramel, cranberry and malt after notes. Very fruity and floral. Very intriguing to say the least.  Rich malty, cherry flavor with a velvety, somewhat chewy consistency fills your mouth...quite savory. Tantilizing the tastebuds all the while, down it with the finish, a bit tart and tangy as well as warming. This stuff has a complexity that's almost overwelming. It just leads you wanting more.  Mouthfeel is great with the full body and superb carbonation that this true to style ale is loaded with. It's the kind of beer that you must drink slowly to appriciate it's abundant qualities (and it's potency) yet the taste keeps you wanting more. Damn good stuff...Cheers !",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Birdiebeagle,3.75,"750 ml bottle Pours a cloudy dark amber brown with a good fizzy light brown head. Very good lacing on the glass, head diminshed in average time. Aroma is of carmel and cherries. Taste has good carbonation. The sweetness blended nicely. It doesnt overpower the beer. Has an astringent aftertaste, but a short finish. Has a sherry wine like flavor. The correct glass will help you appriciate this one. I got it in a gift pack that came with it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,daliandragon,3.9,"I love the name and design of this beer. I picked one up a few weeks ago and invited two old friends over hoping we could drink it and emulate the name. Instead one friend got wasted on two Warsteiners and the other brought his girlfriend who talked all night while they both drank all my beer. Oh well. Dark, attractive color with a ruby tinge and a thick head that eventually dissipates to a cap. Nose is thick with chocolate malt and alcohol and has a spicy, heavy, aroma. Dark and rich taste that hides the alcohol as well as it can, but 9.8% cannot be completely hidden, methinks. This beer compares favorably with most other dark Belgians I've tried. I taste the lambic and think it mellows the taste but the malt and the depth of texture is what defines this brew for me. If you like Belgian style beer, you'll almost indubitably enjoy this offering from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The yeastiness is sharp in the flavor with some roasted nuts and a slightly sweet aftertaste. The cherry flavor increases as it warms. The mouthfeel is a little sticky with lots of carbonation.

42,3457,Tupperwolf,4.17,"Pours a rich dark-chocolate brown with light brown and ruby highlights into my FABulous new Trappiestes Rochefort gold-rimmed goblet; It forms a fluffy, bubbly centimeter head of tawny tan head that soon fades to a light skim and a very thin ring around the big, deep chalice's rim. Dark, gently brooding.  The scent is dark, dark fruits, a slightly alcoholic medicine with slight fresh greenery notes, maybe a little bit of mint or floral spice. Slight notes of fantastically rich butterscotch.  A heavy flavor kicks off each sip of this (be sure to allow proper time to warm to truly appreciate the rich, hearty flavors!) - Rich, decadent malts are a deep, lustrous, smoky caramel; A delicious alcohol middle is chock full of deceiving flavor, and the finish is doubly complex, full of tart fruits at first, and then a distinct twinge of cherries - You can, if you pay attention, taste the cherry lambic. The description of this brew is strange, never heard anything like it, but if you want to think about it hard enough, you can taste it. If you don't think about it, this beer is simply a good-tasting, very interesting Belgian that does nothing wrong. I wonder how much they had to pay Lindeman's to use their Kriek in the creation of this beer? I don't see any real connection between the two oceans-apart brewries other than this single beer, so it's quite a unique concoction indeed.  The mouthfeel is creamy, with a gentle carbonation that can go completely unnoticed if you're not payint attention. It's enough to create a very tiny tingle on the tongue, bringing out the flavors. A medium body is lightened by the warmth of alcohol. It's easy and enjoyable to drink.  I remember, several months ago, being afraid to try this because I didn't know what the heck 'cherry lambic' was, and I thought 'fruit beers' were some kind of evil hybrid style that should be denounced at all costs. Simply stated, how wrong I was.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Luigi,4.23,"Dark ruby brown with a light brown head. Great lacing. The aroma is slighty fruity and alcoholic. Some hints of licorice. The taste is full of dark malty flavors. Kind of sweet and sour from the cherry lambic blended in the ale. Has a herbal bitterness as well. The finish is slighty dry with a touch alcoholic sweetness.

Not a whole lot of candi present which is okay by me.  Interesting taste. Nutty flavors. Sweet candi and yeast. Overripe cherries or strawberries. A spourness is present as well. Maybe that is what contributes the earthy/dirt smell. I dont know.  Pretty big bodied and sticky mouthfeel. A bit cloying. Leaves a resin on the tongue and teeth.  Drinkable.

Lambic notes bordering on mild, slight yeast detected, no funk perse but just some dry tones as per the yeast working the quad. hard to judge something that is a blend.  taste etc... a bit too thin, but the carbonation was right on, on first sip it seemed like a total kriek but it yields to the yeast... to detriment ? There is zero sourness of the lambic side and not enough assertiveness on the quad side to satisfy a fan of either style. It drinks rather easy but if that is all you want you can drink high end vodka. It seems to be a beer hedging its bets, sure, it has kriek notes and quad notes but it doesn't accomplish either in a fashion that makes you say wow. So both style wind up tasting average as a blend...  vedict? had to try it on tap as presented... but I won't be searching this out again. It wasn't great in bottles (the idea is) and it wasn't great on tap... it was worth trying, but there were better offerings on tap.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Phatz,4.58,"The presentation is a classy 750ml corked and caged bottle. Cleary dated 2004 across the top label.  Appearance: Pours a dark orange brown plumby color. It is hazy in appearance. A little light might squeak through but it not transparent at all. I'd call it barely translucent to nearly opaque. A light tan head fades quickly.  Smell: Sugary! Dark! The smell is really good. The first thing that hit my nose was a brown sugar followed by a dark fruit smell. There is a subtle yeast hint in the aroma and in the taste as well.  Taste: As in the smell the taste is sugary sweet but not over sweet. Its just right. After the brown sugar maple syrup flavor there is a fantastic plum mango apricot sweet fruit taste that slides so incredibly smoothly across the palate. There are also hints of yeast, apples, caramel, black cherries (and dark fruits in general). The malt character is very bold and defined and the hop character is pleasantly gentle and barely showing itself through the sweet sugar aftertaste.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: This is remarkably smooth and enticing. The mouthfeel is a medium bodied somewhat slippery and superbly easy to swallow. It is a highly drinkable beer. Each sip is such a treat for the palate (taste) and the mouth (texture). However you must be careful! The 9.80% ABV will sneak up on you like an evil bastard and next thing you know the bottle is empty and can't remember you own phone number :) That problem is not always a bad thing but wow this is a freaking awesome beer! I highly recommend!!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Very sweet with distinct graininess. Strong alcohol flavor without the burning. I'm not sure why that is. Slight toffee flavor. Ridiculously smooth mouthfeel. This brew is great. A bit dry on the palate. Still lots of dark fruits in the finish. This is a great brew. I can't wait for the bottle in the cellar to get some age on it. Grab a bottle of this or I'll hunt you down.

42,3457,falloutsnow,3.11,"Brewed in 2004. A: Pouring into a large wine glass, a thin, light-tan head is produced over the dark amber liquid. The minimal head fades within a minute, leaving a few clusters of foam around the glass. Vigorously swirling and smelling allows the beer to streak lacing down the glass' sides, enhancing its display. S: Dominating the scent is the maltiness of the beer; aside from the requisite alcohol scent, I detect little else. The Belgian yeast seems to be buried underneath and only the slightest of hints of the cherry lambic filter through. There does not seem to be any bittered fruit or plum, fig, raisin smells as one can encounter from the style, especially when mixed with kriek. T: As foreshadowed by the smells, most of the beer seems to be focused on its malt aspects; clearly, the bulk of this beer is devoted towards its caramel malt origins. The sweetness is tempered by a mild peppery and yeast taste as one would expect from a Belgian ale. No detectable hop presence, but it does finish with a slight alcohol taste. From my perspective, the people who claim to taste cherries and chocolate are either playing up the effect or letting their expectations cloud their senses; I could detect very little. There are other quadrupels with more balance tethered to scent and flavor depth/undertones than this one, hence the average. M: Light to medium mouthfeel with a well-designed amount of carbonation to make the beer smooth and go down pleasantly. D: Three Philosophers did not come across as well-balanced or providing much in terms of depth or subtle flavors/smells. The malt power is just ""on part"" for the style. Given its high alcohol content without much reward in terms of other aspects, this one doesn't strike me as much to rave about. Perhaps 2004 was a bad year...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Dried sweet-tart cherries, dried cranberries, tawny port, iodine, alcohol, a little dried sweetness and a longish slightly bitter dry finish.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a brew of this gravity. Though overall it is a medium-heavy bodied brew.

S: Nice aromas of dark cherries, biscuits, and caramel with a slight alcoholic aroma. The cherries almost give this the aroma of a light red wine.  T: The brewer's at Ommegang did a nice job of blending just the right amount of kreik with this - the cherry taste is definitely present, but not overwhelming. The lambic's tart character shines through in this beer, giving it some personality that it might otherwise be lacking.  M: The tartness makes the mouth pucker (in a good way), and the alcohol has a nice warming effect. This one has a nice full body and a very complimentary amount of carbonation.

42,3457,numenor1,2.9,"I had this again 10/24/06. I was too kind last time.  Pours a cherrywood color with a decent enough head that dissapears to almost nothing, not what i'd expect of a quadrupel. Smells of cherry and alcohol. Taste is initially candy cherry, cough drop cherry without so much menthol. Medicinal. To be fair, this fades a bit and there are other flavors underneath, but this overwhelms them, sadly. Any subtleties are masked, and it's pretty much cherry alcohol riding through to the finish. Phenolic, fusels even? Mouthfeel is quite nice though, full, with nice carbonation. Not very drinkable at all. Slow sipping is tolerable, but why would I want to? Interesting idea, quadrupel+lambic but in the end not so good. I've had this brew a few times, didn't like it before and thought maybe i'd age it a bit to see if it improved, and it did, but only so far as to mute everything and make it less offensive.

Distinctive Belgian smell, enhanced by a background scent of tart cherries. Not overpowering.  Very complex taste. Malty, yeasty, fruity, in different layers as the beer warmed up.  High ABV warmed as it went down, but the alcohol taste was well hidden.  Very interesting flavor. Great bargain for the price.

As the alcohol scent fades and the aromas of cherries and sweet malts is notable. The alcohol is the first thing that hits you when you take that first drink. Quickly following the alcohol there is a notable cherry flavor but not as strong as I thought it would be. This has got to be one of my favorite brews of all time, I have got to find this brew again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Edwin,4.6,"Served in a Three Philosophers goblet from a 750ml bottle received for being in Jaysus' wedding.  Appearance - Pours a beautiful ruby red/brown with a nice little tan head. A beauty to behold.  Smell - A fruity, grainy blend. I think I smell a hint of banana, but that could be just me. Some caramel in there. Love it.  Taste - Awesome. Cherry-like notes with an alcohol and malty tinge. Has a bread-like wine taste to it. Sweet and bitter at the same time. I love this brew.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth. Goes down easy with some alcohol burn.  Drinkability - One or two max, but definitely high on my list when available. Gotta dock points here for the sheer power.  Overall - I loved it. An inspired brew that has a great flavor and a nice balance. I Cracked it for PSU/FSU. Go Lions!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Hautacam,4.08,"This poured with a good frothy tan head that reduced, but lasted. Color was dark red/brown...almost burnt orange when held up to light. Smell..slight cherry, not overpowering...malty, earthy. Taste , pretty complex , but balanced. Malty and sweet, cherry is there , doesn't dominate ...some other slight fruit..can't really tell what these are specifically..maybe raisans ? I don't taste any chocolate. Alcohol comes through, but is balanced with all the other flavors; and the finish was sweet,but just barely. Mouthfeel was medium...surprizing...I thought it would be heavier. I really like this ale, but don't think I could drink more than a glass... well maybe if you twisted my arm.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TheEclecticGent,4.5,This Quad has a deep amber red color with a ½ inch light brown head of thick carbonization in my chalice-style glass. The smell is of aromatic fermented fruit with light cherry overtones. The taste is smooth with a bit of ethereal warming qualities. The flavor is a woody and cherry experience with a hint of caramel. The mouth feel is full and slightly fizzy with that ethereal feel after the swallow. This beer was one of my early Belgium favorites.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,beerphilosopher,3.61,"Poured into a wide-mouth goblet from a 12 oz bottle.  A - Gorgeous dark ruby color with a thick light tan head and very persistent retention.  S - Heavy fruits - raisins, prunes, and persimmons (spelling?). Molasses and caramel malt.  T - Betrayed by the smell, this one has a heavy malty character with intermingling dark fruits throughout. The Caramel/molasses characteristic is predominant to me, while the fruitiness is more non-descript and subdued. It's difficult to tell that this is infused with cherry lambic. I taste fruit to some extent ... i just can't tell which fruit without the prior knowledge from the label.  M - Thick, but not overly heavy. Balance decidedly toward the caramel malt sweetness without being cloying. Subtle alcohol warming.  D - I couldn't finish more than a single 12 oz offering of this in any one sitting ... just a little too sweet for me. It's warm and rich, but doesn't lend itself to a quantity in my opinion. Might be good warmed, with spices!  This is a good ale, but I fear it didn't meet my expectations in every regard. Perhaps they were too high, as I've been wanting to try this one for a while now. A solid offering nontheless ... I would have thought it possibly a slightly higher ABV for a quadrupel ...? If you like the heavy, malty sweetness in a Belgian style beer, then you'll likely very much enjoy this one. Very molasses-like to me. I'm sure this one is intended to be, but it's not my very favorite style. For the style, it's good ... maybe very good.  I'd try it again but am in no real hurry to do so. I'm going to try the Rare Vos next ...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Deep crimson with a sticky white head and a generous amount of lacing.  Smell is raisiny and pruney- lots of dark fruits- and sweet. Taste is not the yummiest ever- raisins and coffee with a background bitterness. A bit on the sweet side for me- perhaps this guy needed time to blend better. Mouthfeel is very, very smooth, though a tad bit watery.  Overall, fairly drinkable for the style and alcohol content.

42,3457,nlmartin,4.03,Poured from the bottle into a wide mouthed goblet.  Appearance: The beer poured a fantastic copper to deep ruby coloration. The head was a towering caramel coloration. The head had considerable staying power. Thick lacing remained behind on the glass.  Smell: The beer smelled of fruity goodness. There was the playful interaction of cherry and apples combined. The beer was malty sweet with cinnomin and caramel drifting about.  Taste: The beer was true to smell. The beer had an understated cherry apple combination that went well with caramel malts and cinnomin. The beer had a some spicy notes playing along.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied and well carbonated. The sweetness is in balance with the spicy contrast. Alcohol is well masked.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell: Mango and alcohol combine for a strong smell.  Taste: Fruit and alcohol flavors dominate. There is a lot of carbonation that masks much of the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, which masks the flavor. Not terrible but doesn't amaze.  Drinkability: Its pretty drinkable for how much alcohol is in it. Though I couldn't drink alot, I would not shy away from it if it was offered. A decent North American replication of a Belgian style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,clabaugh,3.86,"Appearance: Pours a deep, deep ruby red. A bubbling, beige colored head develops. The head seems to crawl on top of the beer. Lacing is wonderful, leaving a solid ring coating the inside of the glass.  Smell: Some caramel malts, as well as grape. The cherry presence in this beer is not as obvious as expected. The hops mask themselves well in the scent, but are evident in a subtle estery aroma. Very inviting and sensual in the nose.  Taste: An intense backbone of caramel malt and barley. Cherries are readily recognizable in taste, despite their aloofness in smell. Hops are still very subtle, but present in a kind of floral flavor. Some nectar is definitely detectable.  Mouthfeel: Rich, full-bodied, and warming. A pleasing sensation on the tongue. Creamy and satisfying.  Drinkability: A bit filling, but flavorful and inviting. Adequate drinkability, due to the flavor. I don't crave this one as much as I expected to. A fine brew, but not exceptional.  Notes: Definitely a surprise considering its comparing itself to a lambic. A little bland I must admit. Fine beer otherwise.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ski271,4.77,"Pours a deep reddish-brown with a large, light tan, foamy, thick head with very good retention. Some light lacing all the way down. The smell is a marvelous blend of caramel malt, Belgian yeast, cherry, herbs, alcohol and fruit esters, and light bubble gum. The taste is sweet, with huge malts, prune, cassis, tobacco and a late sting of fruit. The finish is long, warming and sweet. It has a medium body, and the silky texture and effervescent carbonation give this a spectacular mouthfeel. This is one outstanding Belgian!

42,3457,asabreed,4.23,"1 pint 9.4 oz bottle poured into my Delirium Tremens glass. 2004 vintage.  Appearance: Nice electrically amber and bubble-bursting body. Lots of lacing on the glass, with a head that's amped up and really doesn't want to dissipate at all.  Smell: Yeast and sour cherries up front. Some raisin and molasses sweetness and some figs too. The craziness of sweet malts up there too. The balance is awesome but with the complexity I was hoping for more.  Taste: Yeast, sour cherries. The craziness of sweet malts up there too. Finishes with beautiful sour cherries and some slight dryness. The fig and raisin sweetness is there too. Once again, could be more complex, but the balance is awesome. And seriously, the finish is amazing, which certainly boosts it up to a 4.5.  Mouthfeel: Creamy stuff, carbonation levels are awesome. A thicker body, but not cloying or anything like that.  Drinkability: A very balanced and quality brew. Ommegang has never disappointed me. And, let's face it, for about $7 a bottle this is beyond a steal. Certainly pick one up. I can't wait to cellar some of these.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,jaluria,4.55,"Pours an opaque, murky-looking black with a brown colored head that stays put and leaves behind intricate lacing. Aromas of alcohol, grapes, and leather are apparent, but the alcohol definitely dominates. The taste is a bit more 'porter' or 'imperial stout' like than is typical for this style. An interesting combination of fruit, candy sugar, and drying bitterness. In my mouth, this beer feels like liquid leather in that it is overly viscous and sticky. It felt like I was drinking something I shouldn't be; motor oil, discharged broth from a fermentation tank, etc. But that is the beauty of this beer, it combines two styles so well that is absolutely unique. I enjoyed the taste of this beer very much and was interested in more even with the high ABV.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GolgiIPAratus,4.32,"Sampled: 12.03.05  A thick creamy head of foam rests on a ruby highlighted bronze liquid; very little lacing results.  The first smell you get is the cherries from the blend of the lambic. Under that is some darker flavors of molasses and brown sugar. Some familiar Belgian malts are also present. The whole aroma is capped by a slight winey smell, very enticing and impressive overall.  The flavor is immediately tart and sour cherries, but soothed by rich, dark malts. More Belgian familiarity lurks in the deep dark taste. The tartness up front never really takes over and is really balanced by the maltiness. Im extremely impressed, as I mustve been in some mind-numbing vortex when I purchased the bottle and completely missed the Cherry Lambic part of the Blend. So, finding that it didnt over power the brew was a great thing. The beer is light despite its type and some oily resins are left behind. Not much alcohol really apparent considering its heft.  This is pretty damned easy to drink at 9%. The flavor is great and should be savored. But I will definitely go back for more of this on occasion.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Opethsprite,4.02,"Pours a rich, ruby red/brown with no head to speak of. Smells like deep chocolate...but not that horrible, fake, burnt smell. It's much more subtle. I think it's the presence of a milky-ness. There's a pleasant subtle grainy taste (along with the smooth chocolate), and a pleasant hoppy bite. A delicious beer!!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,barknee,4.15,"3P's pours with a moderately chunky head, settling to a sturdy 1/8"" chunky slick with staying power. Color of slightly less than opaque cola with visible carbonation and generous sediment suspended throughout the glass. This I have no issue with. Agitation aerates the surface resulting in good creamy foam on top and coats the glass nicely. The Nose offers some chocolate, Belgian yeast and cardamom. The spicy notes are held in slight abatement giving this brew a classy character rather than being totally off the wall flamboyant. The flavor is rich and buttery, malty and reminiscent of lightly roasted hazelnut. The flavors linger for a minute + with essence of sticky molasses, ground cherry, (aka Physalis pruinosa) and lightly roasted nuts and a pleasant saltiness on the lips. Creamy and expansive in the mouth, this is another fine product from Ommegang. Finishes just short of dry with drinkability being surprisingly great.

42,3457,jamesdergen,4.57,"Appearance: Pours a dark, cloudy almost opaque amber/burgundy with a small tan head that sticks around for the duration.  Smell: Big sweet almond aromas mixed with the dark fruits. Excellent.  Taste: Dark, dried fruits with sweet bread and oak in the background. The alcohol is very well-hidden. I'm not really picking up any of the cherry lambic flavors here.  Mouthfeel: Light and well-carbonated, maybe a bit much.  Drinkability: This one goes down easy, maybe too easy... The alcohol is almost undetectable and it's the cost of the beer that is keeping me sipping.  This is one of my favorite brews of all time.

No hint of yeast, which is little surprising for a Belgian style ale. Taste is sweeter then expected with a strong malt body and a hint of kriek lambic at the end.

I poured half of this 750 mL bottle into each snifter (as indicated on the back of the bottle) and observed a beautiful huge tan head rise form the dark, almost ruby body. The lacing was phenomenal, and the head took minutes to dissapate. When it finally died down, the aroma was of dark fruits, perhaps sour cherry, malts, yeasts and subtle hops. The taste was certaily Belgian, with extremely complex flavors, a lot of alcohol (yet not overpowering) and yeasts. the feel was somwaht carbonated as it pased the tongue, and slightly acidic and puckering, but overall very pleasant.

Three Philosophers poured a very dark brown with an inch or so of tan, large bubbled head. The head retained well and left big, holey lacing on the side of the glass. The beer's nose was of a doughy smell along with undertones of fruitiness: a truly excellent smelling beer. A complex flavor with some sourness to the medium body that predominated with malt and cherry. Pretty drinakble, although a sipping beer for sure.

A-Sweet, dried orange aroma is dominant. Yeasty, fruity esthers fill the nose very nicely. I can tell this is going to be sweetened by the kriek lambic  T&M-Sweet up front followed by an intense malt backbone. A huge belgian yeast characteristic punches through past the lambic sweetness. The overall kriek presence is a bit cloying for my taste.  D-Very interesting to say the least. I have not come across anything like this before and I think the concept is very unique. This can be interpreted either way, but for me, I will probably go for others over this.

When I sampled the 2005 I knew that I wanted to taste this beer with a little time on it to see what developed. Luckily I found a 2004 bottle since then to find out.  The beer still looks incredible with a deep brownish-red color and a decent head that dissapates as you sip it.  The smell stills hints at cherries, and is a little astringent.  The taste also has more cherry flavor than I would have imagined at this point in time. I guessed this would have mellowed somewhat more, but it compliments the beer well. There are earthly flavors and some phenols. Although it has mellowed somewhat, the ABV is still noticeable at the end of every sip. The beer appears to have blended it's flavors, and it still boasts incredible complexity. This brew has stood up well to the time, and I think it would be good for some time to come in the cellar.  Drinkablity is still a little low. It's a sipping beer for sure to me.  Very much worth putting one in the cellar.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Aroma presents with a sour fruitiness backed by a malty sweetness. Nice complexity and mix. Appealing cherry red admists a brownish amber. Full, somewhat dense head that leaves pretty weakly. Flavor is less intense than the aroma and not quite as pleasing. Sourness is stronger, but with less of the fruitiness or sweetness. Yeasty quality is strong and not blended as well as I'd like. Alcohol flavors are low, but non-exsistent. Full carbonation that's fairly soft and not quite effervescent. Medium body. Pretty intense drink.

Soft, frothy head has good retention , which you'd expect from a well-made quadrupel  Nose is sweet, spicy overripe fruit. Apples and Pears and cherry, tempered just a little by a hint of alcohol.

Lots of undulations happening here, but not as many as some of the more complex belgians. In fact, I was expecting a little more complexity.  Full chewy mouthfeel. Soft with little pricks of alcohol and carbination. Carbination may be just a bit more than ideal.  Overall a very accomplished belgian.

Overall impression: Nice belgian style ale with some added complexity from the kriek. Very enjoyable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GClarkage,4.08,"10/02/05- Purchased at Beltramo's in Menlo Park, CA  Presentation- 750ml bottle from 2004. Poured into a La Chouffe tulip.  Appearance- Top of the pour is a darker brown, while the bottom is a dark cherry red color. 3/4 inch off white head with above average sticky clinging lace.  Smell- Sweet dull caramel malt scent with dark cherry with maybe a touch of chocolate in the background.  Taste- Slight sour lambic taste. Barleywine-esque caramel flavor with super dark cherries. Medium bitter hops finish. Alcohol shows itself about 1/2 the bottle in.  Mouthfeel- Lower carbonation, medium thickness and light warming.  Drinkability- Let this one warm to room temp before drinking. The flavors come out so much better. Haven't really had a beer that taste like this one before. This one would go great with a dessert with fruit. Will have again in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,wcudwight,3.78,"Deep dark burgundy in color. Little head & lacing. Kind of a spicy caramel oder with a slight wiff of alcohol. Taste is strong and complex. Spicy and Fruity. A bit too strong and complex for me, but some may love this. For such a strong taste mouthfeel is thin, but well carbonated. This beer really sneaks up on you. I like that. Certainly not a beer I would buy everyday, but maybe one purchasing for that special occasion or to age in the cellar.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TurdFurgison,3.8,"Presentation: Poured from a 750ml bottle into watou chalice.  Appearance: Dark red brown, whitish tan head.  Smell: Belgian yeast fest, some cherry hues.  Taste: I can't say the taste is everything I hoped for. I think this has kriek mixed in with a quad, so I expected a more interesting mix of flavors. Nonetheless, this had a decidedly Belgian style bent to it.  Notes: OK, actually very good for the price (&lt;$5.00 for 750mL). Probably will buy again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,smcolw,4.2,"Good beige head with light lace. A cross between a dark amber and brown ale in color.  First impression, strong vanilla aromas. The cherry is subtle, but present, in this largely malt smelling ale.  Very strong alcohol oiliness in the taste. The malt appears in the form of mildly sweet caramel. Although a lambic was introduced to this beer, there is none of the sourness associated with that style. Moderate body for this style (which is to say that it is very, very rich) and the carbonation is relatively low.  I'm not typically a fan of this style, but this was a treat--certainly a well made Belgian style ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,qcitydarkstar,4.25,"This review is for the 2005 release of Three Philosophers (Brewery Ommegang) in a 750ml bottle.  The best way to describe this beer is that it has the palate, nose, and character of classic Belgian Strong Ales, without the import price. I think I paid $6.59 for the 750ml bottle.  One comment I would like to make that I find odd about this beer is that it is unlike any Belgian Quadrupel I've ever had before. The color is dark and murky like a Dubbel and does not have the alcohol sting that I associated with the Quadrupel style. With that said, this beer is quite enjoyable, with a pleasant cherry finish.  One question: Does anyone know what percentage of this ale is Kriek?",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,CarolinaCardinals,3.79,"Picked up a 750 ml bottle at AJ's back in May 2005 for $4.39.  Pours a nice deep red color accompanied by a nice long lasting head - 4.0. Nose is heavy of cherry, reminds me of a cherry based dessert - 3.5. First taste was a blast of alcohol but that has blended into a predominately cherry malt flavor with subsequent sips - 3.5. Mouthfeel is nice and full and well carbonated-4.5. Overall drinkability is OK but the high abv and the cherry is a bit much-3.5.  Re-review 1-25-2018: Picked up a 2016 edition single from TW Arrowhead on 12-17-17 for 4.99...my how the price has come up on this!  Beer poured brown with a nice head with the original pour. Classic quad look. 4.0 Nose is cherry forward with some hints of dark fruits from the yeast esters. 3.75 Taste of cherry was prevalent in the first sips. Subsequent sips also showcased dark fruits and reduced cherry. 3.75 Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth. 4.0 Overall a pretty solid beer but it does not rate up there with Boulevard's quad variants. - 3.75",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The taste is sweet and of cherries and a hint of alcohol The mouthfeel is rich and smooth with a nice crispness added by the carbonation. Drinkability is good but because it is sweet and higher in alcohol I couldnt see drinking more than 1 or 2 in one sitting. I would recommend you pick one up next time you get the chance.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,cubedbee,4.03,"12 oz bottle. Poured into a tulip, dark brown with some hints of red, large two fingers of cofee-colored head. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells a lot like cherry cough syrup, more alcohol and a little more natural kind of cherry, but still similar. Some other sweet notes of candi sugar, prunes, and figs, and a hint of spices. Taste is more of the same sweetness, with all the fruitiness coming in again, especially the cherry, over a sort of caramelly malt base. Some cinammon spiciness comes into play towards the end. Alcohol is noticeable from the first sip, but it blends in pretty well with the flavors, and doesn't ever get to the point where it takes away from the beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a smooth somewhat slick coating feel. Overall this is another good beer from Ommegang, a good example of the style, but a little too strong and in your face to drink more than 1 or 2.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ichigodisaster,3.65,"Pours a a very dark garnet into my glass with a head that fades to a very lovely lace like the surface of the moon (have to agree with hyuga there).  The cherry scent is almost assaulting with a hint of green apple and maybe some brown sugar.  This really tastes like alcohol soaked fruit cake.Very sweet initially from the cherry lambic, slightly woody with a bit of tartness on the finish. The alcohol is warming, but is kind of heavy in the mouth. It's not necessarily a horrible thing, but a bit much. It really is kind of medicinal. This is my 2nd try, and better than I remembered it to be. I really don't know if I'll be buying more anytime soon, but it's worth a try none the less...especially if you like cherry flavor. I couldn't have more than one in a sitting.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,hyuga,3.5,"Served in my Trois Pistoles chalice - a very dark red, but still noticeably red brew with a thinning off-white head that, as it goes down, kind of looks like the surface of the moon if I look straight down from above into the chalice.  At first it smells a little like cough syrup and reminds me in a way of cherry-chocolate ice cream. A bit of lambicky wildness comes out with further inspection. Fruitcake and yeast spiciness are in there too. Chocolate cherry is ever-present.  Dark fruits abound on the tongue, certainly fruitcakey. A bit spicy, but harshly sweet. Cherry is big in the middle, not so much lambic character as the aroma suggested, but certainly a lot of cherry. Kind of medicinal. Bitterness in the finish, leaving syrupy cherry coating behind.  Carbonation cuts the syrupy sweetness of this beer, which is a good thing. Allows the spiciness to come out more, also good.  This is the second time I've had this beer, and I'm not sure I'm much of a fan of it. First of all, I am no fan of most cherry-flavored things, and this reminds me too much of the negative aspects of a lot of those things. I'm also not a fan of sweetened lambics. I think I'd like it better if it had a chance to mellow out some, maybe for a year or two.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Aromas of cherry, roasted elements, and some brown sugar was noted. Taste was heavy and filling, with complex flavors abound. Flavors of cherry, dark chocolate, some weak malt, and a hint of sour tartness on the finish. The higher alcohol level is well masked, but still present. Very heavy mouthfeel, like having cherry extract moshing around in your mouth. I'm not sure if I would have this again, it was like having fermented cherry juice.

Pours a murky, sludgy mahogany brown with a frothy tan head that the alcohol quickly erases. Smell has layers ans layers of complexity, as does the flavor. Standard Belgian dark fruits - plums, dates, figs, a funky/sour cherry kick along with some vinuous notes, strong malts, strong alcohol, and some faint chocolate/toffee. This is some heady stuff. Almost too complex. So many flavors and so much alcohol make this a seriously big beer. Mouthfeel is thick and bubbly. I enjoyed this quite a bit, but still had a hard time finishing the 750. Could use some refinement, a little time to mellow out perhaps. This was the 2004 vintage.

Cherry notes in the nose with molasses and large maple. Malt and alcohol. Brown sugar. Anise and cinnamon. A note: I walked out of the room for a few minutes... when I returned the room smelled slightly of the beer.  Excellent flavor. Alcohol and malt up front followed by a small rush of cherries and finished with tiny hops. A smooth beer, easy on the palate. Sugary. Syrupy. Terrific.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Dukeofearl,3.65,"Vintage 2004, aged approximately 9 months. I bought two bottles about a year ago when Ommegang products first hit the California market, a 375 ml (?) smaller bottle and a 750. I tried the 375 first, and to be honest, was not excited by the beer. But I decided that maybe some age would help this along (besides, I wasn't really in a hurry to drink the second bottle). In summary, I think the aging helped, and it is a solid, enjoyable beer, but I still am not overly excited by it.  Pours a dark, murky brown typical of Quads/Belgian Strong Dark Ales, with a slight reddish tinge. The head is espresso-crema colored that isn't all that big to start, drops, quickly, but the thin cover of minute bubbles last a long time.  Aroma is rich, heavy sweetbread malts, with lots of heavy-syrup fruit aromas, including sweet cherries. Maple syrup, pears, caramel.  Flavor is rich and complex, but not nearly as inviting as some of my favorite quads. The alcohol ending is still overly strong, but not as harsh as a year ago. For me, this is a flaw that keeps me from really enjoying the beer. High ABV needs to be hidden to have full balance in a beer.  Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, but actually on the thin side. Drinkability is still a problem for me, because of the alcohol profile.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,99bottles,3.77,"I'm somewhat torn about this beer. On one hand, I like the idea of a flavored quad, and cherry provides a good foil to the otherwise bruising power of such a malty monster. I don't really like the idea that this is essentially a quadruple and cherry flavoring black-and-tan. I'd rather see a direct product, with the fruit right in the fermenter. I also think the sweetness of the cherry lambic used (Lindemans?) detracts from the flavor. If anything, this quad needed a sour cherry. In any case, the deep brown body with ruby edges is appealing. Low carbonation. Smells of sweet figs, dates, and chocolate covered cherries. Main flavors are the same, with an unexpected viscosity (somewhat thin) and some transparent alcohol slickness. I think this could be tinkered with and improved upon. As it stands, I think it's just an average offering. Bottled versions may have more promise.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,tjthresh,4.48,"What a super beer. It pours a mahahony tone with some garnet highlights. There was a huge tan head that seemed to last forever. The aroma was quite complex. the sour kriek lambic was in the forfront, but the bunt-ish brown sugar was quite evident. They all played well together in the flavor of the beer also. In the palate, you get the soft and smooth sensaton of a Belgian ale, with the sour astrinency of the lambic. This was the 2005 vintage.

The smell is great...ripe cherries....apples....plums. After a bit of swirling the alchohol blasts through and almost singes my nosehairs!! Wow this is quite a quadrupel.  The taste is big on cherries with a hint of clove spice. The alchohol comes through strong like a fine brandy and warms the throat as it goes down.

Aroma is very malty with big fruit aroms of ripe plum and date as well as the obvious but still subtle cherries, candied sugar, anise, clove, chocolate and a very faint hop presence. This is my first quad so i wasnt really sure what to expect but i find it somewhat similar to a dubbel but with less spice character and a bigger sweetness and fruitiness as well as alcohol. The taste is very rich and malty, with big ripe fruit flavors or fig, plum, and cherry and a nice candied sugar sweetness, chocolate, clove and a lightly bitter phenolic taste as well as that signature Ommegang yeasty flavor. The mouthfeel is huge, rich and creamy and the finish is lightly sweet with a nice alcohol bite that isnt overwhelming.

Smells of fruits and malts, picking up on the cherries slightly, also plums, and a hint of apple.  The taste of wheat hits you at first then the fruit tiny bubbles provide for a belgian like carbonation. Slightly medium bodied, and finishes nice.

A nearly overwhelming variety of scents greets the nose, with a malty sweetness above all others. Has wine-like aromas at times. It is extremely smooth going down, no bitterness or bite to speak of and the alcoholic nature of this beer is masked by its complicated taste. I wasn't able to find many cherry lambic flavors in the blend, the quadrupel flavor seemed to overpower most of it, but occasionally I found a hint of oak or cherry in the background.

In the begining I sort of felt attacked by the alcohol, the warmth actually hit me right there at the begining but as you experience it you are enveloped in amazingness. The cherry flavor seemed to fade into an excellent balance with the other flavors. The mouthfeel is moderate with a light carbonation that results in a really smooth ride. This is so damn tasty and complex (yet at the same time so drinkable and smooth) that my review does not do it justice, read the others.

Awesome cap of yellowed creamyness sits about an inch high and seats itself there for quite a long time. Once its quaffed a bit, it tends to keep a very thick, firm, and whipped creamy topping. Lacing in hole-lined sheeting.  Aroma of dark floral cherrys, crisp peeled willow bark, and some caramel. Very light noting of chocolate cookie dough.  Inticing taster. A flavor ride of a treat with a big malt base of dark caramel, darker toffee, and mild molasses sliced with dark cherry liquids, dates, and figs. Malty and slightly creamified doughy center with lovely wild yeast drying effects creating a fresh bark backing and green leafy floral-like spice. Dustings of chocolate float around and mingle with delicate, alluring coatings over the dark fruityness and caramel.  Feel works quite well with the flavors, fairly full and rich with a bold and fluffy carbonation wrapped in a mild dryness and subtlety. Malt loaded creamyness ensues within and behind each sip making for one easy quaffable quad. Damn good stuff! The 9.8% doesn't seem to show up anywhere but in the last areas of the 750 once you've finished your first glass and into the second.

42,3457,andjusticeforale,3.3,"I bought a 750ml of this brew and was excited to try it based upon the addition of kriek lambic from lindenman's.  I poured this into a chalice, carefully as instructed on the bottle. It was a cloudy dark brown with a tan head of less than a centimeter after a minute of two.  The smell was typical ommegang, perhaps a bit weaker in nose than the straight ommegang. The taste was a malty darkness, followed by a middle filled with raisin/licorice sweetness, and capped off by a finish which was dry alcohol and bitter cherry.  I must say that after about half a glass I wanted to stop drinking. I was puzzled the nose on this beer was quite good if you like that Ommegang smell, and the lacing was superb, greasy clumps of bubbles sliding around the glass swirl after swirl. But the Kriek in there did not work for me. It was like trying to drink an Ommegang with a bitter aftertaste.  I did give this beer a fair shot and scored it high in some areas. Something kept me drinking to finish the whole glass.

42,3457,ommegangpbr,4.55,"Time for a revisit, seeing as how I found a 750mL bottle for $5. One of the best brews for the money I've ever had... not to mention being one of the best brews I've ever had. 2005 vintage poured into a Chimay goblet (I'm not a fan of the Chimay brews I've had but the goblet is pretty cool). Looks as a quad should and does it in style. Beautiful ruby color with a tan head that hangs around for a little ... laces the glass moderately. Smells like a well made rum cake or some such; smells like dessert. Taste wise, as far as I'm concerned, this holds its own with the other quads I've tried. Very deep and complex.. thoroughly enjoyable. Frankly, I'd like to see what this tastes like without the cherry lambic added. (Dark cherry flavor dominates the dark fruit medly in here... I get some dried figs as well, some raisins...) It is a lovely addition but I'd like to taste it raw. I have a feeling it would be delicious without the addition. Even this young this is a tasty, savory brew. Lingering flavor and marshmallow texture in the mouthfeel... smooth and velvety. Very soft... appropriately carbonated. Very, very drinkable for the style. You want to be able to drink more but the 10% alcohol makes that tricky. Then again, this isn't the sort of style where you're supposed to be able to pound bottle after bottle. A glass or two... or four.. is to be savored.

42,3457,BEERchitect,4.2,"A quite terrific American rendition to a Belgian Quad. Pours a viscous brown-ish red with golden highlights. Dainty white, fizzy head that fades quickly, but laces well. Smells sweetly with caramel, fruits, and spices. Tastes big on malt, and mildly caramelly, brown sugary, fig-ey, date-ey, and cherry-ey. Sweet spices of clove, corriander, pepper, and estery. Becomes more alcoholic through the body. Sweet and powdery finish. A good Belgian replica. A great buy for the buck.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,AlexJ,4.02,"2004 Vintage 750 ml Pours deep chestnut brown with garnet highlights. The head is initially high, fluffy, and airy, but settles quickly without a trace of lace.  Nose is rich and malty, brimming with dark cherry, plum, and berry notions followed by hints of brown sugar and dark bubbly caramel. There's a bit of earthy dry woody tones adding to the rich melange of aromas. As it warms, the fruit becomes more apparent, as does the ABV.  Very malty flavors up front, with melted brown sugar, dark chewy caramel, and pumpernickle bread dusted with cocoa powder. There's a good measure of semi-tart dark cherry along with rasberries, dried plum, molasses, and hints of chocolate. As it warms the cherry flavor really comes out, but is balanced by a lovely woody, earthy, lightly musty cellar note. The high ABV is rather noticable, it still has a slightly harsh edge to it. A diamond in the rough. I bet this would be KILLER with at least 2 years on it. It's allready complex and would really turn into a gem.  Mouthfeel is very full, with ample big bubbled carbonation and a creamy dense texture. Definately for sipping.

This is a very interesting quad -- there's plenty of fruitiness here with a late lingering esprsso flavor. I imagine that as this beer warms from the 48 degrees in the cellar that the front end taste will be quite nice.  this beer has more an early carnonation tingle than other quads I've sampled -- certainly not overdone, but there.

42,3457,Brian700,4.2,I drank this with some baked brie and Michigan dried cherries. What a pair. This beer poured a dark amber with a reddish tint. It has a light tan/brownish head.  The Aroma is of sweet malt with a slight cherryness to it. Excellent.  The taste is malty and sweet with some of the lambic coming through. The cherry presence is nice especially while eating the dried ones in the brie.  Great mouthfeel. Very warming from the alcohol. It has a full body.  I think this is drinkable to my standards but I like high amounts of alcohol in my beer.  A definate must try. I have to get some more of this soon.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I absolutely loved the color, a beautiful dark red, cherry wood color that was very crisp and clear. Outstanding. A sweet cherry aroma that was very subtle and smooth. Also noticed a slight medicinal smell, but did not think it was very overpowering or consuming. Taste was a bit rough, and would probably be better with a year of aging. Cherry taste was very noticeable and was quite interesting since it did not have the lambic-like tartness. I would purchase this one and probably let it age a year or two to smooth out some of the rough edges and let some of the malt characters come though. Overall, a very interesting and original beer that I would recommend.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,bditty187,4.47,"Brewed 2004  Dark amber-ruby in hue with some brown coloring in the mix. The color of the liquid is very attractive. It is mysterious. The head was beige in color; at the apex the foam was two-fingers in height. Head retention was fair; it steadily faded to a thin, soapy cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty and not widespread. This is a damn pleasing beer to look at.  The nose is a tropical array of luscious malts and dark fruits. I love the strong blend of dark cherries, dates, figs, raisins, and the very appetizing maltiness. There is great power in the nose, plus there is plenty of depth. There are hints of wood, clove, pepper, and a smattering of medicinal qualities and even a hint of tobacco leaf. Ive smelled this beer many times and I enjoy every sniff every time. Lovely. Inviting.  The palate is fun. It is like a really good summer blockbuster. No, this beer is not Oscar worthy but it is something youd see in the theaters two or three times and then buy the DVD. It is fun. It is enjoyable. So is this beer. The nose cued me in and the palate delivered on a strong malty blast that holds up to the firm and deep dark fruitiness. The flavors pop dark cherries, oaky, cloves, band-aids, figs, dates, apples, rum, and a kiss of candy sugar, brown sugar, and chocolate. This is a very well constructed beer. This is a real gem from Ommegang. You know maybe this beer is Oscar worthy after all, now that I really think about it. Yeah, it is that good.  Medium in body, active carbonation, the bubbles are compact and tiny but jumpy. It is plenty firm and healthy. Long aftertaste. This beer begs to be paired with complex cheeses and rich, creamy foods.  What a wonderful beer. Wonderful. It could be improved but Im not sure how, exactly. Its not lacking I drink this beer often but not often enough. This bottle has been in my cellar for a few months. My 750ml bottle was purchased in Milwaukee, MN. Now the smaller bottles are available in Omaha. Hell Yeah!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bceaglejoe,4.23,"Presentation: Poured a rich, dark amber-brown color into a tulip glass, producing a thick tan head with very good retention. A nice cascade showed off a decent amount of carbonation. This could be one of the best-looking beers out there. Strong red wine characteristics came across on the nose, with some alcohol scent. A fruity aroma was balanced by a strong malt presence.  Tasting: Very strong alcohol flavors hit the tongue and came across in the aftertaste. After the initial sip, which left a strong impression, some malt flavors started to come through. Faint cherry flavors were present, and they were rather sweet as well (hence the ""cherry lambic added"" note on the label). A silky smooth mouthfeel and a medium body are very positive aspects of this beer. It's also a very drinkable beer, although the alcohol content may discourage drinking more than one or two of it. It would go well with food or as an after-dinner beer with some cheese and crackers.  This is a good Quadrupel. I would recommend this beer (as well as other Ommegang products) to someone who would like an introduction to the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Smell is of sweet chocolate covered cherries and syrup. Taste is richly of chocolate cherries, caramel, candy sugar, and yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, tingly, with a bit of a sugary sweetness lingering towards the front of the tongue. Seems to have a rich, truffle like finish. Drinkability is a little less than good b/c it was hard for me to enjoy it while sipping. The alcohol is very evident and it made it difficult for me to want to finish the big bottle or look for any more. If you split this amongst 3 or 4 people to cap the night off, that's more like the speed of this one.  Finger licking good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Head was nice, can't really speak to lacing d/t the swirling I'm doing to get that nice aroma.  S: Malty, sweet, just a bare hint of the lambic used, gives it a very subdued funky cherry smell. Dark fruity aromas of raisins and black cherry. Alcohol smell was powerful at first sip but has since mellowed to a faint medicinal smell in the background.  T: Not sweet per se, but fruity with a little bit of the cherry flavor. Tastes of alcohol soaked fruits. Can't really taste any hops. Definitely a beer to savor as you sip.  M: Fairly strong alcohol warming, not surprising considering the stated ABV%. Nice level of carbonation, the fizziness of it helps carry the aromas and flavors. Smooth. Medium body.  D&N: Very nice beer here, wish it were packaged in a smaller bottle, this big bottle will take me a few hours to enjoy. Very complex, drinks more like a nice wine than a beer.

42,3457,neonbrown82,3.88,"Snagged this bottle from Wild Oats on my way out of Omaha, and I am once again in the comfort of my own home in Iowa City and drinking from my chalice. This is a very interesting beer. I can't quite decide if I like it or not. It's not quite as good as the beer who's chalice this one now occupies (St. Bernardus), that's for sure, but it is tasty nonetheless.  The appearance is awesome. A very dark plum color which lets absolutely no light pass through. This is topped by a huge fluffy brownish head that lasts forever, leaving a spotty lace as the glass empties.  Smells very tart, like figs, plums, etc. A bit floral, a small hint of cherry when well aerated. Even seems to have an oak aged aroma to it, which I would probably be happier without. The sweetness of the malts and candi sugars kicks the olfactory senses into high gear. Smells very alcoholic.  The taste is very well connected with the smell, only adding a bit of a spicy bitterness from a slightly hopped aftertaste. Also worth noting is the hard metallic taste from the foam licked from off my upper lip after each tip.  The mouthfeel is very thick. This is obviously a beer with a huge alcohol content, as can be judged from the sweetness and incredible body, but not necessarily from the ethanol taste (though that taste is quite noticable).  This isn't the most highly drinkable beer obviously, intended more for sipping and pondering I suppose. In this sense, I really enjoyed the brew, but there was also a side to it that I found to be too much for me. Also slightly disappointing was that I couldn't even detect a hint of the kriek blend on the label until very late in the aftertaste (well after the brew is finished). Worth a drink, but make sure you are able to be alone with your beer and your thoughts, or at least in the company of a few like minded and intelligent drunkards.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GIVEMEBACKMYSON,4.08,"I'm smelling apple tree branches, carrots, caramel, peat moss, and canned pears.  Pours a translucent cider color with good head display and retention. Looks quite good in this ""borrowed"" tulip glass i've got here.  Initially this comes off with a dry, tart vinous flavor. This quickly gives way to a more cherry pit type of bitterness. Sticky sweet with a mild notion of molasses. Molasses is quickly forgotten and replaced by a sense of some other burnt sugariness. Overall it comes to a meeting of two forces. The bitter side of various fruits (apple peels, orange pulp, cherry pits, plum pits, various others) vs. the sweet side of malts drenched in candy.  Mouthfeel is bubbly. No shit. But the attacking carbonation really wakes up my tongue. But it's groggy, unsure if it is really awake or still in the dreamworld. Thick and sticky yet light. Hmmm.  Drinkability and notes: I think I understand this beer, and by that I mean that I don't really understand it. The name, Three Philosopheres, that I get. Different ideas, different lives, clashing persona. That is definitely a theme here. This beer clashes different senses. Bitter vs. candy, abrasive CO2, complacent candy sugar malt body. But it makes it a tough beer to figure. That's fine, as I sense this was the intention. For the money, I think this is pretty enjoyable, thinker and all.  Addendum: Review was written during 1st 12-14 oz. Upon finishing the bottle, I stand by the review.

The smell is extremely nice, giving a smooth cherry flavor on top an otherwise strong and appealing combination of malts. The taste brings layers of caramel and dark malts, with cherry more blended than simply added to the rest of the flavor.

I swear the carbonation doesn't get in the way of the taste or the mouthfeel but is ever present in the appearance. Smells like plums mostly, definitely some alcohol in there too. About three quarters of the way through this and I can't decide whether it tastes more like cherries or grapes. Either way it is incredibly fruity and almost wine-like. Oh yeah... did I mention there is some alcohol in this. The mouthfeel is very good, lots of body but still light, kinda like eating fruity marshmallows.

Pours a deep ruby red, very clear and shimmering with a thick and fluffy tan head that had excellent retention. Lots of lacing throughout. Nose is very rich, intensely malty with a generous waft of cherries, very attractive! Taste follows suit to a large degree, hints of clove, tons of malt, caramel and of course, cherries. The Lindeman's does wonders for this brew adding just enough of cherry flavor to make it stand out but not take over. Slight alcohol bite, but nothing near what you'd expect by the ABV.  A very, very enjoyable brew. I'm quite impressed.  Slàinte!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TongoRad,4.54,"Color is a cloudy yet rich copper/brown with a dense, albeit not so long lasting, tan head. The head easily resurrects itself with a little swirl of the glass.  Bouquet is luxuriously malty with a good helping of cherries and caramel. Hints of a spicy nature in the background suggest coriander and perhaps sweet orange peel. Overall very inviting- nothing even remotely out of place- and possibly this beer's best feature.  Flavors are dominated by the caramel first and cherries second- essentially following through on the nose. Mouthfeel is moderately full. A sharp whack of bitterness and acidity brings it all home, minimizing any cloying tendencies the beer might have. The finish is a lingering sensation of dried cherries. Alcohol (9.8%) is barely noticible.  A tremendous effort- very well concieved and executed.

42,3457,HogHill,4.05,"Poured this 2004 edition into its proper glass. It has a murky brown body which has some dark ruby tones when held up to the light. A small tan head faded to lace around the rim of the glass.  A little bit of a chocolate and mocha aroma. Since I know it's blended with Lindeman's Kriek, I want to say cherry cordials too. But I don't if I'd pick up on that in the nose or on my palate, very subtle.  Very rich/sweet malt flavor, complex. Perhaps the sweetness stems from the lambic it is blended with, or maybe it's just the dark fruit flavor from the malts (I'm a beer drinker Jim, not a sommelier!) Rummy.  Feels a bit cloying at first, but it was quickly cut up by the carbonation. Medium to heavy body.  Drinkability: this is so rich I don't think I could handle multiple offerings over the short term, but as for long term, I will definitely confer with the Three Philosophers as they are quite affordable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The brew had a nice sized tan head that had smaller bubbles and stuck around for the entire brew leaving a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The aromas form this brew are of dark fruit, mostly cherries but can also plums and raisins I think. Also pick up a caramel like malt aromas along with a nice alcohol scent that seems to compliment the brew very well. This is a very smooth brew with a creamy like body. I can taste a lot of malt that lends it to having a sweet taste that does along with the slight cherry flavors. Also seems to have a nut like taste to it along with a slight hop that accent this brew really well. Has a alcohol flavor that gets more pronounced as the brew warms.

42,3457,woemad,4.19,"12oz. bottle purchased from Jims Homebrew in Spokane for $4.07.  Poured a dark red amber color, very hazy, and with minimal tan head that disappeared quickly.  Smell was spicy and bitter, like dark, brandied fruits, similar to what one encounters in a fruitcake, though more subtle. There was also a scent of something like black licorice, and an underlying malty sweetness. Lurking in the background are unmistakable notes of a strong alcohol presence.  The taste was quite complex. Sweet yet bitter, with the bitterness winning out in the end. There is also a substantial warming sensation from the high percentage of alcohol. Definitely a sipper. While the bitterness includes the expected cherry flavor from the kriek lambic, there is also a flavor similar to figs or raisins. All comes with a thin cloak of sweet maltiness that simply underscores the other flavors.  This is a full bodied, creamy beer that should not be taken lightly. This is a big un.  This was a fine dessert beer, which I paired with some dark chocolate. It seemed a good combination. This is most certainly NOT a session beer.

Although I really like little fruity notes that I get in the finer dark ales and quads, etc... So call me a hypocrite. But I really really liked this beer and found it to be not too overly cherryish as I thought it would be. First of all, really nice red amber color with a big poofy tan head, leaving some intricate lacing. Smell and taste are both a world of complexity. The main event really is the dark cherry flavor but there's plenty of other fruity spicy notes in there. Nutmeg, dates, figs, the list goes on and on. Really smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very warming at almost 10%. I had this beer immediately following an Allagash Four and I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would compared to Allagash, one of my favorite breweries.

Taste is rich, malty, slightly sweet up front with a slightly sour finish with some definite warming from the alcohol present. Ripe fruits and sugars are present. This is one of the best US produced Belgian style beers I've had, and I'd put it up there with other Belgian quads and strong ales out there. Pretty drinkable, even though it has a high ABV and the alcohol is definitely apparent. Also, don't be shy about cellaring this one...

The intesnity and complexity is huge, and is overboard in my opinion. Too much going on to really enjoy the flavor. The mouthfeel is decently creamy and full.  Drinkability and Overall: This beer is too out of control for me. It's not horrible, but the alcohol is really overwhelming, way too much for a 9.8% beer.

Nice medium tan head that hangs around and leaves lots of lacing.  Smells of yeasty bread, raisins and some alcohol. Nice aromas that all work very well together.  Tastes of yeast and some malt with the alcohol warming the finish. Very complex, there's a lot going on here. The cherry becomes more pronounced in the finish as it warms.  Thick but not oily mouthfeel. Drinkable as far as a ""big beer"" goes, but that alcohol can get on top of you.  Wow! This one looks, smells and tastes like what I would expect a true belgian to be.

Looks beautiful in a Trappist glass. An impenetrable cloudy brown, with a steady upward flow of carbonation. After the bubbles settle, it looks like chocolate milk with reddish edges. The strong cherry aroma hit me even as I poured, overwhelming my ability to detect much else. Strong taste of cocoa, cherries, and raisins. I agree with the reviewers who mention plumbs, too. There's a complicated dance of bitter and sweet. I expected the lambic would lighten it, but no, it's a full bodied heavy weight. Creamy, has a really nice feel.

42,3457,horndecker,4.3,"An interesting idea - a full bodied malty ale with a lambic kriek added.  The beer emerges a slightly cloudy walnut with a rich off-white head. It has a fine carbonation, but not much staying power and little or no lace. The aroma is of bittersweet cocoa, raspberries or cherries, along with a little toffee and turkish taffy wafters. There is also something vegetal which I can't pin down. A first sip yields a substantial malt flavor, perhaps you might call it malted milk: it has a great deal of cocoa swirling around. Yet the fruit is also present and everything is suspended in an ultra creamy full bodied froth. At once a bittersweet chocoalte milkshake and a strong herbal tea with wildflower honey. I'm not sure why, but I have not once thought of Kriek. There was a note of cherries and such in the nose, and the prescence of fruit after the chocolate subsides, but the lambic evidence is subtle. Which is fine by me. On the occasions that I have tried, for instance, a chocolate stout to which has been added raspberry puree or essence or whatever, I have been disappointed. Well, actually, I was horrified. This blend is quite different. They seem to have struck a nice balance between the strong malt flavors and the delicate fruit addition. Very tasty. As a quadrupel, it's not as complex as St Bernie Abt 12, Bush Ambree, or Rochefort, but, as I said, it's very tasty.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The aroma was not as strong as I thought; perhaps due to the shape of the glass. I got a deep caramel aroma with strong spice and alcohol tinge.  The taste was phenomenol, and I could definitely appreciate the mellow flavors of the yeast as the beer rounded out over time.  The beer was medium to full-bodied, but more of a full finish.  Overall, despite its strength, I found it to be an extremely drinkable brew. My hat is tipped to Ommegang in upstate for this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,willytime,2.49,"Pours a deep brown with reddish hints. Nice foam initially to get a whiff of the aroma, but it fades quickly. Lace hangs around.  What a whiff! Whoa...cherry and alcohol. Almost medicinal, but not entirely bad. Almost a candy like smell. Overall a nose full.  As for the taste, I'm not a big ""fruit"" beer fan, but I thought I would give this one a shot by the good ratings.. The cherry flavor is not overwhelming, but it lingers on the back of your toungue. The alcohol is present throughout the taste and also hangs around a long time. Because of this, I feel the drinkability is quite low.  This is my first Ommegang and I'm going to have to try some others to really know why people rave about the brewery. While I trust they make good beers, Three Philosophers is not one I will pick up again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,pentathlete,2.86,"I'm hoping that I just have a bad bottle. This pours like a classic Belgian dark, small beige head that doesn't last long. Not much lacing if any. Smell is of a harsh liqueur with the fruit subdued. Alcohol predominates. Taste follows the pattern of the smell. This brew was harsh alcohol, very little fruit, some slight cherry notes like cough syrup. Rather than the best of a Belgian dark and cherry lambic, this tastes as if I'm getting the nearly 10% abv with some cherry flavoring. It is certainly sippable, but it didn't meet my expectations. I will try this again, given its obvious reputation. Wish me luck with the next bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,LuckySevens82,4.18,"750 ml. Bottle 2004 vintage  Poured into a Rapscallion goblet. Pours a nice reddish brown with a decent head and pretty good lacing. Smell is fruity, the cherries come out in the aroma, but not quite as much as perhaps I would like them to. Malty sweetness and yeasty goodness abound. Taste is very nice. Dried figs, apricots and of course cherries are at the forefront. Just a tad biscuity. Very nice mouthfeel, not too slick, not too abrasive. Overall, a wonderful beer. A lot of folks said that there was an alcohol presence, but I had a hard time believing that this was 9.8%. When I finished, I wanted more, and there is really no higher complement I could think to pay to a beer. Another reason that I love Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,RootedFool,4.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Appearence:  Beautifully deep, opaque mahogany body. If you turned it up a few shades darker, it would be black. The head is tall, two inches deep, a creamy tan color that almost has a touch of red, or orange, when I squint my eyes. As the head deflates, a nice coat of lace still grips the glass.  Smell:  Big burst of candied fruits -- dark fruit: plums, raisins, prunes -- followed by some juicy apple notes: green apples. Some grapes come through, too -- fermented grape juice. A nice spiciness, peppery, plays in the background, along with a nice, fresh doughiness.  Taste:  Opens with a very deep and slick kick of bitter-sweetness straight across the bow of my palate -- cherries, grapefruit rinds, brown sugar -- rapidly pursued by a nice meaty wack of musty yeast and a more pronounced bitterness overhead. The aftertaste consists of a lingering, spinning spiciness on the center of the palate, and a fading fruit cake flavor -- really lovely.  I couldn't detect the alcohol at all in the taste, but I feel it warming my stomach.  Mouthfeel:  A nice heavy feel -- creamy -- backed by just the right amount of carbonation.  A very enjoyable beer and perfect for a cold night like tonight. Comforts and consoles.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,soper2000,4.72,"I really struggled with the cork on this one. The beer apparently wanted to be aged instead of consumed. Oh well, I eventually won the battle. Pours a little lighter than I would've expected. A milk chocolate brown sits underneath a 1 finger creamy head with a slightly tanned twinge. Aroma is very rich with plum and roasty malt sweetness and a subtle earthy hint. Taste is very different from other quads that I've enjoyed. The usual dark fruit/malty goodness is there, but man does that kriek jump out at the finish. That cherry bite really balances out the earthy character of the brew. There's a slight acidity that comes along with the cherry that really shocks me and makes this beer so much more refreshing than a normal quad (Very dangerous at almost 10%). I don't remember Lindemans having this kind of slightly acidic punch. A slight bit of wood is present in the aftertaste. Unique beer which i can see being polarizing. Really really really well done. Quite possibly my favorite of the Ommegang lineup. I'll be enjoying this one on many more evenings to come.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,sweetwaterman,4.2,"My father recieved a bottle of this for Christmas from one of his subordinates. Fellow BAs take note; buying your boss beer gets you mucho brownie points! Anyway, he was curious and offered to split it with me. We don't have any chalices like the bottle suggests, so we used standard Imperial Pint glasses.  It was interesting to pop a bottle of beer like you would a bottle of sparkling wine. We then each poured a pint for each other. The color is a dark reddish black color, made cloudy by some of the yeast that hadn't settled after the uncorking. Moderate initial head which then reduces to a thin, persistant lacing of the top. It had a rich feel to it, with definite hints of the fruits used, cherry being the dominate. I could definately see this going well after a meal with dessert, espically someting with chocolate. Slight malty aftertaste, but that could be due to the yeast. It did nothing to detract from the overall experience.  It would be a definate repeat, however, the cost would preclude regular buying ($8 a bottle is steep for a poor, starving college student). The good news is now I have a new addtion to my Christmas list nex year.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,PorterLambic,3.95,"This review is for the 2004 edition 750ml bottle. I have had this brew twice before, once in the big bottle(2003) and once on tap (pre-BA). Both were better. This review reflects more of an average of the three in the numbers but the words are strictly for this session. Pours a nice, cloudy orangish-red with a light tan head that starts big and drops evenly, leaving spotty lace. Smell is malty, oak, sweet, fruity, peat, and a light smoke hint. Taste is malt, oak, a general sweetness and alcohol. Not nearly as smooth as the previous quaffings. Balance is off somewhat and the complexity is down from before as well. Mouthfeel is not as smooth as before, medium/full body with light effervescence all over the mouth. Drinkability is fairly high, I will drink it again but not this 2004 edition.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,nomad,4.27,"Reviewed a bottle from the original batch, with the old burgundy label, about 2 years old...  Pours a very deep burgundy, so deep its only revealed when held to the light. No real head, no lace, and otherwise a bit quiet in a chalice.  Smells bready with good fruity esters over a vinous and sour kriek tone. Rounding out these is a smooth rum accent. Solid and unwavering, and an interesting mix of malt, yeast, lambic, and candi sugar notes.  Taste begins burnt and roasty over snap of kriek flavor, settling into a moderate malty core. Some loose rummy flavors float about and eventually fine fig and cherry notes abound, too. Its the opening that makes it interesting, as all these bits and pieces push forward and then harmonize, supported by an even further graininess similar to fruit pits. Mouthfeel is moderate and smooth, aiding drinkability some.  Out of the many bottles I've had of this beer, I much preferred it aged, at least two years. Even better is to get a hand on some of the cellar-aged bottles - I'm not sure where and if these are available, but I enjoyed some at a Ommegang party at Monk's Cafe a year ago and it was spectacular.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,quasimoto,3.19,"First off, The color of the beer was a semi dense copper. Also one of my favorite things is to see yeast sediment floating around in the bottom of he bottle. To me that is the sign of where the true flavor and craftmanship comes from. The smell of yeast ( I think it was yeast, what ever it was, it was pretty pungent. I know it wasnt hops though) hit my senses as soon as I started to take a sip. Followed by a slight ever-so taste of caramel, and then cedar. I dont really know how to describe it other than cedar. Hops are apparent in the taste, but not overwhelming. I actually enjoyed it. The after taste wasnt the best but while I'm drinking it, It's one of the closet things to a home brew.

42,3457,cerevisiaephilus,4.6,"2004 bottle  Very good looking beer. Excellent head. Large and persistant. Carbonation just keeps replenishing. Very intense bright mahogany color. Would give it a 5 except there is some chunks floating around even after a week in the fridge and a very gentle pour. Leaves a nice lacing.  Very exciting nose. Get some deep dark belgian beer notes, special B? dark candi sugar? Very nice. Definately sense the cherry too...sour, fruity cherry goodness...and maybe even a touch of the funk.  Very excellent taste. Very very big and complex. 'Like a steam locomotive, rollin' down the track...' FULL FUCKING STEAM. Very nice dark candi sugar caramel notes in the front tapering off to a very tart cherry finish leaving alcohol on your breath. Get a hint of the funk in the finish too. Finishes quite clean with a bit of tart atringency. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is quite thin for a beer of such caliber but this makes it all the more drinkable.  For a beer of this caliber and complexity, 5 in drinkability is warranted I do believe. Very smooth and easy to drink.

Lacing is minimal, and there is a considerable amount of carbonation. The smell that seemed to pierce through the others was the cherry. I must also say this about the taste of the beer.

42,3457,allengarvin,4.37,"Poured into a duvel chalice glass, served at 50F. Bottle I've been saving about a year.  Appearance: Dark reddish-brown, hazy, with slightly offshite head.  Aroma: Chocolate, candi-sugarish abbey-like aroma, highly fruity (raisins, ripe apples), with a certain iron-like scent.  Flavor: Malty sweet, almond nutty flavors, big esters (raisins, plums?). Alcohol is noticible, lending a pleasant warming as well as additional spicy flavors. Slighly oxidized. Lambic tartness comes through at the end and lingers around for a long time. Becomes noticibly port-like in the end.  Body: Huge body, very thick.  Very complex beer, with lots going on. I saved this bottle about a year, but the only difference I can taste is a better finish, not quite so sweet as a young bottle.

As expected, a strong aroma of cherries issues forth from the glass--this is nice, but the combination of cherries with some light alcohol notes reminds me a bit of cough medicine. Smooth with some pleasant sweetness and good fruity flavors (cherries, plums and others which I can't pin down). The cherry which was so overpowering in the aroma is much more subdued in making itself known in flavor. As the beer warms, a bit of alcohol taste comes forward, although not excessive to the point of detracting from the broader, nicely complex flavor. Overall this is a very nice beer--while I probably would not want much more than a glass per session it is certainly a beer I would look forward to having again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Boilermaker88,3.93,"Appearance: uniform dark brown - no ""floaties"" - topped by a bubbly vanilla-colored head that fizzled down to a small cap and modest ring. Some streaky lacing. Nose: Hearty malt aroma loaded with caramel, raisin and plum notes. Slightly sour scent skirted the edge of olfactory perception, probably a result of the cherry lambic. It seems that no effort was made to conceal the alcohol. Taste: complex, with a nice mix of malty, sugary sweetness and light tartness. Caramel really stands out initially, as does the sweetness of raisins and plums. Alcohol-soaked cherry flavor hits the back of the palate with the thinly disguised alcohol coming off as a touch raw. Feel: lighter than expected, airy and finishes drily. Overall, Three Philosophers was an interesting beer, an intriguing blend of two styles. Complex and with a nice feel, the only downside I had with it was the overriding alcohol aroma and taste.

Slightly sweet, but slightly tart. Alcohol hits mid-palate, along with some leather, and a little oak. Bitterness backs its way in, but its a very herbal, tangy, and almost medicinal bitterness. Yeast is notieceable throughout. The finish has a tart apple taste to it. Warming. Full-bodied, but with a rather fluffy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little on the ""too much"" side.

The cherry lambic that was added is blended very nice. I was expecting more of a cherry flavor and this does not over-power at all. They're married very nicely. Some caramel and oak appear midway. Alcohol is apparent in the finish.  This is definitely one to sip and savor. The taste itself was okay, but something was lacking to really set it apart. Not sure if this is better by itself or paired with food. I think the correct food match-up would bring out even more of the flavor nuances that this beer might have.

Notes of cherry, raisin, and spices detected  Taste: Intense spiciness grips the tongue while the cheeks are scrubbed by ample (almost prickly) CO². Big malt dominates the mid-taste while the finish lingers with cherries and spices  Mouthfeel: This is one huge beer with a mouthfeel to match.

42,3457,ngandhi,3.22,"Vintage 2003  Heady smells of kirsch and cherries stewed beneath a layer of dead leaves. Alcohol. Chocolate covered cherries and wheaty yeast on the palate; maybe a touch of iron. Thin raspberries; the lambic component is reminiscent of Rose de Gambrinus in that respect. Old dryer lint.  The integration of kriek and quad is strange to say the least and one does not accentuate the other. Though challenging, this beer still needs some time to calm down. The parts might ultimately each be greater than the whole.  Relax, relax. ng  P.S. I paired this with plain bittersweet chocolate wedges and it turned into ten times the beer it was on its own. The cocoa balances the quadruple part of the beer, the sugar and fat cancels out the alcohol, and the soft, luscious kriek element shines on through as well as an interesting Westy-inspired grape bubblegum finish.

When I smell this beer, it almost seems like it's gone bad...in a good way, because there is alot of sour aroma, like sour cherries and vinegar, mingling with the faint sweetness of the malt. The taste, however is a different story. This is an incredibly complex beer. There is such a great balance struck here between the kriek and the quadruple... The overwhelming taste, to me, is of chocolate-covered cherries, but without any of the cloying sweetness. But then there is a lip-smacking tanginess and relatively dry finish, which does it's best to push aside the malt monster. But then the malt comes back, and some of the cherry, and the two have a little skirmish in your mouth for a while. There is also a bit of that funky barnyard characteristic. And then the beer nears room temperature, and you ain't seen nothing yet. Oh yeah, be forewarned... there are plenty of floaty yeasties in this puppy, so watch that last pour...

A burgundy, light brown in color with a reddish tint.  This quadruple has a lot going on in terms of both aroma and flavor. Dark chocolate and toffee tones along with some fruit: cherry, black raspberry, apple, and even some orange aromas.  I've had this ale a handful of times now and I was very surprised with how chocolatey and sweet this one was. A chewy maltiness in addition to a truffle-like flavor begins the sip. This is joined by a mild tartness filled with apple, orange, and cherry flavors. Virtually no bitterness, and a dark chocolate aftertaste.  A very mellow version, that encompasses the palate and tastebuds without being obtrusive. Very impressive given the array of flavors.  At 9.8% abv, and all that is going on in terms of flavors, this quadruple is like drinking a four course meal. Not too heavy, but it would be tough to have more than a few glasses.

42,3457,blitheringidiot,3.63,"Label : Top fermented. Bottle Conditioned. Ale with Cherry Lambic added. Caged & corked 750 mL. Wrestled the cork out with my shirt to cushion the blow. Nice labeling.  Dark hazy brown yet slightly pellucid with glints of light getting thru under an impressive huge head that managed to rise a ½ in a wide mouthed Weyerbacher goblet, that settles to a wafer thin antique white head tight head.  Deep malts and candied fruit esters.  First Swigs: Heavy grainy malt with a dry finish. Some dark fruit notes of black cherries and over ripe bananas. Cherries peaked out a tiny bit in the end of the pour.A bit of dark bread doughy almost pumpernickel. As this warms, the awl-kee-hawl heat is detectable in the finish.  Steady easy soft foamy cushiony feel. This is a conundrum of a beer, as the enjoyable offering is compromised by the high ABV and uniqueness. A bit filling to be considered drinkable, but a must try for beer lovers.  Last Swigs: Grainy almost oatmeal cereal malts with a bone dry, sugary sweet finish. Missed the cherries until warmed. Slightly one dimensional light flavored Quad. Expected more. Maybe OMMEGANG is trying too hard on this one. I prefer Weyerbachers Quad to this one any day. Well see if this 2004 will improve with age. The last time I had this was at the Flying Pig in Devon and my memory was more favorable of it.

42,3457,scottum,3.51,Pours out a deep dark dark amber with an almost yellow tan head. The fruity does come through which is very nice as it mellows what I imagine would have been a much harsher brew without the blended Lindemans Kriek. This is a huge beer though. Flavors are through the roof but for me the hole it makes lets in the rain. I do think this beer will be excellent with some cellar time under its belt. I'm glad to see American brewers experimenting like this.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,oracle,3.56,"750 ml bottle in a tulip chalice.  I made a huge mistake with this beer. The label clearly says to drink slightly chilled or at room temperature. I started drinking it after it had been sitting on the counter on 5 minutes after being the in the fridge. That was far too soon. It REALLY needed to warm up some more. Once it warmed up, the appearance, smell and taste all improved dramatically (like a couple levels of magnitue). For the rest of the review, I will examine the beer as it presented itself at the correct temperature, not how it first appeared.  Beer poured a cloudy deep red/amber. with generous off white head that didn't stick around long but left moderate lacing. Rather pretty when in a chalice.  Smell was very complex. The adverstised cherry was there, but it played a minor role. I smelled mostly sweet malts and alchohol, vaguely reminiscent of an english mild.  Tasted robust and straightforward. No much in the way of sublety. Strong malt, mild cherry, oak. A little tart, but not bitter. very pleasant. Faint hints of chocolate, but very understated. Once it warmed up, I liked this beer a lot.  Mouthfeel was interesting. When cold, this beer exhibited FAR too much carbonation. As it warmed, it got much better. It lingered a shade too long.  I still haven't had too many belgian style beers, so maybe I'm just not used to them yet. Not sure I want to drink one everyday, but I'm very glad I tried it.  JUST DON'T DRINK IT COLD.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,gbontrag,4.35,"I tried this with my wife tonight. She just fell asleep in my son's bed while putting him away for the night. She said she loved it, and judging by the snores I think it loved her back.  The color of an old walnut table; not lustrous, but rich mahogany tones. A tan froth quickly dissipated to a milky way in the middle of a foam ringed glass; a faint sizzle of carbonation just swirling there like a reflection of the big bang in my chalice.  A fruit wine nose: fruit blossoms in the distance, dried fruit compote dancing on the vapors of alcohol.  Cherry chocolate truffle with brandy. Quite a lot of fizz, and oak, cabernet, roasted coconut, upside-down pineapple cake with scorched cherries... Mama and papa like this, and mama and papa could drink lots of this in front of the fire place.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,IronDjinn,4.37,"One of the highlights of what I managed to find on my trip to Vegas, I've been itching to try this stuff. Came in a large 750 ml brown bottle, caged and corked, 2004 edition. Safety comes first with Ommegang, as on the back label they recommend pointing the cork away from any friends while opening. Poured into my Leffe chalice, it's a deep murky/cloudy mahogany body, capped with a massive fluffy beige head with intense retention. Serious lacing as well. The nose is heavenly, sweet toffee malt, rum raisins and figs, dark grape and cherry, bubblegum and cotton candy. Underlying vinuous alcohol throughout on the flavour, it starts out with purple grapes and cherry skins, along with alcohol soaked dark dried fruits like raisin, dates, figs and currents, a sweeter rummy toffee towards the middle with notes of earth and wood, a dry twig-like roasted espresso finish, with light sour cherry tones. I'm practically chewing on this flavour on the aftertaste, so much to register. The mouthfeel is creamy, velvety and somewhat effervescent, not as thick and chewy as the flavour would have one expect at first. My first foray into the quadrupel style, an interesting and successful blend, I shall willingly grab more when the opportunity arises (damn suitcase space and customs duty!). Not a session beer or an everyday drinker, but I would love the opportunity to break this out for special occassions and special people on demand.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,SeanChouffe,3.96,"2003 bottling. A mahogany/red color, hazy, and effervescent with orange highlights. The head is a papyrus color with medium retention. Aroma is of dark fruits, esters, alcohol and cherries. Flavor is of caramel, toffee, with some tartness and a mild hop at the finish. The palate is medium bodied and effervescent, with a sweet start tart middle and a metallic finish.  IMHO: an interesting interpretation of a quad and I like the addition of a the lambic, but knock my socks off it did not.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Ellbert,3.24,"Appearance: Poured a very dark cherry color with a beautiful sticky head that did not want to leave.  Smell: Very malty aroma, molasses, some alcohol, and some cherries.  Taste: Very sweet. Molasses was all over the flavor. Slight fruity sweetness, but not necessarily cherries. There was a strong spiciness mostly from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel: It seemed a little over carbonated for me.  Fairly drinkable but not exactly what I am looking for.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,nixhecks,3.73,"2003 bottle. Poured a dark mahogany color with a two-finger sized, off-white head. Head had excellent retention. Aroma had a slight red wine oakiness with cherries and malts and a alcohol presence. Cherry lambic flavors are rather upfront, leaving the sweet malts to try their best to balance it all out. Alcohol was not obtrusive and overall this blend of lambic and ale made for a warming and unique drinking experience. Mouthfeel was smooth and medium to heavy bodied with medium carbonation. This would probably be best to sip after a meal.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JohnnyDuvel,4.5,"I love this beer! Distinctive, fruity taste, get's better with every sip. I noticed the cherry taste, but not much. The dark fruit notes are prevalent. Great balance, sweet (but not overly so). ABV not noticed in the taste at all. Doesn't taste ""just like"" anything. Smooth, creamy and satisfying. I will purchase this beer every time I get the chance. This was the 12oz. version, I will have to try the 750.

42,3457,Boto,4.7,"750ml bottle (2003 vintage): The beer pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. There was quite a bit of an off-white, but it subsided quickly. Big nose full of different fruits, with mainly cherries coming through. Also a yeasty breadiness to the nose. Some sweet caramel in there also. The initial taste is tart cherries, with a hint of sweetness also. There is a somewhat chocolate aftertaste that finishes a touch dry. Some spiciness comes through also. Definitely full bodied. A very good beer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,winomark,3.35,"2004 Version.  Reddish brown with a very vigorous, medium tan head. Slightly sour cherry nose with some good malty tones. Mild candy sugar notes. Tastes like chocolate-covered cherries! Quite nice. Alcohol warms the finish. Rich mouthfeel, with a long, lingering finish. Very tasty. An enjoyable brew. Quite solid throughout. Nice and drinkable.

42,3457,BrewMaster,4.2,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. The bottle comes with an intersting paper wrap around the neck showing the logos of Ommegang and Lindeman's since this is a blend of beers from the two breweries.  The beer pours a cloudy brown with a medium head that thins quickly to a thin lace of islands. The aroma is very sweet, like watered down molasses. Taste is excellent and filled with a spicy and sweet tangy flaor, roasty malt flavor, sour fruit ending and a touch of hops.  It is great in the mouth with a medium to full body.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GCBrewingCo,4.32,The beer poured deep amber brown. The head was tan and wispy and did not stick around long. The head retreated to the edges of the surface of the chalice and barely laced the glass.  The aroma was caramel and cherry with a lightly fruity aroma and a slight spice.  The flavor was spicy with cherries and dark fruits. Also present was a complexity of the caramel maltiness that is quite impressive. Alcohol is the last piece of the flavor puzzle to show up to the party.  The finish was dry and fruity with lasting alcohol impression. The body was medium and crisp due to the carbonation.  750 ml bottle. Brewed in 2003. $6.99.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

I paid $7.99 for this at a local speciality store. Overpriced at $7.99, but I have been eager to try this out. I served this beer in a goblet at room temperature with a slight chill out of the fridge as suggested on the bottle.  Appearance is very appealing to the eye. A ruby brown color with alot of mini carbonation bubbles. An incredible, fluffy head with spectacular lacings on the sides of the glass.  Smell is earthy and sweet. Smells like a powerful and interesting beer.  The major flavors of sweet malts and ripe cherries with an alcohol warmth finish. Creamy and complex. This is amazingly smooth for a 9.8% ABV quadrupel.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

The nose is malty sweet with fig coming through dominantly. There is not but a hint of the alcohol in the nose, which is good for the ABV. The first taste has a metallic taste to it, which detracts, but this flavor is not present in later sips. The beer is nicely balanced with good sweet malt that give it a subdued fig flavor. The beer is big, but not offensive. Very good. Its thick, but not syrupy. I enjoy this. I would like to try it out of the corked bottle to see if the metallic taste comes through in that offering. This is a highly drinkable beer for the ABV and style. I would drink this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,CBFanWish,4.1,"As someone who has never been overly impressed by ommegang offerings, I was blown away by this one. Poured a hazy tan colour with a moderate head. The aroma of cherries were ever present, but not overpowering. Very nice taste. of cherries balanced nicely with hops. I was surprised by this.

42,3457,Mitchster,2.43,"2003 Edition. A quadrupel Belgium style ale blended with Lindemans Kriek.  Pours out to a dark brown with beautiful cherrywood accents, forming a modest poofy light tan head with good retention and minimal lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma of rum-soaked cherries, raisins and yeast...like the nasty spontaneously fermented fruit cake my mom makes with vodka, oddly colored maraschino cherries and raisins. Suggestion of fusel alcohol, caramel...fumes of isopropyl alcohol waft through the nose and burn my eyes. Mouthfeel is spicy and brisk at first but becomes exceptionally syrupy with a medium-dense body. Taste begins with tons of clove and spice, followed by syrupy amber malts and prunes. Intensely heavy with moist cavendish tobacco in the closing, and the aftertaste is earthen and mossy. Isopropyl alcohol peppers throughout, but predominates in the finish, giving it a somewhat harsh boozy twang and alcoholic astringency. Fusels are there, but not as abundant as in Ommegang. Rotting black cherries, anise, and dark candi sugar throughout. No discrete lambique sourness, and devoid of any Kriek character. Tastes like it was fermented at 78-80 degrees fahrenheit (which is not a good thing in my book). Despite my bountiful adjectives, this beer tastes like crud.  This one can be passably sipped. It's one of Ommegangs better brews, which isn't saying anything at all. I think I taste Hemlock. To quote Aristotle...""This beer tastes like Hitler."" Ommegang...philosophize my sink, or toilet.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,marburg,4.05,"Pours out to the color of a freshly lacquered mahogany bar under dim light. Alcohol, plums, hints of cumin, canned blackberry filling, and more alcohol. And I'm catching mint brownies every now and again. Powerful nose.  Vodka soaked Fig Newtons and plum skins. What starts as smooth, alcohol-free complexity (d)evolves into a somewhat harsh alcohol presence as it warms. Tart Michigan cherries are a minor presence, but I can't shake it. Finishes a bit yeasty and much drier than anticipated. A bit astringent; I'm chewing on wood chips here every now and again. But quite good. I have this same issue with Rochefort 10, but I really wish this held up a little better as it warms, because I could easily put back the whole 750 without -- and this only shows my laziness -- returning it to the fridge during the wait.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,meathookjones,4.82,"This came in a nice looking 750ml corked bottle. This appears a nice brown color with dark red hues in the light with a nice sized beige head. While receding down to a collar of bubbles there are nice sheets of lace left clinging to the glass that stay for the duration. A very complex aroma rises out of the glass the smells of sweet fruits, caramel malt and the cherry lambic can be detected as well more so when it warms. There are also trace amounts of alcohol and spice in the nose as well. The taste starts of with the sweet caramelized malts with fruits such as apples and cherries coming through. The finish has a good earthy hop flavor, slight alcohol with a lingering cherry taste. There is so much going on in the taste I will need to pick up a few more bottles to fully appreciate this tasty brew. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a coating light fruit sweetness that is amazing. This is defiantly a sipper but I could sip this all day provided I had no plans.

Taste is malty and rich with the sweetness of the cherry cutting through it like a knife. Was not as lambicy as I expected it just seemed to add a bit of sweetness and tart flavour to cut the richness of the beer. Mouthfeel was nice with light pinpoint carbonation at first. By the end the beer had flattened a little which melded the brew even better. The alcohol is muted at first, but as it warms it begins to show through.

I found a small 12 oz bottle in a whole sale distributer in NYC, I snapped it up because I felt it the perfect oppertunity to give it a shot.  I was very pleasantly surprised. I was afraid the lambic would overpower the beer..not at all...it blended quite nicely.  It poured with a beautiful tan/maroon head which lingered through the first third of consumption. The smell was great, warm, the flavor was perfect. The lambic made the beer spring to life on my tongue, delaying the alcohol taste (9.5%) until the instant before swallowing. The finish was strong, and not at all sour as I was fearing. Really a great beer. I look forward to this one in the fall.

42,3457,putnam,4.62,"This was a first impression from a 12 oz. bottle obtained in New York. A subsequent experience with a 750ml - obtained in Michigan - seemed flatter and more obnoxiously alcoholic (say, 4.0.) (???)  Reddish brown with buttercream-colored foam. The nose is a dense, furry wall of black cherries, macerated and scorched into a paste. Almond butter, nutmeg, jerky, sticky, moist, brown and black breads and pepper assert their presence as aromas too. On the palate it burns slightly, but ultimately in service to a leathery circus of flavors including soot, toffee-stewed, overripe apricots, plums and cherries. There is a distinct, severely burned sugar component to this beer, reminiscent of authentic creme brulee or black-topped croissant crusts. Overall the bitterness works just to cover any residual sweetness and ensure a slightly gritty, dry finish - some alcohol fume heat is apparent as it closes.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Nose is laced with black cherries, caramel, a hint of musk, clean and crisp, with the start ambrosial, nice malt profile and the top middling in feel to the palate.

Impressive beige coloured head leaves lots of sticky lace behind.  Nose is an intriguing mix of caramel laden malt with dark cherry aromas. Unique & inviting, due to the interesting fruity unndertones that wrap up the nose.  Exactly as promised on the label - sweet caramel malt & cherry flavours. But its got a whole lot more. Subtle fruity notes lurk all over, along with some spicy yeast character. Everything works very well together. Slight warming of the throat is noticeble, but not annoying. Slick on the tongue.

A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, plum and spices. The flavor was of malt, raisins and spices. There are slight citrus notes, but nothing to really show the cherry lambic added. As with all other quads, like grand crus, it's hard to know if there is a set standard for the style.

Mmmm...cherries blend softly into a deep, rich, potent malt body, with notes of caramel and strong alcoholic warmth. Big and bready, a little bit spicy around the edges with a touch of tobacco in the back, beautifully complex, and extremely good for sipping. Intense, though.

42,3457,RoyalT,4.67,"Appearance  First off, I held up on the pour after the first couple of ounces came out of the bottle and the head started to roar. I was able to keep it down to two inches or so in my Chimay glass.  The body is a luscious, dirty brown with some good carbonation. [5 min later] The heads still there so Im suckin some foam and going in.  Smell  The big, bready yeast leads the way here at the nose. The dough is dark with lots of refined sugars along with some good fruits like bananas, peaches, and apricots. Theres a hint of tobacco to this one as well.  Taste  Boy, is this sweet. The darkened yeast is lighter at the taste; the sugars really take over this Quadrupel. The fruits from the nose come on very strong and the hint of tobacco (one of my favorite aspects of Belgian Ales) comes on much bigger still.  Everything is playing very well here now that the ale has warmed. The yeast base holds its own (surprisingly) and the complexity of the sugars is well-defined. This is really a terrific Belgian Ale.  Mouthfeel  This is the definition of fluffiness. The ale just dances in the cheeks. Ive found it almost impossible to find an American brewery that can duplicate this mouthfeel  well done Ommegang!  Drinkability  Im going to start referring to this brewery as OhMyGod. This offering was just incredible.  Comments  What a huge gesture from AleOha to send me not one, but two bottles of this incredible Belgian Ale. Hell be happy to know that Im spreading the wealth and will share the second bottle with some local BAs. Cheers to BeerAdvocate.com!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,HiroProtagonist,4.05,"Three Philosophers was served from a 750ml corked and caged bottle, with a neck label indicating Brewed in 2004. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a very dark brownish ruby red color, and was topped by a thick and fine light brown head. The nose was rich and enveloping, letting loose a barage of cherry-caramel-plantain maltiness with amazing underlying subtleties: tingly tartness, musty chocolate, and luscious esters. The taste presented a dark and bitter cherry-laced buttery maltiness with a warming alcoholic kick and accents of musty banana and freshly turned earth. This finished with a dark cherry skin-chocolate bitterness with lingering earthy cherry notes. The flavors of this beer reached their highest complexity and intensity near room temperature. The body was appropriately full for the flavors and character of the beer. The evident alcohol decreased the drinkability considerably, but then again this was meant as a sipper I would guess. Three Philosophers was a robust and tasty tummy warmer with very nice assortment of flavors. A succesful blend of the dark Belgian-style ale with a kriek.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,rdrummer,3.84,"Drinking Three Philosophers is a unique experience, and I'm still trying to take it all in. The bottle said that it was brewed in 2003, but that was the only date I found. It pours a bequtiful, dark brown with amber highlights. It has a large tannish head that dissipates quickly to a small head that holds for the duration. There is a great deal of lacing all around the glass.  The aroma is a little weird with a strong alcohol smell, which can be expected by the ABV, but there is also a kind of cough medicine type smell that might come from the cherry lambic that it is brewed with.  The taste is extremely complex. I needed to finish two full glasses before I could begin to sort out the tastes. There is a sweet maltiness that is the first thing I taste, followed by the fruitiness but the fruit taste is not a sweet one, but a more bitter taste. It is primarily the cherry from the lambic but there are some other flavors here. Some currant and raisin and maybe date happenings. There are also undertones of herbs and a slight hint of the hops. At the very end a well-disguised alcohol kick hits.  This is very smooth and creamy in the mouth. It also has some real bite to it, which I like. I have to say that it is good from first drop to last, but this is not a beer that I want to sit down to do a lot of drinking. It is a sipping beer that after two glasses left me satisfied.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Just a dash of alcohol comes out in the back of the nose.  Tastes nice and sweet. Apples, caramel, apricots, pears and spice make up the majority of the flavors here. A nice, dry, bitter finish, again with just the slightest note of alcohol.  Smooth and silky in the mouth, and the carbonation just tickles the tounge. Awesome feel to this one. A 750 is easily and joyfully consumed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Fluffy white head that never really goes away, just covers and slides around the top of the brew.  Smell: Beautiful complex aromas, Dried cherries, malt, spice show up first along with a whiff of alcohol. Then come notes of banana, plum, vanilla, all with an underriding earthiness.  Taste: Cherry and mocha, brown sugar, oak, yeast, caramel. nicely dry on the finish.  Mouthfeel: A little aggressive on the carbonation, but otherwise creamy and full.  Drinkability: Given the 9.8% abv, it sneaks up on you only after you've had several snifters, by then it's far too late. Just call me a happy guy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Truh,3.86,"Kumar pawned this one off on me, saying he wasnt drinking and Fruity fruit drinks!  Served from a 750 ml corked, bottle-conditioned behemoth on 3/23/2004. Poured with an initial thick, creamy head into snifter, which settled to a thin layer with a golden tinge after resting. Copper-red hue with visible carbonation present. Strong cherry up-front bouquet is noticeable from a foot away, and upon closer inspection a malt character is present, but cloaked. Not overpowering aromatics. Cherry, go figure, comes through at initial taste, followed by a slight astringency. Like the bouquet, other flavors eventually make their way through the heavy Lindemans, but not enough to point out. Alcohol not overdone. Quite drinkable, though krieks are not high on my list. Still, I wont refuse to drink them like Kumar. Im just glad Jim wasnt around when Kumar was offering it up, because he loves this kind of stuff.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,brewdlyhooked13,3.11,"Appearance - clear ruby color. Thin tan head has large watery bubbles and reduces to a covering before too long, but it's a rather attractive brew. (1/19/09 - a rather hazy ruby this time, from a well-rested bottle, so quite a range is possible)  Aroma - sweet, dark fruit (dark red cherries obviously, like Bing cherries), deeply rich smelling with an easily detectable alcohol smell. Not very intense, but foreboding, maybe.  Taste - tart cherry, a little nuttiness picked up on top of some thick maltiness. And did I mention some alcohol? Crikey, you could serve this in a shot glass. Very strong in that department. Lots of bubbles help usher in some lambic funkiness, a bit subdued and a good idea for this beer. Ends rather sour, almost acrid, like Cherry Vicks 44D, but not entirely unpleasant. Overall, an interesting but very boozy tasting beer. Some elements kick up the score but a few other elements knock it back down IMO.  Mouthfeel - very alive with bubbles, they fill the mouth with foam at times if you take a good swig. Good body and a very warm residue.  Drinkability - a decent beer but not really repeatable. A beer tasting kind of thing or an alternative way to wind down a busy day instead of wine.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Plums, figs, raisans, and subtleness of cherries, which I thought would be right up front. Taste is an awesome blend of the traditional belgian brown ale flavors. Yeasty, full flavored sweetness. Sticky, carmel, brown sugar, hints of chocolate in the back, and nice tart cherry lambic undertone. A beer lover's fantasy league in one glass. Unbelievable complexity, I swear I taste hints of chocolate in the back. Light, airy, nearly bubbly body. Creamy feel. Much less heavy than I anticipated, but very very pleasant. Supersmooth and very drinkable, paired this with roasted pork loin, sweet peas, carmelized onions with grilled mushrooms and chocolate truffle dessert. A typical Monday night at the Wayne household. :)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,BadBadger,4.18,"This was something else. Pours a very dark color with a moderate head which left some nice lacing. The taste was something else in this quadruple: at some points the cherry lambic seemed excessive, at other moments it was dead on. This would be something to open and share with a friend as an after dinner drink. It is not something I would make a habit of but it is definitely worth trying.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GuinnessSmurf,3.51,"A deep ruby pour of this quadruple - this is a fun one to examine in bright light. The color really glows. There is a small ring of head with minimal lacing.  Smell has some cherry notes, but was mostly very clean in the nose. Strange, me thinks, since part of the drink is a lambic.  The taste is surprising - in good way. The lambic flavor is very hidden, subdued under the powerful flavor of the ale. There is a rich, full mouth that seems to gently raise off the tongue.  A fun beer - but hard to find the occasion to repeat it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Three Philosophers tastes spicy, oakey, sour, with a dry finish and a hint of sour cherries through and through. Highly carbonated and light on the palate, with the bubbles bringing the flavors up to my nose. An amazing blend of flavors - extremely complex, especially as it warms. Very drinkable for the high ABV. This beer would undoubtedly age well, but is amazing fresh.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Ieatlambfries,4.52,"Served close to room temp in a chalice, poured from a 750 ml. The appearance was excellent, dark ruddy brownish red. More brown than red really, but it certainly had a reddish hue that pointed to the lambic blended in. Medium tannish head which left nice rings of lace after each sip. Also a nice healthy dose of yeast coating the bottom of the bottle. The smell was exceptional. The usual banana like Belgian yeast fragrance but accompanied by the cherry scents of the lambic. The smell reminded me almost of the cherry soaked cigars that my uncles and cousins used to make when I was a kid. Also some solvent odors that hint of the 9.8 abv. The taste was excellent as well. Sweet, banana like, and earthy hints of cherry. Very complex. I did not experience the medicinal taste that others have spoken of. In fact the warmer it got the less solvent like it became. As it warmed the cherry flavors became more apparent almost like cherry soaked cedar wood. The mouthfeel was rich and thick. Very filling. Drinkability was good, I drank the whole 750 over the course of a few hours. All and all an excellent experience and one I will try again. I'd like to cellar one of these.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Aromas are bursting with cherries soaked in yeasties. Flavor is cherries doused with bittersweet chocolate. Some licorice at the very end? Finishes with the chocolate-cherry aftertaste. Full and creamy mouthfeel. Great flavor and finish. Nothing too dominant and very well-balanced. One that, while I wouldn't drink it all the time, I would certainly not pass up.  Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Brent,3.16,"Corked magnum bottle that opened with a satifying ""pop"" and a waft of condensation. Poured a deep burgundy into the chalace with a tight, fizzy head that quickly settled. The mouthfeel, particulary on the first few sips, was rather odd - a foamy feeling that coated the tongue, much like a nitro stout does. Highly carbonated. Flavor was earthy, with a prominent bitter cherry flavor, like cherry pits. I don't think I've ever said this about a beer before, but this could have benefited from just a touch of sweetness to better develop the cherry flavor. As it was, the bitterness was rather harsh and tended to overwash what probably would have otherwise been some nice Belgian malt and yeast flavors that tried to distinguish themselves, but couldn't quite make it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Shaw,3.58,"From a 750 mL bottle of the 2003 vintage.  This ale pours a cloudy brown with a brown head. I must not have poured vigorously enough, because there was not much of a head. I'll see if more forms when I pour another glass from the bottle.  It smells malty with a little sweetness and just a bit of a musty aroma.  I can sure taste the cherry lambic. It is quite prominent. The tartness of lambics is not that noticeable, but I'm sure it's counteracting the malt sweetness. An earthy, musty flavor is also very powerful. This is quite the earthy beer. After a few sips I find that the cherry flavor vanishes. I don't detect any alcohol flavors, which is notable once you realize this beer is 9 percent ABV,  Its mouthfeel is good. It's got quite a body, considering the alcohol content.  Overall this is a good beer, especially if you like earthy flavors.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,AbePhroman,4.1,Bought a bottle for $4.50. I love Ommegang; quality Belgian styles brewed in the USA. The only quad I had ever had was Weyerbacher so I wasn't too familiar with the style. Poured a reddish-amber color and left a head that lingered till I finished the glass. Strong fruitiness abundant in the aroma. And it tastes oh so sweet. Not as strong as other quads but 9.8% nontheless. But you BAs are responsible fellows HAHA!,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,PatandDavid,2.59,"Sorry to be a sore thumb, but I didn't think this beer was that tasty at all. I used a nice glass, like the one on the bottle and filled it half with beer, dark cherry and opaque in color. The other half was full of thick tan frothy head. The head did die down rather quickly. I have this around for about an hour now, and it really hasn't improved that much. The smell is of sweet cherry cough syrup or drops (remember Ludens?). What strikes me with the taste is that the cherry syrup is on one side of the room, and the ale is on the other. I am actually shocked that the flavors are not that well blended. It's almost as if someone took one beer and poured it into another. The flavors do seem to blend more the longer it warms, but the aftertaste is bitter, and not bitter in a pleasant hoppy way (medicine theme comes to mind again). I still have one bottle of this, anyone want it?",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

It pours a glowing red with a foamy head that lingers, leaving little mounds of bubbles all over the top of the beer. The cherry smell is very subtle at the start but becomes more pronounced after sitting a while. It tastes nice but never seems to go quite where it seems it should. The cherry is just hiding in the background and never makes a full appearance. It's tantalizing in its tartness but just remains tantalizing.

This Quad poured a cloudy reddish brown with a head that settled down to a thin tan layer just like others in the style.Underneath the bready malt aroma lies subtle notes of cherries giving this a fantastic malty fruitiness that is a delight to the nose. One of the best aromas I can remember at the moment. The body is soft and full with a crisp carbonation that dances on the tongue. The flavor has everything you'd expect in the style. Fruit, malt, yeast and an asortment of spices that all add up to a complex and completely satisfying ale.

Deep malt aroma, most herbal from our ABT lineup (sage, basil). Malt profile is caramelic, but also fruity. Now I know this is made with cherry lambic and I can find the cherry aspect to it, but I'm not confident I would've without searching it. On the other hand, there's a definite peachy profile into this, together with bready yeast and maple. The body is outstanding, better than any ABT from belgium I've had, decadent creaminess and perfectly mouth-filling. Finish is chocolatey and malty. A fine-tuned desert beer, a most excellent rendition by Ommegang, who would have thought a New York State brewer could make a beer to match the monks' legendary big guns. 2 thumbs up Martin!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Lots of flavor and complexity. Almost like two beers at once (oh yeah, it is!)

Mouthfeel is very good for this style with alcohol and carbonation standing out. It's a very good beer when you are in a sipping mood or with a meal.

42,3457,SetarconeX,4.83,"I tried as best I could not to have the Plato quote on the side of the bottle influence my rating...but the quality of this beer more than makes up for it. This is a truly inspiring brew. Let's go item by item...  Appearance: Very dark, but holding the glass to the light reveals that it is, in fact, one of the deepest reds I've ever seen in a beer. It also produces a huge head, almost perfectly formed. This one looks just perfect.  Smell: Begians usually have just a tad too harsh a scent for my tastes, and this one isn't too different, however there is an undercurrent that makes this much more complicated than just another Belgian. The Cherry Lambic comes through strongly, as does a distinct maltiness, and perhaps a half-dozen other things that I just can't identify. Nice and complex.  Taste: Absolutely lives up to the smell. This is no standard Belgian, but a blend off fruit and spices so complicated that I could spend the whole night naming what I think is in it, and probably not get anywhere near the true recipie. For philosophers? Hell yes, who else could take a guess at the ingredients? Sweet, malty, cherry, acidic, some kind of yeast unlike anything I've tasted before, this one's got everything.  Mouthfeel: This is usually where I knock Belgians a few points, but this one goes down nice and smooth. There's a thickness and heaviness I'm not used to in the style, but which pleasently surprises me.  Derinkability: Perhaps the most drinkable Belgian Ale I've ever had. A tad expensive, as the entire style seems to be sometimes, but if I had an everlasting supply of this, I think I'd be a happy man.  This one needs to be tried. Get one at the earliest opportunity.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

Taste: The taste is a bit rough shows some signs of being young needs to be put away for a few years, the alcohol shines through pretty bright with chocolate covered cherries.

42,3457,marc77,4.05,"2002 release. Murky deep crimson hue, with copious animated yeast aggregates. Spritzy carbonation. Tall, fluffy tan head leaves sparse lace. After an initial snap of ethanol, the aroma settles into a balanced, subtle combination of cocoa dusted prune, underripe cherry and banana esters. Becomes more herbaceous as it breathes, with oily hints of myrrh and trace coriander surfacing. In flavor, toffeeish dark candi sugar notes upfront yields to a melange of raisin, semi sweet chocolate and buttery oak hints. Suspended yeast makes its presence known in a complementary, gentle, underbaked bread and must undertone. Ethanol character is subdued, and is discernible by a subtle black pepper and licorice presence. Once sufficient CO2 is released from solution, the mouthfeel is revealed to be firmly dextrinous and agreeably creamy. A slight nutty, brittle like note emerges late concomitantly with a soft, pleasant, dilute bourbon like alcohol presence. Finishes protracted and complex with lingering notes of buttery, cocoa tinged toffee coupled with a prune like acidity. A highly enjoyable, continously morphing brew. After all is said and done, it's reminescent of a English barleywine / Dark Strong hybrid. Surprisingly shy in outright yeast ester presence. I am quite curious as to how this compares to a ""fresh"" 2003 version. I noticed very little kriek character in flavor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

As for drinkability, could probably have a couple.  A good quad, with just the right hint of tart cherry to make it slightly sweet.

Taste is intensely complex. Obviously cherries are present and are the first thing that comes to my mind while drinking this beer. Many more vinous, dark fruits are there such as plums, grapes, figs, red apples, and maybe even pears. The malt backbone though is caramel, a sweet caramel taste and that holds everything together. Hop taste is a little on the weak side but it is very floral when it comes out. Yeast is strong and a little overbearing at times. Very dry finish. Alcohol flavor is also very noticeable and sometimes too much. Super thick in body. Maximum effervescence. This beer is definitely is sipper and finishing 750ml will take awhile.

42,3457,Gueuzedude,4.32,"Brewed 2003, Sampled February 2004 As I pop the cork I get an immediate aroma of cherries. The cork did not pop very vigorously though, so it seems that this may not be very highly carbonated. It pours though with a vigourous carbonation. It is a muddy amber-ruby color and is toppped by a light brown thick head. There are meaty, malty, cherry, and alcoholic notes in the aroma. As my nose incorporates the aroma the smell of cherries fades and one is left with a spicy Belgian ale nose.  This beer has a creamy mouthfeel to it, but it is not too thick for a Belgian quadrupel, in fact it would be on the light side for some of that designation. It is fairly sweet, and finishes with an alcoholic astringency which is not all that strong. There is definitely some cherries in this beer, but I like that it is fairly subtle and is only one component of this beer. This beer has a soft acidity to it, that is not directly traceable to the Kriek addition. There are fruit notes of raisins, plums, and fig. Though it is sweet up front it finishes with a spicy astringent dryness that is evocative of some herb/ spice that I can't quite think of.  This is a very well made beer. You can tell that a world class brewer put this beer together. Having said that it is missing something; though it is quite complex a couple of other dimensions would be wonderful here. Perhaps a bit of acidity & a bit of Brettanomyces character would be wonderful (I know this is a ridiculous request as these things are not too controllable, but De Dolle gets some of this right, at least sometimes).

This ale definately needs some sort of food to go with it.  No cheese but I did find some wheatables. Anyway, onto the tasting.  First things first, the alcohol just hit my palate hard which is very disappointing. I really am trying to like this but I just can't. Some red licorice and plum flavors but where is the black cherry from the Kriek? A nice malt backbone but damn this is hard to finish. Finish is dry, leathery and lingering but very unpleasant.

Aroma is intriguing, with a spicy background of clove and coriander, and various fruits up front. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, not much carbonation. Taste is smooth, with a caramel flavored background that reminds me of chocolate covered cherries. Although this is blended with Lindemann's Kriek, I taste a lot more fruits than cherries. Plums, apricots, raisins, and prunes, stand out more than cherries. I really can't taste the Kriek at all, but this one has an abundance of fruitiness. Not a lot of hops here, but I love the flavors.

42,3457,SheepNutz,4.11,"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep reddish brown color with three fingers of light tan head. There is a fair amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of fruit, including cherry and plum. It is a sweet smell, that has a hint of alcohol in it as well. The taste is malty and sweet, with only a hint of cherry. There is more of other fruits in there; raisins, dates, and currants. The finish is fairly sweet, a little tart. The mouthfeel is extremely thick and fairly smooth. The drinkability also fairs well for a beer of such high alcohol. A new wintertime treat for me!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,JamesBerry,4.27,"Just as good as I'd expected. Poured beautifully deep and dark, with a golden head. Within its phenolic aroma are detectable hints of cherry. Tart, roasted flavor and mellow mouthfeel. Much more alcohol flavor than the other Ommegangs, but it's to be expected for such a strong beer. I think I might well save my other bottle for a while, let it age, and then compare.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TheLongBeachBum,4.38,"Presentation: 750ml (1 Pint 9.4 fl.oz.) bottle with a gold colored wire cage & steel cap. The cork was a bit of a Belgium bugger to remove. Ripped, rather than teased out, there was a very loud thrup echoing around the room for some time whilst a little whisp of condensing grey gun smoke exhausted to atmosphere.  The swish neck label announces this as Brewed 2003. A large 270 degree obverse label is very well presented. Helpfully labeled with lots of information at various points on the white background label as a Top-Fermented, Bottle Conditioned Ale with Cherry-Lambic Added, Quadrupel. Stated strength is 9.8% ABV.  I followed the recommendation of serving this at 50-54°F, but ignored the Goblet suggestion and instead flew in the face of wisdom and used a straight sided Gueuze Tumbler.  Appearance: Clear dark brown body that looks to have a dark cherry red tinge, or is that my imagination. A light yellow tan head forms easily and rises faster than the pouring Ale in the glass. It settles down slowly and uniformly to a ½ thick covering that rises with an inverted meniscus edge at the glass wall. Finger slashes of foam like lacing cling to the glass walls. A swirl reveals lots of dissolved carbon dioxide.  Nose: Warm malts, alcohols, dark skin cherries, plums, light caramel with a hint of medicinal toffee, the nose improves the closer it gets to ambient.  Taste: A creamy feel entrances the beer. Dark bitter cherry skins are prevalent in the beginning. The malty Belgian-base beer underscores the fruit, but only breaks through in the middle. The malty Dubbel feel is dominant in the latter third and is quite spicy at times. Finishes with a mildly warming yet thick malty caramel ending. Intriguing.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy feel, tons of small bubble carbonation aids a coarse velvet blanket on the tongue. I have a feeling that this will get smoother with age as the levels of conditioning diminish.  Drinkability: I like the dark cherry caramel feel to this offering, which mixed with the smooth body and intriguing malty Belgian base all contributes to an imbibational treat. Beautiful.  Overall: The obverse label promotes Ommegang Three Philosophers as Created by blending a rich malty Belgian-style ale with Lindemans Kriek, a classic cherry-Lambic from Belgium, our Quadrupel is cultured yet wild, curious yet wise, and the preferred drink for all mental travelers.  Wow, thats quite the entrance, as the Big Head once said, why be waste time being conceited when you know that you are already better than everyone else.  I have been impressed with all of Ommegangs offerings that I have tried to date, and this is no exception. It is a very interesting experiment. But I would certainly like to drink a vintage example of this, as I feel age may well improve this further.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,beerman599,3.45,"This was an really interesting beer as i'm not a big belgian beer fan. it Started off too cold so I let it sit around for a while before tasting it to let it warm up. When cold, it's a bit thin and bitter, but when it warmed up, it became much more complex. some spicy/yeasty and a little cherry nose. Tartness from the lambic was mixed and mild and only came through as it warmed to the point where it should have been served.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,marcobrau,4.07,"Pours with a fluffy, loose head of foam. Lightly rustic, powerful cherry aroma. The first sip (served a bit too cold) tastes syrupy with a cherry cough drop flavor -- this isn't a bad thing -- although I thought I'd taste more malt. As it warms up I notice some malt flavors and the bitter finish is more pronounced. I notice the alcohol towards the finish. This beer is not as full bodied as I had expected, nor as complex. I was hoping for more complexity and perhaps that sugary, caramel charcter I've found in a St. Bernadus Abt 12, which also could be considered a quadrupel. Despite these perceived shortcomings, I did enjoy Three Philosophers, and will definitely drink it again. Another fine, and creative beer from Ommegang!

42,3457,freed,3.84,"..more regards to weefishheads and PDX Beernight version1..  After some confusion over the difference between the 750ml bottle and 12oz bottle, we tried the 750ml bottle. Popping the cork forced a fair amount of foam out the top. Once poured, the copper, almost ruby hued liquid settled with little head. It also left no fingerprint on the sides of the glass as it disappeared.  The armoa was somewhat cidery but plagued by astringent and alcoholic smells. The taste had some of these minor problems, but was otherwise quite tasty. The sediment accented the fruity and tart tastes, probably the yeast itself giving the flavor. Much like a cider, there was a very dry, tart finish.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,CharlesRiver,4.23,"I had two of these bottles in my cellar. The second one I will keep for a year or so and compare with this one. Very cool 750ml bottle, mostly white, which clearly states that it was brewed in 2003. I found the exact glass at Julios in Westborough, MA. As a side note, this is one of the nicest glasses I have ever seen.  A wonderful looking beer. Cloudy reddish-brown in color with a small tan head. The smell is typically Belgian and reminds me a lot of their Ommegang beer. Maybe a tad bit sweeter. The first thing I notice is the huge malt backbone. Cherrys, raisins, yeast and bananas are all tastes that I pick up. The taste kind of switches from malt to sweet. The 9.8% alcohol is very apparent in this young beer as it leaves a great warming feeling at the end. I think one year in the cellar will do this beer some good. Interesting fresh, but I think it may smooth out over time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Charthepirate,4.9,"My god, simply my god. On to the review...  Poured a kind of deep red, almost wine like in it's appearance, except for the big gorgeous foamy head that adorned the top of my chalice.  Smelled of dark malts and cherries.  Three philosophers is a beer to ponder. Deep, complex, round and wonderful. Starts with initially sweet dark chocolate, cofee, cloves, and orange. The coffee and chocolate quickly turn to a more roasted bitter flavor. Shortly after the sweet and swourness of the cherries comes in. Spicy sour and sweet, the cherries round out the beer as at passes down your gullet. It leaves a warming as it goes down, and the aftertaste is of french roast coffee, slightly bitter. Simply wonderful.  A beer that feels round, and full in the mouth. Carbonation is just right, keeping it from being too chewy.  So flavorful I'm not sure how much of this my taste buds could take. It hides the alchohol amazingly well though.  Just amazing beer, if you can find it pick it up.  Char",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,RocketWidget,4.5,"First of all, is this a Belgian strong dark? This is blended with a lambic! But anyways... Goddamm, now thats how a beer should look. Pours a magnificent amber red, almost like a red wine, except for the darkness, cloudiness, and exceptional foamy, thick, everlasting head. One of the strongest, thickest beer smells I've ever smelled! When opening the bottle, i smelled it right away...complex and malty, sweet and spicy, a plethora of smells. Taste is very, very good. Malt overrides all, yet I can still detect cherry flavor from the lambic, coffee flavor, sugar flavor, bitterness of the lambic, carbonated spice, and a very underlying hint of hops. What can I say that hasn't already been said? An exceptional combination brew, and one of the best I've ever had!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,WesWes,4,"The beer pours a dark burgandy color with an ample white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has the traditional dark Belgian aroma; malts, spices, yeast, etc., but there is a lingering aroma of cherries added by combining a Tripel with a lambic, producing a Quad. The taste is brilliant. It is a strong beer, but you wouldn't know it. It has a dark feel to it. It tastes like the regular Ommegang, but with a nice cherry aftertaste that really compliments the flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with low carbonation, which suits it perfect. This is a great beer. It drinks well. I wish it wasn't a seasonal brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,bewareOFpenguin,4.85,"Unbelievable, they say it couldn't be done. But it was. I tasted both the lambic and the belguim ale, and they mixed well. Two for one.

Earthy tones, cherries, other fruits, and lovely sweetness were easily detectable in the nose.  The flavor was exceptional and complex, as sweet malt and cherries were most dominant, but some spiciness and bitterness rounded out the flavor. Alcohol was slighlty noticeable. Flavors slighlty changed while the ale warmed during the session, keeping this a very interesting beer rating session.  Very smooth mouthfeel.

42,3457,jahred,4.52,"I'm sooo glad I picked up 3 bottles of this brew while back east, even though carrying them around was a huge pain.  The beer is a beautiful reddish dark brown color, with a nice very lacey head. Smells of malt and dark, sour cherries. This beer could be interesting.  Tastes mostly at first like a dark brown ale, not necessarily Belgian in style (though I don't mind). I get malt, caramel and chocolate. Quite, quite rich. And then, there it is, in the aftertaste. It is. Sour cherries. That is amazing. The cherry taste gets a bit stronger as the beer warms, but always exists only in the aftertaste.  I could drink this stuff for hours and hours. I'd be really toasted by the end of the evening, but quite happy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Foxman,4.15,"It pours a deep, clear ruby, with amber highlights at the edges. A dense, lush head, light tan, builds quickly and retains well, slowly dropping to a plush carpet of foam. Frothy, delicate lacing winds lazily along the sides and length of the glass.  The malt sweetness hits right away in the aroma, but it's just as quickly overshadowed by citrus and clove. There's some honey, and spice notes reminiscent of those in mulled wine. Apple and cherry lurk sneakily within the vapors.  Again, the solid malt flavor gives way promptly to a honey sweetness well tempered by oranges and a clove/coriander one-two. Cherry and apple notes assert themselves in the middle of the sip, delivering a sweet tanginess. The finish fades from a complexity of flavors to a yeast champagne tartness. The alcohol lurks but never truly steps forward. I even noted, in some pleasantly strange way, the flavor of mustard spice at the back corners of my mouth. I will say that with all the taste elements it takes a little effort to keep track of just what's going on.  It's medium bodied, and the heavy carbonation dances on the tongue, like little flavor-packed fireworks, bringing a bubbly glow to the overall feel.  Simply, it's as interesting as the name would suggest. Sweetness, tartness, and tanginess are all well-represented here, and to top it all off, you could even call it savory. The ABV glows more than genuinely impacts, but it's there and it does its work well and fully. I have another bottle I'd like to age, but, as is, this beer challenges the palate and then rewards the effort, making it drinkable and enjoyable. Though, of course, moderation is the watchword in this instance.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ithacabaron,4.03,"Sampled with two best friends -- some of the finest other philosophers I know.  Pours a deep burgundy in my glass with a small tan head.  Aroma is of Ommegang's particularly distinctive yeast, with light sour cherry skins and a hazelnut-glazed finish.  Taste is much of the same, with an added earthiness. The bitterness of the lambic does not really come through, but this is not a large problem with me, as since this is apparently Lindeman's Kriek blended in here, a larger porportion might carry over the added sugary sweetness that is in that libation.  As with all of Ommegang's offerings, this has a pillowy soft mouthfeel, and just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability, despite the high ABV, is not really a problem -- I think I could easily drink one of these on my own next to a warm fire.

Medium head with lacing around the beer till the very end. The smell was dominated with various fruits, but mostly consisted of raisins that I tasted while sipping this beer. The aftertaste was quite unique. First, a fruity burst of flavor then you can taste the alcohol at the very end. But the fruit taste did hide the alcohol aftertaste somewhat. A very tasty beer. I would recommend it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,DrewBeechum,3.92,Sampled from a brown 750ml bottle with a white label and funny little cardboard sign proclaiming the collaboration of Ommegang and Lindeman's.  Beer lands in the glass as a brown rusty brew with a potent haze and an almost non-existiant tan head.  The aroma is deeply musty with a leathery fruit aroma and a nuttiness from the stones and seeds of grapes and other fruits.  The flavor is reflective of the aroma with a spicy and nutty large chocolate cherry followup before a cinnamon break leads to a long warming draw of the 9.8% alcohol.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,CRJMellor,4.22,"Poured a light brown with very red highlights when I expected closely. Minimal head and lace. Taste is great, cherry flavor comes through dark malt but the tartness is cut and the cherry flavor is not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is great and carbonation is just right. As the beer warms the complexity begisn to more pronounced with some more citrus aromas and dark fruit tastes coming out. The finish is just a touch dry and spicy. Overall a very complex and beautiful beer, need to drink several to appreciate the full complexity.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Admiraldinty,4.18,"Ommegang never ceases to amaze me. Pours a dark brown with a lacy whitish-tan head. Smell is medicinal, slightly alcoholic, sweet malt. Very smooth and inviting mouthfeel. Tastes like exactly what it is: a blend between kriek lambic and Ommegang, but weighs more heavily towards Ommegang than the lambic. Herbal, with heavy sweet malts, fairly alcoholic, with some bitter cherries. This is a fantastic brew - perfect for a cold winter's night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,yankeeheel,4.5,Poured from a growler that I gleefully took from Half Time. Pours a dark ruby-brown with a small cinnamon head. That first splash from the growler to the Ommegang chalice doesn't produce much of a head. Smells strongly of dark fruit and clove with just hint of alcohol.  The taste is something to behold. A beautiful marriage of dark cherry and belgian brown ale that twists and turns over the tounge. Lots of fruity spice up front with a full bodied semi-sweet middle. The ending has a peak of medicinal flavor but it subtly ebbs in to a nice spicy/peppery finish. Drinks silky smooth for such a lively brew. Someone is doing something right at this brewery.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,beernut7,3.97,"Bottle label scheme from West Coast is quite different than the current white label scheme on the East. Pours a complicated caramel color with a thin head. Aromas strongly of sweet plum and raisins. The first taste is strongly of caramel and plum with undertones of currant and a hint of bitter chocolate.

42,3457,BeerResearcher,4.02,"This unique ale pours a ruby-tinged cordovan with a thick and foamy beige head. The aroma is heavy on the fruit, with cherries, apples and citrusy notes dominant and malt, hops and rummy alcohol working their way in. Sweet caramel malt, jarred cherries, orange zest and brandied raisins are all quite strong tasting. Peppery spices, cloves, lemon, rum and a bit of astringent camphor enter the mix. The hops are present but almost completely nondescript due to the overwhelmingly power of the Lambic, sweet malt and alcohol. A most curious taste is the lingering essence of Smith Brothers® Cherry Cough Drops. This could have been a top 10 contender had it contained a little less sweet fruity flavor and a bit more hoppy bitterness.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,beerluvr,4.44,"Poured out of the bottle and into the glass with a long-lasting head, medium tan in color that settled over lightly hazy deep ruby red liquid. The nose is heavy on fruit, cherries most dominant, mellow and inviting to the senses. The taste is semi-dry cherry, light maltiness, a great hoppiness and perfectly potent alcohol flavors, each melding wonderfully each other. Pleasantly bitter without the sometimes cloying malt sweetness sometimes associated with this style of ale. Finshes on a almondy-dry bitterness and a palate teasing dance between the sweet and the bitter, cherry notes abound throughout the taste...a wonderful, wonderful ale, buy 2 bottles if you see it, one to drink now and throw the other one in the cellar for a spell!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GeoffFromSJ,3.1,"This beer was quite complex. Chilled, it is not very good. As it warms up, it becomes much more pleasant. It tastes good at first, but it has something in the aftertaste which is quite off-putting. I cannot tell what that is. I am very curious what the underlying beer mixed with the lambic is. I love lambic, and I enjoy the one they used. I may or may not like the underlying ale. I may just not like the combination. The flavors didn't seem to complement each other.

42,3457,WaltTrombone,4.38,"It's only fitting that this beer honors thinkers of complex thoughts, as quite a lot of thought went into this, and it's very complex!  It poured a deep red-brown, with a khaki head. Aromas of sweet malt, caramel and cherry. The tastes were many, and varied! Malt, leather, cherry, grapefruit, coriander, peppery Grains of Paradise, burgundy. The mouthfeel was smooth, creamy and light. It finishes with Grains of Paradise, leather, alcohol, and over-ripe cherries. A truly great beer, and worth the wait (and hype!) Those who don't like fruit in their beer should not avoid this, as the cherry is more of an accent, not an overpowering presence. If it tastes like this now, I can only imagine how it'll age.

42,3457,FranklinPCombs,4.31,"To begin, this is the most incredible looking beer I've seen. It pours a deep ruby red with a beautiful frothy smooth head, with light draping lace. The bubbles stream up from the side of the glass, reminiscent of champagne, and the minute specks of sediment float in stasis. The smell is very fruity, with cherry, apple, and fig immediately evident. The fruity smell is underscored by the smell of alcohol which is a bit overbearing. The flavor of fruit is mirrored from the smell, but it is more mellow, beneath layers of toasted malt, hops and the everpresent alcohol. The mouthfeel is probably too smooth and pleasant for its own good, enticing the drinker to drink more, quickly, creating possible problems with overintoxication.

42,3457,Dantes,4.7,"Package: 750ml corked and caged brown bottle. Familiar-looking Ommegang burgundy label. Not dated, but per Liquid Solutions, was from the second bottling of the first batch. Unlike the current, white-labeled bottle, this is marked &#8220;Guaranteed Cellared at the Brewery.&#8221; White Label (WL) bottles are marked bottle-conditioned.  Cost: $7.05 per bottle from Liquid Solutions (ex shipping); WL bottles, $5.99 at Gary&#8217;s  Presentation: Chalice at ~50º  Appearance: Copious gunsmoke on opening, with vigorous cork &#8220;pop.&#8221; Medium pour resulted in a voluminously pillowy, off-white head, which persisted, leaving heavy lace. Opaque, oxblood body is slightly darker than WL and the bottle contains a good ¼&#8221; of lees on the bottom compared to the WL&#8217;s light dusting.  Smell: Very rich aroma. Dried plum and currant fruitiness leavened by some yeastiness and toasted, caramel malts. Kriek addition not apparent on the nose. Nose is drier than the WL&#8217;s, with more complexity and an earthier profile.  Taste: Everything the aroma promised and more! The dark malts are very apparent on the palate, and the fruitiness is broad and deep. I don&#8217;t really perceive &#8220;pear,&#8221; (or cherries for that matter) but there is a crisply sweet note that underlies the darker currant, raspberry, plum notes. All the flavors are unmolested by what one might expect to be a heavy alcohol footprint. Only a subtle warmth penetrates and carries out the long, moderately dry finish. The WL is lighter overall, with more tartness and less of the deeper, fruitier elements. Somehow, I &#8220;sense&#8221; the kriek much more in this younger version.  Mouthfeel: Classically elegant Ommegang bottle-conditioning serves this beer beautifully! The older version is super-silky with very fine, persistent carbonation. Mouthfilling, warming, and roundly fruity in the mouth. The WL again is lighter and a bit coarser, with more noticeable carbonation. The alcohol is a bit harsher.  Drinkability: Absolutely knocked my socks off. One of the ultimate fireside, cheese & crackers beers, along with Quelque Chose. Although high in ABV, this really drinks easily.  Backwash: A more fair comparison will have to come when the WL has more age, but for now I&#8217;ll have to go with the &#8220;original.&#8221; A very impressive beer that vaults to the top of my list, and a great value as well. I hope the WL improves to this level, because I'd love to have it regularly. I also tried an &#8220;old&#8221; 3P after trying a Terrible, and this blew it away. Although similar in style, 3P was much more complex (even the WL), with much better integration of alcohol. Perhaps the Terrible will improve with age, but for now, it pales in comparison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

It most strongly reminds me of port with its rich, mellowing, dark flavor. The addition of Lindemans' Kriek adds another level of complexity to an already tasty quadrupel - yielding dark cherry and green apple flavors among others. As the bottle indicates, it should be served slightly chilled.

42,3457,Jon,4.5,"2002 Bottling.  Chestnut burgundy color with a thin, creamy head, trace trails of lace and lightly evident carbonation.  Fruity, yeasty nose is dominated by aromas of apricot, currant, and other vinous characteristics.  Dark fruit flavors complement a dry, tart and minorly acidic finish. Deeply complex with notes of ripe apple, pear, raisin, fig, candy sugar and tart cherries. The finish, once again, is quite dry.  Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, extremely smooth and elegant. Creaminess and lack of alcohol detection leads to a most enjoyable beer.  Complex and deep, but nonetheless and pleasure to drink. The alcohol presence is most difficult to detect, while its fruity and vinous characteristics at this point in its life keep in all in check.

42,3457,Brewfan,4.8,"I visited the Ommegang brewery with a friend 3 years ago before we had even heard of Ommegang. Neadless to say, 3 years later, we're both still drinking the brews from Cooperstown on a regular basis. Rare Vos and Ommegang were our brews of choice, and although I still drink all Ommegang offerings, Three Philosophers definately takes presidence.  Upon pouring into an Ommegang chalace, the alcohol was instantly apparent. The color was a nice dark amber. The head and lace dissipated rather quickly, but I have found this to happen with all 3-Philosophers I've dranken, so it didn't surprise me.  The smell, apart from alcohol, which mellowed towards the end of the beer was nice and fruity with a definate black cherry aroma.  Now cherry aromas are nice and amber color is good, but what gets me about this beer is the taste. I have loved this medium body beer since the first time I've tried it. It's one of the few beers my wife, who is not a beer lover, said that she would be able to drink a whole glass of. I love the way the malt flavor mingles with chocolate and licorace overtones. It is such a beautiful, well crafted beer, I figured that it should be the first beer I rate.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,francisweizen,4.73,"2003 Vintage: Corked and Caged 750ml brown glass bottle with a vintage date printed on it. This brew is phenomenal. It pours out a dark, rustic caramel colour with some hints of burnt mollasses. The aromas are all across the board, and consist of lovely ripe kriek notes, harsh spicy alcohol notes, belgian malts, belgian yeasts, candy sugar, slight floral and almost citric hops and more!  The taste echoes the aromas, but is even more blended and wonderful than the aromas hint at. Almost 10% alcohol. A quadruple!? This stuff is a far cry from the other quads I have sampled that are up there in abv like this one is. The mouthfeel is lovely and lush in the mouth....like silk and the drinkability is excellent for a near 10%abv brew!  This is quite possibly my new favorite from Ommegang. Good job guys!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,HappyHourHero,4.15,"Sampled during the Three Philosophers release party at the Blue Tusk. Small, solid, tan head left a small amount of lacing. Dark burgundy colored liquid lets just enough light through to glow. The aroma is rich with hints of dark ripe plums and cherries along with some acohol, and a banana mellowness. Smooth malty taste with a pinch of dark frout and spices. Mouthfeel is bullay and alcoholic. The dry aftertaste leaves you with a warm stomach. Overall impression is of a young and alcoholic beer. Supposedly some will be sent to the Howe Caverns for aging in the next few months.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Stubbie1,4.35,"2003 bottle: This beer pours a deep cherry red in color. A thick, tight slightly off white (with a red tint) head sits on top my glass. Aromas are of cherry, oak, and yeast. Hints of the Lambic are present through this brew. Flavor is a rush of different things. Malt sweetness then an aged wood/oak tones, musty yeast with a tart cherry finish in the end. At no time could you notice the 9.8 that this brew has. It has a smooth creamy mouthfeel and is enjoyable to drink on a cold winter's night. Another outstanding brew from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,taez555,4.4,"2003 vintage. Had a bottle with my girlfriend at Anam Cara a couple days after the official release party, served in the official three philosophers chalice. I really like the new white label.  Pours a cloudy dark brown body with a wonderful thick off-white head.  The nose was lovely. Dark malts, phenols and some fruit touches.  The taste was really something. Im not sure what I was expecting, but it started nice and malty. Dark malts, phenols, touches of spice, but then. It just ends with this amazing dark fruit tone. Not the teeth rotting sort of lambic flavor youd expect, more of the dark cherry flavor you get with a dubbel or trapist ale, yet just a little bit more intense. Smooth bitterness throughout, and just smooth and creamy from start to finish.  Wow!!! Really a work of art. Omengang has really outdone themselves with this brew. Its a shame its not a year round beer. Whats even worse. I cant find this beer anywhere in stores. I might have to take a pilgrimage to cooperstown soon.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ManekiNeko,4.32,"A pre-wide release version bought by my cousin's boss at the brewery, sampled in a Hennepin glass. It's been sitting in his fridge for a few months.  Appearance: Cloudy reddish brown with a short lived offwhite head. Recedes to a film and a ring of bubbles. No real lacing left.  Smell: Smells a helluva lot like a nice hearty cider, and that's a good thins. Caramel malts, pepper, and coriander notes.  Taste: Robust dark malt flavors. Mildly acidic sour apple tastes. Pepper and light medicinal aftertastes.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, but very palate cleansing due to the acidity and carbonation.  Drinkability: Rather drinkable. I was reminded at times of a sour Maudite. Can't wait for the wide release version to make it's way down here.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,feloniousmonk,4.77,"Appearance: dark plum to eggplant in color, with visible ""floaties"" swimming about, a bit lighter near the bottom and around the sides, so far a very good approximation of the trappist abbey dubbel look, with a small, dunnish head, settling swiftly into a negligible collar. Aroma: sheer intoxication, the first sniff brings such myriad complex flavors that I have to reel back from it...rustic, raisins, cured meats?, dark spices and fruits, soft leather, moss...deep, dank, and transendently indulgent..oh, goodness, oh, WOW!...so much going on here, that's it's extraordinarily difficult to pretend to be detached or objective, this beer unfolds and envelops me, it knows it has me where I want to be had! ..now, how about a taste of it? Simply amazing! A sweet, treacly dose of fruit (grapes, plums, cherries) welcome hops, and a thick, powerful malt backbone, pulling it all together. Can't quite taste the ""dried apricot in the nose"" and ""pear on the palate"" as noted on the label, at least I can't claim to have discovered it on my own. I now relax, sit back, sip, savor...full-bodied as can be, long, rich, residing finish...no, ""finish"" is incorrect, for it never leaves the mouth, and I would never wish it to! A beer so powerful and seductive it consumes every sensory receptor, every inch of the head, all across the brain, down the fingers and toes...I nearly want to ""cut & paste"" my review of Westveleteren or St. Bernardus, for this experience so closely resembled that which I had with those fine Trappist ales. Another beer after this would be a tremendous let down, so that's it for tonight...(Notes taken in mid-August) Abundant gratitude to purplehops for breaking this out of his cellar for me...it was magnificent!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Jason,4.06,"750ml brown magnum, no freshness date but this beer will hold up for years to come. The yeast was very loose so about a third of the bottle was left and swirled into a separate glass.  Appearance: Outstanding lacing, clinging action all over the glass. The clouded brown colour leaves a bit of mystery.  Smell: Light medicinal, herbal, minty, and licorice in the aroma. Hint of solvent alcohol and a layered malt sweetness.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Heavenly smoothness within the full body, creamy from middle to end. Thickly sweet of dark malts, nothing roasted. Deceiving alcohol leaves little warmth until the finish. Bitter phenols and a trace hop help to balance. Very herbal and a bit earthy as well.  Notes: Drop dead in complexity, a sipping brew and certainly something you would want to pair with rather than drinking it alone. I varied my pairings from a creamy Danish Blue Cheese with water crackers to dark chocolate.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,beerguy101,4.45,"Winner of the Brew your dream beer contest. Dark brown color, smallish head, lacy with some arabesques. Figs and apricots in the nose. Very complex flavors. Malts, spices, figs, earthy and fruity. Well balanced. Very smooth taste, a slightly alcohol bite at 9.8%. Great mix of complex subtle flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and smooth.

42,3457,daledeee,4.03,"Pours a beautiful dark brown with 1"" head. Settles to a nice lace. Lots of roasted mast and lots of roasted malt. There are dark cherry and fig tones. Rather astringent on the palate. Chocolate shows up later toward the end. I drink this rather warm (50F) The alcohol is in the nose fairly well hidden while drinking but the throat is nice and warm.  If I close my eyes and not read the label, I would swear this is a very fine Belgian. I let the second one age several months and it was more along the fruit profile. Still tasty.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Jarod,4.89,"Learned that this batch was over 1 ½ years old. She aged beautifully. Connoisseur tasting, Kennett Square  This beer poured a dark ruby/mahogany color that was cloudy in appearance. The head that was produced was minimal and short lived, just a thin covering that was tan/beige colored. No lace. The aromas were intense and bold! Smells of bourbon, port wine, wooden aging barrels, big dark fruits (raisins, plums, black cherries), sweet dark caramel malts, and alcohol. After I took my first of many whiffs I hoped that the flavors would and had to be as good as the nose. And they absolutely were. Tastes of rich dark sweet malts, dark fruits, fruits macerated in alcohol, port wine and the barrels that they were aged in, caramel, spice (hints), alcohol and a wisp of granny smith apple tartness at the end. Aftertaste was filled with port wine and fruit. Heavy bodied, and thick. Big complex flavors that are rich and heavenly and the warmth from the alcohol were truly inviting. Wow what a beer truly amazing how all the flavors compliment each other so well. Glad I had the chance to experience it, several times in one day.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,canucklehead,4.05,"I tasted this beer with other Belgian style beers such as Hair of the Dog Rose and Raison D'etre and I must say that this was my favourite. The nose was full of fruit and spices and the colour was a deep auburn . What impressed me the most was the complexity of flavours yet smoothness of drinkability. Yes, the alcohol was there but it did interfere with the experience. These guys are playing on the same level as Unibroue 11 which is available in B.C. This beer came from a buying trip to Portland.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,TheDM,2.98,This brew pours a small head of light brown moslty lasting bubbles and a brown colored body. It had a strong bubblegum and alcohol aroma with an overpowering alcohol flavor.

42,3457,purplehops,4.77,"Three Philosophers poured a deep rosewood color with plum highlights. The head was light tan frothy and quick to disperse with little or no lacing. Aroma was fruity and malty with smells of fig, plum, raison, cherries, mace, caramel, and some pear and alcohol in the background. The taste starts with flavors of caramel and toffee mixed with black berries and plums. This is quickly followed by a rush of soft alcohol flavors and black cherries with hints of fig and allspice and pear. The finish keeps the complexity moving with notes of green tart apple blending with a dry maltiness and some earthy and citrus flavors. Aftertaste is a smooth warmth of dried fruits and spices and alcohol. As it warms it becomes more and more port like in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich with a medium full body and a very faint effervescence. Overall an interesting and complex offering from Ommegang. Would one expect less? This is a special occasion beer that should cellar nicely and bring joy and warmth for years to come. The best part is that it is to become a regular part of the brewery line up instead of a specialty product. Thank you Mr. Duvel.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Bighuge,4.47,"Deep russet brown color. Just a thin film of a head, but a nice collar. Light brown in color. Lacing is spotty. Nose is thick. Chewy molasses, rum, raisin, dates, figs, black cherries and alcohol. Very nice. Form the first sip, I can tell this is the kind of Belgian style beer that I really like. Subtle bready, yeasty tones kick it off. Rum soaked raisins come and go. Alcohol is a presence, but it fits in a good way with this beer. Prunes, plums, wood, cherry, dates, figs......damn this is a tasty concoction. Carbonation is low, but fitting. Body is about medium full. Great beer.

42,3457,BeerAngel,4.12,"Pours a lightly hazed dark brown tea color with a modest light tan head that disappears rapidly. The sweet smell of mixed fruit but predominantly raisons and light alcohol notes make up the aroma of this brew. A repeat in the taste of what made up the aroma along with a chocolate covered raison being the dominant flavor along with a light bitter and again alcohol notes. This light bodied brew is just a tad under hopped IMO, but it does go down surprisingly easy. Another solid beer from this brewery. Thanks once again for the chance to experience this McCall! Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,cokes,3.85,"A blurred, glassy burgundy below a short-lived khaki bonnet. Fumes of bourbon drenched cherries, bananas, permanent markers, maple and moss. Burnt prunes yield to smoked kiwis, which succumb to charred figs, fended off by blackened raisins. Covered in toffee sweetness, sugarcane and esters of banana. Cotton candy airiness towards the center; Rum-soaked pound cake later on. Towards the finish, a chlorophyll sensation materializes. Green ponds in August, with tire swings and lilypads. Ends lightly chocolaty, rum-sweet and algae-like. Medium-thin body with sparse carbonation, yet enough to keep this from being overly sweet or cloying. Easily, and thoughtfully consumed.  Now the only question is: Which three philosophers? Ill go with: 1.) Jung for the manifestation of the Belgian Dark Strong Ale archetype in the collective unconscious. 2.) J.S. Mill for Utilitarian darkened fruits. 3.) Thoreau for the essence of a pond",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,GreatPondBrewer,4,"After having visited the brewery and actually reading the essay that was the inspiration for this beer I was ready to get the taste poetry in motion as it were. The philosopher poured a deep, foggy mahogony with a tan/yellow head which dissapeared quicker than most Belgians I have tried. The lace was real clingy and looked good on the cup. Several strong sweet aromas came out almost immediatly. There were cherry, raisen and maple which abounded in the nose. The taste was distinct with some notes of bannana mixed with honey, figs, pears and cloves. They tour guide at the brewery said Ommegang uses none of the spices that it adds to its other beers. I sm still a tad sceptical, but if it is true then this is truly a triumph of a beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,frank4sail,4.2,Sweet floral yeasty nose. Cherry color to the brew with a nice white lace that becomes your following friend. Sweet strong sour plum taste with banana chips and a citrus bite in the finish. Fuller mouth. A very complex beer with lots of stuff going on in there. The plum and banana chip taste really swirls in there. It's bold sweetness and tastes make this a sippin' brew that should improve with maturity.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Suds,4.19,"I bought this a year ago. It's been aging in the cellar, and I thought it was time to give the beer a try. Very dark brown color with moderate carbonation. The head is a tan color, but is very short-lived. I love the aroma: very strong fruit overtones....raisins, plums, apple. Intensely fruity and sweet smell, with a lot of alcohol as well. Taste is very malty with a jagged graininess. Peppery and fruity. Alcohol warming is predominant. Medium body, and very drinkable. I admit that I had higher hopes, but this is still a very nice beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,Marty,4.32,"Poured a dark amber and mostly cloudy. Head dissipated fairly quickly; this beer has very little carbonation by design. Smelled and tasted of all the fruits mentioned on the label, particularly raisins and apricots. The sweetness is much more prominent than the alcohol, which you can definitely feel coursing through your veins after a full glass. This is a very good strong beer thats surprisingly drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,NeroFiddled,4.27,"750ml bottle, corked and caged. A carefull pour renders a clear, reddish-brown body with crimson and orange highlights. An off-white, creamy but short-lived head leaves only very minor lace (possibly due to the high level of alcohol, or maybe the need for some more conditioning). The nose displays dark fruit (raisins, fig) and some alcohol. The medium body is lightened by a moderate, but still gently effervescent (very fine bubbled), carbonation. True to the description on the label, the flavor is rich with raisins and pears; as well as some apricot and slightly tart apple. It's mildly sweet maltiness also lends a nutty quality (hazelnut?) that becomes more obvious in the finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but far from intrusive. It finishes dry with some residual sweet fruity malt. Quite enjoyable. Worth trying.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,ElGuapo,3.9,"A sweet aroma of fruits and dark malts jump out of this deep reddish brown brew with a lacing of off-white foam.  Dark malts provide most of the flavor which is blended well with fruits and a very welcomed roasty taste. Alcohol comes in there at the end, but it is not overdone. This was a very unique brew. I can't say that I loved it or really liked it, but I did enjoy it.  A quote from a friend of mine: ""Otto the beer afficianato (sp) who savors the taste of natty ice says that this beer is f---ing disgusting""  This one may be a little much for someone used to less complex brews. It has a lot of flavor, a lot of body, and it is pretty loud and in your face.  The '03 is much niceer than I remember last year's being. It has a nice backround of cherries that really add complexity and take away from the alcohol flavoring.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92
42,3457,longpondbeerman,3.8,"I waited for the right moment to share this 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. bottle of Ommegang ""Three Philosophers"" with my wife and son on another cold night this winter. We drank the ale at slightly under room temperature (maybe 60 degrees). The ale poured in an initially deep, almost blood, red, but the later pours were significantly cloudier due to much evident sediment. The foam was a light caramel color, which sustained a good body for much of the drink. This ale clearly signifies its high alcohol content (9.8%) on first smell--almost like wine. Anyhow, there is also a sweet aroma, but that sweetness is not at all evident by taste--the alcohol definitely overpowers most everything else--not something I am fond of, frankly. If you want to warm up quickly, this is the brew, but the taste is not quite up with the best of them.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Quadrupel (Quad),92

42,3457,Bierman9,4.03,"Update, from a 750ml bottle enjoyed today, 23NOV07, my Dad's 79th Birthday and the day after Thanksgiving. Here's to you, Dad!  Poured into my Rapscallion goblet, it has a deep, dark mahogany color, with tinges of ruby. It's a clear bier, with a frothy, light-russet hued head of about 1/4"". The topping lasts well, leaving healthy lacing behind. The nose suggests dryness and ""warmth"" (as in high abv). Subtle hints of fruit as well as brown sugar also are present. Body is medium, but there's an abundance of carbonation which makes the bier very light and bubbly on the tongue, with some soft prickliness. Taste has some hints of dark fruit and a flavor akin to some brown sugar which has been seared to the bottom of a pan. 3-Ps is definitely dry, with the kriek aspect lurking around but never becoming pronounced. Some candy-sugar characteristics appear, and the 9.80% abv is very well-hidden. Though a tasty concoction, and well-drinkable, it is not overly complex, and not quite as good as I originally thought 5 years ago. Prosit!!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  *** ***  Original review, from 12MAY02. An interesting concoction.... Dark brown color, with some garnet hues to boot. Had a small, fine head, and left loads of lace. Lots of dark fruit aromas in the nose. Real good body, and even better smoothness over the tongue. Some sweetness in the flavor, loads of dark-fruitiness, and a dry, puckery finish. A pleasure to drink!

Unfortunately for some (at least at this time), 3P will only be available at the brewery, ordering from the brewery and shipped only to NY residents and to residents of Oregon, the contest winners home state.  This brew is outstanding. Deep chesnut color with a healthy head initially, then giving way to a creamy tan layer of foam. Rich aroma of prunes, dark ripe plums and alcohol soaked raisins. More of same in flavor, along with some woody notes. The alcohol at nearly 10%, is well masked by the richness and complexity of the beer.
