35,104,gvickery,1.42,"Looks medium copper, nice white head. Smells like a west coast IPA, this is supposed to be a Vienna Lager? Taste of very sweet malt and pure Chico hops, probably a lot of Cascade. Wow, what a disappointment, I’ve had this before and it was completely different. This is a joke. I’ll never buy a Samuel Adams product again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Riverdivine8,1.56,"Like many other good things- yet another example of how corporate greed, in search of more $, will cave, and mutate what is perfect, in search of what they think is most profitable to their bottom line.  After 30 yrs of drinking Sam Adams Boston Lager (a genuine loyal customer)- I would have given it a perfect 'score' on every level.... I have tried the ""ReMastered"" version on 3 separate occasions.. (trying to give an unbiased and fair assessment)...and,. the new ""Remastered"" version, literally, has made me physically ill the next day, every time I drink it. :( I have no idea what ingredient that they added to this.  On a practical level- it tastes different upon sipping....and, leaves an unpleasant metallic aftertaste.  The original was perfectly balanced and delicious- a classic for decades- and, THE recipe that CREATED the company's/ Jim Koch's success.... And yet- one day, they decided to alter perfection. Very sad.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,AlfromPA,3.57,"This is a review of the ""remastered"" version. Good until June 2023. A big, full bodied lager, as always, but hops are less floral and more astringent. These hops dominate the flavor. The astringency lingers as an aftertaste as well. Would probably be a lot more refreshing and invigorating in warmer weather--in winter, one longs for the more fragrant and gentler hops of yore.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,alphatzulu,3.77,"This is a great common big batch beer. It hits all the hoppy, floral notes, and has a great light feel on the tongue. It is a great tasting beer that you can get pretty much anywhere and satisfies your craving year round.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bristol2120,3.37,"The tasting notes for this beer are almost irrelevant at this point. Suffice it to say, this is a rock solid beer that works for nearly every occasion. What is most important is how this beer changed everything. Do you understand that we used to think Heineken was a good beer? Do you understand that we used to be perfectly happy with Budweiser? Anyone who says a bad thing about Boston lager deserves a knee to the groin, especially if they do it while drinking some hazy, milk shake, east/west/midwest coast, vertical, mosaic hopped abomination of the day. Hey, thanks to Sam Adams, I can get a six pack of actual decent beer at the 7-11 for just a little bit more than Miller Lite.

35,104,joeagain,3.94,"Having made multiple trips to Boston from Jersey, I had this beer when it had just started hitting the market. It was magnificent back then. It's still very good, but the character has dimmed a bit. Pours a nice light amber, good frothy lasting head. Nice malt, burnt sugar nose. Hops are there, but weaker than it once was. Taste a bit sweet, not cloying but getting there. Hop bitterness and grass-hoppy flavor come through. Unlike in the early years, I find this beer a bit too filling, perhaps from the sweetness of the malt. Still a damn good beer, just not as good as in the early years.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,papposilenus,4.04,"From a 12oz bottle, best by Mar 2023. From the Beers for Cheers variety pack, purchased at Price Chopper 11/22/22. Served in a willi becher pub glass.  Pours a bright, crystalline copper, the colour of a shiny new penny, with a scant finger of cream-colored suds. The head lasts for a minute or so leaving a wispy cap and collar and a rousable sheet of thin, slippery lacing.  Nose is lightly malty and mildly sweet. Aromas of apple and bread.  Taste is round and full, bready and a little reminiscent of apple juice - the really good kind. A pleasant noble hops grassy, peppery bite, and then done.  Feel is smooth, full and satisfying, mouthcoating, with fine, zippy carbonation.  Overall, well, sweet merciful fuckall, I’d forgotten how good this was, if I ever even knew. I mean, I order this on draft at restaurants all the time and never give it a second thought but I don’t know when the last time was I actually had a bottle of it at home and paid attention to what I was drinking. I guess in my head I kind of lump this in with all the mass-market macros and AAL’s on the supermarket shelves but that’s not right. It’s its own thing; a worthy beverage. It’s also the best bottle in the holiday variety pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Giantspace,3.44,"Always a beer that I would have at an airport bar or eatery. On tap this is a nice beer. Bottles it’s passable and not a beer I buy often. I saw this 12 pack for $15 and said why not. Enjoying it and it looks nice in a glass. Taste wise it’s ok, this beer has been passed by many other beers and will not be a purchase for me in the future unless it’s the only option. Honestly I will save some $ and get the High Life or other AAL before this even at the airport. By no means bad but not memorable or worth the extra $, Hamms 30 pack is less than this was and I enjoy that more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,1009,3.85,"A revolutionary beer in the craft industry and appropriately named after an American Revolution figure. This beer changed the way the beer industry crafted this fine malty beverage and in the American spirit, pushed others to strive for greatness. We are now blessed with many fantastic breweries who followed in the footsteps of this wonderfully balanced and flavored malty lager. A beer that will always satisfy and has not aged a bit since it’s introduction in 1984.

35,104,AlexandraDen,3.68,"Brief review from when I had this at a restaurant  Big frothy head that quickly dissipates, it has a very lovely, crystal clear amber colour.  Noble hops present in the body of the beer, pleasant bitterness backed by a predominantly caramel malt backbone. Very crisp, light-medium bodied. Loved the bitter ring on the finish, with the malty vanilla grain notes gently riding out as well.  One of the best macro offerings for sure. Had a lot of craft that was even as good as this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CobraChicken,3.96,"Beautiful medium amber color with thin off-white head. The smell is average, with a hint of malt. The first sip is malty and bready, that turns into toffee. I am a big fan of carbonation and wouldn’t mind a little more in this brew- but it is an adequate amount which allows you to experience the transition of flavors. I typically don’t notice this much flavor movement in macro beers, but this one is prevalent and welcomed. The finish is semi-dry with nearly no bitterness. It is like drinking a full bodied beer without the full bodied fullness. I had one once before, but I was already pretty drunk and didn’t appreciate it for what it is. It’s no Coors Banquet, but it definitely is worth revisiting if you haven’t become a total beer snob! (Haha) …and who doesn’t love their commercials?! I give this a solid 4 in my humble opinion and I would not turn this down if offered. When it comes to complexity of taste- this is truly the King of the macros.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Perioddicals,3.69,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. One and a quarter finger off-white head on an aggressive pour that fades down to a bubble film that stays throughout the drink. Medium amber brown color. Clear with no haziness. Medium lacing on the glass.  S - Malts up front with a bread or cracker scent. Some mild toastiness. Some mild earthy tones as well.  T - Caramel Malts are front and center. Light toastiness on the back end. Some sweetness in there. Minimal hop flavors with almost no bitterness.  F - Medium mouthfeel with some frothiness. Medium carbonation.  O - Overall, this is a solid malt-forward beer. Sam Adams Boston Lager has been a standard beer for me for many years. It’s one of the better all-around beers for someone who is not a hop-head. Great smooth malt flavors. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to all.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GABronco,3.77,"Look - color is somewhat copper and pretty clear. Head was about 1 finger size and dissipated quickly.  Smell - A little malty with hints of toffee and vanilla.  Taste - The taste surprised me because the hops are more present than I expected based on the smell. It was a nice surprise and gave good depth to the beer.  Feel - Good, standard lager with moderate carbonation.  Overall--a good, but not fancy beer. It seems like a pretty safe choice and should appeal to a lot of people, but doesn't have the complexity of so many of the craft beers out there. Still, probably my favorite macro lager that is available most places.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nothing special but still very good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,deleted_user_995920,3.46,"Pours a translucent copper/burnt orange color, with a fast receding foamy whit head. Smell mild hints of toffee and vanilla. Taste is bready,malty and nicely hopped. This is a tasty beer.Feels almost thin bodied,finishes semi dry. Overall this in my opinion is a different brew than 35 years ago when they were trying to make a name for themselves. This was my go to beer and if I moved to another State that did not stock it , I would tell the owners how fantastic this beer was. ( I may as well have worked for them) it was the best beer, (also Anchor Steam) at the time in the US market- This seems like a cheapened version on every level of ingredients. It was a beer I would have rated a 4.5. This on the other hand shows what mass production can do to quality of ingredients. Last time I drank this ,SAM Adams was trying to impress, now they are a small conglomerate who makes mediocre beer. Sad that success destroys the product-",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Big fluffy head that lasts throughout the beer. Well balanced malt and hop flavors. I swear this beer used to be under 5%. Either way it's miles ahead of the majority of craft attempts.  Edit 2/9/23: Label says its remastered and brighter. Label says ""New remastered boston lager"" not the first time i've seen that on the label. does look brighter, still pours decent head.. im afraid that they've stopped caring about the malt profile of the beer by the first look of it in the glass and the smell. its as fresh as i can get it, out of the enclosed case. Easier drinking seems to imply their previous interpretation was just not good. Well, i just don't know really. Seems to still be fine.

35,104,TheMatts,3.38,"This is a beer that I could drink over an hour or 45mins. It has a nice color to it, and a crisp flavor that hits your tongue right away. Had a dry feel to it with some bitterness at the sides of your mouth. You can definitely taste the hops, leaving it more honestly bitter than I expected and some spice notes with that. The IBU rating will deceive you. It taste like an inoffensive beer with a strong hop flavor. Was excited to try this and it disappointed. Not bad.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JZH1000,3.66,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (beers for cheers) The look is a nice solid to light amber with average carbonation. Head on the pour isnt spectacular, but what does form sticks around for a while. Crystal clear  Hops are very present on the nose, but almost all bittering hops. Very classic hop scent blending very well into the malt backbone. Very pleasant scent. Herbal earthy and malty.  Taste almost resembles a pale ale. Hops largely overpower any lager characteristic, much unlike their winter lager. Still easy to put down and inoffensive but much more bitter than most lagers I've had despite the claim of 30 IBU on the bottle. Wish the malt was stronger on the taste. It does come through in the after taste though.  Feel is like most lagers easy to put down not too heavy and pretty refreshing the strong hops detract from refreshing as much but that's not a huge deal it came in a winter pack.  Overall a pretty good hoppy lager. Choppier than a traditional pils, but nothing crazy. Flavors are all ones you've had before, but maybe not in a lager. Pretty good definitely better than most macros flavor wise but maybe not refreshing wise.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,MaltsOfGlory,4.3,"12oz bottle  Pours two fingers of extremely pillowy, creamy white head. Retention is immaculate, not losing even a sliver after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks nice. Body is bronze in color, crystal clear, with an absurd amount of nucleating bubbles coming up. Looks wonderful so far.  Nose is bready, some caramel, toffee. Faint grassy hops, even a little spicy. Malt forward, but it doesn’t smell cloying or overly sweet. The aroma is fuller than what a lot of Vienna’s often have, so you could argue it’s stylistically closer to a Marzen. Just slightly complex, smells wonderful.  On the flavor, the malts seem to hit harder and the hops take more of a back seat, especially compared to drinking from the bottle. Definitely bready, caramel, toffee. Hops are pretty subdued, there is a very small spice that I feel shows up more out of the bottle. Definitely leans more towards a Marzen, at least from my experience with the two styles. You could say it’s just slightly unbalanced, but overall a lovely flavor.  Sweetness is moderate, but it works. Bitterness is low but present. For the amount of nucleation, the carbonation has held up very well, sitting around medium-high. Body is about medium, the malty sweetness does some work there. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, a tad sweet (at least in the glass, drinks much crisper out of the bottle).  All things considered, the drinkability is wonderful, this is tasty, not cloying, and light enough.  Appearance turned out great. The head was super resilient, and the lacing very cohesive.  Overall a wonderful beer, one that is underrated, or maybe just forgotten. Full of flavor, and just all around good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Being a Philly Native and before Tom Brady era and before well the whole Boston losing to Flyers in game 7 in 2010, and before the 2003 incident, there was a humble brewery in Boston that wanted to shake the world up by making a beer and telling people, ""this is the beer you want when you grow up a little"" implying that older 27 to 49 year olds were drinking this like a SIR! This beer f!cking blows ass! They use so much hops it ruins the beer. They even showed you on TV how much hops they used and made fun of other breweries for making their beers with little hops.

35,104,JohnniEMc,4.29,"In lieu of certain recent news, it was time to support the stalwart and review it. A brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It's a beautiful bright, shiny and somewhat translucent copper-amber. The head was white and just about perfect for the force of the pour. Much of it endures. This time, a refrigerated beer is being reviewed by me. There's a very pleasant malt-hop combination to smell and it likely would be enhanced were the serving closer to room temperature. The taste is malty without being overly sweet and balanced by some earthy hoppiness. The glass lacing completes a very pretty visual. This drinks so much smoother than any adjunct lager it sometimes gets blamed to be among. Taste is a subjective thing, but it astounds that there are advocates that truly believe Budweiser and the others make a superior lager. Perhaps because with a full malt body and an obvious hop finish, this drinks closer to an ale than a lager. There are good ales lighter in body and taste than this. So, if the heaviness here isn't a lager lover's tea party, it's understandable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smell: Pleasant, with a nice balance of sweet malts and hops bitterness in the aroma. These aromas balance the malt and hops for a nice aroma.  Taste: A nice mix of hops, malts, and herbs in the flavor, that make for an interesting and complex lager, but with a little bit of sweetness. There is a little pepper edge to the flavor.

35,104,BuckyNBeer,3.76,Boston Lager pours a light copper hue with a nice white head and a good amount of carbonation. The aroma doesn't have a whole lot going on though. It reminds me faintly of bread with a bit of sweetness. The flavor is better however. The bread really starts to come out while being a bit sweet and having hints of caramel. The finish has a decent amount of bitterness but it isn't terribly dry. Overall this is a pretty good beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Aeryxium,4.6,"Appearance: Straight from the fridge and into a clear mug, the first thing I noticed is relatively small bubbles in the healthy head. Fairly strong carbonation generates a good amount of fine bubbles in the pale amber liquid. It looks crisp and clear with decent head retention. Overall strong score right off the bat.  Aroma: Malt and caramel dominate on the nose, with an undertone of honey and citrus. Very appealing, can’t wait to dive in.  Taste: Malt and honey hit me first, then the caramel flavours start to move in and the citrus really comes through in the finish. A slight bitter aftertaste in a very pleasing way with the citrus and honey flavours lingering. Fairly well balanced and slightly sweet, but as the IBU indicates, on the strong side for a lager, which I really enjoy and find crisp and refreshing. Excellent and not overpowering; a new favourite.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and a moderately lingering aftertaste. This is the one category where I find this beer to be fairly average; I prefer a but more carbonation and a bit more on the back end.  Overall: This is one of my new favourite beers. I’ll certainly be adding it to my regular rotation and keeping some in the fridge going forward. I like the simple, crisp feeling and the balanced honey and caramel flavours, and it’s got an great amount of bitterness for any occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,TedHead,4.05,Pours a translucent deep caramel color with a white head that goes away after about a minute. It has sweet biscuity and caramel malt smells up front with hints of toffee and slightly spicy floral hops on the finish. The taste has a slightly sweet and semi toffee like biscuits taste that blends smoothly into a slightly dry and bitter and hoppy taste. It goes down incredibly smoothly and I could drink this pretty much all day.

35,104,mikeinportc,3.67,"""Remastered"" version. ""Enjoy before"" date of March 2021.  Lightly hazy orange-amber, with moderate pale tan head.  Smells of light caramel , with faint mixed citrus and spiciness.  Some light floral/fruitiness(halfway? between Pils & helles) , with some of the caramelly malt flavors show through, though less than ""regular"" SABL, finishing with some noble hop spiciness and touch of the malt . A light drying bitterness lingers awhile after finish. In the grapefruit pith vein, but less noticeably so , than when it is warm.  Feel is light-medium, with slight syrupy slickness, and moderate very fine carbonation bite.  Overall, I'm still on the fence as to which version of SABL I like better, but I do like this. It's just different : a bit hoppier, and less noticeable caramel maltiness. The last few ""regular"" SABLs I had were draft, with dinner, at restaurants (Remember THAT? ;) ) , so maybe that would tilt it towards this, in a bottle-to-bottle comparison? ???  ps : My initial impression , on the first one (below) . Short version : drink them cold/coldish. [Got side-tracked , & the first one warmed up to 50F? A bit strange . A slightly sour, fruity flavor , somewhere between mixed citrus & dried cherry .That, + a bitter grapefruit pith sensation is lingering at the back of the palate, several minutes afterward.Did get some caramel malt flavor peeking through on the latter half of the glass ]",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

With this one, the taste really parallels the nose, and makes for an expected tasty, full bodied, full flavored lager.

35,104,Xael,4.37,"Poured from a can into a half pint glass.  Color is a deep copper, almost red but not quite. Pours with a 2 finger head with decent but not remarkable retention. Beer is almost perfectly clear, very little noticeable haze, a visually beautiful beer no question. Smell is very malt heavy initially, with some light smoky notes, only the slightest hint of hops is detectable. The taste is where this beer kicks the engines to 118% thrust, upon the first taste I am greeted with an incredibly sweet malt flavor walking hand in hand with a perfect light hop addition bathed in smoke and fire. Up front taste is malt, toffee, and roasted roasted almond with just enough citrus notes to make the beer an easy drinker. Aftertaste is similar but very much focuses on the smoky and delicious roasted flavors of the beer. The hops are clear and present without being overly bitter. Mouthfeel is very oily compared almost all other beers I've tried. Otherwise the beer has a relatively standard, if somewhat more stout mouthfeel. Great carbonation with 'medium' sized bubbles. Overall, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is one of, if not perhaps, the very best mass produced lager around in my opinion. It's a true American lager, and a remarkably delicious one. It has just the right amount of flavor and body to be a everyday drinker and just enough character and complexity to still be very interesting and different from the rest of the pack!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Highly carbonated, burns and bangs on its way down like its actively trying to kill you. Leaves an ill-omened, metallic tang in it's wake and tastes like gutter water that was brewed with a bag of dirty pennies.  Even experiencing it fresh on tap can't save this corporate, sulfurous, demon pee. I'd rather drink lab chemicals than ever poison myself with this laughable trash ever again.

From the moment it’s poured into the glass, to the final drink at the end of the pint. Beautiful dark gold/amber color, great lacing, absolutely fantastic aroma of quality German hops, and the bold flavor of fresh malt to counter slight bitterness. I mean come on people.

This falls more in line with a Helles lager. Caramel malts are what dominate here. No adjunct qualities at all. Medium mouthfeel with good levels of carb. This is a go-to at places like TGIF, Applebee's, etc. This is a very good lager. Much better than Brooklyns lager or others similar. It drinks more like a an Irish red.

Does not get better than this.(4.75)  Aroma: Light to moderate aromas of grass & baked wheat bread, cinnamon french toast, caramel, toffee, cherry, cinnamon, and some orange citrus. Slight licorice and fennel. Some cherry& cinnamon French Toast. (4.25)  Taste: Great flavors of whipped, airy caramel atop french toast, cinnamon, caramel, and toffee. Definitely some grassy, fennel, and spicy notes. Not sure what hops those are (German Noble hops?) but malts really drive the show here. Not sweet. Just bready, syrup, and toffee. (Almost buttery, it may have diacetyl as it ages). The citrus is lost. It reminds me of the icing on a cinnamon roll. Such great toffee, cinnamon and caramel flavors. (4.25)  Feel: Medium bodied. Sweet and malt, but not heavy. Light enough and drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden. (4.50)  Compared w/ Anchor Steam: A lighter color. More malty, airy caramel on the aroma. More malty flavors of caramel and french toast. Less pine, redfruit, and bitterness. Lighter body and smoother.  Compared to Schell's Bock 3/25/20: Pours a much lighter orange color. Aromas have more cherry, cinnamon, and french toast rather than German black banana bread. Both are malty. Similar sweetness, but smoother body. Drinks easier for sure.  Compared to Castle Cream Ale 4/26/20: Pours a similar color but with a much larger and creamy head. Lighter aromas. More bread malts. Less cherry and cream. Less strong flavor overall. Pretty similar actually. Winner: Castle Cream  Compared to Smithwick's Irish Red Ale 4/20/20: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More cinnamon and bread. Less red fruit, molasses, rubber, and root beer. Maltier and smoother overall.  Compared to Fulton's Sweet Child of Vine 7/22/20: Pours a slightly lighter color with less head. Stronger aromas and flavors of bread spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Less sweet orange and flower. Yet, it's lighter and less intense.  Compared to Sam Adams Summer Ale 8/2/20: Pours a slightly darker color. More deep and malty aromas on the nose. Less citrus and wheat. However, both have a nice spice component, but the Boston Lager is sweeter.  Compared to Sam Adams Oktoberfest 2020 11/12/20: Pours a similar, but slightly darker color. Extremely similar aromas/flavors of toasted bread, caramel, whipped cream, pie crust, brown sugar, grass, and pine. If we're pulling hairs has possibly more brown malts than red citrus. Body is slightly more smooth like a lager, less like an ale.  Compared to Sam Adams' Winter Ale 3/1/21: Much lighter color. Stronger aromas of cinnamon and spice. More cinnamon, grass/fennel spice on the flavor.  to Schell Firebrick Lager 12/16/21: Pours a similar appearance. Stronger aromas. More brown bread, red fruit and cinnamon roll. Less toasted bread and vienna malt.  to Summit Frost Line Rye 2/13/22: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More buttery bread, cinnamon roll, caramel. Less rye, pine, and spice. Breadier and maltier.  Overall: This is an excellent lager. Not the most accurate Vienna lager, but unique and so great in it's own regard. The cinnamon, toffee, and caramel flavors are showcased into a sweet and yet drinkable lager. Culminates into a baked biscuit spice. It pushes the bounds between what those two descriptions mean. I got a rather older one and it has strong buttery flavors, so may have some diacetyl, but will have to see with future reviews. Nonetheless, It has such great flavors, but it so easy-drinking and I think on a cold-winter night I can see why this is the Boston lager.

35,104,dimwit_flathead,1.34,I got this as a gift. I haven't had a Samuel Adams since college.  Poured into a 12 ounce bar glass. Low carbonation. Light lacing. Bready smell. Tastes the same. Like a loaf of bread.  I forgot how truly awful Samuel Adams's Boston Lager was. I'd rather have a refreshing Miller Lite than this. This makes me feel like I've eaten twelve pizzas.

35,104,beermeister2112,2.36,"I tasted and thoroughly enjoyed this beer on tap several times over the years and numerous bottles. My memory of it since the late '80s was caramel sweet and easy drinking with just a hint if any of hops. Unfortunately, the recipe has been drastically altered to appease the delirium of the over-hopped craze of the IPA crowd of the new millenia and I just burp up hop gas. I just dropped $230 on a keg of it based on what I knew it to be...something's changed and I just wasted a pretty penny on something I nearly detest now. Way too hopped up and bitter. The only thing that will let me choke it down now is once the anesthetic value of 5% abv kicks in and numbs the taste buds.

35,104,Bsimpson91,5,"Exeptional lager in a class of its own! This beer is the one craft brew I grew up hearing so much about. Now I see why its a pioneer of craft Beer. I really cant say a whole lot about the label, other than the fact it says Boston Lager. By now, Sam Adams could really give a damn about the presentation because of it notoriety among beer lovers. The presentation of the bottle is fair enough. The most important thing is whats inside. This gold liquid is by far a top contender for Lagers in the USA. This lager could easily hold its own against the likes of pilsner Urquell, weihnstephaner and many imports. The aroma is classic lager. Sweetness on the nose with the lightest hint of honey and brown sugar. Deeply bready like fresh whole wheat. The taste is down right awesome. Big upfront piney, grassy european hop with a rich and balanced sweetness. The middle has depth and charicter of malt. Dark whole wheat bread notes along with a honey and brown sugar complexity. The finish is clean, crisp and mildly hopy. Well balanced on all notes and really satisfying. The feel is rich, and medium in the body with mild creamy carbonation.

35,104,SimplySinister,3.45,"A – Appearance (color): transparent honey/ amber hue containing a mild to moderate level of carbonation. Displays average head retention, amounting to a 1 finger head utilizing a non-aggressive pour. Head dissipates throughout consumption. Lacing is present, though minimal.  S – Grains and hops prevail on the nose. Subtle hints of lemon zest or citrus are apparent, as are nutty aspects.  T – Well rounded. This beer has a unique taste. It is not bitter as an IPA would be, though it is bitter. It is not subdued in the manner most American macros are, though it is not overpowering as many comparable craft brews are.  M - It finishes somewhat clean, though it lingers slightly. I would consider it a dry finish.  D – I wouldn't select this beer following an afternoon mowing the lawn during summer. I wouldn't sip this beer poolside. I wouldn't think “Boston Lager” after a hard days work. Though, this beer does have its place. Maybe during a chilly night at a cozy pub. Maybe if I felt like something a little more substantial after a hardy stew. Maybe if I just felt like it fit the occasion.  Though this review was a long time coming, I can't ignore the standard I've set with my other reviews. While this beer does hold a special place in my heart as far as American Macros go (Hello, High Life!), there's no bending the rules.

Slightly bitter, it is the kind of beer I would like to drink at a baseball game on a balmy summer evening. This is a beer that works well to balance out some of the higher ABV double IPAs & stouts, to refresh the palate, & remind one what a good beer tastes like. Mine was cold down to the last drop.

Bready and medium-low sweetness. Restrained bitterness. Mouthfeel: Smooth, semi-dry with a medium palate carbonation. Balanced, medium length finish.

It has a reasonable hoppy taste not normally found in standard lager however. I good beer smell too.

Finishes more sweet than bitter, with a light metallic/medicinal note developing in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation.

Smell - First thing i get is some spice, some fruit. Also getting almost a belgian-like yeast, and hint of hops. Smells like freshly brewed which is why Sam Adams got the ""craft beer"" label in the first place, certainly not typical mass-beer. Taste - it does taste like a Belgian beer but it doesn't dominate the palate. Also getting some sweet tropical flavors, a bitter wave of hops that i personally really enjoy, finishes with malt. Really easy to drink, not a light beer by any means but not egregiously filling. Carbonation is below average which is nice, less burping than an average beer.

Aromas present include malts and some hops. Nothing pronounced.

It has this caramel flavor which feels very clean.  Mouthfeel: Wet, easy to drink, light, with a body that sits about 3/4 on the light-to-medium scale. A very faint herbal bitterness in the finish.  Overall: There is nothing interesting or unique about this beer. It rests comfortably at the lower end of Vienna Lagers. It has enough character that is worth drinking but it never tastes especially fresh. I recommend it in a scenario where you can't find a better beer, but overall there are better Vienna Lagers on the market in the U.S.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,HoppingMadMonk,3.31,"Clear gold yellow color, just below medium body and just a little heavy on the carbonation. Aroma isn't overpowering, a little malt and a bitter hop smell. Taste is pretty similar, much more hop bitterness than expected and kind of masks the malt. Not a bad beer,perfect for party's and guests who are new to craft",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,chitoryu12,3.15,"Look: Amber gold with a big white head.  Smell: Surprisingly hoppy, almost like an IPA, backed by citrus.  Taste: Bitter malt, without the hop or really the citrus flavor that the nose would suggest.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thick for a lager, with minimal carbonation.  Overall: I'm not too sure on this one. It's supposed to be a Vienna Lager, but it ends up tasting more like an IPA that's gone off.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,DingusKhann,3.02,"This beer pours a medium amber color. The head of the beer is very light and dissipates quickly. The aroma is slightly spicy, which continues into the first taste. The flavor is crisp and just a little thin, composed mainly by faintly spicy hops and underlined by some yeastiness. The feel of this beer is very thin, which I expected from a lager. The thin texture fits well with the amount of carbonation present. Overall, for a 12 pack at roughly $14 ($1.16 ea.), this beer is a good daily drinker. I would recommend this to go with fatty or fried foods such as burgers, pizzas, or nachos.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,thebadone24,3.63,"While not necessarily perfect (or even my go-to when given a choice), Sam Adams is probably my favorite of the ""mass produced"" American beers. Also, I recognize that the introduction of this line inspired a nation of American beer drinkers to ask themselves ""Wait... why DO we tolerate bland beer in this country?!"" People who are trying to get into craft beers will undoubtedly seek out Sam Adams the same way someone seeks out Metallica before listening to other forms of heavy metal and you know what?

I had one on tap and it tasted so good: spicy hops balanced by a strong malt backing. Medium bodied but stuck with you. Nice carbonation that kept it alive on the tongue. It wasn't beer as I knew it and that was good. I've been chasing that beer for years. This one is still good, but not the same pop as that first pint.

Taste - ethanol , a litter allspice, most. Earth notes on long inhales.  Feel - feels light and watery, mid carbonation.  Overall - I would drink this any afternoon. Basic, cheap, middle of the road road.

Looks way richer than what you would normally call a lager and its bready smell tells you that it has more on the inside too. Malty semi-sweetness lingers on (two-row summer barley) with European/German hops (Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger). It suits Boston perfectly, for in New England can they revive the Old World with its classic taste. Recommended for everyone who never had a good lager other than the ABs!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Feel - light/medium bodied, medium/high carbonation, and low ABV . Overall - the flagship is still one of their bests.

Surprised I'd never reviewed this until today since I've had it many times. It's a quite enjoyable Vienna Lager.

Smells of grains and bread with just a faint sweetness deep in the background.  Taste is bready with some bitterness.  Feel is full and light. I could almost describe it as ""fluffy."" Bit of a bitter aftertaste.  Overall, it's solid.

Have it in one of those Samuel Smith pint glasses you can get in packs at stores, always helps produce a nice head. So this pour gave an incredibly nice, frothy head, spotty lace. Beer is amber/orange in color. S: Smells malty, sweet. Toast, caramel, toffee, a bit of citrus. Floral hop notes. Inviting T: Drinks rather dry, drier than it smells. Malts provide a slightly caramelized sugar sweetness though its light. Hops shine more here, provide a vibrant citrus flavor with a light and crisp bitterness throughout the palate. F: Pretty drinkable/quaffable. Carbonation is high and slightly prickly, beer is smooth and easy to drink. Body is not quite as light as say, a Helles, but still very light nonetheless. O: Really is a quintessential lager, perfect gateway to craft, but something you can always return to after diving into the rabbit hole and still enjoy. Enough complexity to keep you intrigued, but not too much as to scare off the newcomer.

Can tell just by the smell that it's a more hop forward style of lager. The taste is some of the piney hop notes and then a sort of toasty malt. Not bad.

T: The taste begins with a sweet touch to the beer, mostly to the wort and sugars of the barley and ends with slightly and very minimal roast of barley and a bitterness that is a bit disappointing.

35,104,Bullyy56,3.39,"Had this on tap at Applebees, without a doubt the craftiest lager I've had so far. The look: looks more orange than your typical lager, with a nice foamy finger of head. You can smell the hops, along with some citrus and some malts, but it's not overpowering, a well balanced aroma The taste is great, the the hop notes coming through on the front of the tongue, some more citrus, not quite as malty or yeasty as I was expecting. Has an even feel in terms of mouthfeel and hop character, if you can call it that, very smooth all the way through. Overall, this has become my top lager to session because of the drinkability and readiness on the palate. Not the best beer I've had, but still really good",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,NastyNorseman,3.82,"This is an excellent American take on a Vienna lager. Nice clear, and bubbling amber appearance with typical short lasting white head that leaves a nice shadow-head after it settles out. Smells malty and bready. Taste is remarkable. Sam Adams is on the money with a great balance of sweet and bitter, with just enough hops to completely the subtlety sweet malt flavor. Finishes crisp and thirst quenching. Light-medium bodied and a great American beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Fluffy, rocky, light, but well-structured and immovable head, creamy tan in color with good retention an abundant, delicate lacing. Sweet and malty and grainy nose, with caramel and honey but also a hint of dark fruit. Palate is grain and caramel as expected but more bitter than aroma lets on, although that is not uncommon in lagers. Hops are floral to grassy but stronger and more soapy and peppery than I prefer in a lager. Still, this is a classic and quite drinkable, due to the balance.

35,104,BloodSoakedAleMug,3.27,"A pseudo craft beer. Not bad and somewhat enjoyable, but watered down in order to appeal to the masses.  Look: Pours a clear orange yellow color with a one finger off white head of foam. Leaves a tiny bit of lacing.  Smell: Very faint, almost no nose. Mild caramel with a toasted bread note.  Taste: Rather sweet throughout. Lots of sugary malt upfront with a slight caramel taste. Notes of honey and apples. Mild toffee. Very sweet with a lingering taste of caramel.  Feel: Body is light with moderate carbonation. Sweet and sugary, somewhat thirst quenching, but very saccharine.  Overall: I can't tell if this beer is old or fresh because Sam Adams uses a """"Best Before"""" dating system instead of a proper bottled on date.  I hate """"Best before"""" codes - they're useless as far as I'm concerned - because there's no way of telling when the beer was actually bottled. They could be giving this a six month shelf life for all we know, which is not """"""""""""Fresh"""""""""""" for a beer, especially a lager.  Let me decide when the beer is """"Best Before"""" by providing me a bottled on date. This is simply a cop out in my opinion and a half assed way to both sell more beer and provide the bare minimum amount of information to the consumer. Sam Adams is having their cake and eating it too, paying the customer lip service but not actually providing any meaningful information to the drinker.  Was this beer bottled three months ago? Four? Six? Eight? There's no way of knowing.  I'd love to know if this is fresh, the date says it's within two months of it's """"Best Before"""" date - but it's very sweet and malt heavy - like an old beer...  Theres no way of knowing if the beer is actually intended to taste like this or if my bottle is just past it's prime.  Overall this is good, but it could be so much better. It's thirst quenching with a good mouthfeel and moderately dry aftertaste - but very sweet throughout without much influence from the hops. I will admit I enjoy the taste, but if they just dialed back on the malt a little and added a tiny bit more hops, this could be exceptional.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,moucon,4.08,"Love Boston Lager. My new favorite everyday drinker (and I'm usually into Stouts) BL is every bit as good as any micro/'craft' brew - but it's available everywhere, it's consistent, and it's supermarket priced. What more do you want? We live in a wine-making area, and in the past 10 yrs or so we've had an influx craft distilleries, meaderies, hard cider producers, and most recently- an onslaught of ""craft brewers"". Now this is all great stuff for the local tourist economy, but unfortunately most of the beers being produced are, in a word, awful. Lots of Uber-trendy hop-bombs... joined by the crazy ""dump every dried spice/flower/fruit/nut/herb under the sun in the brew"" - make crazy labels, and sell it as 'hand-crafted' for $4/bottle at Wegman's. Boston Lager is the remedy for all of that nonsense. It's truly a premium product being sold at the same price point as Genny, Bud, and Miller - but it's so much more complex and as so many others have already stated - balanced. I love the amber color, the just-right bitterness and lingering malty/yeasty-sweet finish... at first flavor hits you with some aromatics (don't really know what's in there - sorry I should have researched this a little better) but is very satisfying without being over-the-top in any one area. My only sub-4 score would be the nose... not even a complaint, more of a statement since all of this is 100% subjective but to me the nose doesn't accurately reflect that first sip. Honestly - forget the 4-stars, I'd give it 5 stars but that has to be reserved for those once-in-a-great-while jaw-droppers. PS - it is quite ""Ale-ey"" if you taste out of the bottle but don't look at it... it is crystal clear like a good lager but does have ale qualities. Maybe rename Boston LagerAle?

F - Light to medium bodied, good amount of carbonation with a soft, dry finish. Very drinkable and balanced.  O - This is a beer that prides itself on balance.

Flavors exceed the nose with caramel malts and light breaded malt notes on the front and sides, subtle herbal notes hit nicely on the middle and fade into a floral hop note that is perfect for this classic brew.

I still taste the flavors I remember, but the look has changed a touch with the now faster dissipating head, and while this is not a problem I remember distinctly putting the cap atop the foam to many peoples surprise and then taking a drink and it was still there. I have many fond memories of getting this brew and cherishing it back when it was a rarity to find in the Cincy area prior to them brewing it here.

35,104,Tgo2002,4.38,"Been drinking this since the early 90s. It's my reference beer, a classic. There is value in going into a restaurant 1,500 miles from home and being certain that I'm ordering a good beer. (And I get peeved when all they have is a Sam Adams seasonal, which I usually don't care for.) Amusing that some 21st Century beer snobs insist on dissing it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Sabtos,2.47,"Gold with two fingers of a uniform head that recedes to a thin layer with clingy lace.  Buttery bread and malty aromas. In actuality, the nose is very subdued, almost non-existent.  Sharp flavor--almost spicy--with crackers, bread, and corn.  Crisp finish.  For how proud Jim Koch is of this beer, it's only a small step up from the big AALs, and not something I'd revisit intentionally, given the current state of nearly unlimited options.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,portwood,3.56,"Smell: very malty, caramel, pleasant hops. Taste: relatively thick mouthfeel (compared to the avg lager), creamy carbonation, malty sweet. Finish: light bitterness, hint of dry smoke. (can bb Sep 2016)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Bierliebhaber3,3.67,"It’s the original Sam Adams beer that started it all, not just for Sam Adams, but arguably for the craft beer craze in America in general. This lager pours a color somewhere between golden and russet with a fairly large white creamy head and a pretty high amount of carbonation. It leaves a nice lacing. The smell is almost nonexistent, but is faintly of malt and a little bit of citrus. The flavor has some bready, slightly caramel, malt character with some hops that come peeking out at the end and a little citrus coming out with it. There is a little bit of an earthy taste to it also. It’s a pretty well balanced beer, but not too exciting. The body is medium, but must have looked heavy compared to all those mass produced beers when this first came out. The finish is crisp. Over all I would say this is fairly average, or maybe a little bit above as far as Sam Adams beers go, but it’s a long shot better than most other mass produced American beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Guppy314,3.8,"Boston Lager pours with a short but dense, white head. The body is clear and dark golden in appearance. The aroma is full of floral, spicy hops. This continues into the first taste. It has a malty sweetness that finishes with a nice hoppy bite. The bitterness and carbonation lingers leaving a refreshing feeling.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Definitely a beer I could drink regularly.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,rodbeermunch,3.37,"Amber colored lager, 1/2"" off white head. Aroma was mild grains, sweetness.  Taste has a nice malt toast caramel impression, somewhere along the lines of an Oktoberfest or Marzen. Minimal levels of hops, bitterness and body.  I can see why this blew up and got big. It does have more substance and flavor than most mass produced lagers. Its smooth. They didn't skimp when making a beer with some specialty malts instead of using loads of corn and 6 row barley. Old world hops.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Rock_Glenn,2.98,"Definitely tastes like an American take on a Vienna. While the mouth-feel and it's look in a glass are pretty good the beer tastes like a garbled mess to me. The hop profile seems nice at times to the nose, but comes out tasting bland with almost every sip. The balance of malt to hops is nice, unfortunately neither the malt or hops selection seems innovative or even good tasting.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,The_Snow_Bird,4.22,"Pours a golden amber color with a large thick white head on top that sticks around for awhile. Has a great smell of roasted grains and malts.

This review is of a 12 oz. bottle from my fridge.  L- Golden amber color, over a finger of off-white creamy head. Nice lacing on tulip style beer glass. S- Caramel, malt, roasted nut, hops. Very fulfilling amber lager smell. T- Very hop forward for this style. Caramel malt flavor, roasted bitterness. Finishes very nice and refreshing. F- Full mouth feel, heavy style lager. You definitely know your drinking a full bodied beer. O- I'm a little biased towards this beer, I do buy it often. If I had any negatives about it, it would be that it's heavy, maybe too bitter sometimes. If you love light beers or adjunct lagers, you will probably hate this. This maybe a little too much for someone new to beer to start out on, but it should be tried by everyone at least once. Very nice beer! Highly recommended!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,abarquerov,4.21,L: Peach gold with reddish notes. Almost no head. S: Very fresh peach-critus-champagne aroma. T: Very similar to the smell.

35,104,Squire,4.06,"Appearance: Bright rose gold, if it were handed to me as a red ale I wouldn't argue.  Aroma: Very nice blend of malt and hops.  Taste: Solid. Rich malt cake with hop icing. Consistent flavor all the way through, finishing clean and crisp with lingering malt touches. What other Viennas aspire to be.  Texture: Medium leaning towards full.  Overall: A very well crafted (yeah, that's what I said) beer in the Vienna style. I say that like I really know what I'm talking about, every Vienna I've had tasted different, but the style brings to mind caramel malty richness with balancing hops and that describes this beer pretty well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bbtkd,3.49,"Not too bad for a beer stuck in limbo between craft and macro. Certainly much better than macro AAL such as Bud or Miller as it is sweeter and less dry.

MUCH BETTER on draft, this is a beer I'd order at a bar if there really isn't much to choose from.  The look is gorgeous lets be real. It looks so good and mouth watering.  Some sense of hops, malty and some caramel notes in the taste. It can be filling but it's the perfect beer to go with wings.  Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,ChrisSRT4,3.14,"Poured from a dented can into an empty water bottle. Beer was all head and needed 5 ice cubes to chill it down (3 is my max...5 is preposterous). Aroma is very turnip forward (as in a lot of Sam Adams beers) and reminds me of blueberry chill and fun in Hawaii. Taste is that of Vienna, which is quite smoky...orange, minty and slightly of moth balls. Mouthfeel was of a fine aged custard. Overall this is a great beer designed in Boston and maid in Vienna.  *The dented can looked at me very judgemental.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Beginner2,3.91,"Reviewed in Roger Protz' "" 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" offers a very good one-page history of Adams and its founder and the Boston Lager's role in launching the craft revolution. Also explains why Boston Lager is a go-to in many airports.  On the ""1001"" list, this probably deserves to be on the list for its role in bringing a tasty alternative to the largest number of American palates early in the craft movement. In fact, it could be argued that Sam Adams was among the first, and probably is still the best, at marketing. Boston Lager was first brewed in 1984. More malty than hoppy (tho still balanced), this beer goes well with a variety foods, particularly summer salads.  5/17/17 tasting notes: Often my go-to in restaurants with minimal craft selections, I am appreciating two things more: first, that this malty lager goes well with normal palate foods; second, that Sam Adams is fortunate to have a cash cow that actually serves a culinary purpose other than to fund all its experiments.  2/5/22 Again found in a ""normal palate"" airport restaurant, this time Phillips Seafood in Charlotte's Terminal C. I'm noticing a hoppier twang, but that is effective in cutting the taste of greasy food. Counting @ UnTappd.

Smells of barley, malts and a yeasty odor as well. Damn! Smells like a beer!  The taste is like some lightly roasted malts with a touch of caramel. The hops are hiding pretty well in here and can be found somewhere towards the back of the taste.  Mouth feel borders on that medium side but finishes fairly dry cleansing the palate for the next swallow.  I like this beer! Some Vienna Lagers can go overboard with the caramel and sweet notes. That I do not like and I do not find that in this beer. Out of a bottle this beer is pretty darn good. However this beer gets better when you go out and have a cold one on tap.

Hoppiness with a hint of bread in the nose.  This is my go-to beer when I'm settling in a for a few. Regardless of what I finish the night with, I always start with a Boston lager. Balanced and smooth, but with a kick. At first sip, the hops are evident but not overpowering; a touch of sweetness in the middle gives way to a crisp, dry finish. Excellent paired with many different foods; my favorites are pulled pork, fajitas and of course, pizza. This beer deserves all of the accolades it has received.

Light hints of caramel.  Taste- Grainy malt base, bready flavor. Sweet grains, some very slight roasted notes. Caramel sweetness builds midway in the flavor profile. Hop bitterness rounds out only in the finished, minimal yet worthy of a higher note only since this is a lager.  Mouthfeel- Thin to medium in body with active carbonation.

Good showcase beer nonetheless for the Vienna lager style",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Sheppard,3.93,"Pours an auburn, amber brown, with red hues. Off white head. It looks really nice and enticing. Some toffee and caramel on the nose. Some malt and some skunky hop. The malt backbone on this Vienna is great, but the grassy bitterness is off putting and hurts the palatability of this beer. It has some awesome sweet caramel and toffee notes but that is undone by the hop character. It is weighty and hearthy. This is one of the beers I drank before I got into craft beer, but it's rare that I order this. When I do, I tend to regret it due to the bar's care of its line. When served unadulterated, this is actually a really good lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Bready, biscuity, malty sweetness, and just a tad of herbal notes after swirling.  Yes, it is full-flavored, as stated. It follows the nose very accurately, with the addition of the hoppy bitterness to balance out the strong malt presence, very good balance. It is highly carbonated but it feels right in this particular beer. Long finish, medium body and smooth. I must add the fact that my bottle has a best before date of November 2016.  I agree with the consensus, this falls into the ""very good"", if not ""outstanding"", category.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Pantalones,3.93,"Bottle #4 from the six-pack; best-by date is April 2016.  Nice dark-golden color, bordering on orange; very clear, with a lot of rising bubbles. Foam on top is a thin but fairly dense layer with a nice bubbly texture, thicker around the edges; after a couple minutes it starts to fade away in patches but the outer ring hangs around a good bit longer.  Smell is pretty nice as well; a good bit of malt and also some spicyish hops in there. Sometimes on previous bottles I picked up a bit of a fruitier hop presence in the smell too, but am not really getting that one today.  Getting more malt than hops in the flavor today -- a bit of sweetness, some crackery/toasty type flavor, and a bit of something else I can't quite think of words to describe. Also those same spicy Germanish hops present in the smell, with just a hint of bitterness on the end and a slight crackery-malt/dried-grassy sort of thing lingering for a bit after. That slight bit of bitter-fruity hop flavor pops in occasionally too, despite the fact that I wasn't really getting the corresponding smell in this particular bottle. Actually, I'd almost say grassy rather than fruity, but more like fresh grass than dried like the ""grassy"" smell/taste I usually get in beers. For such a seemingly basic beer that you can get literally everywhere, there's a lot going on here if you pay attention.  Feel is pretty nice -- very drinkable, but not as light and fizzy as a lot of other lagers in the same ABV range; carbonation is definitely present but never too prickly, just a bit of a fizziness to it. Seems a bit stickier and more substantial than, say, a pilsner, while at the same time not going so far into ""big beer"" territory. Just all-around pleasant to drink.  Overall, this is a really good beer, especially when drank fresh enough that the hops stand out a bit more (the malt is very nice too, but the malt/hop balance is pretty much what defines this beer so without the hops it's definitely missing something.)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

And Samuel Adams Boston Lager is just that -- a great beer, a true classic. The craft crowd who diss this one seem to lack appreciation for balance and subtlety. That hop bomb with the silly name you adore? It's most likely an out-of-balance disaster, a gimmick brew. Here today, gone tomorrow. Neither beer nor any food should punch you in the face. Flavors should blend well together. All beers should be as delicious and drinkable as a good ole Sam Adams Lager. This is a beer that makes America proud on the international stage, right up there with best the world has to offer. It's sublime. Been around a while? Sam Adams has gotten too big?

35,104,WayneEsten,3.86,"The bottle had an ""enjoy before date"" of March 2016 and came from a 6 pack.  Into a Riedel Ouverture beer glass it poured medium amber. The head was off-white and about an inch and a half high. It's an attractive lager.  The smell was mild and what one would expect from a lager; nothing too special there.  I've had three of these from the six pack I bought. The first one I took out of the refrigerator about 10 minutes before I popped it, poured it and took my first drink. The head was too short, smell too mild and the taste was thin and the after-taste was overly crisp and the finish a bit bitter. However something was there telling me that this is a quality product. The next day I took my second one out of the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, popped it and waited another 5 minutes before I poured it and took my first drink. It was better in all regards. My third one the following day was the charm. I took it out of the refrigerator for 20 minutes, waited 4-5 minutes more and poured it. I then waited another 5 before I took my first drink. Oh yeah, this one was a really good lager and my rating is based on this third one. (My refrigerator is set at 40 F and the room temp was around 71 F)  I had my first Boston Lager while visiting Washington, D.C. in around 1988. I recall that I liked it very much, but had a hard time finding it in Southern California. The next year I drifted to other things, e.g., red wine and Chimay blue label. A couple of months ago I started to come back to beer. After trying some other beers, including SA Winter Lager, I decided to give Boston Lager a try.  Overall, it's a good solid lager I would recommend to friends . . . to drink at around 55F or so. ;-)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,911CROFT,3.6,"330ml bottle into a conical 2/3 pint glass. Paid £4.99 for a pack of four.  Pours a clear, deep amber coloured body that changes to a bright, golden orange when held to the light. A two-finger in height, thick, off white, bubbly head dissipates slowly with the help of masses of fine streaming carbonation, leaving behind a modest amount of delicate lacing on the glass.  The nose is subtle and simple overall; light amounts of crisp toasty grains, caramel malt and a small dose of floral and grassy hops are present in equal parts. The taste follows suit, crisp, sweet malts and a touch of caramel lead upfront before fading into a slightly dry floral and grassy hop profile mid palate. Towards the finish a mild amount grassy and citrus bitterness builds, cleanly rounding off lingering sweetness from the malty body. In the mouth, fine carbonation and a light to medium body give a feel that starts smooth and creamy and finishes clean, crisp and slightly dry. A tiny amount of astringency on the very end encourages you to take another gulp.

There is no reason why every beer can't be great, like Sam Adams is. In conclusion I'll just say that you can't go wrong with Sam Adams. It's great beer.

35,104,Strat58cat,4.16,"I opened a bottle and poured into a Samuel Adams beer glass. The eggshell head foams up very abundantly - more than an inch. It hangs in forever. Lacing is prominent to the bottom of the glass - quality malt on display. The color is a slightly red-tinted amber, not fizzy yellow beer as was ubiquitous when Boston Lager emerged in 1985. This lager is pure eye candy. There's no better-looking lager in my experience.  Inhale that incredible honey-spice aroma. It's the unique product of a mysterious interaction between the noble hops and the caramel malt. The pine of a Torpedo is 100x as powerful, and not as divine. Yet, if you try snuffing in another big snout full . . . it's gone . . . instead you will get a slight aroma of the malt - caramel toast, with just the hint of noble hops around the edges. Hey, it's not a Tricerahops or a Stone IPA, okay? It's a lager.  Quaff a nice gulp. The hops and malt have the alchemy to create a honey caramel note. Yet, the second sip isn't as distinct. Chase that initial glimpse of paradise and you can't grasp it. What you will find instead is a substantial and high-quality malt. Chew on that malt. It is something special, bringing home the German saying that beer is liquid bread. The heart of Boston Lager is the malt. The aroma is from the malt, and the taste is from the malt. Boston Lager is a very old beer. Jim Koch states that it is his great-grandfather's recipe from the 19th century. Don't expect citric west coast hops in this brew. Boston Lager is malt-forward. Yet, the IBU is 30, and all those hops make themselves known in the deeper bitterness that balances this complex lager. Sit back, enjoy, and in the finish paradise returns as the hops lend a suggestion of flowers. Boston Lager cannot be pigeonholed. The flavors are complex, unfolding differently on different occasions.  The feel is substantial for a lager. It's not as thick as an Octoberfest, which is very filling. Yet, it's not at all watery, finding a middle ground between an overwhelming malt and a thin beer. It's not trick of carbonation. The malt is thicker than an ordinary beer - hence unrestrained head that piles on top of the glass and retains as well as any I've seen.  With Boston Lager, paradise can be glimpsed - although it cannot be seized. Boston Lager is the original no-compromises lager. With generous helpings of noble hops, a rich malt, and the resulting unique interplay between these elements, nobody does lager better. Samuel Adams started with the best and never compromised. The grandfather of craft beers is still doing it right. It's as good as lager gets.  Note: Boston Lager is widely available. If you buy a six-pack that's been sitting out in a brightly lit grocery store for months, don't blame the beer. Light severely impacts beer, particularly the aroma, even when in a dark bottle. Personally, I buy a sealed 12-pack, which is very affordable, of the most recent vintage that I can find in one of the darker aisles at Bev Mo.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

As I believe my taste has become more discriminating over time and wanting to be fair to the beer, I thought I'd try it again. Had 1 12 oz bottle at home and 2 12 oz cans a few days later on a Delta flight. Not nearly as bad as I remembered, but not worth anywhere near the ratings it gets or its reputation, in my opinion. ""Harmless"" is probably a good word to describe it. Definitely preferable to any American Adjunct, but can't rate it much higher than that.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Looking forward to my next Boston Lager!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CraigP83,3.17,"Took me a while to get around ticking this one, poured on tap. Brownish tannic coloration. Smell is slightly metallic. Taste is a richer American lager complete with the slight apple taste I often get from them. Slightly creamier mouthfeel. For such a classic beer I'm very underwhelmed. I'll try it again from another location to make sure it wasn't just an old keg or dirty lines.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BobbyBill,2.94,"Oops I did it again. I drank this beer, thought I would like it and well, it's Boston Lager. Somehow this is one of the most consumed ""craft"" beers in America.

35,104,CDR-HomeBrew,4.35,L: Dark amber/brown copper. Brilliant. Head was about 1 inch and lasted approx 1 min. 0 sediment.  S: Sweet grain/malt. Slightly bitter on nose. Hints of caramel.  T: More bitter than expected with a smooth caramel aftertaste.  F: Medium body/carb  O: Good beer for grilling and summer nights.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Alan_Bats,4.26,Look: Lovely amber color. Small frothy head. (3.75/5) Smell: Floral hops are the most prevalent but malty aromas are certainly present. A great mixture (4.5/5) Feel: Easy to drink yet fills the mouth nicely. (3.5/5) Taste: Hoppy flavors come through the most but malt appears fairly strongly as well. Nice bitterness takes over the aftertaste. (4.25/5) Overall: A classic for good reason. The balanced nature of this beer is impressive (4./5),Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TDotScott,4.31,"Poured from a can into a wine glass.  L- Between gold and amber with brilliant clarity. A white head builds up and retains very well. I had a small head for over 30 minutes.  S- Dry toast from malt. Very clean.  T- that dry toast comes through, and its balanced impeccably by hop bitterness, without much on the way of hop flavor.  F- lively carbonation keeps things light, and the finish is good and dry.  O- Vienna lager is a simple style, but it's hard to argue with BBco's take on it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hopphead31415,3.68,"This is a classic brew and is so easy to drink any time of year. I have had them many times, but have just now got around to reviewing it. It does have a very wimpy 4.9% ABV, but this one was brewed to be refreshing only.  Look-It pours a dark golden mahogany with a creamy white head and thin bands of lacing that stick around the glass for most of the time.  Smell-It has a pleasant malt-forward aroma with noble hops and a mild grassy smell.  Taste-The taste follows the nose, but with a slightly more noticeable spicy hop flavor singing high above the complex malts. There is a slight sweetness, but is so well-balanced by the hops and spices. Just remember, although there are hops it is not strong and is definitely not a bitter beer at all. Again, it’s a malt-forward beer.  Mouthfeel-The feel is clean, creamy, smooth, with mild carbonation that is fizzy. There is a slightly sweet aftertaste with a pleasant malt and yeast based coating on the tongue.  Overall-This is a classic beer that isn’t anything special. It is a good go-to beer, but is not overly exciting. Drink casually and in your living room or maybe in bed while watching Netflix when its pouring rain out at night. Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Yarmageddon,4.29,"Look: Nice and dark, like an almost golden mahogany, looks good.  Head: The head was initially fairly thick but soon dissipates, leaving dribs and drabs across the surface of the beer.  Smell: Very fresh, quite hoppy, which was surprising for such a dark beer, after a while the malt does start to come through, very balanced.  Taste: Mostly malt, but some hops lurking in the background, particularly on the aftertaste along with the malt. Quite sweet, almost bitterly so but doesn’t become particularly overpowering.  Feel: Very smooth, went down very easily, although the aftertaste of malt can be slightly overpowering.  Overall: Overall a damn good beer, particularly for the price, you could do a lot worse than this. If you’re looking for something a little bit different for events then I’d say this would be a good choice. One I’ll look forward to trying again in the future.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,NCMatt,3.61,"What else can I say, it's Boston Lager!  Poured from can to glass, it's a nice amber with an off-white head. Decent retention. Not incredibly hoppy, but more so than most in this price-point.  Overall, it's a wonderful go-to when there's not much else offered, or you're looking for a more ""budget-oriented"" pint. Best part is, it's available almost everywhere, even if ""craft"" offerings are dismal or even non-existent!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T: Some initial light malt sweetness, graham cracker, rich grains, and a moderately high bitter hop accent. F: Very creamy, clean, smooth, medium body, medium to medium high carbonation O: A ubiquitous, well crafted pilsner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Roadhouse_Blues,4.62,"If it's on draft, I have a hard time choosing anything else.  Look: Deep amber color with a lively and lingering vanilla ice cream colored head with generous lacing.  Smell: Rich, inviting, rather malty aroma with faint citrus notes.  Taste: A wonderful balance of malted barley and hops.  Feel: Crisp and refreshing with just enough carbonation.  Overall: Visually very appealing, delicious and satisfying - my favorite macro lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,hophead723,4.03,"This is the first good beer I ever had, and it introduced me to the amazing world of craft beer. Time for a review of this classic.  Look: Almost looks like an IPA; nice and rich amber/copper color with a nice slightly off white head. Good lacing and carbonation.  Smell: A unique roasted barley smell, with a touch of grassy hops. It is a welcoming and rather unique aroma as well.  Taste: The taste follows the nose but with an emphasis on the roasted barley, with a supportive amount of grassy hops.  Feel: Crisp and refreshing! The mouthfeel of this beer humiliates other poorly made lagers that claim to be refreshing and light with its spritzy and lively carbonation. Best served very cold.  Overall: This beer is well suited for experienced craft beer fans and new-comers alike. I first had it when I was 18, and I still love it at 22 even with a tongue charred by intense hoppy beers like Rebel Rouser which is also by Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,DabblinWiscCraft,3.74,"Picked up a sixer at my local gas station. The best by notch states it's good for another two months. Poured right from the fridge into a pint glass.  L: Pour's a beautiful, bright golden amber with about two inches of off-white head that drops but stays around at a quarter-inch and leaves nice cling. Plenty of visible carbonation in the crystal-clear brew.  S: Bready caramel malt and some nice herbal/grassy notes. Just a touch earthy/musty. Pleasant but unassertive bouquet.  T: Caramel and toasted malt bready flavors at the front, along with a bit of grassy hop presence. The middle sees these flavors continue, with just a bit of building spice/peppery notes and a touch of sweetness. The back end feels a bit tart, with the hops bringing more of their flavor over that malt backbone. This one is very nicely balanced all the way.  F: On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Very nicely carbonated. It's bright and quite clean-finishing.  O: I'm a bit mercurial when it comes to this beer: Sometimes I have one, and it takes like the best lager I've ever had. Sometimes it's just pretty good. I think part of this has to do with whether I have this beer alongside great brews or I have it in isolation (or with some crummy beers). I've just had a couple great ones, so tonight it's feeling a little less than stellar.

35,104,jcaron,4.68,Boston lager is one of the most balanced lagers I have ever tasted. No single flavor character overpowers in this beer but many subtle notes can be detected with repeated tasting. It has full body and complex grain and malt flavors while retaining the characteristic crisp mouth feel of a lager. It is not overtly hoppy yet it has bitter hop notes on the edges. Head retention is not great but has a beautiful clear Amber color and leaves great Brussels lacing on the glass.

It's not the best beer ever, but it has a place in my heart because this brewery helped me realize beer could actually taste good. Appearance: Clear amber reminiscent of the caramel notes that are so prominent in this beer. Smell: Malty caramel with some subtle citrus and pine to keep things interesting Taste: Same as the nose with a toast note on the finish. Feel: Not too big, but not too small. Overall: This is a very balanced beer. There's plenty of malt sweetness that melds with the hop dryness, and the beer still manages to be on the refreshing side.

The beer is an amber/vienna lager, and has an off-white head that usually gets to be around two fingers. The beer smells fairly malty, with some light noble hop aroma coming through. The taste is very malty, and much sweeter than I remember. It's very easy drinking, goes down almost like water, and it's incredibly tasty. It's full-bodied, not watery in the slightest.

35,104,JohnnyI,4.02,"From time to time I love to revisit classics like this one. I still recall my first Sam Adams. It was 1993 and I was all of 14 years old, thinking I was cool to snag such a refined beer for my house party (sorry Mom!). That first one ended up as a drain pour. I was so shocked and appalled at the (gasp) flavor that the beer imparted that it just confounded me. Mind you, this was over half a lifetime ago, and I was still under the impression that fire-brewed Strohs and MillerLite cans were the pinnacle of brewing. I'd like to believe that despite the drain pour, that beer planted the seed in my mind that has grown in to my obsession for craft beer. Well enough nostalgia. Here we go...  The beer pours a bright tangerine color with lively carbonation that sends bubbles streaming to the surface. This one could grace a beer commercial. Perfect, thick white head that falls gradually with lacing all the way to the rim. Impressive. Fruity esters and a buttery malt aroma in the nose. A little bit of citrus and spice from the hops. The flavor is malty, complex and delicious. I think we beer advocates forget just how good this beer truly is. There's just a touch of caramel sweetness, with cereal grain and a well-balanced bitterness in the finish. Hints of orange peel spice and some toffee on the tongue. The body is remarkably fuller than one might expect. I attribute this to a little sleight of hand with the aggressive carbonation. The prickly suds convey a creamy mouthfeel and feign fullness with masterful precision. Nice clean finish that begs for another gulp. At under 5% ABV, this is a powerhouse of flavor and texture. I cannot think of a single small lager that packs as much moxie as the flagship beer from Boston. Still world class in today's glut of aspiring craft kings.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,FenixDelta753,4.01,Boston lager from Sam Adams is a great example of how all good beers don't need to be micro-brews with small name labels. Sam Adams really does put some great care into their brewing and definitely stands out to me and continues to even after trying beers such as Heady Topper and other micro brews with very high ratings.

T - Cracker malts, among the clearest, strongest saltine taste I've had in a beer. A gradual hit of earthy hops, grassy and floral, but fairly pedestrian. The close is slightly bitter, but subdued.  M - Crisp, clean, with minimal drying in the close.  O - I respect Boston Lager for its craft and its place, but this is not my go-to brew. Clean and crisp, easily drinkable, it is light-years ahead of the boring AALs that dominate the industry.

Comes in a lovely looking bottle, so lets have a gander at what this Boston beer is all about.  The appearance is great. It pours a nice dark golden colour with a good sized frothy head that hangs around a while leaving decent lacing. It has the look of a real beer, cant wait to drink it while standing back and admiring the froth.  I got a faint smell of malts and a bit of floral hops. The smell was pleasant and not overbearing.  The Samuel Adams taste had a variety of strong flavours from the hops and malt which were well balanced, all tingling away at my taste buds. Caramel was one taste that stood out. The finish is strong with a long lasting heavy aftertaste. Overall a nice solid beer and a great delicious taste. Samuel Adams is a beer that you will remember.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The beer that helped reinvent lagers for craft brewers is still quite tasty, even 30 years later. Really hard for me to fault it.

Mouthfeel: fairly light and slick with a crisp, dry finish.  Flavor: combination of the sweet barley/bread dough flavor with floral and citrus rind hops.

The taste is probably more subtle than the smell, but it is still pretty solid. I get a lot of malts, grains, barley, and more than anything else, floral and herbal notes. This is a complex taste considering the price point.  Mouthfeel is light, with moderate carbonation.  This is solid.

Appearance: Very luminescent bronze, with a one-finger width white head, quickly dissolving into a light froth with significant lacing on the glass. Some light carbonation bubbles to the surface.  Aroma: Faint aroma of grassiness. However, it is almost undetectable.  Taste: The carbonation hits you right away, and you get some graininess. Not much else.  Mouthfeel: Fairly smooth, light to medium body, biting carbonation, especially at the back of the throat. It's adequate.  Overall: Sam Adams is... well, Sam Adams. It's not the most flavorful beer in the world, but it generally beats out most other cheap AALs.

35,104,MIchelle,4,"This is an amazing example of a lager style beer. Clean, crisp and refreshing. Pours a beautiful amber color with a thin maybe 1/4"" white head. The smell is light, a subtle dry hop smell to it perhaps. Very easy drinking tastes of a nice light hops flavor mixed with a light citrusy flavor. This is very easy drinking and has a great traditional clean lager taste. I especially enjoy the lightly dry finish to the sip.

35,104,The_Mad_Capper,4.16,"In the aroma is soft bread-like and toffee-like malt with a hint of peach, mandarin. The body is an orange-ish copper; the head is foamy and off-white with good retention. Smooth maltiness dominates in the flavor with considerable, slightly tart, hop bitterness and a spicy hop undertone. Some fruitiness becomes apparent over time. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation and bite; there is some acidic tingle on the sides of the tongue.  The tart and bitter aspects are fairly intense and perhaps slightly out of balance with the remaining flavors, which are otherwise rich and expressive. Along with the smooth texture, the overall effect is that of an easily drinkable and satisfying beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

This one was brought back from Boston for me by my parents and I am hoping it is better.  A) Medium amber, lots of bubbles. Pouring from the can gave a massive white head to begin with, fades to thin within a couple of minutes.  S) Light new-world hops, not expecting this from a mass market lager. Promising.  T) Good. No overpowering flavours, but light bitterness but refreshing from the hops. Faint hint of Belgian wit biers. Malt takes a back seat.  M) Typical good quality lager, light fizz. No nasty aftertastes.  O) A lot better than I was expecting and I am really pleased that this US best seller is miles better than the shitty Guinness contract brew you can buy in supermarkets in the UK. I had this one and SA Octoberfest tonight and liked them both.

35,104,dmgeng,4.47,"One of the best flagship beers ever and it is a staple of the ""craft beer"" world. Even-though many consider it to be too commercial to be a true ""craft beer"" it has all of the flavor and impact that any great beer should have.  A - Perfect light brown color basically a caramel that is crystal clear. Fluffy white head that sits nice and high. Great lacing.  S - Rich malty aroma with caramel and lager notes. Also grainy tones and some noble hops. Smells like any commercial amber lager but with more hop character.  T - Tastes of sweet maltiness with some grain, caramel, and lager flavor. This beer takes you average ""beer"" and kicks it up to the next level with layers of clean and delicious flavors. Only a light bitterness and some noble hop character to balance the sweet malt character.  M - Medium to light mouth-feel. Moderate to light carbonation. Very balanced in ever respect. Could drink this forever and would go perfectly with thousands of food combination.  Overall, this is a great (once craft, now commercial) beer that is perfect for drinking on Sundays, during the Summer, or just when a heavy stout or IPA just isn't what I'd like. Though big imperial IPAs and imperial stouts have my heart; I would still never turn down a good ol' Boston Lager.

This beer raises a nice head with medium retention and some spotty lace left in the glass.  S – This one has a smell reminiscent of cider apples with lots of lovely mild malts and some understated hops character.  T – A lovely mild malt and cider apple taste with a nice bitter hoppy nip in the middle and a sweet end.  MF – Somewhat dry on the roof of the mouth while a little cloying at the back of the tongue. Some mild CO2 tingle but overall slightly thin yet pretty good all the same.  O – Really very good for a lager this one tastes and drinks very like an ale. It is smooth and goes down very easy like a lager should but it has some interesting flavour which for me sets it apart from a lot of others.

35,104,ob_carr,4.25,"Take a tour of Boston Brewing Co. and you will surely hear the story of Jim Koch's humble beginnings in his kitchen. It's a great story but the greatest part about it is that Sam Adams Boston Lager is what it ultimately produced. This is one of the original return-to-glory tales of the Lager in North America. Too often in past decades ""lager"" to Americans meant only the American Adjunct Lager: a suitable tool when the time comes but usually not a pleasant experience for the palate.  To those who don't yet know the greatness and variety of the lager family, I say start them off with a Sam Adams Boston Lager and set the record straight! It is a great ""transition"" beer, or starter beer, for those used only to the super mass produced stuff and isn't too bold or daring to intimidate most. The beer itself is a shiny amber with a fizzy head that really sticks to the sides of your glass. It's a pleasant yet mild caramel aroma and tastes similarly of sweet malts and caramel with a solid finish, good with or without food and not too strong or weak for sit down to a single bottle or a few.

The taste was much stronger than I was expecting, so much so that it was off-putting. Consisted of hops on a smoky wood background.

An amber/tan color. The head is 1 finger and is formed of dense bubbles. The is lacing when the beer is tilted. The bottle has a best by date and does not list the ABV or IBU.  S: [1.50] I get no nose. I shoved my nose right down in there and sucked it in. Nothing. Maybe as it warms. But the initial nose is none.  T: [2.25] Slight creamed corn flavor.  M: [2.75] Fairly high carbonation. There is a ""zing"" on the tongue. The mouthfeel is thin and watery.  O: [2.25] It seems hard to believe but I was disappointed - and I had pretty low expectations. I have had Sam Adams Boston Lager before - but never reviewed it critically. It has no appreciable nose. The taste is not something that I like and the body was unimpressive.

Its deep bronze colour was impressive, it poured with a thin head that lasted for most of the beer and there was cool looking lacing as I drained the beer from the glass. The first thing I detected was the malt, before I even had a good smell of the beer. I guess this should be no surprise given it is a Vienna Larger. Although full-bodied, I found the beer to be one-dimensional. There was nothing on the mid or back pallet and I felt the malt overpowered the hops. As the beer warmed I could start to detect some bitterness on the back pallet, maybe there was a hint of roasted almonds as well? There was a crisp mouth feel to the beer. I was told by many people that this is the 'Rolls Royce' of American Largers - maybe the hype was built up too much.

Poured into a footed pilsner glass. Bready aroma with some slight spice. Tall, thick slightly off-white head above a clear golden amber beer with gobs of rising bubbles. Great looking Vienna lager, inviting presence in the glass; the slender, tapered pilsner glass shows it off very well. The creamy head leaves thick lacing as it recedes at a moderately slow pace. Mouth feel is moderate, with a nice presence on the tongue. Taste is bread / biscuit, just a bit peppery, perhaps slightly sweet, caramel: plenty of flavor in this classic.

Rich, malty finish with good, strong, bittering hops. Would not call it a ""clean"" finish, it lingers. No caramel, which is right for the style, but more hops than appropriate for the style.  Mouthfeel: Mid-to-light; strong but not overpowering effervescence.  Overall: One of my favorite beers of all time. A consistent classic. Balanced and flavorful. This is ""stranded on a desert island"" beer. A great ""all-'rounder.""",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,USAF77,3.76,"Its been years since I had one. I dont know why, I always liked them. SABL hasnt lost a thing. A nice slow premium Lager pour that retains a very nice head that sticks around awhile. Very pretty golden amber. Crisp, light taste that refreshes in the summer without going to ""light"" on you. Smells grainy enough to satisfy and finishes crisp that leave you wanting another.  To me its screams ""premium lager"", the kind I adore, most of all in summer. I like quaffing the rich head before even making it to the beer.  As good as the first one i had many years ago when it was one of the first semi-micro offerings. I'll buy a case next time around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Alex-Alkis,3.69,"This beer has one of the most wonderful aromas in the world, and for being a lager that's good. For some reason I compare this beer with Brooklyn Lager, and where the latter draws the longest straw when it comes to the taste.  But again, the aroma is just stunning!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DaveBar,3.89,Purchased at the LCBO 473ml can for around $2.80. Served at 4deg C in a draught glass.  A- Very good. Opens and pours well. Little head but it stays. Golden amber.  S- Nice roasted malt. Bit of barley.  T- Very good. Light yet full bodied. Malt and caramel tones galore but not harsh or overdone. Just a mellow blended beer that opens with time  M- Creamy and light. Not a hint of alcohol which is nice. Dry at the end.  O- Very good. Always liked a Sam Adams every once in a while.  Food Pairing  This nice little lager went well with... General Tao's chicken. Nice a spicy dish that gets cut well with this lager.  Enjoy,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GiaLvo,4.35,"Of a fairly transparent reddish colour with paler amberish reflexes this beer produces an abundant head quick to disappear. The smell is inviting and a bit spicy. You get a fizzy yet pleasurable feeling as you savour it in your mouth. The taste is rich and profound, a mild perfumed beginning slowly gives way to a delicately cour-and-spicy after-taste. A great surprise for me, as I got out of curiousity amongst the beers I didn't know in a supermarket. My first Vienna lager. Advise it to all who don't know the type but are open-minded.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeerFMAndy,4.47,"12oz bottle poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint.  A - Boston Lager pours perfectly into Samuel Adams' perfect pint, filling the uniquely shaped glass with a brilliantly clear amber beer that's topped with a long-living white head that settles to lumpy foam beneath clumpy lacing.  S - Dry toasted wheat bread offers a sturdy malt base reminiscent of the Vienna and Munich malts found in an oktoberfest while just a pinch of mineral water and a very light dose of spicy hops balances the finish.  T - Smooth amber malts provide a blend of caramel sweetness offset by dry toast on the tongue while a delicate introduction of slightly spicy hops on the finish creates just enough balance.  M - Boston Lager is smooth almost to the point of being creamy in texture. While I wouldn't go as far as saying it's ""full-bodied"" like the label, it does have some weight; a little more on the medium side leaning light with it's dry finish and light carbonation tickle. The finish is exceptionally clean, barely leaving balancing bitterness on the tongue to offset the sweetness.  O - Boston Beer Co. would never have gotten off the ground if Boston Lager was a bad beer. This Vienna lager might appeal more to the masses looking for something beyond fizzy yellow swill but by no means does that make it any less noteworthy. The skill it takes to create a nicely malty and balanced brew that's a bit lighter with no flaws is what I would call an art. This work of bottled art is delicious on it's own, balancing toasty, bready malts with just enough bitterness but also begs to be paired with pub fare as it's easy going and extremely drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ArchimedesSox,3.38,Pours a nice amber color with a 2 finger head that hangs around a while leaving gray lacing on a 20oz pub glass.  Smell is not very powerful. I get a faint smell of malts with a little pinyness from some hops.  Taste is my favorite part of this beer. I get the hops right up front with the malts kinda hidden in the background.  Mouthfeel is nice. Has a good carbonation that has a plea sent feel to it.  Overall a nice beer. This beer is widely available and is very economical to be such a quality choice.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeerLovinWoman87,3.63,"Sam Adams is my second favorite beer behind Yuengling. It has a good color, nice mouthfeel, wonderful smell, and a great taste. Quite simply one of the best American beers that you can find at your local store. It would make the Founding Fathers and Mothers very proud!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,archyquaffer,4,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a shaker pint. A moderate pour produces about one inch of a creamy, light tan head. This dissipates but leaves a 1/8 inch coating of sticky froth. The color is a ruddy amber with fairly high carbonation.  Plenty of floral and citrus hops in the aroma-flavor, balanced by light caramel malt flavors, with a spicy bite on the finish. Fairly light in body but with heft to let you know you're drinking something of substance. The high carbonation lends to a tingly, creamy mouthfeel. The finish lingers just a bit, lending some fruity flavors and mild citrus.  I can't believe I had not reviewed this beer yet. I drank a fair amount of it when it first was introduced, then rediscovered it in recent years as a good go-to brew in the summer when you want a refreshing but still flavorful lager. An extra bonus is that the beer is canned, which makes it easier to take camping or on the raft.  Purchased as part of a 12 pack at the Hennessey Grocery in Butte, Montana ($9.99 on sale- cheap!).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,WhiteHillsStore,3.36,"Something almost everyone has had but still a nice beer. The pour was dark yellow, almost orange and the smell was a lot of malt and a bit of floral hops coming through. The taste was a nice amount of flavor from the hops and malt which were well balanced and a very clean finish. The mouthfeel was nice as well being a good balance. My biggest problem with the beer is that even though it does all the things a good beer should do, it doesn't stand out. It's basic, but basic is good too sometimes.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,EvanHarper,3.75,"Orange with a generous, sticky, white head and vigorous carbonation.  Aroma of leafy noble hops and dry, crisp lager malt in close balance.  Same leafy noble hop taste from the aroma, with the malt somewhat sweeter than expected. You might imagine taking a mass-market pale lager and just ""doubling"" the flavors - it's all very straightforward and familiar, but in an intensely concentrated form.  Light and quaffable mouthfeel.  A standard-setting lager; nothing mind-blowing, but an exemplar of how good a simple recipe can be.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,W9820,3.67,"A beautiful clear amber with a solid head. It has a pronounced sweet caramel smell. The caramel taste comes through wonderfully in it's heavy malt profile, particularly at the back. It has a light and smooth mouth feel that just may possibly be under carbonated.

Smell (4.50) : Had a very nice smell, not too overpowering but robust in its own way. I could smell hops, which worried me initially (not the biggest fan of very hoppy beers); regardless, I pushed forward.  Taste (4.00) : The taste was outstanding. Very complex and increasingly intricate with each taste, very drinkable. I actually was overcome with depression as the beer slowly disappeared.  Mouthfeel (5.00) : This was my personal favorite part of the beer, the only word I found that could accurately describes how it came across is Electrifying. The carbonation and hops gave me the feel I was hoping for. Very not-disappointed.  Overall (4.50) : Definitely in my top 10 go-to lagers. Incredible beer and incredible attributes.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Moderate carbonation with large bubbles.  Smell Hops are dominant. Some malt sweetness in the background.  Taste Tastes like it smells, but with a slightly harsh bitterness to the finish. There is just something about the flavor profile that I don't like. It is too harsh for the style. It tastes like the ingredients are good quality. It just comes across as unpleasantly harsh on the finish.  Mouthfeel Medium bodied. Good mouthfeel, but that weird lingering harshness detracts from the experience.  Overall This is a pretty good beer that for some reason just doesn't sit right with my palate.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

M - Smooth with favorable carbonation.  O - Overall I'm meh on this one. Expecting a bit more but I can't really be wowed by lagers anymore it seems.

35,104,wjbaxteriv,3.72,Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a familiar crystal clear copper with a nice fluffy head of foam. The head dissipates rather quickly but leaves a thin cap and wisps of lacing all the way down the glass.  The smell is of crystal malts and faint noble hops. Pleasant but unassuming.  Caramel and toasty bread dominate the flavor profile. Brisk but subdued bitterness. The lager yeast provides a nice crisp finish that also leaves some room for the delicate noble hop taste.  Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Medium full. Carbonation is perfectly present without overwhelming. The sweetness of the crystal malts give a slight stickiness to the feel that pleases.  A classic American made beer. Up there in the pantheon with Anchor Steam and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as one of the greats and deserving of admiration and respect. We must always remember where we came from while enjoying the glut of new beers being released every day.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,danimal9393,4.75,If were to King a beer SA Boston Lager would be very high on my list. The taste and feel is near perfection! Compared to beer of equal stature is common.

35,104,davidsumner,4.85,"Preamble - One of the Worlds finest beers; as for me, it's disconcerting that it's so rarely recognized as such. But it's not surprising seeing how historic/traditional/classic European Lagers/Pils have fallen from the radar of the modern North American beer enthusiast. ""MORE IS BETTER!"", scream the masses of hipster beer lobbyists; and while I am all for better, fuller flavor, craft beers; I also, at the same time love good plain/mild, ""atypical"" beer/lager as well. I suppose my age and travel experience come into play with my personal preference some; but at the end of the day; most of the time, I just want a good lager.  Michael Jackson the Beer Hunter had nothing but good things to say about this beer.  Poor - Beautiful, delicious poor. Very carbonated and creamy, leaving a nice thick three finger head. Very nice sticky lacing. The color is golden to dark amber, nice and clear.  Nose - Not the best; but it's present and nice. Very classic/traditional Euro Lager smell. A good light malty goodness along with the floral German Hops. Lemongrass, nutty, roasted malt and pine.  Taste - Very balanced and delicious. Mild and not over the top. There's a good mix between a classic Euro Lager/Pilsner and English Pale Ale. With the extra added Malt; we depart from the traditional Euro Lager and head into classic British Ale country. Not in a bottom fermenting way; but just in the general feel of it. But we retain a very distinct Noble Hop character. There is that grassy/floral Noble hop taste; but without being one dimensional and too grassy. There is also the absence of any metallic taste found in so many Euro Lager/Pils and of course there is no skunkyness. For myself, this is a perfect and beautiful evolution of the classic Euro Pilsner.  Overall - with 30 IBU's we find a good crisp, slightly bitter finish. A very good finish in my opinion. Not too bitter but just enough to leave a good long lasting after taste. Unlike American Adjunct Lagers; you actual know that you have just had a beer with Boston Lager as it stays with you in the back of your palate. I enjoy a good European Pils like Weihenstephaner, Warsteiner, Bitburger and the classic Pilsner Urquell; but I prefer Boston Lager over these.  Nice easy drinking and good with any meal and most especially; available everywhere at a decent price point. This is my goto beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Flavors are malty, European inspired,decent but nothing special.  Mouthfeel on the thin side, well carbonated.  Considering this was my gateway ""craft"" beer back in 1985, when their six packs came in a cardboard box, it seems pretty average for what it is.

Appearance: Pours a clear amber with heavy carbonation and short white head. Lacing is moderate.  Aroma: Smells of bread, hop bitterness, toast, some caramel notes, and some faint butteriness. The smell is much more complex than most big-brewery lagers. Cooler color, too.  Taste: As big-brewery lagers go, this one has a much more complex flavor profile than most. It has some rich breadiness and caramel along with a nice hop bite. Finishes easily. It's malty and satisfying in a way that it's peer beers are not.  Mouthfeel: Sessionable but fairly rich for a lager.  Overall: There isn't much to say about this that hasn't been said.

Great balance of malt&hops here!  Taste is surprisingly a modest 3 for my personal taste. The malt elements are top notch with this brew, but a seemingly urgent hop bitterness arise and kind of dulls the vibe for a lager in my opinion.  Mouthfeel is another modest 3. Just your average lager mouthfeel here.  Overall, I give this brew a 3.5. Again, the head and lacing are pretty nice& it smells very pleasant. Although the sudden bitterness sort of jumped out at me.

I get notes of orange and bread crust. A nice clean smell with very little fruit.  T: This has a very nice balance of malt that is slightly hop forward, although it's a perfect balance for this lager. The sweetness balances very well with the bitterness. There's almost the slightest hint of wheat in this but I think that is from the bright hop profile. It has a clean aftertaste with a warm bread crust but after the lingering bitterness fades, a light malt sweetness is the last thing on the palate. A pleasantly complex lager.  M: Medium light body with a medium-high carbonation.  O: I like this lager very much. It brings a bit more to the table than the typical Vienna lager.

Nose had a light soap scent at first that dissipated. Sweet flaky grain. Plenty of bread and grainy sweetness. There is a light herbal and as the beer warms a light floral that adds a nice lightness to all the rich grain. No fruit completely clean.  The mouthfeel is not crisp and is a bit flat. For as many bubbles as I saw and as many waft upward this is sluggish on the palate. The grain is richly sweet and is slow to cross the palate. The sweetness verges on syrupy in the drink. The hops are leafy and broad and add a nice herbal texture. There was a bit of peppery spice on the back end that was a nice contrast to the sweetness.It is gently creamy and moderately full. It could have finished dry but didn't as it was just too sweet and left the palate tired rather than engaged. It had a very slight hop bitter in the finish.  I originally rated this a 3.41 but as I drank it the caramel and citrus flavor wore on me and I do not believe it belongs in the lager so I took the score down.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Retroman40,3.78,"I got to sample this on tap after helping a friend install a beer refrigerator in his new basement. It was very easy to get the CO2 pressure right on this beer. Since everything was new and freshly sterilized this was about as good as it could get. We sampled the new keg using tulip style glasses.  A - Beautiful copper/amber color, very clear. With proper pressure it poured about a two finger head that was creamy and long lasting. There was still foam on the side of the glass all the way after finishing the beer.  S - Strong malt smell with a hint of sweetness. Very good balance with the hops which were also quite evident.  T - Good malt flavor with excellent hop balance. A slightly sweet start balanced by the hops for a nice finish.  M - Slightly tangy and much ""thicker"" than run of the mill macros without being overwhelming.  O - You could drink a lot of this without getting tired of it. This is the ""micro"" that I recommend to my macro only drinking friends to try and steer them in the right direction.  This is a very good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Average visible carbonation in this one, head leaves some nice lacing as it slowly dissipates.  S: Classic lager aroma on this one. Toasted malts with a touch of sweetness and a hint of yeast. A bit of a spiciness in the backend.  T: Well balanced lager with a bit of a hoppy profile. Starts off with a bready malt sweetness that is quickly overcome by bitter hops.  M: Medium body with average carbonation. A touch sticky on the finish but remains drinkable.  Overall this one is an old standby that is readily found at most restaurants.

It was the perfect domestic beer for me. Everything is smooth, tastes great and had that certain ""it"" about it. Tried it again for the first time in 23 years and although not as great as when I first tried it, it was good nonetheless. Nice full flavor and great body. Very satisfying and highly recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,woodychandler,4.58,"Well, they finally listened to me and began CANning at least this one of their many beers! Welcome to The CANQuest, Mr. Koch and company! I have been anxious to give it a whirl since it was released, but it took another trip to Pinocchio's in Media on Saturday to make the score.  Wahoo! The Crack revealed yet another brimful CAN and my CANGlass was standing by to receive. The inverted Glug was occurring at a furious pace until I began to back off. Once things settled down to a modicum of reasonableness, I had two rocky, foamy fingers of tawny head with great retention. Color was a coppery-amber (SRM = &gt; 13, &lt; 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a great grassy Noble hoppiness underlain with a caramel maltiness. Mouthfeel was emdium and the taste was a tad on the sweet side for me, but it was still a marvelous beer. Finish was semi-sweet with the hops finally getting a chance to do their thing. I CAN only hope that they will choose to CAN more of their beers in the future.  Since it now comes in a CAN, the following was my original bottle review, dtd 12-24-2010:  Yeah, buddy! My 400th (and possibly last, for the foreseeable future) bottle review. What a freakin' slog getting to this point. Last week's NBS actually had people questioning my sanity and signing up to donate organs in case I should need them. Let's hope not!  Ooh, a beautiful finger of a cap of eggshell-white head with lots of exploding CO2 bubbles. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was grassy, Noble-hop like in its intensity. My mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was full, almost downright creamy in its fullness. I CAN only hope that Jim Koch deigns to begin putting some of his beers in a CAN. Lots of grassy hops on the tongue, making me think of the Gasthaus Waldesruh in ""Cabaret"" - the biergarten where they spent a pleasant afternoon until the Hitler youth began his song. They were putting away a good bit of lager bier, along with brats and pretzels. Say, it's time for a mid-afternoon snack and brats and pretzels would be most excellent with this beer. Finish was clean, hoppy, a very satisfying beer. 1) Why jam it into the Winter Sampler box? and 2) Why CAN't it come in a CAN so that I CAN take it to the beach or school (in my imaginary cooler that I imagine every day in that classroom)?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Foamy tall head and strong body. A burst of flavors great for having with any type of food including carmel malt hint, a large diversity of grains including wheat and barley, tastes of yeast that makes it seem like water-bread almost, and even a hint of some citrus (that might just be me).

T: A bit more hops than were on the nose with some mild bitterness right off the bat, some burnt grass-like herbaceous notes, a plastic-y flavor. Its actually kind of gross, this one definitely doesnt fit well with my palate preferences.  M/D: Medium body, carbonation on the heavier side, drinkability is fair.  O: This one's not for me. Its something Ive had many many times, and likely will end up having it many more as its often the only thing available at certain places, but I just really dont like the flavor profile.

Medium/light hops , the bitterness is not lingering and leaves a nice sweet communion wafer flavor on the tongue.  M- Light and thirst quenching.  O- A decent beer as an alternative to some BMC that you'd find at most restaurants. Reminded my very much of Yuengling Amber but with a bit bigger flavor and body.

S: The nose is husky grain, toasty. Caramelly sweet tones touch against leafy astringent hops. The bouquet is quite bread-like.

Slightly sweet aroma, with mild bitter smells. The smell sweetened up as time went on.  Decent taste. Consistent. On the bitter side compared to darker beers, but that's expected. I would see this working better for me if paired with food. I'm almost tasting bitter peach, perhaps?  Mild to little carbonation. Thin mouthfeel.

Smell: Gets better as it warms. usually served too cold. There's sweetness upfront from the hops and caramel malt. Very appetizing, great with food, and an inviting nose.  Taste: Sweet malt, caramel, balanced perfectly with herbal hop flavor which provides bitterness and a spicy bite.  F: Medium. A hoppy clean, drying finish. Good session beer.  Yup.

Aroma brings a malty sweetness, some sweet fruity notes almost akin to grape, floral hops, a hint of spice. Palate is impressive, there is a downplayed hazelnut richness, a dry but somewhat fruity bitterness like watermelon rind, a sour note that just barely hints at citrus, and the expected toasty malts. Although each individual component is subdued, it all adds up to a malt forward, flavorful, and well-crafted offering that deserves the sometimes grudging respect of craft snobs like myself. A lot better than many import lagers and also widely available.

Aroma: Poured into a pilsner glass, I'm struggling to get anything here... is this normal? I've drank water that has more character, however, I can get hints of grain if my nose barely scraps the surface.  Taste: After the aroma, I was a bit worried about how this one could possibly taste good. My worries were in vain - it's actually quite nice. A rich malt base with plenty of nutty character and a touch of toasted grains and caramel. Finishes with a light, earthy bitterness to balance out everything. Aftertaste is very pleasant, ripe with toasted malts. Well executed.  Mouthfeel: It's light, crisp, and refreshing. Creamy body. Semi-dry finish with nice bitterness. Tons of carbonation.

A: Pours a dark golden color, clear, with a 2 inch head that dissipates at a moderate rate.  S: Lots of grain with a fairly pronounced nuttiness and caramel. Floral noble hops with a slight spiciness.  T: Malt forward for sure with somewhat sweet caramel malt, the spiciness from both spices added, the grains, and a little character from the hops. The hops are mostly floral, though not as strong as it could be. A little more malt forward and sweet than most lagers (as well as spicy), though I think it works really well. Slight to moderate bitterness on the end from the hops (takes on a slight leafy quality).  M: Medium body, moderate carbonation. Decent amount of lingering bitterness on the back of the palate, though it's fairly well balanced with the malt base and sweetness.  O: A fairly often overlooked beer for me and most, but one that I do come back to and something that I would never feel bad having as a staple in my fridge. Solid at worst, it definitely deserves respect not just for what it has done for the beer revival in the US but for still being a great beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The head on this beer is amazing; occasionally lumpy but always about 1 1/2 fingers and present no matter how long it takes you to drink.  S- Beautiful smell on this one. Very strong floral notes backed up by a hint of malt and hops. A smidgen of vanilla is mixed in with the lot.  T- The smell of this lager may insinuate an overly bitter brew but that is certainly not the case. It all starts with a sweet toffee-like malt and just when things could get too sweet, the hops make their way in to balance the taste in the most perfect way.  M- Very smooth with light to medium carbonation.  O- Once again, this lager is one of my go-to beers. It isn't the best beer I've ever had but it is sure to satisfy.

35,104,BethanyB,3.6,"Appearance: A clear, medium-gold lager, with a foamy, persistent, off-white head.  Smell: A surprisingly strong aroma of toasted malt and citrus hops.  Taste: Rich, toasted malt, with a smattering of citrus hop flavor, and a touch of caramel. Nice and round, but with a distracting metallic aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium-light mouthfeel, with medium carbonation.  Overall: Quite flavorful for an amber lager, although the metallic notes certainly didn't win this one any points. The color was oddly light for the style, and was also surprising considering the toastiness of the malt smell and taste. I wouldn't refuse it, provided that the metallic character isn't present in every bottle (I highly doubt that!).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

What I loved most about this beer was the amberish gold color that seemed to change in hue when lit an unlit. A little bit of lacing on the pint glass.  Smell- A slight hint of floral and citrus with robust hops and a small hint of caramelized malt. I smelled a hint of grassy floral scent.  Taste- I'm not really a lager kind of girl. So I'm used to that full bodied robustness of ales and stouts. I loved that light, but flavorful taste of the beer without that harsh after bite you get from ales.  Mouth- Very light, almost like water. A little bit of carbonation lingers on the back of the tongue.  Overall- For a lager this is a pretty good beer.

The beer is lighter than I recall from my last bottle, nearly golden in color.  S-The smell is heavy on caramel and toffee malt notes, but a balancing dose of hops keeps it from being sweet. The hops never really shine on their own, but they serve a purpose. Other flavors include golden raisin and a hint of vanilla.  T-The taste opens with a similar dose of malty caramel and toffee. The finish is drying, and while the brew never turns bitter, there is just a bit of spiciness on the follow through.  M-I have never liked the feel of Sam Adams from the bottle and the tap isn't much better. I think it is heavy and dull with persistent carbonation that just is filling but unsatisfying.  O-For what it is, Sam is a pretty decent beer.

Smells are well balanced and quite inviting.  T: Caramel, roasty, bitter aftertaste, a hoppy upfront taste with a malty finish.

M: Light, smooth, slight dry finish.  O: An excellent beer. I remember hating this beer before and now that I went back to it it was a much better experience. Perhaps my palate wasn't as developed before. It's a solid beer that goes well with many food dishes and just like the bottle says, it is a well balanced full flavored beer.

Get some intestinal fortitude and take some personal responsibility and stop blaming everybody else.  When you abandon God it's your decision and yours alone. I have enjoyed Sam Adams beer for decades, but no more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Haydn-Juby,3.78,Served to a pilsener glass.  A: Amber color topped with a one and a half finger head that left great lacing behind.  S: More hops than I had expected to be honest. Noble variety characters are evident.  T: Nicely but subtly hopped .The noble tasting hops are backed with a subtle sweet caramel malt flavor. Bitterness is well done and the beer is very crisp and clean in flavor.  M: Solid body. Not too thick nor too thin and very easy going down and it could be very easy to drink a few.  O: A decent offering that can be found at lots of american pubs and steakhouses. I wish I could get some more easily where I live. Elegant in cleanliness and crispness.Good beer overall.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,The_Doubtful_Guest,3.54,"12oz bottle poured into pint glass.  Appearance - Beautiful clear amber color. Very nice lumpy, off-white head, starts with 2 fingers of head, slowly receded to a 1/2 finger head over the course of my drinking experience. Outstanding lacing.  Smell - Malty, touch of caramel, touch of hops.  Taste - Yummy malty caramel, dab of hops, mild bitterness on the finish. Crisp. Balanced.  Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation. I'd call it lightish-medium bodied, if that makes sense. Certainly not full bodied like it says on the label.  Overall - Great beer, excellent example of a Vienna lager and a beacon of light in many a dark supermarket beer section. Can't go wrong with this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Aaron_Ramson,3.83,"Samuel Adams Boson Lager is Vienna style lager, meaning its a darker hued beer with medium body and some roasted characteristics to the flavor. It pours very beautifully with that reddish-brown hue which can be described as amber, with a creamy foam head that lingers a while before dissipating. The aroma is very pleasing; spicy hops, toasted cereal grain, toasted bread. The flavor is very mild roasted grain, caramel, cereal, herbal hops. It seems a little wet, not crisp, but that may be a characteristic of the style. I agree with another reviewer that it is a bit one-dimensional with a profile that lacks layers or complexity. It sits in the mouth nicely without feeling thick or oily and goes down easy without being over carbonated. At one point this was my favorite beer and was really my introduction to craft beers. I used to find it extremely bold, compared to the miller light that I would usually drink. The flavor seems very mild and unassuming compared to more assertive style of beer on the market, but it's still a prime example of a dark lager done right.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Carl_R,2.65,"I have always liked Boston Lager, however I bought some recently and it tasted a lot like a beer from one of the big three breweries. The notches were not marked like they usually are, and the beer had an overall mediocre taste, not old, just reminiscent of a cheap corn beer. It was a shame because this has always been a solid lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,youngs11,3.26,"a great looking lager. Light amber in color. There is about one finger of head that settles to a nice thin layer. Nice lacing is present as well. This beer is a little darker than what I expect from a lager.  Smells hoppy and a little fruity. Smells faintly of apricot. Not a very strong smell overall, but a pleasant one.  The taste seems unbalanced to me. There is a mild bitterness right up front that does not really turn into much else. I want crispness when I have a lager, but to me this beer does not really showcase it as it does not have much of a finishing character. The bitterness is not overpowering but it is there and after while it just sort of fades away. To be fair there is some malt and bread undertone, but it is very mild.  Mouthfeel is light to medium, and there is some good carbonation.  Overall not a bad lager. Frankly I think it looks and smells better than it tastes, but it is still better than many lagers out there. The taste is not bad, but it is just kind of bland and one-dimensional. I want a lager on a hot summer day and this one does not have that crisp character that I want when opting for the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S: Smells of caramel, honey, with hints of citrus. Very classic characteristics of the vienna malt lager style.  T: Smooth honey caramel flavor that finishes with a hint of citrus at the finish. Well balanced beer with a good amount of flavors blending together. Hints of sweet caramel that blend into a clean citrus finish.  M: Medium bodied beer with a creamy mouthfeel. Good carbonation.  O: Very well balanced and distinct beer. Classic Sam Adams malt profile that is evident in their other beers including their Latitude 48 IPA. Good balance of malt, hops and medium bodied carbonation to blend all the flavors together.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ReaperJohnnyC,4.23,"I may be a little biased on this seeing as how I was born and raised only 30 minutes from the original brewery of this beer, but here we go.  Nose, slightly hoppy, light grains, barley...exactly what a more traditional beer should be.  Color, glowing amber, looks delicious  Taste, light hops, just enough, every so lightly toasted barley and grains...beer...real beer nothing more...no citrus or super hop or honey or craziness...just a simple pure beer.  Palate, a little heavy perhaps if your used to it...personally I think its because its a lager...If only they had made it an Ale...oh well its still one of my favorites, and my common beer of choice for your standard bar.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JWearda,3.54,"S - Pint glass poured from the bar tap  A - In the glass, it froths up, but the head collapses fairly quickly. I must say, I was surprised at how dark it is. A copper, amber color with an almost cream head.  S - A hoppy spiciness and malt overtones.  T - Very goood! It’s almost like drinking an ale. Has a hint of malt. I think it’s the aftertaste where Samuel Adams Boston Lager comes to life, and where it makes a bold stride away from the crowd. The finish is tingly, tangy, salty, hoppy, spicy, and a little bit malty. All this makes it bitter overall, but balanced and with a long and quite smooth finish.  O - This is a lager that truly is different. One of those few that thinks it’s an ale.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nice sticky lacing left on the glass. Great looking beer.  Smell - Floral, light grassy notes, but slight pine undercurrent like a toned down IPA. Mild yet a good nose with excellent balance.  Taste - Mild, slight earthy bitter finish, but delicious. The floral and fruity aspects of flavor linger but are blended with a mild malt backbone. Crisp hops come through too. Again this beer is very well balanced for something that is this easy to drink.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and refreshing, well-carbonated.

Aroma: Very malty, like fresh bread with some floral notes, like clover and hay. Some caramel in the nose as well, but only a little.  Taste: Lots of malt up front with a slightly sweet center and then a nicely balanced hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel: medium with some nice carbonation to tickle the taste buds. Actually, it’s a little creamy too.  Overall: Pretty good, if not slightly better than pretty good. Actually this is the first Samuel Adams Boston Lager that I’ve had in a while, several years in fact, and I have to say that it’s much better than I remember. Boston Lager used to be too hoppy for me, but the hops seems to have mellowed, either that or my taste buds/sensitivity to hops must have developed more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DeFaz,4.3,"This is pretty much the perfect lager. It may not get the credit that it deserves on this site frankly only because its ABV doesn't exceed 8%, but as far as I'm concerned it's the lager with which all other lagers should be compared. I'm not saying that means it is necessarily the most complex beer, but in my opinion it is a perfectly balanced beer. It smells fresh each time. Just because it's easily available doesn't mean it isn't excellent.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Flavor is muted and initially dull, such that the only thing I notice at first is the carbonation. But then there's this chalky bitter aftertaste. In the middle there's a hint of toasted barley, biscuit malt, or vienna/pilsner malt. But not so much as to be interesting or to compensate for the complete lack of hop character.  Highly overrated.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbed, and pretty smooth.  Overall this beer still is pretty good. I must have had it 100 times before finally realizing i have not reviewed it.

35,104,Jadjunk,4.12,"""You're drinking the first beer I made. The recipe came from my father's attic in 1984. It tasted the same then as it does today- flavorful, full-bodied and balanced. It was a revelation in taste, and it started a revolution in craft brewing that continues today. Cheers!"" Brewed in the style of a Vienna Lager, Boston Brewing Company's flagship beer, available nearly everywhere to purchase across all 50 states. Most recently available in cans, this was a throw-in included in their spring and summer variety packs. It's a popular introduction choice to the craft brewing scene for most drinkers.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a Samuel Adams Signature glass. Served north of 54º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) A vigorous pour yields a dense foamy head of a golden white color over a gold-tinged amber body with very high clarity and moderate, energetic carbonation. Lacing is medium and streaked, retention is well above average, holds very well against most lagers. The appearance of this beer rises far above average expectations, even by a Vienna Lager standard. 4.5  (Smell) Aromas of biscuity German malts of Vienna and Munich build a solid base, a mellow caramel grain note adds a touch of sweetness and depth. Pale malt rounds out the drinkability and lightens the malt aroma. Paired with a moderate pinch of floral and grassy hop flavor and bitterness, the aroma is pleasingly balanced. It's a simple, but well-constructed aroma. 4.25  (Taste) The German malt base is even more evident than before, with a bready smooth malt sweetness and a touch of grain for an edge. Hops are a touch shallower than before, with lesser flavor impact and a near-balancing bitterness. Inevitably, the sweetness still prevails. Drinkability is very high, even with a less-than-subtle malt profile. This beer may be a touch on the sweet side for some, but it is a very enjoyable substitute for those who like their lagers simple yet flavorful. 3.75  (Mouthfeel) Texture is a slick, semi thick smoothness, mildly chewy. Carbonation adds a touch of creaminess to the edge but remains tame, keeping drinkability very high without interrupting the flavor. Body is a medium+ for a Vienna Lager, light/medium overall. Alcohol presence is low+, quite well hidden in this beer. Finishes mildly dry with a touch of grain. The mouthfeel is fantastic in this beer. 4.75  (Overall) Samuel Adams is a fortunate alternative to the Macro lager scene, filling in a long-underrepresented style that boasts a flavorful and well-rounded malt body and a delicate but balancing hop presence. The carbonation isn't overdone and the textures fulfill drinkability despite a fuller body. As far as Vienna Lagers go, this one is deserving of a try from everybody who enjoys beer. 4.25  Boston Brewing Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager 4.09/5.00",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Averwo,3.43,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager is probably the largest ""craft"" beer in the country. It can be found anywhere. From the smallest grocery store in a town of a few hundred to the largest cities.  Poured from a bottle into a cold pilsner glass.  Appearance is nice and dark medium brown. Clear and very foamy. Nice 3 finger head.  Smell is a little bready with a small amount of hop over tones.  Taste is a nice sweet bready malt flavor with a little hops. Full bodied mouth feel. A little too dry of an aftertaste.  This is a great beer for people that are ready to step up from the Bud Light adjunct world but aren't ready for the adventurous brews of most craft mainstays. Nothing offensive but nothing to extraordinary either.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Caj1,4.1,"Sam Adams Boston Lager has been my old standby for a long time now, from several years before I was legally allowed to drink (please don't tell the cops.) That said, I'd only ever had it in a bottle since I couldn't just walk into a bar or restaurant and order it on tap. However, that changed when I had my 21st and had this beer as well as Sam Adams Summer Ale on tap. This will be my Boston Lager review.  Served in a chilled pint glass and brought from the bar, this poured an even finger to finger-and-a-half of pale off-white head with some light carbonation and decent foam and lacing. The color was what I expected of a Boston Lager, a deep reddish-amber.  The smell was the standard Boston Lager; pleasant floral hops cutting through the beery malt and grain with some real lager sweetness coming through. The taste was fine, the hops were bitter, floral and piney, and they helped cut the malty sweetness quite well, and the taste after the swallow was sweet and bready, with a little bit of yeast and lingering floral notes.  Mouthfeel strikes a nice balance. The beer itself is a bit heavy for a lager, but there's a crisp, refreshing lager lightness that goes well with a warm summer day.  Boston Lager is a nice rounded beer that goes well with a lot of food pairings or with drinking it solo, and it can be enjoyed just as well on a hot day or a cold winter night. Boston Lager is close to my heart; it's the first beer that really made me appreciate what beer can be. Certainly there are other better beers, but as far as large scale brewing goes, this is definitely a keeper.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Andrew041180,3.5,"A - Pours perfectly into a Sam Adams glass. The foamy head just breaches the top of the glass. The beer is a clear amber with visible carbonation and maintains a thin head that leaves nice layers of lacing on the glass. I've had dozens (hundreds?) of these and this is the first time I've truly appreciated the appearance.  S - More aromatic than I remember, but mostly sweet malts. I'm not a huge fan of the smell, but I appreciate the fact that there is one.  T - Classic Boston Lager. Lots of sweetness up front with something of a lingering bitterness that hangs on with a residual aftertaste.  M - A little thin, but it's got some substance. After being exposed to ""cleaner"" beers, I'm not really a huge fan of a slight syrupiness that I pick up on the finish.  O - This is the one that started it all for me. My first breakaway from AAL's. I owe quite a lot to this one, and even though I can safely say that it's no longer one of my favorites, it's still something that I can enjoy when I'm feeling nostalgic.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,LukeH,2.84,"I remember trying--and not liking--this beer years ago, before I got into craft beer, so I thought it was time for another go at it. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: Poured with a nice 3 fingers of head. Coppery-amber in color with some streaming bubbles. Appearance is good, some lacing.  S: Mostly caramel, a little pine.  T: Caramel malt, a small amount of biscuit, then some hop bitterness that quickly dissipates, finishing clean, but then oddly, the bitterness returns and lingers with a pine aftertaste that isn't very pleasant.  M: Full bodied, almost a small amount of stickiness but not in an unpleasant way, a good amount of carbonation, just enough to feel on the tongue.  BBC puts out a lot of good beers and doesn't always get the respect it deserves in the craft beer world. Oddly, however, and unfortunately, their iconic, flagship beer is one of their least impressive. The main problem is that it is just a little too bitter for the style. I like an aggressively hopped IPA or DIPA, but this beer enters a level of hoppiness that is just a few IBU's higher than it should be for what it is, and leaves me with an unwelcome and unwanted aftertaste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Maxwell,3.99,"For this review I will pour a little into a taster, and sip the rest from the can. I will provide a side by side comparison of the two drinking experiences except when it comes to appearance, as the can is not see through… From the can the beer pours a crystal clear, amber-orange color with a beautiful head of creamy, medium sized bubbles. The head leaves a lacing of sticky thin lacing that leaves spider webs on the glass. From the glass, the beer graces the nose with a clean, crisp, fresh cut grassy smell with a light biscuit smell wafting beneath the grass and giving a warmth to the nose. From the can, the smell is slightly intensified to provide slight citrusy notes with the grassy hops, alongside slight hints of wet dog and metallic can though those might just be me. The glass has the better smell. From the glass, the beer tastes cleanly bitter with a warming bready sweetness that balances out the beer. Acids are very light in the mouth, only providing a slight wetting to the tongue. From the can the beer tastes slightly sweeter, mellowing the bitters into a more manageable taste. In flavor from the glass the beer begins as medicinal bitters, but quickly blooms into wet, bitter grass with a warm backed biscuit dough and a touch of caramel. The beer finishes grassy bitter with a touch of lemon citrus. The aftertaste is very light with bitter grass. From the can, the taste carries some slight citric lemon from the start, mellowing out the grassy bitters and bringing the caramel malt more onto the palate. Doing this review, I am a little surprised that I am liking the can more than the glass. On the mouth, in the glass, the beer feels on the heavy side of light with a heavier carbonation of fluffy bubbles that blanket the tongue nicely and provide a slight scrub. From the can, the carbonation scrubs the tongue slightly more, perhaps due to the smaller hole. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly damp with saliva. Overall, this beer is quite similar from the can and the glass, which is surprising since I have had several of the cans now, and actually thought it tasted a little different… That being said, this is a terrific simple lager with light complexities that make it interesting, while at the same time inviting you to drink more and more. Boston Lager is nearly sessionable, and is a great lawnmower beer in my mind. A true classic.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The nose is nice and malty, but still manages to harbor some spicy herbal notes.  Well-balanced flavor with a firm feel, adequate body, and good complexity. Toast and malty notes up front are met by a generous hop addition that brings flavors of tea and lemon. The finish is dry enough to make the beer very refreshing.  Hardly anyone gets into craft beer without enjoying several of these along the way. One of the first hopped-up Vienna Lagers I enjoyed.

Way to go Samuel Adams Boston Lager and God bless America.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,doktorhops,4.12,"In light of the recent terror attack in Boston I was somewhat hesitant to review this, even though it had been sitting in my fridge for over a week. But then I thought that the brave, resilient people of Boston would be the first to raise a glass in honour of those who didn't make it and toast to swift justice to the perpetrators of this heinous act. To Boston I raise my glass and review this in the hope that we put an end to senseless acts of violence everywhere: Slàinte!  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: A slight murky amber body with a sticky chalk head that laces the glass well.  S: This brew has a great mix of English ale and American hop aromas: caramel base, some sugar syrup (actually comes off with a maple tinge), sour yeast, with earthy but floral hops in the background. This is classed as a lager but it has the fragrance of a classic pub ale.  T: Very good! The aroma carries over with caramel, sugar syrup, sour yeast and those earthy/floral hops. It's got decent body as well - a bit syrupy, and it also manages to be refreshing whilst being sweet. The finish is a medium hop bitterness, showing this to be a very well balanced beer.  M: As mentioned; syrupy, with a medium body and light carbonation.  D: This is one classic session brew. Easy to drink, morish, with enough complexity to keep me coming back for another- I am well impressed. Only thing that might hold it back is the body, it can be a little on the heavy side if I had one compliant, however it is definitely up there with some of the best brews I've had, and a lager to boot!  Food match: Everything that you can find that is honey-glazed; ham, chicken, pork chops, carrots, potatoes, pecans and pears, ground to a fine paste on toasted bread.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JesseMurdock,4.04,"This was my gateway beer. Before trying Boston Lager, I would drink only lagers a notch above american macro adjuncts, like stella, heinekin, kirin. SA BL introduced me to the pleasure of hops. While retaining the crispy mouthfeel that makes lagers so drinkable, this beer has a much stronger and more interesting malt character as well as some bitterness from hops. The nice amberish color and thick frothy head give this beer a great appearance, especially for a lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TeamMathis,3.69,"Appearance: Clear amber. Leaves a paper-thin head for the duration. Smell: Light caramel. Maybe honey and very light floral. Taste: Maple syrup and caramel. Light hops. Mouthfeel: Smooth with a balanced carbonation.  This is such a good lager, and one of the most recognizable. It has a nice maple and caramel taste to it, and a bit more bitterness than other lagers. If you're in the market for a good, standard lager, look here. I will get this again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Roguer,3.94,"A - A beautiful dark beer, clean, low amount of bubbles. Mine had a thick head (~3 fingers) which left little residue on the glass, but looked beautiful after pouring.  S - Very mild; nothing particularly strong.  T - Bright, hoppy (but nothing like an IPA, obviously). Slightly crisp, very clean. Complex, with a mild taste of pine, and notable caramel malt. Eminently drinkable; this makes a decent beer to just taste, but can easily be a volume drink.  M - Very nice. Just thick enough to swirl around, thin enough for easy drinking.  O - My first experience with Boston Lager was years ago, before I'd become accustomed to hopped beers, and I didn't like it. Well, tastes change, and after downing my fair share of pale ales and trying a number of beers, I decided to give it another try. I was not disappointed. The hops are clearly present, but really just introduce you to the rest of the beer, instead of overpowering it. Behind that, the mild amount of malt and the rest of the flavors come through cleanly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MikeAAL,4.6,"This is a very complex beer. Excellent also.  It has a thick, white head and a copper body.  A rich, hops smell with some hints of citrus. A floral smell too.  It has a strong hops flavor, malts and a hint of citrus.  Light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Clean, crisp, dry finish.  I love this beer. It's no wonder this beer opened people up to craft beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Immortale25,3.24,"Poured into a Dogfish signature snifter. Notch on label indicates Best Enjoyed By Aug 2013.  A- Pours a clean medium amber color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that retains well before slowly becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a center patch of surface foam. Slick lacing leaves a frost-like ring behind on the glass.  S- Sweet bready malt with a light trace of hops.  T- Also bready and smooth with a very clean refined finish. Aha, there's what's always bugged me about this beer: There's a distinct metallic aftertaste that throws off the entire profile for me. Very unpleasant and bitter in a bad way.  M- The metallic aftertaste also affects the feel. While smooth and crisp at first, things go downhill as the palate recoils in distaste. Medium carbonation and a substantial body for a lager.  O- I've never liked this beer. Such a shame since I was born in Boston.

35,104,ChrisKayler,4.32,"Glass: Samuel Adams Perfect Pint #properglassware  Appearance: Copper, rust. Perfectly clear, one finger of white head after an aggressive pour.  Smell: Caramel, bread, a little hop bitterness. Mmmm!  Taste: Bread and wheat, fresh from the oven. Caramel sweet after taste is found with a deep exhale through the nose. Hops appear mid palette.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with high carbonation, perhaps a bit much for my tastes.  Overall: My go-to beer in shitty bars. Really, this is an excellent beer that is done really well. I actually enjoyed this one better from the bottle. Maybe due to dirty tap lines? Or perhaps I am enjoying the greater malt presence since some of the hops may have faded away. A solid beer, nonetheless.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Rast,3.07,"Bottle at Double T Diner in Catonsville, MD after the Easter Vigil.  I've heard this being poured in so many-a radio commercials. Now I have it (for the 80th time). The appearance is quite lovely, deep copper coloration with a thick, slowly dissipating head. Rising carbon bubbles remind me of the Easter mysteries having just been celebrated. Nose is alright, nutty malt. Mouthfeel was unusually runny from what I'd remembered abt Sam Adams. Plenty of bubbles tho, and a modicum of richness. Taste reveals malt and nuts, once again, but also a tinge of nut.  ""What kind of nuts?"" asks my lovely wife.  Pondering it a moment, I reply, ""Walnuts.""  Goes down relatively crunchy bubbly. I think I'd better stick to fresh Boston Lager on tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mick303,3.87,"Colour is a coppery caramel gold colour, with good head retention and quite good lacing. Low carbonation, but good clarity and looks pretty decent.  Smell is mostly of caramel malt. Dry malt, with some apple fruitiness, some lemon citrus. Fairly nondescript, but good balance.  Taste is caramel malty, some dry pepper, hops do come through with dryness and a slight 'woody' bitterness. Some lemony citrus, earthy, with a good amount of roast malt with some residual sweetness and its all balanced rather well. Easy drinking but not much complexity.  Mouthfeel has a good refreshing carbonation. Mild malty body. Finish is dry and crisp. Satisfying finish. All round refreshing- light body. Definitely drinkable.  A beer that has a rightful place in starting the move to craft, I can certainly see why it would make converts of macro drinkers. The malts and hops come through to give this beer some actual taste. It is a decent drinking lager style that does up the game. Won't be my favourite beer, not overly complex and despite the good balance none of the ingredients really makes a good case for making a really flavourful beer. Good session beer, tasty and not a beer you have to think about too much.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mooseo,3.9,"12oz bottle into Sam Adams pint glass.  A - Clear amber with a fluffy white head.  S - Sweet biscuit malt, earthy/floral hops, toasted grain, slightly fruity lager yeast.  T - Nice blend of toasted bready malt and mild citrus hops. Light nutty and earthy notes throughout. The finish brings somewhat of a hop bite and lots of burnt grains.  M - Relatively smooth, creamy, light-medium body. Lots of carbonation, perhaps a bit too much.  O - A very flavorful, balanced and drinkable lager. This is definitely a nice session beer and pairs well with steak. I like the fact that it's available at almost any bar or restaurant, as it easily beats out all the other macro lager options.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,beershrine,3.2,"UPDATE- 02/7/17 Label changed, Now the beer is more hoppy, malt is still present but the overload on hops has screwed this beer up. I might be though with beer ratings. Brewers are focusing more on present day taste trends than brewing a consistent classic. So they say... it goes from a 4 to a 3.  Poured from 12oz bottle. It settles down quickly with a fine fizzle on top. Great color with a mild malt+alcohol smell. Taste -soft noble hops upfront-sazz or hersbruker maybe? good filling mouthfeel. 4 star beer with good flavors. I love this stuff, not a geek beer for sure but you won't go broke with this one + available everywhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,dougfur,4.13,"Pours a nice ambery color, with a good head. Smell is just a nice lager smell, but the taste, while clean, nice, lagery, has a certain nuttiness, or breadiness that I really enjoy. Carbonation, mouthfeel, all nice. While I'm not a huge lager guy I've had enough American lagers to recognize that this one is pretty well brewed and I enjoy the unique taste it has. I think there are some reviewers here (in my humble opinion), who forget to do it based on the style of beer. If you hold this up against the greatest American ales of the day, it's not going to do well, but for what it is, this is good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Sam Adams was that ""better beer"" I tried back in the day (and have had on many occasions since). Compared to Miller Light &co when I tried Sam Adams this beer seemed fantastic. But after trying different craft beers for a few years I now see its place in the beer hierarchy and it's a good above-average beer.

35,104,hermit990,3.77,"Had on-tap, served in a pint glass.  Appearance: Golden, amber color, very clear appearance. About a finger of white, frothy head that sticks to the glass on the way down. Moderate carbonation bubbles rise through the beer.  Smell: Some malty, bready notes upfront with a subtle, underlying sweetness. This is followed up by a nice hint of some earthy, floral/spicy hops.  Taste: Mostly matches the nose. Starts very malt forward, some bready, almost pretzel-like, notes greet the tongue, fading into a subtle sweetness before being balanced very well by the floral, spicy hop character. Finishes with a nice bite of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin, the same moderate carbonation scrubs over the tongue. Finishes very clean and crisp. Very refreshing, easy-to-drink lager.  Overall: This is a very solid, all-around beer. It won't amaze, but it is really easy to drink and retains enough character to remain interesting. Very easy to find and affordable too. An obvious choice for some of the more limited restaurant tap selections, and will pair decently with many foods.

35,104,dougbassett,3.28,"One of the ""1001 Beers to Try Before You Die"" -- #18 of the ones I've reviewed here.  A very famous beer in America -- came up with the craft beer revolution and has risen to the point where now it's probably the best mass-produced beer in America. I've never been in a bar that didn't have it, anyway.  I don't think it's a great beer, but it's okay. Pours a kind of bronzish color, with not much of a head. The mouthfeel here is sharper/more effervescent than I seem to remember it being, that may have something to do with the little notch at the side of the label telling me I bought this a couple weeks past it's ""brewery fresh taste"" deadline.  It's a Vienna Lager and generally follows that path. I detected a somewhat bready nose but that might be the age of the beer. Some hops, and some caramelly-malted sweetness -- not as much as you get in other, more famous examples of it's type but it's there. A reasonably crisp finish.  I would call this beer ""okay"". It's a good ""okay"" beer -- if you're looking for something to drink, and the place you're at doesn't have much, they'll probably have this.

35,104,screamking,3.75,"22oz bomber poured into pint glass.  This beer pours a nice even amber color with a thick two-three finger creamy head. Looks a whole lot nicer than I remember. This beer also has some of the best lacing I've seen in a lager, up and down the whole edge of the glass.  It's pretty average when it comes to aroma, just your common run of the mill lager smells, although it was a tad bit fruiter then most. Taste wise this thing is in the top tier of American lagers. Runs a bit dry at times but overall is at the head of the class.  I'm very glad I decided to try this beer again.

Aroma is big, with notes of fruit (raisin maybe?), caramel, and little bit of hops. Taste is a little dialed back from the aroma, as those aroma notes are present, but more blended together as opposed to being distinct, as they are in the aroma. Still, a nice flavor to it, with a very slight hop bitterness on the finish. Fairly carbonated and a slightly thinner mouthfeel.

Aroma of biscuit malt, grassy hops and faint light fruit. Flavor follows, biscuit malt with well integrated moderate grassy hops, a hint of pear and apple juice, nuttiness. Nice medium body with light creaminess. A very balanced, pleasant to drink lager. Nothing really stands out here, but the whole lager is in perfect harmony.

A - Somewhat darkish amber color with a nice finger of fluffy draft head. Steady bubbles rushing up to the top. Scattered lacing.  S - Light toasted malts with a very light lemon hop scent but it's all very faint, and there is little else happening here. Some kind of a fruity dark cherry presence buried in there also that I can't place.  T - More smooth, less carbonated, and hoppier than I was expecting from this beer. Lagers usually tend to disappoint me, and Samuel Adams always tends to lean toward mediocre, but they've impressed me here.  M - Well-balanced, well-bodied, sweet fruit sugar aftertaste, & some sticky bitter hop lingerance.  Overall, the simple yet highly drinkable inaugural brew from Samuel Adams. Definitely recommended for people who enjoy Lagers and perhaps even for those who don't.

Up front, it tastes of stale beer. Off malt flavors intertwine with hop witternes to create, well, I don't know. That dank malty flavor never goes away....

This one opened my eyes to the fact that a ""lager from America"" can be a very, very good thing. It pours a nice light orange/red with a golden hue (that's how I'd describe a Vienna lager too). It smells of fresh, earthy floral hops and a touch of sweetness. Nice head, great lacing. It teams well with the Sam Adams pint glass it was poured in and it went exceptionally well with my caesar salad and sammy. I had a couple pints of this solid brew that day and have since proclaimed this to be the best American lager on the market today! It doesn't try too hard to be different, it just happens that it is brewed with all malt and no adjuncts.

Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is completely hidden, with zero warming noticed as expected for 4.9%.

Most of the time I have it in a bottle, however I have had it on tap in various restaurants. I prefer to have it on tap, but for drinking it at home a bottle is more than okay with me.  The taste is very crisp with subtle hop notes laced throughout, balanced well with a biscuity flavor.  The scent almost immediately carries those hoppy notes in a pleasant way.

Taste - Malty sweetness, toffee, slightly hoppy. Finishes with a bot of that hop bitterness. Flavorful lager. Feel - Creamy, not thin. Lingers a bit in the mouth. Overall - A beer that totally gets taken for granted. I can tell you that if it was no longer available, there would be lamenting.

There is a bit of a metallic smell.  Taste - Once again the malts stand out providing a nice toasted taste. The hops bitterness can also be tasted but it faded quickly. A very simple taste that stays the same when drinking the beer.  Mouthfeel - Quite carbonated, but not overpowering and just right for the beer. A nice medium body that works with the lager.  Overall - I've enjoyed Sam Adams Boston Lager for several years. Actually sitting down and analyzing it I come to the same conclusion as I also have had.

A particularly good batch of Sam Adams in the seasonal packs is great, and this one reminded me of why I originally liked the Boston Lager years ago when I first tried it. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a red Solo cup (because all my good glassware in the wash after Christmas). Don't like it? Sue me.  A: Rich dark gold/amber, with a big pillowy white head that hung around for a little bit before leaving just a trace over the surface. Lacing is great, even in a plastic cup.  S: Light, sweet malts with just a trace of grapefruit-y hops. A little underwhelming in the nose, sadly, though this may be my lack of proper glassware. Multiple sniffs over decreasing beer volume allowed more room for nose to hang around when cup is partially tilted.  T: This is what was such a pleasant surprise. One of the more complex bottles of Boston Lager it's easy to taste some not overtly sweet malt balanced by nice juicy citrus-y hops. Bitterness is minimal, showing up just before the swallow and lingering amid a bit of sweetness and some piney funk.  M: A little too harsh on the carbonation this time around, the bubbles immediately assault your tongue with sharp tingling. After the pinpricks reside you're left with a pleasantly robust and rich body and a mild astringency that makes you want to take another sip, but it's not mouth-drying.  O: I'm pretty happy with this current batch of the Boston Lager, I have to try it fresh on draught to see if the carbonation issue is resolved, and if the flavor is any fresher, but by and by this is a very satisfying brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Haven't had one of these in a while, but it is one of those beers I can always depend on at a restaurant to be decent, if not exciting. Also a fantastic introduction beer for ""good"" beer from junk lagers.  Appearance: ""Almost amber"" lager that keeps a decent head for what it is and a nice lacing. Always looks good, a very dependable beer.  Smell: This bottle doesn't give me much, sadly. Usually pick up a nice balanced smell with malts edging everything else a tiny bit.  Taste: Always going to be the best aspect of this beer. Nice malts with a very good subtle hoppiness added. This finishes with a delicious slight spiciness that I feel like is the signature of the beer. Just a very solid, dependable beer when it comes to flavor, and still one of the best beers Samuel Adams makes.  Mouthfeel: This is probably always where Sam is going to hurt me. This is far more carbonated than it has to be in bottle form. This is usually better on draft. Body is nice medium and it goes down smooth though.  One of the most dependably decent beers you can get at a restaurant, and a beer I will always be grateful for having existed. Easy to drink a bunch, but also nice as a single. One thing though, wish they'd go back to the more regal look they had on their bottles a few years ago over this new more theatrical look.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,KYGunner,3.85,"Good Ole Sam Adams Boston Lager! Haven't had it since joining BA and can't wait to ""analyze"" a great friend.  Poured a clear copper color with a fizzy inch high head. Significant lacing and a film of bubbles stayed throughout.  I detect a whiff of malt and even a bit of orchard fruit. A tinge of metal at the end, the scent is nice but not overly aromatic.  The taste is great, smooth maltiness, very little bitterness. There's a hint of sweetness, maybe honey in the end. This is not as bold as I remember but that may be due to my age and palate experience.  Good Ole Sam Adams didn't disappoint.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Mumps,4.65,"Hands down my go to beer for everyday use. No mater the time of year, this beer is so well balanced you cannot go wrong.  I generally drink this poured from the bottle to my Sam Adams glass. Nice, rich golden amber color with a fizzy half inch or so head.  Smells like awesomness wrapped in bacon. Ok, so I don't have one currently in front of me to give a decent smell (I'll come back when I do).  Taste is sort of like Maxwell House, ""good to the last drop"". The balance of ingredients is beautiful, really maxing out the limits of what I've come to know as a lager.  Mouthfeel is again a beautiful balance of thickness and carbonation. Doesn't weigh you down, goes well with almost everything.  Overall this beer is what I get when in doubt. I will never be disappointed with choosing it.  Note: I will revisit this review when I have a fresh one poured in front of me to do it more justice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Douberd,3.8,"355 ml, brown heavy bottle. ABV 4,7%. Best before February 2013. Poured into a lager glass. Deep orange in colour, with lots of bubbles in its body and a decent one finger white head, average retention and heavy lacing left behind. Aroma is malty and very hoppy. Very nice. Taste follows the smell. Very bitter from the hops, almost at the very start. Bitterness has a long duration too. Full and rich body, high carbonation.  First time I had this one was at the Philadelphia airport, waiting for my flight,had it straight from the bottle as I didn't have much time left. I had almost forgot about it and then I started seeing it mentioned all over, people raving on their reviews etc, so I was really excited to find it in my local beer shop (I live in the Netherlands). After having it for so long in my fridge I gave it a try just now, and boy, am I satisfied! Great beer that I surely pick up again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The nose has a bit of light malt sweetness with a soft, floral hop presence in the background. Soft, biscuit-like malt flavor overall with a very soft hop bitterness throughout. Medium body, crisp and clean.  My first experience with Sam Adam's flagship beer was back in Berlin, Germany in 1987 (or maybe 1988) at Grunewoche. I thought it was pretty neat to have an American beer accepted for this big fest overseas and really enjoyed it (as I recall). As the years have progressed, I've slipped away from drinking Boston Lager except when it's one of the few bottled or draft beers available at any eating establishments my wife and I visit (there are just too many other new beers to explore these days -- a good ""problem"" if ever there was one).

Between the aroma to taste to body, everything shines through and nothing is overdone.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MadScientist,3.83,A: A deep good with excellent clarity. The persistent off-white head is comprised of compact bubbles.  S: A low Noble hops aroma that is a bit earthy and spicy. There is a moderate amount of German malt character although I don't know whether that's Vienna or Munich but I get there. Otherwise a fairly clean lager with no inappropriate aromas.  T: A soft malt flavor at a moderate level. There is a moderate hop bitterness with a little bit of a spicy hops flavor. The balance is about even between the malt and the bitterness. The finish is somewhat dry with a the malt flavor and hops bitterness in the aftertaste.  M: A smooth medium-light bodied beer with moderately-strong carbonation.  O: A good Vienna lager that pairs well with food.

Color is golden with a hint of amber.  S-Smells lagerish, clean malt with a kiss of Noble hops. Slightly sweet and toasted malt aroma noted.  T-Clean malt flavor upfront (slightly toasted and a bit sweet). The hops, which have a herbal character, have a long lingering bitter finish that is a bit overwhelming for such a simple beer and takes away from the drinkability.  M-Highly carbonated, medium bodied.  O-A decent flavor profile with a longer bitter finish than I'd like in this style. Goes well with a spicy dish.

35,104,FratyardVines,3.61,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a surprisingly light orangey-red color and a finger width head that slowly dissipates, when on draft this head lingers longer. The smell is spicy with a little hint of sweet. Boston Lager maintains a malty taste that is quite even in its flavor despite the variety of spices and caramel that excite the drinker. True to its label, this beer really is “rich, balanced, and complex.” As a student in Boston, this has served as a reliable fallback option at bars and restaurants when other Sam Adam’s varieties are unavailable. As Mr. Adam’s most popular brew, this lager can be found in almost every seasonal variety pack available from the Boston Brewing Company and its popularity is certainly well deserved.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Lines and splotches of foamy lacing stay on the glass for a while.  Aroma is notes of nutty, biscuity malts up front. Sweet caramel, and eventually piney hops.  The taste profile mimics the aroma quite well. A nice, warm nuttiness comes first, then a smoother, sweeter caramel malt experience. The finish is just hoppy enough to add balance.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, slight creaminess.  Overall, hit and miss. Sometimes it seems watered down.

35,104,TheCondor,4.04,"It was not until recently that I realized that I had never reviewed the beer that really started it all for me, Samuel Adam's Boston Lager. While you can argue, and I may agree with you depending on my mood, that SABL is not a true ""craft"" beer because it is so commercialized and successful, that doesn't mean it isn't good. In fact, it's excellent. This is the beer that encouraged me to try new beers in the beginning, and then Founders turned me all the way! That being said, on tap at Conrads into a mug.  Appearance - A nice amber/golden color with a good one and a half finger head with lacing that sticks around. Good pour and presentation from the barkeep. Of course, you gotta love the classic packaging. It looks like they have recently updated their packaging, which I think is a travesty.  Smell - Malts, toasty breads, some barley and some hops. A bit of light caramel rounds out one of the truly special nasal experiences in all of beer-dom. All beers should strive for such a balanced, distinctive nose.  Taste - Another superior example of the care and forethought put into this flagship lager. Smooth malty notes intermingle with breads, which fade into caramel and a bit of hops. Much like the nose, well balanced. Subdued, nothing is too extreme  Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth, medium bodied, medium carbonation. A little bit of hops at the back end, as well as some nuttiness.  Overall - This truly is a special beer. Like I said, this got me going into craft beer. I will still drink SABL anytime, anywhere it is offered. If I can't make up my mind as to what exotic ber I want, I'll say forget it and grab this. Generally, this is a sidenote purchase at the beer gettin' place, kind of a counter balance so if all the exotic beers I get suck, at least I got a sixer of SA out of the deal. Exactly what a beer should be",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Winston_Smith,4.35,"Appearance: An attractive copper/amber hue with a finger of creamy beige head. Killer lacing.  Smell: Nose is a bit clogged today, but it's not my first time... This stuff is sweet and malty. No bad characteristics in the nose at all.  Taste: Smoooth, creamy texture, without being too thick. Caramel, malts, and hops come out, the former and latter being my favorite part of this brew. A variety of spices are present as well. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel: This is one of the smoother beers out there. Each sip is refreshing, and it's not too carbonated.  Overall: I drink Boston Lager every so often, particularly if it's on tap. I used to think ""lager"" meant fizzy, yellow, boring beer, and Sam Adam's has shown me different. If you live under a rock, and have never had it, what are you waiting for?

Out of the bottle it pour a very appealing dark-golden color, the head is always surprising to me so very white. It has staying power so be careful not to pour to much to fast. Mouthfeel is nothing special, in fact, the more I think about it, I recall it as feeling very carbonated.  Overall, it truly is a special beer.

35,104,BeerDocT,3.68,"Finally getting around to reviewing one of the beers that started the micro brew movement. Here goes... .  Served in a chilled tulip glass.  -Appearance 3.5: Poured out a deep golden color. OK head: about a 1/4 inch. Nice swirls of foam after head dissipated. Lots of CO2 bubbles floating around.  -Smell 3.5: Subdued bouquet of sharp hops and some barley. Definitely better than your average beer.  -Taste 4.0: Front is slightly sweet and quickly leads into a middle that has noticeable hoppiness and malt character, but is very subdued. Finish is slightly sweet with more of the hops and malt along with a noticeable (and refreshing) sour taste. Aftertaste is of medium length and features more of those delicious hops.  -Mouthfeel 3.25: Somewhat average mouthfeel. Very similar to any macro you can pick up.  -Overall 3.5: Better than average beer that certainly has withstood the test of time. I also know two important things about Sammy A.: 1.) it is a great session beer and 2.) it does not go well with some foods (like pizza).

35,104,Seekerpilgrim,4.03,"One of the most beautiful beers I've seen, it pours heavy burnt orange with hints of brown and gold. Floating off the considerably thick head, strong pine notes from the Noble hops are followed by a subtle citrus background. On the tongue, milder that the strong hop scent would lead you to suspect, a slight honey sweetness taking the edge off the confident hop bite, and a quick clean finish that leaves you either refreshed or disappointed, depending on your mood. This is a sold beer, not too complex but hitting all the basics, giving a great baseline with which to judge more unique beers if you so choose to experiment, or just a palate cleanser to go with a burger or fish and chips.

I have gone to crappy restaurants in the past JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD BOSTON LAGER ON TAP. Sadly, I have yet to drink a boaton lager from a bottle that tastes anything like the kegged version. It always tastes more bitter, and there is none of the bready, sweet malt finish that i get on tap. i had always chalked it up to being skunked by light or from sitting too long on the shelf. That's why I had been anxiously awaiting the new Sam can. No light contamination, brand new product. Today, I bought a 12 pack. I am sad to say that the experience was a huge letdown. Out of the can or poured into a glass, the beer tasted flat and bitter with an almost sour aftertaste, like vinegar. think i have decided that I am finished with spending money on boston lager from a store. It's just a different beer from what is put in kegs. Even Guinness with their nitrogen tap manages to bottle something that tastes the same as on tap.

The first taste is sweet malts followed by a little hop bitterness, some citrus, and herbs.... such a crisp and rich tasting lager. I could drink these all day!  As with many people this is the beer that introduced me to the craft industry, and still to this day remains a beer that i can always count on for a quality, well balance beer... shocked that i am just now appreciating it enough to review!

O- For some odd reason this was my first tast of the Boston Lager. I picked up the Harvest Collection but left the lagers alone because I thought they couldn't stand up to the other seasonal beers.

A: A steady pour produces 2 fingers of dense off-white head above a brilliant, crystal-clear amber body. Great retention and lacing. Stunning.  S: Crisp bready maltiness dominates, with caramel sweetness and herbal hoppiness playing supporting roles. Simple and enjoyable.  T: Sweet malts up front, followed by some leafy hops and finally a slightly earthy, yeasty finish. Quite clean in the end, although the caramel sweetness plays a larger role than I'd like overall. Still, I won't fault it too much for being really flavorful - it's a tasty lager.  M: Soft, delicate carbonation in a creamy medium body. Truly remarkable, and luxurious.

35,104,GMB,4.5,"Samuel Adams' Boston Lager pours a deep amber body and a frothy off-wheat head. A handful of threads of fine bubbles slowly add a bit of sparkle in the glass.  The beer's nose is inviting. Floral hops stand out, but notes of toasted, caramel-like malt and hint of citrus are also palatable.  The initial taste more or less follows the nose, but the beer becomes more interesting as its flavors develop on the palate. Its bitterness adds a perfectly balanced finish to flavors of roasted grains, mild caramel, grassy and flowery hops, and a hint of citrus. The citrus flavor harmonizes with the beer's hoppy bitterness and yeast-derived fruity undertones to create the illusion of orange zest. Beautiful.  The mouthfeel is almost perfect; a bit gassier than I like in a beer whose malt is so rich and toasted.  I've tried lots of the Boston Beer Company's offerings, from standard, year-round brews to expensive beers that come in fancy bottles.

35,104,tectactoe,3.31,"On tap at the Town Pump in Detroit. Poured a light copper color with a pretty thick, creamy looking head that was very inviting. Nice up front hop aroma, fairly mild, along with malts and grains - nice parity among the different smells going on. The first taste hits you with a little bit of the hop bitterness followed by a nice sweet and malty body. Call me crazy, but I tasted just a BIT of faint apple flavors in there, along with maybe some other kind of fruit. By the end, some more floral flavors came out but the malty finish also got stronger. A very crisp beer, thanks to the carbonation with an overall thin body, very smooth going down.  Considering a company as large as Samuel Adams, it's still obvious that they put a lot of care into their brews. As far as the ""larger"" brew companies go, this is some of the best.

Smell: Has a crisp, grainy smell with a little bit of malty sweetness. Faint smell of spicy Noble hops as well.  Taste: Has a crisp, toasty taste up front with a good amount of coarse, hoppy bitterness. Finishes toasty, bitter, and slightly sweeter with a nice toasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and well-carbonated with a nice body to it as well.  Overall: Rightly or wrongly, this is the standard Vienna lager today. It's a fairly easy-drinking, accessible lager with a good amount of flavor and a nice hop profile. Nothing world-changing, but something I never mind having every time I open a Sam Adams mixed pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,punky796,4.13,"Poured from a bottle into a Boston Lager tulip glass.  A - Pours smoothly into two fingers of head, a dark clear amber color. Head remains for awhile, medium lacing, good bubbling from the etching on the inside bottom of the glass.  S - The hop smell is the first thing I noticed, flowery with a little bit of citrus, then balanced out with a healthy serving of malt.  T - Pretty sweet-flavored but also with an Earthiness that balance each other out very nicely. A decent bite from the hops but very balanced with the rest of the flavors.  M - Again, balance is this beer's m.o. Not overly carbonated, just enough to fizz while having a satisfying heaviness. Pretty long finish.  O - It seems like a bit of a cliche choice to name this one as one of your favorites, but maybe there's a reason for that. A well-balanced beer that's refreshing and just as good whether you're sipping or taking a big gulp.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Auraan,4.1,"Poured a nice clear amber with a thin white head and abundant carbonation bubbles. A good look for a Vienna lager. Scents of grainy malt, sweet, honey malt and some undertones of earthy and herbal European hops. A quite nice aroma profile. Malty with a nice hit of hops, very good. Taste begins with sweet, caramel and honey-like malt flavors, backed by earthy and herbal hop flavors. The hop flavors remain throughout the sip and into the finish and aftertaste. Midway through the sip the hops get a bit more intense but not overly so, still balanced by sweet malt. The finish continues with the sweet malt and hops, but with a little bit more grainy malt. The aftertaste is honey, grainy malt and herbal and earthy hops. A nice flavor profile, very balanced between malt and hops, pleasant to drink. Mouthfeel is light bodied, moderately carbonated, on point for the style, with a crisp feeling. Very good, what a lager should be. Overall this is a good session lager. Its balanced and flavorful, but light enough to not be overwhelming. Its also available everywhere, which is nice. Its a winner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JohnnyMc,2.88,"Sam Adams flagship beer.  Pours out a deeper orange with yellow hints and 2 fingers of white head.  The aroma has some grassy/earthy hops, caramel and biscuity malt.  The taste is very similar except the hops are somewhat subdued. The grassy/earthy hops come out upfront and then there is the caramel malt sweetness in the middle with a decent amount of bready malt. It finishes kind of dry and a decent amount of bitterness.  The mouthfeel is lighter medium and it's very refreshing and easy to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,thagr81us,3.62,"Style tick! How have I not done this one yet!? Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, earth, earth hop, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, earth, earth hop, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have to give this beer credit as it has definitely done its part with converting people over to craft beer. There is not a huge amount going on here, but it is rather easy to drink and is fairly well balanced at the same time. This fact makes it rather easy to drink and enjoyable for those without a palate for big and bold craft beers. However, if you do have a palate like that this one might not be your favorite. But always remember to give credit where it is due and this one deserves some of that.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,gentlystewed,4.38,"Poured with this one with great enthusiasm into a Samuel Smith pint glass. The beautiful creamy white pillow of a head begins with a healthy inch and a half then lowers down to a quarter. The body has a pristine amber coloring to it that only the best lagers seem to have. The malty, biscuity, and sweet bread aromas shoot up my nasal passage like tiny harmless bolts of lightening. I'm only catching a hint of the Nobel hops, but it's enough to make my mouth water. As far as taste goes the hops take center stage at first then all the malt notes the nose told you about come on strong, all to end with a hefty but not overwhelming Bavarian hop bite. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation, unlike most other American lagers.

35,104,ErikSkidmore,4.47,"This was the beer that helped me transition to the craft side. I was drinking this and a couple weeks later I was into all of the IPA's and I became a hophead quick.  A: This beer pours a beautiful amber color, easily the best color a lager can have. The head is a nice three fingers when poured semi-aggressive.  S: Right away I get slight citric notes and floral notes from the noble hops, balanced out perfectly with a nice caramel malt backbone to this one. This is what a lager should smell like.  T: The first drink I get slight hops, a little more floral and earthy than citric, then the malt comes in to even things out. As I get further into the brew slight citrus and orange shines through. Not the hoppiest beer I have ever had but the perfect amount for the style.  M: Medium-bodied and is definitely not carbonated like a 7-Up like Budweiser and all of that stuff. Very respectable.  O: Overall this beer is excellent for the style. A perfect representation of how the other macro breweries should be brewing their lagers. This beer is delicious and great for somebody wanting to transition to craft.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

This is definitely a lager and has a nice crispness to it. There is a surprisingly present hop profile in here that I wasn't expecting.

35,104,thehyperduck,3.89,"355 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Oct 2012. I've been interested in trying this stuff pretty much since I first saw it, but haven't been able to convince myself to spend the beans on a full sixer. Thank god for breakage, and the resulting singles.  Pours a beautiful, translucent orange-amber colour, topped with one finger of fizzy, soapy off-white head that is in a hurry to go somewhere else. A wispy cap and thin collar are its only remnants. The aroma is enticing, if a bit straightforward - bready malt sweetness with hints of brown sugar, clementines, grass and a healthy dose of earthy, leafy hops.  The taste is approachable and balanced, with bready malts and caramel sweetness forming the backbone. Hints of lemons, spice and wet hay yield to the grassy, floral noble hop dryness of the finish. Bittersweet aftertaste that lingers on the palate briefly. On the light side of medium-bodied, with heavy carbonation that gives it a crisp, spritzy mouthfeel. Well-suited to drinking in copious quantities.  Not something that is going to be knocking many socks off, but still a supremely well-made lager. Very drinkable, but not at all bland or cloying like its macro competitors. A little too fizzy for my liking, but I'm really digging for complaints here - this is great stuff and there's no reason not to try it.  Final Grade: 3.89, a worthy B+. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is a tasty, balanced session brew packed with far more flavour than your typical 5%-ish mass-produced lager. Very good for what it's meant to be, and something most beer drinkers - from the most hardcore macro swiller to the most uptight of BAs - can probably appreciate to some extent. A solid flagship beer that I will most likely pick up again at some point.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JamesMN,3.51,"Appearance: Translucent golden/straw color. Practically glows in the glass. Big sturdy looking off-white head that's sticking around(and left some decent lacing). Looks appetizing.  Aroma: Sweet bread and sourdough. Some hop aroma in the nose similar to a pale ale. But mostly dominated by the malt and bready notes.  Taste: The palate is dominated by the malt but still retains a good amount of bitterness from hops that seem to contribute more IBUs than flavor. Although, the more you drink the more the hop spice comes out and balances with the malt. The taste fits with the style but I'm not wowed by the flavor.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is right on target and it is medium bodied. However, the malts become a little cloying and I would not call this beer refreshing. Average drinkability.  Final Thoughts: While Boston Lager probably the only Samuel Adams beer that I would buy a six pack of, I don't feel any urgency to go and do so. However, where ""craft beer for the masses"" is concerned, it does the job nicely.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A: This beer pours a light golden/amber color with a 2 plus inch soapy white head. I poured it aggressively cuz im drunk!  S: Smell is of grassy notes accompanied by an earthy hop aroma and a little bit of spice.  T: Out of a glass, which is a first for me, I get a real earthy character with grassy notes and spiced hops. A tint sweeter than a Noble pils, but a totally different beer all together.  M: Definitely a session beer, very common. Not much carbonation to speak of but very drinkable and better than any adjunct lager since people seem to view this beer as a gateway beer.  O: My be considered a gateway beer from adjunct to craft but its a signature beer to the Sam Adams name and is a hell of a lot better than a lot of brewers signature beers.

Very nice and intersting malty aromas, present, yet rather on the aftertaste hops, that are more of a floral component, not much of a bitter thing...  M: Carbonation feels just right, but a pretty average mouthfeel  O: Good lager beer, beautiful colour, high drinkability, appealing hops and a very good malty taste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S- Very nice. Clean light to medium malts, kind of grassy. Just a light bit of bittering hops.  T- Much more bitter upfront than expected from smell, followed by the nice malty flavor and some more bitter hops. A bitter bite at swallow before a lightly sweet, light malt finish.  M- Medium body.

Pours very clear, dark amber, with a few fingers of slowly settling off white head and nice clingy lacing. Bready malt aroma with some earthy, floral hop notes emerging and light sweetness.  The flavor is straightforward enough, with ample bready malt that has a mildly toasty character, some floral hop notes, fairly restrained bitterness, and a bit of caramel sweetness that dries up well in the finish.  The body is medium and carbonation is good; drinks smoothly and very easily. This is an American classic, an early, seminal craft lager that shouldn't be overlooked.

I get lots of nice toasted maltiness throughout. Hop resin. And then at the end, the hops fade, and the taste transitions to more maltiness and a slightly buttery/bready/smooth aftertaste.  Finish - semi-dry. Crisp. Refreshing.

I'm a big fan of ""industry firsts,"" so while I know this wasn't the first craft brew on American soil, it was one of the pioneers of the art and for that it must be recognized.  A - A ruby amber with little to no visible carbonation. This beer pours the easiest, stickiest head out of any beer I know. The head is pillowy and airy, sticking to my glass.  S - A deep malt, and the Sam Adams smell, not sure what it is but all of their brews seem to share a common smell/aftertaste. Slight hoppiness and a bit of grassy/citrusy aroma.  T - The most balanced beer ever. Sure, more beers are in your face, but this has a great combination of caramel malty sweetness, citrusy hops bitterness, smooth carbonation, a bready, yeasty taste followed by a floral hint at the end. This should be the standard bearer for American Lagers. Great with cheesy Italian, hearty homestyle, or any hearty, cheesy meal.  M - Light and smooth but not watery whatsoever. You can feel the carbonation but it doesn't diminish your ability to consume as much or as little of this beer as you want.  This is my go-to beer at a bar. Problem I have with the beer is it's too ""mainstream"" for the hip crowd, but too fancy for the mainstream joints, so I tend to either overpay or never see this beer at my local watering holes.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It doesn't sound THAT spectacular but you must see it for yourself. The smell reminded me a lot of the Latitude 48 IPA, grapefruit, Lemon, Hops, and a whole variety of other scents coming through, Although it was a bit toned down in this brew. Still smelled great. The taste followed the smell, It pretty much reminded me of an easier, slightly lighter version of the Latitude 48. Lots of hops, Lots of grapefruit, And a delicious but very slight sherbert creaminess flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is just as good.

I've had it a handful of times since then -- including once at the Samuel Adams Brewery in Boston -- and my opinion has changed quite a bit. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is worlds better than BMC... no doubt.  It's a beer beer. It looks like a beer. Smells like a beer. There isn't much lacing, (most of the time) and the head dissipates quite quickly.

Lacing is left behind on the glass as the head dissipates. There is excellent head retention for this beer. The aroma is of sweet and bready malts and citrus and floral hops.

There is mild citrus from the hops present in the flavor. The flavors are well balanced. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry.

35,104,Loaf,3.5,"Sam Adams Boston Lager was the first beer I learned to drink and not hate, so it will probably always hold a special place with me.  I think it actually was their marketing campaign that caused me to end up picking it out of the cooler when going to the party that fateful night, to be honest.  Before this, it was nothing but Labatt Blue and Keystone Light at every party I went to. I grew very, very tired of those brews very, very quickly. I thought to myself: ""There REALLY must be more to beer than this.""  It turns out, there is.  Boston Lager is a good introduction to a fully flavored beer. Most people I've found seem to think it tastes gross, or too bitter, etc. at first tasting. Then a few months later I offer it to them again, and usually they'll have a couple.  Fast forward a few months and I'll see them leaving the grocery store with a pack of Guinness Draught. You gotta start somewhere!  For as mass produced as it is, the flavor is really excellent, and it is a very solid beer overall.

I'd had it before, over 10 years ago before I really got into beer other than the obvious reasons. I go for the taste above all. It's a dark amber, almost copper color. I'm a Pils fan, but I really like the big malty flavor that is balanced by the strong Hop presence. I love it though it's a bit expensive in Utah(just under $12 a 6 pack) I ordered a ""Perfect Pint"" and am looking forward to using it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,dbrauneis,3.88,"A: Pours a crystal clear amber in color. The beer has a finger tall creamy light beige head that slowly reduces to a thick film covering the entire surface of the beer with a slightly thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Significant lacing is observed.  S: Moderate aromas of grainy malts with some light amounts of sweetness and floral hops.  T: The beer has flavors of both caramel malts (contributing some sweetness) and biscuit malts. There is a light presence of floral hops that contribute some light bitterness in the finish.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth.  O: This beer is very easy to drink and definitely quite sessionable. To me this was a gateway beer to the craft beer scene, way back in the early 1990s when I first started to drink it. The beer has a nice flavor but it is not one of my overall favorites.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,FlemingVSKing,3.85,"I went into Boston Lager expecting a Coor/Budweiser/Miller/Michelob equivalent, but it is in all honesty far beyond that.  I have had Sam Adams Imperial White before, and this resembles a less intense version of that. Noble hops are clearly present in a passive form, and there is a more bold taste over the traditional american style lager.  Head retention and lacing is ideal, the aroma is crisp, the finish is refreshing, and overall, this is absolutely best american lager I've ever had bar none.  I highly recommend this as a permanent upgrade for anybody considering bringing any of the 4 beers mentioned in the opening paragraph to a party. It's just better. No debate about it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Brilliantly clear orange peel/amber liquid is topped by a low creamy layer of off-white foam. Light sticky lacing, good retention.  Clean faintly nutty/toasty malt aromatics. Perhaps a very light grassy note from noble hops?  Bready (or rather, toasty) palate entry with layers of malt. Moderate, clean, hay-like bitterness leads into a pleasing rather dry finish.  Light-bodied, zesty mouthfeel.  A very good example of the style.

Smell carries a nice malt sweetness and good yeasty bread with a lovely spiciness and light leafy hop character. Taste is well balanced with a solid, bready malt core of caramel with a hint of molasses and caramel sweetness. Superbly balanced hop bitterness is an artful combination of florals and spicy but gentle Sazz like notes. Feel is crisp with mildly a carbonated, almost creamy touch. Light enough for sessioning but enough weight to satisfy with one. A great beer in total and one I enjoy again and again.

T: Spicy hops with sweet caramel malts, a bready toasty character also present. Slightly piney and florally, nice mild grassy hop bite, not overly complex but very solid.  M: Crisp, refeshing, light-medium bodied with good amount of prickly carbonation.  O: A tasty beer and always a solid choice when looking for a step up from a macro lager.

Balance between malt and hops are amazing and hit at the just the right time, neither being overpowering. Carbonation is spot on as well. This is definitely my year-round go to beer.

Nothing too extreme, but quite pleasant nonetheless. Taste is a smooth balance of light roasted malt, hop spice and lingering bitterness.

The head fades to leave a thin lacing around the glass. It had a malty smell that is hard to detect but easy to taste. The flavor is a mellow malt taste with slight alcohol. As it warms it becomes more complex and the hops are more noticeable. Mouthfeel is a little thin but with nice carbonation.

Spicy and earthy hop tones blend into some caramel and toasty malt aromas in the nose. Sweet malty flavors of caramel and a slight breadiness blend wonderfully into some slightly spicy hop flavors, very well balanced.

35,104,Buzzaldrin,3.42,"Just starting out with really trying to taste and enjoy real beers. Thought I'd try one of these, so I poured it into a pilsner.  At first, it had a nice sweet aroma and taste, but as I drank I started to feel more of its bitterness. The aftertaste left somewhat of a sour sensation in my mouth, could've been a bad brew maybe. However, the sour aftertaste was a minimal setback and this beer's sweetness stayed true.  I think it's a good start for starting to drink better beers, and that said, there are plenty of better beers out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BigOsoDaddy,4.3,"When reviewing a lager something to keep in mind is the fruity and complex flavors we look for in ales, whether they're IPA's, stouts, american pale ale, browns, ect. should not be present in a lager. Dunkel, helles, doppelbock, pils and schwarz are all lagers and therefore the most prominent feature in taste should be a clean malt profile; the trademark of a good lager. That being said...  Samuel Adam's Boston Lager pours with a decent two finger head (into a Samuel Adam's glass) and has brilliant clarity and substantial amount of carbonation. The color is a lovely amber/medium caramel and has good lacing.  Pretty mild on the nose but does have nice noble hop aroma and a pretty well defined sweet toasted malt aroma as well.  The beer is slightly sweet and has a great malty flavor with a slight toffee finish. A great session beer and it's availability makes it a great alternative to the BMC versions found everywhere. Highly recommended, especially if you know someone that is a novice when it comes to craft/specialty beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,magictacosinus,3.68,"Poured into a pilsner glass. About time I get to try this, too. It's most definitely an important classic in the craft beer world.  There's a nice little amber color, a fluffy head, and lots of carbonation. Simple and to the point. What wonderfully looking lager that this is.  The smell is delicious and refreshing. A sugary aroma, near tartiness, and filled with crisp cereal grains and tons of orange/citrus fruitiness underneath.  While the flavor is leaning towards the malty, grainy side, there's enough hops in here to hold long term interest for me. The yeasty flavor really clashes well with the clear and clean tasting flavors. While the carbonation can be a bit too much at times, it adds a kick that is fun and noticeable. I wish this were sweeter, but overall this is a nicely balanced beer that's easily a crowd pleaser.  While not my favorite lager (not sweet enough, as said earlier) this is still quite good. Definitely a staple that I wish others would follow in making good quality Euro lagers, and has remained this way for decades.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A nice finger of creamy looking head, that settled to a dusting. A bit of lacing too.  S) Malt dominates the nose with that initial whiff. A real pleasing sweetness, followed by light hops producing an aroma that is grassy and slightly floral.  T) Nice malty sweetness, bready, touch of caramel. This has a nice earthy quality. The hops presence blends in very well. Light grass, with a clean finish.  M) A medium body with not as much carbonation as I thought based upon appearance, but it is done right. This beer is both smooth and refreshing. Nothing wrong with the feel of this one.  O) Lagers kind of get overlooked a bit in my opinion. I myself am slightly guilty of this, so it's always a good idea to enjoy a classic craft brew, such as Boston Lager.

Plenty of persistent lacing on the glass.  Smell: Not a lot of aroma - bit of crisp grain/mail, with some German type aroma hops thrown in.  Taste: A bit of roasted malt up front and moving quickly into a hop bitterness. Much less malty than I remember.  Mouthfeel: Just south of fizzy - high carbonation. Some thickness underneath the carbonation.  Overall / Drinkability: I wonder....did the bar get this beer diluted? It doesn't seem up to snuff somehow. I seem to remember this beer as maltier when I've had it in the past, but maybe my palate has changed so much I'm tasting this quite differently than I remember. Not sure. I'll have to try it one more time at a place where I know I can rely up on the quality and see if the beer is different yet again.

Retention is very good, and the head leaves some lacing as it recedes.  S - Pilsner and crystal malts dominate. Caramel, light spice, and some vaguely earthy and grassy hops notes are present. Clean, but pretty simple.  T - Follows the nose closely, though the hops are definitely more pronounced. It's simple, built and balanced well, and decent quality.  M - Medium bodied, smooth and wet. Not really complimentary of the flavors.  D - It's always been a decent beer for me; one that's drinkable, fair quality, and fairly priced.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Hoppsbabo,3.75,"I work in Korea and I found a few slightly out of date bottles at my local Home Plus'uh'. I gather it's a mass produced lager from America because it's widely available here in Korea.  A: Light amber. Superb head retention.  T: Lovely hoppy bitterness. Floral and very spicey with lots of boiled honey and citrus, bit of malt. Eerily reminiscent of Oakham Ale's J.H.B., my favourite beer, but lacking dimension, more like a pale immitation. It's still complex, but I'm finding myself willing it to go further. Sweet but not sticky, robust enough to be complemented by a conical pint glass. Really hard to believe it's a lager. Good sustained aftertaste.  O: I was expecting it to taste like Bud or Millers so I was quite taken aback by its hoppiness, exactly the sort of profile I like in a cask ale. Not quite a world class beer, but as far as mass produced lagers go it's the dogs bollocks, very flavoursome. As a default beer this would definitely appeal to British ale drinkers. Would easily rival Guinness. I'll definitely drink more but on the whole, the flavour, although delicious, just doesn't go far enough for me though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pours out a standard amber color with good clarity and an impressive craggy two fingered white fluffy head which lasts for a minute but leaves behind nice loops of lacing. Has a total aroma spectrum of noble hopping: earthy, spicing, and herbal all represented in approximately equal amounts in both the nose and in the flavor alongside a lovely caramel malt, all with a smooth medium bodied texture that has the right amount of carbonation too keep things lively in the mouth without being overly distracting.

Smell is a bit grainy, some caramel and some America hops, Cascade I assume and some more herbal hop.  This is a nice lager, it has that standard lager taste, some grain some hops but with a little extra. A little darker malts and that typical American hop profile although I believe they also used some German/Czech hop as well.  Overall a very nice lager, downside is that it is quite rare and expensive.  Reviewed with the style in mind ofcourse, hench the high marks.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Clowerweb,4.05,"Served from 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date April.  A: Golden in color, slightly darker and richer hue than corn beers (not saying this is a corn beer, simply comparing colors). A finger of snow white head, fair retention, not a lot of lacing. Can see some active carbonation bubbles continuously floating up. Looks very clear, nice filtration, very clean.  S: Nose is malty, sweet, roasted caramel earthy malts and floral grassy hops. Slightly light on the aromatic scale, though certainly not unscented. You'll want to swirl this a bit to breathe it before getting the full whiff.  T: Immediately hits me with some decent IBUs, I'm getting rinds of grapefruit or orange, along with floral hops, some grass, and then on the mid palate it calms nicely as the roasty toasty malts come in to put the bitterness in check. Finishes dry with with a pleasant sweetness but not overly sweet. It's classy, it's not complex or thoroughly layered, but it has a nice balance and elegance. It's simplicity works in it's favor.  M: The mouthfeel is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this beer. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, right there on the border between medium and a little watery. Carbonation is a lot more moderate than what you'd think after seeing the active carbonation bubbles, it's not bad, but I wouldn't complain if they had upped it a tad. It also isn't leaving much of what I like to call a ""savor coating"".  D: Highly drinkable, very pleasant all-around, goes down smooth as silk, could have 6 or more in a session without much to complain about.  O: Overall, this is a great beer. It should have got an overall 4.0, but I docked half a point for the cost. It's on the expensive side, and for the price, I can think of better craft beers that are $2 or more cheaper for a case (there are also worse beers than this that cost more, so it's not that bad). I'd buy it again if it was on the shelf when none of those were available, but it wouldn't be my first pick among an assortment of craft.  I'm enjoying it though, very much so, and I'd recommend giving it a shot if you've never done so.

A little bit of hop smell as well.  Taste: Light but has some citrus notes. The hops work really well in this beer. They're there but certainly keeps the lightness of a lager.  Mouthfeel: Quite nice. Sits will with only a little too much carbonation. A slight lingering harsh bitterness but not too bad.  Overall: The best lager I've ever had for sure. Smooth with slightly more hops than other lagers I've had. Great as a standalone beer or as an everyday beer. For being so attainable this is a wonderful beer. The flavors play into each other very well.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It's very well balanced with the biscuity/bready and noble hop flavors. It's also super drinkable and has a taste that is truly unmatched.

Mouthfeel: Slightly round. A faint tingle on the tongue tip.  Overall: Decent beer for when you want a beer and aren't too fussed with what sort and aren't looking to think about it or remember it. If average is defined by the range of craft beers (it is for me) this is average. If average is macro territory, this is a bit above average.

The lack of a strong aroma is fairly consistent with most SA beers.  Taste - Caramel to start, a touch then follows through to a dry, slightly spicy, slightly grassy bitter-hop finish. Slight metallic twang in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Light. Carbonation is a tad on the low side, but it works with this lager.  Overall - A solid beer from Sam Adams that appeals to a wide array of beer drinkers. It's their most popular beer but not their best, IMO. Over the years, I've found I can get through 3 or 4 of these puppies before looking to bring a reliever into the game.

Some nice hop of aroma then comes in toward the end with mainly citrus but a small amount of floral as well.  Taste - Malty breadiness first meets the tongue followed quickly by a caramel like sweetness. A bit of hoppiness then comes in but seems to be subdued again my the malty-caramel sweetness that was first present.  Mouthfeel - For the style this is nearly spot on.

Sam Adams is interesting to me... some of their beers I find barely drinkable, and others like their flagship beer I think are just solid and decent all around. That being said, I think this beer in terms of appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel is a beer that was responsible for bringing people over to the craft beer side, and I can see why. It's got some hops, but it's not overly aggressive. It has some slight sweetness in the taste. It's well balanced. It is certainly more full then the common American Adjust Lager.

35,104,BottleOfPills,2.89,"Poured from a bottle into a glass... again as I said in a previous review of the Sam Adams ""Octoberfest"", the Samuel Adams brand isn't a favorite of mine.. So don't expect a glaring review. Much less a well educated one.  The Appearance is a good clover honey color.. with no taste of clover of course. My head didn't last long and dissipated pretty quickly.. (pretty par for the course in all honesty)  This lager smelled like an amber colored beer. I didn't get a wiff of any fruits or anything that would stand out and call notice. I should have smelled something shouldn't I? For that reason I'm going below average - I may have went too far but again, Sam Adams isn't a favorite.  Taste - I probably need to see what the date was on this variety pack, as the taste - well it taste like every other Samuel Adams Boston Lager I've ever had. Decent... not so hoppy, but yet way more flavor than my normal beers of choice.  Samuel Adams if anything for me has the ""mouthfeel"" down pat. All the beers of their's that I've had have a good solid crispness to them. I like that. It's what to me makes a cold beer refreshing... I've never jogged a mile and wanted a Guiness (sp) afterwards, but a cold crisp beer yes! I have wanted that.  Overall to me, it's average, it appears it wants to be something better than Budwieser - which I guess it is.. but the characteristics of it do not really distinguish it as something I'd brag about.

Who could resist-- it's not very bitter, but it does provide a painless education in hoppiness. A distinctive and reliable beer.

Bready in nature as well before giving way to a complimentary spicy profile from the hops and a moderate bitterness to balance.  MF - Lighter side of medium bodied, but bigger than its ABV suggests.

M - Medium bodied, fantastic carbonation with a chewy feel to it that lingers. Nice aftertaste of malted flavors and very sessionable.  O - Samuel Adams Boston Lager is a classic. I have a long history with this beer (it was my first legal beer and first craft beer) and it's always worth a revisit. It's not the most exciting or complex beer, but an old friend and a great standby whenever you're at a bar with limited craft options.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DrinkSlurm,3.6,"Poured from bottle into official sam adams pint glass. I, like many of you, have had this a million times....tap and botle. I have even been to the brewery in south boston.

Similar flavors in the taste: starts citrus-y, nice malt backbone, finishes clean and bitter. Light body, wish it were bigger and more creamy.  I keep forgetting this is a lager -- an impressive lager brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,KarlosT,4,"This is my go-to ""table beer"". Very well done, very consistent, a complex European flavor to the lager, with a nice balance of flavors with no off tastes.  It was at a micro-brew beer fest when I realized just how much I liked this beer. After trying 20 to 40 other beers, I found this to have the most refined flavor.  Not sure why, but I've found the bottle beer to be often better than the tap beer. This is the only beer I've found this to be the case (prefer bottle over tap). Often find some off flavors with the Sams Lager on tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ThisWangsChung,3.38,"#3 in the ""sure, why not?"" file, and #3 in the Sam Adams winter pack. Poured into a Kostritzer pilsener glass. (Seriously, why haven't I reviewed this yet?!)  A: Pours a dark amber/copper color with a one-finger soapy off-white head that doesn't have great retention. But it leaves quite a bit of soapy lacing on the edges of the glass. Carbonation bubbles are present if you look hard enough.  S: Main aroma is those earthy, dank Hallertau hops. I can also smell some of the amber malts if I really concentrate. Nothing earth-shattering.  T: Opens up with a toasty malt flavor, and ends with some grassy hops. Not the most complex or bold beer on the market by any stretch, but super easy to drink, and sufficiently satisfying on the palate.  M: Like you'd expect from a good lager; smooth, medium-light body, incredibly easy going down, and prickly carbonation that isn't overdone. The bubbles can catch up to you if you're not careful.  O: One of the best go to beers around. Sure, I'd pick a lot of other beers before this one, but consider this...I can walk a couple hundred feet to the local dive bar and pick up one of these for about a buck fifty. I can find it just about any place that serves liquor, and many times, this is the only other option apart from BMC, Corona, and *MAYBE* Heineken. While it's just 'good' overall, its versatile nature and superb sessionability make it ideal for luring BMC drinkers into the world of craft.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A: A clear clean copper, rather thin head, but it hangs around, and leaves some significant webs.  S: Not too strong but malt base with some citrus/sweet hop scent.  T: Bread crust with a hint of toffee, then a kiss of hops to clense the palate, incredibly balanced.  M: Great carbonation, a bit chewy, based on flavor heaviness really sessionable, but you'll have to burp once or twice.  O: Probably the most versitle beers ever, great for any season, any occasion, very sessionable, great balance, theres a reason its the real king of beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The smell is somewhat laid back but with malt and an earthy spice coming through.  The taste is extremely malty on the front and mid. Very bready with a lingering bitterness on the back.  Simple and amazing beer. I'm surprised I have not reviewed this before.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Left small amounts of lace on glass.  S- Sweet smelling, caramel malts mostly. Floral hop aroma towards the end of it.  T- Sweeter taste but good balance. Floral hops come through most. Maybe some citrus hop flavor as well. Bitterness is fairly mild as hops are cut into by sweet malts. Good balance and enjoyable.  M- Lighter body, moderate carbonation to it.  O- Not to shabby. Enjoyed 2 glasses of it.

Smell: Very aromatic smells delicious, with both carmel malt and floral hops with spice note coming through, nice...  Taste: Sweet malt and caramel, with hop good flavour. Just enough bitterness that has a spice bite to it. Some sweetness to the finish but finishes dry with a good hop presence...  Overall: A very well crafted beer!

Taste is a sort of fizzier lager. More malt than in an adjunct (duh). Pretty easy drinking, crisp but not bitter, malty but not heavy. Good balance.  Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, well textured. Not great, but not bad.  If this were the sort of beer I liked, I could see how this might become a go-to. Widely available, brewed by a macro brewer who still has significant roots in the craft scene. Hard to be outstanding in the style, but this is not bad, not bad at all.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,wvsabbath,4.1,"Serving type - Bottle  Appearance - Light golden tan/ brown, much like a american lager, 1/2 creamy head, some lacing.  Smell - Hops, some malts, kinda floral/grassy with some yeast aroma.  Taste - Had this many many times, first time sitting down to review. Lots of bitter crisp hops with a nice background. This must be a fresh bottle cause i dont remember this being quite this hoppy. The yeast adds that grassy flavor, and works well with the bold malts. Theres a little spice at the finish, but no alcohol flavor really.  Mouthfeel - Light and crisp, with a tounge bitterness from the hops. Malts help coat the bitter hops and balance this beer out. Aftertaste is light and not long lasting hop bitterness.  Overall - Very nice and easy drinker. Hoppy and malty, moreso then most lagers ive had. A great starter or evening sipper, or a great option if your at a bar and all they have is nasty macro beers on tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

L: amber with a nice head and nice lacing S: this is my standard rating as I don't seem to detect aromas as well as most of you T: Years ago when I first tried it I thought it was too bitter but now I love the nice bitterness it brings to the glass. A nice maltiness as well. F: Very good for a 5.0 ABV lager O: I prefer to get this in a can. I'm not sure why but it just tastes better to me when it is canned. Some have argued that it really isn't a Vienna lager. That may be because I'm not a fan of most of the Vienna lagers I try.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nice.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,tkelley,3.58,"Bottle from a winter mixer poured into a Perfect Pint Glass. Has a Best By date of March 2012.  Very pretty copper color with a thing white head. Thin layer sticks around the middle of the surface because of the laser etching. The bubbles rising up from the bottom are enthralling.  Started right out of the fridge with a distinct ""beer"" smell that reminded me of college - that isnt meant as a compliment, but it isnt a total dig either; it was a memory inducing smell. Sweet malty smell shows up as it warms a bit, nothing too strong. European grassy hops are evident and not overwhelming.  Tastes are not terribly different from the smell. Tasty sweet malted barley, European hops.  It has a nice smooth texture, but at the same time has good carbonation.  I love Sam Adams, even if I dont drink it as often as I used to. It reminds me of why I love beer, and particularly why I love BETTER beer.  Cheers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pours a bright orange copper color, perfect clarity and saturated tone. Creamy, fluffy head of foam at first that dwindles after 10 minutes or so. Plenty of lace in the glass, and a thin skim eventually.  Smells slightly sweet, toasty and biscuity. Vague fruity apple and pear notes slide in too.  Flavors are similar, some bready malt sweetness, fruity yeast. Feels a bit more full bodied than many lagers. Lingering toastiness with a slight floral hop note. Little to no hop bitterness present.

Poured from 12oz bottle dated best by February 2012 into a Samuel Adams pint glass:  A: Pours a light, burnished orange color with a translucent and effervescent body. Boasts a thick, half inch head that sticks around a while with an eggshell hue. Looks very refreshing and Boston Beer Company did a great job making the Perfect Pint feel like it was the handcrafted delivery vessel for the brew.  S: Subtle grassy notes up front, very crisp aromas easily lead you to the delicately refreshing profile underneath. Refined and inviting.  T: Light touches of grassy hops are the first thing to wash over the palate, brushing gentle strokes of flavors that marry the hops and slightly sweet malts with well executed balance. Finishes very clean with a light, sweet malt touch.  M: Great smooth consistency. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and very easy on the palate. Crisp and refreshing.  O: Always a faithful standby, there is a reason the Samuel Adams Boston lager is the flagship brew of Boston Beer Company. Widely available and infinitely drinkable, you can't go wrong with this beer wherever you are.

S: The caramel malt profile is prominent and inviting, but there is an earthy hop presence that sets this apart from most Vienna Lagers.  T: Again with the hops; they bitter and sharpen this already tasty beer and provide for a full, bright drink and a dry, crisp finish.  D: Great drinkability. Really, beers like this are the drinkability yardstick that I hold to other beers.  Overall: An American classic, and it earned it. Boston Lager, along with SNPA and a couple of other brews is, and always will be one of the quintessential ""entry-level"" and ""old favorite"" craft beers of me and many other drinkers.

This pours a nice amber color with nice foamy white held with good retention. The smells are of crisp floral hops and malts. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, crisp floral hops and a nice malts backbone.

35,104,ShanePB,3.81,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Sam Adams ""Perfect Pint"" glass.  A: Copper / amber colored body, completely clear with a fluffy thick two finger head. Dissipation wasn't as rapidly as expected, and left really nice sticky patches of lacing on the walls. A thin white retention ring coated the surface the entire time.  S: Floral and somewhat piney faint hop notes with rich, sweet caramel malts. Dry breads and husk towards the back end of the nose. Not a bad smelling beer by any means; nothing is off though perhaps it's about as aromatic as a lager could be?  T: Sweet caramel malts and pumpernickel bread is up front. Extremely minor hops do come through, a bit sappy and floral. Not really bitter at all, very smooth and balanced. This is a very approachable and easy flavor profile that I'd give to some ""new craft drinkers"" to try.  M: Active bubbly carbonation, loads of bubbles give a fizzy but somewhat creamy feel to the beer. Talk about an incredibly drinkable beer, this goes down entirely too easy and smoothly. Crisp, medium-bodied, damn good for the style.  I will gladly take a Boston Lager when I'm out at a bar or restaurant. It wouldn't necessarily be my first choice given other craft options; however I love that this beer is so widely available for a solid fallback.

There was quite a bit of little bubbles in this beer  Off the top I get a decent amount of grassy funk. This was much stronger than the typical lager.  The flavor is much stronger. I like the taste, and I don't typically enjoy lagers. There is a lot of grass, funk, and some bitterness.  I recommend this as a gateway beer for people drinking adjunct lagers that want to move on to something much, much better.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jhtipton,3.88,"Took me a while to actually write down my thoughts on this standard of American mainstream craft beer. Pours a deep golden 3/4 inch head into my chalice. Smell is inviting but not too overpowering. Malty but not too angry. The lacing urges me to take the beer and have my way with it. And I do. Nice firm malty backbone, slightly sassy, with a nice smack of hoppy bitterness. Not trying to prove anything with its medium body this lager has got what it takes to keep my attention. Definitely sessionable and overall my go to beer when the establishment I frequent cannot provide an exotic beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some decent lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for 5 minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - Malts, caramel, hops  Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and most of the taste is made up of caramel and malts mixed with light hops. There is also a very faint citrus taste going on. It ends with a caramel/brown sugar malty aftertaste.  Overall - Definitely one of the better options for draft beer at most restaurants in my area.

35,104,Pintofbrown,4.3,"Appearance- A very aggressive pour into a mug produces a roiling three finger off-white cap. It is very soapy and airy in nature. The retention is okay. It leaves a good Spackle of lace behind. The body is a really pale golden-amber with steady streams of carbonation.  Smell- There is a good amount of floral and herbal hoppiness to the nose. There's even a sweet malt character to it, very biscuit in nature.  Taste- Balance. I think that is the perfect word for this beer. Even served really cold, the sweet malt profile mixes with the floral hops and hop oil taste. It is hard to say which one comes first, but the hop bitterness is most pronounced in the finish and even comes off as a little spicy. What makes this beer really enjoyable is the biscuit malt backbone. That is a nice taste.  MF- This one is medium bodied and finishes relatively smooth. It is a good balance in the mouth feel department too. I am not sure you could do much more to have a great feel. Maybe a little more carbonation?  Overall- Honestly, I might agree with Jim Koch that this is the diaper dandy of the Samuel Adams line. It is a wonderful lager with great malt and hop balance.

The taste is much more pronounced than the smell with large amounts of hops of front that fades to a malty caramel before finishing with some hop bitterness. It is a very balanced beer.

Head sticks to the side of the glass very nicely, a very good looking beer.  Smell - Nothing too flashy here, just some bready malts that somehow allow for a nice smokiness and maybe a little lager yeast in the background  Taste - A little bitter bite up front followed my some caramel and toffee notes, probably from the malts. Lager yeast is the flavor that stays in my mouth while it gets washed down  Mouthfeel - Average, good carbonation  Overall - I haven't had one of these in years, in college i was quite fond of it, but now that my palate has changed this really isn't anything special. One of the better mass produced beers though obviously. I do give sam adams a lot of respect, especially for their variety packs that usually have 6 beers in them to allow novice drinkers a warm welcoming to try something new.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DaveBlack,3.8,"A: Light amber color, a full 2 1/2 fingers of white head with decent retention and leaves behind a fair bit of lacing in its wake.  S: A nice smelling beer. Toasty, biscuity malts and some hops at the finish. Smells sweet and delicious, if not overly complex.  T: The taste doesn't quite deliver what the nose promises, but it comes close. The taste starts off strong with the caramel malts and gives way into a hit of hop bitterness before the favor fades into a grainy aftertaste. Not bad, but the aftertaste is a little too reminiscent of some bad adjunct lagers.  M: Medium bodied, medium carbonation and dry going down.  O: Their flagship beer, obviously, it's really quite good. Very drinkable, and a crowd pleaser to be sure. A nice compromise between flavor and taste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,falloutsnow,3.91,"Purchased within a seasonal pack from Hyvee in Omaha, NE.  Poured into a standard US pint glass.  Pours a tall head, &gt;2cm, of off-white, medium-sized bubbles. Body is a light amber color with orange and yellow highlights. Transparent, with plenty of carbonation. Excellent lacing and head retention. This is a great looking lager.  Scent opens with malt sweetness and light lemon citrus, gradually transitioning to spicy and herbal hops in the nose, like a more intense oregano aroma. Good, but could be a bit more pronounced.  Taste opens with a constant caramel sweetness from the malt backbone alongside some hops featuring herbal and citrus characters. Fades out beginning with biscuit and grain flavors, dissolving to a general sweet character. As this beer warms, some spices come out in the late taste, particularly cinnamon. Aftertaste is of light sweetness, crisp bitterness and spiciness from hops.  Medium bodied with ample carbonation that does not overpower the body of the beer. Slightly watery, but nothing significant. Finish is semi-dry.  Overall, this is a solid lager and likely to be a staple to those who enjoy classic and subtle lagers in the German tradition. Highly drinkable and able to be enjoyed multiple times.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Mouthfeel: Crisp and tingly. A refreshing beer with a good malt hop balance. Leans to the malt beer side.  Overall: A satisfying product. Extremely sessionable lager that is ubiquitous in the US.

35,104,JerzDevl2000,4,"After all these years of reviewing beer on here, I finally came to the realization that I had never sat down with one of these since I joined this site. Sure enough, I finally got around to it today and like any good classic, this certainly passed the test of time. While Vienna Lagers aren't my favorite style, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would and amazingly, I worked my way through my pint glass pretty quickly!  Good pour to this with a bright almond hue, a great aroma, and just like Jim states in the commercial, a head thick enough that you can float a bottle cap on it. Not that I tried, but it was pretty sturdy until it dissipated. It didn't last long nor was the lacing much to behold, but the smell was repeated in the taste as the floral notes up front quietly gave way to a more caramel malty backbone. I could also detect a bit of orange peel and bread in the mouthfeel but everything meshed together so nicely and I was amazed at how full and balanced this was. Given that it was so long since I had one of these, it was refreshing to see how well this held up over the years.  Even though I only bought and had the one bottle during my session, this was weak enough in the alcohol department that I could have easily had two or three. I know that Lagers get a bad rap on here since they don't measure up to their stylistic opposites but this beer is as dark, complex, and enjoyable as most Ales on the market. It's not the best beer available on tap as might have been the case when this was new in the 80's but all beer lovers owe a debt of gratitude for the trailblazing role that this brew once had. It's just as good now and still deserves to be considered a classic!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A kind of dull profile, then lets up to some lighter grains. Followed by mild hops bitterness. Lots better than the first time I had it. Little to no aftertaste.  M- Not too light, not too heavy. Very balanced with the taste it gives you. Could have a few, but wouldn't want them all night.

S: A little bit of biscuit-like malt an just a hint of hop bitterness. This beer is pretty chilled though and that is most likely dampening the aroma quite a bit.  T: A rich biscuit flavor up front that quickly yields to a caramel sweetness with a quick snap of honey in the flavor. The end of the brew is nice and clean hops with a mild bitter.  M: The mouthfeel is pretty good on this beer and is very fitting. It is neither heavy nor light, and very easy drinking, just like the rest of the features of this brew.  O: Okay, I used to drink lots of Sam Adams years ago before so many other great breweries and beers were out there to choose from. Now with so much other great beer around and wonderful selections readily available, I don't drink near as much SA, but they still make good beer and it can be purchased in so many places.

A bit of a grassiness and subtle spices underlying the dominant aromas.  Not very complex at all, but mostly pleasant.  T: A nice balance between the the maltiness and hoppiness.  They battle for dominance, with the hops winning out in the end as they linger through the finish.  A nice bready maltiness and slightly caramel sweetness toward the front end that disappears to let the spices and hops come to the fore.  Considering what this beer is, it's really tasty and pretty well balanced.   M: Medium-bodied with lower than average carbonation.  Starts out slightly malty and sweet and then transitions to hoppy, leaving a nice drying effect on the mouth and tongue.   D: It's Boston Lager ... it goes down super easy.  I haven't had this in a while (probably 2 years), but it was nice to return to it again.

The flavor was little acidic and rather malty with a note of caramel at first and finished slightly bitter-sweet with a nice hop appeal at the end. The flavor lasted an average duration on the taste buds allowing you to enjoy the sweet hoppiness fully.  Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a lively carbonation.

35,104,AleEvangelist,3.11,"This is a solid, average beer. Given that it arrived in an era when decent beer wasn't a thought Americans ever had, it's held up well. Not a bad lawnmower beer, but nothing to write home about, either.  Appearance - A little lighter than I normally like to drink, still this beer looks fairly pretty in the glass. A light-colored head appears, maybe a finger's width, and stays around thinly throughout the enjoyment phase. (3.5)  Smell - This is an area where I'm definitely not impressed with this beer. Some hops, and little else. No malt, no overtones or undertones. Just some aromatic hops. Decent hops, sure, but not a ton of aroma to this beer. (2.5)  Taste - I was surprised when I took my first sip this evening. Almost some wheaty flavors. Definitely more hopping than you expect from a lager. Refreshing, certainly. A light-bodied, refreshing lawnmower beer. Some lingering sweetness on the finish makes you want to take another sip. (3.5)  Mouthfeel - More body than those ""other"" lagers available everywhere horse urine is sold, but that's not saying much. It's definitely on the thinner side of craft beer, but it's definitely not the wateriest beer on the planet. If it were too heavy, it would not be good at all either, so it's pretty much what I expected. (3.0)  Overall - As I've said before, this beer is refreshing, light, and sold pretty much everywhere, so you're guaranteed to be able to lay hands on it. When Jim Koch started making this beer, the craft brew revolution was still in its infancy. Mr. Koch bucked the trends and got this beer to the thirsty masses, and the rest was history.

Bready, biscuity malts dominate and a slight herbal hop twang comes in near the finish and tries to balance it out, but to me seems to come up a little short.

For quite some time I was willing to ignore how hopelessly out of style it is (it is virtually devoid of maltiness so how it can be considered a Vienna lager is beyond me) but now that this whole 'craft thing' has grown an extra head, various appendages and a couple of spleens it just comes across as rather tired. Sort of like Brooklyn Lager. Yes, it smells fairly pleasant and flowery, looks pretty nice, gives some pretty good head and lacing but there's not enough on the palate to really add to that backbone and lubricate your loins.

35,104,elNopalero,3.85,"The beer that started it all? Not quite, but definitely one of the granddaddies of the craft beer movement, for better and for worse. I last drank the Boston Lager years ago, long before I became interested in craft beers. [Insert ‘it was better back then before they grew super huge and distributed all over the place’ statements here.] Since that time I had other Sam Adams brews but pretty much dismissed their flagship beer. This spring, however, I took a chance on a sampler pack and found the Boston Lager to be surprisingly solid. So with that in mind I picked up the autumn seasonal sampler. On to the beer!  Poured from a bottle into a 12 ounce mason jar. A vigorous pour resulted in a nice amount of foam that dies down and produces a thin layer of bubbles and residue. The beer is a warm golden-amber color, like autumn leaves. Consistent and clear. There’s a sweet maltiness to the nose, not so much hops as malt. This bears out on the palate as well. The carbonation is there, and there’s a bit of caramel that hits at first, then returns in the finish. Very soft, balanced, and inviting. I am feeling kinda like the guy who stopped listening to his favorite band because it became too popular right about now.

For a while, this was all that I drank when I went out to restaurants and such. For how much of this goes out, its a pretty decent beer.  Appearance: Clear copper body with cap of white foam.  Smell: Well, to be honest its pretty average. I get some grain, some caramel-like notes, and a really strange scent that I often get from beers that are trying to be English. Light malts as well.  Taste: Slightly above average, but, there is something going on here that is worth talking about. Starts with a caramel malt. Furthermore, a noble hops middle that is finished with a funky sweetness that I cannot quite put my finger on.  Overall: Hey, if I'm in a place that only has macro lagers, this is probably what I'm getting unless they have Sierra Nevada. Its a great entry level brew that isn't necessarily craft, but it is definitely a crossover into getting beer drinkers to see that one-dimensional macro lagers cheat them out of respecting their beer. :-) However, is it just me or has it gotten progressively worse as Sam Adams has produced progressively more year to year?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,CraftBeerTastic,3.47,Ba Review #51 Served On: 9/2/2011 Glassware: Pint Glass  This is such a staple beer for me; I figured it’s about time to review it. This particular bottle actually came in the 2011 Sam Adams Harvest mixed pack.  Look: Poured a very clear copper with some carbonation bubbles floating up. Head was a nice thick 2 fingers of eggshell colored foam.  Smell: Sweet malts mixed with a hop spiciness. Also that typical Sam Adams malty twang that all their beers seem to have.  Taste: First on the palate was a nice spice mixed with sweet malts and a slight sour note. A hop bitterness hit more towards the end with a finish of the sweet bready malts and that sour note. The bitter hops seemed to make up the aftertaste.  This is certainly a complex lager. I would say it’s right in line with something like a Blue Point Toasted Lager.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

M: Medium, crisp-ish and faintly dry.  O: One of the best flagship beers out there. I never used to like it and I think my palate has changed a lot over the years.

35,104,bobhits,3.09,"I know I have a review written for this somewhere, but I can't have this as a Sam Adams without a review!  Pours a clear moderately light amber color. Very solid head, retention, and lacing given the relatively light body and low abv. There is even a bit of carbonation to add a bit of flare to it. For Sam Adams this is pretty high praise!  English hops give off a touch of grass, funk, and just that english aromas. The malt balance is rather one dimensional giving off just a sweetness with perhaps a hint of caramel.  The flavor here is wonderfully complex. A mix of caramel, english grassy hops, some english citrus (almost rusty notes), and a lot of subtle (in a good way) spices. I'm not a huge fan of the english flavors but they work for Sam Adams.  A bit over carbonated, but I like the medium body in a lighter beer.  Boston Lager is sadly the best choice at far too many places. I say this as Sierra is a far better ""best choice"" but Sam Adams has really gotten their name out. I will say this is by far their flag ship and is better than most of their other options. A great beer? Oh god, FAR from it, but I'm always happy to have one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,BradtheGreat7,3.33,"12 oz brown bottle. I borrowed a Sam Adams 'sensory' glass for my latest review. I also had one in one of my standard mugs. Honestly the speciality glass is cool, but I couldnt tell a difference. Some brews I can with the ""proper branded"" glass, but not this. A - Light Amber to golden. Thick, creamy head. I could describe the head as off white or even light tan. S - Very floral aroma. A good bit of malt notes. Not sure what hops are used, but they are there as well. T - It's a hearty and rich flavor. Sweet malts, but the hint of caramel sticks out. I could taste a pretty good hop flavor toward the finish. The taste of this brew reminds me of a flower garden almost. Idk.. maybe I'm crazy lol. It's actually not bad. M - Somewhat medium bodied brew. Well.. It's close anyhow. Is a little better than average carbonation. O - Okay, I first reviewed this brew a few years back with pen and paper. But I wanted to try the sensory glass and review it again. Overall this brew isnt bad. It's not great either. IMHO the sensory glass looks great, but gave me the same experience as the mug. I've always been back and forth with Sam Adams brews. However, this is an average brew. If you are into this style and want something with a speciality glass get the Sam Adams. If you want a great brew in this style get the GLBC Eliot Ness. We dont have tons of options here in town, but everywhere I go that has Boston Lager 6 packs also carry GLBC Eliot Ness. Both are considered Vienna style lagers, both are around the same price. Dont get me wrong, Boston lager is a better than decent beer, but the GLBC is world class for the vienna style. IMO that is.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle.  Taste - malty with delicious floral notes. Light citrus bites at the tongue. A light note of sweetened caramel as well.  Mouth feel and overall - Much better than the last time I remember having it. I must have gotten a skunked brew on my last tasting.

It is a good go-to reliable beer in a place with limited choices.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,anglagard1,3.35,"Served in a Sam Adams glass. The Noble Hops dominate the aroma in a not very pleasant way. The hops bite in the smell reminds me a bit of bug spray. Thankfully, this does not apply to the taste. There's a faint noble hops taste with a little malt sweetness, and not a whole lot else. Mouthfeel is exceptional. I could see sessioning with this, but it really doesn't stand out tastewise.

35,104,Jugs_McGhee,3,"Served on-tap in Las Vegas. Reviewed from notes.  A: One finger head of slight cream, fair thickness, and poor retention. A clear amber-copper colour. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Average.  Sm: Some hops. Caramelized malt and barley. A mild strength aroma.  T: An empty open (and an empty third act as well). A full barley foundation features light floral hops and prominet caramel - on the climax. The malts are nicely sweet but lack depth of flavour. Balanced but lackluster. There's so much more that could be done.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Somewhat complementary of the flavour. A bit overcarbonated. Decent thickness.  Dr: Easy to drink. A good American macro (yes, Sam Adams is a macrobrewery - albeit a craft brewery, but nothing special. Well priced.

C  *** 02/28/21 bottle from a 12-pack. 5% ABV. 30 IBUs. 175 kCal/12 fl oz.  Served cold.  I get a signature caramel sweetness with a fleeting scintilla of dark cherries...it's a robust malty taste I consider Boston Lager's signature and I do think it's instantly recognizable to those of us who grew up drinking Boston Beer Co.  Medium dry on the palate with an apt medium-bodied mouthfeel.  The Hallertau hops don't bring any obvious grassiness to this malt-driven brew.  A bit overcarbonated, sure, but it makes the beer crisp if not even refreshing.  Drinkable but robust for a 5% ABV lager. It's a better brew than I remembered, and I do miss the days when Boston Beer Co.'s variety boxes were more inspired.  C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ChrisCage,3.95,"A- Pours a golden color with just a hint of reddish hue around the edges, and reasonably clear...slightly chill hazed. The head doesn't start out super impressive, being maybe a half finger in thickness, but the retention is superb, virtually staying in the same puffy layer as long as the beer is in the glass. There looks to be ample amounts of carbonation, although they look to be finely producing. The lacing is decent, but not great....good looking overall!  S- A very nice balance overall, with sweet, fruit like esters upfront from the roasted malt, followed by grainy caramel and finally ending with a slight hop bitterness, but it isn't very pronounced.  T- The hop profile is much more noticeable, but it doesn't dominate the flavors. Again, very balanced and I find in reverse order....I detect the bitterness more on the front, with the middle showing more malty sweetness, and a bit of toasty biscuit flavor on the finish. Quite yummy!  M- Light bodied, but leaning ever so slightly to the medium part of the spectrum. The carbonation is creamy, just like it appeared to be, and really allows the flavor profile to shine through  O- This is a very nicely flavored, smooth, and very easy to drink beer. The flavor lingers well on the palate after the swallow, leaving a rich and fulfilling satisfaction. This is a really good everyday beer and would work well in any situation, plus I think this would could be enjoyed by anyone!

Taste is a great balance between noble hops and bready, earthy malt with a touch of caramel sweetness. Body seems a bit light, with a hint of metallic/mineral notes in the finish. Carbonation is good, and the finish is of spicy herbal hops and dry malt.  Great tasting beer that I could drink in large quantities. The aftertaste is refreshing and invites you to have another.

Forms a large head of white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding. Aroma of sweet golden malt accompanied by fruity hops. Notes of citrus and diacetyl.  Tastes of golden malt with a pleasing aromatic hop flavour. Notes of caramel, citrus, mild stewed hops and diacetyl. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, leaving the palate slightly dry. Faint aftertaste of hoppy malt.  A great lager - very drinkable. It has an aromatic hop character that puts industrial lagers to shame. The only negative is the pervasive hint of diacetyl in the background, which spoils an otherwise fantastic beer.

Crisp, refreshing taste, malty upfront with intermittent hop bitterness coming through and subtle sweetness in the finish. A very good lager, and has all the makings of probably one of the best sessions beer. Perfect on a nice, hot sunny day.

Some film on the sides that stayed throughout the beer.  Smelled hops, malts and a distant spice (maybe pepper?) Slight sweet smell in there, too.  Initial taste was malts, kind of a dark fruit. The taste then turned slightly bitter. The aftertaste was bitter and light citrus. The combined flavor stayed on my tongue for quite some time.  Good mouthfeel - clean, crisp, balanced and smooth.

It's what really got me into craft and a solid offering at most places that carry only bmc. It sure is a looked with a nice amber color and fluffy two finger head. Smell is very floral and inviting. Nice malt profile up front with a subtle hop flavor that comes around after a while. Mouth on it is almost perfect for the style and is velvety smooth all the way down.

35,104,jondeelee,3.88,"Boasts a subtle flowery hops aroma, with malty notes that promise nice sugars.  On the tongue, there are immediate fruity, floral notes that ring out (due to the malt, mainly), replete with notes of apricots and rosewater, as well as grapefruit. These fade mid-stream to make way for more bitter flavors, the grapefruity hops coming on especially strong here, accompanied by hints of pine. The aftertaste is also dominated by these bitter flavors, along with Grape Nuts cereal-like grains.  Overall, this is an eminently drinkable, finely-balanced beer in many ways: first, it finds a nice ratio of hops to malt, skimping on neither but also neither letting the flavors get out of hand; and second, it manages to find a nice middle-ground in the larger panoply of beers, easily staying away from the water-like qualities of, say, Anheuser-Busch, but avoiding the harsher, polarizing palates of, say, Unibroue. Yes, there are those who think Samuel Adams doesn't make anything decent, but there *is* a reason why their beers ""have won more awards than any beer in history"" (as per their website).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Malt smells sweet w/o a lot of distinction other than a hint of Grape Nuts. This sample is the first where I detect an estery component that seems a little out of place. Can't call it a flaw though. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and a bit to the beer's determent. A tad more body would be perfect. Still not bad.

S - Hmm, there are some nice sweet honey-esc malts and light floral hops. Behind that though I'm getting a strong metallic finish. Unpleasant.  T - The metal is gone. More of those sweet malts and super light floral hops. Mostly malts though with a light bitter finish.  M - Good mouthfeel. Nice cabonation and slightly bitter with a light dry finish.

M - Crisper than I thought it would be. Lighter bodied with a moderate carbonation. Carbonation seems to disappear towards the end of the beer...odd.  O - I really don't like admitting I enjoy anything from Sam Adams, as they have kind of gotten too big and too old for my tastes. BUT, this is a solid offering from them.

I get soapy hops, a floral tone and a caramel-honey sweetness with a buttery note.  Very crisp and again the taste has a soapy note to it. Sweet, syrupy malt flavour with a tasted tone to it. Has a definite dryness and a hint of lemon or grapefruit zest.  Medium-bodied with a medium carbonation. A bit yeasty on the tongue, but otherwise has a nice tangy pop to it. Tad thick and oily in the aftertaste, but quite drinkable.  Well, after not having it for a few years I still like it a lot. Definitely too expensive to be a regular over more local options, but it was a great option when I had no idea what I wanted.

Fluffy off-white head, big and little bubbles snuggling up with each other. Very good head retention and lacing.  Smell is light and crisp. Some buttery toasted malts, some clean mildly fruity hops. It's all pretty faint, but crisp and refreshing.  Taste is hoppier than I expected based on the smell. First wave of flavor is bready toasted malts; not much sweetness here, just the fullness that grains bring. Second wave is a twang of bitterness, with the tiniest hint of fruit. But in general, it's pretty two-dimensional. And those two dimensions are the predicted ones. Nothing special, nor particularly impressive in the dimensions it does have.  Mouthfeel is nice - light-bodied, carbonation is spot-on. Finish is a little too long, IMO, and kinda watery.  An okay lager. Not great, not bad.

The hoppy aftertaste lingers, which I'd normally like but I find it a little off-putting in this beer. I'm not dissing this beer, but the aftertaste reduces the drinkability for me.

Might be me, but it's something I keep coming across whenever I try their beers. *shrug*  Taste is average: beginning with a toasted malt bready character with a thin, peppery spiciness to follow. Tiny amount of caramel sweetness throughout the profile, too. Finish is a dry, white bready coating on the palate. Not much else; simply straight-forward in flavors.  Mouthfeel is crisp like a pilsner, but not as carbonated. Alcohol is not noticeable, as expected. Decent beer, but not necessarily a personal favorite.

S: Traditional lager yeast with it's signature light fruity characters (hints of a sour green apple, mashed banana), crisp pale malt, malt sweetness, some faint spices possibly?

The aroma starts out great but fades rather quickly  T: Brief malt opening, followed rather quickly by hop spiciness, that transitions into some lovely earth tones and minor lingering bitterness.  M: You can tell it's beer and not piss water.  O: It's pretty well balanced albeit a little on the hoppy side of things.

I guess there is a reason this beer has won a number of awards, well done Jim Koch and the Boston Beer Co. no wonder this is your groups flag ship.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Leaves great lacing. Smells faintly of some hops and overall mild on the nose. Taste is a little sharp and very refreshing.  This is a staple lager - awesome beer - great to have at a bar with limited taps.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,AmericanGothic,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Peace Tree pint.  A: Pours a clear, pale orange with one finger of off-white head. Good retention and lace.  S: Hay and sweet malt.  T: Bit of caramel up front, slowly fades to a dry biscuit malt finish. Simple but tasty. As the beer warms, the alcohol asserts itself a bit more on the finish.  M: Light, well carbonated, smooth and creamy.  O: This was a pretty nice beer. Thirst-quenching, straightforward and uncomplicated. Would definitely buy this again, especially for a warm summer day.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Stocean1,3.5,Sampled this again over the week-end. Poured a nice fluffy head with decent retention with a light amber color. Sweet malt with some hops balancing it out. A little bready with some fruit notes. Medium carbonation and light to medium bodied. A decent offering and sessionable for me although I am not a lager fan.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,suspect,3.91,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass. Left over from a night of poker so I figured I'd review it!  A: Pours a light amber/deep gold color. Mildly aggressive pour leads to a 2.5 finger white fluffy head that lingers on and on.  S: Toasted malts lead the way with subtle hop backbone. Not a lot on the nose but it's certainly not offensive. It's got a mild sweet smell to it too.  T: Very nice toasted barley with added hops and sweet malt combine to make one of the more tasty vienna style lagers around.  M: Sticky, yet subtle mouthfeel. Light body with ample carbonation.  O: Probably the easiest drinking craft beer I've had next to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I have and will continue to drink this on a very regular basis.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S: Aroma is faint with some malty grains, some lingering sweetness like molasses or sugar. Not very exciting.  T/M: Taste is mildly hoppy accompanied by some bitterness, low to medium carbonation, and very slight hints of light fruits, perhaps grapefruits or lemon.  Compared to every other beer in the world, it’s not much of a contender, but considering that a lot of people see this beer as the transition from mass market adjunct mainstream ""big beer"" to the world of diverse and creative microbrews, this is a commendable effort. Regardless, Sam Adams has a much deeper portfolio.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Taste was cereal grains, yeasty, something that played at hops, and overall completely non-descript and generally weak. Overall this is a completely middling offering. Drinkable certainly, if you have nothing better to do and some on hand.

35,104,socon67,3.83,"I've had many of these over the years. Finally getting around to a review.  A - Pours amber in color; not cloudy at all. Noticeable carbonation. Slight lacing that is just made for a pint glass.  S - Smells sweet of malt and sugar. Some telltale scents of fruit as well.  T - The reason SA is just a solid beer is that the flavor has a few compoenents. Starts off with a robust maltiness that gives way to a sweet flavor of berries. The finish has a slight bitter bite. None of the tastes are particularly potent but the balance and simplicity just work.  M - A perfect session beer. Not heavy, bit doesn't feel watery either. A great middle of the road lager.  O - Sure, craft brewers including BBC have made other mroe exciting lagers. This is still a good beer that got many into enjoying quality beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeerdedEric,3.03,"Golden body color. Head was there but faded into a film. Not a bad looking beer, the lacing is nice; it stayed with the beer as I drank it and saves this from a average looking brew.  Not much of a smell, I get a grainy aroma and some fruits. Not much else going on.  Bland hops, grain, bread, cereal and yeast. Really weak flavors and I'm not a big fan of it.  Light body, carbonation is there. It does feel okay in the mouth and is easy going down.  I have tried this in the past and I can't get into it. I've tried approaching this beer again, hoping it will change my mind.

Some foamy retention as well. A simple solid amber color, textbook color, with some rising carbonation but clear as a whistle.  Bouquet. Kind of basic but off putting to a degree. Strange sweetness with malt, a mild orange/grapefruit wet juicyness sense too. Kind of odd but no major complaints so I'll score that down the middle.  Taste malty, like a simple bock, with some mild hop grapefruit character. Hint of fizzy carbonation, but nothing serious, but also some body to this beer, could be better with some malt backbone more prominent.

35,104,CorbinB,3.75,"I've had Boston Lager several times before, more than I can count actually. I've always enjoyed it but never felt to write a review now until reading a few of the others on here.  I had this on draft at Paesano's in San Antonio. It poured nicely with a half-inch head that falls into about 1/8 inch that lingers for the entirety of this drinking. The color here is a pale amber.  The smell I get is predominantly malty sweetness without much depth but it's very pleasant and much better than nearly any lager I've had.  This beer is one of the more balanced brews that you can find in such wide availability. The notes here are slightly toasted malts with a smooth hop bitterness that is pronounced but not at all overpowering. There's a slight sweetness that nicely balances this bitterness. The beer itself feels slippery and bubbly to the tongue and not heavy at all. The result is a very drinkable beer that is tasty enough as to not be boring.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The aroma is malty with a bready yeast character. Sweet, with caramel and floral hops.  A nice and refreshing light-medium body. Immediately malty and sweet with caramel up front. It quickly gives way to an oily, floral hop flavor that is more bitter than the aroma suggested. It finishes spicy, a bit dry, and lots of grain in the aftertaste.  It's a very good lager that is both malty and filled with hop flavor.

35,104,vader,3,"I first want to start out by saying that many great beer companies put out much better product and don't pump their advertisement every couple of minutes because...they don't need to, the product sells it self. I maybe a bit bias on this review because I had been putting off trying it for so long. But you can only go to your local store so many times and buy the greats before you need to branch out. After feeling a little bold I picked up a sixer with my buddy. This brew pours clear amber color(let me quickly say that it looks darker on tv haha), small bit of froth, no lacing. Smells sweet, malty. I taste some caramel in the body, sweet and simple, but balanced just like the commercials say. In the mouth it feels like a bit like soda...Not bad for what it is, but it is way over priced.

They poured off a little of the head, but there was still a good inch left when I got it, properly suspended on the upper rim of the SA glass. Lacing for a lager was quite good. It's a great looking beer.  Smell wise this beer has lots of great hops, along with a nice biscuit malt backbone.  Taste wise this beer was a hugely delicious way to spend a three hour layover. Hops are so smooth yet crisp, balanced with a great bready and caramel malts, and a bit of a nutty flavor too.  Feel wise it's crisp, light, and delicious. Bitterness lingers nicely.

35,104,BarryMFBurton,2.78,"Here we go: the flagship creation of the largest craft brewery in America. I’ve heard this called piss-water, a great introduction to craft, a favorite go-to, and everything in between. I’ll admit, though, I’ve been avoiding it, since there have been so many other beers that I’ve really wanted to try. In this situation, at Southport, IN’s Cheeseburger in Paradise, it was the only real craft available. Here’s my first test of this famous brew:  A: Amber, clear, shining. The head is creamy with just the slightest bit of retention. Some lacing is better than none, I guess (even if it is a sad, stringy grouping of bubbles).  S: I’m sorry, but this is a big turn-off for me when it comes to beer: the lack of a nose. There’s the tiniest bit of hops, so I guess the statement “no nose” is not totally accurate (but it might as well be).  T: Decent hops bite up front, thankfully. Not overly bitter, but refreshing. Alas, familiar BMC-style wheaty blends overcome the good start. This transitions the palate into something more stale. Dark yeast is robust but old, with a hint of malts. Aftertaste is very slight, but crisp. Not bad, not great.  M: Extremely bright – this one’s very bubbly. Effervescence is appropriate for the style.  O: A flagship, a star, a staple in the craft world. I don’t really like it, though. It may be the #1 offering of the #1 craft brewery in the country, but then again, the #1 beer in America is Bud Light. I’ll stick to my guns and leave this as something of a last-resort go-to, as I know it will almost always be available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It almost tastes more like an Altbier vs Vienna lager but regardless I’m perfectly fine with the re-formulation. I’ll keep my same score as well.  2011 review (Original recipe) Haven't had the original lager in many years. Got 2 in a summer sampler pack. Even after all the craft beers and crazy hopped IPAs I've had recently, this beer is still a good go to lager with enough flavor to satify most of the BAs.

Pours a nice reddish-orange color with a white head that dissipates to some nice lacing.  Nothing too special in the smell, malt and yeast seem to be the main things I can detect.  Starts a bit sweet, can taste some malt, and a little fruity. There is also a bit of pepper in there, and ends with a fairly large hop bite. Maybe a touch of caramel in there as well.  Solid feel, helped by a decent amount of carbonation.  Not a bad beer, the only thing keeping me from rating it higher is the amount of hops, I prefer a little less hops is my beer.

35,104,Roke87,3.64,"12 oz. bottle, slightly chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip. Best before Sept.2011  Appearance-Pours a nice clear golden amber colour with a two finger nice fluffy white head that very slowly dissipates to an equally fluffy ring leaving average lacing throughout the glass.  Smell- Is rather lacking, although I do get some nice malts right away matched with some sweet caramel flavours, a hint of fruity goodness in there, with a tiny hint of hops thrown way in the back there, you really have to search to find it. I also get almost a mild aspirin smell to it? I find typical to macro lagers.  Taste- Really comes through well, definitely more than the average lager in the taste department, you do get the bready malts again right off the bat paired with a nice sweet but fruity taste in there as well, the hops come through a bit more on the palate but are not over dominating in any way.  Mouthfeel- Definitely a medium bodied lager, I found the bottle I enjoyed had amazing carbonation, lots of action going on in the glass; maybe it had to do with the glass type itself? Did finish a little on the dry side though.  Overall- A very quality lager from Samuel Adams, being my first offering from them I was very pleasantly surprised, I was expecting it to be just like any other macro beer out there. Although I had my doubts once I got a first whiff of it but the taste very quickly changed that and out did my expectations, miles above and beyond your average macro lager, definitely worth a try happy I tried this one to be honest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,EricCioe,3.75,"This pours medium amber with a two finger white head with pretty good retention leaving some nice lace on the way down. On the nose there are some light floral notes, maybe from the hops but perhaps with the yeast contributing a bit. This is probably the origin of Sam Adams house nose and taste, but it works fine here. There is a good deal of biscuity malt that forms the basis of the beer. In the mouth the dry malt provides a bed for the floral aroma to sit on. There might be a little hint of citrus, but it's pretty far back. The only part of the finish that really lingers for any real time is the floral note, a nice one to finish on, but it's too bubbly for my tastes.  Overall, this is a nice beer that would be a little better for me if it were less bubbly. In that department it resembles a Bud Light or something that claims drinkability but ruins it with gas-inducing bubbles. If that were cut down, you'd have a very good beer in my mind.

Caramel and biscuity malt. A touch of bitterness at the end.  M: Creamy but a bit low on the carbonation (but maybe that's the plastic cup...)

35,104,Rschis16,3.88,"Well first of all I'd just like to say this is the beer that started it all for me. I used to think this beer was so hoppy when I first tried it, but that was before I really got into craft beers. I almost didn't like this beer back then, but I kept drinking it and eventually fell in love with it. Since those days, my taste buds have matured immensly, but this is the beer that I owe it all to. A classic in the beer world.  So for appearance (in my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass of course), its a slightly hazy gold, almost orange color with a smaller but fluffy white head on top. Decent retention and lacing. It smells lightly of hops and some sweeter malts. Solid.  The taste is hoppier than most lagers, but not enough to stray from the style, nor turn away those not quite accustomed to hops. Some slightly toasty malts round out the flavor and put a nice bow on the whole experience. There's a lightness and refreshing quality to the mouthfeel and the crispness of the hops, but it still remains full-bodied and pleasant. Best when fresh, of course, but great for any season. It's just one of those great beers that got so many people into beer that has quality ingredients and better taste than most macros, despite how big BBC gets. This is certainly one of my go-to beers still, and unless the recipe changes dramatically, it will most likely remain so.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Citrus. Maybe a bit of grapefruit. Actually damn good for a vienna lager.  Taste - Immediate alcohol. Plenty of bitterness in the body with a sweet finish. Slightly metallic. Probably due to being near the freshness cut-off.  Mouthfeel - Good amount of body. Feels a little heavy due to lack of body carbonation.

35,104,UpNorthLager,4.12,"I recently learned about the special Sam Adams glasses - I highly recommend them. The aroma of the Boston Lager is excellent, a rich, full beer experience - which makes the flavor taste more full. The mouthfeel is great - a crisp effervescence escapes on the tongue with each drink. The color shines in the classic amber hue.

Mouthfeel: quite thick, sort of hugs my tongue, almost no fizz, the way I prefer it.  Taste: rather dark and malty, no surprise there, with as much hops as can be expected with the colour. Not my first choice, but far from unpleasant.

T: Similar to the smell, malty and spicey, but there is also something a bit more complex. There is kind of a smokey flavor in my opinion, tasty brew, but Samuel Adams Seasonal offering are a notch better in my opinion.  M: Pretty crisp carbonation, any more and I think most people would think it is too carbonated. I could use a bit more bubbles though. Medium Bodied.  O: This beer is a classic, and don't get me wrong, it is a great beer, but I prefer the SA seasonals over the Boston Lager any day of the week.

Smell is varied and interesting, a mix of floral hops and earthy scents prevail. The taste follows the smell,I definitely pick up on some biscuit malt used and a nice mixture of spices. The body supports the flavor profile outstandingly and makes this a great beer all around, in my opinion. Very drinkable beer all things considered.

35,104,deleted_user_574223,4.35,Having spent the weekend camping just around Boston with my son we spent Saturday in Chrlestown and the surrounding area. Nothing like Boston in springtime. Even to a New Yorker. Well after drinking from a canteen the past couple of days I decided it would be sacrilege to not have a Samuel Adams Boston Lager while in Boston. I have to say it was very nice and refreshing.  The beer poured a rich gold to copper with a pearly head and mild lacing. The nose was of floral hops and some underlying malt. The taste was very fresh and crisp on the palate and very different from bottles of Sam that I have had. The floral hops started the palate experience that slowly faded and was nicely balanced by the mild maltiness. This brew finished very nicely. The mouthfeel was crisp and refrehing. Overall I am aware that after drnking water over the past couple of days of hiking and camping this beer deficately had an advantage but can you really go wrong with a Samuel Adamas Boston Lager. All hail JK! Enjoy!!!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,thebrood1987,4.5,I just had this on tap last night after usually always having it in the bottle. The tastes come out more even if you get a real fresh bottle it still tastes somewhat different on tap so I decided to give a review. It had that floral hop oil smell that you usually get from Samuel Adams plus some roasted bready malt in the back of the smell. The taste is just like this with that citric hop bite and ending with a strong bready roasted malt mixing with that hop oil floral bitterness.  The biggest difference between bottle and tap with this beer is that the roasted bready malt comes out a bit more richer than usual and the hops of course are bit brighter and citric in taste and bitterness. The drinkability is awesome on this and the alcohol content is just right plus its hidden real well with the sweetness and malt profile. This is probably one of my favorite malt profiles in any beer. I've tried quite a bit craft beers and this one is still an amazing example.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smell: Toasted and sweet caramel-scented malts with light hops.  Taste: Toasted maltiness dominates first, but then the hops with a mild citrusy bitterness come forward in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Light-medium body; crisp; medium carbonation.  A nice step up from other widely available macro-brews, but not as good IMO as such Sam Adams products as the Noble Pils.

The golden straw transitions to orange as it nears the thick cream coloured 2 fingers of head. I get alot of spice on the nose and some herbal, grassy and pepper flavours.

Overall - What can you say about a beer that's sold thousands upon thousands of barrels? Is Boston Lager real, true, pure craft beer? Maybe, maybe not. I initially didn't like it at all when I first had it 10 or so years ago. But it's grown on me a lot over the years.

Its not a go to for me, mostly because of how much there is out there, but at least I know that if I see it in a bar, I can have something I will enjoy.

35,104,Sudsy89,3.88,"12oz. bottle, chilled.  Pours an amber-color, has a foamy white head that lasts for a while and leaves lacing. A very pretty lager, has a high level of carbonation.  Tastes hopppier than most lagers, actually has real beer taste as opposed to an adjunct lager. Nicely balanced, like the Noble Pils it manages to combine a good amount of hops with the underlying malt flavor.  Has a more medium-bodied mouthfeel, yet is still very drinkable at under 5% abv, and refreshing when served cold. A great example of what a German-style lager can be, and a good intro to craft beer for many drinkers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T- The spicy hops are definitely there with notes of clove, ginger, cinnamon, and its backed up with that light sweet malt.  M- Light in body and medium in carbonation, this is a light and refreshing lager that goes down easy.  D- Very drinkable, enough substance to bring me back for more, but light and refreshing enough that this could be an all day every day drinker.

Particularly ribs. When I eat ribs, there is nothing I would rather have to drink than an ice cold sam adams boston lager on tap.

All in all, and per the style, one of my favorite beers to ogle over.  A pleasant combination of some hops and an earthy malt in the forefront. This beer smells particularly bready. An inviting and welcoming aroma.  A bready and malty beer with a good amount of hop bitterness. The focus though is the bready malt character while the hops just add a small punch of bitterness. Balanced and very enjoyable.  A thin to medium mouthfeel, which makes for easy drinking. The flavor lingers a bit, which is nice.  A very good beer available everywhere bad beer is served.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I am a fan of many Sam beers, and many other micro brews for that matter, however I always find myself coming back to Boston Lager as my foundation beer.  Pours wonderfully straight down the glass giving it a solid head that will create mild rings in the glass as you drink it.  Really nice and unique flavor at first taste. Some brews are close in flavor in their respective categories, however this always taste new to me each time I drink it...I rated the taste as exceptional because it truly is.

This is honestly the best I could find.  On tap at the home turf sports bar.  A - The beer arrived in a large pilsner glass with a one finger head. The color is a nice orange hue with a foamy white color head.  S - I'm mostly picking up some light malts, a hint of wheat and some very light hop presence. Nothing big happening here, but it's also not as offensive as other lagers I normally avoid like the plague.  T - I should warn you that this is my least favorite style, but this is actually a very decent beer. It has a very nice, light hop flavor that I rarely taste in most lagers. The malts are also masterfully implemented here as well. Some nice spice present as well, I think it coriander.  M - Nice medium light mouthfeel with some really good carbonation. Slightly spiky, yet refreshing.  O - This beer surprised me if you couldn't tell. I've become such a snob that i have passed this up in the past.

Smells like lightly roasted malts--caramel and nutty aromas.  Taste is those malt flavors, mildly sweet, with some European hop flavors over the top the whole way. The malts make the flavor robust enough, the hops keep it interesting and make it finish crisp.  Feels clean, crisp and lager-like on the mouth.

I LOVE the smell of this beer  Taste: A perfect bitter, hoppy taste, with a slight malted taste I can't quite put my finger on. I pick up a roasted taste as well as I'm drinking,  Mouthfeel: A nice full beer, but still within a lager catergory  Drinkability: I would drink this beer anytime, but a hearty meal would probably go really well with this.

Seems that they would improve the drinking experience of any beer actually.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TheBrewo,3.9,"We pour a brew of bright, honey orange. It produces a slowly growing one and a half finger head of thick white bubbles. Thick lacing clings around the glass as it recedes. There is clear translucency, and no sediment is noted. Carbonation looks to be moderately active. The aroma strikes a nice balance between malts and sweet hops. There is a drying oatiness to the malts, which blend with some fruitiness, of apricot. The hops are sweet and tannin-like, with some faint citrus poking around the sides. As we sip, malts and subdued spice hit up front. These are reminiscent of wintertime, bittering and peppery. Through the middle the flavors wash cleanly through, with the malts gasping their last breath before the hops swoop in, bitterly, to take us into the finish. Here, the hops take on a citrusy vibe, cleansing the palate on their way down in a lemony swipe. The aftertaste breathes of partially bitter hops, earthiness, speckles of booze, and a clean, but faint, citrus. The body is medium, with the carbonation following suit. The feel to the mouth is creamy, and very smooth. The carbonation contributes to the bubbly froth of each sip, but the liquid is otherwise on its way to being silky. The mouth is left dry, with that bittering hop. The abv is standard and the beer drinks with ease.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how hop-forward it was, and its soft texture. Perhaps it is because we are on a slight hop dry streak, but the most noticeable component of the aroma, and essentially into the taste, was the hops. While this is no doubt intentional, it was a nice surprise. As for the feel, each sip went down with ease, coating the mouth just the right amount, while leaving it dry at the very end. It was soft, and inviting, and makes for a nice sessionable brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Color was a clear reddish-amber with moderate carbonation.  AROMA: I noticed a pleasant, moderate earthy toasted barley smell with a light grassy overlay.  TASTE: Taste pretty much followed smell. A moderate toasted barley taste supplemented with a light grassy overlay and just a bit of alcohol taste.  MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a light body with a thin texture, moderate carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Initial flavor was a light sweetness with a slightly bitter accent. The finishing flavor was of moderate sweetness with a light dry bitter ending. Finish lasted for a moderate amount of time. Body lacing was virtually nonexistent and what there was dissipated quickly.  DRINKABILITY: a good alternative to ""industrial"" beer for social occasions.

Served in a Weisse-vase, it's an amber-gold color with a nice, thick white foamy head that slowly recedes as the beer sits. A malty aroma with the slightest hint of hops on deeper inspection. The beer gives you a malty-caramel sweet flavor with very slightly bitter hops right behind it for balance, and also a slightly peppery characteristic at the end.

Toffee, caramel, bread and a nice punch of noble hops.  T - I really enjoy Boston Lager. It is very well balanced. The sweetness of the caramel malt is complimented perfectly by the noble hops. Couldn't ask for much better. One of the better Vienna Lagers in my opinion.  M - Rich and creamy yet refreshing.  D - If I am in the mood for an ""everday"" beer, this is usually it.

35,104,NickMunford,3.5,"Boston Lager, to me, is the quintessential, American ""beer"". It looks, smells and tastes like what I think of when I hear that word. I'm not saying it the best beer in America, but just that it's what I think of as a stereotypical beer. That's also not saying anything of the styles European origins.  A: Pours a light amber color with a frothy head. It has little head retention, but leaves good lacing.  S: It has a light, sweet, malty aroma with a hint of caramel.  T: It has the same light, sweet, malty, caramel flavor, as evident in the nose, with a subtle hint of hops.  M: Feels light and bubbly in the mouth, and leaves only the slightest bitter aftertaste from the hops.  D: This is an extremely drinkable beer.

35,104,Bouleboubier,3.78,"Eh, why not? Drinking this beer I've had many a time from my trusty Euro pint. Will it do it justice? Well....  Wow, it's tawny! Not too many (American) beers sport quite that particular shade. The cottony white foam is right in-line for a lager. Excellent webs of lace. Clean filtered.  Surprising grain-husky aroma I never noticed (wrong glass!). Actually some faint noble hops in there as well - just for decoration. Base malts - strong, bread-crusty.  Dry-toast(ed) grain flavor dominates. Man, is it dry! I think it's this glass (g.d. nucleation!). Drinks clean and quick but definitely has more body than the average American light lager. This ain't, however, a light lager. Maybe only traces of honeyish sweetness - squelched by the bitter from the grain? Hops?! It's crisp and dry for the Drinkin', no doubt. Most of the sweetness seems to be left in that aftertaste. Um... it touches on the Vienna Lager style. Too dry really.  I must admit, it is a darn drinkable beer. Very universally enjoyable - meaning I bet it would appeal to a wide variety of tastes. Oh, well I understood what I meant. And not the best glass, no.  EDIT: tried it again the next day in a glass stein and, yes, the constant nucleation activity (bubbles) from the other glass did make this a much drier drink. Definitely now getting at least a moderate sweet malt sweetness to this beer that gives much support to the very barleycorn predominance of flavor. Hops still play a spicy role in rounding out the flavor. Taste up to 4.0 from 3.5.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GregBlatz,4.67,"A - Copper and very clear. Head is white and laces beautifully.  S - Slightly metallic, sweet and earthy.  T - Smooth, sweet. Specialty grains lend a caramel like taste. Hops are present and account for a lot more of the flavor than you would expect for a lager. Earthy hops and sweet grain balanced by a clean finish.  M - Creamy and full. Medium carbonation.  D - One after another without end.  Overall - This is one of my all time favorites. I don't love all of Sam Adams offerings, but the majority of them are good. This one is absolutely excellent. Glad almost every bar and restaurant on earth carries it. The beer has a deceptive complexity to it. Depending on the meal or the mood, I can taste different characteristics. Drink one at cellar temperatures, or even better, drink one at room temperature. You will be surprised at how robust this beer really is.

It is made up of tiny off-white bubbles. These bubbles are constantly being replenished by armies of replacements rising through the glass.  S - The aroma is earthy noble hops followed by caramel malty notes. Not much else for complexity, but there is a butterscotch-like note in the end.  T - The first taste is an earthy hop flavor. This is followed by some biscuity, caramel malt. The overall taste impression is earthiness, almost like mushrooms. The finish is very dry and the aftertaste is a little floral.  M - The body is light to moderate. There is a definite carbonation tingle. There is a moderate amount of hops bitterness. No alcohol detectable.

35,104,robnews,4.47,"Poured from a bottled into a Guiness pint glass.  Nice dark amber color with thick white head. Beer is very clear. Head receded nicely to a fine lace with substantial lacing stuck on the side of my glass.  Great smell of hops, cascade I think. Really nice aroma. I love the Garrison IPA which uses a similar hop. Not a strong smell in this beer, but present. lower carbonation levels yet still refreshing.  Really nice caramel flavor with light hops. Very nice. Malty flavor and mouthfeel with dry aftertaste. I had this beer a while back, but I really enjoy it a lot more this time around. Excellent brew. I love this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JLeege,3.41,"Appearance- Pours a clear golden color with a fluffy two finger bone white head. Good retention and lacing, looks great.  Smell- Not a lot going on, caramel malt, some light hopping.  Taste- Fairly smooth, caramel and bready malt start things off, leading into some light piney sided hops. Not much depth or complexity, pretty simple, but a nice 'easy' flavor.  Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation, as expected.  Overall- Simple non offensive beer. One of the better crossover beers to the craft world, but not much too more once you graduate beyond it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,malty,4.15,"Wow, I can't believe I haven't ever formally reviewed this beer. This one came from a variety twelve pack, along with Scotch Ale, Noble Pils, White Ale, Revolutionary Ale and something else. Best before Feb '11 notched on back. Maybe this came from the winter seasonal case I got from Sam's Club back in October, which contained the Choc. Bock?  Pours into it's proprietary Sam Adams scientific glass a perfectly clear russet-copper color with a stellar loose white 1/4"" settled head. A perfect sticky microdot film remains where the 2"" head stood 5 minutes ago. A nice amount of carbonation erupts from the base of the glass. Nice long drips and smatterings of lace like a Pollack painting.  For a Vienna lager, this baby has got some hop poppity-pop resonance in the nose. Balanced caramely malts counterweigh the tantalizing herbal hop homage. Very fresh, crisp and classic.  Clean, clean, clean offering of zesty hops greet the palate with a gentle handshake. The semi-savory malt backbone keeps things seamless and friendly. No bait and switch from nose to taste, just a perfect translation that's satisfying and consistent.  Mouthfeel is between light and medium with a prickly and perfectly carbonated presence. There's a little bitterness in the finish with a slight toffee tapering.  Drinkability is fantastic. Can't take nothing away from this beer in this department.  This beer has to be in the top 10 gateway beers to 'craft' beer geekery. I still will choose this over 90% of the 'usual' pseudo-craft beers in most restaurants, (ie Blue Moon, Amber Bock, etc.) The hops really shine and and are delightful to savor with the toasty pale malts. Some may call this 'basic' or maybe even 'bland', but I call it a craft beer clinic in consistency and balance. After 15 years or more, it still tastes great.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BaronRogue,4.4,"Okay, so BA says this is a Vienna Lager, eh? Well im guessing im a fan of vienna lagers because for me, lagers dont get much better than this style.  Anyway...  Beautiful golden color as i pour it into my chalice, decent head and decent lacing.  Smell is nice and crisp, malt and hop in equal measure.  To me, the taste is amazing. If you're looking for a well balanced beer, this is it. The malts and hops dance in harmony, and really mix around on your tongue like they're there for you to love on. Doesn't get any better than that for me, this lager has an amazing taste. After a few of them it starts to taste like some sort of wonderful nectar.  Mouthfeel is standard, full for a lager and quite nice.  Could drink these til the cows come home. I've had it on tap and it's even better, but if you catch a bottle before the date notched on the bottle, its gonna be enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SebD,3.98,"Appearance: : It has a nice amber/golden and cloudy colour to it. It has a nice off white head that dies down moderatly and also has nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of hops, sweet malts with caramely and fruity notes.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a nice sweetness coming from the malts but ending with more of a bitterness from the hops. You can also taste hints of caramel with a slight fruitiness at the end.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a very nice balance of hops and malts.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DavidLindley,3.78,"Here goes the first review: Poured from a 12 oz. standard bottle into my brand new Sam Adams Glass. Had to christen it with the beer that it was made for. Appearance: Really nice golden color, the glass, as advertised, does a really nice job of retaining head. The constant carbonation made by the lazer etched rings is really nice. Smell: Nice hop aroma coming from the glass, not overwhelming, just a very pleasant smell. Taste: As the smell indicated, there is a nice taste of hops as well as some malts. A really nice balanced taste that leaves me wanting more. Mouthfeel: Great mouthfeel, great carbonation. It feels really balanced. Drinkability: This is really really smooth, I really enjoyed drinking this. Definitely makes for a solid session beer and I could easily put a bunch of these downs in a night.  Overall, I really really enjoyed this. The glass probably helped, as it really livened the beer with the constant carbonation but I will definitely be drinking more of these. Not surprised, Sam Adams always pleases me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,rdpoint,3.45,"Color is a nice soft gold, with almost no head.  Smell is clean and crisp, no over powering scents  Taste is nice and balanced, no one thing standing out, what you would expect from this beer, very well balanced.  I've always expected a little more carbonation from this beer every time I have it and I'm always surprised by how little it has, but overall good.

35,104,AlexanderSelby,3,"I am torn on this brew. First off, I always have noticed some very unpleasant smell from this beer and wasn't able to pin it down until today. I was bottling my homebrew this afternoon and cleaning out my fermenter and naturally got the trub (muddy, gross fermentation by-product) everywhere. Now smelling this beer again, I think trub is the smell I'm getting: a muddy, old, armpit aroma. It kind of smells like a Budwiser. I get no hop lovin' and the sweetness is a little stale.  The taste is a very different story, but not all together a revival. A very smooth drinking brew, with caramel-like malt flavors in the spotlight. Herbal, almost Italian seasoning flavored, hops spruce things up throughout. No doubt a balanced taste and smooth finish. Light, yet noticeable, bitter hop bite helps to dry out the finish. But all flavor is whisked away from your senses a bit too quickly and slightly under the radar.  I would almost like to try this recipe with an ale yeast to ""dirty"" things up a touch and fill in the gaps. The clean drinking lager vibe almost works against it, in my opinion. Also, I most definitely prefer this brew in a bottle, because it needs a good carbonation level to give it that pop. Overall, I never have liked this beer that much and don't think I ever will.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DrewKid4,4.07,"I've had many times on bottle and on tap.  A: Pours a golden straw colors with slight hints of red hues. Half inch white head which dissipates rather quickly and nice lacing.  S: Hops and caramel.  T: Toasty from the heavier malts used while balanced perfectly by the perfect amount of hops.  M: Very balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness from the hops. Sticks to the tongue for a while.  D: Being fro New England, this is my session beer. If there aren't any pitcher or PBR sales, this is the one I fall back on. Never had a bad time with the Boston Lager and is the most consistent of Sam Adams' brews.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Kinsman,3.95,"Not really sure why I'm reviewing a beer I've had a thousand times before, but I've got time so why not?  Clear looking cooper color with some lighter golden orange hues mixed in. Ecru would best describe the color of the head which was just shy of 2 fingers thick to start and faded to leave a lace which was stickier than I remember.  First whiff and I'm not sure I've noticed such a strong hop aroma before on a Boston Lager. Maybe it's because I'm not usually paying this much attention to the beer, but this is reminding me of why I love the German hops so much. Some maltiness is there but I would say that this fresh bottle of Boston Lager is relatively hop forward.  Taste is a bit more balanced than the aroma, with the nice malty sweetness Jim Koch always talks about in the ads making a nice showing. Still, the Hallertau provide their wonderful earthy spiciness that makes this such a well balanced beer.  Mouthfeel is crisp with a moderate body giving it plenty of umph. Overall, what else can be said about Sam Adams Boston Lager? It is a true American classic that I will always gladly have as a nice refreshing lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,masstransplant,4.27,"Sam Adams Boston Lager was my very first experience with a micro-brewed beer. At first smell, sight and taste, in the enlisted club at Westover Air Force Base somewhere back in the early 90's, I was completely blown away and will never forget the experience....completeley unexpected and utterly delighted. Since that time I've religiously avoided mass produced beer of all types and haven't looked back. So fair warning....there's some nostalgia working to bolster my rating here.  Dark copper appearance with a thick, creamy head. Smells quite pleasantly of malt and hops...really has a smell of it's own that I will constantly use as a base of reference. Balanced taste, easy to drink, and utterly reliable as a go-to beer all across the country.  Not sure what's changed since the early 90's, or how a micro-brewery is able to keep the wal-mart shelves stocked, but the beer is still reliable. I find that it often the only viable choice at many restaurants.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Held up with the smell of wheat.  T- Very balanced with spicy notes coming on the back end from the hops. This enhances the wheat found in the body. Sweet on the front end. The acid makes your mouth water.  M- Very fleeting with a spicy citrus bitter finish.

35,104,chicagoabbot,3.35,"12 oz into a snifter...first let me say that value is a relationship between price and quality.  Decent color for a lager...head isn't huge, but adequate...nothing to rave about in the appearance, but it's not going to stand out on appearance either if you put it in a row of beers.  Smell is slightly ""lagery"" but it doesn't have that deep lager yeast funk that I expect from a great lager and is one of the defining characteristics of the style. Some malt and hops in the nose, but nothing that stands out as exceptional.  I will say that it's fairly clean on the tongue, but it doesn't have that crisp lager bite as much as the top example of this style. Nothing offensive, I'll give them that much, but nothing that shines like a star either.  Mouthfeel is fine, but not too crisp. Goes down pretty easy.  Would I buy this beer all the time if it were twelve bucks a case like Miller? Maybe not. Well, I'd buy it every time I had to bring beer to a party anyway. But when this brew is priced a buck cheaper than a great micro lager or classic German example of the style? Nah, I won't be buying this again. Consider that it's more expensive than Sierra Nevada's Pale...which is a very different beer but an excellent example of its respective style...in the eight bucks a sixer range, a brew ought to kick butt...this kicks the butt of the adjunct lagers but fails in any serious lager comparison.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I poured a little too enthusiastically and ended up with a huge frothy head. The retention is pretty good too though. Color is reminiscent of topaz.  Overall a pretty clean smell, with a slight lager yeast fruitiness and some bready malts making up the majority of the aroma.  Taste is similar to the smell, mainly bready malts, some caramel/crystal malts in the middle, and carbonation bite and fruity esters at the finish.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, but I think the aggressive pour threw off my carbonation a bit.  I should buy this one more often.

Mouthfeel: A little bit watery for a lager, but still has a touch of creaminess. The hops and alcohol provide a bite but don't create excessive dryness.  Drinkability: The best beer available at your local Applebee's, and one of the most important craft beers in America. I've pounded my share of Sam Adams at airports across the nation.

35,104,MadeInOregon,3.74,"Ah, Boston Lager, the legendary macro microbrew. It's hard to believe I've only had this like twice before. Judging by the number of reviews (2000+), mine certainly is going to count for much. But this is more for my documentation than anything else since I highly doubt this review will even be read and won't do much to overall scoring!  So then...the Boston Lager has a mountainous near-white head of foam and lacing galore when poured out of the standard brown 12oz. longneck bottle. I'm actually surprised how nice this looks in a glass. The body is an amber color and is seriously crystal clear. I mean, gravenstein apple juice looks fuller than this!  Smells like hops, a tiny bit of bready malt, and that sour sharpness that lagers always have. Pretty straight forward and standard.  The taste is straw-like with a little oily hops and some spicyness. It's even a tiny bit yeasty. It is slightly syrupy as well, which is appropriate for a Vienna lager. Taste is surprisingly good!  The body is light and crisp and is very representative of the style, in my opinion.  Overall, Samual Adams' Boston Lager is pretty well-balanced and is very drinkable--especially for a lager. It's weaknesses are that it is slightly too dry and not quite sweet enough for this style. I'm used to Vienna lagers being a tad sweeter, but this is still quite good and is absolutely more deserving than Bud to be called ""The Great American Lager"".",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,r3o,4.15,"I just enjoyed 2 bottles of this one, and is as good as I recalled it, a well rounded beer. A: nice clear amber color, kind of red, thick head with some lacing S: hops take the front row, with some floral presence T: very well built, with malt sweetness up front and some bitterness in the aftertaste M: smooth and thick, plenty of carbonation D: definitely would have it again, it's usually the best choice in restaurants/bars that are not beer oriented.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hophead1901,3.4,"Has an amber color with two to three fingers of head. Good lacing. Hints of caramel and has a slight hopiness. Very drinkable any time of day or year.  Doesn't exactly blow my sox off, but i'll take it any day over anything more mainstream.

35,104,Lauthaha,3.4,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer glass.  Appearance: Beer is a rich, golden hue with very heavy carbonation visible. Head is super thick, frothy and eggshell-white. Lacing as the head slowly recedes is minimal, but present.  Smell: Medium-strength floral hops supplemented subtly by mildly sweet malt character. A touch of coriander and/or citrus zest. Also a certain herbal flair that is unique to Vienna Lagers.  Taste: Very hoppy for the style, a lot of flowery flavor. Bitterness prevails here. Lots of citrus. Not what I expected, but certainly drinkable.  Mouthfeel: Slight buttery feeling as the beer enters. The supposedly heavy carbonation is lacking, but works well enough to distribute flavor. Finishes mostly clean, save for the bitterness which sticks around.  Drinkability: Only slightly above average.  This isn't a bad beer, but I don't think I would go out of my way to pick it up.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

First sip is a mix of malty sweetness with a subtle level of hops that really gives it a kick without making it too overpowering. As a beer, this is one of the more balanced in terms of overall mouthfeel, making it one of the easier drinking than some of the more extreme choices that are out there.  Sam Adam beers were the first craft beers that I ever had, and this one is a fine example of what they are capable of. Very nice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Ok aroma, with some muted malts and vague hops.  Similar taste but better than the smell. Nothing unpleasant there, just not a lot going on. Sorta like me after 10 of these things.

Grainy and malty, with just a bit of sweetness and some faint grassy hops. Not the least bit complex, but clean and balanced. Smells has some faint reminders of the macro lagers I used to fetch for my dad...  Pretty much like the nose. Faint grassy hops, grainy, and almost sweet malty. Perfectly balanced, or close to it. Not alot going on but the synergy is good. It is far from offensive, which is more than I can say for most domestic lagers.  Easy drinking, decent tasting. Well made.

S-I detected a faintly sweet breadiness, with a touch of fruity hops.  T-The beginning had a creamy sweetness followed quickly by a floral bite that trailed off with a hint of yeast.  M- Lightly medium body with a little grainy feel to it.  D-Nice body to this vienna lager with enough hop bite to hold up to hearty fare.

The smell is of hops, some grains and a grassy smell. The taste is some hops followed by a grassy and floral taste with some grains, caramel, and more hops at the end. The aftertaste is a dry hop finish. The mouthfeel is a nice crisp clean feeling and the decent carbonation and smooth medium body makes it a nice go to beer. A must try for all beer lovers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GossageBrewery,3.98,"This Vienna style Lager came from a 12 oz bottle and was poured into a standard pint glass. It was very clear with a thick, white, foamy head. The Head retention was good and leaves beautiful foamy rings with every sip. That is how you know it is good beer! The beer smells of malt and grain and it has a slight hint of hop smell. The beer starts off malty, moves to sweet and finish's dry as you swallow. The dryness leaves you wanting to take another sip! This Vienna Lager has some hop bitterness which is more then I can say for most lagers. This is a lager that is very drinkable yet has some character. It knocks the socks off of anything that AB, Miller or Coors are brewing. I would like to think that this is how a lager brewed in America should taste. Way to go Boston Brewing!

I can taste caramel, toffee, slight amount of hops; slightly roasty. Not really too much going on, it is what it is. Well carbonated, finishes smooth. Although this beer can be boring at time, drinkability is pretty good, mostly due to low abv.

Smell - I can smell malts and caramel. Beer hasa real clean smell to it. There is also a hint of earthy/grassy tones, but you gotta go looking for it.  Taste - right away i could taste the malts with some caramel. The caramel has a deeper taste then smell. The aftertaste lingers around for a bit too, very nice tasting beer.  Mouthfeel - Lot of added carbonation gives this beer a thick feeling in my mouth. The added carbonation makes the caramel more bitter as well brings the grassy tones forward.

Respectable lacing, which bumped it from a 3.5 to a 4.  So hard to describe the smell of lagers. This one is slightly hoppy, and I think the hops are overriding any malts that might be present.  Little hop bight up front, with some malty sweetness following through. At the very end, I get a metallic twang that I have come to expect from my experience with Sam Adams.  Feels like its getting stuck in my throat. Thicker than a lager needs to be. I'd prefer something a little crisper.

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (part of the Winter Classic pack) into a pint glass... it's a deeper gold than a macro lager, bubbly with a frothy white head.  The smell is light and malt dominate, also some grass notes in there and a decent hop presence.  The taste is bolder than the smell, hoppier up front with the malts coming through more at the end.

Mouthfeel - Smooth up to a good spiced and hoppy finish. Bitter after taste.  Drinkability - I'll say it again, I love the hoppyness of the beer.

T - Hops wonderfully balanced with a bready malt finish. Very solid to say the least.  M - Creamy and wonderful. Medium body with the perfect amount of carbonation.

35,104,mklinger,3.91,"Pours a brilliantly clear bronze color with a half inch of wite, dense head that leaves lots of lacing behind in the glass.  Aroma is dominated by noble hops with herbal and slightly flowery and medicinal scents. Just a touch of malt sweetness to balance out the hop aromas.  Some rich, bready, slightly sweet malt to start things off followed quickly by hop flavors that mirror the aroma -- herbal & slightly flowery (though nothing medicinal in the taste). This is listed as a Vienna lager and it does have some of the malt characteristics of a Vienna lager, but the taste is dominated by pilsener hop characteristics. Lots of noble hop flavors. Some sharpness from high carbonation with a lasting sense of bitterness that lingers quite a while after the otherwise extremely clean finish.  This is a quenching, refreshing beer which has plenty of rich malt flavor without seeming cloying of heavy in any way. Nice, bright high carbonation.

Taste: Surpisingly more sweetness than bitterness. Clear malt characteristics, but with well balanced hops for a bitter background taste.  Mouthfeel: Optimim carbonation for a lager. Warming, perhaps a little bit too much biterness in the aftertaste for me. But this is a lager, so you would expect that so I'm not going to know any point off.  Drinkability: Very refreshing, enough interest in the interaction of hops and malt to want to keep going back to the glass.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

There is a decent maltiness which gives this brew a mildly sweet, and somewhat bready and lightly grainy feel.  Medium to more carbonation, starts of a true lager, mid is malts finishes with some hop character & malts. There is a hint of that crispness of good lager hops, that give this brew a nice smooth feel.  Drinks great for a lager, its not over the top or heavy like some lagers.

Poured a 1 finger head, though I was being pretty careful, and after 3 minutes there is still a 1/2 inch of foam on top. Head is very dense and the carbonation coming from the bottom is significant.  Very hoppy for the style; nose is thick with bready hops and a tangy, tart acedylaldihyde/green apple aroma. I also get that sulfu that others have picked up on and I'm curious as to the yeast strain used in this brew. Also a little toasty sweetness in the way back thanks to the malts.  Super hops! Man, I forgot how hoppy this beer is. As my girlfriend describes it, ""this is the beeriest beer I've ever tasted."" Does have that Euro-hop taste with a bucketload of sulphur. Strong bitterness in the finish. Malts are delicate and delicious, but play second fiddle to the hops.  Not watery, but not syrupy. A fine feel and refreshingly, aggressively carbonated.  They must water down the ones you get at the bars because I don't remember the Boston Lager tasting so hoppy on draft. Maybe something to do with bottles and kegs...I don't know. Too hoppy for the style, which might be fine if the hop profile was different, but still the best macro out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Toasty sweet caramel is sandwiched(literally has a bread/malt flavor) between some nice citrus/earthy hops.  In Mass if I sadly end up at a chain restaurant or a place I don't know.

T - Nice balance, starts sweet and finishes bitter.  M - Doesn't dry the mouth, but also doesn't coat it. Carbonation in the mouthfeel is minimal, finishes very clean. Aftertaste is a bit sweet.  D - Goes down smooth. Not a lot of alcohol in this beer, but it would be easy to sit down and a couple in quick succession.  Overall - It's BBC's flagship beer and perhaps the most recognizable craft beer in the country. I've been drinking it for years, but never reviewed it before. What is there to say? BBC provides in Boston Lager a solid, drinkable beer.

One of the best looking beer I've see.  S: First thing I notice are a mix of hops: floral, grassy and piny hops. Then, there are some multi grain bread like malts with biscuit malts. Maybe some unsweetened oranges (like the ones used in marmelades) and light honey. Not very strong.  T: Some dry malts come upfront. Toasted multi grain bread is what I get the most with very light biscuit malts. Strong tastes of floral and grassy hops (which makes a weird mix) with a little bit of piny hops. Still the unsweet oranges seems to be there as well as light honey. There is also a good amounts of minerals in the water. Quite dry.  M: quite bigger feel than expected.

It's not too pronounced, but I'd say they were a little piney. I needed to reallly concentrate to figure that. It was a little cold though.  T: This was actually better than I thought. I hadn't had SA Boston Lager in a while, but this was not dull at all. Nice malitness and hop balance, but maybe a little hop forward (for a lager).  M: Light to medium body, with some carbonation. Some dryness.  D: Went down pretty well as a session drink.

35,104,FeDUBBELFIST,3.73,"Bottle to pint glass.  A: Pours with a one finger tall, foamy off-white head with decent retention which settles in to an everlasting film. The body is magnificently clear, medium copper orange in color. Lacing is well above average.  S & T: The aroma and flavors are muted right out of the gate, but really open up with 15 minutes of warming. Toasted malts of caramel and toffee. Resiny hop aromas mixed with a grassy/herbal scent. A light earthiness is provided by the yeast. Mildly bitter with metallic notes on the finish. Throughout the drink, the aroma score elevates from a 3 to a 4 and the flavor from 3.5 to 4.5, landing in the middle on both accounts for its final rating.  M: The mouthfeel, on the other hand, starts out great (4.5) but drops off (to a 3.5) in the same amount of time it took to find the sweet spot of the aroma and flavor. Full body per the style with a semi-thick texture and a big, lively carbonation that dwindles rapidly.

Has a big malty bill initially, sweetness takes over, ends with a tea like and leafy hop presence to curtail the sweetness.  Basic mouthfeel, not overly wet, medium bodied.

T- All of the above just with more total kick to it. I also get a good amount of hops with citrus zest, grassy and earthy notes. Some kind of lemon/grapefruit note as well. Biscuit toasty malt, floral.  MF- Light body with a nice creamy feel to it and higher-end carbonation. Certainly a bit bitter on the back end.  DB- Drinkable and refreshing.

Smell: The most obvious smell was a floral or piney smell, in a way kind of clean and refreshing. maybe earthy is the right word... In any case, an aroma that was not strong but beckons tasting.  Taste: I noticed first the carbonation, which caused a good tingling sensation(I know this is not technically 'taste' but seems pertinent), and within it a faint roasted flavor. As it warmed in the mouth, the flavor of the hops came through and the taste fits the aroma. Once that finishes, the after-taste is of roasted malt that fills the mouth making this beer seem bigger than it is.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and definitely not heavy , but the strength of taste gives the impression of a bigger beer.  Drinkability: Great beer for either enjoying one slowly or drinking multiple times in an evening. I could (and have) gladly put down a six-pack of these in a session.  Notes: One of my favorite beers, and a go-to beer. Typically even better on draft.

The flavor is likewise hop-forward, but still reasonable balanced by a robust malt backbone. The mouthfeel is noticeably resinous, but a nice amount of carbonation helps it go down easy.  Overall, the Boston Lager isn't going to blow anyone away with its potency or uniqueness, but it is truly a great beer.

M - This has a lightish body, and has quite a bit of carbonation. You can also feel the hops on your tongue.  D - This is a very drinkable beer.

Everlasting carbonation gives the glass an entertaining, almost champagne like show.  S- Slight sweetness, lightly caramel and a hint of clover honey, perhaps. Some hop oil smell, but not overly piney or citrusy.  T- The slight sweetness is right away on the front of the tongue, but then almost immediately replaced with a bitterness as the beer makes its way to the back of the tongue. Residual bitterness and sweetness makes for a great lasting aftertaste.  M- Carbonation dances on your tongue through the whole drink.  D- Very drinkable.

This is eventually joined by a very nice and balanced hop taste. A hint of spiciness to match the hops that lingers afterwards.  M - Medium bodied with medium amount of carbonation. Really smooth and crisp overall, and has a really refreshing mouthfeel.  D - Extremely drinkable beer.

Poured into my pint glass for instant consumption!  A- The honey gold body sits below an off-white creamy head. Lots of retention time, and tons of carbonation can easily be seen in this beer. Easily seen through. Not much lacing to talk about here until it was halfway gone. The collar is probably trying to imitate the 18th century with all the frills and poofiness it presents.  S- Nice sweet malt presence initially. Possibly caramels giving it some oomph here. Following that is a floral hops with delicate citrus cape. Mostly sweet, a tad bit of bready nature on the last breath.  T- Opens just like the nose, sweet. However, this isn't as powerful of a player in the flavors. It is instantly knee capped by the hops to steal the show. Bitter, faint contrast by citrus, but the finish is like biting into a biscuit. I have this dual flavor rumble going on here of bitter Pillsbury dough.  M- Strong body, smooth, no complaints on the carbonation. Flavors linger delightfully on my palate. Residue can be found on the lips and teeth to revel in.  D- The go to craft beer of the century. When I first got into craft it was this bad boy I was ordering, and I am proud to finally pour a cold one at my house and drink it down.

The head has pretty good staying power and passable lacing.  Faint noble hops in the nose with a little toast and a little toffee sweetness. Splashes of DMS.  More earthy and spicy hops are in the flavor and hop oil is in the finish. The body is really clean. That lager yeast is so snappy and dry. The malt is barely sweet and toasty. Saltine crackers with five granules of sugar.  Being pretty prickly right off emphasizes the crispness this beer has in all aspects. The body speaks to substance rather than 'yellow fizzy beer'.  This kind of beer is not lost one me, but my enjoyment of it tends to be pretty situational. Like now, I'm drinking it in the first stages of winter and I'd prefer it in the summer or fall.

35,104,nick76,3.33,to be honest a pretty standard lager. The sad thing is that this is better than most of the commercially available lagers making this a better than the average example of the style. The appearance is amber gold with a medium head. The aroma has grassy hops and not so sweet malts. There is a touch of adjuncts in there. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth.

A slight watery presence with a nice bittering hop finish uncommonly present for the typical ""American Lager"". Not much grapefruit in the hops, but a fair amount of bittering. This beer finishes light and refreshing.  M: Leaves a nice tongue-coating of hops. Carbonation is appropriate.  D: High. Very high. This is my ""light beer"" of choice unless I'm mowing the lawn on a 90-degree day (then this has too much substance for that, and I really do want something watery like a Coors Light).

Pours a golden copper hue with 1"" off white head, and no I didn't put my bottle cap upside down on it! Recedes to a think pillow like, slightly indented cap. Smells of pale and caramel malts, light citrus hop scent, mainly lemon zest. Tastes fairly sweet, dominated by pale malt with a slight citrus hop taste, followed by a bitter presence on the swallow. Decent lacing is left behind after a few good sips. Overall a balanced beer, a mediocre brew and definatly not a Vienna style lager. I paired this with a mandarin chicken salad with raspberry vinegar dressing, the sweetness of this brew walks hand in hand with the tart dressing in my opinion.

Copper/amber clear body, quite a bit darker than most lagers I've had, multiple streams of carbonation. Nose is dominated by roasted malt, some sweetness re caramel with good dose of floral and noble hops. Taste mirrors the nose, a bit sweet up front, good roast in the middle, and surprisingly hoppy finish, not real bitter. Mouthfeel is on light side of medium, medium effervescence.

Smell: Biscuity malts and very slight citrusy, grassy smell. This is undoubtedly the weak point in this beer, in my opinion. Pretty unimpressive.  Taste: Biscuity malts and fairly strong citrus up front, followed by a modest amount of hops at the end. It tastes better than it smells, for sure. Respectable in this category.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer was light bodied with pretty smooth, abundant carbonation. About what I expected, but not bad. This is a drinkable beer, for sure.

Pours a bright amber color with about a finger and a half of off white head. Head is big and creamy that hangs around for a while leaving a faint trace of lacing as it recedes. Smell is a bit faint. Very grainy with some sweet malt tons, not picking up much hops. Taste is similar only more impressive. Again that graininess that seems to come with most lagers long with some sweeter notes. Some nice faint hop flavor in the finish, a perfect amount of flavor to accentuate a nice brew. This was one of my ""treat yourself"" beers before I discovered the rest of the craft universe, it's nice to come back and review it after trying everything I can get my hands on for the past year.

35,104,adamette,4.27,"Live review. Poured from the bottle that I bought as a part of the ""Winter sampler"" or whatever from Sam's Club a few weeks ago (the 2011 one with Chocolate Bock in it). Poured into my Cooperstown Beverage Trail pint glass. ""best by"" date of Feb 2011 nicked out of the left side of the label.  A Light, fluffy very light brown head over a translucent, medium brown colored body. Reasonably good lacing left on the inside of the glass as well. Fine look. 3.5  S Pleasant, light roast malt over a grainy lager smell. Quite a good, inviting smell. 4.0  T Very nicely balanced lager with the aforementioned light malt, some grain tastes that I associate with the lagering and a light nutty character holding it all together. Really, this is a very good tasting beer and that makes the drinkability quite high indeed. 4.5  M A bit on the thin side. That is appropriate for the style but it is not one that I particularly like. I will give it an average score for being on target with the style but nothing more because I do not prefer that feel. 3.0  D As mentioned, the exceptionally good taste make this very drinkable.

35,104,dcook11,4.1,"Reviewed out of a pint glass. This beer has been out of the fridge for about twenty minutes. I've had this brew many times before and I must say that I love it! A shining example of a Vienna Lager!  A- Pours a golden honey color with a pencil thin head that is formed by a small number of tiny bubbles rising to the top of the glass in a straight line formation. Lacing is present, and adorns the side of the glass with wispy cloud like foam. Although there is room for improvement (more aggressive lacing and a more persistent head), the beer's appearance is quite good for a more commercial craft beverage.  S- A sweet caramel malt is the first aroma apparent to the nose, followed by a very floral/tropical hop presence. The malt character is pleasingly sweet, and reminds me very much of the Rogue brewing's Dead Guy Ale. This type of malt presence is a staple of Sam Adams, and one of the reasons why I continue to buy their beers. Further, the tropical hop presence is unique to Sam Adams as I detect it in almost every one of their beers.  T- The taste is very well balanced, another reason why I love this style and this particular beer. I detect an initial caramel sweetness from the malt followed by a slight pear/ apple note that is very faint (you almost have to search for it). This fruitiness is then backed by a slight hop presence, but lacking the tropical flavors that are present in the smell.  M- Sam Adams Boston Lager is light bodied with just a touch of bite on the tongue from the mild hop presence.  D- I would rate this very high as the low abv coupled with the superb balance of this beer make this almost the perfect session lager. All things taken into account...you will be hard pressed to find a beer of this quality and price that boasts such a high drinkability.  A staple beer in my book.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,r0nyn,3.78,"Poured from a bottle into my Otter Creek nonic.  Pours a clear orangey amber color, with a fluffy white head that recedes quickly, leaving some soapy, sticky lacing. Smell is a bit on the subdued side, with multiple deep whiffs revealing floral hop notes along with some citrus and malts. Slight bit of soapiness as well, which is unexpected.  Light hop bittering in the initial sip, quickly giving way to a definite bready flavoring. Mild nuances of caramel and citrus at the end along with a bit of toasted maltiness.. Not too much of an aftertaste at all. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with a lightish body that's got some chewiness to it. Not very much carbonation.  With a clean, crisp character, this is a very drinkable brew. I now completely understand why this is the perfect fall-back beer if there's nothing else good on tap. The Boston Beer Company continues to impress me with their efforts and I'm very thankful that their brews are ubiquitous in bars all around the country.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,krisandajt,3.55,"Appearance: Poured from the bottle into a standard glass, the beer is a clear, light amber color. Not too much head, maybe a half inch or so, which is probably the result of too gentle a pour. Retention isn't greatest, but the foamy off-white head does stick around for a little bit. Lacing isn't great either, only a few thin rings around the glass where the beer came to settle.  Smell: Sweet, biscuity, but subdued and mild. Not really picking up too much from the hops. Nothing really jumping out here.  Taste: Mostly a biscuity malt quality, but the hops are showing through a bit more here. The moderate bitterness provided by the piney hops does provide some balance and reigns in the malt a bit. Not bad.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is good, despite the beer sitting in the glass a while, and the body is an enjoyable medium to full.  Drinkability: An easy drinking, tasty beer that's readily available most anywhere you go. It's one that I've enjoyed plenty of times in the past, and will continue to do so whenever the selection is less than impressive.

A: almond-colored with highlights of gold and perfect clarity. A puffy, craggy head of light khaki slowly fizzles to a creamy top layer of latte-like foam, leaving webbed lace, and lots of it.  S: super earthy, cereal grain, some sourdough and hints of lemon brought out by the German hops.  T: we begin with hops, bringing notes of earth and a light pineyness. The malt washes in steadily after the finish: uncooked bread dough, saltine crackers and walnuts. Subtly sweet finish, yet balanced well with the earthy hops.  M: very high carbonation, amidst a light body with soft fizziness. The finish is nice and crisp.  D: Good old SABL. Even in a wasteland of BMC taps, you can usually count on SA to save you from shitty beer, which is exactly what happened on this evening.

Also some nice lacing on the top of my pint glass as the head recedes. The first thing that hits my nose on this brew is the hop presence, its prominent but not overpowering by any means. There is also some sweet malts that try and poke though in the aroma of this lager. The taste is very balanced, sweet caramel malts upfront with a refreshing, crisp, and somewhat bitter finish as the hop profile rounds out this brew nicely. I consider this light bodied, with moderate carbonation and fairly drinkable.  This is always an old stand by, since I can find it on tap most places that are heavy on the BMC, but it really is more than that.

A small undercurrent of biscuit is present as well but well hidden. This goes to a finish that has a good, crisp finish to it from the hops....with a rather obvious fresh grain aftertaste lingering for a while.

It's sweeter or I guess more floral-y tasting than I thought it would be, which caught me a bit off guard, but I can't say anything negative about it.

Now that it is nearly ubiquitous at almost every chain restaurant and corner beer store, beer connoisseurs seem to take this beer for granted, but it has great hop flavor and aroma. This is especially true at busy restaurants where this beer seems to sell well and stays fresh. The copper color is inviting and again, the hops keep this beer refreshing, the perfect foil to greasy burgers and deep fried food. There is enough malt and sweetness to make drinking a breeze. Beer drinkers should really reconsider this well balanced and unpretentious lager that pretty much defines the craft beer movement on the East Coast.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,stingrayvr6,4.1,"Was at a bar that had the special Sam Adams glasses so had to try it out in one. Certainly looks sexy in that glass, creates a perfect frothy white head, good retention and lacing on top of a yellowish light brown, medium carbonation. Smell earthy and bready, some faint hops. Taste crisp hops balance the malt body. Very flavorful lager, several steps above any lager I've had since Smuttynose Portsmouth lager. Almost pale-ale-esque in its bitter finish. Very enjoyable and supremely drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,herman77,3.83,"A: Clear dark honey gold/light amber. Frothy, creamy, off white head. One big sheet of lacing all the way down the glass.  S: Slightly sweet cereal grains, a little bit of hops.  T: Lightly sweet carmel and biscuity malt. There is a hint of toastedness to the malt too. Floral hops come punching through to provide a really nice balance. Mildy bitter hop finish with a nice crispness to it.  M: Medium body, fair amount of carbonation. Feels ever so slightly smooth.  D: Mild-straight forward flavors, great balance, low ABV.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,tbern007,3.56,"Golden perfect color! Got it in the winter 12 pack this time. Better when not served too cold but not room temp either. Average scent. decent head that stays. Malty and hoppy. Good mix. Somewhat earthy. Sparkly and enjoyable aftertaste. Caramel. Tasty but not heavy, not too malty. Good overall middle of the road beer for many occasions.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,wmtxbb,2.9,"Appearance: clear amber color. Head dissipates quickly forming a beer that looks like soda pop. Not very impressive.  Smell: very light grain malt smell. This beer might have some wheat malt  Taste: light citrus, light on the malt. Sort of a crisp flavor that is a little refreshing and a little dry aftertaste... I had to check to make sure this was not the light sam adams lager. Watered down flavor. There is no reason this beer should be a B+, a B at best.  Drinkability: It's drinkable, that much is for sure. Really watered down though. This is a summer or session beer, the kind you drink with a meal or something. It's not that this is a bad beer, it just isn't a top tier lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,PirateUlf73,4.35,"I can't believe I'm just now taking time to seriously review this beer, in the sense of typing out my thoughts on it. Poured from the standard 12 oz bottle into my favorite British pint glass.  A: Pours a fantastic light amber with a persistent white head. Seemingly good carbonation. Looks like a beer should.  S: Floral and pine-like hop notes to start, with a lingering malty smell in the background. Despite the order, neither seems more dominant, but in a harmonious fashion. Crisp and down-to-business.  T: Oh yah, there it is. Very well-balanced between hoppy assertiveness and malty sweetness. The aforementioned hop characteristics dance above a great grain bill of structure and flavor. The two parties work very well together.  M: Medium-bodied in every sense of the word. Not too light and not too heavy. Very smooth on the palate and the throat.  D: The combination of smoothness and balance makes this a prime example of a solid session beer. Very drinkable.  I may look back on this review later in life and accuse it of being colored by nostalgia, as this beer was one of my two ""pillar beers"" that forever addicted me to good craft beer (the other being Dark Horse's Crooked Tree IPA). From my current, most objective point of view however, this is a very good, very easy-to-find beer. Almost every bar worth visiting will have this on tap, so I'll always have something to drink when I go out with friends. There is a reason this beer is popular. It's a very balanced beer full of flavor and character, and one that I never hesitate to recommend. Samuel Adams may have other beers that I would select before their Boston Lager, but it will always be welcome in my fridge.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mc1775,4.2,"Samuel adams boston lager. It was my first craft beer and is of great sentimental value to me. So it only seems appropriate it should be my first review. Here it goes.  A- A crisp amber color with a small head on it that disapates fairly quickly which is not normal for this beer, I beleive it is possibly because of the glassware.  S- Great balanced smell of mildly sweet malts and a crisp slightly citrus smell.  T- a great balanced taste of caramel and toasty malts finishing with hops and a nice mild hop aftertaste and finish.  M- Medium bodied perfectly carbonated beer.  D- Drinkability is awesome. Cant help but want to take another sip.  Notes. Great lager and still one of my go to's.

S: Nice, crisp, caramel smell. T: Yum! Malty, not overly sweet with a touch of bitterness on the finish. Highly drinkable.  This is my favorite beer of this style.

35,104,bamadog,4,"I've had this one a bunch, and managed to take the time to write down the review from the tap about a year or so ago. Since I picked up a sample pack a couple of weeks ago, I figured that I should take the opportunity to review it from the bottle as well. Review is from notes taken on 10/23/2010 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a light orange/coppery color; starts with a loose one finger white head that fades fairly quickly to a thin and uneven cap; body has great clarity and shows moderately strong carbonation bubbling throughout; only a few spots of lacing are left behind.  Smell: A light sweet and bready maltiness with a hint of toasty/burnt barley/graininess; slight bitter hop presence; overall, it's pretty lager-esque, but definitely more robust and appealing than anything a macro-style would offer.  Taste: A nice and well balanced beer -- nice toasty grainy barley and that sweet bready maltiness; very faint bittering hop presence; this comes across as a pretty simple beer, but it's very well done; I find the hops kind of provide a mild citrus presence as I continue to sip it down.  Mouthfeel: Body is just a tad heavier than what I would consider to be light; carbonation is crisp and lively -- providing plenty of action without being remotely sharp; a dry film is left on the roof of the mouth; doesn't really sit too heavily at all.  Drinkability: This is really a sessionable beer -- nothing really wrong with it at all; while it's nothing to get especially excited about, it is certainly solid and is definitely a go-to beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Agold,4.29,"This beer is completely different beer on tap and in the bottle. It pours just about the same with a nice dark amber color, and about a centimeter of white head. It smells of fresh floral hops, caramel, and nice sweetness. Tastes have the same notes and it is extraordinary. mouthfeel was a bit heavy and undercarbonated, but that may have been more of the fault of the bar i was at, and not the beer its self. Very drinkable beer and i was happy to have another. Out of the bottle i liked this beer, on tap, it was pretty great.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S: The aroma is of malt, biscuits, bread, barley.  T: The taste is simple and enjoyable. There is a nice bread or biscuit quality to the flavor that I find appealing.

The first beer to pull me away from drinking the crap beers in college. This pours a deep rich amber color with a thick ecru foam adorning the surface. The aroma could be fresher the hops really have not held up in this tasting, it doesn't smell all that great, but I know the potential from many previous experiences that it can get much better. The nice balance of caramel and malt gives the aroma and flavor a nice 1-2 combo. There is a wonderful toasted aroma and flavor that goes along with this beer. The mouthfeel is nothing extraordinary it does it's job, there is still residual bitterness that I can't get past, but it's still a solid brew. There may not be too many beers that are easier to consume than this, if this recipe was a tad bit smoother I would love to swim in it, but as it stands, I could drink this about anywhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smell: Sweet malts dominate, with some floral hops and caramel smells chilling in the back.  Taste: Opens up with sweet malts. There's just a bit of caramel, floral hops and fruits. Lots of flavor for the style. It's just great tasting.  Mouthfeel: Just thick enough for all the flavors inside. Carbonation is spot-on.  Drinakbility: Very drinkable, very good.

The aroma has sweet malt notes, caramel, light fruitiness, citrus, and floral qualities.  The flavor is really great, and pretty hoppy IF you get it super-fresh, like I did in this case. Citrusy, herbal, and floral hop notes, sweet but not too sweet caramel malt, and a slight nuttiness.  Medium-light bodied, clean and crisp with an appropriate carbonation level.

Retention is very good, and the head leaves ample sticky lacing.  S: Hop aromas that are herbal and a bit floral, a little caramel, and a strong dose of Munich and Pilsner malts. Overall the smell seems more subdued than I remember.  T:Malty and sweet at first (distinctly Munich and Pilsner malts). Faint hints of caramel can be detected. Hops are, as the nose suggested, grassy, herbal, and a bit floral. Bitterness is fairly mild, but balances the malt sweetness well. The finish is dry and a bit toasty with a very pleasant grainy character. Some hop bitterness rides out in the finish as well.  M: Moderate in body, creamy, and with a very clean, crisp, and refreshing carbonation.  D: High. This is a very tasty, easy to drink beer. Sort of an Everyman's beer.  Notes: This was one of the first beers I was exposed to when I started drinking craft beer. I loved it then, and it is still good now. Taste and smell seem a bit more subdued than I remember, but I will chalk that up to a more developed palate. I distinctly detected some caramel in the taste and smell, which is not really appropriate for the Vienna Lager style, so a point or two was deducted on that account.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Not terrible, but nothing special. About average.  Nice mouthfeel--standard for Sam Adams.  Totally drinkable, but I would opt for a few other things before this.

S: Carmel and fruit notes with a strong presence of quality filtered water. Nice!  T: Crisp, malty, and downright refreshing. Full taste, with caramel-like finish that is as fresh as it gets!  M: Not sweet in the least, the carbonation is perfect for the style, and the fruit notes blend into those malts nicely.  D: Nothing complex here, nor do I believe that was Sam Adams intention.

I wish more craft breweries branched out more and tried their hand at lagers, but I definitely appreciate SA's effort.  Nice looking beer, darker than many lagers, but this isn't advertising itself as a light beer. Almost amber in color, quite clear, with a decent head that fades at a typical pace.  I like the hops on the nose. Definitely a grassy Noble hop element, backed with solid bready, doughy malt aromas and some honey. Very nice smelling lager, especially with some warmth.  Good, full flavors. I'm a sucker for full-flavored lagers, and I'm appreciating the amount of malts that go into this beer. Lots of hearty malts with quite a bit of sweetness, balanced by mild bittering at the end. Pretty full-bodied for the style of beer... almost too much except for the amount of flavors, it's working for me. I might spring for a lighter-bodied beer for pure thirst quenching, but this beer is much more enjoyable for its own sake.  Great effort by Sam Adams! This beer oozes quality without going over the top, it's still very drinkable, even in quantity.

The appearance was very good - clear, light copper colored with 2 fingers of near white head; nice lacing. Lots of carbonation/bubbles. I get a bit of malt in the smell, but it is mostly of hops. Same for the taste - it seems too bitter for this style of beer to me, with little malt balance. It was smooth, but left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth. I think this would pair well with spicy food; not too enjoyable by itself.

S- This beer smells pretty sweet, a mix of caramel malts and floral hops combine to form the sweet smell.  T- Similar to the nose with the balance of caramel malts and hops are very preesent with the sweetness toned down a little compared to the smell. Bitter hops come out in the aftertaste.  M- Crisp and medium bodied, good carbonation.  D- This beer can be drinkable but i find the flavors to be lacking and boring so i would only have one or two if offered.

Very hard to define, maybe somewhat citrusy, but in a more real sense, as opposed to the fake citrus flavors..  Taste - earthiness to this one. The hops are there, but they're not bitter. And it's not a malty taste. Very smooth.  Mouthfeel - smooth, well-balanced. More watery in texture, but only slightly so.  Drinkability - Smooth enough for easy-drinking, and complex enough (mostly in hop variety) to keep the drinking entertaining!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I've had lots of lagers before and I like this one. It can be paired with just about any cuisine you can think of. It looks great, especially when in its custom glass.

35,104,TheKingofWichita,2.93,"First of all -- it is a decent session beer. With a 4.75 ABV it rings true to be a good session. It pours a medium amber color with medium head and half decent lacing. Smells fairly bad with a lot of booze and malted barley aroma, some hops in there but kinda hard to discern. Tastes of blended malt and hops with a good hop nose. Mouthfeel isn't too thin -- makes for a smooth drink. Drinkability is good as with most of Sam Adams stuff.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jj311,4.37,"Presentation: I poured it from a 12 ounce bottle into a drinking glass.  Appearance: Light-amber with a gold hue. Thick off-white foam head. I tested the myth and placed a bottle cap on the foam, and it stayed on the top. Showed good retention upon agitating.  Smell: A sweet malty smell with an good balance of floral hoppyness and alcohol.  Taste: Sweet malt, with hoppy overtones, alcohol and a bit of spice. A nice bitter-sweet finish. The malt seems to be well balanced with the Noble Hops.  Mouthfeel: A thicker, ""crisp"" mouthfeel than your typical lager.  Drinkability: Easy to drink. Mellow enough to want to drink more, but strong enough to keep satisfied.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,stephens101,4.42,"Sort of coming full circle here, or perhaps just getting back to the basics for a bit. However you look at it, this is one fine and tasty lager that's been a standard for quite some time.  Obviously I'm pouring this into a SA specialty glass. The rolling off-white head fills the glass perfectly and hangs around for a few carefree moments. After it settles a bubbly lace is left around the glass. Color is a golden orange.  Caramel malts and a few notes of hops rise to the nose. Tastes malty with a hint of light fruits and a bitter back end that fuses almost perfectly. Well-carbonated and light to medium-bodied but, still quite sessionable. One of my favorite lagers, and a tad bit underrated in my opinion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ProfessorHomer,4.36,"This beer has remained consistently exceptional throughout its long and storied, and award-winning, life. So common that I hadn't had one in years, so I was very, very pleasantly surprised when I retuirned to its fold. Way to go Sam Adams! This is the quintessential American-style Lager - copper coloured and slighly overhopped. All-American in the true-blue sense of the term. Bravo!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mbusster88,3.65,"Nicely put together beer. Great for a meal, watching the game or just kicking a few back. Aroma is a nice and full and hints at good things to come. Color is nice with dark orange or red tints. Taste is nice with some hops at the end, more caramel up front. Easy drinker with a rewarding taste, not the most complex beer but a good drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MoreThanWine,3.66,"Honestly it had been a long time since I really paid attention to a Sam Adams Boston Lager I was drinking. Well, it's a cross in color between gold and copper. Has a modest 1/2"" head but that head stayed a long long time. Flavorful enough to get noticed but not a powerhouse. You get some sweetness, some caramel, some malt. All in all a quality beer for the price.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Groomsy,3.86,"Appearance: Poured a nice copper/amber almost kind of rusty orange/red from the tap, but not opaque. A very solid one-finger white head tops the beer, but fades gradually. Decent lacing throughout, but nothing too special.  Smell: There's a very nice and deep malt smell that comes out first with a bit of caramel, balanced with a fresh, almost spicy type of hop smell. Hints of crispness, but not overbearing.  Taste: Very similar to the smell. First thing I noticed was the malts. Sweet and residual, but the beer isn't overbearingly sweet or malty. This is balanced with some very subtle hops in the back, just enough to balance the malt nature of the beer out front. The hop taste kicks in and leaves a fresh, crisp, almost spicy taste as the beer goes down. Nice balance of sweet on contact and subtle bitterness as it goes down. All in all, very solid, if slightly predictable.  Mouthfeel: The relatively low carbonation of this beer is one my favorite things about it. It's not super-thin and watery but isn't so robust that the texture causes one to forget flavor. It starts at a good middle ground and goes down a little more robust than its entry but never gets too foamy. Leaves some slightly bitter aftertaste in a very good way.  Drinkability: I only had one, but I can definitely see having this as a session beer. Well-balanced, flavorful, and a big step above the usual macro-brews. Even if its nature is slightly predictable, this beer is highly drinkable.  All in all, this was one beverage that sort of helped catalyze my interest in beer, specifically in microbrews. A good stepping stone into the beer world, and just an all-around solid brew for America.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,scott451,3.73,"One finger tan head. Reddish amber. Good head retention. Minimal lacing.  Floral fruity malt smells. Taste is malts up front with a fruity hop finish.

Not a bad beer at all, just nothing to get really exited about.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,aasher,3.88,"This one poured a burnt pumpkin orange in color with a poofy off white head. It was well carbonated and appeared very bubbly and active. It smelled malty and had good hoppyness to it. The taste is a nice balance of malt and hops and I'd say that if I had to choose then I would say it every so slightly favored the malt. It had slight sweetness to it, not honey but similar to. It drank fresh and crisp and was very refreshing. It's quite drinkable, although I'd never buy a six pack of it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T: nice! Very smooth and not too much carbonation. Slight hop biiterness but primarily a solid malty flavor.  M: again, solid flavor that doesn't overpower.  D: continues to be on of my favorite pairings with almost any food, especially steaks/burgers. Doesn't overpower the meal but compliments it nicely.

35,104,lstokes,3.88,"My department tends to serve bottles of this at happy hours, and despite my extreme beer snobbery, I sat down with this and decided, you know, it's a pretty solid Vienna Lager.  It's dark gold with a surprisingly nice head. The smell is something of an off note, as it's really just light toasted malt, but the taste is complex, with some nice floral hops to go along with your caramel malt, maybe some citrus oil as it warms. A very fine carbonation makes it drinkable and refreshing--really a solid beer, and I'm thrilled it's out there turning people onto craft.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Sleestak,3.95,"Had this on tap earlier today at Angelos in Anaheim. 32 oz poured in a plastic cup. Amber in color with a decent head but not lasting long. Malts and hops.

Washed down my chicken strips and fries nicely.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ToasterChef,4.07,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The bottle has a best by date of Jan. 2011. The beer is copper colored, just like a big brew kettle. There is a large head, colored slightly off-white, made up of various sized bubbles. Initially, there is a lot of carbonation rising in the glass, and pockets of bubbles clinging to the sides of my glass. These pockets have risen to the top of the glass, and the head is receding, leaving some patchy lacework behind, but plenty of carbonation is still streaming from the bottom of the glass.  The aroma of fresh, earthy hops was apparent as soon as I opened the bottle. In increased in intensity as I poured. Now, when I stick my nose into the glass to get the full force of the aroma, I can detect the scents of crisp hops and some pale grains. It is a good pleasing aroma.  The flavor is very balanced. There is a biscuity malt base and hop oils apparent from the moment the beer enters my mouth. The hop oils aren't overly bitter, which is how I usually encounter them, but crisp and reasonably bitter. There is a bit of an increase in the bitterness in the finish, but also some lingering sweetness. After some sips, I get more bitter; others contain more sweet. Both are tasty.  The beer is light bodied. The carbonation isn't as high as I expected; you can feel it but it isn't distracting at all. Let's call it average. A good coat remains after I swallow; it has both sweet and bitter flavors.  I think the Boston Lager is quite drinkable. It's not a beer I usually, but if it is what I decide to enjoy, I can easily have a few rounds. This is a fine selection to have on hand to share with beer drinkers of any kind.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,StarshipPoopers,3.76,"A - The appearance of the beer itself is nice. Rich copper colour with a thin white head. The head isn't very appealing though, it quickly thins out to a few thinly scattered clumps on the surface. The use of ""soap bubbles"" to describe the look is really accurate. Quite a bit of carbonation.  S - Normal lager smell. Grains mixed in with some sweet tones. Nothing too special here IMO.  T - Quite good for a lager. It lacks the kick and excitement of stronger or more complex beers, but for what it is this tastes great. The malts can actually be tasted and offer a sweet tone that helps to balance the grain flavours. There are also slight hints of hops that were a welcome surprise and really balances this beer nicely. While the malts and grains still dominate the taste, the hops add a nice complexity to the overall taste. Sets it apart from more generic lagers.  M - Clean, crisp and refreshing. A solid but light feel with a little bit of a bite. Very nice flavours for a lager, and the carbonation is low enough to allow a reasonably smooth texture.  D - Very drinkable. Being a lager it goes down pretty smooth and isn't overpowering. The taste in this is complex enough to make it enjoyable to drink while still being simple enough to just down a few of these at a time as a casual drink.  Overall a great lager that seems to be readily available in most LCBOs here in Ontario and is refreshing when compared to the other generic lagers that one typically finds in such places.  Definitely a good candidate for a session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,EgadBananas,3.89,"Fairly light. Light off white head, a little soapy. Too light. Lighter than on-tap from memory. Though, I hear the bottles from the Variety packs are lighter. No excuse for the difference I think...  Smell is toasty, with some nice caramel, sweet malts. Not hugely aromatic, but it's very nice.  Taste is much better! Nice notes of caramel, toasted malts, little sweetness.  Feel is silky smooth, medium carbonation, light, but upper light in body. Definitely some nice substance.  No brainer, very easy to palate!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CBOLAND17,1.68,A beer that is considered great by many people..but i am not one of those people. Samuel Adams produces a lager that is way over hopped for that style of beer. Additionally it doesnt seem like they are even using the correct type of hops because it is far too bitter for a lager. This beer looks good but is far from it. Sam Adams claims that it is i craft brewery but in actuality it is right up there with Budweiser and Coors.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,sdj5,4.07,"This beer poured a copper color with a cream-colored 2 finger head.  The smell is primarily the excellent floral aroma of the noble hops.  The taste is wonderfully clean, with a taste of bread, small initial taste of the hops and then a bite at the end.  The beer feels good in my mouth with a very balanced amount of carbonation.

S: A very nice mixture sweet grains and hops in the aroma. The noble hops definitely come through and give it a nice herbal body.  T: The taste is almost a sweet tea-like grain and hop flavor. The malt and hop flavors are very balanced and neither one takes over the other. The finish is sweet with a slight bitterness and leafy hop flavor.  M: The beer is nice and light. Carbonation is not very high.  D: I really like this lager. Hate to admit that this is the first time I've tried it after passing up the opportunity so many times. Definitely recommend this beer.

Smells of floral hops and a little bit of caramel. Taste is malty with little bit of hops to balance it out. Heavier and more flavorful than an BMC lager, but it still has the clean finish that is a point of attraction to those beers. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Overall a simple but very enjoyable beer. I drink a beer to enjoy it, not to have my mind blown by the 98 flavors to sort through.

35,104,asnider,4.01,"Poured into a pint glass, this beer looks incredible. Great colour: a nice golden amber and an excellent head.  Great head retention. It poured quite tall (I have a bad habit of being a bit too heavy on the pour) but didn't shrink at all until I started drinking it. It does eventually shrink down to about a half inch and stays there for the duration.  Carbonation is high: the bubbles never seem to stop, but this doesn't negatively affect the mouthfeel. It's just the right amount of carbonation.  The taste is really quite good. This is definitely one of those lagers that almost tricks you into thinking that it's an ale. It's heavy on the malt, with just enough hops to balance it out and give it a hint of bitterness. The finish doesn't last long, but is an interesting mix of both sweet and bitter. It's a balanced finish, if nothing else.  Drinkability is quite good. It's much too easy to down a few bottles and suddenly realize that you've had more than you thought.

The yeast taste fresh and healthy. This particular bottle is good. I have found this beer less appealing in the past. Again, the hops are really well balanced in this beer.

The sweetness comes mostly from its strong malt character. Caramel notes most prevalent. I get a slight ting from the hops.  D: Overall, a nice drinkable beer. Likely one of the two first craft beers I ever had. I remember thinking how awesome this tasted when I first tried it. Well, after many years, this one still stands up well.

This is a great beer and my go to at most restaurants. One of the beers that got me into drinking better beer.  The appearance is a tad lighter than I remember and have had in the past. I find this with most of their mixed packs that the beers vary. Either way it's a golden color with an off white head and sick lacing down the glass. Aroma is malty sweet biscuity goodness but one dimensional and remains that way. The flavor is really smooth but not a lot going on. Some caramel maltiness and sugary biscuits. Mouthfeel is nice.

The lager has a sweetness up front & crisp dryness on the finish with a definite hop presence. (By no means is this beer like an IPA or PA, but hops are present) Overall, this is a pretty good beer & the best Macro-Brew available. Recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Then, after a bit of settling, along comes a fruity hop aroma and perhaps a bit of sweet malt and breadiness.  Roasted malt and yeast to start, then mild hops. Hop bitterness remains a decently long while. Medium-light body and good carbonation. Interesting feel and flavor but not intensely captivating. Enjoyable nonetheless!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CrazyDavros,3.15,"Pours orange/amber with a small creamy head. Nose shows floral and spicy hops followed by some prominent malt showing caramel and bready characters. The malt is full-on, more than I expected. An interesting aspect. Flavours continue along the same lines with heavy-handed malt additions, again with caramelised and bready characters. Finishes with a plain bitterness. Carbontion is a little too high, body seems quite heavy. Could be a bock with all that malt.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Has a malty, barley taste, with a hint of hops. The drinkability is poor because of the fullness of the lager.

A little bit of a hoppy finish, kind of sweet.  M: Smooth, decent carbonation.  D: Incredibly drinkable, but not something I'd want too much of.  I don't know why I can't get into Sam Adams, they seem to be well reviewed and my friends love it, but the only one I've had that I liked was their summer ale.

S - grains, some wet slightly grassy and earthy (dirt) hops...lightly sweet caramel malt.

D: Very drinkable beer, easy to find beer. The only thing I notice is the beer is a bit too sweet; as your mouth becomes accustomed to the hops you start to notice it more and more.  All in all, I think this is a great example of an under-produced beer style. You can find it just about everywhere, its a good beer to choose when your at a bar with somewhat meager choice of taps.

Looks fine.  Aroma is kind of nutty and malty with some minimal earthy hops. Definitely hops in the aroma but not strong or bitter smelling.  Beer is medium in body and has mild sweetness up front, some bitterness in the back but mostly a malty feeling throughout.

The dry, pleasant aftertaste lingers.  Mouthfeel- Medium-bodied with ample carbonation that leaves a pleasant tingling.  Drinkability- It's strong enough to be satisfying, yet light enough to imbibe multiple bottles.

The nose is a fairly nice balance of hops and malt, which is nice; a common lager that has some interest to it. I get that standard ""lager smell"", with extra hints of green grapes / a light wine, and some malt that's harder to pin... it's faint, so I find it tough to peg whether it's toffee, caramel, etc.  The taste is pretty good; on the better side of average.  The carbonation is good for a lager - crisp and plentiful, but not too aggressive; just there to keep it fresh and fairly sharp. The body is medium, and the finish is slightly sticky without being really watery or dry.  Overall, a decent beer to pick up a pack of and take to a party; tasty enough, but not so good/expensive as to command your thoughts and attention.

Little retention, some lacing. Moderately active carbonation visible. Good clarity. Nose has light citrus and hop resins primarily, but some malts--biscuit and toffee, mainly--are there in the background. Decent, but not as well balanced as I'd like.  The flavor of the beer is an improvement over the nose. Toast and biscuit malt up front, with a light hop presence following. Slightly dry finish, bitter when compared to macro adjunct lagers, but the hops are just what the beer needs for balance; it's be too sweet without them.  Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, with a somewhat dry finish. Sessionable, and I've always thought that a blind taste test would be a good way to convert a BMC drinker, but aside from its role as a 'gateway,' it's a decent beer even for non-lager drinkers and I've had to fall back on it on occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T - Again, rather surprised, bitter citrus hops off the top, followed by a balanced toasty malt finish. The aftertaste is a little bitter and dry, and there's a touch of alcohol flavour which lingers. All-in-all pretty tasty and light.  M - Goes does smooth and light but the finish is definitely a little dryer. Overall, pretty damn nice.  D - As previously mentioned, my expectations were not that high, however, this one well exceeded them. The scent was much stronger than I would've thought and the flavours were nicely balanced.

35,104,BBThunderbolt,3.85,"This probably the version of this style that is the most familiar to the American beer drinker. On the whole it is a solid and decent example of the style, but not exceptional. A lovely copper-gold color, a nice semi-sweet grain scent, nicely balanced malt and hop flavors, a solid but not heavy body and easy drinkability are the hallmarks of this beer.

Nice slow bubble release, very pleasant looking.  Smell is malty and hoppy with a grapefruit sweetness  Taste is crisp and flavorful, nicely balanced and very pleasant taste.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation.  Drinkability is high, and since it is so avaiable its a great one for multiple in a night.

The head is slightly off-white with great head retention. Very little spots of lacing are left behind clinging to the sides of my glass.  The aroma was that of grains with some hops(maybe some noble). I get freshly cut grass, wet hay, sweet German like hops, cracker like malts, pale malt, slight citrus lemon character. Smells a lot like a Czech Pilsner.  The taste upfront is sweet upfront with slight lemon and hint of pink bubblegum, about midway malts come into play and get caramel, some toffee flavor(?).

35,104,GregoryVII,4,"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into my Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass, which really does create a nice presentation. The beer pours golden amber, with a nice head that leaves lacing along the sides as you drain the contents. The hop aroma is floral, green and budding with underlying notes of spice. There is a pleasently understated whiff of sweet, the light fumes of burning sugar in a pan. The body is smooth and malty. The initial sip is slightly sweet, caramel, with very slight notes of roast and nuts. Hop flavor is restrained, but notable, delivering a bit of spice promised in the aroma.

Great color a bronze with orange hue.  Smell - Nutty and Malty with a slightly bitter hop smell.  Taste - Caramel with some nuttiness to it with a nice dry finish.

Appearance: Huge head with a honey-gold body that reveals some reddish gleams.  Smell: A bit reserved but i get malt, a bit of nuttiness and some bitterness.  Taste: Malt heavy with a decent dose of hops though it doesn't quite have that bite that i'd hoped for. Has a bit of a weird aftertaste. It sounds like i don't like it but it was rather good.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, maybe a little thin but still a solid body.  Drinkability: I could see myself drinking this on a regular basis though it would be nice to have a more well rounded flavor.

35,104,Fnerk,3.15,"Poured into a Newcastle snifter.  Appearance - lovely amber brown, rocky two-finger head that settles down to a rocky cap in a few minutes. The cap lingers quite a while. quite nice!  Aroma - Already I smell an overabundance of aroma hops for this style. I'd like the aroma hops to be a bit more subdued and be able to bite into the bittering hops during the tasting, but hey, this is the ART of brewing, not the ""I dictate this shall be the beer OR ELSE! ""  Taste - Lovely. All the derogatory remarks that were (possibly) made earlier disappear upon tasting this brew. Sure, the hop favor predominates over the malt, but it is pleasant and not cloying. The malt is balanced between sweet and dry. Perfect.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. Not too syrupy. not too light. Carbonation seems fine.  Drinkability - Probably about two or three before moving on to something else. Mainly because of the overabundant hop flavor.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance: Clear copper, one-finger white head. Decent retention and lacing.  Smell: Floral hops and caramel malts.  Taste: There is a certain level of sweetness to this beer that is very enjoyable and perfectly offset by mildly bitter hops. Boston Lager is a beer that manages to taste simple and complex at the same time, and is thoroughly delicious. It took me a while to notice the caramelly malts, but once I did, I wondered how I ever missed them.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, crisp, and light, but not too light.  Drinkability: Are you kidding me?

Head is crisp, full, recedes quick but laces very nicely.  Nose - beautiful floral aroma, nice maltiness with a little citrus. A very clean nose. nothing special - just good.  Taste - sweet, crisp barley malts. great balance between hops and malts. No filler here, this is all flavor. Notes of cedar, citrus, licorice, a hint of fruit. Nice and complex, yet crisp and clean just like an amber lager should be.  Mouthfeel - full body, mild carbonation makes this a very relevant addition to the ""american lager"" genre. Smooth and inviting and always a good choice...lol  Drinkability - can and will do many, many more. I never get enough of this beer. It really is a welcome return to flavorful american beers.  NOTE: A total of three Sam Adams commercials played on the TV at the restaurant in the time I drank this one beer, hence the shameless slogan plugs in my review. They seem to have really done a good job of balancing the quality of their product with the creativeness of advertising campaigns. Not to turn this into a anti-corporate thing, but this, in my opinion, is a great model for growing the accessibility of a great product while at the same time maintaining its integrity and not compromising the basic qualities which make it a great product.

S - Some slight sweetness that gives way to a pleasant floral smell.  T - Is terrific, one of the best balanced beers I've ever had. It starts with plenty of malt for sweetness and halfway through transitions to pleasing tanginess from the hops.  M - Thicker than the typical American lager but still easy to swish around in the mouth and easy to go down.  D - Quite high, the taste is great and the body is on the lighter side meaning a very drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nose - Somewhat grainy nose, some bread and light caramel malts. Spicy and somewhat floral hop aromas dominate however.  Taste - Again grainy, pilsener quality to the taste. Very smooth bitterness and great spicy hop bitterness. Finishes with a bready, biscuit-like flavor.  Mouthfeel - Thinner body with lots of carbonation.

Not overly bitter but just right. I rather like the taste. Well balanced.  Mouthfeel - Rather light really.

Honey sweetness, nut-like taste. No alcohol taste. Very clean finish. Would have liked a more pronounced hop taste though.  MF - Medium body beer. Kind of sticks around in the mouth a little while after swallowing. Interesting for a beer as refreshing as this. Great for drinking with a meal.  D - Very easy to drink casually.

T: The flavor is fairly complex for a very common macro, it is obviously dominated by the hops, of which there are several varieties, which give it an interesting and unique pine, citrus, fruit and floral hop flavor. These notes are nicely complimented by notes of malt, caramel and light roasts.  M: I would say this is a medium bodied brew. It has a great level of carbonation and a nice, smooth feel on the tongue. Although there is some texture present, I wouldn't call it syrupy.

M-Light bodied with high carbonation that leads to a tingly mouthfeel.  D-This is the beer I've known and appreciated in the past.

Similar to the smell, tiniest bit of hops. Very bland. 2.0  M- Really thin feeling. Not much carbonation to speak of. 2.0  D- Well it's easy drinking in a Miller Lite kind of way. This is not the beer that I've had on numerous occasions before. I'm not sure if it's a mix-up, a bad batch or if this is is the Coastal Wheat in the wrong bottle.

Probably not appropriate for me to rate this beer given the vast array of quality, non-mass-produced beers I've had in the past, but I am anyway because the fact that this beer is rated so highly on this site offends me. I realize BA tends to rate things higher on average than other sites but I would hope people would recognize a medicore beer when they see it. Whatever this beer used to taste like, whatever it used to be, it is now a mass-produced, overhyped product.  A: A deceptively nice appearance. Dark amber with a half inch head I had to try for. Looks decent enough.  S: It smells like...beer, I suppose. It doesn't smell bad, but there's not too much of an aroma to it at all, certainly nothing that will fill up the room.  T: I'm sorry, but in my opinion, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is water. There, I said it. I purposely saved myself and went straight for this stuff so my palate would not be contaminated with any IPA's, or, frankly, good beer, and this stuff still tasted like water. It's not even that there's a subtle, complex flavor, flat-out, there's barely any hops in this beer, and the hops that are in it went towards making it overly bitter with no other flavors to support the bitterness. The result is an imbalanced, bitter beer that tastes like nothing.  M: What am I supposed to feel? There's nothing there.  D: Very drinkable.

That being said, I intend to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its brews revival, (the original recipe dates back to the late 1870s) from bombers on several more occasions, so further elaboration of this review will subsequently take place. Its appearance grand, pleasing to the eye, a faint amber, bubbly, with good white head, just like sea foam from the shore. It smells fine, slightly hoppy, nothing overbearing, almost sweet, very good. And the taste oh, how crisp and refreshing, its what defines a lager.

Mellows out as it warms and almost has a orange zest taste witha clear malt presence. In my opinion, the hops really liven up the feel and the malt really mellows you towards the end.

The mouthfeel is full of carbonation, and isn't overly thick. This goes down fairly easy, and is something that goes well with fairly any kind of food.

35,104,NA1NSXR,4.08,"Appearance - Medium size head, quite fluffy, rush of carbonation in the glass, nice filtered amber color. Laces very nicely.  Smell - You don't get any of that typical macro lager grain in the nose. What is there is a nice medium hoppiness predominately.  Taste - Superb balance. Starts with caramel and light mix of roasted elements, then a medium hop bite, and finishes with a malt aftertaste mix with a little lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Maybe a touch more carbonation than my own preference but nothing out of place for this kind of lager.  Drinkability - This beer is superb because it is more than the sum of its parts, which from the description is just basic beer ingredients with no gimmicky additives. It really does a lot with the basic beer flavors and mixes them extremely well in a package that is widely available at a fair price. It is the definition of a solid, straight beer in my opinion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Some stickiness remains throughout the finish, but does dry up a bit.

T: the malts are the first thing you taste after that you do get some hop you can drink this beer any time of the year and I would drink it over a macro lager if this was my only choice  M: mouth is good its got just right carbonation not a lot of aftertaste here.

35,104,ktrillionaire,4.1,"Sometimes I hate on this beer. Usually when I haven't had one in a while. Whenever I crack one, I am always surprised how solid it is.  A - It pours a very good rich copper-amber hue with a nice off-white head.  S - The aroma is of beer. Just basic beer. Barley, malted, spiced with bitter hops, and fermented with yeast. It is phenomenally uncomplicated.  T - The taste is again, beer. It is not ""like"" anything. It is not caramel, butter, grapefruit, pine, banana; none of it. It is just a very good lager. Nicely roasted grain flavor, balanced by bitter hops, leaving the brew perfectly balanced.  M - Perhaps the weakest link. The carbonation tends to create too much foam, leading to a slight metallic aftertaste.  D - This is a beer for Americans to be proud of. I wish every BMC drinker would convert to this or Yuengling, and get them off the Belgian or South African swill (AB-InBev or SAB-Miller)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Mancer,3.2,"Poured an amber color with a white head, which quickly dissipated. Lots of bubbles were visible and were able to keep a very thin head throughout the beer's life. The smell of the beer is that of malts and even a bit of hops. The initial taste of the beer was malts and hops. The finish of the beer was not as expected, there was a wheaty after taste which I wasn't too pleased with, but none the less worked well with the beer. An additional note to add is that there was lots of carbonation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Wisconsinality,3.4,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Perfect Pint.  A- Pours a straw gold around the whole glass. A good pour will produce about two finger's worth of head that leaves some pretty impressive lacing around the side of the glass.  S- Very strong malt presence. Maybe just a little bit of grain in there. Not as much as one would expect.  T- A better than usual lager. Almost seems like a lager mixed with a Marzen. Maybe that's just me. Big malt up front and just a little bit of graininess.  M- Medium bodied brew that has the right amount of carbonation and makes for a well rounded beer.  D- I think these get a little thick after the second one so that is usually my limit.

S: Light, toasted malt with a touch of caramel. Hops are barely present, floral.  M: Medium bodied with good carbonation.  T: Bready sweetness from the malt, caramel. Bitter hops balance this beer nicely. Crisp finish with an aftertaste that lingers just enough to invite another sip.  D: An exceptional lager, easy on the palate and on the wallet.

The taste is wonderfully balanced. Malty overall but grassy herbal hops are definitely present. The malt character is wonderful with plenty of caramel, toffee and a nice toastyness.

35,104,Daniellobo,3.5,"A pretty decent and iconic lager. A bit overrated through marketing by now but good to have around.  Presentation: 16 oz draft offering. Menu lacks any description or note. Served in a tall weisse-like glass.  A - Pale gold with a short foamy head, good if bizarre retention and lacing. It goes down clean, but retains a lacing memory of an inch or so above the surface that follows the brew all the way along as it cleans the glass.  S - Light malt nose, and a touch of a low-key bitter and hoppy hint.  T - Light malty feel with a bitter and slightly hoppy seal to it. Back to a light sweet malty sense with a quick bite.  M - Light body, with medium to high carbonation, and a nice crisp finish.  D - It´s a rather quaffable larger, a bit dull but holds its ground.  Notes: It´s a conflicted feeling not being a big fan of the style or typically of the brewery, but the beer itself is pretty decent, and the craft standard it has help to set deserves good respect. By now its own marketing and self-entitlement has grown a little bit out of proportion, but it remains a nice choice to have around, and while typically not mine it is still nice to see this quality brew ahead of macros on a menu.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I thought the appearance was about average with a slight tint of red to an otherwise golden color.  Taste was not bad, but not great. It is starting to grow on me a little as in my younger days I never cared much for Sam's.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, but not overwhelming.

Risingcarbonation bubbles seem on the noticeably active side.  S - Hard to detect but I'm getting a slight toasty malty aroma. Picking up something buttery as well as a hint of caramel sweetness.  T & M - A deep and rich nuttiness and complex toasty malts. Taking gulps along with a bit of air is rendering a slight creaminess. Very minor hops framing the rich flavor - minor on the front, apparent on the sides of the tongue, and lingering in the finish. A pleasurable carbonation on the tongue - tiny carbonation bubble rendering a mild prickly sensation. Very slight soapy taste - hard to detect but I'm getting it. Perhaps an ""okay"" batch?

Flavor is a nice balance of malts and hops. Caramel, bread and a nice toastiness round out the malt flavors while a floral hoppiness accounts for the dry finish.  Mouthfeel is ok.

35,104,BigBen61,3.53,"I will begin that my only qualm with this brew is its lack of consistency on draft from place to place that I have tried it. One of my favorite beers when it comes to being readily available at your average ""family style"" restaurant.  A-Boston Lager, when served in appropriate glassware is a beautiful mahogony color with a rich creamy head. S-Hoppy, malty, but not too strong on either of these aspects. T- Easy drinking, refreshing, but with enough hop and malt charicter to stand up to heavier dishes like steak and burgers (my favorite combo). M-Not all too special in this category, just your average amount of carbonation to round out the flavors. D- Not the kind of beer I would want to drink a lot of in one sitting as in no more than three or four 12 oz. servings.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I've had this many times before (who hasn't?), now it's time for the review.  Eyes: Pours a slightly dark, golden amber. A full two-finger fluffy head climbs to the rim, color is off white. Fairly good retention, with a solid finger of foam clinging to the rim even as the glass empties.  Nose: Toasty, sweet malts and a hint of floral hops in here also. Very earthy and inviting.  Tongue: Some very tasty, toasted, biscuit malts and a touch of dry fruit. There is some bitterness, but just enough to carry the flavor. A very nice profile.  Mouth: Good carbonation, a bit thicker on the palate than other lagers, but very nice.  Libation: A very tasty brew that goes with almost anything and is available almost anywhere across the US. This isn't a jaw dropper of awesomeness for me, but I'm very happy to see a quality lager beer option that's readily available.

I was quickly impressed with the appearance. Thick, dense head that was not at all weak and foamy like most of the lagers that are made here. Also laced pretty well which was a nice suprise. Clear copper in color. Smelled sweet of caramel malts and had a faint floral hop scent to it. Taste is perfectly balanced and true to style with a sweet front and a clean and slightly bitter finish.

Head retention is good and maintains a solid layer on top through the whole experience.  S. Slightly malty and spicy with a pleasing aroma.  T. Well balanced flavor with a bit of a dry after taste. Well rounded with a sweet start and a slight bite on the way down.  M. Active carbonation tickles the tastebuds and is just a slight bit creamy.  D. This beer is delicious and could easily be drank throughout an evening or event with no question. It is a satisfying beer and you will not want to rush these down.

The malt is nice and sweet. The hops add just a hint of bitterness to tame the malt. There is something else I can't quiet put my finger on but it is a slightly skunk smell that probably comes from the yeast.  Taste: Maltiness is the first thing that comes out. Not overly malty for the style but just right. The hops do their job to balance the beer and prevent is from being too sweet.  Mouthfeel: Nice, light, good carbonation. Not too wet or too dry.

35,104,industrialswill,4.41,"After spending 2 years stationed in Germany, I never thought I'd come home to find a moderately priced American beer that could compete taste wise with the German brew. Sam Adams was just being introduced as I returned to the USA and even though it tastes unlike what I drank overseas, it does a nice job of bridging the gap between the usual American swill and beers like Suttgart Hofbrau, Andechs, etc. My father would have enjoyed Sam Adams, he liked to talk about the beers of his time that were somewhat hoppier than the more watery stuff that is mass brewed in recent times for the Wonderbread and OscarMayer crowd. I think this beer is an outstanding choice and at a dollar a bottle it's an excellent bargain. It's plenty hoppy enough for me and 1 beer is actually enough for me to feel satisfied...  but I think I'll have another before going back out to tend the chickens.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Aroma is malty, slightly hoppy and some straw in there too. Has the slight skunky beer smell. Taste is ho-hum. Not much in the ""wow"" factor. It's clean and crisp but the flavor is lacking. Some bittering hops on the finish and a pretty smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is somewhat higher due to the fact multiples are easily had especially on a hot day or chilling at a ballpark. I just wouldn't be the one indulging.  Overall I have always wanted to like this beer, but it just isn't to my palate's agreement.

35,104,icetraxx,3.52,"A: Pours an amber/brown color that looks like a light grade of maple syrup. This beer pours a wonderful three finger super creamy head that is as white as snow, and it dissipates to a cap overtime while leaving some lacing on the glass.  S: Highly, highly muted. It's hard to get any aroma out of Boston Lager beside a hint of malt.  T: Bittering hops balance the relatively strong malt backbone of this easy-drinking lager. Don't expect tropical fruit and piney resins from the hops, they mostly only bring a balance to the party. If you search, there are some other flavors coming from the hops as well, but they are highly muted. A toasted malt backbone creates the easy drinking foundation for Boston Lager. The finish is rather dry, never sweet, and the bitterness subsides quickly. I would rather drink other beers (lagers and ales), but for what Boston Lager is, the taste is very good. Complexity is low and the everything about this beer is straight forward. I think this is as close as ""all things to all people"" as beer can get for those that respect craft beer.  M: Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. I think a head that stayed around longer would add a much desired creaminess.  D: I could drink a few of these before I would get bored. There really isn't that much to discover in this one.  O: Easy to find, easy to drink, and reasonably priced.

It pours a yellow gold, with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is much what you'd expect, but with a hint of spice. The taste is much more that I expected. I figured it would be a typical lager, and the lager is there, but add some nice hops, a hint of spice, and much more complexity than you'd ever expect out of something like this.

Very nice nose of biscuity malt with some spicy floral hops.  Solid Vienna character with more grainy malt coming through on the palate. It's nice to see some hop bitterness as well. If this bottle was less than 8 months old, I'm sure the hop flavor would be more forward. In any case, they are still hanging around, lending some fruit (berry?) flavors and a slight sourness. Nice clean bitterness on the back end.  The body is fairly substantial for the style. Medium carbonation and heft combine for a nice creamy mouthfeel.

S - Mostly caramel malts with very hint of hops. More faint the better.  T - Most important thing to a beer. A malty sweetness with a slight hit of hops in the background.  M - Somewhat creamy and light but very one dimensional.  D - Overall DAMN it is better than I remember. Smooth and drinkable this is the lovechild of their brewery. Very nice.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CBlack85,3.65,"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  Pours an amber/orange color with a foamy off white, nearly tan, colored head that lingers. Not much in the way of lacing.  Initial scent is of caramel malts, not much in the way of hops. Very clean and appealing, a little one dimensional, but pleasing none the less.  Nice malty flavor with an underlying sweetness. Hops are more noticable in the flavor than in the aroma, not overly hoppy, but definately noticable. Medium body, adequate carbination, easy to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Groenebeor,4.15,"Serving Type: Bottle  Appearance: Pours a light amber, clear, with a small white head. Leaves moderate lacing  Smells of lovely biscuity sweet pale malts, and noble hops.  Tastes like a traditional lager - plenty of hops, a not too sweet malt taste and perhaps a bit of citrus. Dark biscuit, some honey, some molasses.  Mouthfeel is good for this style.  Drinkability is perfect.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,HugePlume,3.86,"Served on tap at a bar.  A- Its been quite a while since I have had a sam adams since there are so many better west coast options available. Healthy amber hue, better than some weak Amber Ales. Not much head and no readily apparent lacing.  S- Nice malt smell with a whiff of floral hops coming through,  T- Well balanced with the hops and malt more prevalent than in other macro lagers.  M- Crisp and refreshing, but a little thin across the tongue.  D- Surprisingly drinkable, much better than any BMC offering,",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,nocheinsbitte,3.88,"much like everyone else, I have had this bier multiple times but I finally took the time to write a review.  A: A nice caramel color with a good heaad and mod lacing. A good looking bier. S: A nice mixture of malts with a little hops tossed in for good measure. Mild caramel flavor with some toasted bread included. T: Very enjoyable, malty taste that follows the aroma well. M: Easy to drink D: Can have many of these without issue  Overall, I really enjoy this bier. It is a good american craft bier that can hang with our imported brethren. I recommend it. Prosit!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,h00dak,3.83,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a dark caramel color with perfect clarity. It is active with carbonation, bubbles escape throughout the entire drink.  It is fairly smooth. Light to moderate carbonation. Malty sweet with a nice light, bready falvor. Not much hops presence. Great light taste for a session but also, enough flavor for sipping.  I have been having Winter Lager on a weekly basis for about 3 months now at applebees. Now they have switched to the Boston Lager on tap and there are many similarities. Color, flavor, the only big difference is the alcohol. Not as much flavor in the Boston Lager but it the malt character itself is almost identical.  This is a great Vienna Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SickGnar,3.68,"A: Bright and clear. A slightly dark copper color. Tight head that settles to a patchy cap and then a ring as it laces its way down.  S: Sweetish maltiness with hops firmly present yet hovering in the background.  T: Plenty of flavor, both in strength and complexity, while also being very clean and very clearly a lager. Slightly toasted and sweetish (almost caramel) malts with balancing hops that are a touch fruity, a bit spicy, and sort of cleansing.  M: Medium body, yet crisp. Excellent carbonation. Bright and clean. Balanced finish with slight lingering bite.  D: A good classic standby. Suberbly done - sort of an extra hoppy Vienna. Perhaps the quintessential ""gateway"" beer proselytizing the good brews.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JTahoe,3.62,"A - Clear gold with two finger head from vigorous pour, reduces fairly quickly to a cap with impressive sticky lace all over the glass.  S - Fairly malty with some hops coming through, slightly soapy off smell.  T - Full round flavor with a good amount of malt and grain character for a the style with crisp herbal hop character.  M - Light-full to medium-light body, fairly smooth, moderate carbonation.  A beer I have had many times over the years in many formats, but it is rarely ever a beer I reach for or think of due to its ubiquity. Very drinkable, and definitely a solid brew, though nothing special. It's a beer I only tend to go for in a pinch.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,seedsofchaos,3.3,"Appearance and smell aside, has anyone else ever thought that any Sam Adams product just tastes ""off""?

35,104,BeerMasterD,4.1,"12 oz. brown bottle, February notched on the label, #55 Chicago Gold 2003 award winner under tha cap. Its midnight and im bored so i decided, what the hell, im gonna review a boston lager. Poured a clear light amber into a 1987 Bud-Light Spuds Mackenzie pilsner glass, 2 finger head with good sticky retention, frosty looking and some wild carbonation going on here. Smells so very toasty, caramel sweet and hoppy. Tastes toasty malt, and hops, got a faint hint of caramel but not pronounced. Very well balanced and only slightly bitter that is enjoyable, really diggn' the smoothness of this blend of simple flavor. A good medium mouthfeel to this with the prefect amount of carbonation, i didnt know this was a 'vienna lager' before, but this is just a good beer. Ive had Boston Lager several times but this is the first time i really sat down to enjoy it and review, i realized there was alot i was missing out on. It seems though to be so hit or miss with the bottled version anyway, sometimes its spot on other times its very off. Either way ill be getting this again, highly drinkable, i already want another and i havent completely finished this glass yet. Sessionable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,TheMightyGUEST,4.45,"Had this on tap at a Max and Erma's location in my town. It was served just chilled at cellar temperature, which is something I've not seen another local bar do. Usually beer in these parts is served way too cold!  Appearance - A dark red, almost a lovely maroon. The head was two fingers and sticky, a soft cream color.  Smell - Toasty with malts. Slightly floral, I think.  Taste - Well balanced. Bitter doesn't overpower, but instead all the flavors are working together. Definitely kind of toasty, as was indicated by the smell. As I said before, the best way to describe this is balanced. No one flavor dominates to the point of throwing the drink off.  Mouth feel - Oh man, this was creamy. I've always wondered what people meant when they called a beer creamy but now I understand.  Overall, I'd highly recommend this as a session beer. It stands up well against other beers, and has a comparable ABV for long nights. The flavor and aroma are nice and warming, but it's got a refreshing aspect that would work well in summer heat. This is definitely an all-year beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Maltoftheearth,4.1,"I want to be hard on this beer since its mass marketed, but let's call a spade a spade- it's great beer.  A: Clear light caramel brown color. Nice head that won't last past the first two sips.  S: Should bottle this smell. Subtle malts with sweet floral undertones. Very nice.  T: Not a lot of hops, but balances well with the semi-sweet caramel malty flavor. Very nice for a lager no doubt.  F: Not to much here, but hits you in the right places. Finishes slightly bitter.  D: About as drinkable as a beer gets. I like it because it's good if you're in for 2 or 20.  You will not ponder this beer like you would a big stout, but it's at the top of it's class in lager. A super star in the world of beers. A classic.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JerseyPaul,3.95,"Appearance: Clear, light brownish/amber color with plenty of carbonation; white head dissipates quickly but leaves very good lacing.  Smell: Sweet caramel malt with some biscuit notes; hops also slightly present, possibly citrus and/or herbal  Taste: Nice caramel malt sweetness comes out up front; finishes smooth & crisp with light hoppiness; everything ties together nicely  Mouthfeel: Medium body; good carbonation; smooth & light but not watered down  Drinkability: Solid, but not spectacular, lager; ABV allows this to be a good session beer; nice go-to beer since it's readily available at most bar/restaurants  Overall, Boston Lager is a very respectable beer. It's a good selection if I'm out and cannot find a new beer to try. It has enough positive qualities to put it way ahead of the mass produced, watered down macros that dominate the beer scene.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Head quickly dissipates into a thin film and leaves decent lacing.  S: Mild ans subtle sweet malts and hops tie together quite well. Nothing else to note.  T: Fronts with caramel & roasted malts and hops follow up right after.  M: medium-light bodied and medium carbonation. It's quite creamy and smooth while leaving a sticky bitter feeling after.  D: Pleasant lager, but nothing special or worthwhile IMO. It's very expensive for what you get.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,OldRaspi,4.2,"From bottle into a 16oz glass:  A: Amber in color, light head.  S: Fairly straightforward smell, light hops dominated by a sweet malt. Smell kind of flat.  T: Mostly malt followed by a nice rush of hops. A nice mix, very crisp. Hint of sour towards the end.  M: Medium/Light bodied, good carbonation. Nice bite.  D: Goes down smooth, everything about this beer is great.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Caramel malts are very evident, but the hops do a nice job balancing.  Taste- Slightly sweet with just the perfect touch of hops. Has a roasted character to it and the hops linger. Definitely a good beer, but not perfect either.  Mouthfeel- Crisp and smooth with a light, easy drinking but not too watery body.  Drinkability- Would make a wonderful session beer.

35,104,californiakulak,4.2,I had beer in my kegerator so I after 165 beer I finally decided to review it. Poured it into my Samuel Adams pint glass.  A. Dark ruby/amber color with a nice head and decent lacing.  S. Rich malt aromas. Bready and earthy.  T. Caramel and roasted flavors. Some hops as well. Very good beer. Also some sweet brown sugar flavors.  M. Thin like it should be. Very carbonated and a slight bit of bitterness.  D. Well I finished a 15.5 gallon keg without much help so pretty drinkable.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Josievan,4.3,"Appearance: Darker color than one might expect from such a lager, kind of a deep redish-orange. Head and lacing are abundant, helped by my sloshing pour into a weizen glass.  Smell: Hops hit you first, and there's malt in the background, too.  Taste: It's definitely hoppy, but well-balanced from the malt. There's a sweetness that's coming through this time that I don't remember ever tasting before.  Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium bodied, with just a little hop bite. Doesn't seem to suffer from excess carbonation like some Sam Adams beers do.  Drinkability: You really aren't going to find a more sessionable beer, especially one as readily available.  Notes: It's somewhat uncommon for a brewery's flagship beer to be one of their best offerings, but that's definitely the case with Boston Lager. In fact, Boston Lager might be my favorite Sam Adams beer. I here that this beer is sublime straight from the brewery, so I make it my mission to visit someday.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Chico1985,3.93,"Pours very light brownish-orange with a head that starts out big white and fluffy, turns into a small layer that sits on top the whole time leaving decent lacing. Not too much for the smell here, oats, malts, a little bit of light fruit..maybe orange. Taste is smooth and malty, bready and light fruit (apricot comes to mind). A little metallic tasting at times but seemingly random. Tastes a bit like a macro, but a big step above that. Mouthfeel is okay, refreshing, high amount of carbonation. Obviously not the most exciting beer in the world, but always a pleasure to drink for me. One of the best choices if you're looking for a beer you can find in basically every bar. A nice session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,generalnotsew,4.46,"A: The head and coloring on this is flawless. Beautiful thick rich creamy head that has staying power. Never seen a head like this on macro lagers. Color is not far off from an IPA.  S: Sweet and sour bitter malts, hops and barley. There is a lot going on here. Nice pilsner smell without the gagging.  T: Great smooth maltiness with a surprising amount of hops. Don't get me wrong it isn't hoppy by any means but there is something there you don't get in many of the style except maybe Prima Pils. A bit sweet and a bit sour and very tasty.  M: Perhaps the carbonation could be toned down a hair but seems to fit the lager style. Still pretty great.  D: Only 4.5% abv. You can have loads at a friends BBQ. Very refreshing. I could almost drink this in place of water.  I have had this a couple times and decided I finally needed to review it. I was prepared to not like this. For one I don't care for lagers and 2 I was considering Sam Adams to be basically macro. I thought at the least it would be tolerable and a bit better than BMC pretty close to PBR quality.  But what I didn't count on was really liking this beer. I don't mean I think it is ok but I think it is great. Lager or no lager I have to rank this up there. My apologies to Jim Koch. He made a great brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,degerbah,3.38,"Very clear light brown without much head, but plenty of carbonation. Sweet malty aroma with just a hint of earthy hop smell. The taste is maltier than I expected with the aforementioned hop taste present as well. Slightly flatter than I'd like, and not as easy to drink as a macro-style light lager. Way more flavorful though. Most reminds me of a Yuengling traditional lager as opposed to a Great Lakes Elliot Ness. I feel like if I were drinking it at normal macro tap temp (33 degrees) then it would be an easier to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ch473,2.24,"Poured about 42 degrees F from bottle into a wide, round wine glass. Nice big foamy head. Good amber color.  Smell is not very impressive. Some malt and sweetness but not much else.  I've had this beer before but never really studied it. I'm surprised how watery it tastes. There's a tiny bit of bitterness and mint and some sweetness but not much else. It's almost sour.  Mouthfeel is not very good. Good carbonation on the back of the tongue but mostly watery.  I could only drink a lot of these if they were cheaper. This beer is sour and watery despite its nice color and I can't say it's much better than any pale American macro lager. I was disappointed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Genuine,3.74,"This was one of my first beers a couple years ago so, I figured I'd try it again and compare.  Poured from the bottle into a clean Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A decent head formed from an aggressive pour. Head was a nice white, not bright white...but yet, not an off white.  Head sat ontop of a golden/orangish body.  Smell - This one smells better than the rest of Sam's brews this past 09 season. I'm happy about that.  Taste - Definitely not what I remembered. I've grown to really like heavy hopped beers so this one tasted lighter to me. But, I will say that the hops do make a bit of an appearance near the end. Just enough. They come out more as the beer warms up. This beer is better when it warms.  Mouthfeel - I thought it was pretty light...almost like water. That was my first impression. Now I feel like it has a very slight medium body to it.  Drinkability - this one is not hard to drink. Not sure if I'd have more just because...I think i'd rather have a SN, but this would be my go to choice at a resturant if nothing else is available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,brownbeer,4.03,"This lager has a nice, amber color which sets it apart right away.  It has a nice hop/malt balance in the nose with citrus and pine blending with caramel malt.  Taste is similar to the nose, medium bodied with earth, citrus, and caramel.  A very solid lager that goes well with a number of foods or just as a tasty session beer. A good standby for restaurants.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

There was also some grassy notes, but also some hops and malt as well.  T-Much like the nose a nice balance between hops and malt. It also had some grassy notes as well.  M-Kind of thick with moderate carbonation.  D-I would say this is a session beer all the way, it has a low abv. and it isn't very complex or too hoppy.  Overall, I have enjoyed this beer the very few times I have drank it. I can't imagine what it would have been like to try this beer when it originally was released, I'm sure it would have been mind blowing at the time.

Small, tan-white head but nice lacing. Deep honey color and no haze.  After allowing it to warm a bit some malt, caramel and a hint of orange peel come though in the nose.  Nice malty, hoppy-pine start with a slightly-sweet grainy flavour. Really quite a bit of flavour for a mass-produced lager.  Medium body with nice carbonation.

It is my beer of choice when I go to restaurants that do not seem to have a selection of craft beers. It has a thick and frothy off white almost tan head with a nice amount of staying power and lace. The body is red amber with a slight yellow color to it. The aroma is that of mild hops and bread. It has breakfast cereal like grainy taste. A high quality malt flavored beer with just the right amount of hops.

The head was a smidgen light, but it had decent retention and excellent lacing.  S: Nice balance here. Earthy hops meet bready/biscuity malts. It's not very deep, but it's a welcoming scent.  T: Ah, this follows the smell, and it works better on the tongue. The hops were a little more center-place, with a real earthy character coming to the center. It always finished on the bread tones, though. Good stuff.  M: Lighter side of a medium body with good carbonation. It does what it's supposed to do.  D: Hey, it's a lighter beer with good affordability. Drinking a few of these is no challenge for me at all.  Overall/notes: I've had quite few of these over the years, and there's a good reason.

35,104,MetalHopHead6,4,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager poured light clear amber with a thick two-finger head. It left a glass-full of lace.  The smell and flavor were sweet and malty but balanced by more bitterness than usual for a lager, which provided a thick bready feel. I prefer the Boston Ale and was disappointed that the Lager was included in the Winter Sampler; however, as Lagers go, Sam Adams is great. It's a great choice at restaurants that don't have a wide selection of craft beers and it was an unexpected pleasure on a cold afternoon.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Fairly significant head.  S: Balance between the citrus of the hops and the roasted breadiness of the malt. Nothing special, though.  T: This is a solid beer. Nice balance between hops and malt. I know people have said this a thousand times, but you can always get Sam Adams Boston lager on tap at nearly every bar, and it is often the only palatable choice.  M: Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel.

Nice big smell: wheat, bread, yeast, a little sweetness and even a touch of spice if I'm not mistaken.  Lots of flavour for a lager. Tastes darker than it looks. Some roasted malt, wheat, a touch of sweetness and a fairly bitter, dry finish.  Very nice feel: great medium body with an appropriate moderate carbonation.  I can see how this is the biggest-selling craft beer in America. There are enough similarities to macro and micro to keep everyone happy. Good to see a flavourful beer gain so much popularity.

A vigorous pour resulted a 3 finger creamy off white dense, thick, pillowy head. Thick and pretty impressive looking. Golden amber Nice, good amount of lacing being left down the sides. Crystal clear, orangish-golden amber in color.  Light biscuity yeast and sweet malitiness. Sweet with a slight spicyness. Some hops are present. Its not the strongest in the nose department, but It does smell decent.  Similar to the nose, lots of maltiness. Caramel malt, and pale malts upfront,with a good hop finish. Small bite and light spice.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good hoppy, slightly dry finish.

A: Pours a light amber with a thin pearly white head that leaves lots of good lacing. S: Smells predominately of doughy, bready yeast with some faint hops and sweet caramel. T: Very bready up front followed by a faint hoppy bitter. Finishes with a sweet honey/brown-sugar taste. Very malty, but you can tell the hops are there. Okay flavor but light. M: Good carbonation up front that nips at your tongue. Finish is dry but thin. Medium/light in body, and the aftertaste is strange combination of sweet/sour that is a bit off-putting. D: There are many other six-packs I would rather pick up instead of this one. However, this beer is not horrible, and was in fact better than I expected.

Way back, Boston Ale was pretty available and I always preferred it to the lager. I am, after all, an ale man. I also don't like that this is the defacto ""craft beer"" at many places. However, don't let that detract from this beer. It's good. Pours a clear amber. Mix of floral hops and toasted bready malts. Taste is much of the same. It's good and sessionable with the low ABV. It's a good Vienna Lager, but I'm spoiled on Eliot Ness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

(Laser etched bottom is a really cool feature on the Boston Lager glass).  Smell: Sweet, caramel malts and a good deal of crisp citrusy hops.  Taste: Lots of flavor in this beer. Much like the smell, the sweet malts are bold up front which are balanced nicely with a decent amount of spicy, citrusy hops. The finish is mildly bitter and ever so slightly dry making you come back for more.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with crisp carbonation, smooth roll around the tongue and a very clean finish.  Drinkability: As long as I'm drinking from one of the custom glasses, keep them coming. It really does make that big of a difference. Opens up the nose, lightens up the body, makes an above average beer out of this one.  Comment: Poured out a fresh bottle into one of the new-fangled Boston Lager glass.

Looks really refreshing.  Flowery hops aromas dominate, pine and zest accents. Barely noticable malt.  Nice balance of malt and hops in the flavor - toast and an indistinct bitter crispness. A nice, dry beer, crisp, refreshing, and clean finishing.  Light but present, with noticable carbonation which gives just a little bit of ""bite"" to accentuate the dryness of the beer.

Feels average in body, with a mild but appropraite carbonation.  Easy to drink, easy to session, easy to come back to.

Bottle, poured into a pint glass. Nice, copper color that you'd expect from a Vienna lager. The head is fairly white and also very thin. It dissipates very quickly leaving behind a little head.  The aroma is very malty with a little hoppiness. Its very sweet. Drinking it, it tastes pretty much exactly how it smells which is a good thing.

Malt forms a solid backbone giving it balance. Finishes slightly dry.  Medium bodied and appropriate level of carbonation.  Overall, very refreshing and drinkable.

35,104,BARFLYB,3.35,"12oz bottle into a Samuel Adams Boston Lager pint glass, I knew I bought this for some reason. Thanks Horacio.  Maybe it's the glass, but SABL looks great in it. Perhaps it's the beautiful frothy vanilla white head that graces the top with some thickness in the foam. A nice mixture of hazy orange, gold and bronze in the liquid. Small patches of lace and a lasting cap over some time.  Smells like a Vienna Lager with just a boatload of sweet caramel malt. I don't think i've smelled this much caramel in beer in a while. A nice spike of toasted malt and some spicy hops to go along with it. The nose is bold for a lager I have to admit. Overall sweet and inviting.  A nice crisp lager with a big sweet caramel twist. The caramel is not as big as the nose would suggest, but it's large. Boston has a touch of hop flavor that is more grassy/earthy in flavor. When it warms some vegetal flavors emerge turning me off a lot, kinda like rotting food, drink this cold. Started great ended crappy, it happens.  Big malty body medium in build and sweet, just a sense of bitterness. Carbonation is there but I don't notice it all the none. Alcohol is not present. A strange aftertaste when this beer warms which ruined the whole thing for me.  Would not mind trying this on tap to see any difference, the bottle seems to be a one and done for me as the malts seem to dissipate into the other ingredients not so well with warming.

Spicy, earthy hops take the lead, with a nice malt background and some light yeastiness.  T: The taste follows the scent, for the most part. The hops are mildly bitter, with a nice orange and spice quality. The malt is quite present and provides a good contrast to the hops.  M: This is a nice crisp, clean lager. The carbonation is excellent and the body is a bit light.  D: This is a nice refreshing lager, and I'm not really a big lager fan.

The grassy hops provide the predominate flavor - but that's the key - flavor. Not much bitterness to this beer. Very smooth, and very refreshing. The hops linger on the tongue for a long time.  Mouthfeel: Full, and good carbonation. Carbonation's a little high and prickly.  Drinkability: I'm amazed I'd never really tried this before.

This is bottom line good beer. There is nothing unwelcomed or offensive. Nothing is there that is not supposed to be there. Clean, perfectly balanced. Goes with antyhing you are eating.

Poured into my Sam Adams Boston Lager glass that I use for pretty much all of my reviews.  A - Clear orangeish amber with a one finger fluffy light tan head. Good retention and that sticky lacing that you find only in the finest microbrews.  S - Very mellow and subdued, mainly malt and slight spiciness. Hints of bread and citrus.  T - Bitter hoppiness up front followed by some spice and citrus notes. Very nice breadiness to it that sort of evens out the spicy and hoppy flavors. Very very well balanced. More hops here than I find in most lagers. Some sips I taste the hops and spice, other sips I taste the biscuit and malt more.  M - Very smooth and light-medium bodied. The spicy flavor and level of carbonation give it a great bite at the back of your throat. Crisp.  D - Light alcohol content, tasty, and smooth. Not overpowering. This is the perfect session beer.

35,104,BlackBearForge,4.1,"Boston Beer Companies flagship beer, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now as I've had many of these over the years.  Boston Lager pours a lovely deep golden amber with flashing highlights and a really nice off-white head that leaves tons of complex sticky lacing in it's wake.  The aroma is of really nice mellow amber malts reminiscent of Oktoberfest beers to me with a nice spicy scent from the ample hop bill.  The flavor is perfect for the style, rich mildly sweet amber malts, lightly toasted and bready with a slightly nutty caramel note. The hops are pleasantly spicy as per the continental style and the finish is pleasantly bitter, very nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel is on the medium side of light, crisp, smooth and very nicely carbonated, not too much and not too little.  What can I say, Vienna Lagers are very drinkable just like their Marzen cousins and Sam Adams Boston Lager is no exception. In a way I'm glad I hadn't reviewed it before now, it was probably the first true craft beer I ever tasted and I didn't even know it at the time.

This is a good lager that goes down smoothly and is enjoyable from first to last gulp.Nice ABV keeps drinkability up. One of the most popular lagers around for a reason.

35,104,ProudGreen89,3.85,"12oz bottle poured into sam adams boston lager glass.  A-fairly clear deep amber with golden highlights, fluffy 1 finger white head with sticky lacing that leaves rings to show the progress of the beer.  S-well balanced aroma of flowery hops, sweet malts with citrusy notes, hints of bread come through.  T-Bitter spiced flowery hops, hearty yet sweet malt with an orange rind background. A biscuity flavor really ties all the flavors together. The nice thing about this beer is that each sip brings a new flavor to the palate, sometimes you get a strong taste of hops, other times youll get mostly malts which adds a certain complexity to the beer.  M-medium-light bodied, crisp and refreshing, an oily texture that allows the flavors to linger.  D-An outstanding session beer. I cant get enough of the boston lager, it reminds me of why i enjoy sam adams so much.  Overall one of the better beers to come from the sam adams lineup. The style is nice and rounded and this beer sticks to that style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,craftaholic,3.86,"Appearance: Had this one on tap at Applebee's while waiting for my company to arrive. Has a nice copper golden hue with a thick cap of a head.  Smell: There are some defining floral hops in there as well as a sweet caramelized malt. There is also a bit of biscuity undertones that round it out as a nice balanced aroma.  Taste: Very malty up front and then the oily hops work their way in to compliment the malt and bring out some citrusy characteristics. It plays a tug of war as to which youre tasting as the hops and malt flip flop throughout the duration of the session with a biscuity yeast to act as a mediator.  Mouthfeel: Fluffy yet oily with a lingering somewhat metallic aftertaste.  Drinkability: I would say this defines the word ""session beer"", low abv, packed with flavor but nothing overpowering.  Overall: Wouldn't call myself a lager fan but if I had to choose one to go with this would be in. Its balanced, a bargain of a price, can hold its own against macro, and readily available at many places. Would be perfect on a hot day but did just the trick while passing some time on the barstool.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Bitterbill,3.98,"I had this on tap at Sanford's Grub and Pub.  A nice copper pour with a small head of foam and a bit of lacing.  The smell is a light mix of hops and malt with nothing standing out but works well as it is a Lager.  The taste is lightly malty, slightly more assertive hop wise...a well balanced Lager with enough taste to keep me satisfied. Good stuff.  On the light end of medium bodied with medium carbonation.

Very general and simple but the taste is great and refreshing. The feel is smooth with a little carbonation.  D: A really good and classic brew.

Smell is of light hops and some sweet malts. Nothing overpowering.  Taste is a nice blend of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. It seams pretty well balanced.  Mouthfeel is fairly medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Nice a crisp on the tongue.  Drinability is quite good. It goes down smooth and is a pretty tasty brew.

35,104,Kristing,4.1,"Poured into the characteristic Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass, the colour is amber and the head is white and creamy. Even though I am not in general a big fan of lagers, especially not the popular commercial ones, I rather like this one. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a lovely caramel tone.  This makes for a beer that has the freshness of a lager, but with some of the mellow taste and aroma of a pale ale.

Taste...there's hops and smooth lagering, what else could a beer drinker want? Mouthfeel, wonderful volume and hop notes tempered with malt that nothing else on the planet could compare in any lager. Drinkability....if you're a complete wuss then you'll hate this beer, otherwise you probably don't fear the robust hops and malt.

Tastes like malt, citrus, hops, sweet caramel and overall well balanced; had a slight bitter finish, but no aftertaste. Medium body, crisp with light carbonation that goes down smooth and slick on the tongue with decent lacing.  Sam Adam's flagship beer is very drinkable, both on tap and from the bottle. It's very good when it's cold and also gets better as it warms and sits. Even though some people put this in the ""mass market"" class now, I think it's still a very good beer that's light, tasty and enjoyable. I still enjoy this brew after many years of drinking it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The head fills one finger worth then fades into a thin white layer at the top. The carbonation looks even and strong, but not abundant. The aroma is light and smells of medium roasted malts, definitely on the sweet side with a biscuit flavor. The smell of cereal is prominent as well.  Glug glug glug  Smooth and mellow mouth feel and flavor. The taste is sweet malts with a bitter edge that's just so well balanced, making this a very easy drinking lager.

Lager hops dominates the nose, with softer notes of autumn, earth and wet grass. Eh, pretty soft smelling. Better smelling than a Budweiser, at least.  T- Again, big hops flavor, with mild sweetness in the back there. Simple tasting, but quite good.  M- Medium bodied and very smooth, good carbonation in this guy, too. Bigger in my mouth than I thought it would be.  D- For a guy who doesn't dig hops, I could easily drink a ton of these. Very drinkable, a great beer for pizza, wings and Sunday football.

This is a great beer, one of my favorites.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,WalrusJockey,3.68,"A- light golden color. I don't know if Sam Adams calls this a Vienna, but it is one the light end of the Vienna Lager color scale. Head is thick and nearly white.  S- fairly hoppy nose, again especially for the style. Not much in the way of cookie/cracker/biscuit malt aromas, but some malt is also noticeable in the nose.  T- some forward malt sweetness, falling back into a hoppier finish. Swallow is clean and the aftertaste, finally, has the cookie goodness that ""Vienna Lager"" promises.  M- light body for the style, fairly light body over all. Also, the ""American""ization, the added hops make it less smooth than the style normally is.  D- decent. To be honest, most Vienna Lagers I can only drink one of at a time, because the sweetness becomes too much for me to enjoy, so this avoids that, but I still don't especially want to session it, because it honestly isn't that noticeable.  For a Vienna Lager, I would say that this is a pretty piss-poor version of the style. For a mass-market lager, I would say it is about the best you can hope for.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Anthony1,3.33,"Pours a into a pint glass with a light copper color and a big three-inch head - and that's just half the bottle. Foam really is a big pile of foam, and just fizz, and it leaves a good deal of lace. Smell is hoppier than your average lager, but not particularly strong.  Taste largely follows the smell, but with an unexpected caramel sweetness in the aftertaste that eventually resolves into more hop bitterness. Quite complex, especially for a mass-market lager. Mouthfeel is a little bit thicker and stickier than your average lager, almost approaching what I'd expect in a porter, but not cloying. The character of this one really changes with temperature - the sweet notes come out substantially more as the beer warms. At colder temperatures, it seems more like just a hoppy lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

When i'm thru town i always pick up a case of this brew as it's a nice change of pace and it's a quality product that i enjoy.  A - It pours a golden-orange color with a white fluffy head that went away fairly fast. it does leave some lacing around throughout the entire drink.  S - It's not an overpowering smell, some malt smell does become pronounced after a good sniff along with some hop bitterness.  T - better than it smells, it has some bitterness from the hops, but there is the sweetness/carmel taste of the malt that makes this beer very enjoyable.  M - gets better through the taste, initally thin, thickens up nicely and goes down smooth.  D - good taste with a solid feel makes this beer go down quite well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Good retention and also a nice amount of lacing. Carbonation looks high. Nose has a some nice fruity sugars to it, white grapes, mildly citric hopping. Actually much sweeter and fruitier smelling than I seemed to recall. Flavor has the same white grape sweetness with some toasted malts thrown into the mix on the midpalate. Lightly grassy hops and a mild floral finish. Maybe a bit simple for a lot of BAs, but all in all I feel this is an extremely solid brew. Probably more interesting than the ubiquitous ""amber ale"" I see at so many microbrewers Medium body with a nice medium carbonation that matches the crispness and light fruity flavors. Extremely solid, I actually will probably start to buy this when I am at places with a limited selection. Glad I revisited this, easy to see why Boston Brewing.

A deep amber and mahogany hue with a frothy white head that dissipates to a thin cap and leaves a surprisingly good deal of sticky lace behind. Aromas are caramel and toasted malt, metallic, and a mild spice. Flavors are similar, with a mouthfeel that is lighter bodied and crisp in carbonation.

It lacks the major aspects I am used to in the average lager, but definitely has something special that I think makes it what a lager should really be.  Has a light golden color and a head that billows over the lips of the glass. Nice retention of the head too.  Smells a bit hoppy, but just as malty and seems like a good balance.  Tastes balanced too. More hoppy than the average lager but this beer has great balance!  I will buy more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Gives out notes of pine and citrus. The finish is bready, but very balanced, and slightly bitter. Very nice!  M: Medium bodied (or a bit lighter). Very smooth overall.

A: A medium golden copper color that tells you it's not a BMC. Fluffy white head and minimal glass lacing.  S: Bready malts with a real nice floral citrus hop nose. Not overly complex.  T: Bready biscuity malts shine through first the soon get complimented by a nice floral hop flavor. Some grass and light citrus (lemon or pineapple) follow and the bready malts finish out. A slight bitterness ends the beer with a nice hop bite. This is a solid beer and one that every craft lover should look for when all other crafts are not available. Very enjoyable.  M: Medium to light, a bit bitter with the nice hop bite but ultimately just a smooth drinking experience.  D: High, move on.  This is a beer that every beer lover should enjoy as it's very readily available. When all other crafts are not around, I happily order a Boston Lager and enjoy it.

I did not expect these floral, citrusy, with a hint of corriander smell of hops. I have never, EVER smelt this smell from SA Boston Lager out of a bottle. Ever. I was so amazed that I had to order another just to make sure he didn't pour me the wrong beer.  Taste: Unfortunately, the smell was much more complex than the taste was. Taste was just as out of the bottle, but with a slightly more bit of floral hoppiness. Imagine this beer out of a bottle, but with a shotglass of Stone Pale Ale. Malty, yeasty, bready backbone, with a slight floral/herbal hop presence on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied. Two pints went down very smoothly, with room for 1/2 a pint my friend couldn't finish because he had already had too much to drink at that point.  Drinkability: For $2.99 at a large public gathering, and the same price they would have charged for a BMC, very reasonable.

I can say that -- without a doubt -- this is my favorite SA beer. I know that the company might not get a fair shake around here all the time, but they produce quality beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,ritzkiss,3.93,"Couple of 12oz bottles. Pour is a darker than average golden lager (sitting next to a Heineken it looks positively bold!). A little light on the head, only about a finger that dies down leaving just a slight ring of lace on the top of the glass.  Nose is light and sweet. Just a hint of grassy hops hidden deep in there.  This has got to be one of the more solid lagers out there. Sweet caramel malts which hold back from being overly sickly sweet, actually a bit of a light hop presence in the finish, a bit more body than your average macro lager, no corn or adjunct profile, easy drinking, goes down with anything.  Would definitely drink this again, a great beer for when non-BAs come over, drink it all night on the patio while BBQing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kegger22,3.71,"Poured a crystal clear amber with a respectable head that faded quickly to a collar. There is not much of an aroma, I got a vague lager smell. Malty sweetness and a caramel flavor. Mouth feel was light bodied with a adequate carbonation. Very drinkable, this would make a good session beer. Solid effort, comes in second to GL Eliot Ness in it's class.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,biegaman,3.78,"This beer is a gleaming, coppery shade of auburn that almost reminds one of autumn leaves. There is an adamant stream of carbonation that seems virtually infinite. The beer's appearance is also well-proportioned: a terrific amount of cream-white mousse tops off the last couple inches and ensures all those little bubbles are packed in air-tight.  If you're used to plain, mass-produced lagers than the aroma on the SABL might just knock your socks off. If you're already familiar with what craft beer has to offer then chances are you'll consider it nothing more than average. It has a delicate (but delicious) sweetness with notes of toasty, grainy bread and a 'green' Noble-hop pungency. Mmmm.  That hoppiness is uncharacteristically assertive for a Vienna lager (then again this is an American rendition). It lends very subtle - but definite - vegetable, floral and citrusy notes, the result being a patented flavour I can always identify with this beer. The malts, of which there is a satisfyingly sufficient amount, smack of caramel and freshly-baked whole grain bread. It's like a sweet pastry topped with citrus shavings.  As well as the impressive amount of aromas and flavours, this has (especially for a lager) a lexicon of textures as well. The cookie-like maltiness, doughy and chewy, is typical of pale and Munich malts. It makes the beer filling and provides a lovely residual sweetness. The Vienna malt contributes a little dose of richness and enhances the depth of the flavour as much as it does the deepness of the colour. It's equally refreshing as it is flavourful.  Like the Märzen/Oktoberfest beers that popularized the style, Vienna Lagers make excellent fall-time drinks. Their crisp hop bitterness and nearly limitless quaffability make them great candidates for those still considerably warm autumn days while the reddish-brown colour, the more flavourful maltiness and filling body make them also well suited to the cooler nights that inevitably follow.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Wisconsin,3.98,"12 ounce bottle into a pint glass  A - Pours a nice golden, amber body with about a one finger head that is white and fluffy in appearance. There is plenty of carbonation that is also present and rising to the top. Good head retention also.  S - Nothing that really smacks your right in the nose but there is a solid smell nonetheless. Malts and some hops along with a slight citrus smell.  T - Malts and a faint amount of hops initially with a slight bitterness and some caramel and toffee notes. Well balanced overall.  M - Medium bodied with an ample amount of carbonation to balance the malts and hops with the caramel and toffee notes.  D - This beer has it all as far as balance and appeal to the masses.

The head leaves decent lacing as it dissipates quickly.  Smell: Nice hoppy notes. Grassy smells in the background.  Taste: Has a nice hoppy bitterness. Tastes good, but leaves a little to be desired.  Mouthfeel: Kind of thin with just a bit too much carbonation.  Drinkability: A solid brew.

35,104,BattleRoadBrewer,4.15,"Served cold into a standard pint glass from a 12 oz brown bottle.  Pours a bright copper color forming a nice off white head.  Aroma is slightly sweet with a notable spicy and herbal hop presence.  Flavor is fabulous. This beer is the perfect lager, I've never had a better example of the style. It's got a bold malty flavor and fine dry finish.  Mouthfeel is good, but a bit too sharp and sparkling. I'd enjoy it if it had a softer bite, maybe if it had a bit more body.  Drinkability is great. This is a fine session beer for me, loads of flavor without being heavy. I don't remember it being this good the last time I had it, maybe it came from a different brewery or was fresher. Worth buying by the case.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Looks like it's leaving a decent lace. Nothing to complain about here, just looks like a good beer. Maybe a little more head on it.  S: German malts and hops is what I get. A little sweet, a little bitter. Kinda a little everything which is the problem. This is not a strong beer. It isn't the perfect smell either, just a little off to me. But well balanced.  T: This tastes a little off to me. I can't tell what it is, maybe skunked? I don't know. I know SABL, and this isn't it. This tastes awful bitter in a bad way.

I havent had this beer in a while and I am so impressed by the aroma.  The taste is balanced, with exceptional interwoven notes of fruits and bitters, currants, black cherries, smooth bready flavors, wonderful bitter finish leaving the palate dry.  Mouthfeel is perfect with the beer. Not thick but not think, a nice balance and I would say that sums up the beer. Wonderfully balanced.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Carbination is tingly and mouthfeel is medium to light. Nose is slightly hoppy as well as the taste. More hops are in the taste than what I am use to in a lager...nice. Finish is very crisp, mildly bitter. I am picking up a bit on diacetyl as well which is a fault but it is not distracting. Overall a good beer, nothing super exciting but this sample seems to be lacking some of the hop character that I had with other bottles...perhaps this one has been sitting around too long.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mwa423,3.88,"My relationship with Boston Lager has been in an interesting one. I used to hate it, then really love it, and now I'm back to somewhere in the middle. For $2.49 for a 22 oz at the store around the corner, when I just want 1 beer at a reasonable price, this one is it.  A - Pours an exceptionally clear copper with a frothy white head that dies down to a heavy lacing that sticks the entire way down the glass.  S - Helloooo malt. A noseful of sweet malt and really nothing else.  T - The taste is a mixture of bittersweet malt, but a bit of hop bite at the end. Lots of caramel and toffee flavors that I would expect out of a lightly hopped pale ale.  M/D - Very rich mouthfeel for a lager, it makes up for the weakness of most lagers. The drinkability is good because it isn't complex enough that you'll mind putting down a session of them, but there is a lot for when you just want a beer over some paperwork or something.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,burnerfinger,4.23,"ahhh another old friend. Been drinking Sam Adams for years with my brother Pat back in Los Angeles. Honestly Boston Lager was one of the the first serious beers I ever drank.  A: Poured from the 1 pint 8 oz bomber to my tumbler. Use by date on the bottle: Oct 09. Deep golden amber color - not too clear. nice. A bit shy on the head: maybe a full finger of head that settled quickly - no lacing to speak of at all.  S: Very very light aroma of a sweet malitness. After it's warmed a bit I can just barely smell the alcohol.  T: I can taste the malitness a bit reminiscent of honey- bread as well as a bit of a hops balance. Of course nothing like an IPA , just a light suggestion of hops by comparison. but a nice balance to the malty sweetness.  M: LOVE this - medium to full body. Carbonation dead on. As this lager warms, the hops take a backseat and the maltiness really steps up to the plate.  D: What with the modest alcohol this will be very drinkable. I would Definitely want another.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GJ40,4,Sampled from a 12oz bottle in one of those funky Sam Adams pint glass. Best by date was Dec 09.  A - Copper with a significant beige head. It fit into the Sam Adams glass perfectly. The head doesn't stay around long but it leaves some lacing behind as the glass empties.  S - Toasted malt with a mild caramel scent. It also had a fruity hop aroma that I didn't remember from this beer.  T - Semi sweet with a bready caramel flavor. Not much bitterness or hop flavor coming through.  M - A creamy consistency with a low to moderate carbonation.  D - A reliable and widely available beer that's a good option when nothing better is offered. It also makes a good starter for a BMC drinker looking to make the switch.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,techtatu,3.83,"Poured a nice amber color and about a finger and half width of head. Nice aroma to it. I could smell the hops but it was not over powering, just right. It had a sweet hint to it with spicy note at the end, and quite filling for a lager in my book. However very smooth and not too carbonated, which was very surprising considering it came from a bottle.  This is a beer that I would drink at my local bar, and enjoy with a good meal.

35,104,cavedave,3.65,"Pour produces a golden, clear fill of my pilsner glass, topped by a two inch off white head that dissipates quickly to a cap and leaves nice lace on the glass.  Smell is a bready, yeasty, sweet, yet slightly sour, aroma, with hints of herb and alcohol in the background.  Taste is a well balanced blend of bread, herbs, and a bitter finish that lingers only briefly. Not complex, not astounding, not super delicious, but a good flavor that beckons one back for the next sip.  Mouthfeel is as good as any lager I have tried, and I only don't rate it higher because I am not a lager lover, and have not tried very many craft lagers.  Drinkability is excellent, and I imagine a lager lover would drink this 'til the snowflakes fly, perhaps longer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,gfreed,2.78,"Always drinkable but never impressive-- that's how I tend to approach this beer. I remember when it was first produced and how it was a powerful antidote to everyday macro beer. Then, it was great. Now, it's rather dull compared to the micros that have sprung up everywhere around it: the color is akin to the hardwood floor in the average New England house, the aroma is better than the old man sitting next to you on the subway; the taste beats a plate of brussels sprouts. The fizz is nice on a hot night.  I categorize this as an escape hatch, much like beer from New Belgium: I'll drink it when the alternatives are Bud, Miller and the like, but it's not a beer I'd seek out for any other reason.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Foam really is a big pile of foam, and just fizz, and it leaves a good deal of lace. Smell is hoppier than your average lager, but not particularly strong.  Taste largely follows the smell, but with an unexpected caramel sweetness in the aftertaste that eventually resolves into more hop bitterness. Quite complex, especially for a mass-market lager. Mouthfeel is a little bit thicker and stickier than your average lager, almost approaching what I'd expect in a porter, but not cloying. The character of this one really changes with temperature - the sweet notes come out substantially more as the beer warms. At colder temperatures, it seems more like just a hoppy lager.

Somewhat sweet malt with a bit of hops to balance it. Kind of a honey/caramel flavor in there. The hops are somewhat spicy. For a lager it is very complex. If you have it with parmesan cheese it brings out the hops and some of the sourness of the malt. If you have it with asiago cheese it brings out the sweet malt. This is the honey/caramel flavor.

A decent looking beer. Lacing is admirable.  Aroma is dominated by fruity malt. Noble hops are apparent. I detect elements of blueberries, fresh bread, and a subtle citrus.  Mouthfeel is fairly light and thin with reasonably high carbonation.  Initial flavor is an almost syrupy sweet malt. Finishes sweet and bready, I find the hops detectable but somewhat underwhelming, a strong sweetness lingers and seems just slightly peculiar in its character.

It looks great, smells good, tastes great, feels great, and goes down average. I strongly encourage everyone to try this beer regardless of reviews... Simply for the experience.  A: A wonderul golden color, a step avove the straw like yellow of most beers in this class. Head duration is above average, and lacing is remarkable for a lager. In some cases there is still lacing from pouring after the beer itself is gone. Looks very hearty and fulfillin, even before you know what it's like to drink. Carbonation is okay, as always, better when had on tap.  S: Smells good. Hoppy, fruity, and slightly bready. Above average for it's style.  T: Full bodied for the style. Fruity (Maybe too fruity) with a lot of hops. Bitter yet sweet at the same time. Enjoyable, especially at social gatherings, cookouts, ect... Slight citrus notes (Not as much as their commercials make you think though) and a good hoppyness. Tastes heavier than the average macro lager with more refinement. Certainly one to try,  M: Heavier than average, with sweet and bitter notes that attack the entire palatte. Goes down with slightly more harsh after tastes than most beers in this style. Earthy texture with a full bodied consistency (For the style).  D: Decent, but it's weight in the palate make it harder to drink than the run-of-the-mill macro brew. Not that this is a bad thing. Not as easy to drink as Coors or Budweiser, yet far more flavorful. This is a beer for enjoying, whereas most other macro's are for drinking.

35,104,AndyAvalanche,4.2,"There are few things in life that I appreciate more than a fresh Sam Adams Boston Lager. I consider this my stand by and have certainly had this beer more times than I have had any other beer. I've enjoyed it for so long both on tap and bottle but never taken the time to review it and finally took the time to do it tonight. Had it poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, pours a light amber color with a decent sized head that will go away after a few minutes in the middle but sticks around on the edges with some good lacing to it as well. Oh yeah, and perfect clarity, absolutely perfectly filtered. It smells very good, very well balanced between roasted, caramelized malts and, with great hoppy floral aromas at the end. Excellent full bodied, and perfectly balanced flavor of again the malts followed by a hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good not much of a carbonation bite to it. You can really taste the sweet in the beginning and the bitter part at the end. Its full bodied, but I still find it very drinkable. Just a good overall beer. I'll put a disclaimer on this, it said drink by 11/09 and it's July right now, so you know this beer was EXTREMELY fresh. Glad I got a hold of it before anyone else. One more thing I have to add about this beer, is it's a great year round beer, great in all seasons.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

This is a well balanced lager. The malts dominate and is a tug of war between the caramel sweetness and sourdough bread. There's a subtle bitterness and spice of hops that add to a nice finish.  Medium body that's chewy and a lot of carbonation. The high carbonation is my only knock on the mouthfeel.  Low abv, delicious beer, not offensive in any way. This is a beer that is not going to turn a lot of heads for being overly unique, but it's got a hell of a balance and is just a well crafted beer in general.

Smells a bit of caramel, bread and slight hops.  At first taste, its got a bit of an acidic, carbonated hoppy twang with a bit of caramel maltiness. Finishes a bit bitter but nice and crisp.

35,104,diabecktic,4.2,"Appearance: Upon first pour, a creamy, tan head (~2 fingers) forms. Retention and lacing are both excellent. The beer itself is a translucent, light-caramel color that is accented with slowly rising carbonation.  Smell: Sharp hop tones dominate the aroma. There are somewhat subtler hints of caramel, malt, and spice, but the hoppiness is unmistakable. It embodies the ""less is more"" sentiment.  Taste: The flavor matches the nose quite well. It's largely dominated by the hop character, but the carmel malt slowly takes over as you consume the beer. The balance is exceptional; you experience both sensations without feeling like one overpowers the other.  Mouthfeel: I think the body is just a tad bit heavier than ""medium."" The beer just kind of...melts over your tongue as it sits in your mouth.  Drinkability: This would probably epitomize the session beer. It's best enjoyed when simply sipped. Given the body (and flavor), I would have a very hard time trying to ""slam"" this beer.  Summary: The label says it best: ""America's World Class Beer."" To me, this is the standard by which I judge not just Samuel Adams beers, but a great many others. As I said earlier, it embodies the ""less is more"" philosophy. The hoppiness is by far the most unique aspect of this beer. Its composition and balance just add to the overall ambience, if you will. This is an excellent beer that can be enjoyed in any situation. It stands well on its own, but also goes well with damn near any type of food.

35,104,Reaper16,3.53,"served on-tap @ Flying Saucer, Kansas City, into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass  Pours a rich shade of caramel with a two-finger white head. The lacing was particularly nice; not webby or sinewy but simply straight rings and notches around the glass. Is it the Perfect Pint glass? I don't know, but it is pretty nonetheless.  The aroma, despite the Perfect Pint glass supposedly boosting this department, was lacking somewhat. There was a strong element of noble hops and great deal of biscuit. Perhaps a kiss of honey at its best.  This is a darn-drinkable beer no matter what anyone tells me because of its taste. Smooth, slightly-sweet malt mingles with a generous portion of German (hallertau) hops. The noble hops can get a tiny bit sour after a while, however. It is not complex by any stretch of the imagination. But it is easy-drinking, sweet, bready and hoppy. You can't go wrong drinking a Boston Lager (though you can assuredly go better).  The lager thinness carries the day, letting the noble hops shine all throughout the drink. At such a low ABV and with a decently high amount of flavor, one can definitely session this beer. I myself would rather pick up a locally-brewed beer to session (for me: the similarly-flavored Boulevard Pilsner or another Boulevard year-round product) but this should do quite nicely for many people as an accessible, go-to lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance: Basic lager appearance amber in color medium head bordering on smaller, which dissolves quickly into a thin soapy lacing that hardly clings to the glass.  Smell: floral hops, sweet malt.  Taste: for the smell being floral this beer has a lot of the malt in it a bit grainy. For the floral scent you would expect this beer to be far less bitter then it is. Floral in the fore taste with a dry hoppy bite, which well leaves the mouth feeling dry. 2.5-3.0  Mouthfeel: surprisingly dry for a lager. Proper carbonation but leaves the mouth dry.  Drinkability: Still prefer the Brooklyn lager even if it is a bit too sweet. (although thanks to beer advocate I have been informed this a vienna lager, so maybe I cannot compare the two) Too dry to have several, but not flavorful enough to want to have several. An average lager.

The aroma is malty yeasty.  The taste is an extremely balanced blend of malts and hops; it's hard to determine a dominant flavor at first. In the end, I believe that I detected a ""very lightly roasted malt flavor"" and an equally subtle hop presence.  The mouthfeel is medium and substantial, a robust feel to this lager.

I have no serious qualms with it. The smell is decent. Nice and sweet. The initial taste is brilliant, but I am not one for the aftertaste of this beer. The aftertaste is very hoppy and tastes very much of alcohol, thus the drinkability of this in my opinion is very low.  I have to say, if the aftertaste weren't so strong in the hops department, you'd have yourself a very drinkable decent macrobrew.  I REALLY wanted to like this beer, but I came out a little disappointed and am willing to accept it.

Pine needle taste stings the papillae with a bit of caramel mixed in. Sweetness lingers longer with exposure and temp. Noble hops come through slightly, which produces that drier finish than a Märzen or Oktoberfest would have.  M - Light in body, the sweet malt turns into a medium-bodied biscuity dry crisp finish that allows for a mild bitterness to linger. Very mild toastiness also comes through. Mild warming from the alcohol too.  C - This is a really well-balanced beer with plenty of love.

It is best drunk from spring through autumn at a temperature between 40-45 degrees F. but unlike the big 3 and many other middle of the road lagers, it still tastes excellent even when it gets closer to room temperature, a rarity among any lager or pilsner.

35,104,WildMaverick1200,3.9,"I keep running into Boston Lager in the supermarkets, and decided to give it a try. Came with Sep '09 freshness date and some award won written under the cap.  Looks like copper, and creates a nice 1 and half inch slightly brownish head which goes away slowly.  Smells of caramel and floral hops, with some malts around.  Taste is hops all the way. While hops are smooth, they're in the taste, throat and even aftertaste. Soft malt taste, and nice clean finish.  Medium light body with carbonation on the right spot. Feels quite nice.  It's actually a pleasure to drink this, you'll just want more after finishing your glass. Fits a variety of meals and weathers, and it's pretty much the definition of a ""session beer"".  A very nice beer indeed, it's easy to see why it's famous and why it won awards. Yet, at $20 mx or $1.5 usd, I could get a very similar brew like Bohemia oscura for half the price.

S: Strong malty smell with caramel and toffee residuals. Hops are faint but there.  T: Wonderful hop and caramel balance which combine to create an array of flavors on the palate: somewhat floral, citrusy, and sugar-cane like. After the malts subside there is a more noticeable hop bitterness, but not too overwhelming.  M: Creamy and somewhat slick as it goes down, with a crisp finish.  D: I'm not usually a fan of Sam Adams beers, but this is one I'll be going back to. Wonderfully drinkable and something you can just pick up and have a couple of; would serve as a great session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,necoadam,3.53,"Pours out a clear dark amber/golden color with a slight head.  Nose consists of malts, sweet caramel, and an underlying of hops. Some hints of bread/biscuit can be detected as well.  Taste is balanced with malts and hops with the bitterness of the hops finishing it out. Caramel undertones ride underneath it all. A little bit on the sweet side, but the bitterness helps balance it out.  Mouthfeel is medium with quite a bit of carbonation hitting the palate.  A good tasty balanced beer. Reminds me of an ESB, but just a little sweeter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,TheHammer,3.63,"Dug this one out of my fridge, I wanted to give this beer a mulligan because I think something I ate reacted with it the first time, and thus I'm giving it a second shot. Also considering it's due to expire in two days, I guess I better drink it.  Appearance - The beer poured with a solid finger of head that fairly well and retains the same. The beer itself is a crystal clear bronze with gold. Damn good stuff, but there is quite a lot of carbonation going on, which keeps it from a perfect score.  Smell - The nose is dominated by floral hops with roasted grain scent. There are hints of caramel malts with a touch of grass and dandelion in the background. The smell is quite rich, and didn't take a lot of warming to come out. Solid stuff, although a bit too hoppy.  Taste - Well a bit better then my last review but not by much. The beer starts with a nice caramel and malt flavor and then turns to a bitter kick of hops which tastes a bit too flowery. It finishes with a piney flavor that thankfully doesn't linger. Unlike the last time I had this beer, the second bitter kick after the beer went down is absent, but all in all the entire experience I found to be only slightly better. I'd give it a 3.75 if I could.  Mouthfeel - My biggest problem with the beer last time I had it, was after I got it down, I got hit with a mysterious second kick of bitterness that lingered for far too long. This time, it's absent, which is good. However the beer still leaves a bit of a filmy taste in your mouth however the carbonation (which isn't has bad once you drink it) and barely lingering aftertaste help it's case. If I could give it a 2.75 I would though.  Drinkability - The beer goes down smoothly and refreshes quite nicely despite it's medium body. This time around though, the carbonation is causing some serious bloating issues as well as some acid issues of all things.  Final Thoughts - I think this review serves this beer a bit better then the last one did. I'd still recommend it, but I was honestly surprised that this beer really didn't fare much better. I dunno, maybe if I got it fresh again it might fare better and make no mistake it's still a good beer but I think it will be some time before I pick this one up again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smell is a floral/pine hops a with a slightly sweet toasty caramel malt and just a hint o' yeast.  It tastes like it smells, bready tofffee malts with a bitter hop kick and a punch of spice all working together in good balance.  It's crisp and lively, well carbonated and medium-to-light bodied with a grainy bitterness in the finish that fades away slowly.  A really good lager.

A nice hop bitter finish with some grain and biscuity malt sweetness in the aftertaste. Sweet malt and bitter hops are really well balanced.  M- Smooth and creamy with a medium body. Carbonation is right on.  D- Easily the best available/easily accessible lager around.

35,104,Stavage,3.73,"Poured with a big bubbly off white head. Has a nice deep copper colour. Head retention was quite good and had a very decent lacing.  Smelled mostly of sweet malts and floral hops. Very nice combo, wish it was a little more intense though.  Taste pretty much followed on from the scent. A nice sweet maltiness perhaps a little biscuity with an almost honey like back note. Bitter hops comes in at the end and a malty aftertaste is left after the bitterness finally stops lingering. Overall I think they got the malt/hops balance almost perfect on this one.  Don't know if I'd call it heavy bodied but its a lot heavier than I was expecting. Carbonation isn't over done for mine. Not crisp like I was expecting and left my mouth a little wet, but sometimes I like that. Seems to go hand in hand with malty brews. Overall the mouthfeel was satisfying.  It's a little bit too wet for me to drink as a session beer, but it has plenty of well balanced flavour without being too challenging so it's a pretty easy beer to swig with a nice basic meal.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,katan,3.69,"12 oz into a pint, dated before august 2009  A - Pours an extremely clear and filtered golden to golden brown color. Head formation is light at 1mm, but very well retained. A bit of carbonation is obvious.  S - A muted nose profile - grainy malt tones are the most dominant attribute, similar to a cooked grain smell perhaps akin to a macro american lager. Surprisingly little hops.  T - Starts off rather smooth but overall a bit flat - not an assertive flavor to be found. Bitter balance does show mid-stream without an accompanying hop bite. Finishes with a malty note combined with a biting bitter edge. Some of that grainy finish comes back in the aftertaste.  M - Moderate mouth body primarily driven by the strong carbonation profile. Some malt sweet backbone exists that gives it some mouth clinging properties.  D - As sort of the craft version of the american macro, one could say this is where this beer really shines. Easy drinking on the palette, abv is manageable, and the flavors meld well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The Boston Lager certainly doesn't have the smoothest taste of any traditional lager, but it offers a flavor full of hops and a crisp, clean aftertaste. Like any beer, Sam Adams tastes much better on tap. This is a beer that I would reach for if I didn't want to drink anything fancy, but was still looking for a solid beer. Too bad it's not actually brewed in Boston.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DudleyRose,4.92,"I had stayed away from this beer for a long time in favor of the smaller micros. But recently it has been my favorite drink. I use the Sam Adams glasses, and I thought they were nice looking and maybe not much more. However, I just had this beer on tap in a plain pint, and I have to admit that neither the taste nor the smell of the hops was nearly as good. In the Sam glasses, the color is lovely, and the column of bubbles coming up from the center looks nice. More important it keeps a small head and aroma from beginning to end. The dry hopped Hallertauer hops are very nice, and the bitterness nicely matches the sweetness of the Vienna style malt. Just wonderful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,BeanBone,3.68,"Appearance: A slightly hazy, golden-amber body with a generous, pillowy off-white head that features passable retention, but great lacing.  Aroma: A decent wave of spicy noble hops on top of a solid, caramel malt base.  Taste: Up front, mildly spicy and bitter noble hops. Underneath, a lightly toasted and biscuity caramel malt backbone. This is certainly well-balanced. The aftertaste is of biscuity malt.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Dries in the finish.  Drinkability: You certainly can't fault it here; very sessionable.  Verdict: To be quite honest, I was expecting Sam Adams' flagship to be rather tame and bland to help it appeal to a broad-as-possible audience. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Boston Lager is actually a rather tasty brew. Sure, it's not the most complex beer I've ever tried, but it certainly isn't just a throwaway either.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T- Delicious caramel flavors mixed with spicy hop flavor, this is not just an intro to craft beer, this is delicious.  M- It is a bit heavier than most american lagers, but the flavor more than makes up for that fact (ha ha ha). The light medium body works well with this beer.

Good retention and lacing during the drinking.  Clean malty/doughy aroma with a piney and slightly citrus hop aroma.  Taste is a clean crisp flavor similar to the malty aroma with a very slight hint of wheat immediately followed by a piney hop bite and a lingering bitterness.  Medium bodied brew, well carbonated, and the piney hop aftertaste remains on the palate for a while. If you like hops, I'm sure you would enjoy this more than me!  Good drinkability, it's easy enough to have a couple in a night although the hoppy aftertaste does get to me after maybe 2 or 3 beers.

35,104,Buschyfor3,3.9,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  A: Pours an amber body which shows off glimmering golden and deeper amber-ruby highlights when held up to light. Glass produces a two finger thick, slightly rocky, creamy white head. I must say this glass produces the best head I've seen on Sam Adams beers; usually when I order a SABL at a restaurant (i.e. BW3) it is served in 23oz weizen or pilsner glasses and the head is smaller and dissipates quicker.  S: This beer releases a sweet, melted caramel aroma that blends with a bit of flowery hops and a zesty, mildly spicy character.  T: Much like the nose on this beer; upfront there is a wave of distinct caramel-like sweetness that is followed by a pleasant, sustaining hop bitterness. The malts provide a nice grainy balance to the caramel and hop notes. Aftertaste features some lingering hop bitterness while a milder, biscuit flavor rounds out the experience.  M: Goes down exceptionally smooth, accompanied by a nice wave of carbonation that lends a pleasant crispness to this beer.  D: Easily one of the best session beers around. You could easily enjoy 2 or 3 of these with a meal and then finish off another 2 or 3 relaxing afterwards.  SABL is my go-to craft when I'm eating out at restaurants that lack huge craft beer choices on tap. Nothing goes better with some Buffalo Wild Wings than a Boston Lager on draft.

35,104,Whiteweasel,3.88,"--- Old Review: --- I should preface this by saying that I my particular tasting was a tad over the ""brewery fresh"" date, so I may not be getting the best impression.  A-Contrary to most other reviews, I found very little head when i poured this beer into the Seidel that I was drinking it from. Doesn't foam up like most other beers. However, it does have a nice colour. Markdown for the lack of head, but otherwise very pleasing dark amber colour. 3  S-Smelled roughly how it tasted, which I will get into 3  T-Was not a huge fan of this beer. I tried it because everyone I've met has had nothing but good things to say about it. Hops were unbalanced, and toasted flavour was too strong for my taste. Too bitter in my opinion 2  M-Was no different than many other beers I've tasted. Nice feel in the mouth; clear. 4  D-A bit too strong of a flavour for a session beer, and was much more difficult to get down than say, a Heffeweiss 2.5  Everyone seems to love this beer, so maybe you shouldn't listen to my opinion  --- New review: --- Decided to give this beer a second go. I had a bad bottle back then, about a month over the brewery fresh date and I really didnt like hops. So now, with 43 beer reviews under my belt, I will be attempting to give it a fair retrial. Enjoyed out of a seidel and poured from a bottle best drank by May '10.  Appearance: Golden-brown with a ton of carbonation coming up gradually. Head is significant and long lasting and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Clear, yet with bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. 3.5  Smell: Sweet, malty with a pretty significant trace of hops. Definitely has a certain yeastiness to it as well. Light and a little tangy. 4  Taste: Hoppy in a delightful way. Maltiness barely comes through, and sweetness is toned down from what I may have expected. Roasted flavour is balanced and not too harsh. Something I don't absolutely love about the immediate aftertaste; perhaps the roasted flavour isn't quite perfect or theres some sort of metallic taste. 4  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated and sizzly to the tongue. No alcohol and not an incredible aftertaste 3  Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Delicious and light enought to enjoy a large amount of. 4.5",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T: There's a slight malty sweetness that's quickly overcome with a strong, but very palatable hops bitterness. I'm never disappointed by the way this beer tastes.  M: Smooth, crisp, tingly. Medium. Pleasantly long finish, usually cut short with another swallow.  D: With the moderate amount of alcohol, and the above factors, I can drink this one after the other after the other.  It's a sessionable, tasty, inexpensive beer that you can get all the time and just about anywhere. Often the best beer you'll find on-tap in a chain restaurant, and great with all sorts of food.

S: The nose is malty, estery, fruity, hopy, floraly, earthy and citrus. While the grammar is bad, the complexity of the smell is good.  T&M: Hate to take the quick and easy road, but this beer, tastes very similar to its smell. This is a very complex brew, that has the right amount of malt and hops too make it a well balance beer. The body is moderate with a good amount of carbonation; yes yes the tiny bubbles of golden goodness.  D: I want to call this a good session beer, but I can not. Its depth and complexity make it a little too much for this purpose; while it is very drinkable at first the rich flavor tends to overwhelm the tastes buds after a few.

35,104,Oahu,3.92,"The beer that made the BBC famous. Definitely not the first I've had.  A) Bright and sparkly. More pilsner than pale ale, just enough amber in there to recall Jurassic Park.  S) Pine, Acorns, earthiness. In a nutshell, I guess it smells like a tree. I'll leaf it at that.  T) Malty with nuttiness and a hop infused background. Kinda empty in the middle like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  M) Resilient. Coats and stays.  D) Good. I can see having three of these.

35,104,Gyle41386,3.36,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsener glass.  Pours an orange amber with a huge off-white head. Good retention, eventually leaves rocky foam icebergs in the glass. Good lacing.  Very average nose. Sweet and malty, maybe some hints of earthy hops. Bland, really.  Flavor is dominated by toasted bready malt. Starts out sweet, then a little hop bitterness in the finish.  Light body...thin texture. Probably over-carbonated for my tastes. This beer just isn't keeping me interested.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Oxymoron,3.78,"It's sad that I haven't had this beer in a long while. But at the airport this was the best option available. So, pours a crystal clear darker amber color with a off white head. Good retention but did hide to the edge of the glass. Good lacing through the entire tasting as well.  The nose is malty with a bit of complexity, but very distinct as well. More along the lines of an American Brown, there are some noticeable chocolate notes that blend cleanly with the malt. Some lighter melanodian malt notes as well. The yeast has lightly ester with some pears and plums but is still very clean and having a lager-esk cleanliness about it. The hops really come out, being more on line with an American Brown, but come floral, earthy and citrus notes are there.  The taste is similar. The malt is a bit more defined and not as complex, but still represented. The chocolate backs off a bit but still is there. Some toasty and biscuit like notes giving more of a bread flavor. The yeast is very clean but does leave some fruity notes in there. A light apricot, plum and fig note. Not big but there. The hops are mostly finishing hops. Some minor bittering but a more Pale Ale-esk taste with a mix earthy, spicy and floral hop note. Some chalky notes in the finish but clean.  The body is moderate and very easy drinking. Almost a session beer with more depth. The carbonation is good. The feel just has a more American Brown or Pale Ale feel with the fruit and hops to be really called a lager. Overall, this is a good gateway beer for new beer enthusiasts. A bit over showed or forgotten for the old school guys, but I am glad I can come back and review staples of the past.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,hopquaffer,4.28,"Very good looking and smelling beer, with a taste that could be pure old school traditional lager, but also reminds me of some English pale ales. Extremely well balanced between the hops and the malt, with a fairly strong blast of both. Definitely a very drinkable beer. I'm sure quite a few could be downed with a great meal. I have to tip my hat to Jim Koch and his team for a job well done. Like many I'm sure, I first discovered Sam Adams in the early eighties along with a few other craft beers, and then began seriously sampling from there. Since then I've tried many different and amazing beers from all over the USA and the world. I recently decided to buy a case of Boston Lager on a whim, because i couldn't find anything else interesting I hadn't tried at the store i was in. I was really amazed at how much i actually enjoyed this beer. I have definitely bought more expensive "" high quality micro brews"" in the past that were not better than this mass produced lager. Of course I have also bought beers that were far superior to Sam Adams, but for the price they are charging i can't think of any. All in all , a very nice beer that i will probably get again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Bigfatbino,4.6,"A = Pours up a deep yet translucent brown amber. Nice thick head with tight and lasting bubble structure. Leaves a nice lacing in the glass as you drink from a good beer mug  S = Flowery Hops, spicy aroma, and smoky-like grains. A little alcohol smell, not raw but tempered by the very hoppy overtones  T = A perfect blend of the sweet I expect from the Lager family. But there is a very pronounced and resiny hoppy flavor that pushes the bounds of being ale-like, without the yeast-undertones.. A truly exceptional combination that will hold this beer as one of my favorite large-scale brews.  M = Very good, tight bubbles and a nice tingle on the tongue. The resins are palatable to the taste buds, and carry the hops very well.  D = Lower alcohol content than my mainstay of Barleywine style, this beer is the perfect American lager for BBQ's, Poker Games, Bowling matches, and 2nd base-chug summer softball games.  Food Pairing: New York Strip Steak, Grilled to Medium Rare, with Fresh Cracked Black Pepper. (The hoppiness compliments the texture and flavor of this cut of beef, and the sweetness is complemented by fresh cracked black pepper.)  Tobacco: A fine cigar, A nice aromatic pipe tobacco, or if you must choose cigarettes, ""Lucky Strike"" Non-filters. The toasted qualities of this cigarette are complimented by the blend of the grain and hops in this beer  Overall: Possibly the best Large-scale production beer on the Market today.

35,104,JohnQVegas,3.85,"Draught. As a note, I've found this beer to vary widely between nicely balanced and intensely hoppy. This one is of the hoppier variety.  Pours copper, decent head that dpesn't last too terribly long.  Aroma is faint, mainly sweet malt. Some piney hops.  Taste is sweet bready malt up front, sweet but toasty, with spicy pine hops coming out fairly prominently on the finish, a bit earthy. Hops actually linger a bit on the palate for a dry finish.  Palate is moderately carbonated, light to medium body. Very different from the bottled version I've had before - hops come out much more clearly in this one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,lanechaffin,5,"Can't believe anyone could give this beer a low mark. It seems almost perfect to me. Rich complexity, great taste, good aroma..there is a lot happening in a Sam Adams BL- you taste pine, maybe a very slight citrus, wonderfully hoppy and a nice strong beer taste, and with all that, it still is simply beer as beer was meant to be.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Stunner97,4.31,"Appearance- Golden brown to copper in color, moderate carbonation as beautiful small bubbles can be seen streaming up the glass, nice thin white foam head,  Smell- Pine and citrusy hops, slight malt smell, slight grains as well,  Taste- Plenty of nice bitter hops lace the finish of this one but the malts do a wonderful job balancing out the finish and not making it to bitter, impressively full flavored and nice finish,  Mouthfeel- smooth and nice crisp dry finish that leaves you wanting next sip, yet soft and nice feel on the finish,  Drinkability- One of the better examples to me of the lager style, very full flavored and delicious finish and balance which is rare in most lagers these days, as this being the first time I tried this I think it will be a pretty regular session beer in my fridge from here out and that says something since im usually way more an ale kinda guy, a good brew and a perfect session",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,johnmichael712,3.97,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. Freshness date on the bottle is clearly notched in the paper label, and it tells me to enjoy by July 2009. Seconds after I pop the cap off this beer begins to foam out of the top of the bottle, so make sure that you have a glass handy. Boston Lager pours an exceptionally clear golden amber color that is a few shades darker than the Brooklyn Lager I had a few hours ago. The head is an off-white color, and is supplemented by a steady stream of small carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. It has pretty good staying power and eventually fades to a small ring around the top of the beer that doesn't leave much lace behind.  Smell: The nose of this beer is very clean, with a prominent sweet malt aroma that has hints of floral and citrus hops. I'm a fan of the way Hallertau hops smell, and they add a nice floral, leafy dimension to the aroma. Overall, though, the nose of this beer is a bit too clean (or non-descript) to get a very high rating.  Taste: Boston Lager starts out with a very strong spicy flavor thanks to the hops, and then moves to a truckload of sweet malt that is reminiscent of both biscuits and toasted bread. The flavor finishes with more of the hops, but they are less spicy than before. Instead, the hops being a bit of citrus flavor to the palate that is akin to bitter orange peel, but fades quickly to a dry, but not lingering, finish. This is a lager, so a certain amount of blandness was expected, but Samuel Adams' version is definitely an above average version of the style.  Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than the Brooklyn Lager that I had earlier today, this beer is a light bodied lager that seems to be attempting to cover up its flaws with too much carbonation.  Drinkability: I often find it hard to rate lagers on their drinkability, as I could go one of two ways. In one respect they (this beer included) are light, crisp, and clean beers that are easy to session, but in another respect their lack of flavor or flair makes me want something else to avoid boring my palate. In the end, however, I feel like this beer has above average drinkability when consumed as a single glass, but I'll usually be drinking something else to follow.  Notes: Samuel Adams Boston Lager is one of those beers that you drink a lot of and rave about when you first get into craft beer but fades into the background as you experience more of what is out there. Regardless, it's still a wonderful lager and an absolute classic brew, and is debatably the beer that got the ball rolling for the American craft beer movement. I'll probably be buying it, but not very often.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,wnh,3.48,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a bright clear bronze/copper, with a small fizzy white head that dies down pretty quickly. Looks drinkable enough.  Not a lot going on in the nose. Sweet malt backbone balanced by a little hoppy earthiness. The first sip has that earthy bitterness up front, with bready malt in the background that seems to be struggling to come through. Bitterness comes back at the finish, leaving me wanting another sip.  Light-to-medium bodied with lots of scrubbing carbonation. Nice and crisp. Boston Lager is drinkable by itself, but doesn't leave me wanting another by any means. If this is the only non-BMC product available at a restaurant and I want a beer I'll be happy to get it, but otherwise I'd pass. I'd say its most redeeming quality is its availability.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Still pleasantly straightforward: hops and malt with the characteristic hint of caramel. Clean and simple. Nothing different detected out of the bottle. The taste is equally straightforward with a bit more of a roasted grains character. Body is light to medium, crisp and clean. Carbonation is light. Very drinkable and a great option for a session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Has a nice, fresh grassy hop aroma mixed with sweet caramel malts. Pretty straightforward, which is probably a good thing for cold fermentation brews. A fine smelling lager with plenty of oomph.  I never remembered this being very tasty back in the day and have not had one on tap in a few years. It is surprisingly quite tasty. A masterful malt blend of toasty burnt bitterness and sweet lighter base malt. German hops are flavorful and assertive without distracting from the overall refreshing lager feel. I like this much better on tap than in the bottle. Body is fairly light and carbonation is medium-high. A most solid quaffer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Macca,3.27,The bottle had been resting in my fridge for a couple of weeks and was not handled roughly before opening but that didn't stop it over flowing onto my desk as soon as the top came off.  It subsequently poured with little head. Not sure if this is normal or due to a problem. A dark golden colour.  Definitely not the aromas that I was expecting for a lager. Caramel malt and some sweetness. Nice though.  Caramel continues on the palate with some drying bitterness. More heavy hoppiness than expected.  This beer reminds me more of an ESB than a lager. Maybe that is a sign of my own ignorance.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The aroma is not too strong, but is dominated by very nice, sweet biscuity malt, with floral hops playing softly in the background. The taste is more of the same, but with some light apple notes and the added bonus of bitter hops on the palate. Nothing too complex or strong going on here, but somehow, it's just right. The mouthfeel is light-medium, with a perfect amount of carbonation.  I'm no expert on this style, but everything about this beer is pleasant to me. This is just a great, flavorful session beer that you can enjoy on any kind of occasion. I went from only drinking hop-bomb IPAs and DIPAs and resisting lagers, to really enjoying this style without much effort at all.

Lemon and grapefruit up front in the hops that balances out with a really nice buttery, biscuit malt finish that lingers. Mouthfeel is very pleasant, nothing offensive and very well balanced. Very smooth and very easy to drink.  Overall, one of the best lagers I've had to date.

It barely tastes like a lager. Taste is very malty. Some roastedness. Some earthy hops. Very complex flavor.  Mouthfeel is a little crisp, but not bad for a lager.

There is a nice fruitiness in the malt which really works well for this type of lager. The mouthfeel is medium with a perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability is great because the beer has a great balanced flavor that does not overpower the palate and also has a normal ABV.

The pour is a copper/amber color with very little head but the head that is there lingers.  The aroma is a good balance of sweet malts and spicy roasted hops. A little bit on the floral side. Medium-bodied lager.  The mouthfeel is that of a medium bodied lager and the taste is sweet and bitter at the same time. Not much of an aftertaste. It really is one of the better quasi-crafts out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Viggo,4.02,"Pint on tap at the bistro.  Pours a clear dark amber, light orange hues, thick white head forms, quickly drops to a medium collar around the glass, some lace spots, looks pretty good. Smell is nice, more floral than I remember from the bottle, biscuit and toasty malts, some caramel sweetness, apricots, floral hops, basic but well done. Taste is similar, nice caramel and biscuit up front, toasty middle, light graininess, some floral hopping in the finish, almost a peach like fruitiness, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. A very well crafted lager, much better on tap than in bottles. Nice stuff, could drink this all night.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Jimbo87,3.98,"In a US pint glass.  Lear amber, big pale head, left a bunch of rings of lacing.  Smells of fresh toasted malt. Later on, some slight herbal or spice-like smell which was very nice, but which I don't know how to describe.  Taste: Sweet malt, slightly toasted, very slightly buttery. A smooth taste. Nice hops give a nice bitter finish to balance the malts. Slightly sour/acidic. I'm having trouble identifying much about the hop profile. It may be slightly earthy. A surprisingly complex taste.  Medium body, well-carbonated.  Very drinkable. A very good lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,rodney45,3.36,"Good medium amber color and decent head retention. Smells a bit hoppy and sweet. This beer holds it down, and is a favorite of mine. However, it has a few misgivings that make it near the bottom of my list of beers I'd buy and keep on hand in my home. It is too sweet a beer, i dont know if that is indicative of all Vienna lagers, or just this one, but its too sweet. Carbonation is also a bit overwhelming, especially when its too cold, which is why you need to drink it at 40- 45 degrees, not the crazy freezing temperatures they would normally serve it at bars. That being said, this beer broke the way for commercially acceptable ""good"" beers. It deserves a place in history for that. A really good brew, not great, but good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,smibroncos,3,"I poured the beer into a standard pint glass. It poured a sturdy amber-brown color, the head was light brown and lasting. It had a fair amount of lacing.  I think the beer tasted alot like cola. It had some flavors of honey, vannilla, ginger. The yeast had some sweatyness hidding in the background. It finnished with a lasting bitterness.  The mouthfeel was medium not overcarbonated.  Not a real filling beer.

Malt and hops are very well-balanced. Earthy tones are evident in the taste. Moderate carbonation in the mouth. Good drinkability due to beer's overall flavor and ABV.  Not as in-your-face as other beer types, but this is a great example of Vienna lagers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,evantwomey,4.35,"I feel compelled to review this beer, being one of my favorites for years. Pours reddish-gold with a tight head that dissipates quickly but leaves tight lacing. Despite the fact that I pulled it straight from my fridge, this beer is crystal clear. Aroma is fantastic, the first thing that hits you is a mix of malty sweetness and resinous hops. A very distinct lager-aroma too - just a touch of sulfur and utterly clean. Taste is crisp and malty with a surprisingly hoppy, spicy finish. The hops in this beer are very subtle but definitely there, and delicious.  An American classic! I like to think of this as one of the flagship beers of the US and am proud to live in a country where a beer of such caliber can be found in any gas station or corner store.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A bit hazy, perhaps showing its age, but probably chill haze. Aroma was a bready malt with a hint of orange, still quite pleasant. Taste began with malt sweetness having a hint of caramel. A small spicy hop presence was detectable finishing with a moderate yeast flavor and little to no aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied having moderate carbonation. Overall, simple, but enjoyable. Light and refreshing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Great clarity and many streams of bubbles.  Nice hoppy aroma, spicy. Maybe some roasted caramel as well.  Taste is a little toasty upfront with some caramel as well. Some spicy hops on the finish. Good flavor profile that showcases both malt and hops. Great balance  Mouthfeel is good. Creamy with the right amount of carbonation. Medium bodied.  Great drinkability. A good beer that is always available. A great introductory beer to those new to craft beer. This was one of the first craft beers I tried and there was a bit of shock at how much flavor it had compared to macros.

35,104,HopEnthusiast,4.2,"Pours a deep rich copper/amber, medium head and Beautiful lacing. Lots of carbonation that holds throughout drinking. Looks very inviting! Smells of sharp & crisp grape with sweet but slightly burnt caramel malt. Floral spicy/citrus hops as well. Tastes of sweet, crisp rich roasted caramel, with a spicy roasted hop bitterness at the end. Hop bitterness lingers just a tad. A touch of citrus/pine as well. As it warms, more of a slightly burnt caramel flavor comes out Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with high carbonation.

A: Crystal clear light copper color, white head about half an inch thick that reduced to a film with a few clumps of lacing. Quite a few bubbles moving around in the beer.  S: Big time malt-roastiness. Honey and caramel are really present here, slight citrus/spicy hop character, really good smelling lager.  T: More of the nose in the mouth, a little more on the roasty side than I'd remembered from the last time I drank this. Not a huge hop presence, but there is something there, a little kick of spice at the end. Caramel and honey really stand out in my mind. Really a tasty beer, even though it is a shade watery.  M: Thin, dry, nicely carbonated, doesn't leave a lot of lingering flavors on the palate. Exactly what the style calls for.  D: Great session beer, this one goes down easy and is really flavorful.

This isn't one of them (although given a choice between this and a pilsner such as Bud, MGD, Coors, etc, I'd choose the Sam Adams Lager every time).  A: Reasonable color somewhere between amber and light brown. Translucent.  S: Nothing offensive, but nothing enticing me to want to taste it either. Lager yeasts, toasted malts.  T: Here begin the problems. How do you describe a lack of quality in ingredients? It was both thin on flavor and yet too heavy on negative flavor attributes simultaneously. Not atrocious, but nothing positive here at all.  Ml: Appropriate texture for the genre. Moderate carbonation.

The thick creamy head makes my mouth water with anticipation of the first gulp.  Smell is a bit florally and fruity. Taste is verygood. A bit fruity with a nice sweetness to it. No strong hops or malts are detected.  Mouth feel is nice and the beer finishes smoothly making this one of the best all time session beers.

It has a maltiness that must have seemed off the charts when it first came out (compared to fizzy yellow). It is a beer that can be savored for its complexity and drank by the six pack. It is good in all types of weather.  This beer sort of reminds me of how you feel about an older sibling. You used to worship it, then you found flaws in it, then you decided you loved it even more.  If I were going to pick any nits I would say that it is a Fischer price beer so I can't justify a perfect score when it is intentionally less flavorful than it could be. Also the head retention is spotty. But that's about it. Great beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smelled of nice roasted malts, followed hints pine/citrus hoppy smell, that i've never really picked up on before. This Boston Lager really did stand out from others in the past. It tasted of caramel roasted malts, followed by a light grapefruit citrus hoppy finish. The bitterness of the hops really stood out for me this time. Very rich smooth finish with enough of the hoppy kick at the end. this brew was very well balanced and makes an excellent session brew.

A good balanced smell between all flavors as nothing really sticks out to me. Enters your mouth and the smell is what you taste, and it is a medium thickness which results in a medium drinkability.

It pours amber colored with carbonation bubbles and a white head that retains for the entire beer. Leaves lacing down the glass. Smells of sweet malts, earthy hops, maybe even a little bit bisquity and some slight fruity undertones. This brew is light bodied and carbonated. It tastes just about the same as the smell, but there is something else in the mix that I can't quite put my finger on. If I had to guess I would say that its metal/coppery, however it doesn't make the beer taste unpleasant. Solid beer that is well balanced. It is an excellent fall back beer when you end up in bars that this is the best they will offer.

Standard SA graham-crackery yeast, some malt, and a bit of sharp hop.  Very clean and rustic/coppery taste. Strong balance between the slightly roasty profile of the malts, and a bit of a hop bit at the end. Grainy, and a little biscuity. Little bit of caramel present. Medium body and refreshing. Not the biggest beer nor the most complex. This leads it to be a bit thin, but a very easy drink. As far as lagers go, you can definitely do worse.

T: Sweet with malts, rich with coppery tones and hops and a hint of alcohol. Many seem to detect grapefruit but I can't seem to pick it up, though I definitely detect citrus. The flavor is rich and unexpected for a lager.  M: Thin like a lager but with the flavor of an ale. Carbonation is great and the beer is easy drinking.  D: The brew is not very filling so drinking a six pack can be pretty easy. It leaves a nice citrusy bitterness on the tongue that lasts for hours.  Ever since I made the move past lagers, it has been hard to take that trip back and truly enjoy it. My heart lies in American Strong Ale and Imperial Stouts so you can imagine how incomplete I feel when drinking a lager. When I can't seem to find anything I like at the moment, Boston Lager is always around to satisfy my longing for something rich and flavorful. This is definitely a good transition for those looking to venture in to more serious territory. The alcohol content is also a nice touch.

S--Noble hops with muted lemon and grapefruit notes, followed by German malts. No metallic or off aromas---decent roasty notes lightened by the hop smells.  T--Quite a flavor punch given how clean the profile, this beer is a lager with a swagger. Wonderful fresh bready whole-grain and crackery malt notes that dip into a solid bittering from the hops, which are almost tangy, and ends with more bright lemony notes. Beefy malt profile for a lager--appreciated.  M&D--Mouthfeel was only average as I felt it stung a little more, was a bit more astringent, than I would have expected.

So sometimes its nice to drink one and appreciate that its actually pretty good when you compare it to the other popular lagers out there..  Pours a golden orange with thick, foamy head.. Its not yellow, so thats good enough in my book.. Smells lightly of indistinct malt and hops.. As it goes with most of this beer, if you were comparing it to all other beers in the world it would be a bit unimpressive, but for a popular lager its def. better than most. The flavor has a light balance of hop and malt. Niether is overly expressed but its pretty refreshing. The slightest bit on the hoppier side. It has a slightly light-moderate body. Very smooth. Little aftertaste. Obviously, overall its a refreshing drink and tastes pretty good, though the flavor is light. As such a popular beer it def. deserves to be respected for maintaining quality.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,selecter70,3.3,"A decent, but over-rated lager in my opinion. Usually the last choice in a pub for me (granted, if the others were Bud Lite & Corona, I'd embrace the Sam heartily though). Overall just a basic lager with too much hop to really express anything else. Simple beer for a basic drinking, not too complex and certainly more a pale ale than a lager to my palate.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bmwats,3.83,"Poured into a pilsner.  A: Light copper color. Medium carbonation pours into a half finger, white, foamy head. Settles quickly into a smattering of foam on the surface. Substantial carbonation continues to rise throughout. Pretty decent lacing, albeit not substantial, remains.  S: Dark roasted chocolaty malt, light hops, maybe caramel.  T: Malt, hops, slight citrus hint, and a subtle indistinguishable sweet spice.  M: Hearty but light feel. Malt flavor comes on pretty strong, then the hops follow-up and stay behind.  D: Very good drinkability. Again light feel, and good flavor.  Can be powered down without a second thought, if that's what you're into; but can also be sipped and enjoyed. Good flavor and atmosphere. Overall, really good quaff.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hellomcfly,3.69,Never reviewed this before and had one sitting around from the SA winter sampler pack.  A - Pours a clear amber color with a fluffy white head. Good retention and lacing.  S - Aroma of sweet malt and slightly grassy hops. Malt flavor profile is reminiscent of bread and caramel.  F - Toasted and caramel malt with a grassy hop note that was displayed in the aroma. Well balanced with a faint hop bitterness in the aftertaste.  M - Slightly sharp carbonation but in a nice refreshing way.  D - Very high drinkability coming in under 5% abv.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,PhillyStyle,3.43,"Served on-tap in a pint glass:  The beer appeared a light amber in color with a white head with decent retention. The head was light in texture.  The aroma was a little sweet with notes of pine, hops, some roasted malts and a little bready. The hops and pine dominate the aroma.  The taste is solid. It kind of follows the nose, the hops and pine dominate, with a nice bitter aftertaste.  This beer is easy to drink, goes down smooth and not as watered down as a lot of other more mass produced beers. The beer is well balanced, light to medium body and it is always a good choice if left with few options.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It is multi-faceted--bitter and sweet and is really becoming one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams--not something I would have said ten years ago",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,OzarkElmo,4.18,"Bottle pour into new Samuel Adams Lager Glass. Clear amber color with moderat off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts and hops, less evident than the malts. Very well balanced beer, and IMO at the top of its category, a premium lager. The more I drink this beer I appreciate it for what it is - a very good beer when often the only other choices are from BMC. Excellent session beer and like I said the more I give this beer a chance, the more it impresses me. Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,steeler,3.97,"This one pours out a nice copper color, with a head that sticks. Smells of hops, malt, and very fresh. Taste is very hoppy, and malty, and smoooth. I was surprised how smooth this was. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability, i would of given this a 5 but its a little on the heavier side, an after 2-3 i just don't want anymore. Dont get me wrong i really like this beer, i just dont see this as a session beer, but for savoring and just having a few, this is a solid beer. I wish Canada could mass produce beer like this. Well done.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SickBrew,4.1,"Poured for a standard 12oz BB into a pint glass. This brew has a good finger of fluffy pales white head that leaves some good lacing on the way down. Color is a nice amber color that is a definate standout in most of the lagers I've had. Nose has a rich malty character with some light caramel tones and hopiness for support.  Flavor is at the top of the list for most of the lagers I've had. It fairly rich with malty tone that's more roasted than it's macro cousins. Sweetness is just rich with aspects of caramel. Hop bitterness is great and really wouldn't expect to mush more from a lager without crossing styles. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, well balanced and just might have to have another. I has a high degree of drinkabiltiy. I should have listened to those commercials.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,czfreeman,3.15,"My second beer of a holiday 12 pack. Lets hope its better than Cranberry Lambic. Pours out a light malty orange-brown tone. Light head that settles quickly, moderate carbonation. Smells of biscuity malts, nice sharp accent of Hallertau? like hoppyiness, tart acidic bite. Taste is light, bready, a nice balance of malts, yet the finish kind of dwindles away. All thats left on my palate is a tingling dryness,without that long hop finish in German and Vienna Lagers. Mouthfeel is extremly light, so drinkability as a session beer is good. For my German-inspired lagers, I think Ill stick to good German brew or Victory and Stoudts Pilsners.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Sticky lacing on the glass.  S- grapefruit, pine and grain. some other floral aromas comeout but not as pungent as the grapefruit.  T- grapefruit hops dominate. Some pine and other woodsy flavors. Grain and malts as well. Quite balanced.  M- A nice balance of hops and malts make this beer feel crisp and fresh onthe palate. Very smooth and easy to put back.

35,104,NatetheGreat,3.8,"I hadn't had a beer in about three months due to job reasons and a move. I was able to stop at a gas station and was pleasantly suprized to find Sam Adams and Mirror Pond PA. Had a Sam's on this New Yrs Eve.  A: orange-copper with faint reddish hue. good head, slight off-white. Has the look of an ale perhaps more than the lagers I've seen (although my scope of lagers is quite limited).  S: grapefruity hops, moderate to strong hope smell with toasty grain malts. faint sweetness also but the hops dominate the nose.  T: well-balanced, although I think it leans toward the hops, with noticable bitterness. Caramel or toffee like sweetness helps balance the brew. Strong flavors yet also easy to drink. Seems to almost be a cross between a lager and ale. Similar strengh and characteristics of Anchor Steam Beer (which surprises me, because I really enjoy Sam Adams, but did not like Anchor much at all).  M: lively and smooth, not watered down. Sturdy brew.  D: Because of the good taste and lower abv, this one's a winner when it comes to easy of drinking. Isn't life-altering but it's a very good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Extremely easy to drink, however, I think better beers can be had in a similar price range.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,sonicdescent,4.48,"This is a great go to beer. Looks a nice golden color with a white head that lasts the duration of the drink. Smells fresh, especially if you are used to adjunct lagers.

The nose is dominated by floral, herbal hops with the malt prfile subdued.  Taste is more malty than I would have expected but is very balanced with some bitter, flowery hop flavour. Slightly piney and herbal and grassy hops. The bitterness builds and the finish is very dry.  Creamy and medium bodied with a medium but soft carbonation.  5/5 for drinkability. Totally sessionable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Large Pilsner glass  A - Brownish Amber in color nice semi-sticky foam does what it is supposed to do as I drink it clinging in rings to the glass (large pilsner style)  S - I detect some malty aroma, nutty, caramel mixed with ""is that hops?"" I think so, but not so much what I call a bouquet. It's a Vienna lager after all.  T - balanced if not slightly sweet side overtaking the bitterness until a not quite so pleasing aftertaste takes over for a moment and then quickly recedes. Good.  M - Good - Has some body.  D- Quite drinkable. Twenty minutes till my flight leaves... I'll have another",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Wetpaperbag,3.48,"A- Amber in color, with a short head, yet the head is very tightly nit and clingy.  S- There is some caramel smell. A slight hoppy aroma that is grapefruity. I also get the traditional malty lager smell. For me lagers all have a similar smell.  T- Malty for sure, with that caramel taste. I'm getting the hops, but I could do with more. Again, this does taste like a lager, in terms of that traditional lager taste.  M- Feels like beer in your mouth.  D- Easy to drink, but isn't something I would go and buy regularly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Deingeist,3.88,"A - A nice yellow amber, with great clarity, a very nice frothy white head that stays.  S - Not a ton to talk about here, but it smells good so I have it a 3.5. Not as much malt as one might expect, but the hops smell pretty nice.  T - Way more flavor than nose. Great malts and the hops add a very nice bite to this. A bit of citrus and maybe vetiver even from those hops, but faint. Lets the beer be a beer.  M - It's got a bite, for a lager its a bit sticky, it's got a nice body. If you're looking for a lager that has a bit more weight, she's here.  D - I wouldn't call this lager refreshing, but it's got a lot of flavor and isn't overwhelming. A great combination when were dealing with drinkability. This lager has routed the previous drinking habits of the dreaded bud and miller drinkers in my family, and I'm proud they've begun to move on.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Tone,3.97,"Pours a clear, light, brown color. 1/2 inch head with slight retention and little lacing. Smells mainly of hops. Fits the style. Tastes of bitter hops first, then the sweetness of some malt. It's a crisp, smooth, feel with a good blend of hops and malt. Average carbonation. Overall, easy drinking - good lager - and really smooth.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I could easily knock back a sixer of this.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,yesyouam,3.46,"This lager is an attractive yellow-amber with average-sized white head that fades away. The aroma is mostly of malt-- maybe caramel. The hops are subtle. The flavor is simple, lightly bitter and inoffensive. The body is rather light but great for the style. This is obviously a session beer. Simple and easy to drink.

35,104,Grandwazoo,3.19,"Regardless of this rating, I want to state emphatically that one of the most memorable beers I've ever had was a pitcher of fresh Sam from a keg at some dive bar in Waltham, MA about 8- 10 years ago. It was so fresh and tasty it was a spiritual event!  So, perhaps a random bottle just can't match that.  App -- Bright amber color, perfectly clear with light carbonation. Light, creamy head with no lacing to speak of  Nose -- Caramel and toasted corn and brazil nut  taste -- A little fizz-bite at the start. Light malt, hay and mild hops. Lingering toffee  Feel -- Not particularly deep or complex, but balanced enough. taste does not build much nor shift through the tongue.  Dr -- Drinkable, certainly, but not too much to focus on.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A: Lovely amber colored brew with a sizable frothy white head. S: Pleasant blend of semisweet caramel malts and clean, slightly bitter hops. T: Much like the taste, a satisfying blend of malts and hops. A lingering sweetness leaves me wanting more, too. M: Nice, manages to combine malty, bitter and sweet tastes/feels without overdoing any of the three. D: A big selling point of this beer. Highly quaffable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,steveh,3.64,"For my 50th BA beer review: a return to an old standby.  I can remember drinking a lot of the Boston Lager when there were few and far between good beers to be found on the shelves. Had some on tap the other night, thought I'd focus a little closer with some bottles.  A -- Wonderful clear golden-amber with a thick, soapy, long-lasting off-white head.  S -- Aroma is pretty thin, had hoped for some more malt -- even some good hop note from Hallertauer. The hops are there, but for a ""Vienna,"" I'd expect more malt.  T -- Very nice malt & hop balance, maybe a shade too hop-heavy to style, but not heavily overdone. Sweet, bready malt start with spicy hop close and dry finish. Some vague butteriness in the aftertaste, but not quite diacetyl -- similar to Pilsner Urquell's aftertaste.  M -- Body is light to light medium with a very good, soft mouth-feel.  D -- Drinkability is average as the hop aftertaste starts to get a little cloying. Noble hops seem to do this when used in greater amount, I get the same effect with Pilsner Urquell. At 4.75%, this is would be a great session beer if you like heavy noble hop character.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A slight flower-y finish from the hops.  T - It's definitely more malty throughout. It's an interesting mix of caramel, buttery toffee, and sweet grains. Not a whole lot of bitterness, almost none, and only present in the after taste. Works out well though.  M/D - It has a nice medium body with just the right amount of carbonation to balance it all out. Definitely easy to drink.  A great choice for a very good beer when there is nothing but macros available....heck, I'd take this even if there were some micros available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Taste: nice fresh hoppy bitterness, citrus, grass and some resin; caremell, bread, butter, and some kind of spices; some metallic notes as well.

Smell - Almost sweet, with some nice hops and caramel malts. Some citrus almost.  Taste - Sweet, a little malty definitely. A touch of hops and citrus. Just a touch of bitterness on the finish. Pretty good balance, but a little mild.  Mouthfeel - A little on the thin side, maybe. It's got some decent carbonation.  Drinkability - I'm probably biased here. I drink this beer literally all the time. It's incredibly drinkable, although about 6-8 in they start to get a little heavy, but that's hard to complain about.  I did my best to give this an unbiased review, but I probably didn't. This beer always reminds me of home, and drinking beers with my family.

Malt dominates the flavor. Good malt at that. Rich caramel. The taste of this lager is rare in that it gives you chocolate hints as well as grapefruit hints. A bit metallic in the middle. Pretty slick. Hops and malts are unified at the finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit prickly for my taste. Carbonation could be more restrained.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It's really straightforward...simple malt and hop profile but it does the trick. Still a bit of cpmplexity in it, though.  Good mouthfeel, nothing stands out there. Drinkability is outstanding. One of my favorite lighter bodied beers.  I love this beer. I crave it often, have it often, and think it is one of the better craft beers out there. It's safe...but very well brewed.

Taste: The taste didn't impress me -- too bitter. End of story.  Mouthfeel: Average carbonation, and thick texture that's almost syrupy.  Drinkability: If it's ice cold, it probably will go down smoothly without too many problems. As it warms, the bitterness really kicks in and slows things down a lot.

The Boston Lager starts out with a light head and a caramely, orangish hue, with a light malty smell and a bitterness in the scent as well. The taste is a bit sharp at first, but eases into flavors of lightly roasted oats and barley and caramel, with a hoppy tingle. The beer rolls out into the front of the mouth, where the solidity of consistency sets in and is able to function at its best. There is a bit of corn and root in the finish, but flows more like a lager than any lager I have come to drink.

Pours maybe a little lighter than I remember, light cherry golden with a rocky white head with great retention. Nice visible carbonation is very attractive in the glass. Head is still sitting square on top of the beer several minutes after the pour. Superb clarity. Really can't ask for much more.  Aroma reminds me of a brewery.. all the grains lying around.. there's just a huge malt aroma coming from this. Maybe a little soapy, but it's up there with the Vienna lagers you'd expect to see from Europe.  The carbonation hit me before the taste which was a little surprising. Good bitterness keeps this from being too wussy of a beer. I think I'm drinking it a little warm which might account for it not being as deliciously malty and irresistable as I sometimes remember. Mouthfeel is a little bland. I always notice when the beer's water characteristics seem separated form the rest of the beer. Again, this might be the slight warmness of the beer but I'll crack open a fresh one later and update if it's too much.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Ruslanchik,4.16,"This 12oz bottle came in a Winter collection 12-pack that is clearly marked best by March 2009. The bottle is also marked March.  A strong pour stimulates nice head formation and a pretty two-finger white fluffy head. Retention is good and lacing is evident. The beer is a crystal clear light amber.  Aroma is mostly sweet malts. Very little hop aroma.  The flavor starts off with a light hop bitterness that is followed by a candy-like sweetness. Bitterness lingers, but is not overwhelming.  This beer is appropriately light on the tongue. It is amply carbonated and leaves no residue in the mouth.  This is an easy drinker for sure. The definition of a session beer. Nothing too overpowering in the flavor, it is refreshing from start to finish. The alcohol is in the right range to allow for extended enjoyment.  I'm not usually a big fan of lagers, but this one has just enough complexity to make it worthwhile. Definitely a good choice for long nights of drinking or for introducing friends to craft beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S- hops come through, but also a sweetness. t- extremely well balanced for the american palate. you can choose to focus on the malts up front or (if youre smart) on the hop finish. m- extremely clean, doesn't fill the mouth. sometimes leaves a metallic residue, but that's the case for most beers, esp ones this large that have an industrial production process. d- really sessionable. because it's so well balanced you could pick out different great parts. the only reason i would drink something else would be mood.  the go to beer in boston, its an institution. rather than have a natty bo or PBR, Henry's or Lone Star, we are fortunate enough in this city to have our local favorite be an absolutely great beer.

I can't place all the scents, but there are hops and malts in there, and it's generally very pleasing.  T: Along with the smell, the taste is my favorite part of this beer. Starts off a bit sweet, then finishes with a delicious bitterness.  D: Quite drinkable. No big complaints here, but I feel like the sweetness hampers how much I want to drink of this one. Tough to strike a balance between big flavor and drinkability, but this one does it well.  Notes: Overall a bit expensive for what it is, but it's widely available, reliable, and tasty.

S - Good smell but mainly hops and not very balanced.  T - It's good, but its not great to me. I taste mostly the hops and not really that much else. Could be much more balanced.  M - Good mouthfeel, not heavy or watery, and not overly carbonated.  D - Pretty good drinkability, I could put back a few of these no problems.  Overall a pretty good beer. My only complaint is that it could be more balanced.

35,104,Vendetta,3.62,"Original Rating Date: May 17, 2008  Sweet, strongly citrus (lemon) nose on the beer right out of the bottle that gets me excited to taste the beer. Has a great look to it, golden brown with a white, frothy head that leaves a thick, solid lacing down the glass as I drink it. Taste is good but not as complex as a lot of other beers I've had. The hoppiness makes the beer, very strong hop flavor. Carbonation is present but not overwhelming. The strongest point of this beer is its availability- without it we'd be stuck with the token light beers at most mainstream restaurants. As a beer alone, I'd rank it in the lower threes. However, the Boston Beer Company gives me hope yet for macros- they have marketing on par with the watery, fizzy ""light"" crap produced by Coors, Miller, and Anheuser-Busch, but make a solid product that American beer drinkers can be proud of.

Aroma is wonderful with nice floral and citrusy hops.  Flavor is very well balanced with good sweetness from the malts and generous orange/grapefruit hops.  Mouthfeel is good from begining to end. Nice crisp hops up front with clean dry finish.  Drinkability is very good. At 4.75%, I could easily make a session out of it.  I'm surprised at how much I still like this beer.

35,104,PintOHops,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a deep rich copper/amber, medium head with beautiful lacing. Lots of carbonation that holds throughout entire consumption. Looks very inviting! Smells of sharp & crisp grape with sweet but slightly burnt caramel malt. Floral spicy/citrus hops as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of sweet & crisp rich roasted caramel, with a spicy roasted hop bitterness at the end. Hop bitterness lingers just a tad, and there's a touch of dark chocolate. A touch of citrus/pine as well. As it warms, more of a slightly burnt caramel flavor comes out (Very Pleasant!) Mouthfeel is lite-medium bodied, with lots of carbonation on the palate. Very crisp.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could probably drink about 3-4 of these cause the carbonation is very filling. That being said, I absolutely love this beer!

35,104,shanecb,4.32,"A - Nice amber color with a creamy looking head that stayed throughout the whole beer. Only poured perhaps half into a glass to get a feel for the color, and enjoyed the rest from the bottle and cannot really say anything about the lacing.  S - Mostly a hoppy smell, though nothing exceptionally powerful. Could pick up a light yeasty/bready scent but it was really an undertone to the hop smell which was definitely upfront. Smelled crisp and pleasant, and definitely gets you ready to enjoy this lager.  T - Wonderful! Initial taste was a delicious hop flavor that isn't too overpowering. Almost had some sweetness behind it as well. Aftertaste was slightly bitter, and not nearly as strong as the initial taste. Initial taste almost reminds me of some pale ales, which was quite nice to find in a lager.  M - Very nice, lightly carbonated and smooth. Feels great as you are drinking it. Nice crisp, refreshing feel to it.  D - Great drinkability. A refreshing lager that goes down smooth and you could keep coming back to. The wonderful hop flavor makes it better than most american lagers, in my opinion, and the added flavor definitely adds to its drinkability. Really the type of lager you want to be drinking on a hot summer day with dinner, though could easily be enjoyed any time of the year!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Bought a pony keg for a graduation party years ago, thought it was the best beer I could get and it tasted like it.  Soft spot in my heart.  But it's not holding up so well in the craft beer world. Sort of thin. Buttery feel and taste, generic, common malt with some floral/buttery hops to balance.  Better than Bud/Miller, etc. But that's not saying much.

Head retention isn't bad, as it lasted most of the beer.  Smell is of sweet malt, a bit of a light caramel is there.  Taste is pretty crisp, buttery malt up front with a mild earthy hop finish. Not bad.  Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing, light to medium bodied, good carbonation.  Drinkability is, by far, the best I've had in a Sam Adams yet. Easy to drink and pairs well.

35,104,biboergosum,3.95,"12oz bottle. I've never seen such a bold proclamation for a freshness guarantee on a beer bottle before: the back label is entirely devoted to explaining the Boston Beer Company's offer to buy back old, expired bottles of their product. Mine says Dec 08, so instead of flirting with a refund, methinks I'll just drink it.  This beer pours a clear, pale golden hue, with two fingers of dense, and somewhat creamy eggshell white head, which settles none too quickly, eventually leaving some decent mitochondrial lace around the glass.  It smells of crisp, rather biscuity wheat cracker cereal grain, a subtle apple fruitiness, a hint of aged lemon, and a hefty dose of earthy and floral hops. The flavour is a gradual uptick of the same - biscuity, cereal-heavy caramel malt, a reserved citrus fruitiness, and peppy grassy and floral hops.  The carbonation is on the low-key, subtle side, the body medium-light in weight, and everyman smooth. It finishes in a more sweet-ish manner, the biscuity malt gaining a strengthened sugary character, and the hops holding fast enough to keep things kosher.  A pleasantly tasty example of the prototypical gateway craft beer, and a lager to boot, which is infinitely more challenging a prospect. Fully satisfying, a little zingy, and worthy of its lore in American brewing circles.

The Sam Adams signature glass allows for constant release of CO2 due to the laser etching on the bottom. The head is a slight off white that leaves a notch on the glass with each sip but the head dissipates down to 1/8 inch rather quickly.  Smell: First thing I noticed was the hops, they come right out and, as a hop lover, really draw me in. No off aroma's here, hops and what I can only describe as crisp.  Taste, a slight sweetness with a very nice and lingering hop aftertaste. That hop bitterness must have been what Ben Franklin was referring to when he said, ""Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."" Man, that hop aroma and bitterness is heaven. Gave taste a 4.5 for the outstanding hop flavor.  Mouthfeel: clean and crisp but the CO2 bites a bit like club soda, not smooth like Rogue Dead Guy or Duvel.  Drinkability: IMHO an above average beer on the delightful hop flavor and aroma alone. I'd call the Boston Lager my Old Faithful. You know exactly what you'll get and it's accessible.

A: Pale orange with a good clarity. Milky beige colored head provides only a skim coating with a weak hold. Lacing is minimal. This seems alot lighter in color from what i remebered, always though this was a more amber color. Carbonation is very faint, spacious and slow to rise.  S: Sweet grains, orange blossoms and cinnamon grahm crackers. There is a hint of sweet rich chocolate. The nobel hops are hard to pick up on, im getting a totally different aromatic experience from what i remember, either my senses have changed or evolved, or the beer suceeded in killing enough memory brain cells. I always thought this had a more toasty amber grain base with nobel flowers. This seems much sweeter.  T: The flavor is toasty sweet orange peels and crystal malts. A bit of flowery bitterness. The nobel hops are more detectable, fresh, flowery, whole cone like. There is a touch of cinnamon, dried orange and sweet malt as well some chocolate.  M: The mouthful is crisp,flowery hop feel, with creamy caramel malts.

Perfectly clear golden-amber in appearance, a steady stream of carbonation rising from the center. Two fingers of head rise from a vigorous pour, but eventually settle to a thin cap.  Smell: The first whiff reveals a pleasant mix of biscuit, toffee-like malt and a touch of noble hops. Floral aromatics appear as it warms, along with a touch of fresh peach. Exceptionally clean stuff.  Taste & mouthfeel: Opens with semi-sweet toasted malt flavors, flowery hops, citrus zest and hints of honey. Biscuity dryness takes over soon after, with fairly mild but pleasant bittering hops following. It's amusing to think that I found this beer intensely bitter only four years ago.

The hops smell unlike any other that I have come across, they are delightful.  Taste - Initial taste of the hops then the aftertaste of the malt. The hops have a unique fruity flavor to them.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, moderate amount of carbonation (not overpowering but evident).  Drinkability - Could be a good session beer for some, although I'd rather have just one at a time.

T: Earthy hops, and some slight caramel flavor.  M: Light to medium body, crisp and clean finish.  D: Easy to drink. Nothing wrong yet nothing outstanding. I never mind having a SA Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ZimZamZoom,4,"A go-to beer of course when the bar has nothing else but BMC. I'm amazed I have not reviewed this yet but here we go:  I poured a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass. A nice polished bronze color, almost white head rises fast and hangs around. Really this is a nice looking beer. Lacing ensues.  Aroma is really centered around a beautiful yet subtle hop nose, a nice malt profile is behind this. Good balance all at a low, not in-your-face level. Taste is sweet with some malts, caramel and a nice earthiness. Nice hop profile. It does have a little bit of a bitter hop finish that lingers well into the double digit second range.  Nice medium bodied, fulfilling beer. It's nice to take a step back and appreciate this beer on a sip by sip basis, since most of the time I drink it by the pint and grumble that the bar has nothing better to offer. Perspective is everything, but this beer will always have a place in my house.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bonkers,3.8,"I poured my Boston Lager into my SA pint glass. An attractive beer, clear gold with a hint of auburn. There us decent head formation with lots of lacing. The aroma is heavy with grain notes. Boston Lager is a slightly sweet smooth beer with a clean finish. Boston Lager is light bodied and very sessionable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,roadhouse,4.33,"Had on tap in a 23 oz. glass. Appears orange-copper in color with a once inch off-white head that sinks down to a skim and eventually to a ring. Leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is mildly sweet caramel malts with a nice toasty character that seems similar to an Oktoberfest with a bit more hops in the background that are spicy and earthy. Taste has an initial sweetness that fades into the finish, but it blends with some toasty and nutty flavors before doing so. It finishes with some spicy hops. Mouthfeel is medium-light, crisp and drinkable. Good stuff for the style, very drinkable. Always a solid choice when there is nothing else but macros, Guinness, and Bass around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,abedenbaugh,3.76,"A:A nice clear amber color with a slightly off white head that has some staying power. The head lingers along the side of the glass leaving a little bit of lace behind. S:At first there is a nice and mild hop aroma that pops into the nose. The hops might be of the noble varity, with a little bit of herbal coming through. Also some caramel is playing a little bit behind the hops. T: At first there is a slightly sweet, malty flavor but it is quickly followed by the hops, who the beer seems balanced towards. It's not a hoppy beer by any means, but the flavor will be more dominate than the malt. There is a good deal of hop flavor in the middle which leads to a slight bit of bitterness in the finish. MF: There is a medium mouthfeel with an average about of carbonation. D: Overall, this is a great beer to sit back and drink. Luckly, this beer happens to be almost everywhere so if I'm in a bar with a poor beer choice then I can always at least hope they have this beer. It is very easy to drink. I love the amount of hops in it, not too much or too little.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,schellsbeer,3.53,"If there was a Micro/Macro brew, brewery that once was a Micro that is now looking like a Macro brewery, this is the beer that I would choose to drink from a Macro Brewery.  This beer is great as far as the Big Boys go. Good Appearance, Taste, and Drinkablilty.  In fact, I am just enjoying one of them as I write. However, I purchased the Winter Classic Sampler and I am ""saving"" the good beer for later. ""Saturday Night Live"" and a Samuel Adams Boston Lager....what isn't there to love?!?!  Good all the way around. Appearance is like a beer should look. Smells like a beer, tastes like a beer, feels like a beer and drinks like a beer....therefore, it must be a beer.  (Sidenote....there is no such thing as a Macro beer so no macro beers are consumed in this house. That being said and since I am the only one that drinks beer in my house, I am the boss. There I said it, 5 women vs me. What do I know...I am told what to think, how to act, where to walk and how to talk....except when I am on Beer Advocate. Here I can be myself. With so many daughters and a wife, I need someplace to call my own. BA, you are what I have been looking for. I tried the 3rd bathroom and garage but they have been taken over too. This is just mine.

35,104,kingothewoods,3.94,The color was a rich reddish copper with plenty of tan creamy head. I was impressed by the head retention because it was on tap. Most beers don't retain the head character like this one. Smells like hops and caramel malts. Wow.... the hops come through. I liked this lager - it has the flavor of an IPA but this is definitely a lager. This is a unique beer with complex aftertones and very drinkable.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JohnWaynes44,3.93,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint glass. Pours a beautiful clear amber blond with a finger and a half head that dissipates to some nice lacing and foamy lumps.  Smells of caramel malt and soap. Hop aroma is slight but apparent. Taste is excellent. Malts come through immediately. The hops are noticeable but not overpowering. This beer is silky smooth and very nicely balanced.  Sticky mouthful, similar to an octoberfest, a bonus considering the style.  It's hard to find anything wrong with this beer. Great session beer that is always consistent. This beer is easy to find even in rural Indiana. I always come back to it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Hints of malt aromas in background, but not prominant.  T-A clear bitterness mingles with some roasty and nutty malt flavors. An overall well-balanced flavor. Some hearty hop aroma flavor.  M-Medium light body, with happy carbonation and a semi-crisp finish.  D-Good drinkability. It's a clean and relatively refreshing lager beer.

Not that I'm bitter about this...  Pours a brownish-copper color with a one-finger foamy white head. The head dissipates into a medium-sized ring around the glass with decent lacing.  Smells mostly of caramel malt with a decent amount of noble hop aroma.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Sweet caramel malts ending in a good amount of mild hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is very good for the style - good thickness and carbonation make this go down smoothly.  Drinkability is very good. A very sessionable beer that I could easily have a few more of.

35,104,Tdizzle,3.88,"A pretty fresh bottle that recommends consuming before March, 2009. I've had this beer many times, so it's about time to give it a proper review.  A- Poured from a 12oz bottle into a fancy Sam Adams pint glass, this beer pours a clear brownish-gold color with a one-finger, white head that gradually settles to a patchy layer, leaving some thick sheets of lacing behind after each sip.  S- A spicy and mildly citric hop aroma is balanced out by an equal amount of bready, caramely smelling malts.  T- The taste is also well-balanced, with the initial hop bite quickly being replaced by a bready, sweet malt backing. A dry finish leaves some bitterness on the palate.  M- This beer feels full-bodied in the mouth with a moderate amount of lively carbonation. Seems right for the style.  D- This is a great example of a session beer. The balanced flavor and low ABV make this a beer that I could easily have a few of in one sitting.  An all-around good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,likethetaste,2.23,"This is actually one of my least favorite Sam Adams brew. It pours a medium brown with a decent head but I just do not like the taste. It has a bitter aftertaste that just stays with you. I like Sam Adams, but this is one of my least favorites by them. I would drink their light before this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,prosper,4.1,"Sparkling clear. Loose, tan colored head with lots of lacing. Constant streamers of bubbles.  Smells of spicy noble hops and pilsner malts, enough there for most hops aficionados; and a grassy/malty smell, typical of pilsner (and munich/vienna malts). No sulfur or DMS, quite surprising!  Taste is much the same. Malty/grainy sweetness, backed up by a one-two punch of solid hops bittering and flavour. Finishes with a cloying sweetness, which is the only flaw I can detect and a minor one at that. Drinking it a bit colder would probably make it disappear (I had mine at ~12C)  Mouthfeel is medium, with a moderate carbonic zing.  Little too much sweetness in the finish/aftertaste hold back the drinkeability.  Still, if there's a better amber lager out there, I haven't found it yet.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ncbeermonger,3.23,"this beer has been my savior more times than I can count when surrounded by a sea of american light krap!  Pours well, has a gentle hop nose, and hints of caramel.  The taste is classic, you get the hops, and the crisp taste of a lager. It's not as golden as most american lagers it is a bit darker, and a lot better!  The mouthfeel and drinkability are good, there are tons of beers I would rather have, and perhaps just as many I would rank below this lager.

35,104,beermanbrian,3.6,"Light amber color. Head isn't much to speak about but the thin cap trails some nice lace. Smell of toasted malt and some light floral hops. Taste is pleasant enough. Nice maltyness with hops for balance. Overall a nice brew. I bought a case of this for some non beer enlightened guest who would never drink my normal beers. It fit the bill perfectly, not too bold for the BMC drinkers but enough flavor to satisy the craft beer drinker. Also a good fallback in many bars/restaurants that don't carry good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,PerzentRizen,4.72,"Boston Lager is probably the best example of the lager style. This has been my go to beer for years and it is the litmus test for good beer drinkers across the country. I know that people who love this beer will love many other great beers; while those who hate it will probably not like many other great beers.  I poured this one into a duvel glass to accent the hop aroma and it worked beautifully. I love the floral smells of this great beer. On tap it's even a little sweet tasting (with clean lines of course). The head is big and billowy then reduces quickly.  The smell is a wide array of hop aromas. These smells are some of the best I've ever gotten from a lager (how do they maintain the fruit aroma?).  Mouthfeel is a little light- but 10 years ago I would think it was thick. It makes for a great session beer.  I could honestly drink this beer all day (and have on several occasions). It reminds me of the past and times forgotten. I can remember being at USMA and drinking this delicious beer at the officer's club while watching the Red Sox on the corner TV. I can remember drinking this beer at Christmas with my Dad. I can remember giving this beer to so many friends in an effort to ""convert"" them to real beer. Oh how this beer is a tasty memory.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Tolnik,3.88,A - Pours as a light amber beer with a good finger width head that reduces down to a light lacing after settling.  S - Low malt with a high hop aroma tingling the senses.

A-Really appealing golden amber with about an inch of cream colored head that stayed around for more than half of the glass then laced beautifully down the glass like an artful spiderweb.  S-Definitely a sweet floral smell with a certain twang to it. Hard to put a finger on what the twang is, but it's definitely a good thing!  T-Wow, I'm not a pro yet by far, but this is the first beer I've come across that hasn't made me make the beer face on contact (which is alot for me!). Perfect balance between sweet and bitter. Finished clean with a surprisingly pleasant aftertaste that didn't linger on for forever and a day.  M-Went down silky smooth. Not necessarily creamy, but definitely not watery at all.

Poured from brown bottle into pint glass  Appearance: Beautiful amber in color, nice, thick finger long head, this head will give you a beer mustache! Beautiful lacing that seems to follow the head down the glass.  Smell: A great smelling beer, hints of floral hops escalade into a beautiful wheat/fruit aroma.  Taste: You can tell Samuel Adams hand selects it's hops because this beer has great characteristics. Slight maltiness gives away to it's fruit profile, finishing off with a hint of spice that seems to tickle the back of your throat.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, clean and refreshing. Mild carbonation, slight bitterness gives away to a good bite.  Drinkability: Easy to drink if you prefer this style, defintley a good choice at a bar to have something different then all these nasty Bud Light and Coors products.

35,104,Beernoisseur,3.8,"This beer is a great example of the sum of its parts being greater than the whole. Individually, none of its constituents are much more than moderately above average. It looked pretty good, it smelled pretty good, it tasted pretty good, and it felt pretty good going down. At the end of the glass however, I thought to myself ""Damn, This is great beer!"" I don't really understand it.  There's definately some fun complexity in the flavor. More hops than average I'd say. there's the grainy and the malty, but it's well balanced with the bitterness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Aroma is just like what Jim Koch always says, the smell of flowers. Very nice floral aroma from the hops. I can also detect a hint of a cinnamon like smell. There are some nice fruity smells and some nice caramel like aromas. Also has some malty aromas too.  Taste starts off a little sweet like caramel, which then turns pretty malty with some hop flavors in the mix. Finish has a nice hop bitterness to it. Has a malty aftertaste that lingers for a while.

Smell of bready dough, sweet malt, maybe some corn...a little spice.  There was a little metal taste at the beginning, that gave way to a creamy malty taste. There was a nice amount of hop bitterness at the finish.  Medium carbonation that made this highly drinkable. This was an ok brew.

35,104,wl0307,3.68,"BB 09/2009, served lightly chilled in Rodenbach's slim goblet.  A: coming in a dark orangey amber hue, with a frothy beige head with good retention, fed by really mild but constant carbonation full of microscopic fizz. S: sweet prunes, caramelised tangerine, a faint floral hint of hops are underlined by caramelised sugar from the sweet malts. Pretty pleasant but not quite complex. T: a mildly spicy hint (of hops) follows the soothing swallow of semi-sweet maltiness, showing a touch of biscuits apparently from paler malts... the lightly orangey hop aroma develops along with more medium-level bitterness in the aftertaste, while the overall fruity touch and mild caramelised sugar also linger. Throughout the drink, a very mild sour touch typical of a lager serves to underline both the sweet-malty and bitter-hoppy sides very well. M&D: the healthy carbonation sustains and supports an overall medium body and a well-balanced flavour - very quaffable in every sense. The malt characters are more in line with the English types of ales, while the lingering bitter taste is especially welcomed to add to the beer's overall drinkability.  * Tasting Date: 07/08/05  Got this beer at my local Sainsbury's recently at 95 pence a bottle. The best before date is Jan. 06. 3.5 A: in a medium-sized weissbier glass it pours an amber, or light-honeyish hue, coming with a reasonably foamy, off-white beer head fading out in about a minute... it is fiercely gassy at first, while from the second minute on it turns weaker but still too fizzy for me. 3.5 S: the nose is very softly fruity and malty, with light caramel and brown sugary note, apple-peel's aroma, against a soft backdrop of noble hops. 4 T: on the palate it's truly enjoyable--soft maltiness arrives along with a mild, fruity hoppy flavour, as a slightly spicy and herbal, medium-bitterness gradually prevails. Delicate fruity flavour of malts and hops sustains well, though the bitter finish is reasonably clean rather than lingering. 3.5 M&4 D: Well-balanced lager with a soft malty mouthfeel throughout, though it could gain more assertive flavours from larger quantities of dark malts perhaps?

I wouldn't call it my favorite, and I do get tired of it sometimes, but I'm never disappointed by it. And it's one of the best beers to have with dinner.  The beer looks great. It has great head and good lacing. A nice amber color. It looks like a classic lager.  It smells really good. Definitely one of the hoppiest widely distributed beers I've tried. Jim Koch isn't kidding, it smells like flowers.  The first time I tried this, probably around 17 years old, I couldn't stand the bitterness. Now that I'm older and I know what beer's supposed to taste like, I love it. It's just the right balance of smoothness and bite.  All in all, this is a great beer. Truly an American classic.

The head dropped to a skim and left decent lacing down the glass.  S= I found aromas of sweet bakery malts and a surprising amount of fragrant piney hops.  T= An immediate short burst of malty sweetness was followed quickly by a spicy hop profile. I was pleased with the hop bitterness, which far exceeded most lagers you will find on the market. The finish was relatively dry yet never lost its balance.  MF= Light to medium bodied with a solid carbonation level.  D= Very drinkable beer and highjly sessionable.

The taste is a good balance of hops and malts sweet initially followed by the bitterness of the hops. The mouth feel is surprisingly balanced good combination of hop bitterness and malt. This is a very drinkable beer. Defiantly one I could have more than one of. I have found that the flavor of the beer is better as it warms. This is a good fall back beer that can be found almost anywhere in the Northeast.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smelled of hops mostly, some malt and a little spicy.  Taste is great. Its been a long time since I've had this beer, and forgot how good it is! A lot of hops, but not a punch in the face. Even maltyness. A great balanced beer. Why don't I drink this more?

T - Excellent combination of bite and flavor - you can taste the hops and the malt, yet neither is overpowering.  M - Fuller than a typical lager, but not heavy.  D - Very drinkable.  Serving type: bottle  This is - IMO - the best commercial American Lager available. When I first had it years ago I was much less experienced with beers, and couldn't stand it, because all I had been drinking was American Lagers. Since then, I've been able to expand my palate significantly, and have come to appreciate this for what it is - a strong, full-bodied lager that does a great job of balancing the hops and the malt.

35,104,brewmudgeon,3.83,"late 09, early 10, boston lager seems like a very different beer to me. it's comparatively awesome. i could swear it's changed dramatically: lighter in color, the roastiness is about gone, comes across now more like a delicious pale ale/vienna lager hybrid. for a sub 5% beer i'm finding it unmatched (wish it were closer to 4%), and buying it by the 12-pack. what's going on??  In my quest for a standby summer lager, I turned once again to this one by Sam Adams. When I was into trying different beers a few years back, I wasn't too impressed and found it difficult to drink. Unfortunately, I still can't seem to enjoy it. The appearance is nice enough. The beer is similar in color to the bottle it came in. A head forms and leaves quickly. The smell is fairly roasty, and it gives you the idea it's gonna be a bit bitter but without anything floral going on. The roasted taste is okay at first, but for me becomes too astringent and watered-down coffee like. The hops are vague, the body too thin to match the roasted qualities. In sum, boring hops and irritating malt.  a 3; s 3; t 2; m 3; d 2.5",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Taste: Pretty malty, caramel, american hops, pine-needle, citrus, grapefruit.  Mouthfeel: Better than average... pretty filling for a lager beer.  Drinkability: This is a beer you can have a few without lacking in judgement... good session beer a day at the pub.  I've had bad examples of this beer at the local pubs here in my small town in Karlstad.

Actually has a little bitterness at the end. Puny but nice.  I remember my first Sam Adams. Working graveyard shift at an (in)convenience store, I would grab a sixer at random to relax with before passing out for the day. Brought home some Sammies. Thought they were the most god awful swill imaginable. Couldn't even drink a whole bottle. What a pathetic wuss I was. Fast forward 15 years and I think Sam Adams taste like sweet candy.

A nice malt body is balanced nicely by the hops. I know they are german hops, but they taste almost like the west coast hops made famous by some IPAs. A slightly hoppy red is more like the taste of this beer, I wish all vienna lagers were this good.  M. Medium bodied. Crisp. Dries the mouth a bit, leaves me wanting more.  D.

35,104,Reagan1984,4.15,"Funny, Sam Adams Boston Lager has almost become commonplace so I rarely enjoy a pint. This beer is one that I think it totally different on draft vs. poured from the bottle. (please NEVER drink one from the bottle)  Enjoyed 2 of these on draft tonight and realized it was time to note my thoughts and write a review.  Beer came with a thin one finger head that was foamy and white. The head quickly receded back into the glass. The color of the beer was copper or bright amber with lots of orange highlights. No visible carbonation and very clear.  Aroma was floral or perfume like. Some citrus notes but fairly clean/ fresh aroma. Also got a sense of grain/ malt in the aroma.  I was pleased that the taste was as pleasing as I remembered. Excellent balance Slightly spicy like white pepper. Starts with a little burst of hop bitterness and this gives way to a nice bread like finish with just a touch more hop assertiveness towards the end. This really is the beer that gave me an appreciation for the bread/mal flavors that can occur in quality beer.  Mouth feel was light to medium/light and the tingle of carbonation on tongue  Very drinkable beer and one I consider a session beer on draft.

M. Gave good carbonation with a pleasant syrupyness and a strong hops and malt aftertaste.  D. A beer that uses subtle flavors, nothing too complex. I prefer Sam Adams Summer Ale, but enjoyed this enough to get it again.

S - Lots of floral hop aromas accompanied by sweet caramel and a hint of apple (caramel apple?).  T - Hops dominate up front, giving way to caramel sweetness from the malts in the finish. This is a very well-balanced lager and one of the best-hopped in its class.  M - Medium-bodied, good carbonation. The hops bite ever so subtley, but it's still very smooth.

Aroma is of sweet malts, with perhaps a bit of floral hops making an appearance as well, though not much else showing itself to me in the nose.  Tastes of sweet grains balanced nicely with a hint of hop bitterness, with a medium body and a clean finish with just a hint of hop bitterness.  There's a reason this is America's most popular ""craft"" brew: it's readily available, balanced, and flavorful enough to please the beer lovers out there when nothing better makes a show on the menu, though not too complex or strong for the uninitiated.

The flavor is a bit heavier than one would expect, with elements of toffee, perhaps a hint of smoke, and a little slightly off floral hops. It lacks the hop bite one might hope for, but still, a tasty beer.  The mouthfeel is robust without being overwhelming. You know you're drinking a solid beer.  All in all, a highly drinkable beer.

Boston Lager pours an amber color into my (unfortunately at this bar) frozen mug with a one finger head (helped by the fact that the bartender poured it down the middle). Smells of flowery hops.  Tastes like flowery hops as well, balanced out by the malts, this isn't an overly complex beer, but it is excellent. I used to think this was the hoppiest beer in the world (that was before I ever tried an IPA). This is definitely one to be had on the tap as it is much better than the bottled version. I will admit that part of the reasoning behind my high rating is the fact that such a good beer can be found practically anywhere.

35,104,jushoppy2beer,4.72,"Among beers that are widely distributed, easy to find, and inexpensive, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is almost impossible to beat. It has one of the best noses of any beer, with a superb floral hop aroma. The color is just right, the head is well structured, and thus the lacing on the glass is perfect. The flavor is bold enough, with just the right amount of bitterness at the end, to satisfy with a single mug; but, it is smooth enough and reasonably low in alcohol to function well as a session beer. That's why I generally drink it by the pitcher with friends.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It poured an amberish brown color with nice white head and had nice lacing. The smell was of a little hops. The taste was malty up front with a nice clean hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was medium to light with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkibility is very good on this beer, they slide down nicely.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TheViceBlog,3.7,"The flagship Sam is maybe America's most underrated beer. I think your average beer guzzling yahoo sees it as nothing more than a macro (not that he would know that condescending term), and an overpriced and snobby one at that. ""No twist off cap?!"" ""I'll need a bottle opener for this beer?"" ""That soooo European."" ""I thought this beer was named after some American president."" Meanwhile, I think your average stuffy beer snob doesn't like Sam either-but it has nothing to do with taste. Most beer snobs have probably never drunk a Boston Lager. ""It's advertised on television for gosh sakes!"" ""It's soooo cheap!"" ""You can find it in pubs."" *shiver*  It's nothing if not a victim of its own success. On both extremes. Heck, I'm not sure if I've EVER met any one that calls Sam their favorite beer. And that's weird, especially since there are people that probably call stuff like O'Doul's and Mike's Hard Lemonade (Strawberry flavor) their favorite ""beer."" I must admit that even I forget to drink Sam as I'm a much bigger fan of the brewery's terrific seasonals and, of course, their Utopia is an all-time legend. We take this beer for granted. But it's a damn fine brew. And just about the cheapest and most readily available craft beer you can buy in this country.  Good smell, nice and light. Nothing too complex, but tasty. You could drink these all night and you could definitely do worse. One small gripe is that it could probably use about 0.5% more ABV kick in it. At least in my opinion.  A good, solid beer and that's hard for a New York-born and living die hard to admit. I'm supposed to hate all things Beantown. Typically I do. This is the rare case where I don't.

I don't mind variation as long as it is for the better, not when a mediocre batch is mixed in with the good. For an American lager this beer has a great hop aroma that isn't found anywhere else for a beer this widely distributed. I love the amber color.

35,104,jokelahoma,4.07,"Can't believe I'd never gotten around to reviewing this beer. Had it on tap at Old Chicago in Olathe.  Poured a lovely deep copper color, with a fairly decent sized head that lasts an appropriate amount of time. Little lacing, however.  The nose is quite hoppy, with an earthiness to the aroma. There's a good portion of malt smells in there as well, making the aroma overall fairly balanced and appetizing.  The taste is also balanced up front, but then changes to a fight between malt and hops to see who gets to remain in the foreground, shifting back and forth between the two. The hops show the somewhat spicy, somewhat musty European flavors, while the malt is good and caramelly. This is quite hoppy, especially if you approach it from the ""this is a Vienna style lager"" standpoint. This is not a ""to style"" beer in most regards, and there's not a thing wrong with that. It's a hoppy amber lager, and proud of it.  The mouthfeel is actually a good deal more full than one might expect from nearly any lager outside of a dopplebock, yet it doesn't seem to distract from the brew overall.  Overall this is an excellent flagship lager for the Boston Beer Company. It has honest to goodness flavor, it's hoppy without being overly bitter, and is a great way to introduce non-craft beer drinkers to the world of good beer.

Now that I'm more apprecciative of the hops, I love it.  Mouthfeel: One of the best aspects of the beer, very smooth.  Drinkability: This is a session beer 100%, a reliable, affordable choice.

Samuel Adams is the ultimate session beer; not too complex, not the least bit overwhelming, just a smooth, drinkable quaff that is enjoyed anywhere and anytime. No matter where you go, you'll at least find this delicious lager.  I am drinking this on a sultry July day from the glass gifted to me - and other BAs - by Jim Koch and the fine hopsters at Boston Beer Company.  Sam pours a thick, spongy head atop a clear copper body. Lacing is moderate and dissapates quickly. The nose is a flowery bouquet that lingers in your senses - sweet hint of orange ester. Sam hits the palate with a clean crisp wash; minimal hops but noticable, nevertheless.  There is a perfect collaboration of hops, yeast and barley that makes for a sublime balance. All is right in this world.  Every lover of beer should, and probably does, have Sam in their possession. It is one brew welcome by one and all. Thanks Jim!  Now ...

A: Rich amber gold with a half inch of lacy white head, which slowly dissolved leaving lace on the glass  S: This time, the Hallertau aroma didn't leap right out of the bottle as it sometimes does. That wonderful spice is still present, though, backed by a hint of pale malt.  T: Smooth, rich and balanced. The iconic American Vienna-style lager. Perhaps a hint more carbonation than is strictly necessary, but as it warms the carbonation smooths out and allows some grainy and bittersweet malt flavors through.  M: Full and balanced. Nice.  D: I could, and have, drink this all night. Not always paying attention to it, sure, but not every sip of every beer has to be cause for brow-wrinkling introspection.

I still prefer many of their other brews (i.e. the Black Lager), but I will no longer eschew BBC's flagship at BBQs and the like.  Poured into a standard pint glass: clear amber-gold with a mountainous initial head, fading to a decent 1 cm ring that is maintained throughout; chunky retention in loose, thick bands.  Not much in terms of aroma, and I don't think it's just my choice of glassware. Maybe some biscuity malt and hop leaf? Tastes delicious, though. I think part of why I like it better now is that I've come to appreciate tasteful use of diacetyl -- the buttery sweetness is complemented by light hop spiciness and even lighter citrus notes. Solid malt backbone can't be denied.  Finishes somewhat dry but could be crisper for the style and my tastes. All in all, I think it's delicious because of the sweetness of the malt and diacetyl, but I think the slightly syrupy finish hurts its drinkability.

Okay but not particularly impressive to look at. Nose is mild hoppiness, a bit of fruit and malt. Taste is similar; some light graininess, piney hops, and some crisp fruit in there as well. Body is solid, although nothing too impressive.

35,104,HalfFull,2.62,"I think Harvard should take on this beer as a case study in Marketing, or perhaps contract brewing.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass it forms a nice dark head that lingers for a while and continues as moderate lacing on the glass. Taste and Mouthfeel disappoint. This is a shallow cousin, perhaps second cousin, of what this beer was ten years ago.  Living in San Diego I've been tasting this beer for many years, but would always cherish a trip to the East Coast to enjoy the real Sam. The one I served in 1986. The one that dethroned many a European beer 20 years ago as for my favorites. Alas, my last two trips have convinced me that that Sam is gone. Sam Adams BL in Boston is now the same as Sam Adams BL in San Diego. The lowest common denominator has won. This is a very sad day. The beer is boring and lifeless now, devoid of much character and tastes as if it's been pasteurized.  edit: Feb. 2009  Poured a bottle of Sam into my new Boston Lager glass. Color is lighter still, golden at best, and clear with a reduced head. Malt presence remains washed out. A bit smoky on the nose, rather dry. What happened to those Vienna malts? I pick up more hops but with a diacetyl butter flavor. Can't retain or regenerate any head. 'A head so thick you can float a bottle cap on it'? I don't think so. The degradation continues.

S - Smell is of bready malts, as well as light fruits. Nothing crazy, but it's not supposed to be.  T - Light malts, light hops, crisp and clean finish. Slightly spicy hop profile, but mostly fruity and generally light flavors...nothing remotely offensive. Finishes slightly drier and hoppier than expected. It's good.  M - Extremely light and sparkly, but has a nice creaminess thoughout.  D - Completely drinkable. Embodies the word.

35,104,comingbackdown,4.37,"1st try with this one, poured lovingly and carefully straight from the bottle into a handwashed, air-dried mug.  It poured a beautiful amber color, deep and appreciable.  Consistency: Thin, not watery, it's light and flows freely, but it's not watery.  Head: 3-finger head. Not aromatic, took a long while to dissipate. Didn't get a very good nose off it, so I waited for the head to dissipate and took a good nose.  Nose: Smell a bit of hoppyness, yeast, apple, cherry, vanilla-like, sweet, slightly smokey smell to it. Had to smell something else repeatedly to get all of these. My nose may not be finely tuned enough yet, but it pretty much crippled my sense of smell. It's quite strong for my nose to handle.  Taste: Bitter, but sweet at same time. Strong. Dark and smooth, good malt. Crisp feel. Bittersweet with a strong taste of hops at the finish, and a hoppy aftertaste. Quite nice. A very subtle hint of salt deep down in the flavor, just a hint of it. I found it after a second review with a mildly chilled beer mug. Just goes to show, beer is a delicate, wonderful, mysterious thing. :) Slightly uneven lacing this time, maybe because of a not-so-great pour on my part...  Mouthfeel: Light, slightly buttery, well carbonated, and very tingly. Leaves a warm taste in the mouth, slightly scratchy feel. I'd give the mouthfeel a 4.0, but... The mouthfeel is a bit too scratchy... Like a light, unobtrusive sandpaper, curiously enjoyable.  Overall: For a beginning reviewer, I think this stuff is great! I'm sure I'll wind up editing all my early reviews as time goes on, but this is good for a first.  So far, Therse are the beers I've tried: Old Milwaukee, Milwaukee's Best Ice, Sam Adams Summer Ale, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, and this.  Out of that list, This is the best damn beer I've had out of all of them.  Have fun, drink responsibly, and respect the beer.

Thats about it.  T: Got some mildly sweet malt that is perfectly countered with a good amount of hops. A very well balanced beer. You will also find a bit of grains and spice going on in there.  M: Has an appropriate amount of carbonation for the style. Cool and clean on the finish. Very refreshing.  D: Drink it. For mass produced this is good stuff. Never a bad call as they say.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pretty one dimensional, nothing really there to compliment the hops. To me the flavor is uninteresting at best. And I really needed something to follow it up to get sour and bitter tastes out of my mouth.  I'm at a loss as to how this beer is so well loved. Maybe a bit richer than macrolagers, but not very appealing. A little bit boring and a little bit unappetizing. Excessive bitterness and a metallic mineral taste put me off quite a bit.

S - Very appealing raisin/prune aroma from a great malt and hops balance.  T - Sweet malt begins and then slowly blends with floral and slightly spicy hops. Finish is fairly dry and bitter. Mildly obtrusvie cereal grain aftertaste.  M - Highly carbonated and a little thin. I think less carbonation and increased thickness would help this beer a lot. The flavor is there, but something else is off.  D - A good session beer, but the weird bitterness (like a lot of Sam Adams) holds it back.  I much prefer this beer on-tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The beer has a bit of hops in the nose with hints of yeast. It also has hints of some fruits. There is definitely a bittering from hops with some malty flavours that come through. The malts are mostly a caramel type taste. This beer is really fucking balanced and the lager taste isn't too dominant. Definitely one of the best lagers around. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy with some carbonation.  I could definitely drink a few of these.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Surprisingly hoppy in the nose, but with an ample amount of malts to back it up.  The taste is just the reverse of the smell, toasty caramel sweet malts at first, followed by almost the perfect level of hops to balance it all out, with a semi-dry finish. Very nice balance all the way through. Impressive!  Good medium mouthfeel with IMO a perfect level of carbonation.  Can't get much better in the drinkability... almost a perfect balance of flavors to keep it interesting, and the low ABV keeps it from going too much to your head.  To sum it all up, I don't do lagers very often, but this is excellent. Flavorful and well-balanced... a world-class beer!

This amber-hued larger is an American classic. It saved America's pride in Germany when it won a gold medal, and it is a favorite of German execs visiting the states.

35,104,jkrich,3.75,"12 oz. bottle with ""enjoy before month"" clearly marked on side of label. I noticed the patriot on the bottle has become much smaller and the words Samuel Adams much larger.  I poured the lager into a pilsner flute which left an incredible slightly off white puffy head which eventually settled to about two inches. The lager was a clear, deep gold to amber.  When opening the bottle I could smell fresh, spicy malts and good hop aroma.  The taste was smoothly sweet without any cloying flavors and a little hop tingle at the end. Years ago I considered this a very substantial brew. Now I am surprised how light on the palette this one is.  Again, this is a light-bodied brew which coats the tongue with tangy maltiness with faint hop bitterness.  Samuel Adams has done a great deal for the craft brewing movement, even if the beers are contract brewed. My Boston Lager was brewed in Latrobe, PA. I used to purchase this same lager that was brewed in Cincinnati, OH. I wonder if the taste varies based on where it is brewed?

At the Fort lauderdale Airport I had a pint that poured a clear and lively amber color with a solid white creamy head and fair lacing. The aroma brings on some nutty malt and wheat, a little buttery perhaps. The taste is a clean wheat bread and touch of rye. There's a bit of bitter mash, tangy carbonation and nice body for a refreshing lager. Very drinkable with a minor dryness in the finish.

I immediately fell in love with it just based on its appearance. It had a nice one finger head, and as I drank it down, it left lots of lacing.  S: Smell was of malt, with hops showing through very nicely and clearly. There was also a slight hint of alcohol, but nothing overwhelming. Very balanced, very clean smelling.  T: WOW! If this is what a good beer is supposed to taste like, I am hooked from sip one. At first sip, the malt came through very strongly, quickly followed up by hops, and a little bit of alcohol. Carbonation balanced with it all. All in all, a very tasty brew.  M: Excellent. Enough said!  D: Outstanding. I could drink a lot of these in a session.  Boston Beer Company has a good one here.

Mouthfeel: Very crisp with lots of carbonation.  Drinkability: Makes for an excellent go-to beer if the other options do not quite meet your standards.  I have heard a lot about Sam Adams Boston lager and never quite got a chance to try it until recently. I did not love this beer although it seems to have a very dedicated following.

Anyway, I had the opporunity to get my hands on some more when a friend went to Munich and picked me up a load. In the glass, the beer formed a beautiful head, about an inch thick which lasted right to the very last mouthful.

Smell - 4.0 Fruity and floral hops emanate from the head, an aroma of sweet biscuity malt develops with warming.  Taste - 4.0 Less of the hop flavour the suggested by the smell, but a full-on hop bitterness that is more akin to a Czech pilsener. Rich biscuity malt, starts moderately sweet, toasty with a strong aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Moderately weighted with a moderate to lively carbonation. Spot on.  Drinkability - 4.0 The extra personality and flavour make this beer less sessionable than many, but tasty enough to go back to again and again.  OVERALL - 4 Fantastically flavoursome, and an allround good beer. I will be buying this again, as I see it as very good value (although I'm sure it would be considerably cheaper in the US).

Found this as a single at a Kingston, Ontario LCBO. 4.80% abv, 355mL bottle.  Orange-amber body. Sudsy head - doesn't stick around for long, leaves a patch of bubbles. A bit of lace though.  Surprisingly hoppy nose - floral with a big caramel malt backbone. A bit of metal. Very clean and forward though.  Palate is sweetish, caramelish malty finish that then gets rather bitter. Spicy like a pilsener. A bit leafy.  Bizarrely APAish for a Vienna, except for the spice.

Bouquet of floral hops dominates with a wheat backbone. Taste similar to nose culminates in a clean, crisp finish with just a hint of wheat left lingering on the tastebuds.

D - Quite refreshing. Goes good with nearly any food you can think of. It could have a bit more presence, but it does just fine.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bobsy,4.21,"Sixer from the lcbo.  Pours a nice reddish-gold with a huge frothy head. The head has really good lasting power, and laces to the bottom of the glass. This is probably the best looking lager I have seen in a long time.The aroma is full of leafy hops with only the faintest hint of malt - its nice but could be more upfront. The taste is very good, slightly sweet malts lead through to a mildly bitter hoppy middle, before tailing off into a grainy dryness. There's a nice caramel and spice flavour underlying it all. The body seemed a bit light, and maybe a bit more weight would have made it more satisfying, but that's a minor quibble. The drinkability is ridiculous - this could be enjoyed all night long.  An eminently sessionable lager, and an excellent flagship beer from Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,halfP1NT,3.65,"Never took the time to review this, and I haven't had a Boston Lager in a long time, but someone left one in the fridge last night.  A- Dark golden and clear, one-finger creamy head, small bubbles rising from the center of the glass. Hmmm, has some nice sticky lacing.  S- Light, malty, a little bready, slightly floral.  T- Light malts at first, bit of caramel, then hops hit my tongue broadly. Almost a slightly dry finish, starts to remind me of tea after a while (I know-sounds weird.)  It's got that crisp, tiny bubble carbonation that tingles my tounge a bit. This was never one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams, but it's really not bad.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Kemmerlin,4.05,A: Golden red in color with a good solid head that sticks around for a few minutes.  S: Citrus and hops definitely a lot of hops to bad I can't smell te malts though.  T: Barley taste with floral hop flavors and a slight citrus taste as well but not much.  M/D: Very drinkable and I will definitely buy it again as a good sharing beer for doing work around the house. The feel is a little watery but good it helps the drinkability.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jajablon,3.56,"Pours a nice white head which dissipates quickly, but leaves lacing all the way down the glass. Color is a clear amber shade.  The aroma is one of malt and hops, a nice balance.  The taste, like the smell, is marked by hops, though not overpowering, and sweet maltiness. It has a mostly dry finish. A very drinkable beer.  When you're out at a big name grill or restaurant (applebee's, damon's, etc.) that doesn't have a lot of options in the brew category, Sam Adams is probably your best choice. Also, in comparison to other domestic lagers, i rank this slightly above the local favorite: yuengling.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CNeilP09,3.98,"The only reason anyone would dislike this beer is if they suffered from a glass-jawed toothache and a mental disease.  The middle of the spectrum of beer.  Typical coppery beer color.  Smells of cheap handbags and your grandma's hall closet. Not a bad thing, mind you, just a homey presence that blends into the girth of the beer.  The all American lager. Bud is the king, but Sammy Adams' Lager is the Monarch. Or something. Perfectly balanced in the grain bill and sweet seductive to the point of over exertion. Bill Walton would give a better description.  Drinks like a champ, because it is a champ.  Light and crisp, flavorful and robust for the style. you could drink this beer for hours, if needed.

There is some nice webbing on the glass as you drink.  The smell is initially of hops but then moves into sweet and caramel malts. Light floral aromas follow up.  Taste is balanced but slightly more malty then hoppy. It is sweet malt flavor with a slight astringent aftertaste from the hops. Its not a big hop finish but a pleasant bite and citrus note that is more apparent in the aftertaste.  Great mouthfeel, there is a nice carbonation to this beer that makes it clean and sharp. There is nothing else getting in the way of the brew's flavors. An excellent anytime beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jeonseh,3.79,"Bottle with a best before april 2008 and poured into the Sam Adams glass.  A - actually looks very nice in the glass. A dark honey color that becomes darker as it moves up the glass from a light gold to a dark amber. There was a nice head sitting on top that was composed of big bubbles just sitting on top.Also a ton of carbonation trailing up this one all the time.  S - hints of honey that came up from it and also with a hint of hops that seems to came up from it that adds a bit of citrus to the nose of this one as well.  T - overall, the first impression that I get is a big bready, shortbread flavor of malt that seems to come through. There is also a bit hit of orange, lemon and spice that comes through and counteracts the sweeter flavors that came through earlier. There is also a nice dry aspect to the beer that reminds me of the dry aspect that comes through in a white wine. Makes this be a very balanced beer that is really easy to drink.  MF - overall, a big thick on the palaette and has a nice body to it which makes it a step above the BMC's which of course Sam Adams is. This body in a way makes this beer more like one that I would rather drink by itself instead of with a meal as the bready aspect makes me feel a bit full after drinking it. There is also a nice zesty and alive carbonation that comes through in the later aspects of the glass that really lends to the orange aspect of the beer.  D - Overall this is one of the more drinkable and widely available beers that is out there and is also one of the first steps that most people take from BMCs to the craft beers. This would be a beer that I think you should definitely have at a party for people to drink up with. I thought it was a bit thick to drink a ton of or with a meal but overall a tasty brew that I think you could always easily find and pickup whenever company is coming over. A good summertime beer for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Malt has full roundness and nice caramel flavor. Hops are a little spicy, and piny. Mild residual ""sugars"" provide pleasant sweetness and compliment the residual carbohydrates left over from the decoction mash process.  M: Medium body with crisp carbonation.  D: Easy going drinkable beer.  Notes: Great choice at the bars that don't cater to my exotic taste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ommegoose,3.46,"Picked up in a Samuel Adams Brewmaster's Variety pack. Well within the freshness period.  Head retention was not that good, after a big pour. Rocky, big bubbles. Transparent copper amber color. Would look quite dark to the macro drinker, but seems rather light compared to some other Vienna Lagers. Leaves a ring of medium bubbles around the edge, with some film on top. Nothing left after a sip or two. A few streams of bubbles. I really like the color, but head retention is weak.  Nose is underwhelming. Smells lightly flowery. Getting some earthy hops. A little toasty with some spices. The poor head retention hurts the aroma a lot. Still, I shouldn't expect too much for the style.  The flavor is well-balanced. The malt character is pretty typical for the style. Some toasty, caramel notes, but doesn't go as far as a Marzen, for example. Hops are flowery. Nutmeg and cinnamon are among the spices present. Pretty crisp and dry, finishes with a nice amount of lasting bitterness. Strong amount of complexity for what is essentially a macro beer. Definitely some metallic notes though, which hurts  Carbonation is a bit too sharp. The beer seems a little thin. Must remember that this is a lager.  Very sessionable due to the 4.75% abv. Goes down easy. The satisfying finish makes it easy to pick up and have another sip. Better learn to like this one anyway, since it's the best beer at lots of lesser establishments, and sometimes the most adventurous your friends will get if you're getting pitchers. Also good to re-familiarize myself with this one since so many of the other SA beers have so much in common with the flagship brew. Worth revisiting on occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I don't know what the hell I was thinking the last time I had it, but this was really good.  It had a nice amber hue to the beer with a fair amount of head. It smelled and tasted superb, far better than I remembered. It went down smooth and, other than taking a moment to marvel at how good it was, I did not hesitate to crack open another.  I'm glad I was given another shot at Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kcillini77,4.2,"Picked up a 12 pack today. Certainly not my first Boston Lager, but my first review of it.  Poured into the Sam Adams Boston Lager glass I received from the company. Beautiful reddish gold color. Nice head with good retention.  Smell is floral, slightly piney, a little sweet.  Taste is mostly of sweet malt with hops on the swallow. Well balanced, definitely sessionable.  Nothing not to like here. Readily available brew from a world-class company. Nothing extreme here, but you know what you are getting and it is hands down the best mass produced lager you will find in the U.S.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hellcatsjg,3.98,"Appearance: Clear dark amber with a finger of white head. Surprising amount of lacing as you go. Nice job for a lager.  Smell: Nice mix of malts and hops. Again, very nice aroma for a lager.  Taste: Malts hit the tongue first and the hop flavor kicks in soon after the swallow.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with a surprising amount of hops in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Very high. Not the most complex or most delicious beer out there, but a very good beer. It's mix of nice flavor, lightness, and lower ABV make for a beer you could drink several of before you realized it. Very good beer, excellent lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,xare,4.43,"It's about time that I reviewed one of my favorite beers:  Pours as a golden amber color with a thick white head that laces well for a lager. Has outstanding appearance for a lager.  Smells include hops, citrus, and grains. Sweetness abounds from this mixture, enhancing its aromas but I wouldn't say that the smell is quite perfect. It's distinctive and well done.  Sam has a rich and complex mix of flavors but they're light at times as well. There's touches of a variety of things but it all mixes rather well together.  Mouthfeel is probably the weakest area for Sam as it goes down smooth but has an excess of carbonation at times. That kick from the carbonation throws its mouthfeel off.  Drinkability is outstanding for any beer with the complexity of flavors that this beer has. Overall, I wouldn't recommend that it's easy for everybody to drink, but it's pretty close to a perfect lager. Outstanding as a one-of or a session beer, but has a few flaws that prevent it from being a truly exceptional beer in every sense.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smell is a little wierd, not bad wierd, just heavily fruity with hops and hay. Taste has a little to much hops for a vienna lager, at least I think so- but their the ones bringing home medals now aren't they.  Mouthfeel is nice very smooth does not stick around to long, carbonation is a nice balance as well. Very drinkable, could easily have 3 more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Scents of thin light grainy/bready malt mix with some wispy hops in the back, very floral with some citrus and hay.  Taste is of grainy bread with a citrusy lemongrass middle. Hints of resiny hops bubble away with the carbonation. Soft grainy finish. Crisp.  Light-medium bodied, mostly clean and just a little sticky. Full carbonation tingle.  Really drinkable. Low abv and a mild yet flavorful balance make it a great sessionable beer. Not overly attractive as a stand out beer, but extremely consumable for what it is, a staple on-hand beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Aroma has a soapy note which is typical of this beer in every draft pour or bottle I have ever had. Flavor is surprisingly malty for a lager: toffee/caramel, I think. Moderate astringency. Some hops on the finish, but not excessively bitter.  This is a lager I can actually drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,sweethome,3.85,"Hmmm, so this is a Vienna? I've had Boston Lager about 1,000 time over the years - but never rated it here. I never considered it a vienna, more of an american lager. If I judge to Vienna:  This is quite light in color to style. Nice nose of noble hops, a hint of smoke, complex malt and hop profile.  Easy drinking beer. The key charachter is the spiceiness of the hops.  Again - don't consider this a Vienna - but avery tasty american lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A nice copper color with a long lasting head and sticky lacing on the sides.  The smell was very spicy & earthy. Borderline pungent! I can't wait to take a sip.  The taste was a blast of hops. Something you don't expect from a lager! Very spicy, cinnamon-like. The malty sweetness comes in afterwards, a very balanced beer.  The mouthfeel was mildly carbonated, very smooth. No complaints here.  I can't really sip this beer.

A: It poured a clear brownish orange with an off white abundant head that retained well and supported a leggy thin lacing.  S: It smelled of raw grains, lightly toasted malts and citrsy hops.  T: It had a deep toasted malt backbone that featured the floral and bitter hops well. There were hints of brown sugar and caramel and a very noticeable bite of dark spices.  M: It had a medium body with moderate to abundant carbonation that gave it a zesty bite and a clean finish.  D: Nice beer for a night of bar pool.

Fuller body than most macros. Nice carbonation.  Drinkability is awesome. I could put don A LOT of these.  Overall, for the price and the availability, this is the awesome brew that will be good on even the discerning palate.  02/28/08  I'm gonna re-visit the aroma on this one.

While the days of it being ""The Best Beer in America"" are long gone, this is still an easily accessible quite good tasting beer, that has been a saving grace for many a beer drinker.. otherwise faced with nothing but Bud/Miller/Coors.  The beer pours to a light amber, the head nice and fluffy and fairly sizable.  The smell is of hops first and foremost, while by no means a hoppy beer, the smell is quite fitting as one gets to the taste...  One could describe this beer as being balanced, neither the hop nor the malt dominating the other. Perhaps a slight edge to the hops, but one certainly won't confuse this with a hop bomb.  The drinkability is quite solid with this one, it's quite easy for a person to drink a few.  While my tastes have evolved through the years, this beer doesn't do as much for me as it did upon first discovering better beer. That being said I still love the fact that it can be found everywhere from grocery stores, to bars.. to chain restaurants.

Nice brown color with some gold hues, bubbles racing to the top. I've never head a Sam Adams Boston Lager in a pilsner like this and it gives it a very different appearance.  S - real American lager smell. Toasted hops, slight citrus.  T - much smoother and creamier than I ever remember a Sam Adams being. I think this glass made a big difference in taste as well. I may actually prefer it out of a slender pilsner as opposed to a tumbler or pint glass. The hops were much more subdued and the bitterness was lower.  M - nice creamy smooth mouthfeel. Not as much carbonation as it appears in the glass.  I like Sam Adams. When I was new to beer I really didn't like it. Nowadays it's a good go-to beer.

Head is average, and receded in about one minute, leaving full, off-white lacing near the rim of the glass.  Smell is light and faint, hoppy (piney) and slightly sweet (caramel). Not too strong at all, somewhat average.  Taste is pleasant, sweeter than I remember (I haven't had a SA lager in quite some time). It's sweet at first on the tip of the tongue, with a caramel malt flavor, followed by a subtle and well-balanced malt/hop combo, and finishes off with a crisp, hoppy note - piney, slightly citrusy. Not too bitter, not too sweet, but overall very mild.  Mouthfeel is very nice, with a good level of carbonation. Not too light or too heavy for the flavor profile, it coats the mouth well without being cloying.  Drinkability is good. Not outstanding, but good.

35,104,CJfromPhilly,3.83,"Pours a nice copper color with a foamy, 2 finger head that settles into a thin lacing. Modest carbonation. Aroma is sweet & malty with hints of caramel. Taste is an almost perfect balance of malty sweetness mixed with piney, grapefruity hops all swirled together. The finish is dry & bitter, with the pine & grapefruit notes being dominant. Mouthfeel is a medium fullness. Overall, a very good beer. This is very much deserving of it's iconic status in the craft world. I can't understand why so many people want to put this beer (and the others in the Samuel Adams family) down. Why?? Because it's become so successful & mainstream? Because it's gone from a small, one man operation to a high volume player in the beer world, thereby becoming ""too big & macro-like""? Bullcrap!!! If the boys at the big 3 brewed something this good, the beer world would be 10 times better off!!! Give this brew, & this compamy, it's proper respect!!!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SIRIUS2,3.78,"This is good beer! I was expecting a notch above the typical swill but was surprised with the complexity, smoothness, and just the general amount of enjoyment I got out of the brew. The color in the glass was a little more orange-toned than I was expecting and the hops were pretty well balanced with the malts.  I drank this beer with some salty pasta and it was perfect. It cut the saltiness and seemed to enhance the flavor of the pasta. The aroma was lightly floral with a hint of maltiness, which also seemed to go well with the pasta. All in all, this is pretty good stuff and I really did enjoy it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,zymurgy4all,4.07,"This is the good ol standby beer. If you can't get any micros in a restaurant, I have no problems ordering a good Sam Adams Boston Lager (I have no problem saying Boston since I'm from Texas--not NY). It pours a deep golden color with a great aroma of hops. Has a nice white head with good lacing. The flavor is totally impressive for such a mass marketed beer--you can tell Jim Koch was a true homebrewer from the beginning. There is a great hop flavor, slightly citrusy from the noble hops, and a wonderful malt flavor as well. It is crisp and clean, and quite possibly one of the most drinkable good flavor beers I've had. It also has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a great beer that you can usually find--even in Alabama where the beer laws are horrible (6% abv limit, bottle size limit--however no limit on abv of wine or liquor--go figure!) The only thing I don't agree with is the commercial that says hops are to beer as grapes are to wine--that makes almost no sense to me--you don't ferment sugars from hops--only from barley. I would say grapes are more like grain--hops are the spice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SirSaranac,4,"As a proud NY'er born and raised its in my blood to hate everything that comes from Boston... most notabley the Redsox. The one exception would have to be Sam Adams Lager (I'm unable to add BOSTON into the title, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth).... Now on with the review...  A- Poured a beautiful amber color with a frothy 2 1/2 finger head... heavily carbonated... leaves a spiderweb of lacing for the entire glass.  S- Malt.. cookie like malt... hops is also present... Overall a nice nose.  T- Very well balanced taste... Malt up front and then light hops fades out into a refreshing aftertaste. Caramel or other sweet notes are present as well.  M- Light/Light-Med body... heavily carbonated.  D- It's a good beer at a restaraunt or bar... I prefer this brew on tap, and most places have it... I like Sam Adams' approach to brewing, and helping create a national movement towards REAL beer",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BoitSansSoif,4,"A-Pours smoothly and forms a 1/2-inch head that lingers a couple minutes. This lager has a nice shade of marigold, a beautiful color rendered more so by good lighting. Decent lacing, and light but steady stream of carbonation. S-My first whiff caught a bouquet of fruit, pine and blossom, but that was it. Thereafter it was naught but hops and malt, and I hit a wall that numbed the olfactories. I couldn't place it, so I cheated and went down other reviews to see what it was. The closest thing I can think of is the chalk mentioned by Proteus93. T-Lightly toasted barley, flowery hops, and a lightly bitter, clean aftertaste. In the back of the mouth I pick up caramel and light butterscotch. Very pleasant. M-This stuff is delightful...smooth, creamy, carbonation is just right. D-Boston Lager can stand on its own, or accompany a wide array of foods. This is one of my favorite accompaniments when I eat anywhere that has a limited beer selection. That's why I love this brewery...they're small enough to make excellent beer, and large enough to be found anywhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Hatch,4,"12oz brown bottle with pry-off cap. Freshness date found on the bottle.  Pours a copper/amber with a decent white head about one finger thick with some nice lacing, decent lace retention.  Smells of pine and citrus, floral hops, sweet caramel malts. Nice and balanced, and quite aromatic.  While tasting you'll initially get a sweet bite from the malts, crisp, carmalized malts, finished out by hops with taste of pine and citrus which complement each other in a good way; very balanced. In the aftertaste there is some mild bitterness from the hops, and the pine notes come through again.  A medium-bodied brew that feels somewhat oily on the palate, yet remains crisp. Easy to drink; would make a nice session beer.  Notes: In my opinion, Boston Beer Company is the best nationally advertised beer company. They're not my favorite brewery by any means, but I don't think you'll find a better brewery that distributes nation-wide on such a large scale.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,drperm,3,"I gave this guy 3.0 all the way across -- not on purpose! It's really not a bad beer, especially when you're in the mood for an American lager. Better than Pete's Wicked Ale, for sure.  A clear, almond color in the glass is quite inviting. A bitter and coriander nose draws you in closer, revealing a taste of bitter hops. Perhaps a bit one-dimensional, but it's a good dimension nevertheless. A smooth finish leaves you pretty satisfied. A great session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Proteus93,3.94,"A: Honey gold pour, a fizzy and semi-creamy - if shortlived - head.  S: Mild hops, some straw-like malt scents, with a touch of a sweet nose. A little chalky. Sweet noses come out on immediate pour much more strongly.  T: A surprising, but pleasant, resiny hops taste. Malts sweeten it out in the body, a little honey-like... then a little buttery.  M: Quite crisp and refreshing, a nice 'dinner beer,' or something I would be quite satisfied with for watching a game, or lounging with friends, etc... good session beer, in less words. like a happy balance between some of the American macro breweries and the smaller scale craft brews.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

But for some reason, ultra fresh batch, or whatever, the bottle I had the other day was absolutely delicious!!  This one was in the holiday pack I purchased the other day in my opinion they should stick with their brew master collections or seasonal when putting these packs together.  I would also like to say thank you to Sammy because this brew really started the revolution for me back in the early 90's!  A - Poured a nice copper color with a pristine white foamy head that quickly faded into a mid size cap.  S - Nice floral hops which are not too over powering with toasted malt character in the back of the nose.  T - Old reliable! Very faint on the hops though. I know they try to appeal to the masses so I can't fault it.  M - Not as robust as it used to be, although full enough to thoroughly enjoy.  D - Very drinkable. A low ABV makes for a great session brew for beginner explorers into the world of endless choices!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,clayrock81,3.98,"Pours a copperish color with a minimal but frothy head that is constantly carbonating. A somewhat earthy, very hoppy smell that leaves some sweet malt like smell evident. It is hoppy and drying when it first hits the tongue but not overbearing like an IPA might be, and it does finish with some spice and smoothness from that carbonation. A creamy, heavy type body that fills the mouth, this can be a session beer but a few can fill you up. In this case that's a good thing, because I am using that phrase not to slam this beer but slam other beers that it takes a 12-pack to maybe break the seal. My ratings are a little biased because this beer is like a must-have beginner beer and disproves the old joke that American beer is like screwing in a canoe - not very good and close to water.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,deltatauhobbit,3.6,"Pours a clear golden/amber, good amount of head and some lacing.  Smell is mostly hops with a bit of malt.  Taste is very crisp, strong hop presence but is evened out from the malt. A very decent lager, one of the better commonly available lagers that populate beer stores, although not the first Sam Adams I'd reach for. This is typically the first resort of most restaurants that carry only BMC products, so I really appreciate this beer more than the score indicates.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The head has receded to a thin uneven nearly white cap by now, but decent lacing has been left behind. The aroma is better than decent, exhibiting a lot of sweet malt nicely. Hop aromas are more muted than I recall but still has a nice spiciness. Not bad.  As usual, I find the sweet malt to be almost overwhelming. Ah, there's the nice bitter kick in the finish. Again almost spicy. Without the strength of the hop profile I'd finish no more than half a glass of this.  Feels a bit thin across the palate and goes down easy, but it fills me up fast. Carbonation seemed pretty fine and appropriate as I drank it, but I sure feel full now.  I left an ounce or so of this in my glass, and now that I think about it that isn't unusual for this beer. I like it well enough - I just tire of it. I guess it's drinkable at first, but not for long, whatever that means. A nice fallback when there is little else to choose from.

Retains to half an inch.  Aroma: Rich caramel malts, sweet, floral hops, toasty & biscuity.  Taste: Plenty of caramel malt here, a touch of sulphur to remind me it's a lager and not an amber ale. Little grainy and sweet in the finish. Hops are a little spicy and provide a moderate bitterness. A surprising touch of diacetyl in there as well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, plenty of body, balanced.

When CostCo sells 28 packs for under $20 with coupon, you really feel bad when 27 of them are gone, & you can't honestly remember what one tastes like.  The beer pours out about as amber as Jurassic Park. A swampy two inch head of foam bumbles over itself as I drip out the remnants of the bottle. The suds quickly subside & I take a whiff. Slightly charred English muffins, spare change, & some mild pepper, the breakfast of champions. :P  Just like nibbling on some crusty buttered bread. The hop presence works perfectly to cut off the residual sweetness & leave a refreshing mouthfeel. Almost like a cold glass touching your tongue. the finish is just remnants of simple toasted crust & half a lick of copper.  The carbonation works hard, but doesn't singe or sting. A little slippery, & quite free-flowing. A little ""too"" light for my liking. Though that might be partially my fault. :P  A small group of us when through 27 of these over New Years, with me being no slouch. I never smelt any alcohol, but some fumes did reach me, especially right as the bottle is first opened. besides that, I can't think of much any fault.

Wet lacing drips down the sides of the glass. Earthy and floral aroma. Sweet biscuit malts and some saltine cracker makes up the backbone. What I like about the beer is the earthy hop flavors and the spiciness. Slight acidic finish and aftertaste. Light bodied makes this an easy to drink session beer. Active carbonation.

Taste has those same three components of toasted and caramel malt, which together form a very nice sweet and toasty flavor, along with some floral hops that give just a splash of bitterness toward the end.  Mouthfeel is a creamy medium-body, with a perfect level of carbonation. This is an extremely drinkable brew, a fantastic session beer.

Taste: Excellent nobel hop flavor. Some good caramel malt flavor. While the hop levels have been surpassed by true hophead beers, this still packs a good punch.  Mouthfeel: Quite good. Almost no aftertaste except for a few seconds of bitterness. The hopiness really cleanses the palate so you can truly taste the beer throughout the course of a drink or a full session.

The smell is light and balanced with malt grain and a hint of hops. The flavor is not complex, but subtle and pleasant with a solid grain and malt backbone, and some hops that linger long after swallowed. Mouthfeel is average for the size of the beer, and quite drinkable. At least this is a pretty good beer because it is available every where around here",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ccrida,3.77,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic, Boston Larger is a clear burnt gold, with a medium sized, bone colored head, which settles rather quickly to about 1/4 inch, leaving lots of foamy lace.  Smell is nice and spicy noble hops and a bit of cereral grain, but is generally soft and ester free, as a lager should be.  Taste is full, satisfying and clean. Nice rich malt profile and appropriate balance of hop flavor and bitterness. Aftertaste is long lingering hop bitterness and grainy, and would make a non-beer drinker go yuk. Not a bad amber lager, but a bit watery. I'll take Yuengling over this one every time.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin but well carbonated.  Drinkablity is a about average. If I'm at some type of chain restaurant with limited selection, I'd just assume have a German larger for the same price, but it's light enough in body and ABV to be able to really throw them back with ease. But I've only ever done that when there wasn't much else, like a wedding or BBQ.

Smells of floral hops and mildly sweet malts. A very nice blend I might add.  Taste is exceptionally well balanced. Malts come through initially, then the hops make their presence known.  Drinkability... come on... this is Sam Adams Boston Lager! It's one of the all time greats! If the place you're at doesn't have this, you might as well get up and leave, cause you're not going to find anything else worth drinking. Anyplace with ANYTHING worth drinking will have Sam Adams Boston Lager.  I probably speak for a lot of people when I say this is the brew that got me into quality beers. If it wasn't for Sam Adams Boston Lager, I'd still be chugging macro lagers. If you're trying to get friends to appreciate better beers, this is a great introductory brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nothing too extremely special but above average when compared to other lagers.  T - Nothing is overtoned in this beer. It is trying to get to the normal idea of just tasting beer. Nothing more, nothing less.  M - Not too bitter and no metal taste. Any standard beer like this is aokay in my book.  D - Easy drinkable beer. Good for just chilling out when needed. Not something to overly enjoy, but easy enough to drink during a football game or some quick social event.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Smixam,3.66,"The old standard. This beer is my baseline, where I judge almost all others. That doesn't mean its the best or the worst, but in terms of availability and overall quality, its set a great standard in the re-emerging American beer world.  This review is a bottle poured into a pint glass, but I prefer on-tap.  A - Just about perfect for my taste. Awesome medium amber color with a nice 1finger off white head that lingers for a good while. Very clear and lightly carbonated. One of the best looking beers I've ever seen.  S - Very nice, nothing terribly special or unique, but a good floral nose, strong hops and just a touch of an earthy malt. Very well balanced, and very appealing if not outstanding.  T - I love this beer for its mission, to bring taste back to everyday beer. That's exactly what it is; it's nothing extraordinary, but it's just so consistent and exceptional when taken in that regard. A really nice hop profile, and again those malt undertones are with you throughout. Maybe a touch fruity at the end. It's never overpowering, but it's very clean and flavorful.  M - Nothing to complain about here; no metallic aftertaste, not overly bitter. Consistency that you would expect from a macro, but quality you expect from a craft.  D - Excellent. I could drink only this beer for the rest of my days and be content, if a little bored! Not overly alcoholic, so this makes a good session beer. Great all year round - a chameleon for every season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Great color and clarity that holds a decent head. Great smell with an excellent hop balance. Very tasty, but doesn't need to be quite so sweet. Very smooth, but could stand to feel a little heavier in the mouth.

35,104,SMark,4,"This beer was poured from a 12 ounce bottle at 42º with a notched best by date on the label. The pour produced a huge, white, foamy head in the .51 liter glass which left quite a bit of lacing as it disappeared. A crystal clear, burnt orange and gold color filled the glass.  The hops were quite evident with a pine tree seeming to be in there somewhere.  The taste was balanced with the hops not asserting too much over the slight sweetness of the malt. Did not detect the roasted malt I was expecting.  This was a mouthful to swallow and brought back thoughts of my first experiences with this beer. I could not believe this was what a lager was supposed to taste and feel like when I was used to the mass produced efforts. This goes down smooth.  My first real memory of a beer that was brewed for all the right reasons. This has led me to try many different beers and ales (just joking). Although I had tried the Pilsner Urquell, Heineken, and other beers over the years (and I regret that I do not remember if any of them were ales), the marketing and smaller brewery explosion thankfully brought this to my attention.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Gambrinus1184,3.85,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into Saranac pint glass.  A: Poured a light, reddish copper color with a rocky two-finger head of off-white foam. Carbonation seems sparse; very clean looking.  S: Smells like sweet toast; grainy scent and sweet malts. There's a dash of noticeable hops also.  T: Rich caramel malt flavor with a well-balanced bitterness that makes this one of the more even lagers I've had. A pleasant amount of pine oil hops stays in the back of my palate.  M: Very clean and crisp. Cleansing, refreshing and enjoyable.  D: One could drink this standby til the cows came home, if they so chose to. Modest ABV, great balance, and good flavor makes for great drinkability.  I'm not a huge fan of regular 'ol Sam Adams when anything else is really available, but it's a great session beer choice for non-BMC, non-adventurous beer drinkers. I'd have again if it were the best available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance: Coppery golden beautiful Lager with a nice three-finger head, upon pour that is easily rejuvenated over and over again. Considerable lacing about the glass on the way down.  Smell: Deep toasted bread and butter, some hops, vanilla, well-balanced and very pleasant.  Taste: That's what it is all about here. A fine blend of malts, hops, deep and continuous that never thins out or becomes boring.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, yet full. Kind of like eating a good steak.  Drinkability: Well, given the realtively low ABV, this one could be around over and over again all night, interrupted by a few other tastings of a more powerful sample. A great beer overall, especially as an ""in-between"" something a bit stronger. My son (this beer is his favorite) can knock off a bunch of these without a problem and never ends up acting stupid or silly.

35,104,Gehrig,4.33,"Like an old friend, Boston Lager is always a beer easy to come back to, steady and reliable. With all the other treats Sam Adams brews, and with my own wandering taste buds, I usually only drink the Lager when it comes as part of a mixed pack, in this case Winter Classics. Yet it's always worth getting around to as I usually immediately delve into the Holiday Porter, Old Fezziwig, Winter Lager and Cream Stout. Its bold taste still impresses me, and brings me back to when I first encountered it well over a decade ago.  The presentation is very good, a deep, clear golden color that almost has a tinge of orange. The head is two fingers thick, and laces the glass nicely as the beer is consumed. The taste is bold, hoppy and moderately carbonated, but smooth and easy to consume. It compares quite favorably with Molson Canadian Lager (which I find pretty decent) in terms of flavor and appearance. A very good steady, and great to come back to after several months away.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The wheat taste hits upfront followed by a yeasty flavor. The hops do not hit until the finish where their earthy presence can be picked up. Rather well balanced for a lager.  As always with Sam, the carbonation is a bit much, but the viscosity is just fine.  This is a very drinkable brew.

An easy beer to put down and also a nice choice when out at bars or sporting events that have a limited selection. I think I had my first Sam Adams twenty years and figued I might as well review it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Floydster,2.93,"Pint from Hennessey's in Hermosa Beach  Poured a golden yellow with a nice foamy head, about 3/4 of an inch  Smell was yeast and very very light hops, not much at all  Taste was a little malty for a longer, but had a dry and smooth finish  Could drink a whole lot of these, but they are a little heavy",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,KodyBrannon,4.58,"Poured this beer out of a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, Poured a dark amberish color with a 1 finger creamy colored head. The smell was a bit hoppy with a hint of wheat. The taste was of hops, and very light mouth feel. Over all this beer was of good quality. I would definatly pick this one up in a pinch and drink it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GRPunk,3.85,"Bottle poured into a pint glass  A- It poured a dark golden-amber with a 1"" creamy off-white head, medium carbonation, and good lacing.  S- The hops were earthy scents of pine and grass paired with a buttery cracker scent of the malts.  T- Mostly a bready flavor with oily and grassy tones from the hops.  M- It had a full feel in the mouth and noticeable carbonation.  D- Definitely easy to drink more than one in a sitting.  Overall- A good medium bodied beer that is easy to drink during any season. A solid offering. Availability makes this a nice option at the chain restaurants and places not known for expansive tap lists.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JamesS,3.95,"If I were going to go to the store and just pick up a six-pack of a basic lager, this would be the one! It was certainly good at my work picnic get-together from last night. It has a very nice color, ranging from a nice dark tan to copper, depending on the lighting. I very much enjoy its aroma, very strong without overpowering. although it goes down smooth, it's definitely not a chugging beer. It has a wonderfully complex taste and would be the perfect beer to convince your friends who make fun of craft/micro-brewery drinkers that they need to reevaluate their stance.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Jonte,4.45,"Amber color and a frothy off-white head that is mostly diminishing in a few minutes, fair lacing.  Smells of malt, caramel sweetness, fruit/citrus, spicy and a bit sour.  Tastes of sweet maltiness and caramel at first, then moderate bitterness and some citrus/sourness and fruitiness. Very balanced and a bit dry. Remindes me a little bit of an ale.  Smooth and medium bodied. Lively carbonation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,meechum,4.3,"Had this on tap tonight. I'm not going to break this beer down..it's probably the backbone of most people's finer beer experience. This is in my opinion the best lager out there.

35,104,ArrogantB,3.63,"The color on old Sammy was orange with a decent fluffy head. Smells faintly earthy, tastes muddy and also lager-like clean at same time.

35,104,IPAcraig,4.27,"Sam Adams Boston Lager, my favorite beer for the longest time. Once described by my roommate as having ""too much flavor""  A - Pours a nice transparent amber, with a sizeable head.  S - It has a caramel sweetness in the aroma, followed by a hint of spicey hops. A hint of biscuit as well.  T&M - This beer as a very big flavor, but still remains a very light and sessionable beer. It has a nice malty backbone and finishes with a the tingling sting of hops. A dry bready taste adn crisp finish is apprent as well.  D - I love this beer and could drink it every day. It is hugely flavorful without being over the top in alcohol or hop bitterness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,domtronzero,3.31,"Pours a deep amber gold into the pilsner glass. Large bubbled, tightly packed creamy off-white head, leaving a little lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma is very malty, but a pleasant grassy hoppy flavor does come through. Flavor is caramelly sweet and strongly of toasted malts. A nice floral/citrusey hop presence lasts through to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and heavy at first, but surprisingly easy to drink. Overall its a decent brew, worth a try. I'm not a big fan of American lagers, but this brew is definitely a step above the commercially brewed American beers. Nothing like those ""other guys.""",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,zerofear13,3.45,"I've had Samuel Adams Boston Lager a few times. The first time I've tasted this brew it was probably my 10th beer of the night, so it was not a good judgment call, but I do distinctly remember it being really heavy, but I dismissed the thought as I figured it was probably because I had drank too much. Under sober conditions, I've found that the 12 oz. bottle pours out an attractive head. Nothing fancy, quite simple in appearance. The smell is strong spices and hops. The taste is quite good, reminds me of real earthy tones and spices, with a good blend of hops. But just like when I was hammered, this brew was filling as all hell. Quite thick and dense for a lager and really makes it hard to go through too many. Overall, I don't think this is Samuel Adams' best brew. They have such a huge selection that I think there's something for everyone, but this lager is just a starting point.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A: amber with golden highlights. two finger white frothy head with good retention. medium carbonation  S: floral hops, citrus. caramel and wee bit of pine  T:sweet maltiness, hop bitterness. nice balance. Good stuff.

35,104,bluesfan1181,3.95,"Best before July 07. Got this one a little late but, the taste didn't show it. Poured in to a clear pint glass. Has a rich, deep golden color that most American lagers lack. Nice two finger off white foam head that disappated over time. I got a slight lacing from this beer. Smell is full of hops and barley. One of the hoppiest American lagers I have ever tried. Taste is full flavor that did not let me down. You can really taste the hops and a slight bitterness that blends together perfectly. The feel is about average but thats not the most important aspect to me. This is a very drinkable, well rounded beer. Very smooth. It has taken it's place as being my favorite American lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Monkeyknife,3.1,Poured from a bottle a deep clear gold with a frothy white head which faded to about an eighth of an inch. Not much on the lacing side with this one.  Aroma is slightly sour and crisp.  The taste is also on the sour side and crisp. A bit of biscuit is also noted.  Mouthfeel is crisp and light to mid-bodied with mild carbonation.  This one is easy to drink. Used to be one of my favorites but has fallen due to some other beers.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JustinBathurst,3.52,"Pours a clear reddish gold with a big sudsy head that remains a nice covering all the way to the finish line.  In the aroma, the hops cut right through exceedingly well, with notes of citrus, cheerios, and some apple.  The mouthfeel is crisp, with lots of carbonation.  The taste is omnipresent bitterness (not too overpowering), lemon, caramel, and a touch of this horsefeed and raisins mixture that I've detected in some other brews (which normally I greatly dislike, but it is here in such a small way that I don't find it displeasing). The aftertaste is a bit chalky dry.  Not a bad lager at all.

35,104,kkipple,4.07,"Y'know, sometimes after a house party, after the guests have gone and the cleaning is mostly done, and you rummage in the fridge to come up with a donated Beer That isn't Crap, finding a Sam Adams Boston Lager can be the highlight of your evening. For some reason I've neglected to review this brew, so into my bulbous Sam A. glass it goes!  A. Nothing special here, we gots a clear orange-red beer with a respectable off white head that leaves hints of lacing on the glass.  S. This smells like coming home. I've smelled and enjoyed this beer in bars and homes for years -- often it's been my savior, delivering me from the woeful clutches of Bud Light and PBR. A light biscuity sweet malt aroma is wound tightly around a gentle citrus hop presence, with caramel and a mild huskiness evident. The aroma is just basic and good.  T. Boston Lager is a very solid, if tame, beer. Sweet caramel malts dance across the tongue, and lightly bitter (vaguely English) citrus hops provide the needed bitterness to keep you coming back for more. This is a well balanced labor of love. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but alive and smooth. Carbonation level is rather high, and the beer foams up a little in my mouth, giving it a full, creamy bent that helps this beer out.  Sam Adams Lager is a genuine classic. II have been told this was a revelation when released -- a well crafted microbrew that could stand against, and win against, the Big Three. It's hard to underestimate the impact Sam Adams has had on the craft beer world, and so the next time you find a bottle of this hidden away in your friend's fridge behind the Corona and Miller, thank God for Jim Koch and this beer that started it all.  Oh yeah, it went real well with my bratwurst and sauerkraut. Wish I had another...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

""younger"" days.  back when i didn't appreciate beer as much, i soon tired of it since it was always around. now is the first time i to come back and review it for what it is: a pretty decent lager, and which i now realize is classified as ""vienna"" in style.  pours a nice light amber. nice off-white head, leaves behind decent lacing.  there is a floral hop aroma, maybe a hint of hay or grassiness. sweet caramelized malt note is detectable too.  the carbonation immediately brings forth the hop profile, somewhat spicy, prominent bitterness. finishes with carmelized maltiness and slight yeasty/bread character. clean, mildly bitter aftertaste.  a bit thinner than i remembered from days past. also not as ""smooth"" as other lagers, both macro and micro.  still, it's an easy-drinking classic, and for better or worse, a constant symbol of pride for new england.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,GratefulBeerGuy,4.1,"I'm actually really glad I never reviewed this before (which is a suprise) because on July 18 2007 (3 days before my b-day) I recieved (2) of the Fancy 16 oz. Samuel Adam's Boston Lager glass's...FOR FREE! just because I was a founding member of BA magazine. What an amazing gift!! Thanks everyone who was involved in this amazing generosity. Obviously, short after recieving these glasses I *ran* to the nearest store and purchased the SA Black Lager and Boston Lager six-packs. F$%^&! genious marketing by SA if you ask me.  AP: Golden amber, big carbonation with a tornado of activity at the center of the glass and many big-ass bubbles. An all-white 2"" foamy, glorious head dissipates nice 'n slow to a constant thin cover.  Nose: A wonderful herbal, hearty, zesty hop and yeast aroma really permiates out of the glass and a smooth buttery caramel-like malt sweetness is closely behind. This glass absolutley enhances the aroma spectrum of this beer.  Taste & Feel: This medium bodied brew feels smooth and hefty with it's buttery malt, not at all thin and lifeless, it delivers a nice bite with it's up-front complex hop flavor that's zesty, mossy and herbal!

It pours a nice rich carmel color with a medium head. It smells like a beer that only uses good quality ingredients. Malty and hoppy with no other odors that aren't supposed to be there. No banana, orange, lemon, or any other fruit crap. Just pure beer taste. The taste is exactly what a lager is supposed to be. This is the beer that I compare all other Lagers to.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pours an amber brown with a white head that retains a one finger white head that leaves beautiful sticky lacing throughout. Smells of floral hops with a strong malt backbone with caramel hints. Nothing stands out in its taste aside from a slightly hop bite finishing things out that fades. Malts don't have the caramel taste that I found in the nose. Mouthfeel is light as expected and this brew is extremely drinkable. Its a good tail gating / go to beer.

S: A little sweet with nice hoppiness  T: Very hoppy with a nice malty sweetness on the finish  M- Light and bubbly. Clean crisp finish.  D- Very easy to drink. As an added bonus, SA does not cut corners with additives and cheap fillers. Subsequently, you can drink many of these and never feel crummy the next day.  Overall: I love this beer. Though I have ony started reviewing here, I have probably tried 50 or so different beers, and this one is currently my favorite.

35,104,Bowdoinbeerboy,3.69,"Appearance- Pours a light brownish color with an off white head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves some tracing.  Smell- Strong odor of hops in the nose, some undertones of fruityness and spice, carryovers of the hoppiness.  Taste- A fairly earthy taste for a beer that smelled so hoppy and fruity, nothing really jumps out at you other than some bite from the hops but this is mild and pleasantly fades to aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- Medium thickness in the mouth which helps the flavor linger longer than it otherwise might.  Drinkability- A very good session beer, a few of these would be delightful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A- Dark golden yellow, 1 finger head, good carbonation, mild lacing S- Sweet maltiness with mild hop aroma T- Medium hop bite upfront with a strong malty backbone M- Tingly carbonation and a medium body D- Easy to drink, smooth and suprising taste for a mass producer, its hard to just have one.  I have always thought Samuel Adams was a good all around beer, its available everywhere and makes for a good fallback brew when some of the more ""Craft"" types are unavailable.

Taste - Begins with a usual light lager sweetness. Quickly replaced by quite prominent grassy hops flavor. Light, but flavorful. Nice to taste some hops in a mass-produced lager.  Mouthfeel - Light.  Drinkability - Certainly a good beer to drink when choices are limited. Simple amount of flavor puts other macros to shame.

35,104,ComradeCanadia,4.23,"Famous enough brewery, but I rarely see any Sam Adams up in Edmonton, so I snagged this as I wished for a lager. Was not disappointed.  Appearance: Poured a very nice pale caramel colour with an off-white head, which went away very slowly, and reluctantly. Even at the last sip there's a bit of ring. Very nice looking beer.  Smell: Relatively mild smell, bit of citrus from the hops with some grassier undertones, some roasted grains, and well, just general sweetness to the entire bouquet.  Taste: This is -great-. Very smooth with a crisp finish that has just the right amount of hops. One of the best lagers I've tried.  Mouthfeel: Just enough carbonation, and decent enough body.  Drinkability: Low ABV (4.5 I think?) and a nice finish makes this pretty easily drinkable. Kind of a stickiness to it after a bit, but I'd still consume this all night.

S- citrus hops, some mild malt and toasted grains and cleam spring water, almost earthy.  T- more cituus, bitter orange & grapefruit, burnt pancakes, loads of floral hops, a little oak sap resin, and roasted nuts. great balanced aftertaste.  MF- slightly chewy and not too dry, thins one beckons more gulps, especially on a hot summer night.  D- completely balanced, great carbonation, it's no wonder that boston lager is the top sam adams seller in my area. many fizzy yellow beer drinkers have been converted thanks to this beer. i know, because i'm the one that pushed it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nice and clean.  Taste is of light caramel with a bit of green apple crisp tartness. Grass and hay and earth from the nobles round things off nicely. Again, very clean and enjoyable.

35,104,Cresant,3.92,"I picked up a six-pack of this after receiving my Sam Adams glasses in the mail (sadly one was broken). I poured the 12 oz. brown bottle into the specially/specifically designed SABL glass. Best by 11/07.The body was a clear, rich golden color. The chunky head was more than two fingers tall and creamy white. The head left faint lacing down the glass. (The glass is very ergonomic and fun to drink from).  Smell was of clean grainy malts. There was a floral, earthy noble hops aroma. Very appetizing.  Taste was nicely balanced with malty sweetness evident first and then a crisp hops bitterness. The bitterness is not quite piney yet earthy and mildly pungent.Flavorful but somewhat understated. I liked this more than I remembered.  Mouthfeel was medium in body with a snappy zip of carbonation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,wcdoyle,3.86,"Pours a clear gold, trending toward (reddish) copper. Starts off with a dense, off-white one-inch head. This dropped down to about an eighth inch, but never went away. Great lacing. Nice signs of carbonation edging up from the bottom of the glass that kept chugging along even after a few minutes. In fact, they were still slipping up at the bottom of the glass. [N.B. This is without the new Sam Adams glass.] Smells initially of peach and caramel together (the fruit is light) with some hops backing up. Sweetness (but not oversweet) in the taste comes off like a combination of vanilla and light brown sugar. Hops fill in toward the end and in the aftertaste. Great creaminess to this and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. While Ive enjoyed Sam Adams for a while, Ive never actually reviewed the Boston Lager until now. Two things strike me: first, its good to remind myself that lagers can have a depth of flavor (macro-lagers do lagers a disservice). Second, its nice to see that Sam Adams flagship brew is still a worthwhile beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jcdiflorio,4.45,"Poured into the new SA glass from my draft system. Reviewed in bottle,but not draft wanted to try in the new glass that it was made for. Happen to have it on tap when the new glass arrived.  Very creamy slightly off-white head with very good retention leaving some thick lace curtians down the glass. Medium amber/copper color very clear. Constiant streams of carbination rising from the center of the glass,but not knitted together.  Very spicy aroma cinnamon/nutmeg like,minty,slightly buttery.woody and floral with a slight bit of sweet carmell malt.  Woody earthy taste comes across first,spicy not a spicy as you would think from the aroma. Clean,tangy very well balanced. Very toasty,slightly nutty with some bittersweet carmell notes. Leave somewhat of a tart taste lingering. Very good pleasing taste.  Light to medium body,creamy,grainy and slightly cloying.

35,104,jmalex,3.77,"Sadly I've had other beers in my new Sam Adams glass before this one, but I'm excited for the chance to have the beer that this glass was made for.  APPEARANCE: Pours a crystal clear pale amber with very slight red tones to it. The white head is small and drops to a patch of haze across the surface of the beer. Small carbonation bubbles ascend from the strategically placed etching at the bottom of the glass constantly keeping some form of bubblage happening.  SMELL: Very clean with a strong toasty element to it. A bit of sweet malt shines through, as does a hint of European hops.  TASTE: The flavor is initially a tad empty and possesses just a sharp bitterness to it, but it mellows out quickly and a sweet toasted flavor prevails. Hops show for just a split second on the finish before becoming quite clean.  MOUTHFEEL: Light to medium-light and appropriately so. Carbonation is at moderate levels and is close to where it should be.  DRINKABILITY: A nice easy drinker. I don't think I need to tell you that one could be drinking these all night long with no problem.  A fine lager and a fitting flagship beer. This shows that the Boston Beer Company produces some quality brews and is certainly no macro brewery.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,neonbrown82,4.23,"After being surprised to find two of the new Sam Adams pint glasses at my doorstep, I figured I owed it to Jim Koch to pick up some of his beer. After not being impressed by any other Sam Adams brews, I was quite surprised to find how much I really enjoy this one. The free glassware surely doesn't hurt my impression either, however.  The beer pours into my Sam Adams pint to a clear golden amber color with a nice active carbonation spitting forth from the laser etched bottom. Great looking head with a decent retention. Very nice lacing.  The smell is good. Has a clean lager aroma with a good dose of hallertauer hops. Nice soft malt profile.  The taste is very good as well, and on par with the nose. Clean pilsener malt taste with hints of other light biscuity German malts. Very crisp and clean. Plenty of hops flavor in the finish with a light refreshing bitterness.  The body is fairly thin and dry. Crisply carbonated. Very easy drinking. I'll be picking this up much more often when I am looking for a session beer. I can't quite comment on how much this glass really improves the beer since this is my first time trying it, but I still love the glass, whether or not it truly does what it is intended to do. Thanks again, Mr. Koch.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,cjhofelt,3.8,"Copper color and clear, nice creamy head, good lacing.  Smell is dominated by malt with just a hint of the hops  It tastes very good. Malty up front and not overly sweet. More of the hops in the finish, but still some malt sweetness there too.  The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, but not bad.  I like this beer and I could drink a lot of it. I do think it's a tad pricey, though, and that's why I don't.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Atlas1,3.75,"I got one of those cool new Sam Adams crazy glasses the other day and I just HAD to put it to use on the Boston Lager. Thank you, Jim Koch and BA people for providing me with a free new crazy glass.  Pours a bright orange/amber color with a slightly off-white lacey head. It's been a while since I've had a Boston Lager and I just didn't remember the beer looking this pretty before. Maybe it just looks good because it's in one of those crazy Boston Lager glasses. Who knows? But I do see the steady stream of carbonation bubbling up from the laser-etched circle on the bottom of the glass, so that's cool. The nose on this beer is smooth and malty; a richer aroma than I remembered as well. Lightly earthen fruit esters emerge, but the rich caramel malt scent is dominant here. Damn, maybe this glass really does work, because this is a very nice scent. It tastes slightly malt-sweet up front, with an herbal quality to it, and finishes with a lingering hoppy bitterness. Not a bad flavor at all, but then again the Boston Lager has always been dependable. Nice sturdy mouthfeel.  Admittedly, this beer has never been my favorite, but it's always been a solid and reliable alternative to the macros and many other inferior craft beers on the market. It's available everywhere these days, which is probably why I don't drink it much, but I'll be glad to give her a go every now and then in the future simply because I have this funky new glass to pour it into. That's some crafty salesmanship right there, it is. But for a solid beer like this, what's wrong with that?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,EPseja,4.18,"Served from a 12oz bottle at just below cellar temperature in my brand-new Samuel Adams Boston Lager Beer Glass, engineered especially for this beer. I've had this beer countless times in the past and know it quite well. It will be interesting to see if this glass actually adds new aspects in which to indulge...  A - Pours picture perfectly with liquid up to the blue rim and with a beautiful, pillowy head that actually rises above the lip of the glass. The varying thickness of the glass makes for different coloring at different points -- rich, sunny honey at the bottom changing in gradient fashion to a bright, fire-kissed copper-gold at the top. Lacing is craggy and tenacious, and the etching on the bottom of the glass keeps the surface of the beer completely obscured by the ever-replenishing head. With a proper tip of the hat for as assist from the glass, this beer looks especially beautiful, but because it's the glass that helped, I can not award the perfect 5.0.  S - The first thing that comes to mind is warm biscuits. The malts are especially evident up front. Not far behind is a crisp, punchy hoppiness that is neither citrusy or piney, but slightly earthy, green and dry. Very European. Notes of woodiness and hints of leather. Never picked out those ""old"" notes before... Interesting and inviting.  T - Candy like maltiness up front -- honey-like notes and a slight toasty character, with a great balance of hoppy bite and bitterness coming in the middle. The hops are not especially aggressive, but existant in a way that keeps the bold malts in place. The sweetness falls off quickly during the swallow, and what's left is a bready, biscuity aftertaste with floral nuances. Alcohol is well supressed. Fiercely balanced, if that dichotomy makes any sense.  M - Not watery, not thick, but well developed in texture. A quick hit of aggressive tingle is replaced by a tickle of fading carbonation as it moves through the mouth and becomes frothy and mouth-filling. Swallow is full of nice body, without gassiness.  D - I've said it once and I'll say it again now -- this beer is the A-number-one go-to beer to always have on hand for both yourself, and anyone else who is ready to enter into the world of full-flavored beers. My wife was a Heineken disciple until she met me, and I served her her first Sam Adams Boston Lager. Today, she won't touch Heineken with a 10-foot pole.  This beer is super drinkable, with enough character to set it squarely apart from others, while remaining surprisingly accessible, despite the high-quality of ingredients and the not-so-mainstream style.  ADDENDUM: The one place where this glass really made a difference was in appearance. Secondly, it was very comfortable to drink from. The effect it has on smell is not really noticeable until the beer drops well into the bowl area, where the aroma becomes more concentrated. Nice glass!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CharlieMopps,3.85,"A: Pours a transparent amber/burnt orange, with about two fingers of fluffy head that displays above average retention, leaving behind a web of lace down the sides of the glass.  S: A whiff of breadiness and some malt presence, with a backing note of hops.  T: Malts come out up front, flavorful but not overpowering. A pleasing hoppiness comes next, but washes over the palate smoothly. Aftertaste is a clinging hop feel.  M: Carbonation is at an agreeable level, with only a slight oiliness from the hops.  D: A tasty Vienna lager, with more zest than others of its ilk, which proves to be standout and delicious. I'm glad this is a more common option for many American beer drinkers, as it certainly dwarfs the macro lager offerings.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bluemoonswoon,4.24,"Continuing with the summer mix pack with this nice lager, 12oz bottle poured into snifter (thought I'd let this one breathe) best before October freshness date.  A: Real nice looking the best of the bunch for this mixed pack so far. Pours a clear brownish orange with a two finger bone white head the fades into a thin cap with nice lacing even on the snifter.  S: Quite nice with a buttery apple sweetness with hints of orange peel floral hop character and a great malt backbone, very inviting I think my mouth is watering.  T/MF: Pretty smooth sweet and slick as expected with a nice hop bite down the center of the tongue. Tastes of apples upfront with buttered cracker on the end, more hops than I would expect for a lager and the apples last through the finish, it's a little hard to pick the malts out of this one as compared to other lagers I've tried Bergoff to be precise, the hops seem more active here. The mouthfeel is quite nice with carbonation active from the front to the back of the mouth, spreading flavor all over the pallate.  D: Quite drinkable and an easy pickup when nothing else is around, not mindblowing or tasty as other lagers but very solid notheless.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,KevinB,3.37,"One of the classics at this point, like many others this was one of the first micros I had back in the day. Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice erythrean orange, golden body with a foamy 2 finger white head. Light steady lacing throughout the glass. Pretty solid malt and hops aroma, nice balance between the two. Taste is also a nice balance between hops and caramel malts, resulting in a rich flavor for a some what light ,medium bodied beer. Mouthfeel was pleasant, medium carbonation, pretty clean feel and a tad of dryness in the end. Overall a very good beer and a fail safe option.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,giblet,3.38,"i enjoyed this lager yesterday. nice body, nice carbonation but a little less lace than i expected. not as much smell as i like but it is a lighter style of lager.  this is a very good beer. i would recomend it as a much superior option to the macro beers that everyone buys.  good choice as is most of their offerings.  suckem up and movem out!  giblet",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kwakwhore,4.33,"Clear orange/gold pour with a nice white head which leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass. Floral hops in the aroma. Nearly perfect balance of hop bitterness and biscuit malt flavors, some sweetness in the malt too. I've had this beer so many times that it's hard to separate the occasions, but this is a consistently good beer. Easy to find, easy to drink, the perfect session beer in the good old US and A. I haven't had another Vienna Lager(including a couple in Vienna) that measures up to it in any respect.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,khiasmus,3.91,"Had this for the first time in a while at a local steakhouse, and was amazed by how good it was.  A- Pours perfectly clear with two fingers of fluffy white head. Bubbles constantly, and leaves a beautiful lacing down the sides.  S- Malty, balanced by american hops, but both are very evident and well-done. No off notes, just a good, balanced aroma.  T- Once again, a well-balanced, basic beer. The balance is a bit towards the malt in the flavor, and a hint of pine and hops in the finish.  M- Smooth, medium-high carbonation, clean, with a hint of dryness in the finish.  D- Of course. It's cheap, available everywhere, and quite good. Order this next time you go out for a steak. It's not disappointing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,williamherbert,3.87,"The bottle pours a light and relatively clear copper color. Lots of little bubbles of carbonation. There is a minor rocky head that disappears pretty quickly. There is a slight haze in the glass, possibly because it's straight out of the fridge. Only a bit of lace.  The beer has a nice ""wet"" malt aroma; slightly sweet and even a little fruity. In fact, it has the sweet fruity tones of an ale. Doesn't have any of the bitter smell of many lagers.  The malt is much more bitter in the taste than in the smell. The flavor retains the flowery part, which must be the hops (and the only trace of hops at that). Has a taste more like an ale. Slightly bitter aftertaste.  It feels thick like an ale, but with that ever-so-slight lager ""sting"" at the end. I must say, it's a very competent macro lager. It really does drink more like a thicker ale. Not bad.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,eberkman,4.37,"Well, I've had God knows how many of these in my lifetime, but I never got around to reviewing it. And with so much else available, I rarely order one of these anymore -- basically I drink it if it's the best option at a party, bar or restaurant. Which is too bad, because it's really much better than that, as I realize everytime I actually have one.  Anyway, it pours a nice, clean, clear orange-gold with a short but substantial white head. Not much head retention, but just enough. Smells are biscuity, malty, yeasty with some hoppy notes at the back end. The taste matches the smell very nicely -- lots of earthy, bready maltiness balanced out very well by pleasant but not overpowering hops. The mouthfeel is crisp with some bite. Extreordinarily drinkable. Probably -- along with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale -- the ultimate American go-to session beer. Certainly the most sessionable lager I can think of, though Brooklyn can give it a nice run for the money.  I should really come back to this one more often. Definitely a classic. And hey, why not support the ""locals"" (though that would be more rock-solid if I actually had any ties to Cincinnati).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Stephen63,4.1,"A - Looks like amber nectar!  S - Pleasantly sweet with candy like aroma.  T - The sweetness was very apparent and welcome. Toffee/caramel flavour was dominant.  M - Very pleasing level of carbonation.  D - Extremely easy to drink and could spend an evening drinking this.  Got this at the TGI Fridays in Glasgow. Apart from this the beer list was one which would have you drinking water with your meal, but this was a very pleasant surprise. A fine brew and probably the best lager I have tasted.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,NCSUdo,3.9,"Had this one on tap at RDU airport, waiting for a flight to Austin, TX. Had it before but first time I decided to take notes.  A: Small head, little lacing, clear amber in color. Nice looking for a well known domestic produced lager.  S: Sweet malty nose, bitter hop character with a definite citrus undertone.  T: Crisp maltiness. Huge malt up front, bitter hop finish, slight cereal taste.  M/D: Good mouthfeel, carbonation just right. Crisp and semi-dry, fair drinkablity. Light bodied, good beer to have a simple or complex meal. Definite session quality.  This beer is usually hit or miss with me, but it is almost always the best thing available at most resturaunts in the area.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,McStagger,3.58,"Mmm...Sam Adams. Always a good choice, right? Let's review the ole standard; Boston Lager.  A: Pours out a light amber with hints of burnt orange. Creamy off white head. Excellent retention and great lacing of the head.  S: Favor fairly erupts from the glass. Very prevalent hops are the first thing noticed. Further smells reveal hints of slightly sweetened grain.  T: Beer is still fairly hop oriented. However, the hops are muted in the tasting. Slightly sweet, slightly cloying grain and toasted sugar can be detected on the finish, with the hops returning in a roasted fashion after the mouthful of beer has been drunk.  M: Beer has a creamy beginning that turns into a nice carbonation on the mid-palate that is accentuated by the hops. Excellent texture.  D: While I'm not a huge hop-head, this beer has an excellent balance between hops, toastiness and cream. The cream makes it easy on the palate, while the hops give it enough backbone to stick up to a bar filled with cigarette smoke.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,nullforge,3.98,"Clear amber color with a foamy white head that collapses to a thin cover that retains well. The head has some lacing with a respectable stickiness to it. The nose contains gently toasted caramel malt and floral hops. A very sweet and inviting aroma. The taste offers sweet malt with some caramel notes. This is well balanced by a hop bitterness that is both floral and spicy. The body is medium-light. The strong carbonation creates a smooth, slightly silky mouthfeel.  This is a great every day beer.

Mild sweetness tea leafy quality. Not bad.  T: Medium malt flavor with a balanced hoppy note. A light buttery biscuit note and dough round this one out. Not bad, but slightly one sided.  M: Nominal. Slightly crispy and smooth. Minimal creaminess.  D: Fair at best. It's not a bad beer by any means, but to me it reaks of mediocracy, and is rather forgettable.

A fine aroma of biscuity-sweet malt, if a bit faint once the head recedes.  A hearty lightly toasted sweetness with a clean, spicy bittering aftertaste... only the sweetness ticks around just a tick too long. Leaving what is otherwise a fairly light, crisp beer feeling heavier and richer than it really is.  Eminently quaffable, if somewhat forgettable... every time I forget just how delicious and solid this beer is, I take the time to re-examine and see the flaws... still, a stand-out fallback, and worth revisiting from time-to-time for nothing more than a hint of nostalgia (this was one of the first craft brews I was turned on to) and a reminder that even as beer profilerates it needn't be excessively bland and characterless.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S - Floral hops are the first thing that comes to the nose backed up with some sweet fruit notes. T - Biscuity malt comes through with the taste backed up by a smooth flow of the floral hops. M - Possibly the best mouthfeel I've had from a lager. Quite full with a refreshing finish yet not too overcarbonated. D - A nice beer that I wouldn't have any problems drinking lots of. The only problem is that $4.95 a bottle here that limits it somewhat.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Taste is rather complex and seems to change depending on what temperature the beer is being served at. Colder temps (&lt;45'F) gives a sharp refreshing brew. Temps above 50'F bring out the well balanced hops/malt flavors. A terrific beer that is readily available.

Mouthfeel: Very good, perhaps a little more creamy/ less crisp than I would expect from a lager.  Drinkability: I could easily session this beer.

Hops and yeast are in the aroma, maybe some caramel too, but no overpowering or exciting esters hit my nose.

This vienna lager pours amber, a very rare style in American craft brewing, but seems taken for granted of late. The aroma is alone in the beer world as it is an unforgettable recipe of noble hops. The taste is of balance, but when paired with food the caramel flavors work well with seared, grilled or roasted meats, fish and vegetables. The noble hop aroma and dry finish act as an herbal finish, thus complimenting anything from the main course to side dishes. In the New England area Sam Adams lager is found everywhere from sub shops to chinese restaurants and Italian restaurants and is established in many restaurant chains.

By sheer luck, I spotted it in the beer menu of ""The Pump Room"" (bar and bistro at Clarke Quay) and I bought it to go so as to savour it at my own time and pleasure. The Boston lager has a light smell of hops that is fairly aromatic and pours out a nice amber color with minimal head. This beer tastes somewhat like a mix of a lager and an ale (reminds me of Brewerkz's steam beer) with a nice taste from the hops and most importantly a strong and pleasant malty taste. The after taste is also hugely malty and lingering. This beer is also very smooth and drinkable.

I remember it as having a lot more balance, a lot less molasses/caramel malt flavor, and just more interesting hopiness. The aftertaste is also sweetish malt and caramel. It is just too imbalanced and overpowering for my tastes. Blah ... this is a beer I will only drink if it is around and nothing else is available, which is usually at cookouts and the like. It's okay, and I barely recommend it, hence the scores of 3, but it is barely squeeking by, and it might be for nostalgia's sake that I don't sink this one into the thumbs down category.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Now if my choices were Sam Adams Boston Lager or Founder's Red's Rye; well I still wouldn't be choosing Sam Adams.  Appearance of this beer was quite nice. It was very sparkling and clear in appearance, with a fine white head that dissipated in a quite appealing way. Very little aroma. Flavor was a bit malty, but I detected little to no hoppiness. As it warmed up a bit, I got some odd metallicness that I did not care for.  Mouthfeel was a bit flat and watery, and the carbonation made this beer seem harsh and scratchy. Not recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,uwmgdman,3.64,"The flagship brew pours a brilliant golden/light copper color into my pint glass with a thin white head. The aroma is moderately sweet, a low noble hob aroma, a bit musty, and metallic. The flavor is moderately sweet, and some spicy toasted grain emerges. The hop bitterness is medium-low, but provides enough balance. The swallow is smooth with a bit of hop flavor. The carbonation is moderate, body is medium-full, and mouthfeel is smooth. It had been quite sometime since I had this beer. Overall I was pleased with flavor and overall feel of the beer. The aroma left something to be desired.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Redwood21,3.83,"This is a good solid brew. A: Its a good beer, you have to pour with vigor. If you do then you get a good head that sticks around. with a nice amber color S: I didnt get a whole lot out of this but it smells good enough and is nice just the same. nothing that stuck out though. (call me crazy but i smell ocean/beach....not sure why) T: This is an above avg standard lager. I know lager can be a loaded word, there are many variations on lagers. apparently this is a vienna lager, and its a damned solid one. this is one of those beers you drink and say, this is a beer. no particular standout flavor. Though a little more bitter than some other lagers. This is a good beer, a solid beer, and i was ready to bash it, not having consumed it in a long while. once i drank it again i realized sam adams has built up the way it has on the back of this solid beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,argock,3.63,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into tall pilsner glass  A: Orangy-gold color with frothy, off white head that has good retention.  S: Malt and caramel with mild hops and light citrus character.  T: More malty and sweet than I remember with a fine hops finish. This beer is good and has a highly perfected flavor-feel about it. The best mass-marketed beer you'll pay $8 a six-pack for.  M: Light-to-medium body with understated carbonation which is nice in a lager.  D: Very drinkable if not for the price -- there are many other beers where the extra buck per six-pack is well worth it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,prototypic,3.68,"Appearance: It's a clear, golden color. Head is foamy and an off white color. Decent retention and rather light lacing, though it is much better than a macro.  Smell: It's got a primarily malty aroma. There are a bit of hops that are noticeable. A light citrus scent is also there (maybe a tad bit of lemon). It also has a light grainy smell to it. All in all, a little light on the nose.  Taste: Mostly malty. Again, a bit of hops are certainly there. The slight lemon taste is there and it is a bit grainy. Most importantly (for me), the heavily watered down taste that is prevalant in macros is absent. This is just a solid, straight forward beer.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, extremely well carbonated, and a pure joy to session. I really enjoy this beer. Overall, it's a classic. While the numbers may not reflect it, most would agree. It is the beer that prompted many of us to graduate to better beer. This is a staple for me. It is, and always will be, a classic.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,srrn,3.65,Got this on tap at a local resteraunt. Poured the expected clear amber with a quickly diminishing head with some islands of foam. Nice hop bitterness on a malt backbone. I thought I detected a bit of clean spice in the taste. Very short slightly bitter aftertaste. I enjoyed this simple beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Brad007,4.42,"It's been a long time since I had anything from Samuel Adams. I decided to take a gamble and check out the Summer 12 pack. Boston Lager pours a medium copper color with a rich foamy head that lingers in the glass. The smell is very malty with what I perceive as a corn aroma (no, I'm not knocking the beer) that's slightly roasted. The taste is very smooth and refreshing, a tad bit syrupy and with a good malt/hop profile. The aftertaste is somewhat sweet and malty.  I think this beer is decent for what it is and if anything, it gives me incentive to drink more lagers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jtslay,4.45,This is one of the best lagers that I have had. It has a taste complexity that I thought only an ale could have. Cheers to Jim Koch. The beer pours a very light yellow common to lagers. There is moderate head with no lacing. The smell is a very clean and intriguing one. This beer has a very clean and crisp yet complex taste with almost no lasting aftertaste to taint one's palate. Very drinkable.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BretSikkink,3.93,"Light side of an amber color, good sized head with nice lacing.  Dextrin sweet in the nose, good malt presence. Just a little hop bitterness. Unassuming sea-side flavor with a lovely floral hop presence. Sweet caramel malt is the star, good carbonation keeps things all in check. Semi-dry finish and spicy hop aftertaste.  One of the best session beers, almost ubiquitous. Classic fall-back brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Noxious26,3.08,"12oz draft in a pint glass at Outback Steakhouse, Kihei, Maui, Hawaii.  Copper in colour and clear with a thin off-white head.  Mild aroma of hops with a hint of malt in the background.  Lightly hoppy with little malt. Flavour profile is pretty steady throughout. Short lived, mild aftertaste.  Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Better than a macro, but really didn't come out and grab me. I'd drink it again in a similar situation, but won't go out of my way to order one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jar2574,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass, got a nice think head that receded fairly quickly. There's a healthy dose of carbonation. Bubbles coat the side of the glass as I drink it.  I've always enjoyed the smell of this beer. Its a blend of sweetness and hops, but there isn't a real strong scent.  It goes down smoothly, with just the right amount of bitterness. Perfect blend of hoppiness and maltiness. Perhaps a bit of a citrus flavor. And a pleasant aftertaste.  This is a very drinkable beer and a good intro to good beers for your friends that are stuck on the Bud Light vs. Miller Lite debate.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Romulus141,4.08,"Poured into the official Sam Adams Boston Lager serving glass (the new one). I've also had this on tap at the bar many a time.  Appearance: Pours a golden amber with a white, fluffy head. There is decent head retention, and lacing remains on the edges of the glass. Carbonation bubbles float towards the top of the brew. This has a very nice appearance, and is one of the better looking lagers on the market.  Smell: There is a sweet smell, primarily from the malts. There is also a floral character, but that is a little harder to detect. The smell is unobtrusive, but present enough to show that this lager will have a good flavor.  Taste: The smell is a good indicator of the flavor. A sweet, malty taste is the primary characteristic, but there is a nice bite of hops to balance everything out. The finish is crisp, and leaves a slight aftertaste. The flavor is bold for a lager. The brew isn't complex, but it knows that it wants to be memorable and enjoyable. All around a good brew.  Mouthfeel: It's denser than other lagers that are on the market. It's got weight to it. It's got carbonation, but it isn't overdone. If you want less carbonation, getting this on tap is the way to go.  Drinkability: This is highly drinkable, and is one of my stand-bys when I frequent the local bars. It's flavorful, but it doesn't make you feel bloated after having three of them. The APV is just right to make this an ideal session beer.  Recommended. This is a solid beer that you can always count on. Seriously, if you haven't had this yet, get out from under your rock and try it. There's a reason that this is a well-respected beer. I've meet about three people who don't like this. Nearly everyone else does. It's also a great gateway beer for your friends that think Budweiser is all one needs.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeerDreadz,3.92,This is one different beer that you can get in any bar. This beer have a great taste a nice smell and feels very good in the mouth..The color of this beer is darker that any regular macro lager. This beer is great with appetizer especially if they are spicy.You can have one in boston or in any other part f the US and still will be great.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mbutter1997,3.9,"Wonderful beer all around. Refreshing with nice blend of hoppiness, malt flavor, and not too much carbonation. The hops dominate the taste, but the overall blend of flavors make this worth drinking again and again.

35,104,MrMcGibblets,3.3,"a decent beer and ubiquitous enough to be found in even most shit bars and random restaurants. something i will drink lacking other options and better than most available lagers. light amber and crystal clear with a white head. floral, spicy hops and roasty caramel malts in the nose. very light malt sweetness quickly cleaned out by the vegetal hop bitterness and crisp carbonation, finishes quite dry. a sessionable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bluegrassbrew,3.83,12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a deep copper color with a good dirty white head that drops and leave some good lacing.  Smell is caramel malt and just a bit of sourness.  Taste is a good balance of light hops and maltiness. Some caramel notes with a bit of a metalic bite at the end.  Well balanced and very easy to drink. Makes a good session beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,sleazo,3.6,Had a few of these at my nieces bday party figured i would give it a review.  A-Toasty brown with a head replenished by a steady stearm of bubbles.  S-Lightly buttered toasty aeoma.  T-More toast in the taste with afresh hop bite. Very well rounded with the malt and the hops. The balance is good slightly leaning towards the malt.

35,104,brdc,3.7,"Light golden, with a creamy head that shows moderate retention. Smell is lightly sweet, but also has hints of hops, somewhat flowery. This is a reasonably light beer, with a taste that is mild but pleasant, mostly malty and sweetish, but with a good dose of balancing hops. I would not go as far as calling this a classic, but it is a well-crafted beer and a good session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,RonfromJersey,4.68,"Not quite sure how I missed reviewing this for over five years. Its certainly in the house often enough.  Rich amber body, outstanding clarity, topped by a fist worth of off-white rocky froth which peaked above the rim. Wonderful drippy lacing.  Enticing noble aroma of bread/yeast and grass/hay.  Caramely malt semi-sweetness lays down a solid foundation which holds its ground throughout. Earthy noble hops arise and achieve a near perfect balance just before the swallow, and then deliver an assertive snap that tingles through the aftertaste.  Light-medium mouthfeel imparts a sense of quality without impairing drinkability, which is exceptional.  Far superior to any macro, but not off putting to most of their customers. America's gateway to craft beer. Is this ""the best beer in America"". No, but its high quality, easy appeal, and near macro accessibility makes it the most important beer in America.  You might not love it, but you should appreciate it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,beerhawk,3.28,"I must say this is my go to beer when there are only macros on tap. I'll take this over a bud or yuengling any day. It pours nice and clean. The head is white and the carbonation is not nearly as high as other macros. Slightly malty taste which is not what I really want with my lagers. This is why I did not give it a bang up review. However, I have always liked that Sam Adams has noticably more hops than most of the other big guys. If you are new to the microbrewed beers, give this one a try. It won't send you over the top with flavor, but it is much better than Bud any day.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,PittBeerGirl,3.2,"This is a pretty basic Vienna. The taste, however is more present. Has a nice white head on it. Smell has a malt character to it. A decent sweet malt flavor with subtle hop bitterness. Overall pretty boring and dull. I don't purchase this too often because its priced the same as much better brews. This is very drinkable because it is unoffensive, refreshing, and enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,shadow1961,3.23,"Samuel Adam's Boston Lager was quite naughty. I opened the bottle and turned away for a second, only to find a small puddle on my cutting board. Usually when beer is a bit dyspeptic, it gives you fair warning. Oh well- anyway, poured out I got a nice stiff rocky head over a clear amber brew. Carbonation is steady, and the nose is basically malt and a bit of barley. The flavor is basically malt up front with a subdued grassy hop finish. Aftertaste is more of that hop. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth, with just a nip from those hops. It's a pretty easy-drinking brew, and soon all that's left is some chunky lacing. A good, basic brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,irishman06,3.94,"Poured an almost clear golden-brown with a fairly substantial frothy head that subsided quickly but lingered in some form the whole time. Strong, pleasant aroma. Delightfully robust taste with hints of malt, hops, and some fruity notes, almost apple-like. Nice and strong, but balanced. Great session beer, the best macro lager I've had.

35,104,BeerManDan,3.06,This is a pretty average lager. When poured the color was an amber brown with nice white foam. The taste of hops and malts with a hint of spice was evident. Nice thirst quincher on a warm afternoon. A pleasant surprise with this lager from Sam Adams.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,zdk9,3.53,"A very good session beer. Pours an amber brown with a two-finger white fluffy head, and a touch of lacing.

Goes down clean with a slightly bitter aftertaste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,rhythmguitartz88,3.06,This is a pretty ok beer. I'd call it good in a word. The appearance was pretty good. It poured nicely into my glass. The amber/oragne/yellow color was a nice tone.

35,104,liquidnoise,3.9,"I tried this in a bottle at the request of a BA user who said my first experience with Sam Adams Boston Lager (see a few reviews below) was most likely a fluke. The good news is, he was right. I got this in a mix a six and it was a whole different brew. The bad news is, it still seemed bland and boring. Maybe because it is simply a plain ol lager, a higher quality version of the stuff you bought in college. With so many other choices from Sam Adams, including my favorite the Double Bach, I don't ever see myself buying a sixer of this stuff, but I guess that's just my opinion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S: Light malt smell with caramel and honey aromas.  T: Bland grainy taste with a mild hop character.  M: Light and crisp with moderate-high carbonation. Clean finish.  D: I seem to remember this beer having much more flavor. Everytime I drink this, it seems more and more like a BMC brew. Hopefully this is just a result of my palate becoming more sophisticated and not a dropoff in quality from Mr. Koch, but I fear the latter. Decent if there are no better alternatives, but at the establishments that I frequent, there almost always are.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance - gold to copper color. noticeable carbonation. When poured right a considerable head rise to the top.  Smell - crisp, clean smell with a hint of spicyness. definitely a smell distinguishable from most mass-produced domestics.  Taste - Not bad. Clean, smooth taste with a hint of flowery goodness. Certainly not a taste that stands out, unless compared with the average American bottle beer. It's like the commercial says ""you know you're drinking a beer."" Discernable hoppiness from the get go.  Mouthfeel - Light to watery side.  Drinkability - An easy drinking beer, one that stands out amongst meager domestic offerings, but certainly doesn't stand up to the average craft brewer. Will drink again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BradBLR,3.53,"this beer poured a slightly light amber color with a snow white head that lasted most of the beer with a medium amount of lacing. The aroma of this beer was a slightly tart malt smell with a hint of floral hops to give it a nice balance. The aroma overall was not that strong.  The taste was a very sharp malty flavor with a nicely balanced hops on the back end. There were a lot more hops here that you would get in most Vienna style lagers, but it still had a nice flavor. The moughtfeel was good with the beer being a little on the thin side, almost a slight hint of water. The CO2 seemed pretty strong, but overall not too bad.

Light flintiness from the hops, and a hint of yeast extract. Rich flavours & mouthfeel... floral hop flavours support the notes that carry on through from the aroma and onto the palate. An almost iced tea-like aftertaste. If I didn't know any better, I'd call this an English Pale, although the back hop notes support a European influence.

Caramel malts are there too. Bit of hops back there to balance the malts. This is a more delicate sort of style, and Sam Adams does well.  M: Lighter body as per the style, but with a nice carbonation kick to keep it lively.  D: This is kind of the definition of a session beer, so high marks here.  Not the first beer I reach for, as I generally prefer something thicker. That said, it's nice for the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,HochFliegen,3.82,Poured a light brown with a thin white head atop. Smell was very malty with a presence of hops and slightly spicy as well.

Taste - Classic sweet malts with a nice serving of hops for a beer of this style. Nice touch of bitterness at the end.  Mouthfeel - Extremely consistent tetxture with a wonderful aftertaste due to the nice hopiness.  Drinkability - This is just a classic, for East Coaster's this the beer that turns those of us who weren't raised with a great beer education but always looked for something more into Beer Advocates.

D - Okay for everyday drinking needs, nothing more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SkeeterHawk,4.07,"Appearance: The beer pours a clear reddish golden color with a small but lasting head of tight white bubbles. The head fades to a small ring across the top of the beer within a minute or so leaving a small amount of lace on the side of the glass on the way down.  Aroma: There is mostly fresh floral hops in the nose that reek of Hallertauer. To back the hops up, there are some subtle caramel notes as well as some toasty aromas that stay with the beer pretty much the entire time. I get a subtle dryness that I am not sure is from attenuation or from age...but I suspect the latter.  Taste: The flavor follows the aroma pretty closely. There is a very dominant hop bite that gets you quickly in the beginning of the flavor profile, but then fades to let the malt take back over somewhat to lead the finish into a slightly sweet and almost wet balance. This beer is clean and refreshing with a noticeable body and Girth to it that definitely sets it apart from the macro brews. There is no alcohol noticeable in this one pretty much the whole way through.  Opinion: This is a pretty good beer and one that would definitely be a good ""starter beer"" for someone getting into the craft brew scene. I don't buy this beer too regularly when it is available, but I pick it pretty often in airport bars and so forth when this is no doubt the best they have on tap.

Great aroma of fresh cracked sweet cereals..fresh bread and that light herbal aroma of German nobles...this was far better than the other smaple I had previously which were near expire dates.  Medium bodied, slightly malt-forward and with a spicey hoppy finishing character..slick mouth feel.  Up front some chewy bready malts for a second then the nobles flood in to balence with herbal-woody tones...finished clean but wet and toasty with the hops becoming a bit more aggressive...bready-herbal after taste.  A good solid all malt lager with character but not over complicated...well crafted with cold conditioned mellowness....just right for sessions.  Caution: Check the freshness indicator on the bottle...freshness is everything to a malt forward unpasturized lager...my previous samples were bland and stale in the last 1/4 of their advertised shelf life...best before 3 months from botttling if you want fresh tasting beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nice gentle flavor, not as strong as many of the beers I enjoy, but definitely not weak, yellow, fizz water. Great session beer.  Good mouth-feel, not overwhelming.

35,104,auntfloyd,3.23,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a US pint glass.  Pours a clear copper color, with a big, foamy, white two-finger head.  Faint grassy hop smell. Not very strong.  The taste is decent, starting with a faintly sweet caramel malt flavor, but finishing with bitter hops. This is a fairly hoppy lager, though not the typical American hops. The flavor is bitter, but not very subtle.  The mouthfeel is slightly watery, but overall decent. It is also a little too carbonated for my tastes.  Drinkability is good; the abv is fairly low, and the beer is pretty smooth.  Overall, I'm kind of ""meh"" on this one. On one hand, its not bad at all; on the other, there are far better lagers out there. One thing SA has going for it is ubiquity: even places that otherwise only carry macros will have Boston Lager, and for that purpose its great.

35,104,goschool,3.53,"Appearance: The pour is clear copper topped by a long lasting white head.  Smell: The nose has plenty of grains, along with sweet toasted malts, and a touch of grassy hops.  Taste: Semi-sweet, toasted malts are balanced out by dry noble hops, which are more prevalent in the flavor than the aroma, at the finish.  Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied and dry, yet still fairly smooth with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: While this is a very solid brew, Vienna lagers just aren't my cup of tea. Regardless of the scores, I find Sam Adam's Light to be the more enjoyable widely available beer from Boston Beer Company.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jrehmert,4.33,"This beer is a fantastic representation of an american lager without being watered down and tasteless. The taste is balanced between malt caramel and american hops. The appearance is beyond expectation for such a widely available bear - with good head retention, lacing, and consistent effervescence 'til the last drop.   This beer is definitely a session beer and one that I'll call a ""staple"" for years to come!!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,scarletfire79,4,"this is definitly now one of my favorites as far as widely available beer goes. this puts other large breweries to shame. the color is a nice copper like red. slight head retention, good lacing. the nose is appealing. dry grass like aroma. the taste is caramle sweet with a nice balance of hop bitterness. really nicely balanced. for whatever reason i've put this off in the past. finally gave it a try and will give it a try again real soon.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,utahbeerdude,3.76,"Visual: Very clear with a deep gold color. Creamy, fairly persistent head, moderate carbonation.  Aroma: At first, mild grassy hops balanced by very slight sulphury malt. As it warms, the sulphur character of the malt becomes more predominant.  Flavor: A well balance blend of flavors to start. The taste then deconvolves into some malt sweetness and hop flavor, and then a pleasant, dry bitterness in the finish that persists into aftertaste. A very small bit of metallic flavor is sometimes noticeable, but not really objectionable.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation initially brings in some creaminess, which gives way as the flavors exhibit their individuality. The light to medium body seems right for the style.  Overall: A well balanced beer with an almost unique quality whereby the initial flavors are so well balanced that the individual components are suppressed, providing a harmonious gestalt. More than any other lager I have tried, this beer is the most like the homebrewed lagers that I have made. It is no wonder that this beer put the Boston Beer Company on the map.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jeffaz02t,3.35,"A: Light golden, almost orange glow. Nice head that sticks to the glass the entire time.  S: Sweet malts, light hops and a hint of nickel (metal).  T: Sweet malts is the initial taste, which fades to a hops-infused after taste. Nothing in this balanced brew is extreme. The hop bite is very much balanced with the malty sweetness. There is a hint of nickel, penny, whatever kind of metal you want to call it. Over all a very pleasing brew.  D: This is the session beer to end all session beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BigD1972,4.65,"My favorite of all the Samuel Adams beers. Extremely drinkable brew. Smooth, with a light hoppy bite.

There is a nice balance between the noticable hops and caramel malts, the result is that it finishes smooth. Well carbonated and crisp, light but not watery. A very drinkable beer and a good standby to fall back on now and again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kgotcher,4.2,"Pours nice clear orange/amber color with a good head and nice lacings.  Aroma is malty and grainy. Taste is crisp but at the same time it is smooth and easy, caramel maltyness with a balanced hop finish with a chewy aftertaste of malty goodness.  Overall a great beer, easy to drink, nothing crazy and nothing strange, just an awesome session beer that tastes great and at $21 for a Costco 28 pack there is no beer than can compare for the price.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,uabigdaz,2.96,"Overall this beer is pretty good, except one thing. Now that that is out of the way, here I go:  Pours a deep amber, copper color with a nice amount of head which fades to a thin layer, with nice lacing throughout the beer. Smell is good, except for a hint of caramel (which is my problem with this beer) which is unpleasant to me. It smells like JW Dundee beer, and I am not a fan of JW Dundee.  Tastes decent, except for the overwhelming sweet, thick taste of caramel. Once used to this taste it starts getting better, but the initial thought of mine was that this beer would be more like pale ale considering the advertisements bragging about their use of so much hops (hoppy, sad billboards all over Tucson). I know I have had this before, but that was before I ""Respected Beer"", and now this seems lacking in taste to be considered a fine beer in my opinion.  Mouthfeel is actually really really nice. Not watery, but also not too thick, very good balance there. Good job.  Drinkability? I've had 2 out of my 12 pack, and I must say I could drink the rest in one (long) session if I had the time, so yeah, it is drinkable, but I feel with the taste of this beer, it would better serve as a companion with your favorite cut of steak rather than a session beer. I'm going to go fire up the grill.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,lehows,4,"Pours a very nice copper amber color with a classic and fluffy white head. Fine carbonation bubbles rise excitedly to the top of the beer. Nice but mellow aromas of malt and floral hops. Smooth flavors of caramel malt, nice and even display of hops, also a bit of citrus tang that is refreshing. All around an excellent lager and very sessionable. Also a great stand-by as it can be found even at most crappy beer bars.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jeffjfindley,4.26,"What a beauty. Say what you will about this one, but I don't see how anyone could dispute that this is one of the prettiest beers on earth. Transparent, yet rich golden amber, with champagne bubbles rising to the surface to fight for air. The head is rich and downright pillowy. The nose is treated almost as well, with a toasty caramel malt profile and a touch of hop bite. The taste doesn't disappoint, but doesn't quite live up to the aroma. Just a little thin on the finish, and ditto for the mouthfeel. Terrific little hop bite, though. Despite a recent trouncing on the forum, I still think that the character of this is similar to Anchor Steam, and I'm convinced that a similar yeast strain is the culprit. Anyway, that's one for the forum. Great drinkability, and a truly great beer that deserves it's status and prominence.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,pavandal,4.04,"Beer poured from the bottle into my pint glass with no real head. The beer had an apple juice color. Nothing special about the look of this one, at least for me.  The smell matched the color, with the apple-juiceness. I also detected hints of caramel and some pine.  When I sip, the first thing I taste is a caramel malt backbone. The hop profile is just slightly bitter, and the final thing I can sense is a bready aftertaste.  A well rounded beer for sure. The best thing to order when you're at a bar that doesn't cater to the micro drinker!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MrHungryMonkey,4.18,"Amber, clear. Mild head, great carbonation.  Grape, biscuit/bread, butter/toffee, tart edge, cool and crisp, light roasted/toasted vibe, spice essence, refreshing.  Wave of foamy fruit and bread flavors. Moderate carbonation and a nice sour/tartness make me pucker a little. Finishes out to a smooth and creamy butter/toffee edged apple/grape taste leaving me wanting more.  Not bad. Boston Lager is a well tuned and tweaked brew. This is the quintessential craft brew, the proverbial snowball of the beer world, and it does taste good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance: bronze orange color with small 1-finger head which soon fades. Tiny bubble carbonation leads to constant lacing.  Smell: floral hops with mild caramel sweetness with hints of toasted bread crusts.  Taste: very clean and crisp flavors with slight hop bite. Nutty and dry on the tongue at finish.  Mouthfeel: carbonation is about perfect for my liking. Slight dryness adds to the enjoyment.  Drinkability: Very sessionable beer. I've been drinking SA lager for over twenty years and enjoying it.

Good session beer for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,becktone,3.03,"As with all Sam Adams brews, they look great. This one has excellent head retention and formation. A one finger creamy white head forms when poured and will not diminish. I was expecting something a bit darker. The color here is copper, though with more of a yellow tint to it than a red/orange tint. Of the other Vienna Lagers I've had, they've all been darker than this one. Just a tad dissapointed, still looks good though.  Rich malt influenced background. Very strong malt aromas, a bit of a caramel aroma in there, and something that reminds me a bit of toffee, and perhaps a pinch of vanilla(more of an after thought, really... ""I guess that you could associate that aroma with a vanilla character.""). Lightly toasted aromas are present too. Overall complex aroma with some noble hops that first grabbed me when I opened the bottle but no longer are present.  The real test, taste. Ohh that tell tale metallic taste is there. I recently bought a mixed 12, so far 4 of the 6 styles in there have had this metallic tang. It detracts from the taste so much that I can't really describe it. Very unhappy with this.  Mouthfeel is good, creamy and full bodied this is pretty much all you could want in a brew. As to the drinkability, I'd much rather buy Elliot Ness than this, its just so much better. This brew goes down easy enough, and makes a good session beer. I'll probably give it another go-round as this is their flagship beer, I'm beginning to think that it was a bad set of batches or something happened during shipping.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hefevice,4.09,"Liquid rose gold, creamy off white head. Oh, the aroma! You can get lost in the malts; toffee, caramel, cookie dough with the hops adding some spice and potpourri. Subtle but wonderful aroma. Main impression in the taste is balance - the caramel and toffee sweetness is subltly balanced with a smooth but firm hop presence.  Given the distance this beer has travelled, it has held up very well. A wonderfully balanced, extremely drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,billybob,4.13,"pours the color of a bright copper penny and crystal clear with a three finger head that held for a short time with some lacing. roasted malt, slight citrus and toffee aromas. taste about the same. mouthfeel is light, smooth, lots of carbonation and nicely hopped. very nice beer, easy to drink, easy to find, and reasonably priced.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Domingo,3.81,"I've probably had more of this beer than any other, so why not review it? Pours somewhere between a dark golden and light amber color. Reminds me a little of a very light Oktoberfest. Smell is of grain and hops. It's actually got a pretty strong hops smell, although keep in mind that it's a noble hop character and not the typical pacific northwestern big cone IPA variety. Flavor is hoppy (more like a European pale lager) but with a surprisingly good malt backbone. It has the balance of a good APA, but with the distinct lager yeast crispness and kiss of clover honey. Mouthfeel is a strong point because it's thick enough to compliment a hearty meal, but goes down easy enough to be a summer quencher. I personally think the noble hops keep it from being a perfect session beer (after a while they overpower the malt a bit), but the texture and overall package still make up for it.  This is the ultimate go-to beer. You can get it almost anywhere, it's not expensive, it's included in all of their variety packs (which I appreciate), and it's the ultimate example that a craft beer can cover so many bases. In a lot of ways it's one of the world's best just because of the versatility behind it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,gmfessen,3.93,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a copper-orange color with a huge frothy off-white head and a nice stream of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell is an even combination of both sweet malt and grassy, earthy hops. The taste has an initial sweetness of caramel and amber malts but is quickly followed by a bitterness not found in your typical lager. Well balanced and goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and very creamy. This is a tasty, easy to drink lager that is readily available almost anywhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Madmax99,3.45,"An average style beer. I say this because the copper color is starting to become old. I don't like the misconception on how a ""darker"" styled beer always tastes good. This is a mildley hoppy beer that is slightly bitter and slightly sweet. A slightly stale aroma that has some corriander notes. Very well carbonated because it fizzes the entire glass, and has some bite in the mouth when consumed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,FenwaySquid,3.75,"Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle, BBD of April 2007 notched into the side of the label, poured into a pilsner glass.  Appearance: Pours a pale copper color, a few small carbonation bubbles rising within. The head formed a creamy 2 fingers thick and faded slowly.  Aroma: Hoppiness dominates along with some caramel malts in the background, fairly pleasant.  Taste: Caramel malts and some bitter hops start off, and the hops gradually become stronger. The finish is bitter and all hops.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and smooth. The carbonation was a little weak, but oh well.  Overall: This was my first foray into the world of craft beer, and was one of the only options (aside from Guinness) when I lived in the Middle East. The best thing about this beer is that it's mass marketed so most bars and restaurants carry it, leaving me with a decent fall back option when I'm in one of those places.

Aromatic hops, lightly sweet malts and citrus characterize this beer.  Nothing extraordinary, but a balanced, extremely drinkable imbibement. Easy going hops linger in the dry finish.

35,104,Roderick,3.85,This is as always a good solid beer that is easily found almost anywhere in the country. Pours a nice clear amber with a thin white head.

A real thirst quencher and approachable in any situation. M: Style appropriate and quite nice. Not too thin, not too thick just right.

The taste is mildly hoppy, neither wussy like most major US brands nor complex and profound. There is just a hint of bitterness. It slips down the hatch smoothly, inviting another slug.

A crisp hop smell, maybe some malt in there as well. Taste is a nice malty hop balance. The hops are a bit more bitter than the smell indicates. The brew feels crisp and refreshing in my mouth. A solid taste, but nothing overwhelming. I have always found this to be a strong session beer, very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Beer was light amber in color and had live carbonation. The aroma had a pronounced bready and toast quality along with malt and a slightly fruity hop nose. The first sips of this beer produce a bread and toast-like flavor that is blended with some caramel sweetness and rounded out with a noble hop flavor. There is some bitterness to the finish, which is nice. As the beer warms up by mid-bottle, the hop flavors come out even more and have just as much presence as the malt.

35,104,JoeyBeerBelly,4.52,"The first time I had a ""Sammy"" it was on tap at a hotel bar in Pennsylvania where I was staying with my wife and 3 year old son (he's 18 now). We spent the day at Sesame Place and we returned to the hotel for a late dinner. It was late August and the 88 degree, humid day with all it's activity had really taken it's toll on me. It was NFL preseason and there was a Browns vs Eagles game about to begin. I had a ""Philly Cheesesteak"" sandwich and ordered a Sam Adams on tap to wash it down. Let me tell you, that first sip as I was waiting for my food to arrive made me feel as refreshed as the best beer I ever had made me feel. It's 15 years later and I still enjoy every Sammy I have from the tap or in a bottle as much as I did that first time. By the way, on that first night, my cheesesteak was great, my wife and son ate and then she took him up to the room to go to bed. I stayed at the bar to watch the game. I ended up hanging out with a bunch of Eagles fans and had about 8 more pints of this wonderful beer.... oh yeah, the Eagles won 17-10. Is this really a lager?

35,104,beersalesman,5,I'm always partial to Sam Adams Boston Lager...it was the beer that moved me away from watered down mass domestic and into the Better Beer spectrum. The body is always a beautiful clear amber. The awesome boutique of Bavarian Hops greets your sense of smell.

35,104,vickersspitfire,3.53,"This good looking beer came to me in a pilsner and was a deep amber color with a very little head and mild lacing. it really smells like a beer should; it reminded of cedar mixed in with malts and you could pick up a light alcohol scent as well.

Large, frothy tan head that is long lasting and leaves plenty of lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell is mild with malts and fairly stong hops, espcially compared to most macro beers. It is by no means overly complex but remains appetizing nonetheless.  Taste includes some nice sweetness up front with some balancing hops afterwards and some very subtle hints of caramel and citrus. Mouthfeel is excellent with a very crisp character and just the right amount of carbonation. Not overly watery.  Very drinkable IMO and lagers are by no means my favorite style.

S: Stewed strawberries, toasted cereal, cinnamon and doughy caramel.  T: Very malty with almost a poultry buillon aspect to it. Thoughts of pumpkin, tomatoes and yellow corn come to mind. Almost a tortilla chip like breadiness to it which seems odd to me but thats what it is. Finishes with dark clover honey, some cinnamon and more substantial doughy malts.

The finish is more grainy with some slight spicy, piney character. Thin body and slightly thicker mouthfeel is a tad cloying. Nice head retention to the end and little lacing left behind.

You can't go wrong with this one. Very well balanced when it comes to hops/malts so it doesn't offend those who feel a beer is too heavy or too bitter. ABV makes it very sessionable. A staple in my opinion. And I can't help but add a little to the review before me.... there is no adjunct or corn at all. I am wondering what beer was sampled. Miller and Bud products should not be used in the same sentence with this. There is no comparison.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jpkoch1962,2.68,"I use to drink a lot of this lager in the past. Saw it on sale at Krogers and bought a 6 pack. Poured a light copper color with thick head. Aroma was heavy in adjuncts with some floral undertones. Taste matched aroma. A musty taste of cooked corn dominated the front end. Weak floral and spicy hops tried to break through. The finish dried out - there was little aftertaste.  I always remembered this lager to be moderatly hopped with a smooth but firm malt base and clean finish. Also the color I remember being more of a solid amber, not the current light copper. BA has it labled as a Vienna, which it certainly isn't. While not as bad Miller or Bud, this is a disapointment",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bigone4,3.8,This beer has been a great step in convincing many people I know that craft beers are the way to go. Well made and constant. Positively a well known American beer icon. This beer pours a clean orangey brown hue. Light tanish cream colored head that dissipates very slowly. Presentation is very idealistic to what a beer should look like. Strong cling of lace down the whole pint. Smells sweet and floral. Nice mix of the hop aroma and the sweet flavors from the malt. Good nose that makes you want to take a drink. Taste is smooth and enjoyable. Sweet caramel malt tones in the start and then nice bitters from the dry hop finish. Well balanced and full bodied. I have enjoyed this beer for many years especially in bars that do not offer much choice. This beer has proven to be an enjoyable staple. Not a bad session beer either although it can be quite filling. Overall drinkable and well made.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,peabody,3.08,Pours out orange to yellow and clear. Nice white suds and slight lacing. Not much to smell. Slight hops and yeast and mabey a grapefruit overtone. Taste is a little bitter but you can taste a little carmel in with the hops. Mouthfeel is very clean and only leaving a slight resin feel. This could be a session beer but I would hope for a little more flavor.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,theopholis,3.85,"Appearance- Very clear golden/amber color with a thick, foamy, white head. Some lacing, but not a lot.  Aroma- Has a mildly sweet, malty aroma with floral hops. Nice hint of caramel. Well balanced.  Taste- At the forefront, floral hops and malty sweetness that finishes with a hop bitterness. Well-balanced, tho this is a bit more flavorful than I would expect out of a Vienese lager.  Mouthfeel- Medium-bodied and quite smooth. Carbonation level is perfect for style. Lingers in mouth and jowels just a tad.  Drinkability- Very nice. Interesting enough to be interesting, but not complex. Easy drinking.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smells and tastes of sweet barley, toast, orange. Sharp fizz on the tongue. This is probably the ultimate in simple, drinkable beers. Flavors aren't too strong, but it's not watery and weak.

35,104,Estarrio,4.08,"Ah, the old Boston standby! Enjoyed during a family holiday get together.  Poured clear gold into an IPA glass with a large, frothy white head. The head and sticky lacings retained quite well.  The mild aroma includes some malt body and a healthy dose of noble hops.  This brew has a sweet malt flavor up front with hints of caramel and subtle citrus rind. A nice bouquet of noble hops is present mid sip and through the finish. This is a very smooth, balanced and tasty beer. The hop profile is really nice in the fresher bottles. My in laws also had some older bottles where the hop flavor had dissipated and the caramel malt created a unique taste that was still very drinkable.  Medium/light body with a nice amount of carbonation, this beer feels great and is utterly drinkable. This is the readily available, fallback session lager that even the most macro-oriented establishment is sure to have.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mithrascruor,4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a very clear golden/amber color with quite a thick, foamy head. The white head leaves a lacing on the glass all the way down.  Smell: Has a mildly sweet smell with florals and hops. A bit of caramel is also present. The smell seems quite balanced.  Taste: Initial taste is of floral hops and caramel and just slightly sweet. The finish displays a bit more of the hop bitterness. Again, well-balanced.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied and quite smooth, with a soft carbonation feel.  Drinkability: Goes down fine, time after time -- the alcohol isn't very noticable (in taste or strength) and the taste remains nice.  Overall a very solid and enjoyable offering from Sam Adams. Nothing particularly spectacular, but there isn't anything bad about this beer either. On all points, this is certainly light-years ahead of other domestic beers of the same price & availability. Sam Adams manages to get it right time after time. A great choice out at a bar or restaurant, or just to bring home!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,medic25,4.05,"IMHO, this is the prototypical ""gateway"" beer here in the east for making the move from macro to micro. It pours a pretty amber color, with a frothy white head. aroma is quite hoppy, more so than I'd expect for a lager. Taste is a very nice blend of hops and malt, without one overpowering the other. Drinkability is outstanding; there have been many nights when this beer started and ended the night. Although I frequently forget about Sam Adams (instead blinded by the allure of big IPA's and tough to locate Belgians), I always end up coming back to Sam.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Gatch,4.35,"I absolutely love Boston Lager. I can't go a few months without having one. Whenever I feel like drinking a great beer at a fair price, I always go for a BL (sorry, that's what we call them, not to be confused with Bud Light). If I find myself torn about which beer to drink either at a bar or going out to get a 6 or 12, getting BL's is always an easy choice. So much character, balance and body to such an all around great brew. This has been around a while and you know they have perfected it. This beer is what opened the door to drinking & appreciating microbrews.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,maddogruss,4,"Had this tonight with dinner and it was totally different from when I had it on tap. The appearance was the same; a nice amber color with a decent white head that was fairly retained. The smell and taste were completely different. The smell and taste of hops perforated my nostrils and palette which led me to think I was drinking an American Pale Ale and not a lager. Yeah, the on-tap version has hops in it but it seems to be used more as a balancer than in the forefront. The hops were so prevalent in the bottled version it tasted like a completely different beer. The mouthfeel was still very nice and it was still a very drinkable beer. As I've said above like fifty times, the hops took me pleasantly by surprise.  Update: Had another bottle of this recently and it tasted a lot maltier than the first time I had it with more of a caramel, malty smell and taste that was very good. The exact taste of this beer seems to elude my palate!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mikesgroove,3.85,"Well this is overdue. This is my goto beer in restaurants for a while. Always pours that nice amber brown with a decent head. Smells nicely hopped and the taste is there as well. This is one beer that you can drink all night when you can only get to the local gas station on vacation to pick something up. Would take it over any other macro any day. Will always be the go to beer when nothing else is around, well unless I can get Sierra Nevada :)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,joe1510,3.65,12oz. Bottle  Boston Lager poured crystal clear golden/copper into my pint glass. There was a 1 finger white head after the pour that faded quickly to a solid white cap. Minimal carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom. The clarity is good but besides that nothing special.  Sells of toasted grains. There is something strange in the nose that reminds me of hot dogs. Surprisingly it's not terrible. There is a mild herbal hop aroma. Smells crisp.Above averge but the more I smell of the hot dog the more off-putting it gets.  Taste is good. I like this on tap much more but it's good out of the bottle. Starts out with the toasted grains. That is the main flavor throughout. Mid-palate there is a mild floral and herbal hop wave that lead to a mild bitter twang.  Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. A little short of medium bodied. Pushes through fairly quickly. Finishes clean. Quenches thirst but there is still enough there to stand up to a meal.  Boston Lager is pretty easy to put away. The body makes it an easily sessionable beer. The taste is solid and consistent.  Sam Adam's Boston Lager is a good sessionable beer that is easy to find and easy on the wallet. 6-Packs usually go for about $6.50 around here. A good beer to sit back and drink a few.  Slainte!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Kulrak,3.53,"Pours a reddish gold color with chunky head that laces the glass all the way down. Smells slightly hoppy and floral, very faint, but pleasant. Tastes very hoppy, with a faint hint of grapefruit or passionfruit, and finishes kind of sour. Mouthfeel is very somewhat heavy and fizzy, especially at the tip of the tongue and on the back of the tongue. All in all, it's a drinkable beer, very good flavor and lots of it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hckyfn9999,3.98,Pours a light amber color with a nice two fingered white head into a pint glass. Aromas of floral hops and sweet caramely malt.

Hoppier than a lot of other lagers I've had. hops are balanced out by the maltiness.  mouthfeel: nice level of carbonation, very smooth  drinkability: not too bad. I could have at least a couple.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jdmorgan,3.68,"This beer had a copperish color and a medium head that dissipated within time. The smell was of a bit of malt, but more noticeably hop aromas and a bit of fruit too. The taste was good and had a good full body for a lager. I believe that it has more hop flavor than most people are used to in a lager, but that is most definately not a bad thing. The bitterness was medium, and the beer was fairly smooth and easy to drink. Thee carbonation was medium for this beer. Overall, I felt that if you enjoy lagers with a full body and a good solid hop flavor, this is a good beer that you can find on tap at restaurants and some bars. I would reccommend it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,fank2788,3.95,"The classic Sam Adams Boston Lager, I poured this one into my mug. The pour reveals a nice looking light copper colored beer with high clarity, a 1/4 inch off white head fizzes away fairly quickly with very light lacing on the glass. The smell is hoppy, a lot of citrus hops come through with a little light malt. The taste is nicely hoppy too, for a mass produced american lager the hoppy flavor is great, almost reminds me of a good pale ale, the hop flavor settles nicely on the tongue. The taste is also classic lager in that it is smooth, but it has more body than nearly any other lager. Some malt flavor is there but it is low. Good mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation again this is really nice and smooth. This one is highly drinkable a great session beer and a great way to get somebody excited about good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JohnW,3.88,"Pours much darker than you expect from a 'lager' style beer (whether on tap or in bottle) more like a typical British ""Bitter"" beer in colour. Not much of a head, and what there was does not last that long. The aroma hints more at malts and being slightly sweet and full bodied than being crisp and dry in the European lager tradition, and that makes the taste come as a bit of a surprise. The flavour starts out malty and slightly spicy, with hint of sweetness, but then the bitterness of the hops gets you as it goes down. The texture is fairly rich and full, especially if not served too cold. On the first couple of pints of this, I thought maybe the hop bitterness was a shade too much, but having had it more regularly when staying in the US (on tap or from bottle) I now think its a great balance, and enjoy it very much. Very tasty! I think that the texture is a shade richer when served on tap, as in comparison to from the bottle, though that might be more due to serving temperature. I like this beer very much, and think it one of the best beers from one the larger US brewers that is widely available, both here and in the bottle in UK.

35,104,Franchise,4.02,"This offering from Boston Beer pours a pale amber color that leaves a creamy thick tan head that leaves as fast as it came. The aroma is barley, bready, acidic citrus hops, a straight forward lager that is crisp and flavorful. The taste starts a bit citrusy, bready, and a bitter snap that is held in check by a smooth malty backbone. This is one of the great gateway beers of all time I love to come back to this delight every once in awhile and reminisce about one of my first beer loves.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It smells like floral and citrus hops, and sweet malt. It tastes the same way to me, but with a caramel malt sweetness along with the hoppiness. There's also a hoppy bitter finish. The mouthfeel is light/medium, with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it has a nice clean finish. It's a good solid beer, one that's available pretty much everywhere.

A slightly hoppy smell rises from the glass.  A slightly bitter hops taste, crisp with a lasting aftertaste. It goes down smooth and beckons you back for more.

Happily this is available in panama at a couple of locations.  pours with small 1/2"" head into a pint glass. active carbonation in the beer.  mildly malty nose dominated by citrus or floral hops with some in particular which remind me of dreadnaught. lupulophiles would know which perhaps. In any event, somewhat harsh but inviting.  taste remains malty, even more than nose. hops are blended in here, not standing out but the overall taste is moderately bitter as a result. this is a very decent combination.  I probably have not had more than one or two other vienna lager's knowingly to compare this to in my life, but it is a very pleasant taste, with enough bitterness to keep the palate interested rather than shutting it down.

Pours a nice transparent orange amber with a thick head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice foamy lacing throughout the entire time you're drinking it. It smells like a lager, with a slight hint of hops and malt. You can taste the hops much more than you can smell them though, and it's a step above most other lagers.

The nose is more assertive than I expected--pleasantly sweet, with grains somewhat muted, leaving room for a bit of hops. Taste is pretty average on the front side, with ho-hum grains leading the way. But the hoppy dryness in the finish is a pleasant surprise.

Appearance- white head, 1/4 inch thick. copper/orange in color. a refreshing site especially when paired with spicy foods.  Smell- smells very mildly of hops especially when compared to more extreme beers.  Taste- bitter hops. tastes like someone poured a can of bud into a harpoon ipa.

(As an aside, Georgetown seems to be Sam Adam's country - I noticed at least three bars that had it as it's ""featured"" beer.)  Loved this brew! What a nice surprise. Maybe it's my native Bostonian bias, but I think the is an excellent beer. Smell was warm and inviting. Taste was sweet and smooth. Detected a slight caramel flavor, and lots of fresh hops coming through. Nice clean taste with full carbonation throughout. Great color too.. reddish brown, with a perfect cream head.  I'm not sure why I waited so long to try this beer. I guess since it's usually featured with traditional BCM, I figured it tasted similar. It's like a cross between a great marco (if there is such a thing) and an organic Pale Ale. Now I feel as though I have a tasty, solid option when I can't enjoy find any micro's available on a night out with friends.

However, recently I was fortunate to be in a situation where I needed to buy beer for a gathering & the only place open had this as the only palatable choice. Ubiquity is often a sign of marketing prowess but in rare cases (Sam Adams & Sierra Nevada) it is a testament to actual appeal & quality. Now, the review;  Pours a rich amber hue crowned by a finger of thick head. The head recedes into uniform lacing that holds up nicely for the drinks duration. This is a good looking brew.  There isnt much to comment on in the nose as it is very subdued. Weak hop-scent with faint traces of spice & greenery (clover?).  The taste sports an excellent balance of well-rounded, subtle malt sweetness with the perfect level of hop assertiveness on the finish. There is little remarkable about this beer other than perfect execution of the style.  The mouthfeel is excellent combining the right body with good carbonation which, when factored in with the solid taste, makes for the quintessential session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Don't be fooled by how widley available or intensely advertised this beer is; it has little in common with other beers you'll find in commercials. The body is a very well balanced mixture of the noble hops and a caramel malt flavor. It goes down exceedingly smooth and has a pleasant aftertaste.

35,104,CardinalBrewing,3.81,"This is one of the most balanced beers available. The flavor of the noble hops is distinct, but not overpowering. The bitterness of the hops is just enough to counter the sweetness of the caramel malt. The flavor is close to a mild IPA, but lacking the same degree of bitterness. The beer is incredibly smooth, but slightly heavy. It is not quite as drinkable as a typical lager, but is about average for an amber ale. Bottom line: you cannot go wrong with this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,techdiver,3.83,"Pours a clear medium amber with a two-finger head that dissipates at a modest rate leaving at least a foamy coating on top. Balanced smell and taste with subtle hops following a smooth caramel malt presence. A drinkable brew, much better than their Scotch Ale.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,pumarocks,3.85,"Wow, what can you say about this great beer? It goes down smooth, has a nice creamy head, has a wonderful amber color, and has a great aroma. The aftertaste is something I really enjoy too. It has a great balance of hops and is super malty. A great beer that is brewed and bottled right here in Cincinnati.  This beer was on-tap at the Pearl St. Pub in Oldenburg, IN. If you are in the area it is worth checking out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,beerN3RD,4.63,First thing i noticed when pouring this beer was the thick forthy head and great lacing this beer had. Also a nice color with the medium amber. Had a nice hoppy scent. Flowery hops rich in flavor with a little bite. Nice even carbonation. Fresh and easy to swallow. Very drinkable and after taste leaves you wanting more.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Damian,3.75,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle  Poured a clear amber with a tight, effervescent, two-finger head that quickly faded to thick ring of lace. Intense, sparkling, sticking lacing coated the glass.  Smell was faintly hoppy at first, but the aroma improved dramatically as the beer warmed. Rich, caramel sweet and somewhat nutty Vienna malts gave this beer a distinctly German aroma.  Taste was malty sweet up front before the crisp, biting hops kicked in. Finish was quite hoppy, dry and lingering with a bit of residual sweetness.  Medium to light bodied with a slight creaminess in the mouthfeel. The beer was a bit overcarbonated at first, but it later settled down nicely.  Easy drinking and perfect with a variety of foods.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Kendo,3.68,"Poured into a pint glass. Light amber with golden straw hues and a soapy, 1.5-finger ivory head that remained in the form of a thin head on the surface even after it settled. Some lacing remained behind as well. Lots of bubbles throughout.  Smelled of sweet malt but was slightly grainy as well. Moderate hint of hops, but barely -- malt predominates the nose.  Taste was mild all around -- sweet caramel malts up front and a drier hop bitterness finishes it off, balancing it nicely.  As for mouthfeel, I thought it was slightly over-carbonated, with a light-to-medium body and found it somewhat creamy.  Good drinkability as a fairly light lager; you can definitely have more than a few of these. . . .  Note: this was the beer that started it all for me -- moving me away from BMC into the whole craft beer scene back in the early 90s. I rarely purchase it any more (this bottle was left over from a friend's 40th birthday party), having found plenty of beers that I like better. But as a colorful lager with more taste, body and character than those fizzy yellow beers most people start out with, it's a nice transition beer into a broader world.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,treehugger02010,3.26,"A rather tastey lager. I poured from a 12 oz bottle to a glass and got a little head, with low retention, and even less lace.

35,104,AustinBeerLvr,5,"Recently had this on tap at the Washington D.C. airport on a layover to fly to Germany. While I had many awesome beers in Munich, having Samuel Adams Boston Lager is honstly one of my top tasting beer experiences of the vacation.  Unfortunately, you can't find Sam Adams on tap hardly anywhere here in Texas, so having it on tap on the east coast was a real treat.  Anyway, the beer was served in a nice room temperature pint glass. It poured a beautiful copper golden color. Upon the first sniff, my first thought was this batch is as fresh as it comes. The beer had a wonderful mix of grassy hops and slightly sweet malt with floral hops. Upon the first sip, I tasted all of these things coming together with a great amount of balance. One of my favorite things about this brew is that it has a slight sweet maltness that quickly transitions to a nice complex floral, grass hop flavor. I can't imagine a beer being more balanced. This is also an excellent brew because it is very complex, but at the same time highly drinkable for almost any occassion.  Macro, micro, who cares? The BBC brews exceptionally good beer. And for all of you that say an exceptional brew must be hard to find, you need to really give Sam Adams a try and think about why some ""micro breweries"" might not have their beers as widely available. While in Germany, I tasted great beers, but most of them were honestly right up there but not quite as good as Sam Adams. As for the tiny breweries, I have tasted some brews this good, but they were few and far between. This is the first beer I have ever given a 5 rating on taste. While I love Sam Adams out of the bottle, having this on tap is simply the best. I only wish more places here in central Texas would realize this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,InsolublePancake,3.7,"Finally getting a chance to review this classic. I drink it pretty often but have never bothered to pen a review... until now.  A- Deep amber color with a reddish tinge. Nice head and decent lacing.  S- Sweet caramel malt, a familiar smell that is present in most Sam Adams beers. Nice citrusy hop aroma complements it.  T- Tastes a lot like it smells. A toasty flavor is rather evident as well. Hops provide a pleasant bitterness at the end.  M- A little on the light side, but still good. Not too thin.  D- Pretty darn good. Great session beer.  An old favorite and a standard order at restaurants that don't have a wide selection. It's also a beer that some of my macro-drinking friends will tolerate (probably because of brand recognition, because it really isn't a dumbed-down beer).

Taste & Mouthfeel: Good taste, I'm not sure exactly what a typical Vienna Lager would taste like but as far as lagers are concerned I like this one a lot.

Also a touch of bite/spice in the end that I've always associated with SABL  M: Solid without being heavy  D: Great  This is a classic American beer and I am glad that so many restaurants and chains carry this along with the BMC crap.

35,104,JudgeRoughneck,3.57,"This is a light, hazy, orange-tinged beer with absolutely no head as it was served. Smells are very faint but lightly malty. Taste is prettymuch classic vienna lager I guess. It has a sweet and toasty malt base with a bitterness that only really shows itself toward the finish. Alcohol is barely apparent. Mouthfeel is probably just a little thicker and slicker than it ought to be. Something about this beer keeps me from wanting to drink alot of it. It feels a tad heavy I guess. It also reminds me exactly of a beer I homebrewed once which was kinda freakin me out. What can I say? This is a good beer with no real issues, but I guess I prefer Negra.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Didn't pour it in a glass b/c the waitress didn't have a clean one (a bit weird), but I gave it a better than average rating. Aroma was a good balance between sweet and bitter, but the malt came through. Some rye smell as well. Taste was, to me, like a sharp lager. It was sweet but with enough hops to give it a crisp taste. Some rye, some soft citrus and flower. Finishes nicely, clean and crisp. This would be a staple for me in the ""I just want a good, cheap six pack lager"" category.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Refreshing.  D: There was a time that I only drank BMC products. Then, I had my first taste of Sam Adams. I remember thinking, ""this is what real beer tastes like."" Ten years and many world class beers later I still find myself saying the same thing whenever I drink a Boston Lager. It's my fallback beer at many restaurants. It pairs well with most foods.

It poured a transparent, light amber hue with a foamy, two-finger head atop. The head had great retention and a creamy ring remained for most of the time it took me to drink this beer.  The smell was subtle, grassy hops complemented by a slight whiff of sweet caramel. The malty sweetness dominates before giving way to a crisp, dry hop finish. Lively carbonation and medium-bodied.

35,104,assmasterson,4.6,"First off, the Budweiser label may be the most recognized, but the Samuel Adams labels are quickly becoming my favorite. The blue and silver shows a sign of high quality, and the top label explaining the style is a nice touch.  Even without a glass, this beer showed a great appearance with the foamy head traveling almost to the top of the bottle neck. The smell was slight, but had a brilliant hop note. The taste...WOW. The commercials don't lie. The heavy hops flavor kicks you in the mouth and leaves you begging for more. I wanted to savor it, but I could not stop drinking. Simply excellent.  The mouthfeel of this beer is moderately heavy, but so slick you don't even notice it going down. Drinkability is extremely high. It may be almost 11 pm on a tuesday night, but I want another!  If beer was music, S.A. Boston Lager would be Beethoven's 5th: powerful and flawlessly excecuted. I cannot stop praising this brew. It could perhaps be the finest lager available.

Pours caramel orange with a two finger white orange head that is the color of the inside white surface of an orange peel. The head drops, but stays around 1/4 finger for the duration.  Smells very unique, like dirty sand from the bank of a river, chlorine, a little hoppy lime zest, and fresh crusty bread.  Tastes bready with some caramel and lime citrus notes. Light and playfull on the palate, but also pretty deep in character. It's pretty hoppy for a lager....almost like a pale ale in it's hop profile. Lot's of lime and lemon rind come out more strongly as it warms, and leave a tangy bitter aftertaste that's very enjoyable.  This one pairs excellently with food due to it's palate-cleansing zest and sweet bready character. Good thing you can get it in just about every restaurant (at this rate, I think it'll be available at McDonald's soon...I'm lovin' it).  Sam Adam's lager is ubiquitous, and because you can find any where you go I've had it about a ga-zillion times and I'm a little tired of it.

D - tasty beer, and the drinkability gets a small boost because it's always a safe standby. Don't recognize any of the other taps?

35,104,carolinabeerguy,4.1,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about Sam Adams Boston Lager? This is by far the finest macro brew in America. Hands down. Appearance: Excellent look, not too dark nor too light. Nice head with decent lacing.  Smell has a nice hoppy aroma.  Taste is very smooth with just the right amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Nice balance.  Drinkability is quite high for me.  I just realized that I hadn't reviewed this one yet. Probably my favorite American beer at the moment. Ask me tomorrow and it might change. I just drank four and wish I had more. Highly recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TheBungyo,4.25,"Let me first state that I am no expert in terms of this style. I do enjoy the dark golden pour followed by a robust head. Nose is full of toasted malt goodness and hoppy aroma. There's lots of lacing too. Taste is full of pleasing caramel, tangy hops, and a bit of sweetness. It's too bad you can't find this in a plentiful amount in Seattle or I think I'd buy it often. Light carbonation tantalizes and pleases. Great drinkability in my opinion. A satisfying beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,rarevos,3.95,"Poured into pilsener glass.  A: Pours an amber color. Almost two fingers of head that lingered. Left sticky trails on the side of the glass. Head had great longevity.  S: Smelled of hearty, whole-grain bread. Or hearty crackers. Malty, slight hint of hop bitterness.  T: Very clean flavor, maybe not as whole-grain-like as the aroma would suggest. Hop presence at the end, and the finish is typically abrupt for a light-bodied lager. Pleasant hop presence. Blooms nicely, and the malt gets more and more assertive the warmer it gets.  M: Light-bodied, not overwhelmingly carbonated.  D: Very easy to drink these. Good session beer that has a presence in many places with otherwise uninspired beer lists.  Subjective notes: This is pretty versatile. It's nice and refreshing when served very cold (such as when you're given one at a party and it's been in a cooler), or when it's served slightly chilled, and it has more pronounced breadiness when you let it warm to not-quite room temperature. Is FAR better when it's served around 45 or so degrees F. I know there's a bit of hubbub about the micro/macro distinction, but I don't particularly care. I'm thrilled whenever I find myself in a McBar that has heavy BMC representation, and find this on tap.

Kinda disapointed with the SA Boston Lager. I often have this on tap, but from the bottle, it seemed to loose much. The maltiness never came through with the bready, toasty, rich character in flavor or texture. The taste was all spice, and the feel was almost prickly to the toung. Aromas were nice (after the beer warmed to above freezing), of American hop character--very Sierra Nevada Pale Ale-like. Finished with a (dare I say) grain-hull bite-ey-ness. Basically under-bodied, under-malted in comparison to what I'm used to in this beer. May have been past its prime.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Smell: Earthy hop aroma, with a little bit of toasted malt.  Taste: Nice to see how big a role the hops have in this one. The flavors are very earthy - I think you could almost say there's a little bit of saltiness. Toasted (maybe a touch burnt?) grain backs up the hops. Finishes on very dry, which I find appealing.  Mouthfeel: fairly light, good level of carbonation. ""creamy"" is going too far, but it's slightly in that direction.  Drinkability: Very nice Vienna Lager: dry finish definitely helps drinkability, it's flavorful enough that you want to keep drinking, while light enough that you can.

35,104,semihobo,3.65,"Purchase before April on side of bottle ... bought this before April and it sat in the fridge for a while. Another review of beer acquired via the five-finger discount.  Crystal clear red color, good pooling of lace that retains well, head is rough but appropriate for a lager.  Well balanced smell of both crisp precise hops and bready amber malts. Smells tasty.  Very bready, dextrinous taste. Grainy aftertaste of corn and barley, I like this but it is a little clumsy and many may not (and it reminds me of Miller High Life's finish, for better or for worse). Grains are mitigated by the surprisingly strong hop presence... low alphas that do their job. Not complex, really, but it's a fine lager. Not quite as smooth as it warms...  Mouthfeel is nice, very feisty bubbles but not overwhelming. Dextrins really make this a full-bodied beer that you can almost chew on.  Nothing bad and the simplicity of the beer makes it very drinkable. Combine that with the fact that it's so frequently far-and-away the best beer available at bars and restaurants, and I thank the powers that be for Sam Adams Boston Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The head/lacing stays about 5mm over the beer.  A slightly nutty sweet smell is a little sweet and compiments the lager smell.  It has a distinct hoppiness to it with a slight nuttiness covering up most of the lager smell.  Mouthfeel is well carbonated and crisp, has a little bit of bite to it.

The aroma is malty with a slight hint of hops. Upon tasting, the malt comes through, but the hops are definitely present and very well balanced. Hops are noticeable on the finish also. The body is medium with moderate carbonation.  This is a really good lager.

Its smell is mostly roasted malts with a bit of citrus hops. There is also a nice sweetness to finish. A good, clean, crisp aroma. Taste is again dominated by malt and hops. Not terribly bitter or complex, but a pleasing swallow nonetheless. In the mouth, this beer isn't very full-bodied. But it does have a decent, crisp and sharp pull on the tongue. On the whole, this is a pretty classic American Beer. It has been much maligned and much respected by many B.A's all at once.

Definitely a grassy aroma, not unpleasant. Very faint. The color is a nice dark amber. Not opaque, and not quite like a cola. Soft but thin head with a nice lacing that stayed around a while. Good when very cold even though that hides most of the flavor, and good when just a touch colder than room temp. Kind of odd in beteen, though. Kind of a sickly-sweet flavor when coolish.

Some sweet smell of caramel malt, and nice floral hops aroma at the end. Lots of flavor, including sweet caramel malt and a nice spicy bitter finish. So good, I had to order another one.

35,104,neenerzig,4.08,"I believe this is the best mass produced lager from an American brewery that I have ever had. It certainly is much better than macrobrew lagers such as budweiser, michelob, keystone, etc. I don't think that anyone can argue that by now Sam Adams isn't a macrobrew company too. Poured into a tumbler. Color is a nice, deep medium amber gold with a very slight of orange tint as well. Mine had a nice and tall white head about an inch thick that lasted for about 5 minutes when I poured it before starting to disappear. It eventually settled to about 1/4 of an inch. Very nice lacing too. The smell is nothing special, some hops, malts and maybe vegetables. The taste upfront is malty, a bit sweet, followed by some moderate hop notes.

But, I used to enjoy this beer more in the past than I do now. It is good, but nothing special, and it tends to be too sweet to make it very drinkable. It is more like a fall-back beer - an enjoyable beer when the only other alternatives are the BMC's or other mediocre macros. It pours a golden amber with a decent head. It smells of a balance of hops and malt. Apple and some citrusy fruit aromas are prevalent. The taste is of sweet hops. It is quite thick for its style. It would be more drinkable, but for its overpowering sweetness. Certainly a better beer than most macros, but better examples of the style are out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Liquids,4.07,"Golden pale orange, with a full creamy head and tasteful carbonation. Smells of caramel malt and intense hops--spicy. Tastes a bit honeyed, spicy. Full flavor of pale and sweet malts that arent toasty but are very distinct to any other beer on the market, again with a caramelly, honey kind of flavor minus the intense sweetness of the two. Then a full resiny, spicy hop finish. It is almost nauseatingly clean in the yeast flavors department. I've always wanted Sam to release a true SA ""Boston Ale"", one with the same recipe and just change the yeast, to see what it could be like. That's the only way I can even imagine this getting any better.  It's so tasty, this is what all other macro (regional/micro) lagers should be judged by, and are, at least for me. Mouthfeel is high out of the bottle. I prefer, like Jim, to pour it high into the bottom of the glass to de-carbonate it and make it more akin to on draft, but the mouthfeel is full--even heavy--for a lager of this caliber. The aroma and taste are rather hoppy, but the malt is certainly there, and a make a contributing factor to the complexity of flavors. Drinkable, but notably hoppy. So unless you drink this ice cold (I don't) or pour hard the hops make two feel like a lot more than your average lager. That's okay, we don't want to drink it like it's bud.  Most of my tamer, malty session-beer or wine loving friends typically draw the line at this beer and say ""good but just a little too hoppy"" unless I pour it hard. Without knowing why, then they say ""yeah, it's good"" because they taste less burn, more malt, less hops. When I'm drinking an (not double) IPA with wings, they're more like to request this one as their ""hoppy"" beer with spicy food. So it's an intense beer for the session minded (straight out of the bottle), but just right for someone like myself who while not a hop head, is more adjusted and appreciates medium-hoppy beers.  Last but not least, this beer has freshness issues. Not that opening a bottle will be a risky proposition; it's never skunked, but the flavors definitely deteriorate at room temperature by the sell by date. Same buys it back for a reason. After a while it tastes a bit like sour honey without the sweetness, when the hops fade into the background. It's low in alcohol, so treat it right, drink it regularly and buy it often, if you know what I mean, or else by the end of the 12/24 pack, you'll go ""I don't like this beer anymore"" due to freshness. It's happened to me.  Overall this is a beer that macro party folk who don't even know the treasure they hold in their hands could potentially enjoy, while drinkers that know what good beer is can also truly appreciate despite the mass availability. What I always wonder is, how did a beer with this much hops get so popular? I'm glad it did, but it amazes me.

It sounds crazy, but what can I say?  Very drinkable beer. Low carbonation makes for easy drinking, but there's enough bubbles to make it refreshing.  Sam was my first craft brew: spring of 1988. It wasn't what I expected then, but I had been drinking Goebel and Rolling Rock up to that point. Since then, SABL has been a favortie.

T: Okay it is much better than I originally said. It has great toasted malts. It has caramel smoothness and it is spicy enough. It also finishes with a kiss of floral hops that just when you think they are going to get to bitter, they end perfectly.

O: A perfect change of pace when you are used to the Stouts and IPAs of the world. Vienna malt is evident and noble hops make this an impressive Premium American Lager.

35,104,mcallister,4.1,"Sammy has always been a very good, solid brew if your going to a place where the selection is less than mediocre. It can always get the job done. The best thing about the Boston Lager in my opinion is it has character, it's own identity. You can smell or taste this beer and if you've had it in the past there is a damn good chance you're gonna be able to tell what it is your trying.  Pours a great looking copper dark golden hue with a thick frothy hea with great lacing and retention.  Very good nose on this brew. Some what sweet with thick malt notes and hops. Some dried fruit also.  Distinctive taste. Clean, slightly sweet, great malt character and abundance. Hoppy with a dry yet buttery mouthfeel. Very clean quick to delude mouthfeel.  Could drink this beer all night long. Just an all around great original american micro.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TheSarge,4.22,"Ah, one of the beers that helped father the American craft brew revolution.  Sam Adams Boston Lager pours superbly from its 12 oz bottle. Boston Lager is a somewhat crisp and clear beer, with a golden amber color. The head retains for a little bit; a bit longer that other lagers normally do. After taking several sips, a nice lace is left behind  This smells sweet and sour at the same time. The hops blended with the darkly toasted malt, is an uncommon blend for an American mainstream lager.  Boston Lager tastes very clean, and crisp. The hops are visibly noticed here. This is a very quenching beer.  This is richly carbonated, as are most beers within this family of yeast. There's no bitter aftertaste, just a hint of the esters is all that's left behind.  I could easily consume this, and go for another. It's nice to take a break from my favorite heavily hopped IPA and pale ales.  Cheers to the great Jim Koch on helping to encourage America's return to our beer roots.  TheSarge",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Phyl21ca,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color beer with an above average size foamy white had with good retention. Aroma is hoppier then expected with a good clean sweet malt presence. Taste is quite sweet with a nice mix between sweet malt and a clean crisp slightly bitter finish. With more character then expected, this is a quite good session lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,sammy44,4.07,"I can't believe that I am just now reviewing this.  This is a new American classic, it can be found everywhere, even here in Bama where BMC is king and antiquated beer laws have the availability of craft beers crippled. Imagine if BMC had been making lagers like this since prohibition.  Anyway, the beer poured a beautiful clear coppery color that had a large bubbled 0.5 inch head. The head faded to a lace on the top of the beer that hung around to the end and tried to lace the glass (I was in a hotel room so proper glassware was not available unless a 8 oz tea glass is the new standard.) An aroma of toasty malts and floral hops. Mainly tasted of hop oils with a minimum of sweetness. The taste was more pale ale than lager. A little heavy on the carbonation and left the mouth a little drier than usual. Overall a very drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TurdFurgison,3.85,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Clear golden color, white frothy head which lasted through the entire beer.  Smelled and tasted pretty balanced, more on the hops side than malt. A little dry after-taste, with some hops flavor lingering.  I guess this is a session beer at heart. It competes with Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold in my refrigerator. I remember the Boston Ale as being more flavorful, but it's been a while.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,shamus,3.98,"To really get a sense of a beers colour you should hold it up to full spectrum light, like sunlight. This beer is a lovely copper, not exceptional but neither too pale nor too dark. An archetypal beer colour. It also pours with a nice head that hangs in there leaving very nice lacing along the glass.  I've always enjoyed this beer but never actually stopped to smell it carefully. Again it's an archetypal experience. You can smell the yeast, the malt and the hops more or less in equal amounts, although since most macro beers play these down it may be a strong experience for some.  The proof is in the drinking and I really like the taste. Served chilled you can really taste all the ingredients but also get a refreshing smooth mouthfeel.  This is one of my favourites for session drinking. They've really done a great job creating a palatable microbrew that doesn't try to be a macro.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

T- well it wasnt bad. hops up front but a sweet coolness in the back that made the bitterness feel better.  M- medium thickness, decently carbonated, and moderately smooth. nothing major.

35,104,Beerboybill,3.79,"I've been drinking this beer for years, but this review is written for the glass I had during the Sam Adams brewery tour in Boston. The appearance is a beautiful, clear darker amber color with good carbonation. The nose is mild (I would like to be able to smell more of the hops). Taste is very smooth, somewhat malty with very mild hops bitterness. The finish is also mild and lasts about 10 to 15 seconds.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jasonjlewis,4.85,I tried this beer as a recommendation from my boss. It was quite a treat. Color was somewhat dark and very full. Nice aroma as well. Taste lies in the middle of dark and light. It's a great beer that I highly recommend. It is one of the best beers I've ever had. There was obviously a lot of dedication and passion that went into this beer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Drew966,4.1,Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a dark golden color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The smell is reminiscent of citrusy hops.

35,104,DouggiePhresh,3.1,"Samuel Adams. Reddish-brown appearance, smells like toned down IPA, nice malt profile. Tastes like a toned down IPA, malty. Nicely carbonated, crisp. Great session brew.

But then again I was only about 16.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,CortexBomb,3.5,"Samuel Adams...well, it's not my favourite style of beer, and it's not as flavourful as some of the other offerings out there...but it's also quite easy to run into and given the other options available at many bars...well, you could do much worse.  Pours golden, a decent white head on top. Fades quickly. The smell is slightly floral...dulled IPA. Still, it has an aroma.  The flavour...crisp, refreshing...some hops but not a lot. A slightly spicy aspect. Malts. Nothing that will rock your world, but a good, basic beer with a bit of zing.  Mouth...eh, not bad, but not spectacular either. Doesn't sit in your mouth like water, but it doesn't leave you in oily heaven either. Drinkability, also a slight notch above average...not a problem putting down a beer this light down, and Sam doesn't stand out much in those terms.  Basically, this is what I'll have if the other options are Bud and MGD. It's never going to blow me away, but it's a solid, decently flavourful option that is easy to find. You could do much, much worse.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,TheManiacalOne,4.06,"Ive had this beer on-tap at several places and have finally decided to officially write a review on it.  A: Pours to a deep gold with a thick, foamy white head, which fades slowly and leaves a thick lace.  S: The aroma is hoppy but not overpowering with little bit malt and alcohol.  T: The taste has the robust hops intensity of an IPA but a very different flavor, a little more floral and a just little bit breadier than that style. Leaves a nice bitter hop after-taste too.  M: Very crisp and smooth, medium body and medium-to-high carbonation.  D: Flavorful and not-to-filling, goes down easy and is the type of beer you want to just keep throwing down.  Around here, most places have this beer as the only alternative to macros (if they have one at all) and it definitely seems to be to me the perfect transition from macro to micro, which is what has made Boston Beer Co. what it is today.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Tupperwolf,3.52,"I'm always incredibly impressed with the appearance of this beer when poured into a properly clean glass. I mean, really impressed. That doesn't happen very often with any lager. This pours a perfectly toned amber chock full of small, energetic bubbles and a thick, tall, fat, chunky,mountainous, incredible head. I mean, a lot of beers claim good retention - this one wrote the book on head retention. Every single time I drink it, bottle after bottle, the head is the last thing that I tip into my mouth because there's always at least a half inch left when I get to the bottom. And the lacing? Don't get me started. It looks like styrofoam plastered to the glass in rings of incredible thickness - up to 1/4"" thick, hanging like white pumice.  Big ol' caramel malts, soft beery alcohol, and grassy hops - it's basic, but so complex in smell. A beer lover's session beer.  Caramel, grassy hops. Boom-boom. Again, so much more complex than I can describe; It's thick, rich, but incredibly easy to drink and satisfying.  Round, cool, a little grainy, but just the right consistency. It's full, but easy to drink, never filling; Just a little bitter on the back end, enough to make you crave the next sip.  It's all about the gulp! It seems like whenever I buy a six-pack of this it's all gone within 2-3 hours. Low enough alcohol to session, way enough flavor to session. Perfect.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ericj551,4.01,"I think this beer is underappreciated but its really grown on me. In my pre BA days (or wanna be BA days) I thought it was too bitter, but now I recognize how balanced and delicious. It pours a golden copper with a nice healthy head and lacing. The aroma is slightly toasted bready malt with spicyhops in the background. The taste is a great balance between the bitter hops and slightly fruity maltiness backing it up. This is a great go to beer when the only other options are BMC.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mattcrill,3.88,"Believe it or not, in two years of beer advocacy I have yet to sample the bottled version of this. Time to make amends for that. This was part of the winter sampler pack.  Label indicates that for brewery fresh taste I should enjoy by March (sample 12Mar06).  Aroma: Nice biscuity aroma, wheat crackers, a little bit of yeastiness in the background. Very inviting.  Appearance: Honey golden color fading to amber in the middle, crystal clear, with a tight off white head that retains throughout the session.  Flavor: Strong bready and biscuit notes dominate the palate with just a bit of carmel sweetness before the dry finish. As the beer warms I do pick up a slight noble hop bitterness which is very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with strong carbonation presence. A clean and cool finish on the palate.  Overall impression: An American classic. Hard to find any flaws with this one. Not my favorite style but very approachable. A good place for people to start.

35,104,JWFokker,3.93,"Poured from a bottle into a stein, it's a good looking beer. It's a crystal clear, coppery brew with a nice eggshell white head. Lacing could be better, but it's a very good looking lager anyway. The smell is nice, a mild malt and hop aroma. It could have a bit stronger nose, but it's pleasant nonetheless. The flavor is quite good. It's an excellent balance of hops and lightly roasted malt. It's a close call whether there's more malt or more hop flavor. All in all, it's a very nice, well balanced lager. The Boston Lager is a very easy to drink beer. A very solid session beer by any standard.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BurnsTau,3.92,"Pours a medium-deep amber with a medium amount of head that laces well.  The hops are apparent in the smell, which was surprising to me, I wasn't expecting much of a hop profile in this beer.  The taste was also a surprise. I'll be honest, with my previous experiences in the American lager I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The hops are very tasty but not too aparent. It's still a refreshing beer which isn't too heavy. Overall a great, great brew which is readily available (and for a decent price). A staple in the American beer market.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MrHolland,3.89,"Bottle poured into a pilsner glass which produces a pretty thick head that sticks around for awhile; the beer is a pretty golden brown color, with bubbles moving throughout.  Smell is faint hops not much here.  The taste is very smooth with hops that hit the palate first and a sweet malty aftertaste. Very nice balancing and a good tingle in the mouth. Goes Down crisp and clean. First of the style for me and I am very pleased will be buying agian.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bozebus17,3.98,"Yup, another Boston Lager review.  Pours a deep amber orange with a thin but stubborn head. There is significant lacing inside the glass.  Smells very nice with a floral hops aroma. That is all that really stands out to me.  Taste: I'm hit with a very slight bitterness from the hops that is immediately cancelled out by carmel-like malt. The light/medium bodied lager leaves a bit of tingling on my tongue. It has a very crisp and clean taste to it.  This beer goes does easy and makes a great session brew. I have to say that this beer is kind of a sentimental favorite. It was the first beer that got me into better beers. My taste buds have grown but I still enjoy a Sams from time to time. It is an excellant beer to have if you just want to kick back and relax after a hard day. It isn't a complex beer that you have to pay a lot of attention too but it can also be pretty damn tasty. It's also a good BBQ beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,silver0rlead,4.2,"Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a nice, thick white head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma starts out with biscuity pale malt, caramel, along with some slightly spicy, floral hops. The flavor has a nice biscuity malt presence, along with some caramel sweetness, hop oils and spicy, floral hops along with some bread dough finish out the taste.

Have been subject to some not too flattering remarks pertaining to me not buying a Canadian product, however my retort of quality over quantity hopefully hit home. Pours to a very rich amber colour (I followed the directions on the bottle). Ample lacing with serious retention. Had a very subtle well balanced hop bitterness that added to the experience. Have had many of these Vienna style Lagers over the years and was never overly impressed with the longevity of taste. Sam's Lager, however passed the test completely. A session beer if ever their was one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,beerphilosopher,4.17,"Ahhh ... the standby. If all else fails, I can usually find this one in most local restaurants and/or bars. This area of the country is beer-challenged, so it's become a reliable friend.  Pours a pleasing amber color with a good solid head that retains very well. Good lacing. Nose is well balanced, with noticable hop character and a solid malt foundation. The taste plays along with a good malty profile upfront, and a pleasing hop bitterness behind. This one tastes considerably better than ANY macro lager. Suprisingly complex and well crafted. Mouthfeel is light-meduim, with good carbonation and a substantive finish ... heavy on the hop dryness. I really genuinely like this beer, and I'm not a huge lager fan in general. Thank God for Sam Adam's and it's availability. It would be nice to have more of the SA collection available around here on tap, but I'm not complaining.

Clean finish no real aftertaste.  M- just right for a vienna lager, not to thick not to thin.  D- what can I say, perfect. a great clean finish, very refreshing, and not at all watery.

I swear, if i hadn't known better i would have thought they were serving me some new American pale ale. Compared to a Newcastle, this is a regular hop bomb (of course, Newcastle isn't supposed to be hoppy, it's just interesting to note how much more the hops jump out at you when it follows something like an English brown).  Man it really hit the spot. As always, i thank God for Sam Adams, sometimes the only beer many places have other than BMC. There is simply no comparison.

A good choice over the macros and most restaurants that I have been to have this on tap. Goes down smooth and very easy to drink. Could have had several more, but had to drive home.

35,104,rodrot,3.97,"This beer has been one of my favorites since it was introduced way back in the mid to late 80's. In many grocery stores and bars, this is the only craft brew that is available and that makes it a good fall back beer. On to my review. This beer pours a clear light amber color with a one inch head that dissipates slowly. The smell is malty, with a pleasing aroma of hops wafting from the glass. Taste is also malty and sweet, with a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. This beer leaves a slight citrusy aftertaste in my mouth that blends well with the sweetness of the malt. I don't think this beer's character has changed at all over the years. Jim Koch continues to brew this beer as tasty as it was nearly 20 years ago. I'll take this any day over BMC.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,VoodooBrew,3.83,"My other review for this beer was the draft version, which I felt was quite weak. However I believe that this beer can be quite different, and better, out of the bottle.  There is much more of a pronounced hop flavor and bitterness, which become the driving forces behind this beer's success. Crisp, robust noble hops combine with the lager's inherent snappiness to create a rather enjoyable, drinkable beer. There's still enough malt to provide some beef to go along with the hops but I feel that hop character is really what can seperate bottled Sam Adams from its draft counterpart. One slight knock, however, is that I feel this brew is just a tad overcarbonated, most likely to appeal to the expectations of the larger beer-drinking market.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,skillerified,3.93,"Very clear golden-amber color with lots carbonation rising at a medium speed. About a half finger head that fades quickly to a nice little white cap.  Wow, it's been so long since I've had this. This was one of my early favorites and I always thought it smelled so strong. Things have changed for me. This smells fairly weak in comparison to what I've been enjoying lately. Scent is very citrus hoppy. Far from bad, but could be stronger, more complex. Smells very fresh too. Sort of a cut grass smell.  The taste, on the other hand, is pretty much exactly as I remember it. Good malt character followed by a nice hop bitterness. This is what beer tastes like. That's not to say that there aren't better tasting beers out there, but this is what beer tastes like to me. And I like it.  Medium bodied with a mild carbonation prickle on the tongue. Nothing outragous in this area. A basic start sweet, fade to bitter mouthfeel. Actually gets a little annoyingly slick after a while.  Possible the best macro-lager on the market. Makes a nice session beer if you're short on choices. Not only that, but it brings back good memories for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,yelterdow,4.55,"Served cold at fridge temperature from a just-purchased sixer. Freshness date reads April, 2006.  Enjoyed in an imperial pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a crystal clear rich amber color, with a terrific two finger head. The crown leaves a sticky, patchy lace down the glass for the entirety of the session. Well structured and quite impressive.  Smell- Bready, biscuity malts upfront... so nice. The label correctly describes beer as ""liquid bread"", and not since trying Fat Tire for the first time have I been more olfactorally convinced. Just a hint of hops float amongst the scenery, totally appetizing.  Taste- A subtle interplay of clean, impeccable malts and floral, mild hops. Fresh and delicious, this will compliment my next pizza perfectly. Excellent, considering this is so widely available.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Superior. That is all. Slick, then smooth... a pleasure in the mouth. The balance here is so easy and effortless, it's no wonder this beer has stood the test of time. Possibly the greatest session beer in America.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I've had a few Boston Lagers that seemed less inviting than this, but that was several years ago and perhaps it's my tastebuds that have changed. Flavor is wonderful, not too bitter, not too sweet, not very complex but full, with a slight bite (due more to bitter hops than alcohol, certainly, as this is low ABV). Hops profile is great, good caramel/malt character too. Round, creamy tone in the mouth.

I detect a sulfur odor which affects the taste and the aftertaste. I thought maybe it was just the particular bottle I got, but the 2nd one (to be fair, from the same 6 pack) was the same.

What I lost along this path was the fact that the Boston Beer Company do, in fact, make some mighty fine beers. Always a go-to beer when there is not a great selection, Sam Adams Boston Lager always had its place. It was something I always enjoyed while enjoying something else  not the focal point of what I was doing. Thus, I decided to crack open a bottle and give it my undivided attention. Plus, I like drinking beer and any excuse is a good enough excuse for me.  Pours a nice copper-amber color into my pilsener glass, a nice head with light lacing. Sweet malty aroma with slight hops. Nice toasted malt backbone balance with a floral hop hue. Feel is smooth, a lil creaminess. At under 5%, this is a fine session lager.

Smell is fresh and clean hops, faint sweetness of grain, somewhat citrusy. Tastes of crisp fruit, balanced well between hops and malt, a little hop spiciness present, leaves a hint of grain flavor in the aftertaste along with some malt as well.

35,104,Freshie,4.3,"It has been awhile since I had this classic. Recently I have been going to my local great beer stores or bars and trying many different styles and ales. Which, I admit has been wonderful and opened up whole new worlds to my palette. Every time I come back to it, I thing to myself ""Maybe I won't like it now, because of all the other flavors I have expierenced?"" But no, it never changes, I like this beer and probably will forever. As long as they do not screw with the recipe!  Okay cheesy rant complete.  It pours a nice golden honey colour and nice head, with hoppy aroma with hints of caramel. The taste has a distinct noble hops character and caramel after taste. It is smooth, and goes down nice. God this is cliche.  This beer is constant as the northern star, guiding all beer lovers to great taste. Shoot me now. hahaha",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,marksto,4.2,"A classic brew, the first real micro that became available in my area of the deep south many years ago, and one of my all time favorites. The perfect combination of smoothness, drinkability and good flavor; coupled with its widespread availablity, make this a beer I reach for very often.  Doesn't really fit totally into the style of a vienna lager with its hoppy character - I really think of it being almost a style of it's own. Deep golden colored with a thick white head and a light-medium body. The nose is dominated by noble hop aroma and this carries into the flavor as well. A smooth malt background backs it up.  This is also a beer that offers an excellent example of how freshness improves a beer. I can usually guess it's expiration date within a few months from the first sip. On the occasion when you get a really fresh example with an expiration date a good 6 months out you can really tell what a difference it makes.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

A faint hop bitter lingering in the aftertaste.  M - Carbonation extremely intense. Thin and a tad on the drying side (only a tiny bit drying though). Starts to get a bit gummy.  D - It is a drinkable brew, one of the best that Sam Adams offers. It is a good session beer (after the third I bet the alcohol is invisible to the tastebuds!) And would pair well with many foods.

35,104,TheLongBeachBum,3.98,"Presentation: 12 ounce standard brown glass bottle with a Sam Adams embossed shoulder. Classic Sam Adams label design with a dark blue background. Samuel Adams in white littering above a read banner that has the words Boston Lager in a silvery gray color. Crown cap is color coordinated with the main label. Has a nicked purchase before Mar 2006 Brewery-Fresh date.  Appearance: This really does look fantastic from the 12 ounce bottle into my 20 ounce glass. A high rising off-white head fills the void above the gorgeously clear orange-brown body. Lots of lacing that sticks around. The head collapses in a very irregular manner leaving one of those floating iceberg like heads. Subsequent drinks disturb this foamy island to produce a nice even ½ thick cap.  Nose: Light sweet malts, hints of grain and a freshly popped from the toaster Toasted Bread warmth. Hints of hops mingle nicely, sight citric lemon splash. A refreshing crisp nose from the bottle.  Taste: Sweet toasted malts gentle stroll hand in hand with a crisp refreshing bitterness that has some lemony twist. Very clean and palatable. Sure, you dont need your seatbelts for this beer ride, but it has a solid profile and the confident way it handles the road makes for a satisfying ride out. Always enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Never more than what is expected, but never any less either. Choice support from the conditioning with a low end creamy feel.  Drinkability: Smooth body with a nice clean presentation. A moor-ish 6-Pack, hard not to crack another 12 once you get to the bottom of the one you have. A great every day brew that never seems to loose any of its appeal.  Overall: So strange that I never got round to submitting a Review for this well known beverage, in fact I was well into the 3rd bottle in my 6-Pack before I realized I had not done so. It may well be considered as the ubiquitous high-volume craft brew, and get slammed for that, but this beer alone has made many layovers in Airports and trips to crappy bars all over the US that much more palatable since I came to the States 4 years ago, it deserves a medal for that alone. Easy to slam this beer for all the wrong reasons, but for me, it is what it is and it does what it has to, Im sure as hell glad this beer is here and I continue to enjoy it for all the right reasons. Tends to be a little better from the bottle than on draft I find.

The beer poured with a good head that dissapated, leaving behind a light tinge of lace.  Smell: Nothing particular jumps out of the nose. I guess that is a good thing...  Taste: A light malty taste comes immediately when the beer hits the tongue. The malt is not overpowering and has a soft cereal-like taste. Following the malts, the hops assert themselves. By assert, I do not mean that they grab you a la Hop Wallop. Instead, they give a pleasant balance to the light malt taste.  Mouthfeel: Neither hop nor malt characters overpower, giving this ale a pleasant mouthfeel. In addition, the carbonation provides the beer with a nice cleanser.

I always forget how good this is, then I order it at a bar and it never fails to impress me.

A small trail of foam was left on the glass.  Smell: A lightly toasty nutty character leads off. Spicy floral tones finish the smell.  Taste: The beer taste as it smells. There is a nice toasted malty taste on the front followed by some nicely floral hoppy notes.  Mouthfeel: The beer is meduim bodied. There is ample carbonation. The beer seems to have a pretty creamy mouthfeel.  Drinkability: This beer is a very easy to drink treat.

There is a moderate citrus hop in the nose, but nothing else... nothing special here.  The flavour is alot like a pale ale with its hop profile, but the malty twinge to the backbone lends itself to this style. There is a significant amount of citrus in the flavour.... very refreshing, especially as a session brew.  The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, and a bit too thin for my blood, but neither characteristic is so bad as to make this beer unenjoyable.  All in all, a very drinkable brew. Additionally, it's found nearly everywhere, and as such is a great fallback brew if nothing much more than BMC is available.

Smell was a wonderful waft of about piney noble hops, with some bready malt creeping in after a few swirls. Taste was an explosion of noble hops and slightly sweet malt, more bread, yet very well balanced and clean. This is a joy to drink, totally unexpected and easily one of the best lagers I've ever had.

Smell: Rich and malty, with a roasted hospitality that invigorates the nostrils. A mild hop presence spices up the senses. Some viney fruit also exudes.  Taste: Well balanced with a thoroughly pleasing flavor. Roasted nuts and French bread combine to produce an excellent malt backbone. Subtle hops in just the right proportion emerge in a floral bouquet.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and really smooth. Tingly carbonation mixes with a truly luxurious feel.  Drinkability: Thoroughly drinkable. Excellent flavor, sensually inviting, smooth and easy to imbibe. Could drink all night.  Note: My first Sam Adams. This brewery does not disappoint.

The beer has a subtle smell and is malty.  The taste is slightly bitter, and a little smokey. The flavors are not strong. After taste lingers and is also somewhat bitter.  I enjoy this beer. It is a nice medium dark lager, and I buy it fairly frequently, especially I the fall. Sam Adams Boston Lager is a good alternative to the mega-brews, but really nothing special.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,casualbeerman,4.6,"This is another of my favorite brews. Nothing unique here. Just a good lager that's really been done right. I've had this both on tap and in the bottle, but I chose a draft beer for this review because for me the draft works pretty well with this beer. The appearance is a rather dark tan, this is probably the darkest lager I've seen. The head is usually moderate but well formed and stable. I seem to recall this beer being pitched by floating the bottle cap on the head. Anyway appearance is pleasant and beerlike but not the least bit unusual. Really the color is just about typical of the beer I usually drink. Only the head is a little different, being a bit longer lived. Smell is also straightforward. Its a hearty mix of (surprise!) yeast and malt. Definately some caramel too, and in spite of the strength of the smell its still a very clean smell. As with pretty much every beer I've ever had, the smell was reflected in the taste. This is a relatively rich, sweet brew that is balanced by a strong hop presence. The famous ""two row barley"" (Boston Beer Co likes to remind you this is a high quality and expensive ingredient, but damned if I know its exact significance) makes for malt flavor that's deep and rich, but still very clean. The hops are one of my favorites ever. They provide a perfect balance, and though they're strong and pretty bitter they are also quite flavorfull and the bitterness does cross the line to become what I consider excessive. However, they don't suggest any specific ""notes"" that I can think of, just hops. In case you're as big a fan of the hops used in this beer as I am, samualadams.com tells me they are ""German Noble aroma hops"". Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side, but usually does not inhibit the drinkability. Sometimes a Sam Adams is exactly what I feel like, and then its really a beer to be savored. Sometimes it turns out to be a good session beer for me, other times it weights on me after a glass or two and I have to switch to something lighter. While Yuengling Traditional is my top favorite, this is one of my favorites. To me its sort of like Yuengling's older (in style, obviously not the age of the brewery) and heartier cousin. It has a bit more depth than Yuengling, and its thicker. Sometimes this is just what I'm craving, sometimes Yuengling's even easier flavor and superior drinkability make me reach for it first. Anyway, as many other people will probably tell you, there's nothing this isn't complicated, it isn't fancy, its not exotic. Its just a hearty lager that they took the time to really do right. If I had to offer a lager to a more experienced beer drinker who tends to turn his/her nose up at Lagers in general because they're too wimpy and don't have enough flavor I'd probably go with this even though its very unlikely I'd be broadening their horizons any.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,daliandragon,3.6,"This is another of those beers that I've had literally dozens of times in my decade or so as a legal consumer of malted beverages but never reviewed for whatever reason. Then today I picked up Sam's Winter Classics 12 for tommorows whistle whetting in case my Dad didn't get anything good (which of course, he didn't). Sam's flagship pours reddish and trasparant with lots of visible carbonation and a thin cap of white head. The major extant smell whiffs of moderate hops, along with a bit of caramel malt. The taste has a few distinct stages:first some sweet malt flavor followed by a hoppy crest with some pleasant bitternesss, and finally a clean tasting finish with a hint of metal. I always thought there was a tinge of fruit flavor to this beer but I can't locate it tonight. Some decent complexity for such a mainstream beevo. Mouthfeel is overcarbonated as I mentioned but otherwise palatable, hitting the roof of the mouth pleasantly and showing reasonable fullness. This is overall respectable and likable beer, although not overly exciting.

35,104,unknownlamer,3.63,"Got this at Whoville out in Bellmont on Long Island (visiting my dad for the week).  Poured a clear copper color with a reasonable head (probably the only good pour I got all night) in a standard pint glass. The head fizzled away fairly quickly, and there was no lacing left on the glass as I drank it.  The aroma was a mixture of generic two row barley and Saaz smelling hops. The taste was similar being a bit caramelly, but mostly bready and clean. The hops finish was decent with moderate bitterness and a good spicy bite. The aftertaste, however, was mostly grainy and not very hoppy.  The carbonation and body were really nice. It felt solid in the mouth at least. It's good that this is available as many places as it is because it makes a decent backup beer when the other selections suck. I wouldn't order this as my first choice, but that is mostly because I prefer a solid pale ale over anything else so the cleanness and lack of any fruitiness aren't my cup of tea.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Mouthfeel: A little astringent dryness in the finish, makes you want to have another sip.  Drinkability: I never used to like Sam Adams Boston Lager, but it has grown on me (maybe there is something in their seasonals that has increased my appreciation).

Slight notes of orange and a tinge of caramel. Malty ale background from a lager - interesting.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Slick oil hop punch (a light jab, a passing blow) rounded out by a smooth barley background. A spiced hint, smooth carbonation and a touch of orange rind.  Notes and Drinkability: Koch claims nothing beyond the German Purity Laws are used in this brew - which holds back from many robust flavours that you see in many popular ales these days.

I was unprepared for the head on it. It had a thick head that was about two fingers. The head had the appearance of fresh fallen snow. The smell is similar to a good red beer. The taste is somewhere between a quality light beer and a red beer. The mouthfeel is exceptional. No bite whatsoever. As a result, I could drink these all night. This would certainly be a session beer. I think a 12 of these will come along with me in a couple weeks to the annual New Year's Eve bonfire.

Flavor had the malt up-front followed by a lingering bitterness. Lops of hop flavor as well. Nice taste; maybe a bit too much hop bitterness (not flavor) or, more likely, needs a bit more malt backbone. Gets more balanced as it warms, so don't serve it too cold.

35,104,Phatz,3.88,"Appearance: This beer poured into my pilsner glass a light coppery color with a slight hint of golden amber. I got a huge 3-4 finger white head; very frothy even after the head dissipates. Significant lacing. There were tiny bubbles of carbonation rising the hole way throughout the length of the beer. Nice appearance; above average in its class.  Smell: The smell is malty but also slightly sour; with nice spices though. It is certainly acceptable but not overly enticing.  Taste: In the taste, there are noticeable spices like in a winter warmer. It is malty and sweet, followed by a bit of sour and gentle wheat and hop flavors. It is pleasantly robust. Nothing irritates me more than watery beer and this is a full taste but not overly complex. It is rather straight forward and simple. This is very easy drinking with nearly no bite at all on the tongue. The aftertaste is nice and gentle. Definitely makes of an approachable beer.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is crisp and slightly creamy but still thinner than I'd prefer. It is certainly above most in its class and price range.  Drinkability: This is the definition of Drinkability. It is a slightly boring beer if you are looking for something extreme. But if what you are looking for is Drinkability; this is it! It is so easy to go down, so pleasant and inoffensive in the mouth, it is mild, and it sits light in your stomach. This is definitely a 'Bar beer' for me; or a (session) beer that I'll take one after another. Party beer all the way! This is also easily available where many micro-brews may not be. It is a great choice over other American Macros when youre out!  --- Many BAs seem to consider this beer to be too mainstreamed. I think that pedjudice is partly due to the overwhelming success of SA Boston Lager. You can easily take a case to a Macro-Dinking friends party and it will go over very well (in my experience). ---   Hope this is helpful.

The smell is rather one dimensional, with smells of fresh bread taking the forefront. Sweetish, with a little graininess in the background. Nice enough.  A nice grainy, bread-like malt taste is what hits first. This is quickly followed by a pleasant bitter-sweetness as the hops join in to balance it out, which plays well on the tongue. It finishes quite dry with some notes of dry hay.  Mouthfeel is quite nice, with a silky smoothness that goes down well.  A nice enough lager, with good color, carbonation, and plenty of flavor.

Tasted of smooth non-aggressive lager sourness, with some good wheat and oat flavors along with an apple and raspberry sweetness. This beer finished with a crisp hop dryness.

Just the right amount of carmonation and head all in one package. This is the example other macros should follow.  Smell is mostly malt with a little bit of floral hop spike. Smells of warm bread.

Heavier than I typically like in a beer, especially with food but very balanced. Not overly carbonated. Very smooth.  Drinkability is good. You could drink this one all night if you favor the style. Again, it goes down smooth and is tasty. Low alcohol makes it a very good beer for parties. The prototypical cross-over for macro drinkers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Finite,4.5,"I dont care if its a macro! This is a great beer. Pours a sexy red golden colour with a perfect sized lager head which reduces a slightly thicker leaving some of the greatest lacing I have seen for a lager.  The smell is of sweet caramel malts and floral hops which fill the noise with perfect balance. The taste is of smooth caramel malts, accompanied with some refreshing floral hops.  The taste if sweet for a long time with the sweetness lingering on the edges of the palate for as long as possible.  Ending with a perfect bitter aftertaste and a tad of those yummy malts, which just teases you to have more.  The mouthfeel is great carbonation which makes for a very refreshing drop.  This brew kicks arse",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Px2GrafX,4.05,"had this with my dinner last night after listening to a review on craft beer radio podcast. poured a very clear, golden and lightly-amber in a pint glass. nice 2 inch foamy slightly off-white head with good retention and lacing down the glass. sweet caramelly aroma with a very evident and surprising floral hop aroma. i didn't expect the hops from a sam adams lager. first sip is caramel malt. balancing lightly spicy hop flavor with good bitterness. nice balancing hop character. finishes a touch try with a light toastiness. light-medium body with good carbonation and a decent swallow that clunks just a tad. very drinkable session brew with good flavor and no apparent alcohol. i haven't tasted this in propbably 4 years or more until last night. excellent session brew if you're strapped for more flavorful options. one of my new non-micro favorites.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Vancer,2.61,"Hmm, from the winter sampler pack  this one turned me off Sam Adams a long time ago. It was on tap at a local place, and I remember the exact same thoughts: Nice looking pour, mahogany brown with a nice tan head, somewhat malty aroma with just some hints of hops. But wow, is this an awful taste, raspy, hoppy and earthy  just not a pleasant brew at all. Way to unbalanced in my book.  The Boston Ale is good, the lager is a bad rep of a Vienna lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,metallistout,4.52,"Well I'm partial to this beer, because this is the beer that started it all for me. After I had enjoyed this little brew for the first time, all I'd had was the normal macros(We're going back at least 7 or 8 years ago). Until the beer, I never knew what real malt or hops tasted like. Now, I'm not saying this is the best beer in the world, but it is one of the better beers out there with ""HUGE NAME"".  Pours a light amber color with a frothy thick head(even better on draft).  Smells of floral hops and sweet malts.  Tastes mostly of hops, but you can taste the malt presence.  Finishes dry, but I could drink it until I fall over.  Thanks Jim Koch!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MSchae1017,4,This was tasted in a Mug from the bottle.  The beer pours a nice amber/brown color with a gold sizeable frothy head that laces nicely. It smells of some good hops with some sweet malty smell. It tastes nicely sweet with some mixed in good bitterness. Basically a great flavor overall for this style. It feels moderately thick with some good carbonation. This is definitely one of my favorite lagers.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Mitchel,3.3,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a light orange with a blond tinge. The head is pretty average in thickness and is uneven and creamy and sticks to the glass for the whole time I enjoy this fallback beer.  The lager smells of hops and caramel. It is very flowery in aroma. The taste is what you should expect of SA. It has that initial kick in the teeth which keeps you coming back for more every time. It has a sweet hoppy finish which concludes fairly dry. I dont know what to call the taste other than herbal.  As stated before, this is a fallback beer for me as I imagine that it is for most BAs. The thing that I appreciate the most about The Boston Beer Companies products is the fact that they are consistent. I dont rank this beer incredibly high, but I really appreciate the dependability of this brewer and its products.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

In the nicest way this was a complicated beer. Hops malt and yeast were all ther but all integrated.Not overly hoppy not too malted , it ws very pleasant. This would be a fantastic session beer , because it is so balanced and smooth , but it costs a premium ,so ,alas will be a special treat beer only",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It smells sweet. There is also a slight hop aroma. Not piney , just floral. This beer has a clean crisp taste. I can taste a caramel sweet flavor. The hop presence is light, but refreshing. It has a slight spicy finish. It goes down very smooth, leaving a malty sweet aftertaste. I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. It is refreshing, and it tastes good. Also, it is not high in alcohol. I usually have a six pack of this stuff in my second refrigerator.

I snuck one of my father's Sam Adam's Boston Lagers when I was 17, and I've been on the path of craft beer ever since. I've been living in San D for the past 3 1/2 years and have developed a taste for big hoppy bears. I've been drinking Sammy Boston Lager for years and now I will review it with a new palate.  Poured a bright golden orange. Thick foamy white head holds nicely in my glass. Leaves little bubbly lacing as I sip away. Nice slow carbonation.  Great smell of breadlike malts and mild hops. A scent of tea in there.  Very smooth, rich caramel malt sweetness. Mild tea-like bitterness. Very balanced and totally drinkable.  One of my favorite beers, my #1 fall back beer, and definetely a session beer.  Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,dmbgator,3.42,"Poured from a 12oz bottle  What can you really say about this well known Boston creation. I personally am not a large fan of macrobreweries, however, I enjoy some of the high quality brews that Samuel Adams produces. With that being said, let me speak about the Boston Lager. I poured the lager into my Sam Adams pint glass, and noticed a very golden-like hue. At the top of the glass formed a very nice white head, which stayed througout my drink. The nose of the beer was full of fruits and some nice maltiness. The taste of the beer wasn't as good as the smell. I was expecting more of a sweeter taste, however, seemed a little bland with a little spice at the end. The mouth feel was average, and of course the drinkability is quite high. Must say that for an American macrobrew, it is enjoyable. Can put a few of these back easily during the course of a night.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,chOAKbarrell,3.63,"Well, what more is there really to say about Samuel Adams Boston Lager?  Everyone knows what its like - a rich golden, smooth drinking, incredibly consistent, flavorful beer.  It's a great thing that a craft brewery has gotten so big, and accepted into the mainstream, that they can compete with the big guns. Often times, Samuel Adams is the only decent beer you will find in a liquor store or bar. They broke the mold, and now hopefully, other craft breweries will be able to follow and gain mainstream acceptance as well.  This beer, and brewery, demand respect.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

American hop nose, with some toasted crystal malt. The taste is caramel and crystal malt upfront, then some sweet munich malts come out. The aftertaste is herbal american hops and leaves a semi-dry bitter finish with slight residual sweetness. Lightly carbonated,and medium in body with a mouthfeel that is both crisp and smooth. Hop flavor is more pronounced on-tap, and perhaps a bit stronger than appropriate, but the rich malt profile makes a nice balance. Full flavored and highly drinkable, it's no mystery why this wins awards.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ski271,4.15,"Pours a clear medium-dark amber with a small, slightly off-white, foamy head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. The smell is mild and bready with light herbal hops backing it up. Pleasant caramel aroma. It has a good balance of flavors: caramel, grain, citrus, and a little tea-like. It has a very nice dry, lightly citrus finish, a medium body, and soft carbonation. I forgot how good this beer is for being one thats so widely available. Its an all around satisfying and easy drinking beer, that was a great transition beer for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,misterscooter,4,"The big, frothy white head sat on dark golden liquid, slowly forming larger bubbles from the mass of tiny ones. This head lasted quite a while and gave off a balanced smell of hops and malt, neither overly strong. A flowery sweet smell intermingled in the common beer aromas.  This guy is solid. Great hops, through and through. It is dry but not bitingly bitter. The malt balances it with some sweetness but always a bite of dryness there. Through and through, a great beer, an excellent benchmark.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

S: Malty and hoppy with some light floral aspects.  T: Continues with malty and hoppy profiles from the scent, but adds some breadiness and caramel. Finishes nicely bitter.  M: Coats the mouth. Has a nice meduim body and not too much carbonation.  D: Definitely a session beer. Almost seems to be the definition of a session beer.  Overall: This is really a nice little lager, and readily available most places. Definitely a good alternative to try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nose is pleasant, of malt and hops with a sweet nutty aroma and perhaps some wood. Taste is quite pleasing, with sweet and bitter mixing along with some hops and complexity that I cant place. Mouth is quite smooth and enjoyable, making this a very drinkable brew. The finish is nicely bitter.  Overall: A very good to excellent lager. Not a premium beer, but definitely several cuts above most of what is usually available at the local sports bar.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Shovelbum,4.42,"A billowing white head over a translucent light-amber body. Decent retention and long-lingering lace. A light hop aroma upfront combines with notes of malt. Strikes a perfect balance between flavors of sweet and caramel malts and hop bitterness. Medium-light body with full-flavor, not at all watery. Crisp in the mouth and finishes with a mildly drying hop bitterness.  This is one fine session beer. The price to character ratio, makes this an ideal beer for supplying large thirsty groups. On-top of that it is not too great of a shock for macro-lager drinkers. Combine that with Jim Kochs recent spate of beer- drinker education propaganda on the labels and this makes a very effective conversion tool. Utility aside, this is one of the few lagers I drink by choice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

This fine lager has a milky smooth head that leaves chunked and thorough lacing with every pull. Amber color with shades of red on the edges.  Malted flavors dominate but its very smooth and not overpowering. Caramel is the strongest taste once again smooth and a slight hop presence to clean up. Carbonation is nicely balanced to create a comfortable mouthfeel.  Low ABV, big Flavor, not a combination you will find too often.

35,104,Naes,3.7,"This one is copper/amber colored with an inch of white head. There is lots of carbonation floating up in this beer. The aroma is quite malty and bread like. The flavor starts out with toasty malt, then moves to a semi bitter hop flavor and goes back to the malt. The hops make a final return in the aftertaste. As the beer warms, the malts take over and it becomes significantly less hopy. Mouth feel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated.

35,104,shbobdb,4,"Sam Adam's is a solid beer. It occupies that grey area between BMC and craft brews and does so splendidly! The beer is a nice, dark vienna lager with a pleasant caramel taste which is nicely complimented by the artful use of hops. No one aspect of this beer stands out as being remarkable, but the blending is incredibly pleasant. Oh, and the mouthfeel! I judge a good beer on its mouthfeel and this beer has got a nice grainy feel to it. It has a hint of the liquid bread aspect that I demand of good beers without being too thick. It's a perfect beer for drinking with the guys. Even ardent male BMC drinkers will have it (get the light if there are ardent female BMC drinkers. . . I found that out the hard way) and enjoy it, and ardent beer nerds will drink it without complaint. Good stuff. Good, good stuff.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,woemad,4.03,"Id never actually had this beer before, so I decided, what the hell, when I saw a 12er of it on sale at a Safeway here in balmy Spokane. According to the box, these are best before Feb06. I really appreciate that fact it was right on the top of the box. It kept me from grabbing the one in the front, which was best by Oct05. The bottle labels also feature easily decipherable freshness dates.  Poured a semi-clear copper color with a big, creamy white head that took its time dropping. There was a fairly decent amount of lace. The remnants of the head prominently capped this beer right down almost to the bottom of my glass. This could very possibly be the best looking mass-market lager Ive ever seen.  O my god! I smell hops in this! Okay, its not exactly an IPA, but Im not used to smelling much hoppiness at all in a lager thats brewed in as much quantity as this one. Its not a strong hoppiness. In fact. only a BMC ninny who really thinks hot women will appear when he twists open his bottle of swill would find this level of hoppiness objectionable in the slightest degree. Theres also a mild, caramel sweetness.  The mild, floral hoppiness and the caramelish sweet maltiness seem to hit the taste buds at about the same time and complement each other nicely. Theres a bit of a dry note at the finish, but its nothing spectacular. For plain old drinking while watching a game or just hanging out, this beer goes down smoother than my shaved head. I wouldnt pare it with a fine dining experience, but it would make an outstanding beer to convert your macro-addicted friends, as its good, yet not a smack to the taste buds.  This is somewhere between light and medium bodied. Carbonation level is about what I expected.  This would make an outstanding session beer. I could dispatch several of these without regard to my palate and its relatively low abv wouldnt have me at the dreaded I love you, man unless I emptied a crapload of bottles.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Nose is light toasty and toffee sweetness with a mild noble hop. I was not expecting that hop. Flavor is toasty and sweet...not caramel, but similar, with a moderate grainy finish, balancing out with a light bitterness that just lets you know there are some hops in there. Very tasty beer. I'm not as crazy about the grainy finish. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I really enjoy this brew. The grainy, hop, sweet balance is really nice.

Labelled as 4.8% ABV, best by May-06.  I have not had a Vienna style lager before, so was a little surprised by how dark (true-to-style) this appeared. A dark amber with no perceived chill haze and a subdued head.  Smelled of malts mostly with a touch of hops. Not a strong smell.  Tasted fairly good, not a complex taste but interesting enough.

Very clean aroma.  Taste: Again, a clean and crisp flavor. A nice bready malt start with clean grain tastes, and just enough hops to balance out the finish.

Light earthy hops/crystal malt sweetness in the nose. Not overpowering.  Taste is somewhat sweet and malty at first, but the hops make themselves known in the flavor and especially in the aftertaste. Herbal aftertaste is pleasant.  Overall, a pleasant surprise. This is the first one I have had fresh in a while. Usually I get something that has sat for a while at a BMC type place. Very good fresh.

Something else to the taste, but I can't put my finger on it. Whatever it is, it isn't a bad thing.  Good feel on the palate. Thicker mouthfeel than expected.  Well I'm quite taken with this brew.

Good enough for me.  Poured a nice deep orange-gold with a 1.5 inch cream head smells of malt, hop bite, some fruity aroma, maybe figs.  Mouthfeel is jumpy and spicy, plenty of carbonation which tempered a bit as the glass warmed. Taste is extremely well-rounded.

The aroma stands out for a mass-produced beer: prominent Hallertau hop aroma and a touch of maltiness.  Nicely balanced taste with decent hopiness, malt, caramel and bitterness. Easily drinkable beer.  I had sworn off Sam Adams after their nut-case ""spokesman"" Koch pulled one of his idiotic promotions with a couple of shock-jocks in New York radio. I have forgiven, and drink the beer again.  Also, my best friend's daughter is now a chemist employed by the Boston Brewing Co.

35,104,HardTarget,3.93,"Bottle Inspection: Brown 12 oz raised lettering, best by Dec 05 notched. Extra label on the back mentions Hallertauer Mittelfrueh hops.  Aroma: Nobel hop nose backed by a serious lightly roasted malt base, almost Oktoberfest in nature (the malt, the hops are too strong for the style).  Appearance: Very clear light amber glass with several carbonation streams feeding a creamy white cap that poured at a nice frothy finger but settled to a full cover, leaving thick lace that gives tidemarks.  Flavor: Rich balanced taste. Starts a bit malty, goes a touch hoppy, then finishes with a very pronounced yeastiness. Impressive balance overall that lets the yeast shine. Funny how when I first tasted this beer so long ago that I found it too hoppy. I noted a bit of a tea late in the glass and the hops show up a bit more as it warms a touch.  Mouthfeel: Fully carbonated but not fizzy, a little foamy in the mouth, medium body and a velvety texture.  Overall Impression: Theres a reason Sam Adams is a cornerstone of the craft beer market. This beer is well made, easy to drink, flavorful and enjoyable. No real flaws, but its a bit too carbonated for me, and while the flavor is straightforward, its somewhat bland. I was surprised to see I hadnt rated this classic before now.

Despite all those points against it, I find the Boston Lager served from a faucet to be a much kinder, gentler beverage than the same thing from a bottle. Bitterness was about the same level as from the bottle, but less harsh and more pleasant. More sweet, carmel aroma and flavor was present, too, that nicely balanced the hops.  This is a very pleasant session beer that goes great with pizza or blackened chicken.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,DaveFL1976,3.7,"I know exactly what Sam Adams Boston Lager (and most of its permutations) tastes like back in the US, but how will it suit my palate here in Australia? All it cost was AU$7 to find out. Ouch! Poured in a tall, warm glass, 1/5 of the glass filled with a familiar off-white foam that looked familiar. Below that was a light amber-looking beer with a few bubble trains that wouldnt let up. I had to wait a few minutes for the foam to settle down enough to allow me to pour the rest of the beer in. The head stuck around for a few minutes at least, and left behind a nice lacing on the side of the glass, and the top of the foam even curled over on itself like soft serve ice cream. Even though its a widely-penetrating US craft brew I would find it hard to believe that anyone wouldnt be impressed with the looks of this beer. The smell is a combination of sweet, yet roasted malt, and bitter, but not floral hops. The taste is, well just as I remember it, even though its 8,000 miles away from where it was brewed. Upon entering your mouth, the back of your tongue senses the bitterness of some long-boiled hops, while the front of the tongue picks up a bit of malty sweetness. Somehow, my cheeks can taste this as well; Im just not sure how that works, biologically speaking. Mouthfeel is very nice, with a pretty good amount of carbonation, but not feeling soda-like. In summary, Im looking forward to getting Sam Adams back in the States for $6.50 a 6 pack. Here, in Australia, its AU$23 per 6. Thats about $18 per 6 in US dollars.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,diablo14,3.8,"if this beer wasnt so damn expensive in australia id drink it more often. as it is i only intermittently consume boston lager, like when its getting close to use by date and winds up in the clearance bin. that said, its a nice, easy to drink lager thats got real body and firm flavors that go well with me each time i drink it.  lovely color thats orange to amber, compact head of white foam, and perfect fizz. a moderately complex but not huge nose on this brew. has a nutty aroma, plenty of malt, some hop zing with some dried fruit and cherries coming into play also.i do love the smooth malty taste of this beer, good level of caramel sweetness with that hint of cherries and dried fruit appearing in the mid palate. dry, but not excruciatingly bitter, and quite refreshing for a beer thats reasonably full in body. good balance for the whole journey, always a big positive in my book.  the boston lager, despite the price, is easily the best american lager we can get in this country. you do pay thru the nose for it, fortunately its a beer worth handing over the hard earned for every once in a while.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Shaw,4.1,"As a hophead, I'm surprised I like this beer so much. It's a great fallback to have at a restaurant instead of BMC brews.  It's a lovely ruby in color with a frothy head. It smells nicely of malted barley.  The taste is quite malty with just a bit of bitterness to balance the sweetness. The body is also good and substantial. This isn't a light beer by any means.  Overall this is a good beer that's very drinkable. Hats off to the Boston Beer Co. This is one of their best brews. I'd say check it out, but this beer is everywhere and you've already had it a million times, no doubt.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TongoRad,3.96,"Bottle notched Nov/2005  I poured this into a Pilsener glass- it is a deep golden amber color with a tall dense off-white head that lasts a long time and leaves a ton of lacing in its wake. A steady stream of bubbles constantly rises from the bottom. Great appearance!  Aroma is moderate but nicely put together- hops are immediately apparant (some spice, lime peel and a touch of grassiness) as is a good dose of caramel. There is also a bit of toasted bread and an underlying creaminess.  The palate is crisp yet full, perhaps a bit sweet, and dominated by the malty elements. Bitterness doesn't hit you over the head but it's there. There is lingering toasted grain on the finish. Some hop flavor comes on late and adds another facet of interest.  This is a classic beer and a real pleasure to revisit from time to time.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bark,3.4,"The colour is pale amber; the liquid is clear. The finger thick head is off-white and airy. No lacing occurs.  The smell is quite sweet with notes of fresh bread and caramel. Some citric fruity notes in the background.  The taste is balanced and smooth with notes of levain bread, caramel and dried exotic fruits. Mild bitterness. Medium body. The aftertaste got more exotic fruits and some citric peels, some caramel and a touch of banana peel. The malty finish got notes of old fashioned toffee and bitter herbs.  The carbonation is fresh; the small long-lived bubbles tickles the tongue. The liquid is smooth.  I reviewed this beer 11 years ago. At the time, I found it balanced and tasty and gave it 4.0. Today, I am not as impressed. It is still a tasty American lager, but the bar has been raised.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,elricorico,4.07,"Pours a clear copper with a finger of fizzy white head. The head fades to a thin cap, but leaves some lacing on the edge.  Smell is a very flowery hop bouquet. Not what I expect when I pour a lager, it is a pleasant surprise.  Taste is again dominated by hops. The flavour is big, no watery lager here. This would hold its own with a pale ale or a bitter. The first flavour is a mild molasses sweetness, but the finish is much bigger and bolder. Lingering dry hoppiness leads to the next sip each time.  Mouthfeel is good, light but not watery, well carbonated but not coarse. A little bit of slickness when rolled over the tongue.  A very drinkable beer. Your average swill drinker might find this one to be too much taste, but I find it a pleasant change from a watered down lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ryantupy,4.2,Appearance: This poured nice golden hues with a nice rocky white head that was a little on the creamy side.  Smell: Very floral on the hops and malt sweetness were most noticeable. Definatly an aromatic beer that was unique in its scents.  Taste: Malt sweetness with a nice creaminess with a nice floral hop flavor that laps through your mouth. It a floral hoppy finish with a little bite.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth as it laps over you tongue and through youre mouth.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,swid,3.75,"Sam Adams Boston Lager pours a dark gold/almost amber color into my pilsner glass. A 1/4"" head forms, and quickly dissipates. Moderate carbonation, little lacing. The smell is grassy, with a hint of caramel sweetness and a bit of floral hop spice.  The taste of this beer is very well balanced: there's just enough hop bitterness to complement the moderately sweet, toasty and caramel malts. The mouthfeel is perhaps the only real weak point of the Boston Lager. It's a decent balance between lightness and fullness, yet the finish is somewhat harsher (and is a bit metallic) than what it ought to be. The aftertaste, however, is mildly sweet and bitter and is pleasant enough on its own.  Overall, this is a good fallback lager, and is enjoyable on its own merits.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,pentathlete,3.63,"Dark yellow with a huge foamy head that stubbornly sticks around. Smell is mild malt, nothing else too exciting but nothing off.

Certainly better than the typical macro.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ReebShorts,3.19,"Pours a pale orange color, decent white head but fades pretty quick to a thin layer. Some lacing evident at the top of glass only.  Smells grainy, maybe grapefruit and/or orange, hops, and caramel malt.  Taste is ok a first (a bit sweet for a lager), but there is a slight mediciney astringent aftertaste. Plus this goes down watery in the last half. Not the best or worst lager i've had. Somewhere in the middle I suppose",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ColoradoBobs,3.18,"Well, what can I say? It's a lager. Despite that, it doesn't actually suck. One can detect some caramel malt behind the whole lot of carbonation and the ginormous head, and then the big hit of hops hops and more hops. There's some background warmth of the malt, and a little bit of what might be a sour cherry note, but not much here in terms of complexity. A little more complex mouthfeel than most lagers.  As lagers go, this is a good one -- but lagers, for the most part, are just too one-dimensional to be very attractive.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Weizenmensch,3.39,"Sam Adams ""Boston Lager"" - reviewed as a Vienna lager, 355mL brown bottle, no freshness date.  The appearance of a Vienna lager is very important to the style - this conforms to a good standard, but is slightly the wrong colour (a little too pale orange rather than red), has adequate but not great head retention, and acceptable lacing. Average appearance for the style, but it still looks good in this stemmed Grolsch glass.  Smell is very nice: sweetish honey notes, maybe clove or some other earthy vegetable smell, perhaps citrus as well. Complex enough to pull apart into its components; one of those aromas that hits you as a fine, complex beer smell.  Taste: The smell sets the beer up to taste fuller than it does. Bitter hops, malt, citrus perhaps, but with quite a thin mouthfeel. Not the infinite blend of flavours present in some Vienna lagers I've had. A little bit sweet, probably from the choice of malt, and rather bitter. Pleasant but definitely nothing special.  Mouthfeel is too thin for this type of beer. Needs more to back it up. Carbonation is particularly low, and it shows. However, it is full enough to drink a few of - if I could afford a six of this, I'd be content drinking it at a party or something. Overall, quite nice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Beergeeknut,4,Appearance: Pours a nice amber with slight copper hues with a frothy head.  Smell: Caramel notes with floral hops.  Taste: A nice balance between hoppiness and malt with caramel notes.  Mouthfeel: A nice bite of hoppiness yet smooth.  Notes: This one will is and always will simply a great all around brew for any season. Still tastes as good as the first time I had it. A perfect fall back beer.

Also some lacing on the glass.   Smell: A slight caramel nose with a strong hop smell coming through. Also slightly citrus.   Taste: Starts with a sweet malty taste then a hoppy citrus flavor in the middle and then finishes with a grainy taste. Overall, a good taste.   Mouthfeel: Clean and smooth. The carbonation is just right. Somewhat watery.   Drinkability: Very drinkable, a good session or fall back choice.  This is my first Sam Adams beer and it was an overall good lager.

35,104,Citadel82,3.35,"This is a beer you can usually find in most bars in the downtown area as well as most local beer stores. It is a decent brew, but I have to be in a certain mood to drink it. There are so many good alternatives.  I was at the Seaport with friends and running through the taps. I had tried the Summer Ale and the PU Amber this was my final beer of the night.  The beer arrived at the table a tad cold with little or no head. As I let it warm the aroma was hoppy with faint caramel malt. The taste was floral hops and some decent malt in the middle with a decent ""leafy"" finish. It was not a disappointment and I am willing to drink this stuff when there are no new taps to try or when there is nothing better available. Not a bad beer , I am just spoiled.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance: Slightly cloudy golden brown body, with an off-white filmy head  Nose: Sweet caramel with a slight hop fragrance. The sweetness is most prominent though, hints of butterscotch, a little aniseed, and overripe fruit. A nice nose, but a little subdued.  Taste: Starts off with the same sweetness as is on the nose but this is quickly followed by a toasted bitterness. A rich finish with hints of honey ties up the package, which, overall, is very tasty.

35,104,jakester,4.03,"This was from the Brewmaster's Collection sampler case. Expiration dates clearly marked on the case and on the bottles!! Yay!  Pours a beautiful clear orange with a two finger head of just off-white foam. Impressive looking beer. Head drops to a good coating and leaves perfect lacing all the way down.  Aroma is nice spicy/grassy hops and clean bready malts. Freshly mown grass and black pepper come to mind. A little caramel malt is there as well.  This has a peppery spiciness to the flavor. Noble hops for sure. Tastes clean and crisp. A pretty strong amount of hop bittering is present for a beer of this style. The aftertaste has a long, lingering residual bready sweetness, but not real sweet, if you know what I mean. A well made beer.  Mouthfeel is smooth but crisp. A pleasant soft bite from carbonation skips across your tongue. The finish is slightly sweet, with a bitter grab at the back of your throat at the end.  I would like to see this reviewed in a blind taste test. I think it gets downplayed because it's Sam Adams. This is a damn good Vienna lager.

35,104,Sycodrummer,3.63,"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into a pint glass the beer yielded a light, white and fluffy head about a finger thick that settled to little more than a sliver and left spots of lace down the sides of the glass. The beer itself was an amber-orange color with about average light penetration and some streams of carbonation running up the sides of the glass.  The nose was suprisingly hoppy with some malt and slight citrus undertones. Some mild scents of oranges as well.  The hop character of the beer suprised me. An innitial malty taste quickly gave way to the hops creating a sharp a bitter crispness to each sip. Not IPA bitter, but a more mild even bitterness that seemed to coat the entire palate. Very well in balance with the maltiness and the citrus scents in the nose were only slightly detectable in the taste.  Moderate mouthfeel with modest carbonation despite the appearance of what looked like more than ample carbonation.  Very drinkable and enjoyable. Enjoyed it alone for the purpose of the review and then paired it with some Hungarian Gulash. The bitterness and hop character of the beer were perfect in neutrlizing the spiciness of this dish and it made a great pairing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BrewMaven,3.77,"This was a ""drink from the bottle"" road test so the appearance rating is based on the fact that this looked darker than the average macro lager. I was outdoors so I couldn't get a good read on the aromas. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel was more substantial than a macro type beer. This has more of a Euro lager feel to it. Went down smooth and easy and served it's purpose that day as a cookout beer very well. Also goes well with most any dinner I've had it with. Cheers.  Update: The above review was definitely based on a slightly skunked example of this beer. I've had it several times since and it's quite a tasty/malty beer! Dangerously drinkable.

I think though as I have journeyed through the crazy world of fine brews I realize that my tastes evolved. Still reliable but just not the one I used to enjoy.  The taste is spicy for a lager.

35,104,thechaacster,3.88,"Pours a light amber with a light head that stuck around for most of my glass. Taste of sweet caramel malt, with a bite of hops that provided more bitterness than expected.

35,104,Fish113d,3.71,"Pouring chilled at 50 degrees (F) into a pint glass, this lager pours a honey/amber color leaving a 1 1/2"" light white head. Very clean and nice looking.  Aroma is mainly of some lemon and grainy malts. Some wheat aroma comes through along with some grassy hops. Nothing really exciting about it.  Taking a sip, I get a sharp biting wheat flavor along with some slightly sweet caramel malts, followed up by a bit of earthy hops. Maybe even some slight vanilla comes through ahead of the hops flavor on the finish. Robust in flavor, and tasty overall.  Mouthfeel is rather nice. Not as carbonated as other lagers, and much better balanced than most. Enjoyable on the palete and some slight bitterness makes it interesting.

Unlike most mass produced beer, could taste a small hint of hops which balanced well with the malt. Tasted crisp and clean on the mouth and was quite refreshing. A good, but not great beer and very drinkable. A nice backyard barbecue beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,NClifestyle,3.65,"When poured into a pint glass, the Boston Lager presents an amber/orange color and a ½ in. head of foam. A smell of bitter citrus follows a hint of malt; this is how a beer should smell, no trace of corn or rice scent in this lager. This beer offers a wonderful taste, with many flavors passing the lips to the throat. There's a hoppy bite at the start, but it is quickly replaced by a caramel malt flavor. A slightly bitter taste remains at the back of the mouth, similar to fruit or ginger, and can be a bit strong, but it lessens as one continues to drink the beer. Some carbonation remains throughout the pint, but nothing too overwhelming. While Samuel Adams Boston Lager is somewhat full in the mouth, this beer begs for repeated pours. Further, it can be drank anytime, summer or winter. I remember drinking a Sam Adams in early high school, and thinking it was the most bitter beer in the world, and I might not be able to finish a sip, much less an entire bottle. Ah how times change.

35,104,scooter231,3.61,"It's hard for me to describe this beer in a lot of ways- so much going on. It pours pretty enough, a golden reddish amber color, some head around the edges, a few bubbles. The smell is... a lot of things. I got a lot of citrus and lemon, a soury feeling, but there was also some sweetness, which I felt didn't really belong.  Taste is also complicated- same soury citrusness, and some floralness going on. Tart, bitey. Mouthfeel is okay- a bit on the chewy side, and not too watery, with some bubbles bouncing around. But I kept getting a kind of... overdoneness sense at the end of a sip. Too much going on at once- I felt like I was drinking all kinds of beers at the same time. By no means a bad beer, but not my taste on the whole.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,danielharper,4.33,"Purchased from Target on University, Huntsville, AL.  Believe it or not, this was the second beer I ever tasted -- the first was a bottle of Carta Blanca at a local Mexican eatery. Therefore, this beer holds something of a special place in my heart, although I haven't had any in bottles for some time -- I was trying out a lot of other brews before I came back to it.  When I first tried this beer, I thought it was almost too bitter for words -- the malty aftertaste was really nice, but the taste itself was so extreme as to make this beer almost undrinkable for me. Now that my tastes have matured on much hoppier and more bitter beers like IPAs and Dry Stouts, I find this beer a nice, easy complement to an afternoon of surfing the net or watching TV. Just a note on changing tastes -- what seems difficult today might be downright smooth a year or so from now.  On to the review.  The beer pours a nice reddish-orange color with a thick foamy head. Lacing is pretty solid on this beer, unusual for such a mass-market beer, but to-be-expected for one of this quality. The head sticks around for the entire length of the brew.  Smell is nice, with a nice Sam Adams hoppiness mixed with a sort of caramel aroma on the nose. Sweetness and bitterness mix quite nicely on this brew to create an aroma that is quite distinctive -- I know of no other beer that smells quite like Sam Adams.  Taste is really fantastic, with a fairly simple start with a bare-bones flavor mixed with a very pleasant and tingly aftertaste of malts and hops. For me, the aftertaste is probably the most positive aspect of this brew -- it's very nice to drink this one slowly by itself and simply enjoy the flavors pass by.  Mouthfeel is solid if unremarkable -- a good solid medium-bodied brew with a good foamy head that produces a good mouthfeel. Nice to swish around in the mouth, and the beer isn't carbonated enough to make it unpleasant, but has enough kick to make itself known.  Overall drinkability is high -- the low ABV and really good taste of this could make it a perfect session beer. I've written this review off of a refrigerated-but-warmed bottle, but I actually prefer these straight from the cellar, almost to room temperature. The maltiness really kicks in as the beer warms, and the flavors become much more prominent. I think in the future I may not bother to refrigerate these at all, although it's a really solid beer either way.  The label claims that this is ""America's World-Class Beer"", and if we limit ourselves to macros and mid-sized breweries, I'd probably argue that the beer lives up to the hype. It's easy for us to belittle a beer like Sam Adams, but this is probably the best beer available in many restaurants and grocery stores, and is an excellent intro to good beer for the unitiated. Now that my tastes have adapted a bit, I'll probably make this an always-have in my beer closet. Quite possibly my favorite of the Sam Adams line -- only the Cream Stout even competes.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,ommegangpbr,3.41,"Drink by September 2005, as indicated by the little nick in the label. I never really dug this beer. There was always something about it that didn't quite resonate with me. I still feel that way but after trying all sorts of different brews I appreciate this one more than I used to. Probably in the top 10 of the super mass produced beers out there. Pours a pretty deep amber/gold color with a fluffy white head; not too shabby to look at. Smells slightly sweet.. sweet malts and perhaps a bit of floral hops. There's a roasted taste in this, almost burnt. Maybe this is what has bothered me about this beer over time. The burnt taste spills over into the mouthfeel. This may be better as-per-style than I am giving it credit for, but I am no beer guru... not yet anyway. As it stands this beer is a little busy for me; there is a nice complexity to be found and it makes for a good session brew, but this beer falls into a kind of limbo for me- it's not simple or straight-forward enough for more laid back situations, and not big or interesting enough when looking to sit back and savor a brew.

It has a nice brown light misty copper colour, with the carbonation bubbles sparkling through. I served me this beer in a 33cl Artois Pilsner glass. Taste: A very nice sparkling sensation, followed by a hefty deep caramel malty taste that ends in a sugary syrup and very remote signs of citrus and bitter. The aftertaste is very strong and long-lasting. A dry malty sensation keeps lingering on. Very creamy.  A very nice and surprising taste. I do like this one. Shame its so rare over here.

Anyway, I opened the bottle and sniffed the beer. It has a sweet, flowery aroma and I then poured a little into a clear glass. It pours a reddish-amber type color with a brownish head that stayed there for a long while. I then tasted it. Wow, my relatives were wrong! I liked the mellow, sweet taste of Sam Adams. The taste was kinda nutty in the middle of the sip, and left a clean, crisp bite at the end of it, and the aftertaste was a little hoppy, then mellowed a bit.

It is a wonderful mix of caramel, and some hoppy bitterness. Overall, the flavour is clean and crisp.  Mouthfeel: It is so smooth and creamy.

Taste/Mouthfell: The sip starts with a nice sweet malt flavor, and ends with some balancing hops. The mouthfell is a little thinner than medium.  Drinkability: This is a quality beer. Although it is not a great beer, it is refreshing and great to drink while watching baseball during the dog days of summer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,MurphyMacManus,4,"Appearance: Beautiful red-amber color with an off-white head. I could stare into this beer all day, or at least for as long as it takes me to drink it.  Smell: Smells clean and refreshing. Perfect warm weather beer.  Taste: Clean, crisp, well-balanced. Nice light hop note in the finish and good carbonation. I usually prefer ales to lagers, but this is one is an exception.  Mouthfeel: Nice and light, refreshing carbonation. This is one of those beers I would sit out on my porch and drink on a hot day.  Drinkability: Wonderful session beer. Quenches thirst without being overly filling.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bceaglejoe,3.88,"Presentation: Poured a medium-orange color into a traditional pint glass, with about a finger-thick head. Retention was very good. Cascading bubbles showed a moderate amount of carbonation. Mild floral hop aroma malt sweetness were present. I was grateful that the bartender did a good pour on this beer.  Tasting: This beer was well-balanced, with slight malt sweetness along with crisp hop bitterness. It had a slightly oily texture on the middle of the tongue, as well as a lightly-hopped aftertaste. This was a medium-bodied brew, and it went down smoothly and easily.  Sam Adams really hit the spot when I was just sitting at the bar, waiting for friends. I could drink this as a session beer or a fall-back beer. I recommend it for anyone looking to get into craft beer, as well as anyone who wants to enjoy a nice, easy drinking lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,cracgor,3.78,"I poured the Boston Lager into my favorite pint glass, allowing about a 2cm head to rise just above the lip of the glass. The head is impressive; with a thick cake-like texture that remained attached to the glass to the last drop of the beer. The color of the beer is appetizing, a light, golden shade.  All the foreplay aside, the beer is thirst quenching and very drinkable; the two qualities that stand out most. The malts of the beer outweigh the hops at first sip, but this seems reversed after swallowing. The two row malts are the first taste distinguished by my nose and tongue as I begin the drink. The aroma of the noble hops almost immediately follows as the beer moves around the interior of my mouth. The hops impart piney and citrus notes primarily. They remain in my taste long after swallowing the beer. The malts and hops are well balanced.  I enjoy this beer thoroughly. It is a regular choice of mine for meals of all types.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ypsifly,3.95,"Poured from a 24oz with a best before date of June '05, into a mug.  Clear amber with a small white head that falls to a thin veil inside a ring that leaves some lacing as I drink.  Mostly caramel and light hops in the nose. Not very complex, yet clean and balanced.  The taste is also a nice pair of hop and malt with a clean dry finish. The malt provides a good background for the hops to take center stage and linger after the finish.  Medium to light mouthfeel with just enough carbonation tingle to awaken my tastebuds. Goes down smooth and easy.  A great session beer that is easy to find. My favorite for dinner parties. Goes well with just about any meal.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,oxmasterscream,3.7,"Clear, ambered-golden topped by a crisp, white, frothy head. Smells purely of sweet malt. Just a hint of spicy noble hops and some honey. Taste is as the smell suggest - solidly malty and quite spicy on the tongue. Finishes extremely clean with just a twinge of bitterness. Mouth is medium-bodied and very carbonated. Slightly oily; just a bit slick on the tongue. Easy, tasty drinking but nothing too challenging for the senses.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,HappyHourHero,3.88,"Light, candied sweet fleshy fruit (apricotish) aroma with a pinch of floral hops. Small cream colored head fades quickly to a think film, but leaves a good deal of lace. Not quite transparent copper colored beer with very little carbonation activity. Mildly sweet caramel/butterscotch and toasted malt flavor is enjoyable and balanced by some mildly bitter hops midway though. The bitterness drops back towards the end and the original flavors make a faint reappearance. Body is moderately light, and the mouthfeel is a bit fizzy in the middle, but generally soft. Most of the Boston Lagers I've had were not too bad, but a few, including this bottle, have been really good. It's more miss then hit, but sometimes it just hits the spot.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jp32,4.05,"Pours a bright bronze color with an average sized head. It smells of very sweet, carmelized malts. Maybe also a bit of hops as well. The taste is nice also. Very rich and malty with a wonderful smooth, clean finish. Great tasting beer. The mouthfeel is great, almost a perfect amount of carbonation in this one. The smoothness and great taste makes it a highly drinkable beer. If this was the only kind of beer left in the whole world, I'd be disappointed, but not sad by any means. Very good beer, especially for its common availability.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,travolta,3.75,"Apperance: Clear, light golden apricot. head is white, frothy with lacing that sticks all the way.  Nose: Sweet carmel malt. Slight vanilla in the finish. Some lime.  Taste: Crisp, with some clear hops right away. The hops stays with you all the way through until the end and then vanishes. A little sweet in the middle, syrupy and a little malty. Carbonation sneaks up on you at the end, but it wakes your taste buds up a bit.  Notes: When all they have is Coors, Bud Light and Sam, ALWAYS grab a Sam. In my opinion this is the best, most reliable beer in the US. Great job Jim!!!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,charlatan,3.86,"24oz bottle with June freshness date.  Beer is amber with good head retention. The smell is very generic (think less offensive adjunct lager riff), but the taste is great for anything calling itself a lager (usually a sign of one-dimensionality in my book). Hops are rather understated, with some herbal tones coming from somewhere, and this balances excellently with some creamy malts. This is nothing fancy, but definitely a well crafted beer, and at 4.75% abv would make a great session brew.  Rarely does such a good beer shift so many units in this fine country America.

35,104,Truh,3.65,"Found myself in the hub of the universe with this one on 3/18/20005. 12-oz bottle poured in a shaker glass.  After initial down pillow, a loose jail break of carbonation flies out to a trace/trance of frost hoar. Light orange to amber hue and crystalline to the point of a razors edge. Somewhat wishy-wash of malt on nose with just a scratch of hop and wafting honey. Slight buttery malt flavor hits right off the bat with an afterthought of grapefruit-like hop. This would be a good session libation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,arguemaniac,4,"Appearance: Poured this one into a nice pilsner glass (instead of my usual pint glass). At first a nearly one and half inch creamy off-white head which very slowly dissipates down to a very thick white lace. A nice, slightly dark amber color with a very subtle copper hue.  Aroma: A dominating floral hop aroma, with some slight malt scents as well. Some citrus notes too. Also, a faint honey-like aroma.  Taste and Mouthfeel: A pretty heavy maltiness, quite nice and smooth though. While the hop flavors are comparatively light, it is still present enough to balance the beer very nicely. In other words, the above-average sweetness is balanced by the pleasant (but mild) bitterness. That honey-like characteristic is present in the taste as is the citrus. Some slight toffee flavor too. Mild hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is very easy and is medium bodied with carbonation to match. Very drinkable!  A very solid brew: its not overwhelmingly amazing but very, very good. A pleasantly malty brew that is balanced nicely by its mellow hop aroma and flavor. A very tasty brew that is not too much on the palate, and this combination makes it unusually drinkable. This would make a great beer to convert others to craft beer appreciation: it is widely available and is not too rich (which means those accustomed to flavorless macros wont be scared off by the taste of this one) and it is good enough to maybe, just maybe, open their eyes to a better world of beer. It may sound like Im getting a little carried away but I have used this particular beer to get a few of my friends turned on to craft beer! In any event, this is a slightly fantastic beer which I have returned to time and time again in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. Highly recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Vipsanius,3.21,"Had this on tap at a local bar while watching March Madness. Came with a nice one inch white head that stuck around a couple of minutes. The color was a little darker than your average lager.  The smell was of floral, hops and a little citrus. The taste was very unimpressive at first, but improved with each sip. Initially it's a sharp but not overpowering, hoppy, floral and slightly citrusy beginning. While most beers seem to fall apart after that, this subsided to bring out some subtle malty and sweet characteristics. Couldn't really pick out anything random or unique but still a better taste than most lagers.  The mouthfeel had a lot more weight to it than I was expecting. Initially, I thought it was going to be harsh but it turned out to be smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. I didn't think it would be very drinkable but four more later, that also proved to be wrong. Overall, this was a beer I'm glad I didn't trust my initial reaction to.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,wolf26,4.16,"I do not believe it is just to put this lager into a broad category such as ""Vienna"" or ""Premium Lager,"" instead it strattles the line between a fine pilsener and a rich viennna lager. Further, it is labled not by a classic style but by the rather ambiguous ""Boston Lager.""  Poured into a pint glass from a 24 oz. bottle, it gives a bright red-amber hue. Dense, dissapating head, tart fruity aroma. First taste gives rich slighty sweet, carmal malt tones, quicky backed by a bitter, very piney hops bouqet. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied for a lager.  Definitely, one of the more flavorful lagers I have ever tasted. Although it may not be as easily drinkable as some beers, it holds its place as an ""Old Standby.""",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,claytri,3.48,"The beer poured a nice clear golden with a pretty white head. The aroma was basic: some malt overcome by hops. The taste was also pretty standard, but showed quality. It had a slight malt start and quickly moved to a hops finish that was not overpowering. The feel was nice and light and had a bit of effervesence. I bought this today by default. I had gone to a restaurant and this was the only reasonable choice. I was happy and now feel I will have a reasonable choice in these situations in the future. I was having fish and chips and it set well against them. The hops gave a nice clarifying bite.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The beer is low on aroma, but it smells of caramel malts and floral hops. The flavors are caramel with spicy/floral hops that leave a nice bitterness. There is a hint of fruitiness in the aftertaste. Feels smooth on the palate with a medium body. This makes a great session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,clemtig76,4.42,"12 oz brown bottle. Good through July 2005. One of my all time favorite beers. This beer has one of the best aromas out there. The floral hops aroma is perfectly balanced by the malt. Pours a light copper color with a light white head. Taste - Excellent balance between the bitter hops and sweet malt. A good, sturdy beer like our grandfathers enjoyed. It may not be America's best lager, but is probably America's best lager that is readily available.

35,104,DrJay,4.1,"Bright, very clear, medium amber colour. The dense white head that made it to the table reduced to a thin head after a couple of minutes, but this lasted throughout the pint and ringed the glass all the way to the bottom. I was a bit surprised by the citrusy hop aroma, I don't remember it being that pronounced in the bottle (but it's been quite a while). There was also a light sweetness mingled with the crisp nose.  An orange/citrus hop flavour was prominent right from the start and was followed by a mellow caramel sweetness. Bitterness was well balanced considering the mild sweetness and hop flavour. The finish was on the dry side with a moderate citrus character. The body had some weight to it, though it remained on the light side, and the smooth texture and moderate carbonation gave it the lager crispness that I expected.  I was a little surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. It didn't make a huge impression on me years ago when I gave it a try, but it did this time.

35,104,Dithyramb,4.5,"Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle (okay, multiple ones, but whos counting?). Theyve changed the labeling several times over the years. This one is with the new Sam Adams character. During a tour of the brewery, we were told that the original character and subsequent ones arent really from original paintings of Sam Adams, but have been commissioned by Lord Jim.  Appearance: Pours an amber tinged gold with a rocky, creamy and frothy head. Lacing clings to the side all the way down.  Smell: This has one of the most pleasant beer aromas out there. You have a very sweet mix that invites you in, with a fine dose of floral hops and roast toasty malts.  Taste: The hops are initially and quickly sharp with an almost lime like acidity. However, delicate sweet malts and caramel smooth it out. Just touches of hop oils and sweetness lead to the fine finish. Mouthfeel is medium well. Well drinkable, even through the years and a varying taste.  Notes: By far the classic American micro. The quality of the beer has remained unchanged, even through phenomenal growth and the blitz of marketing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Gaisgeil,3.6,"A decent standby beer. Nothing too outlandish, not overly hoppy or malty, fairly well balanced with just the right amount of alcohol and carbonation to make it quite likable and tasty. This really is sort of a standard setting brew by which many are judged and rightfully so.  This really isn't something I drink a lot of, I'm not big on lagers in the first place though, so that probably has something to do with it. I can appreciate why so many like it and I definatly think it's just a good, well balanced all around nice brew and pretty easy to find, which certainly is a good sign for beerdom as a whole in my book. From a bottle it can tend to lean a little toward the too bitter side, but I've never experienced that having it on draft.

The smell is sweet with a nice hops bouquet. The taste is a good balance between malt and hops - neither one dominates the other. The finish is slightly bitter, a nice foil to the initial sweetness. There is also a hint of spice that adds some mystery to the experience. The overall taste is very crisp and refreshing.

Date is marked as February 2005.  Smell: a subtle floral hop aroma perhaps slightly piney. Appearance: White, lacy head consisting of tiny bubbles. Good head retention. Color is a light amber with a reddish hue.  Taste: Good balance of malt and hops. The aftertaste is that of lingering hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was medium.  Overall a good beer. Nothing special but it is found everywhere and can stand out at establishments with poor beer selections.

Darkest lager i've seen that wasn't actually a dark lager, pours with an appetizing white head w/ v. small bubbles that lasted half the glass. Beautiful sweet beer smell.

35,104,Illini5596,3.15,"While not overly impressive, Sam Adam's Boston Lager is a solid choice for your widely available American beers. I won't go out of my way to find it, but as it is often a staple in bars and at parties due to it's affordability, it may surprise you in it's quality.

It has the perfect color for a lager, dark but not to dark. The taste is what a beer should taste like. It is also a good beer to ahve with, lets say a hamburg, steak, and/or a salad. You can also cook with it, pour it over your burgers on the grill and it will add real flavor.

Its one of those beers that you don't have to think to much about it to enjoy it.  As far as the pour goes Samual Adams Boston Lager pours a nice amber color, if poured right it will leave a nice head of which you can float the bottle cap on it.  initially you should be able to taste the body and sweetness of the malt. This beer has real substance, it's not thin or watery. The sweet is followed up by some tartness, but has a very balanced flavor.

It was served in a tall pilsner glass with a nice, off white and creamy head on top of the golen hued beer. The aroma on this beer is nice and hoppy without being intimidating. The flavor is very good with an excellent balance of light malt flavor with floral hoppy flavor. The malt profile is not bready in nature, but more crisp and sweet. This is one of the better balanced beers out there. Very tasty with a soft, light to medium body. This is definately a great stand-by beer for places like Applebee's where they generally serve macro swill and don't tend to serve good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

The flavor is good as well, not overpowering or awe-inspiring but solid from start to finish with a clean maltiness, a solid backbone of bitterness at the end, some more of that noble hop flavor (again, kind of wood-like to me, hints of cedar and spicy minty) and a little bit of caramel. Good mouthfeel. Samuel Adams is kind of maligned in that they aren't really a micro, but they make a solid product that is way better than BudMillerCoors and the ""imports"" like Heinekin. It was definitely the best choice I had at the convenience store this past holiday weekend (Christmas 2004) (although the Yuengling lager was my 2nd choice as I have never had it before, the green bottles just keep me away.)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,FormatKid,3.88,"12oz single from my Holiday Sampler. Pours out with a body a perfect shade of amber similar to the Sam Light I had a few moments ago. The head is white, voluminous and robust. Im actually getting sheets of lace down the side of the glass and the head retention is pretty great as well. The nose is sweet toffee and biscuity malts with a faint sprinkling of earthy bitterness about the edges. As I swallow the first thing I notice is this is quiet a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Nice round toffee flavors up front accompanied by a mild fruitiness, the middle is grainy (in a good way) and is eventually accompanied by a well-balanced earthen bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is light, but has quiet a bit more body than your typical Pale Lager. A great, well rounded beer, flavorful and with nice session appeal.

35,104,BigRedN,3.83,"Consumed in comparison with a Dos Equis Amber lager (also a Vienna Lager).  Appearance: Darker amber (orangish/brown hue). Good head, about 1/2 inch, lasting until midway through the beer. Lacing in the glass until the finish.  Smell: Malty sweetness noticed, a hint of roasted chocolate. Faint tinge of hops noticed (although subtle, and right after pouring).  Taste: The malty sweetness is noticeable, but is balance by a bit of hop at the finish. Flavor of caramel, chocolate and something else sweet and nutty (almonds?). I seem to taste almonds with malty beers, I wonder why?  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, carbonated.  Drinkability: Very enjoyable, I had forgotten how good this beer is, and I can see why it is so popular, worlds better than BMC.  Final thoughts: I seem to remember this beer as being more robust in flavor, and felt that this has been toned down (its probably been almost a year since I have had ANY Sam Adams products). A very good beer nonetheless. I forgot how mush I missed this, thanks to Scott, my college roomate who introduced me to this in the Fall of '95, and turned me on to better beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pours a very clear deep pale pumpkin orange color. Very carbonated for the style. Head is thick, white, and surprisingly long lasting. Clings to the side of the mug nicely. Taste is good. I can honestly say that this macro lager tastes better than some (repeat: SOME) of the craft lagers I've had. It shouldn't win any best of show awards either, but the fact that it is a decent beer in a market of fizzy yellow beers is something of merit. Quite sweet, hops are subtle, there are certainly no bold Czech hops here. Strawlike and sweet, then dry on the aftertaste.

35,104,allengarvin,3.63,"Appearance: Crystal-clear amber color, fine bubbles, small head but nice head retention.  Aroma: Sweet malt, with slightly peppery hop aroma.  Flavor: Malt is the main flavor, slightly sweet, slightly grainy. Hop bitterness is medium low but provides some good balance, along with some spicy taste. Finish is clean, with enough hop dryness to make it interesting.  Body: Creamy mouthfeel, with medium carbonation.  Notes: As many beer fans say, this isn't an interesting enough beer to drink if there's a choice of micros, but it's not bad and at many bars where it's the only ""choice"", it can be quite a nice brew to have now and then.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bearrunner44,4.1,"Out of all the beers that can be found in the average grocery store, this one is my favorite. It shouldn't even be compared to watery macrobrews like Budweiser and MGD- it's several steps above them with both the strength and the quality of it's flavor. The difference is clear as soon as the cap comes off the bottle. The drinker is greeted with a pleasant, malty aroma as soon as it's opened. The taste is smooth and a little sweet at first, followed by a hint of dry bitterness when swallowed. The body is very full and malty. It has alot of taste, but it's also very drinkable- a great stepping stone into the world of better beers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,niknar,3.6,"This is the beer that started it all for me... an introduction to the wider world of ""real"" beer that we all celebrate as BAs!  Pours out an orange color with very good clarity and a pretty decent off-white head. Retention is pretty good and the head leaves a little lacing down the side of the glass. Aroma is pleasantly fruity with hints of sweet malt as well. Taste is a nice balance between malty sweetness and a fairly decent helping of hops in the middle. Finishes a semi-dry with hop bitterness lingering. Very good overall. Mouthfeel is a tiny bit thin due to notable carbonation, but still very pleasant. Drinkability is probably the strongest suit for this offering: well balanced and flavorful without going overboard in any particular area. This is an excellent beer that opened my eyes to a wider world many years ago. Probably never going to make the top of the lists, but a solid beer for any occasion and worthy of a place in your refridgerator!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,alexAK,3.83,Pours a deep amber with a slight touch of honey. Head retention is solid.  Presents just about everything I'd expect to see in a good solid lager. Hops are pronounced but well balanced and help promote the smooth mouthfeal. Perhaps not exceptional but I expect to see this in my fridge quite often.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,orbitalr0x,3.62,"Pours a nice deep amber orange with a nice 1"" fluffy white head. Shiny and clear. Smell is a sweet caramel with some grain notes and a smattering of floral hops. Nice, but nothing to write home about.  First sip has a nice nutty caramel flavor with subtle hints of flowery hop biterness on the back of the palate. A somewhat grainy flavor rides through there as well.  Mouthfeel is nice and easy to drink...a bit thin but that's to be expected. Drinkability is good here as this is a decent brew that is widely available and beats the hell out of the major macro choices.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,aquatonex,3.05,"I'm trying very hard to rate this for style because, apparently, I really don't enjoy lagers...  Pours medium golden, nice hue, looks a bit pissy though. Insane amount of carbonation with a huge foamy head, good retention. After being attacked by bubbles, the taste is dominated by bitter hops and a little bit of toasted notes. At the end, the bitterness lingers as does the carbonation. As with all the Sams I've had, a helluva decent beer for such a large brewery. But, I wouldn't get it again until I start to like this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Hagbard,3.8,"Pours a light golden color, which is very clear. Light shoots through the beer without any problem. A fairly thick rolling white head forms as the swirling carbonation rushes to the surface. A nice flowery aroma wafts up gently from the glass. A firm maltiness is shoulder to shoulder with the hops aroma. The hops embrace your tongue immediately, but quickly take a back seat to the semisweet maltiness. Now there's a slight caramel taste. This bit of sweetness fades into a nicely hopped finish, which is softly bitter. The aftertaste is refreshingly dry and on the bitter side. This is an easy drinking lager that will always have a special place in my heart. It's not the best beer out there, but like so many others, it was the first craft beer I ever drank regularly. For that, I'll always appreciate it and there will always be room for it in my fridge. It doesn't hurt that it's very tasty!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Quite often it's the only thing besides BMC you can find around here on tap being a ""Get people drunk for cheap and make them gamble away their savings"" city unless you hit the micro breweries.  Fills the glass with a copper colored liquid that foams up and forms a nice 1"" creamy head. Sticks to the glass and doesn't let go.  Smell is of sweet malt, caramel and a bit of flowery hop.  Taste is nice and malty, with a good amount of hops to pull it all together. Hop profile reminds me of a lighter SNPA.  Mouthfeel is great, a bit creamy but still refreshing like a lager and it pairs very well with the pizza I had.  Boston Lager is a very nice brew and is definately one I will need to start having around again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SCW,3.51,"I first started drinking this beer when I was 15 years old. I remember ordering it when I would go out to eat with my parents at Uno's restaurant. I have not had it almost nine years now... and it tastes a lot different than I remember.   First of all, the aroma seems lacking. I remember it having a really distinct aroma presence... and I can tell you as a professional brewer, one of the easiest ways a brewery can cut corners and save money is to cut down on the amount of aroma hops they use. I can't tell if this brewery has taken this route, but the aroma seems to be lacking.  The taste is pretty good. I thought I detected DMS in the beginning, but as I tasted some more, it seemed to fade.  The beer was full-bodied for a vienna-style lager. It worked quite well with the generous contribution of flavor hops.  Overall this is a pretty drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,WetCoaster,3.83,"For my 100th review, I thought I'd revisit the beer that started it all for me (and probably many BAs, for that matter) -- the classic Samuel Adams Boston Lager. It's been a WHILE since I've had one, so I'm curious to see how it holds up.  Appearance: A light amber/deep honey (what happened to that trademark deep orange hue?) with a dense, pure white head. Fair retention. Champagne-fine, super active carbonation. Leaves lace on the glass and a collar throughout.  Smell: Hmmm--much milder than I remembered. The first scent is an almost-pilsner, possibly Saaz hop spice. As it warms, a caramel maltiness emerges, as does a faint flowery/citrus fragrance.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Slightly malty up front with a hint of chocolate that I didn't remember it having. It's a bit macro-grainy midpalette, but finishes with a bitter, hoppy bite. Clean, dry aftertaste. The Mouthfeel is soft, slightly coating, a bit light and finishes crisp with a zing of carbonation.  Drinkability: Among the best; consistent, flavorful, fairly light, almost always available and usually wallet-friendly--it's sort of this generation's Michelob, I suppose.  That said, I was a bit surprised at how... small this beer seems. I don't know if it's been dumbed-down over the years or I've just gotten used to bigger beers, but it's not the powerhouse I remember it being. It's still a good beer--great on tap, IMHO--and if nothing else, it did ween a lot of people, myself included, off the macro swill and onto bigger and much better things. That ought to count for something.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mgdeth,4.3,"Appearance - Notched for purchase before Feb. 2005. I made a mess on my table with the pour - nice thick white head that lingers. The beer is clear, and is a light amber or ever-so-slightly-orange color.  Smell - Nice malty aroma. I do not detect any hop smell. This has a characteristic ""lager beer"" smell as well.  Taste - Malty and very smooth. However, this beer packs a good amount of flavor. Clean and crisp. I might also detect some subtle hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Whether or not this is appropriate to style, I really enjoy it.  Mouthfeel - Light mouthfeel, but not at all watery. This beer puts most other mass-produced beer to shame.  Drinkability - Very drinkable. This beer goes down very smoothly, and the flavor is not cloying or overpowering.  Comments - This beer may have gone through some changes over the years, but in my opinion it is still a great brew. This beer is on my ""can-always-go-to"" list.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,RushLimbmalt,5,"The famous BBC's Boston Lager is truly a classic beer. I do remember it being a lot heartier in the old days, but maybe it is just my palate that has changed. Either way, I revisit it often and enjoy the beer immensely. It pours a nice amber color and has the trademark thick foamy head that you can float a bottle cap on. The aroma is a truly great mix of noble hops, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, and wonderful sweet and malty. The flavor is every bit as good as the aroma and the floral hoppiness is in the forefront and the heavy sweet malty backbone melds the experience into a mind blowing taste nirvana... Ok, maybe that is going too far, but I love this beer and hold it dear to my heart, even though it has become a tad cliche. Once again I thank Jim Koch and the BBC.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

I can't agree that I think the BBC are dumbing down there beers, because they all still taste great to me! Boston Lager is a nice reddish amber colour, with a pretty vigurous head that sticks around for quite a while. This smells wonderfully of malts and hops and tastes just like an American lager should taste. The hops and malts just blend in a perfect unison in this brew!

35,104,mynie,4.31,"Edit:  My old review was a decade out of date. This is an excellently brewed beer and a fantastic window into a simpler time, when balance was appreciated. It's not otherworldly, but it's great. **** The American TV ads for this beer are annoying and do nothing but reinforce the ""my beer-cock is bigger than your beer-cock"" stigma that I, as a person who loves beer but hates American macros, do not like to live with. When you drink, I dunno, Heiniken or Corona, you are being fancy. I guess I can live with that. When you drink a micro or import that no one has ever heard of, you are being weird. I can certainly live with being weird. But when you drink Sam Adams you are being snooty, at least in the eyes of the people around you.  But despite the stigma, the yuppies, the embarrassing ads, and everything else, this is still a very good beer. Pours a rich amber color with a nice head and good retention. Smells bittersweet, not a very strong odor.  Great bitter taste mixed with a sweet malt. Actually a pretty complex flaovor.

Mouthfeel-those who are fans of lesser hops shouldn't drink this but as for me I loved it when it lingered in my mouth and it went down smooth.  Drinkability-it's expensive but good, not a beer for chugging but a beer to enjoy slowly and nicely, so be good to it.  Overall- a fine American beer what more can I say that hasn't already been said, plenty of hops, more complex than most others in it's class and it goes down well, perhaps a bit expensive but defintiely a good choice for any occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,SilentSabre,3.78,"I have had this several times before, but simply never thought to rate it. It pours an orange amber like colour with a snow white head that quickly subsides into only a ring of lace. Laces the glass beautifully. The smell is bit too hoppy for me, as I do not care for the hoppy smell or taste. The taste is very nice. For what it is, anyway. It certainly isn't earth-shattering amazing, and it definately isn't anything close to awful. It's just good. A great beer to sit down with and drink four or five. Perhaps more. The taste has an ""allowable"" (to me) amount of hoppiness. Nice balance. There is a nice, almost dry, maltiness at the finish that I really enjoy. I would have to say this and the SA Light is to me what, dare I say, Bud and MGD are to most everyone else in the USA.

Finished not horribly with a nice hop taste but still stale and bland. I think it could be a lot fuller in the mouth. The thing that makes this beer better than most is it's very available, and compared to what else is available where Sam Adams usually is.

Hops become noticeable late in the swallow and dominate the aftertaste. The malts are having a little trouble getting any attention here.

35,104,Tang07,4.1,"Sam Adams pours quite well from a bottle; rich copper color, sturdy head and leaves a well laced glass.  The smell is very nice; hoppy with a backbone of malt.  The initial taste is a nice bitter hopp followed by malt and the hoppieness lingers nicely on the back of the tongue.  This is one of the best big microbrew lagers. Definitely one of my favorite lagers. Probably my favorite domestly produced lager. When I opt for a darker beer I usually opt for an ale, but this is something which is nice if I'm in the mood for something lighter or it's often the best beer that is on tap at a chain type restaurant.  I will have to write a separate review for the tap version next time I have it.  It is a nice beer that can be consumed often. Sam Adams can be enjoyed in larger quanitiies because it has a lower ABV and is lighter in calories than many of the beers I consume.  If you like beer with flavor you will like this beer. If you are the target of the Keystone Light ""skunky/bitter beer"" comercials. You probably won't like this beer.

Flavor is reminiscent of Aromatic and Munich malts with a nice spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel has an average appeal as the carbonation lends a sharper flavor while maintaining a thick head.

Taste  The hops were more prominent at the taste. The malt backbone came out quite nicely as well.

Appearance is a dark orange amber. Rocky and sticky head with really nice lacings that stay.  This brew smells sweet and has an attractive overall scent. Nice aroma.  Taste is clearly sweet, malty and balanced. Sweet up front and slighty bitter on the finish.  This beer is a staple on many accounts. It works well with many food pairings and can be a session beer for the night as well. Its availibility is plentiful around the Boston area. Many times this beer will compete with all of the major macros in bars and when thats the case, this is usually a solid choice.

Aromas of strawberries, caramel, biscuity and honey malts are apparent, with a light hoppy and floral finish.  Taste is definitely lagerish, but it has a lasting sour and bitter finish.

Although at the time I thought that advertisers paying good $$$ to advertise a yet-not-so-national brand of craft brew that I enjoyed was truly revolutionary, I must say that though I don't hold Sam Adams Boston Lager in the exact same sacred place I once did (maybe my taste buds have changed; perhaps I've simply tried too many other beers in the interim), but this is still well-made beer, with the integrity it had all along.  Appearance: Strong gold, with a flourishing head which sustained throughout. Smell: Floral hop aroma (still using the old German Hallertauer perhaps?) Taste: A little grainy malt flavor, but not bad. Balanced well with a decent bittering hop. Mouthfeel: About as solid as I'd remembered it being. Good, not over-the-top sustaining feel, but definitely better than any mainstream, light-as-a-lark beer. Drinkability: The perfect BBQ beer. A great beer to enjoy on a warm summer's evening with friends.  This isn't my favorite SA beer, but as I've been drinking this well-nigh 15 years it still proves itself as a very good beer, beating most competitors, especially in comparitive pricing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DPMomutant,4.1,"Pours out a medium amber color, very clear and clean body. One finger head, not much there. Does look like some is trying to stick to the side of the glass.  A pretty light smell of hops and just a touch heavier of the malt. Compared to most lagers the best description I can give of the smell is 'fresher' (10/04 freshness date).  The hops are subtle but tasteable. The malt comes out some in the middle. It is not aggressive, but has character.  Good even carbonation in the mouth. Moderate consistency in the body. The finish is smooth with only a hint of hop bitterness.  I've occasionally kicked back with a 6er of this and enjoyed it and probably still could. Easy to drink and not hard on the head and pretty good to boot.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bignick,3.78,"This is a all-around solid beer. It is a beer that is both enjoyed by fans of micorbrewed beer and macrobrewed beer, and this is for good reason.  It pours a copper color, with a smallish head, but one that has good retention. The aroma is floral. The beer itself is well balanced, with the maltiness and the hoppiness complimenting each other. The one quality that defines this beer is its crispness. It holds up to any food and is an all-occasions beer. The one gripe I have with this lager is that it goes down a bit harsh. Overall it is one of the best mass-produced beers.  Samuel Adams Lager lacks excitement, but it is a good beer that always delivers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,lokicat444,4.2,"Appearance: A muted orangish brown, with a solid layer of head. The color nicely parallels the solidness of the beer as a whole.  I don't know how to describe the taste and smell of Sam Adams except to say that.. they're uniquely Sam Adams. The taste impact is hugely satisfying, and other lagers seem dull in comparison. Slightly bitter but by no means unpleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is just right, neither watery or too thick- perfect for having more than one. Drinkability is excellent- the perfect session beer, since it's cheap in bottles and on-tap everywhere. I find myself ordering at dinner whenever I can't find any other interesting new brews to try.  Bottomline: this is the beer that got me to start liking beer. Perhaps I'm emotionally biased towards SA, but I really think its taste and balance are outstanding.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Ricochet,3.95,"It's rare that I buy this beer because when I want a microbrew, I go to a microbrewery or living in Cleveland, I buy Great Lakes. Every now and then, I'll buy it with dinner.  Red Lobster. No foam, full imperial quart, and ice cold from the tap. It's orange to red and with the first sip, a great microbrew flavor , with a light bitterness. It's a little thin in texture and goes down missing some of the extra taste notes that really mean microbrew to me. Actually, this beer probably got me hooked on Pale Ales and being a hophead.  When I first tried this beer, it introduced me to Micros and a whole other world of tastes to love beer for. It's still a good introduction to ""better than American lagers"". A good beverage when in the restaurant and all they have are lites and Bud.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,tjd25,3.49,"A soft fluffly head, with huge irregular bubbles. A nice although transparent copper color. The smell is nice, round dark malts and caramel with some hints of red fruits. The highlight of this beer. The taste is enjoyably malty, caramelized, almost chocolatywith some fruity flavors. The mouthfeel is decent for a lager, a bit creamy, not overly watery with a lasting hoppiness. Maybe not that drinkable, because of the citric grassy hoppiness. My first impression was definitely better than the one I have after finishing the glass.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Hunter,3.62,"Finally got around to reviewing this one, although who hasn't tried it numerous times?  Beer poured a remarkably clear light copper color, with a shock-head head that vanishes quickly. Little carbonation.  A straight up blend of caramel malt and hops in the nose. Direct and unassuming.  The taste backs up the smell. Hops hit the tongue first, are swept up by a short rush of malt, and then reappear on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth with neither the astringency of hops/carbonation nor the cloying feel of malt.  This brew is all about solid beer making, perfectly balanced without bells and whistles. Availability in even the most remote corners makes it a good fallback beer when you'd otherwise be staring at a night of Bud/Bud Light.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

My lips quivered in anticipation as the bottle was placed before me. ""Um, excuse me, could I please have a glass?"" Anyway, welcome back to America!  Pours a slightly amber gold under a one finger off-white head that lingered well and produced some nice lace. The nose is a lovely combination of sweet malt and a crisp hoppy nose. Yeah, that's what Russian beers lack! The mouth is prickly, light and smooth. The taste presents a lovely chorus of malt and crisp hops, slightly sweet in the opening, solid flowery hop bitterness soon thereafter. Throughout, an excellent balance of sweet and bitter. The aftertaste lingers long with a hint of sweet amidst the bitterness. Oh, this is good.

There was virtually no head on this but the color was very nice. Nice crisp aroma. The taste to me just doesn't seem like a lager. Say what you will, but I honestly think this beer tastes similar to a pale ale, not a lager. Overall, this is a great mass-produced beer (one of the finest to be exact), and does the job when you find yourself in the midst of a macro swill swamp.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Aroma was kind of generic beer - light malts and hops aroma. Taste was as well somewhat generic, nothing bad, but nothing much stood out either. Mouthfeel was good, and drinkability was excellent, you could drink a bunch of it, but knocked down a bit because it may get somewhat monotonous. Sam Adams needs to add a little more excitement into this one...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,slitherySOB,3.95,"Now this is what a macro lager should be. Mass produced, but still a quality beer. This is a great session beer. One anybody can pound back while playing poker or pool. Anyways, Sam Adams poured a semigloss, almost dark orange. Wasn't really red, but it was nice. Head wasn't big, maybe 1/2 finger, but it stayed and it left alot of lace. Balanced smell leading towards sweet. Good dose of malt, bread, bit of hops to add a kick to the aroma. It was more of what I didn't smell that impressed me. No corn, no rice, no sugar. Ahh, what a taste. Light sweetness, with enough bittering hops to balance and let you know this is not an alcopop, this is a beer. Aftertaste is lightly sweeter, followed by a pleasant sourness. Excellent mouthfeel. It goes down easy, crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable, but with one flaw. Perhaps this only affects me this way, but for every Boston lager I drink, I let out one burp. I have to let it down a half point for that. Sorry.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,yemenmocha,4.89,"One of the most underappreciated beers out there. This bottled version pours an autumn gold color, very deep gold. Impressive white head that retains well.  Aroma is on the floral hoppy side, but it doesn't suggest that the beer is for hopheads, nor does it scare away the hop-newbies. This beer is about balance, and the aroma achieves this admirably. The hoppiness has a pleasant steel-y metallic aroma, along with fresh bread notes in the mix, maybe even biscuits. On a hot day this is one of the most appetizing beers I reach for.  On the palate this beer welcomes you warmly with that vienna style maltiness, light caramel, but wait, the hops assert themselves to compliment the malty character... leaving you to focus on the oily hops, but then there's the malt again... and so on. I detect a citrusy character as well, but more floral and pleasant metallic flavors.  Medium to full bodied Vienna style lager. Good body, but still refreshing and drinkable. The best of both worlds. This is a beer you can savor and contemplate, but also enjoy regularly with good availability. This is probably the best domestic craft beer in the vienna lager category, hands down.  Beer Snobs, please set aside your elitism and look at this beer for what it is, despite its near ""macro"" status today.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,JimsArcade,2.55,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager pours a clear amber into a pint glass with about a one-finger head. No lacing is left on the glass and the head settles into a moderate layer mix of tight and course bubbles.  There is a fruitiness to the aroma. Peach seems to be the dominant smell. The aroma is non-existent when brought into the mouth.  The first taste is somewhat below average. Malt, minimal hops and a bit of skunk are present, but the beer has not gone bad. The carbonation level is below-average, but remains constant throughout. The malt and hop characteristics increase slightly as the beer warms mid-bottle, as expected. The beer finishes relatively unchanged.  Poured into a glass, Boston Lager weaknesses become apparent. In such a serving it is an average beer at best. This seems to be a beer that is designed to be drunk from the bottle, which is fine in a club but not in a more relaxed setting.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It had a half inch head that quickly dissapated to a light foam around the glass, the foam stuck to the sides of the glass throughout the drink.  The smell was slightly nutty and very spicy. Enough spice that I had to let it warm slightly to really notice the nutty tones.  The drink starts with a light kick of nuts followed by a medium hop spice kick. It finished with more hops and left a light nutty flavor on the palate.  This is a very refreshing beer that I will buy again.

The flavor comes largely from roasted malt, not overly sweet but full flavored.A slightly metallic overtone.  The finish is clean, slightly nutty and ultimately refreshing. This is really a good session brew. Plus it tends to be a good pick in airports with limited selection.

And though it has as much character as a Vienna lager, it really doesn't look as rich as one. This is an accomplishment, to me, because I think they've taken a barebones lager, made it delicious, and made us think it was something more than what it is. Really a fantastic session beer.

The taste however is a different story, taste is perfect mixture of malts and hops and a sweet and bitter ( good bitter) rear. Feels very dry but full and crisp in the mouth.

Aroma is the low point, with a malty grain nose, and a hint of pine hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a very pleasant feel of pine hops in the back of the mouth, toward the finish, that earns good marks here. Taste is well balanced, dominated by a caramel malt taste, some grain, a bit of pine cone, and even a hint of grapefruit.

There's plenty of toasted, biscuity malt and maybe even a hint of orange peel. The flavor profile is interesting from beer entry to beer exit and the finish lingers.

Smell is big beautiful leafy hops - a bit spicy and a bit earthy. Diacetyl rounds out the aroma along with a slight sweet graininess too. Taste seems so simple, but so great. All of the flavors meld perfectly and the fresh hoppiness slowly fades for a wonderful finish that requires you to take another drink.

There is, and it's called Samuel Adams Boston Lager.  I have to admit, the numerous TV spots gave me a negative impression right off the bat. I figured that it was just another overpriced and overhyped ""trendy"" beer like Corona or Heikeken. Boy, was I wrong. This shatters all my ideas of what a ""premium"" American beer can be. I thought Sierra Nevada was the only exception to the rule, but Samuel Adams proves to be a very satisfying beer that's easy to find on the shelf or on tap.  This beer almost says audibly, ""drink me."" It's a golden amber, with perhaps a slight hint of red. An almost white head that slowly disperses to a film immediately separates this from the American macros that surround it at the local pub. The taste is excellent. What more can I say? From start to finish, there is a good balance of malt and hop flavors. The bitter hops become a bit more dominant in the aftertaste, but just barely. This is a very drinkable brew, and definitely a good candidate for a session beer. I'm far from a true connoiseur, but I think that anyone can appreciate this beer, especially considering that it is an American macro (at least, it seems to be a macro, based on availability).

35,104,rajendra82,3.63,"A viable alternative to macro lagers, as it is sold everywhere. Spicy hop aroma is distinct but not overpowering. Pale golden body is a bit thin, but mouthfeel improves substantially as the beer warms from the sub arctic temperature range. Aroma is faintly hoppy. This was my first entry many years ago into the wider world of beers beyond macro swill. It remains a solid lager, but has lost much of its exotic appeal. Something like this is what the major american beer companies should have been producing all along, but they sold out their conscience to the bottom line.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,wsouloa,3.38,This is a very good beer. Its appearance is an amber almost copperish color. The smell is not overpowering but you can detect a hint of caramel which is very detectable in the taste as well as a malty flavor. It has a bitter finish. I always seem to like this beer more with food. Its one of the best beers that is easily available to general US drinking population.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kwalters,3.8,"Leaping lagers, this is a good beer! I'm not usually big into lagers, but this brew is very fine indeed.  It has a great, sharp scent which is accompanied by a slighlty hoppy bite in taste. There's also a noticeable amount of malty flavor. This is just a very reasonably priced, easy to find, good beer. What more needs to be said?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,pheurton,4,"chesnut brown with a creamy white head, which does a good job of sticking to the glass. european noble hop aroma. full bodied for a lager, very smooth with a nice level of carbonation. toasted full grain flavor supremely balanced with a tobacco leaf, earthy hop bite. very well constructed. nice lingering earthy hop aftertaste, i have no problem putting down three or four of these in a row. without a doubt the most full bodied and flavorful mass produced american lager on the market, and is often an oasis in a desert of macro piss at establishments that do not take their beer seriously. how could you not like this stuff?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,AllThingsNinja,3.83,"I sampled this beer fresh on tap at the Jamaica Plain Brewery. While its amber appearance and pleasant white lace are usually attractive, I'm never really impressed by the beer. This tasting was no different. The hops bouquet provides an interesting compliment to the flavors imparted by the lager yeast, but I continue to find the malt contributions to be rather bland. I tend to prefer the Mexican interpretations of the Amber Lager. The beer is quite drinkable, but rather unremarkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Dukeofearl,3.93,"Appearance: A nice-looking copper-golden color with a slight red glow, translucent with minimal carbonation and a slight head. Aroma: a pleasing, but simple armoa- nothing striking stands out. The taste is a nice, smooth floavor of malt, with a lesser (but nicely balanced) hops flavor towards the end. Alcohol is barely noticeable. A very drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,PartyHatjo,3.46,"This is a good-looking beer. It pours an amber color with a light tan head that laces nicely. There is a caramel maltiness present in the nose, as well as slight citrus/floral notes from the hops. The taste is a bit biscuity with a slight malt sweetness which is balanced well with the bitterness from the hops. Higher hopped than most lagers, but not as tasty as their Boston Ale. This lager has more body than most with just the right amount of carbonation to make it refreshing to drink in the summertime.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JCBears,3.93,Appearance: A nice rich amber that boasts well for what I'm about to drink nice soft lacy head  Aroma: strong smell of cooked vegies and a nice ting of sweetness  Smooth veggie taste and almost no bight I like it  Mouthfeel: thick yet not overly rich a well reounded brew  Overall: A great drinking expirieance one with smooth characters and a full body a stout strong beer with a backbone,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,palma,4.18,"This is always my fall back beer in a restaurant. Plus, the complex taste always surprises you if you haven't drank one of these in a while. Light orange/tan body that is crystal clear. Great off white foamy head that lasts and sticks to the glass very well. Aroma is of light hops with some spice and light caramel malt. Taste is very complex and full bodied with a good hop bitterness throughout. Light malt flavors and slight citrus notes. A metallic character as well. Mouthfeel is good with a nice thickness for a lager but at the same time also very crisp and refreshing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Stimack,4,"Ok, well I can say that out of the micro brew craze that firts hit a number of years ago this was the brew that I associated with it. When at college it was always a pleasure to be able to sit back and enjoy a Sam Adams, it was liquid gold compared to the Naty and Beast Ice we normally could afford!  With this being said I have somewhat forgotten about this classic with all of the other choices out on the market. With this being said, I know that if I get the Boston Lager I am not going to be disappointed.  The brew pours to a beautiful color of deep amber usually with a nice off white head. The smell is nice, a little light maybe but does have a malty smell to it. The taste is very nice, not overwhelming in any area but you can defiantly notice malt and then a slight hop bite that goes nice together, a perfect balance. Has perfect amount of carbonation and is just a very nice beer overall. This is a beer that can be had anytime of the year and will always be a old standby!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,alexgash,3.73,"Pretty much a legend/classic in the craft brew world I suppose. Pours a light copper with a sticky white head. Smells of fruity malts with spicy, lemony hops. Taste is nice lightly toasted malt with a touch of sweetness. Lemony hops lead into a moderately bitter finish. More body than almost all other pale lagers (more hops too), but still smooth and very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,scottum,3,"From the new brewer's 12pack. I replaced the Sam Lights with Scotch Ales, and one of the Boston Lagers with Stock Ale, but I guess I missed this one. Oh well, I hadn't reviewed it yet anyway.  Pours out amber with a vrey short quikly gone head. A so-so beer in my opinion. Meh. Drinkable, which is a plus in macro land, but nothing I'd ever buy for myself.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,TastyTaste,3.73,"A copper color that is not very indicative of a lager. Small white head. Not too much of a nose, faint hops, if anything. Full malty flavor, with a smooth finish. Another solid beer from Sam Adam's. A good lager, but not interesting enough to consider buying again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kbub6f,3.98,"Medium-sized, cream-colored foamy head leaves thickish swoops of lacing above an orange/amber beer. Tangy, nutty nose. Malty, fresh front with some mild chocolate. Full, but light-tasting middle. Some chocolate malt. Toasty, roasty grains in the nicely bitter finish. This is just a tasty, fresh, light, amber lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Foxman,3.83,"It pours a clear, crisp amber, with a quick-forming off-white head, that retains its creamy texture nicely. It laces prettily down the glass.  The aroma delivers a nice waft of mellowly sweet malt, evened by a just as mellow swirl of citrus from the hops. A caramel note lingers along the beer's aura, intertwining with the fruitiness of the hops.  The flavor is all about a refreshingly adroit balance. The slightly chewy malt sweetness carries with it the anticipated caramel character. The hops blend balances the malt with a subdued but quite present citrus wash. There's a very slight yeast sourness near the end, with the bittering hops starring at the finish.  It's on the light side of medium bodied, but in combo with the flavor, the lesser consistency is a fair plus. It coats and fades quickly, but it does not let itself be forgotten.  Too many seem to poo-poo this beer. With a nicely balanced, refreshing flavor, the overall effect determines the beer's exceptional drinkabilty. While perhaps not a standout in any one category, Sam is a fine standby, and a long-lived companion. There may be times when I'll daringly pick something else from an establishment's beer menu, but when I want to fall back to something I know I'll enjoy, I know I can never go wrong if I choose this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeefyMee,4.4,"Appearance: Amber with a reddish tint. A good size head that left a good amount of lacing.  Taste: I was shocked at first sip. I don't remember Sam Adams being this good; I always thought it was just slightly above mediocre. This is very good. It's smooth and modestly malty with an agreeable hop bite. Much more flavorful than I was expecting. The aftertaste brings back memories of something but I can't remember what.  Mouthfeel: This is the part that surprised me the most. It's so damn creamy. I love it!  Drinkability: All night.  I don't know why, but this is the best bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager that I've ever had. It's even better than the ones I've had on tap. I'll definitely have to get some more in the near future.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,GeoffFromSJ,4.43,"I had this on tap at a hotel in Boston. I was not expecting this to be this good. Maybe it was incredibly fresh. Either way, this was really good.  It looked really good. Beautiful color with a nice frothy head which lasted with a nice lace for a while. It taste was incredibly smooth. However, I'm torn about what to give it. This beer tasted really fresh and smooth. But it wasn't very complex. I'm not sure it warrants a 4.5, but at the same time, I cannot justify giving the beer a 4.  I don't expect this beer to be this good when I order it in the future, but I will always remember this time I had it with fondness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JackTheRipper,4.05,"ok, I've been drinking Sam Adams for years, now, but now that I have a bit more knowledge than before, here goes.  Appearance: pours an amber color, very clear, with a great head. Leaves a nice amount of lacing on my glass.  Smell: Grapefruit. Is that caramel? The biggest thing I smell is the citrusy smells.  Taste: Nice balance of bitterness and sweetness.  Drinkability: There's been a few Sam Adams in my fridge for a long time. This is a really good beer that I don't have to make a special trip to get. Solid offering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,avylover,3.21,"Pours out clear orange-golden with a massive white head. Slight citrus hop aroma, along with a faint maltiness. Taste is a good mix of sweet malts and bitter hops, which seem to hit the taste buds all at once. There is a slight powdered sugar overtone here, sort of an artificial sweetness, yet it is not bad in any way. Mouthfeel is very slick and finishes slightly syrupy. For whatever reasons I find this not too drinkable - nothing i'd want to pound all night. A decent and fairly unique lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Dubblebock,4.1,"The Sammy Adams Boston Lager is one of those beers that I kind of take for granted, and as such, I don't drink it as often as I should (or would like to). Unless it's on sale (as it is now at my local grocery store, @ $4.49/sixer), I don't normally pick it up. But when I do grab a sixer, it's always like hooking up with that old college friend whose company you truly enjoy, but you never seem to have enough time for. I love drinking it, and I make plans to drink it again soon, but other things just keep grabbing my attention, and it takes something like a sale or a wild hair to bring me back. Shame, though. It is a really splendid American lager.  Sammy pours quite nicely, leaving a thick head that takes a few minutes to dwindle. It's got good carbonation, as the rising bubbles will attest to. Smells faintly malty and bready.  Tastes very smooth and hearty. The malts tangle with the hops in a nice balance, and that's really the key to this beer's sustained success. Slight caramel tastes are in there, as are some vague citrus hints from the hops. Sammy has good mouthfeel and finishes as smooth as it starts.  Overall, this an excellent example of how an American-style lager should be done. This beer has an excellent reputation, and it's well deserved. It's a cornerstone beer, and it's one to introduce to your friends who are stuck in big-brand limbo. Sammy was one of the gateway beers for me, and I'll wager that it's introduced more than one beer drinker to a wider world of beer enjoyment.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Zorro,4.42,"This is one of my day to day standard beers so I might be a bit biased. ;)  Dark Gold/ Light Brown looks great in the glass.  Very complex smell, smells more like a good pale ale than a lager. Carmel, Malts and hops! Also has some vanilla and oak in there.  Taste, hoppy for a lager! Kind of jumps up and says HEY! I could almost be a pale ale! Has that Vanilla/Oak taste that you expect from a pale ale. It is a little sweet but not too much. Has a slightly bitter hops quality.  Mouthfeel is thick for a lager again a lot like a pale ale.  You can drink this stuff all night; it gets and stays smooth.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,WesWes,3.78,"The beer pours a dark golden color with a 1/4"" creamy white head. The aroma is clean with the scent of light malts. The taste is good. It's smooth and refreshing.

A good sessions ale.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Nytemare,4.24,"Delivered to me in a pint glass with some head. Was a nice reddish brown color. Smelled hoppy with a bread malt coming through. Some florals in the nose as well.

I love this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Stingray5,4.1,"Definitely preferable on tap, my old standby never fails to disappoint. Amber pour leads to nutty malt aroma with a crisp hop presence.

35,104,JohnnyDuvel,3.63,"This beer seems certainly seems more tame to me than it did when I first tried it. I remember it being the first beer with any significant hop profile that I had tried. Now, it seems so mild (but certainly better and more flavorful than the ""big three""). A well balanced lager (that seems more like an ale to me). Almost amber in color, crisp, with a dry finish. Nice with food, and occasionally it is a ""good decision!""",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Ardon,4.12,"Appearance: Nice amber colour With a nice frothy head.  Smell: Rich malty scent.  Taste: Once again like the smell, however with a bitter lasting after taste.

35,104,NJpadreFan,3.14,"sam adam's on tap at ruby tuesday's- that was the best they could offer.  Sam Adams poured a nice golden brown with a biscuit like head. very nice.  The smell was very malty. The taste was slighty skunked, malty and crisp. I'm sure no one buys sam adams on tap at the ruby tuesday that would account for the touch of skunkiness. Just an average lager otherwise.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mschofield,3.7,"Golden with a touch of red, medium high white head that laces well Aroma balanced between malt sweetness and hops with a floral touch. Flavor is mostly malt, with a touch of hops in the back, a touch of grapefruit. A medium feel to it, nicely balanced and easy drinking.  This was the first good beer I ever had. It's still great as a session beer, and should be the best choice at any number of restaurants and bars. I don't get it as much as I used to - but these came in the winter pack. It's been passed by some of the beers BBC came up with later, and towers above some of the others.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,DrunkMcDermott,3.47,"I have to render unto this beer its props for being, usually, the best choice you have available in most restaurant bars (although a fine Chicago pizza scarfin' establishment like Giordano's should know better than to use iced-over glasses). Has a nice dark gold color, darker than any megabrew, under the usual lager head. The malt is very evident, almost but not quite a caramel aspect, again better than megabrewed ""barley pop."" Hop flavor is nicely balanced, bitterness doesn't really assert itself until after you swallow.

Mouthfeel: substantial, meaty but not overbearing. Overall: it's no mystery why this beer is so frickin' popular, they hit on all bases. big enough taste for ""serious"" beer drinkers but won't scare away macro drinkers.  Addendum 3/19/04: It's nice to retry a beer months after first reviewing it to see if your opinion has changed...it hasn't. This beer is magnificent, the full flavors that don't overpower, the incredible balance. Highly underrated, probably due to it's availability and therefore loss of ""hipness"".

35,104,GCBrewingCo,3.63,"This amber colored brew had a white head that lasted from the first taste to the last drop and laced the glass from top to bottom. The aroma is quite fruity and malty. The flavor is sweet malt and a good hop backbone. The finish is sweet then bitter and that finish lasts. The drinkability is good.  As far as being a good beer, it certainly is. As far as being a good vienna lager, it isn't. Too fruity and too hoppy.

Fresh tasting is the only way I can describe it. Sweet apple flavors and lightly spicy. Mouthfeel is creamy and fizzy. Light-bodied. An understated hoppy aftertaste that slowly builds and rises on the palette. Very smooth, very drinkable.  Still love this beer. It was my ""gateway"" beer to micros over 10 years ago.

35,104,Rootdog316,3.7,"The aroma is hoppy, flowery, and spicy. The taste is hoppy and, to a lesser extent, malty. Boston lager tastes sweet at first, then finishes dry. And it leaves a dry aftertaste in the mouth, balanced equally between hops and malt. This beer's hoppy/malty characteristics make it an excellent beer to drink with many foods, particularly steak, beef stew, hamburger, or sausage. The taste of German hops are this beer's strongest asset. Caramel, spice, biscuits, and toasted malt flavors all contribute to the flavor and make this a beer to remember but the hops are what I remember more than anything when I sample this brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Dark color with a rich texture that creatively blends hoppy flavor with a slightly more acidic brew than usual in a lager. Starts with an almost wood-like taste that builds to a complex climax before leaving a near-cinnamon aftertaste (one that tends to stick on the tongue, by the way). The beer of choice for those who prefer a dark lager, although the longevity of the aftertaste is something of which to be wary.  - Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 22AUG03, this post is based on notes from that review, and several tastings since. -",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,Beastdog75,3.57,"Samuel Adams Boston Lager, the flagship beer of the Boston Beer Company, has a wide range of people either slamming it or singing its praises. In my opinion, this is probably the most obtainable ""good beer"" that you can get. Even chain restaurants serving mostly junk beer will probably have the Boston Lager. I had this beer on many of an occasion when I first started drinking. I took a step back, and many of the lagers that I've reviewed for BA have been of the pale, fizzy type (for a reason). Trying Sam Adams after such a long absence, the difference was immediately noticable (and justifying the ""reason"" I alluded to). Sam Adams is a very good lager, whose availability is definately a plus.  Boston Lager pours a golden amber color with some orange hints. A decent, white foam head forms and lasts for about 35 seconds before thinning out (but still leaving a decent lace). There is some caramel malt scents here, but there is a very aromatic hop bouquet here: floral and spicy in the nose, and crisp. Thin, lager type of mouthfeel, but not over-carbonated. Once again, crisp. There is an good amount of caramel malt flavor here, but the hops really make their presence known. Floral, spicy, herbal (in some ways a medicine-like bitterness). After previously reviewing weaker beers, the hops seem to hit hard. Quite dry in the finish. The dryness and bitterness in the aftertaste lasts for awhile, and there are some nutty malt flavors remaining. This finishes out with a little alcoholic warmth.  The second one I had seemed to go down smoother than the first, although it seemed less hoppy. This would go with a wide range of foods, from steaks, to turkey (or other poultry), and even Italian food. For a beer of such wide availability, this is an all-around good choice. It may be a simple lager, but it's done right.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Aroma is a dull toned breadish malt, lightly sweet of bagels and a touch of roastyness thats nice, hints of dried herbal hops as well. Taste has a very mellow easy malty roasty sweetness, kinda light breadish quality with a semi amount of dried herbal hops, almost spicy in some transitions of the crisp clean finish. Feel is lighter then medium, smooth and easy, nice touch of carbonation helps it a bit. A nice little lager.

The lace will continue all the way to the bottom.  Full malt aroma, with a tingle of spicy hops.  Big bready malt flavor, clean, with a subtle hoppy finish. Really would prefer this with more hops.

I know: it is commonly found everywhere, so how can it be exceptional? Don't beers have to be from microbreweries that are very hard to find and have to be ordered special from your local liquor store? Not for me. This beer has what I look for: drinkability. It goes well with food. The bouquet is very subtle. It doesn't overpower you with hops. It has a nice malty middle. A delicious but slightly bitter finish.

Appearance was pretty good, with a healthy foamy off-white head that left a bit of lace. Light honey color. Aroma was light, a bit corny, not too much hops. Flavor was also pretty light, and unimpressive. Not much balance or character. Very faint light malt, teeny bit of hops, perhaps a bit of sweet corn and honey. Some cinnamon lingers, but a faint acrid note emerges in the finish.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pours a rather light amber translucent tone with a nice creamy head edging between white and light tan in colour. Lasting, leaving considerable lacing behind.  The smell reflected a nice maltyness and a delicate hoppyness suggesting a rather balanced brew with a soft taste.  And so it was. A bit sweet, but mantaining the usual fine lager pattern in a very soft and easygoing body. No excess carbonation (perhaps lacked it a bit) and the reduced and comfortable bitterness at the end compliments it well.  A nice mouthfeel with no excess flavours as one would desire see in a red lager. Nice buy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Appearance: Pours a crystal-clear, honey brown with a fine, white, three-quarter inch head; nice lacing; adequate head retention.  Nose: Predominantly of sweet, caramel malt and noble hops.  Taste: Gentle sweetness upfront; nicely proportioned hop bitterness in the finish; herbal, earthy hop flavors; mild notes of caramel and grain. Medium bodied; smooth, crisp mouthfeel.  Notes: As so many before me have pointed out, a great ""fall-back"" beer. How many beer selling establishments would simply be intolerable without SA's Boston Lager?

The nose had a nice mix of soft malt, some soft fruit and a slightly spicy hop smell.  The taste was medium bodied. Very smooth. Light caramel flavor and rich sweet malt. A full even bitterness layered against an earthy hop flavor. It actually tastes like it's been dry hopped somewhat. Surprisingly the hops seem to slightly dominate, although they never overpower the malt.  It ends with a nice even hop bitterness offset by the sweet malt.  Basically it's just a great all around beer. No matter how much Sam Adams seems to sell out, the fact is... they continue to make an extremely drinkable flavorful beer.

The nose is fruity and a bit malt. It smells alot like the Boston Ale variant if that gives you any clue. (atleast how I remember it)  The taste is suprisingly refreshing, a bit hoppy and nutty. The carbonation is just perfect and it's very drinkable imho.  This is one of the few american macro brews I like, and yet again it was from Samuel Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Taste is a bit unusual, and it's maybe a bit hoppier than I'd like, but that's a personal preferance thing.

I believe it was the first ""good beer"" I had tried, and it did not disappoint me then as it does not now. The beer pours a clear deep red/light brown with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is of floral hops, a highly drinkable blend that Sam Adams is known for. The hops are present, not in the fashion of a pale ale, but moreso than in other lagers. There is a good malt base that gives this beer more prescence and a more fulfilling feel. Although I've branched out and found true happiness in the world of microbrews, I still enjoy a nice big steak with a tasty Sam Adams on occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Pours out a good looking clear light amber, small foamy head, and some decent lacing. Nose consists mainly of floral hops, a bit of malt behind it. Flavour primarily spicy hops, some sweet malt to back it up. Creamy mouthfeel, but the whole deal seems to bite on the way down, doesn't sit well.

The aroma of the hops in this beer are good. You can taste the malt character, and the beer finishes very clean. This is a good beer to have around for your macro friends, because if they don't drink it all, you won't mind having it around.

The beer itself is very good, pours a nice copper color, with good carbonation and a thin white head, with a nice hop and spice smell. Hops and carmelized malts seem to be the most present flavors, with a hint of spicyness, and a very very small hint of fruit. The brew finishes very dry, and leaves you wanting more.

35,104,Boilermaker88,3.06,"This is a decent brew but not one of my favorites. It poured a beautiful amber with a big creamy head that stayed throughout. The smell was rather sharp after the aroma of malt and some spice. The taste had a real bite of hops at the end after I got past the blend of fruit, malt and spice. I felt the combination of carbonation and bitterness at the finish tended to overpower the smoothness at the start. The bitter aftertaste really hung around.

I enjoyed the subtle but present smell in this one for some reason. There also seems to be a butteryness present, i'm not sure why.  It pouired a tarnished bronze color and had a decent blanket of holy lacing across the top and a nice stiff collar around the neck o the glass, a lacing that clings sufficiantly when called upon to do so.  The taste here is also agreeable. I am a slow drinker, and this beer still sits before me after about an hour or so (please, no verbal attacs or terristic threats concerning my ""babysitting"" habbit) and the taste stays interesting and drinkable well into room tempature.

The beer produced a decent head, white in color and semi lasting in nature. It was fluffy and sticky which was evident in the lace that it left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, caramel, flowers, hops and a hint of citrus. The flavors were exactly the same, sweet malt, caramel, hops, citrus (light) and flowers. It left a semi hop finish that was light and semi dry. An all around smooth and quaffable beer, it is very easy to drink.

It's because at many restaurants, it's the only beer available that's drinkable. And that's ultimately what I think of Sam Adams...it's drinkable.  Sam Adams pours a nice amber with a creamy head. The beer smells of malts and is not overpowering as befits a lager. You know it's a good beer when you fight the head to smell the beer.  Sam Adams has a strong malt flavor with a light hop finish.

Before Sam Adams I was not a beer drinker so I give credit to Jim Koch for introducing me to good beer. Although I no longer drink this one that often, I did have one with dinner the other night at a restaurant. On draught, clear light amber with very little head and only slight lacing. Decent hop presence for a lager but a little too watery which obscured the malt flavor I was looking for. I've been to the brewery in Jamaica Plain MA many times in the past, and I know what Boston Beer is capable of.

This is my choice when I'm at bars who have a shitty selection and think this lager is the best that they can supply. I love the darker appearance it has compared to any other beer you would drink at said bars. This is my sentimental value me talking now. But anyways, it has a wonderful balance, malty more in the start with a nice hop kick in the finish. And it's very refreshing and perfect for all night sessions. I have gone broke many a night spending 4 dollars a bottle on this stuff from 11pm-2am nonstop. But in all honesty, this beer was the very beginning of my crossover into ""craft beer world.""

You can easily pick-up the malts & hops in the smell. Also a little biscuit aroma thrown in.  Taste is solid. Nice interplay of hops and malt. Beer sweetens as it warms.  Mouthfeel is a trifle thin & drinkablity is very decent.  This is often the only ""decent"" beer available at a lot of events and places and I don't mind having this as a choice.

For a lager this beer has one terrific appearance darker than most non-dark lagers..almost like a copper ale..a small but dense slighly off white head that lingers long..very good so far Smell also id quite good for a lager..i can smell that hop aroma pretty well..and its good and fresh. MM great malty tatse but with a solid real hop bite at the end superb stuff. Very good in the mouth not cloying at all. An exceptionally drinkable lager indeed.

Clear, copper in color forming a beautiful sticky head atop small to medium-sized bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. Thick clusters of foam sit atop the head when it thins. Aroma is rich and satisfying with aroma of floral noble hops, pure water, roasted grains, and pale and amber malts. Fermentation is clean without much fruitiness aside from the hops. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is excellent...soft, easy to drink, with a slightly dry finish making you want more. Taste begins with floral dry-hopped flavor with pleasant, balanced intensity...pale malts and what appears to be caramunich malts fill up the middle with a nice maltiness that balances out the excellent bittering hop finish. There is a very nice cookie-like sweetness towards the middle which nicely complements the bittering hops, reminding me of Rogue Dead Guy Ale. There is a subtle hint of chalk and husken grains towards the end with a smooth and soft mouthfeel. This is an excellent go-to beer that is reliable, easy to find, easy to drink, and has been a staple in my fridge for the last 10 years.

Aroma consists of a full malty almost bready aroma with a subtle hop aroma that diffuses very well into my senses. The hop aroma presents a slightly piney very aromatic aroma. Taste is predomanitely a buttery malt sweetness balanced by the bittering hops with a very solid all around good and refreshing flavor. Very smoothe mouthfeel that has a silky texture found in this medium to light bodied classic amber lager. I'm glad that Jim Koch found ol' gran dad's recipe, this beer has been the backbone of the Boston Beer Company.

35,104,brewdlyhooked13,4.8,"I have had more of this beer than any other non-mega brew. Tonight I compared it after trying a Boston Ale. I may have to pop open an ale and a lager at the same time for a side by side comparison. Maybe it's just me, but the lager's color seems a bit brighter, more orangey. I don't know, maybe it has something to do with that pink bunny that followed me home again, today is Easter, after all.  A rougher than average pour yielded a 3-finger head, rapidly pulling back to a half inch or so. Aroma is a little more intense than the Boston Ale. The taste s definitely more intense, some nights it seems even a bit overbearing, but tonight it tastes right on the money. To me, the taste profile occurs via a rapid progression through three stages: 1) Malt flavor, delicious and bold. It's the malt component that turned me into a craft beer lover. Yum. 2) Following next is the brief burn of carbonation, ending in 3) a very nice balanced hop flavor. Stays right in the comfort zone and says ""I'm here and I'm a hop"", but doesn't inspire gargoyles in the least, unless maybe you're a Keystone drinker, ha ha.  This beer I tend to want to enjoy more slowly and get max flavor for my 12 ounce investment, the Boston Ale kind of invites you to guzzle a bit more. I suppose it depends on the setting as to which one I would prefer, but these days, with two kids and seldom an opportunity to sit down and enjoy a beer, the Lager gets the nod. All you young singles, or married folks without kids, take note - starting a family can wait, good beer has a limited shelf life. :-)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Hops are in short supply, but there are enough to provide a little play on the palate. This lager is really all about the malt, though and it's quite tasty, with a comfortable mouthfeel. Body is thoroughly on the thin side, and not 1/3 through the pint I'm feeling awfully bored. Not enough of what I like in a beer, but then I don't normally drink this style.

Sheets of carbonation surge upward to replenish the head; the lacing is excellent.  Aroma: The aroma is rich with sweet caramel malts and lesser herbal hops.  Tasting yields rich, slightly sweet caramel malts. Towards the middle of the taste, moderately bitter medicinal hops appear. The hops carry through to the finish, where the toasted malt flavors reassert themselves amidst a lingering, mild hop bitterness.  Mouth feel: The mouth feel is smooth and creamy, quite rich.

Full bodied and loaded with fresh hops. Terrific fresh hop nose and one of the most enjoyable creamy lager heads on the planet.

The head was about 3/4 inch and lasted down the glass with strong lacing. The aroma was of malts and faint hops, with a slight sense of grass. The taste surprised me as it had real body that was full and robust. The hops taste was pleasant and left a nice bitterness in the aftertaste.

The finish is slightly dry with faint hop notes and weakening malt flavors. Aftertaste is very faint malt flavors with some grainy flavors floating in and out. Hops are long gone. The mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation for a lager. Overall a decent lager but not what it use to be in the late 80's and early 90's. IMHO it seems to be less bold and assertive than it use to be. For me this is still a ""for when there is nothing else"" beer.

It is a stand buy for when non BA drinkers come over for a brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,PhantomVodoo,4,"Light copper color with a large off-white head. Head sticks to the glass. Nice hop aroma with malts readily noted as well.  Taste is well balanced, but maintains a nice level of bitterness. Spicy hop bite really makes this beer. Good malt character as well.  Good mouthfeel. Good drinkability. Overall, a good beer that fits just about any drinking occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Bang34,3.33,"Probably the main beer that folks think of when they hear about Brewer and patriot Samuel Adams. I should probably preface this in that I really prefer Ales to Lagers but htis one is not bad a lagers go.  Pours a golden amber color with a very thin head that disappears quickly. Sweet malty aroma w/ a little hops. taste is much of the same. A little bitter at first with the maltiness that follows with a dry finish. I like it an will opt for it over any other lager that is served.  This beer helped kickstart the microbrew revolution and with the wide availability now, I think this is close to not qualifying as a micro anymore.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,stegmakk,3.3,"Crystal clear copper color with an off white head thats gone quickly. Aroma mainly of caramel malt, a little sweet. Flavor was swet malt all the way through with added slight bitterness at the end. I thought I caught a bit of tea like taste in there not much but enought to catch my taste buds. Good lager for the masses...decent for those that want more in a beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,xXTequila,4.38,For some crazy reason I used to not like this beer very much but recently I picked some up and I loved it.

35,104,Naerhu,4.3,"Ingredients: malt and hops  Fine bubbles tumbling through a slightly opaque orange-gold body. Rich, dark oaky and hoppy aroma. Surprised at the fruitiness and creamy mouthfeel on a malty sweet palate. Lovely long lasting bitterness. I have just found my favorite lager. This is simply amazing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Mark,3.81,"A decent lager, sweet Vienna style makes good company for pizza and other standard grub. Nothing special but a good fall back beer, at least for me. Have had on draft and of course bottled. Last place I had it on tap sucks and really diminishes any beer. Never order a beer in Chilis (Concord Ca.) They have no clue. I had this again recently and it went down well, I felt it deserved another review since I realize I had short changed it. One of my favorite beers of this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,garymuchow,3.6,"Compared to many beer sampler's I haven't found this beer exceptional, although it still a worthwhile brew. My biggest issue is the quality of tea (especially green tea) in both the aroma and taste. Now in this most recent sampling it seems to be less evident, and as many have stated previously, there may be a change of recipe within the last 6 to 12 months.  Malty aroma with the hint of tea, which I assume is the hops character. Full tan head with dark gold liquid and good clarity. Interesting mix of malt and hops in taste, with some dryness. But overall very good blending and balancing. Very good mouthfeel, with a good sense of richness, but not excessive. The tea quality is too distracting for me, but otherwise a good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,UncleJimbo,3.48,"I sampled a pint of Sam Adams Lager on tap.  The beer is a nice copper color with very thin white foam. No lace on the glass. There was almost no aroma from this beer. The taste is pretty good, mainly dominated by hops (floral and aromatic). The mouthfeel is good, but not very full bodied. The finish is mostly hop bitterness. The drinkability is decent, but this is not one of my favorites. It does seem to taste better on-tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,NeroFiddled,3.68,"To be honest I'm not sure if it's me, but I remember this beer as having more bitterness and hop character. I distinctly remember being able to pick out some light hops in the nose and yet I don't find any now. And I know that my palate has become accustomed to hop bitterness over the years, but this is definitely softer than it once was! The label is notched April of 2003; Boston and Rochester, NY. Whether it's been reformulated, or this is just a slightly varied batch I don't know, but this is what I find...  It pours a deep amber body topped by a full and frothy ivory head that holds well. It eventually drops to a creamy collar and thin surface covering, but also leaves some spotty lace about the glass. The nose is surprisingly limited with just some dextrinous malt, a mild fruitiness, and a background note of acetone. A very fine-bubbled and zesty carbonation combines with a firm medium body to create a creamy mouthfeel. What I recall as being an assertively hopped, but well-balanced beer now appears to offer only a lightly caramel-tinged sweet malt that's barely supported by understated bitterness. The finish is simply a diminishing of the flavor that's found in the mouth. It's lightly drying, but basically the maltiness just fades away into nothingness. No hop flavor is present. Still, I guess it's fairly enjoyable and has a good drinkability - it's certainly not challenging! If this has been reformulated in the hopes of becoming more accessible to the 'common' beer drinker, it's certainly hit the mark. If it's simply a bad (and even ""off"") contract brew, then shame on Boston Beer for losing quality control. I'm certainly going to try this beer again - on draft and in bottle - with the hopes that I'll find the wonderful lager that once thrilled me.  Re-review 03/07/03: Although this bottles is no fresher (notched May 2003), it is much cleaner. There's definitely no ""background note of acetone"". It does have a slight hop flavor, but no more bitterness. Still, it remains very much the same.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,OldFrothingSlosh,3.97,"My first venture into the realm of non-macro brews. One that I have had many, many times and one that always tastes great. Included in the winter sampler pack.  Pours a deep amber color with lovely frothy-white that smothers the entire glass.  The aroma is a fragrant hops and malt mix that carries over into the flavor. Malt and hops are well-balanced. Mouthfeel is good. Finishes crisp and clean, with a pleasant hoppy bitterness on the palate.  A beer that you won't have to worry about when ordering. Consistenly refreshing and flavorful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,kunzbrew,3.8,"The brew pours a clean crisp amber color with a nice head that does not want to stick around for the duration. The smell amber malt rings the nose but the hops aroma is not to strong. The maltyiness is ok but not great. The hop flavor is non existent.

35,104,Dmann,4.33,"I remember this being my first ""real beer"" after drinking the usual macro brews for so many years. And it still holds up very well today. The smell has always been interesting to me, with it's lemon like scent. It pours a light amber color with a great head that lasts about 2 minutes and leaves a good lace. The taste is malty with a great little bite at the finnish. Still one of my favorite beers and one to always fall back on since it is available almost anywhere.  Update: 12/22/04  Seems to have more of a hop presence than before, which is a good thing. A great beer indeed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,JMH_,4.05,"a solid classic amongst micros. pours a medium amber colour. there is a nice malt/hop balance in the flavour here. nothing outstanding about the original SA, but well made all around, and it's available pretty much everywhere you go, so if friends drag you to a bar that serves mostly bud/coors/miller, etc, chances are you'll find SA there too, and it's always a safe, tasty choice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,cretemixer,3.53,"Golden amber hue with a fairly frothy off-white head. Head has some staying power and leaves a nice white lace. Smells well balanced but nothing extrodinary, slightly malty sweet and not too hoppy. Not bad...the flavor of the sweeter malts do dominate with a weak hoppy finish. Good introduction beer to wet someone's whistle to what lies beyond the world of the macros. Decent balance, medium carbontaion, medium body. Pretty good overall but not even close to what the true micros have to offer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ThePostmaster,3.38,"It is easy to bash this beer. It's one of the original micro's, almost to the point of being an expensive macro. This is, however, a good well crafted American lager. The color, smell and thick head are excellent. Taste is of malt and prominant imported hops. Taste is heavy and sweet, almost overpowering in the later. The finish is clean and malty. This is a great beer. I don't drink it often because of it's heaviness, but this is a beer among beers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,doho95fu,4.27,"I went to a steakhouse on Christmas Eve, and this was the best I could do. The last time I had this beer was at least 6-7 years ago, and I do not remember being impressed. But this is a good lager - I was pleasantly surprised. The color is not extraordinary, the smell is a balance of malt, hops, and lemon. The taste is more malt than hops in my book with some sweetness despite the citrus smells. There is a hoppy finish, with an aftertaste of something sweet that I could not place (caramel? molasses?). I am not the biggest fan of lagers, but this must be as good representation of the style as I have had. Obviously it is drinkable and the mouthfeel is good as well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,mjohn27603,4,Pours with a large head that overfilled my pint glass. Amber in color which is pretty for a lager. Can't get much off the aroma. The taste is better than I remember. The hops flavor and slight bitterness are what make this beer for me. It makes it so much more interesting than other American lagers. It seems like I don't quite get the full hops flavor in many of these. The only reason I can think of is out of date beer. This one seems to have retained freshness. Leaves a nice ringing aftertaste of sweetness rather than the sour taste many lagers leave. Not a bad option when microbrews aren't around. Still their corporate ethics as of late have made me think twice before picking up a sixer.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,IrishRedRock,4.03,"Wow...so much better than I remember. I previously only ever had this on tap and never liked it all that much, but this bottle is delicious. Compared against other lagers, it's quite good, and against any beer really its good.  The darker appearance for a lager is quite appealing, and the head retains quite well. Aroma is a nice balance of both the malts and hops.  Extremely smooth, a near perfect mouthfeel. Malty and delicious. A true American standard.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeerBuilder,3.75,"Pours to a light copper color with a white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is of caramel malt, and spicey/floral hops. Again in the flavor I taste the caramel malts, but the malt flavor is balanced out by the slight hop bitterness. The hop flavor is in the background, but a slight floralness was tasted. It is a light-medium bodied beer, leaning more toward light. It is relatively clean, and finishes a bit sweet and smooth. Overall, a good, well balanced lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Webby64,3.9,"My first review, but not my first ""good beer"". This brewski really hit the spot today! I keep licking my chops everytime I take a sip. Love the ""look"" and the smell is good.

35,104,rockdick,4,"One guy said this was ""The Godfather"" of the American Amber Lagers, and I totally agree. It poured a dark amber color with a white head that lasted about half way down.

35,104,Shiloh,3.82,"A very good lager, somewhat darker than I anticipated as it was a very deep and rich amber. The head was nothing exceptional but it is the taste that gets you and holds you there. A burning sweetness is the only way to describe this expierience. Mouthfeel and drinkability are equal to the taste in this well rounded brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Winter,4,"Poured a clear amber with a nice foamy head about an inch thick. Aroma consisted primarily of hops. Taste is light bodied, but flavorful. Not much up front, but then a toasted flavor is introduced in the middle. Finish has a touch of bitterness and light caramel, followed by a pleasing return to a toasted hop finish. I tried this out of the Winter Classics sampler pack and I have to admit that this was one of the freshest tasting bottles of Sam Adams Boston Lager that I have ever had. Sam Adams was one of the first beers during the microbrew revolution in the mid 90's to get me to convert over to micros.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,allboutbierge,4,"This beer has become a standard in judging lagers for many people; I can see why. The appearance is relatively attractive: Color is an amber with very predominate colors of orange. Head poured is fluffy and it leaves a nice trail of lace down the glass. The bubbles of carbonation are tiny but produce a small head that lasts throughout the glass. Fragerance is balanced with a trace of hops. Flavor is good; its well balanced with mellow carmel-like malts with a nibble of hops that hits the tip of the drinkers tongue. Very pleasant brew to drink. Not my favorite, but a beer that I enjoy alot none the less.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,SchmichaelJ,4.08,"While I had heard from many sources that this was a pretty excellent beer, I decided to see for myself if the buzz was truth or hype. The Boston Lager did not disappoint. Straight from a Sam Adams sampler case, the bottle poured a nice golden color with just the right amount of head and subsequent lace on the glass. An enticing malty scent greeted my nostrils, and the taste was everything I look for in a finely balanced, pure amber lager. A slight fizziness on the tongue was complemeted by a filling, creamy mouthfeel. This lager is very drinkable...luckily the sampler only had 6 in the case, or I'd be in trouble! Very enjoyable beer, and its reputation is well-deserved.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

As with most people, one of my first micros and led me down the beer-snob path.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Zraly,3.95,"This lager has a wonderful smell, a nice floral bouquet with a hint of citrus. It almost smells what essential oil buffs would call ""floriental"". Now that I've really paid attention to that...I don't think I'll ever look at a Sam Adams the same.  This is truly a sophisticated American lager. It's extra-poofy, frothy head adds a contrasting beauty to the copper color of the brew itself.  I really appreciate the balanced nature of the malt, grain, and bitter components. Neither realm dominates the overall structure of the beer, but they each harmonize into a tight finish. And there is definately a fruity dimension lingering around there somewhere, almost a key lime-orangey subtlety...a really nice touch to an already tasty and drinkable beer.  I really think that Sam Adams Boston Lager is a classic. Even when I had *wine snob* tendencies, I would enjoy this on the occassions that I drank beer.  Great smell, great appearance, great taste...always a great choice.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,hyuga,4.1,"Clear copper-amber color topped off with a nice white head that stays just right and leaves a subtle lace. Nice floral hop aroma dominates the nose, backed by sweet and grainy malt. Hops and malt combine beautifully to create that classic unique Sam Adams flavor. Floral and slightly spicy hop character, a bit oily. Some would say metallic, but I would attribute this to the hops. Malt is again sweet and grainy, a great character. Exceptional balance and a great malt and hop pairing. Flavorful medium body that almost seems like a full body. Sweet and hoppy dry, crisp finish. This beer is a classic in so many ways. A crossover beer that converted many palates and created many beer advocates, as well as being a wonderful beer in itself and a great session brew. The world of micro/craft brewing owes a lot to this beer and this brewery. Appreciate it and enjoy it!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

When I last drank it, Sam's smiling countenance greeted me from the label and he was offering me a tankard of fresh brew...now he's gone. What happened? It must have been one of those silly marketing focus groups. Oh well. In the glass the beer is a light copper with a two finger off-white head that dissipates quickly. The caramel maltiness of the past seems more restrained than what I recall. Crisp hops are nicely balanced with the malt....but again, much less assertive than I remember with this beer. It once had a signature hops bite that I really enjoyed, now just a shadow of its former self.

I have to believe they were from different brewerys under contract to BBC. Now, after years, I open another Detroit sample. It looks great, with reddish gold color and a neat, concise head of off-white, tiny bubbles. Then there's the smell. Other than the dominating notes of brushed metal, it seems like there's quality here. I just have a problem with strong metallic notes in my beer. It appears on the palate as well, where otherwise creamy, fizzy flavors of buttered toast and clean, soft hops appear. I'm willing to bet that I could get used to the metal after a few of these.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Murph,4,"Pours a clear light copper color with a nice creamy head that laces the glass very well. Nice caramel malt flavors are definitely present along with a fairly aggresive hoppiness as compared to the other beers I have tried in the style. Smooth and not overly sweet caramel malt opens up the brew. The malt holds up and supports the brew as the tangy hoppiness takes over at the end to provide a nice crisp finish. Very full flavored, this medium bodied brew is creamy and nicely crisp with the hop twang at the end. This beer has always served me well as a fall back brew and goes especially nice in the summertime.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

Taste is fresh, slightly fruity, notes of subdued flowery hops & slightly biscuity malt. Finishes smooth and mellow, with nice hop and malt interplay on the palate...invites another swallow. A great session beer...although it seems to me that when this beer was first rolled out on a wider scale back in the mid-80's, it had a bit more balls in the hop dept. It seems the recipe has been ""tweaked""since then. Or maybe since it's made in a few different locations the final product varies slightly, I dunno.

It does deserve it, as I truly believe that BBC is a victim of their own success as opposed to being a sell-out.  Pours with great head that reminds me of the foamy and creamy looking whitecaps on the ocean. Great looking amber color with tints of gold. The ever-present hops are definitely responsible for the telltale unique bitter flavor that Sam Lager is known for.  Really bright mouthfeel and smooth clear finish.

Aroma is pleasant but could be a touch more pronounced. Just excellent balance, creamy caramel malts, and a nice amount of sassy hot cinnamon hop. In many ways, more Pale Ale-like than the Sam Pale Ale. Medium mouthfeel, very refreshing.

I was not disappointed. The amber hue and thick white head, although short-lived, were pleasing to the eye. The smell was of hops that had overwhelmed its malty companion. The taste went to the malt, however the hops were making a comeback at the end of the flavor. The beer was smooth, yet popped on my tongue with carbonation and this is one of those full-flavored beers that can be consumed en-masse. Excellent.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

It wasn't until I rediscovered it recently in an airport bar that I was able to realize what a truly impressive beer this is. Trying it on draught is a must. The draught really brings out the sweet, malty body of this beer. The boquet is wonderfuly sweet (hints of caramel) and brings out the hoppy character of this beer -- truly exceptional for such a popular brand!

Still, it was the first ""national"" beer I can remember that decided that a brisk hop aroma was not a bad thing as the macro brewers had seemingly ordained. Amber color with long-lasting medium head. Dominant noble hop aroma over caramel maltiness-very nice. Taste is malty sweetness followed by sharp and crisp hop bitterness. The body varies somewhat between light to medium-perhaps based on the brewery from which it was contracted? A very drinkable American beer that is a great fallback when more unique beers cannot be found.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,zerk,4.17,"Clear light-amber with a head that dissapates quickly and leaves a fine lace. Aroma is very complex, and has a definate hoppy quality. Taste is excellent, has very pronounced hop flavor, but isn't overpowering. Hop / malt balance is maintained.  I really enjoy Sam Adams, as it is a very easy to find, and very well made beer. It's definately not your average lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bditty187,3.91,"Clear, bronze-gold hue; fluffy, thick, white head, excellent retention chunky rings of lace are produced. The nose is mild with light caramel, grain, and hops simplistic and clean yet inviting. Tasty, straightforward palate the hops are the most noticeable aspect of this beer; the malt (with caramel hints) adds tremendous balance. Very drinkable enjoyable to quaff. Medium body. Ideal carbonation. The finish is short and clean with hops drying the mouth aftertaste is largely nil (only faint caramel). Sam Adams' Boston Lager might be the best easy-to-find beer on the market. This is a true classic and a must try for any beer drinker. We would be at a loss without this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,LarryV,4.1,"This beer makes a great session beer. Pours a beautiful amber-red color. Balanced flavor of malt and hops with a medium mouthfeel. It's also excellent on draught as well. This is one of the best lagers I've had imho. Easy to drink, and easy to appreciate.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,canoehornpoint,3.88,"This is actually a complex beer. The nose is both malty and hoppy. Color is medium brownish amber, head is moderate. Retention is good. It starts with a malty and mildly citrusy hop taste and finishes with a more noble hop finish.  Re-review Thick white creamy head that stayed pretty decently and clings well, medium amber color with conservative carbonation. Minimal aroma, husky malt nose. German noble hops round out a husky but not offensive maltiness, hop bite at end is relatively neutral in flavor. Starts fairly smoothe but finishes with a bit of bite on the back sides of the tongue. This beer takes some hits but is a pretty flavorful lager (as lagers go).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,psugrad98,4.48,"A great beer. Dark amber with nice head, and lace. Lace quickly dissapears though. Deep and rich tasting with carmel like sweetness and nicely bitter hop floral flavor. Finishes somewhat sweet with lovely bitter bite. A great session beer. My current favorite",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Dogbrick,3.03,"Very distinct flavor but my least favorite of the Sammy's line, as I much prefer their seasonal fare. Nothing to really complain about though, as it is an above-average lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BillyBrew,4.38,"As common as Sam is throughout New England, I never get it draught. I guess I just have so often otherwise. But Man, Sam gets even better after a nice pull! Its head ends up super creamy and sticky and keeps a full, thick cover straight through to the ends. I got a healthy serving of tastey foam off the bottom. A fantastic deep and rich balance of hop spike and rounding malts on the back of a silky smooth, medium body. Perfect anytime. Sam and Jim Koch and a great asset for all of beer. Cheers to Sam and Jim!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Viking,3.52,"A solid beer from BBC. Amber body, with a thin, lacy head. Malty caramel aroma, with some mellow hops adding a bit of spice. Flavor is also malty. Caramel and a biscuity flavor combine with a mild citrus hops taste for a very refreshing and drinkable beer. Smooth, almost dry finish. A bit too carbonated for my liking - made it a bit acidic on the tongue. Overall, a good brew to kick back with among friends.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,goindownsouth,3.45,"Really, a decent beer. The color is nice and copper and the head is apparent, but not annoying. However, the tast was a little less than I expected. I am really not catching anything out of the ordinary in here. There is little if any hops in there, and it is not very alluring. All in all, a very drinkable lager that is really not this sommelier's choice, but very do-able.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,John1985,4.08,"Dark amber color with good head retention, malty nose, rich malty taste with hops in the back, finish was smooth with a few hops thrown in. I agree with the others guys, this brew is the American standard micro lager. Good bye Bud, hello Sam! By the way I enjoyed this in a 24oz bottle which is new to Nashville.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Jdiddy,5,"I gave this beer the top rating because it is by far my favorite all around beer. Tour the brewery once and you will realize how much time and dedication Jim Koch put's into his beer. I am sure most have had this so I wll save the description but I could drink this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stunning!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,BeerAngel,3.93,"Nice looking beer showing off it's pale amber color and pouring a nice lumpy head. The smell is fairly inviting, but actually a sleeper as it doesn't tell you what your about to drink. For a common beer, the flavor is quite nice. Has a nice hop bitterness that increases at the end. The flavor is balanced quite nicely and leaves you wanting another. Definitely a good all round beer. Nothing too fancy, but usually found everywhere. Ole' Reliable Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,mickeymac,3.4,"When you're out on the town and stuck for something decent to drink, you can almost always fall back on Boston Lager. It's got a decent hop kick and more malt flavor than all the US macros. I find it to be a bit cloying after a while, but not overwhelmingly so. This is probably the biggest transition beer out there for people moving away from Bud/Miller/Coors and into something better.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,stoutman,4.05,Deep gold. Medium light body. Mild bitterness. Medium hops. Mild malt. Dry fruity citrus flavors. Silky smooth texture and a rich finish.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,bmills1608,3.95,"Clean amber color with fluffy white head.  Toasty malt background with a real nice herbal-crisp hop balance. One of the best beers ever in terms of balance between malt and hops.  The Classic American, that has earned its respect.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,StevieW,4,"Another sentimental favorite for me. This is the first real beer I drank regulary before exploring everything. I think it is a great beer to introduce friends to the beer world. Nice copper color, fluffy head. Smell is just enough to remind you it's really a beer. Decent hops flavor to start and malty texture. Nice easy finish. I will always order this at restaurants when the only other choices are Bud and Miller, etc. Cheers to the Boston Beer Co. for making a good beer easy to get.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ebraun,4.2,"This was the second micro-brew I ever had, the first being Anchor Steam. They are still the two brews I reach for when I'm craving a big shot of hops. Most folks on this site have probably had Boston Lager and there's nothing I can really add to what's been said about the beer itself, so I'll recommend some food pairings.  Try this beer with full-bodied, spicey or acidic foods. A big bowl of chili will do it for you, tomato-based Italian dishes or chicken marsala would all be quite good with this. The hops and the super-dry finish will help cut the fat of greasy food, so it's a natural for 95% of all pub-grub.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Bighuge,4.13,Crystal clear light amber with mild carbonation evident. Really nice spicy hop tones with what seems like a deep bavarian malt aroma too. A generous white puffy head that has great retention. Really nice malt tones on the palate. Good hop spiciness too (I'm guessing noble hops). Has a firm body. Goes down easy. Great session brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Skywave,4,"It has the hoppiness, bitterness and malt character that no other widely distributed and marketed beer in the US has. I can count on it being in most every decent bar and restaurant when I need a beer with real flavor. Because I have had to default to it so many times I have pretty much burned out on it. There are better beers to be had out there, but SABL is unique and reliable. As for taking it home, it is a bit pricey at the liquor store. there are better micros available for a lower price.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,frank4sail,4.01,Very pale golden color. rich white head. Bright fresh malt nose with a distinct hop presence. Smooth mouth with malty flavor. The finish leaves your mouth with excellent hop balence. Much more complex that the average Lager. It is great to taste a lager with real flavor.. this is a rare quality in an american lager.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Suds,3.87,"Should be called Old-Reliable. You know exactly what you're getting with this beer. A well-made and ubiquitous alternative to tasteless American-style pilsners, Sam Adams Boston Lager is nothing to shout about, but it is (thankfully) a solidly good beer. It seems to be available everywhere now, and from bouquet to finish, this is a pleasant and enjoyable drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,packetknife,3,"This should be the base-line for lagers. It's a meal, a bit sweet, nice color and smell. Probably the first beer I enjoyed. Years ago. And an old favority with Daggs in MN over darts.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,marc77,4,"The dense white head covers a bronze brew that displays excellent well - lagered clarity. The attractive foam lace left adds additional visual appeal. There's a very strong floral Hallertauer Mittelfruh hop nose and the malt aroma is secondary, but mildly toasty Vienna and /or Munich malt notes provide for aromatic experience. The mouthfeel oddly seems a bit oily. The hop bitterness is mild, and the crystal malt sweetness is fairly high and the beer is thus on the sweet side. The pronounced, enjoyable and quinessentially floral and refined Mittelfruh hop flavor is very welcome. The finish is slightly sugary, but with bready malt notes as well. This is the best mass produced lager in America. My only qualms are the lack of hop bitterness / malt sweetness balance and the ""oily"" mouthfeel.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,cokes,4.07,"I agree with many off you, in saying that this is top of the line for an American Pils. Not my favorite style, but I will drink this without any problem or compaints. However, I usually drink this at restaurants when the beer selection is limited. Itpairs well with just about any food. This is the prototypical fall-back bier. Nice rich golden-bronze body. Thin off-white head (tap). The relatively hearty malt body (for a pils) is balanced with a nice spicy hop zest. Doesn't overwhelm in terms of complexities; solid but not dazzling. Makes a nice session, and come through in a pinch when nothing else is available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,proc,4,"An excellent beer. Full flavored, refreshing and heads and shoulders tastier than most macros. A bit pricey in my area $12.99-14.49 a twelve). When fresh, this beer is excellent. The hop taste on the finish gets you like a fish taking a hook. Very enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,aracauna,3.83,"This is good for a lager, the problem is that I don't really care too much for lager. And I hate trying to sound intelligent in my comments on these kinds of beers. It smells like a beer, tastes like a beer and looks like a beer. The only difference is that this tastes like a good beer instead of a bad beer. There's just no complexities that make this beer different enough from your typical lager taste to really talk about. It does have a darker color than most of the American lagers, so that's nice. For readily available American Beers, it's hard to beat.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,jackndan,4.7,"Best every day beer, best introduction to finer beer, best widely available lager, and goes great with a range of great food. I always have a twelve of Sam products on board, and so should you.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Thrasher,3.03,"This was the one. I got hooked during college and never looked back. Opened my eyes to a whole new vista of beer delight. Sam Adams makes a number of styles, but in my opinion they have never bested this. Fresh on tap, there's nothing better. The head leaves lace all down the glass. Delicious aroma, warm piney citrusy flavor, expertly balanced. Infinitely complex, the variety of pleasures this beer provides is endless. This and Brooklyn Lager are my 2 Old Faithfuls.  Update 1/03: I hate to say it but this beer has definitely changed. Dumbed down, less hoppy, not nearly as clean tasting. Still some caramel goodness but mostly bland. I don't know if it's bottles produced at a certain plant or if every SA Boston Lager is as weak as the one I'm drinking, but I've noticed a consistent deterioration for quite some time now. Had a keg on Memorial Day last year; that's the last time I remember the beer being as pleasurable as it was when I first started drinking it. It's a real shame and I hate to be fickle, but I'm finished with this beer, a disappointing shadow of its former self.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,inebrius,3.68,"I was reminded how bad the state of beer in America is with a visit to the local chain restaurant. They even have the nerve to recommend Bud Light with the chicken wings.

35,104,jermar,4.2,"I've always found this beer fascinating because it seems to me to have a strong ale character, body-wise and in its use of hops. Is this what early lagers were like? A great beer to have out there in the market - you can find it at most outlets and social events, and it keeps you from having to drink the other crap they happen to have on hand.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84

35,104,WilliamPhilaPa,4.15,"If I'm not drinking Yuengling and I have a 6 or 7 bucks extra to spend on a case, I usually pick the Boston Lager.Copper/almost amber color to the body w/ a avg. head at the pour. A nice hop presence is there, but it doesn't overshadow the lovely toasted flavor of the malt, which had a small hint of sweetness & bitterness to the finish.Overall a fine session brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,Bierman9,3.58,"Sammy has a nice medium-copper color, and a lovely, frothy head. The nose has a good balance of hops and sweet malt...nice on the tongue but I wish it had a tad more body.... Nice flavor overall, again with a balance of bready malt and Noble hops, but needs a bit more oomph... Back when I was just getting started with ""good"" bier, I thought this bier was right up there. Not so, now....but still a good one to get you in the door...  overall: 3.65 appearance: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 3.5  8",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ZAP,4.4,.This is about as good as it gets for a lager. Good floral hops smell and taste...with a pretty good maltiness for a lager. Crisp..and dryish...thirst quenching but with character not seen in most lagers...if I'm really thirsty I like this over their ale..  I think this is vastly underrated. There are few lagers that can compare.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,AaronRed,4.2,"When is doubt, drink this. It has become a staple here in the Northeast, that you can always fall back on it.

35,104,Jordan,3.86,"Sweet n' Malty. Very slight hops presense here to keep the malt in check. Sweet caramel on the nose. Available everywhere, an enjoyable brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
35,104,ThreePistols,4,"Light golden color, strong white head and lace until the end. Clean maltiness nose with just the right amount of hops.

35,104,Jason,4,"Presentation: 12 oz brown, glass is raised above the label in the signature of Samuel Adams. Label is new, ""It's what's inside"" is under the cap ... beefing up the marketing eh?  Appearance: Light amber with golden hues. The head is rocky, creamy and frothy which sticks to the glass all the way down to the last gulp.  Smell: Good dose of sweetness both from the floral hops and caramel malt. Very aromatic and a pleasure to the nose.  Taste: Sweet malt, a little caramel, with a sublime hop oil flavour which lets through a more than ample bitterness that has a spicy bite to it. A hoppy finish with some residual sweetness and drying grain are in the end.  Notes: A very well crafted brew, enough hops to go around yet still very balanced. Soon to be a classic (first brewed in 1984), an excellent fall back or session beer also.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Vienna Lager,84
