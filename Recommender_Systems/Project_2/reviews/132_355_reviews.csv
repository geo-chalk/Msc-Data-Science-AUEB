Light roast, toffee, pepper, plum flavors. Medium bodied, bitter hoppy aftertaste, good lasting carbonation. Great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,UWDAWG,4.13,"Poured from a 12 ounce can dated 1/16/23 into a tulip glass.  Look- Medium amber, cream colored frothy head, mildly hazy, average head retention, below average lacing.  Smell- Bready, floral, between low and medium strength of scent.  Taste- Sweet biscuit, toasted malt, slight toffee, earthy, high strength of flavor.

Overall this was a malt forward beer with a pleasant flavor profile and mouthfeel resulting in a nice experience.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,1BrewBacca,3.75,"Looks like liquid Topaz with a white head that quickly melts to a thin ring around the glass. I'm more of a Stout gut. Picked this one up as a fill in. Pretty decent, just not my style of brew. Probably got good with a Black And Blue Burger.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hooded,3.49,"12oz can poured into Teku glass. LOOK is orange with 1/3 of an inch of off-white head. Retention is average leaving a thin island of foam. SMELL is medium-low in strength. The smell has brown bread, somewhat sweet malt, a light caramel smell and a light yeast smell. TASTE is medium in strength. I taste a light roastiness followed by a sweet malt flavor. A moderately bitter hop flavor appears that quickly dominates the taste. FEEL is medium. Carbonation is low. Astringency is somewhat above low. It has a fairly dry finish. OVERALL, it's good but I don't like it enough to buy it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Franziskaner,3.81,Deep brown in color with a slightly hazy complexion. There’s a quarter inch brown on top. Light lacing is present. The aroma is of caramel and hazelnuts. I’m tasting caramel and hazelnut. The mouth is approachable and accessible.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,milkshakebeersucks,3.82,"Appearance: Unfiltered deep amber with a large off white head and good lacing. Aroma: Toasted malts and a light touch of spicy hops. Taste: Some caramelized malt sweetness. Hops playing more of a balancing role and less of a dominant one.. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied,. Carbonation is lively. Light lingering bitterness. Overall: Sum is greater that the parts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MackJones33,5,"Delicious for an American maibock. Was not a fan of rogue beer, but this one is delicious, I recommend it, 6.8 and bitterness around 30. Smooth and doesn’t get yoy drunk !!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BitteNochEinWeissbier,3.26,"1.5 x 12 oz bottle Glass: 0.5L Pokal Pouring Temp: 50.6 F   Look: Deep and slightly hazy copper with an initial 2-finger creamy light beige head. The head dissipates to a thin but consistent cover with excellent soapy lacing down the glass.  Smell: Tons of sweet bready malts laced with honey and either toffee or caramel. There is also a subtle earthy note along with hints of floral hops.  Taste: Starts with bready malts and toffee then a strong earthiness asserts itself and dominates the taste. A light bitterness also appears alongside the earthiness and grows throughout the sip.  Feel: Smooth feel. Body is medium with a slight lean towards the lighter side.  Overall: A nice beer full of strong but balanced flavors. It reminds me of an ESB more than a Maibock, but regardless, it is a solid brew.  My ratings reflect how the beer smells/tastes/etc as a Maibock. If this was categorized as an ESB my ratings would be more akin to the following (give or take):  look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Combo: 3.94",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Kiiz,4.45,"L: classic dark whiskey colored beer, light white head. Looks like it belongs on a postcard.  S: gingerbread malts, a little alcohol bite, sweetness, and dark fruits.  T: follows nose, feels very Christmasy. There some pineapple in there too but it’s so well blended it’s hard to tell. Something just stands out I’m not sure what it is.  F: medium- full body. Not heavy, just says hello.  O: felt more like a winter beer than a spring one, but happy to try and enjoy it. This is a local brew and the style isn’t represented enough where I live otherwise I would have tried the style years ago. This nails what I imagine a classic winter/spring hearty food ol beer would taste like.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,riptorn,3.89,"Canned 3 months ago on 10/19/21 Poured into a shaker, small head that thinned out quickly. Minimal lacing, glass might not have been beer-clean. As seen in at least one other review, honey-colored is the best color descriptor. Rising effervescence. Smell is malt, floral and apple Taste is semi-malty with slight grapefruit bite Feel is okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing off-putting. Bitterness balances the taste and feel.  Hard to rate this one. I wish the ""Overall"" rating carried more weight here. Each individual attribute is better than mediocre, but the sum of its parts is much better than one might think if considering each aspect individually. It's a good, solid, well-rounded tasty beer. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, but if I was at the store and on the fence about what to buy and saw it, I'd remember, ""Hey, that was a good one""",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,CobraChicken,3.36,"Everyone keeps saying that this is heavy on the malt. I was expecting a nice malty flavor but was greeted with something a little more akin to an IPA due to the heavy addition of bitter hops. Beautiful honey color and a sweet smell on the pour. I am not an IPA fan, so this wasn’t for me- however, I liked this better than other hoppy beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,BigIronH,4.16,"Pours a beautiful murky caramel. A few fingers of tan bubbly, foam rises and recedes to an off white ring leaving soapy lacing. Nose is green apple, honey, and sweet malt. Taste is honey, oak, roasted malt, biscuit, grass, and lemon. All melding together perfectly to create a truly delightful masterpiece. Feel is silky smooth and very full. Love this and will buy more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,GStone899,3.87,This is an interesting Octoberfest type beer. Smell is of spices and orange peel. Has a full bodied feel. Taste is a bit all over the place. I don't know if this beer wants to be a marzen or a pale ale. You get a bit of honey along with a nice Bock hop taste. Some citrus with coriander. Interesting beer and can't say I've had one quite like this.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,gvickery,3.57,"Dark amber small white head, not much retention. Way to dark for the style. Smells of caramel, brown bread, for the most part it smells good. Tastes initially sweet but a huge hit of bittering hops hits you straight away. The hops completely drown out the malts. A Maibock should be malt forward with the hops way in the background. I can’t say this is a bad beer it’s just not anything like a maibock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Utica_Club_1971,4.1,"From a 12 oz can dated 6/18/21 -- exactly 3 months ago. Purchased at MV Wine & Spirits, Martha's Vineyard. Poured into an ordinary tumbler.  I normally only drink IPAs but decided to give this a shot since this store has increasingly tended to stop stocking my favorite IPAs, which also happen to be inexpensive (Jai Alai, Zombie Dust, Racer 5, etc), and replaced them with beers that go for $21 for a 4-pack. This Dead Guy Ale was something like $12.50 for a sixpack.  Dark amber color, very little head. Smells malty. Actually to this IPA drinker, it smells very, very malty. And sweet. Not much lacing, although I admit that I've never understood why that matters & never pay attention to it. (Full disclosure: the tumbler I'm drinking it from is made of plastic. The horror! The horror!)  The taste is, at first, very malty, like a porter or a stout. But it then yields some complexity, with some of the typical hoppy flavors (grapefruit, pine, etc) asserting themselves. There is a definite temporal aspect. The taste changes over a second or two, as it does in all beers worth drinking.  The mouthfeel is towards the thick, stout side, but it's not as viscous those porters that make you feel like you're drinking a malted milk shake. It's quite pleasant. It's pretty much what I consider perfect texture for a beer, something missing in many IPAs — even the good ones. Carbonation is also at the goldilocks point; not too bubbly, not too flat.  Overall I'd say it's very good. I'm enjoying it. But I don't expect it to buy it again anytime soon because I'm really not a big fan of malty beers. If you like porters & stouts & maibocks, you should read reviews of Dead Guy Ale written by people who like those kinds of beers. They're sure to be more helpful than this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Got some nutty flavor in there and caramel/bread SUPER CRISP, def try this one while your sick with Havana syndrome on a hot day/cool fall evening mouth feel is medium bodied but v pleasant  overall pretty pleasantly surprised, i thought this was gonna be an unbearable hoppy IPA type (i know it's not an IPA) but i would gdef buy this again.  cheers fellas!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Dr_Gonzo,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Has a dark brown/amberish color with more than a finger's worth of creamy head. Good retention and lacing.  Aroma: caramel, toffee, brown/burnt sugar, toasted malts and nuts, vanilla, apples, yeast, and brown bread.  Tastes almost kinda sweet, while also being bready and nutty too more so. Notes from the aroma altogether make this beer. Body is medium-light.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,DrBeergood,3.75,"L: First the can. It's difficult to make him look good on a cooler display. I noticed that the brewery was founded in 1988. It's caramel brown on the pour and moderately active. The bubbles are small and prickly and it's filmy/glossy too.  S: Caramel malty notes with a light brushing of hops.  T: It's almost sweet but pulled back from the brink with a mild IBU rating. (25? 30?). I'm relieved by the lack of nuttiness. Again, it's very malty. There are 5 grains to 1 hop.  F: Heavy, but it has to be to contain all this goodness. It's smooth on the palate, and I wouldn't guess that it was 6.8%.  O: Given the age of the brewery and the ubiquitous-ness of the Rogue™ brand, tracking down the Dead Guy is an easy task. Ask a beer to stock it for you, prepay for your case even. You might not find him on the shelves, but trust me, he is at a warehouse nearby.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TedHead,3.92,"Pours a very pretty translucent copper with a very small tan head. It smells like toasty malts with a decent amount of banana yeast smell to it. The taste is pleasantly malty without being too heavy, too sweet or too bitter. This one goes down like a dream. Overall an exceptional beer and a great example of a maibock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,defunksta,4.25,"2022 Review:  Appearance: Pours a beautiful clear, dark orange to amber color with a strong head. SRM of 13. (4.25)  Aroma: Moderate aromas of caramel initially, but then follows with strong Wheaties, Special K cereal, cereal grains and bread crust. Some toffee & scotch underneath. (4.00)  Flavor: Flavors of caramel and honey upfront. This then turns into a toasted flavor of bread crust, Wheaties, and Special K cereal. Slight spice before a toffee and smooth caramel finish. Some scotch notes linger within. (4.25)  Feel: A full bodied mouthfeel. Not oily, but heavy enough and with respectable carbonation. Leans sweet, but smooth and drinkable. (3.75)  Compared to Schell's Maibock Stag Series 4/12/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More bread crust, Wheaties, cereal. Less smooth caramel and honey.  Compared to Lift Bridge Maibock 4/28/22: Pours a slightly darker color. Stronger aromas. More earthy caramel, floral hops, and sweet bread malt. Less toasted and dry. Winner: Dead Guy (2022 Rating: 4.25) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2021: Appearance: Pours a beautiful clear, dark orange to amber color with a strong head. Not pale at all surprisingly. (4.00)  Aroma: : Strong and malty aromas of rich caramel, toffee, sweet brown brea, brown sugar, syrup, and rich brown malts. Some definite and rich floral and hints of amber citrus notes. Maybe some vanilla cream. underneath. (4.25)  Flavor: The flavors follows with strong an deep brown bread flavors of caramel, toffeee, brown sugar, syrup , and rich and sweet brown bread malts. There's pasry, strudel with a sweet nutty pecan and walnut flavor. Somewhat of a floral and amber citrus note as well. There is a mild hop flavor of amber citrus and maybe apricot? Sweet, yet an appropriately dry, smooth and balanced finish. Hides the alcohol well.  Mouthfeel: A full bodied mouthfeel. Not oily, but heavy enough and with respectable carbonation. Leans sweet, but smooth and drinkable  Compared to Schells' Bock 5/29/21: Pours a lighter and more orange color. Stronger aromas/flavors. More caramel, toffee, sweet bread, amber citrus, and apricot. Less brown bread crumbs, toast, and syrup flavor. Winner: Dead Guy  Overall: This is a delicious beer one of the few I've had from the Maibock style It has an intense and rich caramel and honey flavor. Nice toffee, nuts, and floral and hoppy amber citrus & apricot flavor to support. Less toasted or roasted flavors like other German beers, as expected of the Maibock style. Has a decent body and a background sweetness that is not too overbearing. Sort of reminds me of a maltier and darker Dortmunder. Quite a well balanced brew and incredibly drinkable for a malty beer.

132,355,frankdatank1337,4.04,I tried this beer about 10 years ago. I remembered it being great. You know what? It is! This beer is still great. It's like a porter but lightened up so it's more drinkable. Good stuff.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Randygroves,5,Awesome! Perfect malt and hop combination. Good carbonation and killer bottle design. If you feel like drinking out of a horn or wearing a pirate outfit yelling arrgg.. This is the beer for you. Even puts hair on your chest :-).,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Chocolatefreak,4,"The first maibock I’ve tried. Upfront a slightly sweet malty flavor. The middle flavors are citrus & dark fruits that are very tasty.

132,355,snaotheus,4,"2021-04-21 22oz bottle served in a snulip. I can't find a date on it, which surprises me.  Pours a rich honey-amber, just slightly hazy, with a medium sized head that collapses to little more than a ring with a very thin island. Don't see much in the way of carbonation. Smell is tea, nuts, bread/yeast, maybe a very light toffee.  Taste is a little nutty, a little sweet, a bit more on the roasty/toasty side of the bread, a little bit of tea flavor. I get an earthy kind of bitterness out of it, which is pretty nice.  Mouthfeel is light, clean, but a bit still. Overall, very nice beer.

132,355,RyanK252,3.83,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass  A: Pours copper amber with a frothy khaki head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.  S: Fruity, spicy, bready, toasty, yeasty, slight floral and herbal notes, a hint of oak, and a little toffee and burnt sugar.  T: Fruity esters up front, apple, pear, apricot, orange blossom, and banana, big toasty bready malt, some spice, slight floral and herbal notes, dare I say a bit of oak, and a little toffee sweetness.  M: On the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation.  O: After all these years of saying ""I'll snag that one next time..."" I finally did! Let me just say that maibocks are not a style I'm all that familiar with so I can't really judge it to style.

132,355,Guardado,4.55,"This beer has a great color, even better when drinking it on a sunny day, the taste is very pleasant, some strong hints of caramel and lingering malt. One of my favorite beers with a great design imo (the all black can). The 6.8% abv helps on giving it a great personality, that of a beer you don't want to session (I mean, you can), but to enjoy about 2-3. Definitely one of the greats.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TheBricenator,4,"Look: Semi-clear copper with a good-looking off-white head that slowly settles, leaving good lacing behind Aroma: Warm brown bread, melanoidin, caramel, some fruity esters, and earthy hops Taste: A big, bready, and caramel sweetness hit comes on strong and soon the earthiness and a little melanoidin trickle in as well. Fruity esters linger as the initial malt and hop punch subsides before more caramel-sweetened bread close it out Mouthfeel: Full, clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and fairly soft on the finish Overall: I dig it. This is probably the beer that put these folks on the map for a lot of people and though not ‘true-to-style’ as a Maibock (starting with the fact they call it an ale), it’s solid and well-made enough to thoroughly enjoy.

It's weird that I haven't reviewed (or even rated) this one yet as it's one of the beers I cut my craft brew teeth on. Anyway, it pours a clear copper with visibly active carbonation and minimal head. Smells nice and malty. Tastes very malty as well; lots of caramel without being too sweet. Fresh brown bread too. On the more robust side of medium-bodied and not as carbonated as it appears; a little too chuggable. No demerits for that, though; at least not from me!

Moderate head that dissipated quickly. SMELL: strong floral—WAIT! Note to self: start using unscented hand lotion—with no hands, and snuffIing through my hay fever, a slight floral note in addition to a detectable clean ale scent. TASTE: fun balance of malt, sweetness, and hops, with a touch of something...fruity-floral. Interesting. FEEL: moderately creamy, somewhat crisp; maybe maibocks don’t go in for a lot of carbonation?

Beer is dark orange amber, mostly clear, and forms an ample head. Flavor is moderate, with a chalky hop bitterness supported by a robust German style male profile.

132,355,PathofChaos,4.16,"Appearance: Dead Guy is a Maibock, more commonly known as the beer served during Oktoberfest. Appropriately, its color is an autumnal, yellow-orange that makes me think of pumpkins, bonfires, and Halloween. The head is a shy froth of pale cream taupe. Little retention and even less lacing.  Bouquet: Leads with a moist, doughy aroma, like opening a fresh loaf of white bread. Beyond that, the sharper noses among you may find crisp green apple with a drizzle of honey and hop spiciness smoothed over by malts.  Feel: A plushy medium with a plucky fizz at the finish. A uniquely autumn quality I can’t quite identify settles in for a good linger. But perhaps that’s only my fond memories of a enjoying a quality Maibock on a cool, dry, October afternoon.  Taste: Malts, mildly spiced hops, and creamy cashew butter. A secret kiss of candy apple sweetness lingers in the aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hophazzard,3.86,A tad too sweet for my liking. It's very good and I can certainly enjoy one but would have a hard time drinking anymore in one sitting.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,UristMcBrewer,4.57,"The beer is a nice amber with a tan head. The head doesn't last too long, but it is an otherwise pretty beer. It is rich on the nose. It is full of caramel malt notes as well as hints of spice. It is sweet to drink, but not cloying due to just enough hops. The spiciness carries over, in part due to the hops and in part due to the ale nature of this bock. It is a very good malt forward beer that doesn't leave the hops of yeast-created flavors behind. The mouthfeel is smooth but not too fizzy. Overall, a great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,MagicJeff,3.55,"Look: Not much of a head. cloudy copper body  Smell: Fresh doughy bread. Some slight citrusy hop notes--actually picking up some green apple and some slight flower petal notes  Taste: Honey malt. Slight caramel almost. Slightest boozy burn/spice on finish.  Feel: Medium to almost light medium; kind of seems watered down in the body--much lighter to me than what I expected given the ABV.  Overall: This beer is decent but I think it would be a lot better fresh and on draft. In fact, I think a lot more qualities would be present and detectable if I could drink a fresh draft pint. I will be seeking this one on tap (one day...sigh).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Josh_McIntire,4.85,"I got a 6 pack of cans this past weekend, and I was completely surprised by this beer. I am a huge fan of dark beers and randomly buy new ones to try all the time. Carmel was the first note i got from the beer followed by either a coffee or chocolate flavor that checked off every mark for me. It was heavier mouth feel then I was expecting, which is a plus. As far as appearance, i couldn't comment as I broke a cardinal rule. I pulled the first on out of the cooler, tasted it, and proceeded to smash them and never poured one in a glass. It's definitely a beer that will be joining my ""keep in stock"" list in my beer fridge.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,JohnniEMc,4.03,"Maibocks run to the sweet side and this is no exception. I don't generally prefer sweet beers. This is the epitome of a malty one and it's not bad. It looks a little weak, a head that doesn't last long and almost no residue lacing. It does bring a nice sweet hoppy aroma. The taste runs sweet, but not overly and there is a pretty nice malt/hop balance here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Rug,4.15,"Canned 10/11/19  Pours a beautiful honey amber with 3 fingers of off-white head that slowly fades to a cap, moderate lacing  Super sweet and malty smell, definitely some honey, caramel, and dark fruits present with also a slight pepper note. Some hopping holds up well to the sweetness, hopefully that comes through in the taste  Heavy on the malt as I expected, but I am pleasantly surprised how the hops work here, crushing the initial attenuated sweetness into bitter territory, before bringing it back to a flavorful and sweet toasted coconut on the finish, a bit of spice as well. More complex than I was expecting  Medium bodied and rich, this finishes pretty dry for what it is but not overly so, refreshing as all hell  Wow, I'm pretty floored by this one. Relatively cheap, complex, and refreshing. This would be great with some food on a summer day, and I can see myself having a regular stock of this going",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MichaelBorg,4.58,"A great example of a maibock ale. Drinking from a 12 oz. can, (great packaging design btw) but the flavor is still strong and quite lovely. Heavy notes of Toffee, and Roasted Malt, with a heavy nutty and hoppy finish. Low IBUs give a very session-able brew. Love it!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,IHateIPAs96,4.11,Acquired from the local discount market. Pours a nice honey tea color. Taste is sweet but not too sweet and hides the 6.8 abv well. Decent head. Good lacing. Very good beer.

I don’t know if that’s a bias we should disclose lol,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,tucson_brewson,4.11,"I've seen this everywhere and finally decided to give it a try. Pint can (Canned 10/14/19) into an imperial pint glass.  L - Pours a slightly hazy copper amber color with about two fingers of slightly-off white head that leaves a generous lacing and sticks nicely to the glass. Decent retention, low carbonation.  S - Biscuit malt, caramel, honey, dried fruit (raisin, apricot), molasses, some earthy hops but mostly sweetness.  T - Follows the nose with malt and caramel up front, vanilla, dried fruit, some citrus, and the sweetness is balanced nicely with bitter earthy hops and a slight metallic/alcoholic bite towards the end.  F - Medium-bodied, light carbonation, fairly smooth and creamy, finishes fairly light but has a good warming quality, due to the slightly higher-than-average ABV.  O - I haven't had many maibocks up to this point, but from what I've read, this seems to be a decent representation. Malty sweetness is balanced with bitter hops, it's not too sticky sweet and is very balanced.

Look: hazy golden/amber with an inch thick white head  Aroma: modest aroma of bread, tea, citrus  Taste: The flavor is like toasted bread, caramel, it is fairly sweet, and has a significant tea like hop bitterness at the end.

132,355,TheGreatCthulhu,4.58,"Another beer review because, why not?  This time, we're going to review one of the beers that's in my top 10 list, Dead Guy Ale by Rogue Ales.  Is it good? Let's find out!  CLASSIFICATION:  It's an ale, specifically created in the style of a German maibock beer, which is a more hop-centric style of German bock beer.  But let's get rid of the nerdy stuff and look at the stuff that matters, shall we?  COLOR:  A nice golden amber color, with a nice, creamy, off white head. Sticks around for a while before dissipating to a fine lace.  NOSE:  Not much on the nose surprisingly. Hints of sweet malt, biscuits, hops, and citrus.  BODY AND PALATE:  The hops are nice and upfront. It's bitter initially, but then you get sweet caramel and sweet malt flavors, with a hint of dark brown sugar. The feel is also smooth, with a nice feeling carbonation that just goes down easy. Very light and refreshing feeling.  FINISH:  Shortish. It has a malty aftertaste.  CONCLUSION:  Overall, for a nice beer that is hoppy without the hops being overpowering, and balancing out the bitter flavor of the hops with sweet notes really gives this a nice, balanced flavor that's just an easy sipper.  Also, at 6.8% ABV, it's decently strong.  Overall, I give it 9/10. It's great.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BGDrock,3.99,"Body like an amber jewel, glimmering; covered with an airy, sawdust coloured head that forms well, but fades out in a minute. Nose is toffee, caramel malt, fruit cake, raisins, prunes. It's a winter warmer, with big caramel malt flavours, lighter butterscotch, rum-soaked raisin cake, dried fruit. Sugary and sweet, but with some balancing hops in the finish cutting through just enough to prevent it from being cloying. Medium-heavy body, medium carbonation. Full, silky feel.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Leeloy,4.65,"Certainly in the Maibock category. This beer has a malty profile and flavor, golden brown colour , clear, stable head and finishes with slight hoppy notes.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,weissbock,2.31,"Even though i concider rogue to to one of my fave brewers of craft beer, this maibock doesn't do it for me! very little flavor, hops a bit over the top for style imo. not malt forward as should be! very overated. a buddy and i used to joke? that this was a beginners journey into bock beer! Andygater beats it all week long! At least the abita has some complexity! this is a mainstream one trick pony at best. better than bud, Miller, coors,etc... but why all the hoopla? We always suggest calsburg as a virgin travel into better beer, calsburg is quite drinkable compared to this stuff! but tastes vary so if you like dead guy, great.....the worst beer i ever brewed was more interesting, again... different strokes i guess! my faves? aventinus wheat dopplebock, eku28, Salvatore dopplebock per helles bock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,hof_1991,4,Nice example of the style. Drinkable with no hint of alcohol. Maybe not as full of flavors as some beers but I liked its straight forwardness. Would drink again. BTW I had it on tap so no comments on it in a can.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,whitness,1,If you're looking for a more expensive Bud Light then this beer is for you! The smell & taste are very close to that of bud light and the color is bit deeper than it. This beer had no flavor.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,klarcbarr3,4.19,"As I have gained knowledge and appreciation over the years, my tastes have changed. I have evolved from Bud to Sam Adams to Pete's Wicked, to a great variety of dark, sweet beers. As much as I love Pumpkins, Stouts, Porters, and Holiday Ales, I now consider Rogue Dead Guy to be my go to American Ale. I know, it is their spin on a classic German Maibock.. but it is also the closest thing I regularly drink to a crappy American lager. Dead Guy has a deep honey amber color I would love to stain my floors with. There is depth to the body, and a robust, balanced sweet/savory taste that just begs you to drink it. There is decent head, and lacing, for those of you who care about such trivialities. To me, the test of a great beer is taste, and Rogue Dead Guy has it in spades. I love this beer, all year round!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,branham1989,4.09,Rogue Ales Dead Guy Ale 6.8% ABV 40 IBU. This Ale pours a deep golden amber color with a finger width slightly off white colored head that lingers for a bit before leaving some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of malts with hints of citrus and caramel overall a pretty sweet aroma. The flavor is very malt forward with hints of toffee and caramel and dark brown sugar before it finishes with a slightly hoppy bitterness to help counteract the sweetness of the malts. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking I wish it was more creamy but the carbonation level is perfect. 7.5/10,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Earthy, almost vegetabley, and alluring. Perfectly balanced. Mild hops, little bitterness, and fully malted, but refreshing all the same. Great beer. EDIT: out of the can this beer is completely different from the tap. Just a solid red ale in the can, not nearly as special.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jynormiss,4.03,I dont usually like ales but this one is definitely making me more interested in exploring the style. Beautiful deep honey colour with a nice off white head that dropped quickly to a fairly persistent collar. Smells like sweet malt with some spice.

Fantastic!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some dark brown sugar also. Dries out some but overall sweet and rich.  Feel.....seems a bit thinner but a medium body and slight slick oil feel  Overall......I have seen this beer out there for many many years but just now trying. I didn't realize it was a maibock.

It has a really nice, slightly fruity scent. The flavor is earthy, with a bit of a bite, good malt flavor, and not too much aftertaste. The mouthfeel has some fizziness.  Having tasted many craft beers since, it's still my favorite ale. Sure, I may enjoy the flavor of a good Belgian style Tripel more, but the alcohol content keeps me from drinking those very often. And I prefer something lighter in flavor with a meal. But if I just want to relax with a good brew? Dead Guy all the way, baby!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste is sweet malts with a slight kiss of hop bitterness on the finish. Actually reminds me of an Oktoberfest. The more I drink, the more the spice note comes through.  Mouthfeel is a bit light and the carbonation seems low which, to me, detracts from the overall enjoyment.  I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would after I poured it.

132,355,Lingenbrau,4.02,"Can't believe it's taken me over 15 years to review one of my gateways. Long overdue.  Dead Guy pours a lovely burnt orange with great clarity and an impressive off white foam that coats the glass from head to toe.  A rediculous amount of caramel and bready malts rise from the surface. Some dark fruits and woody, spicy hops give this almost the impression of a Barleywine. Lighter, obviously.  Flavor follows nicely with an abundance of caramel and orange marmalade slathered on some biscuits. It cuts quickly over into nutmeg like spice, then once again with the herbal, woody, spicy hop finish.  It's a medium, bordering fuller bodied beer, though seems masked by a lively carbonation that lifts the spices giving it a bit of a tingle. Pretty well balanced with an abrupt flip flop from sweet to bittere. There's even a touch of warmth noticed as the sticky, bittered finish draws it to an end.  Still, after all these years, Rogue Dead Guy is a respectable beer. A great fall beer on a drizzly day for sure. One beer that year after year I seem to still reach for on occasion. A little confusing to why they went with an ale format when Maibocks are lagers, but that's nitpicking. Cheers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,HoppingMadMonk,3.42,"Cloudy dark amber color . Body is just a little thin with just above average carbonation ,overall it was a below average feel . Aroma is a syrupy malty, molasses sugary smell . There is a mild , hoppy, grapefruit aroma that doesnt really fit the rest of this beers profile . Taste is very malty, to the point of it washing out any other flavors. After the maltiness theres a grapefruit mild bitterness that lingers for awhile . Overall it is an okay beer but the dominant maltiness made it difficult to enjoy .",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mehak,2.58,Nice amber color. Smells of grapefruit. Has an odd grapefruit bitter sweet taste. Too bitter and grapefruity for me. Light body. Overall I am disappointed but I am not a grapefruit/bitter-citrus fan.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This beer smells pretty malty, kind of a syrupy smell. Taste is incredibly smooth, sweet and malty. every time I take a sip I expect a slight bitter bite but never get it, kind of trips me out each sip for some reason.

Look wasn't great, basically looks exactly like apple juice with a tiny head an no lacing at all anywhere.  Aroma is a bit like caramel apples honestly. Really, really sweet.  Taste is a lot better, more toasted, bready malts to balance the fruity sweetness. They really nailed it here.  Feel is pretty light for the ABV, easy, good bitterness to balance the sweetness.  Very well done all around. A uniquely-styled ale. Will be picking more up for sure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,VoxRationis,3.17,"Served into a 16 oz (473 ml) conical pint glass and Tony C's Sports Grill & Bar in Burlington, Massachusetts. A: Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color with a no more than quarter inch, white head which quickly dissipates to a very large bubble (think soda pop) rim and some soapy lacing. S: Aroma is very limited. Really had to dig for it, but perceived apple, pear, and caramel with maybe (maybe) a black licorice note. T: Dry. Caramel and pear flavors predominate, but really more watery than malty. Licorice bitterness stronger than supported by the level of malt or flavor. Tingling, bitter aftertaste. M: Light bodied with low to moderate effervesce. O: Let me say, this is drinkable, if not by any stretch of the imagination the best representative of the Maibock style. Not malty enough, too bitter, and simply too watery. it were described as a ""light"" Maibock, perhaps that would make more sense. If it were a soda, one would think it had been watered down. I will try to see if there is a difference when it is decanted from out of a relatively fresh bottle. Really a disappointment.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The flavor is firmly sweet, with toasted bread and raw malt being the predominant flavors. I suppose the hops are still around, but they scared. A hint of the floral. The body is medium-weight, a little sticky, a little coarse, but whereas these would be flaws in other beers, in conjunction with the flavors they seem wholly apropos. Yeah, this is a legit beer.

132,355,DangerousDanBrewery,4.83,"Been drinking this beer since 1990 when it was only available in the large bottles (22-oz. I think). Used to buy it at a grocery store in McCloud, CA when I would fish the McCloud River. Was the only place I could get it back then. Iit was always a ""special beer"" because I lived about 6-hours away from the closest place that had it. Really enjoy the aroma, taste, feel, and finish of this beer. Since I can now get it locally in Washington state, I have some in my fridge right now and am considering home brewing some of this myself.  Not a beer judge by a long shot but this beer hits it on all accounts. The aroma is very inviting and makes you want to taste it. The tasted is full but not heave. Good head with nice lacing as you drink it. Certainly plenty of hops in there but the blossoming of the malts keeps it from being overwhelming. Has what I would call a medium mouthfeel to it. Not as light as a lager and not as heavy as an ouatmeal stout can be. But you know you are drinking it. The finish seems to be both slightly bitter and sweet. What I would call dry without being bitter.  This is one of my favorite beers. I always thought this was expensive until I visited Australia this year. They drink a LOT of beer and a ""cheap beer"" is $19 for a six pack. Most good beers are $24 to $29/six-pack. So now I treat my self to Dead Guy Ale without batting an eye at the $12.99 per 6-pack price.

With warmth there’s a dry white grape aspect that comes in.  A clean slightly grainy malt opening, one which brings the earthiness of the nose in early.

132,355,monkist,4.76,"I had this beer years ago for the first time. It still had this color label (like up there), the one I had now was already the blackout version. The first time I wasn’t se well-versed in bocks yet and although neither am I even now, I do believe that I have a different, hopefully a somewhat better appreciation of a fine brew. And this one: looks good, smells good, tastes good and feels good! My re-evaluation, interesting enough, changed only two things: I scored down its looks with .25 and its aroma up with .25 points, meaning that the overall score has stayed the same. What I did notice though, is that as a bock it’s less overwhelming than the German original, not as sweet and not as boozy, but since it’s an American masterpiece it is very densely hopped and it smells very fruity, and actually tastes so too. There is a slight booziness in its character but the body and mouthfeel isn’t that heavy and it isn’t as syrupy as your average bock, at the same time it is definitely a bock and shares its quite typical characteristics. What stood out for me the most is the fruity hoppiness and the drinkability of this beer. The first time I had it, it felt very unique - and it still does, even with plenty of experience in the bag. It is quite a good beer, and I’d like to try the whiskey they made out of it too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The pour yields mildly hazed orange amber color with thick off-white creamy head that withstands with good retention before gradually subsiding to a decent layer of foamy crown and leaving plenty of lacing ring and patch.  In a nose, creamy, bready, honey, buttery, toasted, nut, and caramel, all from malt mingle with good hop character ranging from spice, floral, earthy, and some exotic fruit.  Spice, fruity, floral, and earthy hop get along well with caramel, toasted, buttery, honey, and sweet bready malt together with a significant cut of bittering hop to balance and add more well-rounded deliciousness to the taste buds.  Medium body with some good crisp and lively carbonation through the palate that generates fine smoothness, finish is dry.

132,355,steveh,2.83,"With the new Maibock tasting thread scheduled, and all of the inevitable discussion about Dead Guy and the debate over its style niche, I went on the hunt for some DG -- and almost failed to find some, but Rogue's BeerFinder helped out.  I drank this stuff a lot back in the early days of the Micro Boom®, but I've never reviewed it. With my enthusiasm for German-style beers, I could never understand why Rogue called this a Maibock. These days I see they're just calling it an Ale ""inspired"" by Maibocks, not sure how to rate it, but I'll follow BA's listing.  12 ounce bottle poured into my short Becher glass. No bottle dating to be found. 6.8% ABV now listed on the label.  L -- Clear, deep amber color with a dense and creamy, cream-colored head that holds up well.  S -- Caramel and earthy malt notes up front, warm-fermented fruit esters with warming, spicy, herbal hop notes and peppery alcohol back.  T -- Caramel sweetness with peppery alcohol and herbal, bitter hops. Citrus, peach fruit esters follow the bitterness, but the bitterness dominates the aftertaste.  F -- Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy with a dry, almost astringent finish and medium to light-robust body.  O -- This beer is reminiscent of a Maibock in color only. The strong hoppy bitterness, caramel malt character, and fruit esters are more akin to an American take on a Strong Bitter -- and not a terribly bad one at that, but stand this up to a Hofbräu Maibock (probably the most robust Maibock available) and the contrasts would be glaringly obvious. Re-categorize this as a Strong Bitter -- or better, an American Amber Ale and I'll alter my scores.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Twinhammers,4.43,"L - Lovely golden and slightly oily. Not the showiest head but let's not mistake that for lack of personality.  S - Vibrant and lively, with a dual assault of malt and a sneaky bit of citrus.  T - Hops, hinted at in the nose, display themselves more fully here. These give way to a brisk pineyness, if there is such a thing.  F - Less active than might be expected from a beer of this color...and also, for Rogue especially, a very dry finish, but not too quickly.

Tiny amount of alcohol warmth adds a comforting impression, with something spicy and lively rising from the hops. As it warms, aromas of candied fruit and more intense crusty and toasty tones are more evident. Sweet, dynamic and wonderful.  Toasted bread is the first impression on the palate. Hop bitterness on the upswing. Herbal and peppery hops make a nice match for the slightly sweet and heartening malt. Finish is a nice mix of satiating bread and a lingering, piquant bitterness. Aftertaste mostly made up of said bitterness. This may be the only room for improvement in this brew.  Medium body, medium carbonation. All in harmony with the flavors of this Maibock. Slight EtOH warmth and dryness in the finish make for a substantial end to each sip.  Very delicious beer. Warm and inviting on the nose, and then a pleasant smack to the tongue.

132,355,Beginner2,3.84,"Popular and interesting for similar reasons. Hugely popular because it is pleasant; yet it innovates the style. I understand that Dead Guy -- out of necessity -- emerged because production needed lagering tanks for other brews and this one took too long. So for the next batch, an ale yeast was used. Hence the fruitiness and dryness uncommon to clean lagers. Necessity is the Mother of Invention.  Listed in the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die"" and reviewed by Randy Mosher, one of Chicago's dean of brewing. He calls it an altbier. And he has a point: it does not have a lager's clean taste. But most agree: it is an experiment that worked very well and has been Rogue's cash cow so it can bring us so many more interesting brews.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smells like caramel, toffee, booze, a little tart. Despite being an ale, does indeed taste like a bock. Caramel, dates, acceptable tartness throughout, only light herbal to tea-like bitterness, some alcohol character seeping through. Medium-bodied, tingly, sudsy, not too crisp. This is an Amber Ale, not a Maibock. Could also almost pass for a decent quality English Pale Ale.

132,355,gamesjunkie,3.66,"Not much to say about this one. It gets a lot of hype as being amazing, but I wasn't overly impressed. Slightly floral, earthy and spicy. Tastes good, but not great.

132,355,Martine,3.94,"Pours hazy amber-copper from a 330ml bottle into a tulip glass with initial large white head a finger high, moderate retention, and minimal lacing.  Nose is mellow and sweet with subtle caramel, malt, bread, and cereal grains. There's a just a hint of creaminess to this ale, and something a little herby/spicy underneath it all.  Initially the taste is very caramel/malt forward with plenty of sweetness, honey, cream, gooseberries, and earth. Those fruity earthy flavours come through more on the swallow and linger into the aftertaste moreso than the grainy flavours. Somethng akin to nectar and elderflower comes through very strong towards the end, giving the beer a secondary sweetness, and bringing those floral flavours full circle.  It feels light-medium bodied with low carbonation, and has a slight mouth-coating quality to it which dries up fairly quickly.  I've never had anything like this before, it's a very sweet beer but it doesn't shove it in your face either, quite reasonably balanced with those floral and earthy notes keeping it grounded. Nice beer, different, but very sessionable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,zDeen,3.89,"Pours a nice cloudy copper color with little to no head. Smells somewhat caramely and bready but my sinuses are messed up thanks to all the blooming trees!! The taste is exceptional with a nice balance of malt and hops, I think it starts on the sweet side and ends slightly bitter, however the sweet taste is more prominent overall. The medium bodied, crisp feel really serves as a nice transition from heavy beers of the winter to the summer ales and light beers that dominate hot weather. IMHO this beer is amazing on draft, one of the best I've ever had. It is still good out of the bottle but not quite the same.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Not much to smell hop-wise, with all aromas coming from malt and even then there is traces of biscuit and carmel. Tastes like a dryer, stronger amber beer. Definite notes of orange. Hop taste is minimal, faint earthy floral hops but that is really reaching. Great mouthfeel, a little more dry than I'd expect but easy to drink; never knew it was 6.5% until I was done with it!

There's abundant fast moving bubble activity. The beer looks great in the glass.  Slightly sweet malt aromas, caramel, toasted fruit bread, and biscuits. I look for hops and find malts.  It tastes like above with the addition of malted milk balls sans the chocolate. Is that a floral hop or so that I'm picking up? Yes, some candied fruit, too.  Bold body with a smooth feel.

Overall, this is the type of ale I enjoy: well crafted with lots of flavors, substantial but at the same time easy to drink. This ale would pare well with a hearty meal of pork or beef, or for casual drinking with friends. Very good!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Good clean glass - good start  Smells like feet - typical for a chum-swillin ale  Such a great hearty malt taste - almost salty as well as sweet  Wonderfully smooth and even-bodied goin down  Don't think I'll ever get tired of it - prefer it on tap as it is not as consistent in bottles (and almost as expensive!)  I don't know what that's about, if I can get Lagunitas all day long from 650 miles away for $10 a six, why can't I get Dead Guy from 90 miles away for any less than $12?

132,355,Back_in_the_Saddle,4.22,"Ah, the famous Dead guy ale coming from Rogue. I believe this was their flagship ale at one time, unsure if it still is, but not a seasonal Maibock but one sure to please the maltheads with a valid sessionability sure to have with food. Pouring this into a mug, there's a gentle hazy pale burnt orange color with a thin white head that settles atop of and gently dissipates at a nice pace leaving some clingy lace gliding here and there around the glass. The smell absorbs a sweet bready aspiring maltiness running the gamut upon caramel, toast and toffee aromas. Light citrus flexes nicely in the blend. The taste sparks up with the sweetness of the bready and biscuity malts slightly allowing the citrus to come back and make their way into a sly aftertaste. Dry on the finish, this beer doesn't let one step away without feeling quite settled as the mouthfeel makes one feel quite satisfied in knowing that there's a nice full feel here yet still has the ability to stand with its respected food. Would I have this again? Of course I would, what other Maibock/Helles lager in the American market can be found anywhere I go and be a great pairing with its respected food?

132,355,SaltofOH,3.78,"Bottle, no date. DFH Tulip.  Appearance: Pours a straight up hazy amber, with 1/2 finger uneven tan head that quickly dissipates. Virtually no lacing. Below-average retention; retains a ring of froth around the edge, but not really anything on top. Should have a persistent head and be clear; it is neither - in fact there was quite a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle which is now haze in the glass.  Smell: Toasty malt; sweet caramel; really smells like an amber ale; noble hoppiness; remarkably like the Bell's Amber I had last night (and love dearly!). Interesting that I am told that Bell's is hopped with Wilamette and Cascade, while this is hopped with Perle and Saaz, and smells almost exactly alike. A testament to the overpowering and complex malt aroma. Another commenter mentioned bananas, and after re-approaching this, I can't help but smell overripe bananas.  Taste: Malty arrival, complex; there is a lot going on in the layers of malt here; finish is not exactly clean; a little slick and caramel malty, with some medicinal hoppiness and very slight citric tang.  Mouthfeel: Fairly high carbonation, but not excessive. Slick; heavier side of midweight. Not a very clean finish, particularly for posing as a Maibock. Really this is a failure as a Maibock. This is suffering from its category.  Overall: I know this is supposed to be a Maibock, but it is utterly apparent from the smell, and from the taste, that this is an amber ale afraid of the pejorative name. Well it is an amber ale, and I love amber ales, and it is good beer (though not as good, if you ask me, as Bell's Amber or Lagunitas Censored). It's a malt bomb worth a yearly revisit. It is absolutely not a Maibock; graded as an Amber Ale, this would be 4+.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

It has a nice fruitiness, and as a whole it works well in a hot climate such as Thailand, but just is lacking a few elements that could push it over the top and make it a more interesting beer. Rogue has made a huge push in the last few years into bars in Bangkok, so Dead Guy is something I often drink, tho wouldn't if I lived in most other places in the world. Generally, of the beers available here, Leffe or Hoegaarden is better value and both are available draft whereas Rogue is bottle only. I expect that situation will be changing soon as the thaw on SE Asian factory lager monopolies (Singha, Tiger, Chang) is on in this country in a big way, finally.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RogueDave,5,"This one took me a little while to get into. At first, I did not like it at all. The only reason I even tried it again was because it was the only beer available one night when I got off work. My roommate had the fridge stocked with Dead Guy, so I had a couple with him and it slowly started to grow on me. When I went to the Rogue brewery in Newport (I used to live in Oregon) and had it on tap, I was hooked. Now, it's one of my favorites. The only thing I do not like about it now is how damn expensive it is, especially here in New York (where I have lived for about seven years now).  Overall, I enjoy the dark flavor of Dead Guy and do not find it at all bitter. It is a good balance of flavor similar to a light porter but with the complexity of a stout (when had on tap). Warning: once it begins to get warm, the flavor turns on you and it becomes very unpleasant. I find all Rogue ales are better had cold.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,BethanyB,3.86,"Look: A cloudy, but pretty amber/orange, with a huge and fluffy cream colored head. The only flaw here is the clarity, but for a Maibock, that's an issue.  Smell: A gentle bouquet. An uncharacteristic smell of citrus hops pairs up with caramel malt to create a perfume of mandarin oranges. It's certainly unique. Definitely intriguing. Tells me I'm in for an atypical Maibock.  Taste: Much more to style. The malt is complex and sweet, yet gentle. Buttered biscuits, toast, and a drizzle of caramel. A light bitterness sneaks in. Unfortunately, while it doesn't detract from the beer, neither does it add anything. Some floral hop notes are better at bringing interest.  Mouthfeel: Light and smooth, with little carbonation. A watery quality created more problems than one, as it drowns out the flavor. Here is where the beer falls much too short for my taste.  Overall: With a skeleton logo and a menacing name, it's hard to believe this is going to be an everyday Maibock. And everyday it's not, particularly due to the fruity characteristics. Still, it's bland, even with the notable malt complexity. The watery nature of the mouthfeel makes it even more so. After a while, boredom sets in, as you begin to feel like you're drinking tampered-with tap water.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This is one of the only Rogue beers distributed in Chicago that I know of, so I've had it a few times, but for this review, I'm pouring from a can into a pint glass. Pours a deep orange/amber with minimal off-white head. Smells fruity and hoppy! First sip is fruit punch with a sour bite. Notes of cherry, orange, and crisp hops up front. As the beer warms, an amaretto flavor opens up. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety–not too dry or thin. Just right! Overall, Dead Guy is a great anytime beer. The sour bite and amaretto flavor adds excellent character to this almost sessionable beer. Definitely a great introduction to Rogue and the Maibock style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,johnnnniee,3.17,"Pours a slightly cloudy orange/amber with a big fluffy white head. Smells of citrus and floral hops, a bit of a mineral smell as well. Not much going on really in the nose. Taste is a little better with some sweet malts caramel and bread mixed up with some floral hops and that mineral tartness. Sparkling carbonation, sticky mineral-y mouthfeel, medium body.

132,355,doktorhops,4.09,"This being my first Maibock EVA* I will be referring to the Beer Judging Certification Program (and “yes” that is a real thing) style guidelines on what a Maibock should look, smell, taste and feel like... no pressure Rogue, just go about your day knowing that my keenest eye/nose/tongue will also be backed up with actual beer review knowledge instead of the stuff I usually make up along the way. Oh yeah and before you ask “Aaannnother Rogue?!” in that annoying whiny tone as you always do, this will be the last Rogue *checks fridge* I review in a while.  Poured from a 650ml bottle into a Stein.  A: Hazy amber body with a large but reasonably dense 1 inch off-white head on top. BJCP would prefer it clearer, lighter coloured and whiter (for the head that is). 6/10.  S: Honey, caramel malts, hints of butteriness (Diacetyl), bread middle and dark fruit Esters in the background... this is much more Doppelbock than Maibock (aside from the colour). BJCP poo-poos Diacetyl and Esters should be low to none (their words not mine - I actually like this aroma). 8/10.  T: More honey than caramel in the flavour with notes of butterscotch, bready mid-palate, earthy/herbal hops and some light spice notes in the finish, which is slightly dry but with a medium bitterness from the earthy/herbal hops. Quite a clever brew this Dead Guy Ale, with a modicum of bitterness hedging off the overly sweet honeyed aspect. If BJCP were a person I think he/she would like this, though with a disapproving mention that this Maibock isn’t to style. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied with a light but sharp and tingly carbonation. Not bad BJCP, not bad at all. 7/10.  D: Well, I am sold on Maibock’s - the lighter and hoppier version of Doppelbocks. This Rogue happens to be one of the best Rogues I’ve had so far (and I’ve had like 8-9 of their brews now) and the bottle was deceptive because I looked at it and thought “Pfft, glows in the dark, f**k off” but the brew within ist köstlich, to coin a German term. Question is: Does the now anthropomorphised (by me) BJCP like it? “BJCP says: yes” We have a winner! 8/10.  Food match: Schweinebraten with bread roll Knödeln and cabbage salad, a classic Bavarian delicacy.  *Or Extravehicular Activity - as I like to refer to my reviews, but it’s also something astronauts do while they’re in space.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Aroma is sweetly malty, fresh dark bread, and faint spice notes.  Flavor is sweet up front, very rich caramel and brown sugar notes. toasted bread and pleasantly nutty bitter flavors coming in after, leading a lingering, slightly dry finish, with a bit of old-world style spicy hops at the end.  Mouthfeel is slightly thick and oily, with moderate carbonation cutting through a bit. Just substantial enough, without being over-heavy.

Smell - Butterscotch, slight bit of tropical fruit. Enticing but the nose isn't terribly potent.  Taste - Some bitterness up front with and earthy butterscotch and creamed corn undercurrent. Overall pretty mild, but quite tasty and drinkable.  Mouthfeel - Reasonably well carbonated, leaves a tingling sensation in the mouth. Medium-light bodied.

132,355,BeerDrinkersWorldTour,3.96,"Appearance – Deep honey colour with an ample amount of head that is between rocky and shaving foam in consistency. The head is around a finger in height and there is loads of Co2 streaming in the glass the head dies and leaves a decent lace cover that lightly dust the glass as you drink.  Smell – A lot of sweet malt almost caramel like, but some great sour tones from the yeast very, very mild pine hop which leans towards something like the faint waft of a distant spruce forest. Taste – Pretty hoppy up front more so that I had expected based on the aroma. Malty smells do eventually translate into the taste but it takes a while as the taste develops and the olfactory senses adjust to this interesting brew. The sourness of the yeast comes through well. This beer is a bit of a journey or even a trip in a haunted house at the fayre (In a good way). The hop kicks first then as your buds calm down the malt presents itself, there is a constant under current of yeast and finally the whole experience comes full circle to final hop flourish. Mouth feel – Very smooth but oddly cloying at first it eventually subsides to something mild and neither dry or cloying but also sadly lacking real punchy linger. Overall – Pretty dang good and a nice match up with a tasty salad dressed with white wine vinegar dressing this one is a real summer brew and has nice developing flavour that makes it interesting to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Brutaltruth,4.18,"The legend. Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass. Ale pours a light hazy copper with orange hues and a tight beaded white foam head that lightly dies down to a thin layer with nice lacing. Nose of caramel malts, biscuit, and light earthy hops. Flavors explode with waves of caramel, toffee, and fresh bread flavors to all sides being rounded out by nice bittering hops. Smooth mouth feel and great carbonation makes this one a highly quaffable ale with a light bitter sweet finish. If you feel jaded towards Rogue wait a little bit and try it again, this one is always a winner and always welcome.  A true legend in the microbrew universe.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Taybeh,4,"From a single into a NB globe A: clear light copper, 1 finger head, little lacing S: malty! biscuits, caramel, toasted grain, and a touch of earthy spicy hops T: layers of delicious malt here, first some toasty grain, then a little sweet caramel and toffee, then some really faint melon and apricot, as well as some faint spiciness and mild bitterness, finishing with more moderately sweet malty biscuity notes. M: for me, a little too much carbonation, though objectively it would be ""medium"". Pretty smooth, very quaffable.  Overall: this is great, a real pleasure when you're in the right mood. I've been drinking this one for years since my little bro used to live a few miles away from the brewery. It is quite different than both the (very different) German and American maibocks I know best, but I think it it is still a delicious brew....",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Grayson,4.48,"A: Pours a light brown, with a minimal, quickly-fading, sticky head. S: Mild fruit notes, some caramel. Very mild. T: Very sweet and fruity.

132,355,SmashPants,3.53,"Format: tall brown 650mL bottle, funky craft beer label.  Appearance: pours out a mid brown with a finger of beige head that lasts for a time before dropping to a solid cap. Decent lacing on the glass also - looks good.  Aroma: some caramels, light fruits and a nutty quality. Reasonable if not amazing.  Taste: again light caramels, that nutty quality and a touch of fruit and spice. Pleasant, if a little underwhelming.  Aftertaste: more of the nut comes through on the finish, making it somewhat dry and a touch cloying.  Mouth feel: quite a smooth feel with moderate body and carbonation.  Overall: this is one of the better beers I have had from Rogue Ales - nicely complex without too much of the cloying nut character that tends to overpower a lot of their beers. Not too pricy at AU$14 for a 650mL bottle. Perhaps once every now and then.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Beric,3.87,"Serving: On tap at People's Republik, Cambridge MA Served: 16 November 2014  Appearance: Crystal clear, deep gold color with barely a head. I feel like the head would have been bigger had the bartender kept it, but he was pouring the heads off beers. Looks pretty great.  Smell: Very sweet with floral hops.  Taste: Not your standard Maibock, that's for sure. The dense, caramel sweet malt backbone is there for sure, as one would suspect for the style, but the flavor profile is otherwise dominated by a heavy assertion of floral American hops. With this in mind, the flavor is quite good- I think the very sweet Maibock base compliments the hops nicely and keeps the beer lively and kicks the ABV up a notch, while some 6.5% IPAs can start getting wonky due to the higher grain bill. Pleasant and drinkabl.e  Feel: Medium body, almost creamy mouthfeel.  Overall: Not a bad beer, and one I would gladly order again. This is definitely an Americanized Maibock, so don't go into this one expecting the subtleties of a traditional German one. Nonetheless, the beer is exceedingly drinkable and highly flavorful, and one I would definitely recommend trying.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Small head <12mm that diminishes quickly to a 3-4mm circle in the middle of the glass.  Smell - not overly strong, slight hint of flowers, dominated by malt  Taste - upfront ester and slight resin notes. Dominated by malt flavors on finish but balanced nicely with slight bitterness/pine. No evidence of yeast.  Mouthfeel - lots of small bubbles but not overly carbonated, dry finish  Overall - this is my first experience with Dead Guy even though I have been into beers for a while. I tend to pass on more common/available beers in favor of more obscure (typically foreign brews). I was delighted to find a modern, West Coast brew that was not dominated by hops. But then this is from Oregon, not CA. This is a very good beer, well balanced, offering an uncommon flavor profile. It would pair nicely with duck.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

I dont hate this beer but I dont really like it.....I could drink it all night long and be fine with it....and it doesnt taste bad..... but its not something I would get if I saw it on tap with other beers I havent tried.  Its a little hoppy a little malty...maybe a touch of wheat...but no fruit. It ends dry....its not very bitter....its kinda boring....after taste is kinda sweet but in a quick dry way.  this beer to me is really odd! Its not bad and kinda good....the flavors kinda blend yet bombastic.

132,355,hoptheology,3.54,"Hey ho! Let's get dead! First time trying this brew.  12 oz bottle poured into glass.  Appearance (4) : Crisp snap as I remove the cap. Pours a fluffy off-white three finger head on top of a beautiful haze of what I can only call sunburst (like on a Fender Stratocaster guitar). The opacity is about 40%.  Aroma (3.75) : Everything here is pretty faint. In order from strongest to distant : Pear, ginger, pineapple, sugar, nutmeg. Bouquet is fairly weak, but everything smells like good quality.  Taste (3.5) : It's hard to describe this one. Tea bitterness, some orange, mango, ginger. A little cinnamon. A citrus hop bitterness wraps it up in the finish. The flavors seem to clash, but they are all distinct. It's like I want to taste fruit, but instead I get tea. I want to taste the tea, but instead I get old rumply fruit. It's really hard to rate this category.  Mouthfeel (3.25) : Light bodied with some pretty intense carbonation. Very lightly creamy but the carbonation sort of destroys that. It ends with a hop bitterness so characteristic of Helles beers.  Overall (3.54) : I wasn't all that impressed with this beer. Perhaps I'm not a fan of the Maibock style, but this one was just too intense and never really focused on any single flavor. There was no vantage point for me. It was all jumbled together in a sour bitter mess. It's crafty alright, but I'll skip this one next time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

APPEARANCE: slow, steady bubbles are mired within an opaquely beautiful orange brown body; creamy, substantial off-white head; lacing creates white fencing... AROMA: strong citric cleansing power--peach, tangerine, and orange--weds with soft pine to produce a sweet, rewarding allure... PALATE: smooth, active and bubbling to the tongue; simmering and balanced, if not a little difficult to place--could be the ale/bock moniker coming to fruition; still, highly drinkable for a beer nearly 7% ABV.....TASTE: intense melon, ear-tingling hops, and a solid malt base at the throat creates a full, demanding taste; nothing Dead here! ...

Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light dark fruit, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness.

S: Strong, sweet caramel.  T: Caramel dominates. Has lingering red apple. Some flower on the back end.  M: Creamy smooth. It floats on the tongue and fades away slowly. Beautiful.  O: The creaminess is apparent first, then a wash of caramel takes over. The sweetness fades and then a slight bitterness comes on until fading into a red apple and flower back end that lingers. This is a very well balanced and fantastically smooth beer.

Nice aroma of malt then hops which surprised me a little, the head definitely releases some biscuit smell as well.  Taste has some hoppy bitterness, but with a good earthy malt background, almost the reverse of the aroma. I get a little oak after the finish in back, but not much.  Mouthfeel is medium, with correct carbonation,  Overall above average to outstanding. I have not tried any other Maibock or Helles Bock, so I was probably a little conservative. Noticing the hops in the recipe, I would hazard that Rogue did their research right on this one.

Smell: Strong hoppy scent is the first thing to come through. Some malt. Slight biscuit scent.  Taste: A hoppy bitterness is the major flavour of the beer. A light oakiness. Malt comes through more in the taste than the scent as well as a small yeasty flavour.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer, leaves a slight stickiness on the lips. Carbonation is just right.

I could see how one could call this a Maibock - the German hop flavor is apparent, while there's also an ideal level of clean alcohol flaming in the background - but the malt flavors are unmistakably American - graham-cracker, with a dusting of light caramel... the bitterness builds and is the last thing standing  M: kinda silky smooth, cut hard through by the bitterness... despite the voluminous head, there's only a modicum of bubbly tingle on the tongue... round, soft-felt-blankety flow  O: shit, probably only had this once or twice in the past 10 years, but this is pretty damn good - but I love bitter, malty, fullish beers, minus all the tutti-fruity nonsense... if you're familiar enough with Rogue's ales, you may very well peg this as one right away - that Pacman is quite distinct... we'll see what the price point on this is, but I could see drinking this more often",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Aroma of biscuit and caramel malt, mild citrus hops, pleasantly malty. Flavor is semi-sweet caramel malt with slight biscuit, mellow nondescript stone fruit, developing and finishing with spicy hops with light pine and citrus elements. Great balance. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I'm really overdue to review this Northwest classic, which I started drinking ages ago as Wolfeel Ale. One of the early flavorful beers that pulled me into craft styles. Nothing really stands out in this maibock, but it is almost perfectly balanced with a nice flavor progression from the lightly sweet maltiness into a good, non herbal mild hop finish. Really a fine example of the style (but with a domestic slant) and a great drinking beer. Very nice malt flavors. Glad to revisit it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Poured from the bottle into a glass, Dead Guy's got a half finger thick head,very light tan with adequate lacing surrounding the medium-dark amber body  I smell malt mainly, pleasant scents at that. Maybe some earthiness as well? And a slight wisp of spice.  The malt taste is greatly balanced by that earthiness I'd mentioned. The balancing is not done with much bitterness; I can't place my finger of what exactly is doing this. But its a pro, so don't fix what ain't broke. Also, I got a rather smooth finish from Dead Guy.  Mouthfeel is also outstanding for being a bock derivative. Very clean and crisp. Fantastic job here.  Overall an outstanding 4 given to Dead Guy Ale from Rogue Ales.

132,355,Kuaff,4.1,"Had this Dead Guy around cellar temperature, poured into a pint glass.  A two-finger white head of froth decays fast over a pretty, translucent golden-amber body with a few visible streams of carbonation rising.  The aroma doesn't have a lot of strength, but I get hints of banana, vanilla, a subtle citrus of the orange variety, and malty, biscuity bread or yeast. What's there is pleasant, just not intensely aromatic.  I get light fruitiness in the taste at first, like the citrus and banana, in a pretty nice balance. This transitions quite nicely into a yeasty, bready aftertaste that eventually dries up into a slightly astringent, light piney hoppiness, as an understated IPA would. The finish is kind of like the beer equivalent of just having taken a bite of a soft pretzel. Overall, a well-balanced, satisfying, and refreshing flavor.  The body is medium to me, with kind of medium to high carbonation. It works well.  This is a very well-balanced, refreshing beer that I would categorize as very close in style to American pale ales.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Moose90,3.98,"22oz Glow in the dark bottle poured into a 15oz porter glass.  A — Poured slowly there is a slight eggshell colored head that sits atop the somewhat hazy, reddish hued amber body of beer. Some spotty and clinging lacing is left behind.  S — Smell is lightly sweet and caramel laden, with notes of toffee, chewy malt base as well. Toasted caramel notes abound, as well as some light fruity esters of orange, and lemon. Kind of toasty and fruity overall.  T — Taste is driven by a nice malty sweetness, with notes of caramel malt, crystal malt, little bit of a chocolate and bitter dry fruitiness as well. Nice balance of malt, little bit of a slight drying hop presence, but overall leans toward the sweet side of the spectrum.  M — Medium bodied with a lingering sweetness.  O — Nice, reliable, consistent, malty, sweet, good balance of flavors, and a pretty good food beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SitkaSteve,3.87,"Revisit for me. Though many a times, I've had this, well, here's my update. Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange color. Slim finger-ed white head appears and quickly burns off right on into the beer. Uh...where's the lacing? Hmmm...alright, whatever (somehow, this happened all of the time. The smell has that ruddy caramel maltiness blending into sweet biscuits and a slight earthy hoppiness lends it's hand to balance. The taste was moderately sweet allowing the earthy hops to make an effort to blend. Decent biscuity aftertaste. The mouthfeel accompanies the biscuits to have about a medium body. Slightly crisp sweetness bends over my tongue. Overall, glad I decided to revisit this once I understood what a maibock is. In my opinion, Rogue did this one well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dawnmarie93,2.98,"The biggest thing I was surprised by is the lack of flavor. This is a very light tasting beer with a nice carbonation to it...but it drinks like water. Don't get me wrong - it is not a dissatisfying beer - it is just slightly perplexing. My tastes may be biased, however, as I am a fan of IPA's and dark, heavy beers, and this is dead center between the two. Overall I wouldn't NOT recommend it but wouldn't push strongly TO recommend it. Perhaps the word 'bland' fits as a description. But I would buy it again - sometimes bland is all you need.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SpenCycle,3.49,"A very standard-tasting beer. Tastes EXACTLY how malt extract smells. With some good and carbonation thrown in. Probably one of the best non-fruit, non-ipa ales I've ever had. Just not a fan of ales with no distinct flavor except malt. 40 IBUs on this bad boy, but no big hop flavor. A slight floral and smooth hop flavor.Reminds me of a Magic Hat #9. A little sweet, very malty, and a hint of bitterness. The phrase a ""not quite pale ale"" describes this beer.  Confused on one thing. This is a maibock, but is marketed as an ale?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,brysonbreakey,3.36,"This is a cool beer! It had more carbonation than most beers I've had before and was lighter in nature. It was really refreshing which was one of my favorite qualities of it. All around, I gave this one a solid 3.5. If you're sitting at a bar reading this wondering if it's a good call, go for it!

The beer has a half finger tall sudsy foamy beige head that reduces to a medium to large patch of very thin film and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Light aromas of toasted and caramel malts with just a hint of floral hops.  T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of toasted and caramel malts with a light amount of toffee sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of floral and earthy hops which impart a light amount of lingering bitterness.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth.  O: Easy to drink with a well hidden alcohol presence. Interesting blend of malts and hops in this one but definitely not one of my favorite beers in the style (but it is a good example of the style).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Pours a beautiful cloudy dark orange/amber color with a very thin white head. It has a pleasant light fruity smell to it. Very drinkable and has some caramel malt flavor to it and well balanced slight bitter hop taste. It's full bodied but refreshing and easy drinking.

132,355,flyingpig,3.46,"355ml Bottle from Good Spirits Co, Glasgow (£3.50): Copper amber colour with a half-centimetre tall, foamy head that is a very slightly off-white colour and settles as a thick lacing on the top that covers the entire surface.  Hoppy at first with some caramel and toffee notes coming through along with some burst of citrus and faint pine. There is a malt base that is a semi-sweet one and I could detect bread and sweet fruits and yeast too.  Pine hops and some citrus kick things off along with some caramel malts and a floral taste that is a little hoppy and hints at some bitterness. There is some sweetness and bread with a few fruits as well, notably some apple.  Medium bodied, a fairly good balance and medium carbonation as well, this beer is smooth with a dry and bitter tang from the citrus and some sweetness throughout along with a crisp finish.  An interesting one, almost seems like an American pale ale & definitely an unusual take on the Maibock style with the beer growing on you as you work your way down the glass.

Pours a light cloudy amber, with 1-finger creamy off-white head, which dissipates to a persistent ring, leaving some little lace. Initial aroma of a bit of hop spice, then caramel malt and some mild citrus. A little carbonation to start, carrying mild roasted caramel malt, and some mild citrus, leading into a nicely bitter hop clean-up, and a slightly silky, mellow caramel malt finish.

132,355,Trooper92292,4.17,"I was introduced to Dead Guy last year and I can't get enough of it. Its dark color is a great to see in a tall glass and provides a mature rich taste compared to some other ales I've had. Its taste is very powerful at first and then relaxes, which is what an ale should do. If there’s somewhere where this is on tap please let me know. Bottled is great but I’m guessing on tap would provide a better taste and you would be able to taste the ingredients more. I highly recommend this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S - Vegetal elements and floral notes, with a certain sweet, caramel line.  T - Sweet caramel notes close down quickly, leading to bread and malts, which then comes up with a hop bitter finish that lingers.  M - A crisp beer, with significant carbonation, and a drying that trails after you swallow.  O - Well crafted, with many fine qualities.

Bit of hops and bitter at the front end followed by a nice crisp malty flavor, then a little acidic, like a grapefruit, at the very end - but overall very good flavor overall. You can taste (and feel) the alcohol content, nice and high, but tasty! Not overly hoppy or too sweet, a really nice balance of flavors.  Drinking a 1 pt 6 oz bottle, poured.

132,355,Weston19,3.92,"A: Has a hazy wood color with a thin lace. Medium carbonation  S: Heavy notes of caramel and earthiness. Faint smell of molasses as well. Smells pretty nice, not too strong but not too light.  T: Very complex beer from what the nose originally hinted at. The first thing you get is a hit of malts and caramel followed by a huge hop flavor. It has a very interesting finish because it leaves a bitter taste but it eventually goes away and leaves a sweeter syrupy flavor. It definitely has pleasant taste and complexity. One thing to note is that as it gets warmer the bitterness mellows out and it becomes maltier and the notes of caramel come out more.  M: Somewhat dry and lots of aftertaste. Light to medium bodied.  O: This beer was pretty good and it definitely has a ton of flavor. To me, the bitterness that I got from the beer was more of a plain ole bitterness as opposed to a hoppy one. Maybe it was just my bottle. But either way I really enjoyed this one. I would suggest that you taste it cold and notice the hop bite that it has and then let it warm up and get the caramel and molasses notes that come through.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,FickleBeast,3.88,"12 oz bottle poured into a nonic.  Pours a hazy orange color with a half finger of foam. Aroma is bready, malty, slight toffee.  Taste is very unique, lots of bready english-style malts. No hops or real bitterness to speak of. This is certainly a malt-forward beer but the maltiness is much different that the typical crystal malt sweetness that I'm used to.  This is an interesting change of pace beer from the typical IPAs, porters, and saisons that I've been drinking lately. Good gateway beer into craft, IMO.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

O - I generally hate lagers, let me reiterate, I HATE LAGERS! mainly because they leave me feeling incomplete, and I just go for Ales. But this is damn good. I wouldn't mind drinking this while eating something light like a light fish or salad. This is very drinkable, light, with the perfect balance of everything that should make a lager great.

132,355,beergoot,4.26,"A surprise, early birthday gift from Kay and Peg in Louisiana. It's been years since I've had a Dead Guy, so this is quite the surprise and treat...now if only I can figure out why an ale is listed as a maibock???  Poured a nice orange/amber color with lots of dancing carbonation and a very rich, thick, fluffy white head. Aroma came across with a nice medley of soft bready scents and subdued citrus/floral character. Cookie dough flavor with an excellent, subtle hop bitterness at the finish. Medium-light bodied; crisp, clean, dry finish.  This beer is near perfect in that its deep and complex without bludgeoning your senses. There is a Xmas cookie-like flavor here; biscuit-y and slightly sweet; with hints of orange and lemon to add to the overall dimension of things. The hop bitterness blends well with the malts and completes the package, adding nice overall depth and complexity to this palate pleaser.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerWizard,3.9,"Mixed six addition from Cost Plus. I've always wanted to try this but it takes a little nudge to get me into a $12 sixer.  Poured into a tulip a rust-tinged amber, 3/4"" head without much retention. Leaves no lacing on the glass as it drinks down. Nose was quite interesting and tantalizing, kind of like a marzen, and has a honey element to it. Tastes of grain, malt, light hops, and is roasty. I thought the mouthfeel was outstanding; medium, lightly carbonated.  Overall, I'd like to sample this alongside Paulaner Oktoberfest and see how it fares. My brain is still trying to comprehend that this is not a lager with the similar flavor profiles and seemingly quick deterioration after pour.  Honestly, really like it, but don't understand the pricetag. I would love to try this on draught though, and will probably throw down for a sixer at some point.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

It was a nice off-orange color with a nice head that dissipated a bit, and not much lace. Nice carbonation but there seemed to have been some sediment throughout making the brew a bit cloudy.  Wasn't much in the aroma other than the malts, and they weren't very distinguished.  First thing I thought after a few gulps was that this very much resembles New Belgium's Fat Tire. Not a slam on this beer by any means. I felt the hops left a little to be desired but other than that I can't find much to bash this beer on.  Mouthfeel was satisfying. Very smooth, balanced, and goes down easy.

Light notes of dark fruits. Flowery and citrus hops profile  T: Sweet upfront. Strong notes of toffee, caramel and crystal malts. Bready and very biscuity. Notes of brown sugar.

132,355,Haydn-Juby,3.96,A: Clear with an orangish yellow color. One finger of head. Decent lacing and retention.  S: Sweet malts and a bit of noble hops.  T: Very sweet. Extremely malty but some hops come through as well. There's a bit of bitterness but the highlight is definitely on the caramel and toffee like malt character. The hops are best described as noble and spicy with a slight citrus zest. Somewhat like a very heavily roasted oatmeal raisin cookie. Not to much alcohol is detectable and it's pretty well hidden.  M: A touch to syrupy honestly. Very creamy mouthfeel though and it's not prickly feeling at all.  O: A very good beer. Would buy again if it was accessible.

A very pleasant go to for beer geeks just wanting something much better than BMC beers.  Pours a murky orange with some white head. Looks yummy, lacing stick around.  Smells alot like honey infused malt, some hops, yeasty flowery notes, and caramel. I think the smell is the best part of the beer, it is very quaffable .  Taste is sweet malts , caramel goodness, honey, floral hoppiness, some toasted barley, kind of reminds me of a low alc wheat wine. A slight bitterness lingering in the aftertaste. I give it a 4 for being a great tasting sessionable beer.  Mouthfeel is medium to light carbonation, smooth taste, silky mouthfeel, long flavorful finish.  This is a great beer that must be tried for people that like maibocks and dont want to spend a whole lot on it, its usually 10-11$ a 6 pack.

S - Rich malty, almost biscuity notes. A little bit of sweet and faint hops comes through as well. Nice and well balanced.  T - Very smooth and well balanced with a strong malt profile. With that being said, there is a subtle complexity to the malts since you can tell it is a really nice blend. A little sweetness is present and some citrusy/fruity notes from the hops.  M - Medium bodied, relatively crisp and smooth. A little creaminess as well. Very pleasant and excellent finish. Extremely drinkable.  Overall, Rogue Dead Guy Ale is one of those beers that I have often overlooked since it's been around forever and I've had it tons of times.

Didn't get too much out of the nose but the flavor is rich and extremely malty with a thick, full mouthfeel. There's a very strong hop presence that lingers throughout the sip; hard to place exact flavors. This beer seems to be all over the place but is extremely tasty and satisfying. A cross between a pale ale and an amber. My only complaint would be its muddled, undefined flavor that doesn't quite allow anything to stand out. Definitely worth trying, but not something I'd return to regularly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,coldy,4.13,"This not a real technical review. I first drank this beer probably 15 years ago, and it was one of my first memorable beers where I said ""wow, I didnt know there were beers that tasted like this"". This is, in my opinion, a true classic ale that can be enjoyed year round. It is extremely flavorful but not at all heavy, so you can have one or several. This beer also represents a good value. You can actually keep this in the fridge by the case, and it wont empty your pockets.  Rogue nailed this beer, and it is as good now as it was 15 years ago. Even with all of the great new beers coming out, this is still a really good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,freakdiablo,3.96,"It should be noted I'm still fairly new to this review thing.  A - Clear, slightly darker amber coloring. Thicker head that quickly fades, little to no lacing.  S - Stronger sweet smell, almost fruity. Slight underlying bready scent.  T - Very little bitterness, at least compared to what I'm used to, but still a little bite. Stronger, full taste that would hold it's own when poured during a meal. Not really hoppy, which may be a good or bad depending on taste. A mild sweet aftertaste that kind of mimics the smell.  M - Slightly thicker with medium carbonation.  O - Overall, I find that no single characteristic of Dead Guy Ale stands out on its own. If broken down into it's specific categories, I'll probably forget it in a few weeks. But as a whole, I find DGA to be a solid beer. In my opinion it is not worth the $6.70 price tag I payed for a 650ML bottle, but if it dropped into the $5-$6 range, I wouldn't mind picking up a couple to have on hand.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,archyquaffer,4.03,"Served from a bomber into a shaker. A moderate pour produces a 1/2 inch head of off-white, frothy head. The head is fairly sticky, but not overly so. The beer is a pale orange-brown with plenty of carbonation.  There's a certain understated fruitiness in the nose along with some mild floral hop essence. Plenty of malty breadiness on the palate, with a good balance of hop bitterness. I taste a bit of pear/apple, biscuit/dumplings, and bit of citrusy and spicy bite. Clean finish, with a nice, lingering floral bitterness.  This was bought at Walmart for 4 something a bomber, which is quite a nice price ( and the only bomber available at this Butte, Mt Walmart). I've been a fan of this beer for quite some time, but I confess I like the cute little skeleton on the label, which probably influences my choices in subtle ways...A very worthy maibock, but nothing to get too excited about. A very good session beer if not quaffed too awful fast...  Update (5-1-14)- I just wanted to add that I bought a growler of this beer today, which was obviously shipped here. It was being kept warm under fluorescent lights. I passed it up for a few days, but decided I just had to have a growler with the cute lil skeleton on it. Apparently they bottle this right in the growler. I might have to try this with my homebrew.  It still has a very interesting taste, and I can't fault it for being stored as it was. I cracked it open and poured into a shaker, and still got plenty of head. I'd just like to add that I can really taste the Munich malts. I might up the score a hair.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Zach41,3.57,"Disclaimer/announcement: This is my first review. I've been drinking craft for a solid seven months (since turning 21) and feel that I've finally tasted enough and developed my palette to write something worthwhile. Here it goes..  Poured fairly aggressively into a mug, served at about 50 degrees.  Appearance- Sort of a cloudy copper, ALMOST amberish color. A fairly large head but it went away much quicker than I expected.  Smell- A well rounded smell, not particularly strong. Smelled of a smooth tasting beer.  Taste- I am not familiar with the maibock style so I didn't know what to expect (though I've been told this selection isn't true to the style), and I was initially disappointed by the prevalent malty flavor. However, as the glass warmed in my hand the flavors began to come out, the surprising smoothness and balanced taste began to win me over.  Mouthfeel- Medium, a tiny bit on the creamy side I'd say, and extremely drinkable.  Overall- I know it was meant to be one, but definitely not the cure for a strong hop craving (40 IBUs). However, its smooth malty character and pleasant balance contribute to quite a pleasurable experience.  PS I find serving temp to be especially important in this brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Joey-bags1990,4.63,"A-Medium amber colored, clear filtered look yet somewhat opaque. Roughly a half inch high foam head after being poured into a pint glass that quickly recedes to a small centimeter high film at the top of the beer with small bubbles ascending from the bottom of the glass.  S- Somewhat sweet scent of malts. Medium to heavy hops with a floral/grassy smell as far as I could tell. Very clean scent.  T- Strong delicious taste of rich malts with a rich caramel taste and strong hops that strike a very good balance and complement each other well. Clean finish with good level of bitterness.  F- Medium body on the palate when held in your mouth for a few seconds, with a smooth finish as it goes down your throat.  O- Outstanding beer with a great taste that can be expected from a premium craft ale. Great balance of smell, taste and feel and is a beer that I would definitely consider drinking many more times in the future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,brurevu,3.91,"As a Maibock this beer is all Malts with just enough hops to keep it balanced. My first recommendation is to let this one warm up before you begin to drink it. Served Ice cold the Dead Guy Ale can taste like a cheap gas station beer, but once it warms all of the deep malty character come out. It pours a honey color with an off-white head and sweet caramel aroma. The taste is all malts, with big sweet malt and caramel notes and a nice depth that lingers on the palate. This is a definitely a complex beer for a Maibock and a great counterpoint to all the IPAs I have been drinking lately. It has deceptively high alcohol content for the very smooth and easy drinking beer. The Dead Guy Ale was a nicely balanced and outstanding beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Pours a hazy copper with a 1-finger off white head that left some lacing when sipped. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of malty grains with a hint of caramel with maybe apricot. Pretty much was the taste as well as with a hint of spice. Good balance of flavor and smooth to drink. No harsh or bad aftertaste was noted.

T: Very malty, tons of caramel and toffee, a bit of citrus rind, candied sugar, cocoa.  M/D: Full bodied, moderate carbonation, drinkability is average.

I got some nuttiness from the nose and got some weird apricots so I had to glance. So I got the munich malt but the apricot and fruitiness were apparent. Hops were absent, however. T- My favorite part. Nice and clean drinking. Come to think of it this is my first helles/maibock that I've reviewed here. The taste follows the nose in the sense that I get a Newcastle nutty malt backbone, but the difference here is the hops. The bitterness lingers and is quite pleasant. Not my everyday beer, but a nice quality ale. I'd say 4.5 just because I was so intrigued. M- Medium, characteristic of the style. O- A nice quality beer with a 6.5% kick? Sign me up.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,admiral,4.41,"Brilliant beer - very happy that it is now down here in Australia.  aroma: big malt, chocolate, creamed caramel with slight toffee and apricot  taste: full of different flavours with big malty goodness. Creamy malt, spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and orange marmalade are all there on the palate in healthy proportions with some slight vanilla in the background.  Enjoyed this beer alot and one of my favourite American brews at present. A pleasure to drink!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ThatVisorGuy,3.67,"A: Very nice, slightly darker shade of amber. very clear with no traces of any sediment or cloudiness.  S: Pleasant and strong but not overwhelming.  T: A heavy taste that builds off of an initial taste of the hops that fades into the slightest hint of citrus to relax after the bitter beginning.  M: Aftertaste fades away smoothly without leaving the taste needlessly hanging in your mouth making each sip enjoyable.  O: An excellent Ale. perfect for cold days (or nights) spent relaxing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rievelx6,4.02,A- Pours a nice brown shade similar to an amber colored beer.  S- Scents of caramel with hints of malt.  T- Very distinguished taste of caramel with a good combination of malt to match its smell.  M- Good carbonation with a very smooth finish.

Left a bit of lace. S - It smells original. Caramel, and of many sweet malts and grasses. A little earthy, original stink in a good peaty way. T - Follows smell, these sweet, candied, toasted malt and tiny bit of hops and grass/herb/clove. M - Almost dense mouth feel, like a doppel bock, good weight. A medium-bodied beer. Nice finish. Nice after dinner with robust cheese. A good night beer.  D - A must try. Love this brewer's originality and information for each brew. They care.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Aromas of banana, bubblegum, caramel, grapes, fresh baked bread, tomato juice? Taste is very bready upfront, almost like a dry cracked loaf of bread that ends in a slight citrus/spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, refreshing, with decent carbonation.  Delicious! Its like drink a loaf of fresh baked bread. A classic from one of the early pioneers in the craft beer movement.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Overall- not bad besides not being able to smell anything. Very sweet and carbonated.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WheelsPSU,4.03,"I had this on tap at theAmsterdam Ale House on the Upper West Side. This style isn't normally one I seek out, but I did enjoy Dead Guy.  It poured an inviting, yet hazy honey brown with a beige colored head. It smelt like sweet crackers and caramel. A good malt aroma. The taste was honey with more caramel. Definitely enjoyable even with the upfront bitterness. It was drinkable and balanced. So far, one of my favorite offerings from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,draheim,3.77,"12oz bottle, consumed straight from the bottle (it's a staff meeting at work, no glassware provided).  I know from prior experience this is an amber color with pretty good head retention/lacing, so I'm giving it a 4 for appearance.  Aroma is sweet, caramelly, bready, fruity and malty. Some floral hops too.  Taste follows nose. Caramel, toffee, sweet bread and floral/spicy NW and Old World hops.  Mouthfeel is sticky and full-bodied, feels heavy and chewy.  Overall I don't have a lot of experience with this style. It's a bit too sweet and malt-forward for my taste. Decent for what it is though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AndyYoung-BrewConnoisseur,4.52,"Overall my favorite beer of all time. My German-style bias could partly bee a factor in this recognition however it's just what I expect a world-class beer to be. It's not all fruity and bitter like some IPAs'. It's not watered down by any means like mainstream American beer. It goes down smooth and at 6.5% abv, it's outstandingly palatable. The taste is something of an amber ale cross with German brew tones. This is my favorite beer in the USA!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,polloenfuego,3.73,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pilsener glass.  A: poured a golden brown color with a decent head that dissipated a little quicker than I anticipated.  S: sweet, malty and honey and cloves come forward.  T: follows the smell, the malt is there and there is a honey/caramel sweetness to it.  M: smooth with some prickly carbonation.  O: my first experience with this style. Definitely not something I would have every day. It was perhaps a little sweet for my liking. I normally don't drink a 22 oz beer alone, so I had a bit left over. A decent enough brew...better suited to the fall in my opinion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MarvinSnyder,4.15,"Poured into a pilsener glass from a 12 FL. OZ. bottle.  Appearance: Pours a hazy, honey brown color with a decent head that only slightly dissipates. Nice lacing but somewhat sporadic. Really a fine looking beer.  Smell: busy on the nose with caramel, sweet malt, honey, burnt tobacco, graham cracker, and candied oranges.  Taste: bready and malty. Overall pretty sweet with caramel, graham cracker, and honey most prevalent. Also expect a very slight hop presence manifested through the candied orange and earthy, burnt tobacco. The alcohol is hidden throughout.  Mouthfeel: Very little carbonation. Silky and creamy. Maybe a a little chewy.  Overall: I've had this beer several times. At beer dinners, pubs, and even as a beer of the month selection. This is a complex beer and a great example in this style. It continues to grow on me through every tasting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mpedara429,4.4,"A: Pours out a hazy and deep amber color. Two fingers of a light tan head. Lacing is a bit spotty.  S: Bready and sweet. It kind of reminds me of graham crackers. Also, getting subtle hints of a candied orange type smell.  T: Earthy hop up front, followed by the same characteristics of the wonderful nose. Great balance, and not as sweet as the nose would imply.  M: Sticky and a little creamy. Body is on the medium-heavy side. Carbonation is on the softer side.  O: I've had this sitting in my basement for a few months now. My friends rave about this beer and I've been skeptical to try it because I'm more of an IPA guy. I can see what all the fuss is about. This beer executes on all levels and I'll be looking forward to having more of these in the cooler seasons.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,CalgaryFMC,3.88,"Tried at a pub in downtown Calgary on a nice sunny Saturday afternoon. Pours up a honey golden graham hue with a moderate amount of beige head. Aroma was sweet, fairly floral, spicy Noble hops. Taste was a really complex mosaic of light caramel, aromatic biscuit, lemon, dry chocolate powder, orange, honey, and tobacco with ample hop spice and subtle bitterness. I was struck by how integrated the flavors were, one had to really focus to pick them out and the overall impression is one of a floral/herb/spice bouquet with a honey sweet backdrop. If Rogue was going for integration rather than staggering things on the palate they hit a home run here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The smell is sweet and roasted malts, caramel, honey, lemon and orange.  This brew is sweet as in sweet like caramel and honey, both of which dominate. Then I can taste both sweet and roasted malts. I am picking up more caramel than honey. Also there are light, peppery hops and an orange taste on the backend.  The mouthfeel is smooth but slightly chewy. Slightly tangy due to the carbonation.

S-I smell a good bit of sweet caramel, some honey, melon, apple, and malted grain. There is a little bit of wheat-like spice underneath. Nice balance here.  T-The taste tracks the smell with caramel and moderate sweetness from the tan malts. However, I'm not getting the sweet fruits that I smelled...its more caramel on the palate. There is a touch of drying, spicy bitterness on the finish. Nice balance again.  M-The beer is robust on the palate, but not heavy or syrupy thanks to the decent hit of prickly carbonation.  O-I can't believe it has taken me this many years to try Dead Guy, but I am glad I finally did. The beer may not have much flash or any bret in there, but what it lacks in pizazz, it makes up for in drinkability and balance.

Taste: Dead Guy has some mild hoppy characteristics, but very subtle. This hoppy character is only evident briefly before fading into a very satisfying, well-rounded beer. Interestingly the flavor doesn't come alive until you've had it in your mouth for a bit. Very tasty, indeed! Not too hoppy, hints of malt, and a light sweetness., with just the right amount of carbonation.  Finish: reminiscent, faintly, of a mild IPA. Nothing overbearing, and doesn't lay heavy.

Honeysuckle, tropical fruit, candied orange zest, light brown sugar, allspice, light clove notes, pineapple; citrus and a slight resin quality keep everything clean.  Medium bodied, almost-but-not-quite-creamy mouthfeel. Moderate level of carbonation and bitterness, with the bitterness holding on very late into the finish.  This beer really picks up on the palate. Not at all what I would expect after the nose. Truly interesting and makes you want to go back in for another sip. While several of the descriptors would make you think that the beer would be sweet, it manages to come up to the edge without going over. The beer actually finishes slightly on the bitter side.

132,355,BeerEngineer,2.15,"NOTE - I HAD TO GRADE THIS BEER EXTREMELY LOW BECAUSE IT HAD AN INFECTION OF SOME SORT. TERRIBLE ALCOHOLIC BURN AND TASTE, CORN ODOR (DMS) VERY HIGH. I DUMPED THIS BOTTLE.  General - Had a 22 oz bottle of this in the fridge for too long. I used to be a big fan of this but now, not so much. I'm going to try and review this as it should be with the BJCP style 5A. I'm drinking it out of my New Belgium tulip.  Appearance - Color is a deep copper to light brown, somewhere around an SRM of 17. The head is great at first, light and fluffy with a slightly off-white color. Head diminishes quickly.  Aroma - There is a moderate malty scent on this, appropriate for the style. There is a hint of hops with it which is typically not acceptable. Typically a maibock will have very minimal noble hop aroma. There is something wrong with this bottle, I can't tell what it is. I smell something like creamed corn mixed with rubbing alcohol.  Taste - Not going to happen, did you read the aroma section I wrote? Ok so I tasted it anyway. Super bitter, definitely bad. This is infected with something. This sucks. I'm done with this.  Mouthfeel - There is a big astringency with this, it is gross.  Overall - Yikes, I normally don't see DMS in commercially available beers but that's Rogue for you. I used to like this brand and sometime I will give it another review but this one is terrible.

Dead Guy Ale has a nice copper hue, but it is somewhat cloudy. Pour is standard, average head.  S. Smell is similar to other bocks; vaguely European, very malty. Hops are subdued. Notes of raisins. Can smell alcohol coming through.  T. Initially refreshing and crisp, main flavors are powerful malts, a fruity and earthy middle, and an underwhelming hop finish. Somewhat watered down compared to other Rogue brews. Not very complex.  M. Carbonation is refreshing, but is quickly overpowered by the malts. Sweet malty aftertaste.  O. I've never been impressed with Dead Guy Ale. It tastes like they took a great Barley Wine and watered it down, which is especially infuriating considering the rest of Rogue's offerings. Definitely decent overall, but probably my least favorite from Rogue. This is really just a standard malty bock, nothing very interesting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jdhowe,3.6,"12oz bottle, no evident bottling or best-by date.  A: Pours a clear deep reddish amber color, 1 finger of fluffy off-white head from a vigorous pour quickly dissipates to a mottled film. Looks like a very nice beer.  S: Sweet and malty up front, also a little roasty. Lots of malt. Some sweet fruit, almost like strawberry, alongside some earthy and spicy hop character. Reminds me at first of a strawberry pastry, which is a unique image that is tough to get out of my head.  T: Everything from the nose is there, including the strawberry. This thing has a huge malt body, a sweet middle, and a bitter hop finish with a little beet of a sugary sweetness persisting. Lots of fruity flavors in this beverage. Almost a little too sweet. The amount of malt (and sugar?) in this isn't what I expected. Flavors come across almost a little artificial.  M: Coats the mouth with its sweetness. Nicely carbonated, mostly smooth. Coating mouthfeel with sweetness toes a very thin line on being cloying.  O: My experiences with Rogue as a brewery have been fairly limited (Maple Bacon Ale and nothing else that has been particularly memorable), but I made a point of hunting this out after friends had recommended it as their favorite of Rogue's offerings. It's not a bad beer, and certainly is something I'd take over most common bar offerings, but I don't know that I'd pick this up over many of the other options I have in the craft aisle. This beer isn't bad, but I can already tell that the sweetness of this one is going to wear on me by the end of the bottle and I don't know that I'd sign up to enjoy this one again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Bosoxfan20,3.64,"Snagged a random bottle at the local store. Don't know much about this one, so it will be a surprise for me. Also my first Rogue.  A- Pours a copper color with a 1 finger light tan head. Average retention leads to soapy lacing. Seems to be slightly hazy for the style, but I don't claim to be an expert on Mailbocks.  S- Malty as can be. Lots of Euro style malts. Not much hop presence. Musky and damp aroma, but not like that of a Belgium style. Different. Tough to put a finger on. Slightly toasted notes make there way to the nose as well.  T- Malts and toasted flavors throughout. Munich malts to be exact. Slight grain comes through. Nice sweetness surprisingly makes its way. Touch of hop bitterness in the finish. Solid balance here. I like the direction we are headed.  M- Very nice feel. Mid body and drinkable. Slightly undercarbonated maybe, but not far off. Covers the palate. Again, a step in the right direction.  O- Well done for the style. The nose had me a little skeptical, but rebounded nicely with the flavor and feel. I'm not in the mood for this style often, but when I am, I will certainly consider this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,CMUbrew,3.98,"On-tap at Hunter's Ale House  A: Orange-amber color with a chill haze. White head starts off extremely thick and creamy looking. Lacing starts from the get go.  S: Smells very malt forward with an addition of spicy and earthy hops and yeasty notes.  T: Biscuity and bready malts dominate, lending an overall sweetness. Light clove-like spiciness, yeasty flavors, banana, pepper, apples.  M: Smooth, slightly crisp, and a little drying. Carbonation is fairly active.  O: I have no idea what the hell a Maibock is supposed to be, and frankly I still don't know. This beer has all kinds of stuff going on, which is not a bad thing. I would say I enjoyed it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jesseejames,1.66,I really did not like this beer way too nasty and bitter. It has a poor head and for a bock beer it really lacked any malt taste. I thought that it was over hopped. All in all I just did not like the taste of this beer. It has a cidery taste that is disgusting to me. If all they did was use sugar to built up the alcohol they were wasting the effort.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,datalager,4.16,"Pour is a lovely unfiltered copper with a frothy ivory head. Suds retract quickly and leave minimal lacing.  Aroma is nutty and bready. Just a hint of ""spicy funk"" sits in the background.  Sipping will bring the bitter hops closer. The hops are unquestionably reminiscent of western European pale ales. More like a bitter root, or a raw artichoke, and not the piney/citrusy flavor that Oregonian and Californian pales are famous for. But don't be fooled. This ale possesses a malty sweetness that gives the backbone a nearly perfect balance.  The dryness that lingers for several minutes after a swallow is what brings you right back for more. There is nothing ""Bruce Lee"" about this ale, like the 100+ IBU's of Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, or the dessert-like experience of Founder's Breakfast Stout. Rather, the profile is well married and full bodied. Smooth and drinkable with medium carbonation. Virtually no ester presence.  What I love most, here, is that it is not like all the other medium ales coming out of the States. It is a superbly done ""anytime"" ale that works with sandwiches, ice cream, pizza, char-grilled fodder, or simply on it's own. I'm enjoying it this very moment on it's own.  Awesome.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bjwilson,4.24,"This beer is a real go to for me. Always delicious. The malts and hops are mixed just about as perfectly as can be on the palate.

Lacing present but slides. Minimal carbonation.  Smell - Malty bready caramel with a slight hop on top. Little bit of bite.  Taste - Malt, bread, rich and hearty fruit, with an ever so slight hop touch mixed with caramel for the finish. The taste more than makes up for the lack of breathtaking aroma.  Mouthfeel - Hearty and full, smooth throughout. Good drinkability. No booziness at all. Yeast and malt coat the palate.  Overall - This is a great representation of this style and beer in general.

About one finger of off white head  S: Malty caramel with some dark fruit  T: Initial bitter hop presence that finishes with pure maltiness. Caramel and candy flavors dominate with hints of vanilla. The balance is incredibly enjoyable  M: Light to medium bodied with only the slightest bit of dryness. This beer really goes down smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that you almost dont even notice  O: Definitely the best bock ive ever tried.

I don't drink this out of the bottle; I always pour into a glass to enjoy the color. It does require a bit of splashing at the end to get a nice head on it.  Smooth and full-bodied, this brew is everything a beer should be. I drink it by itself, or with almost any meal or snack. Did I mention it's my favorite beer all of time? I did? Okay, just wanted to make sure that was clear.  Thank you Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T- Malt forward, toasty and sweet with an immediate bitter kick to balance things.  M- Smooth and crisp, good carbonation despite the lack of head retention.  O- An ale disguised as a lager. None of the typical fruitiness associated with an ale really lets the malt shine with just enough hop bitterness for perfect balance.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Thaddeus,4,"Appearance: Small off-white head, beer was a clear light amber.  Aroma & Taste: Toasty hay notes combined with citrus and herb hops. Had a slight banana taste to it, which I think sweetened it up and helped maintain a good balance with the bitterness.  Had this in my hospitality beverages course. Apparently this beer is brewed like a lager, but uses an ale yeast. We were given this as a Helle Lager, but it was more similar to a Boch style and was to dark and hoppy to be a true Helles Lager. Still tasted great though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Not much experience with the style, but I enjoyed this beer. I feel like it will grow on me even more as well, its a very warm, tart, malty brew.

S: Mild spicy and warm nutmeg aromas. Some sweet caramel.  T: There's a lot going on here. Good balance of hops without being so overwhelming. Some tanginess and dryness is the first taste i get. Finishes sweeter with caramel and a bit of oak and vanilla. Oddly enough, the sweetness actually reminds me of maraschino cherry. Definite malt flavors indicative of a bock.  M: A bit thin and slightly dry. A little too dry for a session if you ask me, but good for a doubleheader. Slightly flat feeling--co2 may be to blame again.  O: It's been a long time since my last dead guy and this used to me a mainstay for me. I'm more impressed now than I was before. Maybe my overexposure to double IPAs has dulled my taste buds letting the subtle flavors, and not the bitter, shine through here. In any rate, I was impressed with the depth of flavor. I may just order another..  Side note: As I was drinking this I couldn't stop thinking how darn good a barrel aged version would be of this. After googling, apparently that's the John John dead guy.

Aroma of rich caramel and honey along with some raspberries and toasted nuts. Very floral as well and sweet smelling almost like the aroma of cooling wort. Pretty nice but a little flat as well.  The taste continues the maltyness with loads of honey, iced tea, and sweet caramel. Not a ton of sweetness in the flavor which is nice but the malt also tends to fall off a little too quickly. No hops to really speak of but a nice moderate bitterness to balance out the sweetness.  Overall, an ok beer but pretty unspectacular. If it wasn't so expensive it might be something to pick up on occasion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WissBrauSean,4.9,"The bottle, of course gets homebrew points for being reusable. I definitely give an extra few tenths of a point for bottle and design. Both of which are excellent. May they never change it!  The beer pours a beautiful hazy (chill haze, poured it cold) deep orange/amber with an amber/tan one finger head that stays throughout the drink as a full ring and Friar Tuck cap in the center of tiny silky bubbles mixed with a few larger bubbles. Lacing is very apparent with sticky looking disorganized archways.  The aroma is centered around citrus, whether it be citrus hops or actual orange and lemon, it's there with a nice sweet caramel base to it. There are some hop floral notes as well and maybe a bit of breadiness. Very faint.  Wow! The taste! There is a good reason that this is a world class beer! It's two major constituents, sweet and bitter are so very well balanced that it allows for the minor flavours such as citrus, caramel and some yeasty banana to play a hand in making you fall in love with this beer. And to tell the truth, all these flavours play on your tongue equally throughout the sip from start to finish, one never dominating the other until only at the end when there is some mild dry hop bitterness. I think the slightly above moderate amount of carbonation is what really pulls this off. It's truly a beer drinking experience to behold.  Mouthfeel. Silky, creamy and sweet with a just-under mid range body to it making it thin enough to session and not get overly tired of any one character like sweetness. EXCELLENT! The amount of carbonation is moderate yet a little lively and really lends to helping bring all these flavors and aromas to your senses.  Overall I am going to have to give it a 4.75 out of 5. I don't know what a 5 would be, I haven't tried it yet and I'm banking that this may be an actual 5, but I'm new to this and don't have the experience to give out 5's.  All that I really have to say that if you don't try this beer, you don't know what you are missing and it needs to be on your bucket list! Thank you Rogue! Now get out there and drink some different drinks! Mix it up, but stop drinking f@cking Jaeger Bombs and drink good beer! Life is short enough, don't make it even shorter drinking that complete garbage!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste: I have to admit, i didn't do a good job of differentiating the various tastes. When the first mouthful hit my tongue, my eyes rolled back in bliss. Such an overal great experience drinking this beer. On one hand, I wanted to keep drinking and on the other, I didn't want to swallow it so I could keep enjoying the taste.

Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Appearance was light-medium golden with a nice head (almost a 1/2 inch or so)  Smells were of citrus (orange/lemon) and hops. Taste was well balanced and aftertaste didn't linger, but wanted you to keep trying to figure out what it was that made it taste so good!  Mouthfeel was just the right amount of foam to allow the liquid to flow through it and hit the palate with an appropriate splash of bitterness, but very little bite in the aftertaste.

Sweet and even tangy at the start, then as the flavors settle, there's a tangy pop at the edges of the tongue, almost sour mustard. There's bitterness in the finish that is very nice.  Mouthfell: Here's a chewy one. A bit of carbonation (not pronounced visible maybe due to the density of the beer) lends some tickling, too. This is nice.  Overall: I'm glad for this beer.

Tastes very caramel-malty, with a hops bite and lightly spiced bitterness that are noticeable but not too strong. A bit of dark fruits is also present. It's a flavorful beer, but not too overpowering.  It feels tangy and well carbonated, medium bodied.  I like this beer better from the bomber, or at least this time around I do.

Notes of caramel and buttery toffee are offset by a metallic tang in the initial aroma. Brown sugar, doughy malt, booze, and light floral hops round out the profile. Figs and dates emerge as it warms.  Flavor reveals fruity esters at the base, with cherries and dark berry notes accompanied by toasted malt and slightly sweet caramel notes. The finish is fairly dry and lightly bitter. Feels a little short.  Body is on the full side, with moderate carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  Not at all what I expect from a helles.

Pretty spectacular appearance, I like it a lot.  Smell - Big breads, a little hop and spices, and a sweetness from I will assume the malt character. Complex, nice.

The sweetness is certainly the prime mover here, although it is not too sweet. Bready, malty character. This is an exceptionally tasty brew.  Mouthfeel - Nice and heavy, goes down smooth and creamy. I really appreciate a good, smooth finishing beer, and this is one. There is a hint of lingering sweetness in the aftertaste that I like too.  Overall - This is a good beer, recommended to try.

132,355,AleEnthusiastSorensen,4.88,"Now I am an IPA man in general but no lie Rogue Breweries Dead Guy Ale is on my top five list of ales, if not the top. First brews of this beer began in the early 90's and the logo of the skeleton with the bee hive is a tribute to the Mayan holiday of the Day of the Dead.  This Mai-bock style ale intrigues the senses with it's beautiful color and, to me, rich aroma. The taste isn't too strong but neither is it too weak. I recommend this beer to both the mild/entry enthusiast to the extreme enthusiast. In my personal opinion you can't go wrong if your hanging with a Dead Guy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Dmart1223,4.37,"This one's delicious. AND I don't even know how old it is!  This beer pours a crystal clear dark amber with bubbles all up over the place. They form a thick, tan head that sticks to the glass very, very well.  It smells both bready and sweet. I'd like to say raisins, but it's really just like fruit cake. It smells like fruit cake in a good way.  But the body isn't as sweet as the smell. There's a lingering honey sweetness in the aftertaste, but it's cut off by a decent wall of bitterness -- just enough to make an appearance. It's thick and slick from the hops, which went great with the stew I ate for dinner.  This is my first Maibock, so I'm not really used to the style. But I like it. I want more of it. I has some of the more pleasant sweet and bready qualities of some Belgian and German ales, but a bite that reminds me of American beers (even though it uses European hops).  Awesome.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,DrinkSlurm,4.03,Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass at wine country Shreveport. Pours a hazy orange with a finger of white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Really nice mild sweet sugary malt aromas. Taste is bitter hop followed but the sweet malts. The hops are surprising since they were barely detected in the aroma but really well balanced and smooth. This is an awesome brew.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Muhly,3.6,"Poured from 650 ml bottle into brandy snifter.  A-Pours a slightly hazy amber with about one finger of off white head. About half of the retains pretty well. Head sticks to the side of the glass when tipped and leaves behind some thin lacing.  S-Detect some grainy malt with hardly any hop aroma.  T-Big malty flavours. More prominent and rounder than I would have expected given what was hinted at in the aroma. Get some hop bitterness, but it just serves to balance the malt. Had to remind myself that I was drinking a lager and not an ale, which for me is a good thing as most of my lager experience to date has been with unimpressive American adjunct lagers.  M-Heavy and thick, but pleasant mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  O-An interesting beer. Not what I expected, but very nicely balanced and drinkable. Expected something bigger and maybe even somewhat smoky, but once I reminded myself that this is a lager, I was realized how full of taste and smooth lagers can be! Yum, yum I will go back to this one for sure!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell consists of malt, grass, biscuit, caramel, a mixture of fruit and a hint of citrus; impressive so far.  Taste consists of heavy malt, along with a hint of caramel, toffee, biscuit pepper and pepper/spicy hops. Also has a grassy flavor to it, all the tastes have a nice balance. Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a bitter and grassy/malty finish to it.  Overall, this is a tasty and well rounded beer.

132,355,CurtFromHershey,3.86,"Pours a rich copper with dense off white head. Really an attractive beer.  Smell is very malt-forward as to be expected, with a note of sweetbread which seems out of place.  Taste does not follow the nose in that there is a nondescript bitterness. Bready malts.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a bock.  Overall a good beer and decent representation of the style, but it seems rather disjointed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Kevin73,2.61,"I guess I have a different opinion about this beer than most people. Part of my dislike may simply be the style, I will have to try more maibocks to be sure. But this one hits you over the head with bready malts and then hits you over the head again with intense honey flavor that somehow manages not to blend very well with the bitter hoppy finish. The flavors were disjointed, separate and it just didn't seem to me like a very well crafted beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, herbal, floral, toffee, earth, pepper, clove, pear, apple, and light citrus. Very nice and well balanced malty aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, herbal, floral, toffee, pine, clove, earth, pepper, pear, and light grapefruit. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pine, herbal, earth, and citrus on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavor; with good malt flavor robustness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent maibock. Nice toasty flavors with good balance and robustness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mfnmbvp,3.7,"12 oz. bottle, no apparent bottled-on date present. Haven't had a Rogue Dead Guy in a while, but I will always remember it as one of two beers that officially got me interested in craft beer, along with Bell's Oberon which I also haven't had for a while. Opening this b*tch with my church key bottle opener my mom got me for xmas.  A - Pours a light see through copper color with a lot of bubbles streaming to the top. A little 1 finger head that seems to be fading away pretty quickly.  S - Coppery, malty, reminds me of how the Rogue Santa's Private Reserve seemed to smell.  T - Again, a weird coppery sort of taste, a lot of heavy malts. I seem to not enjoy this brew as much anymore since I became addicted to IPA's, but this is still a very tasty brew. Maybe a little over-carbonated, just a bit.  M - Mouthfeel is good and clean, if maybe just a little thick. The malts hang out on your tongue.  Overall, Rogue is one of my favorite breweries for damn sure, and the Rogue Dead Guy Ale is probably their landmark beer, so if you haven't tried anything by them yet (which is doubtful to say the least, if you've read this far) then start out with this one and work your way onwards.  Rogue Dead Guy Ale--- 4/5.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Philly82785,4.3,This beer pours a nice copper color. The nose is similar to a traditional brown ale with charred grain. Comes across the palate smoothly.

132,355,cousineddy,4.11,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  Appearence: beautiful deep amber red color, more bubbly than i expected. A perfect 3 fingers of off white/tan head with great lacing  Smell: Sweet roasted malt notes meld nicely with citrusy hop aroma. Molasses and sorghum  Taste: Starts off sweet with more molasses flavor. moves into the bitter realm as the hops take over. Finishes very clean  Mouthfeel: Nice balance, not too thin or too chewy. Bubbly but not overly so.  Overall: Lives up to everything ive heard about Dead Guy. A must try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S: Very strong malty sweetness, ginger spiciness to it. very nice  T: Malty sweet, slight fruit and ginger or raisin taste, matched the smell very well  M: clean medium body, with a crisp dry finish  O: Great overall beer, I liked the overall look and taste of the beer it reminded more of a homebrew than a typical craft beer. Good drinking, higher alcohal than most session beers, but much better tasting without hitting the double digit alcohal levels of alot of newer craft beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

M - Mildy carbonated, medium-full body. Very drinkable  O - This is a very drinkable beer, although I would only drink it in moderation as it's pretty sweet. This would go good along with steak or a dessert. The Caramel and Toffee taste is great and this is a unique beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SerialTicker,4,"Appearance: Pours a nice, super hazy apple cider-like color. The head is creamy and about a finger thick. I figured the lacing would be awesome, but it's just decent.  Smell: This is my first of this style. It smells interesting. No doubt a load of malts, but almost a caramel smell as well. The alcohol is also very present.  Taste/feel: Much like the smell, to be honest. There's also a slight ""funk"" in there that's actually not too unnerving. I also pick up some dark fruits in the back somewhere (prunes?), as well as a tad of tartness. A pretty sweet beer on the start, but a bit of bitterness and spice at the end. Rather balanced, and nothing overwhelming. The feel is creamy and perfect with the amount of carbonation, which is low. Alcohol is also present.  Dead Guy Ale grew on me throughout the glass, but I still don't quite believe it's worth the $2.79 I paid for the bottle -- SLIGHTLY overpriced. Regardless of that though, this is a tasty beer. It looks great, it feels great, and it has a very solid taste that's fairly mild, yet keeps you drinking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Mojo,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into Samuel Adams perfect pint.  This one pours up a clear amber with a small white head and leaves a little bit of lacing.

Mouthfeel is fine, but nothing wonderful. This beer is easy drinking and I would recommend it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Lots of big bread malt, caramel, floral notes, and some alcohol flavor  M- Very smooth, pretty creamy, prickly carbonation, some alcohol warming, and highly drinkable  O- This is really a great readily available six-pack beer.

Lacing is good, with a fair amount of retention. Second pour from the bomber gives a much cloudier clarity from the yeast.  S: Sweet malts are prominent in the aroma, with caramel, dark fruits and treacle. Very nice  T: Taste is first about the bready malts and an initial sweetness of raisins (raisin bread!). Then you get a dose of earthy and spicy hop bitterness.  M: Clean mouthfeel and medium-bodied. Carbonation is in the medium-to-high range. Finishes with a good balance of bitterness and malts.

Finish is slightly bitter and grainy with some fruitiness and spiciness.  M - Light-medium body, smooth and creamy. Crisp, refreshing, mild carbonation.  O - A very tasty bock style beer.

132,355,Luigi,4.8,"Served in a stemmed pilsner glass. Mildly hazy copper coloring with honey gold highlights when held to a light. The head is three fingers tall and ever sip leaves an almost chunky ring around the glass. Perfect head retention as it stays around as a thick blanket covering the brew till the last drop.  Smells sweet and malty with some honey and ripe citrus fruit from the hop.  The taste is full of toasted bread, sweet citrus, honey, and little bit of boozy sweetness, and dry bitter hop on the palate. Finises dry and bitter sweet.  Medium bodied, a little slick on the palate, but the drink-ability of this beer is dangerous! It does not have the alcohol volume of a session beer but it is so easy to drink!

132,355,OneDropSoup,3.75,"Poured into a shaker pint: Hazy caramel orange body with 2 fingers of custard-colored head that's a little wavy & retains nicely.  Immediately get a honey-like sweetness & some orange candy in the smell, like an orange creamsicle, a little vanilla. Kind of reminds me of the orange & carrot jello my grandmother makes, sweet & fruit with just a little earthy bitterness, but not much. If I didn't know better, I'd say the vanilla has an almost bourbon character to it, but very subtle. Nice.  A lot of the same characteristics of the aroma come through in the taste: orange, vanilla, caramel, a leafy tea-like bitterness that finishes & lasts in the aftertaste. That bitterness isn't really evident in the aroma, but in the taste it goes a great job of balancing this & making what would be an otherwise super-sweet beer in something very drinkable. There's a little of the stony dryness in the finish, too, that I get from a lot of lagers, so even though I know they use an ale yeast, there's still something lager-esque about this.  Would like a little more body in the mouthfeel, but not bad. Medium-bodied, kind of lightens out toward the end.  This was the first beer I'd ever had from Rogue, in my favorite early days of drinking craft beer, & coming back to it was mighty pleasurable. A good drinker with some assertive character to it that's not going to knock you down.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ThisWangsChung,3.18,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a dark copper color that's clear, but not perfectly so. There's about one fingers worth of barely offwhite head which retains itself sufficiently. A nice film of lacing is left on the side of the glass, as well.  S: There's quite a bit of caramel on the nose, and - dare I say - it's faintly chocolaty as well. The noble hops give a nice grassiness to it, and makes it different from the dime-a-dozen IPA with crystal malts and Cascade hops. I don't know why I'm comparing it to the average IPA, I should be thinking of it as a maibock with ale yeast...  T: Tastes exactly like I expected it to - which is a maibock with ale yeast. It has that sort of pumpernickel bread flavor to it I expect from the average bock, only a bit lighter. The finish is pleasantly hoppy, but the problem is, the initial flavors and the finish don't really do much to differentiate itself, so it's kind of one note. I can see why this has a following, though.  M: Rogue did a decent job of keeping this crisp without the lager yeast, but the body itself is too heavy for the flavors they present and the carbonation doesn't make it seem any lighter. Despite that, this is easy to drink.  O: This beer represents a conundrum for me. It's the kind of middle of the road daily drinker I envisioned it would be - but it's priced just out of said middle of the road daily drinker range at $12/6 pk. For that reason, I wouldn't pick this up over offerings from Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, or the like.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T: Early bitter taste that quickly fades. Hoppy throughout. A little citrusy in flavor, which is where the bitterness comes in. Well-balanced.  M: Carbonated well. Coats the mouth and leaves you wanting to keep drinking.  Overall: One of my favorite beers. It isn't flashy at all. Just balanced and well-put together. Great beer overall and a must have for any fan of ales.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell is on the sweet end, but not overpowering. Malty and a bit of carmel. Taste is rather unique. My first Mailbock and I wasn't disappointed. Front end is loaded with carmel malts that give way to a nice hop balance. Very well balanced beer that keeps you coming back for more. Picked up a bready, nutty profile as well that is subtle. Feel is nice and full with good carbonation and silky ending. Overall- A very surprising brew. Balanced and full of flavor. nice carmel, sweet front with hop balance.

The nose is full of a nice mix of hops, malts, a bit of sweetness, and a touch of woody/nutty undertones. The beer is fairly smooth and has a heavy malt character with a light toffee/caramel flavor and a bit of biscuit yeast that comes alone. Some very faint hop presence can be detected, but only if you're really looking for it. Medium body and medium carbonation with a nice, malt flavored finish.  Decent beer, here.

S: The aroma is sweet and malty. Some caramel notes and slight fruit that I couldnt put my finger on. T: This has a nice mouth covering taste. There is a nice low level bitterness at the front that fades by the swallow. Sweet malt is the main flavor that balances with the hop bitterness in a fun back and forth manner. The aftertaste is nice and disappears relatively quickly. M: Medium to full body, very creamy and a little sticky from the sugars. Good medium carbonation to support the body to make it very drinkable. O: I really liked this beer and not sure why it took so long to get around to trying it.

132,355,BlackBelt5112203,4.06,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass at fridge-cellar temperature.  L – Deep amber color with a 1.5-finger cream-colored bubbly head. Pretty good retention but only a little bit of patchy bubbly lacing. Clear with good carbonation. It’s a little dark for a maibock, and I’d like to see better head characteristics.  S – Lots of malt with bready, toasty, and molasses aromas predominately. There are some fruity aromas, possibly cherry or apple, and a hint of floral hops.  T – Starts off sweet with rich bready and toasted malt. Sugary molasses sweetness picks up in the middle, along with the cherry and apple fruit flavors. It closes with a smoothly bitter floral and spicy hop finish.  F – Medium-bodied with good carbonation, a sticky and creamy mouthfeel, and a bitter and dry finish. Rich malty sweetness and hop spiciness linger for a nice amount of time.  O – This is a really nice beer and probably one of my favorites from Rogue. It is a nice example of the style with lots of malt and just enough hops to give a little kick to the finish.

This ale came in a six pack for 12$ at Randall's in fairview heights, IL. -THE APPEARANCE of this ale is excellent. I poured it into a large beer mug for observation. The color is a beautiful copper/red, with a medium to light carbonation which keeps a pleasant thin, light tan foam on top until you're done. -THE SMELL is pretty faint, to me. Kind of smells like fresh grapefruit and sweet pear. -THE TASTE is definitely a little hoppy kick compared to other ales I have tried, while there is also a clear taste of that grapefruit and pear I had stated in the smell. Some sweet honey also comes along while you get further into the ale. -THE FEEL of this ale is quite exceptional to myself. Some nice carbonation fills your mouth with every tip of the glass, goes down nice and easy, and leaves a wonderful strong taste in the back of your mouth for a few minutes. -OVERALL, this beer is awesome. I WILL be having this again, and again And again. I can't wait to try more rogue brews. If you are looking for a great semi-dark ale, look no further, rogue's dead guy will steal your love for plenty of other beers, and capture your attention quick.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BOSMECH,3.65,"S had it after work with workers in a bottle.  A good size thick head, medium copper color.  S Good light ipa ale smell.  T rich dark distinctive bitter taste with mallty taste.  M smooth ale flavor and then you get the malt and light hop taste.  O it is a good beer but I would soon rather get better beer for the money.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dmatsui,3.53,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Sudsy bone-white 3-finger head dissapated pretty quickly, left nice lacing. The beer itself is a burnt orange/amber with a brownish hue and crystal clear.  Not much happening in the nose. Some malty sweetness and a tart hop presence.  A lot hoppier than I thought it was going to be. There's a nice hop spice with good floral qualities and a definite boozy warmth which adds a medicinal quality to the brew. The malt bill is very well balanced with some syrupy sweetness and a touch of rye-like quality. Understated but well balanced.  This beer has a really nice slick, full and creamy mouthfeel. It also feels very clean and super smooth.  Overall a very good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,tmq204,3.78,"Rogue Dead Guy - First review, be gentle...  Poured into a pint glass from the 22 ouncer. Beautiful copper to amber color with about 1.5 fingers of head. The nose is a lot of malt, some pear and caramel. Taste is mostly malt sweetness, barely any hops at all. A bit of alcohol bite towards the finish. Mouthfeel is very light carbonation, almost flat.  Overall, I love Rogue beers and I can't believe I haven't tried this one yet. I think it's missing a bit of hoppiness in favor of drinkability, and at 6.5% alcohol, it has a very smooth taste (I'm new to Maibocks so that may be whole point). Good beer, definitely would drink again if I'm looking for sweetness in lieu of hop.  Cheers",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WastingFreetime,3.97,"Reviewed from session notes.  Pours out a lightly hazed reddish-coppery color with about two minute's worth of head that dies back to a persistent 4mm collar ring with minimal lacing qualities on the inside of the glass. Smells a bit like candied yams, a bit like caramel-covered pears, and partially like a toasted blend of chestnuts and hazelnuts. The smooth-textured brew tastes primarily of caramel-covered pears mixed with a small amount of dried prunes, brown sugar sprinkles, and finishes with an abrupt yet satisfyingly drying herbal and floral hopping finish. Memorable for the profound transformation from bock sweetness to a balanced pale ale kind of bitterness in the finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hoppsbabo,4.13,"Why is this just a Maibock and not an American Maibock? This is nothing like the authentic German style.  A: My favourite beer look. A pleasant amber with a small but sustaining light beige head. Looks like Orval.  S: Smells exactly the same as Rogue's American Amber Ale. A sickly caramel/fruit combination. Buggered if I could pick out the particular fruit, but maybe it's pineapple.  T: Hey, very nice. English spicyness (as opposed to Belgian), Lovely mouthfeel. The spicyness and caramel work beautifully together. German lager? More like a fizzy English/US pale ale. Very nicely balanced. The bitterness is bang on the money.  O: Easily the best Rogue beer I've had so far. My only complaint is that in Korea it only comes in pissy 12 ounce bottles. Definitely one to have again though. Good job!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,cradke,3.85,"Appearance: Tan with brown and gold hues. Decent sized head, streaming carbonation.  Smell: Malty and sweet. Good hop aroma.  Taste: Carmel malt and sweetness at first. Brown sugar through the middle, clean bitter finish. Nothing earth shattering either way but nice and pleasant.  Mouthfeel: A little bit thin but still substantial. Good carbonation.  Overall: More of a sentimental favorite than anything else. This beer really caught me off guard and brought me into craft. Maybe it's the evolution of my taste buds to bigger and better things but it's not as incredible as I remember. Still, I really enjoy the beer. It's got good flavor, it's pleasant and very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jemonster,4.53,"A: Hazy honey gold. Lighter in color than I thought it would be for some reason. Glows nicely in the light. Puffy beige head.  S: Fresh hops up front. Fragrant. Light sourdough toast and butter. Also, fresh rain on clean asphalt (A good thing). Some soapy hints.  T: Man this stuff is good. Not sure if I'm just craving beer, or this beer is making me crave beer. Clean where it needs to be, clearly floral hop character with low bitterness and some oat sweetness. Some kind of fatty, buttery richness. Pungent spices at the end.  M: Interesting because it seems thin and cool at first, and heavier when the bitter flavors kick in around the middle of the gulp.  O: This is great, no wonder everyone loves it. My bottle is about 8 months old. Very good, solid, easy to drink, yet flavorful and bold beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S) Hints of herbal and caramel lead the way with a distinct citrus aroma sifting it's way in.  T) WOW! Dead on for the style... perfect blend of toasted malt and dark fruits going on here. It's followed up well with an ever so slight snip of hops leaving a clean bitterness to linger. Delicous!  M) Quite possibly the best finishing ale i have experienced to date! What an extremely smooth, medium bodied, work of art. Is this really 6.5%? Sure the hell is, this could be dangerous!  O) Note to Rogue.... don't change a thing here... what an excellent Maibock.

132,355,ZachStone625,4.67,"My goodness - what a treat.  This is a crisp, refreshing beer with a slightly sweet, mild taste. The malty, grainy, biscuity tastes start with a perfect amount of carbonation before giving way to a slight dash of springy hop bitterness then finishing clean, dry, and crisp. By the time you've swallowed and smacked your lips a couple of times the flavor still lingers but there's absolutely no unpleasant aftertaste. None. No overpowering malt, no boozy overtone, no hop lawn trimmings 'n' bitters to sour up your palate - just a pleasant warm flavor lingering for a bit leaving you craving for more. The balance in this ale is phenomenal. A great spring or summertime beer, like a lazy sunny afternoon after finishing lots of outdoor work.  The alcohol is very well masked, as other posts have emphasized the 6.5% ABV will sneak up on you. And it is hard to just have one, so after you get your first plan on hanging out for a while.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Mouthfeel:   Light to medium body.  Moderate carbonation.  Overall:  One of the best maibocks I have had.  Dead guy ale is an easy drinking beer that will appeal to most beer lovers.

132,355,TownDunkel,4.32,"Rouge Dead Guy Ale - I always have seen this one around but never decided to try it till today.  Appearance - A nice medium bold brown for an ale. I was thinking it would pour darker maybe but still a very proud color  Smell - A nice round of dark hoppy goodness with a mix of dark fruit and maybe a hint of molasses. A good complex smell on it.  Taste - A real dark hit as you take your first sip that mellows out to a fine dark fruit to a more smooth chocolate at the end. Exceptional  Mouthfeel - A good carbonation matches this beer that extendeds the sweet aftertaste for several minutes.  Overall - A great beer that I will buy again.

The taste virtually follows the smell. Tastes hoppy, Some light malt, Some wet bread and slightly strong skunk. Weird for the type, Eh?, It all piled together nicely thought. The mouthfeel somewhat follows, Though it allows more of the skunk to come through. Overall, A VERY easy to drink beer. Seriously, I would buy this for ANY occasion.

132,355,CraftBeerTastic,3.97,Ba Review #201 Served On: 07/25/2012 Glassware: Pint Glass Labeled ABV: - Date/ Code: -  Found this at Dewey Beach Liquors while on vacationing at Dewey Beach.  Look: Poured into a tumbler pint. Dark copper color with tingers of gold along the edges of the glass. Head was 2-fingers of off-white foam that dessolved into an even coating with some sparatic head lacing. Carbonation bubbles were slow and steady.  Smell: Slight floral hop aroma with more spice than anything. Also some heavy biscuit with some booze mixed in.  Taste: First up was a hoppy floral note followed by a biscuity sweetness. Then a spicy alchaol wamth coated the mouth with a bitterness taking over for the finish. The aftertaste was a fruity note that lingered for a while.  This beer was wonderful. Using ale yeast for a Lager stye seemed to have worked well for Rogue. Probably the best Maibock I've had so far.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,willmc,3.98,"bottom line, this is one of my go to beers. after a long day, or just hangin' with my fellow beer geeks, dead guy is a wonderful all around beer. with aromas of malty sweet carmel and hints of fruitness that reminds of fall weather. it's the tastes that packs the punch though. wonderful complex notes of malt and hops, spices of nutmeg and clove. a great bitter finish that hop lovers can respect. cheers to rogue for their Dead Guy Ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,davecavemaster,4,"I had heard of Rouge Brewery, an Oregon establishment that specializes in ales, but had never partaken of their creations. Well, finally got my chance when I saw Dead Guy Ale sitting on the shelf at Kroger's. On a side note, I must say that Kroger's has definitely stepped up their game in terms of beer selections.  Anyway, This is a German Maibock Style  Beer Lesson: Pronounced ""My Bock,"" translates into ""May Bock"". Named for being a transitional beer between the harsh Winter and the coming Spring.  Dead Guy has a 6.5% alcohol content, so it's not something you want to be drinking while you're trying to match your bonehead friend who is slamming bud lights. This brew has a dark honey color, and a great head when poured. It is one substantial brew, I couldn't even see through my pint glass. Wonderful! Look forward to a very rich flavor, and a toasty, malty aroma.  This brewery also does some distilling, I can't wait to try some more of thier products. Enjoy!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,57md,4.08,"Pours orangish-copper with a finger and a half of head, some of which retained and left a touch of lacing on the glass. Nose is mildly floral. Taste is earthy with an excellent combination of hop bitterness and dryness on the finish. Deceptively easy to knock back.

132,355,DaveBlack,3.78,"A: Aggressive pour yields approx. 2 fingers of slightly off-white head which has a rather long retention and leaves some nice lacing. The beer itself is a cloudy copper color  S: Quite a strong smelling beer. VERY sweet aroma, but mostly all I get is malts and a slight cereal grain smell.  T: Once again, the primary favor is that of toasted malts, which bring a great deal of sweetness to the table along with a pleasant graininess. Too much sweetness perhaps, for the amount of hops that try to balance it out at the end.  M: Medium bodied, low carbonation makes it easy to drink.  O: A good beer, but not, in my opinion, a great one. The sweetness is a little overwhelming, and I don't know that I would want more than one or two.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

O - it has been along time since I've had this but it's still pretty good. Not a hugely impressive style to be honest but Rogue does it really well. Easy to drink.

132,355,Ilafan,3.3,"Slightly below its rather lofty reputation.  I like the amberish color when poured, and the aroma of hops is quite pleasing.

A gentle pour it was about 1/4"" if that.  Smell: Very bland but still good, light caramel/maple notes in the scent scent department.  This beer packs flavor, little bit of everything malty and a notch bitter sweet. Definitely has a floral after feel but not to be confused with an IPA very unique in it's own way.  Mouth: Smooth with a medium carbonation at best. there's no overkill in carbonation which is a good thing with this beer.  Overall: You have to be kidding yourself not to grab a bottle. I have enjoyed it beginning to end and loved every bit of it. Salud!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Retention is great, thin but dense layer of head remains across the surface ~15 minutes later, the head crawls up the side of the glass, fantastic lacing. Perfect looking. Steady carbonation.  S - Slightly sweet grainy malt profile and a subtle noble/grassy hop aroma, possibly a slight spice. An ok combination of flavors but a little moderate for my liking.  T - Sweet grainy flavor, the hops compliment the malt profile very well actually, a little bit of a spiced flavor followed by a semi-faint grassy (pilsner-like from the Saaz no dbout) hop profile. Very nice crisp finish!  M - Fairly light, very very drinkable, appropriate carbonation.  O - Overall its a very well put together brew, I think this beer is exactly what they'd hoped it would be.

132,355,StonedTrippin,4,"totally unlike any other bock ive tried, and certainly a departure from traditional bocks, but this is a very unique ale that has become a bit of a legend in the USA. the smell is odd to me, sweet and malty, but also spiced to a degree, and hopped like only a west coast beer can be. the flavor features heavy hops on the back end, which is not common in a spring bock. the malts do the rest of the work, layering in a ton of complexity to this. i also get some woody notes and a touch of dried fruit. mouthfeel works, its heavier in the body but the carbonation is very high, which makes for a pleasant experience not like many others. overall this is an excellent brew, but i dont want to drink a whole 6pack. just gets too heavy and sweet after a bunch of them, but one or two every so often is really nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,jazzyjeff13,3.63,"A 12oz bottle with no visible BB date. Acquired recently from Great Grog in Edinburgh. Been looking forward to trying this one.  Poured into a tulip pint glass. A hazy orange-amber hue with medium carbonation and fine sediment. Forms a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding. Aroma of sweet, grainy caramel malt with hints of aromatic hops and yeast. Also a note of young cheese(?!). A whiff of alcohol in the background.  Tastes of sweet caramel malt with a dry finish. Notes of grain, brown sugar, subtle citrus, stewed hops and yeast. Possesses a spicy quality like clove or coriander (more a sensation than a flavour). A restrained piny bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth with fantastic body and tingly carbonation. Somewhat astringent. Aftertaste of caramel malt and hop bitterness.  Not bad, but a bit disappointing after hearing so much talk of how great it is. A nice malty character and fantastic mouthfeel, but the hops have gone missing. Some hop aroma and bitterness but not much. The only culprit I can imagine is age; this has probably been sitting around over here for too long.

132,355,thehyperduck,4.27,"Regular 355 mL bottle from a six-pack; packaged in April 2012. I was very surprised to see this at my local LCBO - although I know the chain has been bringing in limited amounts of American craft beer for a while now, they never seem to bother stocking it at any of the Sarnia outlets. So when I recognized the name, I did a bit of a double-take, and then quickly scooped up one of the few remaining sixers.  Pours a hazy amber-orange colour, topped with roughly one finger's worth of fizzy, off-white head. The retention leaves a bit to be desired as the head is mostly gone within a minute, leaving a soapy film on the surface... at least it's easy to kick back up with a few swirls of the glass. Not an impressive brew to look at, but it sure smells good! The great balance between sweet, bready caramel-and-toffee malts and fresh, piney-citrusy hop notes has me eager to taste this one, even if the aroma reminds me more of an A/IPA than a maibock.  The taste confirms my suspicion that this isn't an orthodox-style maibock - but this is more of an observation than a complaint. Objectively, it's really tasty stuff, and enjoyable flavour is my main concern with most beer styles. Starts off big and malty, lots of honey and toffee with some underlying fruity plum notes. Much like the aroma though, the taste is all about careful balance, and the hops (with their grapefruit-and-pine-resin dryness) are not likely to be lost amongst the big malts. Aftertaste leans toward the bitter side, making this the sort of brew that encourages quick sipping. Medium-bodied, with a slightly syrupy feel on the tongue. Relatively mild carbonation gives it a very smooth feel going down.  This is the last bottle in the six-pack - I plowed through the first 5 in a day or two and saved this one until I had time to review it. If this stuff were reliably available around here, there is little doubt in my mind that I would get it regularly. It's worth the price.  Final Grade: 4.27, on the high end of an A-. This beer gets a lot of praise in BA circles, and now having tried it, I see that this praise is entirely justified. This stuff is delicious, perfectly balanced and deceptively drinkable for a 6.6% brew. It is not a traditional maibock, as it definitely possesses some features that seem decidedly 'pale ale-inspired'. But even if you can't stuff Dead Guy Ale into a neat little labelled box, it's a brew that no self-respecting beer geek should hesitate to try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,SawDog505,3.41,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, no sign of a bottled date on Rogue beers. Pours a cloudy orange with a one inch white head, with attractive lacing. Smell is clove, brown sugar, lemon pepper, and figs. Taste is very sweet brown sugar, clove, and fig dominate. Body is medium, enough life, not overly dry, and drinkable. Not my favorite style, for malt lovers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nofalltoofar,4.43,"A: It's a pretty beer, nice amber with a bit of red in it. The head disappeared almost immediately leaving very little lacing on the glass.  S: It doesn't have a strong scent to it. You pick up some grain notes and some hops.  T: It has a great middle-level flavor, not too dark or too light. The grain is readily present along with citrus and some caramel and sweeter tones. It has some hop notes, but not much in the way of bitterness. It's a very drinkable beer without being pedestrian.  M: This is where the beer really takes no prisoners. It's sooth with the exact right consistency. It's carbonated, but not overly so. It goes down well and doesn't tickle the throat too much. It feels refreshing.  I got this beer at the Continental Tavern in Yardley, PA not knowing what to expect. I was taken aback immediately by the two highest qualities of this beer: its craftsmanship and its drinkability. This beer is incredibly easy to enjoy and is downright tasty (as opposed to savory). I will definitely look out for this ale next time I see it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,standorsey,3.79,"Noticed this 6-pack tucked away in the corner of the refrig at my local liquor store, sporting a $14.99 price tag. Had to try it just to see what that price buys you these days. I wasn't disappointed, but not exactly knocked over. A solid, balanced beer, that doesn't carry any one defining characteristic. More maltish in taste than anything. Certainly not hop-heavy. It's the mix that does the rick here and makes this an eminently drinkable brew. Hard to have just one. It could be a good staple beer, if it weren't for the cost.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,KingRascal,4.41,"Look: Deep translucent gold/amber with a thick tan/white head  Aroma: Dark malted barley aroma  Taste: Nice wheat with hop accented flavor and medium bitterness.

132,355,TechTriumph,4.14,"From notes on 04/08/12: Bottle code: 250 A1 0729; Poured in a pint glass.  A - Less than an inch of off-white creamy head that disappears fairly quick; Dark orange hued amber in color; Cloudy appearance, but I can still see floating sediment; No traces of lacing at all  S - Pleasant notes of clove, esters, citrus, sweetness, caramel, herbs, light toast, and light spice  T - Lightly fruity taste with lemony/orange citrus flavors, as well as floral, herbal, minty, and butterscotch characteristics; Good malt backbone too with sweet caramel and toasty flavors, There's a bit of bitterness that brings some balance to the sweetness; Not really tasting any alcohol flavor  M - Moderate carbonation; Medium bodied; Fairly smooth behind the zest of the carbonation; Crisp with a lightly dry finish  O - I haven't had too many Rogue beers up to this point, but this one is probably my favorite thus far. It's smooth and very drinkable, with a pleasant, refreshing taste that makes me wish I had a few more of these to drink. The taste does an excellent job of having the malts, hops, sweetness, and bitterness all fit together beautifully. I can certainly see why this beer is available year-round as it would be easy to enjoy no matter the season.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,omokoro,4.22,"Pours a clear light amber with a one finger head. Lots of tiny bubbles rising to the top of the glass. It smells of clove and clean malt. This beer has an interesting character. Up front is the spicy, earthy, clove notes. The middle is kind of bread like, and it ends a bit of a bite. It stays on the palate. This beer wants you to drink more of it. And I will.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,DeltaGolfSierra,3.92,"Appearance is dark copper to light brown with an orange hue; the moderate head doesn't last very long. Scents are of fresh baked bread with a bit of citrus and grass. The taste is mainly roasted malt - bready and nutty, and a bit sweet, but with a hint of grassy and floral notes. The flavors all work really well together. Very low bitterness, and very drinkable. Solidly good all-around. This might make a good beer to transition someone into the craft beer world from BMC products.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Wet and a little spiked. 3.5  Overall, a nice maibock. Love the misnomer in the name. Classic Rogue flagship product. 4.0",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ChrisCage,4.34,"A- Pours a hazy copper/orange hued color, with many columns of finer looking carbonation rising to the top. The head, while retaining rather well, isn't very thick from the pour right to settling, but that's ok I guess. As for lacing, it's modest, with trims of foam clinging to the glass.  S- Sweet aromas all around...and primarily of malt and honey. I guess you could say that there is a slightly citrus-like note hidden as well that reminds me of lemongrass, as it is slightly Earthy at the same time. The finish smells clean, with mild aromas of hop and a somewhat grassy smell too.  T- Again, the flavors follow the aromas closely, but I find it a lot more balanced overall. Upfront, the malt/honeyed sweetness comes through, and is countered by a clean dry grassy goodness, and finished off with more noticeable bitterness from the hops. Malt sweetness lingers on the palate after the swallow. A perfectly flavored beer in my opinion!  M- Solid medium body, but it doesn't feel chewy in the slightest! The carbonation, as it appeared, is fine, and breaks at the right time to allow the full flavor to penetrate the taste buds. A very nice feeling on the palate!  O- I have to agree with the majority on this one...this is an exceptional brew! Full flavored without overdoing it, yet clean and crisp, this makes a great beer to enjoy during hot weather, such as I did, or even to compliment a meal! I recommend this one and hope to enjoy many more of these to come!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,deadonhisfeet,4.03,"Haven't had this in a while! Pours out of the bottle a beautiful semi-hazy coppery gold with a nice fluffy head. Nose is malty and nutty with a faint grassy note.  Flavor is malt-forward with lots of bready, chewey flavors. It is medium-bodied with a good firm mouthfeel. At mid-palate, there is a mild hop presence that joins all the malt, lending it a nice faint citrus-like note. The flavors all seem to linger together on the finish.  This is simply a classic American-brewed beer that is true to its style. Thankfully, it enjoys a wide distribution and is a worthy companion in your glass any time of day, any time of year.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,brureview,4.23,"Served in a Pilsner glass. Light honey-colored with a three fingered head. It was good viewing this beer in a Pilsner with bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass towards the head.  A slight lemon smell from the head. The mouth feel is quite pleasant-carbonated and slightly malty. The finish was excellent- licorice, honey- sweet and a slight bitterness which doesn't offset the taste.  I put the bottle in the freezer for about 25 minutes- this was a perfect temperature for drinking. I had tried a sample in a bar- it was too cold and lackluster( perhaps the music was too loud and interfered with my sense of taste:)  This beer should be served on the warm side, and preferably in a pilsner. Will try again!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ChrisPratz,4.33,"A: Pours a nice deep brown/amber color with a thin haze and a fingers with of foam on the head. This thins to a very thin lace around the edge of the glass and several swirls of lace in the middle.  S: Deep malt scents with a sweetness of honey and dark fruit. Also some scents of grains and wheat. Very enjoyable.  T: Excellent flavor, my mouth is in heaven right now. Deep berry flavors and some honey that aren't overly sweet mixing all around with some hints of wheat and grassyness that I first noticed on my nose. I think the thing that makes it so enjoyable is that you can taste the fruit but it isn't overpoweringly sweet. Some malt flavors come thru as well and then floral hoppyness with very little bitterness. This is my kind of beer.  M: Mild carbonation, leaves a creamy coated feeling in your mouth. ABV leaves a dry feeling at the end but not so much that it is unenjoyable.  O: Wow, just really really impressed with this beer. My first journey in the Rogue line of brews, it came highly recommended and I can see why. They've done a great job here, and i've love to try it on tap.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,lsummers,4.27,"Poured a nice golden red, with a very small amount of lacing and little head other than a small white ring. Smells of honey molasses citrus notes. The taste is great, it leads with a little sweetness then goes into full blown malty goodness with a touch of honey. Overall I won't hesitate to purchase this again. Only problem is I have a hard time taking my time with such a tasty beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Drinkerofales,3.65,"Pours clear golden amber with a huge tan head. Plenty of lace decorates the glass but the head quickly dissipated with not much retention.  Smell is malt husks, honey, and lightly fruity.  Taste is of dry malts, very light and crisp.  Lighter in texture and easy to drink. Seemingly low carbonation makes for an ok drink.  A fine beer, but nothing over the top here, in fact, almost boring. However, still a big beer in comparison to BMC.  DOA",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Plenty of carbonation bubbles raising to join the head. Just a little cloudy.  S: Sweet caramel with a touch of honey and pine. Also, some grassy and earthy hops come through.  M: Medium body and a fair amount of carbonation, and a little dry.  T: Sweet caramel malt backbone and some honey, just like the aroma. Some earthy pine and resin balance the sweetness, and there is just a touch of floral and citrus, too.  O: The sweetnes really works well in this beer. A great mix of caramel and honey blends well with the piney hops. This is a beer worth seeking out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Clones21,2.79,"Just not my kind of beer. I'm not a fan of Pale Ale's so bare with me here. The taste just was bland for me. Too bitter and spicy. I thought the color was good looking and the smell was awesome. But the taste really made me sad. I wanted to really like this beer(it was really expensive). I have heard good things about Rogue, but maybe I should stick to their stouts and porters.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bigolbeerbelly,4.76,Poured from bottle to pint glass.  A: amber with frothy perfect head.  S: malty. With some slight hops and citrus  T: deliciousness. This beer is what all other amber's aspire to be. Perfect balance of hops and malts  M: low Carb burn.

132,355,jmerloni,4.35,"A - Amber in coloration, clear, nice white head that laces really nicely.  S - Yeast, roasty malts, berries.  T - Tastes like a bunch of chocolate-covered berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries), roasted in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes, and turned into beer. Very unique. I don't necessarily love the taste of this, but it sure is distinct. It tastes like spring. It tastes like a gay parade with a lot of decorative floats in a city in France at the turn of the and 20th century. A beer that tastes happy, like it's celebrating, ostentatiously and care-free.  M - Beery. Medium-bodied with hops evenly balanced throughout each sip. Dry enough that you can get this awesome berry-kick aftertaste every sip.  D - A bold beer. To make this beer takes balls and kudos to Rogue for crafting it. This is a beer that tastes like it's in love with itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Tucquan,3.8,"Had this on 2012-04-12 in Columbia, PA  A - Moderately hazy amber with a 2-finger off-white head and good lacing.  S - Rising bread, caramel malt, touch of citrus and light hop floral. Pleasant.  T - Orange flesh and sourdough bread, some caramel, mineral and metallic, a good amount of pungent hop tang and orange rind bitterness. The tart citrus, mineral and bitterness lasts long into the aftertaste.  M - Medium body and carbonation. Substantial, prickly, good.  O - I'd had this on-tap at the brewery but hadn't reviewed it then so it is nice to revisit this brew. It's like you mixed a Maibock and an IPA 50/50. I dig it but knocked off 1/2 point in taste for the mineral/metallic flavor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A half-finger's worth of white head, low visible carbonation.  S: Bready toasty malt, a touch of hop bitterness and some caramel sweetness.  T: Chewy bready toasted malt, malt sweetness, and mild noble hops. Lager yeast flavors increase as it warms. My biggest complaint is just a bit of cardboard oxidation flavor. The hang is clean, almost absent.  M: Medium body, low alcohol presence, chewy mouthfeel, carbonation just a bit on the low side.  O: This one was a pretty decent offering from Rogue. It wasn't the best Maibock around, but still quite enjoyable. I've got to mark it down a little for the oxidation, but may revisit this at some point and see if what just a batch (or line) issue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BucannonXC5,3.33,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a pint glass. Just about one finger of head. Color was orange caramel. Light lacing on the top that dissipated into a small circle rather quickly. No film on the sides throughout the pour.  Smelled caramel malts up front. Lots of malts actually. Got some light citrus notes, maybe orange?  Tasted pretty close to the smell. Got lots of caramel notes. Also some sugary malts, honey and maybe even toffee. Slight hint of corn in there as well. Nothing too complex here.  Medium body. Sticky texture. Below average carbonation. Abrupt watery finish.  Nothing special about this beer except the name.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,haazer,3.05,"A- Beer pours an interesting copper, and a slight cherry color. Evident bubbles throughout the brew. A thick cap of chunky white head bubbles up and settles down slowly.  S- A spice filled lager yeast upfront. The malts are strong, and has a zesty pilsner type hop presence. Pretty meh though, nothing great.  T- The taste starts out as a baked bready crumb, and begins to transition into a brief hop bite. Theres a dry cracker crispness in the flavor, and all the while a caramel malt background.  M- Smooth, medium bodied brew with crsip level carbonation. Theres a film like texture in the finish, not in a gross kinda way but adds another dimension to the beer that makes it more than just a light drinking lager.  O- Dead guy ale is a crisp refreshing brew that is easy to drink. Not the best from Rogue's by any means but a nice staple for them.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Very average. Taste is similar- Sweet biscuit malt that starts dry but finishes wet and sugary. The bitterness of the hops hit you right away quickly fading into the malt with a lemon zest finish. Well balanced but maybe a little sweet. The mouthfeel is great: creamy and full feeling, yet well carbonated and crisp.  Interesting brew.

132,355,DM1293,3.73,"I was told this was more akin to a pale ale. Anyone who's tried this should probably say otherwise to that.  There is a hop tang to it, but its definitely in the background flavors. Up front is more of a toasty malt flavor...and any flavors in the middle I can't begin to describe. Picked up a few notes of butterscotch here and there. On the whole, its exceptionally drinkable and really smooth.  I give it points for being refreshing, but its still kind of thick on the palate afterward.  Overall, I wish the hops were a little brighter to really counter the toastiness I get. I had trouble picking out flavors...I don't really get any of the fruity notes some people put forth (unless its interfering with the hop...or IS the hop). Its good on the whole, but after having Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Shakespeare Stout, I had much higher expectations for the flavor. Still, a solid beer from Rogue, and I wouldn't mind drinking it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Scent is very clean, great light pilsner malt with some munich coming through in the form of some breadiness, light caramel comes through as well. hints of of feint clean hop bitterness.  taste is great, easily one of the tastiest, easily drinkable beers out there while not losing any ounce of complexity. it comes through inititially as light toasted pilsner, some munich breadiness and then hints of caramelization. crisp hop flavors balance the sweetness.

Lacing retention is also pretty god as well  Smell - Caramel, Toffee, Butterscotch, Sweet Malts and some slight hops. It's smells fairly sweet & absolutely wonderful!  Taste - Caramel & Butterscotch with some barley & very yeasty notes. Kind of reminds me of a Wee Heavy Ale. Flavor is not quite as sweet as the scent, however it is still excellent!  Mouthfeel - It's a little bit on the thicker side and it's quite smooth and creamy thanks to the thickness and subdued carbonation, which in turn makes it easy to drink!

Leaves almost no lacing.  S: The nose is light and slightly citrusy. A touch of malt comes out after a swirl. Not a lot here but what it does provide smells very appealing.  Taste: Similar to nose but better. Light citrus up front followed by a hit of hops and then a good malty character. The hop bitterness lasts a long time, this beer lingers for almost a minute on your palate before fading. And a warming at the end that hits you in the throat and gut rather than the mouth so you don't have that solventy ethanol taste. Really good beer.  M: This is where Dead Guy shines brightest. Drinking it cold so it hits the mouth and feels almost thin but as soon as it passes onto the middle of the tongue you feel it. Kinda chewy and really smooth. Goes down great.  O: Wonderful beer, but I should have known that. All my friends who have similar taste to me love it and all the ones with polar opposite taste hate it.

132,355,rickyleepotts,3,"I know I have had this beer before. I just don’t remember anything about it. I do know that everything I have had from Rogue has been good. As the “what they said” says, they do the opposite of what everyone else is doing. It works. They just make a good beer. Let’s get to it.  Oh, and the label is supposed to be glow-in-the-dark. It’s not. Not this bottle anyway. Oh well.  In the Glass: This beer has a really deep orange color to it. It also is pretty cloudy. It almost looks like there is yeast floating around the beer. There might be. I don’t know. But it looks delicious in the glass.  Nose: Whoa, what a nose. What is that? I have no idea but it smells incredible. I want to say it smells like an orange, but the sweetness is what is causing that. It has some spice in there too, and while this beer has a very low ABV it might just have some heat on it. Let’s see.  Flavor: The beer smells better than it tastes. I hate that too. The beer does get better as it slides across your palate, but the flavor isn’t really there until the aftertaste. You get some of those spices kicking in after you swallow, but the smell demands a better tasting beer. That’s just too bad.  Mouthfeel: There are a lot of bubbles up front. We are drinking this right out of the fridge, so maybe it tastes better as it heats up. But man. I wanted this beer to be more than it is. Thinking back to the sweetness on the nose, it hits you for a second on the back middle of the tongue. But that’s it. The aftertaste starts sweet, but is quickly taken over by the spice.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is solid. The nose is amazing, the flavor pretty much stinks, and the aftertaste is at least worth talking about. I keep going back to those spices, but man. There is a ton of spice in the aftertaste. I am thinking cinnamon, and while that’s not it… it is what it reminds me of. Burnt caramel. Maybe that’s it. Anyway, the aftertaste is solid.  This beer is good, and it comes from a VERY popular brewery out west. I have enjoyed almost every Rogue beer I have had. I just hate that this seems sort of bottom of the barrel. No pun intended.  Dead Guy Ale - The bottle says: Nothing. The bottle doesn’t say anything at all.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S - really subtle, notes of caramel, honey, and some kind of fruity sweetness I couldn't quite put my finger on.  T - just like the nose, only bigger. Caramel and malt were pretty big. Started off with a nice touch of sweetness, but the finish had a nice bitter taste. A hint of spice was also detectable and was a nice effect  M - Very smooth and velvety.

132,355,AllenJasper,3.94,"22 oz bottle to massive goblet. By chance, I was eating some Norwegian salmon at Stella's in Minneapolis, this beer went quite well with it, like the right side of this page suggests.  A:Hazy orange with hardly any head. not very pretty.  S: smells of pumpkin, caramel, toasty malts, and some lemon.  T: Much like the smell, it is a slightly spicy beer. Lots going on, but it all comes together quite well.  O: This is a great beer, I have not had anything like it before, and that is commendable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jtnelson40,3.89,"Drank straight from the bottle  A- Unknown, drank it from the bottle S- Fruity, floral, sweet....nice smell. T- Sweet, but not over powerring, citrusy, very pleasant.

Unique taste compared to any beer or ale I have ever drank, will definitely have it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,GeorgiaBrewed,3.9,"Poured out of a 12oz. bottle into my Lazy Magnolia pint glass  A: This beer has a nice, clear copper color and a decent head that's about two fingers thick. A little bit of lacing is left, but not much.  S: Smells of caramel with a hint of hops.  T: A very unique taste. Sweet, but with a nice crisp finish.  M: Light/medium body. It's not overly syrupy, so it's very easy to drink.  O: A very solid beer. It's not my favorite. The sweetness really took my by surprise on my first sip, but I was able to really enjoy it once I got past the initial shock. It's just a nice beer to drink on a warm day.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Murrhey,3.4,"Had on-tap at The Yardhouse in Costa Mesa, CA. Reviewed from notes.  A- Finger and a half off-white head. Longish retention with a light, coppery color. Some bubbly lacing.  S- Very subtle scent. Some pineyness and medium barleys but I can barely detect it.  T- Bitter and spicy. Quite an unusual flavor.  M- Lighter bodied, fairly dry and smooth.  O- This beer is nostalgic for me so maybe the score got bumped up a little. But tasty and unique flavor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,shand,3.81,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint.  I haven't had this one since the very beginning of my craft beer journey, lets see how it holds up. It is a rather attractive beer, with a hazy red-orange body and a nice head. The aroma is sweet malts. The taste consists of sweet malts and honey primarily, with a touch of graininess behind it. There's a bit of a fruit aspect with just a touch of hops as well. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coating, and the drinkability is alright. Overall, it's a decent beer, but nothing special. A good gateway beer for sure, it was for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Pours into Great Lakes pint glass an orange, honey like color with about a quarter inch of head. Sweet malty smell with a nice bit of hops in the mix to be sure. Taste/Mouthfeel velvety warm mouthfeel with a nice mix of malt and crisp hop that's upfront and warms with a clean finish. Not sure if I could have more than 2 or 3 in an evening, but very solid and a well done maibock. I actually preferred on tap to the 12oz bottle, the bottle had a bit more bite where the tap was a little more balanced which had me finishing and ordering another in no time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TheSixthRing,4.34,"Appearance - Pours a slightly opaque golden hue, nice head which dissipates in fair time. Nice lace.  Smell - Caramel. Floral hops. A hint of spice.  Taste - Deep, beautiful caramel, with a subtle toffee undertone. Honey sweetness mid-taste, along with a moderate floral and spicy hop punch. Lingering caramel and distant hop spice in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body with fairly lively carbonation. Super smooth and utterly chuggable with a clean, crisp finish.  Overall - Maybe I'm a bit biased when it comes to Dead Guy, and if so, it's only because this is the beer that got me into liking beer again, and started me onto the journey I find myself on today. A good 4-5 times a year I find myself saying ""You know what? Tonight's a Dead Guy night"", and it's never done me wrong.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,weerezboy,4.5,appearance: Poured a dark golden color from 12 oz bottle. nice carbonation and nice head that leaves lacing behind with each sip.  smell: Light floral fragrance and a nice amount of fruity esters and light yeast. Also has a toasty malt along with it.  taste: Strong caramel malt and fragrant fruit and hop flavors. This is one of the best balance of flavors a beer could have.  mouthfeel: light to medium on the tongue with an acidic wetness that leaves you refreshed.  overall: One of my favorite Oregon beers. and my favorite Maibock that I have tried. Glad that the guys at Rogue make great beers like this again and again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,rdilauro,3.85,"Ppurs a golden to amber color with a small but dense head. My first impression was the aroma of lots of malt along with some tropical fruit, to me pineapple and papaya. Hops were present, not overwhelming, just enough to balance the amount of malt. The taste was big and full, long lasting... The aftertaste stayed for a long time which made me very happy. I guess if anything that prevented me from rating this higher was that there was absence of crispness or a distinct character. It all seemed to blend and mold together. Still a nice ale",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,h20mbh,3.9,"appearance really good looking beer. bright copper in color. nice head and medium carbonation.  smell smells of fruit, not sure what type but certainly fruity. light hoppiness. medium malt.  taste tastes like it smells. would like to have had more hops, but decent hops non the less. smell lead me to believe there would be less hoppy taste.  mouthfeel medium thickness. nothing special but pleasing non the less.  overall heard amazing things about this beer, although i'm a little disappointed. still gave this beer a decent rating because it is good. even though it didn't live up to the spectacular recommendations i'd still whole heartedly recommend.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Ommy,4.08,"Pours a cloudy cidery color with a minimal, but white and a bit frothy head. I like the cloudy look, it looks very appetizing.  Fruits and hops come quickly on the nose, with a very slight malt background. I'm also getting memories of being in a barn filled with hay bales. A tiny bit of funkyness as well.  Wow, the fruit is very present in the taste, leaving me feeling like I just munched on some blueberries with a hint of banana. The hops are present, but very balanced with the fruityness.  The mouthfeel is fantastic, not too thin, but not thick like a stout should be.  Overall this beer surprised me a lot. I don't think I've had a beer that has really come through with the fruityness without actually adding fruits like this does. Amazing!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,donmonkey1,3.83,"Appearance: Copper color, good head and lacing, extraordinary carbonation. The carbonation was intense and exciting. This is probably the best part of the beer. It seemed a little too cloudy for a beer with no sediment in the bottom.  Smell: This is tough because the smell is weak. It's a little metallic (but it's from a bottle and I can always taste and smell metal from the cap), possibley a hint of hops, mild caramel or taffy smell, slightly nutty.  Taste: Malt liquor-like but not offensive. Bitter caramel-like.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied but closer to light. I would have liked to feel more carbonation.  This beer is light and easy to drink. Even though it would be fun and easy to drink a lot of them, there's still a unique flavor that's confusing but makes me want more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T - Very well balanced. The hops and malt are equally abundant. Did not get the sweetness right off the bat that other reviewers noticed, but it was there on a less potent level.  M - Lighter than I expected from the amount of aroma and flavor, very simple.  O - Extremely well balanced brew on all levels, i will be buying this again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RyanLigeia,3.12,"Hazy brown/caramel color that would be absolutely perfect if it had a bigger head. No distinct strong smells but what i do get is maltyness with some brown sugar and caramel. Taste is similar to smells but a more 'normal beer' taste is prominent. Mouth feel could be a little thicker but its got a good level of carbonation. Overall...not my favorite by rogue. Its definitely a ""safe"" beer for beginners because it DOES have some flavors in there but it may be a little weak for the more advanced beer connoisseur.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,FanofHefe,3.85,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass; no freshness dating. Hazy copper body with some brown tint mixed in. A nearly two-finger tan head that has decent retention and leaves spotty lacing.  The aroma is fairly light overall. Notes of sweet malt, yeast, and light fruit (apple) come through.  I actually like the flavor of this one. The malt seems roasted and that taste comes through nicely. The German hops present just enough bitterness to balance the sweetness.  Light to medium texture in the mouthfeel and very drinkable. Solid brew for sure; will definitely have this again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jeffmart22,3.81,"A - Pours a clear copper color with a two finger head that lingers for a while. Really great lacing on the glass. A great looking breer.  A - Fruity and candy like smell. The hops seem to have a sweet citrus or tropical fruit aroma. With some added sweetness from the malts it makes this beer seem very sweet in the aroma.  T - Stars with a nice fruity and malty sweetness. As the beer moves to the back of your tongue the flavor picks up a slight bitterness. Easy to drunk and refreshing.  M - Light to medium in body. Flavor duration is moderate.  O - Really nice, and refreshing beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell - Some malty/bready aroma first meets the nose. Caramel sweetness then comes on with the slightest bit of orange citrus coming through.  Taste - It matches the smell, but takes it up a notch from what would be expected. A nice malty flavor first hits your flavor. Sorta bready. Then comes a bit of sweetness of caramel, which is followed by some citrus hoppiness. Nice transitions.  Mouthfeel - A good level of carbonation with a medium and smooth body.  Overall - A good beer. Balances flavor, mouthfeel and smell nicely.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MightyMonk,4.2,"This ale pours clear amber gold with a nice 2 to 3 finger white head. Has a very nice fruit, malt sweet aroma. It is sweet but well balanced with good hoppiness for balance.

Lots of sweet scents, not getting a lot of hops.  Kind of thin body up front but it thickens quickly. Lots of sweet caramel up front. Tastes almost candy like. Buttered toast like flavor somewhere in the middle with a very mild hop presence. Not all I expected it to be.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Flavors are all held together though and play off eachother well enough.  Would be good as a bock but I dont really get the hop balance that's supposed to be there. Sweetness lingers a bit. I could see it being appealing to some, but its not for me.  I really think what throws me off is that this is a lighter colored bock, but I think it's still supposed to have more hops than this (or maybe its not) Some balance but I thought there'd be more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TheDeuce,4.02,"Rogue Dead Guy Ale…in a bottle  Appearance-amber copper color with a decent head of about two fingers, the head rises and falls settles with a large crackling bubbly of lace.  Smell-pungent with a very notable mix of spiced hop and breaded sweet malt, the two smells mix well and the aroma is pleasant.  Taste/Mouthfeel-medium mouthfeel, a hint of hops upfront but the sweetness of the sugar and breaded malt dominates upfront, mix of toffee and candied sugar notes. As it progresses the hops come back into play, the finish is smooth but retains a lot of flavor, last notes were sugar and hops on the tongue. More sips bring up some slight fruit notes and alcohol but the dominant characteristics remain. Pretty tasty.  Overall-nice beer, deserving of its reputation. Worth a try, hopefully you won’t get gouged like I did in trying to procure it. Recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WoodBrew,3.35,"Trying the Dead Guy Ale for the first time in quite a few years. I do remember it being better. The beer poured a cloudy orange with thin head that is not lacing. The smell has malt and balancing hops...slightly sweet. The hops provide an initial punch of bitterness in the taste, but then the sweet malt helps to calm the pallet. ABV is present in the first few swigs and then settles as the pallet adjusts. The mouthfeel is a light to medium body with good carbonaiton. Overall it is a solid ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,mjpolzin,3.5,"This beer was just okay. I got it as a Christmas gift and was excited to see it was a Maibock as I like that style and usually don't buy that style until the spring. Although I didn't like it as much as say; Maibock by Capital Brewery, I think this is a perfect session beer. It had a decent, smooth, malty taste so it would be ideal to down 3-4 of them in a row. It had a nice copper color and there was a little bit more of a bitter hoppy taste than most maibocks. So I did like it, the beer just didn't wow me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,magictacosinus,4.08,"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours an amber-brownish color that's far clearer than other ales I've had this dark. Good amount of carbonation, and bursts with a two-finger thick head that completely recedes in several minutes. Looks pretty good.  Aroma is pretty malty and roasted, yet not without its occasional hoppiness. Smells a lot like fresh, German dark bread, but there are slight floral and citrus spices thrown in that really provide balance and curious zestiness. There's also a slight yeasty backdrop that makes it smell even fresher.  Taste is far maltier than it smells, yet still manages to bring in a lot of lovely hops to spice and zest things up. The beer starts with a woody, roasted malt flavor and ends with bitterness and fruitness all around. In a sense, two of the most predominant flavors I'm getting are of walnuts and dried oranges. Really haven't had an ale with flavors such as these! Not as thick as one would assume, but the watery end of the beer makes it so that it's pretty refreshing and not too difficult to drink.  Not experienced at all with maibock-style beers, but I really like this one! A little too malty and filtered for my personal liking, but I'll gladly take one of these any day when offered. Seems to work well for any season of the year!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jkrich,4.2,"Poured from an undated 12 oz. bottle: clear, bright copper like a new penny with a half-inch, off-white head.  Quite aromatic with a soft, malty and fruity aroma, as well as a faint, oaky and vanilla aroma.  This one is quite refreshing and smooth with an emphasis on malt with a rounded fruity aftertaste. The use of an ale yeast makes this traditional lager style very unique. Some of that vanilla aroma is also evident in the flavor. There is an inviting hop bitterness on the back of the tongue.  This is a light to medium bodied offering with restrained, yet zesty carbonation. The mouthfeel is well-rounded with a mellow, malty flavor lingering on the palate.  Another solid offering from Rogue, maybe the best I have tried. This is an immensely drinkable bock that hides the ABV well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jerermy,4.2,"Pours a deep amber almost rust color, nice head that left behind some thin lacing.  The aroma is sweet with citrus and a light hop scent.  Taste is where I am most impressed.

It isn't the best in the world, its just damn good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RandyKemka,4.05,"I have to say, I have had this beer many times both on tap and from the bottle. It is a very good brew. I have read all of the reviews and have racked my mind, because I couldn't quite agree with the citrus, carmel, Appel and floral reviews. They all are close, but to me the taste is plum or date/fig like. It has other notes, but the plum/date/fig really stands out to me. More so out of the bottle than tap. This is a great beer regardless of what taste you can put your finger on.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,phenomenologian,4.45,"I opened this up and poured it into a good beer glass. It gives a two finger head that is whitish and yellowish together. the head looks almost creamy. The head retains and laces which is something I look for in the head. The body is orangish red that has nice color; you can see through and can see bubbles rise to the top.  It smells like hops and citrusy. It has floral tones to it that are pleasing to the nose.  It tastes like hops and citrus with floral tones. Someone on here said they tasted and smelled apple, but for me that does not come through. I smell citrus hops and floral.  The mouthfeel is good with as much carbonation as is necessary. It is not too carbonated but just enough that it goes with the taste of the beer.  Overall its a very enjoyable beer. It has some tones and tastes and smells to it that I don't normally encounter in beers. It is a new thing that I enjoy. I will probably buy this again.  *Note: At the end of the bottle, it is no longer see through and you cannot see through it. Its just an orange color and is very cloudy at the end. It tastes a bit more hoppy as well. I just finished it and thought I'd note this, as at the beginning it was a different appearance.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The texture of the beer is nice when cold but it gets too hot as it warms. There is too much sugars here for me. Or something like that.  I tried to enjoy this beer but I really cain't. I paid $13 for a sixxer. That is too much for me. Even if it is free range coastal water.  This beer trys to hard to be something. And it doesn't even know what it's trying to do. This beer is like a college dropout trying to make everybody thank they is smart.  Smells wonderful and is looks gorgeous...just all mixed up inside...maybe that's why the guy died...I dunno...  I had this in 2002 and said I would never buy it again but since I have had some really really good Rogue beers lately I thought I would see if somehow my tastes had matured.

132,355,brewsclues,4.2,"A - Pours a nice golden-brown amber color, hazy, with great head retention.  S - Plenty of sweet caramel and molasses, with a bit of honey. You can definitely pick up the roasted malt backbone to this beer. Outstanding and complex aromas - what a bock should be.  T - Sweet malts, bread, honey. A nice, balanced dry finish with just a touch of bitterness at the end to cut the sweetness. This is a pleasant and balanced bock - not as easy to find as you'd imagine. Immensely drinkable.  M - A good amount of carbonation. It's not too sticky, which is a pleasant surprise.  O - A really drinkable and balanced bock. Not extreme, but immensely flavorful. Goes down really easy. Bocks are not always my ""go-to"" style, but this is really worth a try if you're looking for that taste. As a hop head, I wonder what this would be like if they added a touch more hops - but, who am I to argue against big, bold, balanced flavors that go down this well?

132,355,TheRougeBastard,4.46,"After giving this a ""numbers"" only review in 2011, I revisited this tonight and was reminded just how truly good this brew is! Not too hoppy, not too malty, everything in perfect proportion! If you're in the mood for a hop-bomb, this isn't it, if your in the mood for an all-around brew to enjoy watching a game, entertaining friends, or you're just looking for a good tasting, easy drinking beer, this is your guy...pun intended!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,InsolublePancake,3.67,"This so happens to be the first craft beer I ever had. Not the exact one, of course. I mean, I didn't drink half of it and save the rest to try six years later, although I suppose that would have been an interesting, if highly oxidized, experiment. No, what I mean is that my first ever craft beer was a Dead Guy, bought as part of a mixed six the day after I turned 21. I had not revisited it until my 27th birthday, when a shiny new six pack was gifted me by my sister. To be honest I didn't care for it the first time I tried it (I thought it was too bitter, ha ha) and it isn't something I would have picked up for myself, but since it was given to me and it is somewhat of a craft beer living legend, I figured, why not? I can only hope the review is half as boring and rambling as this introduction.  A- Fairly standard dark amber with a thin head that quickly dissipates into a thinner lace.  S- Has that nice, characteristic bock sweetness that's reminiscent of homemade bread and caramel. Perhaps leans a little too far on the sweet side without any hint of hops to balance it out. About what you'd expect from your typical maibock.  T- Quite dry, actually, which is kind of a nice surprise given that the smell indicated it might be a touch cloying. Crackerlike malt is the dominant flavor with a good dose of grassy hops (I can actually see why I might have found this too bitter when I first tried it) and just a touch of lightly fruity, alcohol sweetness. Clean finish with a moderate bitterness. Pac-Man (the game) &gt; Pacman yeast &gt; Pacman Jones. Just throwing that out there.  M- Medium body, slightly slick, fairly low (but adequate) carbonation.  Actually a little better than I expected. I was kind of expecting a malty, unbalanced mess, but it was nicely balanced and quite drinkable. A pleasant surprise. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to buy it (especially given Rogue's outrageous prices) but it's not bad at all. Recommended for a decent everyday beer if the price is right.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste: Flavorful but not overpowering hops up front with toasty, buiscut and bready/grainy malts in the finish. Nice aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light/ medium body with excessive carbonation that somewhat hinders the flavor.  Overall: This beer is the epitome of balance and has one of the best flavor profiles i can think of. It's delicious. the only issue I have with it is the excessive carbonation, but that can be made up for with a hard pour. Delicious.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Very complex aromas. Taste is great. All of the scents are realized, with cocoa, spice and roasted malt coming forward. Rinses down with a hops bite and perfect carbonation. Finishes silky smooth.

132,355,y2jrock60,3.5,"I don't know if this review is fair since I didn't know this beer was a Maibock. I thought it was going to be an American Pale Ale, so I was definitely disappointed when I took my first sip.  A- Almost pure orange with a bubbly/creamy head that laces well.  S- Alcohol and sweetness with almost no hop aroma.  T- Sweet and alcoholic with a slight dry hop bitterness that fades into more alcohol.  M- Medium-Heavy bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  D- Not very drinkable, I could barely finish one.  Again, I don't know if this review is fair. I was expecting an APA. I thought this beer tasted almost like pure alcohol. There was a little sweetness and dry hopiness to the flavor, but the alcohol definitely overpowered it. If that's how a Maibock is, than I'm sure it's a good one. However, I didn't care for this beer. I'm going to definitely shy away from Maibocks in the future.  I do like dupplebocks like Troegenattor though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,TheAlamoWrocker,3.91,"650 mL bottled poured into a Tulip.  A: Pours a beautiful Mahogany. The head that was poured is practically nonexistent. Even though the head wasn't much of this beer it definitely laces proudly and strong. With the second pour into my Tulip this brew shows some more of its character. The head was much stronger, 1/2 fingered head.  S: I pondered the dominant smell of this for quite a bit. I kept on going back and forth between honey and molasses. I was close, but what it smells most like is Blackstrap molasses.  T: This definitely carries a nice malty sweetness to it. The flavor of this practically pops towards the end of the swallow. Right before the bitterness kicks in at the end a biscuit-like taste comes in. The aftertaste is definitely a delight it comes in sweet and bitter at the same time. I would even say a smoke-like quality emerges from here as well. As this warms up it feels as if the malts take control.  M: This drink is smooth, moderately carbonated, and also holds a moderate body. This drink feels dry, but it is drinkable especially if you enjoy the smell of Blackstrap molasses.  O: After checking some other reviews on here I think I may have gotten a passed due date bottle or maybe even an infected bottle. Even though this may be possible I still enjoyed this brew. I've had other brews by Rogue, but this is my first ever Maibock. This was an experience and I recommend that everyone should at least try this brew at least once.

132,355,bobhits,3.87,"Pale yellow orange colored body. Low carbonation (perhaps a more aggressive pour was called for) and a head that is gone in about the time it takes to write this. I recall a bit more from past experiences but this is what I have to go with.  This is one sweet beer. It has a caramel like sugary sweetness to it, and then it turns into an almost apple and strawberry fruit note. The sweet smell malt is driving this one.  This one at the first taste has the sweetness that a good October fest has. The beer then goes back and brings out fruity flavors though I don't think these are hop driven like they are in so many other beers. There's a bit of toasted flavor.  Very light and drinkable.  I'm not sure what rogue wanted out of this beer. It is an amazingly complex malt forward beer without the weight and power that so many have. It is also worth pointing out that Rogue only mildly over charges for this one (I guess on Dead Guy they have an excuse to not post the bottled on date?) and it is easily accessible so any craft lover should give it a shot.

The beer tastes as good as it smells, with malts and oats coming out. A subtle sweet honey glaze follows, followed again by some nice toffee. The finish has a slight hop tang.

Cloudy, dark amber pour with a decent head that dissipated fairly quickly.Spotty lacing throughout the drink. A nice looking brew.  Not getting much here...almost a musty, sweet malt, maybe some grassy hops, but pretty buried.  Hmm...interesting taste. The sweet, bready malt jumps forward...almost like a honey graham cracker...maybe even cinammon. Bitter, grassy hops compliment the malt very well. This one is unique to say the least. I like it.  Pretty sharp carbonation adds a bit of a bite to the mouthfeel, would want this to be a bit smoother. Fairly dry too. Overall though, I'd say this is a good effort based on the taste.

132,355,Pintofbrown,3.46,"App-A copper and light brown body that is sort of see through. It has a nice half finger of creamy white head, a very attractive looking Helles.  Smell- You can pick out grassy hops and some sweet malt as well.  Taste- There is a lot of hop bitterness all the way through the drink, but it is more subdued than an IPA. The hops are more grassy and earthy in nature, which helps differentiate the amount of bitterness that the drinker is dealing with. As the swallow hits about mid drink, there is just a hint of a sweet biscuit malt which helps level this Dead Guy out. Really, one would be inclined to call it average, but the flavor profiles are so clean and well put together it becomes better than the sum of its’ parts.  Mouth feel- This beer is medium bodied and quite smooth. The small amount of carbonation keeps things interesting.  Overall- This Helles is delicate and just barely above being too bland.

132,355,JerzDevl2000,4.1,"Picked this up in Totowa because I've never had this before. How did it get to be after all these years? I have no idea...  Sure enough, this had the pour that I expected from a beer with this amount of hype - nice bright almond hue, nearly clear, with a head that lasted a while for not being that overpowering in size.There wasn't a lot of lacing to be seen but the aroma more than made up for it. Grass, grapefruit, and honey all combined for a pleasant smell and when combined with the slight sweet body of this beer, led to a pleasant taste and a relatively easy drinkability. The hoppier aspects come out in the aftertaste with more grapefruit and tropical fruit emerging but there isn't any long-lasting ""burn"" to be seen here.  The alcohol is a tad high here but that wouldn't stop anyone from downing a few of these in a session. This doesn't seem like a Maibock or Helles Bock to me because of the hue and bitterness of this beer but regardless of the stylistic semantics, this is quite enjoyable and would be a decent go-to beer if it was more available and cheaper.

Light bubble streams glide upwards where they meet a quarter inch white foamy head that rests at the top of the glass. There wasn't much retention, but it did leave some spotted lacing.  S: The aroma starts off with a perfect balance of malts and hops. There are some significant sweet aromas present including a honey graham-cracker-like sweetness accompanied by sweet caramel candies. Refreshing tropical fruits make their way through as well, (starfruit maybe?).  T: Heavy caramel malts take the front seat in this one. They are pleasantly accompanied by the same tropical fruitiness and earthy yeast tastes. A light hoppy citrus taste leaves a slightly bitter finish.  M: This is a medium bodied drink with a somewhat chewy feel to it. There is an appropriate amount of carbonation that aids it in wandering around the palate. It is somewhat dry, yet very drinkable.  O: This has been one of my favorite beers for a while and probably one of the originals that introduced me to craft brews.

The aroma is a complex but somewhat dull combination of light citrusy hops, earthy yeast, and a lager-like clean caramel sweetness. The flavor is much more hop-forward, with an assertive yet rounded combination of citrus and pine. A semi-dry, biscuity sweet malt provides some balance, along with a musty yeasty character. The texture is mouth-filling, but there is only a moderate lingering resinous feel, and the finish is actually a bit drying.

Smell: There is a nice balance of malt and hops on the nose. There are some citrus notes as well as a sweet fruit smell.  Taste: There is a nice malty presence in the taste that is well balanced by the hops.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a crisp, clean, dry finish.

T: Sweet malts (caramel, honey) and hops in the background, but pretty well balanced.  M: On the lighter side of medium, very drinkable.  O: Really enjoyed the balance on this one.

132,355,socon67,3.67,"Had on tap at High Rollers in Foxwoods Casino  A - Amber pour, with a thin head that settles fast. Noticeable carbonation.  S - Malty smell with caramel, and a faint smell of wood.  T - Some malty flavor, sweetness of caramel, and a small amount of butterscotch. But the flavors are extremely faint.  M - Rasonable carbonation, smooth bodies, and light feel.  O - I've tries dead Guy many times over the years. He's more of a nostalgia beer that is nice but not noteworthy. Very good with food.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerImmediately,3.4,"Can't believe I've never reviewed the Dead Guy...  Pours w/short bubbly head that fades uber quickly to nothing. No lacing. Very murky, orange to brown body. Seems dark for the style.  Aromas are strong and malty... smells more like a pumpkin ale than a maibock. The yeast comes through strong, imparting a lot of rich, sweet bread. Plenty of vegetal aromas as well.  Full bodied, full flavored, and fairly creamy on the palate. Flavors include some orange peel bitterness in the finish, but mostly a rich and vegetal (pumpkin meat) quality. Fair amount of butterscotch-like sweetness. Touch of sweet spice, too. Could use a bit more carbonation, but a pretty good mouthfeel for a maibock.  A rich and tasty beer overall, but not one of the better examples of the style, IMO.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,bramsdell,4,"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass.  A: Pours a nearly translucent amber with a white head. Maybe a finger to finger and a half. The head recedes, but throughout the pint, there was some decent lacing.  S: All malt at first, backed up by the hops. Personally, this is how I like my beer. I like a nice malty beer with a hop flavor to boot. This delivers. The first time I had this brew, I drank it out of the bottle at a party, and the hops were seriously dominant. However, out of a glass, everything mellows out and the balance is struck perfectly. If anything, this brew is maltier than it is hoppy, which is great in my opinion.  T: Again, malt forward with the hops to back. Honestly, the taste of this beer is the exact extension of its aroma. It's malt with some hops, then the perfect balance is struck in the end. A beautiful, but subtle, aftertaste is left on the tongue.  M: Not a ton of carbonation. In line with the malty taste and smell, the feel is thick and full. The hops are definitely apparent, but it is the balance of the two that leaves my tongue so happy.  O: A very fine beer. Something that I could drink on a regular basis (if I had that kind of cash in AL), but also of a high enough quality to actually warrant a review.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,BeerPhan86,4.15,"Poured into a standard 16 oz. pint glass, which seems to be the right vessel given that the Dead Guy pint glass is the same.  A - Pours a hazy orange amber (think apple cider) with just about a half finger of light tan head. Very sticky lacing on this one but the head doesn't linger very long.  S - Sweet and malty with light notes of apricot and even ginger. Bready and citrusy for the most part.  T - Initially sweet with lots of apricot and tangerine. There is a mild hop profile in the middle that consists of grassy, earthy hops and citrus hops, but not too overpowering. Finishes dry with nutty flavors and hints of honey and ginger. Such a unique tasting brew that is well balanced and genuinely interesting, I have never had anything else quite like it.  M - Chewy and slightly sticky. The carbonation could be kicked up a bit but overall it goes down super smooth.  O - A very distinct and interesting brew that truly has its own character. Slightly sweet and slightly hoppy, there are flavors here for everyone. Well worth a try but it can get expensive (I see it go anywhere from $12-16 a six pack in the northeast). I did not enjoy the Double Dead Guy in the bottle or on tap however, it was just far too sweet and boozy.

Provides a very satisfying belch.  O: a standard go-to ale, very reliable and it hits the spot.

Typical nut-like malt and some light wheat with a little orange hop zest.  M: Medium body with good carbonation. Not much on taste left on the palate.  O: A very solid beer.

132,355,JohnnyBarman,4.23,"Single bottle from Kickoff in Waterloo. It's been sparingly available at the LCBO, but I just haven't got round.  Poured into a Moretti deep sniffer. A hazy amber-copper brew, leaves a nice sturdy halfinch of head, nice sheeted lacing. Good looking brew.  Nose is malty, grainy, that distinct pacman yeast, fleshy peach and a touch of hops.  A malty little brew, with a nice bitterness to the finish. Not sure stylistically where to place this brew, but I'm enjoying what Rogue has put together. A touch of wild grain, fruit and a mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied, chewy, silty and well carbonated.  A brew worth savoring, Dead Guy has a lot going on. Not really sure where it sits in the beer spectrum, but I like when brews refuse to be definable. Expensive, but worth a go!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Smakawhat,4,"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner style glass.  A brown clear and crystal amber forms off the pour, with fast rising cola like bubbles from the bottom. Head is foamy with solid retention and staying power. Clumpy lacing looks very solid..  Bouquet is a soft sweet malt, and hint of dark chewy bread. Quite nice and inviting.  Taste is predominantly lager like crisp, with a sharp hop sting that is not jarring. Quite bitter aftertaste, but pleasurable. Sort of a mix between a good light malty doppelbock and a dry pilsner. A very dry graininess leaves me thrsty for more.  Overall I'am impressed by this one quite enjoyable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Crossmd,4.04,"Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Probably 40 degrees fahrenheit.  Pours a vortex of amber and copper, with a half finger of a dark creme colored head settling into a cap. Laces with a shimmering stickiness that runs down, rimming the edge the glass. Probably the most beautiful beer I've seen.  Smells of a sticky malty sweetness, some breads and maybe coffee? Rich, but not really well projected.  Tastes much like it smells, with hops buried in the middle of the palate that were undetectable in the nose, Rich, on the verge of heavy, but not demanding. Finishes well, drying down into the slight bitterness found from the hops.  Mouthfeel is a rich chewiness off-set by the slightest carbonated lift on the dry-down. Stimulates the saliva glands considerably.  This reminds me immediately of Left Hand's Sawtooth Ale. Not as herbal maybe, but definitely with the same chewy mouthfeel and density, even color. I'm not really sure into what style this falls, but I appreciate it - especially on those rare occasions that I could see this hitting the spot (autumn maybe?).  89.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Looks pretty good. Nose is mostly malty up front but has a nice floral hops balance. I get cajeta, a slight hops bitterness and a touch of honey. The taste is very earthy and floral. Still getting some honey. Bitter hops shine through in the middle and the taste ends with a light coffee,caramel flavor. The mouth feel is soft, medium in body and the carbonation is on the high side. All in all not bad. This is one of the beers that kick off my love for craft beer.

132,355,huhl23,3.68,"I have to admit I'm a bit confused by the style. Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops as much as the next guy (and maybe even more than some), but I didn't think they really fit here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Groomsy,3.97,"12 oz. bottle bought as a single for $2.29. Poured into a pilsner glass.  Appearance: Deep honey-colored amber body, very cloudy. Topped by a pillowy two-finger ivory head, slowly dwindling to a full cap of foam, that leaves behind fading rings of lacing on the glass. Some lively carbonation is visible through the body, even through the cloudy body.  Aroma: Very nice. Definitely some caramel/toffee notes from the malt, but adequately balanced by crisp and spicy hops - also picking up some dark fruit and ever-so-slight pine resin. A well-balanced beer in the nose, hoping it follows through in the flavor.  Taste: Oh yeah. Tasty and refreshing. I'm hit with a burst of some toasted malt/grain on the front of the palate as well as caramel, followed by some crisp and lively spicy/floral hop flavors. The finish has a lot going on: Some pine bitterness is there, but rounds out with biscuit flavors, and it finishes very clean. A well-balanced brew, very drinkable and enjoyable. Nice mix of flavors.  Mouthfeel: Very full, but medium-bodied. Refreshing and not heavy at all. Crisp and dry finish when some lingering grassy bitterness. Well-carbonated body.  Overall: Wasn't sure to expect here, but this is a very satisfying and drinkable brew. Not sure if I would shell out for a six pack, but I enjoyed this for what it was. Worth a try at least once for everyone.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kflorence,4.02,"A: Pours a translucent amber in color with tints of orange and honey. A fair amount of white, frothy foam sits atop for quite some time and leaves lacing around the glass as you drink. Carbonation levels look to be perfect. Really like the color of this one, especially when held up to the light.  S: Smells very predominantly of sweet malts (think: brown sugar, caramel and candi sugar) and also a bit of fruit... apricot and grape, mostly. Slightly floral, but rather subtle. There might be some nuttiness in there, too. An enjoyable aroma, to be sure.  T: Very balanced malt and hop presence. The malts strike first with a sweet, toasted, nutty flavor and a bit of molasses. The hops come in the mix shortly thereafter with a bitter, citrus twang, along with a bit of apricot and grape, as in the nose. Finishes crisp, dry and bitter, with a lingering combination of sweet, toasty malts and bitter, citrus hops on the tongue.  M: This is medium bodied with ample carbonation and a good amount of chewiness for the style. Feels great on the tongue, goes down smooth and easy and is highly drinkable.  O: All of the Rogue ales seem to share a similar malt profile and I must admit that it's one of my favorites. This brew is truly a classic and, as others have mentioned, for a Maibock to be a brewery's flagship ale is pretty impressive. This one in particular packs a good malt/hop balance and comes off quite quaffable. This is definitely a ""mood"" beer, and when I'm in the mood for the style, this one always comes through.

132,355,BarryMFBurton,3.53,"There’s a lot of controversy surrounding Rogue. Are they a good company? Do they take advantage of people? Are the owners honest? Is their product competitively priced, or are they “signaling” to make their beers seem better than they are? I have never seen a craft brewery that has been bombarded with so many criticisms. To be honest, the Rogue beers I’ve had have been pretty good so far, so I don’t really want to get tangled up in the rumor mill. If the beer is good enough to be worth the money you pay, say no more. I love craft beer because of the community it creates, and for all of the brewery success stories that show how far drive and innovation can get you. If I wanted to discuss politics, I wouldn’t be spending so much time on BeerAdvocate! That’s my take, at least.  So here’s to good beer; may taste never be overlooked for reasons of business or politics.  A: This one pours nice and rich. The head looks like a wonderful, off-white dollop of cream, and the lacing it leaves is just excellent. There’s not an enormous amount of shine in the light golden-orange body, as a slight haze comes across it. Pretty nice after the first pour, but the bad thing is that there’s not a lot of residual bubbling going on in the glass. This causes the head to minimize to just a few spots of white on top of the body. Good character overall, though.  S: Mild and pleasant here. Fruits are first and foremost, with fresh peach and sugary blackberry jam notes that hover constantly throughout. Some other malts beneath present a thin, wheaty undertone to the rest of the scents, although it sometimes gives off an artificial smell of cheap malts. It’s finished out by some syrupy toffee and molasses notes, enhancing this nose’s one word description of “sweet.”  T: Fortunately for a hophead like myself, there’s a small bitter kick first off. They fade almost instantaneously, though, making way quickly for a big malty push. Amongst those flavors are caramel and a leafy earthiness, with a tiny hint of indistinguishable fruit on the end. That’s not all, though; the cheap malts show up again, but in a much bigger way. Within an instant of those tastes swelling up, the quality of the drinking experience just plummets. The “did I really pay $5.00+ for this bottle?” thoughts start to spring up, too, leading me down a slippery slope of irritation. The aftertaste doesn’t help, either, since its main component are the chemical tastes and stale mustiness of said malts. This palate screams ""not worth the money,"" and I'm not sure I'd really want to try it again.  M: Pretty good in this area, though. This is a brew that feels relatively full, even without a lot of carbonation. Not perfect, but good.  O: I can see where people are coming from when they say that Rogue isn’t worth the price they charge. I wouldn’t pay for a bottle of this stuff again, especially considering what I paid for just a small bottle. And, while I’ll keep trying their stouts and darker creations, I don’t think I’ll be working too hard to get any of their lighter stuff. It’s strange to see such a line in a brewer’s abilities, but I guess not everyone can make a mind-blowing light, lager-style ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Knapp85,3.7,"Dead Guy poured out as a light copper color. The head wasn't very impressive here and neither was the lacing. The smell of the beer has a decent amount of hop aromas that are balanced with some malts. The taste of this beer is decent. Nothing too over the top, some grainy malts and a bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth but it also felt a little watered down. Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer.

132,355,DCon,4.07,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle @ Fox n Hound Pub and Grille in Chesterfield, MO for $5. Poured from one of the coolest looking bottles into a Standard Pint Glass and had no sign of a Freshness Date on the Bottle (rarely from Rogue).

Amber color body and leaves a small amount of lace.  Flavor- Starts with good pale malts and then a touch of caramel. Not sure it is even a caramel taste but sweet. Ends with grain and a light amount of hop.  Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and Leaves Malt/Grain on the palate.  Overall Impression- This is my second time having this ale and I have to say, the second time was much better! I'm not sure if I had a bad batch/bottle or it was overdue, but man, this is fantastic!

The smell was sweet with a hint of nuts, maybe hazel nuts. A tad on the strong side registering at 6.5%.  It has a good mouthfeel, a little buttery and carmely with a very sweet finish. Also a little bit hoppy. Overall a great beer to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MattyG85,3.95,Poured from 22 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Appearance: Deep amber orange with lots of rising bubbles. Big off white three finger head with good retention and lacing.  Smell: Big aroma of sweet caramel malts with hints of orange and other citrus fruits from a light hop presence. Some biscuit as well.  Taste: Big taste of toasted caramel malts with a fair amount of apple and orange. Mild hop bitterness towards the end. Also a slight hint of honey and spice. Malts dominate the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth and creamy.  Overall: A very solid bock that packs a good malty punch.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Rschis16,4,"Copper, deep burnt orange in color with a small off white head. Biscuity aroma underneath some floral hop notes. Some intoxicating caramel notes as well to round it all out. The flavor follows the nose with a bready malt body, a touch of balancing hops that creates a well balanced and sweet malt-forward beer. There's a touch of booze in the back end but its pleasant and becomes part of the profile. The sweet mix of caramel notes and bready malts isn't cloying bc of those hop notes, which edge towards pine in flavor, but it's obvious this is just to create balance. Finishes long with a bitter kick in the end. Good beer, definitely see why it bridges the gap between preferences",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,doughanson78,3.71,"My first Maibock/Helles Bock. 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Nice slightly dark amber color. Orange tint. Fluffy one finger, off white head. Decent carbonation. Decent lacing.  S: Very light aroma. Getting a little nuttiness. Some grains or wheat. Very light caramel. Small hint of apples. Very light hop scent.  T: Caramel right at first. Honey. Little toasted malts mixed with light apples. Very light citrusy hop bitterness at the end mixed with a slight peppery flavor.  M: Medium bodied. Decent coating in the mouth. Leaves a kind of dryness in the back of your throat that feels scratchy. Not a dry finish tho.  O: Good beer. The smell could use a lot of work. And the scratchiness in my throat? Like something got stuck there. Will have to give others in this style a shot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,hopsolutely,4,"Beautiful clear amber beer with respectable head and lacing, followed by a pleasantly creamy mouthfeel.  Bready and sweet aroma, nicely caramelized.

132,355,Ardon,4.17,"Pours a cloudy amber with a thin lacy head, doesn't maintain the head very long however it is being served at a very low temperature (I don't care, I like COLD beer).  Sweet floral malt, mild burnt brown sugar mixed with charcoal aromas.  Nutty flavours, walnut, mild brown sugar, peaty, sweet. Light hops, just enough (maybe not quite enough) for balance.  Smooth, soft and medium bodied. A touch of heat lingers in the finish from the alcohol (something I notice in just about every maibock)  Overall, quite enjoyable, tasty brew. For how much I have to pay for it here in Ontario, don't know if I'd run for it. But tasty nontheless.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SebD,3.92,"Appearance: It has a nice orange/copper colour to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down quite fast and there is minimal lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of sweet malts with caramely notes and some fruity hops.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a very sweet malty taste to it with some definite caramely and bready notes. The hops give it a slight citrucy flavour and biterness but the malts definitly drown them out.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a light body.

T - Smell is repeated on the palate with more caramel and malt with just enough hops to balance it out.  M - Medium bodied, silky mouthfeel, with just enough effervescence  O - Drinkable for sure, interesting enough, but nothing really too complex. This would be flexible with a number of dishes or sessionable as the alcohol isn't too high.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rawfish,3.56,"Pours a deep copper shade with good clarity. A steady pour nets a two finger, brown egg shell colored head with average retention and tiny wisps of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is very sweet but also very light, corn syrup with cereal grains and corn husks. Small hint of pine and grassy hops.  Malty front with caramel, sweet bread, a bit cloying when it warms with more syrup and grain husk coarseness in the flavor. Ends a bit acidic on the finish with good dryness and a slightly medicinal hop flavor. Overall, lots of flavor good and malty but a bit too sweet and less refreshing than your usual bock lager.  Medium body, high in carbonation, felt more when the beer is colder. Colder temperature adds a nice crispness along with drying which is consistent throughout.  Lager clarity and finish while sustaining a good amber ale flavor throughout minus the yeasty characteristics, pretty well done and my first dive into Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Nutty aroma, bready, with roasted malts, hints of dark fruit. Caramel malts in the taste, bready, with pine hops coming through, with hints of raisin. Medium body and pretty drinkable.

Drinkability: 1 bomber was enough for me, Probably won't buy this one again, I thought it was a bit out of Balance, Not enough carbonation or malt to hold a proper head.

132,355,WhiskeyNinja,3.33,"From a 12 oz. bottle it poured a hazy copper color with a very thin off-white head. The head stayed a short time with minimal lacing.  The initial aroma was that of dirty feet and I thought to myself, ""do I really want to drink this"". Of course I do! Having several other whiffs, the maltiness clearly came through with a very small hint of citrus.  The taste was malty from start to finish with a touch of citrus/grapefruit in the middle to balance the malts out just a bit.  Mouthfeel was pleasantly light with a decent amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is there considering that in my mind, someone had stuck their toes in my beer. Overall a pretty decent beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Not much hop but you can tell it's present.  T - Burnt oranges, caramel, a little citrus hop, and some biscuits.  M - Mild carbonation and a light body. Slightly sweet finish.  O/D - I remember more hops in this but maybe I wasn't used to hops as much. Balanced but I expected more hops. Not bad though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T: incredibly delicious and surprisingly refreshing for the sweet tones and slightly higher than average abv. I drank this beer outside on a hot day and found it so refreshing that I would buy a whole case in the future. Though it is refreshing, there is no watery-ness. A good comparison might be to Magic Hat #9 in that they are both fruity, but Dead Guy has more body and the fruit is not overpowering.

A: Hazy orange in color with a finger thick, off-white head that slowly dissipates in the mug.  S: Lots of different malts present in the nose, that give off some sweetness and caramel like scents. Some sort of fruitiness as well.  T: Taste is very malty, the caramel is strong with a toasted malty flavor and some sweetness and spice. There is a quick burst of bitter hops in the middle, but the finish is malty and maybe a bit oily.  M: Medium bodied with average carbonation. The feel is malty with sweetness.

132,355,mdaschaf,3.5,"Had on tap at Timothy's. Review from notes.  A: Served in a pint glass, the beer was a hazy amber/orange with a very small tan head that reduced quickly. No lacing.  S: Heavy caramel aromas as well as some light grains. There are hints of apple floral hops, but both are pretty subdued.  T: Overly malty, I was expected at least a little bit of a hop presence, but its just not there. Heavy caramel and toffee with a slight hint of bruised apple and light spice.  M: Medium to full bodied, a much more filling beer than anticipated. Good carbonation.  O: It was ok, again a great hop presence would have made this a better beer, for me at least. Its fuller body makes it a tough one to drink a bunch of as well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jifigz,3.83,"Bottle poured into a standard Pint Glass  A: Nice copper orange color. Decent small head that lingers and leaves small amounts of lacing.  S: A very sweet floral aroma. It doesn't smell very bitter, but most definitely maintains a sweet aroma. Mildly citrus.  T: A nice unique malt and honey flavor. I think honey seems to be a main flavor here. It almost reminds me of the candy honey-o's if anyone knows what they are. The finish stays sweet. Not a very bitter beer.  M: Extremely light bodied and creamy. Just plain good.  O: A very good beer and one that I think has a pretty unusual taste character. I have not experienced this style very much, but I like this one and must try others.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste was sweet and definitely memorable (being my first bock). Will definitely try again, and again, and again. The mouthfeel was great, I want to say almost syrupy but hesitate to being that it went down so smooth. It is 6.5% abv after all so if it ain't going down smooth there's a problem. But this beer is so great. I wish it was cheaper here because I could drink this all the time. Definitely a smooth tasty beer worth the extra pennies.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Illtryit,3.97,Enjoyed at Growlers in St. Louis.  Poured from bottle to regular pint glass. Amber in color. Clear. White head about half inch tall. Some lacing as a drank.  Smells of a fruit/sweet/grainy mixture. Very unique.  Taste follows the smell. Citrus and mellowed grains up front with a hoppy bitter aftertaste.  A little thin in the mouth. Good carbonation.  Really good beer. I'll definitely have more.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,billybrew21,3.93,"Bomber poured into a flute pils glass, but really wasn't satisfied so I poured what was left into a Duvel tulip.  Pours a hazy orange, amber-ish color with a big, thick, creamy head...very attractive. Smell is a whole plethora of things: fruits, wheat and alcohol esters...I'm not getting too much hops here. Hops definitely come through on the taste though as well as more fruit, maybe banana? I'm not sure but there are some citrus notes here - a complex beer, but tasty nonetheless. The malt kicks in midway through and brings a biscuit, bread like taste that dries things out at the finish. Mouthfeel is really my only disappointment, as the beer is overall pretty watery. The body feels thin, as the carbonation is there after pouring, but quickly disappears. This beer is a great refresher, and at 6.5%, you can get the alcohol at the end, but it still feels like it could be a session beer. I could see myself definitely drinking a few of these on a hot day, but then after a few you really start to see that ABV.  Bottom line is that this is a very drinkable beer that I will certainly be coming back to as summer approaches. With a great and complex blend of flavors Rogue delivers a pleasing brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Nice carbonation to begin but mellows out pretty quickly. Head dissipates pretty quickly as well.  S- smells yeasty, banana bread, alcohol, slight sugary sweetness characters.  T- tastes a bit watery at the front, in the middle I taste kind of a sour bread like taste, with nice malty character. At the end I taste bitter, citrus, lemon, sour orange rind.  M- watery, thin, carbonated, a bit coarse.  O- A good ale with nice carbonation. Not exceptional by any standards but fairly easy to drink, refreshing, and tasty.

132,355,Roke87,3.71,"12oz bottle, slightly chilled and poured into a Duvel tulip. Production date: BO811, not sure what that means and couldn’t find anything on the Rogue website?  Appearance- Pours on the darker side but still clear amber colour with a minimal half finger of white head that very quickly resides to a bubbly ring leaving very minimal lacing.  Smell- I’m having a hard time distinguishing a smell out of this one, very sweet on the nose maybe a caramel flavour? I don’t get any hop smells from this one at all to be honest, lots of bready malts and a mild touch of yeast.  Taste- Again having a very hard time distinguishing this one in any way, the first thought that comes to my mind as far as taste is a chicken noodle soup that is loaded with lots of salted top crackers. Other than that lots and lots of bready malt flavours with a mild fruity flavour thrown in there.  Mouthfeel- Light bodied with from what I can tell below average carbonation that leaves a tiny little bit of a bubbly top. Still smooth, crisp and a very refreshing brew all in all.  Overall- Wow this is unlike anything I have ever tried before, the smells are hard to put a finger on and the taste is equally hard. Sweet on both the palate and the nose with lots of bready malts in both as well. “Dedicated to the Rogue in each of us” is a very good statement because this beer doesn’t want or try to be like any other beer out there. I’m not sure but after reading some of the other reviews maybe us Canadians get the old crappy batches because my review sounds miles off from the others? I dunno a very interesting beer from the offering I bought and I probably wouldn’t seek it out again, I’m stunned and this is the first time in my short reviewing career.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Flavor is toasted malt and caramel notes again, with a very slight peppery hops spicing peeking through, and some grapefruit/citrus ccharacteristics, as well.

T: Sweetness bursts onto the tongue in the form of sweet malt as well as apricots and plums. Some citrus enters in the middle followed by some bitterness at the end to bring some balance to the dominant sweet start. Beautifully balanced and refreshing.

132,355,getoffmylawnbro,4.43,"A - A red-orange hue pops from the overall mild color. I'm not sure if it is more red or orange, which intrigues me. It has a small head, yet has excellent lacing. Overall, an excellent appearance. It looks as good as it tastes.  S - The smell consists of malts and a combination of citrus fruits. I personally smell grapefruit and either pineapple or banana, although I think I am mistaken with the banana. It smells exactly like the spring - a playful smell that is first malt and then the citrus fruit.  T - The Dead Guy Ale is like, two beers. First is a red-ale-ish taste and then an IPA-ish taste. A quick taste of malts is replaced by the lighter taste of the fruit, just like the smell. The after taste is stronger, and slowly fades away in your mouth and feels great.  M - I would describe it first as playful, then as carbonated, and then as it rules.  O - An excellent beer with great taste, smell, and appearance. If I murdered someone, got caught, was found guilty in a court of law, sentenced to death, and was offered a last meal - I'd think about requesting this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Kadugen,5,"There's nothing I can say about this Beer that hasn't already been said in any of the other reviews. The only thing i can contribute is my personal story that goes along with this wonderful brew.  I never really had a taste for beer until college, and of course that was filled with nights of Keystone Light and Miller Light. I, in no way am slamming these beers they do serve there purpose, and I am not such a beer snob I would ever refuse any of these when given to me. What I'm trying to say is this is all I knew.  That is until I enrolled in the Cloverleaf Taverns MBA (Master of Beer Appreciation) program. 45 beers on a list, gift cards, t-shirt and name on the wall. That was good enough for me I figured I'd give it a shot. Never did I expect to gain such an appreciation and knowledge for beer as I do now.When I completed the list my palate was eager to learn more and try new and exciting beers.  Which brings me to Rouge Dead Guy. This beer will always hold a special place in my heart (and belly) as one of the first beers to show me how good consumption of liquids could be. Many nights I have spent at the Leaf with many pints of this wonderful beverage. With its warm honey glow and caramel smell. It will get you to where your want to go in less time but not get you to blitzed before you get there.  Springtime is the perfect time to enjoy this hearty, rich maibock that has a dryer, richer, more hoppy experience. Its a great transition from the heavy beers of winter to the lighter ones of summer. Hell I drink this all year round. So sit back and enjoy this wonderful brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RashyGrillCook,3.27,"Pours a semi-clear copper orange with minimal head and minimal lacing. Aromas of bitter hops, some maltiness and (oddly enough) corn flakes.

Clear, then cloudy (see above) light amber color; 1+ finger of cream head after a light pour has good retention.  Aroma is mainly citrus hops and some floral and apricot elements.  Tastes a little fruity, but with an excellent sweet/bitter balance. Somewhat weak finish and aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - rather low carbonation, but this seemed OK for the beer.

The middle is slightly hoppy and those toasted malts show their face throughout the experience.  Mouthfeel - Balanced and medium in carbonation.  Overall - I would drink this beer again.

132,355,beerinmorning,4.65,"I always take get a good nose full of each the beer before I sip and this one delivered a wonderful combination of oranges and caramel. The start is almost all hops, almost leading like an IPA, but the warm sweet and warm taste of the malt comes in to balance it all nicely.  The body looks thick, but still very well carbonated. You get that same sensation in the mouthfeel. The finish is a little oily, but it's the perfect finish to this beer.  And the orangish-amber color is truly lovely. No lacing, though, which is a bit of a surprise, because the prevalence of hops would seem to suggest more lacing.  In all, this is one complex and delicious beer.

132,355,Dan3279,3.97,"When I first started getting into craft beer with my Dad about seven years ago this was one of the beers that really opened my eyes to a new world of beer. It was a standard go to beer but I have not had it in a while and I picked up a bottle today because I really missed it. Now I have to say that it has been at least a year a since I have had this beer and my tastes have changed a lot in the past year. At the same time I wish these bottles had expiration dates because I think I got an older bottle.  A: Cloudy copper body with a white head that dissipated quickly.  S: Malts, and light hints of sweetness & hops. I'm missing the bread & honey notes I remember.  T: You notice the bitterness first that gives away to the malts and then the sweetness. Now I thought the flavor was very balanced but at the same time its not what I remember. The taste came off as flat, not from a lack of carbonation or alcohol just that the bottle might be a bit old. It didn't hold the same sweetness & bread flavors that I had remembered.  M: This is an easy to drink beer, but at the same it is a hair on the heavy side, almost creamy and goes down easy.  Overall its a solid beer and an old favorite, my total score is based on my overall experience with the beer and not my most recent tasting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,StoneTSR,3.18,"Reviewed this beer a few weeks ago on the phone, here is the interpretation of my notes:  APPEARANCE: Nice, golden copper color with a very pretty and perfectly sized head. Good looking color and overall appearance, but lacing was minimal.  SMELL: The Dead Guy Ale has always smelled Christmasy to me, and this pint was no exception. Malty and spicy, this a pretty decent smelling beer.  TASTE: For such a good looking and smelling beer, it really falls flat in the flavor department. Slightly bitter and hoppy, the Dead Guy is just not terribly entertaining to the palate. The word 'meh' comes to mind. It isn't bad, but it isn't good.  MOUTHFEEL: Very well carbonated and sparkly.  OVERALL: Again, one word can sum up this beer: meh.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ElCommodoro,3.79,"Poured a a cloudy translucent orange-brown colour with a light tan head that disappeared quickly. The colour was absolutely beautiful. I'm wary of such beers, but the taste did not disappoint. The smell was citrusy. It really didn't have much smell at all. The taste was quite pleasant as well. It had a little more hops than I'd like, but I'd expect that in a maibock. Not nearly as disgusting as Sierra Nevada's take on this style with their Glissade beer. The taste is pleasantly sweet with a strong citrusy hop overtone. For a hoppy beer, it's really very easy to drink. I don't taste any malt undertones, but I can clearly SEE that malts were not skimped on, so maybe I'm congested or maybe the citrusy hops just overpower everything else.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T&M - Nice crisp medium body, lots of malt, piney hops, alcohol, very sweet and bready.  O - Definitely a good beer. My first from Rogue so im stoked about trying the Double Dead Guy and their Shakespeare Stout.  Being a huge New Belgium fan, I considered this beer to be a ""Fat Tire"" of Oregon. After tasting and noticing the style and ABV I realized this is no where near a pale ale styled beer. Its a very interesting take on a session beer. There's really not much more to say about it. Its an amazing beer that should not be overlooked. As I said i'm super stoked about trying their Shakespeare. This brewery obviously has a passion for making darker beers, and making darker beers more session worthy if you will. Usually a semi-strong alcohol taste lowers the drinkibility, not in this case, this is a very drinkable, very well balanced beer. Stay thirsty my friends.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,harrymel,3.48,"A: Pours a copper apricot ale with brilliant clarity. Single finger head of loose off-peanut foam dissipates to thin sheet of the same. Spotty lacing.

132,355,marty21,3.73,A: Pours a clear amber/orange with two fingers worth of off white creamy head. Settles to a small cap and left thick lines of lacing.  S: The aroma is pretty sweet with some floral hops. Some sweet fruit and a little bit of bready malt as well.  T: Bready malt with a little bit of floral hops. The sweetness isn't near as prominent as it was in the aroma. There is a small sweet/spicy taste that lingers for a bit.  M: Light carbonation with a light to medium body.  O: It seems as though the MLCC has to mark most bottles from the U.S with a sticker stating a different Abv. It's been the case with all Rogue and Lost Coast products. Anyways this one is at 7% Abv. I thought this beer was going to be a lot more comlex but it's more of a simple beer.

132,355,thebrood1987,4.35,It literally smells like candy that has toffee and caramel in it. It also has a bready smell with some fruitiness from the Noble hops that I'm pretty sure they use. The taste mirrors the smell pretty much with that excellent toffee caramel malt taste which really adds a thick mouthfeel to the beer. It also has a bready sweetness before ending with a dry hop taste mixing with the large amount of malt they use in the finish and aftertaste. Delicious. The hops evolve more and more on the back of the tongue to really blend the malt and hops taste so well.  I love how Rogue blends their malts together to give a really rich thick taste in a lot of their beers. The hops sort of take a backseat to this beer but they start to shine through more with each sip. One of the very few Rogue beers you can get in a 6 pack but I'm glad they put this one in 6 packs because its an outstanding beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smells are deep, sweet and malty. There is a slight tang that accompanies. I have no doubt that the result will be more pronounced and identifiable with warmth, this beer is at only about 50 degrees (F) just now.

Earthy, spicy hops mix well with the sweet malt - like un-fermented wort. Saaz definitely stand out.  There is a bitterness straight through the front and back of the drink but underneath is a sweet grainy, circus peanut flavor what should stand out a bit more. There is an alcohol after taste and can be noted on the back of the throat.  Medium body with good carbonation and dry finish. The aftertaste is a bit too much on the top and sides of the tongue. Most likely the hop oils and not tannins since there is no puckering/astringency. 2/3 through the bottle and the alcohol has warmed up my mouth and chest a bit, feeling is pleasant, aftertaste not so much.

132,355,brewerburgundy,3.84,"On-tap at The Smoke and Barrel, Fayetteville, AR. Served in a shaker pint.  The color appears to be a very standard amber orange, it may be on the light side of that range. It's hard to tell in here. The head is creamy but small in a standard off white.  The first thing I notice about the aroma and taste is a gummy bear fruitiness. It's a new one to me, but awesome. Toast and bready Munich malt with a slight lemon edge.  It tastes so much like it smells, like jello before it's set, like gummy candy and toasted bread. There is residual alcohol that seems inappropriate, but at least to style, isn't. I think we all know this isn't really a Mai/Helles Bock though. There is also a little musty yeast.  Fizzle in a moderate body with melanoidin depth. The alcohol isn't hot, but I think it's undesirable in this particular beer.  That alcohol hampers drinkability a bit for me. This is much, much better than the bottle of this beer that I've had.

The aroma was of toasted caramel malts, citrus hops and a biscuit yeast with strong citrus, toffee and caramel notes.  The taste was sweetly bitter with a hint of caramel in the beginning then progressed into much bitterer flavor with a nice dose of citrus at the end, I am guessing a little lemon and grapefruit. The flavor stuck around long enough to let one enjoy the nice citrusy hoppy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel had a smooth creamy texture and a medium body with a prickly carbonation.

But American microbrew's are rare enough in this area to make this is a special nostalgic tasting. As a vegan though I really don't give a shit what animal goes best with this beer.  A: Two thick fingers of head with medium-large bubbles. Looks quite carbonated from a not so long pour. A deep amber color, quite impressed by its majestic hue of sunset.  S: Great aroma. It smells like a bock, a bit lighter though. Maltiness for sure, but cant locate the malt as being necessarily specific to the style. A hint of cookies.  T: Excellent! Its not as dense as most bocks but provides a manageable thickness. Has a very nice malt flavor but not enough to be heavy. A quenching bitterness that is also not overpowering for the style.  M: A moderate fizzy feeling with a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste that surfaces.  D: Definitely drinkable.

132,355,Intrinsic,3.7,"Dead Guy Ale doesn't have much head to speak of, and whatever you do manage to squeeze out of it is very light. It does, however, have an interesting cloudy caramel colour.  Strong aromas of malt and molasses with notes of banana make this a pleasant beer to smell. The only thing missing is my favourite ingredient - hops. They're not present in the flavour either. Following suit, the most powerful presence is the sweet malt they've chosen to use. But don't expect a bitter finish to balance the molasses or you'll be disappointed. Despite this, it really is a tasty beer and they've stumbled upon a great recipe if you're into this style of ale.  This beer is slightly syrupy, but the long finish helps this beer glide right down your throat. I highly recommend it to anyone who prefers lightly hopped ales.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

There is a bread yeast aroma that is superbly potent. The taste however is surprisingly awkward. While there are minor biscuit and malt flavors the main body is rather fruity to my palate. There is almost a raspberry apple flavor that is strong on the tongue. The body is really quite watery, but for a lighter bock it's not too bad. The drinkability of this beer isn't all that great.

132,355,afogg0855,4.13,"A beautiful deep golden honey in my glass brings a smile to my face! The head is only a few centimeters high but it stays a while and gives a nice creaminess to the first few sips.  As I've come to expect with Dead Guy I get the nice malty sweetness up front, with a great finish. I'm left with a sweet aftertaste that's almost as nice as the first sip.  This is truly gold in a glass.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,THECPJ,3.6,"Reviewed from notes:  Appearance: Orangish brown with 2 fingerhead  Smell: spicy malt aroma, biscuity  Taste: caramel malts, little hop appearance  Mouthfeel: mild carbonation, smooth  Drinkability: very easy drinkable ale from these guys.

132,355,Digimaika2,3.78,"A: Nice big single inch of foam that vanishes quick! Light orange/brownish colour.  S: Pine, honey, some floral scents, and lingering biscuity malts.  T: A sweet and syrupy malt taste dominates, with some hops coming through aswell. Overall well balanced between the malts and hops. Little kick of bitterness near the end evolves into a comfortable, warming sweetness.  M: Thick, oily and creamy mouthfeel but the thickness works well. A bit more carbonation than I was expecting but not a turnoff.  D: I will definitely be purchasing this again, but considering the oily thickness and overall sweetness I don't think I could have too many in a night. Overall a delicious beer that I would recommend.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Duckmancgy,3.78,"Serving: 12oz bottle to pint glass  After opening but before pouring I noticed the smell from the bottle was more malty than I expected.  Pouring showed a gorgeous coppery tan colour and a nice inch and half of soft head. The head started to dissipate as soon as i started to carry the glass to the other room. At this point the smell really carried sweet maltiness with an after thought of flowery hops.  First taste surprised me, a bit too carbonated for my usual palate, but nice sweetness. My wife complained of bitterness but I didn't notice it as much (could be me being used to higher hopped IPA's).  Mouthfeel was surprisingly good, even with the higher carbonation than I was used to. The carbonation seemed to be smaller bubbled which spread across my tongue and really mellowed out nicely. Unfortunately the flavouring wasn't something I was all that pleased with so can't really see this being something I would drink as often as others.  Surprisingly enough I really really enjoy the double dead guy, but not so much the regular dead guy..",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Franz4,3.63,"On draft 2/22/11  A- copper color, slightly hazy but not much, no head on it by the time it got to my table.  S- nose was biscuity with the malts seeming somewhat subdued  T- again, malty, buttery biscuits, also seemed a little sweeter than normal.  M- very smooth, carbonation seemed appropriate  D- I'm a little puzzled by this one, as it seemed a little off. Dead Guy is one of my old favorites, but I wasn't feeling this one. It also had the disadvantage of following a CBC Creeper, but measures were taken to cleanse the palatte.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,tbraun1,4.13,"12oz bottle to pint glass  Appearance - Golden amber color, two finger creamy head and circles of lacing with each sip. Beautiful contrast between the copper amber color and white frothy head.  Smell - Sweet malts jump at your nose, with a subtle spicy hop undertone. Yeast leaves a bit of fruity esters as well.  Taste - Hops are more pronounced than what hits your nose but is a great balance with the malts in this brew. Has just enough bite and pronounced alcohol in the finish. When it warmed up a little, had a nice bread like aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Beer feels somewhat heavy to medium heavy on the palate and is not overly carbonated.  Drinkability - This is the first time I have tried this brew and I am very pleased. A nice balance; Not too hoppy, not too malty, and a nice alcohol kick that lets you know it means business. Very well balanced indeed. Would purchase again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,wrcraigl,5,"This is by far my most favorite beer to drink on any occasion. The price can be a little steep but have a growler I can refill that makes it reasonable.

132,355,quisatzhaderach,3.69,"The beer pours a cloudy copper with a dense head.  The aroma is dominated by a very appropriate malt character, which is finely complimented by a unique and clean yeast presence.  The taste is nuanced and malty, backed by a balanced hop bitterness. There is a strange (but wonderful) oceanic note to the finish.  The liquid is almost creamy, but finishes with a blunted carbonation.  The beer is quite drinkable, for a sturdy beer lover.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,kbrady9,4.39,"A- A light copper color. Fairly small head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing though.  S-I bought a six pack about 3 weeks ago and this is the last beer. I am not much a fan of bocks, but I tried to give this one a chance over time. I have grown to appreciate the straightforward, sweet and malty aroma. I prefer a beer heavy on hops, but for a Bock this one is very impressive.  T-The beer is sweet, but not offputting for someone who does not enjoy sweet beers. Very malty until the end when a bit of bitterness comes through. It's the best tasting bock I have had.  M-A thick, almost creamy character when it first hits the palate. Goes down very smooth. Would not call this crisp.  D-If you are a Bock fan, this is a good choice. Very drinkable beer, more than a sipper.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,joelshults,4.35,"I really had no idea what to expect from this beer. I've seen it in the store a hundred times but never bought it. I always thought it was a dark and bitter beer for some reason. I guess that's how I think of Dead Guy's, dark and bitter.  But it is really on the opposite end of the spectrum. It's a beautiful copper color with a sweet malty smell. But the crazy thing is the flavor. It tastes like honey and in a completely opposite way of what you're probably thinking. It isn't cloyingly sweet or thick. The flavor has all of the floral taste of an expensive, organic honey. This beer is absolutely delicious and I am not a fan of sweet beers.  It seems like they might be missing a huge audience with the packaging. I really like the whole Dia de la Muerta thing they have going on, but I would think that this beer would sell like gangbusters to women if you named it something that was more reminiscint (sp?) of what it actually tastes like.  I haven't been this surprised by a beer in a long time. Absolutely delicious. And I just looked up there at the top of this page and see that it's 6.5% ABV. Holy Crap! I would've guessed 4%.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,fdw3,4.22,"Pours a translucent orange/amber color with a healthy off-white head that retains and laces moderately well. Smells of sweet malt, honey, and molasses combined with floral hop notes. Taste stays true to smell and the malty sweetness of honey and caramel are up front but fade to a hoppy bitterness in the back. Body is medium with moderate carbonation for a very smooth, yet crisp feel.  A deliciously balanced beer with high drinkability. Alcohol is well hidden and sweet notes are not overpowering -- definitely a beer I will come back to. I've added this to my long list of favorites from Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,generallee,4.62,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a Rogue Dead Guy pint glass.  Appearance: From the pour I got a good thick and creamy off white head. This sits on top of a beautiful medium orange amber body with a light haze. As I drink the head slowly fades to a wispy covering and leaves some nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is full of bready sweetness, bready yeast and mellow hops.  Taste/Palate: The flavor has good toasted and bready maltiness with some mild caramel, toffee and light nutty notes. This is backed up with nice herbal/floral hop balance. It finishes well balanced and extremely drinkable. The palate has a smooth full feel with soft carbonation.  Notes: In my opinion this a very well made and wonderfully balanced Maibock. (Dead on for the style.)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,tjsdomer2,3.61,"Appearance: Golden brown. A very nice and rather unique color. Can't say the foam is outstanding, but it was pretty good all the same. Great lacing and swirling carbonation. Excellent!  Smell: I don't really know what to make of this. It's not bad, that's for sure, but kind of smells like musty bread. When it warms, some nice caramel notes come through.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Overall, this has a bread-like maltiness to it. Some balanced sweetness in the background. I don't find this amazing though. The flavors don't really come together well enough for me to give this a 4. Mouthfeel is good though with nice carbonated feel. Slightly watery in the finish, but thats only bad enough to prevent an excellent rating.  Drinkability: Not that exciting in my opinion, but its mellow enough to kick back a few.  Overall: Definitely disappointed with this. Rogue XS Imperial Red is a better bet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,HopzMan,4.1,One of my favorites from Rouge! Slightly darker copper appreance. Nice strong stench that fills your nostrils. It has a very unique strong taste at first but leaves a nice smooth after taste. I have never had it on tap but bottled is just as good I assume. Highly suggested if you have not tried and are a big Bock fan...,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Shrews629,3.97,"Appearance - Very nice copper/dark orange/amber color. Off white head that was somewhat small, but tight. Not much retention, but did leave some pretty good lacing on the glass. It's hazy with some lighter orange highlights.  Smell - In the smell, I detected some well rounded caramel sweetness. Hints of peach and a fragrance similar to a candy apple. Some breadiness is there, but it seems to be pushed to the side to let the sweetness come through.  Taste - The taste revealed some caramel and some dry wheat bread. Some candy sweetness with the ripe apple. Very well balanced. Some prominent bitterness tickles the tongue. Only a small, welcome alcohol warmth and flavor.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. Smooth. Crisp. Dry and slightly refreshing. Covers the palate very well. Leaves plenty of flavor behind.  Drinkability - This, once again, is a solid, well rounded effort from Rogue. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite brewers. This brew is easily drinkable. Would work well at any point during the year. It is considerably sweet, so that may deter some, but it would still be enjoyable for me through several rounds. Worth a try if you haven't tried it yet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,joshuasamantha,4.43,"Had on-tap, in growler, and in bottle. Lived in Oregon for awhile so I frequented the brewery whenever I had the chance.

132,355,paxkey,4.03,picked up a 6 at the summerhill lcbo. love the bottle. great label and cap.  beer smell wafts up from bottle when i pop the cap.  the beer looks great in a glass. 3 finger fluffy white head off an aggressive pour.  the color is straight amber. a bit hazy in glass. head is sticking around.  great balance of hops and malts makes this delicious and drinkable.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bucklemyshoe,4.05,"Pint on-tap at Mellow Mushroom, into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.  A: The pour is mohogany with a finger of frothy foam that laces very well.  S: Nuttiness, caramel, toffee, and toast. It smells like a lagered version of a brown ale or strong ESB.  T: This has much more flavor on-tap; butterscotch, hazelnut, sweet caramel and bready malts, and some light chocolatey notes.  M: It has a medium body that is quite creamy with perfection carbonation levels.  D: This is a pretty good brew that often gets over-looked due to the bashing of Rogue. When it's reasonably priced, it is well worth drinking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Lauthaha,4.07,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a half-liter beer glass.  Appearance: Light amber/tan color, slightly translucent. Good carbonation, with a foamy off-white head.  Smell: Sweet, thick maltiness with a well-balanced floral hop profile. I would have pegged it for an IPA.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Bite-n-crisp; bitter hop/herb flavor is corroborated by a mild floral kick. After the carbonation kicks in, a mellow breadiness takes hold. The aftertaste is hop oil and herb flavor.  Drinkability: It's okay. A touch less taste than I remembered/expected, but not a bad beer at all. Personally, however, I'd be reluctant to put up $5 for a deuce-deuce of the sweet juice known as Dead Guy Ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,inlimbo77,2.61,"12oz bottle pourted into Long Trail VT pint glass. No bottle date present. Does Rogue ever do this? They should...  A: Clear amber color. Filtered nicely. One finger head, if that. Collapses quickly. Poor carbonation. Good lacing. Age might be a factor to all these.  S: Mild hops, malts and bready yeast flavor. Something smelled off?  T: Yeasty, malts, and no hop backbone. This must be a bad beer here. I wish there was a bottle date.  M: Nothing really. Really watery....really.  D: I couldn't even finish this one. Really wouldn't drink another one...but I might be chalking this up to a skunked OLD beer.  Overall, I was pretty upset with this purchase. I was expecting more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dbaker61,4.24,"Appearance: This one foamed all over upon opening, so my tasting had to wait while I cleaned up. Finally poured into the glass, it produced a creamy one inch head which dissipated slowly, leaving delicate lacing. The color is an orange-brown, a bit cloudy.  Smell: Spicey and fruity, with a good dose of hops in the nose. Very nice; I forgive it for being in such a hurry to get out of the bottle.  Taste: More spice, wonderful hops slightly dominating the ample sweet maltiness. Great balance.  Mouthfeel: Big, big body, lots of chewy flavors. Finishes nicely dry.  Drinkability: The Dead Guy is very tasty, I'd have another if I had one here. Definitely a beer to try more than once.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MikeInThe517,3.53,It's not bad. I don't know if it's quite worth 13 bucks for a six pack.  It tastes like iced-tea (with a hint of lemon) flavored beer--a good mid/late spring/early summer kind of flavor (but alas it is early February here in Michigan)  First tried this on tap at the Edgewater Tavern in Chicago. It was something of an enigma then and it's something of an enigma now. Not that there's anything fundamentally wrong with that.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,r0nyn,4.1,"Poured from a bottle into my Otter Creek nonic.  Pours a hazy, orangeish apricot hue with a small, white head that recedes quickly, leaving stringy, loose lacing sliding down the inside of the glass. Lazy lines of carbonation rise up from the bottom. Nose is full of sweet malts with hints of some spicy notes. Hops are barely detectable at the end.  Big malty kick to start, with nuances of sweet fruit and toasted grain. Little bit of yeasty breadiness as well. This is tempered by the appearance of light, bitter hops which provide the brew with an even balance of bitter and sweet. Rounds off with a hoppy finish, and a slight lingering aftertaste of fruits and caramel. Mouthfeel has a crispness to it, with an almost chewy quality. Medium-bodied with a creamy finish, it's quite palatable.  Drinkability is quite good. With a well-balanced flavor profile, a pleasant mouthfeel and a relatively light ABV, Dead Guy Ale is very drinkable. Rogue has let me down before with their line of oddball beers, but I'm liking this brew. Wouldn't mind knocking back a couple of these every once in a while.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,CaptDavyJones,3.83,"Poured a clear copper color from a 12 oz bottle. No freshness date or ABV on the label. Nice one finger head that dissipates slowly. Good carbonation. Aroma is high on malts with some hints of spice. Taste is also high on malts with a sweetish finish, hints of honey. Good lacing along the inside of the glass. Easy to drink and can be a good sessions beer. Worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bwan15,4.33,"Appearance: Pours a handsome golden-brown. Head settles down to half a finger in no time. Lovely carbonation bubbles bubbling gently to the surface.  Smell: Wholesome, hoppy nose and a decidedly sweet, honey-oat kind of aura conjured upon agitation.  Taste: Lovely balance between sweet malt and bitter hops. A stony ballast holds down the bottom, and the aftertaste is pleasantly warm.  Mouthfeel: Seems pretty spot on. Wet at first and dry at the end.  Drinkability: A great session beer. Nothing terribly innovative or particularly interesting, but it's a great go-to when you are looking for a simple, balanced, well-crafted ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,OBeerMeGreatOne,4,"From notes: Look: Hazy, light brown/orange. Two finger head that leaves great lacing. Smell: Sweet malts, earthy hops. Taste: Very balanced sweet malts and grassy hops.

Smells bready and sweet, with hints of apple and white grape juice and vanilla. Tastes of real sweet malt but not overly sweet, citrus and tropical fruit, nutty, yeasty, bready, mild bitterness. Had a stucky and syrupy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Highly drinkable in my book.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Dshaw,4.37,Appearance- It looks a little light but not too light more of a amber color to it. I poured from a bottle to a 12oz glass and the head of the beer is the best appearence almost a yellow frothy look.  Smell- The smell is another one of my favorite parts about it. I can smell mangos i think.  Taste- Ok at first it is a little bitter but once it settles it has a great full flavor tast to it. I can definitely tast a sweetness as if the beer is made with fruits along with the hops and barley.  Mouthfeel- Just average no other way i can put it.  Drinkability- This beer is to be sipped for sure. Im gonna drink this very slowly.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,tmcelvain,4.01,"This is a go-to beer for me - a good drink when I want something solid, but not a challenge to the taster in me. Good looking amber beer. In fact, would put this as an American Amber if tasting it blind. A well balanced beer, not something the hopheads would be wowed by. In fact, I think this is more malty, but less sweet than other Maibocks. Slight tastes of candied malts, with a raisin bitterness taste on the finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,CuriousMonk,4,Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass or on tap. Cloudy orange pour with a huge foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly hoppy. It reminds me of an DIPA that has sat around awhile and had its hoppy profile start shifting to a more malty balance. Flavor is malty with some citrus/fruity notes to it. Finish is a clean and slightly hoppy feeling on your tongue. I love the uniqueness of this beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Brunite,3.16,"Appearance: A hazy amber/deep orange...honeylike in color, off white head which settles quickly.  Smell: Sweet, malty, bready. Could not detect any hops right away.  Taste: Bitterness not apparent in the smell is now at the forefront. There is some citrus and some sweetness. You can taste the alcohol here.  Mouthfeel: Light....but balanced. Dry finish.  Drinkability: Nice average drink. Not spectacular.  Overall: OK but would not actively seek this out. I'll finish the sixer but unless I detect a huge difference in the flavor, I'll likely not return. Very dry and bitter on the end with no lingering flavor. No delicious hoppiness....just bitter...no real complexity or depth here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MaltsOfGlory,3.97,"Pours a nice one finger head, looks like an IPA to me, very orange and hazy, not hazy like a Belgian wheat though. Looks decent, head is fading quickly though. Smells hoppy in the front end, with a slight malt note in the back end. Maybe a slight fruit or citrus note hidden in there somewhere too. Wow, taste is very smooth, probably the smoothest hoppy beer I have ever had, granted it's not as hoppy as some beers, but still. Pretty simple beer all together though, at first you just get that smooth feel and then come the hops and malts, if there is any fruit or citrus, it is almost undetectable in the taste. Pretty good beer all together, nothing outstanding, but pretty good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,USAF,4.43,"Second time I've had this beer. It has a great flavor and is very easy to drink. nice pour, nice head, and not too bitter.

132,355,Satchboogie,3.83,"12oz bottle poured into a Duvel glass: This was the very first beer/craft beer I bought and it's time to return and review.  A: Pours orange amber, very hazy and opaque, 1 finger off-white foamy head that sticks around for a little while. Leaves just a little lacing.  S: A little musty fruitiness (peach) on the nose, light floral hop in the background, slightly dark grains that seem almost like a sweet bread.  T: The saaz hops are in the forefront and give it a pilsner like flavor, but the with more depth. The malt character is quite good for the style, it has just a little sweetness and light fruitiness, while having a clean golden grain backbone. The malt is quite earthy, reminds me of the sprucy grain in Santa's Private Reserve. I like the use of ale yeast, I think it gives the beer a better background character. Finish is a little sticky with a clean saaz hop lingering flavor.  M: Low carbonation, medium body, a little chewy and sticky. I'd prefer more carbonation, crispness, and viscosity.  D: I found this drank fairly easily, it's just about standard ABV with a light body and nothing overpowering. I do think a little more carbonation would help make it more crisp and drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,DmanGTR,3.11,"Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Cloudy/hazy burnt tangerine with a decent 1.5"" white head. Diminished to a thick ring with spotty lace. Prominent whiff of alcohol and very little else to back it up. Hint of citrus and grass, maybe some cereal grains in there somewhere. The flavor is a little better, with a healthy blend of honey and caramel followed by delicate touch of grapefruit. Herbal and grassy finish. There's a huge turnoff here... why is my bottle of Dead Guy metallic tasting? Metallic finish kind of kills the 4.0 I was gonna give it... Hearty and almost ""meaty"" texture. Nicely carbonated and quite smooth. Almost thick to the point where it coats the palate but actually gives a very balanced body between sweet and dry. Was going to give better drinkability, but this metallic flavor is getting on my nerves.... along with the crazy alcoholic nose. Gah...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rundocrun,3.31,"A - Very coppery orange color (interesting). Very little head and what does form fades quickly.  N - Nice spicy, hoppy notes. Some bready malt aroma wafting up too.  T - Honestly, I have no idea what a true Maibock is supposed to taste like as this is the first one I've ever had. Nice clean hoppy flavors up front that immediately hits the sides of the tongue with an uber-sweet malty body that lasts all the way to the end. Also some residual bitterness riding out to the end.Downside is the sweetness can get a little cloying - but maybe that's the true nature of a Maibock?  M - Not watery, but not chewy. The sweet maltiness detected in the taste definitely carries over in to the body of the beer.  D - Quite drinkable, I thought. Only deterrent is the aforementioned sweetness that has a tendency to override the palate-cleansing hop flavors.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kalkavekkian,4,Grabbed a bottle of this with my perch dinner last week and took a few notes. A= Beer was a light cloudy orange with very little head and no lacing to speak of. S= Smelled lightly of fruit and faint hops. T= Taste was nice and evenly smooth with malts and hops well balanced. M= Felt good on the palate with a nice bitterness at the finish. D= This is a very drinkable beer with a decent abv and well balanced flavor that i will buy again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,HOPPYKC,3.98,Got this poured into a pint glass off tap from Yardhouse in Kansas city ks. Had a very small amount of head that was light tan to white. The color is bright orange to a light copper in color with a little visible carbonation and clear to see through.  The smell is hard to recognize at first light hops and a bit of a bready taste. It's has a very strong fruity and complex spiced flavor to it. The taste followes right along with the smell but I get a bit more of the fruit.  The mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty great. A little think on the mouth feel but a great drinkability. My first from Rogue but not my last. A good choice.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,mdunman,4.27,"A: Clear golden brown with a thin head that didn't stay very long at all.  S: Spices all over. Roasted malt and hops balance well.  T: Roasted malt and spices tingle through the tongue, like a mild Fat Tire. Finished with more dryness than Fat Tire as the hops really stood out at the end.  M: Medium body, decent carbonation that was fairly smooth going down.  Overall I liked this beer a lot. As I said in the taste, it reminds me of a mild Fat Tire.

Beautiful bubbles cascade to the top of a foamy medium size white head, which dissipates rather quickly but leaves excellent lacing  S-Blended malt and hop smell with slight sugary smell  T-Along the same lines as the smell, but with a bit more hop flavoring, along with caramel and the definite added presence of citrus (how did I miss that in the nose)  M-Crisp, clean, medium carbonation, no hop sting at all, relatively light feel for a 6.5%  D-I honestly have never heard of a Mailbock but I'd be certainly willing to try another if this beer is a standard example of one.

Smell: A pleasant, sweet, malty aroma  Taste: Balanced malty taste, with one big flavor that I can't put my finger on, but is quite enjoyable. If drank from a bottle, that flavor overwhelms the palate and kills the taste, so this is a good example of why you should always pour.  Mouthfeel: Pretty standard, normal carbonation level  Drinkability: Very good, not perfect as the flavors will get overwhelming if too much is drank.  Overall, an excellent beer, wish I had tried it sooner.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TexIndy,4.14,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. No bottling or date info. It was a slightly hazy honey color with good amount of carb streams. It had a small, fizzy head that quickly settled into nothing. With the amount of carb streams, I would have expected a better head and at least a good sized collar. Weird.  The aroma was sweet fruit, toasted caramel malts, some spice from the yeast and hops. Good for the style. The taste follows the aroma and starts off sweet with some spice coming soon after and then ending with a moderately bitter finish. Good build from sweet to bitter without overdoing it at the end. Mouthfeel was medium with good carb level and good aftertaste.  Overall, a really good maibock. I'd have this years ago when I first got into craft beers and hated it. Glad I tried it again as I liked it much, much better this time around. Recommend especially if you want to try the style. Avail here in TX. Rotation - while it was good, I'm in a long term hop phase so don't see being a 6 pack or bomber but maybe the occasional single or tap. [O;O]",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T/M - tastes very much like the nose except none of the raspberry. you can definitely taste the citrus from the orange. good bit of hops but nothing too bitter. light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. finishes off clean, not too much of a bite.

T - Similar to nose, floral and bready sweetness balanced well with hops biters, pumpernickel bread. I remember the on tap Dead Guy being more hoppy. Finishes dry and bitter, starts off very sweet.  M - Very little carination and a medium body make this an enjoyable beer, different in body then many maibock beers I believe this beer to be more flavorful then a typical maibock.

132,355,BB1313,4.32,"Finally decided to review this one. I definitely credit Dead Guy for helping me get into craft beer. I simply loved this beer, and still do. Pours a nice golden/brown with amazing white fluffy head and decent lacing. Rogue has some great looking heads on their beers. Dead Guy has a unique aroma, it may be from the pacman yeast. It's very bready/doughy with subtle hops shining through. Taste is unique as well, which I'll credit to the yeast; slightly sweet. Medium-bodied w/ the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, easy to drink a couple.. it's hard to stop because it tastes so good.  This is a classic craft beer.. the definition of a flagship brew, IMO. Everyone who's everyone that's into the craft scene must try this at least once.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T: Fruity as well, I can taste the alcohol here and also finishes with a delicate yet enjoyable hop bitterness.  M: Not impressed with the mouthfeel here.

Sweet and Malt dominated. The body has a deep malt complexity with some piney hops stuck right in there. There is just the right amount of bitterness to take over for the deep malt texture.

Fairly light in color for a bock. There really isn't much of a smell, just a little sweet candy smell. The taste starts with the sweet malts and finishes with small hop bite that leaves a nice aftertaste. A very good beer. Definitely a beer that will be looked for again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Morey,3.88,"This ale pours copper-orange in color and is quite hazy in appearance. Two finger off-white head has settled to a thin lace after just a few minutes. Pretty good head retention.  The aroma is similar to that of an English style bitter. Nice blend of hops and malts in the nose. Slightly earthy.  Taste is more of the same. This beer is a cross between a Maibock and a Bitter in my opinion. Sharp bitterness up front followed by a rush of thick bready malt.  Medium to almost full bodied mouthfeel.  I could drink a few of these before I was ready to switch things up.  Morey's Bottom Line: Not my favorite style, but this is definitely a good representation.

Also picking up some pepper-like spices throughout consumption, and it has a nice, somewhat bitter finish which i really enjoy.

Hop aromas are present although it is not real bitter. Clean and refreshing however not lacking in flavor.  M- Slightly above average mouthfeel. Nice calm astringency begs for another sip. Average carbonation... not too much not too little.  D- Good drinkability.

132,355,Weizenmensch,4.23,"Nice beer, cool name. Imported to Japan, and thence to down here by that guy in Hokkaido who imports these ones. Glad he did, this is a solid brew. Is it really a bock? I don't know why they'd call it an ale if it's a bock (i.e. bocks are dark lagers, bottom-fermented by definition). Seems on this website a lot of beers are misidentified by noobs and then the style listed is never changed because it's too much of a hassle for all concerned!  To me, this is an American ale of a high standard. Deep golden copper with a trace of head and lots of thin lacing. Low carbonation. Full of flavour - the sweet notes of candied sugar (not sure if this is just the malt though), pleasing tart hoppiness without too much astringency or excessive bitterness, nice mouthfeel that's not too sticky nor too bland, and very drinkable. Aromas aren't too strong, and this is out of an almost-snifter, because of the low head retention and carbonation, but that's OK. This is a solid beer with an attractive appearance, pleasing taste and cool bottle artwork, that I will gladly drink again any time I get the chance.

Smell is rich, smoky, slightly sweet malts. Very nice. Taste starts and ends bitter, with the middle part being those pungent malts. Very good balance.

S: Really great malt aroma, with a hint of sweetness. I seem to notice a faint amount of caramel. T: To be this beer is like a chameleon. In one taste it is very much like a pale ale, light malt, spice, and sweetness. But then on another sip, it has flavor qualities of a darker, deeper beer.

I don't understand why it's always $8.50-$9 when all our other local beers are usually $6 give or take. Rogue has this and their ""Santa"" beer, not sure what that's called and some bombers on the local shelves like Safeway or Fred Meyer. (I've never tried any of those). I did not like the flavor of this beer and for being the most expensive of the shelf at Wal Mart (ha ha ha) it really wasn't that good. It seemed like a chore to get it down. If they lowered the price ever I'd try it again.  One time I was watching the news and they said they were going to start shipping this stuff to Japan to crack the market there. I don't know if that means they're tring to be really high class or what. I think if you're local then try to have a regular price like $6 or so everyone can afford.

It is malty with just enough hop to back it up, the balance is perfect to me. The taste is clean and finishes well. You always want another drink. Anyways, the most prominent taste is a sweet malt followed by some earthy hops. Has a nice smooth medium body with average carbonation. Overall this is a wonderful beer, only downside is high ABV and high price which make it not so sessionable, not that I wouldn't like to try.

In terms of taste I get lots of sweet breadiness, with some prominent but not over the top citric and piney hops. This is delicious actually. I also get a little bit of apricot, and some rich caramel and toffee notes.  Mouthfeel on this beer is excellent, it is relatively creamy and coats the mouth well, without being insufficiently dry.

132,355,PEIBeerGuy,3.73,"What great review timing! I didn't even save this to review on Halloween on purpose.  Dead Guy Ale has a colour akin to an IPA or amber ale... deep & honey-like. A hard pour will give lots of head that leaves foamy, spotty lacing.  It smells a bit like a weissbier. It has a smooth kind of smell to it... I pick out bits of banana, honey, wheat, and some spice... like clove or even nutmeg. It's a bit hoppy in its smell, but I think the malty traits smooth it out.  There is definitely a bit of spice in the taste, like clove and pepper, that almost gives the mouth a bit of a tingle. It has a creamy essence and taste... almost custard-like in that regard. Flavours of wheat, honey, maybe some dough, and toned-down malty sweetness (toffee/caramel) also play their part.  Feel-wise, it's smooth. The carbonation is fine... if anything, a little low, but I think it suits the smooth smell and taste. Some people complain it's a bit too bitter for them, but I don't pick that up from it.  Overall, a good beer. It kind of reminds me of Granite Brewery's ""Peculiar"". Not necessarily in taste, but in that it's hard to exactly peg or pigeon-hole it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,GRPunk,3.97,"The attractive, glowing growler was a bit of an impulse buy for Halloween. Poured into a pils glass.  A- A moderate pour generated loads of cascading carbonation that looked almost like a nitro-pour. The result was a slow forming, 1-finger+, eggshell head. It eventually dropped to a full film before falling a part a bit well into the glass. The body is a slightly hazy, copper-gold with light carbonation. A lot of nice sticky rings and spots were left on the glass.  S- Lots of sweet malts at first. Kind of caramel and bready. Hopping sort of plays second fiddle with herbal/grassy notes. Warmth brings out more caramel and a sweet, fruity aspect.  T- Quite rich and complex. A little brown sugar at first sip. Melon-like fruity notes. A little herbal/resiny hop to balance and dry the finish. Doughy background. It starts sugary sweet, morphs into a bready/doughy flavor and ends with an herbal/spicy finish. Maybe a bit out of the style I'm used to, but interesting enough to be pretty good.  M- Pretty viscus and slightly coating. Dryish, hoppy finish cleans it up. Just a touch of pleasant graininess. Moderate carbonation and subtle hops make for a slight bite. A little warming in the belly.  D- It's a decent drinker. Maybe a bit more malt-centric and sweeter than some of my Maibock favorites. Something that would pair well with pizza. The growler is a bit gimmicky and a touch over-priced. Even the bomber and sixer prices are a touch high, in my opinion. This was really tough to rate. I don't think it's a traditional Maibock, yet still a pretty solid beer. I keep finding myself wanted to ""up"" or ""down"" each category by about 1/2 point.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Bitterbill,3.23,"Orange coloured, good 1"" head of foam and good lacing.  Smell has some hoppy bitter notes with a minimal nose of malt, bread.  The taste has a light sweet malt appearance initially but is soon taken over by a blast of hop bitterness that is mostly bitter...aspirin like. Been a while since I had one of these. It's much more bitter and non style like than I remember.  Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Good mouth feel.  Drinkability is not so good. The one pint was all I could handle at the Old Chicago. If it's going to have a bitter dominance, I'd prefer citrus/pine/grass over aspirin any day..",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T: Sweet bready malt dominates with not quite enough hop character to balance. The floral flavors come through nicely and balance surprisingly well with the citrus flavors. Not as cloying as I expected upon first sip. Very little aftertaste.  M: Medium body and moderate carbonation. Smooth, and somewhat tongue-coating. Very light carbonic bite.

Inviting appearance for sure.  S - Fruity was the first thing to come to mind. Plenty of hops. This beer's nose makes you think of nature and warm weather.

132,355,vandemonian,3.82,Dead Guy Ale has a slightly cloudy orange colour. The head lasted less than a minute but it maintained some lacing around the edge of the glass. The smell is of floral hops. The taste is warm and malty with a hint of hoppy high notes. The maltiness intensifies as you swallow until some bitterness can be tasted.

Pine bark is the dominant aroma and is prominent in taste. A bit astringent and thin to my taste, but a reasonable choice for some strong-flavored foods, such as curries, which it will complement nicely.  Lack of character and one-dimensionality of this beer precludes me from drinking it often, but at times, especially when it's available fresh in a growler, I'll get it and enjoy while the growler lasts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,echoes,3.59,"Served in a glass.  A: Pours a merky/cloudy dark orange almost brown. Hardly any carbonation after pouring. Very thick white head that dissipates very slowly. Very little lacing. (The previous analogy of it looking like unfiltered apple cider is dead on).  S: Definitely can smell the hops. Smells fresh & crisp. Maybe a very faint fruity aroma as well. Also maybe a very slight wheat smell to it.  T: Overall flavor is quite bitter for an ale in my experience. Seems more like a lager to me. Taste is crisp. Hops flavor is probably what causes the bitterness although maybe it is also a lemon flavor. Ever so slightly sweet. A little soapy.  M: Feels nice and smooth in the mouth. Not coarse at all. Doesn't feel light but not real heavy either.  D: Could tolerate a second bottle but probably not more than that.  I was attracted to this by the fact that it was in the craft beers section of a local grocery store (it was refrigerated and not exposed to too much light/was covered well). What also attracted me is that it was on sale for $10 for a six pack. I thought with an average B+ rating on BA (w/ almost 2000 reviews) and $10 a six pack (on sale! mind you) it had to be great or quite good. I had to try it. My conclusion is that this is definitely not worth $10 for a six pack. Maximum I would pay for it after trying it is $6-7. This ""ale"" is more befitting a lager. It is more bitter than most ales I've tried but it isn't a terrible tasting beer just not great. Give this a try if you don't mind your beer (or ale for that matter) a bit bitter. Not my every day type of beer though but to each his own. Update: No wonder I thought this was more like a lager, I didn't notice the BA type of ""Maibock/Helles Bock"" which explains why I thought it was more like a lager.

A little bit of a buttery caramel also is there. Citrus hops come in for a pretty nice finish, not very bitter but good hop flavor.  M- Medium body with relatively high carbonation.

T - Starts off juicy with an apple juice tartness and moves to a lightly bittering flavor from the hops. Hop flavors of grapefruit. Not nearly as bitter as expected. Finishes with a cider sweetness. Kind of dull all around and nothing that really sticks out.  M/D - Medium body that is nicely carbonated but is somewhat flat on the palate when it comes to body and mouth feel.

No flavors stood out to me and I wasn't sure what this beer was trying to be. The main thing that stuck out to me was a bit of a yeasty aftertaste. I was somewhat disappointed.  Then I got busy doing a few things as the beer settled in the glass. Upon my next sip, I was very impressed with how pleasant and balanced the flavor was. I started to wonder if this was intended to be a red ale. There's no prevalent sign of hoppiness or nuttiness, just a copper-colored ale that tastes great. Very drinkable.

132,355,HopJ,3.68,Seems like I have tasted a bunch of this over the last year. A nice option to add to any repertoire since it seems to be readily available. I ended moving this to a tulip which helped coax out the malty aromas. Along with malts I got toffee and something like bread pudding. This did need to warm up a bit for the aromas to come alive. The malty flavors are quickly matched by the hops. A nice bitterness on the finish. A very solid and balance beer. One I will grab whenever it is on sale.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MaxBrewell,4.24,"650 mL bottle poured into a frosted mug.  A - Gorgeous amber color with 1/2 inch beige head that gently fades, leaving an intricate lacing that clings to the glass.  S - Nothing spectacular here, but sweet, caramel notes up front are followed by a mellow toffee finish.  T - Full-on malt at the onset and nicely balanced by the hops to finish smooth.  M - Medium body and carbonated on the low-end for a nice rich feel.  D - Extremely well-balanced beer. Alcohol level is appropriate. Great session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bagpiper2005,3.88,"Pour: Light red-amber color. Two fingers of head that dissipates somewhat slowly, leaves just a little lacing on the glass.  Smell: Sweet malty caramel and pale malt aroma. A hint of citrus hops underneath.  Taste: Pretty straightforward with a sweet malty taste. Hops in the background to balance it out. Nothing really too complex or special.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth, and fairly low carbonation.  Drinkability: Top marks in this category. Drinks very easily, not overly filling, and very sessionable.  Final Notes: Definitely more of a session beer, and I must say it's kind of nice Rogue makes one. That said, it lacked the interest and off-the-wall characteristics I've come to expect from Rogue, and as such it was a bit of a disappointment. Still a great beer though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,chrisgn,3.78,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a BN Army pint glass.  A- Reddish brown color, hazy. Thick white head with lacing all up and down the glass. Head doesnt quit.  S- malty sweetness characters present from the nose.  T- Nicely balanced beer. Sweet malt flavor is the predominate character. Beer could use a little more flavor in one direction of another. Flavor falls a little flat on the backend.  M- nice rich mouthfeel.  D- Very drinkable, no overpowering flavors. Not too high in alcohol and alcohol flavors a hidden.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Blind00Squirrel,4.24,poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass  A: In this glass the color is awesome. It's light honey at the bottom and gradually grows into a dark amber underneath a 1 finger head. The carbonation is very good. The head thins out in a few minutes and the beer leaves great lacing.  S: Light bread tones up front with sweeter undertones  T: Very smooth. Drinks like it smells: sweet malty taste up front with a nice slight bittness on the back from the hops. This is a very well balanced beer.  M: Really smooth with medium body.  D: This is a personal favorite. I find it extremely drinkable due to its balance. I like to use this beer as a gateway to introducing friends to Rogue. This is a great beer and for me I often find myself comparing other ale's to this one for personal comparison and ranking. Enjoy! It's time for me to go open another one.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,JMad,4.03,"From a bottle to a pint glass... Looks copper / burnt orange, bubbly one finger head that left some good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, earthy hops, bready.

This is a great beer, very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,portia99,4.32,"22oz bottle of Yellowstone Ale (which it says is an alias for Dead Guy...I have no idea, so I'm going with it) poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.  A - Pours a sparkling, ""read a newspaper thru it clear"", amber with two fingers of fluffy cream colored foam that dies over the course of several minutes leaving behind thick spiderwebs of lacing on the glass.  S - Aroma consists of some green and grassy hops up front combined with some floral aromas. Rich caramel malt underneath along with some toffee and mild buttery/butterscotch to complement the sweet offerings here. The malt also layers in some bread and some cereal grains to round things out. Overall - smells rich and full.  T - Full malty flavors are at the forefront of this one. Caramel, toffee and malty sweet flavors abound. Hop presence is mild...I really don't detect much bitterness, seems like the hops are solely there to tame the malty heart of this beer and balance it nicely.  M - Medium bodied with a lower level carbonation that is really smooth and creamy. The malt lingers on the tongue after the swallow very nicely. Mouthfeel complements the flavors here nicely.  D - Well, I'm a Rogue fan but rarely buy any of their beer for some reason that I really can't explain. This bottle was gifted to me as a souvenir from a trip to Yellowstone. Glad it was...I haven't sampled this one in a really long time. It was one of the beers that got me going on craft beer many years ago...over the years, my pallette has changed and I prefer hoppier beers, but this one still hits the spot for me. The malty flavors and body that is achieved is quite good and the hops play off of this just about perfectly - never taking over and only serving to help show off the finer points of the malt. This is really smooth and I'm figuring this would go really well with something off the grill. Never thought of this as a Maibock before now, but surprising to me, this hits the style pretty well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SnowGoon99,3.55,Serving type: bottle into a Stella Artois glass  Pours a orange color with very little head. Aroma comes across very subdued due to the assumed low hopping and dominant maltiness. There are hints of floral in the nose when you really search for them.  Taste was similar to the smell in that it was nothing too special. Very malt dominated but that's to be expected in a maibock. Almost like a munich helles with a lot more alcohol. Body was good and the alcohol definitely came through when i tried to stand up after the tasting. Still a very drinkable beer though. Could have a couple of these but you'd end up falling down afterward.  Overall a decent beer but nothing too special. If someone handed me one i wouldn't refuse but on the same token i wouldn't buy it again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,prosper,3.76,"I'm generally a fan of Rogue.  Pours a dark yellow with a nice sticky white head that stays around a while. Very hazy (isn't this supposed to be a brilliantly clear style?).  Smells very nice. Sweet 'n malty dominates, some bubble-gum, and perhaps a whiff of floral hops.  Taste is nothing special. It's sticky sweet up front, and almost harshly bitter on the finish. Not too much flavour complexity, either, mainly just sweet malt - no real caramel, toast, hops, or anything else. Just green-grassy malty sweetness, finishing with a neutral hop bitterness. Not bad, but nothing special, either",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S: Definitely has a sweet aroma and the malt is easily detectable as well; overpower the mild hop aroma  T: This is my new favorite of the style. I love it because it's smooth, sweet, toasty and leaves more malt on the palate than hops.  M: I would say ""medium"" if I had to describe it. Is substantial enough that you can taste it and it lingers just long enough but doesn't overstay it's welcome. Can also taste the malt hints on your lips afterwards.  D: I could have 3-4 of these no problem. Truly interchangeable in that I could enjoy one (or more) during any season of the year. Malty and substantial enough for fall or winter yet light and drinkable enough for spring or summer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Arithmeticus,3.67,"A: copper, cloudy; moderate carbonation S: aromatic; sweet with a touch of apricot T: fruity (a touch of white grape); semisweet pale ale flavor; moderately hopped; very nice, dominating presence  Overall, a very good beer, perhaps not unique or outstanding, but worthwhile.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BBnum3,3.35,"My first review for BA!  Poured into a tumbler style pint glass.  Appearance: Nice orange/amber color. Somewhat cloudy. One finger head that diminished rather quickly. Healthy lacing.  Smell: Sweet and malty, with maybe a touch of hop fragrance, citrus-y.  Taste: Very similar to the smell. Really more of a sweet malt flavor than anything else, with just a hint of hops at the end. Not the most flavorful beer I've ever had.  Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth, low carbonation. I usually prefer more carbonation.  Drinkability: I can detect just the slightest amount of alcohol at the back end, which brings this category down a bit. Probably would not want to session this, but overall it goes down rather easy.  Overall not a bad beer, but not as flavorful as I was expecting. Would drink again if it was offered to me, but I probably wouldn't seek this out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,IPAescotch,3.44,"Roast malt scent, caramel. Carbonated and coffee like, with a bit of corn adjunct. Surprisingly similar to budweiser on that level. Still more complex of course, but i get the feeling they were going for a cheaper beer (and taste shows). A tad watery, medium hop bitterness, thin and pale mouthfeel. Probably a mix of pale/amber/dark malt for this brew. Easily drinkable, but this is not a complement. This beer could easily be much better, but i feel like it's integrity was compromised somewhere along the way",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,heebes,4.1,"Poured a medium to dark amber, thin head and not much retention. Looks deep and bold in colour.  Smells sweet, hint of fruits; citrus perhaps. Very inviting sense.  Taste is bold, hoppy in a way. Getting a hint of pine flavour.  Thin mouthfeel, not in a bad way. Lingering taste is favourable and smooth.  Considering I've picked up three 6 packs, this is certainly a beer I find myself returning to. Ease of drinkability was high, overall impression is high.

S- Caramelized sugar, some dried fruits, a bit of amber hoppiness, and some fresh baked challah bread, a little on the dull side.  T- Follows the nose, but comes through with a lot more intensity, leaves a nice 'beery' yeast aftertaste. Thick and confectionary, but with a smooth finish.  M- A bit sharp up front but very smooth on the backend.  D- Good, unoffensive, but a bit too boring to string many together.

The light coloration and the boozy flavor don't do much for me (especially at only 6.5 abv) but the taste is satisfactory for something called Dead Guy, and if you want to man up and down a jug, the abv is just right. Yar!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,FeloniousDrunk,4.05,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into a .5 liter beer stein. Wispy head that is a few cm at best, and a nice rich brown color that is amber on the outer edges of the glass and just a touch hazy.  Smell is malty and earthy at the same time. Faint caramel notes combine with hints of hops and pears to create a nice, subtle nose.  Taste is smooth with a sweet alcoholic bite to it, like sweet vermouth. Notes of maple syrup, oatmeal and pine nuts are the top flavors I get. This tastes like it's higher than 6.5 abv, but not in an overly harsh way.  The character of the mouthfeel is a nice balance between substantial and understated. When the beer is in your mouth, you know it's there, but when you swallow it goes down clean and smooth.  The well-balanced nature of this brew adds significantly to its drinkability, which I believe is fairly high. It's great tasting, but goes down easily, with no major characteristics standing out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,StarshipPoopers,4,"A - A clear and orange-copper colour with about a finger worth of white head that quickly settles down to a thin ring with a little bit of a film. Looks pleasant, nothing remarkable but still appealing.  S - Bready malt is certainly heavy in the smell. It is matched with a less strong but still very noticeable smell of hops. Other sweet notes include caramel.  T - The taste is a nice balance between the malt and hops. Initially the taste is of the malt with a slight hint of the hops. As it settles the hops become much more pronounced. A very faint and sweet citrus taste and the bready malt also becomes apparent in the aftertaste.  M - The mouthfeel is interesting. I like it. There is an ever so slight harshness to the taste that gets much more pronounced as the beer gets warmer. The sweetness of the malts is nicely balanced by the slight hoppy edge that is provided, and the sweet but subtle flavours of citrus and caramel add to the taste nicely.  D - Even though it's 6.6%ABV I would still consider this as a potential session beer. All in all it's a good beer with a nice balanced taste which struck a good compromise between favouring the malt flavour but still adding a nice edge of pronounced hops and subtle sweet flavours to the mix.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste: Sweet toasted malt up front followed by caramel and a hint of alcohol in the middle then floral and citrus hops at the finish. Aftertaste is mostly hoppy bitterness.

T- Pretty upfront malt flavor. Hops tone down the alcohol, but never near the malt presence. Has some kick to it, but remains smooth. A bit of caramel and bubblegum flavor. Great bittersweet aftertaste with many lingering flavors. A very impressive job on the malts in this one and it has a very elaborate flavor. It's just a bit too sweet/fruity tasting for me though.  M- Creamy and smooth. Carbonation is spot on.  D- Easy to drink and satiates your thirst quite well.

The head sticks to the sides of the glass in thick foamy chunks. Lacing from the body is very good to excellent as well. Great appearance.  S: Heavy malt contribution with nearly roasted malts of caramel, cereal, toffee and nuts. Light notes of pine resin hops.  T: Robust flavor given the style, with low [dark] fruity esters.

132,355,StephenRich,3.83,"Hazelnut Brown Nectar, XS Imperial IPA... Dead Guy Ale? What on earth is a Dead Guy Ale? Well, it just happens to be another award winning beer from the likes of theRogue Brewery in Oregon. Often people confuse it with an American Pale Ale, but it is actually a German style Maibock. A traditional German Maibock is a lager brewed to higher strengths and lagered (laid to rest in cool cellars) for three or more months. They are typically characterized by caramel sweet malt, medium to full body, medium hop aroma, but low hop bitterness. However, in typical west coast style, you should expect some bitter here.  Although the traditional style is a lager, Rogue's version is actually an ale, using their standard pacman yeast to brew it; which is an ale yeast. The Dead Guy was originally created in the early 90&#8242;s as a private tap sticker to celebrate the Mayan Day of the Dead. The design proved to be so popular that Rogue claimed it as the label for thier Maierbock ale.  This championship quality beer is often the one that coerces people out of a world of bland beers and into the beautiful reality of craft beer. I typically enjoy it richly in the summer when it is hot out, but it has more than enough flavor and depth to stand up to the coldest winter nights.  It has been brewed with four different malts, two hops, and hits the bottle at 6.5% abv. It is available at the LCBO in six packs of 355ml bottles, and also throughout the Unites States in 650ml larger bottles, as well as 64oz growlers at some locations. The Dead Guy will be best enjoyed cool around 10C (50F) offering fully quenching characteristics and smooth and creamy sensations.  The Dead Guy pours richly building a deep amber down beer. It is completely transparent with golden mahogany and oranges streaming though the wide array of carbonation pouring up from it. A nicely soft and mountainous white cream head forms a nice inch to two inches above the beer. Retention is reasonable, but it fades to a film within five minutes.  Steaming up from the now gorgeous pint glass are lush aromas of caramel malt and toffee. Thick buttery biscuit and floral hop notes lift spice and fruit into your nose. Honey, brown sugar, orange zest and fresh cut glass are all here showing delightful refreshing characteristics.  Don't sip the Dead Guy, he doesn't like it. Get right in there and enjoy this beer. Smooth and creamy malt sweetness flows over your tongue with an elegant and balanced mellow sweetness. Hop aromatics and bitter begin to pour in quickly also aiding the beer's balance and overall structure. Warm biscuit, melted butterscotch candy and the smell of fresh baked breads all show up in the cheeks and fill your palate.  It is really a mellow sweet beer with a lusciously creamy and smooth character. The balance comes from fresh and floral hops and a good amount of potent carbonation creating a supremely quenching beer. You would have no complaints with this beer on a hot summer day. The hops are quite nice showing lots of fresh flavors, citrus, a touch of pine and hay field too.  The mouthfeel is a succulent combination of creamy smooth malt and quenching hop carbonation; really perfect. It is easy to enjoy but full of deep and wide flavors making it an excellent beer for dinner. Spicy foods, anything off the grill, or deep tomato based pastas.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,glid02,4.05,Bottle from Meagan - thanks!  Pours a slightly hazy deep copper color with a one-finger cream-colored head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of lightly toasted malts with good amounts of sweeter caramel malts and hints of earthy hops.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Grainy caramel malts with good amounts of toastiness kick things off. Midway through the sip the sweetness fades just a bit with the addition of mild earthy hop flavors that carry through to a moderately bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a smooth thickness with grainy carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I didn't have a problem finishing my glass and could have another.  Overall this tasted much better from the bottle than it did on-tap. Nicely nuanced malt flavors and a nice mouthfeel make this one worth a shot.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Buschyfor3,3.69,"12oz draft at Old Chicago's  A: Golden amber body; quite clear on the pour; creamy off-white head about a finger and a half thick on the pour; sheet-like lacing.  S: Kind of buttery and bready on the nose; lots of malts as I expected; some caramel notes are there but are nicely balances by some dried, toasted grain/cracker notes and fresh baked wheat bread.  T: Huge maltiness through and through; buttery and nutty; some touches of caramel sweetness and some sweet cake like qualities; finish is slightly drying and brings out a touch of floral hop-like flavors before fading into butter toast flavors on the finish.  M: Somewhat creamy texture on the palate; pleasant carbonation.  D: Easy drinking at 6.5% ABV. Definitely one that is very enjoyable to have alongside a nice meal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,HBeezley,4.55,"By far, one of my favorite beers as of right now!  A - Looks absolutely beautiful. A slightly hazy orange and about a 1inch head that goes down, but retains and laces all through. It just looks so incredibly appetizing! s - Smells delicious. Malty and orange/citrus-y with a nice yeast or bread undertone. t - tastes great! Still malty but the hops come through to give that bitter kick! Little sweetness at the finish as well. m - Good. Light yet full bodied. goes down smoothly. d - Absolutely, one of the most drinkable brews I've had! There's a lot going on in that beer, but not overwhelmingly so. Makes you want another.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,btorsdog,4.3,"Used to be a favorite of mine a couple years back but just got bored with it I guess. Had one(ok 3)at lunch today, WOW, It was like finding a long lost friend! Served in a standard pint it was a slightly dirty golden amber, quite good looking. Smelled somewhat fruity, but mostly malty, bready. Taste was smooth and sweet just as I remembered a balancing slight bitterness brought me back to reality,simple but full in flavor. Mouthfeel is nicely pleasant, lays pefectly on the tongue allowing you to enjoy all the wonderfullness! Drinkability is stellar, could of stayed there and pounded all afternoon into evening. Picked some up on way home from work, will keep revisitng this old friend with more frequency I believe!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Bbloom1989,3.79,"Upon pouring this beer, a beautiful cascade of carbination formed a substantial head on this beer. The color is a golden amber that is just hazy enough to not allow clear sight through the brew. The head stayed full for quite a while and slowly faded off leaving behind delicate lacing. The smell of this beer gave of strong send of toasted malt and zesty citrus aromas. After my first taste of this beer, the citrus and bread qualities of this beer come to form. Its flavor is well developed and quite the oxymoron in that it is complex while keeping its simplicity. The toasted malt and sweet citrus make this beer quite drinkable, but if you savor this beer the malt and hop complexities truly take shape. A wonderful beer. I am looking forward to trying the other deal guy ales in this line.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerIsArTT,4.03,"12 oz. bottle purchased from On The Rocks, in Lawrence, KS.  I enjoyed this beer in my Jimi Hendrix pint glass.  A: Amber/Red w/ cream/orange lacing, one finger width head that appears creamy.  S: The aroma of fresh baked bread and mild orange zest, clean smell of grain, doesn't stand out as much as I'd like for something with this much flavor.  T: Rich floral maltiness with a light resiny dryness, very clean taste of fresh baked bread, followed by a mildly hoppy orange zest that is very well balanced.  M: Smooth, grainy maltiness that lingers on the palate with a light dryness that is sincerely enjoyable, the mild crisp feeling balances the maltiness very well in the finish.  D: Exceptional. I really enjoyed this brew's feel. The breadlike quality in the texture is clean and smooth. I hadn't had a Dead Guy in a long time, but after this, I know I'll be having another soon.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,PreacherBrewer,4.48,"A - Pours a deep honey color with a cotton hue head.  S - Smells of malt and freshly baked bread.  T - Big malt flavor balanced by a delicate hop profile. Very well balanced. Fresh bread crust is in there in a good way. It's quite like a bigger, maltier, munich!  M - Smooth, full and balanced as can be! Quite quaffable.  D - Damn. This may just have been the beer that I've been waiting for all my life. It's just made it into my top 10. With time and thought, it just might make top 5!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,blackc5,4.1,"This has become a go-to beer thanks to its availability in cases at Costco for cheap.  A - Slightly hazy gold with some orange tint. Average head. Good lacing.  S - Nice balance of malts and citrusy hops, with some fruit and honey.  T - Fairly straightforward, but very nicely balanced and clean. Light malts, apples, some caramel sweetness, and a good dose of earthy hops. Hint of alcohol pops through.  M - Medium body and carbonation. Fairly long bitter aftertaste, but not astrigent. Well done.  D - Especially given the price, the best selling point of this beer. Simple, yet complex enough to keep it interesting even at the end of a case.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,LairdChisholm,3.84,"ST - Bottle poured into glass.  A- Pours a coppery color but is a hazy orange in the glass with a light brown head.  S - Not a very strong order here. A slight hop and grass smell.  T- Interesting taste here. Starts and ends slightly bitter. Goes down smooth. Also, interesting notes on the finish. Notes of fruit. I cant quite put my finger on it, but I almost want to say banana is apparent. Over all a good brew.  M - What I like about this ale is that nothing is too over whelming with my sips. Goes down smooth with great balance.  D - Even through I really enjoy this ale, I don't have the desire to have one after the other.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste & Mouth - the beer has a nice mouthfeel, smooth and creamy with a nice amount of carbonation.

132,355,hangh,4.23,"Eerie hazy brown pour with this beer that leaves a somewhat fine light brown head and it looks like it is moving around. Pretty neat looking. Sweet malty smell, definitely caramel heavy but there are some sublte fruity smells underneath. Pretty vibrant and nice. Taste is great. Sweet caramel beginning leading to a bitter hop fruit finish, peach maybe. Overall great taste. Light bodied with medium carbonation. I think this is a great beer, a little out of my standard price range but I'll come back especially around Halloween.  One knock is that the bottle doesn't glow in the dark, I heard a rumor that it did and now I'm mad.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,darkmartin,3.89,Appearance: Pours to a caramel brown with a tan head that hangs around.  Smell: Smells fruity. Hoppy with slight fig undertones.  Taste: Complex and full-bodied. The subtle fruity tones are complimented by sweet malts. Alcohol is barely evident.  Mouthfeel: Clean and refreshing. Moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Excellent taste and clean mouthfeel make it very drinkable.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,stakem,3.41,"Review from notes taken 5/22/10  Poured from a bomber into a snifter it appears a perfectly clear orange color with a finger of fluffy head that retains well and sticks in patches about the glass. Aroma is a mixture of buttery notes, citrus hops, a bit of sulfur and quite grassy. Taste is grainy with earthy and herbal hops. The grain character is a bit sweet with a slight hint of the alcohol accents the hop bitterness. The feel is a bit watery and light with a modest amount of carbonation. There is a lingering presence of the hops left in the mouth. As it warms, the aroma takes on some notes of lemony citrus that can also be picked out in the flavor as well. Overall not bad but nothing to go out of your way for either.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,JohnWaynes44,3.81,"Poured an opaque dark orange. The cream colored head was soft froth that lingered and stuck to the glass. Smells like spicy wet grass and oak. Lots of flavors happening: Firstly, sweet malt and nutmeg, candied yams. Then comes the tingling hops, all the while the alcohol peaking through. The feel is the best category for me with this. It is sticky and smooth and leaves a bitter, dry funk on the tongue. I love to drink this beer. It is easy to find at my local Wal-Mart and is a go to when I want a balance of sorts.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S: sweet malt, a bit of honey and yeasty aromas.  T: slightly dry malt, some sweetness, a core of faintly funky yeast and fruitiness, finishes dry with just a tingle of hops. Nothing too fancy, but great balance.  M: Slightly oily/soapy, decent carbonation.  D: Very quaff-able. A good session brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,hylton44,3.97,"Actually didn't know the style of the beer when given one. Seemed a little Scotch Ale-like in its alcoholic content & overtone.

132,355,Gobzilla,4.08,"A: poured a murky orange brown with tangerine highlights that had a thin head and left a little sticky lacing.

T: caramel and a slight hop bite strike first with a sweet malty backbone which had citrus accents.

S- Hops, light malt, and after giving it a swirl, a very pleasant caramel aroma came out, very nice.  T- smooth, with a bitter finish (a good bitter), lots of hop flavor, perfect mix of malt in there too. to me this is not one of those beers where a random flavor like chocolate, pine, or citrus is present, it's just an all around good flavor. A great mix of malt and hops. The caramel aroma may be in there somewhere, but it's not popping out as much as it was in the aroma.  M- very nice, smooth, perfect carbonation, a bitter aftertaste in the mouth which is great in my opinion.  D- I will definitely buy this beer again. To me it's not a sipping beer, it COULD be, but it's also a great ""anytime"" beer. this is one you can just start drinking on at anytime whether it's a special occasion or just wanting to wind down at the end of the day.

S: Strong malty air with an obvious oak aroma with a very thin hoppy smell  T: Hoppy swallow, warm feeling of alcohol in the chest, long bittersweet aftertaste that makes you just want another sip. Hard to pick out any certain flavors, but it was definitely one that I'll keep coming back to.  M: there is a slight bite and the feeling sticks to your palate much too long, but all in all is a pleasantly delightful feeling all the same.

S: Pleasantly malty with a bit of oomph.  T: Tasty! Smooth and malty at first, before hops slide in and over the mouth, almost like oil, departing as they came. Aftertaste is pleasant, smooth, and lingering...but slightly soapy. Overall, an excellent brew!  M: Wonderful; see Taste.

F: Mirrors the aroma in pale malts and hops, but balance leans towards the hops. I thought this beer could be leaning towards a pale ale as far as style is concerned. Pale ale qualities with a slight astringency (husky/grainy).  M: High carbonation, medium bodied, and medium mouthfeel.  O: This was the first time I've had Dead Guy, and I found it to be true to style as far as a hoppier version of a traditional bock, but I didn't get the malt presence that the style calls for. At least not in this pint. I almost thought I was drinking a pale ale which is alright by me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Nice lace as well. Good looking brew.  Brew smells of malts; caramel. Grain and yeasts, pike up some citrus hops. Nice smelling brew.  Brew tastes smooth and has a nice balance of malts and hops. Citrus hops, bready, grain yeasts. Has a nice carbonation there as well. Malts are on the sweet side; caramel. Finishes slightly bitter and a tad dry. Very good taste.  This is a very drinkable, very tasty brew from Rogue. I had this on tap before and remember it being a bit more deeper and complex in the flavors. Maybe that is just tap brew being tap brew though. This is still very good though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Initially tastes of sweet, toasted, caramel malts, followed by a nice hop bitterness and grainy, bready yeasts leaves a somewhat dry finish.  Mouthfeel is medium with descent carbonation.

Probably a tad mild on the nose (3.5)  T - Slightly sweet malts with a dash of caramel greets upfront with citrusy fruity hops showing up right after leaving light hoppy bitterness on the palates.

132,355,drtth,4.1,"Served in a standard shaker glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a light copper color with a bit of chill haze and a ½"" off-white head that soon recedes to just a ring around the glass and a bit of foam on the surface of the liquid. Little or not lacing is left and throughout the beer sipping leaves little or no lacing.  Smell: The aroma is fresh and has some caramel and honey smell along some clean earthy/fruity hops in the background.  Taste: The flavors include some honey sweet caramel and some earthy bitterness. Where I think it departs from a traditional Maibock is that the bitterness is in the background from the very beginning.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied with faint carbonation. The finish is moderately long, begins with sweetness that stretches out for a while but then the beer ends mostly dry with some nice earthy hop bitterness.  Drinkability: This is a good beer for drinking with friends and for an evening of conversation and good company. It's easy to have another sip and its easy to have a second beer. I'll probably be buying this one again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Spice and earthy flavors at the start of this one, followed by some malty caramel sweetness at the back. Wet finish. No real lasting aftertaste, though it does leave a bit of a warm feeling in the back of the mouth.  This is my first foray into the maibock style, and thus don't know if this is representative of the style. It is a fairly interesting combination of flavors, though.

S: A bit light on the aroma for a maibock, but what aroma is present is that of a craft, with a deep caramel and honey scent. A very earthy aroma.  T: A spice on the front with a nice smooth and mellow finish. Earthy notes come through to the taste, showing a bite of the true bock nature, but bring it back nicely to the maibock style.  M: Crisp and clean. Weak on the lingering taste. With a short taste on the palate, this is what I am missing from this ale in regards to style.  D: Good beer and great style, but not the best. I come back to this brew but do enjoy other maibocks a bit more. Dead Guy does have a clean and drinkable tone to it. Nice and light, not thick and heavy on the way down, something I have found in other maibocks.

Smells of apple-like fruitiness and floral hops.  Tastes a bit tart and mostly floral hoppy, with some hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very mild sweetish malts round out the flavor.  Body is moderate with mild fizzy carbonation at the front. Goes down smooth.  Tasty enough, on the floral side of hoppy, just barely too strong to session, a good fall beer I would think. Would have again but I'm not crazy about it. That's more my preference in styles than the beer itself though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The aroma hints at a little bit of malty caramel sweetness, with a touch of fruit. Hops are certainly present, mainly due to the appearance of the head, but a little bit is picked up in the nose.  The mouth follows the nose on this one. A little bit of malty and fruity sweetness. The hops are enjoyable, and not too overwhelming. An interesting beer, but not sure if its one of my favorites.

It smells like it'd be sweet. Caramel is the dominant taste, with a mouthcoating, kind of velvety body that makes it quite easy-drinking. Full-flavored. The caramel is just short of being too strong (to the point of cloying) here. I can see this one as being very enjoyable to sip in cooler weather.

132,355,mmva321,4.57,"Perhaps the first beer I ever loved, now reviewing about 2 years later.  Poured into a pint glass.  A: The beer has two fingers of frothy off-white head. The head has a little retention and leaves a lacing that falls down the side of the glass rather quickly. The body is a murky brownish-amber color that thins out a little near the sides.  S: A delicate smell that emphasizes the smooth maltiness. What makes it special is the slight pop of hops that seems to creep up right above the blanket surface of the malts. There's also a hint of lemon.  T: A great interplay between the hops and malts. The beer is immediately bitter and strong, but the beer is not harsh in the least as it also is smooth and very easy to drink. Dead Guy sours on the strength of its hops, but it is also accented slightly by lemon and perhaps also some dried fruits.  M: The mouth feel seems a little watery and slightly carbonated, but it ends up being very appropriate as it doesn't add any extra strength to the very dry feel it leaves in your mouth.  D: At once challenging and also perfectly enjoyable. Its dryness and bitterness seemingly force you to take the beer slowly but this is perfectly offset but the smoothness and lightness that lets you purely enjoy it. Dead Guy is one of the best from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,philosobeer,4.27,"A beer I frequently come back to, and here is why:  A: A pretty, copper, and slightly clouded pour with a very nice head. This really does look pretty tasty in the glass. I would generally expect paler from a Maibock, but for this review I'm not judging quite as much by style. Explanation for that below.  S: Yep, those are noble hops, done right. The hoppy aroma is not the pine or citrus you generally get with american craft beer from the region. This has some spice on the nose. Some grass and a little clove also.  T: Ok, so we have a pretty clean taste here. The grain bill is probably a little off for maibock, but good. And once again, I'm not marking it down for that. Very noticeable hop character. Especially hoppy lager that lends its bitterness well. Oh, and there are some toasty notes that bring it together.  M: Clean, and though it's a little heavy for this sort of lager, it's still light enough to be well within range. Well done, definitely.  D: Drinkable, but not hugely so. It's not so refreshing you want to sit all may outside with a sandwich and a dead guy (beer). But it's often my first order at the local bar after a bike ride.  This has some peculiarities for the style, as far as I can tell, but I generally dismiss them. I can't get a straight answer from anybody if this is lagered like a traditional helles bock, or just an ale approximation. The taste is ambiguous there too, but I've tried to see if my palate would guide me. I'll leave it at they should keep doing what they're doing. If it's not a German Maibock, lets say it's an American Maibock. I'd like to see some brewers do as well in an approximation of styles like this. Bring on the American Maibocks.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,boss302,4.08,"Rogue Dead Guy Ale, Tap First, this beer claims to be a Maibock in style (a lager) but uses ale yeast and to me tastes like an ale.  A This is a brown amber beer, not clear. A nice fine bubble head that stuck around the whole glass.  S Not much hop aroma. A little malt and there ia a little piney aroma.  T Smooth malty taste with good hop balance. No over the top lingeing aftertaste.  M Medium body, a little alcohol warmth. A very well balanced beer. Carb and hop bite die quickly. A really good ale.  O. This is a good beer for folks that like real beer. The lack of clarity will frighten the cereal brew fans, but they would be missing a fine example of beer brewed the way it was intended; full flavored and hearty.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ScottyC,4.32,"Appearance: Opaque, warm orange/tan color  Smell: Nicely sweet -- smells like there will be a tang, which makes my mouth water. Slight fruit aroma (perhaps citrus with other sweet fruit scents).  Taste: Follows through on the nice aroma. Sweet for sure, but not overpoweringly so. Very well balanced between sweet and bitter. Has nice fruity notes like raisin. Aftertaste doesn't leave you reeling from bitterness. Finishes very clean on that raisiny/ruity taste. Overall, a rich flavor that's a standout.  Drinkability: It's got just a bit of tang, which I'm a sucker for. It's also got a clean aftertaste that keeps me coming back for more. Only downside may be that it's a bit strong/alcoholic.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jonnypopgun,4.11,"Poured into a dead guy branded glass, just for good measure. Possibly sacrificed the aroma a little here, but a fairly aggressive pour produced a good 1 1/2 finger white head that remained, albeit reduced to a couple of millimetres, for the duration.  Great deep amber colour. Didn't get much on the nose other than caramel maltiness and a hint of hops.  Wow, what a taste. I'm new to this style, will def be seeking out others. Sweet, creamy, fairly thick and malty, with some faint bitterness in the finish...and some citrus. Also detected some biscuity qualities.  Nice carbonation, not too heavy, but noticable. Noticably alcoholic, in the mouth and to a lesser extent on the nose. Overall this is really well balanced. Very drinkable for a beer with this ABV...DANGER!  Hared to get in UK, but will be making the effort to find more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jbowers56,3.95,"A decent off white head sits atop a cloudy orange/brown body. Not heaps of lacing, but alright head retention.  Too cold I think, but im getting some biscuity/caramel quality from the malts. Also get a nice citrus/spicy note from the hops, though not overly strong. Might edit this as it warms up. Edit: yeah, the flavour and nose get a little hoppier as it warms, a bit more spicy character.  Hmm, interesting. Flavour reminds me a little of a toned down doppelbock - perhaps just because of the german malt character? I dont drink heaps of German beers so this is a pretty noob review. Some light toffee flavours as, a pretty rich malt quality. Hop presence is not huge - though the bitterness serves to tidy up the malty sweetness. A little bit of hop flavour is there, but hard to perceive. Maybe an old bottle. Cant tell though - no freakin dates anywhere.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but the hop bitterness and crisp, yet understated carbonation serve to clean up any residual stickiness. I could drink a lot of these. A good session beer for those crazy high abv drinking yanks!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Nhoddus,4.45,"Found this first at the local Beverage Company, then again today I saw it in the corner store and decided to pick it up. First off, the bottle's logo is just rad. It's why it caught my eye in both stores in the first place. I gave it a fairly aggressive pour into a pilsner glass, and it didn't come up with too much head, maybe a finger or so. The first thing I noticed was it had very little visible carbonation, just a few tiny bubbles, and a gorgeous golden amber color. The smell is of malt, a slight touch of hops in the back, sweet bread and I catch almost a little carmel and brown sugar in there too. Some medium lacing on the way down. The mouth feel is real silky to me, not a whole lot of carbonation going on, so it lays easy on the tongue and with the smooth flavors, with just a slight hop bitterness at the end. It's real easy to drink, I could definitely see having a few of these in a sitting with friends, and feeling good at a 6.5 ABV with this drinkability. Good stuff.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Caramel is pronounced but not overwhelming.  Taste: Slightly more malt overall. Hops show up in the middle. Lingering finish is fairly bitter and a little alchoholic.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Slightly dry finish.  Drinkability: One is perfect, since it is a richer beer.  Overall: I love maibocks. This is a good beer. Would buy again, but not too often. I have had some better maibocks in various brewpubs, but this is still a great and enjoyable effort by Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,andyfrancis,3.88,"Reddish caramel color, just a bit of visible carbonation and a thick luscious beige head.  You can really smell the grain. sweet and sour notes. nice bouquet with a little agitation. Smelling more of the yeast as it warms.  Robust. Sweet and bready. Interesting flavor that's hard to pin down. Just one of those beers where you swallow, take a beat, and start nodding your head slowly.  You definitely know you're drinking something. It doesn't necessarily coat your palate, but it doesn't leave it clean either.  Pretty good beer though. I also recommend the John John if you can get your hands on it.

132,355,BlackHaddock,3.45,"On tap in Ales and Aces (Las Vegas).  A pint, served in a Sierra Nevada Celebration glass. The bar is dark and difficult to see in, but the beer looked a copper-amber colour, slight haze to it and a white head on top.  The nose was more malt than hop, with a caramel sweetness tempered with a spiced sourness.  The thoughts of sour caramel carried on into the taste and I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head. A faint hop bitterness came through, but otherwise I couldn't get past my thoughts.  Interesting, but I'd never have considered it a Maibock if it had been a blind tasting. Too weak in the mouthfeel for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Sweasty,4.15,"Dead Guy pours a nice rich copper color. Things are topped off by a good two fingers of bone white head. The head sticks around for a bit before eventually settling to a ring. It leaves a fair amount of lace in its wake.  The aroma is quite nice. Malt hits upfront. Some toasted and baked bread notes hit the nose first. That's backed up by some caramel notes. Some very light fruit notes, mangoes perhaps, come into play as well. Things are rounded out by a bit of a spicy noble hop quality.  The taste matches the nose nicely. Toasted malt notes hit first. Sweet baked and toasted bread notes are at the forefront. A bit of caramel and light toffee notes hit mid palate. Spicy and lightly earthy noble hops rounds things out. The finish is semi dry, with a lingering light hop bitterness.  Dead Guy Ale has a nice medium body. The carbonation is lightly spritzy and pleasant.  Is Dead Guy an ale or is it a lager? I think that question is moot. This beer has all the qualities of a great maibock, so we'll just leave it that.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

There's also a faint yeast smell, kind of like a biscuit.  T: Definitely a hop flavor right up front, not too strong, but enough to make it be the first thing you taste. The hop taste fairly quickly changes to that biscuit/yeasty/malty flavor smelled earlier.  M: Very crisp, fairly creamy with a bit of carbonation. Feels good in the mouth without having any particular element being too big. Overall very good.  D: The crispiness from earlier makes this quite an enjoyable beer to drink.

A: Poured a deep, amber-tinged golden yellow color with a thick, sudsy head of white foam which left a little bit of lace. Clarity is slightly muddled and carbonation is sparse.  S: A little bit of tropical fruit and floral aromas in the nose as well as some spicy hop flower notes and zesty, fresh grain bread.  T: Flavor is a bready, sweet caramel malt at first with a solid, milled grain husk taste. This is accentuated by sweet floral hop and fruity ale notes giving off pear, pineapple and a bit of citrus. Slight alcohol sting and a strong, viscous finish.  M: mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and pretty clean throughout. Slight alcohol and hop pinch but nothing to hinder drinkability.  D: A very solid drinking maibock. Nothing too out of the ordinary to be called truly delicious. But, it's a great brew and the 6.5% ABV doesn't hand out a boozy effect in the taste or feel. Would like to try on-tap to note variations in mouthfeel. A little more crisp and this brew could be really dangerous.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,BeerNemesis,3.73,"Dead Guy Ale | 650 ml. | 6.5% ABV  Style: Maibock / Helles Bock Brewed by: Rogue Ales Brewery, Oregon  Appearance: Poured into an Ommegang Witte glass. Clear amber in color, punctuated by visibly crisp carbonation. 1"" Head displays a very welcoming frothy, white pillow of foam. Head retention is ridiculous! It leaves cascades of foam down the side of the glass well after I've had the last sip.  Aroma: Bitter hop oils and honey. Refreshing!  Taste: Bitter, oily hops are both the first and the last taste. In fact, they are a bit too prominent, even for a Maibock. There's some grainy, sweet malt in the background, though this is swiftly cut off by the hop bitterness. The aftertaste is oily hops and light bread crust. The flavor is enjoyable, but it lacks complexity.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied. The carbonation is splendid throughout, but the hops are too oily. The drink feels like it's slipping through your mouth and you're missing out on flavor in the process.  Harmony: Lopsided with respect to the hops. They simple overshadow and suppress any sweet malt development. It's not that this isn't an enjoyable drink to quaff, but it does get less interesting with each sip.  Notes: This is a Maibock, the prototypical spring beverage. What's more, it is supposed to be consumed in May. As luck would have it, it's May 13!  No freshness date.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,dwilson01,3.88,"Poured from a 12oz into my arrogant bastard pint glass,  Orange copper color, unfiltered and hazy throughout the brew which gives it a nice glow. Solid 2 fingers of off white yellowish creamy head, leaves nice lacing on the glass as it dissipates, and is quite consistent.  Smells fairly hoppy, I get pine and a slight yeasty sourness, earthy malt, I guess a springtime forest describes the scent fairly well.  The taste is quite enjoyable, smooth and subtlety is added to the scent by a toasted sweet malted barley which is very much still in the fresh earthy garden type of flavor.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are probably my favorite characteristics about this brew, very smooth, goes down easy, and yet has just enough interesting flavor to keep you thinking about it.  Pretty good overall, worth trying for sure, it's like a more subtle sierra nevada pale ale combined with an american wheat like mothership wit. Less hop bittering, less wheat fruit notes are the product, but it retains a sweet malty body and enough hopping to keep you entertained.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The smell is floral and sweet. Strong nose of malty sugars and even some fruits (prunes?) in front of delicious citrus hops.  Taste/Drinkability/Mouthfeel: Taste matches the rich caramel and fruit smell. Very rich and well-balanced, however, with hops that compliment it well and are by no means overpowering. The mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side and leaves a solid coating. It has a moderate level of carbonation, although I certainly wouldn't want any less because I think this contributes to its drinkability.

Taste upfront is a nice malt sweetness, some fruit, and a nice hop presence in the end which seems to stand out a bit more as it warms. Overall a pretty well rounded and pleasing flavor.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, smooth and has a good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is pretty good. Its an easy drinking and flavorful brew for sure. Probably not a bad choice for a session beer. I had heard a lot about this beer and while I don't find it to be amazing, its still not bad.

132,355,Josievan,4.25,"Appearance: Dead Guy pours a muddy orange color. That sounds kind of gross, but it actually looks tasty. The head is the frothy, writhing one of a hoppy beer.  Smell: The aroma is of West Coast hops and hearty lager-type malt.  Taste: Surprisingly, this bottle tastes mellower than when I've had Dead Guy on tap, not quite as bitter. However, Dead Guy is still a punchy rascal. The beer is just hoppy enough to give hopheads a fix, while not scaring others away. The malt is playing a bigger role than in the draft version I'm accustomed to. This actually is almost sweet, in a caramel malt sort of way.  Mouthfeel: This Dead Guy is not as sharp and biting as I remember. It's crisp while retaining a relatively substantial body.  Drinkability: This bomber was shared three ways, and I find myself craving more. Here is a beer far from weak in flavor, but still pretty sessionable.  Notes: I've had Dead Guy on tap several times and enjoyed it every time. I liked this bottle even more, although this seemed almost like a different beer, as can be gathered from above.  I can't help but compare Dead Guy to its bourbon barrel-aged version, John John Ale, which I tried awhile back but haven't gotten around to reviewing. Regular Dead Guy is more easy-going and run-of-the-mill than John John, but arguably just as tasty. This statement is not meant to denigrade John John, but only to praise Dead Guy. Because my logic says that if a beer can even hold a candle to a bourbon-infused version of itself, it has to be pretty good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Mouthfeel: Very carbonated. Crisp and light texture, dissipates very quickly.  Drinkability: A little on the bitter side, has some bite to it as well because of the amount of hoppyness.

132,355,honeybrewer,3.34,"22 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a somewhat cloudy honey color with a creamy head that fades quickly but clings to the edge of the glass for a while. Smells of malt, citrus hops, and a hint of caramel. Good malt taste, and a stronger hop taste that I would have thought from the smell. The citrusy aspect of the hops, while it smells pleasantly enough, is perhaps just a little to sharp on the back of my tongue. Moderate carbontation, full bodied. This is a good enough beer, but over-priced and over-hyped. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, and probably not something I will buy again when I can get similar beers for half the price.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,cactusjuggalo,4.2,Ahh good old dead guy has been a fall back for me for many a year. Very malty and smooth as you would ecpect. Head sticks around for a little while with a nice toffee hue to it. The taste is bits of chocolate and caramel just a great sort of malty flavor. A solid beer could have one of these everyday.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dgilks,4,"Rich, malty aroma with caramel and a hint of chocolate. A touch of citrussy hop comes through as well. Lovely.  Moderately hazy, orange colour with a 1 finger, tight, creamy off white head. Decent head retention.  Lots of flavour here. A rich, thick malt body with moderately low bitterness but enough to balance. On the whole it is typically Rogue with the signature Pacman yeast and malt choices coming through. Notes of caramel, chocolate and a hint of citrus and earthy hop are great.  Full bodied with moderately high carbonation. Suitable.  A tasty beer to be sure. It has a sameness that is common to the Rogue beers but it isn't detrimental. Tasty.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jimhonnaker,4.27,"It is murky and dully golden. Its coloring is earthy and unassuming. It pours a creamy head that soon dissipates, but with considerable lacing. The aroma is of sweet, drying fruit and fresh barley; the smell is almost grassy. It greets the tongue with glutinous, uncomplicated sweetness. It quickly rolls of the tongue and morphs into an effervescent, somewhat piney hop bitterness. The beer finishes with creamy, toffee malt-sweetness and a hint of spiciness from the yeast.  The experience of drinking a Dead Guy adds up to be more complicated and important than an analysis of its parts. As a whole, it has a gravitas to it that I find strangely intimidating. The heaviness and thickness of the liquid, perhaps, account for this. I've probably had more than a hundred of these guys but each encounter is still memorable. That's no small thing.  My word for Dead Guy: solid. It's a reliable and always rewarding, readily available brew.  Consumed from a tulipesque Aventinus man-glass.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T- It tastes like...beer. Theres a bitter, sweet, sour feeling coming from this...its a really unique blend. I can't really put any specific flavor on it...but its interesting.  M- Very, very light. There is a good bit of carbonation, though. Its absolutely not too heavy...enjoy it.  D- Totally drinkable. I'm drinking this on a warm night, and its just so soothing and tasty in the warm air.

132,355,SpdKilz,3.97,"Appearance - Given to me in a normal pint glass with about a finger of head that quickly dissipates leaving little lacing on the side. I'll chalk this up to the bartender rather than the beer (I'm sure I would have achieved better head/lacing with a better pour). It is rather dim in the bar but holding it up to what light I can it appears a light brown, almost bronze color.  Smell - Very bready, floral notes, slight hops, and sweet malts.  Taste - Caramel up front followed by a heavy biscuit taste and some different fruits such as raisins,. Not as hoppy as I was expecting it to be but it lent itself to a nice, lighter, well balanced beer in my opinion.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation.  Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. I essentially quaffed this down while waiting to be seated and not intentionally. I just looked down at the glass and realized most of it was gone before I could slow myself down.

A little bit of fruit at the end. Stil the hops are the overwhelming quality.  Mouthfeel is thick and full. Lots of alcoholic warmth (I find it hard to believe this is only 6.5% alcohol).  Overall, this is ok. Probably the rating suffers from being compared to other Rogue beers. Maybe this is too hoppy for the style. Just a tinge less hops would have been better balanced to me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

About two fingers of off-white head developed and dissipated to a thin lacing with a ring around the edge.  Smell: Just like a dead guy, Dead Guy is very fragrant. Major honey and fruit sweetness tickles the nose, dominating the aroma. I can't pick up much else other than a hint of toasted caramel.  Taste: Follows the smell, though it's not as potent. Sweet honey, fruit (strawberry, or maybe pineapple), and toasted caramel malts.  Drinkability: It's not too complex, but it's tasty; it's a well-built beer. Very smooth.

Mouthfeel:  A bit warming mouth feel that goes down easy. The aftertaste will finish a bit dry and bitter but will not leave you thirsty.

T & M - NICE! The first thing that strikes me is how smooth this is. Then a full bodied texture laden with rich and complex flavor. Roasty toasty malt sweetness framed by a very subtle hoppy bitterness that lingers in the finish without being sour. This is fantastic balance. Mildly dark dried fruitiness shares the backbone with a malt flavor, and subtle but apparent notes of honey. An alcoholic warmth emanates from the top of my stomach, into and around my chest and lingers. A fantastic experience. Mild carbonation - just enough to keep from interfering with the flavor. There is also the suggestion of creaminess in the mouthfeel.  D - Between the flavor and the mouthfeel, the drinkability is fantastic.  I can easily see this beer becoming one of my ""go to"" beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

First taste that hits the palette is a big, sweet, caramel malty goodness. This is then matched with a bright, grassy, hop profile. The two tangle, and the caramel lingers toward the end, with a touch of hop bitters at the end. Some juicy fruit (pineapple?) in the middle, very delicate, but makes it's presence.

It's a nice amber color with a thick, but short lived head. Like the flavor its smell is balanced with caramel malts and terrific citrus esters. The hops are stronger on the palate than sensed by the nose, but much more subdued than an American IPA, for instance. I find this the most drinkable beer I've had so far. Dead Guy Ale may bore those who prefer a heavily hopped beer. The style confuses me; I would have called this an amber ale. So much to learn...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T - Much as described in taste category, but to elaborate; bittering hop flavor followed by a desirable malty balance.  M - Good mouth-feel, flavors subside and do not seem to linger for somewhat of a clean finish.  Overall - I like this beer and would definitely recommend it to everyone as a beer to be tasted.

The head dissipates slowly into an impressive soapy lacing that clings to the glass. The color is a medium amber, that is slightly lighter on the edges. This beer is translucent but slightly hazy perhaps suffering from a little bit of chill haze. Overall though the haziness of this beer indicates that is an ale to me.  Aroma: The aroma of this beer consists of toasted malt, very slight buttery biscuit caramel and a hint of sweet fruity esters.  Taste: The taste consists of slight toasted malt, some fruity esters and a small bit of diactyl.  Mouthfeel: The body of this beer is a little heavier then its actual lager version of a Maibock. Carbonation a thiner but makes for a creamier mouthfeel. There is little to no bitterness. but the beer does finish a bit dry.  Drinkability: This is an interesting beer, an ale brewed with the same ingredients as a maibock. Creating a similar flavor with some extra fruity esters. I think its a decent beer overall and a maker for a decent session ale. Its not all that complex, so its hard for me to get excited about though it is damn drinkable and there is very little wrong with this beer.

Light amber color, almost opaque.  S: Sweet, inviting.  T: Not too strong but has a decent, unique distinguishing taste. Has a small bite to it afterwards.  M: Very subtle carbonation. I would like to call this a thin beer but it's slightly thicker and has a presence on your tongue.  D: I could drink about two, maybe three of these before I would want to switch onto something else.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,FallinDeck,4.01,"Very malty aroma hit me as soon as I popped the top on this bad boy. An off white 2 finger head with big bubbles diminishes quickly leaving a perfect rind on the wall of the glass. The smell is like walking through the doors of a brewery. The wonderful malty smell hits you fallowed by a light hops. The body color is simply printed on the bottle ""Deep honey in color"" not any room to argue that one they're Dead on. Has a great full mouth feel, nice and chewy with tastes of wheat and honey... oh and don't forget a great balance of malts and hops.

Leaves behind spotty lacing. S: Toasted malts, nuts, and sweet spices. T: Light toasted malts, followed by figs, and apricot. Finishes with a smooth, bitter hop linger. M: Light on tongue.

132,355,PintOHops,4.12,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass.  A - Cloudy orange color with a 2-finger head, and great retention. I could only see a bit of Co2 through this beer, and lacing was minimal, wasn't great. Good look overall.  S - Dominantly sugary aroma, big candied ginger & date upfront, raisin and mild orange zests as well. Caramel/maple syrup notes as well, with mild spicy hop notes hiding behind the big candied/sugary aroma. Very inviting to me.  T - Tasted almost exactly like it smelled, extremely sugary/sweet malt like flavors. I got the candied ginger/date thing upfront & throughout, along with a butternut, cashew note towards the finish. Mild but definitely noticeable, lightly burnt hop bitterness on the finish which lingered nicely, as it warmed I got a bit of candied banana in there as well. Wonderfully sweet flavors going on!  M - The feel was creamy & chewy, smooth & extremely syrupy, and around full bodied with some lite Co2 bite. I really like the feel of this beer, it complimented the flavor profile perfectly!  D - I really enjoyed this beer, almost everything about it was very inviting to me, I could only enjoy about 2 pints of this though before it just became way to sweet. To me this was like an Imperial Amber, this is the first of the style for me though, and I loved it! This beer would go great with BBQ, and I can't wait to have it again! Highly recommended. Cheers!  NOTE - Mine may have been aged a year or more due to the fact that I bought it at a liquor store that doesn't move allot of it's craft beer quickly, and is known for stocking old beer to still make a profit.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Appearance: Medium amber color with decent clarity. Creamy, persistent white head.  Smell: Moderate hop aroma, lightly toasted. Almost reminds me of a Märzen. Hops have a bit of spiciness to them.  Flavor: Very hoppy up front with a bit of toastiness to them. Some spices, too. Fairly clean taste. Moderately dry finish with hop bitterness lingering in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and clean, and the hop bitterness isn't harsh lends this beer to having a few in one sitting.

It is the only beer I can think of that will appeal to the snobiest of beer-snobs, as well as the casual beer drinker.  It is so well balanced and crafted that there are layers of flavor, but nothing too overpowering.  I will say - I am currently drinking this on tap (from my kegerator). There is a huge difference in this beer when it is on tap or in a growler, compared to a 12 oz. bottle.  The bottles tend to be over carbonated and less balanced. If your store gives you the choice, pick up the Jug (Growler) instead of a six-pack and enjoy this beer the way it was meant to be enjoyed.  At $200 per keg - I probably won't be buying too many more kegs, but I will always buy the jug!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste: Well, I may have missed it in the aroma, but I noticed the hop flavor all the way through the beer. With that said, it's still crisp and surprisingly refreshing. It's quite good.  Mouthfeel: Has a fair body. Fuller than water but far from rich and creamy. It does it's job.  Drinkability: I thought this beer was quite good.

S: Sweet bready notes with a touch of fruit and a bit of hops. Also very sugary.  T: Quite a bit hoppy up front with a lasting bitterness. I have had this plenty enough times to know once it warms all the sticky sweet notes kick in so I will go ahead and bump it up.  M: Always felt like carbonation could be toned down a tad as once it sites it mellows out real nice.  D: I have drank more bombers of this stuff than I can remember. Very smooth and easy drinking.  Review is a bit short as I have had this beer many, many, many times. This is the beer that started it all for me. One sip and I was hooked. Over the course of a year this would be all that would drink or even look at til one day I became more curious and took home a SNPA.  People can complain about Rogues prices all they want to but I know I never have to worry about not being able to get my hands on this and it is an incredible jumping off point to craft beers.

Poured out of the bottle into a chilled glass, which has brought out some different qualities than I'm used to, so I figure I ought to put down a review.  A: Clear, dark honey colored brew. Light foamy head that clings nicely to the edges of the glass. Bubbly--good carbonation. S: Sweet malt and caramel tones. T: Slightly toasted malts, slightly sweet, slightly bitter hops. Subdued but a distinct and fully developed flavor. M: Medium bodied, good carbonation.

The smell is the most interesting part of the experience. Citrus and pine aromas from the hops come through and blend well with a maple sweetness.  Taste is somewhat spicy with an underlying hop bitterness and balanced with caramel and maple malt flavor. The beer finishes off with a sour aftertaste reminiscent of cough syrup, not one of its better attributes.  Medium to full-bodied and a fairly low level of carbonation. Bordering on a syrupy texture which sticks around long after you finish.  Overall, a descent brew. A lot of interesting flavors going on here.

I really want some more complexity here, but what I get is lightly toasted breadiness from the malt, with a bit of an unpleasant sour at the back of each sip for the first half of the beer. That sourness eventually fades during this session. M: Medium body and carbonation. Very smooth. D: I'm still a little confused as to this beer's style, and my attempt to place it is having an interesting effect on my reaction to the flavors.

A: Hazy leather brown with short-1/2 to 1 finger off-white head that disappears pretty quickly but leaves some admirable lace.  S: Caramel and herbal hops aromas are most prominent, but the nose overall is pretty mild and average.  T: Bready caramel notes couple with a sharp yeastiness to create a demi-tart character. Herbal hops finish it off. I have never been a big fan of Rogue's Pacman yeast -- but after Shakespeare Stout (which is excellent, especially on tap), this is my favorite Rogue brew.  M: Pretty supple and smooth with solid medium body. Carbonation is lively as expected. Aftertaste is biscuity and tart yeast.  D: A solid enough brew and I enjoyed it.

Not a lot on the palate. It's a good ale. I guess my expectations were too high. It's kind of hard to describe the taste of this ale. It's similar to the nose but subdued.  Medium bodied.

Nose: Strong sweetness. Smells of savory dried fruit and brown sugar, some nice hop aroma also.  Tongue: A strong toasty malt flavor hits the mouth first. Earthy, nutty, and sweet facets are also evident. This is very crisp despite the malty character. A very good amount of flavor complexity, and enough hops to make it very nicely balanced.  Mouth: Little carbonation, but it's still crisp light and savory. A small bitter aftertaste, but this does not overwhelm the palate.  Libation: A very well put together ale, almost perfectly balanced for the style. Very interesting savory & spicy flavors are well balanced with a small hop character.

132,355,biboergosum,3.97,"22oz bottle. Believe it or not, way back in the mid-90s, this was the only US micro, except for maybe Sam Adams, that was available in my fair burg, and was my intro to the broad spectrum that is craft brewing from our southern neighbours. The times, they have since a-changed, so let me take a stroll down memory lane. While there is indeed a marketing label spiel (Dare, Risk, Dream), it is of the weakest, lack of information sort, especially for this venerable, cheeky purveyor of west-coast suds.  This beer pours a cloudy medium apricot colour, with one finger of creamy light beige head, which leaves a thin curtain of droopy lace around the glass as it lazily recedes.  It smells of pale biscuity and thin caramel malt, musty orchard fruit, and a bit of citrusy and floral hops, with the slightest twinge of warming alcohol. The taste is lightly roasted fruit, of the pome sort (pear and apple), caramel malt, a rather understated bit of biscuit dryness, mildly edgy yeast, and floral, somewhat perfumed earthy hops.  The carbonation is fairly soft, the body tacitly smooth, and a placid medium weight, with a wee bit of creaminess. It finishes with more fruity malt, and perfume-tinged floral hops.  The prototypical new world Maibock, despite the confusing name, and with verily big malts, nicely cut with soft, but effective balancing fruity hops.

132,355,Minotaur,3.78,"Dead Guy has a medium amber, nutshell color with a thin head and medium carbonation. The head mostly clears around the edge of the pint glass as it warms.  The aromas is very light and floral-bitter hoppy. There is a little bit of malt sweetness in the scent, but it is extremely faint.  Dead Guy has a good flavor of light, slightly sweet, nutty warm malts with a considerable amount of bitter hops. There is no sourness or extreme of flavor which leaves the impression of considerable balance. It is a light tasting beer that has a clean, refreshing finish.  The mouthfeel is medium body with some toasty warmth of hop and malt that lingers on the tongue. I find the drinkability of Dead Guy to be its greatest quality. It is slightly too alcoholic to be a session beer but well satisfies the niche of a beer to drink with a variety of foods and in a variety of seasons.  It is not perhaps the most outstanding example of a maibock but it is very accessible and generally available.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Something about the smell to me is off-putting, and I can't quite place it. In any case, I'm getting some lightly roasted malt, and a hint of citrus hops. Taste follows suit, but the malt definitely dominates, with roasted flavors and amber malts coming through. Some nutty flavors too--hazelnut for one. A hint of hops pushes through, though they are minor. Feel is nothing special, pretty typical for an ale, though I guess slightly above average for creaminess. Drinkability would be higher if I could figure out what I don't like about the smell of this beer, there's just something I don't like. I've had it in bottles and have noticed the same thing.

One of the most pleasantly complex smells from a beer, IMHO.  T: Wheat and candy sugar with a mild nutty and buttery finish. Well balanced brew that is also a bit mysterious; I'm not sure if this a maibock, or a bock, a double bock, or a helles lager, but whatever Rogue's true intentions were, this is a damn fine brew.  M: Somewhat thin but well carbonated. The various flavors linger on the palate briefly, then disappear immediately, beckoning one for another sip.  D: This is a unique session brew that doesn't necessarily need to be poured into a glass; as far as I can tell there is nothing truly appealing about it's appearance, but the true testament of a good brew is it's taste and drinkability.

Really beautiful when held up to the light, with a great stark white soapy looking head, that leaves a decent ring of lace on the glass. It has a nose of sweet malt, citrus hop, some bread and yeast character and hints of coriander, maybe even some wheat notes. As usual the sweet malt strikes first, followed by some citrus and bread that converge into a floral hop taste with a minor bitter finish.

This is very visually appealing beer with a constant head and lace throughout that keeps it attractive till the end.

Flavor didn't seem as complex as the smell to me, but it was very smooth, and once again, very well balanced. Milk balls, caramel, apricot, the battle of supremacy between the malt and hops lasted far after the beer was only an aftertaste.

132,355,MikeBrandman,4.3,"A - Nothing too stunning about this transparent light brown beer. 1 finger of white head in my pint glass. No carbonation or lacing and the head disappears quickly.  S - Smell is strong hops and malts. I'm guessing noble hops by how strong the smell is.  T - Strong ""beer"" taste. Well balanced with a good amount of hop and spice kick. Dry finish and great taste even as we gets warm. Almost a fruity taste.  MF - Feels good on the tongue. Definitely full bodied. Very enjoyable and doesn't get too filling.  D - The taste makes me want more. Starts out a bit rough, but then grows on you. I wouldn't mind drinking 4 or more before going to something lighter.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The majority of the flavor is dominated by the bright and flowery hops with bountiful citrus, truly outstanding. Hints of honey in the aftertaste.

Side narrative notes dedication and a general brew description alongside food pairing symbols. Lacks an actual date of bottling or freshness. It neither shows IBUs or °Plato, or Alc. by vol.

T - Softly sweet and rather smooth malty range.  M - Pretty carbonated body on the medium to light side. There is a tiny hoppy bite at the end after the predominantly light malt structure, and on this serving also a sense of freshness.  D - It is very approachable, and while not my favorite makes for a great social brew, here with the packaging taking a prominent role.  Notes: Main notes reflect a similar experience than that of the bottle. However on this occasion It may be self-suggestion or the allure of the growler but it felt distinctively fresher and with richer taste than the bottle. Some of these half gallons look to have been collecting dust on the East Coast for a while in suspect places. This one was picked up from a reliable place and I'm fairly confident it is from this year.

Excellent with lighter foods or deep-fried foods. Quenching. I am not certain that if I was a monk and this was a meal-replacement ale, I would be totally satiated.

Color is a lovely amber, slightly darker than a deep luxurious gold but not at all orange. Very clear.  Aroma is caramel malt, sweet and, well, malty -- good amount of Munich malt in here I'd guess. Not much hop aroma comes through.  Taste is more balanced than the aroma -- rich malt paired with some hop bitterness and flavor. Bit of spicy character to the hopping. I think I would preferred this with a bit less hop character. Don't get me wrong -- I love hops, but the aroma & body set this up as to be more malt-centric than it was in the taste profile. Folks often describe it as an ale Maibock but the hops are APA in character.  Mouthfeel is very rich and full. One swish around the mouth and the beer foams up into a rich, thick beer. Quite nice.

As described in the beer style, you've got that citrus, tart hop aroma. The taste isn't overly bitter or sour. The beer has a nice medium body with flavors of citrus and sourness that hits the middle of your tongue nicely.

Smells a little more like an ale than a bock.  T - You can taste the alcohol just a bit. The taste starts with moderate sweetness and caramel undertones. Then it opens up with the slightly bitter and very fruity hoppiness. I was able to taste notes of apple, orange, and grapefruit. The finish is also bitter, but not overly bitter. You will also get the typical bock breadiness in the finish.  M - Medium-bodied, very smooth. The carbonation is very low. The beer coats your mouth quite well.  D - Good.

132,355,Reinheitsgebot71,3.93,"Listening to some death metal might as well slug back some dead guy.  This beer is promising right from the pour golden amber like a beautiful sunset. A nice frothy eggshell head takes its time to settle down atop the slightly opaque beer.  The nose is wonderful and very up front, dominated by sweet malt aromas. Rounding it all out are aromas of biscuits, golden raisins and a nice floral hop aroma.  The taste is malt malt malt. A fine toasty sweetness is right there from the beginning through to the lingering aftertaste. Balancing this out very well is a fine hop bitterness which cuts through what otherwise would be a very sweet tasting brew. Further down the road the malt taste takes on a flour like note. A slight warming natural alcohol note accompanies the hop bite at the end bringing a pleasant finish. Upon contact with the tongue a smooth, warm sensation flowed gently down my gullet, edges mildly roughened from the hop and alcohol presence.  A very fine beer indeed the one drawback being I couldn't see myself quaffing this in mass quantities. The almost overpowering malt would be a bit too much from my poor pallets sweet receptors after a while leaving my mouth feeling very dry.

Without this, the dry hops could take on the bitterness of an I.P.A, but Dead Guy is all about malts. They grace the entire palate, having the smooth sweetness of honey hiding citric subtleties that are picked up on the edges of the tongue.  It's tightly carbonated with a strong, crisp finish. I wouldn't change a thing in this department, it's a needed kick that cuts through a thick texture. Well balanced and has a sticky body, a staining aftertaste.

A hazy reddish gold pour to copper-brown with thinnish white head, but lace that sticks about. The aroma advertises the floral-piney hops more than the nice roast malts that balance it.

A very faint bitterness comes through on the finish, as well.  Mouthfeel is light to medium-bodied. A crisp carbonation keeps things interesting.  Very drinkable for 6.5%.

132,355,TheHammer,2.57,"Got this one in a trade with Ludachris, I've heard this beer got a lot of people on board to the craft scene, so I'm eager to see.  Appearance: Well points of clairity, that is for sure as the body boasts a luxuriously clear light bronze that seems decently carbonated. However the head leaves quite a bit to be desired as barely a pinky made a presence and it did not lace nor sustain.  Smell: A nice blend of honey and malt with a slight touch of spruce like hops. Light notes of caramel as well grace it, which would score much higher if it wasn't so faint and required quite a bit of warming.  Taste: Well it does start very nicely with a good blend of sweet honey and malts with the barest floral taste. As the beer continues though light citrus hops assert themselves and combine at the very end with floral and spruce like elements that cause the beer to end with an unbalanced kick of bitterness. I'd give it a 2.75 if I could to be honest, but I gotta go with the lower end of things here.  Mouthfeel: I really dislike it when a beer is lacking in head, however this isn't the only problem here. The unbalanced kick of hop bitterness really doesn't do me any favours. The light hop aftertaste is a mixed bag that leaves the front of my tongue happy, but the back of it revolted. Carbonation is good, but I wish it didn't accent the end so much.  Drinkability: I find this slightly bellow average. The hopping and mouthfeel certainly don't do it any favors and my stomach isn't completely agreeing with it. However, it does go down better then I though it would and it's not completely absent in the refreshment department.  Final Thoughts: Given the only Maibock I've had before was Holsten, I'm quite disappointed by this beer. I was expecting a lot more diversity out of this and frankly, if the hop presence wasn't so varied this beer would be abysmal. I'm guessing this beer is rated so high is because it probably made a lot of people realize that they are hop heads. That doesn't do it for me though, for me a beer needs balance which this beer is in need of.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A-Pours a gorgeous light amber hue with a full two finger foamy head that receded into an attractive, sticky lace down the glass.  S-Slight malt sweetness with a bit of piney and citrusy hops. Overall, the aroma was too faint.  T-Sweet malts dominate the taste profile with a nice, but not overpowering hop bitterness in the finish.  M-Very nice, and refreshing.  D-This is one of the better Rogue beers I have had and would gladly drink again. Won't buy with any regularity since priced higher than other beers I like better. It was the best choice among bottled beers at a restaurant this summer, and will find similar use in my future.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WeedKing4,3.51,"Pours a clear orange amber, with the slightest of haze. The flavour is pretty bland to be honest, a little sweet, not shitty, but nothing stands out either. The after taste is a little annoying in this beer. Don't notice the 6.6% at all, so its easy to drink. This just doesn't have any personality. Very average beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,damndirtyape,3.91,"Poured a 22 oz bottle into a pilsener glass and a tumbler (half for me, half for the Mrs.) with dinner. In both glasses a nice honey orange amber color, just a hint of haze, with bubbles constantly coming up in the glass. In the tumbler not much of a foam, but in the pilsener glass a thick foam that died down slowly to 1/8"" as I drank it down (and stayed there) with thick walls of lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell is faint, even right after pouring. It's not strong - some malt and some hops. Nothing really leaps out at me - not bad, but nothing really good either. Towards the end of the glass as the beer has warmed up some of the hops is a little more present, but again, it is faint.  Taste is pretty good - smooth malts up front followed by a bitter finish. The bitterness is really just right. It's a crisp sort of ""aaah"" bitterness that finishes the drink but doesn't dominate.  Mouthfeel is a little thick, carbonation does not linger on the tongue, and it goes down smoothly. This combined with that crisp end makes it enjoyable which leads into drinkability.  Drinkability - had I not split this beer with someone else I definitely could have finished the whole thing myself. A nice balanced beer that is very refreshing and a good choice with a meal. I'll have to try it again and see if I think more of it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,apbarwood,3.88,"A pale hazy orange with a rocky white head and an adequate amount of lace. I found the aroma to be the weak link in this one, a bit underwhelming but not at least slightly better than average hoppy citrus aroma. The flavor leads with a balanced citrus hop attack that finds a nice medium between sweet orange and a drier grapefruit. This is followed by a sugar cookie maltiness in the middle that evolves into a slight sweetness before finishing with a dry hop note. I felt like the alcohol peeked its head out just slightly but I had to try hard to pick it up. Light and refreshing on the palate and representing a wide range of flavors. This one goes down easy and shows a nice complexity and though it's a little high on the ABV it might make a good session beer. Certainly one of the best I've had of it's kind.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Grunewald,4.25,"A - poured from a 650ml bottle into a pint glass. It pours a hazy and very dark amber. The head is white and leaves spotty lacing.  S - yeasty scent (brie cheese), strawberry jam and ripe cantaloupe  T - lively malt, butterscotch and light fruit flavors. The sweetness of these flavors carries well into the astringent hops.  M - medium body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish  D - the smell and taste is great, especially the way it presents fruit and hop flavors. I could drink many of these on their own, but they would be even better with finger foods.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Excellent retention and leaves sheets of lacing. Great looking beer.  Sweet smell of toasted malts, biscuit, and a mouth-watering orange zest with some spice in the middle.  Taste a little subdued compared to the smell. Smooth, rich toasted malts and biscuit followed by some orange, grapefruit and a clean kick of herbal hops that lingers.  Mouthfeel is clean, creamy and smooth. Nicely balanced and easily drinkable.  Every Rogue product I have makes me love the company that much more.

132,355,BDJake,4.18,"Also served at the Yard House in Waikiki, medium hazy amber in color with a thick head. Had a nice biscuity scent with a decent amount of hop spice, not very strong but pleasant. Toasted malt and barley, with some floral notes emerging as a resuly of the hops, becoming richer as it warmed up. Medium body with moderate carbonation, adding to the overall flavor at all stages, and went down extremely smooth for a beer of this complexity. Might be a little strong to be considered sessionable my many standards, but nonetheless equally enjoyable in both complexity and drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ditch,4.33,"This is a session drinker!  Pours a hazy orange amber with a 2 finger head. Lacing is pretty clingy and thick.  Smell is of sweet barley and hops. Well balanced aroma. Slightly spicy.  Taste is spot on my definition of ALE! Barley and hops are in perfect unison here. Not too much of either, and not too little. Sweet roasted, nutty barley and floral citrusy hops.  Mouthfeel is excellent! Getting the slight tingle from the bitterness and the slight thickness from the extra amounts of grains in here. Carbonation compliments both.  Drinkability is perfect. This is an all niter here!  I'm still relatively new to the craft beer universe, but this and Dogfish's 60 min IPA are my favorites! These are my gotos when I'm at the bar.

132,355,LittleCreature,3.85,"Appearance - 4.0 Pours two centimetres of bubbly off-white to beige head over a hazy amber-orange body. Good head retention and very little lace.  Smell - 4.0 Strong, sweet and complex aroma of biscuity malt, caramel, orange zest and slightly spicy hops.  Taste - 4.0 A very tasty American take on a German style strong lager. Big malt backbone tastes of biscuit, toast and a little caramel. The main American difference is the hops; bitterness is considerable, citrus and earthy flavour likewise. Finishes very dry, overall balance is in favour of hops.  Mouthfeel - 3.5 Medium to full bodied, moderately carbonated, quite thick, almost syrupy in the mouth.  Drinkability - 3.5 Not as easy drinking as a traditional Maibock, but definitely a beer I would come back to.  OVERALL - 3.9 Should be called Dead Guy Lager, seeing as Maibock is actually a lager style beer. Oh well. It is an interesting American twist on a traditional German style that comes off quite well. A lot more hop aroma and flavour than a traditional Maibock, and a little more bitterness. A very good beer that I would be happy to drink again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

(having after a liberty ale, which was apparently a good set up for the dead guy). sometimes this beer strikes me as too alcoholic and toasty, and not smooth enough. tonight i'm not sensing those qualities in excess.  pretty smooth and medium full, a bit of prickly carbonation up front  even on dead guy's good nights, i don't want more than one or anxiously anticipate the next time i might pop one. yet it is enjoyable now and then.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell: Hoppy with slight floral scents, some nice toasted malt in the aroma as well.  Taste: Floral and citrus hops up front with a nice blend of malts in the mix. The hops add a nice crisp finish with a little hops bitterness on the tongue.  Mouth Feel: Medium bodied with good carbonation that leaves a very clean and crisp feel on the tongue.

132,355,SkunkWorks,3.87,"Bottle poured into pint glass. Nice orange and copper color. Nice head formation but it dissipates very, very quickly. The aroma is slightly sweet and hoppy. The beer tastes distinctly fruity with a slight raisin taste to it and it reminded me a lot of DFH's Raison D'Etre though much more pleasant. Overall, was an okay brew but probably would not have again.  EDIT  Ok, so its been pretty much exactly one year since I last had this. I've learned a little bit more about reviewing and have developed my palate a little bit so I thought it was time to start revisiting some of the beers that I have a real big rDev with. I'm starting with Dead Guy. Its a good place to start since my review was stupid (keeping it up as a reminder to myself) and my palate was clearly not ready for very much yet. However, this remains the only Maibock I've had to date so you still should take this review for what its worth.  12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Look: orange-amber, copper color. I had it in a restaurant that was poorly lit but I did the best I could to establish the color by holding it near light sources. Carbonation is very thick. In the light of the place, the color combined with the carbonation makes this look a little syrupy. Strange way to describe it but that's the best I've got! The egg shell head is very thin and dissipates very quickly. There's some sheet lacing left behind.  Smell: it smells very sweet. Its slightly caramel with some fruitiness from the hops. Very subdued aroma.  Taste: caramel like malt dominates. There's some fruitiness from the hops but again, its fairly subdued like in the nose. For a beer that is only 6.5% ABV, the alcohol is apparent even if its not overbearing. That is probably what I didn't like about it back in the day. There's some toasted bread like tastes to it as well. There's some spiciness but its not very bold. The tastes in general are all kind of subdued.  Feel: medium bodied and crisp from the carbonation. Not much bitterness. Some slight bite from the alcohol as it warms but nothing extreme.  Drink: could be sessioned if you wanted to go that route. Its fairly easy drinking.  Overall, not the greatest beer in the world but its certainly well crafted. I'm glad that I chose to go back to this one. Its an interesting experience to drink this again because I thought I could remember exactly how it tasted back when I first had it and this tastes nothing at all alike. Its a fun exercise in looking at your palate! I dunno if I'll reach for this again but it does give me incentive to try and search out Double Dead Guy.

132,355,Mavajo,4.21,"Interesting that this is labeled as a maibock - wouldn't have known that. Had it pegged as an American Amber. Anyway...  Pours a cloudy orange color with a decent head. Moderate lacing here. There's not much going on with the nose here - I had to really bury my nose in there to get the smell of malt and light hops. Taste is immediately of that maltiness, but there's a slight hoppiness at the end. Nothing dramatic going on here, but an interesting taste none the less. Mouthfeel is fairly medium with moderate carbonation - however, there's a very silky feeling to this beer. It just carasses the tongue. Doesn't leave any sort of negative aftertaste.  Drinkability is great. Very easy on the tastebuds. There's just enough hints of hoppiness here to keep it from being boring.

Poured from the bottle into a weizen glass, let it warm out of the fridge for 10-15 minutes  A-a rich golden brown hue with hints of red and a fluffy cream color 1 finger head with sticky lacing.  S-subtle but nice, i can barely make out a fruity scent, toasty malts and a very slight hop scent comes thru once it warms up a bit; the scents are there but the aroma is fairly weak for such an effervecent drink but still a nice sensation.  T-taste is a very well blended variety of roasted malts and spiced hops, finishes a bit dry with a slight spice flavor, once it makes its way down, it gives a slight warming feel, very pleasant to drink.  Mouthfeel is medium with a nice refreshing feeling once its down followed by the subtle wamrth, a very comforting ale for the fall season in my opinion.

Fresh grains and hops dominate with a bready smell. Nice, and makes me want some pizza.  The sweet malts lead the charge in this flavorful beer. They are joined simultaneously by a light bitter hop and another round of sweet malt in the finish. A little sweet/hoppy dryness lingers and invites another sip.  This beer is almost perfectly balanced in the mouth. The creamines and carbonation work together perfectly. I love the way this feels. Not too heavy, not too light.  This beer is very drinkable.

Sweet caramel notes keep the hops from getting too harsh. The taste is also very hoppy, though it comes off more spicy than citrus or piney.

132,355,MikeInIowa,4,"Look: Nice overall look to this ale as it pours reddish amber from the tap with the skeleton on the tap handle. This ale has average suds with regards to depth and retention, but without lacing the glass (and just as a sidebar here: many bartenders still pour down the side of the glass to intention reduce the foam, and thus, I will amend the above statements regarding this ale's head should I discover a difference between the draft version and the brown bomber version of Dead Guy Ale (DGA).  Nose: It has such a light aroma. Clearly the olfactory is not overpowered by supercharged malts. I feel the subtlety of these whaffs adds to its appeal  Taste: Light hops and malts grace the fore-pallate with the initial sip, but the tastebuds detect a subtle nuttiness and perhaps a hint of berry flavor as the fluid passes into the oropharynx at the posterior of the oral cavity. I was pleasantly surprised to note that, despite the inferred severity of something entitled Dead Guy Ale, the aftertaste was not at all bitter. DGA probably has a low IBU rating.  Mouth: DGA possesses a thin yet inviting mouthfeel.  Drink: DGA is an easily imbibed beverage despite the imposing figure of a rotting corpse on the tap handle. Nope, nothing rotten here. Although DGA is not exactly TDF (to die for), it is likely to cater to a whole new generation of Dead Heads.  with respect for beer, MikeInIowa",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,schmitter,3.96,"Oooohhh weee now this is a maibock!  Poured a deep, hazy amber with an off white sticky head.  Smelled somewhat fruity and malty.  Taste was also fruity but probably the best malty beer taste I've encountered. Hops are there, perfectly blended with the rich malts.  This is the first beer I've given a 5 for drinkability and the best helles I've had.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

There is some caramel and overall malt sweetness to it. Very smooth.  T: Much hoppier than I expected. Opens up with the malt sweetness. Then it's all about the fruits but this time more of orange zest than the rest. Some tart too. Green tea is stronger while the peach and banana are near non existent. Some herbal hops that brought the tea cuts it at the end.  M: Very creamy, to my surprise. Carbonation level is perfect.  D: Very drinkable.

Slight hoppiness to the nose with a mild sweetness. This is a very smooth beer; taste consists of hops with a slight herbal bitterness as an after note.

Initial pour yielded a 1 finger head that quickly dissipated with minimal lacing. Moderately carbonated.  Smell - All around good. Noting really specific but smelled kind of sweet. Hint of hops.  Taste - The hops really came through on this one but not overbearing. The taste is kind of ""in your face"". Kind of malty and sweet with hints of fruit. The alcohol did come through.  Mouthfeel - Being an ale, it was kind of heavy, I was surprised. The carbonation did have a ""bite"".  Drinkability - This isn't for a novice beer drinker who constantly drinks ""lager"".

This beer reminds me of Two Hearted, but without the bitterness.  M- Medium bodied beer with an average amount of carbonation. Fits well with the taste.

Smells of roasted malt, spices, hops and a little fruit. The taste is a slightly sweet, toasty bread, very slightly bitter combination that is very pleasant. The amount of carbonation is nearly perfect and complements the taste giving the overall mouthfeel that I like in a beer.

The smell that first comes to mind is honey or caramel. Something very sweet. There is also a very heavy malt smell, almost like the malt extract you can get in cans at the homebrew shop. No real hop smell is present.  The taste is a very sweet, malty brew with a bit of a dry citrus finish. Mostly I taste a lot of sweet malt, caramel or brown sugar along with that tangy honey taste I smelled. Not a bad beer by any means, but its definitely not the best that Rogue makes but I am sure the label sells this beer more than the liquid inside (a la Fat Tire).  Very drinkable, and all that, but its got a bit of a cloying sweetness that stays with you.

132,355,ocelot2500,4.13,"Pours a clear amber color with a tight white head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass.  Smell is mostly of toasted malts and some sweetness.  Taste is the toasted malt flavor balanced out by a hop spiciness that ends with a slight bitter taste. Alcohol is noticeable, especially at 6.5% ABV, but it does not detract from any of the flavors.  Mouthfeel is a smooth medium body with enough carbonation to leave a dryer finish.  This is very drinkable as it is a balanced beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeanBone,3.83,"Appearance: A slightly hazy, golden-amber body capped by two fingers of creamy, off-white head that endures well and leaves good lacing.  Aroma: Lots of toasty caramel malt with a dash of spicy hops.  Taste: The focus here is really the bold and toasty caramel malt backbone, which is spot-on for the style. Towards the end a mild alcohol character emerges, about equal to what you'd expect to find in a Bock. It finishes with earthy and subtlety spicy hops that help to dry everything out.  Mouthfeel: A medium, slightly creamy body that features moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Just shy of session territory, but still very drinkable.  Verdict: Dead Guy is a tasty and very drinkable beer with lots of character, but falls short of being exceptional. A worthy flagship brew for one of the bigger American microbreweries.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Poured 12oz. out of bottle into Rogue pint glass. Amber in color, I didn't remember what it smelled like, but the one I poured had almost no aroma at all.

A - Pours a rich golden color with a pinky of off-white head. Drops to a bubbly cap with some lacing.  S - Heavy malt sweetness. Candied tropical fruit quality with a touch of hop spice for balance. Quite appealing, really.  T - Complex, sweet malty taste. Somewhat citrusy. Hop spice comes through on the swallow, and the finish offers a slightly dry, balancing bitterness.  M - Light (though not watery) body and moderate carbonation lend some crispness to the brew. A bit of warming alcohol at the back of the throat after half a bottle or so.  D - Overall, a solid beer. To me, this is much more balanced and drinkable than traditional bocks that focus more heavily on malt depth, which results in a really sweet, syrupy brew. I'd drink this again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Hops are present but not in the forefront. Notes of black tea and a smooth, dry finish.  M: Smooth and dry.  D: This was the first of a six-pack i don't think i'll have any difficulty drinking the other five. Smooth and enjoyable to drink.

Good lacing down the glass. A very good looking beer.  S - Pick up some sweet malt right away. Other than that, not much.  T - Pick up the sweet malt first, then the hops. A little caramel. Finishes dry.  M - Feels good. Nothing too bitter. A pleasant dry finish.  D - Nothing overpowering, goes down very smooth. Could easily have a couple more.  Overall, a good beer.

Some light hops and a sweet nutty caramel character on the nose. Hint of carob and toasted bread. All nice characters. Not extreme but pleasant.  Taste is more robust, a very nice clean bitterness, with a lingering grain and nut character leaving some nice sweetness on the back. It's very clean and crisp, puts me in mind of a ESB, and has the pleasant gritty hops to match. Mouthfeel has a nice slickness.  A very drinkable ale and most enjoyable.

Just the head receding is leaving a thick ring of sticky, chunky lace around the top of the glass.  Nose is sweet malt with hints of caramel, dark fruit, and a slight earthiness. A few sips in and the earthiness picks up, making for a nicely balanced beer. Flavor follows the nose, but it's not as rich as the nose would indicate. Light caramel, dark fruit, and an earthy slightly bitter fade. Very short finish.  Light bodied and smooth, with light carbonation. Immensely drinkable. On the whole I'm having a difficult time finding a lot to say about this beer, but the fact that I can't seem to come up with anything particularly negative seems to say a lot.

Lacing is spectacular and thick. Looks so damn fine.  Smell is delicious and fruity, with a big fresh pineapple hit and some excellent floral hops, plus hints of darker, sweeter fruits, maybe some dried apricot and some golden syrup. Complex, flagrant and pleasant nose.  Taste is quite a lot earthier, with a strong, dank hop that pervades most of the palate. Rich citrus-style flavours - cumquat and maybe some mandarin, with a thick, syrupy barley malt underneath on the front; floral, citric hops come through on the mid and then develop a wetter, more soily bitterness towards the back. This is blended with a sultana sweetness on the finish, quite splendidly actually. In fact, finish is really great - some licorice spice and an excellent warming alcomohol kick.  Mouthfeel nicely full and rich, almost chewy towards the end. A little bit intense on the mid overall, but that's otherwise a very pleasant beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell is subdued but is primarily malt and some dark fruit.  Taste is sweet malt and biscuit. A little chewy in the middle with a fairly crisp finish.  Mouthfeel is a little heavy with a lot of carbonation.  Drinkability is ok - but this is probably not something I would seek out.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Strong pour conjures up a 1/2 inch of bone white head. Retention is minimal and quickly fades to a scant patchy white skim. Imparts a nice lace around the glass. Color is a clear golden amber tinged with orange.  Nose- Light caramel, not much else going on.  Taste- A very clean and light caramel nuttiness, some bread and biscuit notes. Light citric and herbal notes in the close. Faintly tart and lightly dry in the finish. Very clean and pleasant ale. Nothing exotic, but very well executed and pleasant to drink.

Smell- Smells of Chocolate, raisins, and red fruit pervade, speaking of the malty goodness to come. Light hints of nutmeg round out the aroma.  Taste- Malt Pervades with sweet Caramel overtones as well as expresso notes giving a balancing bitterness.  Mouthfeel- Longlasting and carbomated but pleasing.  Drinkability- Very easy to drink, 3 to 4 easy.  Finally a rogue beer that isn't an overhopped nightmare! I can see me getting more of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Sweet and yeasty aromas become apparent. Taste is fruity and zesty hops balanced with a dryly malted aftertaste. There's a peppery hop spiciness that nicely compliments the malty flavours and floral aromas. Lots of bite! The mouthfeel is crisp and velvety upfront; perfectly bitter and dry in the finish. Well balanced. Another fine ale from Rogue, with more of a malt profile than most of their beers. The tangy flavours would pair well with spicy food or creamy dishes like clam chowder.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Sweet, fruity malt nose with a heavy dose of citrus and honey. Heavy malt & hop presence, with an alcoholic front. Sweet with a pear/apricot fruitiness and lacquered honey. Yeast is quite pronounced and comes together with the hops for a somewhat dry finish. Interesting and complex in the mouth, while maintaining its crispness.

I poured a nice, fat white head that dissipated pretty slowly, leaving some patches of lacing on the glass. The aroma seems like a nice balance of raw hops and fresh malts with some fruits, possibly citrus but something a little sweeter as well. A nice, level hops bitterness blends with a rich, toasted malt adding hints of caramel and great balance. Some fruits are underneath and it's got a nice sweetness to it that isn't too much. There's some grains element to it in the back and the finish is fairly dry with a toastiness to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and some moderate carbonation makes for respectable crispness as well.

But the Dead Guy is the one. I think that it is the best beer to give to you up and coming beer buddies to educate them on a bock style beer...

It's pretty sweet as well, not to much bitterness. Definitely a great taste.

S =mild and subtle, but present are hops, roasted coffee and not much alcohol smell. Grains are present but not overpowering.  T = Very nice resins and bitterness, hints of cocoa and roasted coffee. Enjoyable but not overpowering hops present. The barley is quite enjoyable, but kept in check by the other flavors.  M = The body of this beer is entirely appropriate to the taste. It carries the flavors to the entire palate, and is so thick that it saturates the tastebuds. Finish is clean, with a slight bitterness and tingle left by the bubbles.  D = This one I could definitely drink more than a few of in a session. I would love to have it with a more delicate cut of steak such as New York strip or tenderloin.

132,355,cybermecium,4.1,"Poured from a 22oz bomber bottle, after being chilled to 55 degrees (in a small wine fridge), into a room temperature whisky tumbler. Small red icons of a pig and a campfire on the bottle, presumably to indicate that this beer would pair well with barbecued pork.  This is my first review, so let's give it a shot...  Loud hiss of escaping carbon dioxide as the cap is opened indicates lively carbonation, however, when it is poured into the glass, it takes on a more viscous appearance, with some, but not many bubbles. Approximately 1 inch off-white head which dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a very light, starfish-shaped lacing. Color is of bourbon but slightly redder.  On the nose, lots of caramel malts up front, with a slight presence of floral hops and a very slight hint of ethanol.  Taste... caramel malt just like the smell, hint of dark fruit mild sweetness, balanced by a lightly hoppy dry finish. Well-balanced, but not overly complex. I can see why it would go well with BBQ Pork, or lamb. Not sure if it would hold up to beef.  Mouthfeel... smooth and creamy, medium body with no hint of graininess or any off-textures. The mouthfeel is my favorite part.  Drinkability... I could finish a few bombers, but the lack of complexity and heavy mouthfeel makes me want to drink something with a little lighter body and more hop profile, but that has a lot to do with my personal preference to lighter bodied, hoppier beers as opposed to this beer, which has a thicker mouthfeel and more malt backbone.  Overall, a good beer, there are better examples of this style but it's not bad. Not necessarily my style, but it is enjoyable except for the fact that it leaves me wanting a more complex hop profile.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dmfrench,3.76,"A creamy, spicy, fruity Maibock... like an extra light Barleywine. ___  A: Beautiful pumpkin/cider orange with a billowy yellow-white head.  S: Not particularly aromatic... just a bit of sweet and spice.  T: Caramel malt, spices, and just the right amount of oily hops make up the body. The typical Maibock 'creaminess', alcohol, and a hint of dark fruit seal the deal.  M: Medium with a pleasant carbonation.  D: Heavier than other Maibocks I've had, but not at all cumbrous.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,NatetheGreat,3.85,"Somewhat lager tasting, somewhat like an ale.  Appearance is a nice glowing orange/tawny brown color. A bit hazy and florescent. Good head.  Aroma is subtle, not powerful. Sweet honey and fruit with light floral notes. Taste is well balanced. Hops are noticeable but not assertive, with mainly floral and orange. Malts range from honey to caramel to bread. Very interesting and tasty.  Mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying and it's easy to drink.  I've been looking forward to this one for quite a while and happened upon a 6 pack. Good beer, my second from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ajuarez,3.85,"From the bottle of a barrel-perched skeleton pours this PNW Maibock. Based on the pour it looks medium bodied. The honey amber hue is slightly translucent with microbubbles of co2 effervescing from the bottom. Ivory head holds up fairly well before lacing the walls. Taste is of clean, sweet cereal grains, kinda like golden grahams. Malt is sturdy. I get a sense of perfume and citrus from the hops, not necessarily on the tastebuds, but swirling around the sides and roof of my mouth. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet finish. A very civil interaction between malt and hop with the grain taking the top billing. Good brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,originalsin,4.16,"One thing I've always loved Rogue for is their awesome artwork and choice of names for their brews. Dead Guy Ale is no exception--certainly a stunner and, quite possibly, a killer. The pour is a slightly hazy amber with about half an inch of awesome white head that laces down most of the glass and fades to a nice cover on the brew. It smells very faintly of hops but mostly of sweet malts. It's a clean smelling beer and there's little surprise that it tastes just as clean, goes down really smooth, and is an altogether enjoyable brew. Balance is key here. It tastes mostly of sweet malt with an estery trace in the background-- almost like a not-quite-ripe pineapple that has hardened a bit. That's just the first thing that comes to mind. Citrus and sweet malt flavors are bigger at firs.  Hats of to Rogue for a really enjoyable brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,demuzik,3.89,"I won't restate a lot of what has been said, but I will mention that half way through the beer, you start to notice a lot less of the malt and a lot more of the alcohol and ""exotic / unknown"" fruit.  I would definitely recommend getting this on draft, and abstain from drinking it bottled if possible - this one doesn't carry its wonderful character in a bottle very well.  And, lastly, while it is categorized as a Mailbock, it does start to blend into tasting like a red ale on your second bottle.  Bottom line: Good brew - I've had both tapped and bottled - love the tap, don't like the bottle. Good luck!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Gosox8787,4.17,"Poured from the bottle into a mug in two parts. The beer was orange to amber colored with a one finger light head, with good retention. Nose was caramel from the malt and a slight pine from the hops. The hops are prevelant than I thought in the nose. The taste is almost all malt. Caramel and molasses dominate and lend a nice sweetness to the beer. There are hops in the background that offer a bitter taste to the end. These two flavors balance nicely. The mouhtfeel is medium bodied with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is good. The ABV is not really noticeable. There is a nice warming after each sip though.  Overall, a very good brew that is sessionable. Good malt flavor and nice balance.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,damienblack,3.72,"Pours a transparent rustic orange-brown. Thin head, little retention or lacing. Looks to be short on carbonation. Smells almost like a thin brown, sweet malt with a slightly bitter nuttiness behind it. Taste is similar, tastes like a clean lager, but with a bit of a nuttiness. Slightly bitter finish. A bit of pizazz flourish at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit low and watery, could use more carbonation I think. Tastes kind of flat. Decently drinkable. Overall, nothing spectacular. Kind of expensive for a session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MeisterBurger,4,"Pours a turbid orange-yellow with an ample head. Decent lacing.  Smells sweet and bready, caramelly, with some tangerine and a boquet of flowers. Smells fantastic.  Taste is malty and citrusy--it's sweet but in a clean way. It's very much like the smell, with the bready caramel and citrusy notes. Put simply: It tastes great and the flavor improves as it warms as more maltiness and bitterness comes into play with every sip with leafty hops and toffee and a hint of ripe anjou pear.  Wonderfully smooth, full mouthfeel and good carbonation.  Dangerously drinkable at this ABV.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,eat,4.21,"This is a great looking beer. It almost looks like what I know as a cream ale; thick creamy head sticks around for a while, full-bodied looking beer. The colour is amazing; a bright, shining amber. The dissipating head leaves nice, thick lacing up the side of the glass and retreats to a thin, frothy layer.  I'm not picking up much smell off this one. Maybe a bit of yeast; whole wheat bread. Kind of smells like a rising pizza dough. A little honey or caramel, something sweet anyway.  Loads of wheat taste in this one. A tiny bit sweet up front, great roasted malt on the finish. Mostly just a great, wheaty taste. There is some hoppiness to it but it's well blended into everything else; maybe a little more in the background. You can feel the bit of extra ABV, but in a good way. Doesn't taste much like a dead guy, I'll have to subtract some points for accuracy.  This is a medium bodied beer with a nice, medium carbonation. Not exactly like a party in my mouth; more of a small gathering of good friends.  Very drinkable. I could easily pound this back all night; actually I would love to pound this back all night. I will definitely buy this again. I'm three for three for Rogue. This is a great brewery.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S- A bit citrusy up front, along with some sweet malts and a bit of hops.  T- Very similar to the smell although the hops come through a little bit more. Still a lot of sweet malt taste to it however. Pretty good overall.  M- Smooth, light-medium body. Plenty of carbonation provides for a refreshing drink. Complemented this summer night relatively well.

132,355,adamette,4.13,"Live Review. My second here on BA. The first apparently got deleted. It was maybe the 2nd or 3rd review that I did. Maybe it was a bit too pedestrian for someon'e tastes. Anyway, poured from a 12 oz. bottle that I purchased as a single at Cost Plus World Market in Mentor, Ohio into my Samuel Smith pint glass.  A A nice orange translucent body under a nice 2 inch head (I poured vigorously) which stuck around for 2 to 3 minutes. Nice amount of visible carbonation rising up from the bottom as well. Look is inviting, interesting.  S Wow how my smell/taste has changed after 412 reviews....I had recalled a big hop profile and strong malt when I previously rated this one but now I find the smell to be not very strong at all. There is a nice medium malt and grains (barley) smell with a tinge of sweetness but none of this is strong in ""up front"" like I thought that I had recalled.  T A nice medium malt/barley balanced beer with little or no hops to be tasted. I find this to be quite pleasant indeed as the sweet malt and barley make a nice balance.  M Light to medium with reasonably low ABV and nearly (if not completely) absent hop profile. There is also a modicum of syrupy stickiness that lingers briefly after swallowing it.  D Very good indeed and better than I recall.  Notes: It is remarkable how much my smell/taste has changed in the past 18 months as I think about this beer and strain to recall what it tasted/smelled like then. Anyway, this is a nice, drinkable beer from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T - The malts leads you down the journey, but the hops make their presence known right away. The malts then continue you on your way, with a nice sweet finish. There is a lot of biscuity malt in this one.  M - Medium body, with moderate to high carbonation. This beer goes down nice and smooth.  D - Absolutely. You could session with this beer.

132,355,cavedave,3.95,"Only second time trying this style.  Pours an exquisite golden amber with a light and foamy one inch head. It recedes slowly to leave gargoyle arms and thick slabs of nearly white lace. This pilsner glass really shows it off.  Smell is a mild perfume, sweet malty and yeasty tones carrying hints of pear, flowers, a lighter hint of citrus, and an even lighter hint of bitter.  Half way through a bomber, and as it has warmed nearly to room temperature, I've finally gotten a handle on why this is so delicious. First sips were a mystery, my mouth registered delicious, but not its component flavors. The balance was perfect, almost like a good altbier's. Now in its revealed form, the flavor is a brilliant mix of light, subtle, and luscious hop tones, almost bitter, almost citrus, almost grassy, and light pear and plum tones. It accomplishes this with a sweetness and lack of alcohol flavor that is artistically done, and a mildly dry and tasty finish that isn't overly astringent.  Despite its decidedly dextrinous look, it is a light and wonderful drink-easy brew. It's lightness and medium carbonation are the perfect compliment to an understatedly delicious beer. Clears out for the next sip nicely.  Drinkability is the strong point of this beer. Hot day today, I'm already wishing I had another of this delicious and wonderful brew. Will definitely get again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Came out a cloudy amber/orange color from the 22oz bomber, almost looks like honey, a very thin head that didn't stick around to much.  I smell sweet malts, apple, honey and earthy hops, though the sweet dominates the nose.  The assertive hop bitterness is mellowed by and balanced by a blanket of sweet maltiness that lingers. The malts present a sweet/bready overall clean flavor, and steal the show from the grainy/earthy hops that play a balancing supporting role.  This beer packs a bit of a punch from the carb. a bit fizzy,and is slightly fuller than i expected.(this is good).

It is very grainy but still has a very tasty appeal.It is quite distinctive.  Mouthfeel:It makes your mouth feel syrupy and your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so I could have done without that  Drinkability: It is quite drinkable. I was surprised my pallete adjusted after the second one. It isn't the smoothest of beers but then again I don't think it is supposed to be.  Overall: I would say it is a unique brew.

Smell: A litle bitter, and a little caramel, but you know, it smells a little like cabbage and reminds me of an amber.  Taste: Yeah, the amber taste is there and it is a little like cabbage; a slightly unpleasant aftertaste; alcohol starts to make an appearance in the taste.  Mouthfeel: A little sticky, but that's about it. Not much going on here.  Drinkability: Meh. It's not the best tasting beer that I've ever had but it's not awful in terms of driniability.

132,355,johnmichael712,4,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a Unibroue flute. There is no freshness date on the bottle. This beer pours a beautiful, opaque, deep gold color that is a very, very pretty color for a beer. While the BJCP guidelines for a Maibock claim that ""lagering should provide good clarity"", Rogue's version is much cloudier. The head is a light khaki or ivory color that has a nice, fluffy appearance and eventually fades to a thick ring around the top of the beer, and it does its best to leave concentric circles around the sides of the glass.  Smell: The nose of this beer is very hefty, and the strongest aromas are a sweet, toasted maltiness that is matched well by a tropical fruitiness that is somewhat akin to mango. There are also hints of caramel, well toasted bread, and citrus zest.  Taste: When I first saw this bottle I wondered why the skeleton on the front is so jolly considering his less-than-lively state, but now I realize that it's because he has a tall mug of this beer. While I can admit that this is my first Maibock and I'm not quite sure what it's supposed to taste like, I can still cast ""supposed to"" into the wind and say that this is one fine beer. Dead Guy is a very well balanced beer, with strong flavors of sweet malt and spicy hops battling it out on my tongue. As in the nose of this beer these two flavors are by far the most prominent, but there are also notes of caramel, pine hops, and toasted bread. There is a dry, spicy, and lingering hoppy finish, but surprisingly I'm finding that the more I drink this the more the malt comes to the forefront in the end.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a thick, rich, medium-full body that is well supplemented by moderate carbonation. There isn't much of a warming effect from the alcohol, but hey, it's only 6.5% ABV.  Drinkability: It had been so long since I had tasted this beer, and I had forgotten how light and easy-drinking this ""Maibock-style-Ale"" is. The BJCP guidelines for Maibock tell me this style is ""specifically associated with springtime and the month of May"", and after drinking this light, refreshing beer I can see why. Easily sessionable, this beer is a delight to drink.  Notes: I've had Rogue Dead Guy numerous times before this review, but as the month of April begins to close I thought what better a time to review a Maibock than a beautiful spring day? This is one wonderfully light, crisp, and refreshing beer, and it suits the warmer months well. Rogue Dead Guy is a finely crafted brew, and while it won't knock your socks off with intense flavor (which it isn't supposed to do - sometimes it's nice to have something light) it will definitely make you appreciate the craftsmanship of the Rogue brewers and the gentle pleasantness of this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Infamous7100,3.53,"A: An amber/mahogany straight from the tap. About a one finger head with minimal lacing. S: Citrus is the first thing that comes to mind, but I'm getting malt as well. Some pine is there too. T: It's sweet up front, the malts are doing their job. Blends nicely into some mild bitterness because of the hops. The grapefruit taste is apparent on the back of the tongue, right before the finish. M: Nothing special. It hangs around a little, minimal bite. Crisp. D: I enjoy this more than IPA's or Pale Ales. It gives me the best of both worlds.  This is a nice beer to have if you are not a Hop Head, but want to know what all the fuss is about. It gives you a malty sweetness to balance a bitterness you may not be used to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,OzarkElmo,4.42,"Pours a hazy, murky deep orange/red honey color. Aroma of sweet malts/caramel. Moderate head mostly diminishing with nice lacing throughout. Definite yeast presence. Roasted straw and light molasses. Slightly sweet taste and light bitter finish, lasting a good measure. Medium-bodied and well balanced beer. Definite malty, caramel flavor. Not very hoppy to me, even in finish. Good malted beer - Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Duhast500,4.35,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass.  The color is a hazy orange/amber with a foamy white head.  The smell is hoppy, a peppery, floral flavor..

132,355,youngblood,3.95,"This was the beer that started it all for me. The one that turned me into a BA. Haven't had it in a while and then got it last night. A - Pours a coppery amber, a brooding amber though. One finger white head. This is a decent looking beer. Very pleasant to look at. S - I think that it was served a bit too cold for my liking and I didn't get a great bit from the nose. I remember there being more when I drank this a lot. I get a bit of caramel sweetness, some dark fruit, bit of blueberry and blackberry. T - Has a very solid malt backbone, biscuity and sweet. There is a nice hop presence balancing out the malt. Getting a nice fruit flavor here, bit of strawberry/blackberry mostly? Nice citric after taste. Very Nice. M - Has a smooth texture, almost like marbles. Leaves mouth refreshed, no stickiness. D - Very drinkable. You can kick these around all day.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,greg202stewart,3.73,"The best thing about this beer is the marketing for it. The name sucks you in. As for the beer, the appearance is a caramel brown. It smells strong of malt.

S: smelled like a bock but with noticeable alcohol notes. a bit sweeter than I expected.  T: OH WOW! This is almost the tastiest beer I have ever drank. Had one because the tapper looked interesting, after it was gone I had to go get another because I drank it way too fast. Not as good in the bottle. Drink from the tap if you can.  M: the beer just hugs the tongue and leaves just enough remembrance to leave you wanting more.  D: Absolutely spectacular. One of my all time favorite beers.  Get this on tap if you can.

The head clung for a while before descending to a loose, spotty head with sticky lacing and the ring.  S - A fresh smell of sweet malts and a subtle hop aroma.  T - Starts malty sweet and finishes with an array of hop flavors. Not very complex but great none-the-less.  M - Crisp and medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. Smooth yet bubbly.  D - The Dead Guy could be put on a pedistal for other session beers to look up to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,stingrayvr6,3.58,"Had at Marathon Grill in Philly. Poured an amber brown with thin white head with almost no retention. Smelled malty and sweet with some hop notes and also vague hints of molasses and lemon. Taste was fairly light, much lighter than I expected, watery like seltzer at first then moved onto that molasses/lemon taste probably form the yeast (I once used a particular yeast in some homebrew that gave a similar taste). Sweet at first then sharp with a faint hoppy finish. Very wet feel. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just nothing too special.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,weazal,3.92,"A: Not overly potent. Mild warm, sweet spices. Musky tropical fruit and light floral notes. Gosh it was hard to discern.  T: The perfect contrast of bitter hops drifting along a blanket of smoothness. Sugary sweetness flirts on the tip and edges of the tongue. Strong, in your face flavor. The sweetness radiates a fruitiness throughout the beginning and mid until it slowly warms into caramel, which dissipates leaving just that lingering, back-of-the-mouth hoppy bitterness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,PatrickJR,3.79,"Had this on-tap at the Hibernian in Cary, NC.  A - Reddish orange, slightly hazy. Small quarter inch of white head disappeared fairly quickly. Minimal lacing.  S - Sweet fruit (apples, pears, tropical hints) with small doses of caramel. Moderate floral hops.  T - Lots of fruitiness early on fairly in line with nose. Tropical fruits seem most evident, some combination of pineapples and pears. Fruity sweetness delves into modest caramel flavor. Late palate floral flavors come through before leading into a lingering bitterness.  M - Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation. A little too much carbonation.  D - Strangely, something about this beer makes it difficult to drink more than one of. Lots of sweetness and bitterness make this brew rather rich. Certainly an improvement on-tap however.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Malty, grainy and sweet, not much else to say.  It tastes bitter and tangy. The is a nice caramel influence, some iced tea, a little bit of floral notes from the hops. The hops become more assertive as it warms. Half way through, there is a definite floral/earthy taste. Yummy. This beer is relatively subdued, yet delicious with a chewy, velvety mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. I could drink a few of these in one sitting.

Since it is my last one and had to drive FAR to get it, I'll write some lines.  Nose is really malty at first. Orange zest and prunes come up. In mouth, you can taste caramel and orange zest. Not relly sweet. Little bitterness here. Once it warms up a little bit, honey flavor tends to develop. Carbonation is medium.  Another good product of Rogue. Next in line: Double dead Guy Ale...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,drizzam,4,"My first foray into the world of Rogue.  Appearance - Poured into a pint glass, nice fluffy eggshell color head that retains beautifully. Held up to the light it is a dirty, cloudy orange/copper color.  Smell - Sort of a sweet, malty smell. Seems like I smell a slight caramel odor as well. Smells pretty tasty.  Taste - Tastes malty, with a slight piney, hoppy bite on the swallow. Not as sweet or caramelly as the nose would suggest.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied mouthfeel. Rather creamy with a bitter hoppy aftertaste. Seems to be rather low in the area of carbonation, and I think this lends to the creamy mouthfeel and medium body.  Drinkability - I think this is a brew with quaffability. Maibocks are pretty decent session brews in my opinion, and this one is certainly no exception. I could see drinking a few of these at a grill-out on a summer weekend. Highly recommended!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

It smells sweet and malty. It is pretty smooth and tastes of malts. Also a little bit of sweet bitterness. There is something weird in the taste that I seem to dislike more every time I have this. It is not bad at all, just changing my original reaction. It is drinkable, but I couldn't drink a lot of this in a night. Still, a very good beer.

Smell: Nose is very strong apple, with some dark fruity dry hops deep down. Sweet. Some malts, but not overly strong.  Taste: A piney, hoppy bite up front that smooths out nicely with more malts in the back. Good balance between the malts and the hops, but a little ""simple"". Not as sweet as the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Has a nice bite and is decently crisp.  Drinkability: Definitely a good beer and an easy drinker.

The smell is heavy with malts and some notes of carmel. Theres also a very estery kick, with another aroma that adds warmth somehow to it. Taste is sharp and crisp- you get the malts and citrus, along with a bit of honey right before the slightly bitter (but great) aftertaste, which is hops-heavy. Mouthfeel is smooth but light- not too rich. Overall, I would say this is very drinkable. I'm a new fan of this and would definitely keep it stored in my fridge.

132,355,Jeffo,3.97,"Got this at Bert's Bierhuis in Utrecht.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a medium thick 1 finger off white head. Medium carbonation evident. Color is pumpkin orange or amber and is partially cloudy. Head levels out to a thin film that stays only around the rim. No lacing. Beautiful color, but the rest is quite average.  SMELL: Sweet caramel malt and quite fruity, perhaps some mango or melon. Citrus like with a touch of vanilla in the back perhaps. Pretty nice really.  TASTE: Toasted malt and some sweet caramel malt together with some citrus fruit undertones. Mango shows up, accompanied by a touch of grapefruit, followed by some bread-like flavors and hop bitterness at the end. Bitter-sweet aftertaste is strong and long lasting, with a touch of bread in there too. Pretty decent.  PALATE: Medium-thick body with medium carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth at the front but ends with a bit of a scratch and bite at the back of the throat right at the end. A nice touch. Finishes somewhat dry on the palate.  OVERALL: Very enjoyable. A drinkable brew that's tasty and interesting. The ABV is a little high to be a session beer, but this is definitely one I could have a few of.

132,355,Ralphus,4.43,"Rogue makes some good beer.. and their dead guy ale is no exception. I have been drinking this since the fall when I was introduced to it at a beer tasting party and it has not let me down since.  Dead guy pours with a lovely looking cloudy golden brown color and has an offwhite head that sticks around. There's some lacing down the sides of the glass as you drink (rather quickly). On the nose you'll find biscuit malts, flowers and honey.. it's pleasant but you might not know it was there unless you were looking for it. The taste however, is a standout. Rich caramel sweetness up front with just the right mouthfeel greets you at every sip.

Medium body with a light to medium carbonation level. I could see drinking maybe 2 of these in a sitting but I didn't feel like I would want to drink this all night long. For some reason, I've never been blown away by Dead Guy like some people are but this is still pretty solid stuff.

132,355,herbalist,4.13,Rogue has numerous great beers and I'll note that overall I'm a big fan of this brewery. Dead Guy pours a nice orange/amber color with a small white head. In a glass it is almost translucent and is not particularly dark.  It smells sweet with a mix of malt and maybe light citrus. It has overtones of yeast and alcohol. It almost smells as if its going to taste slightly bitter.  The initial taste is sweet with good bit of malt and an almost caramel or toffee flavor. It tastes kinda like candy! But not in a way that is unenjoyable or fruity. Underneath the sweetness there is a nice bite from the hops. The beer is also not too thick which is nice but at the same time has a nice subtle alcoholic warmth to it. Its a great beer to drink as winter comes to an end but is still a little chilly outside.  It is not too heavy so it can be drinkin often and it goes really well with pizza!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Wutz,4.05,"I've had Rogue's Dead Guy on a number of occasions. Each time I have it, it's better than the last. I assume it's because my palate is evolving. It's possible I'm nuts, but I'd like to think I'm holding it together pretty well. Anyway, on to the review of one of my favorite beers:  Appearance - Though I'm not an expert in color nomenclature, it appeared to be an attractive burnt orange. My pouring technique was a bit sloppy and heavy so a thick head formed and dissipated semi-quickly leaving a bit of lacing on the glass.  Aroma - I first detected a significant malty sweetness in concert with orange zest notes. Upon further investigation, I dug out a bit of spiciness and some raisin/prune smells.  Taste - Early in the taste, I got a good dose of what I think is caramel malt and piney bitterness. They seemed to be so well balanced that I had a hard time picking them out individually to put a name/quality to the really impressive taste I was getting. Swallowing revealed a bit of honey and as the beer warmed (maybe even past the ideal temp) the honey became more pronounced and helped reveal earthy. grassy, and bread-like flavors.  Mouthfeel - The beer had a medium body that I felt wasn't too syrupy (is that even a word?) for the taste but was possibly inching toward it. There wasn't a whole lot of carbonation and it felt soft in my mouth, which I quite liked. I do have to note that I agitated this beer quite a few times to try to reveal aromas I thought were there (and may be there that I'm just not finding) so I probably ""swirled out"" a fair bit of the carbonation.  Drinkability - The medium mouthfeel with a faintly oily finish made me salivate after each sip. I felt pained putting the beer down and picking the pen up knowing I'd have to wait a tick to imbibe again. I could probably drink four-ish of these, my usual limit for beer consumption. It might have too much sweetness to be an all-nighter, though. I'd recommend a switch to SNPA when this becomes too sweet; the American pale worked well after this Mai-ale for me on at least one occasion.  Overall, I really love this beer and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my best friend, my most discerning beer buddy, or my boss.  Unfortunately, my scores might be a bit low because I'm ""hedging my bets"" to allow myself some wiggle room on future beer reviews. I can't just give this thing an easy ""A"" having only one other review under my BA belt, though I'd really like to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jekster,4.1,"Appearance: This beer pours a beautiful, slightly cloudy, deep amber orange with a one finger thick pure white head.  Smell: This beer has aromas of toasted caramel and grainy malt. There is a pleasant fruity ester of pears or honeydew. The sweet malt aromas come across obviously, but do not overpower the more subtle elements in the nose.  Taste: This beer has a definite light fruit character meshed with a bready, malty, goodness. There is a sweet honeysuckle nectar character along with the flavors of fresh warm baked bread and subtle bitter cherry aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a light and pleasant mouthfeel with a low to medium low carbonation. It is amazingly easy on your palette and extremely refreshing.  Drinkability: I could kick back quite a few of these over the evening at a pub or while sitting on my porch during the summer. It has nice flavors, without being overpowering, and a light body that makes extremely easy to drink.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: I think this is a fantastic beer. It has a nice flavor and aroma profile that is complex enough yet not too over the top given the light, playful nature of the body. It definitely has more character than your traditional English styles, but is reminiscent of that same vain of easy drinking subtlety flavored beers. I think it would pair fantastically with typical pub grub like fish and chips or mutton stew. Or, it would pair fantastically with a six pack of it's buddies on a hot summer dark or while raking leaves in the fall.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Didn't pick up as much sweetness as others have experienced here. Unremarkable up front, but bitter hoppiness and warm alcohol pick up the middle and ride through the end. Surprisingly noticeable alcohol given the fairly low ABV. Just not a whole lot going on here, but nothing terrible either.  M = Pretty good. Pretty light on the palate, not too much carbonation.  D = Fairly drinkable. Easy going down.  Unremarkable overall. One I would drink again if I come across it, but I'm not going out of my way.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Brew33,3.56,"Dead Guy on tap at the Cock & Bull in Glendale.  Listed as a Maibock but labeled as an Ale... Interesting. Nice color, thin head. The smell was slightly sweet, nothing special.  The taste was good. VERY sweet. Raw honey with a slightly hoppy finish. Fairly balanced, tastes like a beer with 4.5% abv as opposed to over 6%.

S- Pretty standard with a malt forward nose with some slight caramel qualities. Maybe some hops in the back but not much. Some spice in the back as well.  T- Some piney hops are in the taste where they are not in smell but otherwise this deadguy was killed by malts most likely but in a humane way. Some spicy factors come with warming while a slight bitterness overall.  M- I have not had many maibocks but i would say this is evenly balanced. Both bitter & sweet with a creamy effect. Medium bodied with carb action.  D- A few pints for sure but not an all nighter as i would tire of it. Overall, this is quite drinkable.

132,355,KTCamm,4.5,"Poured from a 220z bomber into a Duvel glass. Color was hazy orangey copper with high creamy foam and lacing.  Smell was a sweet & spice - malt, hops, and something else wafting off the top I couldnt quite place.  Taste is wonderful, the malt starts you off - there are hops throughout and they are spicier than I am used to - not overpowering, but enough to kick you around a bit and wake you up. At times a slightly sour taste comes through. Active carbonation in the mouth, and the taste holds up great.  22oz down I could go back for more - that is drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,dfolmste,3.88,"Appearance: Good amber color with a thick bubbly head. I have been hearing a lot about Rogue and this beer in particular so I'll give it a shot. So far so good.  Smell: A smell of hops but not that powerful. A bit of malt sweetness, but even that is kind of faint. Good because it doesn't smell like other ales I have had, but just a bit above average.  Taste: The taste is a lot better than the smell. A fruity taste with just the right amount of bitterness. Citrus and apricots take center stage. Makes me think of a better Magic Hat No.9.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a good balanced feel. I normally prefer bitter beer over beers that are sweet, but the sweetness of this is very unique. Aftertaste is important to me and Dead Guy lingers well.  Drinkability: Medium body and good taste should set the stage for great drinkability, but I am concerned that the sweetness that I enjoyed will catch up after a few.

T: Nice short bitter finish. Compliments the slight citrus of each successive sip.  M: Full bodied, and evenly balanced with the carbonation.

132,355,ThreeWiseMen,4.25,"Purchased a growler at Cork N' Bottle and split it with Wiseman Zach. (Review written by Wiseman Nick).  Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Hazy, orange-copper body with thin, sticky, off-white head. Barely any height and almost no retention on initial pour, but successive pints had large foamy heads with better retention. Tons of lacing in every pour.  Smell: Caramel, resinous hops, candied sugar, and some fruity esters. Getting some sour funk and even wheat (and other grains). I'm really not doing this justice. Extremely complex. I love it!  Taste: Caramel malt, dough and spices, swamp funk, earthy resinous hops, and candied sugar. Similar to the smell, but not quite as good. Finishes bitter and sticky. Fantastic balance and complexity, but missing that burst I remember from the on-tap version.  Mouthfeel: Sticky and malty and a bit flat :(. Could've been a bad seal. Full-bodied and a bit syrupy. Other than the lack of carbonation, I really like it.  Drinkability: Oh hell yeah! This is sooo complex, tasty, and smooth. Zach and I wish we had a second growler. The one knock on this is it might be a bit too full in body.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,foles,4.45,"Presents a deep amber gold, slightly cloudy and clean fluffy head.  Sweet smell of fruit, maybe apples or mango. Very malty in with a ESB type of body, but a noble hops flavour. Less munich character than expected from the style, but a nice blend of malts on the palate. Slipperly and slightly buttery in the mouth. Does not feel like 7% alcohol. Quite a bitter finish, maybe a tad overkill for my liking, but probably required at 7% abv. I read Rogue use their ale yeast for this one. Could actually tell it wasnt a lager, but a clean ale - not that it mattered!  A brilliant beer, quite simply one of the best I have ever had. Can't pick a beer that is similar, as proper Maibocks are fairly different in character. Had to pay a massive AUD$18 for it, but it wasn't money wasted.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Pours a clear yellow color with some sediment at the bottom. The smell is a bit weak, but I could pick out some malts and a bit of citrus. The hops really came out in the taste, as it was bitter first and malty second. There was a citrus taste that lasted throughout the taste, but it seemed to linger in the background. It had decent thickness and carbonation, but nothing to rave about. Overall, it's a good beer to have in a bar, but it's not a great beer. It's decently drinkable, but the flavor is just a bit too strong.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smells of breads, malts, and some spicy hops. Maybe a little citrus.  Taste mirrors the nose, some sweet malts out in front with a little fruitiness cut by a spicy hop bitterness.  Good mouthfeel. Nice amount of carbonation, combined with a medium body that's smooth and easy to the finish.  Overall a very drinkable beer that I enjoyed a lot. My first Rogue beer, and it's good.

Dark copperish colour, slightly cloudy with the requisite Rogue head and lacing.  This one doesn't disappoint in the aroma dept. Rich roasted malt and floral hop in near perfect harmony.  Nice Job! Rich roasted malt followed by a butterscotch sweetness. Pretty good dose of hop cuts the sweet malt ride down to size, but doesn't sideswipe it right off the road as it makes a reappearance later toward the finish. Alcohol content really well hidden and rarely coomes into the picture.  Smooth, medium body. Carbonation is bang on or at least close.  Very drinkable. A very nice ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The taste is sweet throughout (cherries?) with bread first, the flowers in the middle and some citrus at the finish. Bitterness is minimal.  The mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is decent--the body can get to be a bit much after a beer or two.

132,355,CMW,3.58,"The bartender grabbed a pint glass and let 'er rip. Once it was handed to me I began to examine. The color is dark orange/copper with a small off-white head that was gone by the time I blinked. Slight lacing on the side of glass was the only remaining evidence of a head. It was somewhat cloudy however; I could still notice a decent amount of carbonation dancing in the glass.  The first smell that hit my nose was roasted malt. There were also considerable spices and a tad of fruit in there. There was a nuttiness that made me want to take a bite.  Sweet upfront with a nice blended of toasted malt. I detect the taste of dried fruit as well possibly apricots or raisins. The finish is on the dry side with nice hop spiciness. This is a medium bodied brew with just the right consistency. Slightly creamy and well balanced between the malt and hops. My only complaint is a small metallic aftertaste.  Rogue Dead Guy Ale is a very good example of a non-traditional Maibock.

That hits first, then follows through with a some sweetness and an aftertaste of smooth hops. Thats the star in this one.  M: Moderately thin in texture.

132,355,WalrusJockey,2.93,"12oz into Ayinger Celebrator glasses.  Appearance- cloudy, dim orange color. Head is light tan. Looks good, well lit, but not so good in a dim room.  Smell- Malt is very prominent, while spice and bubble gum aromas from the ale yeast are also noticeable. Over all the smells are fairly light, and not especially noteworthy for good or for ill. As the beer warms a bit, during drinking, the smell actually goes from bland to acidic and weird smelling.  Taste- malt eases into the palate, and fades into orange and cookie flavors; yeast contributions are very noticeable in the range of faint flavors, while the malt is especially cracker-or-cookie-ish. Swallow is clean into malt sweetness, which lingers gently on the palate. The yeast's contribution is very clear; this could not be confused for a lager-yeast bock beer. also, the hops are very noticeable, and startlingly so compared to ""true"" bock beers. At the same time, the malt flavors are very well rounded and very well developed.  As the beer warms over the course of a glass, the flavor profile changes significantly, to include both a shocking amount of hops, for the presumptive style, and the once citric orange changes into a bitter orange peel flavor. While none of these flavors are *bad,* they are very strange to find in something claiming to be a bock. Flavor started out at a 4, when the beer was at the cool end of the recommended temp, but as it moved to the warm end of the rec. temp, the score dropped to a 3.  Mouthfeel- the carbonation is on the heavier side, for the style, while the beer itself is on the lighter side for the style. The malt is a dead ringer for a bock, but the mouth feel is more like a wheat beer, like and bubbly. This is a bit odd, but not unpleasant.  Drinkability- it is drinkable, but I'm very glad I didn't buy a six pack, because I wouldn't especially like to have to drink more of them.  To me, this beer is an in-betweener. For an American Pale Ale, it is too heavy on the malt, and no where near crisp enough. But for a bock beer, even a light bock beer, the yeast profile is far to prominent for the style, the mouthfeel is distractingly light, and the hops are surprisingly intrusive. I understand that this was deliberate, but personally, I would prefer a good ale or a good bock to this beer, which tries to be both, but fails to be either.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This beer pours a dark, reddish copper with a nice 2 inch head that dissolved into just a thin layer that sat on the top of the beer. The aroma has a nice caramel/toffee aroma with a bit of vanilla, and some fruity esters. The flavor follows suit with some mild malts really building the flavor profile. Caramel, what reminds me of blueberries sometimes and cherries other times (no I'm not crazy) and other dark fruits. There is also a fake sweetness to it. It kind of reminds me of Sweet N Low.

132,355,RickKrumenacker,3.73,"Appearance: Crystal clear light-orange pour. Minimal head that did not stick around very long. Lots of bubbles at first, but calmed to individual bubbles rising to the top.  Smell: Sweet and floral hints. More malts come through as it warms.  Taste: Fruity sweetness up front. Light hops at the back of my tongue. The hops stick around awhile.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, with good carbonation. Not watery, but lighter than anticipated.  Drinkability: Fairly balanced...sweet up front with bittering hops in the end. Easy to get through a few of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mdcrouser,3.94,"Every color of the beer rainbow seems to explode from this beer - amber, gold, dark brown, and red, each refracting, breaking apart from the pint glass at different angles.  Small islands of head dot the top of the beer, slowing breaking apart and reforming, like thousands of years of evolution, occurring over the compacted timespan of a few mere seconds.  Subtly complex and woody, with a dry and caramelly hoppiness that slowly and coolly lulls you into a state of supreme relaxation. It finishes exceptionally smooth, with trailing hops and a light malt.  The only thing dead here is the guy on the label.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,StarlightSeraph,3.58,"Poured from a 12 ml bottle into a pint glass. This is my first beer of this style, so I don't really have a basis for comparison  Appearance: Pours golden-orange, a pale amber, with a three-finger slightly off-white thick, frothy head. Lots of bubbles. The beer was incredibly clear. Surprisingly little amount of lacing.  Smell: Malt and citrus, and hints of hops. A citrus-fruit smell really dominates.  Taste: Very sweet, and very smooth. Fruity and wheat flavors dominate. The fruit and wheat gives way to a hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Both flavors linger for quite some time. As it warms, the hoppy character begins to dominate more. Very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Very, very thin - it almost caught me off guard. It's so incredibly smooth, it almost feels like water in the mouth. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing.  Drinkability: The incredibly smooth mouthfeel and the balanced flavors make this one drinkable beer. Even though the sweetness isn't necessarily what I'm looking for in a beer, it was very easy to quickly finish the glass.  This would make a great session beer, and was a solid introduction into the style. I think it would make an excellent introduction for people who are just getting into craft beers, as well. I would say it's a little too sweet for my tastes, but its so easy drinking that it really doesn't matter. Solid beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

It smells nutty, sweet, and grainy. Very pleasant aromas. The taste has caramel sweetness and some clean spicy hop flavor. It is medium bodied with very good drinkability.

Taste- I think I could easily have a couple of these without thinking about it... it starts off sweet undertones and then moves to a hop bite but nothing that'll hurt ya. Finishes off with a light caramel finish. Very refreshing  Mouthfeel- Ahhh every now and then you find a beer that you know you will like if not love immediately.

132,355,rgrholmes168,3.77,"Poured from a 22oz. bomber bought the previous night.  I didn't get much of a head, maybe one finger at the most. The color was a dark amber bordering on orange. The head disappated rather quickly and left no lace around the top of the glass.  I had never had a Maibock to my knowledge so I researched what it was supposed to taste like on BA. According to the style it is supposed to have bit of a hoppy taste, but I did not get any of this in the aroma. I did get a good hint of the caramel malt in the beer.  My first taste of this beer showed that my nose had been correct. I got a lot of caramel malt in the taste of the beer. The beer had a nice sweet taste to it, and it went down very smooth.  I think this is a pretty decent beer. I don't have anything else to rate againist in its category so I may have to come back and rerate the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Nice red clayish color with continuing carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom.  Smell: Smells about 50/50 malt to hops. Sweet malt aromas comming through that hide a strong prescence of hops. Light grassy and citrus notes comming through with a good dose of grapefruit.  Taste: WOW!! this is the first Rogue beer I have ever had.. yess yes i know im a noob. Tastes like refreshing grapefruit, citrus with a slight bitterness at the end. Tastes of moderate malt covering up some pretty obvious hops. This beer its tricky.  Mouthfeel: Continued carbonation is comming through on the mouthfeel, but in a good way. It rolls smoothly around my mouth and is not overpowering at all.  Drinkability: Its a very delicious beer. Its got some nice hops as the backbone with some nice citrus and grassy notes. Its a good beer, nothing to go too crazy over, but a definate win over Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada. A bit more $$ than those, but its a better version of SA for sure and has a nice continued aftertaste that is sweet and grassy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,yesyouam,3.5,"Dead Guy is a hazy orange-brown beer with a smooth and clingy off-white head. The aroma is of sweet malt and fruity hops. It's rather faint and a little ciderish in the nose. In the mouth, it's dry and abundant in gravity. The flavor starts with the sweet malt, like baking cookies, which turns a little sour before unleashing its wooden bitterness and alcoholic warmth. It tastes much stronger than it is. (rated Jun 11, 2007)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The first times I tried this I hadn't developed quite the palate for the style. Now, I love it.  Amberish color, thick creamy white head with plenty of lacing. Lighter than I remembered, another change in my tastes.  The smell is malty, but sweet, the taste favors the smell.

S- Smell is sweet and malty  T- Taste is biscuity and malty, with a slightly sweet honey hint. Moderate kick of bitterness on the finish. As previously mentioned in other reviews, the ABV is as well hidden as any 4.5% macro.  M- Surprisingly creamy, with moderate carbonation.  D- Quite high. This would be a great beer for happily pounding one after another.  Future outlook: Good session beer that I would certainly never sneer at or turn away.

Zesty hops and caramel sweetness blend together nicely. Toasty notes add to the bitterness. You can tell there is some alcohol here, but it's hard to put a number on.

132,355,Reaper16,3.86,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass Appearance: an off-orange, sort of butterscotch color. Generous pale white head with good retention.  Smell: Sugary malts, maybe some caramel. Slight twinge of hops. No aroma is very present.  Taste: Toasted malts. Biscuits and perhaps honey. A decent bitter note from the hops. Maybe a very slight dark fruit element. Finishes dry with the hop presence lingering a bit. It's rather enjoyable if not terribly complex.  Drinkability: 6.5% ABV is a surprising figure; I would have guessed it to be closer to 5%. This is a super-drinkable beer, imo. The slight dryness is refreshing, and the fleeting fruit notes encourage further drinking to make sure that you're tasting correctly. ;)  I'm reasonably confident that the next time I reach for a beer to give to my BMC friends I will reach for Dead Guy Ale.

The ale is a golden orange color, not something you usually see.  No noticable aroma, maybe it's just me.  First sip is smooth and easy, balance is what this one is all about. Not malty or hoppy, crisp, fresh and clean, nicely carbonated. I honestly can't taste the hops or malt dominating, although a little citrus is left with aftertaste.  Nice mouthfeel and wonderfully drinkable, the ABV makes it very enjoyable with a buzz to be had around 3 beers. You could drink this all night if you didn't have to drive.

I've had it a few times to make sure because it's ok, it's supposedly in a style I love, and a lot of people think highly of it, but it really is very uninteresting and too grapefruity.  Amber, it has a big pale tan head slowly shrinking to a permanent thin foamy top and leaving some lace.  The aroma is nice caramelly toasty bread with a hint of grapefruit, light alcoholic-raisiny meatiness with hint of stewed fruit and herbs.  The taste is heavily toasted, caramelized whole wheat bread or overly baked cookies that have slightly burnt plus grapefruit. It soon develops a finish of bitter grapefruit pulp and cookies. It is rather thin and bland and too bitter for the character, but it's pleasant enough.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,ecoastman,4.13,"I'll need to do some more research - this beer is called an ale but it is categorized under the Maibock/Helles Bock lager style...perhaps a hybrid?  Anyhow:  Drinkability - a smooth easy drinking beer that I will definitely have again. Just keep an eye on the medium alcohol content!  Appearance - A murky orangy-brown copper color. The fine carbonation provides a thin head and with short retention. However, this is an attractive beer in my Stella style glass.  Smell - mild sweet caramel and bread. Some balance with the hops give a pleasant aroma.  Taste - Starts slightly bitter and transitions to malty flavours and similar to what you smell. There is some fruitiness half way and a sweet honey finish with very mild complexity in the background. Well balanced and very enjoyable (especially as it warms up a bit).  Mouthfeel - The medium body and smooth creamy texture with good carbonation coats your mouth and throat nicely. The higher alcohol level does not have a negative impact.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell: The aromas of sweet malts are undeniable. Lost amidst the malts are undertones of musty yeast.  Taste: The sweet malts step right up to the palate with strong flavors of caramel. The hops are drowned out by the sweetness. This beer has a very yeasty aftertaste, almost like a soggy multigrain bread.  Mouthfeel: Dead Guy bites at the tip of the tongue. It is highly carbonated and left me very gaseous. A crisp beer but leaves my mouth feeling oily.  Drinkability: Nice beer, complex and malty. In my opinion, its too sweet to score above a good.

Pours an orange-tinged golden hue with a creamy half-finger of off-white foam that settles somewhat slowly and leaves a good deal of fairly thin lacing.  Smells sweet, floral and fruity, with notes of apricot and slight hints of orangey citrus fruit.  Medium-bodied with a nicely carbonated mouthfeel, imbued with flavors of sweet malts and delicious fruity and bitter hop flavors, with caramel and grapefruit notes melding with a vaguely noticeable alcohol flavor, finishing somewhat bitter and fairly dry.  Delicious and fairly complex, and rather drinkable, this poster child for Rogue Ales is a worthy and widely available quaffer, making it a great fall-back beer, but not one to be used as an introduction to the uninitiated.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,angelmonster,3.25,"Pours a 1/2 inch head that fades rather quickly. Hazy brown/orange in appearance, minimum lacing through out  Smells sweet, somewhat fruity like apricot or prune. Also some hops and faint malts.  tastes a little hoppy, not as sweet as it smells. Malts arent very pronounced. Still taste a small amount of fruit with a creamy finish.  Mouth feel is over carbonated. Almost burns when you let it sit on your tongue.

132,355,donkeyrunner,4.4,"Light caramel color with decent sea salt looking lace. Very hazy. Smells like cider spice, sweet malt and citrus cough drops.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy, light caramel color with a thick, fluffy, tan head that stays for a while leaving lots and lots of lace.  Smell: A sweet, malty aroma with hints of hop spice and earthiness. The smell is appetizing and literally made me hungry.  Taste: Toasty and sweet, with a good bitterness and nuttiness toward the end. Malts at the beginning and hops at the end- great balance. Also has an interesting, unique tea sensation that gets into the sinuses; it's somewhere between a taste and a smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium, creamy body with balanced carbonation. Very smooth.

Taste - This was a complicated brew, a spicey taste up front, then finishes bitter and dry, with a odd aftertaste, but not bad.  Mouthfeel - Nice and full.  Drinkability - Very high for its ABV. When cold, these go down too easy.  Overall a very interesting brew, will buy again! And i must say a very interesting style of beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smells lightly hoppy, bit of something else there, too, earth in a way. The hops really show up in the taste, piney hop bite a the front, and in the aftertaste. Strange malt flavor, kinda nutty, sweet, odd but good. Nothing overpowering about he tase, its decent, but not really what i expect in a maibock ( even tho this is is an ale and not really a mai-bock) Goes down easy, not realy thic, not coorsl light thin either.

132,355,Japerrault,2.46,"A: Poured into a pint glass, a somewhat cloudy copper gold ale with a beautiful cream-colored head was observed. Good head retention and nice lacing noticed.  S: Bread, pine, citrus  T: Nothing terrible here. Sweet honey-like grain flavors hit me up front, then a grapefruit-like bitterness in the aftertaste. The two did not blend too well for me. It was like two very separate parts with no harmony, the bitterness just did not finish as well as I would have liked.  M: Rather light mouthfeel. A little thinner than I prefer. Carbonation is good.  D: Overall, this is an ""o.k."" ale. The lighter body allows one to drink easily, but the after taste was just a little harsh. Others have given this a high rating.

Feel was lively with good carbonation, enjoyable.  Drinkability was very high I wish I had a few more to really tell for sure.

Good amount of fruitiness.  The taste is complex. Great balance. First thing you get is the malt, which is sweet and fruity, this gives way to a hoppy bitterness in the finish and aftertaste.

132,355,caddybuyer,3.5,"A- As close to a true copper color as any beer. Very clear, minimal head with nice lacing  S- Very pleasing, full nose...heavy on the malts, citrus and pine.  T- Full bodied. The alcohol is present at first, hand in hand with a heavy bready caramely malt with some hops thrown in. This is a deep bodied wine-like brew. I almost feel that I am drinking something different that some of the other reviews posted here. Hops? I'm not a hophead, but this one can sure use some more for balance. Almost tastes like a Marzen on steriods. Not sure what is going on with this and I want to re-review with a new bottle as I may have gotten a bad one. Something tastes a little funky.  M- Full again, with nice carbonation balance.  D- Not one I'd go back to soon. A little too overpowering in flavor, and not in a good way.

Solid nose, just a little citrus, hops, bready notes, fruit and a hint of esters. The beer leaves a solid trail of lacing on the glass and retains the head far down the glass.  Taste is initially a wash of hops... lots. After the initial hit, a swish around the mouth reveals fresh bread, caramel, earthiness, some mild fruit. A pleasant spicy character presides behind everything. But hops really dominate and finish out the beer, with just a faint touch of caramel.  Very enjoyable.

132,355,djeucalyptus,3.77,"Haven't had a Dead Guy in a while and I figured it was time for a revisit.  a. poured a rich orange amber with a fairly thin head full of very fine, creamy bubbles of a khaki color. It dissipated fairly quickly leaving behind a bit of slick lacing.  s. Hops hit first, then were replaced with some heavy malt notes. Toffee, caramel, cooking sugar, hazelnuts and pecans. A hint of orange and floral hops linger despite the malt sweetness.  t. A big and fairly complex taste, defnitely highlighted by the malt backbone (exoskeleton?) that abounds with sweet malt, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and rootbeer barrel candies. Citrusy sweet hops showed up first, and again at the finish, paired with a warming malt alcohol note that was more pleasant than offsetting.  m. smooth, creamy, full, with a close-to-perfect level of carbonation.  d. Definitely drinkable and fairly sessionable. This one is a touch on the sweet malt side for me, which is saying a fair bit, as I'm a sucker for caramel and toffee in my beers. The hops just didn't quite pack enough of a punch to properly balance the malt sweet in my mind... maybe this bottle has been sitting for a good while?

A - Beautiful hazy copper, with a slight wispy head.  S - Less malty than one might think. The nose is not particularly complex, but I get a hint of sesame seeds and toasted nuts. I even get a little bit of caramelized onions, but that might be a bit of a stretch.  T - Rich and full, but completely drinkable. The kind of beer that you could drink all night long. A little spicy (nutmeg, cloves?) and a good fruit complement. This beer would be incredible with some spicy meats (pulled pork or other BBQ!) or a sharp nutty farmhouse cheddar.  M - Good bitterness that cleanses the palate well. Lingering spiciness, but doesn't leave that filmy coating left by lesser beers.

Served from 12oz bottle into pint glass:  Appearance: Deep brownish in color, with a geneorus sized head, and excellent lacing. Nice bubbling as well.  Smell: Hoppy & aromatic, nice hints of fruit here in the smell, as well as earthy malts.  Taste: Excellent balance of fruit to malts, this is a bock I can get used to! Earthy tones emit, yet the fruit is what gives this an excellent flavor! Bready malts appear in the backdrop with a hint of spices as well, very pleasant.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation here, thick, creamy, and leave a nice spice on your tongue from the mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Quite drinkable for a bock, it's amazing how the contrast of fruit and stronger malts tends to smoothley fit with eachother. This was definetley a diamond in the rough for me, an excellent beer with just the right amount of hops and bite. Good job to the guys at Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Has a very foamy, three-finger head which dissipates in a minute or two and leaves some rather thick lacing behind.  Smell: Sweet with a bitter kick, like a citrus scent with a sourdough undertone. Ends with the scents of light caramel, malt, and hops.  Taste: The taste starts bitter, then quickly gets sweeter before ending with the hops. Honey can defintely be detected, along with some sweet malt. Beneath the surface there is a creamy taste, almost like a light cream. Very malty and rich.  Mouthfeel: On the palate this beer is slightly thick, but not overly done. Very good carbonation that doesn't overly tingle the tongue. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, but it retains the light creaminess of the taste.  Drinkability: This Maibock is phenominal. The rich, creamy taste will soothe you to the core, no matter what time you indulge in it. You can drink this with dinner, with a snack, as a session beer, or any other time.

Spicy, floral hops take over and leave behind a dry, slightly bitter finish.  Medium bodied and creamy.  This beer is very well-balanced with a very pleasing flavor profile. Highly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nighthawk,4.35,"Hazy deep orange in colour with fluffy white head that reduces to a nice ring in several seconds. Nose is pine, light orange, with grain malts. Slightly caramel finish. Taste is hops up front, fruity pine, with a solid malt background, full of caramel. Slight alcohol warming and a bittersweet finish. There was a slightly soapy taste with the first few mouthfuls, but it wasn't apparent as I continued to imbibe. Might have been residue on the glass. (Bad, I know) Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, slightly thick body with a mild, almost but not quite balancing bite from the carbonation. Refreshing, clean, smooth and hides the alcohol very nicely. Quaffable is an understatement.  My first Rogue, and this is a great start. Wonderful back-and-forth play between hops and malts. An excellent ale.

132,355,gonzo46and2,4,Been meaning to review this one for a while. I've had a few six packs of this and it disappeared from the usual stores for a while.  Poured from a 22oz bomber into a hazy light copper-orange with a big head that dissipates to a thin ring around the glass.  Smell is full of malt with a decent hop presence. The malts remind me of many Octoberfest beers I've had but the hops bring a piney resinous aroma.  Taste is sweet caramel malts and a nice dosage of hops. The yeast has a familiar quality that's detectable after you've had enough beers from Rougue.  Mouthfeel is thick smooth and lightly carbonated. Very easy to drink.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Poured into pint glass aggressively, not much reaction from the brew, just a minor head that killed to nothing pretty quick.

132,355,Onenote81,4.08,Had this on tap at the First Street Draught House here in Winston. Came out a nice deep golden color with about an inch worth of head. Fairly good retention that left excellent rings along glass edge.  Smell of spices and citrus. Nice floral hop scent over all.  Taste was very good. A little malt sweetness that was kicked out of the way by the crisp hop bitterness on the finish. Nice aftertaste.  Moderate bitterness. Creamy and smooth characteristics make this highly drinkable. Recommend you try this one.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Bockrules,4.25,"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass  A - Pours a intriguing coper-amber color with a hint of orange. Fluffy two finger head that soon fell to a thin ring of bubbles. This started to disappear about 3/4 down the glass. Leaves moderate splotches of lacing mostly near the top of the glass.  S - Very pleasant aroma of caramel and spiced orange on a sweet, balanced background. Could stand to be more potent.  T - Strong orange flavor and alcohol presence up front. Very well balanced body with hints of spiced orange on a caramel malt background. Finnish is relatively smooth and caramel sweet, but the hop presence really shows up in the bitter-sweet aftertaste. A very sweet and drinkable brew that would be perfect in late spring.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation - suits the beer very well  D - Delicious and highly drinkable, but for $10 dollars a six here in Ohio (I think that's about what it goes for back home in Oregon) this is a beer that I can only afford for special occasions (perhaps end of spring term?!). My first go with a Hellas bock and I throughly enjoyed it.

132,355,erikm25,3.75,A: Pours copper orange with light amber highlights. Sits in the glass a golden haze and the head is somewhat fluffy and white after an aggressive pour into a pint glass. May have been a little flat due to being in a growler on a store shelf. Above average lacing around the glass.  S: Sweet malts coupled with toasty dark fruits and minor hop presence. Very faint hint of alcohol aroma towards the end of the nose.  T: Caramel and bready malts with a taste of light pine and citrus hops in the back. Not as sweet as the nose leads on but overall the taste is impressively balanced. I preferred the taste as it reached a little closer to a cool room temperature.  M: Light to medium bodied with fair carbonation.  D: Very well balanced and drinkable. This was a store bought growler and for ten bucks it was a pretty good deal. I will have to give this a try on tap in the near future.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bkilpatr,3.67,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. 10/11/08.  Pours an orange-amber color with about a finger of off-white head. Aroma is filled with sweet malt, floral hops, light citrus, and honey.  Taste is loaded with sweet malt followed by slightly bitter floral hops. Some light citrus (orange and lemon) and a bit of honey are also present. To me the taste is a bit on the sweet side, but not cloying. Pretty good taste, would be much better if a little less sweet.  Feel is smooth, creamy, and well-carbonated. Medium-bodied. Drinkability is pretty good. The alcohol is well hidden. If not for the sweetness, I could drink this all day.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TheMistler,3.88,"Poured a hazy, muted copper with orange notes. A just barely off-white head, creamy and cloudy, with good retention. The lacing - there was a pretty good amount of it - had a grainy appearance, like a worn-out old film.  A somewhat caramel-malty nose, maybe with raisins. Some floral, tangy hops.  Very light intro to the palate, then a hint of breadiness. I kinda detected apple fritter. Apple, citrus, raisins. Slight bittering and tanginess.  Consistent, good level of carbonation. A bit creamy. Medium bodied. If the speed with which I can knock a couple of these back is any indication, it is certainly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Auslander,3.91,"Poured a lovely copper color into a pint glass. Nice head retention. Light malt aroma. Good mouthfeel. Taste is a nice mixture of carmel, malt and spicy hops.

132,355,lhaqq,3.63,"A: Pours an opaque golden, dark wheat color. Decent head that is off-white. S: The smell isn't too strong but is mainly of yeast and some malt. T: The taste is malty, with some spices too. I couldn't pick up much else--didn't seem to complex M: The spices are rounded off in the finish, which is bitter but not long lasting. D: Easy to drink, though I felt a bit boring. Haven't had many maibocks yet, so maybe I am not used to the style yet.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nrpellegrini,3.65,"Like a Yuengling with more flavor..  Poured a golden brown color with a nice white head. Smelled of hops and malt sweetness.

132,355,BigJim5021,3.98,"One of my default go-to beers; Dead Guy pours a nice, hazy light orange with a white head that sticks around for a few minutes. The lacing is spotty, but goes all the way down the glass.  The aroma, well... is kinda muted. I dunno, maybe it's just my nose, but I'm not getting much here. Slightly fruity notes are all that I'm picking up right now.  What it's all about, though, is the flavor. Dead Guy has got that shit on lock. A little fruity, a bit nutty and with a nice dose of hop bitterness. This stuff has a hell of a flavor profile, and that's what keeps bringing me back for more. And for those keeping score at home, this stuff has a nice medium body that makes for an incredibly drinkable beer.  I could drink this stuff all day. It's really just an all-around great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jdg204,4.35,"My second Rogue and certainly their most prominent. I was excited to try this ale posing as a lager and use it as a gateway to Rogue's more extreme ales.  A: Poured amber with a thin off-white head that quickly disappeared, but left a ring around the edge. Little to no lacing was left.  S: Upfront sweet, caramel smell with a touch of fruity hops in background.  T: The taste was sweet, caramel-candy-like malt. Some hops in the background lended it a slighty fruitiness to it.  M: The feel was medium to full-bodied. Sweetness lingers a bit, but does not become cloying at all. Complexity and alcohol make it not as smooth as it could be, but fairly smooth nevertheless. The flavors linger.  D: Fantastic brew and very cool to get such a wide offering of a unique style (and a damn good style at that). I'm moving towards buying more 750ml. offerings, so Rogue's more extreme brews are on the near horizon, after this I'm excited!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,oriolesfan4,4.05,Got this as a joke from a family member (just because she thought the name was funny)  Usually not too big of a fan of this style but this beer was delicious. A nice honey taste to it and at 6.5% ABV it went down a little bit too easy. A very smooth and drinkable beer.

Appearance: Poured a golden yellow-brown with slight hazing and a big 2-finger white foamy head that faded fairly quickly to a long-retained skim at the top. Light lacing is left behind throughout as I drink.  Smell: Very toasty grain & nutty scent, a little syrupy, very strong malts. Haven't had a lot of bocks, but the smell is very unique and nice.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Very sweet tasting, almost like honey, with strong nuttiness and toasted grain. The alcohol is very masked in all the sweetness and malts. Medium mouthfeel is very creamy and satisfying.

132,355,Seanibus,4.1,"This is a good beer on tap, comparable in a lot of ways to Victory's Hop Devil.  Pours amber with a fluffy head and good streams of carbonation coming up from the bottom. The aroma brings up string amber malt and some floral hops. The flavor is strong, rich and malty with pleasant, unobtrusive floral hops. There is a nice bitterness son the finish, highlighted by the clingy, carbonated mouthfeel.  Despite the strength of this beer, it is a highly drinkable session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeardedBoffin,3.95,This beer settles down in the glass with an amber/copper color and a big cap of comely foam. The aroma has bread dough characteristics balanced with some citrus hops. A slight sweetness kisses the palate in the beginning but it quickly gives way to an assault of hoppy bitterness. This is a fine beer and quite drinkable. A beer that can be enjoyed year round.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,LunaChick,4,"What a yummy and well balanced beer.  Very sweet aroma thick with malts and hints of fruits. Slight ting of alcohol in the very back of the nose. Pours hazy golden color with a quick fizz and minimal ring around the glass. Flavor is very sweet malts that go from caramel flavor to more sweet fruit as it warms. A very nice hop balance kicks in with just the right amount of ""bite"" to clean the sweetness. Towards the end some alchol warmth kicks in but is not obvious. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated this beer is very smooth in the mouth. Good drinkability due to the great balance of flavors.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,JBuff41413,4.02,"This is my first beer from Rogue Brewery and I didn't know what to expect. So here is my review.  A- Poured a cloudy light amber-orange color with 1 inch of white head. The head dissipated to about 3/8 inch. The lacing on the glass was decent but nothing to brag about,  S- Lots of bread and yeast along with sweet malts and just a faint hint of citrus.  T- As the smell warned, lots of bread and yeast along with large amounts of caramel malts. Very little hops were noticed. It was definitely unbalanced with more malts than hops....but in this beer it worked great!! The citrus I picked up on in the smell was nowhere to be found.  M- Medium heavy mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation.  D- Farly drinkable beer. I wouldn't recommend it for a session beer, non the less I could down a couple.  Now that I've had this beer from Rogue I'll have to try them all!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,vickersspitfire,4.18,"Poured into a pilsner and got a light amber color beer with a light tan head that was about two and a half fingers thick and slowly thinned out. The body is crystal clear with some mild carbonation in the center. There are some strong dark fruit aromas mixed in with some hops and a hint of apples, there is a slight sour aroma but I can't quite place it. It has a smooth hoppy flavor up front, sweet over all and slightly bitter on the side of your tongue, it has some roasted malt flavors as you swallow it. It has a medium body with a very slight carbonation fell to it. It is pretty smooth over all and goes down pretty easily.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,everetends,3.48,"12 oz bottle I purchased at the Crimson Tiger bar in Anniston, AL. Poured into a mug.  A: Poured a really interesting milky amber color. I say milky because as it sits there it looks thick and has a white tinge to the color within the amber. Got a somewhat decent half finger of white head that didn't have amazing retention. Receded down to a ring that put up a fight in laces arena, left its mark but it wasn't art.  S: Smell is some lightly roasted malt, yeast, and citrus hops. It is simple but it works. All of the aromas are pleasant and well balanced. Nothing really dominates anything else and I see this as a plus. Pretty nice.  T: Sweet, bready malt is the showstopper here. Not bad. Citrus hops are present but not that far out of the shadows. It does cut the malt a bit and add a more citrus/bitter presence to the sweetness of the malt.  M: Medium bodied brew. Incredibly refreshing. The carbonation is damned near perfect. This is a pretty smooth brew that finishes just a touch dry. The aftertaste is of slight citrus sourness.  D: This beer is nice but its not blowing me away in any sense of the word. I will drink again if offered but I am not going to go out of my way to track it down.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ckaufman,4.05,"A true classic in micros... in my opinion!  Orange/amber in color with a slight haziness. Average head volume with nice lacing and retention. The malts and hops battle it out in the nose, but the smell of malts ultimately win out. The opposite is true for taste. The malts and hops battle once again, however the hops win here in the taste department! This beer always seems a little on the thin side for me, but the carbonation still stimulates the palate. I give this beer a ""session"" rating. This is a beer you can drink all night long and not get bored!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,JRed,3.85,"Beautiful honey color complimented by a nice, off-white head. Smells of alcohol and honey battling for supremacy.

132,355,mrkc,3.48,"The pour is thin, forming a cloudy copper brown brew with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Odour lacks complexity, with a sharp, citrus element. The hops are present, but not prominent. The taste is fairly omnidirectional, with the aforementioned citrus zing, and a light bitterness to finish. The body is light, and tends not to linger on the pallet. The beer is fairly sweet, though more in a fruit sense than saccharine. It drinks easily, and with its alcohol content, refuses to be a heady beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Hullabaloo2,3.77,Aroma - Strong malty flavor. I get honey notes along with some fruit esters. Little to no hop aroma.  Appearance - Slightly cloudy dark amber color with an eggshell colored head. The head poured only about a 1/2 finger width. It then dissipated to just a ring around the edge of the glass.  Taste - Strong malt profile. Lightly toasty with melanoidins. Very low hop bitterness/flavor. Somewhat dry. Balance is more on the malt side.  Mouthfeel - Medium body with low carbonation. Fairly smooth. Somewhat dry with a slight hint of alcohol on the finish. No perceived bitterness.  Overall Impression - The malt profile of this beer is quite nice. It's a solid beer that's pretty drinkable. They used a pretty clean yeast. I detect no diacetyl or DMS.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S- spicy, still focused on the malts. has a light fruity character. pretty mellowed, not as good as the original, but still very solid  T- while i think that dead guy is good, i think the aging actually worked out really well for it. my main complaint in the fresh form is that its a little too spicy on the malt. the spice has (what i would call) perfectly mellowed giving this beer a superb smoothness and maltiness all over. the hop character has faded a bit, but its still pretty crisp and keeps a lighter hop character.

Taste: Yeast, malts, and dried fruit (prunes?) that then get balanced out nicely by hops. The bitterness from the hops only comes through in the aftertaste, but does not last long. This is a great tasting beer.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy and carbonated feeling. The beer leaves the mouth feeling a little dry.  Drinkability: Endlessly drinkable.

The scent is sweet and has a slight hop spice followed by supple caramel and toffee. A nose that is very pleasing but a little light for my taste.  A soft palate that has a strong yet sweet malt backbone. Light and smooth on the tongue there is a nothing remotely offensive about this beer. The hops are one step above nonexistent.

There is a white medium sized head that forms and soon dissipates to a white film, zero lacing is left on my glass and a steady stream of carbonation works it's way up to the top. The aroma is nice easily detected but not too strong which primarily consists of delectable sweet malts. Very pleasant and appealing the scent lured me into a balanced flavor of sweet malts.

Smells of sweet carmallized malt, a touch of honey as well as hints of spicey hop, and overripe citrus. Taste is very sweet carmelled malt, with hints of the citrus I smelled and a slight bitter hop finish. Overall it has a medium mouth feel with light carbonation and allthough the scales are tipped pretty far to the malt side of things it still comes off as very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some hints of caramel as well. Nice nose on this beer.  T & M: Taste is mildly hoppy but not overwhelming. I haven't had any other Maibocks before so I don't have a lot of comparison but I enjoyed the slight kick but also the creaminess that this brew has. The mouthfeel is creamy, leaves some maltiness behind.  D: Definitely drinkable, I have yet to be disappointed in any Rogue that I've had thus far. I will say I'm not a big fan of paying $5.50 for the bomber but this brew is worth it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The taste was of hops, well balanced, not to bitter, and a caught of hint of caramel. It had an excellent texture. It was a hot afternoon sitting outside, and I had a number of them. I didn't think it was to heavy, and recommend it as a session beer. Overall I enjoyed this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Drinkability is good, pairs well with pasta.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Reanimator,4.1,"Very delicious, but not having any other maibocks under my belt to compare it to I'll rate it a tad lower for the sake of future comparison.  Hazy, dark orange with some red hues - very much the ""honey"" color that the Rogue website describes it as - with a malty, spicy hop, orange-rindy aroma.  This is going to be strange, but the flavor works its way very slowly into your tongue. There really isn't much flavor initially, but then some pinier hops kick in and linger on top of a fully malted undertone for a smooth balance of maltiness and hoptitude, and just enough alcohol on the finish to remind you of the 6.5%.  If I didn't know it was supposed to be a bock I would've simply thought it was a maltier attempt at an APA. Highly drinkable!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S: A very sweet malty aroma with a spiced aroma and hops in the background.  T&M: Tons of sweet malts initially that are then strongly bittered by spicy hops midway before giving way to a balanced, lightly drying finish. A very intriguing flavor progression on the palate. It's medium bodied with a spicy hoppiness present in the flavor profile.  D: Everyday...Love it. The higher abv content makes it good for me.

The head was thick and slightly tan, leaving heavy lacing on the side of the glass. Great head retention.  The smell started out very hoppy, almost like an IPA, but then as it warmed, became a little sweeter and fruity. My first reaction was apples, but I know that misses it a little.  I love the depth of the taste. It starts with the sweetness from the malts and that little hint of fruit. Then it slowly turns into the bitterness of the hops, but much to my surprise and pleasure, the hops never become overpowering.  Blown away by this beer and its complexity.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell - doesnt really smell like beer almost like a faint passion fruit smell, i really like it, smels fruity and mild, hits of raisins?  Taste - at first wasnt sure then sipped a little more, wow! various different flavors, faint hops, orange and citrus, a hint of melon and melon and citrus in the aftertaste. very nice and unique, very good.

132,355,oneeye,4,"Poured into a pint glass.  Pours an amber/copper that leaves a two fingered soapy head. As the head disipatates it leaves behind sticky lacing that clings then dries and clings to the glass. The aroma is of malts and dried fruits. Earthy hops and caramel come through as well. The taste is similar to the aroma. Strong malty caramel upfront that dominates and an earthness of hops and dried fruit. It's not too bitter nor it's not too sweet. The mouthfeel is slick,thick, and creamy. Dead Guy Ale is good to the last drop. As it warms the flavors are more pronounced. I can't believe the abv is 6.5. This beer goes down easy and finishes smooth. Recommended!!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,CanuckRover,4.1,"Pours a clear dark amber. Big sea foam head. Well marked lacings.  Beautifully intertwined malt and hop characters on the nose. Fresh baked bread and caramel, but with a contrasting American hop presence.  As a malt guy, I sometimes find it hard to find a brew that uses American hops like cascade that provide me with the balance I enjoy. Dead Guy achieves this balance perfectly. A faint caramel sweetness, and slightly grainy malt, with some warming alcohol, come up pretty hard against some serious bittering hops, I believe they're pearle, very herby, while cascades provide that refreshing zing. Nonetheless, it works overall.  Great mouthfeel, creamy smooth and subdued carbonation.  A very drinkable beer, I'll buy more of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Very drinkable any time of year.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Reagan1984,4.3,"Poured this beer from it's bottle and I just fell in love with the color. It was a bright orange/amber color that almost resembled honey. There was a thin slightly off white head that appeared for a moment then receded. No visible carbonation was evident and the ale had a slight haze to it. No amount of lacing remained in the glass.  Aroma was fruity, caramel and of roasted malt. Slightly sweet in nature.  I really enjoyed the flavor of this beer and found the flavor rather deep. Obviously, some of the same characteristics from the aroma were present. There was a nice subtle fruitiness to the beer that reminded me of fresh peaches that went along with the caramel/molasses coming from the malt. (Does not taste like a fruit beer)  The balance from front to back was excellent. There were just enough hops to provide a little punch, but they did not interfere with all the other flavors going on. A nice complex flavor.  This is the type of beer where I became sad I was nearing the bottom of my glass. I savored the last few sips and cursed the fact that I had promised myself only one beer with dinner.  Rogue Dead Guy, I'll be back. We will meet again.  Excellent beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,johannasclimacus,4.55,"Awesome beer. I was a bit worried that I might have had my expectations too high in advance of getting this. A friend and I thought we found a great deal on a case of it at his local distributor, but waited on buying one for a few weeks because we had no room in the fridge. Well, we finally bought a case today, and ended up paying the higher price, which was disappointing, but the 40 dollars is about the norm for something like Rogue around here.  Anyways, the beer did not disappoint at all, despite the higher price and the long wait. Just a dynamite combination of hops and malt that gets even better as you keep drinking and the beer warms up a little. We're already down a six pack, and I took a few home to enjoy on my own. I don't expect this case to last very long, and I imagine this will soon become a staple for us, like Penn Pilsner and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  I like everything about this brew. A+ for the folks at Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,RothenbergXXX,4.18,"The T-Shirt says 'Gratefully Dedicated to the Rogue in Each of Us.' After winding up amidst a crowd to which a rogue like me clearly did not belong, one of beer chuggers, pong-players, and Coors drinkers, it sure is nice to come home to an old favorite of mine.  Dead Guy is an 'ale' that looks the way an ale ought to look; golden orange and semi-opaque. There's lacing on the glass but little head to match, revealing hops and alcohol to be key in this beer. A quick whiff before it goes down promises much more though, and it follows through. Pungent malts do more than just carry the piney, herbal hop flavors. The whole balance has a great duration on the pallet, slowly fading to a pleasant and unsticky hop residue. What more could one ask for in a finish. Well, possibly a touch more alcohol for balance, but hey, it's a Mailbock.  None of this is to suggest that this isn't a beer which goes down smooth. Wet and slippery in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation to keep it alive. It's intoxicatingly drinkable for something so hoppy and bock like. Perfect for when you need or want something to fall back to. Thanks again, Rogue, you've sure created a classic.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Contagion,3.68,"This beer pours a slightly cloudy honey color. Light passes through it, but you can't clearly make out objects on the other side of a standard pint glass. When poured there is a 2-inch ivory colored head that quickly dissipates with decent lacing that fades after about 10 minutes.  It smells of both roasted and sweet malt with a slight scent of fruity hops. There is just a hint of alcohol to it. To be honest the smell is not the most enticing, but it doesn't turn one away. The flavor has a strong malt backbone to it with a nice hop finish. As the beer warms up it becomes kind of dry and the hops are more present. It tasted much better when it was cold right out of the fridge, as it warms up it looses it pleasantness. The after taste also gets stronger as the beer warms. When I started drinking it, it wasn't bad, I have about 4 ounces left and I'm not as anxious to take a sip.  It has a medium body that is a little rough in the mouth and sticky in the throat. It leaves a mild coating that can be distracting. It's a decent anytime beer, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Nizinski,4.45,"Poured into a pint glass from a cold bottle. Looks dark yellow, a bit redish and cloudy. Made a good sized head, dissappeared fairly quickly leaving a little to stay on top the whole beer. Smells like hops mostly that I can tell. The taste is good, a bit bitter and you can taste the hops but that is a good thing.  I would take a 6 pack (or 12) of these over any AB product any day. This just tastes good, I cant pinpoint all the flavors yet but its very very flavorful. A good malty aftertaste for me. This is probly the first beer I have that I could easily just grab a 6 pack and be good on just this. Props to Rogue for making a flavorful beer.

Malty fruits with a bitter finish. Lighter mouth, mildly effervescent. Crisp, clean & smooth.  I prefer a fuller bodied beer...BUT, the 6.5 ABV did the trick on a lazy summer afternoon.

Malty with a whiff of molasses with some prickly hops and green tea. A bit earthy.  Taste is sweetly caramel with a dry biscuity bitterness in the backbone, with lightly fruity flavors and a tangy bitter-herb hop bite. Juicy apple and pear emerge as the drink warms a bit, as does a note of burnt coffee.  Extremely smooth and drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug, it produced a hazy, looked like apple cider, appearance, with a white thick head that dissolved fairly quick. The aroma was malt with a health hint of apple. The taste was unique. The apple really came out, which provided some sweetness, along with a nice malt and hop combination.

132,355,Dalem,3.75,"Shiny copper with a bit of murk in color and a moderate head that hangs tight for a minute or two before vanishing. A very scrumptious malty, nutty and caramel aroma. A sweet and creamy toasty malt thing is the first thing noticed in the taste. Not too sweet though because a hop bitterness balances it out. Neither dominate the flavor but compliment each other in a nice complexity. The caramel nuances don't take away from the hop bite nor from the malt roast but add the the overall flavor. A great blend that leaves a slightly dry but mostly soothing feeling in the throat.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This beer pours an amber/dark amber color with about a 1 finger head that disappears relatively quickly. The taste of this beer is more unique than most beers. It blends a sweet flavor that also mixes with a bit of bitterness. This beer has flavor and drinkability.

Kind of fruity with the hop aroma, but earthy too.  T- Light and pleasantly malty; a fresh tone to this taste. Whatever grains were used tastes to me kinda like cereal. The bittering hop counterbalances most of the malt backing, but they still come through on the end. Just a tad nutty and roasty.  M- Thin in the mouth and high carbonation.

Some nice butteriness. Some grassy cereal notes, but very faint and not enough to complain about.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing offensive either. Since I seem to always use my local brewer, Sweetwater, as a yardstick...Better than a Sweetwater 420 but not as good as their superlative IPA.

132,355,ccrida,3.2,"On draught at their PDX pub, poured into a pils glass, Dead Guy is a hazy Bronze with a very small, bone colored head that leaves heavy lace. Served cold.  Smell is malt and diacetyl, moderate strength and pretty good, not as sweet as most mai bocks.  Taste is very strong malt flavor, a big toffee bite that I don't recall. I just recently was recommended to try this on draught, in that it was supposedly much better, and I have to say, I think they were right. Way more depth of flavor then I recall from my previous, infrequent visits to this brew. I know, I know, bad for an Oregonian, but honestly, I haven't had it since I moved here, as I always thought it was a fake 'bock' due to the ale yeast. Still, the malt is a bit rich for my taste, too thick for the body, the diacetyl is tasty but a bit overwhelming, although the finish is clean. I'll bump this richer, fresh from the source draught a 1/2 point above the bottles, but it's still not my thrill.  Mouthfeel is average for a mai bock (a bit thicker and under-attenuated, especially for a lager), a bit on the still side.  Drinkability is ok, but even this much richer draught version still isn't really my cup of tea, just a bit to thick, I still think this one is lacking the crispness of a lager yeast that a bock mandates.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

N: Caramel with other malts backing it up. No apparent hops. Bread.  T: Complex bread flavors. This is what I think of as an epitome of a balanced beer- the malts of this bock style do not overbear and for a hophead like myself, I appreciate the character this one has. Sweetness is faint and their is a fruity piece to it. Complex.  M: Creamy and malty. Bready and coating.

Finishes even and leaves no bitter after taste. A hearty tasting beer that does not feel heavy.  D- I picked up this beer after reading plenty of articles about it. Although not a big Maibock fan or even well versed in this particular style I found this beer to be very easy to consume and enjoyable. A beautiful looking beer that went down well and tasted great. I am definately glad I gave this beer a shot and would certainly get this again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Saunapoika,3.72,"A: Somewhat cloudy, deep golden amber with a quickly receding one finger head.  S: Malty, fruitiness, almost a hint of banana in there. A strange hoppiness as well.  T: I like Dead Guy out of the tap instead of the bottle. Taste was quite good though. Sweetness, banana, syrup flavor to it with a bitter bite in the end.  M: A little overcarbonated out of the bottle. I think that is why I like the tap better.  D: Good. I like this beer on a hot day. Have to pace yourself since the 6.5% can get you when you're not looking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BamaBeerBuff,3.77,"A: Pours a light coppery-orange with a dense one-finger head that is white with a slight orange tint in appearance that leaves very little lacing on the glass.  S: A very sweet malty aroma with a slight spiced aroma and a hint of slight hops in the background. A very interesting and complex aroma.  T&M: Tons of sweet malts initially that are then strongly bittered by spicy hops midway before giving way to a balanced, lightly drying finish. A very intriguing flavor progression on the palate from this one. It's medium bodied with an oily mouthfeel and carbonation that accents some of the spicy hoppiness present in the flavor profile.  D: Fairly drinkable, but perhaps a bit too sweet to be sessionable for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,sbe1,4.15,"Appearance: cloudy copper color that looks great under the light, foamy cappuccino head with thin, quickly dissipating lace clinging to the glass.  Smell: malt, maple syrup, caramel, hop spice.  Taste: smooth with hop bite, malty with a relatively clean finish.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied, refreshing, light carbonation, but with a hop sizzle on the tongue.  Drinkability: very good, would make a fine hoppy session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,LoboLikesBeer,4.08,"A: Impressive ""glow in the dark"" silkscreen label. No locatable freshness date apparent. Poured aggressively into European style pint glass, wonderful 2 finger light tan head, sticking around for a while and also sticking all the way down the glass keeping a skim coat head till the bottom. Beautiful, deep honey color, a small swirl easily regenerates even more head. Defiantly a sexy beer.  S: Sweet maltyness apparent right up front, for sure malt is the dominate nose but as it warmed there were some subtle detectable citrus hop nuances, orange in particular. Very pleasant but subtle, much more apparent as the beer warmed.  T: Again malt in the drivers seat, not so much sweet, more smooth and buttery as it warms the hops fill in with a nice mild bitterness and slightly floral. Actually a fairly complex flavor, with prominent malt balanced fairly well by subtle hoppyness, quite delicious.  M: Great motuhefeel, medium carbonation with a silky smooth body, buttery and full but not to sticky, with a wonderfully tight skim coat head adding to the creaminess, it defiantly goes down smooth and pleasurable.  D: Appropriately for a Maibock, sampled in May. Fairly complex malt with a nice hop touch. Moderate ABV for the style and structured well, overall very drinkable and certainly a looker. I like it, just a tad pricey for a session, $6.00 a bomber in my area, if someone else picked up the tab I'd drink it all night.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S-Very floral sweet smell, also has hints of some sweet fruits (bannana most apparent) and hops. T-Almost exactly like the smell very smooth with little to no overwhelming flavors they all blend very well. M-Great carbonation level goes down very easy leaving just the right about of bitterness behind. D-This could be an everyday brew for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,josiahschlender,3.46,"The pretty amber color is a stark contrast from the somewhat sinister label. Adequate head with moderate lacing.  I notice mostly sweet malts on the nose, with a bit of the lagery nose that is distinct to me, but I haven't figured out how to clearly describe it. Different from the typical amber ale... because this beer is a lager and not an ale! Quite surprising to me to find that out after drinking my fair share. The nose has just a bit of faint hops, but pretty subdued to me.  Taste is pleasing and full, but lacks the special oomph that I expect after sampling so many great Rogue brews. Great malt profile that is both caramel sweet and whole-grain substantial. Again, I noted a slight difference due to the maibock style that is subtle, but sets this beer apart from many others. Hops balance things well, but are surprisingly restrained for a Rogue brew. Feel is full an creamy, well done.  Overall, a very enjoyable beer. However, so are many other amber-style beers. Huge props for going the different route and brewing a Maibock instead of the ubiquitous amber that's the ""flagship"" of so many US breweries. However, the price point doesn't justify this beer for me. I don't mind paying more for a bomber of the superb Shakespeare Stout, Brutal Bitter or many others, but it's harder to pay the Rogue premium for a beer that doesn't stand out much among a crowd of worthy ""ambers"" that run nearly 50% less. Price is usually reflected in my drinkability score, and certainly is for this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,gfreed,4,"This was my first encounter with Rogue. Pours with a pleasant aroma and produces a nice head that lasts long enough but doesn't wear out its welcome. Distinct bready aroma with enough malt to be different. Especially noticeable was the change in aroma as the beer got warmer: the breadiness went away and was replaced with some pleasant apples and bananas. Not too demanding, and fizzy enough to be a good summer beer. Nice all around. Would definitely try others from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,stephens101,4.12,"This is turning into one of my favorite session beers. Has plenty of taste yet it's still drinkable. Can't beat that. Had this one on tap at Tapwerks in Oklahoma City. Notice it has a bit more bite on tap. Reddish orange brew. Bartender filled it to the rim, so there's no head. No complaints here. Smells hoppy and citrusy with a slight sweet malt essence in the background. Tastes of oranges and a perfect mix of hops and malts with some florals hiding out. There's a bit of chalkiness to it as well. Tasty and very drinkable. This one always leaves me satisfied.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A - Honey in color with a one finger head that doesn't retain for very long  S - The sweet malts are really prominent, with hops and alcohol in the background. Pretty neat color. Slightly hazy  T - Like the smell, the sweet malts dominate. A bready aroma is also prominent. I can taste some butterscotch as well. A pretty awesome spicy hops finish off with the aftertaste  M - The beer seems to get sweeter the longer I hold it on my tongue. A warming affect from the alcohol is also noticeable. Slick and oily. Finishes with a clean palate. Love that spicy hop aftertaste.  D - The taste is great, but after awhile, i think the sweetness started to get to me*. Medium bodied, which limits the drink a tad.  Definitely have to pick this one up again in the future...I'm curious to see if it'll be any more drinkable the next time around. All in all, a very solid brew  *Edit: Just drank another bottle of this and thoroughly enjoyed it. Was alot more drinkable, and I loved the flavor the second time around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,lvbs,2.9,"First off, most people thought that this ""strong"" beer tasted a lot less like a typical maibock than it did like a typical ale. It lacks the springy flavor of most maibocks, and comes across with a heavy, ""good flavor."" That said, most people enjoyed it, though less than one might expect. Some thought it was ""bitter"" and just a touch overpowering, especially given its not-particularly-high ABV.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,scruffwhor,4.23,"Pours a well toasted and keenly hazey copper with just a few highlights of golden apple yellow. Great thick foam with a little lacing just above the top of the beer. The aroma is of great toasty malts with a good dollop of earthy, herbal hops. Maye a faint hint of fruits mixed in there. The taste is an upfront toast with a little light red currant jelly just tickling the outsides of the tastebuds. The middle gives a good herbal hop definiton. Finishing with slightly creamy malts and a more earthy hop tone. Very clean, earthy hop palate with a clean malt bill. Very good beer. Great hoppy maibock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TroyS,3.98,"This Rogue Dead Guy Ale by Oregon Brewing Company is very good. By the way...they made a nice showing at the Spring Beer and Wine Festival in Portland, OR. Although the chip system isn't the greatest, it's a very nice way to spend Easter weekend;)  So...Dead Guy is a tasty pour. It's a darker apricot amber ale that carries a hearty head. I like to pour em' a bit heavy and sometimes rough; this beer takes a half a hearty pouring producing a fluffy light caramel head with traces of lacing left behind as it's drank.  This beer is quite malty with a distinct alcohol tinge to it and a hint of peach. It's a drinkable beer, but I'm partial to hoppy IPA's, so maybe not the guy to ask about drinkability;) This brew has an amber haze, but is without floaties.

Citrus hops, caramel and a little oak in the nose. There is sort of a floral/lemongrass thing going on too.  Hops and grapefruit, bitter all the way through. There's a little bitter chocolate taste mixed in too. The body is pretty thick, moderately carbonated with a nice warmth coming along.

Sweet initially, then trademark Rogue big hop finish verging on slightly metallic or oxidized.  Very flat, even bottled from the brewery and sold in stores this growler didn't keep enough CO2, and that's what I was checking out.

A- The appearance is red/amber color with a slight bit less than a one finger head and a bit of lacing. Attractive carbonation action too. S- The smell is of bread and fruity hops. The malt and bread scent were a bit stronger but the fruit/hops had a definite presence. T- Perhaps this beer just caught me on the right day, but it tasted very good to me. It tastes like a mixture of dough and citrus, particularly lemon rind, or perhaps grapefruit. The hops have a definite factor here. It starts with more fruit taste and ends more bready.

132,355,drbeef,3.6,"First, I want to say first time I had this I wasn't a fan. However, it has now been in my fridge for a few weeks and it's been a tough day. So here it goes:  Hazy copper color, maybe from sitting in the fridge so long. 3/4 inch creamy head that thins but hangs around for most of the trip due to constantly being fed by rising bubbles. A little lace lingers.  Smell is pretty good. Bready on first whiff, but subsequent inhales gather more malty sweet and slight citrus hop like lemon water, but more dried fruit than anything.  Taste is way better than I remember. Either today was a really bad day or this is a pretty good brew. Malty and hoppy at first, hard to grasp specifics. Bready in the middle with a lingering spiciness, maybe, or just a citrus tingle like grapefruit? Anyway, feels good. I let it sit a bit to warm up and I think that really helped. Its smooth and... crap... I think I figured it out. The first time I had this I drank straight out the bottle. Much better in the glass. You need the sweetness to escape the bottle otherwise all I get is hop bitterness.  Easy to drink. Session beer? Probably. Not sure of the ABV but not more than 5 I'm sure. Shit, it says 6.5. I guess I can feel that but I'm still a little surprised.  First time reviewing, hope I did alright. Let me know if you think I did any injustice.  Do I recommend this?

The beer has a lot of grassy hops to it, but the roasty malts really come out if you move the beer around a bit. It has a dark roasted smell with hints of the dark fruits. The beer is pretty complex. The first taste is a toffee/chocolate flavour followed by some dark fruits like plums, then at the end it's almost a metallic tinge to it. Inside all of the flavours there is a strong grassy/alcoholic taste from the hops, which kind of takes you by surprise. The alcohol comes out more than I expected, but it's not a problem at all.

Aroma: Sweet, lightly toasted biscuity malt and crisp, floral, piney, spring-like hops. Smells slightly medicinal.  Taste: Well-balanced, although perhaps a little coarsely bitter on the finish. Grassy, floral, piney, and herbal hops dominate the ""hop half"" of this beer, lending a spicy, phenolic character. Very springy - ""May Bock"" indeed.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and loose feeling, thin but not watery.  Drinkability: Decent. A little more alcoholic than you'd expect it to be from looking at it (6.0% abv), and definitely not for everyone - the bitter, medicinal tastes can begin to wear on you after a time. It began to get to me too ... but after three, so, that's not too bad after all, I suppose.  A good beer. Maibocks are a style I haven't had much experience with, and perhaps the phenols I found slightly irksome are simply natural and maybe even desirable flavors and aromas of this style.

132,355,righlander,4.45,"Poured a cloudy amber from a 12 oz bottle. Smell was apple juice and fruity with a faint hop aroma. Taste is nice, sweet malt...but not too sweet with a mild hop finish. I really didn't know what to expect with this beer because it just says ""Ale"". But man, it was a nice balance. Sweet malt based with a well balanced hop finish. Mouth feel is wonderful. Perfectly carbonated in my opinion. The drinkability for me isn't the best though. 6.5%. I can hang with 3 at the most. I couldn't sit there and drink like 6 of these (12oz) but...I'd like to start a session with just one of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell: Yeasty malty sweetness  Taste: Sweet malt, smooth hoppy bitter finish, well balanced with a malt finish that isnt usual. some toffee, with hints of grain.  Mouthfeel, is thing even carbonation.  Drinkability: Easy to consume, but not a session beer due to its higher ABV.  I love that is lager but its fermented with a ale yeast. Steam beer gone mental. One of my favorites, and I just brewed the recipie, hopfully it turns out as good as the original.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kenito799,4.05,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  I have seen this beer out there so many times, I thought I would take the opportunity to give it a try. I don't know much about Maibocks but I can detect a kinship with Altbier, perhaps, in a certain dry toastiness to the malt, if that makes any sense. But Maibock is a lager and Alt is an ale, so it doesn't really make any sense. Whatever. I would have guessed that this is particularly nice American pale ale.  So, this coppery clear brew raises a frothy head that recedes to nothing after a short while, a few wisps of lace are left.  Aroma is predominantly malty, caramel, hints of fruitiness. On the palate there is soft carbonation and medium body, a bit sticky in the finish. Taste is much less sweet than expected from the smell...but sweetness is there, but a masterful balance of crisp hoppy bitterness, hints of spice and alcohol tingling, a constant interplay between malt and hops that keeps this substantial beer almost refreshing...not a dry thirst quencher, but invigorates the palate. This aspect makes this beer quite drinkable, even as I am licking the sweet malt of my lips, I am ready to reach for another. Great with food. Very well made brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This would make a great session beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MTNboy,3.2,Appearance: Good orange amber with gold highlights when held to the light. No head but oddly enough great lace.  Smell: Fruity hops aroma. Almost like a blend of citrus with hints of apricot.  Taste: About the same as the scent. A little hoppy and floral but no over whelming.  Mouthfeel: Watery.  Drinkability: Not bad easy going.

132,355,SirSaranac,3.9,"Well, intersting bottle... Funny thing is, I have a Lake Placid Frostbite Ale sitting in my fridge right next to it, and they blend together, sharing the EXACT same colors. ODD.  A- Pours a 1 finger head that has little retention, despite being quite frothy. The brew itself is the color of apple cider, rather cloudy, and nice carbonation. Lacing is less than desireable though.  S- Well balanced mixture of malt, hops and fruit. There's something about it that smells like freshly cut potatoes as well... I know, odd. Fruit would lean towards apple, although i'm not positive. Yeasty as well.  T/M- Malt, then a sharp hop bite... followed by the fruity outro... mildly dark fruit. In my opinion, the aftertaste reminds me of sour apple... slightly tart? It's tasty brew none the less, well balanced, yet lacking the subtle nuances to make it a world class brew.  D- Tasty brew indeed, however, the taste become a bit redundant after 2... Also, the tartness becomes a bit too dominant after the first 1. Still, I recommend trying this.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A: Poured a rich amber color with a thin white head that reduced to a few bubbles. Hazy in appearance, looks very good.  S: I can only detect a few malty aromas in this beer, some of honey, and a little bit of a caramel scent. Nothing really pops out though.  T: Very complex tasting beer, lots of different things going on. Some sweet characteristics, pretty malty, but a nice hop bitterness at the end. Once again though, nothing really pops out very well balanced though, and not offensive in the least.  M: Pretty thin, very well carbonated, nice warming too, which is surprising with the alcohol level being where its at. Not bad.  D: Quite drinkable, I'm sure I'll tip a few of these back today.

132,355,mltobin,3.63,"Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T- Mainly a sweet, slightly roasted malt flavor, with hops, and a tad of old apple cider. I began to develop an aftertaste of bitter tea... I didn't really enjoy that.  M- Nothing notable... light carbonation.  D- It was pretty good, although the aftertaste slowed me down towards the end of the beer.  Overall decent, I may give this one another shot someday.

Scent is of sweet caramel malt and citrusy hops.  Taste is similar with sweet caramel and a great citrus hop flavor that is only slightly bitter.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and brightly carbonated.

132,355,Gmann,3.88,"Pours a bright hazy brown color with a nice egg-shell colored head that dissipated quickly into a slight cap, leaving some spotty lacing on the glass. The smell is of bready/doughy Munchen malt, with a floral honey aroma. The taste upfront is of the doughy Munich malt, honey, a touch of ash and bitter hop. Perhaps a very slight hint on lemon and pepper. The feel is moderate with semi-soft carbonation, finishes well balanced; slightly on the bitter side. A very nice and enjoyable ale. The sweetness of the Munich malt is offset with some bitter hops. The feel remains light thus making this a very drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,illidurit,3.91,"Poured into my Eichhof bier mug. Hazy caramel colored, with a healthy white head which leaves some spotty lacing.  Aroma is very toasty and malty, with a surprising fruity character.  Flavor is extremely smooth, with a sweet but dry maltiness and some subdued hops. The only evidence of the ale yeast here is the mild fruity ester notes. The malt profile, however, is pretty true to the German style it emulates.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and this beer is extremely easy to drink. Solid beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,johnyeast,4.2,A hazy amber in appearance with a white head. A fruity smell with a hint of honey and flower petals. Sweet in taste with a good bite from the alcohol and carbonation.

132,355,clayrock81,4,"An all-around must for beer lovers. Pours a darkish-brown w/ ruby tints with marginal head that leaves tiny amounts of lacings. A malty smell follows, although there are dark fruit smells that I picked up. A very smooth beer with a light to medium body which underlies a very malty taste. Can't tell if there are some coffee or roasted/toasted malts in there, but there is a malty sharpness. Overall it is smooth because there is some faint sweetness brought on, but this is balanced with a dryer backbite from the hops. At 6% it is just there for sessioning - buy a six-pack and chill out with this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Hoppy, earthy nose with a metallic undertone is not terribly appealing.  Flavor is relatively mild. Moderate caramel malt is well balanced with vague citrus and pepper hop notes and moderate astringency. Overall mouthfeel somewhat thin but that's okay. Goes down smoothly with lingering, lightly bitter aftertaste.  Very nice, aside from the aroma.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,AshevilleSippin,3.72,"Short Version: Not bad but less than I expected from Rogue. Malty sweetbread up front with med-light body, slight seltzery metallic twang, with mild bitter dry finish.  Details: No date on this thing so I can't tell if it's fresh or dead (pardon the pun). Picked it up as a mix-n-match sixer at the local Ingles grocery (god bless'm). Some of the ones I've gotten this way have been a little long in the tooth.  Poured a 12 into my pint glass and watched. It poured a medium-to-deep copper brown color with a 1"" sudsy/soapy looking head. The smell was strong of a warm yeasty bread dough with a sweet ripe fruit maltiness behind it. Maybe like a raisin bread. And crazy as it may sound, I'm picking up a hint of the smell you get from inside a Crayola crayon box. Just a hint but the smell-nostalgia bone was tickled for sure.  Head proved to have decent staying power and reasonable lace but nothing to write home about in the end.  Body was surprisingly on the light side of medium. Taste was malty for sure with a little bit of a seltzery metallic tone to it. Still picking up some yeasty sweetbread in the taste. A little hop action going on to keep the malt honest but not a hoppy beer by any stretch.  Finish is slightly sweet and dry and fades into a mildly bitter and astringent aftertate.  Drinkability is good. A tad sweet to throw down too many but it was tasty for sure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Appearance = one finger of head, slowly works down to beer algae; head has an off-white color; no lacing; nice carbonation (small bubbles rising); light amber color.  Smell = mild smell; can smell sweet malt and hop; a bit of alcohol; maybe a hint of passion fruit.  Taste = a very nice balance with a little bit of hops; a little bitter; a little bit of malt; a hint of honey; a hint of alcohol; a little flowery. Again, all of it in great balance. Nothing overwhelms.  Mouthfeel = smooth, medium mouthfell; can feel carbonation on tongue but not overstated.  Very nice brew. Just solid, well-balanced.

132,355,SMark,4.1,"This beer was poured into an Imperial pint glass at 52° from a 12 ounce bottle. There was no date information on the bottle. There was a little over 2 fingers of creamy white head which lasted approximately 4 minutes. A slight amount of foam stayed on the glass as the head dissipated. The beer was a very slight hazy light orange tea color.  I thought there was a hop smell with the pour but when sensing the bouquet it was more of sweet malt with hops lingering in the background.  Hops were more prevalent in the taste with the bitterness being quickly noticeable. The malt kicked in later on further tasting. It was very interesting to sense one and then the other and then vice versa.  The interesting integration of aroma and taste resulted in a successful marriage in the mouth also. There was also a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. This was rather a nice arrangement.  Overall this was a well combined effort with the senses having a go at the hops, malt, and alcohol presence. There was not a lot of lacing later on but it is still a keeper, at least for a little while.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,davidt,3.8,"Pours amber-brown, whte head drops cleanly. Aroma is dark fruits over a malt base. Flavor is toasted malt with some bitter hops coming through at the finish.

Leaves nice lace behind.  S: Quite floral. Toffee and lemongrass were what I noticed most.  T: The alcohol comes on strong, despite the beers modest ABV. Hop bitterness is very high, but not overpowering. Malt flavor is light. Bitterness lingers into a somewhat dry finish. Excellent taste, but heavy bitterness is not what I expect of a Maibock.  M: Medium-heavy body. Right amount of carbonation.  D: A little too much for me to want more than one at a time. I'd go back to this again, however.

132,355,wiseguy142,3.75,"Pours an unstable amber color with a light head that is gone within a minute. My first impression of the smell and taste is the strong taste of sweet Munich malt. It revs up your taste buds for a uphill climb into some fairly bitter hops. This is the first Maibock I've had so that was somewhat of a surprise for me. The combination of these characters lingers in your mouth for many seconds after you've had a sip and after a while you're left only with the bitter, but I was impressed with how long I was able to retain a very clear sensation of the beer. They did a great job of getting the malt character out of the beer- it's like it's breathing Munich but smoking hops- two opposing pleasures in one glass.  &lt;/metaphorzz&gt;",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S-Spice, citrus, candied fruit, American hops, and a hint of fresh dirt w/minerals. Caramel malts also shine through.  T-The soft toasted malts dominate the attack, and cede their place somewhat to the fruit-spice around mid-palate, and the finish brings out the hops and the smooth, earthy traits. A few moments later, the spice reemerges. All the flavors are soft, with none dominating, and each in a state of contained equilibrium. At any point, one flavor is more apparent than the rest, but you can taste them all to some degree. --Had to come back to edit. Now I'm picking up fresh veggies on the back of my tongue.  M-Carbonation is pretty steady, and I'm drinking this one pretty cold, and it's good. The body is on the lower end of medium, and goes well with the flavors and carbonation.

132,355,SIRIUS2,3.93,"A: Light amber in color; minimal to average head produced when poured into a pint glass from the bottle. Head faded fast but left good lacing throughout.  S: Nothing particularly special. If you swirl well you can get a hint of hops.  T: An interesting mix of hops and malts. I don't know that I would call them balanced, but definitely equal in strength. Great sweet caramel malt flavors with nice citrus hops and minimal lingering hop flavor.  M&D: On the light side of 'medium' bodied but full flavored. Even with all the flavors going on this still goes down easy and intensely enjoyable.  I tried hard to be objective reviewing this ale. I waited a long time to review it because it is one of my personal favorites. I can't put my finger on it but man, this is good! I like the maltiness but I also like that bitter citrus finish and this one has them both without being too refined.

This beer tastes just as it smells, the slight sweet, fruitiness or citrus flavors come through and the malty feel/taste bursts with each sip. Overall, this is a really good beer. You can definitely compare this to a German-bock-style beer, though it has a far bigger malt flavor and smell than anything I've had in this style. I like to smell my beer before each sip, and each time I smell this beer, I think of how grains smell in the mashing stage of brewing - filling the room with that awesome roasting grain smell.

Hoppy for the first 2-3 minutes but subsides to a toasty maltiness with a slight tinge of fruitiness and bigger than average spicy hop aroma.  Flavor mirrors the aroma, but the toasted notes are much more pronounced.. a little earth helps balance with a touch of spicy hop flavor.. the body is a solid medium with good carbonation to the last sip.  Dead Guy is a brew that I pass on nearly every time I see it at the store... ""Is it a maibock? is it not?"" It is probably a very clean malt dominant brew with a slight cold conditioning... I probably should pick it up more often, but it is sorta in my ""Fat Tire"" category..

132,355,daliandragon,3.28,"I first sampled this beer about twelve years ago when I was young and stupid and drank purely for quantity; needless to say I hated it. I'm interested to see how it does now that I have something resembling taste (at least I like to think I do).  The Dead Guy pours a lively copper with a strong orange hue at the bottom. An impressive head lasts about three minutes to capping but does leave thick, cream colored lacing. Nose reflects some faint fruits and medium malts but nothing really stands out.  A sharp hoppiness at the front of the mouth is accompanied by a less than desireable metal flavor that continues through the finish. Malt is more in the backround than I would expect and fruitiness is almost non-existant. Mouthfeel is above average but also undone by the metal.  Without the unfortunate metallic flavors this would be a quite delicious quencher and fairly sessionable.

Flavor was not especially noteable-- yes it was congenial. There was plenty of nice ale character- noted bitterness although I couldn't point out the exact hops used. Finish was clean with a smooth glide to the horizon but something was lacking.  mouthfeel was nothing to complain about.  Drinkability- I could guzzle a six-pack on the spot. The only thing I'm grousing about is that the over-all flavor could use a signature-- a wart on the miller's nose, a something that says ""ROGUE BREWERY""..

""Organic"" is a word that comes to mind, though not in the sense that it is used today. It just smells of things found in nature. Taste is very interesting. I haven't had anything quite like it before. Pretty well balanced. Malts, fruits, some vegetables, and yeast. Medium bodied and very carbonated. I've never had anything quite like this before.

I would like to have a sixer of this for the weekend.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mountdew1,3.68,"Poured into standard shaker pint glass. Color was a slightly cloudy reddish brown that has a 2 finger thick head. The head disappaited very quickly but clinged to the side and left a ring around the top. Aroma smelled hoppy with small hints of lemon and spice. Tasted clean, slightly bitter, and also oakey. Mouthfeel was good. Coated well, slightly carbonated. Went down well, and was easy to drink. Alcohol wasn't too strong.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Mild herbal hop smell.  Slightly sweet upfront, a nice caramel malt taste leads the charge. Nice bready and fruity tones with a mild hop bitterness. Some light herbal and floral hop flavors ride to the finish. Sligtly sweet finish, rathher clean.  Medium body, medium carbonation.  Always a good go-to beer when nothing else seems to satisfy.

132,355,seanyfo,4.42,"Bottle of 2004 Dead Guy Ale, cellared in dark conditions for past 4 years. Poured into imperial pint glass  A 3 finger tan creamy head that has fantastic retention, good lacing, copper caramel body.  S sweet bready malts, bock-like, with some grapefruity citrus notes. There is a spice there too, cinnamon, nutmeg????  T Lots of sweet bready malts in the start, changing to a light floral grapefruit taste in the finish, nutty in the aftertaste, wtih hints of coffee throughout. This is like Deuchars IPA meets EKU 28!  M medium carbonation, creamy, syrupy even  D Enjoyed this immensely. Superb complex array of flavours without them clashing horribly together.  I read the reviews for Dead Guy Ale before cracking it open, and obviously i am assuming here, i dont think it has lost anything, maybe a bit of carbonation? but nothing in flavour, however i wonder what the hops are like in this fresh?  As we all know an english IPA is far different from its American Counterpart. Less hop/citrussy profile and this is what i felt this was comparitive too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Nibbley,4.8,"Pours a beautiful orange/amber with a good head of off white tightly laced foam. Smells of soft fruits. Outstanding mouthful of small bubbles. Taste is very malty and hoppy at the same time, if thats possible. One of my all time favorites. Great with my local BBQ's pulled pork sandwich and slaw.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,lostdesperato,3.83,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass  Poured a slightly dark orange hue with a white foamy head that dissipated quickly  The nose was not strong but had a subtle appealing fruity odor  Heavy carbonation was a little too much for my taste  It had a very good balance of hop and malt with an almost cookie taste at the back of the tongue, very appealing.  The drinkability was good. I enjoyed the beer very much and didn't have a hard time knocking a few back.  Overall I found the balance to be very appealing. Although, the head was poor and the lacing was almost non-existent. With a stronger nose and lighter carbonation it would improve greatly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Monkeyknife,3.92,"Poured from a bottle a nice warm golden-orange with a huge, frothy off-white head.  The aroma greets the nose with bread and butter along a light citrus twang.  The taste has a good malt presence and is slightly sweet.  Moderate mouthfeel, slick to the tongue, and with average carbonation.  This one is easy to drink and more enjoyable than expected.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BigJTrucker,4,"Picked up this bottle, labeled as ""Newport Anniversary Ale"" at my local Albertsons. I've had Dead guy before and realized i've never reviewed it. It's a staple of Rogue's line, and some may choose to use the term Flagship Ale. So, here goes....  Pours a golden honey color, nice white head settles fairly quickly. You can definetly smell the malts, and some of the saaz hops at first. Taste is very sweet and malty, with just enough hops to keep it in check. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very sticky on the finish. A very well balanced, solid offering. Definetly worth a try on tap if you can find it, but the bottle is solid.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hollenbeck2,3.68,"bought this beer in a six pack at safeway, good selection here.  great color darker at the top than the bottom, cool complexity of colors.  great taste bitter like aa IPA but stronger like a winter warmer, good mix between the too.

132,355,Tilley4,3.5,"Bottle.  Orange pour with a small white head.  Smells very sweet and malty, almost like a doppelbock but not as rich.  Sweet malty taste that goes down smooth as silk. Wasn't sure that I was going to like this one but it really is pretty good.  Not sure I could drink more than one or two at a time due to the sweetness, but a very good tasting beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AlesALot,3.96,"This is a good, drinkable beer. I like it much better with the yeast mixed in ala hefe-weizen. It seems to lack a bit with out the yeast for my taste.

A great beer for the beer impaired to be introduced to the good things in life.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,cdkrenz,3.82,"This is another gift given to me by my friend Heather Bidwell.  Appearance - Crisp orange pour into a hazy pale brownish-orange body. The head is just a thin layer and ranges from medium to light brown in color.  Smell - From the bottle the aroma is malt and a subtle wave of citrus.  Taste - The flavor is not what I had expected it to be. It tastes like an English pale ale with more malt. It has a firm long lasting hop flavor that really sets a positive tone. The flavor is solid.  Mouthfeel - The texture is a bit coarse after beginning somewhat smooth.  ~ I would really love a six pack of these bones after a hard day of mountain biking. Two for me, two for my riding partner, and one for each of us on the ride home. Oops, did I say that? Maybe that's how it got its name?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Ineedabeerhere,3.62,"pours a golden orange color, very small head.  continuing with rogue's reputation for over-hopping their beers, this mailbock is rather hoppy (at least for the style), with citrus and piney aromas.  Great smooth taste, very crisp, a little fruity-ness, carbonation it on point, and the amount of bitterness is balanced for this style.  It is very drinkable, and balanced, my only concern is the price- it was a 9.99 six pack at my local store. Personally, i would rather go for a DFH 90min 4pk for the same price- and im sure you could find something in the same style range for a lesser price. Nonetheless, i would try it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,currysage1,4.15,"Poured a caramel amber color, with not much head which dissipated quickly and decent lacing.  Smell is a great mix of citrus, hops, and malt. Not too strong though, very subtle.  The taste on the other hand is not very subtle, at first sip the hops hit the front of your toungue then the sides, but goes away very quickly. Then a quick flash of maltiness, with alot of full grain flavour. Then back to the maltiness to round out the experience.  The mouth feel is nice, somewhat smooth but has a little lingering film, but does not have that oily sort of feel to it. I find that the maltier the beer typically you get more of this.  Drinkability wise, I can have two or three of these and be fine. I like a beer thats not too heavy by volume, this way I can have 6 or so if I feel like it, not 2 and be put to bed.  Great brew - Try the Russian Imperial Stout, it will blow your mind.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,gwong,3.88,A: A nice amber/copper color with little head with some lacing.  S: A slight hoppy aroma but it's very faint.  T: There's a slight hint of citrus but the flavor is mostly a combination of hops and malts - it's a very solid combination.  M: Very smooth with enough carbonation to make for a good finish.  D: A highly drinkable session beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WillieMoe,3.8,"Has an amber orange hue and is a bit cloudy.  The spell is of a woody piney hop, amd has a mild citrus scent.

Definitely a drinkable brew from the fine brewers at Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bags6lax,3.57,"I have been wanting to try this one out, after a few recommendations...  Poured, a light copper color, little to no head.  Smelled very citrusy, with a good amount of hop aroma up front, but it quickly went away.  Unbelievably smooth to drink, with just the right touch of bitterness.  My overall impression, was this was just an excellent brew to drink, nothing fancy, but just very well balanced, and what was definitely weird about it, was the flavors seemed to shift as the beer warmed up, becoming a little sweeter, and more malt flavor coming through. Definitely a beer I'd buy again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ElGrecoVerde,3.95,"I was going to say it was an amber color. Then I read the review below calling it copper. Gotta agree with that.  Smelled sweet and dry, if that's possible.  It also tasted sweet, but not overly so. It was more like mild fruits, with some bittersweet flavors usually found in darker beers.  It was smoother than I expected, and easy to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,avalon07,3.33,"The appearance was very nice, with an off amber color. The smell was somewhat above average, never really overwhelming at any point. The mouthfeel was fairly lively and carbonated. I'd never tried a maibock style beer and didn't know what to expect. It had an overly tart, malty taste to it, that didn't really cut it for me. Overall, it's an okay beer, not something to add to a list of favorites.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

D: I've been drinking this for a while now, this is the first time that I've actually ventured to review it. It was one of the first truly good beers that I recognized as a young drinker, and I'm sure I'll be sipping on it for years to come. Great balance, nice crisp character.

132,355,younger35,3.63,"Picked up a bomber of this on my trip to Newport over Labor Day. Drank under the alias of Newport 125th Anniversary Ale out of my Legends (bar) glass.  Appearance- Pours an orange/amber with a nice fluffy bone white head. Leaves a great sticky cap and collar and plenty o lace. Smell- Very nice maltiness that is very bready and raw. Has a semi sweetness from the malt and is very surprisingly fruity. Nice clean lemon background with tinges of oranges. Taste- Like the nose its full of raw grainy malts that are slightly toasted and slightly sweet. Definitely a nice balance with a solid bitter backbone that is rather fruity. Hints of grapefruit and lemon zest linger along with a raw nuttiness. Mouthfeel- Lightly medium body with a nice zesty carbonation. Drinkability- Ive had this brew many times. Im assuming the Anniversary is the same as the Dead Guy but for some reason this seems a bit more fruity (probably just in my head). Its a solid brew that is good every time, anytime. On a side note, when I make chili I use either a bomber of Dead Guy Ale or Chipotle Ale every time. Great beer for cooking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,madjr80,4.4,"Poured into a tapered glass. thick head of foam that settles into a creamy lace. Dark honey like color, and sweet smelling. Not very hoppy right off that the bat, but has a nice little bite at the end. Very drinkable and smooth. This is both a great sipping and session beer. At about 10 bucks a six pack, you wouldn't want to just guzzle this stuff down. Great stuff!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,PhageLab,3.55,"Somewhat of a legend when it comes to recognizable bottle art. Oddly enough, this is my first time ever trying one, even though I've seen it around for many years. Poured into a standard pint glass.  A - Amber colored brew which produced a decent bit of head and held up strong. A little bit of lacing stuck around as well.  S - Sweet alcohol on the nose, and maybe some citrus notes.  T - Warm, spicy hop profile which is very soothing. Easily agreeable all around. Balanced and just sweet enough to round it off.  M - Decent, light bodied, slight spicy aftertaste. No residues, but the seemingly high level of carbonation caused a hit here.  D - Not bad at all, I would accept one of these anytime. I'm new to the style but this was a very drinkable brew. So it seems I'm 2 for 2 as both the Maibocks I've had have been very tasty. Try this one out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Slynger,4.33,"Pours an clear amber color which lightens into gold around the edges of my glass. It has a big off-white head that leaves sticky lace. Looks damn good for a dead guy. The nose is gentle but distinct. Slightly sweet with caramel malts along with light biscuit maltiness and some earthy spicy hops. A tea-like sweetness accompanies sweet caramel malts and biscuit malts. Piney hops and earthy-tea provide a light bitterness that lingers for a bit in the dry finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with enough carbonation to make it soft and creamy.  This the first Rogue beer that I ever tasted and the one that sparked my movement away from light Macro Brews and into the good stuff. I had not had it since and just got into reviewing, but now I remember why the movement began. This is a great beer that should be stocked in every fridge at all times.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A very earthy, muddy, aroma, with hints of caramel malt. Rich and creamy tasting, somewhat sweet as well. Slightly dry, with a roasted burnt malt taste. Long lingering aftertaste. Heavy in the mouth, a little to much for a considered ale. I did enjoy this beer, I was hoping to rate it better, but I will try it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,whiplash3825,3.93,"Moderate pour overflowed the glass with more head than beer... obviously this is a lively one! Looks just like honey in color, and slightly cloudy. Lots of lacing.  Nice balance of smells... citrusy floral hops are obvious, but with a strong malt backbone. Ripe fruit also in the nose with mild but noticable alcohol.  Tastes damn balanced! Fruity, citrusy and grassy hops... biscuity malts with caramel in there. My first maibock, this reminds me of an IPA with a stronger malt presence.  Mouthfeel is luxurious! Thick, fluffy carbonation is just about perfect.  No problems with drinkability, as I could drink this all night long. It's the third time I've used the word, but the key here is balance.

Taste is great with an amazing balance of hops and malt, perfect aftertaste too.  Mouthfeel though is a bit weird, a bit too buttery for me. Leaves a slickness in the mouth long after drinking, while not entirely off-putting at first, it could hinder in multiple drinks.

Heavy alcohol scent backed by a dry ale-malt smell. Citrusy to balance heavy alcohol. Good stuff.  Major blast of citrus (orange) and apricot flavor, with a strong alcohol flavor that is offset by the dry, bready malt. Strong but balanced, not overdone. A real strong ale, no extreme beer fetish.

132,355,tsbuttry,4.48,"This is my first review for this site, and I'm doing an old standby of mine. While there may be better beers out there, I keep coming back to this beer because of its overall quality and general availability.  Appearance: A solid amber color with excellent head retention. You can tell from the appearance that you're getting a lot of caramel malts, which is always a good thing.  Smell: It has a good aroma, but it's oddly weak for how good the taste is. Vaguely fruity (obviously from one of the many hop breeds from the pacific northwest) with a subtle floral scent.  Taste: This is where the beer shines. Strong malt and hop flavor, in good balance. Not so malty as to leave an aftertaste, not so hoppy as to annhilate the malt flavor. Excellent blend of sweetness and bitterness.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer plays quite well on the mouth with enough hops to keep a clean palate. Carbonation is there, but doesn't distract. However, it is a strong, full beer that is best rounding out a meal or having one or two during a ballgame. Not a great session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

It presents itself nicely, with two fingers of head atop an amber-copper body in a pint glass. The nose was malty, and I detected a hint of chocolate, but little else appeared. The taste was subtle but smooth. But I was disappointed since the malt was clear, and some spice was present--ginger, paprika--but little else. I was hoping for bolder flavors, but was left wanting. The texture was smooth, and ordering a second sure wasn't difficult. Overall, worth a try and a nice brew, but nothing that will knock the socks off.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

In case that review never reappears, I figured I'd pull out my notes and at least get it in now.  12-oz bottle poured into a pint glass. I liked this quite a bit. A good solid, all around beer. Frankly, I have gotten into a rut where I drink mostly IPAs or similar highly hopped beers (barleywines, etc.) and had forgotten how much I like Maibocks.  A = Good frothy head from a somewhat robust pour. light lacing, cloudy reddish, amber, nice continuous carbonation bubbles.  S = Very well balanced blend of sweet malt and hops scents. Citrus, lemongrass and honey all come through.  T = I hesitate to say salty because that sounds wrong (perhaps umami is more correct?), but it is a very pleasant subtle taste on top of a good roasted character of malt, hay. A nice earthy, but not overly so, flavor. It makes me think of a country, summer festival.  M = A little thin, pleasant amount of carbonation which nicely tickles the tongue.  D = Great beer to just sit back and enjoy; a good all around beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ThatWineGuy,4.25,"I had this under the Jazz Guy label but biegaman who brought it back from California for me assured me it was really Dead Guy, thanks, Jan.  The bottle gushed on opening with amber colour and vigourous carbonation. Solid beige, off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smells hoppy but with a lot of caramel roasted malt too, the smell is apparent even before pouring. The taste is similarly two dimensional: hops and caramel-roast taffy. There is a smooth, buttery mouthfeel. This is a nice drinking ale with a nice, even keel ... the hoppy bitterness is balanced perfectly with malt, a real taste treat and another winner from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,scottyshades,4.15,"Picked up a 6er at Publix in Boca Raton for around $7. I have only had one Rogue beer before this one (Mocha Porter) and that was really good so I figured Id give this guy a try A: Pours a nice orangish/copper color with some amber tones in the light...very appetizing. The most impressive aspect of its appearance is the nice two-finger head that is a strange orange color that leaves a decent lace on the glass (at this point I have high hopes)  S: The nose consists of bubble gum (delicious smell), sweet malts, caramel, a bunch of fruits, and some slight hops...I had six attempts to figure out which fruits are in this beer, but for some reason I couldnt determine what they were  T: Bubble gum, very fruity followed by a very good balance of hops and malts. Lots of honey and pale malt flavors. Hops are not readily noticeable, but lend a small bitter bite.  MF: Very very clean...not very bitter, which in my mind accentuates the fruity aftertaste  D: One of the most drinkable beers I have had...there is a fair amount of alcohol in this one, but not noticeable...I cruised thru the 6er and cannot wait to get another one  Overall, this is an amazing beer! Recommended for every kind of drinker...An excellent BMC ""converter beer"" those those friends with lesser palates  EDIT: Tried the growler version of this (found on a shelf- no clue how old it could be) but seemed to have less hop presence, more malts, more honey, and more light fruits (apples, peaches, concord grapes). The carbonation was very low. I am assuming that the growler had been sitting there for months, but it still tasted excellent in its own way.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,KI9A,3.83,"After passing this by several times, I picked a bottle up. Wow, I'm glad I did. Pours deep amber, with decent head. Smells of a bit, well, can't really tell. But, the taste..nice. Hops, malty, dark fruits, and maybe a very slight bananna finish. Someone mentioned it became better as they went thru it, and I agree. As i finished the bottle ( in a tulip glass), I sure wish I had another. And, I will.  Nice job!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AylwinForbes,4.1,"Delighted to find this offering from our favourite Oregon on offer at the local. It's not in our favourite IPA category, but it is a great all-round beer nonetheless. Coppery-red colour with a slight haze and a moderate head. Aroma is fairly muted but the palate glows with complex fruit and malt and caramel. It's a bit chewy and very quaffable, although I note a fairly robust 6.5 % alcohol level.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,wagenvolks,4.11,"On tap at a local sports pub...  Man, I'd forgotten how good Dead Guy is. This is one of the quintessential microbrewered beers, arguable introducing more drinkers to the craft scene than any other...and for good reason.  The body displays an attractive ruby/amber/copper hue, a bit hazy with a decent carbonation level. The head is small (as it was poured from a tap) but is extremely well-retained and leaves sticky, webbed lacing down the upper third of the glass. Aroma is difficult to detect, partly because of the bar scene, but mainly because Dead Guy never really gives off much of an aroma in my experiences. Fruity yeasts, light citrusy hops, buttery malts, grapefruit, and banana all show up with a strong inhalation.  The taste is delicious. Again, bottles don't really compare to a good Dead Guy on-tap (IMO). It practically bursts with notes of fruit and caramel malts, and a bit of creamy vanilla/butterscotch too. The finale is predominantly hop territory, as the flavor ends with a bitter, resinous bite. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied, semi-creamy but crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is nearly perfect. It's complex, flavorful, and almost too easy to put away a few in one sitting. Hooray for Dead Guy, my faith is renewed!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Squelch,3.14,"Pours a cloudy amber dark tan, light amber with an off white head that dissaipates fast. Smells slightly of sulpher with caramel undertones, no hop aroma present. Taste begins with hops up front, caramel and toasted flavors in the middle, and finishing with a bready yeasty flavor which probably contributed to this beer's haze. Mouthfeel is medium to medium thick.  A drinkable beer but not one I would buy again. This is my first beer within this style so I may just not like the style!

It is a drinkable beer that gets better the more you drink it. a very good (local for me) beer.

Strong carbonation on the tongue. Great hop flavor lingers.  D - One of the best american craft beers I've had. Very smooth with enough hops to keep it interesting.  This is a great beer.

Appearance seems a slightly dusty amber with a medium head leaving an nice lace. Smell and taste of sweet malt, spice and fruit. mouthfeel is a healthy medium with good carbonation, Overall a really good drinking ale I know when I buy growlers from other breweries they say the carbonation should last about 10 days, there is no bottling date and the carbonation seemed fine, so I grabbed it at a good time or there is something in the bottling process.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some slight lacing on the larger gulps, but lacing slides down the sides, doesn't really stick around.  S: Balanced hop/malt aroma, leaning slightly towards hops.  T: Light hop flavor, but not lacking in bitterness. Very light caramel taste, which actually submits to a hoppy aftertaste, even when it gets warmer.  M: Medium body, overall a good, balanced feel.

132,355,tapman,3.18,"Got this one from a growler sitting in a Jewel, unrefrigerated. It was only $10 so what the hey...  Body is a brown/amber color with a thick, creamy foam off white head. For a growler, no matter how tight the cap, this beer retained some decent carbonation. Lacing is quite resilient and creeps down the side like ivy. Medium-dark yet transparent.  Smell is bready with English-like hops. Malts are like light roasted, not quite caramel, but not too heavy. I actually taste more bready hops than malts. Hop and malt balance is buttery.  Buttery and slightly salty hop/malt balance. Taste is actually thinner than usual (remember this is from a shipped out growler) . Hops leave a bitter grass in the finish while the malts leave me. The after-taste leaves me with a BMC kinda tangyness in my mouth. I'm pretty sure its due to the marketed growler. As it warms there is some caramel malt in the taste, but not much. BMC like film almost ruins it for me.  Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than the average BMC, but its still kinda thin.  I'm sorry to keep refering BMCs, but I really think this growler thing is responsible for the lacking in taste, smell, and mouthfeel. I've had this brew from the tap and I was much more impressed.

The taste is not quite as crisp as the smell, and the hops leave more of a bitter aftertaste than typical for a bock.  The beer has a moderately light and smooth mouthfeel.

132,355,MillRat,3.3,"Pours a slightly hazy honey color with a thin white head that never quite goes away. A small cloudy dribble from the end of the bottle suggests this was bottle conditioned, but there's nothing on the bottle to warn one about this. You may want to pour gently and slowly so you don't get any carryover. Lacing is minimal. A nice malt aroma that translates into a noticable but not cloying sweet malt presence in the flavor that is balanced by spicy hop bitterness that dries out the aftertaste. A well-built beer that is certainly quite sessionable.

Not much there.  The taste is sweet malt and just a hint of hop on finish to aid in the finish. Finishes crisp and clean. It is well balanced for what it is but it definately is not a big beer.

Now this is not the bottle influencing me: it SMELLS like honey. Throw in some prunes, toffee and a hint of herbs and you've got an interesting nose.  Malty in a very neutral way; not overly sweet although the biscuity malt flavor dominates what little hops eek through. I suppose it's a bock but it is certainly one with an American accent.  Mouthfeel is solid. At no point does it slip into the watery character that some Rogue brews do. Yet it also resists the thickness that such a malt-driven beer can easily take on. Nicely done. I don't love the beer although I could see easily finishing the bomber.

T/M: Smooth, creamy malt flavor. More of the carmel thast. As it warms further, the alcohol taste and smell come through a bit too much. Kinda weird for a 6.5% beer.

A light nose of caramel-sweet malts with a whiff of pit fruit on a summer breeze. The flavors are a perfect balance between sweet and bitter (for the non-hop head that I am). Earthy with some white grapes, and just the right amount of spice and hop bittering. Ying and yang in liquid form! A fairly light body belies the long legs that continue to coat my glass, and the soft carbonation matches the whole picture to a tee. Hard to believe this is not a European brew, more so that it's a West Coast beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,geexploitation,3.75,"Pours a deep, very reddish amber with a slightly off-white head that fades to a dusting. The aroma has a lot of fruit and potpurri spices too it, as well as some musky hops and amber malts. An ale character suffuses all of this. On the palate, rough fruits and scratchy hops first off, followed by some tea-like malts at the mid-palate. The finish dries out and brings a hoppy bite and some alcoholic burn. Overall, this is quite a nice beer, but it's no Maibock. Very ale-like character, especially in the mouthfeel, which has too many rough edges for a lager. In spite of the lack of stylistic distinction, it's still a beer that drinks well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Thanby,3.87,"A: Pours a nice amber honey color with two fingers of creamy-looking head that dissipates in about two minutes but leaves a fair amount of lacing.  S: Very malty, nice and round, surprisingly mild. The spices stand out the most, but the only one I can really separate enough to identify is the cinnamon. Also a bit of honey and some kind of grain that I can't put my finger on.  T: Initially quite sweet. Very smooth, the hops kick in after a second and linger as the finish. The flavors are blended so well it's hard to figure out exactly what they are. Toasted, some hickory, a little honey and again the cinnamon and maybe some cloves.  M: Smooth and rich. Nice carbonation, easy to drink. The slightly hoppy aftertaste is very pleasant. Light to medium body, I could drink several of these.  Overall a very good brew with a nice balance. There's something slightly odd about the hops that I can't quite put my finger on, but it isn't bad.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Strix,4.67,"Serving: 1.5 Pint bottle  Deep amber color.  Smells of malts, with a sweet finish and roasted notes. Caramel and hops are also in the smell.  Taste is very complex, starts out smooth, with malt and caramel, then a slight twinge of alcohol, a roasted note, fresh bread crust, and a slightly hoppy and sweet aftertaste. The aftertaste is really nice.  Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing.  Overall, quite delicious. This really hits the spot. I need to find some more Rogue brews.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mpyle,3.82,"Must preface my comments by saying that never in a million years would I say this is a Maibock/Hells Bock (aren't Bock beers lagers?). While reviewing it I was thinking an American Amber/Brown Ale. With that out of the way....  App - Cloudy pale ambert color. Moderate-sized whitish head, creamy and long lasting  Aroma - Malty and clean - minimal aroma  Flavor - Some dark malt roastiness good malt flavor complexity. Finishes slightly roasty bitter, but aftertaste is minimal and balanced.  Med body and med-high carbonation. No astringency or warming  O'all drinkability - A malt-dominated beer with exceptionally clean character. Could use more hop flavor if an ambert ale, works fairly well as an American Brown.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,xymyl,4.3,"Creamy off white head falls quickly even in the storm of carbonation but leaves some lacing along the way leaving a respectable 1/8"" + layer at the top of the glass. Color is vibrant orange with reddish/copper highlights.  Aroma is full of malty lager notes, but with layers of subtle hidden esters deep beneath. Clean, light bready malts along with sweet citrus, old dry cedar and a wiff of smoke come forward. In the distant background are caramel malts and even coffee and chocolate.  Taste is an interplay of hop bitterness, alcohol and the lager-like clean lighter malts while a game of ""keep away"" happens in the background with the hidden darker malt and fruity notes. The smoke chimes in again.  Body is medium light to medium. There is a slight buttery quailty that has always been here. It's been a long time, what a great beer. Why do I forget some of these greats?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,zerofear13,3.77,"Poured right out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Decent head, but fades pretty quickly. Deep amber, red or brown color. Smells of strong alcohol, malt, and caramel. Taste follows smell pretty well. All sweet caramel malt with strong alcohol finish. Your first few sips may be very warming as the alcohol hits the back of your throat and chest. Very full beer, but the alcohol drops the drinkability considerably. Overall, I can see where the fan base would be for this beer, as this is pretty accurate reflection of a maibock, but doesn't tickle my fancy as the alcohol was a bit too in-your-face.  EDIT: (01.30.09) After a year of not having this beer, and after many more beer tastings, with a new refined palette, I can say I have a much greater appreciation for this beer. The honey, sweet caramel malt notes of this brew is amazing! I'd agree that the alcohol is still a bit of a smack in the face, but that sweet flavor is wonderful.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Aichelberger,4.5,"Wow. Rogue does it again. Gorgeous orange color with thick, foamy tan head. Subtle hops in the nose with a rich malt scent.

Well worth seeking out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,crayphish,4.28,"Wow, a true malt bomb. This Rogue offering poured a fairly opaque brown capped by a creamy foamy head. Moderate carbonation and a fair amount of lace. Aroma is all malt. Caramel and other sweet fruits in the nose as well. Apples are brought to mind. Taste is more malt. Any hops in this brew are buried. The malt taste has layers of vanilla, apples, and yeast. Mouthfeel isn't as thick and chewy as one would expect from a malt bomb. Pleasantly crisp. Extremely drinkable, do so with caution.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S - Good amount of hops but very balanced. It does have a decent taste of caramel  T - Very smooth and very malty. A bit of hops near the end, but once again, it's very balanced.

Overall, it's good, I would drink any time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,biggmike,4,"A very good Ale. Interesting in that it uses a malt recipe for a bock, but uses top-fermenting ale yeast. A little different than your traditional ale, it might not appeal to some. If you want more of a traditional ale, try Rogue American Amber Ale. Smell and taste of caramel hops, a bit of a sweet taste. Poured with small head that didnt last too long. Some hop bitterness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Strongly malty without being in-your-face about it, like a watered-down Imperial. A bit of hops near the end, but just enough to round off the edge.

132,355,hustlesworth,4.47,"the first time i tried this beer was in 12oz bottles and the 6-er disappeared fast. for this review, i'm goin for a 64oz growler that i bought in outer banks, NC last week. now that i'm not overwhelmed by how good this beer is (or by how too many will put you on your ass) i can take the time to notice it's subtleties. before i drink the 1/2 gallon haha.  A- i'm a bartender so i pride myself on the perfect pour. this beer poured quite easily with less head than i'd usually prefer (i like a big fluffy cloud stickin out the top of my pint glass whenever possible). it had a soft dense white SLIGHTLY tan 1/2in of foam that settled quickly to a beautiful thin layer that reminded me of an overcast night sky speckled by constellations of tiny bubbles and nice almost symmetrical lacing stuck to the glass like looking down into a king's crown or something. carbonation continued to rise from the bottom of the glass until it was empty giving quite a sweet effect to the hazy copper-amber-orangish-brown color.  S- the more i closed my eyes and sniffed, the more i could smell and that made me appreciate this beer even more. first there was citrus and malt, followed by dried fruit and raisins, like trail mix, followed again by sweet red wine and fortified wine like sherry or marsala and apple cider.  T- with the images of wine in my head, the first sip tasted like the wooden casks the wines were aged in even to the point where i knew it was white oak or maple. impressive. after that i found bitter orange peel, perfectly balanced hops, and the faint taste of the way my vegetable garden smells in the summertime led by fresh dill of all things. drink one then go chew on a dill seed and you'll know what i mean. after it warmed a bit that all changed to roasted nuts and malt, toast, and caramel that's been set on fire.  MF- very smooth with medium weight and the perfect amount of carbonation in my opinion.  D- close to the top if not one of the best, you can hardly tell it's 6.5% until you drink 3 and stand up. cannot wait to try more from rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Bubbles are a bit prickly, but not offensive.  Overall, a good, strong Beer. This is a malty Beer that is higher in alcohol.

Initial head was about one inch. to a film.This drops to a thin layer, but never Sweet in the smell came through like peach with some sweet/sharp orange coming off the hops. Taste gets complex, but orange comes through more than anything else. Hop bitterness is solid, but not huge or overpowering. And the aftertaste is neither too astringent/hoppy or too sweet. Great mix, with most of the hops trailing off leaving a slightly dry orange kicking around. Mouthfeel was at medium body, with a creaminess tempered by carbonation that hits both in front and throughout the taste. While the carbonation might make more than one or two these filling, it's very drinkable.

Very nice explosion of flavor - smoky caramel-covered hops with the above mentioned orange spice bread with some sweet raisins thrown in.  Crisp, drying and lip-smacking the way I find every Rogue beer I've had.  Certainly very drinkable, at 6.5%, though due to its substantial flavor, you might not be in a rush to session this. It's a savory beer. Maibock is a style a little out of my comfort zone that I've been appreciating more lately, and this is good stuff by my reckoning",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell: I got a lot of hop characteristic, very fragrant.  Taste: Wonderful. I really enjoyed the full flavor of the hops, but very well balanced with the malt backbone.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth. Not overly carbonated with a medium body.  Overall Drinkability: My first Maibock and I definitely wanted another one - too bad I had only purchased one bottle!

Smells fresh and almost summery, but still with some robustness.  Incredibly smooth, with a faint carmel note. Very sweet, and somewhat thick malty taste, but the hops in the finish do a nice job to balance.  A highly drinkable, possibly sessionable brew, but at 6.5%, be careful with this stuff.

Aroma was of a slight fruitiness, generous use of malts and maybe a note of hops. Taste was just delicious. A well-balanced beer. Robust example of an ale, balanced by malted barley, fruits, spices and a glancing of hops on the tongue. Just a great beer overall and a joy to drink.

Taste: An overall sourish taste, with flavors of honey, dried fruits, and cider. Light hops on the finish and a yeasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: You know, if you can't say something nice, don't say it at all!  Time for an update! Not all too much has changed, except there's a more distinct toasty, bready malt character. Still sourish, less cidery and more akin to a non-oaked white wine. Slight score bump overall.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Lothore,3.98,Strait out of the bottle into a pilsner glass this brew has an amazing cloudy orange color with a slightly red tint. A good amount of head that is not quick to dissipate. Upon first sniff i get a sweet hoppy smell. When I dig a a bit deeper a muted fruit scent is detected. It has a very balanced taste: Clean wheat with a delightfully mild bitterness which seems to complement the flavor nicely. The mouthfeel is very smooth all the way through. I hate to use the same descriptor twice but it finishes absolutely cleanly begging you to drink more. All in all this is a highly drinkable beer. I could easily enjoy a few of these on an average night with some good food and great company.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The flavour on this is very appealing, and a good representative of the style: sweet malty goodness with caramel tones (some sugar and honey present in the background) dominant with decent hopping just to keep things in balance. This is a very tasty brew.  The mouthfeel on this is...full, carbonated, not thick but big. The drinkability is stellar, really no complaints at all.

It actually reminded me of homebrewed beer, which I enjoy. This beer is not for everyone, but I am a big fan, and would love to try it on tap.

Also has nice retention, overall this brew looks great.  Nose: Very balanced aroma. There's a very nice hint of spicy hops that are in just the right proportion to balance the sweet malty aromas that hail from my glass. Could be a bit more potent, both the hop and malt aroma were just a bit hard to smell.  Tongue: Very strong malt backbone in this beer. The sweet caramel and slightly roasted flavors really make up the flavor profile of this brew. Bit of spicy hop flavors near the end that attempt to balance the brew, but this beer is mostly malt driven.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium-light bodied, with lower levels of carbonation. The spritzy feeling of carbonation nicely melds with the flavor of the malts, which suits this style-in my opinion- quite nicely. Finishes slightly dry. Was a bit lighter in body than I expected.

The taste was smooth, malty and delicious with nice hop bitterness in the finish and moderate carbonation. Somewhat honey sweet, but very nice indeed.

Yeast, malt on the intake, sour citrus in the middle with a refreshingly dry, bitter finish that lingers, inviting another sip. Sweet without being syrupy. Bitter without being over-the-top harsh for the sake of being harsh.  The mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly -- very refreshing.

Good lacing as the head goes down.  S: Great smell, so complex. Really sweet and hoppy. Caramel, oranges, lemons, incredible citrus character. Malty over & undertones. Excellent nose. Gotta be the best part of this brew.  T: Caramel/sweet up front. Big maltiness with a nice hop bitter finish. Taste does leaves something to be desired as it just doesn't seemed balanced.  M/D: Medium bodied with a pretty good amount of carbonation. Just OK mouthfeel. Drinkability could be better, but it's such a puzzle that the drinkability goes back and forth.  Overall this is another good offering from Rogue. However, this one seems to defy convention. At first the taste and drinkability are top-notch, midway through, both seemed to lose a lot.

132,355,Atlas1,3.9,"I'm sure it's been addressed in the BA forums before, but I still don't understand how a maibock can be called an ale by the folks at Rogue. Very confusing....  Pours a rich copper apricot color with a nice thick foam head that stays around. Leaves chunks of lace around the glass as the beer recedes. Sweet, malty aroma, with notes of candied sugar and caramel. Some dark fruit scent here as well. Hint of apple and pear too. Sweet tasting brew, again with a caramel appeal. Some pear/apple/strawberry sensation, as well as a sugary, vanilla taste. Tasty, to be sure, although I'd only want to drink this beer fresh. In my opinion, maibocks do not age well. Smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability. Deceptive alcohol content, though, at 6.5% ABV. Another nice brew by the folks at Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,prototypic,3.8,"Appearance: It's a cloudy, dark amber to copper color. Modest one finger head. Retention and lacing were decent, but not spectacular.  Smell: Pretty straight forward. It's a mix of toffee or caramel malts, a bit of honey, and yeast. There's a bit of a light hop aroma.  Taste: Plenty of malt in this one. Mostly tastes of caramel malts and a honey flavor. It does have a bit of a biscuity taste which leaves a yeasty aftertaste. There are some hops there, but it's far from a really bitter beer. Just a nice, well-balanced brew.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and carbonation is perfect. This is a great session beer. The abv may be a little higher than what some would say a session beer should be. But, it's so easy to drink. In my mind, it's a great session beer, as most Rogue brews are. Overall, it's a good, solid beer. Try it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,phisig137,3.55,"Pours from an undated bomber a medium amber color, with a frothy 1.5 finger head. Decent retention yeilds into a thin blanket with decent lacing.  Aroma is slightly malty, with biscuit and yeasty notes. Overall fairly clean, but there is a slight hint of sulfur in there that is a bit out of place.  Flavor is malt dominated as well, mostly toasted biscuit like malts, fresh bread, and yeasty flavors. Sulphur isn't present on the flavor, but stale hops are on the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and flat. Drinkability is pretty good.  Personally, I feel that this is an overrated beer from a good brewery. As far as a Helles, it's not that bad, but the few flaws that it has, and the lack of any kind of wow factor really hurt this one. In addition, it tends to be MUCH better on tap.  One other odd thing I've noticed, is that this is the ONLY Rogue beer I've ever seen that doesn't list all of the ingredients on the label.

It is slightly citrusy/flowery with some malts underneath. The taste is on the bitter side but not overly so, but this probably would not appeal to someone who did not like hops.

Coppery to lightish amber in color with quickly dissipating head and little lacing. Absent of any real aroma. This one's taste makes up for its absence of aroma. Immediate sweetness on the tongue, but not cloying. No real hop bite, but still a bit drying in the finish--very interesting. The taste is very aggressive, but not extreme. Nice medium to thick mouthfeel. Elevated ABV is well-hidden, but definitely there. I really like this version of the style--good work by Rogue Ales.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,albern,3.18,"I was expecting a bit more complexity with this ale. The pour was thick and the froth hung around for awhile. The color is your nice, clean amber, typical of the style. The smell is a little hoppy, a bit of wheat also come through. The taste is about the hops from start to finish. I had to drink a good pint to discern enough sweet, caramel maltiness in the middle to appreciate it a bit more. It is a bit more hoppy than I appreciate and definitely has a nice bite at the end, if you go for that sort of thing. It is above 6 ABV but the alcohol flavor is well masked by those darn hops again.

The flavor was sweet malt on the front end with a hop dryness in the finish with enough fruity ale qualities to add some complexity. Nicely balanced with enough dryness in the finish. There was also a vinuous quality to the aftertaste.  There was good carbonation with a medium body. Makes you anticipate the next drink.  This was a very enjoyable brew.

132,355,trevorwideman,3.63,"650ml bomber poured into a Pilsner glass.  Pours a coppery red colour with a big 2 inch head that retains quite well. Lots of lacing, carbonation is mild. Smell is full of musty and earthy aroma hops. Damp cellar and fallen leaves come to mind. A bit of buttery caramel sweetness in the background. A mild lemony sourness is there, and a light apple aroma. Uncomplex but fairly telling in its character.  Taste is certainly pleasant, a nice mix of mellow buttery sweetness and some more herbal hop flavours. Anise, lemon, earth, tart apples, and some more medicinal bitter flavours that aren't unpleasant but are definitely there. Mouthfeel is rather thick and malty, but dries well and sticks to the throat. Alcohol is a bit more evident than expected, and carbonation might be a bit better if it was toned down just a little. That said, this beer is very drinkable and I'm really enjoying it tonight, it's the kind of thing I can really go for late in the year, it just screams ""Autumn"".

The beer was served with a thin off white head that diminished into a ring but still left good lacing on the glass. The aroma was heavy on the malt with a mild amount of earthy hops behind it. The taste was heavy on the malt as any maibock should be, but this being brewed as an ale, the earthy hops shine through a lot more than they do in any other beer of this style. The beer is not heavy at all and is very enjoyable. I will always consider this a great session beer, even though it is 6.5%.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

However, as promised during my first review, I poured this from a new bottle as opposed to a growler that had been sitting in my basement for over a month.  Appearance was a cloudy amber with moderate visible carbonation, but minimal head development. Smell was slightly malty with hints of caramel and a mild sourness. Taste was malty and a bit sour, but not bad. Dead Guy Ale has a very distinct and different taste that I'm still trying to place, but this adds to the beer's character.

132,355,chrisms86,3.9,"Another great brew from Rogue. Smells strongly of hops. The mouthfeel is too syrupy for my tastes, with an unfulfilling bite of carbonation. The taste is complex with sweet notes on top of a mostly sour malt flavor. I don't like the amount of bitterness.. not enough to give a bite but just enough to leave a dull flavor that drowns out the fantastic sweet and sour notes. Overall a fantastic beer that is perfect for watching football, working on cars, or other social gatherings. It doesn't take a beer enthusiast to love this one.

Smell: Enjoyable sweetness, with a hint of fruit, from both the malts and hops.  Taste: Toasted grains and malts, followed by a light, sweet flavor, and an eventual hop bitterness. Intense flavor & aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, though with a slight grainy finish. Medium-bodied with a rather noticable carbonation (too much).  Drinkability: Though enjoyable, it can be a bit hard to drink at times with the carbonation and intensity.  I think this is a nice beer and worthy of trying, but it's a bit too strong in the carbonation department for me to really enjoy, and the taste (while generally nice) doeesn't correspond to my personal liking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Didn't like it much on first try (about 12 years ago), but man, how tastes do change...  The huge, fluffy head is a dirty white, retaining a solid few minutes. Things look even better due to the great burnt orange color (looks like a double IPA) and lots of bubbles, with a slight cloudiness deepening the color. A few small patches of lace left behind.  Aroma is a mellow, crisp hoppiness (I would guess Cascade, but I'm still a novice in differentiating between specific varieties). Light malty sweetness and, despite a fairly tame ABV (6.5%) there's some alcohol showing up. Nice smell, nothing amazing.  Flavor has a good bit of depth right from the very beginning. Creamy malt sweetness (caramel/toffee), fruity brightness, clearly well-hopped bittering, and even some maple flavor. Finish is a sweet hops kiss, and the mouthfeel is excellent: light on weight, yet plenty of swing from the carbonation, achieving balance and depth with a silky creaminess.  Good stuff, seriously easy drinking with enough character to keep you coming back.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some malt, citrus hops and there seems to be some spiciness to it as well.  T- Caramel malt and citrus seem to be the most overwhelming part of the flavor. Kind of sweet. Interesting.

Appearance is a medium copper with a light tan head that bubbles down to a scattered surface of foam; but lasts a decent time. Very pleasing to the eyes.  Smell represents the overall malt flavor of the beer.  There is just something about the taste of this beer that makes me happy. It might be too caramely for some but this beer just rides the line of too sweet with me but maintains such craving for me.  Mouthfeel leaves very little to be improved upon.

Sort of a funny, sweet and sour smell of malts. Light, refreshing hop presence.  Syrupy malt flavour and good hops. A hint of spicyness and alcohol heat. Rich, warming flavour that is also quite crisp and well developed.  Good mouthfeel, but there is a certain sour aftertaste that leaves an unpleasant feeling in the mouth.  Better than I remember.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beeroclock,3.51,"Poured into a mug as dark copper with a nice puffy white head. Laced the glass very nicely. Smell is slightly fruity, nothing special though. Tastes light almost sweet but with a good brew appeal. The sweetness lasts through with the aftertaste but has enough kick to enjoy. I like it, a good Rogue product.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,alysmith4,3.63,"A lot milder than I had anticipated. I was expecting more of a kick in the pants, but I found this beer to be more of a pat on the butt. My novice palate ignorantly compares it to an India Pale Ale, but the flavor profile seemed a bit more refined than your typical IPA. Subtle notes of clove, apricot, and honey. Slightly peppery as well. I would try this again for sure, perhaps by a different brewer for comparison. Watch the high ABV.. this brew is so smooth, it can creep up on you fast.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BrewMonkey,3.92,"Poured darker than I expected, somewhat coppery/amber in color. Pretty light and fluffy head, about 3/4 inch with a normal pour.  Aroma was fruity and a little sweet.  Taste was really suprising, took me a second for it all to register. Initial flavor reminded my wife and I of cotton candy, with a fruity twist. Just a very unique flavor. Mouthfeel was fairly light, decent body but not at all heavy on the pallete.  Very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,theformula,4.28,"Great job Rogue, this is great.  Pours a dark honey body in a deep mug with great big cream-colored head. Good retention and pretty sticky lacing. A looker.  Scent is light and delicious. Great floral and fruity esters that bring on citrus, tropical fruit, pineapple and such. Nice honey-sweet malt foundation like a good bock, with aromatic hops giving it a flowery aroma.  Mouthfeel is light-medium and very crisp. Nice carbonation.  Taste is decently complex and light. Right off it starts with a bubble-gum and light-honey malt sweetness that's also floral, followed by European pils hops (I guess) that's slightly bitter but delicate. Finishes pretty dry and bitter.  This hybrid bock brewed w/ ale yeast is intersting and a damn-good beer as far as drinkability is concerned. Fruity, sweet, and balanced hop profile makes for a great beer. A regular in my fridge.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Night,3.54,"Pours copper with orange tones and flecks of gold and red. Small yellow-white head with light-medium lacing; dies down quickly. Aroma of bubblegum, banana, and apple with floral undertones; hints of spices here and there. Light-medium body. Initial flavor is a mixture of rich and spicy (though mild) noble hops and sweet flowery, cake and cookie-dough malts, punctuated by a subtle undertone of sour lemon-lime citrus. Followed by toasty, buttery malts underlined by mild floral and dark fruit flavors. Hops linger. Bready, somewhat spicy finish and aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A: Burnt orange and hazy, 1/4"" thin head, quickly dissipating to a ring of bubbles with no lacing.  S: Malts and caramel. Not much else.  T: My first Maibock, so I was unsure what to expect. I liked the slight sweetness upfront, with a bit of alcohol zing to balance. I can almost discern a bit of vanilla somewhere in the middle. Goes down smooth. What's the ABV on this again?  M: Good beer-y feel, carbonation helps it go down. Doesn't linger long, but nice while it's there.  D: Very good.

Taste was rather hoppy for a Bock beer. I like it. A thin malt backbone, sweet and thinly grape like. Had a nice hop profile, this is where the citrus scent comes from. Good brew.  Very light in the mouth, a lot more than the style would have you believe.  All in all, this is a really tastey brew that would be lovely to session. I'll be picking up more for sure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Kendo,4.18,"A: Poured into a tall pilsner glass a coppery-amber with a 1-finger off-white head. Bubbles rise throughout, giving it a nice look. Head disappears to leave a partial ring of lacing at the top of the glass, otherwise there's no lacing on the way down.  S: Malt scents dominate -- caramel and hazelnut seem most prevalent -- but it's fairly mild in the nose.  T: As with the nose, the malt produces the dominant taste, at least up front. Caramel malt again, along with some butterscotch or toffee, but also some evident spice and fruit further on, even more so as it warms. There's a slightly metallic bitter finish that lingers through the aftertaste, creating a solid balance.  M: Medium-bodied, buttery at times but with a nice dry finish.  D: Highly drinkable. Not too heavy, but flavorful enough to be interesting.  Notes: I'll fess up -- I don't know much about this style and what exactly this beer should be. But I've had it on tap and in the bottle and always liked it. Another solid offering from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TechMyst,4.3,My first Rogue. And my first Maibock. Hazy deep amber color. Sweet malt aroma. white head disapates completely. Initially thought that this was very malty and that I wouldn't want any more maltiness...but realized that there was enough hop to balance it all out. It was suprisingly good and actually refreshing even throughout the temperature change. I will definitely be looking forward to having this again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BBM,3.55,"The beer poured a nice cloudy golden-amber color with a thin white head that dissapeared quickly. Smell was sweet, with notes of raisins, bread, and some honey.  The taste is very malty, with strong notes of caramel and honey. There is a slightly bitter finish due to the hops. The beer is balanced, but leaning toward the malty side. Mouthfeel is medium, and creamy. This is a fairly drinkable beer, if a bit on the heavy side. Overall this lager is a nice, solid brew, but nothing exceptional in my opinion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Then a day later I saw it in an ABC in Fort Myers, though only in the large bottle.  What a pleasant surprise to find that the new Kroger at home in GA has an amazing selection of beer, which includes Dead Guy and another Rogue brew. I picked up a six pack and plunked down $10 for it, then found myself going back to the same store the next day to pick up something else...  ... but only because I wanted to keep this Dead Guy around for a few days and not polish it off in one weekend!  Mine poured a cloudy orange amber; head was a mixture of small and large bubbles that didn't last long... no lacing. Smells and tastes sweet and malty, compared to the aggressively-hopped IPAs I've been drinking lately. Mouthfeel was pleasantly... creamy... and I found myelf smacking my lips, much to the cat's amusement.  All I could say was, ""hmmm... this is good... this... is...

Smells sweet, nutty, and bready with a whiff of floral and tea-like hops. There's a hint of jasmine in there as well. The rich maltiness is present in the flavor, but is then pushed out by a sturdy hoppiness: floral notes and a good bit of bitterness. I get a slight buttery taste in the aftertaste as well. Body is slightly light, a bit light for what I expected, but the carbonation is solid. Extremely drinkable, despite the alcohol.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Poured into nonic a hazy dark reddish copper color. The head dissipates fast and leaves no real lacing. Smells slightly metallic, some mild spice, light on the hops, not to much going on here malt wise, honestly rather boring. The taste a bit better although not by much, a very mellow flavor. Its not very dynamic or interesting, but drinkable non the less. I feel like this would be loads better on tap, but as it is I can say with assuredness I will never buy this (good thing I didnt in the first place).

132,355,BeerBelcher,2.36,"From a 12 oz bottle purchased locally here in WI...  The color of this beer was a pretty bright orange, with some haze. The amount of head was not huge, but it had fairly tight bubbles and good staying power.  The smell was a sweet malty one. It smelled like plain yellow cake...that sort of sweetness.  The taste was a big mouthful of maltiness, more so than other maibocks. Very little hoppiness, which I believe is also consistent with the style. I didn't especially care for the taste.  Mouthfeel was a little thin and watery. Despite this, I would rate the drinkability of this beer as very high either based on the fact that I didn't really want to drink another one.  Not sure if I got an old bottle, but I'd prefer Summit's Maibock any day of the week over this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Flavor: Thirst quenching malty flavor up front followed by hints of currant and sweet grape skins and finishes with a delicate piney hop bitterness that has you begging for another sip.  Mouthfeel: Slick on the tongue with medium carbonation.  Overall Impression: This was one of the first micro beer bottles I have ever seen back in 1996 in the party store. Someone said don't try that beer it's disgusting, so I didn't. 10 years later I'm sampling it on my web site, who knew. A delicious Maibock, I would call it. A session beer to boot!

According to the little icons on the back this beer goes good with pigs and fire..  i can't get much scent on this, small traces of a malty hop wheat smell, not very strong really. hard to say...  it tastes pretty damned fine. it's smooth and easygoing and agreeable. a lot of maibock's i've had tend to be a little sour or too rich, this one sits a nice middleground.  mouthfeel is wonderful. smooth and silky and leaves me feeling even a little refreshed with a slight bite on the tip of the tounge.  i consider this a highly drinkable beer that can be enjoyed anytime. very much worth a try.  cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Malted,3.61,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance- Cloudy amber-brown color with very little head. I was surprised that there was only 6.5% alcohol in this beer as the head behaves like it has a bit more; as in, there was very little head and it dissipates very rapidly.  Smell- Very small amounts of hops and malt. I was so intent on finding more to the aroma that I stuck my nose in the beer... Oops.  Taste- Pretty good balance of hops and malt, however, there is very little of both. As someone else pointed out, there are hints of tea in here. I think I can taste honey as well.  Mouthfeel- creamy and smooth. Best part of this beer is the mouth feel. The light carbonation and creaminess makes the beer go down smooth. In fact, I would have to say it almost makes up for the mild flavors.  Drinkability/ Overall- Very drinkable, but I tend towards bigger flavors nowadays.

Pretty bitter finish that really hides any other flavors.  A bit too highly carbonated for my tastes, and not very drinkable.

It pours a copper color with an orange hue and gold accents. The off-white head is creamy and shows decent retention, leaving ample lacing.  The rather weak aroma is dominated by sweet malt and grain. The flavor also consists primarily of caramel malt, oats, some raisin, a little dark berry, and some mild hops on the finish.  The mouth is medium bodied, is decently carbonated, though not all that complex. It is very drinkable, especially out of the bottle.

For some reason though, a few days later it's much easier to drink for me.  It pours a very dark orange to brown with a decent amount of head that disappears pretty quickly, but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is fruity, sweet and bitter, yet VERY alcohol-y. As for the taste, it retains that bitter and sweet taste, however doesn't quite taste as alcohol-soaked as it smells. But it wasn't anything that made me say ""that's delicious"" (like a lot of other Rogue beers have done for me). With a mouthful that's neither thin nor thick, I don't think many people would have a hard time drinking many of these, unless you breathe in too deeply the alcohol scent as you sip. For me, it tended to really lower the quality of the beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This is a good beer, served it at my halloween party and was very well accepted. This was out of a bottle, into a pint glass, on tap locally had a bit more of a kick, but overall recommended. Found myself drinking one of these almost every other day lately. Good Brew/",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Neehan,4.52,"This poured a hazy orange/red with a thick head that left very nice lacing. Sweet smell of malts and a biscuity aroma. A very nice taste of fruits, hops, with the biscuity flavoring coming into the background. Complex, yet smooth and refreshing. Exceptional. A good, well balanced mouthfeel that goes down smoothly. Incredibly drinkable, you will definitely want more. An exceptional beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,hckyfn9999,4,"Pours a cloudy orangish yellow color with a finger and a half off-white head that leaves some decent lacing. Smells of malt and a little fruit, honey, and caramel. Taste is of malty sweetness initially with a little kick of hops at the end. Sort of an iced tea like after taste. Mouthfeel is fine and drinkablity is pretty good. Pretty solid brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jubnat,3.86,"Poured this from a 12 oz. bottle. Dark orange-red color, light head. I'm not getting too much aroma. Flavors are subtle. This is a fairly sweet beer, which I'm usually not that fond of, but this one is pretty damn good. I could definitely have this as a semi-regular beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,baxterbrew,1.4,"Poored from the bottle with weak head that quickly ran away. The color was murky, orange- almost looks like an unfiltered homebrew. Smell is hoppy, not what I would expect here. The taste is nearly horrible. Very bitter with very little trace of malt. The aftertaste is putrid, almost vomit-like sitting on the back of the throat. This was very disappointing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,medic25,3.58,"22oz bomber poured in a pilsener. Hazy copper-orange color, with a frothy white head that quickly fades. Faint smell of malt.

Smooth mouthfeel with little aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,KroMagnon,3.52,"Head was a little underdone on this brew. The color was fine, though, sort of orange-golden, and it was rather clear. The aroma was nice, features gold robust malt, manifesting as a ripe graininess along with softer caramel notes as a compliment. Not much hops detectable to me, and I also don't get a lot of fruitiness which is a little odd because I seem to recall getting more fruitiness from past samples. Nevertheless I don't smell them now so let's continue. The flavor is strongly malty at the start, and has some nice bitterness for balance, but there is also some higher alcohol notes that do not seem to blend or compliment the other characteristics well - its seems rougher rather than smoother. This is somewhat detracting, and I don't knmow if its more of a flavor or a mouthfeel ""issue"" so I'll hit it a little in both. Overall this is a decent beer, but for a maibock I think I'd like a more malty / smoother delivery. If indeed, however, its not a maibock, I'd still have to ding it a little for (lack of) smoothness.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RedChrome,4.09,"A deep amber color that was very cloudy. A white head of about an inch vanished quickly, leaving a slick across the top. Average amount of medium sized carbonation bubbles. Minimal thin lacing.  A nice pine scent had a disticnt note of hops on the first whiff. The first whiff ended with a citric quality. Additional scents show a very nice balance between the hops and a malted aroma. Very appealing.  A bitter pine taste was the strongest element of the flavor. There is an underlying burnt malt taste to add sweetness to the bitter. No taste of the citrus noted in the aroma.  Decent feel. Medium carbonation helped the thick body to spread.  Overall a very good beer. A great choice to go with a nice pork roast dinner. Another great offering from a very good brewery. Pick it up and enjoy it yourself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,xav33,4.11,"Rogue Dead Guy Ale 12 oz bottle Recent bottling, resurrected 10/06 Medium pour in a pint glass.  Poured a hazy reddish copper with a medium off white somewhat diminishing fizzy head.  Smelt of sweet caramel corn candy, allspice, butterscotch.  Taste was upfront moderate grainy bitterness and moderate caramel sweetness followed by a moderate butterscotch and spices bitterness on a long strong hoppy grassy and sour lime, slightly candied finish. Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied, syrupy, soft to lively carbonation with light to moderate astringency.  Overall, the smell alone makes this a must try. A bit aggressive on the palate for some, but eccentrically balanced and stands out beautifully.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Damian,3.42,"Drank from a 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. limited release glow-in-the-dark bottle purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits, Somerville, MA  Awesome name and bottle graphics. Additionally, my silk screened label was a glow-in-the-dark version.  Poured a cloudy, dark amber with a one finger, foamy, light chestnut head. Faded to a thick ring of lace with swirls of lace on top.  Smell was sweet and fragrant. Rich caramel and Vienna malts were apparent with hints of sweet cream and vanilla. A touch of florally hops detectable in the background.  Taste was similar initially. Malty and bready on the front end. Later some aggressive spiciness came in before the overwhelming cascade hops took hold. Hoppy to the extreme with a huge, unpleasant alcohol bite. This beer completely lacked balance. Super hoppy, bitter and dry finish. The beer left my tongue feeling like a piece of sandpaper.  Nice mouthfeel however. Rich, creamy and smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation.  This beer settled down a bit as it warmed but it was still quite tough to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,biegaman,4.03,"Bright gleaming copper tone, Rogue's Dead Guy looks even better when held up to the light. Gummy mounds of tarnished white make for a bounty of head and gluey rings of lacing that stripe round and round down the glass. Unspoiled clarity and the abundance of bubbles assist in the beer's healthy appearance.  I will often do a double-take with the Dead Guy. It is a Jekyll and Hyde of malt and hops; the line that divides the two can become slightly blurred. Rich sticky caramel malts give off an impression of syrupy toffee while a generous hop bill impart a ton of sappy pine-like resins. This is the case in both smell and taste.  Hefty malting and liberal hopping often work well together, but this is certainly the best example I've ever come across of it in a Bock. This also seems to be a thing Rogue as a brewery does quite well. There's really no way drinkability could become an issue - unless you run out.  One of the best pints I've ever enjoyed was a Dead Guy Ale, extremely fresh off tap at the San Fransisco Rogue Brewpub. It was so malty and yet so hoppy. It was Halloween and my flight had just arrived in earlier that day. We watched as the kids trick-or-treated and the bartenders gave them candy. It is a wonderful memory that was made especially extraordinary in thanks to the wonderful beer itself.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A: Clear, warm amber without much head but lots of scattered streams of carbonation bubbles. What little head there is appears off-white and creamy.  S: Caramel toasted malts with touches of citrusy hops.  T: Lots of malt flavor with a nice balance of bittering hops. Hops also give a slightly medicinal and grassy aftertaste. Some sweetness from malt and a little yeastiness are in the finish.  M: Medium to full mouthfeel. Crisp and clean finish. relatively smooth.  D: Always a solid choice. Very drinkable.

S - Has a dominant, sweet, caramel aroma.  T - It has a thick, dark roasted flavor, with a strong malt dominance, pretty much mimicking its aroma.  M - The roastiness is prevalent from the first sip to the aftertaste. A little bit of caramel overtones, roasted barley, a bit of a woody taste, and some hop flavor.  D - This is a good beer - it has a nice roasted taste with a bit of sweetness to it. It feels very mellow on the tongue, but is still a bit filling.

The aroma was mostly of sweet malt and possibly fruit? The taste is defiantly malt, which leads to a toasted flavor. There is a noticeable hop presence that is noticeable but not as robust as the maltyness. This is a good beer, not a favorite but defiantly a solid choice.

Taste: Starts with a nice malty sweetness with plenty of caramel and brown sugar, the middle moves along to a finish that is more of the sweet caramel malts but hops finally show with slight iced tea like bitterness. The blend of iced tea like bitterness and sweet malt linger long on the tongue after the swallow.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat thin bordering on medium, slick,very well carbonated, lively in the mouth.  Drinkability: Dead Guy Ale is very drinkable. A nice malty marzen with plenty of caramel, brown sugar and fruitiness in the flavor profile along with a slight nuttiness.

Can* Re-review is after the original.  AP: Deep amber, clear, good vibrant color. Frothy white head, medium size, creates some nice long and sticky legs.  Nose: Mild maltiness, nutty with a mild hop.  Taste: A semi-sweet and nutty malt flavor at first, slight hop ending with a hint of alcohol detected.  MF: Good activity, nice crisp feel.  DA: This one wasn't as great as the first time I had it....but still easily drinkable.  * 12 oz can. One of my first true craft beer buys. I think it's high time for another look.  Honey color. Short but thick all white foam hat and a small , thin cover lasts throughout.  A very sweet malty aroma. Honey and caramel over freshly baked bread. A nice herbal, spicy hop effect in the nose as well.  A heady and sweet malty flavor with caramel and honey, Italian bread, slightl oak cask...maybe even smokey, sour, spicy yeast and hop notes follow. Slightly earthy/bitter and sour malty finish. Decent depth of flavor, some rather odd and unique sensabilities.  The feel is pretty relaxed and malty slick. Medium body and pretty smooth in the finish.

The aroma was defintely hop-challenged and faint to almost non-existent.  Taste was another matter. the first taste was sweetish, there was a rather complex combination a flavors in the mid-palate, and the finish was dry (and good). The brew has malt sweetness balanced with indistinct hop bitterness, some flavor notes of grass and maybe a touch of lime. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with some malt-stickiness.

Relaxed orange-like citrus taste with a spicy tinge to it. A nice rush of hops toward the end with an aftertaste of tea. Good complexity to the body.  M: Refreshing and arousing to the tastebuds, with an oily hop character about it for an enjoyable mouthfeel. High carbonation does well with this beer.  D: Definitely enjoyable offering.

132,355,goodbyeohio,3.51,"thanks b for the housewarming gift. funny that a house'warm'ing gift is served cold. enough for now..  decided to cram the whole 22 into my paulaner 22oz mug. it fit, thanks to a thin, beige head that dissipated with haste. the beer itself glows a rich orange, and maintains a serious level of cloudiness (saw some yeast start to enter the glass towards the end of the pour), tiny bubbles waddle slowly through the visually dense matter here.  aroma is very cereal-grainy with notes of candy corn and a slight hint of cranberry juice... perhaps the hops? overall a malty nose but not as creamy and roasty as i would have envisioned.  immediately i taste a brilliant conflict between spicy hops and an english yeasty flavor. white pepper notes in the cheeks and orange essence come forward from the hop bitterness. these flavors clear out with some berry notes and finish off with a negligible profile of buttery diacetyl and vanilla. this is a maibock? eh, more like an alt to me.. but wtf do i know.  in its favor, it's got a great body. drinkability is fine for 6.5, although the bitter/butter contrast gives alot to wrap your tongue around and slows down consumption. warmth brings out a coconut flavor that improves the overall flavor of the beverage as well and covers up a fair amount of the D.  this is a good standby beer, and would make a great session in an oregon taproom overlooking the pacific and some big m-f'ing redwoods.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The aroma was crisp and you could tell that it was going to on the malty side... which it was.  However, I LIKE MALTY! The taste was very good... nice malty flavor with a crisp feel.

The smell matched a slightly smoky weaker version of the taste.  Taste-- Very intriguing. There's something going on up-front here that I can't quite identify-- I'm sure I'll figure it out by the end of the ($9.99 in 2006) 6-pack. Malt, some hops bitters and flowers up front, malt, and... a dead guy? I really think it's just the hops flowers, a sort of lavender-ish taste that is the highlight of this beer.

Smooth body from the carbonation and malts. Good malts, a quick sweetness that is then cut down by a huge, even hops taste; bitter but oily. Sweet finish. A very good blend of flavors. I love it.  A greatly crafted brew. Anywhere I go and they have it on draft, I get it. But it is dangerous on draft. You won't realize how much you had until you look (hazily I might add) at your bill.

Faint alcohol scent also.  Taste is smooth and sweet with a faint hint of fig and melon and a lingering hoppy finish with just a touch of mouth-drying tannins at the end. Alcohol warmth rises up to the nose late but is mild.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with faint carbonation that seems to dissipate quickly.  Not too heavy and sure goes down easy, but drinkability may be an issue with ABV around 7%.  This one has grown on me over the years.

132,355,pmcadamis,4.88,"I love this bottle! It depicts a little skeleton dude sittin' on top of a barrel, and the name is cool too. This one pours cloudy dark amber with a solid 1 finger head of tight foam. Solid sheets of lace wash over the glass and quickly fall back into the brew. Excellent retention of the solid-loking head.  THe nose is full of candied caramel and vanilla. The aroma is primarily sweet malt with only the faintest trace of hops. I smell caramelized sugar, honey, and a bit of a roasty nutty character.  This is wonderful! Thick caramel candy and sweet vanilla start things off before being replaced by a good deal of spicy hops. I taste honey, darkfruits (plum?), and toffee at first. Then a big hop punch finishes things off on the bitter and dry end of the scale. This is IMO perfectly balanced! You get the sweet malty notes first, then the dry, bitter, almost IPA-like piney hop flavor!  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with nice carbonation and a big warming alcohol presence. This stuff is extremely drinkable! I would drink this regularly if it weren't so expensive in my neck of the woods.  Wow. This is just a winner all the way around. I can't find anything bad to say about this great brew from Rogue. It looks great, has a great bottle, the name is badass (what are you drinking? ""Rogue Dead Guy Ale"" whoa...don't f*ck with that dude), it smells heavenly, tastes like liquid gold, and it is dangerously drinkable. Amazing.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste: Without the hops, this beer could be really sweet. I'm super thankful for the hops in here to bring a bit of bitterness to the malty, slightly fruity taste of the dead guy.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body, crisp and smooth.  Drinkability: Very sessionable. I was never sure what type of style this was, its a pretty unique taste. Well made and one that I revisit often. This was the first craft beer I remember having and really enjoying (long time ago it seems).

132,355,dblinkhorn,4.47,"Poured from a 650ml bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Pours a deep orange/honey color that is crystal clear and alive with carbonation bubbles inside. The head is a creamy color and is equally creamy in texture--about a finger and a half in height initially. It settles at a half finger cap of creamy head that remains throughout and leaves behind decent lacing.  Smell - This stuff has a fantastic sweet/fruity aroma that is quite unique from what I've had recently. The particular aroma is a rich and sweet, consisting of scents of peach, plum, and nectarine. A citrusy hop aroma beckons you to partake immediately of this brew. The malt has a raw and slightly earthy property that ties it all together. Medium alcohol presence.  Taste - That fantastic mix of peach, plum, and nectarine fruitiness greets you immediately as you taste. However this quickly yields to the bitter oily hop character. The malt pairs with this flavor but is mostly subdued in comparison. Again its main attributes are a raw property and some earthiness is present. The finish wipes away the present flavors in your mouth to again showcase that wonderful sweet fruitiness, although this time it is a bit milder and more balanced. The aftertaste comes through with some dry hoppiness and that mellow malt character sitting in the background. There is some moderate alcohol burn throughout the entire drink.  Mouthfeel - This stuff is quite smooth and has a medium body. The carbonation has a massaging effect on your mouth and is extremely pleasant.  Drinkability - Strong flavors but has excellent balance, especially in the finish. The carbonation is excellent and just about everything about this beer is enjoyable and positive.  Overall, I'm really impressed with this brew. It has just the right amount of sweet fruitiness blended with a wonderful oily hoppiness and mellow and raw background malt character. What a supberb brew Rogue has crafted with this one. A job very well done, and a highly recommended brew!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Darkale,4.57,"It's always good to find a reliably excellent beer, and Rogue's Dead Guy Ale is one of them. For those of us who love hops, this is a fabulous break -- an opportunity to splash in a beer full of ""malty goodness."" Rich, butterscotch, deeply sweet aroma... chewy mouthfeel... slightly bitter, smooth... the sort of beer that, as it goes down your throat, leaves an almost magnetic attraction for the next bottle in the six pack. I don't love every beer in Rogue's line-up, but when they get it right, they get it right. I have never been disappointed by this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,neelyjr1,3.41,"Serving Type: 22 oz Bottle Appearance: Cloudy light amber, with very gold highlights at the bottom. Poured with a huge white head Smell: Very bready, some hop comes through but the malt overtakes it. Taste: Alcohol really comes foward in the taste, with some bitterness towards the end. Mouthfeel: OK mouthfeel, seems a little lighter on the pallate. Drinkability: With the alcohol coming through so much, it makes it one that I would have one and move on to something else.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Mebuzzard,3.9,"A good pour. Light body of amber/yellow color, chunky white head. Aroma is fair; some hops, citrus and alcohol. This was poured into a snifter so the aroma a taste were probably altered. Taste was mostly fruit and alcohol. Not really citrus, more like banana or papaya, with hops and malt rounding out the palate. An odd taste, but not bad.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,asabreed,4.18,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A lighter orange colored / brown hued body, with a surprisingly vibrant white head that leaves excellent clumps of lacing around the glass.  Smell: All sweet malt and tropical fruit for the most part, but not syrupy tropical fruit, more like someone squeezed some of the juice into the brew. A faint bit of hops in the nose too along with some breadiness and grain also apparent.  Taste: I imagine this would be sweet enough to turn some people off, but the hop backbone leaves enough there so it's easy to drink. Lingering malt and fruit continues throughout, with some slight citrus and apple skin there too. The hops linger also, giving it some citrus bitterness, which melds nice with the fruity overtones.  Mouthfeel: Awesomely creamy in this medium-bodied brew, which is probably why the head remains as it is, never really fading too much throughout.  Drinkability: One of my favorite session beers in general, and certainly one of my faves for the Maibock style. Relatively easy to find, this is probably Rogue's most popular brew, and it's one they do extremely well and one that I like to enjoy quite often.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Alexmc2,3.39,"Very sweet, medium bodied ale. Good balance of hops, great example of its style, though I am not a fan of the maibock, this particular brew was well worth the time I spent drinking it down during happy hour at The Mews in Wakefield, RI.

132,355,greebsnarf,3.75,"This was a really nice peach color with a red tint, but the slight head collapsed quickly and left no trace. Aroma of sweet malts with blueberries lurking in the background. A big coffee taste, slightly burnt, and a metallic trace are the primary flavors, with a dry, hoppy finish. The taste could have been fresher, I thought, and the slightly chalky finish reduced the drinkability, but it's still pretty good... and I loved that blueberry touch.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,eballard,4.02,This beer pours amber brown with a light head. The head on my beer died fairly quick. The smell is a clean sweet malt. The taste is very surprising. It starts a sweet fruity malt with a bit of a raspberry flavor. The beer has a clean finish with a bit of a hops spice. This beer is clean and smooth without much of a hard bite at all. Its well blended and goes down smooth. Over all I was quite pleased with this beer. I had never had it before this tasting and it caught me off guard. I would certainly recommend this beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Smell--slightly sweet, a touch of hops  Taste--I was surprised how rich and robust this was. It had been a while since I had one and forgot how flavorful it was. Rich maltiness, could use a little more hoppy flavor to balance it, but it was very good.  Mouthfeel--Excellent carbonation  Notes--This was a very tasty beer, I'd certainly recommend it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

S - Slightly sweet and toasty malt.  T - Sweet and malty, quite biscuity and bready, as well. As it warms, a bit of hops rear their head. A bit of a drying finish, less than expected for the ABV, however.  M - Moderately heavy; aggressive carbonation, but still smooth going down the throat.  D - Quite drinkable; not as heavy as some sessionable brews. Could pound a few of these, if not for the high ABV.  All in all, quite a good brew... my first review of a Maibock, but not my first time drinking a Dead Guy. Won't be my last, either.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some hoppiness in the smell, but not s much in the taste. Taste is sweet carmel, but not overly so, with a bit of the hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Quite pleasant.  Carbonation is nice, and makes a very nice sipper. Alcohol is not even noticeable. Hard to drink just one.  This is a favorite ""all the time"" beer. Along with Kentucky Ale, this is usually in my fridge at all times, and one of those beers I typically reach for after work. Not a special or extreme option, but a damn nice beer regardless.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,supercolter,4.28,"Appearance is very good. I was disappointed at the lack of head and lacing, but overwhelmed by the color and the texture I could see in this beer. Smell is good as well. Some caramell malt and citrus fruit greet you, with a bit of alcohol at the back bone. Taste is a bit more dry than the smell. Still very good, the malt is a bit drier than expected and some hops peak through as the beer warms. Mouthfeel and drinkability are what this beer is all about though. Feels smooth and finishes smooth, a tiny bit bitter but makes you want more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,wolffman17,4,"Dead Guy pours a dark, cloudy amber. A big ivory head forms and leaves a nice web of lace. The appearance leaves no doubt that it's a finely crafted beer. The aroma is full of caramel malts and dark fruit. The hops are most evident with the first whiff. This brew is rich and full-flavored. It's sweet but balanced with just the right amount of hops. The alcohol is hidden well, but has its presence in the background. Plenty of warmth in the stomach. Highly drinkable and easy to forget that it's 6.5% abv. I enjoyed it more as it warmed.  Dead Guy was one of the first ""good"" beers that made me realize I need to explore the beer world more. It's rich, complex, flavorful, and easy to drink. A solid craft beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Deconstructionis,4.3,"Maybe the best ""any time"" beer rogue makes.   This is golden amber. finely beaded, fluffy white head that persists. The aroma is roasted and caramel malts with an undertone od astringent hops..  It's hard to describe the taste as it's both quite sweet and quite bitter. Depending on whether you drink it alone or with food one or the other can dominate. For some reason it seems more bitter when served with food. There is a hint of alcohol taste but it's in the background and not overpowering. I actually think this is misclassified here as a Maibock because it is fermented with a top-fermenting ale yeast and a Maibock is a lager. It definitely tastes more similar to what one expects from an ale as opposed to a German lager.  It's medium bodied with a smooth finish offset by relatively high carbonation.  This is simply a great beer. Maybe the absolute best that can be found in most supermarkets anywhere in the country.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,irishtimepiece,3.73,"Poured from a bomber into a one litre mug.  The color is very nice, but what little head there is disappears and leaves no lacing. Smell is faint but sweet.

Sorta maibock like... pours a darkish brown with some amber colorings. Very little cream colored head, that dwindled down to a small ring. Little lacing, but that seams typical, i think.  Very caramel malty aroma, not much else present.  Drinkable with ale tendencies [ as i read they use an ale yeast] some bitterness present. malty back taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Upfront sweet, caramel smell with a touch of fruity hops in background.  The taste was sweet, caramel-candy-like malt. Some hops in the background lended it a slighty fruitiness to it. The alcohol comes through a bit, but does not interfere with the flavors. In fact, if anything it enhances them. A delicious taste.  The feel was medium to full-bodied. Sweetness lingers a bit, but does not become cloying at all. Complexity and alcohol make it not as smooth as it could be, but fairly smooth nevertheless. The flavors linger.  A good interpretation of the style, and a very enjoyable brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

M/D- Fully body, heavy in the mouth and a little sticky but still smooth enough and highly drinkable.  Notes- This is a unique beer and definitely worth a try.

It tastes like yeasty bread, sweet malt, apricots and other citrus fruit. It tastes sweet and bitter at the same time, but it finshes with a bitter aftertaste. This is a very well balanced beer.

Taste: Very smooth. Very balanced. Nice malt backbone with a delicious hop finish. The hops in this beer are very nice.

Poured a brown with little carbonation and not much of a head doing a standard tilt the glass until half full and then pour down the center. The next glass I poured the entire thing right down the center from about 6"" and got a nice looking dense head.  Smell was of a hearty bread with a little citrusy hops. Very nice. The kind of aroma that makes you want to start chugging it down.  The taste was spot on with the aroma. Bready and citrusy. Very good.  The mouthfeel was awesome. Very heavy and smooth feel. Goes down very easy.  Very drinkable (I had 4 last night). The 6.5% ABV could sneak up on you though if you're not careful.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

I could drink these all night long very nicely balanced, another great offering from the good guys at Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,gotbeer,4,"This is a solid beer. An oddity to the style. It's a maibock brewed with an ale yeast strain, which I guess technically makes it not a maibock (which is a lager). All the same- it's good.  The appearance is hazy orange with a white head. The smell is of bread with some fruit. The taste confirms the smell with some homemade bread flavors, and some fruit like apple and mango. There is a nice hop balance that makes for far above average drinkability.

A tad bit citrusy as well.  T: Quite bitter at first sip, but quickly the caramel malts from the smell catch up and over power. I don't really know how to describe it but this beer has the best tasting sweet malts I have ever had. Strong but not overkill. Aftertaste is bitter. The only reason I'm not giving this a five is because it's the only maibock I've ever had and don't really know how it stacks up to others... I do know that out of all the beers in general that I've had, this is definatly my favorite.  M: Medium bodied and very smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation.

132,355,demcorhip,4.18,"Much thanks to Chonyr for this one.  Appearance Poured a nice and deep tawny amber colour with a generous light tan coloured head, which faded to interesting lacings. As i enjoyed the aroma of this brew the tipping of the glass swirled the lacings into an interesting crescent shape which turned into an almost s shaped double crescent with further tips up to my nose.  Aroma Sweet estery bready smells greated my nose with a hint of caramel. Hops added a a hint of pine to the yeasty and malty aromas.  Taste Fruity and floral honeyed toast with hints of toffee and finishes with a pleasant bitter piney flavour. A wonderful creation from a bastardization of styles, suppose it would take a rogue to make a beer like this.  Mouthfeel A very satisfying beer, enough taste and substance to be a very satisfying and drinkable brew. The maltiness is wonderfully balanced by the hops which seem to contribute a crisp finish to this beer.  Drinkability Very easy and pleasurable to drink. Substantial enough to be satisfied with one, if you can control yourself, because its tasty and crisp enough to easily turn this into a session brew. Gotta get me a jug of this sometime. Will come back for more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

There is a slight citrus flavor in the hops as well. It might not be a true Maibock, but I don't care, this is an excellent brew.

The nose is mild, but a nice combination of sweet, dry malt and a bit of hops. But not overwhelmingly dominated by anything in particular. Nice, smooth taste, with a great balance between the thick and flavorful malt and the bittering hops.

First smells reveals hints of orange and floral hops. Elements of the sweet grain in there, too.  Flavors bloom nicely in the center of the tongue, with a dry bitterness from the hops. Hints of the grains, adding a sweet balance to the hops, which finish out the taste.  Fairly creamy texture, with a small fizz across the tongue. Helps the flavors travel nicely.  Very sippable beer. I ordered this after a long day of work, and you couldn't ask for the better ending to the day.

132,355,ryanismean,4.12,"I'm nearly convinced that Dead Guy Ale is the most well-balanced ale currently produced in the US. Pours from the bottle a darkish brown amber with a nice sized head. There's an immediate sweet, almost fruity malty goodness in the nose backed up by a strong showing of hop aroma. I can't wait to have a sip.  There is a nearly overwhelming sweet caramel malt at the front of the mouth, but just before I'm ready to deem it too sweet the hops plow into my palate, bringing a needed bitter balance.  The mouthfeel is almost a little sticky, but not as much as some other malty beers I've had. Still, I'm compelled to mark down a little on mouthfeel due to the stickiness even though it's not entirely unpleasant.  All around a very, almost painstakingly balanced brew. Definitely worth keeping this one in heavy rotation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RichThatchr,4.1,I enjoyed serving this beer with a big broiled salmon dinner as it had a malty bitter taste to it that contrasted the overt taste of the fish. The beer poured well into a frothy head that remained present until the end of the glass.  It was entertaining to see my friends at dinner immediately gravitate to the appearence of this beer after I poured a pint for myself.

There is a slight citrus aroma, with hints of caramel and bananas.  Tastes of caramel with a small amount of citrus, complimented by a very slight biscuity flavor. One neat thing I like about this beer is that most of the flavor is in the aftertaste. Nice malty aftertaste with a bit of hoppiness. There is a good balance between malts and hops. Medium mouthfeel.  Very tasty beer, with a simply excellent aftertaste. To me, this is a sessionable beer, but I can see how it wouldn't be to others. Good stuff.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,superdavex,4.22,"This one poured with high, thin carbonation. The bubbles dissipated with a ferocious quickness. The smell was sweet, malty with some hops in the backround. This one tasted like some European beers I've had recently with American hops added for bite. Delicious sweet malt and hops fight in a tug a war in your mouth with no apparent winner. A medium mouthfeel left my mouth sticky after swallow, more typical of your heavy mouthfeel beers. The medium mouthfeel combined with the sticky aftertaste meant I definately wanted one more after I was done, making the drinkability excellent.

S - Light malt, caramel and toffee. Sweet smelling.  T&M - Taste is quite malty and bitter, well balanced. The dark fruits come through and battle with the hops. Finish is smooth and dry, fragile in a sense. A bit of a small toffee tracing was also present. Sweet, dry, balanced and incredibly smooth what more could you ask for?

This was a very active beer, as carbonation bubbles continued to work the entire drink. Aroma of fruit (apples?) and malt, with hops present. Bitterness combined with the fruit created a very good flavor and finish. Alcohols presence became more apparent near the end....even more so in the bomber. Overall, a very good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The sweetness of the malt is pretty good without being too much. I understand that this beer is somewhat of a session brew, but I have a feeling I may get tired of the flavor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Westsidethreat,4.1,"A: No head to speak of, but I blame the establishment pouring the beer. lines weren't tuned correctly. The body is a ruddy brownish gold, fairly clean after the cold haze died off.  S: Nose is malty, some what bready with a hint of hops.  T: Roasted sweet barley certainly marzen like. Buttery down the center of the tongue, bit toffee like. Bittering hops towards the end, faint and not overpowering  M: Medium to full bodied.  D: Bummer the carbonation was screwed up. I've drank this enough to know what the carbonation should be like. Like this beer quite a bit. Pairs very well with food.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,wingman14,4.18,"This beer pours an light amber with very little white head. Smell and taste are hard to distinguish. Smells of malts and sweet tones. Taste is similar. This beer is best on tap, I didn't find it as inviting when I picked up a six pack. It is a hard beer to describe but is very good. I recommend this one to everyone, it is middle of the road with some great flavor. The balance is amazing, a good deal of flavor that works well together. I could have these all the time. Cheers!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mjd83goblue,4.1,"12 oz bottle for $1.49  A: Pours copper with some reddish tints when held up. Not much head here.  S: Initial smell of the big malt character and some caramel. There's also some fruit and some hops, and something I can't quite put my finger on, almost a slight bit of smoke? Or maybe honey? Guess I'll have to buy more to figure it out...  T: Big malts are offset a little by the abundant hops. Also, some burnt caramel.  M: Light and well carbonated for the malts. Works well.  D: Goes down quite easy.  I don't care if this is a ""real"" maibock or not. Its just a damn good beer, and one that combines some tastes that are usually not together. Great name, great bottle, great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,EvilKeith,4.07,"Pours with a beautiful hazy rich amber color. Starts with a rocky one finger of firm tan foam for a head. The lace is thick and clingy. Sweet malts, dark fruits, a bit of tropical citrus, and molasses greet the nose. Taste is sweet, chewy malts, mild dark fruit flavor and floral piney hops. Well balanced, malts and hops come together nicely. Moderately high carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Very easy to drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beerphilosopher,3.59,"Pours a medium orange color with an off-white head of good size. Appears lightly carbonated. Nose is malt upfront, with some subtle hop background. Has a pleasant floral scent as well. Palate is very malty, but carries a strong hop bitterness that offsets it well. Some sweet mollasses or honey flavors are present as well. More a sit warms. Mouthfeel is medium with this one, and not a lot of carbonation. Over all, this is a good example of a bock, with a discernable hop presence. Not among my favorite styles, but a good one when I'm in the mood. Recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Graebner,4.32,"This one pours a burnt orange with a subtle red, very little apparent carbonation, and almost no head at all. A thin, thin white lacing on the top of the ale and a circle of white inscribing the glass are the only hints of foam.  The smell is nothing special...nothing much at all, really. Some grapes, ether, slight pine, a bit of malt and charcoal. But it's a very faint nose, altogether.  Taste though...it doesn't disappoint. Malty at first, to the point that it's quite sweet, and would be borderline sickening if it didn't balance out. Fortunately, the boys at Rogue have really put some love into this gem. Tastes of citrus, barbeque, rum, and plenty of spice, and finishes with enough hops to balance the malts perfectly yet not be overpowering.  The mouthfeel is also very pleasant, as there's body enough to let you know you've gotten ahold of a real brew, but not so much so that it would kill food or sit like bricks and motor oil in your stomach. It finishes cleanly with a twinge of astringency from the hops, but I'm partial to that, myself. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed, and is really a joy to quaff.  Overall this is would make for a great session ale. It tastes fantastic, doesn't leave you with the cloying feeling that makes you feel like an auto mechanic with sugar on his boots just ran through your mouth, and doesn't sit heavily on the stomach. This is some quality ale.  Had the opportunity to try this out of a growler from Frugal MacDougal's in Nashville. It was a bit warm (around 65), but it actually seemed to bring out more flavor and nose. I was really impressed by it when slightly warm. It seemed like there was a much more complex taste to it, reminiscent of a belgian brown.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bgraney,4.03,"Poured a amber/honey color with very bubbly crown. Slight lemony background in the aroma fronted by a nice malt/hops balance. Flavors are well balanced as well, they come together to make an excellent collective whole. Smooth mouthfeel with a lingering citrus taste. Very drinkable, one of my favorite ales.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Brian700,4.12,This one pours a clear amber color with a eggshell white head that leaves some decent lacing.  The aroma is sweet malt with some spicy hop aroma. It smells sort of like a barley wine to me.  The flavor is great. It has a nice malt profile. I would guess that there is some maris otter used. It has that barley wine flavor but in a small dose. I pick up on some nectarine flavor. The hop presence is more on the spicy side. It is very well balanced.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavor lingers nicely.  This is a really drinkable beer. I have a renewed love for this one after this bottle.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,elricorico,4.05,"Way back even before I made an account on BA, Alberta had Dead Guy Ale on its shelves. My roommate and I had a six pack of what was probably the last shipment prior to Rogue's reappearance this year. This is my first Dead Guy since.  Poured slowly into a pilsner glass as I wasn't sure the glass would hold everything if a good head formed. Swirled in the last little bit. The beer is a hazy deep orange to brown colour, with tiny rising carbonation. Nothing much for head, but I didn't help with my slow pour.  The smell is buttery toffee sweetness with a fruity malt base. Pretty sweet overall, though there is a bit of citrus hoppiness poking out.  The taste is a nice balance of toasty caramel sweetness with a faintly bitter hop finish that just seems to match up just right. No wild array of flavours here, just a well made easy drinker. I would say that there is a familiarity with other Rogue brews that leads me to believe it is the part of the flavour coming from the yeast.  This beer has a slick body with some weight to it, and the carbonation has a truly natural feel. I don't think it could be much better.  A natural quaffer here, all quality.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MeLikeBeer,3.75,"Poured from a growler into a pint glass...the color appears a burnt, glowing amber. Rich, caramel-toned, creamy head on top. Light carbonation.  Delicious aromas hit the nose- soft fruits, (apricots?), malt and hops.  The flavor is deceptively smooth...rich malt flavors, hints of fruit, some honey. Finishes with a crisp bitterness that is far too pleasant to be good for me.  This is a solid beer, and I can't wait until I can try it on tap.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,sinstaineddemon,3.87,"A - this ale pours a hazy pumpkin color, with a thin tan, quickly lacing head, moderate carbonation is visible  S - a very fresh aroma, like that of unsweetened iced tea, with a hoppy background, and a deeper whiff reveals a slight citrus aroma  T - damn, this is good, much more bitter than i expected, very hoppy lingering taste that refreshes, a slight spicy characteristic in the baclground  M - medium, overly bitter, a sharpness on the palate, very good though  D - also medium, probably too bitter for some, i like it very much",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerGoodness,3.83,First stumbled across this beer and have to admit the label and name caught my eye. How would a Dead Guy taste?  Dark copper and light head catch the visual senses. I love the taste of this beer. Defiantly bitter but in a good way followed by spices and as mentioned a noticeable alcohol taste. I enjoy this as a after dinner beer as the flavor can over power most meals.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Phocion,3.97,"Dark golden copper color, with a light but very fizzy head which quickly dissolves. Very weak lacing left around the glass.  Smells lightly of malty and a little bitter hops, with a molasses/caramel flavor with a little bit of banana poking through. Very pleasant smell, but faint.  Malty, and just a little bitter. Nicely balanced, and a bit of cinnamon and other spices coming through. Alcohol taste is evident, but at 6.5% not overpowering.  Medium-bodied, with a very nice creamy feel.  Not a bad brew. A little thick and the ABV is a little high for a session beer, but I wouldn't mind knocking back a handful of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,maundythirsty,3.68,"12 oz. bottle into a stange glass. No apparent date.  Clear, deep brassy color. Tall cream-colored head hangs around quite well. Not a powerful smell, but there is sweet malt with a boozy touch.  Taste is just like cranking up the volume on the smell. Spicy-sweet malt with a judicious and complex touch of acidic piney hops. Again, the alcohol comes through more than I would expect for a beer with a healthy, but not booming ABV. But it is not the least bit unpleasant. Plenty of carbonation. Maybe more than I prefer, but it may keep the heavy mouthfeel from tipping into syrupy.  Without a whole lot of experience with the style, I'd say it's a heckuva maibock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Domingo,3.97,"Pours a hazy amber color. Actually almost the exact color of natural honey. Head is there, but seems to lack staying power. Smell is yeasty, with fruit highlights. Apples and peaches in particular. There's a little cracker-like grainyness in the the finish. Flavor is initially sweet with some malt in the finish. After a second, the hops really seem to come out. There's a sour peachyness (maybe apricot, too) that keeps hopping out at me...but it's a really good thing. Mouthfeel's great for a warm day beer or a session. I could have no problem drinking 2-3 of these around a table of friends. This is an excellent default beer to keep in the fridge. It's flavorful, but highly drinkable. I'm not sure how they made a Maibock Ale...but it's quite good one way or another. If someone just asked for a ""good beer"" to buy, this would be on my list for sure. (Edit a few days later)  The more I try of this beer the more I keep thinking it's almost like a ""light"" Barleywine. It has a lot of the same hallmark flavors, but less pronounced. The beer reminds me a lot of someone trying to turn an Old Ruffian into a session beer, which isn't necessarily a bad thing!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,acoatley,3.49,"Poured a light head that dissipated rather quickly. Color is golden amber with a light haze. Wonderful malty aroma with notes of caramel, no hops.

Head is one finger of foam that fades at a moderate pace, leaving light lacing and a thin head that lasts almost to the bottom. Nose of hops, strong but subdued malt (malt balls style candy), and an off-sweet yeasty or bready aroma. Taste of strong malt and moderate to light hops, some spice, and a light sweet tea like flavor. Finishes clean, crisp, lightly bitter and of course malty. Mouth is watery, and soothingly smooth. Drinkability is well above average: goes down easy and is tasty. Easy to toss back plenty of these, and at 6.5%, its not too terribly stout.  Overall: A very good Maibock/Ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste: the tase is a little bitter but it is like a biting bitter flavor not like a really bitter lager, it has the taste of what ever the smell is, interesting.  Mouthfeel: it has great carbs and it looks and feels unfiltered always plesent in a good beer I liked i.  Drinkability: it is smooth with a great balance of flavor, I am still very interested in the flavor of this beer and I may buy it again and that says a lot.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,normZurawski,3.46,"Looks good, decent, nothing amazing. Smell is immediate stale bar room, which turns me off to this beer. I guess that may be the yeast? I'm not sure. Taste is ok, a little unbalanced on the harsh bitterness side. I get alcohol around the bitterness. Meh - nothing to jump up and down about. Not bad, ok. Mouthfeel is nice, light richness and/or creaminess. Average+ drinkability.  I had a few of these after mowing the lawn and it really didn't do anything for me. In my quest for the perfect warm weather beer, this doesn't do the trick. As it warms I think it tends to get a little better, with the harsh tastes rounding out a little as you go.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,clabaugh,3.77,"Appearance: Pours a dark copper, crowned with a pasty tan, two-finger head. The head is nice and sudsy, and retains pretty well. Lacing is adequate.  Smell: Barley malts and a fresh hoppiness. In fine balance. Melon rind in the nose, and some sweet spice; cinnamon? Very pleasing.  Taste: Roasted barley malts and a bitter, resiny hop presence. Very bold flavor, but displays rather good balance. Cinnamon and ginger. Unripened melon, or pumpkin.  Mouthfeel: Intensely dry. Medium-bodied with a syrupy touch. Strong carbonation, and a bitterness that really persists.  Drinkability: A spot filling, without a particularly elite flavor. These factors detract some from the drinkability. However, this is a good, enjoyable, and, in a sense, classic beer. I'll always have a place in my heart for Dead Guy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,JohnnyM2002,4.2,"I was very excited to try this, as it was my first experience with Rogue. It pours a dark orangish with a creamy head and it smelled of spice and apricot. Goes down smooth...definitely more of a spicey taste than dry-fruity. Can detect good carbonation towards the end. I think this would compliment a nice steak very nicely. Also, it comes in a pretty damn cool bottle!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mmmbeer,3.85,"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - pours a clear bronzed caramel body with a few beads of carbonation leading up to a small off-white head. The aroma consists of pale and toasted malts with some sweet/caramel qualities. The body is medium and prickly at the start, revealing caramel, toasty, sweet (bubblegum?) malts with a mild hop bite, and leaving a medium finish. Pretty good but Rogue brews better beers that I'd rather buy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Cwrw,3.96,"One of my favourite styles and I'm excited to try this Maibock from Rogue. Came in a 6-pack of 330ml bottles with the lovely skeleton on the barrel label. A solid-looking beer in the glass, iced-tea colour with a generous cap of tight dull-white head. Good full sheets of lacing. The beer can appear light orange as well as dull rusty-red. A swell looking Maibock. Onto the more important...aroma: the first scent I get is spicy nuttiness, like egg-nog with nutmeg. Excellent malts with full notes of toffee and vanilla wafer, and some sourish bready notes. Very creamy smelling, with a spritziness that could be the alcohol or the hops. The hops are complementing the malting well, adding some dry, earthy, musky smells. I get a lot of sweetish vanilla and even maple. Lots of tree bark and caramel with the bitterness of tea. Bready, roasted and warming. Not hugely complex, but done very well for the style, with emphasis on the rich malts. A respectable aroma. The taste is sweet caramel malt with the flowery aftertaste of German hops. Butterscotch and raisins with some white sugar undertones. A little hard-water in the middle of the mouth, making the body feel a little thin at times. Honey and strong toffee flavours in the beer, with lots of buttered toast and whole-grain bread tastes. Besides the tiniest watery sensation the taste is stellar for a bock. Smooth on the tongue with medium carbonation and little alcoholic burn. Medium bodied, going down easily, with all the ""have-another"" character you could want in a bock. Solid. Thanks Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

An extremely well balanced beer, slightly spicy, carmel malts, tastes of cooked apricots and plums.

132,355,vanrassel,4.21,"I've had few beers that look so inviting. A thick, creamy two-finger head sat atop a beautiful, copper-coloured beer in my mug and remained there despite my drinking it at a leisurely pace.  The aroma and taste were in perfect harmony, though I wished the smell was a little bolder.What impressed me most is this beer somehow accomplishes the feat of having an equal balance between hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness without the two cancelling each other out  they were both apparent in the taste and smell.  The hops and malt comingled at the start of each sip, but a little caramel and toffee sweetness emerged near the back end. The aftertaste was distinctly hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. The carbonation and mouthfeel were a little thin, but overall this is a highly drinkable, quality brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Not very good.  M - The mouthfeel is very drying, thin and highly carbonated.  D - Not awful, but I'll make a point to avoid this in the future. It isn't undrinkable, but it is far from desirable.

(this particular bottle was clear, but it has been cloudy every now and then) I like the very unique smell of this beer. I've never really smelt a beer like it. it has a full aroma that smells malty to me. The taste follows the smell in fullness. It also has a nice lever of bitterness with a hint of citrus. There is a nice (medium) amount of carbonation and a very thick taste. The beer does however leave a lingering bitter taste in your mouth (which I don't mind) Overall this beer was very easy to drink even with its slightly high alcohol content.

There is a yeast 'nebula' migrating down the glass, must be bottle-conditioned. The smell is one of very complex malt, fruity and berry-like. The taste is very malty with fruity tones to it. I detect some flavor that almost tastes like mild oxidation? I wonder if this is intentional and/or a result of the combination of the various malts. Curious, it doesn't really detract from the flavor. Anyway...it is very gently hopped which is noticeable primarily in the finish. It is medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation.  I find it very curious and tasty. I used to purchase this quite a bit before I started homebrewing. Looking back, I can see why as it is very different and unique.  I am curious how this ale wound up classified as a 'bock'.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Touches of sugary caramel and candy-corn type halloween candy. Not a hint of hops in this nose, it's all the fruity malt.  Medium bodied with a smooth yet creamy carbonated body. Rich simple caramel and candy type malt. There are serious hints of a belgian in this beer. The fruitiness in this beer has all these touches of dark fruit like plums and raisins. Combined with a dark fruity sugary grain taste it all reminds me of a belgian dubbel. Very mild hops barely come through but are there with a fresh grassy earthy taste and they add just enough bitterness to give the beer some balance.  Overall a very nice beer. I could see this as killer session beer if I'm in ""that"" mood. I know it's a maibock/helles bock, and it surely has all those qualities, but honestly it doesn't fit right into that mold.

Smelled of doughy caramel and maple syrup with a crisp dry lemon zest.  Tasted of woody bread dough, hazelnuts and the slightest bit of peanut butter. The sweetness of the malt was really understated and subtle. The smooth malty flavor persisted for a bit but was followed up by a nice pine and grapefruit rind bittering hops. This finished with a chalky and mossy hops.  The mouth feel was light, but dense with a light unobtrusive easy carbonation. Unfortunately, this beer left my mouth a little sticky.  This beers made for sessioning. The light sweetness and easy feel were really easy to drink.

I sense caramelized brown sugar in there with hints of what could be caramel. On top of this a grainy smell comes about and is followed by subtle fruit tones and hops. I like it.  Taste  Up front this beer shows sweet maltiness in a big way. I can taste the alcohol with this as well. There is a sharp hoppy presence with a strange fruit flavor which I cant put my finger on. This beer tastes very different than mostand its good.  Mouthfeel  The carbonation in this one burns slightly. I find it to be too coarse. The consistency is fine though.  Drinkability  Not bad. Although not very high in ABV nor extremely robust, I find this to be a sipper. The carbonation makes it tough sometimes though.  Dead Guys Ale is nothing like Ive ever tasted.

Pours a nice light amber color with a good head. Has a good balanced aroma with malt and hops. The mouthfeel is smooth. The taste is also nicely balanced, with malty, biscuit flavors offset by somewhat herbal, earthy hops.  Very drinkable and the bottle is cool too.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

If it's a bottom-fermented bock beer, then call it that. Even the bottle says ale but whatever.  Very pretty dark brown with an acceptable, ivory head. Subdued smell of malt and hops, characteristic of a (chilled) lager beer.  Big taste: lots of caramelized malt, good noble hops and some fruit notes of raisins and currants.

However, this seems to be one of those beers that you really just sit and enjoy. Not one to be drank fast but to savor the flavor. I liked the strong yet mild taste of this beer. I would recomend trying this beer at least once.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,NolanGTI,3.71,"Pours a nice mid-orange amber color with a big two fingered head. Malty nose with hints of breadiness and slight citrus. Head sticks around througout with good lacing. Taste follows the nose with a sticky bready taste rounded out with citrus and dark fruit flavors (raisin possibly). Easy to drink, and decpetively strong in ABV.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,scooter231,3.24,"Pours a pretty copper, rusted color with an inch of off-white head. Disappears pretty quickly. Not much lacing to speak of. Incredibly clear. Nose is quite dulled down- very little going on here. Some fruityness and floralness, but you really have to dig for it. Even as it warmed, the aroma never really spoke up.  Taste is kind of odd. Sort of different with every sip. One sip is all bready/biscuityness, one is alcoholic dark fruits, and one is orangey and malty and bitter all at once. It can't seem to decide what to be. It's not bad, just... not at all coherent, if one will. Certainly intriguing, especially if you like three or four beers in one, at once.  Mouthfeel is full and bubbly, oily. A nice feel. Overall not the most drinkable brew ever, though I could see being in the mood for this from time to time. Not great, not bad. Worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

T: Hops and malt all at once. Sweet and bitter. Savory with a clean finish.  M: Creamy and tasty. Very easy on the tongue, stomach, and the mind.  D: Very drinkable on one of the first 70 degree Spring days in Indiana.  Glow-in-the-dark bottle gets extra points for appearance!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

I'm not really sure what type of hops this beer uses, but they are quite delicious. The maltieness is the major note and reminds me of a hearty bread, but it is well balanced with the hops.

Not much head, which quickly dissipated, leaving only a slight ring around the edges. Cloudy, orange-red color.  Smelled flowery and sweet.  Taste was good. Sweet, with a distinct bitterness that really left the palate dry. Not much aftertaste, other than the continued dry palate.  Overall, not a bad beer, but I wasn't expecting such a dry finish.

A flagship beer from a northwestern brewer thats not full of hops? So be it. Big malt smell upon opening and pouring, almost like malt candy. A lovely brown body under a cream colored head. Great taste of caramel malts and something that must be honey, that cant help but overpower any hop bill. Big caramel and toffee malt finish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Taste doesn't disappoint...same as the smell...first a nutty taste followed by fresh sweet malt then a faint hop bitterness on the backend. Finishing back to the sweet nutty malt.

Aroma is of sweet malts with some plum and alcohol, and floral hops in the mix as well. A bit of yeast and bread are also apparent Taste is lightly hoppy, with plent of malt underlying it. Caramel and butter come through, with some dark fruitiness lying just beneath it. Plum and pear are noticible. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and crisp, very full and satisfying. Drinkability is very good. A very nice ale, interesting twist on a maibock, equally good on a crisp fall day or at the beginning of spring.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Seems like there's some alcohol presence. Some residual floral hop.  T: Wow. The flavor really ramps up on this. It starts sweet with some alcohol sweetnes, caramel, toasty and then the hops kick in. Some lemon peel and grapefruit then give way to a floral, but bitter finish. The aftertaste is all bitter and citrus and it keeps going and going.  M: Carbonation on the tip of the tongue yeilding to a mouth-coating then pleasantly astringent finish that lingers. Might be my imagination, but I think I even get a bit of alcohol evaporation.  D: Really drinkable beer. The flavors are compelling and make you want another.  Overall: Sure, the label will make you buy it, but the flavor will keep you coming back.

I found it difficult to produce a large head. Still a good looking beer. Head dissipates to a thin film quickly.  Smell is malty and biscuit-like with fruit hints. Very noticeable presence of alcohol as well.  Taste is fairly sweet upfront with strong biscuity malt profile. Strong hit of alcohol towards the end.  Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Good thirst-quencher.  Drinkability is hurt by sweetness and relatively high alcohol content.

Taste is also kinda sweet , the 4 malts make it nice and rich , bit of honey sweetness , then the hops come in and clean up the finish, leaving a slighly bittersweet and grainy aftertaste.

Toasted, airy biscuit aroma. Hints of rounded citrus.  Very creamy coffee flavored toasted malts and grains. The wheat and grain profile is very smooth and well rounded. Hints of honey accompanied by some citrus: lemon, lime, pear, apricot. Finish is smooth with an aftertaste of sweet caramel.  Medium bodied; smooth, creamy. Very well rounded and balanced for the style.  Exciting flavor profile for a style that can easily be pretty bland and wheat-heavy. A very well rounded offering from Rogue; highly drinkable.

Head didn't last too long, leaving not much at all in the lacing dept. This kind of suprised me, as this stuff looked quite lively on the pour, probably due to a shortage of hops.  The smell is nice, very malty, caramel malty, earthy and of wood, not sweet.but hearty. Tastes like it smells, full robust malts and a bit of yeast, with a smooth (not bitter or sweet) finish.  Fairly full in body, good balance, alcohol hidden, carbonation dwindles but it fills the mouth and pleases the taste buds very nicely.

132,355,Oxymoron,3.67,"DOA: dead on arrival. Poured a copper color with strong red-orange colors that glint in the light. A good foam that lasts but not through the whole tasting. Decent lacing but also fades.  The smell is shinny. A sweet caramel malt presence that gives it a bready (almost Belgium) feel to it. A good hop pick up with some woodsy and earthy tone to it. I pick up some herbal that is more of a spicy flavor that enhances the bread-like qualities.  The taste is much more maltier then the nose would indicate. A big caramel taste that really dominates all other flavors. The bready taste comes out more of a cinnamon roll then anything. A light bit of a bite that has more of an earthy taste. But dont get me wrong this mostly caramel that is border line syrupy taste.  The body has a medium feel. Carbonation seems a little low, but still a easy drinking.

A malt flavor dominates the taste--it is mildly sweet.  It is a little chewy and residual content resides in my mouth after the swallow. A light twinge of hops grabs the back of my tongue in the finish.  It's been a while since I have had this beer. It is good. Really good. The malt richness of this beer is not so overwhelming.

132,355,Melchizedek,3.93,"This is my inaugural Maibock...  Pours a very nice tawny golden color with a nicely-formed off-white head.  Balanced aroma, floral hops over a solid malt backbone with some nice sweet caramel to it; in the mouth, medium-light body, sweet overall with hops primarily floral, but there's a bit of bitter bite to it, with some woody background stuff going on.  Very obliging and easy to drink, but it's got a pretty subtle alcohol punch to it - with the hop sedative effects, I'd take it easy with this one.

One finger of head is off-white, and bubbly. The head dissipates quickly to a thin film and produces some lacing on the side of the glass.  The smell is fairly strong and sweet. It has an aroma of fruity esters and to me smells a little like apricots.  The taste is sweet with a very mild bitter hop finish. It tastes like fruit, apricots, peaches, with perhaps a hint of honey.  Mouth feel is light and moderately carbonated, smooth and a very slightly syrupy.  This is a drinkable beer. It is a little sweeter than I like, but not bad. Being a May beer it might actually be better on a sunny May day. It is a very smooth and sweet tasting ale. I would certainly have it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,skillerified,4.28,"A hazy golden-amber-orange color with about a finger head that looks very creamy. Poor lacing though, not that that matters much.  Strong malt character up front gives way to a citrusy, almost minty, hoppyness. A touch of a floral note, but little beyond that.  A delicious sweet malt flavor starts things. Dashes of caramel come in here and there. A faint, but satisfying hop bitterness finishes it. There's a bit of spicyness in the mix too. Not a complex brew, but really tasty.  Extremely smooth character on the mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied. Just a hint of carbonation burn. Feels so good going down.  The ABV, while not high, is high enough to lower the drinkability. Were it not for that, this would make a fine session brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Aroma of munich (?) and caramel malts. Sweet, somewhat reminiscent of an alt.  Mildly sweet malty aroma, caramel sweetness along with subtle spicy hop flavor.  Strong carbonation, crisp, crisp finish.  This is an extremely drinkable beer, quite balanced. I bet I could drink this all night (although, perhaps my wallet wouldn't allow).

Bubbles seem somewhat large.  Smells sweet and kind of boozy. Creamy and a little bit of hops, just mild overall.  The taste impressed. I'm not a big fan of Marzen/Reds/Ambers, but this was good. This is perhaps the most balanced beer I've had. Hops are faint, but enough to balance the malty sweetness. Gets boozier as it warms up, fruitier too. Carmel, but no toastiness.  Sticky and syrupy in the mouth, but that's not bad. Very satisfying. Big bubbles, but still much smoother and lest caustic than others from the style.  I've never had a ""red"" beer that I liked before, so this is a pleasant surprise for me. Not too heavy, but a good filler-upper. Perfect for late winter.

I don't know if I had a skunky beer, but it smelled terrible. I was shocked at how bitter it tasted, but maybe I shouldn't have been.

It has a thin, off-white head, which fades quickly and leaves almost no lacing.  S: The smell is a dual combination of citrusy hops and roasted malt. Excellent blend!  T: You get the hops taste first with a little bit of bitterness, followed by the roasted malt and sweetness. It’s almost like I’m drinking an APA & a Porter at the same time. A very flavorful and well-balanced beer! The after-taste is sweet, but very mild.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation.  D: The beer goes down very nicely and is very tasty, which allows you to throw it back easily. The only thing that diminishes its drinkability is that it may fill you just a bit.

Served lightly chilled in a 500ml weizen-glass.  A: most elegant chestnut-brown to tawny hue, coming with a medium-thick beige-coloured beer head settling to a very thin layer of foam on the top; medium-sized bubbles slowly ascending from the bottom. S: peach-fruity, sweet-flowery and honeyish aroma--very enticing hoppy nose upfront; the second-layered aroma contains a brown-candyish maltiness backed by caramel, longan-fruit tea, and a refreshingly doughy-sour note. Rich but not OTT and enticing enough. Yet somehow it reminds me of some American IPA/DIPA~~ T: a slightly sharp touch of flowery syrup and chemical note of calcium pill upfront accompany a profound, rich and oily-textured caramel maltiness reminiscent of raisin-flavoured toffee and burned brown sugar; gradually a slightly rough mouthfeel develops in the mid-flavour, consisting of coarsely-mashed malts, prevailing bitterness of herbs and longan-fruit peel, and more burned sugary flavour. Chewy, bitter-sweet malts sustain in the satisfying and lingering finish, along with lots of residual flavour of bitter-sweet fruitiness (akin to ripe black cherry-skins!!) in the end. M&D: big, rich and oily initially on the mouthfeel, yet softening all the time towards a soothing texture in the very end; this is my first-ever Maibock, and I must say I'm quite impressed. Yet it's hard to imagine a German lager is so low in terms of carbonation and contains such high-octane aromatic hoppyness~~ In a sense it is indeed like some American IPAs I've tried, and it's so very nice all the same.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beltranzandar,4.4,i've been purchasing this beer often these days  a- the beer in the pint glass approches black. it has red hues. very pretty little beer. a conservative pour gave an inch of foam.  s- sweet but not fruity  t- a second after it hits my tongue it produces a mildly sweet taste that stays after it has gone down  m- its a thicker beer. it almost seems as though it coats my mouth with is malty flavor.  d- really pleasant to drink a couple. i wouldn't choose it for beer pont though,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,chOAKbarrell,4.3,"Very very red, small head, some lacing.  Bready, earthy, yeasty scent. Very calm and relaxing. Reminds me in some ways of an oktoberfest.  Taste reminds me of an oktoberfest as well, although this is much tastier than most oktoberfests I have had. Malts are the star here, and the hops take a backseat. Again, a bready taste, very full body, almost chewy mouthfeel. Pleasant amount of bitterness hiding in the background.  Looking forward to having Deadguy again, hopefully on tap!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,descartes,3.77,"Poured from 12 fl. oz. bottle.  Appearance: Pale red with quarter inch head which dissipates almost instantly. Smell: Strong malt smell, hint of hops and wheat.

132,355,tastybeer,4.08,"Slightly cloudy, glowing amber orange in color with a nice bubbly cream colored head. Nose is juicy fresh earthy hops with nice malt character. Spicey and floral as well. Very relaxing brew. Soft and subtly syrupy with appropriate carbonation. Spicey yeast with a slight citric bitterness blends nicely with earthy and doughy notes. Carbonation seems a bit high at first but beme perfect when the beer warms. Amazing creamy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable too.  Very mellow yet awesome.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,wedge,4,"Slightly hazy orange amber with a large frothy head. Dry grainy aroma - sweet and lightly fruity. Nice, thick, malty sweet flavor with light floral and spicy noble hops. Rich with hints of caramel and bread. Very smooth and medium bodied - nice balance in the finish.  Quite tasty...a whole lot of Munich malts. Seems to get sweeter near the end. Probably too fruity to fit the style, but Rogue has never really adhered to ""styles"" all that well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dawg,4.04,"Having this on directly from the bottle. Seen plenty in a glass. Pretty cool bottle.  Smells like a basic ale with malt (mostly light roast) and hops. Kind of smell a smoky and fruity aroma.  What drove me to whip up this review was the last sip I just had when looking thru the BA forum. The sip had a strong iced tea, lemony taste. This sip was very complex and the first time that I had one from Rogue Dead Guy Ale. Overall this ale tastes pretty mainstream. I do get some different tastes as the beer sloshes around (nuts, fruits, floral, toast) but the iced tea taste was one of a kind.  Feel is good and I bought a case of this since I know it drinks rather well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

MF: Slighlty chewy with good balance, slightly undercarbonated  Drinkable enough but nothing special",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AltBock,4.1,"12oz. bottle with a cool picture of a skeleton wearing a tall hat, a mug of beer in one hand, and sitting on a barrel marked with the Rogue label. Something you need to see to believe. It was originally brewed to celebrate the Mayan Day of the Dead, but is now brewed all year around.  When poured into a Pilsner glass it was a light orange color (almost honey color) with a nice head of foam that left some rings and lace around the glass. It had a wonderful aroma of juicy fruits with some sweet malts in the background. At first I was expecting this to have an average ale taste, but there is nothing average about this taste. Up front there was some juicy fruits, then some sweet malts, and at the very end, some bitter hops. It wasn't too hoppy, it wasn't low in the hops, it was just right. Much like the Three Bears story, but with hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and with a nice dose of carbonation. This made for a nice well balanced ale and a good Rogue product. I wish I had bought the 22oz. bomber of this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,amstelcat,3.52,"Kinda brick/brown colored as it sits in my glass. Not much of a head with non-existent lacing down the side. Smell? Well, hard to describe but I can detect some kind of fruit, maybe raspberry? Taste of fruit on the tongue as well and hoppier than expected for the style. Come to think of it, maybe a little darker colored for the style. I would rate this a slightly better than average brew to drink, have had it with smoked brisket and thought it went well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,objectivemonkey,4.4,"This pours a hazy amber. Gave is some good head, a fizzy bubbly stuff that shrinks to nothing after a while. with little head to speak of. Smells sweet and of mildly toasted malts and hop goodness, and has a deep fruit aroma, something orangish and tropical. Pretty nice. Taste is initially of grainy earthy hops, and some good malty toasted something seems like. The alcohol becomes apparent throught the middle and and has a very nice warming touch. This is one of those I'd call very well balanced in character, with carbonation and smoothness and alcohol warmness and hops and malts all balancing each other out one way or another, which makes this an extremely drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,crawfow,4.09,"22 oz. Bomber  A: Hazy amber/honey color with a bit of haziness. Definately unfiltered and thankfully so. Clears as it warms, so I detect a bit of chill haze. I was a little disappointed in the head...This bottle was not carbonated very well.  S: Wonderful mixture of caramel and toasted malt aroma...throw some wildflower honey aroma in there too. Some grain huskiness in the aroma as well. Appears to have a significant amount of Vienna/Munich malt and Medium Crystal malt in the grist. No hop aroma here...all malt.  T: Initial toastiness, a touch of smooth alcohol in the middle, finishes rather sweet. Grain husk is apparent in the flavor as well. Only enough hop bitterness to balance the sweet finish.  M: Medium to full body...Probably due to the residual, complex, unfermentable sugar that the crystal malt lends to this beer. Low carbonation.  D: Very drinkable, although this beer is not for the faint of heart...the alcohol is hidden very well. It may be an ale but the maibock character really comes through. This is a fest beer and should be enjoied as such...Proist!  O: Props to the guys at Rogue...wow a style that is typically fermented as a lager and they used their pacman ale strain. Awesome job and I highly recommend this beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,NClifestyle,4.18,"Dead Guy is an amazing, cloudy, amber/dark honey color when poured into a pint glass. A 1-inch thick perfect head of bubbles sits on the beer, but drops to a sparse covering soon after. The beer presents sweet cinnamon malt smells with an herbal accent of bright hop aroma. Toasted bread greets the tongue, drops to a delicate but wonderful spicy, floral hop aftertaste, with a touch of very ripe red grape to boot. Malt comes on strong late in the glass. Dead Guy Ale is medium to full in the mouth, with a creamy smooth carbonation. This is a strong tasting beer, lots of flavor all over the place, sweet, sharp, malt and hop. Dead Guy might be one of the neatest, most original, great-tasting beers you can get.  Cheers",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nickss,3.75,"Pours a cloudy deep orange hue with a surprisingly small head, which quickly disipates.  Hops and malt intermingle beautifully in this brew, with the malt finally winning out with a generous smattering of rich sweetness.  Big malty flavouring mildly counteracted by piney hops. But once again, the thick maltiness wins out.... a well balanced brew to be sure, but lacking in complexity.  The moderately thick mouthfeel is consistent with the style, however I find this brew to be a bit too carbonated for my taste.  Quite drinkable... while I was not as impressed with this brew as I have been with many other Rogue brews, it is still quite well done. Rogue remains one of my top 5 favorite brewers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

I like this, will pick up more soon!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Some breadiness is also present. Great taste. Very balanced.  Taste: Starts with some hops and ends with a bready flavor. There is also a slight sweetness and alcohol warming. Neither is overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could have a few of these in a sitting.  This is another good brew from the folks at rouge and my first Maibock.

132,355,Enola,3.25,"I bought a growler of this instead of a sixer because the bottle will be a cool decoration.  First of all, I think there is a difference in the taste between a growler and bottle. This is quite a bit more bitter. It looks a bit darker than I remember and also seems to be a bit cloudy. The head was small but reading my bottle reveiw I said the same thing about it then. There seems to be a little difference in taste between serving types. I have had this beer on-tap as well and it was far different. Perhaps I will reveiw it on-tap sometime. Still a good beer from a good brewer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Brodirt,3.58,"This is the one beer to have when you are having only one....cuz any more then one of these guys (12 oz.) and you arent getting up. It is THAT heavy a feeling beer. The problem is that it just doesnt have the rest to back it up. All that weight in your body and the body of the beer is just medium....think Guiness-. Flavor is pretty one dimentional too, nice bitterness along the lines of a strong cup of coffee. Sweetness and maltiness are sort of muted by the odd alcohol/something I cant place aroma...not bad, just not part of my palate memory.

There is some hops that start to shine at the end. Somewhat sweet and bready. Nothing spectacular.  The taste is roasted malts. Much dryer than expected. Some hops, but not too much. Definitely a straightforward but somewhat unexciting taste. Mild flavors.  There is a light carbonation, but the mouthfeel is overall quite nice. It is refreshing. Overall, it was different than expected. A much simpler brew. While I could probably have another, I don't see the point. More exciting stuff out there.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,arguemaniac,4.15,"Pours a hazy orange/amber. Great floral hop aroma with some malty sweetness. The flavor features a rich, grainy malt sweetness along with smooth caramel and roasty toffee. Thats not to say this brew is unbalanced; there is also a nice citrus hop presence, especially towards the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy with mildly active carbonation.  While this is a great brew, I have one point of contention with it; call me old fashioned, but if you categorize a beer as any type of bock, it better be a LAGER!!! However, because Dead Guy does have a lot in common with many of the Maibocks Ive tried, and because its a fairly exceptional brew, Im more than willing to overlook any sort of classification gripe I might have. Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

I was immediately struck and impressed by the approachability of this beer. And the balance; The smell of flowery hops were present, and there was adequate flavor and bittering, but there was not an overpowering sense of hops driven madness; there was honey and a fantastic syruppy quality to the baody of this beer, making it medium bodied; but still hopped enough to be a refreshing session type beer.  I am really impressed by this beer, and I see why they sell it in giant growlers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Tupperwolf,4.2,"Bought a 6pack in a handsome black box boldly emblazoned with the Rogue 'communist/star' logo. Individual bottles a little less intriguing, with the Cinco de Mayo style 'dead guy' amidst some psychedelic colors.  This beer poured a deep red color that seems to glow and sported a thin tan head; I had to work a bit harder on the next few beers to get a thicker head, which still didn't stick around long. Minimal lacing on the nonic glass.  The smell of this brew is good, sweet and tempting - earthy bread and honey.  Mouthfeel is also good, but the taste is even better; I really noticed with this beer that the scent adds so much to the taste - At one point I poured one into a tall hefeweissen glass because it was all I had handy and the scent and taste were really deminished. Use a nonic or a glass with a wide mouth so you can really breathe. The taste is sweet but not cloying, with rich flavors that swirl and excite every part of the palate, with a special treat on the back of the tongue when swallowing; Exhale through your mouth after you swallow for a fresh kick of sweetness that washes away the earthy tones of the beer and leaves you ready for another sip.  I prefer this beer relatively cool; After it starts to warm up the alcohol becomes more noticeable; Never astringent or ginny, but it leaves a certain sickly taste as the carbonation starts to fade and the beer warms. 6.5 abv - a lot or a little depending on what you're used to, but two of these put me in a right cheerful mood. Definitely not a session beer but definitely worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Mitchel,3.35,"Dead Guy Ale pours a deep, hazy honey color with a small head which rapidly fades away leaving some, but not much lacing. It smells like plum and grain.  It smells hoppier than it tastes. The malt is well balanced and reminds me of crusty breads. It has a slightly spicy note to it which is not exactly what I was expecting for a maibock.

Not as hoppy or as good as I remember it. It's probably been a few years since my last visit with this beer.  Body falls just below medium with a slick mouthfeel and light carbonation.

It was crisp, quite bitter, and I definately noticed the carbonation. It left an aftertaste with quite a bite and a presence of alcohol.  This beer drank easily and was not very filling. I would definately enjoy another one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kkipple,3.84,"Several of my friends swear by this stuff, so I begged one off my buddy Jason and the result is this review.  Dead Guy Ale is a honey colored brew that pours a fine looking 3/4s inch head. Settles quickly but leaves a nice amount of lacing. Smells of hops, yeast, and sweet nectary goodness. The sweet scent grows as the beer warms.  Taste is bitter, smooth, crisp, hops, more bitters, and alcohol. A slight fruitiness in the beer. Departs with a nice refreshing, full finish. Has a lot of immediate ""bite"". Yeast in the taste, too. Left me with the impression of eating a fresh loaf of bread. Despite that, it's not very filling.  Dead Guy is a very good beer. What Rogue beer isn't, right? A little more expensive than I'd like, (around $8 for a six pack) but that's Rogue for you. This wasn't a ""knock my socks off"" beer, but it's a very solid brew and one you should try if you haven't.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MSchae1017,3.65,This beer was tasted in a Pilsner Glass from a 650mL bottle.  First of all this beer is of the type Maibock/Helles Bock which is a subcategory of Lagers. This However is named Dead Guy ALE. It tasted more like an ale to me than a lager as well. According to the Rogue website it is brewed with ale yeast so I don't understand.  However the beer pourse a cloudy amber orange color with a decent head that could hold and lace a little better than it does. It smells rather sweet but not to strong of a smell. It tasted of a good level of hop bitterness with some mild fruity malts that give it an initial sweetness. It hold well in one's mouth with some good carbonation and some slight dryness. Overall its a fantastic beer that can be drank easily.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,sinistrsam,4.32,"This was served to me with a thick head on top of a golden body. The head lasted a good while leaving good lacing about the glass.

Taste is primarily golden roasty malts with enough citrus/leafy hop sparkle to balance the gesture toward sweetness. Toasted biscuits. Medium body, lightly chewy mouthfeel. I've been craving maltiness lately, and this didn't quite live up to what I remembered as a surprisingly tasty malt-forward beer the first time I tried it.

132,355,Phatz,4.45,"This beer pours a beautiful copper amber color with a decent ivory colored head of about 2 fingers (into my pilsner glass). Its translucent, but not much more than the light passes through. Also, it is hazy in appearance. The smell is very gentle. It was barley there or like it was hiding; but there are hints of amber maltiness (if that means much to you). The taste is very pleasant and does not overwhelm. Very gentle up front with the hop element coming out in the middle, (very slightly you notice) the bitter bite at the end; leaves a quite substantial lingering after taste of toasted hops. I get a sort of barely caramel amber malt flavor, with just the right amount of hopy bitter. I am not a big fan of very bitter beers and this one is just barely bitter. Perfect for me. Also I generally prefer heavier beers, but this was extremely surprising. It was simply pleasant to drink. I had it with dinner tonight (and more after) and the mild cool and crisp characteristic makes it very refreshing. The mouthfeel is a bit tricky because it is very light, yet full and fluffy feeling; then when you swallow it feels crisp. It is hard for me to put my finger on but the mouthfeel is truly about perfect. The drinkability is amazing. WOW! Quite addictive. Comes in a 650 ML bottle and I guzzled it before I knew it; so in other words I HIGHLY recommend this beer. Especially when you are looking for something light and refreshing. Its a great beer for a cookout (when that season comes), or just to enjoy when you want a pleasant beer you don't need to think much about.   Hope this is helpful.

This is a very drinkable beer. Definitely a session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The color was nice enough that it was even complimented by a non-beer drinker whom I was playing pool with at the time. Unfortunately there has about the least head formation I have ever seen with just a bit of a sudsy ring around the beers surface and that is all. Smell is straightforward with a balanced earthy scent, some strawberry notes but nothing overpowering. Taste is quite delicious, earthy and smooth especially after warming up a but, really invites large swigs. This is a very high quality ale which could easily be chosen to introduce friends to craft beer because of it's approachable flavor, yet all the signs of a high quality product are here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

A nice gentle carbonation of tiny bubbles.  S- The smell of soft lightly toasted malt and honey have a faint hint of hops in the finish. As it warms the taste of buiscit malt balances with the slight sweetness of the honey notes.  T- The taste of spicy grapefruit hops is a big bold taste with notes of honey malt and lightly toasted malt in the background.  M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel but a bit of a watery texture to it.  D- This is an interesting beer with spicy bold hops and malt and sweet honey notes in the background.

132,355,BamaScholar,4.15,"After sampling this beer a couple of different times, this time I picked up the half-gallon jug to see how it compared. Overall, favorably...  I give an extra half a point on appearance due to the design of the jug...definitely unique-looking, even for Rogue. The brew itself has a dizzying combined hue: cloudy amber and some copper notes, but head retention is poor.  The beer smelled simple with no pretenses...a malty sweetness and a clean, earthy tone were all I could detect either from the jug or after the pour (again, no real head to speak of).  The taste remained true to previous pints. It is hard to find a better balance of intial malt density and trailing hop bitterness/bite. And it isn't really a bitterness, just a twang that comes through right at the tail end of a sip. Definitely the strongest characteristic.  Mouthfeel, of any category, is the weakest element, perhaps due to the container. Body-wise, the ale was just a little thin and unimpressive.  64 oz. bears witness to the drinkability of this standard-bearer for the Oregon craft giant. Very easy to put away one after another. Certainly doesn't seem like 6.5% ABV.  Very pleased. Even though not a growler in the true, fresh sense, bottle didn't seem to apply since this was not the 12 oz. or 22 oz bomber.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Crystal malt, nut, honey and caramel flavors, with a pronounced english hop presence and hint of fruit ester. Tiny rushing bubbles carbonate the light body and give it a crisp mouthfeel. Aftertaste is clean, but the finish is semi-residual.

132,355,GreenWBush,3.66,"Dead Guy from Rogue has always been one of those beers I just don't 'get', or at least its one of those beers like Arrogant Bastard or Fat Tire that I can appreciate but I just don't really like particularly well. I figured it would be well time to revisit this beer, especially since one magically appeared in my fridge after some company stopped by.  Dulled bronze. Moderate, dimpled head that leaves a great lace.  How many different ways can you say malty? This beer must be Rogue's most malty offering. I catch hints of tree nuts, cream, biscuits, rising bread dough, yeast notes, wort-y much like the air that surrounds the brewery in Newport, Oregon. Just a twinge of noble-hops keeps this interesting.  So intensely chalky, dry, and stark on the malt flavor - apparently without much priming or added sugar - that I can't help but feel this beer is unbalanced towards the malt side of things. There are good qualities here but I must accept that I don't love all the 'it' beers around.  Great mouthfeel. Chewy without being cloying.  Tasty enough but i'll leave this one for you guys.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,acrawf6,4.25,"From a 12 oz bottle. Poured out a dark and hazy orange with a light tan head that went down quicker than i thought it would- could be my pint glass. Some sediment made it to the bottom of my glass. dada dummmm (thats a dramatic music effect)  I am suffering from a small stuffy nose, so i cant smell it so well. But what i do smell a honey aroma. it is a heavy sweetness. It seems the alcohol is present here, if that makes sense. If not, hey i blame it on my nose.  Taste is quite pleasant. A good amount of maltiness follows the initial hoppiness. It is a bitter-sweet flavor that is numbing my mouth as i drink it- like many other rogue products. A slight floral flavor comes out. But the alpha acids take over quickly and becomes quite bitter. Quite tasty!  Mouthfeel is quite good. Full body with nice carbonation that helps numb your palate.  The drinkability, i think, is good to very good. It has a very solid and unique flavor to where a less-exposed drinker would probably be tough to finish while still enjoying it, but an average ba could down around a 6 pack for a session beer.  Overall i would recommend. It is a very easy beer to acquire (relatively speaking). A great example of american craft beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,UncleFlip,4.22,"Hazy honey-orange in the glass, with a medium tan head that disapates at medium pace.  Smell is sweet malty- a bit estery, with some fresh orange, banana, and some nice spice. It's a very inviting smell.  The flavour is much like the smell- but not as round and fruity, and a bit woodier. The spice is a bit more pronounced here. Spice intensifies at the end.  Nothing really odd or strange on the mouthfeel- medium liquid with a noticeable but not overbearing carbonation. Just slightly oily.  A very drinkable beer, IMHO. It's interesting, but not so assertive that it drives you away. It'd be a great session beer.  Be well -UF",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,orsulacp,3.87,"My neighbor dropped this off in exchange for a Stone's IPA. The Dead Guy poured a hazy orange-copper; I thought it would be clearer. There was a white head that remained for most of the glass. Very malty bready smell, then I got some caramel and the smell ended with some piney hops. The malts hit first with a semi-sweet caramel, then a hint of the hops. The hops and malts seem to be in real good balance, not too much of one or the other. The mouth feel was medium, almost chewy, but there was a real clean finish making this beer very drinkable. I would definitely have this again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,waldowin,3.6,"Poured an amber gold, with a white fizzy head that faded extremely quickly, leaving just a thin ring of bubbles around the edge. No lacing.  Smells faintly of cedar and malt, not a big nose to it. Tastes very un-Bock like, almost like an ale. But not quite. It's hard to classify the taste. A spiced-up bock would be about right, with honey and malt up front, and a finishing kick of spice and cedars. Sweet, but not overly so.  Mouthfeel is thin, sticky, and syrupy, average carbonation, which is visible until the end. It's very, very drinkable, as the body is so light and the taste so mild.

Mouthfeel is where this one shines, smooth as can be and perfectly carbonated, a light yet creamy quality.  drinkability is very high, this goes down so smooth.

Taste is toasted malt, caramel, toffee, fruit, maybe molasses all backed up by a very definite hops spice and bite with a lingering somewhat bitter aftertaste. Finishes dry, with a touch of alcohol warmth just asking for more..  Smooth as silk. Probably not for everyone but for those who like a lot of taste and a somewhat heavier ale, well worth a try.

Smell -- To me it smelled strongly like bananas. Very pleasant and interesting.  Taste -- Slightly bitter but overall it was balanced nicely. I can pick up very faint tastes of fruit. Smooth, but overall I found it to be slightly boring. I should probably mention that I am a big time hop head.  Mouthfeel -- Medium to light feel. Nice carbonation.

132,355,crwills,3.97,"I LOVE the look of this beer. Not much of a head, but it looks like a glass of high-quality honey. Fantastic colour.  And yes, I know it's been reviewed a lot, but I'm going to do it anyway.  One thing I was surprised about with this well-known beer is the smell -- there's not much of it. Weak grassy, malty sweetness, but not much else.  The taste, however, is another story. The first thing that hits me is the earth flavours -- almost reminds me of damp West Coast beach sand, and even though there's no grittiness in the beer, I can almost imagine it. Also flavours of ripe fruit, autumn leaves, with just the slightest hint of pleasantly bitter hops.  Mouthfeel is awesome: smooth, almost syrupy, with very little carbonation. Like the scent, the aftertaste is minimal. Maybe slightly bitter fruits and pine.  This is my first Dead Guy Ale, although I have another bottle in storage which I'll try again in a couple of weeks. Not quite as fantastic as I was expecting given its reputation (and given how much I adore Rogue Chocolate Stout), but still quite good, and I'll definitely pick it up again if I happen to see it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

All bureaucracy aside, this ale stood the test of time and I was duly rewarded. Poured to a carmel brown with a healthy lacing with slow retention. Wafts of nugmeg and other spices added to the experience. Had a dry feeling in your mouth, much like drinking cold tea (which is not a bad thing). Left me craving another.

Smells rather appetizing.  Taste is quite simply delicious. On tap this brew has a complexity to it that I never detected the several times that I have enjoyed it out of the bottle. A new spiciness was clearly present and the taste and mouthfeel progressed smoothly from inital sweetness, then a slight bitterness that left a great aftertaste. The carbonation was just right and contributed to the smoothness.

Lively off white head that chunks its way down the glass giving way eventually to a thin sheeted cover. Copper with reddish hue and well supported by medium carbonation.  Sweet fruits, soft malts and slightly candied smells.  This brew is decisively balanced. Had all the smells wrapped in a package and then cleansed by a solid quick hop hit. Caramel comes through followed by the big bodied malt flavors mixed with some dark fruits, sizzled in by a stingy carbonation and mellowed out back to some toasted malts that linger and blend nicely with the subtle hop finish.  Damn fine brew. Another winner from Rogue. Mouthfeel of most rogue beers to me seem so rich and creamy but not overbearing. Above average in this style and one I've gone back to again and again.

I can't quite tell the individual components of it, but it seems to be dominated by a sweet malty smell with a bit of hops. It tastes good. It starts of fairly sweet and then finishes with a taste that I can't quite put my finger on. It's pleasant though. The carbonation is decent, but nothing amazing. It goes down pretty easy too, but the aftertaste can get a bit strong after a while so I don't see myself drinking more than two at a time.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,danielharper,3.97,"Purchased from Great Spirits, Huntsville, AL.  I really like this beer -- it's not my all-time favorite, but it is a reliable go-to whenever I need something bracingly good to break me out of the mild and mediocre.  This one has a reddish-brown body with a thin brown-white head that disappears immediately. Being a fan of a good long-lasting head (heh), I take off a few points for that, but then again, it's a decent beer to look at.  The aroma is very inviting, with a malty caramel presence up-front with mild hops that is quite pleasant. When I first tasted this beer I found the hop presence overwhelming to the nose, but over time I began to enjoy it and now I find the hoppiness minimal. The sweetness really stands out in the nose here.  The taste is nicely balanced, with the caramel sweetness mixed with nice hoppiness. In my notes I listed this beer as ""flavorful, arousing, and highly pleasant"". I'm pretty sure that I meant ""arousing"" in a perfectly clean sense, but I'm listing it just in case anyone feels it might have aphrodisiacal properties.  Medium body with medium carbonation, and the hops at the end give this one a nice pleasant aftertaste. Again, when first tasting this brew I found the aftertaste overwhelming, but I have quickly grown to love it.  Overall drinkability solid. I find this to be a near-perfect dinner beer -- those new to the beer might want to give it a few tries, as the overall quality of the beer can sneak up on you when you're not looking.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,fromage,3.87,"I must have had a bad bottle of this a year ago which turned me off for a while. A nice beer for that transition from hot to cold (or vice versa, as intended for the style). I don't have a ton of experience with bocks, but this seemed like a pretty good take on the style, having recently had Einbecker's various versions.  Poured into a pilsener glass: a nice copper / honey hue, initially a good deal of bubbles sticking to the sides, with a decent head of slightly large bubbles which quickly faded, leaving no trace behind.  The smell is surprisingly strong, until you remember that this one has about 40 IBUs--not much of the malt comes through except a bit of pears, apricots, peaches, and caramel. No toffee notes. 6 kinds of hops here--i sure can't distinguish them. Basically smells grassy to me, maybe a bit of citrus. I ought to buy some hops and practice smelling them!  Quite a refreshing, bitter impact that lingers until the back of the throat. The caramel comes through a bit more, which nicely balances the hop punch. Finish is dry, not cloying. No trace of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is medium, a good deal of carbonation. Not too tacky.  Quite drinkable--perhaps a bad thing due to it's 6.5 abv! Easily a session beer and could go with many foods.  A nicely balanced, refreshing beer--bracing enough for 50 degree nights. I have no idea why it's Dead Guy ALE.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Darkish honey with plentiful but not overly rambunctious off-white head that subsides as a thin film. Smells of sweet caramel malts and a hint of hop.  Sweet honey and caramel with perhaps a hint of of munich malt. Delicate hop bitterness is perhaps a bit underbalanced. Some tangy notes after malts.

Taste: fat malts fill the mouth on this one with a very delayed hop finish ending moderately bitterly. Tastes nicely balanced with plenty of malt and plenty of hops. Neither one collides with the other. Long after the hops have died like two minutes after a drink, there is a very nice malt aftertaste left over. Caramelly.

132,355,macpapi,4.2,"Have had Dead Guy Ale several times, probably due to the unique bottle. In the past, however, I've never paid it the close attention that it deserves. Also it's price in this part of the country has steered me away. Miss those days out west when I could get a sixer for $5.50. Here it's almost twice as much. Anyways:  D.G.A. pours a reddish-amber color with a pillowy half inch white head. Slow but rising bubbles are noteable in the glass. Lacing is decent.  It has a sweet and buttery aroma to go along with an impressively strong malt presence. Some hops are accounted for, but not terribly noticeable upon first whiff.  The taste is sharp and relatively bitter. Malt and caramel hit the tongue impressively. Fruit (do I detect plum?) soon follows. The hops are well balanced, laced within a fruity/sweet overall flavor. Alcohol is noticeable in the throat, adding a bit of a stinging sensation--but taking nothing away from an overall enjoyable experience.  In the mouth, Dead Guy is full and moderately carbonated. There is not a terribly bitter aftertaste, but the caramel and alcohol presences linger nicely.  Overall, this is a very good and filling beer. Good flavor, impressive appearance and very well balanced overall. Too bad it costs too damn much to make it a regular.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Hops are restrained, but there is a bit of grassiness. Bitterness hits you right away, while the rest of the flavours seem to complement this character as they appear and fade away. Toasted malt shows up next, followed by a bit of plum and light spicy, herbal hops. Caramel and pleasant alcohol appear at the end and carry through the finish, at which point the bitterness finally starts to fade. Soft carbonation is well integrated with the texture, which starts to dry out in the middle, but this fades in the finish. Fully bodied without being sticky. Lingering alcohol warmth at the finish as well. All around, this is a really enjoyable beer with just enough complexity to keep me coming back.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

I taste christmas cake, tangerines, cinamon raison bread, raspberry jam and tea. Theres a pleasant hop bitterness that lingers in the very long finish. The mouthfeel is thick and mouthcoating.

Aroma is unique and a signature of this hybrid beer. It has the sweet cookie dough aromas of a bock with the spicey-fruity notes of the ale yeast and just a hint of orange peel and herbs from the hop mix....great smelling beer/ale.  Starts with a rush of sweet cake-like malts that are swiftly subdued by citrusy-herbal hopping. Fruity tastes are in the background as the finish comes up fast. The sweet malt drops away and a nice German hop herbal tone departs in the finish....bready-sweet after taste and a slow warming form the alcohol (which, surprisingly, is not hidden very well). Mouth feel was on the aqueous side for an ale with a medium body... and I dont recall the drafts of this I had at the Black Swan revealing the alcohol so easily..  ....all in all a unique brew which bridges the style gap between maibock and ale ( if anyone asked for this). Perhaps I feel let down aster all the hype touting this as a Grman style ( and I'm a mad German bock and lager hound). Frankly Id rather drink mellow lagered German Maibock but if there is none available this ale will fill the bill.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Derek,3.37,"This is a tough review. It's a very good beer, but I'm not sure how well it fits within this style. The website even says 'Dead Guy is a German-style Maibock made with Rogue's proprietary ""PacMan"" ale yeast.'  I guess there's a few ""Octoberfest"" beers that are made with Ale yeast as well.  I don't have a HUGE problem with this... but they should be fermented at a cooler temperature, so you don't get the fruity flavours!  The fruityness isn't like ANY german beer... an Altbier might be a stretch. If it wasn't so carbonated, it'd be closer to an ESB.  A: Copper-bronze, with plenty of fluffy white head. Good head retention, nice lacing. Really couldn't be better.  S: The hops are a little more apparant than the malt.  T: The 40 IBU of hops really hits you. More Perle than Saaz flavour. I wondered if they used cascade hops, because I taste a little bit of that passionfruit flavour. It's a bock... it shouldn't have this fruity flavour. There's a REALLY good malty base, but the balance is tilted towards the hops.  M: Moderate body, moderate carbonation.  D: It is quite drinkable. Lots of good flavour.

The smell is light and not all that complex. IMO, many of Rogue's offerings have very average smells, but are extremely tasty brews. This definately falls into that category.  The taste is very good. Well balanced, a little sweet, a little malty, and a a bit more hoppy. There is also a slight hint of a taste I can't put my finger on. The only other beer I've had with something like this taste is Arrogant Bastard. The taste in this is very similar, but much more subtle here.  The mouthfeel is good. Not chewy or light, average body. Smoother than I had expected.  Not a great session beer, but still good. Its not very filling. Certain subtle tastes in it would make hesitant to drink more than a few of these. They are good tastes, but I think I would get sick of them after a few of these.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Naes,3.92,"The appearance is a bit cloudy with a copper brown color and a small off white head.  Its aroma is dominated by hops, but remains sweet.  The flavor is hopy with hints of brown sugar, yet there is also a definite malt presence in the middle.  Mouth feel is medium bodied and mildly carbonated. Worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BEERchitect,4,"This is a wonderful beer; I'm surprised I've never reviewed it. Drank once or twice per month at the local pizza pub. Pours a nice deep coper to auburn color; translucent; vibrantly carbonated and impressively headed and laced. Smells of sweet malts, dark fruits, spices and esters. Tastes about as sweet and dark as possible without getting into heavy roasted grains. Lots of barley, molassas, and brown sugar. Mild, smooth flavors of prunes, dates, raisons, and almonds. More highly hopped than most would expect; picking up fuity esters and spicy alcohol. Full rich body that remains creamy under the abundant carbonation. Finishes sweet and a bit malty. I've always considered this a dopplebock. No matter where you categorize it, it's a good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,zjungleist,3.71,"Pours a brownish honey color with a large bubbled off-white head. The smell is weak but non-offensive. Fairly basic, with rich malt smells, but just not much of them. The taste is slightly complex, sweet malts in front, followed by a strange fruit flavor, and finnished with slightly bitter hops. I'm not sure about the fruit, it seems almost peachy, but maybe darker. Mabye there is a real small amout of extract in it. Carbonation is decent, and the feel is not exactly heavy or oily, but not light either. This is a real middle or the road brew. Overall it's a real drinkable beer, but sorta hard to describe. It is my first maibock review, but this beer is just sorta hard to pin down. I would buy it again, I suppose.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,KoG,4.67,I love it in the bottles and it's even better on tap.  Deep orange body with a frothy light tan head. Leaves good lace rings all the way down.  Smell is sweet malt some a somewhat nutty character abcked by some citric and flowery hop presence.  Very well balanced taste. The sweet malt melds with the hops and finishes with less bitterness than the bottled counterpart. Super easy to drink.  One of the best brews to grab on tap as far as I'm concerned.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,aquatonex,3.53,"Came highly recommended from my girlfriend, so had high hopes. Was expecting something different, but still rather good.  Pours a dark honey color with a fat finger of creamy head that dissipates in several seconds, leaving a very light lacing. Pretty color. Smell is pretty strong, containing hefty malts (detecting a lot of caramel and coffee) along with solid hops and some alcohol. Taste follows suit with a strong but good balance of malts and hops. A lot of caramel and coffee flavors mixed with the bitterness of the hops. I can taste the alcohol, too, eh. I expected more smoothness from the mouthfeel, although some is present. Overall, I'd drink it again if I were in the mood for its features.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Caesar1pup,3.27,"Appearance: Cloudy amber brown color with barely any head at all. Aroma: What smell? Honestly I could not detect any discernable aroma whatsoever. Perhaps it was a bad draught? Taste: Much sweeter than I expected. Carmel malt that was very sweet.  Overall: This was an average offering. I am not a big fan of anything that is this sweet so I probably am not the best judge but needless to say, I will not return.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Illini5596,4.38,"An instant classic. Rogue really has a winner, and an all around great ale. Along with Anchor Steam, this is one of my tried and true stand bys. I've had it both on tap and in the bottle, and neither fails to please. A good full hearty ale which is well balanced and a pleasure to drink. Very little to say about this beer which is bad. Sometimes beers are brewed which are just damn near perfect, and this is one of them.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ReebShorts,4.04,"Very little head on the pour, and what little there was disapated rapidly. some nice lacing on the first glass, but when I poured a second serving into the same glass that was gone as well. Color was a reddish brown, and a nutty slightly yeasty aroma was evident on the pour. I thought this could have used a bit more carbonation, as after a couple of minutes it started to go down a bit watery.  I enjoyed the flavor, upon my first drink I sensed a burnt almond flavor, and a definate caramel sweetness to balance it out. Maybe a bit overdone on the caramel, but only slightly. There is a slight alcohol finish to this as well (i noticed this more on my second glass).  I have been to the Rogue brewery a couple of times (although it's been several years), and have always enjoyed sampling their offerings. I will say I'm confident I'd have ranked this higher had It been poured from a tap. Good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TinusTime,4.07,"Wow I would have thought I had reviewed this already as it was one of the first Rogue's I had tried. Must have slipped through the cracks.  Pours a deep amber with a nice off white head. Nice malty nose with a light nuttiness and caramel undertone. Taste is very nice with a soft rich maltiness. A good substitute for an Oktoberfest when they go out of season and you need a fix. Mouthfeel is good and medium bodied with average carbonation. Drinkability is good. Maybe a bit $$$ for an everyday fix, but if you have a malty Marzen/maibock jones this is an able substitute.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BitteBier,3.78,"An interesting orange-amber color with slight haze and an average amount of off-white head. Nose was pleasant but understated--sweet malts and a hint of hops. Those qualities carry over to the taste, which is nicely malted up front, fading to a bit of bitterness that lingers just about right. A smooth but not chewy mouthfeel helps make this an unexceptional but nicely drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,HoorayBeer,4.18,"Had this at lunch the other day, was quite enjoyable. It had a dark reb amber coloring to it. Good 1 inch head to it. Light malty smell to it, nothing special. Very refreshing first taste, hops jumped out right on the tongue, with a sweet caramel and roasted nuts taste in the aftertaste. Good overall balance between the malts and the caramels. It was a hot day, so this was pretty refreshing, even though it was a little darker than what I am used to drinking on a hot day. Good overall beer, may have enjoyed it a little more if it wasn't so hot. Also, congrats to Rogue Ales Brewery on their Gold Medals.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,thechaacster,3.58,"Pours a hazy amber, with a cartoonishly huge creamy head. Is this normal? Should I be drinking it straight from the bottle or something? And I gave it a pretty wussy pour, too. This foam is going nowhere, but I can still rate the smell: sweet and inviting, malty, and some sort of fruit character that I can't put my finger on.  Okay, the head has dissipated enough that I have struck beer. Caramelly, toasty malt prevails. Medium hop bitterness comes through quickly, leaving a slightly astringent aftertaste. Super creamy mouthfeel and quite drinkable. Admittedly I know little about the Maibock style, but I found this to be a very well balanced and tasty ale that is definitely worth a try. I have to wonder about the excessive foaming, though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,KarlHungus,2.85,"Pours a dark bronze color with a small off-white head that left nice lacing through out the whole glass. Smell is of caramel, and very sweet. Mouthfeel is thick. Overall, this is unlike any other maibock/helles bock I've ever had. A beer that is classified as a helles ""clear"" bock shoudl at least be clear, not dark and cloudy like this beer. The mouthfeel was also too thick for it to be a good maibock. However, even if this brew wasn't intended to be a maibock by the brewer, I still didn't like it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,battlekow,3.44,"Reviewing this, Sprecher Mai Bock, Capital Brewery Mai Bock, and Tyranena Fighting Finches Mai Bock simultaneously. This is the least attractive of the three, a cloudy, dull red-amber color with almost no lacing. Smells floral and faintly sweet. Initial taste is of sweet apples and bitter hops, with the bitterness lingering. The taste is too unbalanced, I think, in favor of the hops; it's fairly unpleasant to drink. Feels a little harsh in the mouth, as well. I'm not a fan of this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Dithyramb,3.51,"Enjoyed via 12oz bottle. No freshness dating Poured a hazy caramel with ample carbonation and a thin, short lived head Bready malts and alcohol on the nose Taste gets extra points due to the alcohol bite, but loses points due to the almost empty hop profile. Bready chalky malts make the majority Medium flavored, finishes sticky Drinkable",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,villainchiwwin,3.88,"poured from 12 oz. bottle deep reddish mahogany or dark amber honey colored with enough haze to render it opaque. creamy off-white head that left chunky bits of lacing stuck to the inside of the glass all the way to the bottom. light floral scent with malt wafting though and a faint tingle on the nose suggesting hops content. tasted caramel and nut flavors in the initial sweet malt impression - toasty. bitterness creeps in soon after adding bite to the malt before crushing it with a heavy hops burst mid-palate. strong finish that is noticably more hops than malt (despite the touted ""balanced finish"") and has great lingering power. felt smooth at first, then more medium-bodied and a bit chewier or oily. appropriate carbonation. very decent brew if you're in the mood for something less pale with plenty of hops.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,PATECO,4.17,"This is my first review so here goes. Got this at Whole Foods Market in South Florida. Saved it for this eavening to have while watching TV.  Poured a murky red amber, very little head no lacing. smelled very good but didn't look great. First taste was sharp with lots of spicy hops and alchohol. Carbonation was very nice considering the lack of head. This is a large bear so I drank it in two servings. very nice rich flavor sort of malty sweet but with a spicy bite.  Plenty of body, but not syrupy. It got smoother as I drank it. The second glass was better than the first.  Overall I really liked this beer , and would buy it again. It is not something to serve with light food, but would go nicely with lamb or beef, or maybe after dinner with a good cigar,  I Got another rogue to try tommorow, I hope it is as good as this was.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,JackTheRipper,3.94,"Had on tap previous, now for the bottle: A: Golden amber color. No head/lacing/suds of any kind.  S: Better this time: Caramel, malts, heavier floral hoppy aroma. Very nice.  T: Hoppy bite grabs attention. Alcohol fruity taste underneath.  M: Looked flat, but has nice level of carbonation. Alcohol feels higher than stated ABV%, gives this a nice spiciness and helps carry the flavors and aromas.  D&N: I think I like this beer better in the bottle than on tap. Tasty and highly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Noxious26,4.32,"22oz bottle served in a mug.  Clear, Orange-copper in colour. 1/2 inch light beige head reduces to a thin layer.  Aroma is sweet and malty with undertones of fruit and hops.  Flavour is sweet malt and subtle fruit that quickly fades out as a hoppy-grapefruit flavour charges in after the swallow. The bitter grapefruit flavour then dims throughout the aftertaste which stays around for a good long time. About half way through the glass, the grapefruit bitter taste seems to mellow (due to temp? or palate?). It still agressively cuts off the sweet malt flavour, but the edge of it's blade seems less sharp than earlier in the glass.  Mouthfeel is full, thick and well rounded. It's nice to have a thick mouthfeel without it feeling syrupy. The subtle carbonation gives it a satiny smooth feel.  At the end of the bottle, the flavours are not as distinct as they were at the start. However, this actually makes the beer smoother and as a result more drinkable. I'm not sure if this is a result of the beer, my palate adjusting to the grapefruit hops or the temperature I started at compared to the temp at the end. Either way, the beer is smoother at the end, but the flavours are not as dramatic or bold. Basically, you're getting one good thing at the expense of another. Regardless, this is a very good offering from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Kreuger,4.4,"Bottle.  No noticeable date.  A: A beautiful, slightly hazy, deep red/amber color. With a generous 2 finger off-white head, that receded to a thin covering.  S: A very clean sweet smelling beer, with a slightly fruity floral hop aroma - almost like an IPA.  T: Sweet and a little fruity, well balanced by the hoppy bitterness. So far I am very impressed.  M: A bit oily, but very smooth. This brew goes down very easily.  D: This is an awesome beer. I tend more towards ales than lager, but this is fantastic. It has more character than the last Marzen I enjoyed, but not quite so much as some of the better IPA's. At $6.50 for a 6-pack, this beer will find a welcome home in my fridge any day of the week.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kpantz,3.87,"Executive Summary: Very nice, smooth product from Rogue...will be sure to grab this one again.  Appearance: Dark cloudy amber color, thin cream-colored head that disappears quickly.  Smell: Light, a bit hoppy. Slight fruitiness to it (cant place the fruit).  Taste: Sweet at first, good malt action, and follows up with the hop bitterness as it heads back in the mouth.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with just enough carbonation to force you to swallow.  Drinkability: Could make for a fantastic session brewgoes down deceptively smoothly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,packetknife,4.14,"Very malty, very malty. The nose was somewhat mellon-like or some fruit I can't remember when I was in Puerto Rico (Passion fruit?). The appearance either escapes me or was completely unremarkable, I might revise that in the near future as I have another bottle. The taste was a great thick malty flavor with some burnt toast and an excellent creamy consistency. You got the impression you were drinking fresh baked sweet bread in a sense. I had to clean my pallete afterward but almost regretted doing so as the feel and taste weren't anything to complain about.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Sigmund,3.53,"12 fl. oz. bottle, trade with maeib. Pours very foamy and fizzy, with a decent lingering head. Deep amber colour, hazy. Sweet yeasty aroma with elements of oak, molasses, butter and hayloft. Flavour has some molasses sweetness, butter, butterscotch, some spices and decent hops, but lacks a fresh and spritzy ""bite"". Too much butter elements, I guess. Still a beer well above average, but Im not ecstatic.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,NiceGuyMike,3.86,"Cloudy Amber color. Pours think with a pillowy head that doesn't stick around long. Little lacing.  Smells of strong malts and caramels with some floral hops.  Tastes of strong caramel malts. Finishes with a bit of bitterness and some alcohol. Strong alcohol makes this not the most drinkable beer, but good.  This is a nice beer. A bit more hoppy than a double bock which is nice. I'm not a terrible fan of malty sweet beers. I think years ago I made some chili using this with good results. I will have to try it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,LarryKemp,3.3,"This ale poured an almost clear amber brown with a firm long lasting head that even at the end of the beer still had a nice ring around the bottom of the glass.  The hops and malt played equally on the nose. Sort of sweet. Sort of biting. This may well be the best part of the beer.  This beer was way too sweet for my taste. The maltiness jumped right on my tongue with the first sip and clung to the roof of my mouth well after the finish of the last one. With some effort, I could focus on the hops and get some bittering, but it was not worth the effort.  The mouthfeel was nice and full It most defineately has body.  I won this beer at a club meeting so it was worth the price of raffle tickets. I probably won't buy it. An okay beer but one that I will soon forget.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WetCoaster,3.9,"Ah, life's cruel ironies. A Rogue Public House, one of only a few in the country, opened around the corner from my place. On the surface, a blessing. Unfortunately, as has been noted in several Beerfly reviews, the place has serious line issues; rumor has it that these poor brews must travel 2/3 of a football field through cruddy line to reach the tap. The result is that all of their beers are on tap -- and virtually none is worth drinking by the time it gets there.  So, while I've had this on tap 20 times, bottles it is. I thought I'd start with Dead Guy maibock, because, along with Sam Adam's Vienna lager, it's one of America's only popular examples of an arcane style.  Appearance: A clear, deep copper with a mottled white/tan head. Rocky with pretty good retention. Carbonation is fine and about average for a craft brew.  Smell: Sweet, sweet and more sweet. Caramel malts soaking in cherry brandy. Alcohol vapors and a bit of resin solvent.  Taste/Mouthfeel: GAK! Surprisingly upfront alcohol. Once you get past that, carmelly, syrupy malt with a saturated, pitted fruit and bourbon, burnt sugar tang. Slighty bready, a bit grainy. The mouthfeel is medium, but a bit sticky; smooth and easy.  Drinkability: Actually far boozier than I'd have imagined. Otherwise, a dense, rich and enjoyable bock.  Hopefully, they'll get the quality control controlled at the bar so I can get a real taste of this fresh and alive instead of buttery and gross. Until then, I may as well live in Ohio. DOH!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,LPorter33,4.05,"Purchased single bottle from Martignetti's  Appearance = murky, foggy, light brown-red. Not much getting through here, minimal head. I like the opaqueness.  Smell = Hit with a potent hoppy citrus blast initially that quickly scurries into the shadows. What follows is a very pleasant sweet, honey suckle like scent almost like a fresh melon.  Taste = Thick and syrupy, can taste the alcohol and it even feels stronger than 6.5%. Delicious tasting. The alcohol and hops is balanced with the perfect amount of sweetness. Slightly reminiscent of a Newcastle but on steroids with a ton more zest and flavor.  Overall = A great tasting beer. A little too syrupy for me to pound down many at a time but this is an amazing beer to sip slowly and enjoy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Zak,4.04,"Beautiful amber color with a thick off-white head. There is a significant alcohol smell, with a hint of hops. The smell is a bit closer to solvent than I'd prefer in a beer. The taste is less dominated by alcohol, though its presence is more noticable than I would expect for 6.5%. This beer definately gets most of its flavor from malt, with hops playing a secondary role. It's fairly sweet, with a hint of something burnt. It has a light feel, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, but I think I'd get bored after two. This is a decent beer, but I'd expect a six-pack to cost $8, not $11.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Very easy to drink and not too expensive. Good beer to have on hand for company.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

No chance. My review will fall in that gray area of a bad low three score. Hey, I gave it a try.  Dead guy, uh?!?!?? More like dead beer. Pours a basic pale ale color with really no offering of any type of head. Malty taste, followed by a little hop kick. Sure this beer is relatively drinkable because it's light for this style, but why would you drink it?

Not sure why, but I thought it would look even darker. The smell is of sweet malts and along with the hop aroma there is a fruit punch smell. The taste is sweet, but the alcohol is also prevalent and the hops give it a perfumy/metallic taste. Mouthfeel has a dry finish.

The smell is not very powerful and nothing really stood out (except the famous and exclusive (i think) Pacman yeast), but it was still had a very pleasing maltiness tone. I really like the taste of the Pacman so I am partial to most of the Rogue offerings. Very smooth mouthfeel that feels like silk on the tongue and the back of the throat. A very drinkable beer. The price is pretty high here in the South, $10 for a six pack, so I try to savor every ounce of this well crafted brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,bceaglejoe,3.5,"Presentation: Poured an opaque amber into a slim mug. A two-finger thick head formed quickly, and then it started to dissipate. Retention was decent. It wasn't so much of a ""creamy"" head, since it showed off a lot of carbonation. A strong, crisp floral hop aroma dominated the nose.  Tasting: I caught a lot of hop bitterness on the tongue and in the aftertaste. There was a little bit of malt sweetness balancing it out, but it almost didn't seem enough in my opinion. Based on what I've read about the style, this seems to be par for the course. After I got used to the initial few tastings, it started to come across as slightly more grapefruit-y. The taste stuck around in my mouth for a bit. The carbonation was more than I cared for. With a slightly higher-than-average alcohol content, drinkability gets knocked down a notch.  I think that what could have made this beer better would have been more malt balancing to offset the hop bitterness. I am open to the idea that others would prefer the assertive hop character, though. This one was (and is) definitely worth a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Litterbean,4.1,"On tap @ Cyber Cafe West.  Pours an orange-red with 1 finger's worth of head that leaves a thin layer on top of the beer and lace along the sides.  Smells Fruity, malty, and bready all at the same time. Very pleasing aroma.  Tastes malty like sweet bread, mostly the crust. There are hints of spices, something like a cinnamon but it really isn't that prominent. Some grapefruit flavor lingers afterwards as the spicy hoppiness finishes this beer off. Very clean drinking and smooth. Tasty for sure.  I like this much better on-tap than in bottles. Satisfying either way, but on-tap is the way to go if you have the choice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Somewhat dry in the finish. Ok body for style. An average beer overall. I know its popular with some folk but Rogue can and does do better.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rowew,4.39,"Presentation: 12 oz long neck bottle. No information about the beer or freshness on the label.  Appearance: Pours a hazy red orange color with a relatively thin but very thick looking head. Lacing is minimal.  Smell: Mainly a sweet malty aroma, with hints of hops and fruit.  Taste: Medium bodied with a nice low carbonation level that lends itself to a high drinkability. Flavor is a nice malty base with a nice dose of hops near the end. Just like the aroma there are hints of fruit in there, but nothing specific jumped out at me.  Overall impression: A very enjoyable offering from Rogue - and a great gateway beer to get your friends to drink better beer. This is one of my favorite standby's, and a regular purchase if I'm attending a party.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,froggyfrog,4.77,"Alright, my first Rogue brew:  Picked this up in a bottle and poured it in installments into my cheap-ass pilsner glass.  Copper in color with a finger or two of foamy head. The tannish colored head fades away after a couple of minutes and cuts to a decent lace.  An excellent malty ale aroma makes me anticipate a sweet taste.  If you're quick enough to sip some foam, it comes in warm and smooth with a toasty malt flavor. As for the beer itself, a beautifully understated malty sweetness coupled with a dryish fruit sensation and just enough hop bitterness to balance. The finish: nice with a satifying cotton candy flav.  Mouthfeel: I'm calling it medium-light. Feels nice, tastes good.  Smooth and easy this beer is quite well-rounded. Would make an excellent session if only I had more bucks.  In conclusion: Rogue Dead Guy - RECOMMENDED!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ypsifly,4.47,22oz with no dates poured into an Aventinus weizen.  Tan head of two inches that slowly falls to a ringed sheet with nice lace.  Smells of sweet malt paired with citric hops. Smells like a cross between grape fruit and pomegranate. Very sweet and juicy.  The juiceness continues in the taste. Malt and hop are again paired for a sweet/citric flavor that is very balanced. Nice dry finish that lingers but doesn't wear out its welcome.  Nice medium light mouthfeel that adds to the drinkability.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,brewQ,4,"Okay- I've had several Rogue brews but never written them up.  Here's my take on Dead Guy- First, surprise ... this is a Maibock? What's the ale vs. Lager blurr?  The tap I got was deep amber to red in color by barlight. Not much nose though they might have had the serving temperature a tad cold. Some fruity maybe plum smell.  A solid flavor, not overwhelming but interesting malt and subtle hop play. A slight warming sensation at the finish. Very easy drinking.  After making my notes I read other reviews and it looks like we are reviewing 3 or 4 different beers! Perception or reality?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beerhandy,3.33,"Draft...light amber brew with off white head.Malt aroma with some cardboard, faint spice from the hops.I thought the taste was very good it has a smooth malt taste with some caramel ,the hops are subdued but offer some spiciness and floral notes.A easy drinking low hop pale ale",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ChrisBowers,3.98,"Served on tap in a standard pint glass. I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer given the number of times I've had it. Pours a deep dark orange with about 1/2 inch of lasting head. Smell is subdued, but is slightly sweet and fruity. Taste is creamy, smooth, fruity. I think I'd maybe put this more into an ""Alt"" category, but thats me. It tastes almost as if it was served on cask, except on draught. Immensely drinkable, though the fruitiness could get old.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,JackStraw22,3.67,"Beer pours a hazy, dark, golden orange. There wasn't a lot of head, and almost no retention or lacing. The aroma had a light sweetness to it. It reminded me of raisens a lot, mangos too even. In the mouth, it feels very chewy and full. Again there's a lot of sweetness from the malts, tastes almost like honey. The hops aren't in the forefront of this, only a little bitterness at the end. Tastes a lot like a less complex, less grassy/earthy belgian. It's a very full beer, so I don't know if I could have more than two in one sitting, but I'd certainly drink another.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,unklesyd,4.42,"Dead Guy is an interesting beer. In a way, to me like a novel that I've read many times. Several years ago, I would drink this at parties, bars, etc. because, well, for whatever reason, and know that it was good, that I liked it. Looking, tasting it now imparts something new. I recently brewed a beer in this Maibock/Ale style and it is fun to compare the two.  A nice dark copper color, a dense slight-off-white head that recedes in a minute after the first sip. The aroma is terrific! Esters of fresh strawberries I never noticed before are subtle and welcome. Nice bitterness blends with a subdued floral malt flavor. The hops come short of being tangy and settle back well. This is a beer I can, and have, drink/drunk all night long.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mgdeth,4.01,"Appearance - Crystal clear; the color is a cross between gold and copper. Nice thick off-white head. No beer lace.  Smell - The bottle says ""malty aroma,"" but I hardly smell anything. It's hard to believe that something with such strong flavors has so little smell.  Taste - Strong malty flavor balanced well with hops. There are some fruity tastes in the beer as well, and it has a nice bitter aftertaste. As the beer wams a bit, I'd swear I detect a honey taste.  Mouthfeel - Thick and pretty smooth overall, with a rough background. The bitterness makes the beer feel a little ""bigger."" I don't think that Maibocks are supposed to be bitter like this. I give it a high score even if it is not true to style.  Drinkability - Very drinkable. This one is so tasty that I keep wanting more and more.  Comments - Interesting that they would make a maibock with pacman ale yeast. From the Rogue web page: ""Maierbock is a German-style Maibock made with Rogue's proprietary 'PacMan' ale yeast-deep honey in color with a malty aroma. Rich hearty flavor and a well balanced finish. Maierbock is created from Northwest Harrington, Klages, Maier Munich and Carastan malts, along with Perle and Saaz Hops.""

Smooth and highly drinkable, better then average sessioner.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SupaCelt,3.33,"Dead Guy emerged from the bottle wearing a dark amber colour. There was a fairly dense one finger head that perched atop the body. This head stuck around well before departing into the mix. Slightly carbonated with no suspensions or clouding. Very scant lacing left strewn about the perimeter.  The smell had me feeling around for a description. Unfortunately, the only thing I could come up with for the predominant aroma was dilute vinegar with yeast. There was some fruits and vegetable oil scents in there as well. The smell was not promoting high expectations for the taste test.  The taste was much lighter than I had expected. Not much complexity to this one. I get yeast impressions at first followed by a hop bitterness that is fleating in nature. The after taste is vaguely like apple skins. All the while I am reminded a bit too much of vegetable oil or vinegar. The mouthfeel is flat and wet with not much substance to speak of.  The drinkablility of the Dead Guy is alright. There is nothing in this brew that is offensive or overpowering. Moreover, there is nothing in this beer that compels me to hustle back to the refrigerator to get another glass. This brew is pleasant but unremarkable. The psychedelia on the bottle is groovy though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,halo21,3.45,"Poured nice and rich red. Very thin head, that quickly went away. Smelled good, with no smell of alcohol. Tasted of hops and fruit. Not too overly carbonated which is a good thing to me. Sweeter aftertaste, maybe could be a little stronger on flavor. Something that can be a session beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ommegangpbr,3.31,"Poured from a 650mL bottle into a goblet/chalice. I may have served this too cold, for there wasn't much head and the aroma was muted. Deep amber/orange color. Alcohol taste comes across a bit too strongly. Dark fruit notes and a prominent, though not necessarily unpleasant bitterness. Reminds me a bit of Arrogant Bastard ale now that I think of it. Lots of different tastes going on here; orange rind comes to mind. Shades of honey-oat cereal. Shades of a high alcohol ESB. I don't think I could drink much of this at a time but I could see having a hankering for this brew. I'd say give it a go but wouldn't expect everyone to like it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,carln26,4.2,"Mildly hazy orange color with a medium white head. Aroma is of fruit. It has apples, pears, and a mild citrus character. The malt lends a sweetness to the aroma caramel to accent the apples. These characteristics show up in the flavor too. The apple comes through and the caramel character of the malt. In the flavor a mild toffee character comes through too. The hops lend a pleasant bitterness to the beer. The yeast brings a certain character too. Many people do not care for the flavor lent by the Pac Man yeast, but I thin it comes across well in this beer. It has a mildly slick mouth feel, and is very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Chadbrew,4.3,"Big head on this, almost 2 fingers. Creamy off white bordering on yellow, that doesn't seem to be going anywhere and as I take a look through the glass I can see a bunch of carbonation. With the light behind it it's sort of a golden copper. Sweet hoppy scent, beautiful malty smell and slight yeast. Tastes great. The first thing that I get is a little citrus, then some sweetness from the malt. I really don't get much hops until the finish which is a little bitter and a little dry, nice balance. Oh man, the mouthfeel is great. It's got body and is kinda syrupy after the swallow. I really like this beer, so does the wife. As easy as this is to drink, this could get expensive $$.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kosmoraios,3.5,"This ale pours a clear amber with a small head that is quickly forgotten. There is a distinct aroma of flowery hops and fruitiness, and a bit of toffee-like sweetness. Taste is of raisins and cashew nuts with the flowery hops on top and the toffee-caramel sweetness underneath. Not much depth of flavor, but not bad. The mouthfeel is a bit diacetyl-oily with smooth finish and inadequate carbonation that is quickly history. Pretty drinkable, but not the best offering that rogue has out.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ski271,3.81,"Appearance: Amber-copper with tiny particulates floating throughout the beer, not sure what that was about, possibly a bad bottle? Off-white, small, tight head that diminished quickly and left a little spotty lacing.  Smell: Thought maybe it was a bad bottle, but it smelled fine. Milder than expected though. Moderately malty, with a nice slightly piney hop scent.  Taste: More hoppy than I expected. A honey sweetness, especially toward the finish. Hints of pepper, spice and esters, but nothing that really sticks out, which is both good and bad. Good in the sense that it is well balanced, but bad because it lacked character a little.  Mouthfeel: Good. Watery mouthfeel, thin-medium body, lightly astringent.  Drinkability: This beer didnt wow me, but it was pleasant and goes down easy. I think Id appreciate this beer more if I had 2 or 3. I also remember this beer being much better when I had it last year on tap.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,karst,4.1,"Gratefully dedicated to the Rogue us since the early 1990s Dead Guy Ale was created to celebrate the Mayan Day of the Dead (November 1st, All Souls Day). The Dead Guy design proved popular and was incorporated into a bottled product a few years later with Maierbock as the elixir. Strangely, the association with the Grateful Dead is pure coincidence.  Made with Rogue's proprietary ""PacMan"" ale yeast. It is deep honey in color with a malty aroma, rich hearty flavor and a well balanced finish. Dead Guy is created from Northwest Harrington, Klages, Maier Munich and Carastan malts, along with Perle and Saaz Hops.  My 12 oz bottle of Dead Guy Ale was from a 6-pack, that came with an invitation to join a local homebrew club. Thanks Dave. I may have been loaded with too many Stones to give this dead guy a proper autopsy. Think I poured it before drinking it between Ruination and Old Gaurdian.  I have split a bomber before while brewing and loved it.  4-29-05 exhumation and reautopsy reveals origional findings along with a discernable presence of pecan nut flavor at the end. Drinks well @ 40-50° although not a showy head on initial examination, carbonation present in the remains after 20-30 minutes. Last shot of yeast separated for further examination under magnification. Rest in Peace, old friends - I will raise a Dead Guy in your honor.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,smcolw,3.9,"Unfiltered, with an orange-amber color. Decent cream colored head that leaves spotty lace.  Spicy fresh hop aroma. There's also a slight creaminess to the smell. Similar to fresh cut flowers/grass.  Rich and malty at the beginning of the tasting. This quickly gives way to the hop bite. The liquor is oily, a sign of higher alcohol. The aftertaste is an 80/20 blend of hop to malt.  A very nice, full-bodied brew. Flavorful like an IPA.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BurghBrewPSU,3.73,"Pours a dark brown almost amber like color. Smells of Malts, with some hops and fruits. Tastes of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as dry fruits. Has a very pronounced malty taste, with lingering hops. Takes a few sips to really get a feel for this one. But overall a very good beer. I had this in a 22oz bottle a year ago, and it was my first Rogue. I have had many since then. I would definately recomend this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bark,3.56,"The colour is dark amber; the creamy beige foam disappears into nothing in a rather short time.  The smell got notes of yeast, malt, honey  raisins, some hops, some alcohol, dried fruits (apricots?) and some cream  diacetyl.  The carbonation is fresh and strong (but not too strong) with medium sized bubbles.  The taste is somewhat sourish with a touch of alcohol, roasted malt and a sweet touch of honey and raisins. The aftertaste is a bit sweet with notes of nuts, raisins, dry fruits and a falling bitterness. The rather long and coherent finish got a touch of salt.  A nice beer, but the taste of alcohol spoiled some of the experience.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,stjarnflikka,3.97,"Pours an all clear reddish beer with a certain foam and carbonation that dies quite quickly.  Smell comes on with citrus and ripe fruits. Obvious malts seep through together with a certain sourness and alcohol. Nice fruity smell that holds melon and oranges.  Taste is really filling. Sweet malts comes on with alcohol and carbonation lifting the heavy lid. Fruity tones search its way through with a nice sweetness and a nice long bitter aftertaste mixed with alcohol becomes much soothing.  Nice brew, obviously no killer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,whartontallboy,3.88,"The first sign that this one's not your standard beer comes when you pour it. It's almost orange/almost red/almost brown. I guess we'll go with ruby, but it looks really interesting in my tulip. Small head that leaves little lace and doesn't retain particularly well. Malty smell with hops, fruit, and a little spice in it. Do I detect nutmeg? I won't swear to that one, though. The taste is also interesting. My first few sips were a big upfront sweetness that wasn't cloying, but close, that settled into a nice hoppy finish that lingered as a hoppy aftertaste. As it warmed for a few minutes out of the fridge, though, the sweetness became less overwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it's still a tasty beer, but it's just a tad out of balance. A very interesting brew that I enjoyed immensely and will not hesitate to try again; worth the hype, if just a tiny bit too malty sweet for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Frozensoul327,3.56,"A very unique brew unlike what many may expect. Poured out to a red / amber / golden color that was almost similar to fruit punch. Odor was consistant, with overtones of fruits, nuts and a touch of cinnamon. Suprisingly smooth texture with flavors of sweetness and bitterness. Crisp presentation of flavors was enjoyable, as was the slightly bitter aftertaste that disappeared quickly. Recommended. A very good brew in all aspects, but it can be a bit pricey.

132,355,neonbrown82,3.85,"I just realized I hadn't had a Dead Guy in quite some time (including since I learned more about reviewing beer other than ""like"" or ""don't like""). Before my hops obsession, I used to be quite fond of this beer. Now it seems a little too tart for my tastes, but I've definitely had worse.  The appearance is a very cloudy and hazy golden with a very thin white lacing. Both the smell and the taste are absolutely dominated by a sweet malty presence. There is enough hop balance to where I can stand to drink it, but overall I am not too fond of this beer anymore. Perhaps if the malts were slightly roasted, or if the hops bitterness and aromas were more balanced, this would make a hell of a brew, but now that I've walked the path of the hop-side this isn't nearly as quenching as it used to be. Leaves a somewhat dry finish. A good beer to convert macro drinkers though.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

There's plenty of sweet tasting malt in the brew, and there's a nice touch of citrus-like hops behind it that becomes more prominent in the finish. This is a very tasty and very flavorful beer.

Aroma is deeply of sweet malts, with some dark fruit notes, and a whiff of booze. Taste is everything that was in the nose, all at once. A cacophany of flavors that fits the bill.

Settles down to about a quarter inch layer that seems not dissipate further. Presumably replenished by the steady rate of fine carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smell is faintly floral hops some yeast and fresh bread.  Taste is sharp with short moment of malt followed by strong notes of tea and grapefruit little if any maltiness. A long dry cascade hop finish. They say on the bottle that the finish should be balanced but I am only tasting hops.  Medium body with a lingering thickness sufficient to last for a few minutes.

Nose is very malty with hints of caramel and honey. Mild sticky hop aroma, a little spicy. Very smooth. Moderate carbonation, medium body, a lot of malt, and a caramel flavor. Hop bitterness becomes noticable about half way through, but very snappy. Gently builds into a mild bitterness, and then fades just seconds later. No taste or aroma of the 6.5% ABV, but it warms you up within a few moments. Another fine beer from rogue",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Globetrotter,4.22,"This is a Maibock? Ooookkkaaayyy... Brown bomber with the skeleton atop a keg and holding a mug. Not much info on the label. I bought this in Tennesse in mid-October, shipped it by air, arriving Thanksgiving Day, and opened it in fine shape on 12/05/04.  Cloudy dark copper under a fairly short-lived off-white one finger head that leaves no lace. Strong sweet malt nose, with a hint of flowery hops and a touch of caramel. The mouth is light and very prickly. Good smooth taste, with lots of sweet malt dominating until the hops come out in the finish. Flowery in nature, the hops are never over the top, just leaving a slight bitterness in the aftertaste, not quite espresso, but a bit more than capucchino. The sweet malt never goes away completely, making this a very easy drinking brew. Too malty to be an IPA, not sweet enough to be an amber, not sure what I'd call this. I guess Maibock is as good as any name.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,babydoc,3.9,"Thanks to mrpicklerelish for the opportunity to sample this beer. Poured from a 12 oz bottle, a clear copper with a light buttery-white head. Head fades soon to a light lace that leaves little lacing on the glass. Nose is light flowery hops, sweetness, but subtle. Taste is sweet and malty, offset soon by a bit of hops bitterness that cuts the sweetness and shares finish- I like the balance. Nice carbonation, nice smooth mouthfeel. This beer is easy to drink----wish I had another here right now.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Backer2004,3.85,"Great choice that is not too often found at bars in Charlotte, let alone beer specialty stores. Paid $2.50 for a 12 oz. bottle. Nice balance of hops, great snesation in the mouth. Appeared like an amber, very drinkable. Wouldn't mind trying this in a draft as well if available. Catchy name and label.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Truh,4.03,"Keel-hauled and had a man walk the plank with this one on 8/28/2004. 16-oz. pour in a standard pint glass at the Blue Mermaid in Portsmouth, NH.  Flaky film of head to start, with just a smidgen of lace as the glass became less full. Copper, slightly weak metallic brown hue, but still fathomable. Treacly malt bouquet that seems to be a plaintive, calling aspect overall. Garrulous malt freneticism to taste, with aged pablum, plums, toasted sesame seeds, and light brown sugar sweetness, though hidden. Experienced an upper mouth slam with a back tongue coolness while partaking. Cacophanous malt affords this brew a simple but direct statement of Dont mess with the dead guy, or you'll be dancing with bears!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BigRedN,4.38,"Had tonight, on Veterans Day.  Appearance: Orange-amber, a little hazy, white 1/2-inch head that dissipated to a ring around the glass. Some lacing to the finish. Smell: Mixed malty aroma on the first pass, a deeper smell revealed a hint of hop. Taste: Well balanced. Sweet, toasted malt at the front, hop undertones at the finish. The taste lasted until the next sip. Mouthfeel: An even, well balanced beer, medium bodied. Drinkability: Would not want more than a 6-pack or so, this could probably put me down otherwise, because it would be real easy to just keep drinking them down.  For all those who are not with us today....",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,99bottles,3.53,"Appearance: A typical orange-amber body; a head of 1.5"" that lasted a little longer than average. Average carbonation.  Smell: Odd. Malty, and odd. Smells of seaweed, or rotten lettuce, or something green and moldy. Maybe Rogue let their hops grow mold, and then mold-hopped the batch? I don't know. But, it's not exactly endearing.  Taste: More of the smell. This is JUST tapped. I'm the first. So...it tastes strange to me. Some yeasty biscuit malt, a slight bit of ascerbic hop in the aftertaste; but mostly....this really odd flavor of seaweed or something that reminds me of it. Damp leaves? It's not the taste of oxidation. Rotten lettuce? I can't imagine what went into this beer. This Rogue is an odd pony, that's for sure. I wish I could find the ingredient listing, but this is only on-tap (and it must be in limited quantities). I'll guess seaweed and add that this might be very good with sushi or other seafood.  Mouthfeel: Fine. Average carbonation, average body, a little thick with malt, but typical in every sense.  Drinkability: It has it's own flavor, that's for sure. I don't like the overall taste enough to have another, but that's only because I'm faced with 50 other taps. I see on the website that this beer is ""in the graveyard"" and was brewed for the Aquarium series a few years ago. I guess it's been resurrected in small quantities for the Rogue Publik Houses (such as KClinger's in Etters, PA).",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,PCaravan,4.06,"From the bottle.  The dark yellow lighting in this room makes it difficult to tell the true color of this brew. It appears to be a dark copper color remeniscent of an ESB. Dense creamy head gives a sign of the malt to come sticks around all the way to the bottom of the glass.  The smell is light but is a definite bready malt smell. Not what I'd expected but nice.  The taste is compex and enjoyable. At first, you get a blast of toasty/bready/biscuity malt and along with the smell, I start to think it's going to be like some of the dopplebocks I've had. However, as the beer moves towards the back of the mouth the hops take over with a sharpness that will get your attention. I would describe the hop portion as being pleasantly earthy and somewhat floral, complementing the malt profile perfectly.  The mouthfeel is one of the best I've had. It's simply much more thick and creamy than anything I can think of at the moment.  This beer taste to good not be drinkable but is probably too rich (and too strong) to drink to many at once.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Skidz,4.03,"Pours out a rich orange brown and sits a deep caramel brown in the glass with a nice creamy off-white head.  Smells nice and malty, plenty of sweet caramel and toasted malts to go around. Balanced with an herbal, slightly grassy hop aroma. Lightly spicy, but well rounded aroma.  Tastes malty up front, nice hints of honey and toasted grain. Soothing caramel-like sweetness and a good blend of hebalizing hops. Hints of fruit mingle, similar to tropical fruits, but with a mintier touch. Mild and peppery and finishes with a parting dryness of alcohol and clean bitterness.  Super smooth and creamy in the mouth, carbonation stays out of the way and lets the beer do the talking. Medium and well rounded body.  Disturbingly easy to handle and consume. Highly pallateable and enjoyable. This would make a nice appetizer to any meal, and would go well with a light salad.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Kookiekwan,3.91,I had this in a 22oz bomber. The appearance of this beer was a hazy amber/brown. It had a two finger head with some nice salty looking lacing left on my glass. The aroma was caramel/honey malt with a slight hop fruityness. The taste was a well balanced sweet toasted malt with a slightly hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was medium bodied smooth and creamy and well rounded. Drinkability- it was very easy on the palate but still had some bite.  Reflection: I've been drinking this beer for years and it never lets me down. For Christmas I wrap different styles of beer for my co-workers to try and this one has made the cut for the last five years!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TheLiterati,2.58,"Amber gold ale, slightly cloudy, generally nice to look at. Aroma of hops, slightly perfumy, even a little flowery.  Taste lacks balance  theres a bitter, hoppy bite, but not much more. Leaves an unpleasant after taste.  Mouthfeel is full, and momentarily takes your mind off of the bitterness, but not for long.  Doesnt rank high on the drinkability scale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,moocey,4,"Had this on tap today at the Ale House. This ale doesn't change a whole lot from bottle to tap in my opinion. Maybe because Rogue doesn't pasturize or anything like that? As far as the taste goes, I suppose it could be hopped up more to provide more balance. There certainly is enough delicious fruity malt to handle it. A great fallback.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,heidelbeerg,4.2,Very good beer. Pours a cloudy orange/brown color with a thick head. Smell slighly fruity and sweet with faint hops. Taste is wonderful sweet malt balanced with a nice hop bitterness. Mouthfell is fairly thick and smooth. Excellent drinkability. Try it.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kmpitz2,2.91,"This beer pours a reddish brown color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really sweet and a little creamy. It reminds me of a raspberry cream saver candy. The flavir is not right. There is sweet caramel in there, but a really offensive bitter flavor that I don't like. The feel is moderately thick nd a bit creamy. The drinkability suffers from the taste. I really didn't like it all that much.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hibernator,4.1,"I had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served a tulip glass. I couldn't find a freshness date on the label.  Appearance is a cloudy orange amber color. Nice 1 inch head on top with thin sticky lacings.  Aroma smells slighty fruity.  Medium body. Excellent blend of sweet malt with a mini hop bite on the finish. Taste of a juicy and ripe fruit that is bursting through each sip. As with most Rogue beers, quality malts and hops blend well.  A very deceptive 6.5 % ABV beer that is very drinkable. This could make a great session brew for an evening with friends.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,zacharius,3.89,"Pours a cloudy orange color with a foamy white head that hangs throughout the glass. Fruitty smell with a hint of melon. Tastes of citrusy hops, fruitty esters with a grainy and malty finish. Hint of alcohol in the taste, body is a bit on the thin side but it is a refreshing brew. Pretty drinkable, especially for the alcohol content.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,orbitalr0x,4.3,This one pours from the bomber a deep amber orange with a big fluffy white head. The smell is caramel and honey with some floral hop notes and alcohol esters.  The first sip hits upfront with a nutty caramel maltiness. Sweet notes of honey and light floral hop tones come in as well. I really like this one...tasty. There's a little spiciness to it as well and just enough biterness that brings it all together nicely.  Mouthfeel is good here....extremely easy to gulp and not too bubbly. Drinkability is great here as well...tasty and goes down smooth. A good session option IMHO. The Dead Guy is worth a try!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Rio,4.08,"Nice, dark amber/rust color, with a bit of head that receeded pretty quick. Sweet aroma, presumably from the malts.  Taste begins sweet, followed by a hoppy bitterness, a nice balance there. The flavor of toasted malts round out the end and give the beer a unique aftertaste. Smooth and crisp.  Very tasty, and very drinkable beer. Goes down smooth and easy, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,scratchchance,3.94,"This is my first time trying this beer, i have been working my way through the Rogue brewery beers. I am pleasently suprised by the smooth yet complex taste.. A nice touch of bitter and a deep flavour with a touch of smokiness. The aroma is also as deep as the taste. I recommend this one as almost a dark wheat taste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ElGordo,3.92,"Funny how I've had this beer so many, many times and am yet to review it. It might be getting close to the lead for most reviews - I make number 441. Pours from the 22oz bottle a slightly hazy, orangish-amber hue with a small head that subsides quickly. Pleasant aroma of floral, bitter hops, plum, and a touch of roasted malt. Sturdy, slightly foamy body holds a well-balanced palate of lightly roasted malt, lightly bitter hops, and an underlying taste of fruit (plums, grapes). A tad bitter on the finish. While not my favorite beer, it's a good, consistent presence in my fridge. Dead Guy is also a wonderful fallback in many places where the selection may otherwise be Big 3 macro swill.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,frazbri,3.87,"Golden amber pour with a short off-white head. Citrus and floral aroma. Sweet almost honey like flavor with a citrus tang and bitter finish. Modest carbonation and body.  Nice, malty, yet easy to drink beer. Beware of the alcohol. It is very smooth for a beer of 6.5% abv. It's a perfect choice for Halloween.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Viggo,3.98,"Poured from a standard 330 ml bottle. Lots of almost white foam that has lasted until the end of the glass. A cloudy medium reddish brown colour with some orange hues. Smells of malt and caramel, with some citrusy notes. The taste is also malty, but a little too light, with a bit of a fruity finish and very clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very nice, fullbodied and smooth. This beer is quite good, tasty and with a high drinkability factor. Although its 6.5% ABV it does not taste like so and would therefor be an excellent session beer. Picked up a 6 pack in Illinois that works out to be about $10 CDN, so overall an excellent deal for such quality beer. Very recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,donnebaby,4,"Dark cloudy red brown, with almost nothing in terms of head after moments. Nose is low malts and spice. Roasted cinnamon. Taste, too, has a cinnamon sweetness. Nice, isolated compact hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Combination of sweet and bitter leveled in the excellent mouthfeel, thick and bodyful. Carbonation bubbles away softly until the taste is ransacked by the hops. Not my favorite Rogue beer as far as taste goes, but great complexity and drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,twelvsies,4.35,"Nothing amazing about the appearance; standard brownish-amber color, bit of head on there. What can I say, it looks like a beer. But it smells great. This is a straight-up ale. Sometimes I find a lot of ales that are pretty hoppy, more like a pale ale, but this one is true to style, more like a bock or something. A mild, sweet aroma. That sweetness definately comes out in the taste, quite malty and ""spring"" tasting. I can picture a bunch of skeletons brewing this stuff up in Oregon. Feels very smooth and creamy (but not thick) in the mouth. I could drink this shit till I'm dead. Sorry that was lame. Let's just say that this is a solid, well balanced, and outstanding beer. Good bye.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beragg,4.14,"I had never had this brand before and was lucky enough for a fellow BA to bring this over to my place. This beer poured an autumn brown with a good head. It's aroma definitely was enticing with a floral hops character. It's taste was extremely smooth, which some might say as a macro beer slogan, but definitely isn't a bad thing. It was just the right sweetness with just the right bitter of hops. It felt great in the mouth not too thick not too thing. This is a beer I could drink more than one, but it's a little higher in alcohol so how much more is another question.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,crookedhalo,3.95,"22 oz. bomber. Pours a slightly turbid bronzy copper color with a nice light beige head. Malty, rich and fruit-like and candy-like hop aromas in the aroma. Malt sweetness hits the palate like a ton of bricks, mixed with some plum-skin like fruitiness, and the hops work well to counterbalance the sweet malt. The hops are pungent, but the malt is moreso. This has always been a very nice beer. An interesting hybrid between the maltiness of a bock and the hoppiness of many West Coast beers (this being one of them). Works out well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bignick,4.15,"This is quite a tasty beer. It pours an amber color with a fair amount of lace. It smells of sweet, fruity malt. This is certainly not an overhopped ale like many of the popular west coast ales, as the taste is more dominated by the malty sweetness. I taste a very slight tropical fruit taste too, which is quite intriguing. The carbonation cleans the palate quite nicely. I would have no problem drinking many of them...it is a very drinkable beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RedwoodGeorge,3.73,"This is a pretty nice ale... The pour was very inviting - the beer is a deep orange-brown that made me think we were halfway to a brown ale. There was a large, inviting white head which slowly melted away, leaving lots of lacing on the inside of the glass.  The smell was inviting as well - good notes of fruit, malt and grassy hops made for a tempting nose. The taste lived up to the promise - tangy malt, hints of apricot and a nice dry hop finish. The carbonation danced on the tongue, cleaning the palate and inviting more sips.  Quite a drinkable brew - good flavor, wonderful color and an inviting nose. What more could you want?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,skybluewater,4.47,"From a 22oz bomber, pours a clear amber color, massive foamy head that takes forever to recede to a thin ring. Oddly enough, lacing doesn't appear until the second pour (what's up with that?). Smells like bread just out of the oven and cotton candy-very unique, at least to me, but very nice. Tastes of heavenly sweet malt and the caramelized parts of a loaf of good bread.  Very tasty brew here, one I could happily sip all day (or night actually) long.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Gagnonsux,4.2,"Wow, I'm really glad I got around to trying this beer. Dead Guy Ale pours a dark and slightly hazy amber color. The head is light brown and lightly creamy. Head height is average. Smell is nice and malty. It has that sweet, bready aroma. Taste is excellent! Flavor is initially malty sweet, then the nice, slightly bitter hops kick in and really balance this brew out. Finish is a tasty, sweet blend of hops and malts. It seems like every sip I notice something new about this beer. Mouthfeel is right on, and drinkability only suffers from the filling nature of Dead Guy Ale. For me this beer is a ""must try"".",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AndIWantYou,2.7,"Cardboard and honey. That's all I get from this beer. I didn't like it last time I tried it, but I thought perhaps my tastes had matured to the point where I'd enjoy it. I was, unfortunately, wrong.  It looks and smells like a beer I should enjoy, and I typically like sweetness in my beers, but this is almost cloying and definitely has some ""off"" notes. Mouthfeel is nice, though, with a bit of creaminess. Overall, the more I drink it, the more palatable it gets, but I can't recommend this brew.  (Maybe this is how a maibock is supposed to taste; your mileage may vary.)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,afinepilsner,3.63,this beer poured a orange brown that reminded me of a dark iced tea.The inch head quickly disapeared with no lacing at all. The smell was lightly of malt with a hint of hops. When tasting the malt comes through with a light hop taste. Lightly sweet. The body is medium to light. This is an easy drinking beer that I could have several in one sitting.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bigbeerdrinka,4,"Pours a deep coppery orange color with a firm white head about an inch thick that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Aromas consist of sweet caramel, some toasty malts, and a bit of zesty hop. Initial flavors consist of a bit of citrus flavoring followed by a wide arrange of malts which leave a multitude of flavors ranging from toffee, to biscuit, some caramel sweetness, and a doughy bread like flavor. There is also a nice estery yeast flavor in the mix which really adds some complex flavors to the brew. The finish is quite citrusy and zesty from a nice strong hop finish. Overall this brew is light to medium bodied with a refreshingly crisp carbonation that is almost biting on the tongue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,surfmeister,4.05,"I didn't expect to like this one, but what a surprise!, copper color, sturdy head, malty and dried fruit in the bouquet, strong hop in the mouth, well balanced by malt and fruit complexity.

A must try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BrewMan13,4.4,"Bought a 6 of this awhile ago, finishing the last one now. Appearance is a dark orange/light brown. What impresses me is that its not very dark, but you still cant see through it, a feature that I very much enjoy in beers that I might not expect it. Small head which slowly dissipates and no lacing. I pick up on some (caramel?) malts in the nose, not much else cause my nose is a little stuffy today. I think the 2 things that best describe the flavor is that it is well-balanced and subtley forceful. By the latter, I mean that it makes itself known, but without being obtrusive. I had this with some sausage and onion pizza, which I put garlic and hot pepper flakes on (I know, not a good pairing, especially for a review. As a rule, I seldom like to drink craft brews when I eat.) But despite of the powerful flavors in the meal that accompanied it, the flavor of the dead guy never seemed to waiver or submit. As I said, its a well done balance between the malts and hops...a feat I am thankfull for, not being a hophead. The slightly sweet malts are noticed 1st, with the hops making their presence known at the end and in the aftertaste, but not too much so. Just the right amount of carbonation and smoothness in the mouthfeel. Very high drinkability, and a recommended brew for those who dont normally go for the hoppy stuff but still want something with a little bit of bite.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mynie,4.35,"Nice in all aspects.  Pours a pretty amber color with a small head. Smells vaugely sweet with a hint of caramel and hops. Taste was very smooth, sweet and uncomplicated (perhaps the way that an ideal death should be?) with a very nice caramel aftertaste with a hint of fruit.  Full bodied, goes down like butter. High alcohol %, though, and since it's so smooth it's easy to drink too many of these...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RedDiamond,3.32,"The first time I drank Dead Guy Ale, it was from a 22 oz. bomber. I enjoyed the cool-as-heck glow-in-the-dark bottle and thought that the beer was decent but not outstanding. I scribbled a few notes on my impressions but held off on writing a review. Last week I revisited the Dead Guy at Rogues waterfront brewery in Newport and was fairly disappointed. This beer is nice, but not as fantastic as Rogues other creations.  To begin with I was served from an old tap. The Rogue Brewers On The Bay alehouse is a world-class brewpub. But its still a tiny one-room place in a small town and it closes at 9PM. I cant see that they do enough business, even in the peak of July tourist season, to justify 20 brews on tap. Without sufficient turnover, the beers go flat. I accept no excuses for a stale beers at a brewpub.  Dead Guy is not bad. Not bad at all. The pint I was served had almost no head, limited carbonation, and no lace whatsoever. It was a flat bronze color, clear but without luster. It had a light aroma of sweet malts and an adequate mouthfeel, but was nowhere up to Rogues customary high standards. It tastes well balanced and clean with a rounded malt profile and a punctual finish. But as the name might suggest, the Dead Guy lacks vitality.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ken3c,4.27,I missed the pour but it was set in front of me as a clear medium amber in a frosted glass. Halo of foam wanted to leave a little lacing but for the damn frosted glass. The head was completely gone by about 2/3 down. It looked nice even considering the serving faux pax.  Aroma of roasted malt and touch of flowery hops. It should be quite tasty.  Very tasty with some subtle bonus flavors of fruits and and interesting chalky note. Slight crescendo of bitterness is quite welcome.  Quite a smooth mouthfeel with a medium to heavy body.  Very drinkable for a beer that heavy. The light carbonation might have something to do with it.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mattcrill,3.53,Appearance: 12 oz bottle from World Market. Pours a hazy amber color with a white to tan head.  Smell: A balanced blend of hops and malt with some hints of alcohol and maybe some spice that brushes the nose.  Taste: Hops and malt both but more hops. It's got a sweet aftertaste but the first thing I taste is definitely the hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Very chunky and heavy. Overpowering carbonation which makes some of the nuances of the beer hard to pick up at times.  Drinkability: Ok for me. Seemed very filling and I'm not sure if I could have more than one of these in a sitting. A good representation of the style and certainly a well made brew but I probably won't be back for more.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,misterscooter,4.36,"A new favorite. It has been a while since I've had a Rogue and I'm glad I grabbed this one (again?). A great bottle and label with even better beer inside. It pours a nice, solid reddish amber with a head that holds its form well. Not too much strength in the smell, but it made me think of clean, fresh, mountain air (whatever that means, other than I couldn't put my finger on any one thing).  The taste is bold and oaky but very smooth, not over-powering. It sits well on the tongue and new flavors emerge as you easily hold it for more of a taste. One quick bite as it goes down and the glass comes up for another drink.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BJ1833,3.83,"22oz Bomber  Roasted malt aroma that's almost fruity. Taste is malty, but balanced, with a bitter hop finish. Medium body with good carbonation. Although smooth with a balanced flavor, you can easily taste the alcohol in this beer.  Overall a solid, great tasting beer that's easy to drink and a good representation of the style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,oxmasterscream,4.05,"Pours a cloudy, dark amber with a dense head that dissipates quickly. Smells of sour apples, cherries and caramel malt - yum. Taste is plenty malty but is balanced nicely by spicy hops as well. Candy-esque tastes show through in different capacities as you drink it and it warms; whether it's the reported ""cotton candy"" or caramel apples. Finishes mildly bitter. On the tongue, it's medium to full and ever so smooth. A blanket of gentle carbonatin soothes the tongue. A great, highly drinkable, classic American micro that should be tried at least once by all. There's always room for some in my fridge.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,wyllder,4.52,"On tap at the Moan and Dove, Amherst MA.  Pours a cloudy caramel amber with a modest head that recedes to leave a faint lacing on the glass as you go.  Nose is interesting. Malty. Lots of caramel going on here. Sugar too. After agitating and sniffing several times the scent I indentified was that of a Sugar Daddy. Very nice.  First hit on the palate is of faint, smoky hops. This is balanced out quickly with the Sugar Daddy flavor from the nose. There's more here though, and after a few sips and some more sniffing I figured it out: toasted marshmallow! The toasted marshmallow and sugar daddy flavors are beautifully intertwined and danced all over my palate.  Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. Despite flavors one would think of as being sticky or sugary, there's no sense of oversweetining on the palate. Well done.  Drinkability is great. I could easily see myself ordering more of these in the future.  Overall, a top-notch beer. In fact, the Randallized DFH 90 Minute I had after this tasted truly one-dimensional.  Wyll-",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,waughbrew,3.48,"Auburn with a lot of highlights, nice head. Smell is of caramel malts. A good candiness in this brew, but a malt/hop interplay that is kind of annoying. Big body, smooth.  Like most of Rogue's stuff, this fails to impress me. I think I am narrowing it down to their odd bittering hoppage and the boring yeast. A good beer but not one that I am likely to return to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,malthead,3.92,"My first review... Cloudy, light amber with a small head. Smells bready, with clean hops. Taste is malty, with some hop presence and a very nice, solid bitter finish. Good mouthfeel, a little hop oily. Very good drinkability, good both as a session and with food. Very nice, classic beer overall, but this may be an old bottle...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,murphyl,4.15,"Appearance: Poured a dark amber color, slightly cloudy, rather like chestnut honey, with a minimal cream-colored head that left no lace (although I suspect this may be my own fault for opening and pouring it right from the fridge).  Smell: Subdued floral hops notes up front, followed by a blast of malt. As the beer warms up, the hops begin to take center stage, accompanied by some interesting tropical fruit-like esters.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The malt comes out to play in a big way with this beer - at points it almost tastes like a well-made sourdough bread. The malt announces itself first with caramel and honey notes, fading into a sweet breadiness from the yeast. Hops don't show up till the finish, which has a slight oily, bitter overtone. In terms of mouthfeel, this beer does give you something to chew on, as it starts out moderate and rounds off nicely at the finish. I might prefer this one with a touch more hops, but that's just my $0.02.  Drinkability: In terms of flavor and palatability, this beer is excellent, but the alcohol content will sneak up on you after three or four. Unless your liver contains a super kung-fu version of alcohol dehydrogenase, I wouldn't exactly call this a session beer.  That said, it's outstanding with a meal (I'd put it with thick soups, pasta, deli sandwiches, etc) and great as a nightcap at the end of a session.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,usualpulp,4.2,"Pours a nice amber color, with a tan head.  The biggest smell here is malt and more malt, with some fruity characteristics.  This beers flavors are complex, there are honey and fruit flavors here, with tons of malt, and a slight hop bitterness. The taste is very breadl like, and for some reason it reminds me of cereal, sweet and grainy.  Overall this is one good beer, its so easy to drink, that the alcohol sneaks up on you.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,PopeJonPaul,3.73,"Rusty orange-brown in color with a small white head, the Dead Guy doesn't have a very strong smell, just a bit malty. The beer itself is quite tasty though, a sweet mix of malt, caramel and orange peel with a silky texture and a nice fruitygrainy finish. I've always liked this beer, they still print these occasionally with an orange version of the dead-guy label that glows in the dark, don't know if that was an annual Halloween stunt or what but it's cool.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,finepaws,4.3,"Tried this one on a suggestion from an IPA lover. It had a orange honey color, kind of cloudy. Held a decent head throughout the glass. Smell was somewhat fruity. Taste was sweeter than expected. Made me think of crisp, sweetness. Not too hoppy, but just enough. Is that possible from someone who usually drinks dark stouts? Maybe my tastes are changing. Maybe it's just summer, and hot, but I enjoyed this one a lot! And will definetly drink it again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,oracle,3.88,"20 oz imperial pint in a traditional English pint glass  Beer was cloudy and dark with an extremely dense 1 inch thich head that did decrease in height but not in density. Left nice lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell was mildly hoppy with hints of malts and fruitiness underneath.  Tasted very good, with the fruit flavor coming to the front right from the beginning and the malt coming in right after.  Low carbonation made the flavor stand out and made this beer easy to drink.  Not particulary my favorite style, but still a fine beer and one I would order again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MuddyFeet,3.97,"I could drink this beer all day. I find it very satisfying. I had it served in a bottle and the bartender walked away before I could get a glass. It is quite hoppy, but not overhwelmingly so, almost bittersweet. The carbonation is mild and actually what I think makes this beer so good. The aroma has hints of banana. The taste also has hints of fruit, but I've never been able to decide exactly what.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Dubblebock,3.55,"Dead Guy Ale is a good, but not exceptional maibock, at least in my book. Every so often, I'll get in the mood to pick one of these up, and I never regret the experience, even if the beer itself never seems to live up to it's lofty reputation. Cool, painted label, though.  Dead Guy pours ok. Smallish head, not overly carbonated. Dark amber coloring. Hints of fruit and alcohol in the nose.  The taste is a bit on the bitter side, almost as if it's out of balance. The malts never quite get a strong foothold in this beer. The hops just seem to dominate the flavor. Slightly acidic, but it does capture some complexity. There are hints of fruits and breads in the taste.  Finishes like it started, bitter but interesting. Not immensely drinkable to my tastes. This is a good beer, but it fails to get the maibock style completely right, IMO. I'll give it a go again sometime, but I'm not sold on it as a mainstay of my regimen.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,cbl2,4.27,"Appearance:  Cloudy Orange-brown with a thin white head with some good retention.  Smell:  Overtones of fruit (apricot) and a delicious burnt sugar odor that has me anxious to taste.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  This is one complex ale. The sugar in the nose is apparent (like a sarsparilla candy cane), but there is also a smoky yet suppleness to this one. The hops are present, but muted (to my liking). This is excellent stuff.

132,355,andyo,3.05,"single 12oz bottle.  Poured nicely with a small head that soon disappeared to nothing. Smell is piney and somewhat sour. The taste did not really impress me at first. Very sweet, somewhat piney, with a bitter hop finish. Seemed uneven, yet sort of mellowed out as time passed. Kind of flat in my opinion. No lacing on the glass whatsoever.  Not a bad beer, but not that great in the bottle. Im pretty sure, however, that this beer has been around the store I bought it from for a while, so it is possible that this sampling could be a little ""off"".  Note: I've had this beer several times on tap, and absolutely love it, though I am not very impressed by the bottle offering.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,meathookjones,3.65,"Had this on tap at Dr. Dremos. Dead Guy came out a dark amber color with not much head to it, probably due to the bartender more than the beer. The aroma has a pleasant hoppy citrus smell with creamy malt and fruity smell to go along. Taste starts off with a bitter hoppiness with spiciness to it. A nice creamy malt flavor on the back to provide some balance. It has a nice mouthfeel and is very drinkable. Has enough complexity to keep you coming back and it would make for a good session beer",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,longpondbeerman,4.17,"The name is intriguing even though I'm not much of a bock afficianado; nontheless I figured I'd give it a shot. The Dead Guy Ale pours a honey-caramel colour with an off-white head that--I'm not kidding--has a green tint to it. The hops come first to the nose, but underneath are some pines and light grape and citrus tints. The taste is excellent; very complex, but balanced. It starts off with a nutty sharpness, mostly hops but a little sweet too, and there's some good strong bitterness at the finish. The mouthfeel is medium and heavily carbonated.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,FranklinPCombs,4,"Dark amber brown with a small bit of quickly receding head. Smell is very nice, with some buttery pine nut flavors overlapping malts and hops on the back. Taste is much the same, with similar components. Mouthfeel is light and sharp with good amounts of carbonation. Feels perfect on the back of the pallate. It is crisp and refreshing, but it has plenty of flavor hidden within it to make it quite a good beer for a warm summer evening.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,shapudding,3.89,"Poured out golden with a decent head that was nice and creamy. Sugary scent, malts, vanilla... Great bite with pepper and hops, alcohol. Very nice one.

132,355,jimdkc,4.35,"Pours a slightly murky dark copper color with a yellowed off-white head that starts off at a couple fingers, but quickly fades to a lasting 1/4 inch layer of foam. Very little lacing on the glass. Smell is of sweet malts with a little bit of citrusy hop aroma. Taste includes sweet, bready malt, a little fruityness, and nice citrus rind-piney hop flavors. Very well balanced. Lingering hop bitterness, but it's not at all harsh, Very smooth and drinkable. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with medium body. Carbonation is apparent, but not over-done.

Highly recommended and sure to become one of my regulars.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,sinistersteve,3.92,"Poured from the brand new DGA ""Growler"" to a robust, yet cloudy brownish-red.  Head started off nice but thinned out. There was absolutely no lace to decorate the glass.  Aroma is sweet, almost a hint of honey and spice.  Flavor is equally as nice. A near perfect balance of hop, malt, spices and whatever secret ingredients Rogue may use for this delicious brew.  I hate to say this, but I waited way too long to try this beer, being an Oregon native and all. Perhaps this is one of the better beers to share with the fizzy-yellow beer crowd in hopes of converting them to the true beer way.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hunter,3.13,"Love the label. The beer is light mahogany in color, pouring out with a pillowy reddish-tan head. Good staying power with the head, scant carbonation in the beer.  Smell holds the promise of hops, malt, and grass clippings.  Hops give way to sweet malt and alcohol in the mouth, buried in a smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel. The sweetness takes over quickly, pretty much obliterating any hop bitterness. Malt lingers in the aftertaste, with hints of chocolate, smoke, and hay. For reasons unknown to me if I try to drink more than three of these in a night I wake up with a headache, which reduces the drinkability score somewhat. Certainly not without its charm, but not a whole not here to distinguish it from other microbrews.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Thrasher,4.01,"An intriguing beer that is not quite an ale, and not quite a lager, or both. There is a smoky element, perhaps from the yeast, that this beer has in common with Anchor Steam (a similarly in-between beer). Also like Anchor Steam, I've found this beer can be wonderful if fresh and well-kept, and blah if not. This is a good, fresh sample. I like the Day of the Dead theme but the Grateful Dead association is a little much. A disconcerting, and intriguing murky copper, with good head that doesn't stick around, minimal lacing. The aroma isn't much, it's pretty invisible. The beer itself is a nice blend of caramel malts, honey, bread, light smoke, gently tangy citric hops. It's almost like a Munich-style helles cross-pollenated with a hoppy Pacific Northwest pale ale. Fine stuff.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Soybomb,3.88,"appearance: Pours a beautiful dark amber color, a bit cloudly. It starts with a 1/2 inch head that quickly turns to just lace.  smell: Sweet and malty with maybe a little bit of a bread smell.  taste and mouthfeel: Medium bodied, somewhat sweet at first but with a more bitter finish, also a touch of citrus on the finish. A nice carbonation really helps it go down easy.  notes: Nice beer to drink, good combination of flavors but I wish it had a bit more complexity. Not much seemed to jump out flavor wise. My first Maibock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rdrummer,4.08,"The Dead Guy pours a reddish-brown, nearly clear liquid with a tannish head that is large, lacing is minimal. I thought that there was surprising little aroma but that may have been my expectations running ahead of experience. The primary smell is a sweet malt aroma with some expected hints of fruit.  The taste is another story. It is a very flavorful bock with mostly roasted maltiness and some real underlying hops kick. It is bubbly in the mouth, but still manages to be creamy. I really enjoyed this first foray with the Dead Guy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,gentlebubbles,4,"A tall creamy off-white head piles up from an aggressive pour that fills the glass with a clear coppery amber edged by pale gold highlights. Sweet smalty scent. Piney bitterness leaps into the first sip, followed by light toffee and spicy, fruity malt. I keep thinking of caramel apples. Thick, creamy bubbles fill the mouth. Resiny finish with lingering sweetness.  Once the head settles, it looks more a glass of tea. The body thins as it warms up and the alcohol becomes more evident.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,LuckySevens82,4,"12 oz bottle. Pours a pale amber with some golden hues to it. Small but dense white head. Lacing is okay but not great. Smell is light malts (some toastiness to the aroma, not sure what malts were used but it's definitely a masterful blend) and ripe, exotic fruits. taste is more complex than one would think from the appearance and aroma. This is a very fruity beer (pears, apples, citrus). There is some toastiness to the beer, but it is kind of overpowered by the fruitiness. A fine beer, I would definitely have this again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dippy,4.13,"Pours a beautiful tan head crown that rests majestically on top of the reddish brown brew.  Pleasantly sweet scent is immediately apparent and accompanied by a slight hop aroma.  The first sip is caramel/fruity like and overly candied apple. Hoppy are subtle at first, but provide a brilliant balance.  A tremendous amount of lace coats the glass down to the last drop.  A very good beer, I will have to request more of it be ordered as I had the last six pack in the store.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BadBadger,4.7,A fine ale. Pours an intermediate amber color. A nice white head forms but does not last. There is however nice lacing throughout the duration.

Enjoy!,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,watermelonman,3.68,"This poured to a somewhat dark ruby and orange color. The head and lacing were about average.  There's almost a hint of green apple in the smell and taste. I like it. I'm not sure how it got in there but it seems to fit nicely.

Hoppy and malty aroma. Plums, sweet malts, sap and passion fruit.  So this is brewed like a maibock but fermented like an ale. Odd. It confuses many people. The taste is fruity,spicy, tender, piney and posseses a lot of malt flavor especially caramel.  This is a so-so Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,blitheringidiot,3.99,"I exhumed this not-so-stiff beer from its 12 oz. browner with a mug totin' skeleton on a keg label. Cool name. This ruddy red morgue occupant brought to the surface a full inch of sticky cratered moon surface head that pops down and leaves a lattice lace. Reddish, clear, teeny haze, letting some decent amount of microscopic sized bubbles continually escape to the surface.  Sniffs reveal yummy vanilla ice cream & rootbeer aroma. Hmmmcream soda in the nose. This has big-time malt caramel in the upfront nose.  Punch to the kisser is easy. Dead Guy gets knocked back as easy as wheeling a corpse on a gurney. This keg sittin skeleton has middle of the road creamy sweetness. Ever go to an ice cream Sundae bar, and taste caramel topping on a good Breyers Vanilla Ice Cream scoop? Thats it! This reminds me of an almost nitro-can pour.  There is not a whole heck of a lot of carbonation here. If left on top of the tongue, this doesnt do much of anything. Aftertaste starts to be a mild cloying Turbanado sugar sticky sweetness that eases off to a dry wheat toast finish.  Last swigs: Easy drinker with melted vanilla ice cream & caramel soup-in-a-bowl flavors. Great body feel, sticky maple syrup finish. BA brownie points for a cool label. My mates and I drank this at a Middle Eastern seven course restaurant all night long. At the end of the night we offered our bus a couple bottles, quite to his huge enjoyment.  Beer is good. Dead or alive. Happy beering.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RootedFool,4.85,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle purchased the North Coast Co-op in Eureka, California. Body is dim amber with an off-white, dense head. No lacing.  Smells like sugary, buttered bisquits, with a gritty middle of hop bitterness and finishes fruity (fresh grape juice).  Taste opens with a chewy, dense bitterness along the center of my palate. The middle is tangy and spicy at once (lemon zest with a dash of red pepper flakes) and closes on a dry, bitter note played long and sharp on the back of my tongue and roof of my mouth, backgrounded by a gentle fruit-juicy sweetness.  Coats my palate and coasts off with ease -- perfect. Carbonation is very evident yet not over-powering.  Well-rounded, awesomely balanced brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,palma,4.08,On Tap in NYC at the Blind Tiger Ale House. Coppery/reddish body with a thin white head. Aroma is fruity and tea like. I specifically smelled grapes.

This beer is close to IPA territory.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,FormatKid,4.2,"I picked up a bomber of this at Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga. I was very excited to find a store that carried more than a few selections of Rogue in my area.  This brew pours beautifully into a standard pint glass. Its appearance is a clear, rusty reddish orange. A lively off white head compiles robustly a nice three fingers high. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles make their way quickly to join the head. Lacing is somewhat sparse but persistant.  As soon as the bottle is opened the sweet maltiness in the aroma reaches out and tickles my nose. Caramel and toffee wrap themselves lovingly around the juicy hop aroma in the nose. This beer smells absolutely delicious.  The smooth, sweet malts roll their way across my tongue as bitterness prickles at the edges and back of my palette. Straight up malts and hops here baby, and I love it. Mouthfeel is moderate, and lets this one go down EASY. Insanely drinkable.  I will definitely be making a return trip for more of these, in fact I wish I wouldve picked up a sixer instead of a bomber. Theres always next time. In fact, now I know why they keep cases of this one by the door!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Although in comparison to the other ""bock"" styles it's not my favorite. I love and am somewhat used to drinking dopplebock's, and this is considerably sweeter, and slightly less alcoholic. Poured a dark amber, with smallish head, although I never seem to get much of a head at this joint. Couldn't really pin this brew down. Maybe because it was so balanced. Had a sweet agreeable malty tone but perhaps a bit too sweet, slight spiciness that I enjoyed, and finished crisply. Nothing really stood out, but thats not always a negative.  Great session brew, but perhaps not with taco salad. Live and learn.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,DPMomutant,4.48,"Pours a nice dark amber with a two-finger head. This head is lasting a good while here.  The smell is a moderate strength. Sweet and clean malt and hop smell.  A nice toasty malt taste. The hops really come out in the finish. Not as complex a some better beers, but as tasty as we expect.  This beer is active on the tongue, but not harsh. Goes down smooth. Don't really feel the alcohol here. It's a little higher in ABV, but not so much you can't take a few. I'm drinking a bomber now and could probably handle another if I had one.  This is the beer that really got me searching more than ever for better beers. Had it at a deep dish pizza place that had the first beer list I ever saw. I admit I was drawn by the name but came back for the taste. While it almost made my girlfriend sick (she dislikes beer in general), I enjoyed it.

Excellent head, glass-lacing and a nose of plum tones. Again, I too am not versed in the maibock style, but I enjoyed what appeared to be a full-bodied, sweet -hopped beer. I enjoyed this beer immensely; very, very quaffable. I can't wait to have some more. Would also like to compare to it in the bottle. well I''ve found that this is also a great beer prelude to bluegrass as well as classical. I truly, truly enjoy this beer. I also had the good fortune to have pints from a fresh keg - this is one quaffable drinkable beer. additional comments- really smooth, nutty mouthfeel. I love the sweet hoppiness and the dark distinct, medium to full body. this is almost a combination stout-ipa or porter ipa, but way better than any black & tan that I've ever had. truly wonderful beer and a favorite.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RocketWidget,3.88,"This is my first experience with the Maibock style. Pours a solid orange, quite an unusual and interesting color for a beer, with average head.

A fun and refreshing brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Give me this stuff and just watch it disappear.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,maek228,3.73,"i found it interesting that the beer is labeled an ale, but is really a maibock? i had, and still have no idea, what a maibock is. But by the time i completed my first sip, i concluded that whatever a maibock is, i like it. now, last night was a hectic beer-b-q and i didn't really have the time to give my full attention to one of these dead man's brews, so tonight, ive decided to take some time aside properly review this beer, so here goes:  appearance: a gold coppery brown, similar to that of fine homebrewed iced tea. A thin, but rather elegant lacey head rests on top of this beer, and receded significantly after a few minutes.  smell: not the strongest of scents, yet appealing. the smell is of hops and assorted fruits.  taste: an initial burst of fruit flavor, that is quickly followed by an explosion of hops. The hops come across as sweet at first, but then blossom into an excellent bitter hop kick in the ass. the bitter hope aftertaste is not overwhelming, but is extremely strong. this has quite a bearing on the mouthfeel, depending on your feelings towards hoppiness  mouthfeel: blissful at first, but the bitter hoppiness that lingers on in your mouth will really detract people who arent into a powerful hop prescense.  drinkability: not really a session beer. its strenth is well masked, making it easy to drink, although the bitter hop aftertaste would make it a chore (a pleasant chore i guess) to put down alot of these.  i give dead guy the nod. i look foward to trying more maibocks in the future. this beer kinda reminded me of hopdevil ale, sans spiciness. the negatives for this beer would be that it could have been more bold, and the the aftertaste can be rough to the point were it interferes with the taste of your next sip, gulp, whatever. i have to say though, this beers positives far outweigh the negatives. good beer for a cool fall or spring night.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,coasterfreak75,4.1,"The pour was light copper/amber with a half inch head that quickly dissapated to nothing. It left a fine ring around the top of the beer that stayed with the beer throughout the drink but didn't stick to the glass.  The smell was floral, with a light hint of apples. All that mixed with malt and hop spice.  The drink started with a very carbonated sweet kick followed with a medium hop bite in the middle. It finished with a mix of malt sweetness and hop bite, but it didn't linger.  This is a very drinkable and refreshing beer that didn't let me down, given how ledgendary it is. I'm glad I finally got to try it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,soper2000,4,"Finally picked up this legendary beer. My expectations were kind of high and I guess i was a little dissapointed with it. Pours a nice red/brown color with a small white head that was tinged with beige. Smell is faint but it is sweet and malty. Taste is more of the same. The malt is more easily perceived than the hops and the finish is slightly sweet like Xingu. This beer feels a little bit thin to me, but i suppose the drinkability is decent. This is just a good beer, not great, not bad, but good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,crackerpooch,3.92,"Presentation- 12 oz. brown bottle with no freshness date.  Appearance- Pours a one finger light beige head. The head reduces quickly to a nice film that does not lace much. It has a murky orange haze to it. Im not certain, but I dont believe this style of beer should be this cloudy.  Aroma- Not much nose on this one. A slight crisp sweetness is all I get.  Taste- A sweet caramel taste with a slight beautiful bitter balance. A great clean taste.  Mouthfeel- Medium mouthfeel that sticks to the back of the tongue and palate.  Overall a pretty drinkable beer that has a unique taste and good mouthfeel.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Very satisfying beer that is refreshing, and flavorfull at the same time. Pine and citrus are also in the flavor. I thought it was a pale ale, but it apparently a pale bock (according to this site). Very delicious, all-around.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,merlin48,3.98,"Pours a hazed, red apricot color with an attractive, tan head that reaches two fingers in height. Nice, beige colored lacing is left all over the glass. Aroma is subdued, and is mostly caramel malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and has a substantial presence of hops and carbonation. Taste is well balanced. a bouquet of resiny, hops coats the mouth with pine and citrus rind, but a caramel malt evens things out quite well. Some Granny Smith apple notes appear near the finish, and produce a clean and dry/fruity aftertaste. I'll admit to avoiding this Rogue ale, out of superstition. After having one, at last, it seems an ideal spring ale. This would be a near perfect ESB, if it were brewed with English hops.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ism,3.63,"Cloudy amber with a rich white head, fairly good retention for the alcohol content. Moderate malty aroma. Light-bodied, slight carbonation, could be a bit more assertive for the style. Pale malt flavors, hops just enough to balance, subtle fruity tones. Sweet going down, and is that hops I feel? Barely noticable. Clean finish with an interesting profile on the way down, quite likeable and distinctive enough to make this stand out. Good example of the style.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,yeagerbm,3.88,"Served from a bottle poured into a pint glass at a slightly cool temperature. Nice amber color with a fluffy white head. The smell was a little musty with some caramel. Tastes pretty good with sweet caramel buttery notes and good hop bitterness. May be better with some more hops to balance out the sweetness a little (but I guess thats why they made the Brutal Bitter ;-). Overall it's a good beer across the board, and drinkable enough to have a few. May also be a little better if chilled a little more.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Sammy,3.78,"A light and smooth tasting brew. Do not feel higher alcohol at all. Surprisingly amber, and seemed to me like a vienna amber style, malty with modest carbonation. Bitter aftertaste. If in a session, serve between heavy other types.   My mates liked it better than I did but it could be from less sophisticated taste buds.  Had it a year later on tap, found it sour but decent. Had it again on tap in May 2005 at Eulogy's and it was above average.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,sulldaddy,4.07,I pour a chilled sample into my pint glass. The beer pours a rich amber color that is slighlty hazy. The pour develops with an off white soft fluffy head that begins to fade rather quickly after the pour. Aroma is fruity and sweet with some caramel scents and some floral hop notes. First sip reveals a medium bodied brew and slightly prickly carbonation. Flavor is fairly malty with caramel and toffee flavors combined with some slightly bitter hop finish. This brew is very drinkable and I am sure I will enjoy it with the pizza I am about to eat.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ViveLaChouffe,3.88,Pours a rich copper witha thin ivory head. Smells of pale malt and lightly fruity yeast. Light hoppy aromas.  Taste is quite fruity and malty. Yeasty and sweet pale malt. Lots of floral hops up front with an understated but strident hoppy bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with a nice bitter aftertaste. Pretty good but I thought I would like this more.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ark57,3.88,"It is a dark gold color. The aroma is fruity and hoppy. The body is malty, but not too thick with some fruitiness (orange and mango). It has a crisp hoppy finish. The added fruitiness from the top fermenting yeast is nice, but it comes across as a very drinkable Maibock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Zorro,4.2,"Pours cloudy reddish brown ale.  Smell is sweet and malty with some tea hop and a fruity background.  Taste is mild sweetness from the malt and a dark toasted bread flavor. Hops are well balanced against the malt. Mild fruit flavors come out after a while. Alcohol is mildly warming to the chest and completely hidden in the flavor.  Mouthfeel is very good.  Very drinkable brew, tasty and full of flavor without any defects.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mntlover,3.8,"Pours a hazy amber with a nice white haed that falls to a thin ring of foam.Sweet dark fruity aroma, intense malt flavor with strange fruity presence ends in a nice hop flavor and bite.

132,355,GuinnessSmurf,4.08,"Filled up my pint glass with this brown/orange colored beer, topped with a generous beige head. Alcohol and barely hit the nose and wake up the senses a bit. You think, ""hmm, this will probably be a good beer.""  After thinking this, you taste it and realize you are correct. What is interesting about this beer is that its flavor opens up rather slowly.

132,355,jwilli7122,4.15,"Clear amber/prune color with a medium to large white head, and some lacing. Somewhat distinctive aroma- dark fruit and vegetable?...and pinch of alchohol.  The taste is interesting - not my favorite- but well...I do like it. A lot. Very different. They do an excellent job here making something different and good. lets see- dark fruit/veg mystery taste, heavy malt flavors in the middle- including but not limited to butter, then more of the mystery taste - then a small, quick, crisp hop cut...and finally a very nice wet doughy aftertaste.  Features an outstanding mouthfeel- full, buttery, and smooth, but not heavy in the least. Quite drinkable and something I am glad to have experienced.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Southernbrew,4.2,"Honey color, slight head, a really beautiful beer. Definite sweet aroma, crisp hops also, slight citrus too. Sits very smooth in mouth, not too heavy, perfect amount of carbonation. Slight sweet taste, like honey, followed by a crisp, slightly bitter hop element.

132,355,SilentSabre,4.25,"Purchased this in the 1 pint, 6 fluid ounce / 650mL size bottle. Poured a medium reddish brown. Now let me say this. I tried the Chocolate stout from Rogue about 6 months ago and it was just really not for me. I really didn't care for it, to be tactful and polite. But many people have been saying that I absolutely had to try the Dead Guy and boy were they right! Wow! The taste is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. It's a little bitter at first. And I mean a LITTLE bitter. It goes down smooth, and then a few seconds after you swallow, it leaves a faint taste of caramel. Almost no carbonation to speak of make this one real easy to drink, but if you pay attention to it and are looking for it, when you first take a sip, it's a tiny, tiny bit thick which makes it something you wouldn't want to kill a whole lot of in a sitting. Nevertheless, I'll be buying this stuff again!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Redrover,3.88,"I had this on tap at McCormicks & Schmidts while on a trip to Portland, OR.  Beer pours a nice golden brown color with a light tan head and decent lacing.  The smell is sweet with some floral hop nose as well.  The taste is on the sweeter wide with definite fruit tones. A little lightly roasted malt taste and maybe a hint of caramel. As the beer warms the fruit (apple I think) taste grows more prominent.  Nice smooth mouthfeel that is slightly creamy. Drinkability is very good. While not an every day choice for me, this is a beer I always enjoy. Was one of the favorites with my old co-workers and I can see why.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beertaster13,4.01,"Rogue Dead Guy Ale is a supreme beer. The apperance is exceptional, gold honey in color, the usual amber color. The head was a gorgeous cream color that lasted the whole way through. The smell is of malts with caramel and a fruity scent. The taste is good, very good. The hops are very present in this beer, not to much though, sweet caramel malt aftertaste. Fells full and colorful in the mouth. A very drinkable beer. When you want a good ale don't look any farther that Dead Guy Ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Ellbert,3.23,Appearance: A decent off-white head fairly quick vanishes to a thin lace. The beer itself is clear and welcoming.  Smell: I smell wheat in this beer. Wether or not it is in there I smell something like wheat. There is also a nice malt sweetness present in the aroma.  Taste: There is a decent hop presence in this beer. There is a lot of malt presence that overpowers the hops though. As in the smell I taste something like wheat.  Mouthfeel: There is decent carbonation in this beer. It makes it very drinkable. A very mild beer that I would have again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,HiroProtagonist,3.83,"Served from a 12 oz bottle, Rogue Dead Guy Ale was rich copper in color and topped by a small off-white head that left excellent lacing. The nose presented a rich but delicate roasty malt aroma and a light resiny hop profile. The taste resembled a subdued barleywine, with a firm rich roasty malt body, light and zippy citrus notes, and a big bitter finish with lingering roastyness. All of this was well balanced and held up by an appropriately full body. Dead Guy is a full flavored session beer, good for the roasty-bitter fan.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,travolta,4.1,"22oz Bottle, No AlcVol info though  Apperance; Gold, honey, appricot. Khaki head that didnt last long enough.  Nose: Soft sweet sugars like, carmel and vanilla, not too many fruits or herbs, it seems to smell sweet and creamy with that rotten (in a good way) nose at the very end.  Taste: Crisp in the mouth, but doesent attack. Perfectly hoppy (for me). The hops lets you know it's there right at the begining and then exits the stage very gracefully. A little sweet right after the hops. I would guard this one till the death, just are our character does on the bottle.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,silenius,3.4,"Pours a hazy amber with a thin, but persistent head.  I can smell some hops and malt sweetness. Nothing much else.  Now the taste is the best thing about this beer. It has a nice balance to it with a pleasant hoppy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin in my opinion. I get a slight sense of wateriness on the mid-palate when drinking it.  This is a very drinkable brew, but just not as bold as I would like. It might make a decent session beer for someone with less bold tastebuds, but after two pints, I would probably want to switch up.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Dogbrick,4.1,"On draught at the MoJoe Lounge at Easton. Pours a clear reddish-amber color with a thin skeleton-bone head. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma is mildly citrusy hops along with a touch of spice. Medium body, with a somewhat flavorable blend of floral hops, citrus, honey and spice. The flavor is kind of like Arrogant Bastard's ""Mini Me"". The finish is mildly bitter making this for an all-around good-drinking beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,stewart124,4.32,This is a cloudy amber color with orange hues and a little head that lingers. There is a smell of lightly roasted malts and a nice touch of hops. The taste is of a sweet fruitiness and a good balance of hops. There is an almost candy like taste to this beer but it is very drinkable. This is a quality product that I will never get tired of. Aftertaste is a nice blend of hops and malts that leaves a great feeling on your tastebuds.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Troyone,4.3,"I do not know why this beer is classified as a Maibock, my opinion it should be a type of Amber Ale. However it does taste more like a Maibock rather than an Amber. I do not know how this would be judged in a beer competition. The color is an iced tea copper with a half inch head and I like the way the head dissipated with in a minute. The smell is a light toasted caramel malt with a resin hoppy aroma. Kind of a light sweet bitter taste definitely caramel with a resin lime hoppy flavor and hints of a light soy sauce (no salt), maple, and cola. Has a light body, dry texture, soft to flat carbonation, and a dry finish. Anyway this beer is great and smooth to drink almost like a session beer (with 6.5 abv?). Well balanced, I prefer hoppier beers (with this amount of abv) but this was perfect for its style and one does not notice the abv content. Rogue puts out good stuff and this is no exception, possibly one of their best.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BuckeyeNation,4,"Orange-amber-copper all in one, which is a pretty cool hue. The head is ivory in color with a hint of orange, is firm and looks like it will last for a while. As it descends, the cap comes to resemble a rich vanilla milkshake sitting atop the beer. It doesn't last very long, though it ends up leaving a decent amount of lace in spotty sheets.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I have no earthly idea what a maibock is supposed to smell or taste like. Therefore, I can't really say if this is a good example of the style or not. The flavor profile is pretty well-balanced, with malt having the slight edge.  The beer is somewhat caramel-like, with an earthiness and a restrained spiciness. The spiciness becomes bolder and more interesting as the beer warms. Again, I'm not sure what sort of mouthfeel a beer of this style should have, but this one seems fine. It's medium-full and has a pleasing smoothness.  Dead Guy Ale may be the most ubiquitous craft brew in this city. Every store that carries beer seems to carry it. It's obvious that it's a quality offering, but it doesn't stand out as exceptional. Even though I'll probably drink it again, it won't be anytime soon.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,dansteino,4,A favorite standard of mine down here in New Orleans. I can get it on tap at the Bulldog or in a bottle at Cooter's or the Delachaise.  Pours a wonderful deep orange with a nice head.  Citric/woodsy hops is present on the nose.  I find the sweet malt and bitter hops to be wonderfully balanced.  A great session beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jtfest,4.15,"Slightly hazy amber color with a thin off-white head and a sweet malt aroma with a nice balance of hops. A full but not heavy mouthfeel fits extremely well with the malt upfront and hop flavor/bitterness finish. The taste lingers a long time, with more of the sweetness than the bitterness in the linger. Easy drinking and quite good, I really enjoyed this brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,claytri,3.97,"The beer poured a nice clear reddish gold with a reasonable head. It had a sharp citrusy aroma. The taste was bitter and hoppy with a good finish of orange and pepper. It had a smooth clean feel. A nice example of a Maibock and one to be considered when desiring this type.  While I prefer a less hoppy beer, I found this to be a pleasant change. The taste was there, but was enjoyable without a strong aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,stirgy,4.29,"Ahh, Dead Guy. At a tasting seminar once I had asked the woman at the Rogue table for one of these. She promptly told me that this beer was so yesterday. Well, I must disagree. This was one of my first introductions to the world of better beer, and still holds its own today. This version poured a bit hazy in appearance. The color is an orangey-amber and the head was thin. The aroma is full with sweet fruity malts and has a touch of spiciness. The taste is of light malts and leans towards the sweet fruit side rather than the bitter. There are some citrus and lemony hops in there, but are well disguised by the sweet malt. Alcohol is hidden well under a blanket of flavors. Very lively and highly drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Dmann,4.35,"This is for sure a malt lovers beer, but it has a very good ammount of bitterness to interest the hop heads as well. It poured a copper color with a decent head that left nice spider webs on the glass. The smell was fruity and malty and I couldn't wait to taste. The flavor was great, with a thick mouthfeel that fit the malty flavor perfectly. But just when you think its all malt the hops came in and added a great element to the flavor. Even my Coors drinking dad loved this one, so this is a very drinkable beer and would be a good one to start novices on.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Imbiber,4.28,"Deep orange-copper with a lively tan head which dissipated but leaving foam laced on the glass. Aroma is quite floral, almost grassy. Flavour is big on malt and hops which balance themselves well in spite of dominating the palate in no uncertain terms; a 'tangy', bold beer with much character. Aftertaste is dry and malty, hops are in evidence more to the finish leaving a pronounced bitterness that subsides slowly.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ngandhi,3.93,"Dead Guy is a malty, bocky bomb. A maibock with a twist, the ale yeast offers a rounded fruitiness that does well to support the huge malt character. It's everything you'd expect out of amber malt -- medium bodied, honeyed and floral fruit. Even a shocking touch of smoke on the finish. The bittering is appropriately light with subtle Saaz notes poking through. Quite filling, yet quaffable and even spritzy. The finish is very dry, but well-rounded, reexhibiting all the characteristics of this brew in every synecdochical taste. Not the maltiest or most authentic bock in the world, but certainly one of the most layered and complex.  Relax, relax. ng",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,necoadam,3.95,"Poured out a dark orange/copper color. Reminded me of Victory's Moonglow, looks somewhat similar. Poured out a decent head but went away very quickly. Nice lacing around the glass. Smell of plums come to mind, also some sort of sweetness aroma but can't put my finger on what it is exactly (exotic fruits? can't be sure). Taste is a little surprising. At first there seems to be no body to it, but later on there's a nice medium body to it, very nice, I like that. Good malt backbone to this beer as well. There's a bitter aftertaste as well, but in a good way. I like how this beer is put together. I can see why Rogue is proclaimed. I would recommend this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,CRJMellor,3.72,"Pours a dark amber, big thick head on the pour with impressive head that stays around awhile. Fairly thick head with moderate retention and good lacing. Aroma of fresh citrus hop smell, little bit of spice and slightly sour smell, maybe apple. Flavor is dominated by fairly deep malt to start but then a sweeter fruity middle jumps in followed by a back of fresh hop bitterness Beer definitely needs to warm to fully appreciate and as it warms some yeasty aroma and taste jumps up. Nice mouthfeel, about right for style. Definitely a nice session beer. Overall, nothing outstanding but can definitely do worse.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Charthepirate,4.44,"Well, I screwed up the pour on this one, so what should have been a magnificent head was kind of under represented here. Color was gorgeous though, like looking through a honey colored ruby.  The smell comes off very sweet and malty. It reminded me of fresh rye bread. Touches of sweentess, it just smells wonderful, but the smell isn't too potent.  When the dead guy hits the mouth he seems to liven up pretyt quick (I'm sorry). Initial strong sweetness, with some caramel, bread, and some fruity esters. Raisins and some kind of berry maybe? It's a subtle part of the brew, but a wonderful characteristic. Quickly though, a big, citrusy, bitter hops spikes through the beer. The malt and hops fight back and forth throughout the mouth till eventually your left with only a satisfied, balanced flavor. One of the most blanaced american beers I've ever tasted.  This beers excellent mouthfeel comes from a nice combination of the hops and a healthy carbonation. For some reason, the bite of the hops and carbonation runs in sync, making the beer literally feel huge in your mouth. More yums from this beer.  A brilliant brew by Rouge, one i'd be glad to quaff any day of the week.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Hagbard,3.88,"This pours a deep amber color, almost reddish-orange. Very small head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is very subtle. It is earthy with a touch of honey barely perceptible to my learning nose. The taste is smooth and malty with a definite hint of honey. It is nicely carbonated and feels substantial in your mouth. It would make a fine session beer if it was a little lower in ABV, though at 6.5% you can definitely have a few.  I enjoyed this one, but was slightly dissapointed. I had it about 6 months ago, before discovering BA and its world of wonderful beers, and I absolutely loved it. I'm talking top 5 beer material.

Poured with a nice head that dissipated slowly into a light head and eventually disappeared with traces of lacing along the side of the glass. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit bubbly. I like the earthy aftertaste. It's not overbearing like some ESB's, but still keeps you aware of the bitterness. I can't quite put my finger on it, but this is one you keep drinking in order to try and figure it out, but with the smooth mouthfeel giving way to the bitter, it's almost as if the beer is teasing you to pinpoint it's definitive taste.

A great beer that I will look for time and time again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Creamy looking head that leave a nice lacing. Taste is another well mixed malt and hop combination. Malt is rather notable in richness as much as specific flavors. As warms hops become bolder, presenting with both a grassy and piney qualities and offering dryness that's not excessive. They even offer a bit of a citrus quality too. As the hops begin to dominate the nice and soft caramel malt aspects lose their presence, which is too bad as the mix of both was quite nice. Very nice soft quality to feel. Smooth even with the noticable carbonation.

The smell was nice too, very hoppy, almost reminded me of Victory Hop Devil. The taste was also very hoppy, a bit toasty and sweet. The sweetness seemed to be well balanced with the hops though, if not dominated by the hoppiness. Mouthfeel was good, medium bodied, very drinkable.

132,355,Rob6852,4.47,My first beer of the New Year. Came in a 22oz. bomber w/ the glow in the dark silk screen on the bottle. This beer poured a hazy amber/honey color with a 1 inch head that disapated to a thin sheen on top that left good lacing all the way down. Smell was malty and the alcohol was barely detectable. The taste of this brew was malty with a few hints of fruit (couldn't distinguish what fruit) and the hops balanced it out at the end but were not overpowering in their presence. This is a nice ale that is easy drinking. Easy on the palete and a good tasting beer at that. Glad i waited for tonight to have this one.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Pours an orange hue, with a small head  Mostly malt in the nose  A significant front of hop bite gives way to a very broad and caramel maltiness. Not cloying.

Faint hoppy smell, not very strong  Solid flavor, strong ale flavor followed by a hoppy, bitter taste that is oddly pleasant.

Nicely bitter and full bodied, this is creamy, smooth drinking beer. Easy drinkability.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Will be looking into trying more of the Rogue product.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,granger10,3.68,This was an interesting beer with a cool looking bottle. Poured a deep red color with a bubbly head. Plum on the nose. The initial taste I got from this was plums. Some roasted caramel was noticed later. More sweet fruits came and went. Not too much in the line of hops but I think that's because of the style. The smoothness of this beer made it go down easily. All in all a solid beer but lower on the Rogue totem pole of beers.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kbub6f,3.93,"Gorgeous, clear, dark red/amber color. Small, off-white, dense, thick foamy head leaves a few spots of lacing. Sweet deep malt, creamy aroma. Hops jump in right away with a touch of fruit. Deep, almost chocolatey malt takes over quickly: creamy, thick. Very bitter finish... creamy malt survives through the end. This is a special beer. The huge hop bitterness is a little unexpected among the dark, creamy malt. It's an unusual bimodal taste, but a real winner.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Foxman,3.92,"It pours a golden amber, with a slight haze about it. A quick creamy, light tan head recedes gradually to tiny dots of foam. There's no real lacing to speak of.  The aroma carries a scent of somewhat sweetish malt, with moderate hops presence. There is a hint of maple syrup or brown sugar on the very bottom. As the beer warms, the malt comes well to the fore.  Out of the gates, the malt and hops are neck and neck. The dry tingle and floral notes of the hops goes hand in hand with the sweet malt, overall a crisp initial flavor. At the outside there flits a berry sweetness, again with a brown sugar tinge. At the end there's a yeasty biscuit finish. As with the smell, malt plays a much more assertive role as the beer warms.  It swirls nicely on the tongue, coating with a medium body, not lingering long, leaving a spicy hops tingle as a reminder of its presence.  It's a genuinely nice beer, with enough malt/hop interplay to be interesting. There's not too much of anything, and just enough of everything. Sure, I could handle 2 or 3 more, time and next-morning productivity depending. The beer grew on me, just better than pedestrian when colder, but multiplying in character as it warmed. Also, my boys love the bottle. They want more so we can use them for Halloween decorations in the garage next year.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,shirfan,3.95,"Rapidly vanishing head compared to other Rogue offerings, this is a clear red-orange.  Aroma is of oktoberfest-style malts and a good dose of citric hops, leaning towards sweet oranges.  Taste is finely balanced... again light caramel malt, and a sweet aspect something like honey. Mouthfeel is not overly chunky nor thick; finishes with a light and clean hops presence; oranges and floral notes mingle with a very nice sweetness. A mild level of carbonation, combined with the inoffensive-yet-intriguing flavors here make for a highly drinkable offering.  Rogue can keep this truckin' up to Buffalo for as long as they want.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,edchicma,4,"An all-around fine brew. Nice caramel color with a head that dissipated quickly, but left a nice lacy residue. Fruity smell that was not overwhelming. Nice rounded feel with a light sweetness followed by a slightly tart finish. Slightly oily with a medium to full body. Some alcohol undertones. Recommended, refreshing brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mschofield,3.85,"Red-amber with 1 finger off white head, laces well and remains as a cap. Citrus hop aroma with grainy notes. Fruity with sweet and toasted malt flavors, woody hops come in after the initial malt taste. Pretty well balanced. A little orange flavor - maybe clementine instead of orange. Light feel to it, I could easily drink more than one. I don't know if the Ale name is very appropriate, seemed more like a Lager.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,hungryghost,3.45,"Orange to brown color. Small head diminishes until just a ring around the glass. Ring follows the beer down the glass, no lacing. Mild malt aroma, some floral hops, a sweetness I cannot name. Honey maybe. The flavor is very sweet yet not sticky in the mouth. Roasted malts and brown sugar are present then I get a little hop finish. This beer is well balanced and has a good body The high ABV is a bonus, unfortunately Dead guy is too sweet for me.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,counselor,3.57,"First time trying a Rogue beer and was really looking forward to it, maybe had hopes too high but this beer seemed fairly average. There didn't seem to be anyhting particularly compelling about this beer, nothing up front on the pallate, nothing lingering on the back end to make me look forward to the next bottle (not that I didn't have another though). The bottle was very cold to start and the flavors opened up as the beer warmed up. I felt it was a good brew though and representative of its style, just not a knockout.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Gusler,4.27,"Draught @ Papago  A beer I drink once or twice a year now even though I keep a few bottles in the stash and more's the pity as it is a fine beer. Pours a translucent copper color with a monsterous head that is semi-creamy and off white in color, a thick and sticky sheet of lace clings mightly to the glass. Sweet malt, plum like, crisp, fresh and pleasing to the senses, start is ambrosial, thickly malt, the top is moderate in feel. Finish is dynamically hopped, moderate acidity, aftertaste somewhat bitter and long lasting.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,flaminghomer,4.23,this is a good beer!  it is a hazy copper orange with a decent light tan head. i really like the appearance of this beer.  taste feels crisp. mildly sweet. slight alcohol aftertaste that i enjoy. the lingering taste makes you anticapate the next drink. maybe that is why it is so drinkable.  a good a beer. i would recommend it to anyone.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,brewdlyhooked13,4.15,"Appearance - pleasant amber color, not much head though. A thin murky sediment is suspended throughout. What lies beyond in these depths of the Dead Guy???  Aroma - heavy and sweet caramel malts drape the olfactory senses. The initial vapors on this beer are impressive - when poured into a glass and sniffed right away while the head is full but breaking down, there is a distinct whiskey smell. As the head recedes to a spotty covering, this smell backs off and resembles a more standard maibock malty aroma.  Taste - a big beer. Very hefty malt and noticeable sweetness that gets more developed as the beer warms. It doesn't approach a syrupy taste, a brash dose of hops will see to that. A big citric hit, lots of bitterness like a grapefruit rind. Alcohol level is 6.5%abv but seems more pronounced like an 8 or 9. Nice finish, touch of smokiness and lingering hops combine for a taste that never quite leaves, just kind of hangs in the corners of the mouth, reaching out like shadows in a deserted graveyard. (my attempt at Halloween spooky-themed writing...hmmm)  Mouthfeel - between the load of malts and the oily hops, this is a heavy feeling beer. Stubborn residue really prolongs a pleasurable taste.  Drinkability - Not a beer you can chug, nor would you want to. It's so tasty it's gone before you know it, though. Once the 'macro' guys at the Halloween party got a little pissed up enough to try this, they really liked it! Beer advocacy continues...",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,marcobrau,3.8,"Golden to amber. Pours with a lot of foam that slowly fades. Smooth mouthfeel. Body is a little light for a Maibock. The strength of this brew is evident. Starts malty and with notes of vanilla on the palate and in the aroma. Malty with a spike of hoppiness towrards the finish and fairly bitter finish for a bock, but this is sort of expected from a Northwestern brewery. Doesn't seem as balanced as it did the other day. Seems more bitter and the flavors seem just a little brighter. This Dead Guy still not as lively as on previous occasions, but I guess you can't ask too much from a dead guy, eh?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,RoyalT,4,"Appearance - Dark, cloudy orange in the body with a good head that lingered but didn't lace.  Smell - Nice, mild, malt character with a stiff balancing hop (strange for the style but not for Rouge). There's a light melon/orange fruitiness to this aroma as well, making it quite nice.  Taste - Ist das eine HopBock? The lightly-toasted malt flavors complimented by sweet orange and grapefruit and honey are offset by stiff, bitter hops. I doubt if you'll find anything like this in Germany, but it is good nevertheless.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with light carbonation and very refreshing thanks to the uncharacteristic hops.  Drinkability - You have to love Rogue or hate 'em. They make one of the hoppiest Stouts on the planet, and they do the same with this Maibock. I happen to enjoy the interpretation of the style, but many I'm sure won't.  Update - I can't remember the first time I had this ale, but I first rated it on the site in November 2003. I thought it would be fun to sit down with pad and pen (or keyboard and mouse as the case may be) and write an update.  It hasn't changed a bit. Beautiful body with a nice head that doesn't lace, nice malts with an off-style PacNW hoppy bite, solid medium-bodied with very pleasant carbonation, and the bottle empties before you can say, ""Gibst mir einmal, bitte.""  Update - I happened upon this again in 2010 and found it to be much more malty. The malt base is unsweetened and very raw. I think really it needed this to balance the big hop bit. It's almost like unsweetened caramel if that's not an oxymoron. It's a solid 4 all the way around and a definite ""must try"" for any beer enthusiast.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,leeenglewood,4.52,Excellent beer that borders the boundaries between being a bock bier and an ESB. Cant really classify between the two. Pours a white fluffy head that dissipates to form a sticky lace with a dark amber color. Slight citrus hop smell with goes along with a caramely malt. Tastes superb with a slight toasty caramely malt to accent the hoppiness. A slight fruity ester flavor comes threw but is not dominating. Highly drinkable but alcohol will kick in after two or so.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,CBFanWish,4.15,"Thick rich head... orange/amber in color. The smell pulled me in. A soft citrus smell prepared my sences for what what was about to come.

132,355,irishmoss,4.08,"I just cracked the top off of this one, so I could review as I enjoy this. Nice label, especially since today is Halloween. This poured a nice clear dark copper/garnet color. The head is pretty thin with no lace around the large goblet that I'm drinking it from. The aroma is pretty malty, maybe caramel, with litter to no hop presence. The taste has a large malt presence up front with a little brown sugar hint. Great finishing hops presence makes this one finish clean and balances it out at the end. Good mouthfeel with medium carbonation. This is very drinkable and at 6.5% will make a damn good session beer. Great job by Rogue and I can't wait to go back and get the Shakespeare & Brutal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Skywave,3.24,"This must be the least enjoyable Rouge ""ale"" I have had so far...It looks ok, deep golden orange hue with thin, soapy head. The aroma is very pleasant with a nice balance of sweet toasted malt and domestic (that's USA) hops. The flavor is just plain weird to me. I don't know what it is but there is something... I dunno... ""green"" tasting about the combination of hoppiness and sweet malt in the middle. Finishes with a sweetish, smoky flavor that continues with the oddness. What is most odd about this ""ale"" is that it is not an ale at all. It is a Maibock, which is a German lager beer. It is as much an ale as Bill Cosby is a young white dude.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,winomark,3.83,"Appearance: Slightly hazy deep copper color, wht a thin lacy, off-white head.  Aroma: Nice malty sweetness, with hints of hop spiciness.

Delightful smell of malt, hops and fruit. Sweet malt up front, quickly followed by just-right bitter hops. This is one of those beers you can really savour. And then wish you had another one to hand.  I'm gonna run off and tell all my friends about this one. Great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Shiloh,4.2,"A beer with an attitude! Poured nicely with a smoky golden edge and orange core. Limited crown with a medium lace and cling.

Can understand why this could be taken to the grave...may bring a few myself! Very nice.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The Rogue guys continue to impress.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,woemad,3.68,"Having previously enjoyed Rogue's Shakesphere Stout, I was slightly disappointed to find Dead Guy Ale just a ""good' beer. Still, its better than much of what's out there.  Dead Guy emerged from the bottle into my glass as a orange/copper colored brew. There was a small beige head that quickly dissipated, yet left a thin ring of foam around the rim. The smell was of floral hops, caramel, mildly toasted malts and a whiff of honey. The the hop flavor is most noticable in the taste, with the caramel and toasted malts in the background. I would have liked the malts to be slightly more assertive, but I still enjoyed the taste. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy, with a slightly acidic, yet by no means overwhelming, feel.  While this is not a great beer, and slightly deflates the Rogue mystique, I still like it. It actually reminds me a little of a Fullers ESB, though I find it a little less silky.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AbePhroman,4.13,"A beige head settles fast upon pouring over a very dark amber body. It smells of hops, which although not overwhelming, are very present. It is not as bitter as some other ales but it remains very potent. It is not a thick ale and goes down smooth. I like drinking this on occasion and am happy it is not a seasonal brew. I wish I was able to find a larger variety of Rogue brews around my area, but alas it is mostly Dead Guy Ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The main aroma is one of a malty biscuit, it is accompanied by a sweet hoppiness. This beer is very malty tasting, and lightly sweet. I must say this is a great session beer, lots of flavor yet it seems to be relatively light. A beer for when you aren't up to being assaulted by hop varieties and dense maltiness. This beer finishes with a balancing bitterness that counterpoints the wonderful mixture of sweet maltiness and hop flavors that are at the front part of this beer. This beer is what I wish Fat Tire was, I know it is a bit hypocritical, but I can still wish.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

Starts off quite sweet and malty (almost too much so). By the end, the trademark Rogue hops are prevalent. In between, however, a nice unique ale. Good balance, good taste, good drinkability.

The aroma is not very strong, but there were some slight hops and a little citrus present. The flavor was sweet and malty - good combination. The flavor is fairly smooth, but not perfect - it could be a little more smooth. The mouthfeel was average in my book.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The start was somewhat malty sweet, but then the hops kick in with a dry, citrusy, grapefruit finish. As with the finish, the aftertaste was on the bitter side. The mouthfeel was a little creamy with a light to medium body and slight carbonation. Well balanced, but over all, the flavors are a bit subdued. This is a good brew that is quite drinkable, yet it didnt seem to stand out too much to me.

Appearance: Orange amber with a nice white head that subsides to a trace ring on the glass. Some carbonation kept going, but never kept a head. No lacing. Flavor: Starts with a sweet fruitiness that quickly gets jumped on by a significant hop, but the balance is good. Mouthfeel: Smoooth. Medium body, but that doesn&#8217;t do justice. Coats the mouth with a lingering bitter sweet. Liquid silk. Overall Impression: Rouge has done it again. An outstanding beer. Drinkability is unsurpassed.

While my SO and i were compairing drinks (she had the Mocha Porter), I noticed my beer was significantly warmer than hers. I think the temp improved mine. Curious.  I couldnt get much smell out of mine, for some reason. There was malts and a good hop pronunciation.  A good mouthfeel. I think the slightly warmed servint temp helped here.

The smell combines some roast maltyness and a very strong perceivable 'Panela"" (Jaggery) smell hiding under a citrusy feel that penetrates deep into the nose  The taste, mild sweetness given by a strong-above-all malt, and some alcohol continues right behind this first taste.

132,355,HonestWeightBeer,4.8,"22oz. bottle (though, I've recently seen it in six packs)  This being the first beer I have reviewed for BA, I decided to try to review a beer I know quite well.  Dead Guy Ale pours a beautiful deep reddish amber with a slightly creamy, off white head. The head gives way to the sweet but not too sweet aroma. I might detect some of the sweeter fruits that some poeple mention, apricot, raisin, etc., but for all I know, its ambrosia.   Which brings us to taste: wonderfully complex, both sweet and slightly bitter with overtones of the alcohol content. A seriously smooth mouthfeel, making this a perfect summer beer that is, happily, available year round. Well balanced, Dead Guy Ale makes one wonder if the Rogue brewers can brew anything thats not exceptional. A beer thats both warming and quite drinkable.

To hell whether or not it 'adheres to the style', this is one of the best that Rogue has to offer. This proves they can do subtle as well as they do bold. Pours a clear dark copper with a a frothy off-white head. Aromas are all light and subdued--sweet, hoppy, grassy, inviting if nothing else. Everything else is all she wrote. There is a perfect balance of the malt and hop profile and neither is over done, although each dominate at different times. Tastes sweet--raisins-- followed by the smoothest hops and a slightly dry finish. I could (and have) drink this all night and I usually opt for variety. I can't wait to have it on tap again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,UncleJimbo,4.08,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This bock poured a cloudy/hazy amber-brown with hints of red, with white foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was spicy hops and sweet malt. The taste was sweet malt (caramel) and spicy hops near the finish. Nicely balanced flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but dry and hoppy (almost chalky) at the finish and in the aftertaste. The body was medium and the carbonation low.

It poured a nice, slightly murky reddish orange with minimal head yet ample sticky lace coating the glass throughout. Attractive fruitiness and sweet malt on the nose with a little cooking caramel as well. The taste of this baby is really quite nice. Lots of caramel malt flavors and a slick buttery texture, that finds balance in nice grainy malty/hoppy interaction. This beer is superbly balanced and very flavorfull! I'm picking up more of that caramel corn thing as I finish this beer. This is some tasty stuff, and as I drink more of it, it becomes even more ""drinkable!

Aroma is very malty, with a healthy dose of toasted malt. Hops are surprisingly agressive, considering it's a bock style, with a german herbal/floral quality. Some american hop tanginess. A bit woody, with some phenolic esteriness. Hints of plum, pear, and a faint suggestion of strawberry. Flavor is bold and powerful, yet smooth and rich. The beer starts out malty sweet, fading into a slight toasty graininess, then travels into a moderate northwest hopping, finishing the beer. Malts remain throughout the sip, finishing with the hops wonderfully. Hints of apple, pear, and plum. Heavy body, with mild smooth carbonation. A touch of cookie-like yeastiness.

The smell was quite interesting, a floral hoppy aroma with sweetness underlying it all. Nice honey traces. The taste was a bit strange, but I got used to it pretty quickly. The initial sweetness is tempered by a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Different than most beers, even most maibocks that I can remember. The full mouthfeel was very appropriate, and matched the complexity of the beer very well. Good taste, and good drinking overall.

Slightly bitter finish. Decent balance but subdued in general.  Feel: dry, somewhat thin feel. Rather over-carbonated.  Drinkability: maybe I got a less-than-fresh pint.

An okay head that disipates quickly. Not much lacing. The scent is a very sweet malt. Some hops pop through and there is a candy fruit scent as well.  The flavor is a medium sweet. A bit of light caramel in the malt. There is also some hop bitterness and a fruit flavor that pushes its way in to the mix here. A mango or something with a tropical flair. The flavors are a nice balance, complex but not confusing.  It drinks extremely easy. Maybe too easy. It is fresh and finishes nice.

132,355,GreenCard,3.74,"Appearance: light brown copperish color, slight haze, 1/2 inch of creamy tan head  Aroma: light sprinkling of hops, caramelly malt and an angel food-cake-like sweet scent in the background (sort of almondy), raisins  Flavor: an upfront hop flavor followed by a mellow maltiness and grainy flavors, some toasty biscuit essence, a pretty aggressive piney hop bitterness in the finish and lingering on afterwards, as my mouth got used to the bitterness, the malt flavor became more defined  Mouthfeel: light body, a pleasant softness, perfect carbonation, some warmth  Overall Impression: I guess this is Rogue's one-size-fits-all beer and I have to admit I do like it. Most the beers I've tried from Rogue were just too heavy on the hops. This one is more balanced, so it's no wonder it has more wide-ranging appeal.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,hotstuff,3.8,"I found this particular beer to have both a bitter taste and an after taste as well. After just a few sips of this beer, I could definitely feel the alcohol effects. All in all not too bad of a beer, but not one of the better beers that I have tried.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beergeek279,4.3,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle. The appearance was amber, with a good head retention. The smell was very hoppy, and so was the taste. The mouthfeel was quite smooth. Drinkability.....well, this is certainly one I could drink several of!  The rogue in me certainly enjoyed this beer quite a bit! Whether it's a lager or an ale, it's a good beer and one I will have again!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,TheDM,3.15,Nice hoppy aroma. This brew formed a nice medium head without too much carbonation. It lasted only a short while though and left an excellent lacing on the side of the glass. It is a cloudy light orange brown color. It has a slight aftertaste but is still on the mild side. A nice drinkable but unimpressive beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SigEp,4.54,"Beautiful color in glass, deep red with a little orange. Not much head to speak of and very little head retention (the only dissappointment I had). Hoppy and slightly sweet bouquet. The flavor was hoppy and delicious with a definately sweet malty round undercurrent. Drinkable and delectable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,IronDjinn,4.05,"To my dismay, this is the only label from the Rogue line to be found up in these parts. The dismay comes from the fact that this is damn impressive ale and I want to try more of what Rogue has to offer (I don't think it's a coincidence they have so many labels on the Top 50 at any given time).  Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle, it bears a resemblence of liquid twilight, a beautiful hazy copper tone with a one-finger off-white head that recedes to a frothy ring. Aroma is complex, caramel malt, a bit of fruit, some citrus, definitely some honey, floral hops, a touch earthy. Flavour is bold, sweet and bitter and oily all at once, difficult to pick anything out on its own, it all blends in. If this is a standard of what's to come, then I salute the rogue in each of us as well.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kevinl6,3.88,"Another winner from Rogue!!! Poured this one and saw only a little lacy head on one side the glass, virtually none at all. A thick amber colored beer, looked almost like a jar of mountain honey in my frosty mug. Lots of smell coming from this one...fruit? A very satisfying mixture of taste that is at first sweet, then that little bit of Rogue bitterness that makes a nice finish. A unique brew that is always in my fridge!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jcalabre,3.35,"On draught. Appearance: hazy, honey colored w/ a medium white head. It has a malty taste up front w/ a bit of a funky tart finish. Maybe grapefruit or lemon? unique, to be sure. It's definitely different and a must-try for any serious beer lover's list",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,alexgash,4.25,"I really like this beer. Dark copper color paired with a deliciously creamy head. Aroma is a nice balance between sweet malts and flowery hops. Taste is fronted by sweetness, followed and balanced nicely by hops. Tastes like a maibock. Extremely drinkable--watch out six-pack!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Indybeer,3.95,"I had this on tap at the BW3 downtown Indy, Poured a clear red/orange, with a moderate head, that didn't last long. Some signs of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt and hops. Taste is malty and sweet, almost too sweet. It has a good mouthfeel with just the right amount of hop bitterness in the finish. Not something I could drink alot of at one time, because of the sweetness. But still an over all good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kelticblood,3.93,Almost exceptional appearance.Maintained a huge head for awhile before it faded leaving spotty lace and a thin white head.Floral fruit aroma with hints of caramel malt and a touch of bitterness.The color is an orange to amber.Medium bodied with a strong bitter finish and taste.The bitterness makes no attempt to hide itself.Fruity taste thats dry but not too refreshing.It is strong at 6.5% and that might limit drinkability.Smooth mouthfeel thats clean and crisp.Complex and well-crafted with a great reputation.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rastaman,2.48,"A bit odd, similiar in taste to Golden Syrup, a bit too sticky. Quite sticky and sweet, with a touch of salt at the end. Kinda like a bock, just with a bit more hops that i'd usually expect in one. Very odd, flavours didn't mold well at all. Probably my least favourite from a night of tasting many great US beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,SheepNutz,4.03,"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours an orangish-red color with 2 fingers of head and a little bit of lacing. The smell was just a little weak. It smelled of citrus and hops a little bit. The taste is a good mix of fruit and hops and is very well balanced. It is a very soothing ale, if that makes any sense. The mouthfeel was just a tad bit oily. The drinkability is great, and this is a pretty unique ale.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Loki,4.25,"Sampled from a 22oz. bottle  Poured a hazy honey-amber color with a thin canopy of a head. Left decent lacing through out the sampling with peaks and valleys on the glass.  Aromas of malt, honey, and hops that seem to dance together back and forth. Almost intrancing, but not bold or in your face.  My palate definitely appreciated this unique beer. The taste began of sweet malt, honey, and hops. There was a surprise of nutmeg or cinamon, I think nutmeg, but definitely something that reminded me of x-mas and an x-mas beer, but only on the finish and definitely not the dominate flavor. Beautifully balanced and even. Crisp and clean, but a little light on the mouth feel and very mild carbonation.  Drinkability is nearly perfect and this is a wonderful session, pairing, or convert beer. A great all around offering, but would you expect anything less from Rogue?",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Gump,3.38,"As a sample I purchased a large bottle of this beer instead of a six pack. It looks like a big ol forty on my desk. If scoring was based on packing and artwork, this one would score very well; the bottle is beautiful :)  Definately an ale. Dark amber color with auburn head which quickly fades away. Good carbonation, strong taste with slight bitterness, and lingering aftertaste.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kmo1030,3.93,"a nice looking copper colored beer with good tan head. the smell is mostly caramel malty with a little hoppiness thrown in. the taste is very well balanced beer, nice blend of herbal hops with sweet caramel malts. real nice balance and an appropriately medium mouthfeel. rogue always satisfies.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,daledeee,4.22,I could have sworn this was a pale ale. But the category shows that it is not. Pours a nice coppery amber color. Nice head with good retention. Beautiful floral hops and malt balance. The finish is just as good. Alcohol is there too but not up front. Mouthfeel starts out velvety and finishes a little dry. Makes you want more.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Stingray5,4,"Poured a slightly cloudy amber with a minimal off white head that disappated quickly. Fruity, malt aroma. Hints of prunes and grapes, along with caramel. I'm not sure what to make of this brew. Mouthful is decent, chewy. Taste is of multiple fruits and malt, with minimal hop presence. There is a nice warmth at the finish. Hops do become more prevalent here as well.  I'm finding that this beer is winning me over as I drink it. At first seems a bit too fruity for my tastes, but as I drink it the complexity starts to present itself, along with the hops. It's like I'm not sure if I like it, but I know I want more!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Garin,4,"It poured a nice golden coppery colour, slightly hazy, with a firm, lasting head that left beautiful lace.  The aroma was malty sweet, citrusy, grassy, with lots of hops.  The flavour is a stiff and dry malt, with bracing, peppery bitter hops rounding it out. I don't find a lot of fancy flavours here, just good honest malt'n'hops.  In the mouth it feels nice and warm, with a medium body.  Yes, it's extremely drinkable. This six-pack won't last long. It seems a bit hoppy for a maibock, but I'm not really complaining. It's like an ESB with a really firm malt backbone. I've had a few of these now, and I just LOVE this beer. No matter what you call it, it's darn tasty.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Alewife,3.88,"Had this on tap at the Sunset Cantina. Color was a clear, light copper hue, and the head was white, fine and thin, but with minimal lacing. Nose displayed some citrusy hop notes, and even seemed a bit grassy to me. Body was better than medium, with a slight prickliness on the tongue. Flavor was a great balance between malt and hops. Malt was slightly toasty, with some sweetness (but not enough for me!) and the hops were pleasing with a citrus lean to them. Good stuff!!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,AudioGilz,4.08,Brilliant amber color with a large two inch fluff atop. This beer is so well balanced and a treat to throw back. It's creamy sweet and then spicy sharp hops....caramel malty and then sharp hops. An awesome session beer that is stronger than one would imagine. This is most definitely worth a try and is one of my fall-back brews,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,GeoffRizzo,3.86,"Pours a beauty of a dark amber with a thin, retaining head. Some fruity and hops are noted on the aroma, barely detectable. A spicy hoppy taste is noted on top, with some underlying malts and some citrus detected. Medium bodied, and hopped up as expected from Rogue, all in all an above average beer that can have some bite.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jaz,4.32,"Great rusty bronze color with creamy white head. Head didn't stay long, and lace was minimal. The aroma smelled like a kettle of carmel when you melt it to make carmel apples, and a sweet malt and alcohol smell came through nicely. The taste was rich and smooth, pronounced carmel flavor, with a bitter-sweet middle, and a pleasant sweet and tart finish that lingered a bit. An excellent Maibock style beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bmills1608,4.5,"Color is a glowing orange/amber, looks awesome. Head is solid and thick, sticky looking and smallish. Lacing was great. On the nose was fruit, lots of ripe fruit. A nice combo of melons, citrus and yeast.  First taste and I new I was in for a treat. Full and rich, fruity flavor abound (peach?) caramel malts, a touch of roasted malt and toasted bread. A stiff malt backbone is backed up with a sold punch of hop flavor, aroma and bitterness. I felt the usage of hops in Dead Guy was brilliant. Mouthfeel was another winning characteristic. Super creamy but somehow light and quick at the same time. Finished smooth, a bit toffee sweet with that tingling bitterness that I love (Fuller's ESB has it). A touch of alcohol and tobacco at the very end. To me, drinking this I'm thinking ESB all the way, but who cares how it's classified, it rocks.  My first Rogue. ""All Killer, no Filler""",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nomad,3.56,"Poured a transparent dark amber color with a strange orange-brown hue to it. Also had a fair-looking frothy and almost khaki-colored head, some bits of tiny streams of carbonation, a good lace that for the most part stuck around, and some bits of stain.  Smelled of soft apple and faint floral hops, and a little pine and salt as well. It tasted of a good balance of malt and hops; it nicely played back and forth between a rosy malt flavor and a grapefruity bitterness. Had some good biscuit flavors, too. In combination, a simple body of flavors but pleasing from its good balance.  Lightly drying but with an obviously bitter finish, it didn't diminish the very wet feeling the watery mouthfeel left for most of my tongue. A good session beer, light (relative to most Rogue offerings) yet interesting. I thought better in bottle, as for me the draught had lost its malt flavors and thus its balance.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,far333,3.95,"Dark amber, a little hazy, with an orangey head that is thick and lingering. Aroma of sweet malts and ripe fruit, some toffee and candy. Flavor is coarse brown sugar, ripe pear and hint of butterscotch. Also a bit of a rough-edged flavor, a little grainy. Mouthfeel is round and full, with even carbonation. You can just feel tinges of the alcohol.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,marc77,3.78,"Tawny bronze hue. Covered by a cream white, fluffy, well retained head. Rutted lace remains. Soft, spicy hop nose with an herbal tinge along with lightly toasted malt and mellow light caramel. Pleasant, understated aroma. Assertive hop bite initially in flavor is partially contrasted by mildly buttery malt and mellow toffee. Malt character is predominantly of cleanly grainy, toasty Munich and stately, dextrinous light lovibond caramel malt. Not complex, but sufficient in malt backbone for adequate balance. Subdued herbal, mint tinged hop flavor. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth mouthfeel well calculated in dextrins. Finishes with lingering hop bitterness and fleeting toasty malt, and thus quite dry. Another well hopped, unique Rogue creation. Simple, tasty and certainly quaffable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jackndan,4.48,"Rogue Dead Guy Ale: In a twelve ounce brown bottle. This is one very tasty beer. Deep amber color, nice off-white head with sufficient staying power to coat the sides of the glass. The taste is exceptional, neatly balanced malts off set the assertive hops. Clearly, this is a terrific beer for any hop head, but one that I think any beer drinker would enjoy, as this beer showcases the floral/citrus aspects of the hops with out leaving too much of a bitter bite. Very nice!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Boto,4.5,"Pours a reddish brown. Not much head to the beer. Both the aroma and taste are very complex. There are a great deal of malts and hops in this beer, but neither are overwhelming, but there is a good hop kick in the end. Extremely well balanced. This one would get the Mayan's to come back from the dead! (Big misconception that this was named for Jerry Garcia. It was named for a Mayan celebration. It does sell beers, since they don't readily discount it.)",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Edwin,4.68,"I first tried this beer three years ago on a whim at Market Cross Pub in Carlisle, PA. I have to admit that I am a total slave to packaging...if it looks cool, i'll buy it. The skeleton dude called to me and I had to have it. I have to say that what I found inside my glass was FAR better than I expected. I thought i'd get an average beer with a great label, and instead I got a great beer with a great label. Creamy and smooth with just the right amount of sweetness to it. When it is first poured into the glass, it has a beautiful red/caramel hue to it that looks almost too good to drink. It has a great aroma. This is a beer that has all the flavor of a heavier beer, but it won't weigh you down like a steak dinner, making it an all-night endeavor. The only knock on this beer is that, if kept too cold it can get a little bitterness to it. Most self-respecting establishments will keep certain coolers at different temperatures to ensure the best taste, but every once in a while you'll get one that is a tad too cold and it seems like you're drinking the Dead Guy's ugly sister. Those situations are few and far between, but I gotta give the whole story. If you see this beer, do yourself a favor and get a pint. I suggest it to all newbies and I get great response. Enjoy!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Naerhu,5,"Appearance: Beautiful opaque red body with white smallish head. 4 smell: Sweet malty creamy, soft whole grain bread like aroma. 4.5 taste: Medium hops that gently grow. Initially lightly sweet and some light caramel. Sweet without being cloying in anyway. Dry due to the hopiness, but balanced so well. Reading the other reviews, I have to wonder why I got it backwards. Most taste bitter then sweet, but I definitely taste malty sweetness with the bitterness slowly coming out. mouthfeel: micro bubbles on a round medium body. drinkability: The sweetness and bitterness is balanced is beautifully. Amazing.  This is the sweetest juice of god. It has a beautiful deep golden amber color. Shimmering with deliciousness. Aroma is of bold malts wrapped in a loving bouquet of hops. I do not catch any of the fruit other see, but this has the rich warm qualities of fresh baked bread. A firm hop back bone, that make me glad I was born. The creamy smooth mouthfeel is liquid silk.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,allboutbierge,4.42,Quite a treat here. Copper red color with a pale orange hue. Initially fluffy then disappates into an offwhite head that resembles a flat cloud in shape. Sweet and mellow candly-like scent. Flavor initially is slightly bitter but soon transforms on the tongue to a mellow sweetness. Just a plethora of different sweetnesses confused and excite the tongue and palate. Aftertaste almost has an element of carmel too it. Any taste of alcohol is non-existant in this brew. Carbonation is light which allows for all the flavor to come out. Extremely drinkable. A nice appetizer beer because once its gone you want another and another and another...,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jlervine,3.93,"Poured a nice amber color with a white head, bubbles efervesced throughout the duration of the beer in my glass. Lace was left down the sides of the glass. The smell is hoppy and you get a good whiff of alcohol - almost vodka-like with my bottle. Interesting. The taste is very good and satisfies the hop-head in me - little malt presence on the palate, followed by bitter hops and a crisp finish. It feels to me that the tail end is almost missing something. Maybe I'm delusional. This is a very rich ale for my tastes, so I can see drinking one or two of these tasty brews, but certainly not more than that.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BierReise,3.95,"I had this for the first time recently and enjoyed it very much. It poured a nice head that laced the glass as I drank it. The thing about it that impressed me the most was that despite its intense hops, the malt flavor came right through. This is American brewing at it's best",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,scottum,3.95,"A bock, but they call it an ale? I don't understand. A very good bock. One of my favorite bocks. Too sweet for me to drink very much of, but very good none the less. Balance is good. Nice malt profile. I welcome this beer into my fridge. Great label.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,brakspear,4.17,"Hmmm...a mai-bock brewed with Rogue's mysterious ""pac-man"" yeast....and throwing you a curve by calling it an ale.... all resulting in a delicious beer no-matter its classification!  The beer pours a dark amber with a very limited white head...the weakest part of this beer is its appearance.  The aroma is a beautiful deep malty aroma...not sweet...toasted instead...with a faint hops spice...very nice.  The taste shines...a rich and deep malty blend of Munich and caramel malts really breaks to the fore, but there is a nice hop balance to the beer. A joy to drink.  The beer has a nice body to it and the alcohol content is hidden, making it dangerous if you think it is a session beer! I just wish it was more readily available in my neck of the woods.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,OldFrothingSlosh,3.58,"On-tap at Capital Ale House.  Appearance: Hazy dark copper in color. Minimal head but it left very nice, thick, and distinct rings on the glass.  Smell: Very hoppy indeed. Fruity and flowery. Very nice.  Taste: Less than what I expected. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but something just didn't sit well with me. There was a more balanced flavor of hops and malts than expected. I had anticipated a hop right hook to the taste buds. No such luck.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy. Surprising, given the high IBU of this beer.  Drinkability: I really wasn't constantly ready for another drink with this one. Not a beer that I would actively seek out again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jtw5877,4.77,"This stuff is great, pours an orangeish hue with a white head. It tastes like a nutty amber, but it works! no massive hops, yet a subtle transformation of a classic which yields an awesome offspring. Any fan of ales would enjoy this tastey interpretation.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,stegmakk,4,"Appearance: Slightly hazy rich copper with off white head...

Overall I will get some more...not my favorite, but still good",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,avylover,3.7,"Nice looking deep golden brew with a level off-white head that died in a hurry.. Smell is a mix of english and american bitter hops, but I once this tasted a few more flavors kicked in, most notably a very sweet maltiness. Nothing overpowering, just a decent balance of hops & sweet bready malts. Alcohol is totally hidden. Not the best maibock I've head, but pretty good.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,tavernjef,3.88,"Amber in color, light tan small bubbly half inch thick head. Very appealing to look at. Smells of light floral hops and yeast. Start and middle are a little bit empty, but ohh the finish is so nice. Good fair amount of hops with a nice dry hop bite. Sip or drink it slow, its quite smooth with a nice hop bite. Drink it fast and watch out, the hop bite bites. Has a light body feel and leaves a dry hop tang in mouth and tongue. Drinkable indeed, this is a nice clean hophead ale for sure.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nixhecks,3.22,"Poured and amber color topped with a large foamy white head, excellent retention. Not much aroma, a little malty sweetness. Carbonation is low, giving this brew a smooth mouthfeel. Malts dominate the flavor, a little raison notes. Not too bad overall, but not the best Rogue has to offer. Character is a just a little lacking, something that some of Rogue's other brews have that makes them stand out. But hey, when the day of the dead comes, what better than a dead guy.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Scooter77,4.33,"Presented in a 22oz bomber bottle with the classic Dead Guy sitting on a barrel. This is one of my favorite maibocks. Pours a deep amber/bronze color topped off by a medium sized bubbly head. Nose is floral and malty with slight undertones of nuts and fruit. Bitter hops are immediately recognized upon first taste, followed by a sweet fruitiness and malts. Very balanced and easy to drink. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste, very nice. Another great beer from Rogue.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

132,355,Denali,4.07,"Package: 12 ounce bottle. No freshness date.  Appearance: Hazy amber with thick off-white head.  Smell: Fruity aroma (citrus and apple) with malt sweetness and slight alcohol presence.  Taste: Mix of malt sweetness and strong hops bitterness tastes up front. Roasted caramel flavor comes in next, along with a hint of fruitiness. Strong hops bitterness and malt sweetness then make their presence known again and follows into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Slight carbonation upfront that fades away quickly. Finish is a bit thin. Almost like the flavors go away for a moment but then come back (from the dead) again for the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Wow is this easy to drink. I didnt realize it was 6.5% ABV until after I finished it. You would never know it.  Comments: Very flavorful brew, extremely easy to drink. The dead finish provides an interesting effect. Thank you Keith (stegmakk) for the bottle.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Running4beer,3.98,"Poured a hazy wheat/honey type color with a small amount of head that thins out and leaves a lacy coat on top. The aroma is not strong at all but you can smell the hops and light malt. There was a slight bitter, malt aftertaste that is not overpowering and completes the initial hop taste. There is a smooth mouth feel to this beer, that makes you want to grab another and another and another. The drinkability is great, this is one of those beers you want on a hot summer night when you're relaxing at home with some friends having a good conversation about beer and life.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Reidrover,3.96,"Came in the 22 oz ""Bomber"" with the by now famous ""Dead Guy"" atop a cask label! Wow I AM impressed by the look of this beer! The brew is a hazy amber colour, topped by a small , but creamt, off white head, very good ! The aroma of this beer is not overwhelming, but is well balanced with hops and malts to the fore...smells like fresh rain. Ahhh wonderful taste to this ale! Malty yet not to cloyingly sweet, creamy yet it has bite.Nice taste of honey..and a nice understated hop bitterness at the end. A very nice feeling in the mouth, its smooth and not too dry of a finish. This is overall an excellent beer and very drinkable in my opinion.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Mitchster,4.38,"Brewed with Northwest Harrington, Klages, Maier Munich and Carastan malts. Hopped with Perle and Saaz.  16.5 degrees Plato, 30 IBU's, Apparent Attenuation 77.7, 8 Lovibond.  Deep amber in color with a slight chill haze, forming a puffy light beige head with sticky lacing and good retention. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is mildly spicy with floral hops, a distinct caramel note but pleasantly underwhelming, a fruity ferment with those wonderful PacMan esters, and hints of sweet nuts and toasted grains. Mouthfeel is very soft with a medium body..very, very smooth. Taste begins with some mild, fresh floral hops, giving into a delicious delicate bready malt sweetness with hints of sweet nutbreads and caramel. There is a pronounced clover-honey sweetness in the middle. A luxurious, mildly dry finish is that of lingering sweet Munich malts, a slight graininess, perhaps some toasted malt husks, and notes of vanilla and caramel.  Dangerously drinkable...a 12 oz. bottle gives me a pleasant buzz on an empty stomach. Delicious..somewhat of a dessert beer. This reminds me of a sweet real cask ale. At it's prime, this is one of my favorite beers and in my top 20. On tap at the Rogue Ale House, this is just sublime.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,marburg,4.33,"This is the beer that first turned me on to microbrews many moons ago; it prompted me to keep looking for Rogue beers. And it's still a treat to this day.  Pours a pretty, sparkling amber color with a not-quite creamy head of about a quarter- to half-inch in thickness. Aroma is of the malt presence in the beer. ""Hmm...another overly malt-sweet beer?"" Nope. A pleasant sweetness is instantly laid to rest by an equally pleasant hop bitterness that lingers just a bit -- aftertaste of some sort of bitter nut or food...can't quite put my finger on it.  You can drink a truck full of this and still like it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Winter,4.82,"Another great offering from Rogue. This tasty mai bock was originally created to celebrate the Mayan Day of the Dead or Dia de Muerto on November 2, All Souls Day. Pours a hazy medium orange with a white foamy head. Nice citrusy, buttery aroma with a hoppy floral boquette. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, which is thick and creamy. Smooth front with a crisp textured finish. Sweet and citrusy upfront with a biscuity malt goodness. Flavorful finish from the Saaz hops is just perfect. I picked up a single bottle to sample and now I wish I had grabbed a six-pack.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Brewzzle,4.45,"This is a curious little beer. It says it is supposed to be a Bock but it reminds me more of a bitter (a good one too).  It is very murky, with a tight but fleeting head. Aroma is sweet, honey like. To taste it is a delight, starts off rich, full bodied and bursting with sweetness. A mix of grain, honey other goodies I can't quite describe. It finishes off with a big hop bitterness and a lingering sweetness. In character I would say it is alot like sweet oat bread.  For some reason this reminds me of an outstanding homebrewed beer, probably the hazy appearance and the rich natural flavours, true craftbrewed excellence.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WVbeergeek,4.55,"Pours a slightly hazy amber copper hue with an off white fluffy billowing head. This beer doesn't have the thickest lace, but what it lacks there it makes up with in taste and aroma. Aroma is a sharp sweetness with notes of caramel and slight apple tartness. The flavor is very complex yet simply amazing in every way, this beer blends the perfect amount of subtle bittering hops with a huge blend of specialty malts. Gotta love the maibock brewed with ale yeast instead of the standard lager yeast for the style. This shows that taking a chance can bring you an awesome product like the one I have the pleasure of sipping on right now. There are hints is a soft chewy mouthfeel that carries a plethora of caramel malt, a ver slight tartness, and the trace of hop character tie this beer together. No loose ends here, one amazing totally solid brew that is so easy to drink. If I see this stuff on tap it is going to be quite a fun night, very good drinkable brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kindestcut,4.65,"The Dead Guy Ale poured gold and red, like a sunrise on a cloudy morning. The look is slightly cloudy, although it could have been the carbonation obscuring my vision.  I sensed a sweet, malty aroma, though not at all overpowering. I have tried beer with far greater aromas but with a far lesser flavor.  Sweet and bitter, smooth and chewy, it was a dichotomy of the senses, although the hoppiness is pretty subtle. There are no gratuitous flavors.  I really like this beer a lot. I had not had any Rogue products prior to this and I hope all of this live up to Dead Guy's near perfection (IMHO). I think this beer would be great to drink at any time, whether at the bar or with food.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,GreatPondBrewer,4.08,Very reliable brew. The pour was silky smooth with an attractive red orange color with just a tad bit of carbonation and a somewhat unsubstantial white head that formed clingy lace. The smell was a balance of malt and hops but was a little lacking in complexity. The taste was not however. It was full with some citrus flavors and notes of apple and bitter malts. Yet another quality effort from Rogue.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,rabidawg,4.07,"12 oz. bottle  Appearance: Golden amber color with a frothy, white head that settles slowly, leaving a nice lace.  Smell: Mostly malt, with a hint of hops creeping through.  Taste: Very soft and smooth, with a big malty intro cut into by generous hops. Finishes fairly dry, and leaves me wanting more.  Pretty dang good . . . I can see it becoming my fallback brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,texascarl,4.8,"Appearance = Dark amber/gold, slight haze. Creamy tan head, dissipated without a trace. Low to medium carbonation.  Nose = malty sweet, fruity. Jumped out at me as I poured, a sign of excellent things to come  Taste = This is how Bock beer ought to taste. A one-two punch. Malt and plenty of it, just start to taste the sweet of it when POW the hops hit you. Plenty, but not too much hops, luscious short to medium finish. A wonderful brew. More please.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WaltTrombone,4.32,"I found this beer at one of the local beer distributors. It came in a 22 oz. dark brown bottle with the label painted on. Very classy!  It poured a reddish mahogany hat was a little cloudy. The head was an off-white that disappeared quickly.  The aroma was that of a slightly sweet malt. The predominate flavor is also a sweet malt, with notes of licorice and tangy citrus. As the brew warmed, notes of mild coffee and butterscotch, with a short dry finish.  Pleasant creamy mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable! I'd have this one again...and again...and again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Admiraldinty,4,"A pretty good brew. Pours a dark orange with a white lace. Nose is sweet, with obvious malt and hops. Initial taste is malt sweetness, but this is quickly followed by hop bitterness that ends with a nutty sweetness. Fairly smooth and medium-bodied. A great ale, and rather warming. I'd have to say I'll come back to this one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mzwolinski,4.46,"A genuinely delightful beer. Pours sunset orange in color, with a mountainous off-white head that leaves a great lace down the glass (what Rogue beer doesn't?). The aroma is malty sweet with a bit of a honey-like scent and an aroma of tropical fruit. In the mouth the beer is creamy and sweet with a medium full body. The flavor is mostly malty, with some muted fruity flavors, a bread-crust like finish, and some piney and floral hop flavors which lend it a slightly dry finish./ Not terifically complex, but I could drink this all day.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beernbbq,4.5,"When I saw the name of this brew on the menu as on draft at my local CT upscale diner, I figured it was a local IPA or Pale Ale of some sort. How pleasantly surprised I was when it arrived at the table and was confused as to what type of beer it was as it did not adhere to either style. When I got home, I punched it in at the beeradvocate website and found it was from Rogue, which I haven't been able to get in any of my local stores here in New England. As far as the beer goes, it did not have the metallic taste I associate with other Rogue products I've had. The malt was a honey-ish variety with the hops being ever present but not overtly spicy. The body was nicely constructed, with the head playing a strong part in the experience all the way to the bottom of the glass. If it wasn't for the fact that I was driving, I could easily have sat there and sampled more. A good beer and one I will try and find to have in the house.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,johnrobe,3.52,"This brew pours a murky, deep brownish-orange with a light beige head that reduces to a cap. The smell is very unique....floral, heavy waves of candied fruit, chocolate, and dark caramel. The taste is of burnt caramel, chocolate malted milk balls, plum preserves and raisins. Though lighter-bodied and less potent, it reminded me a bit of the sample of Samichlaus I tried not too long ago. Unfortunately some odd metallic taste comes on in the finish contributing to an unpleasant bitterness. I think my bottle might be an old one, and I know it was not stored at cellar temperatures prior to my purchase. Even so, I could tell this was a good beer past its prime. I will have to try to locate a fresher sample.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Bruiser81,4.05,This brew poured a deep orange-amber color with a small white head that didn't last long. The aroma was slightly citrus with a flowery hint. The taste was malty up front with a sweet middle and a good balance of hops to finish it off. A slight alcohol flavor is present in the aftertaste which gives the beer a slight warming effect. This beer had good carbonation with a crisp refreshing mouthfeel. I will have to puchase this beer again.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,49degrees,4.38,"Rogues flagship beer  the Dead Guy Ale  rounded out my beer excursion to the Issaquah, Washington location of Rogue Ales. This very well rounded, malty sweet brew is rightfully deserving all of the accolades and awards that its picked up in recent years.  Originally sold as Maierbock, it received a marketing face lift and name change when the brew went from being a seasonal ale to a year round offering. This is an exceptional brew and makes for a decent example of the traditional German Maibock style. The west coast produces a number of Maibocks with Rogue and Gordon-Biersch being among my personal favorites. (Harpoon still leads this category though with its rendition).  Pours a very deep copper color with a slight haze. Theres a nice large frothy white head after drawing the pint that sticks around for some time. A tight white collar forms after the head dissipates but leaves a reasonable amount of lacing on the glass.  This one is quite enjoyable with its deep toffee and fruit aromas in the bouquet, both characteristics that come through with shining colors while drinking. An exceptionally smooth drink with plenty of malts and their proprietary Pacman yeast, it also dishes up a nice and polite bitter element in flavorings, which follows the expectations that one has from Rogue Ales.  A very likeable beer that, if it were easier for me to find, would likely be among my more regularly enjoyed brews. As an import though, Ill certainly drink it when I find it.  [ STATS:&gt;&gt; SERVING: 16 oz. pint / ABV: 6.5% / PRICE: $4.00 USD ]",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerBuilder,3.88,"Copper orangish in color with a thick off-white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is malty and fruity. This aroma carries over into the flavor as well. The malty, fruity flavors are balanced out by the hop bitterness. The balancing of the malt and hops makes this beer very easy to drink. Overall, I found this to be an excellent ale, well balanced and very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,kunzbrew,4.23,"This brew pours a hazy dark straw color with a nice creamy head that doesn't stick around to long but leaves a nice sexy lace in it tracks. A strong smell of hops fills the nose along with a caramel type smell of maltiness. The first sip reveals a strong hop presence along with a caramel maltiness that is amazingly good. This is very good brew and I am glad I found a store that has this in six packs, so I can get it all the time.  Cheers",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bewareOFpenguin,4.33,"This was a great offering. Poured a nice amber color, with good carbonation. The taste was awesome, with excellent malt flavor, and hops to compliment it. Not too sweet for this man's pallette. Not overpowering, good for drinking at least three bttles in one sitting. A definite great beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,proc,4,"Yet another winner from Rogue. Pours out to a very, good-looking amber in the glass with a light head. Carbonation is lively but not overbearing. Aroma is that of fruit with some floral overtones. Taste is nice and malty with a good dose of hops on the swallow, but not too much. I really like this brewery.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Quaffer,3.7,"Appearance: This beer had a beautiful golden amber color with a light head. The head dissipated quickly and left little to no lace on the glass.  Smell: There is a definite sweet smell to this beer, along with a fruitiness.  Mouthfeel: This beer felt full, and very smooth, in the mouth.  Taste: The sweetnes and fruitness that is present in the aroma of the beer if very evident in the flavor as well. Almost too much so for my tastes. I prefer more bitterness and less sweetness in my beers, so for that reason this brew did not score higher. All that said, this wasn't an unpleasant beer; just not the one for me. I did suck it down rather quickly, though, which led to the higher ""drinkability"" rating.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jarod,4.35,"This beer came to me at the table an amber color with hints of red and yellow-honey when held to the light, some cloud but you could see through it. The head was an off white/beige color that seemed to have some stability to it. Lace was present on the sides of the glass. The aroma was of much like a zinfadel or at least that is what the wife stated. I noted fruit, sweet malt, and some hops. The taste was incredible. Before I start I would like to say that I liked-loved this beer. Now, flavors of sweet malt, fresh fruit, caramel, hops, and a bit of alcohol at the end. They all just danced around my tongue like it was on vacation, and after the last sip I heard a slight sigh from inside my mouth (I swear) because it knew that the last sip was indeed the last sip and I had to leave. So I bought 2 bottles to take home, one to drink, and one larger one to save, because I loved the painted label on the bottle, simple but classy, plus I like stuff like that.

132,355,the42ndtourist,3.7,"I first tried this a few months back, and the bomber was spoiled. Quite the letdown, considering the price it fetched at the LCBO. Well, I have another courtesy of a trade, and this one was just fine.  Pours into the mug with a paucity of head, which disappears almost immediately. The colour is a slightly hazy fossilized amber. Nose betrays some sweet hop aromas, very northwestern. Taste of the beer includes a very welcome malty sweetness, unfortunately fighting with the hops all the way through. This actually adds a sour tinge to the taste which is unwelcome in this instance. Add to that the excessively floral qualities of the hops - which are not my preferred hop style, to say the least - and this beer loses some of it's appeal to me.  Still, not bad, and enjoyable. But I've got many other beers that I would rather drink first.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Sixpack595,3.98,"Good, but not outstanding. Pours a clear amber with fair head. Little head retention and minimal lacing.Moderate malt flavor with a bit of hops noticable.Slightly sweet with a medium thickness. A very drinkable beer, but nothing really grabs me. Will definitly put a few more away, but I won't go out of my way for it. Give it a try.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,canoehornpoint,4.13,"Cool label, pours predominanantly amber but slightly golden. Medium carbonation and thick frothy clingy head. Slithgly fruity aroma mixed with some spicyness. Aroma is not overwhelming but definately there. Taste is a malty fruityness that is rounded out with spicey hop flavor. It is complex. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but that's fine. The heaviness and body make it difficult to drink a number of these, even though you really would like to.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Ahhdball,4.3,Flowing from the bottle to glass it ran smooth with a creamy feel. It's head was tiny but frothy. Looks good so far. In the glasss it was a deep amber color and I could tell this was no ordinary beer.  A touch of fruit came from the aroma and it gave me a little start but none too great. I like to keep my fruit seprate from my beer. I could also smell a hint of nuttiness while it sat on the table.  After about 5 minutes I gave it a whirl and WOW I loved it. This beer is fantastic! A slight bitter taste first then the fruit came and calmed it down. It felt thick and creamy as I let it sit in my mouth for a while then swallowing came a caramel after taste. I loved this beer. After about a 15 minute break went by the beer had warmed slightly. I gave it another tast and the flavor of Molassas came through the bittery first taste. It changed flavors on me! Outstanding!  I will definetly have another and can't wait for more from Rogue! I think the Mocha Porter will be next but I'll see.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Stubbie1,4.32,"Man what a beer! It poured with a deep honey color and a very nice and creamy tan head. YUM! The aroma was great! I can find the all the words to express myself but lets start with, spicy, malt, fruity with a hint of hops. The taste was long awaited and well worth the wait. A great balance of malt and hops with tones of fruit bounce off your tongue! Mouth feel and drink ability are great! I was well pleased with this ale and would recommend it to anyone. Im looking forward to try more Rouge beers.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

This is a solid ale I wouldn't mind trying again sometime..,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,MJR,4.1,"Appearance: Spills into my imperial pint glass with an amber-copper color with a touch of red. A solid, light tan head starts strong and fades to a ring of lace that decorates the side of my glass.  Smell: An interesting mix of hops and sweet malt. A slight bread aroma weaves in and out. A touch of spicy fruit makes itself known as well. The faintest hint of alcohol too...  Taste: Starts with spicy fruit and moves to a bitter hop flavor. A good amount of butterscotch compliments the fruit well, and adds to the complexity. Finishes with an alcohol taste. I pick up on a touch of black pepper also, from the spiciness. All in all, a well-integrated flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Combines a medium thickness, with a semi-crisp mouthfeel. Goes down with a spicy, alcohol-tinged note...  Drinkability: Fairly good. The higher alcohol and the spicy complexity make it unlikely to drink more than a pint or two in one evening, though it is a very good brew.  Another winner from Rogue, and, as usual, they shun traditional guidelines to make a delicious brew.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,feloniousmonk,4.3,"I'm drinking this fresh from the tap--my second,now--while I peruse my notes on a review from a bottled serving. So what do I think now and what did I say then? We'll put the two together..  First off, like with any brew, this is 100x better on tap, the flavor explodes. Any time you can find it on draft, reward the operation,please, for their boldness and their taste, and order a Dead Guy instead of your usual local micro pale ale. But about the beer...Beautiful, big off-white head, gorgeous amber/dark orange color. Aroma: bright, fresh fruitiness, vegetableness, it's a veritable garden in here. Great hops, just mild enough, with loads of malt. I was confused about the style for a long time. I was led to believe that it was an Oktoberfest, but aren't they usually lagers? A recent trip to Oregon and a visit to a Rogue Ale House set me straight about the DG's true genealogy. An ale-style maibock! These guys are geniuses! Spicy but soft palate, very pleasant finish, an utterly delicious drink! Unfortunately, this brewer is acutely under-represented in this region.

132,355,CreamAle128,4.88,"This is one amazing beer! I usually try to stay away from American brews, from the few i have tasted, but this is one good beer. Its full of flavour, and kinda floral smell. For those of u who love a beer with a strong flavour, this is it, its got hints of fruit, and slight molassas, which i like very much. The only real complaint i have is that i wish it had a bigger head that retained itself, but the taste more than makes up for it. The appearance is very nice, giving a orange-red cloudy color. I will definatly be buying this beer again, and again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,cretemixer,4.25,Good looking beer. Nice amber color with a decent head. Malty smell that's really pleasant. The first sip did not dissapoint & held its own until the end. Very drinkable. I will be buying more as long as I can find it.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerAngel,4.25,"Pours a clear copper color with a medium off-white head. The smell is a delicious combination of roasted malt, caramel, and light sweet fruit. Nice indeed!

Even though it was probably old, it was still good. I wouldn't give it the best review, but I also wouldn't give it a bad review or an average review, because it was better than average. It had an overbearing alcoholy taste to it, which I don't really dig. If it were fresher, I'm sure it would have been better.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Amdahl,3.98,"Pours a beautiful amber color with amble thick head that reduces to a thin rind. The lace is minimal. Roasted malt is the dominant smell, but there is a fruity smell that I don&#8217;t recognize. The taste is a little bitter for my taste, but is still quite enjoyable. It starts out slightly sweet, but turns bitter. The finish is quite pleasant. This is an all around good maibock. This beer is a little heavy to drink more than 3 or 4 but it is definitely a beer that I will purchase again.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,HossMcGraw,4.45,"Dead Guy should be a staple in everyone's beer diet. It's got a full rich flavor, but at the same time it's light to medium bodied, and quite drinkble. To me, this tastes like everything Bass Ale aspires to be. The tastes are comparable, but Dead Guy gets it right. There is nothing too complex about this beer, and that's a good thing. It is a testament to the fact that your tastebuds don't always need to be assaulted with a billion different flavors to be an interesting beer. The beauty of Dead Guy is it's simplicity. It's also great with just about any food you can think of.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

It has some of the same qualities that I recall from the first time I'd tasted it. Pours a dark orange color with is sticky head. Great balance of malt and hops. Both present themselves in every aspect of the beer...from the first sniff through the finish. Aroma shows a more floral hoppiness as it warms. Likewise, sweet molases flavors appear as you work on the beer. It has a rough, hard-edged quality, with the flavors banging against one another.

It's got the unmistakeable bock smell of sweet malt but with more hops than the typical bock. It has toffee and caramel flavors up front with traces of ripe fruit and enough hop bite to liven things up a bit.

No idea how old this bottle was - there was a good bit of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, but it did not decant and, whatever the beer's age, it had aged quite gracefully. The only negative was that I did not have a bottle with the glow in the dark label I've heard about ... well, there's always next year.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88

The carbonation is quite lively, though its difficult to perceive due to the beer's cloudy quality. Rich caramel malt aroma with a fruity quality that is somewhat like dried apricot. Taste begins with toasted malts and a slight sting of carbonation, towards the middle of the taste the hops assert themselves fairly forcefully. Towards the finish, caramel flavors play off against the hop bitterness. The flavor range of the beer improved dramatically as it warmed.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jon,4.2,"A long time favorite of mine. Pours an orange-ish amber color from the tap with a frothy tan head. Head retains well and leaves decent lace all the way down the glass. Smell is fruity and sweet for the most part. Taste is of sweet maltiness at first, with some of the trademark Rogue hoppy bitterness presenting itself, as well. Feels rather smooth in the mouth.

I think I have more Bombers now than SAC. Pours a slightly hazy looking deep amber orange apricot color  Fabulous!. A very well organised cream head that has StratoCumulusCloud-like qualities. The Clouds leave a lacey residue on the glass sides as they float aimlessly by (down?!). Lovely fruity nose on this beer, and I am no expert, but the quality of ingredients used are definitely prevalent in the aromas I think. A bitter sweet malt introduction, that leads to quite a fruity hoppy middle (I like this part the best!!) for it teases you like a windowed semi-naked stunning looking prostitute in Amsterdam. You want more, you know you shouldnt!, but you have to have it!!!. As I worked my way through the beer, I find that I become easily more accustomed to its flavors, they are not strong, nor overwhelming, or even understated - just very well-balanced. Finishes with a nicely subdued hoppy malt finish with mild bitterness. A really good drinking beer this. I would like to try it on Draft.

Tastes more like an american style amber ale, but there is a bit of a munich malt twist to it. Solid maltiness and solid hop characteristics (of course). Has a spicy little noble hop kick. Almost full in body and almost a syrupy mouthfeel, but not quite. An enjoyable brew, even if it's not necessarily a ""true maibock.""",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,beerluvr,3.83,"This pours with lasting tan head over medium-amber liquid, with a gentle carbonation. A beautiful malty-bready aroma meets the nose. Taste is sweetness with depth, a bit of honey-ish notes followed by a subtle but effective hop bitterness. This finishes smooth and clean with some latent hoppiness to close things out. Another in a long line of winners from one of America's premier micros.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,hyuga,4.67,"Amber haze with a white, sticky head that mostly settles soon after the pour. Great balance of sweet malt and hops in the nose. Just a bit fruity and peat-like. With a taste, I literally become wide-eyed... what is this I'm tasting? Could it be? Pistachio! Right in the middle of the palate, a very clear pistachio-like character. Something I've never experienced in a beer before. Before I start ranting about loving pistachios, I'd better move on to the other characteristics. Sweetness from the malt, balanced well by the hops, as in the nose. Bread-like toasted malt character abound, especially with retro-olfaction. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that is both crisp from the hops and grainy from the malt. I'm really enjoying the unique character of this beer. Very flavorful and just plain enjoyable all the way through.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,NeroFiddled,4.27,"Slightly hazy. Reddish-orange in color with a fluffy ivory head that holds well and leaves some light lace. The aroma is mainly malty with a softly toasty caramel note and a lightly spicy hoppiness, as well as some dark fruitiness (at times I thought of cherry). The body is medium with a somewhat less than moderate carbonation level (very English), giving a nice creaminess in the mouthfeel. The flavor is richly malty with a solid caramel notes and some distinct, piney hops. It's well balanced, giving a see-saw effect that goes from sweet malt to hop flavor & bitterness with each taste. The finish is dryish with a nice hop flavor. Very nicely done. Very drinkable with alot of character. Highly recommended.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,doho95fu,3.65,"I think I was expecting more from this beer, because the friend I was with couldn't stop talking about how good it was. I found it good, not great. The color was orange-amber, but was cloudy. It poured nice with a creamy head. the smell was both sweet and hoppy. I tasted malt, honey. The bitterness was was what I was not expecting. Drinkable, but not the greatest beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,putnam,5,"Healthy, tenacious head of copper and cream color. The liquid is reddish gold. The color is so vibrant it looks like a light source of its own. A nose of baklava (honey, phyllo, roasted pistachios) dirty laundry and guava. Dense and tropical. Silky creamy texture that reveals delicate shadings of melon, tropical blooms, hops, strawberries, new paint, ... I can't get over how solid it feels...like heavy cream...and how bright and clean it is on the palate. The finish lasts and lasts. You can drink more than one of these, easy!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,bcm119,4.07,"Deep hazy amber in color, with a delicate white head. A sweet malty aroma hints at wood and honey. The nose is sweet and opens up to cinnamon and other baking spice flavors, as well as toffee. Mouthfeel is very rounded and soft. The hops provide solid bitterness in the finish, but don't completely cut the sweetness in the aftertaste. I like the complex malt flavors in this beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,zerk,4,"Don't understand some of the negative reviews of this one... I can't find a thing wrong with it, and find quite a lot right.  Hazy amber orange with very little head. Sweet aroma from malt, and floral / fruity hops. Very balanced between malt and hop flavors, with a medium body. MMM, tasty! A quality brew from a quality brewery.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BeerManDan,4.12,"I'll say that this is the least beer that I've tasted from Rogue. I thought it was to bitter. After the first taste, I couldn't pick up the flavor of this brew. I might try again later, but I won't go out of my way. Second time around I found it pleasant with a malt, hoppy and caramel flavor. The bitterness was not over powering and was a pleasant surprise.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ryanocerus,3.73,"Cloudy light brown color with thick off-white head that lasts until the last drop. The smell was light malt with a slightly nutty smell. But the smell was light overall. The very sweet malt flavor and slightly bitter/dry finish was nice. The flavor was long-lasting, but the beer was not active enough to warrant more than a 3.5 for mouthfeel. I would call it an above average beer, but not great.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,BillyBrew,3.98,"Not as great as other Rogues. Nice looker with a subtle, pleasing nose. Nice toasty, flavourful malts with balancing hops. I found the body to be a too light for my tastes. To hell with helles.  Flavourful malts and balancing hops, but too light for me. Worth a try, however. Cheers",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,jreitman,4.2,Gold-orange in color with a nice thick head. Pleasing malty nose. Nuts and sweet flavors in the mouth with a good touch of bitterness. Very well balanced almost to the point of perfection.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,StevieW,4.7,"The dead guy has been sitting on my shelf for about a month and I finally got around to him last night. Wow, What a good beer. Deep burnt orange to amber in color, the head was very full, fluffy and thick with a light tan color. Noticable hop aroama bubbles bust through. Slightly sweet, floral, and honey smells with a big burst of malt. Taste is unbelievably balanced with supersweet malty richness, and a crisp dry hopped finish. Tastes alot like the best amber ale I have ever had, that rich. I was surprised to see it listed as a Mai-bock. Whatever you want to call it, it's a great beer. Smooth and creamy richness, suspect a higher abv warms your belly. Another pleasant surprise from Rogue. This is another beer that made the cross-country trip from California, and well worth it.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,IrishRedRock,4.07,"The Dead Guy was a good guy. What a great, almost perfect balance of malts and hops. Both are so equally represented in this brew. Slight tartness and bitterness towards the end. Nice hoppy flavor, characteristic of Rogue. Chewy, caramel maltiness makes this very interesting, especially for the style. Subtle alcohol as well . Sooo much better on draught too...same flavor, but a bit creamier with more body. A session brew if ever there was one.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,frank4sail,4.3,Very malty (candy) nose with a hazy dark orange look. The head is very pale and lasting with a good lace on the glass. Wonderful taste of slight nut and sweetness followed by distinct bite. Layers of flavor. That bitterness gives great balence to the brews sweetness. Great smooth body through to the finish. Quite a complex ale.. there is alot going on here ... and I like it....,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ElGuapo,4.1,"isn't it ironic. the dead guy makes me feel very much alive. i will admit that i tried this beer because of the name. i work in a liquor store and i could not pass on the dead guy. let's just say i was pleased with this beverage. it was a dark and smooth ale that had a little kick for ya. i look forward to sampling other beers produced by Rogue brewing. malts provide a nice backbone whilte there are some nice spicy notes. a tad different than other maibocks, but very drinkable.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,DarthMalt,3.86,"Question: Why is this beer classified as a Maibock?  The first thing that comes to my mind is Strong Scotch Ale--the nectary nose, the woody flavor, the ""Ale"" appellation...the Dead Guy. How on earth does Maibock factor in?  When I drink this beer I'm thinking Skull Splitter, Old Jock, and Ale Mary--not Maibock.  Delicious beer! Quite hazy (like we care), straight-up-and-down fizz, sweet malty nectar through-and-through....and all those mysterious Highlander flavors.  ""There can only be one!""  Dead Guy",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Wildman,3.8,"This beer has a nice dark amber color and tan head. Nice aroma to it. Some sweetness to the taste, with a bit of tanginess. The title and label may be a way to get some of my punk rock buddies to switch from drinking Rolling Rock.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,mophie,4.23,"I have had a few more of these since I originally posted my review (see below), and what the heck was I thinking? This is really a very good beer. Much more balanced than I indicated in my original review. Oh well. ___________________  I have to admit I'm a bit confused by the style. Is it really a maibock? If so, why do they call it an ale? Keep these questions in mind as you consider this review. First off, it's got a great look: honey to almost-amber hue, with a nice white foamy head. The smell is confusing to me, though, with aromas of honey and tropical fruit but, IMO, too much hop fragrance (for a maibock). Same with the taste: a nice malty sweetness hits your tongue, but gives way to a rather bitter, typical Rogue hop finish. Don't get me wrong, I love hops as much as the next guy (and maybe even more than some), but I didn't think they really fit here.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,psugrad98,3.9,"Nice medium dark appearance. Thin head might be nicer if served from draught. Sweet malty bouquet with hints of fruit and flower. Rich and full flavored with good malt character, nice finish of sweet floral.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jason,4.3,"Presentation: 22 oz. bomber with no freshness date.  Appearance: Deep and lightly hazy amber honey in colour with a wispy white lace.  Smell: Sweetness coming from malt and hops, faint hint of exotic fruit ... mango or star fruit?  Taste: Smooth with a medium body, the smoothness from the carbonation hold together the malty mouth feel very well. Good dose of toasted malts, perhaps some Munich? A little sweetness comes forth also though is quickly cut by a evening hop character of both bitterness and an underlying oily flavour. The finish is pleasant and is reminiscent of crust off of some home made whole grain bread.  Notes: Delicious to say the least ... an all around prize ale brewed here, crafted very well. Great use of hops and malt to come up with a very drinkable brew ... a quaffer's delight.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Reverand,3.72,Love the label. I agree with some of the other reviews and saying that it's not a beer that knock you off your feet. But a good drinking beer.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Murph,3.94,Pours a nice yellowish pale amber with a nice thick creamy foamy head. Light earthy hops with a strong malt presence in the aroma. Strong malt body with light hops that balance this brew out very well. Creamy across the palate and dangerously drinkable. I agree with the previous reviewer. This isn't a knock you off your feet brew but definitely a very tasty brew. A great brew for a night of laid back drinking.,Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,aracauna,3.88,"I'd agree with one of the other reviews in that this isn't a knock-me-down great beer, but it's straight up solid, all-around good beer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,cokes,3.6,"This is a re-review, but the numbers haven't changed much.  Golden-orange semi-smoggy fluid below a pale yellow misty froth. Grainy nose, with boosts of green apple and alcohol. Oh, and hops (though not the typical Rogue assault, this *is* roughly a Maibock, and therefore hoppy for the style.) Enters with a caramelized apple fruitiness. Lingers in sweetish caramel/toffee direction, then turns increasingly more towards apple. Grainier midway, then ends with a lightly piney, herbal hop finish. Alcohol-aided ending. Lightly airy and medium in the mouth. Quite drinkable, but not terribly interesting. I'll be the first to admit that I prefer a traditional maibock. This seems like a training-wheels version for the American consumer.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,WilliamPhilaPa,4.42,"Dead Guy Ale starts with light malt aromas and notes of hops. The color is a golden amber color topped by a tightly bubbled, tan, fluffy head. On the palate it is very flavorful with an initial surge of honey sweetness and then notes of grapefruit tartness, followed by a very nice bitter finish. Yet another excellent brew from Rogue!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,ADR,4.1,"Hazy amber, not highly carbed. Relatively full-bodied. Extremely well balanced, malt has a creamy quality. Not a blast of taste but nice mouthfeel and full finish. Dee-rinkable! Nice if allowed to warm. Me like!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Bierman9,4.03,"On tap, a nice medium-golden color, with a slight haze and a creamy head. Mild hoppy nose. Medium body and smoothness on the palate. Tasty, malty semi-sweet start, finishes with a good, smooth hoppiness. Nice balance!  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  52",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,budgood1,5,"this is a maibock, not an ale. has a cloudy orange apearance and a saaz hop aroma. wonderfully balanced and is delicious. warm alcohol finish to boot. this is one helluva maibock. slides down so smooth, it's scary.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,Jordan,4.6,"Dead guy ale. What a name. It has both a strong malty caramel tendency and a bitter hops taste. So, I'd say it's very well rounded. There are also some slight earthy fruity flavors invading the palate here. Extremely tastey brew. A fairly potent whif of malty caramel on the nose. A superb beer!",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
132,355,nklatt,2.5,"I like a hoppy beer, but I found this a bit unbalanced. Has a great head and smell. Goes great with spaghetti.",Rogue Ales,"Oregon, United States",Maibock,88
