"It’s a good controller. My original one is still fine and I do 3-4 hours gaming a day.

I bought this as a second controller. No complains so far. It was cheaper on amazon",5,2022/12/26
excellent genuine controller,5,2022/12/23
Works with PC out the box (card is thin so open carefully if you wanna save the box) you'll need to set up configuration of you controller in steam or other software but it works great.,4,2022/11/27
Amazing :),5,2022/12/18
"This is a fantastic controller, that I am using on PC. Its great for Sony PC games especially, such as God of War, Spiderman, Death Stranding, Horison Zero Dawn. I'm looking forward to using it on The Last of US Part 1 when it releases on PC. And at £56 it is a bargain. Also good on Elden Ring, Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite, Kena Bridge of Spirits and The Quarry.",5,2022/11/17
Works great,5,2022/12/18
I like these controllers better than Xbox for comfort and gameplay but don't seem to last as long on build quality I have both ps5 and Xbox x and have to say I play alot more on my ps5 but the left control stick on two dual sense have like blistered up and I can see them falling off had both consoles for a year and the Xbox controller is still looking new although I play my ps three times more I would say and I'm on my third controller.,4,2022/10/16
does the job,5,2022/12/11
it is but of happday,5,2022/12/06
Fast delivery and great quality. Thank you!,5,2022/12/05
"So far, this controller seems to be working fine. This is however my third dualsense controller I've had since getting a PS5 in November 21. First one doesn't turn on and won't charge. Second suffers from dreadful stick drift (to the point where stealth in TLOU2 was almost impossible, as Ellie just slowly walks out of cover, even without holding the controller). Hopefully it's third time lucky, but I remain cautious.

I've been a gamer most of my life, but have never had such consistent problems with an aspect of a system since having the red ring of death 3 times back on the Xbox 360 days. Hope this quality issue is fixed by Sony soon! As I stated in the title, I don't even get to play much these days, so it's not like I'm wearing them out or anything.",3,2022/11/10

Enjoying it,5,2022/11/25
"I love the feel of this controller, the position of the analogue sticks and the responsiveness of the d-pad makes it my preferred choice over Xbox controllers, I exclusively use it for PC gaming. Sadly the left analogue stick has begun to drift after just 18 months of use, which is no time at all compared to my experience with other, older controllers.",3,2022/12/03
Yeah,4,2022/10/18
Excellent,5,2022/11/15
The only major downside is I only get like 4 - 5 hours battery life if that.,5,2022/11/04
Brought for my grandsons for Christmas. Very happy with my purchase,4,2022/10/05
"Took a while for this to agree with my PC for whatever reason. Also a bit finnicky to turn off and on, takes like 10 seconds on the power button to turn off and only a slight tap on the panel or power button to come back on. I have a controller rack which has woken this thing up from ""Off"" mode before just by hitting the against the panel.

Outside of that, when working it has zero issues with Steam games that support it natively. I usually prefer using KBM but some games just prefer gamepads, so I bought this to replace an aging XB360 one I've had for a while.

Looks sleek, feels quite premium, no real construction issues. It does feel like a struggle to justify the price though.",4,2022/04/19
"Expensive, you could buy a car for the same price back in my day, but it keeps my daughter happy",4,2022/08/18
Great controller. Works on both ps5 and Nintendo switch (with pairing adapter).,5,2022/10/16
This Controller is ok for the price but breaks within a 5-6 months because of controller drift as usual and the box doesnt come with the charging cable which sucks and will cost extra but luckily i have a spare cable so thats good and well the haptic feedback is amazing as always,4,2022/06/13
"Today I received my DuelSense controller… but alas no PS5 to connect it to until next Thursday :(

I’ll update this review once I’ve had chance to try it out, but I thought I’d offer my opinion on the aesthetics for the time being.

The DuelSense is slightly larger than the DuelShock for the PS4 - this is something I like, as it finally feels like a worthy challenger to my beloved xBox controller (which was the thing I missed the most when I swapped sides from team Microsoft to team Sony back in the XOne/PS4 days).

It also feels more weighty than the DuelShock and I love the design with the teeny tiny PS symbols that adorn it’s beautiful facade!

I would point out that there is no charging cable included, which is disappointing for a premium product (and explains why I’ve only awarded 4 stars). That being said, I’m sure the PS5 will include a charging cable, so it’s not the end of the world.

For me, this is the best looking controller on the market. Whether it is the best performing remains to be seen, and is largely a subjective view anyway. I can’t wait to try out the adaptive triggers and the haptic feedback, but for now, I’ll just have to be content to hold it in my hands and dream of what goodness might await!

Update #1
For anyone reading this and wondering why I've not updated my experience with the DualSense, it's purely due to the fact that my PS5 died within 4 hours of ownership (see my PS5 review on Amazon). As such, I never really got to experience the greatness that others have commented on as I didn't get to play any games. That being said, I can confirm that the experience of using the controller whilst I was setting my PS5 up (before it failed) was really positive - as already commented, the size and weight now feel perfect, and movement just feels more fluid (partly down to the improved PS5 UI, but this beautiful piece of equipment also factors in). Unfortunately, as my PS5 is in console heaven, I'm back to using my DualShock with my PS4... which now feels entirely inadequate!",4,2020/11/12
An original controller for ps5 but bulky but easy to get used to. The layout hasn’t changed that much although I fear the battery life may be poor compared to previous gen,4,2022/07/01
My son is very satisfied with this product,5,2022/10/13
"This product is phenomenal.

It stops my teenage son mooching around the house and emptying my fridge. It also stops him from arguing with every other member of the family.

It's a miracle.",5,2022/09/27
The right stick was drifting once taken out box there fore returned,3,2022/11/04
"Essential for PS5, I got another one due to local multiplayer and because playstation controllers while good noticeably have rubbish battery life so swapping to a secondary controller is convenient doesn't come with the charging cable but then they never have since the PS3 days regardless of price",5,2022/08/20
"Bought this from Amazon warehouse

It was in immaculate condition and apart from the box being a bit rough round the edges it’s great

Love Amazon warehouse",5,2022/09/22
"Bought the white one and it only lasted 3 months until the left stick developed extreme drift. [FCCID ends in CT1A. Model number ends in ZCT1W A (the A is tiny)]

My previous white dualsense was the older model, and that lasted 10 months until the R1 button failed, with no sign of stick drift. My usage pattern was basically the same for both controllers.

I put in a lot of hours but 3 months isn't acceptable.",3,2022/08/24
"All three (yes, THREE) of these controllers which I have owned within 2 years of having a PS5 developed stick drift - this is the phenomenon of the controller suddenly sending input to the the game when you are not touching any controls. It's pretty bad that an expensive piece of technology such as this could be so poorly designed, and a quick search on Google tells you that this is not something where I have been unlucky. This a good product with a terrible, terrible flaw that Sony clearly know about but are refusing to address. I guess if suckers like me keep getting forced to spend £50 on a replacement every 8-10 months then why should they fix the problem!",2,2022/11/24
"Original Sony PS5 controller. Very good, got it at great deal from Amazon Warehouse. Works wells and holds charge just as expected.",5,2022/09/18
"Used to love Playstation but have fully transitioned to playing on my PC and normally use my PS4 controller when playing certain games on Steam or Assassins Creed on Ubisoft Connect.

PS5 controller works great through Steam and if you havent got PlayStation icons, go to the games settings/cog then properties, controller and turn on the Enable Steam Input.

No cable is why this loses a star",4,2022/04/26
"As PS5’s only come with one controller, my children demanded an extra one. Which is fair enough.
Along with the 3D headset, the enhanced controller with force feedback is really the most notable upgrade that came with the PS5 if you ask me. It makes most games even more immersive
I already liked the design and feel of the old PS4 controller, but this wireless Dual Sense pushed that one back to the stone age - this is a big leap forward in gaming, aesthetics and immersiveness.
The former rumble motor has been replaced by dual actuators that mimic very specific frequencies and moves so that is leaves you with a much more realistic experience.
The adaptive triggers let developers set the level of trigger resistance, which works brilliantly in a wide range of situations. These seem like small incremental enhancement . But they are not.

Not only doe sit offer haptic feedback and dynamic trigger effect, the controller also has a built-in microphone a speaker and a touchpad. Further more, it has a good grip while it feels quite robust and slightly heavier compared to my trusted PS4 Dual Shocks. Perhaps most importantly, in-game movement feels very natural and fluid.
While the Dual Sense work with PS4 backward compatible games when played on the PS5 console, it does not work when connected to a PS4. also it lacks a front lightbar so you can not use it to play PSVR games. Also there is no charging cable included.",5,2021/04/30
"Bought it for use on PC.
Works plug and play with Steam as Steam has support for all controllers though with XBox Elite, PS and Switch Pro you have to enable that support in Big Picture Mode/Controller Options.
The gyro doesn't seem to want to calibrate properly so it's best disabled, that can also be done through Steam Big Picture Mode. The only inconvenience is if you run a game that may use the gyro, like an FPS, you have to run it through Big Picture Mode or it won't use the config that disables the gyro

Regular XBox controllers work without any additional faff as Windows has native support for them, as you'd expect. So if you don't want to mess about a little get an XBox controller. If you don't mind the minor inconvenience then get one of these as they feel better and they are the same price",4,2021/11/13
This is good quality original,5,2022/09/28
"Absolutely stunning

Thumbs up to this one👍",5,2022/09/19
"I needed a second controller to play with friends at home, but after few weeks using it the left joystick started to go crazy. I tried cleaning it, checking the controller with a technician but still doing the same thing which is annoying as I don't have control. I would have to buy another one, and I hope this one will last more than a few weeks.",3,2022/07/30
If you're looking to play PS5 games than this is for you.,5,2022/09/09
You cannot get a better controller than this. It is absolutely amazing in all aspects,5,2022/09/03
"Since the original DualShock controller, Sony have made considerable improvements over the years as technology got better and better.

I can see why they have diverted from naming this controller DualShock 5 but instead calling it 'DualSense', the reasoning for this is certainly key changes such as the old rumble motor and has now opted for dual actuators which can replicate specific frequencies to give a more immersive experience through haptic feedback.

Another key feature are the adaptive triggers which allows the game developer to add resistance to the triggers. A perfect example which has been used many times to explain this is when you draw a bow, initially it's very easy to pull back until it gets to a point where more and more resistance is applied making it tougher to go any further; developers can simulate these in the triggers.

The DualSense like the DualShock 4 also has an in-built microphone, speaker, touchpad, three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. With all the different sensory elements the new controller has in-built, it makes sense to call it ""DualSense"".

Important information:
• DualSense is NOT compatible with the PS4 console (as expected).
• DualSense WILL work with PS4 compatible games when played on the PS5 console.
• DualSense is NOT compatible with PSVR games when played on PS5 console. The main reason is because the DualSense has no lightbar on the front, so cannot be tracked.

And to end on a positive note, the DualSense controller feels incredibly robust compared to the old DS4 and is so comfortable to hold; in my personal opinion, I much prefer using the DualSense controller.",5,2020/11/14
The go-to pad for shooters,3,2022/09/17
"I have bought a bundle of these things with my PS5 .

Controller: surprisingly I thought it may feel awkward in comparison with PS4 older slimmer version but no, it's OK.
The sensitivity is very good. Seems better than PS4 one especially with thumb sticks on.
They look great and you can get cool silicone skins for them already.
Bad thing is that it doesn't come with charging cable.

Charger: you plug it into the main socket and not into your plays station meaning when you turn your PS5 off the controlers get charged when not in use , unlike other charges that are plugged into your console .
Bad thing is taht if you use silicone sleeves you have to take them off for charging as sleeves prevent sensors touching.
Also for 25£ I would expect some charging light indicator etc but no , nothing , just plain block.

Camera: it's slightly different than PS4 but made on the same principle, flexible leg and main body. Overall works well.",4,2021/08/02
"Having used consoles since the Atari, I've held a few controllers. So, you might think it's harder to improve on something we've held in our hands for many years, and yet, the boffins at Sony still manage to find a way!

The form factor is tidy, with the controller sitting in the hands well. The stems are still a little harsh as usual and when playing COD this can quickly produce a small bruise, depending on how much you play of course! Which for me, is a lot! I have added thumb cushions so all is good on that front.

The best bit I like is the haptic feedback when playing certain games, the resistance you get in L2 & R2 is impressive and mimics the feeling of pressure, much like you would expect if pulling the trigger on a real gun. They have cleverly built this feedback into other games which do not use guns and so it has multiple uses.

The controllers are light, and do not feel like they will wear down in the usual places, so quickly. The battery lasts ages, longest I usually play is 4 hours on COD multiplayer and I have yet to be concerned about the controller powering out on me.",5,2021/03/28
"Incredible controller with its adaptive triggers and haptics. It truly immerses you in a way no other controller has done.

However... quality control is an issue that needs to be addressed. There have been too many reports of triggers losing their 'strength' and thus being very limp and loose a few months in... there have also been too many reports of the analogue sticks showcasing drift issues a few months in... both of these aren't okay for a £60 product.

I say reports rather than saying I experienced them myself because I've only experienced one of these so far, that being the triggers turning limp/loose. I don't have any drift yet but the triggers turning limper as time goes on is extremely annoying - and this isn't just me getting used to the triggers and thus it not being as strong of a sensation as the first time because I have several new controllers (for family) that have barely been used and their triggers are much, much stronger.

Use a little more expensive parts instead of cheaping out on things like these and you'd have a perfect controller.",4,2021/03/05
"The controller has been upgraded for PS5 and there is plenty of reviews out there about it.

The 1st thing you notice is how much heavier it is than the DS4, this is due to the extra motors and sensors installed. I find it slightly too small for my hands as my little fingers seem to rub on the base of the handles which can be annoying after long gaming sessions.

My only other gripe is the built in speaker and mic, don't get me wrong it's ace for quick chat but for prolonged chat I still use my headset because I can't hear the other gamers loud enough over the sound of the TV when gaming. So for quick hello's the inbuilt speaker/mic does a job but for full on gaming chat you will still need your headsets",4,2021/08/26
"Edit - I wrote the below then I got drift in the right stick not long after so I sent it off for repair, bought a new one and again drift in the right stick, the haptics are great but the Series consoles (and Xbone) rumble triggers are great too, I've never had a problem with an XB controller since the 360, the Xbone Day One 2013 pad still looks and works like new, Series controllers are even more refined, I had drift in the DS4 controllers but nothing like this, the DS5 has more drift that a Fast and Furious 29 movie, it's unacceptable, it looks great, feels great and is next level but I'd prefer a decent made controller than the fancy haptics, the novelty has worn off them anyway and Astros Playroom is STILL the best demo of it, worked nice in Ghost of Tsushima if only they made the block and attack on the triggers, works great on some shooters and racers but you will never have a long lasting DS5 just a countdown until the dreaded drift sets in, lucky if you don't and PS fans deserve better.
Amazing controller, haptic feedback is a game changer, its now as comfortable as an Xbox controller but the bells and whistles it has is bext level, my only criticisms, and the first is a personal one, is i prefer the offset analogue sticks on the Xbox, the main problem once again is the battery life which obviously has deterioration over time is pretty poor, better than the DS4 but thats not saying much.",3,2021/04/16
Proper ps5 controller,4,2022/05/17
"These two stars are not an exaggeration, but are instead based on my experience across THREE PS5 controllers.

I have been a Sony fan since the first PlayStation all the way through to now and one massive problem that has built up over generations of gaming is PlayStation's controller durability.

Controller 1 issue: DRIFTING. The controller was completely fine to start with, I had not used it much but around 4 months later, my R3 stick began drifting which caused a lot of inconveniences in alot of games, especially FPS.

Controller 2 issue: WOBBLY CHARGING PORT CHIP. Around 6 months into using my second controller, the charging port chip in the controller became wobbly which would block a USB C charger from going in as the charging port chip kept moving out of place. Sometimes it would fully be clipped up or down and I would need to use a thin needle to carefully pull it back to the middle. This also made it difficult to charge the controller over time as the chip wouldn't always pick up on the connection of the charger. A very disappointing issue.

Controller 3 issue: TRIGGER BUTTONS GETTING STUCK. With adaptive triggers, I never experienced any faulty issues come about with my first two controllers until the third controller. Now when I press the R2 button down and let it come back up, it only springs back up to a very light pressed point. Because of this, the game will assume I am lightly pressing the R2 button when I have already let go of it and I had found myself constantly lifting the R2 button up whenever it was stuck down.

Personally, in terms of the controller's functionalities, I enjoy the use of them when ignoring these issues, especially the haptic feedback and immersive use of audio. However, it's durability issues have worsened from the previous generation and this will become very inconvenient when warranty runs out. Having to fork out an odd £60 each time isn't ideal and having bought 2 extra controllers, I worry for how much more money I'll end up wasting on anything controller related.",2,2021/11/07

"It's a PS 5 controller , what else needs to be said.",5,2022/07/25
Perfect Controller 🤩 Works Great 😊 Thank You 💜,5,2022/07/25
"I can't believe the people that are reviewing this without actually having a PS5 to try it on...

This controller is an absolute joy to use. The build quality is great and the white plastic is tough and stain /scratch resistant. The new haptic feedback is really something else, this is what elevates the Dualsense above previous generations.

The feedback is strong by default but can be adjusted in the options menu. I've been getting about 12 hours before I need to charge it playing Valhalla, which doesn't use a lot of the new haptic technology. If you're playing a game that does, expect this battery life to drop a little.

Having a headphone jack on the controller is fantastic as my Bluetooth headphones have trouble pairing with my TV. Being able to plug them in and not have to worry about that is a godsend.

If you want an excellent demonstration on what is possible with the new haptic tech, try Astrobots which is pre installed on every PS5 and is actually a fantastic little game, far better than it has any right to",5,2020/12/03
"Bought this controller a month ago as console only came with 1, but the triangle button isn't working. Was slightly temperamental to begin with but assumed that was my rubbish gaming! Now it's stopped completely. Directed to ps website for support but can't seem to find anywhere that helps.",2,2022/11/21
"I've had this controller since Jan 2021, Currently March 2022 so I've had a lot of time with it

The charger port is already breaking however, and despite having been gentle with the controller since buying it, the constant flimsiness of the VERY specific angle I have to play on is infuriating. Not to mention the fact I had to buy a cable after buying the controller as well

It feels nice, Haptic feedback doesnt work on PC, but thats sort of expected. It's just a bummer because aside from all of that, it's a genuinely nice controller",3,2022/03/21
"This has to be the defining item for the PS5. Playing through Astro's Playroom it gives you a proper sense (pun intended!) of what this controller is all about and what it can offer. The speaker isn't new, but gets used well. However, the advanced haptics that go from really gentle to pretty rough, without jarring the controller - makes old rumble seem like ancient tech. As for the adaptive triggers, those are literally something else, and Microsoft will be kicking themselves all to the way to the R&D department because make no mistake, these are here to stay and are as revolutionary as the introduction of dual analogue sticks and dual rumble - thank SONY for embedding those too.

Were it not for this controller, the new PS5 would only be somewhat worthwhile upgrading to right now, but because it has DualSense, it's a genuine upgrade. It helps that the controller is really comfortable too - something I was a little concerned about with the harsher angles at the bottom of the grips, but my hands are pretty small so all good!",5,2020/11/20
It connects to Steam very easily. The only complain I have is the lack of battery indicator.,4,2022/03/21
Easy to use controller nice fit in hands easy to use,5,2022/07/13
"Bought 6th March 2022 and had to replace within a month due to faulty R2, it's now May and I will have to return yet again as mine has now developed Stick Drift on the left stick which makes FPS unplayable, worse when aiming so have to free aim to be able to actually play.
Increased the price from Dualshock 4 and apparently they are using parts from Dualshock 4. The stick drift is a very common problem and apparently better with newer models (the new funky coloured ones) it is that well known that Sony themselves offer to fix any that are out of warranty and provide you with free postage. Absolutely shocking with how much they want to charge you for one.
Other than the common faults that occur I think they are a good pad and easy to hold and play. NEVER have I experienced stickdrift with Dualshock 4, just wear and tear.
Id say the controller gets used about 8 hours a day so if they cant even last 2 months at that imagine what it would be like in 12 months after warranty expires.
Maybe cheaper to look into a device that allows you to use Xbox controllers as they have always been more robust.",2,2022/05/10
Thanks,5,2022/07/27
I brought this controller as I initially wanted another PS4 controller but they were sold out - I do not regret buying the PS5 controller. It’s basically the PS4 controller but more sturdy. Definitely recommend.,5,2022/06/01
Happy and arrived in time to shut us all out of his room. Teenage dream for now,5,2022/06/22
"Well due to the UK PS5 date being after the peripherals, all I can say at this time is that the DualSense controller looks super, and feels great in the hand, I’ve added some comparison images to the DualShock4 from the PS4. I particularly like the cut off edge on the handle which allows it to sit more flush to the palm than the old one and it generally has a quality feel, slightly heavier and more sturdy feeling. Anyway I’ll update when I can actually review functionality!

Update - having had chance to play with the new controller, Astros Playroom is built to display the capabilities, I can say it is amazing!! The force feedback triggers are great and offer real resistance, the haptic effects are excellent, you can feel rain falling on you, sound crazy but it works, the motion control is super accurate and the size and shape are great, that little extra bulk with cut offs make a big difference.

A lot of it is still what you will have loved from PlayStation controllers going back years but this is a big step on.

Overall great bit of kit!",5,2020/11/15
Delivered with damaged packing. It looks like it has been opened and closed multiple times. This is a Xmas present and looks second hand. Very poor,2,2022/11/29
"While the technology of this controller is excellent, it ships without a charging cable. Perhaps they assume that most people who would have a PS5 are tech-savvy enough at least to have a suitable cable about the house for some other device. Still, for the price, they really ought to include a cable.

I bought one in mid-June; three months' later, it developed stick drift, a common fault that was reported by many users within weeks of the console's launch. The controller that was supplied with the console developed this fault within a month. It affects the right thumbstick on both controllers. Sony was aware of the fault when I bought the one in June, yet clearly hadn't done anything about it. There is a procedure to correcting the fault, but it hasn't worked on either of my controllers; and, anyway, I shouldn't have to try it, because Sony should correct the product instead of selling it faulty.",3,2021/10/07

"This review is for the PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller.

The first thing you will notice is the look of the controller. It looks very space age and different to the PS4. It will take a little getting used to playing with the controller but it is very comfy.

The layout is basically identical to the PS4 controller with a slightly redesigned home button, and slightly larger triggers and touchpad. It has a built-in microphone and headphone jack which could be handy.

The big negative.. very strange but it does not come with a charging cable! Now that is a first time I have purchased a product that does not come with a cable to charge it. For £59 you pay for the controller you would have expected this to be included.. come on Sony... a bit slack!
However I will not let that impact my review and rating of the controller itself.

So over all love it, great looks and feels nice, tiny bit heavier and larger than the PS4 controller.",5,2020/11/12

This controller has failed keep vibrating and losing connection when wired. perhaps the msot annoying thing is the controller headphone port take over your PC master volume when conected a right pain.

Unfortuantely with product is crap like all Games controllers they are alt rash and just an over priced cash scam.

Unfortuantely I can't reccomend any controllers as iv bought so many all have failed within a few days, weeks or months of buying them the whole controller market is a scam market.",5,2021/01/04
Worked fine for a month or 2 but now left analog stick constantly tries to go right,2,2022/11/14
"When it arrived, the undersides of the controller had stains on it, it was scrached on the right hand side next to the 0 button. I gave that the benefit of the doubt until i tried to connect it to my device. The PSN button doesnt work (meaning you cant connect the controller) the X, Square, Triangle and 0 buttons dont register. In addition to this but the UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT buttons dont register either! The controller doesnt charge at all making it a pointless purchase.

I recommend you go purchase one in stores rather than online and certainly not through this seller. I'm so dissapointed to feel the urge to write this review but I can't say im wrong too.",1,2022/11/02
Best controller I've ever had,5,2022/06/02
I had the controller for a couple weeks and the battery will not charge anymore and I only used it a few times and it's still in new condition,2,2022/10/14
have used only a few times with tomb raider game i think it has drift when playing game menu pops up pausing game dont think i will buy again from warehouse,3,2022/03/27
"I’ve had my PS5 for a year now and its controllers are great. Kinda wish there was a black version back then, but nevertheless, very good controlle",5,2022/04/07
As per title. Bought a few of these after buying a PS5 (for when I can have mates over once finally out of lockdown). I like them but had to turn down the force feedback / vibration as the default setting on the console makes these sound like they are going to vibrate apart. Its like theres a loose connection or something. I originally thought this was a defective unit but they are ALL the same and its massively better after tweaking the settings but would have expected better for a genuine product,4,2021/04/07
Mine came with a scuff that made me dread poor quality control in the rush to churn out product...however in using its its perfectly fine so don't mind it and even use it to my advantage as to indicate 'my pad' and not the one that came with the console. I always wondered if the console pads were better than the sold separately pads - I guess this will help me answer that wonder as time will tell. Holding this new pad helped me remember the first PlayStation pad I ever held (ps1) and I could feel and see the great refinement! I like the nano ps icon grip too like on all the new peripherals.,4,2020/11/20
"I have now had two replacements for my PS5 controllers and once again, they are both mildly broken. it's alway the same issue, the control sticks start having a mind of their own and will be flimsy. these are not worth half of what Playstation charge for them and will eventually break after about a year of use, also i alternate between my two controllers so one is always charged, and to give a little more longevity to their lives... but here i am a year down the line and both have broken. do not buy another, just make sure you complain before the year warranty and get your free controller before it is unuseable and like me now, there is no warranty so i have to spend another £60 or however much it is to replace them.",1,2022/09/30
"I charge it overnight and it says 12%, or 25%, it's always saying the battery is low

the controller itself is great, even when using on a pc you can use DS4 to play with how stiff the triggers are, and can map them to multiaction commands, it works as a mic on pc when plugged in with a wire, but every time i use it, it says the battery is low, it doesnt matter how long i charge it for",4,2021/03/28
"First off, I absolutely love the controller. Feels great to hold and the adaptive triggers is a cool feature too (although there aren’t too many games which make use of this just yet)

The inbuilt mic is a nice feature too, however it would be nice to have an option to have it automatically muted on start up as I tend to forget.

Now for the issue... the R2 trigger spring seems to snap. I’ve owned my PS5 since release so 3-4 months and the spring has broken already. I knew something had happened as I could instantly feel that it was very loose and when I shook the controller, I could hear something rattling (probably the spring). I took a look online and saw that there were many people who had experienced too. However, when they tried to organise it to be fixed with Sony, they were told they would have to pay shipping too.

I’m rating this 3 stars, it’s a great controller however for £60, I would expect the springs to be better quality and not snap so easily.",3,2021/01/28
"I bought this controller, having 0 expectations of it being good. I mainly play PC, so I bought it for Rocket League. At first, it was difficult learning the change, but it feels amazing in my hands and isn't too small (I have big hands). I would not go back. 10/10",5,2021/12/28
The one I originally got for the console is really good and I highly recommend it however the one I bought online didn’t work unless connected to the charging cable and still has massive input delay furthermore it also had no haptic feedback or other next generation features,3,2022/01/10
"Works fine on pc tho didn’t come with any cables luckily I had a c to c usb that worked with it, apart from that it functions well on Pc",4,2021/09/16
"The haptic feedback is great, controller looks fantastic and for the most part fits comfortably in my hand.

It is larger than the PS4 controller so for those with smaller hands this may be a problem. Also white is a poor colour choice as the controller quickly shows up marks.",4,2021/06/14
"I bought this for use on a PC, however rumble function doesn't work without DS4Windows (Which kept randomly disconnecting the controller)
Additionally, the convex analog sticks are no good if your hands get sweaty, and I found my thumb slipping off during gameplay (and in tense moments, gripping it with my thumbnail to stop it slipping). As a result, after two weeks of use, the rubber has a gogue in it
Ended up returning it for a new xbox controller",4,2021/02/20
"Received the Dualsense today ahead of the ps5 which release in one week so not been able to use it yet. It looks fantastic, surprisingly heavy compared to the DualShock 4 however was not aware that there is no charging cable supplied (its in the small print that it isn’t included) however for £60 this is pretty poor and becoming a trend amongst the companies like Apple and Sony to grab even more cash from you. The ps5 will come with one charge cable but for the price could they not include?",4,2020/11/12
"Comfortable to hold. It comes with a built in mic which is handy for those that don’t have a headset. Some games such as Astro’s Playroom make use of this feature for in game actions. This feature can be switched off by default in the console’s settings or via the mute button on the controller.

Although the PS5 console comes with one controller and one USB-C charger, the individual controller does not come with a charger so don’t expect to see one in the box!
The PS5 controller holds its charge longer than the PS4 controller.",5,2021/04/13
"The console itself (despite looking like it was designed but a lunatic let loose on an etch-a-sketch) feels like quite a small jump forward this gen. This controller however feels like the future.

The (adaptive) triggers feel different depending on what you’re doing and the controller vibrates according to what’s happening on screen.

Whilst it’s early days and there relatively little true ps5 content yet, the future feels exciting.

But if you’re buying this then I presume you’ve already got a Ps5 and already own the controller that came with it so.... this is just another one of those.",5,2021/02/05
Not much to say except it’s a great pad. It’s expensive but it’s the same price where ever you shop.,5,2022/03/07
"Do not pay more than retail price for this product (£24.99) as it’s simply not worth 60 quid and it shouldn’t even be advertised here at that inflated price as your only encouraging resellers. That being said the product does exactly what it say, keeps both of your controllers charged and you can keep them on the stand even when they’re fully charged as it won’t keep charging them when they’re at capacity.",4,2021/02/26
"I paid for a new controller, but received a used product. It has marks of dirt in certain places, the R2 key feels different from the others, and some buttons have the signs somewhat erased. It is clear that it is not the new product that I ordered and paid for. It's a shame for such a big company! And I'm not sure if there should have been a charging cable in the box. I did not receive anything else besides the used controller.",1,2022/10/15
Great no issues just as new.,5,2022/04/14
I accept that purchasing used comes with its risks but the quality control from amazon warehouse on this particular item is poor and possibly due to a lack of understanding of the product. In a nutshell it took 3 attempts to get a fully functional controller. I notified amazon and hopefully this won't be an issue for others. Controller itself is great obviously.,5,2021/08/19
"Bought this to play multiplayer games with my brothers and friends when they come over. Very pleased. We don’t have to wait to take turns. We can play split screen and co op games together :)

Only thing I’d complain about is the price. It’s just the same as any other game.",4,2021/04/22
"Works perfect.
Great to have spare controller for friends and famo to play multiplayer!",5,2022/03/19
"So the PS5 Controller has landed, so I thought I would in box it and get it fully charged for the arrival of the PS5 BUT no charging cable in the box and it’s a USB-C needed!!!
Contacted Sony and it does not come with a charger WTF NO charger so how am I suppose to charge it!!!!! Crazy
Yes the PS5 will come with a charger but firstly I don’t have the PS5 and secondly what if I want to charge 2 controllers at once??????
Utter madness",4,2020/11/14
"I ordered a used PS5 controller from Amazon Warehouse. Description said that there were huge scratches, but since it was so cheap it didn't bother me. It actually only had one small scratch under the right handle, so I was pleased. What I wasn't pleased about was that the left thumbstick was damaged and was stuck moving to the left, which indicates a damaged gyro. Sent it back for a full return as this was not mentioned in the description.",2,2022/06/06
Seriously cool additions in comparison to the PS4 controller. The haptic feedback feels very different to the dual shock system but in a nice way. I personally found the default to be a bit overpowering and distracting so turned it down a notch. The adaptive triggers are insane making firing weapons far more fun and immersive than just the sound. The textured feel is much nicer and easier to grip than the PS4 controller too. Battery lasts around a full day of play with light at dimmed to lowest and haptic feedback set to medium.,5,2021/01/29
"Not a bad controller but not brilliant. Some fun gimmicks but they quickly lose their charm and it can feel quite uncomfortable to hold after a period of time, plus some of the buttons are far too close together. Still, better than the previous controller.",4,2021/05/17
These joypads are just fantastic. I've always been a xbox fan for the joypads now my xbox doesn't get used because I'm constantly on ps5 very comfortable and the control over them is just unbelievable . Thank god and Sony for playstation lol,5,2021/11/28
"These controllers are amazing, very comfortable to hold and alot of amazing features like the built in mic and speaker. My only issue with the controller is I've had to send my original one back that came with the console as the right trigger went completely floppy and lost all tension. Luckily Sony will take them back and send you a new one. Hopefully its an easy to fix design flaw.",4,2021/01/29
"best controller i've used so far (ive tried every mainstream controller - including xbox one elite controller - though havent tried the new xbox controller yet. feels great to use joysticks are really satisfying and controller feels like it reacts to your button presses, which is weirdly nice.

only problem is the battery life. the controller doesnt include any wires or chargers at all and i dont have a ps5 yet so i dunno if the official chargers are more efficient. the battery lasts for only a few hours which can get really annoying. ive been using my laptop charging wire to charge it and half the time im sceptical as to if its actually charging. big annoyance.

other than that, good controller",3,2021/04/18
"This controller is a game changer! The immersion created by a controller alone is incredible, if you are walking on sand it “feels” like you are on sand, if you are in water it feels and sounds like you are in water. The triggers adapt and change to suit what is happening, so if you are pulling back a spring for instance, the tension on the triggers increases as it goes, just like pulling a real spring! Coupled with the integrated microphone and change of shape from dualshock to increase comfort when playing, The dualsense is absolutely amazing, 10/10",5,2020/12/14
"I like it, if you're looking for a good controller this'll be the one. Keep in mind if you're using PC, Computer, Laptop, Desktop it will work on some steam games but a lot of games do not have support for this controller. And also do not expect to take advantage of all of its features at the moment on computer as it needs official or at least good third party drivers.",4,2021/01/25
"I play on PC and I use a Playstation controller for almost all games.
PS controllers really suit me and I think this latest one is the best yet. The buttons and triggers feel more or less the same to me, but I like them. As you can see it is chunkier, and that will suit different people more or lesser.
I don't know what the haptic feedback is like and I don't use rumble.
You can change the light bar to any colour your like with the latest version of DS4Windows.",5,2021/01/17
After getting a Bluetooth 5 adaptor the ps5 controller works great with steam games (some configuration is required on windows) but once done the feedback and keypad texture is great. i do feel the responsiveness of the controller is significantly better than my old xbox controller.,5,2021/10/30
On time delivery and makes my pew pew game work the way its supposed to.,5,2022/02/24
"I start with the good things. Haptic feedback surprisingly good and a neat feature. Better to be experienced in your hands than explained. It feels awesome in the hands and real pretty snug.

Now the bad sides. Firstly I experienced analogue drift on my first controller with less than a month. Sony did replace it with a new controller. In the mean time I purchased one from Amazon and with in less than a week the R2 got stuck and snapped but Amazon replaced it.

I've had two controllers for a few weeks now and they're great controllers even though the battery life varies from both controllers which is odd?

So I am now on my 3rd and 4th and I'm a little nervous mine will break again. But I'm still impressed with the build quality and overall feel of the controllers",3,2021/02/03
"Good quality, very durable and comfortable to use. I bought it to play with my PC as I like controllers for some games like cars or fight games.",5,2022/01/19
Better fit to the hand than previous version. The haptic feedback is good but the adaptive triggers is another level. Shooters are much more immersive and if you play a game that features bows is amazing. Love it!,5,2021/12/01
best controller sony has made so far haptic triggers are amazing and very comfortable in your hands.,5,2022/02/13
"Oh first review.
As the PS5 doesn't release in the UK for another week I've only been able to hold and charge the controller.
It definitely feels more solid and a premium build compared the old PS4 controller.
Also heavier and slightly bigger but nicer to hold.
My only gripe is, would it have killed Sony to provide a charging cable when customers fork out 60 quid for a controller? For that I'll deduct one star.",4,2020/11/12
"Bought this to use with my gaming laptop. Installed jtran2795's ds4windows with dualsense application and works great 👍 controller feels solid in the hand and paired with bluetooth easily ( hold ps button and small button to the left of trackpad at same time to pair). Also quick tip for those playing on pc: hold ps button and small button to the right of trackpad to switch co ntroller off.

The one thing that was stopping me from switching from xbox was the ps controllers were too small and thin but now i am happy with this one and will be finally switching so will get the ps5 instead when i do buy a console.",5,2020/11/12
The spring behind the L2 trigger snapped rendering the L2 trigger loose and the controller unusable. Sony customer support is non-existent. This issue seems to be pretty common and the cases I have read about that reached Sony have lead to the consumer paying postage for a problem that wasn't their fault. Luckily Amazon support are fantastic and they have offered to replace my faulty controller. Seeing as the PS4 controller uses the same spring without this issue occurring I would be inclined to believe the adaptive triggers are the issue by adding too much strain to the spring. I have turned this feature off to prolong the life of my hardware and I would recommend others do so too as the hassle is not worth it.,3,2021/03/03
The controller feels a little big and bulky compared to the ps4 pad and the back part of the pad feels like a light plastic but overall I think it looks really good.i like the microphone built in with a single button push on off. I seen some reviews that say has no charge cable like that's a new thing but didnt ps4 pads come without a cable? Maybe I'm wrong but no need to take a star off for that the ps5 comes with one and most modern phones have that cable and cheap to pick up one,5,2020/11/14
This control just feels more premium than the DS4s. The control has a nice weight to it and fits my hands comfortably. Personally I love the clean white look that PS have gone for this time around and straight out of the box I was able to hook up to my ps4 through remote play. Works like an absolute dream! The only downside is the control comes without a cable... I think for £60 the least they could do is add a usbc cable!,5,2020/11/15
Works with ps5.,5,2022/03/04
"The controller at first sight looks like any other ps controller before it however packs some pioneering tech under the hood. Without spoiling too much, you really need to experience it yourself to get a true feel for all the features. The free included title with ps5, astros playroom does a stellar job of showcasing all of the features so be sure to try it out. Compared to an xbox series x controller, this controller wins hands down",5,2020/12/24
"I've tested all the features, I've inspected it high and low, I've used it for hundreds of hours and I am in love. The ONLY thing I would change about this controller is the spacing of the face buttons, they're a bit too far away, that's it. I love it",5,2021/07/29
Barely used it a couple times gaming in the last two weeks and the drifting just kept getting worse. I don't mind not having a charging cable included but this sucks. Might just send it back.,3,2021/10/18
"A great controller but the R2 button breaks easily. Mine broke after only a week. I did send it back to Sony for repair and got a new one instead but still, it’s a shame that breaks so easily. Never had any issues with the PS4 controllers.",4,2021/02/08
"Bought this new for a Santa present, arrived like this obviously already has been opened and taped up again.",1,2022/12/11
"Exactly as expected, this companies customer service is also excellent.",5,2022/02/01
A great looking controller.feels very sturdy and it’s a little bit bigger than the PS4 controller which should (hopefully)stop me getting arthritis after I’ve been playing a few hours non stop. After using the OS4 controllers for extended periods I feel like my hands are in a permanent claw. Bought this in anticipation of getting a PS5. 4 months later still no sign of them unless you’re a bot.,5,2021/02/15
The DualSense controller worked perfectly fine for the past few months and have been a very enjoyable experience. The weight of the controller feels good and the new features make it feel next gen unfortunately all this new tech make it far more prone to failure as I found out . My right trigger has gone loose and and overlay sensitive with the lightest of touch setting it off. I've now contacted Sony for a repair which is pitiful for something that cost £60 only a few months ago,3,2021/04/12
Great quality however it doesn’t come with a charger.,4,2021/08/13
"Bought to play with two controllers on my Ps5, controller works great, no problems, happy with my purchase!",5,2021/12/28
"R2 button is broken haptic feedback is no longer usable, also has drift issues.",3,2021/12/29
"Purchased a second controller for my system, so I can have 1 charging and 1 being used.",5,2022/01/01
"I don't have the PS5 yet but this just seems so much better than the DS4 controller. The size, ergonomics and the design is definitely appealing. I just wished that they kept the price low as at £60 this becomes harder to recommend to anyone for PC gaming over the previous gen controller.",4,2020/11/18
"The actual controller quickly became my favourite. But the first one broke within 25 minutes of use. The X button kept getting stuck and wouldn't register.

The replacement broke within a week. It stopped charging no matter what I tried. I've always looked after my controllers with the up most care so I've no idea what's happened to these two.

I've given 3 starts because I can't fault the comfort etc of the actual controller. But having 2 break on me with very little use concerns me over the products build quality.

A £60 controller should not break within a week or two of use.",3,2021/01/31
I bought a controller and the thing is absolutely amazing! It is really immersive! However when my controller arrived the box was very damaged luckily the remote was not but the box was which slightly ruined the unboxing of the remote.,4,2021/02/16
"Always handy to have an extra controller, wired as well means no running out of batteries.",5,2021/12/29
"Looks good, and more importantly feels good. PS4 and older controllers always felt flimsy to hold but this has a lot more heft to it.

Not including a cable for £60 seems a bit ridiculous.
Hopefully proper PC support arrives sooner or later so I can enjoy the adaptive triggers as well.",4,2020/11/13
if u looking for nice pad to play games on your pc or ps3 its good choice but if u want to play ps4 with ps5 pad goodluck wasting your time doing it directly :) overall im satisfied but cant use it wireless without application to remote play :(,4,2020/12/24
"I'm only giving it 3 star as I've had issues with the pad
Initially it feels great and the haptic feedback is good but the trigger buttons r very flimsy. The R2 button became very loose after using it as most shooter games use that button and made it too sensitive. I only used the pad for a few days as well!
A lot of people have had similar issues with the new pad if you look online and seems like they are still using the same material as the old Dual shock 4 pads....really ashame
Amazon are kindly sending me another one and hoping that doesn't break as easily, fingers crossed",3,2021/01/13
"If you're the kinda guy to only use xbox controllers for your PC Games. I made the move and I'm very, very happy with it.

I have only had this controller for around 2 months and it has sever stick drift,2,2022/07/20
"The L2 and R2 trigger have a common issue of becoming less resistant than when they're first bought and its not naturally over time, its because the spring inside can either snap or fall out of place. The triggers will become way too sensitive if this happens and ruins the gaming experience. VERY VERY bad design on the controller.",3,2021/05/25
"Pay top price for a control pad and they can't even be bothered to throw in a charging cable.

It's a nice design and everything but not supplying the very component need to charge the item is ridiculous, heck even WISH sends charger cables and they suck.

I'm giving this three stars just becuase the actual pad is decent. But no cable is a no no for me and people can argue 'theyre only cheap just buy one"" if they're only cheap why not supply one lol",3,2020/11/13
Box arrived tampered with not confident the controller is not a used or broken one,1,2022/11/29

Also disappointed with PlayStation not including a charging cable in the box, especially with the controller costing £59.",4,2021/01/09
"Bought a spare pad but I have felt the sensations you feel that come through the pad when you're doing things in games (Astros Playroom demonstrates this brilliantly).
Caters for your sense of touch, brings another layer to gameplay and feeling is believing. Quite pricey, but when you've already shelled out for the PS5 you've got to ""go big or go home"".",5,2021/01/22
"These pads discharge quite fast with the new features, adaptive triggers etc. So a second pad has become a must. Not much else to say, genuine Sony pad and no defects on the item I received. Definitely think about picking up a second pad even if it's just for yourself as a spare!",5,2021/05/11
"My hubby is delighted to receive his new PS5 controller, just a shame I couldn’t buy a console for him to be able to use it. For the time being it’s an ornament until more consoles are released as they are like hot dust to get a hold of. Sony need to plan their stock more effectively for future releases so both are available.",5,2020/11/21

"I bought this for my pc. Download ds4 windows version 2.1.17 which is the latest. Bluetooth support will be coming soon and run it. plugged it in, windows set it up in a few seconds.

I was unfortunate enough to get a faulty one with loose R2 button and had to waste time going through the trouble of returning it. I'd like to mention it was the original white one.,1,2022/09/30
The new PS5 controller is expensive but is actually a significant step forward in technology. The haptic feedback is different from any previous controller motion gimmick. A second controller for the system is pretty much a necessity. You do feel though that once you buy into the ecosystem Sony will get quite a lot of your money over the years...,5,2021/01/12
"A solid controller, you can feel all the details and textures in whatever type of terrain you walk on. Weather it’s glass or rocks, stones, sand you can even feel the breeze/wind in the game. Especially cool that the haptic feedback pans from each side, it’s very detailed. I’m impressed",5,2021/05/01
"It doesnt come with a usb type c cable but i recharge it with my phone charger so it's fine. I love this controller, as a guy that grew up along playstation this one is the best one by far. Even my old pop loves it.",5,2021/05/20
The usual quality you get from Sony. Feels great in the hand. The new haptics seem to work well. For how long remains to be seen as I’m not sure how much gaming the new internal mechanisms will tolerate. Mine has been well used and still works like new.,5,2021/05/10
Controller works well after receiving it (the original I got with the console lost tension in the left trigger after ~6 months will have to wait and see if the same happens here).,5,2021/08/02
drifts to the left due to left analogue stick dragging,1,2022/11/23

I’m really confused and pretty annoyed. I’d understand if I had it for 5+ years but it’s been less than a year.",2,2022/03/06
"Poor controller doesn't last very long it has a fault where the X button will stop working unless you hold down the middle button with it. Not good enough when spending £60 for a controller.

This has now happened to two of the controls for me the exact same issue when they should be fixed or replaced by Sony due to a known fault",1,2022/08/04
Box had clearly been opened. I really can't be bothered sending it back but it's really disappointing when paying so much for a product.,3,2021/08/27
Have had 3 of these since launch of the console and EVERY ONE of them have had stick drift. How Sony can sell these jokes of a controller at 70 quid I will never know. The controller works fine when it works but will lose traction before you know it.,2,2022/04/13

"What can I say? This tech inside this controller is insane, the touchpad, the responsive triggers, the rumble stuff. It's exactly what you expect from Sony, but still an incredible bit of tech,",5,2021/07/02
"""Used like new"" item from Amazon warehouse was actually damaged.
R2 trigger loose, probably a damaged spring. Was also filthy, covered in black marks or sweat or something. Not Amazon's fault. Just dishonest customer, who has obviously swapped their broken one and returned.
I've sent it to Sony for repair as still under warranty. So no harm done, other than having to wait for them to repair/ replace.",3,2021/02/02
I bought this to try out with iPadOS 14.5 BETA and it’s AMAZING. It works so much better than the PS4 controller and it doesn’t continuously disconnect either. It’s much more comfortable to use and the battery lasts for ages. This is how a gaming controller should be made.,5,2021/03/08
"The PS5 dual sense controllers are and upgrade on the PS4 controllers, comfortable, not too heavy and the haptic feedback is very cool. They look so good too.",5,2021/07/22
"Finally arrived!!

Little impatient but to be fair well worth the wait! Feels really nice in my hands and has some decent weight to the controller especially compared to the previous ps4 controller.

Anyone who buys this will not be disappointed!

Roll on Next week for the release for the ps5!",5,2020/11/12
As an owner of both consoles PS5 and thr XBX SX. I have to say that Sony gotnit right with thr DuelSense controller and Microsoft got it so wrong. When you've got XBX SX gamers wanting features on the DuelSense on their controller you have to ask yourself. Why...,5,2021/01/19
"Other reviews talk about the tech, which is great, but I wanted to say that I used to get pins and needles in my ring and pinky fingers with the Dualshock 4 when playing for a long time, the feeling is much reduced with the Dualsense.",5,2021/03/19
"I have always preferred the xbox controller in the past, but this new controller is truly a step up. Its very comfortable to hold, and all the new features (haptics and stuff) add a new dimension to gaming. Truly next gen stuff, unlike the xbox controller that is old hat now.",5,2020/11/24
The controller is amazing looks real good just poor choice in colour after playing for a couple of hours a lot of grime builds up especially if you got sweaty hands might be better to wait for a different colour version of the remote to be released,5,2021/02/02
"I bought my first PS5 controller in mid-May to use on my PC. After 3 months, the left side joystick was broken (ghost inputs and HUGE joystick drift) even though I had only used it moderately (I only actually used it for one month). Replacement arrived (29th August) and having had moderate usage since then (2.5 months, the right side trigger is broken (no spring resistance). These things are great but they break on their own despite never being dropped.",2,2021/11/10
"This controller is definitely an upgrade to the dualshock. It feels way better in the hands, more of a rested position than feeling like you're holding something. The built in mic works well and the speaker is good. The adaptive triggers are adaptive and the haptic feedback is haptic lol.",5,2020/12/17
Quality item but sold without charging cable,5,2021/10/22
Came broke,1,2022/11/17
Works fine,4,2021/05/06
"I very strongly feel that for the price of the controller, they should really put a USB cable in the box. I can’t think of a single thing you can buy that must be charged to be used that doesn’t have the means to charge it included. And that if it doesn’t it should scream everywhere, all over this page, the box etc, that it doesn’t.",3,2021/01/04
Normally i loath buying a second remote but for once I think the cost is totally justified. The controller is about 75% of the added benefits to the PS5 with the haptic feedback and trigger resistance when firing weapons. It's completely bowled me over at how immersive a remote can be.,5,2020/12/03
"Only dislike was for the amount you pay, it could have a charging cable included.",4,2021/02/22
cant wait to get a ps5,5,2021/10/19
I suppose what's not to love if you are a gaming fan and these are the holy grail and impossible to get so very lucky. My gaming son loves. Its as you would expect a very well made item with extra features a must for gamers.,5,2021/02/08
Complete rubbish. Second-hand faulty stock sold as new. AVOID,1,2022/10/26
i want a chat with amazon to pay for my neighbours wall hes very annoyed about it,4,2021/02/02
"I bought it so I had an extra control and it works well. I have not had any issues with it so far.

Normally with the PS4 controllers there is a slight drift, I have had none of that so far.

Kind of expensive but worth it.

(Update)

My PS5 Controller now has controller drift but it is not like controller drift that you get on the PS4 Controller which is annoying. The drift I get on my PS5 is sudden movements to the left and is unusable the play games. What is more annoying is that I cannot get a hold of SONY to get it fixed or replaced!",2,2021/07/01
"Great , feels better to hold then the PS4 , I used thumb grips on it like i have with the PS4 ones o it lasts longer , MIC button in the middle is a good new feature and I can’t wait to try the hepatic feedback on it.",5,2020/11/12
These new dualsense controllers are a great follow up to the DualShock line of controllers. The extra features are great and are hard to describe without just putting the control in your hands and saying “here have some fun.”,5,2021/04/03
"I've been through 3 controllers, I have never dropped or physically damaged the controller in anyway. The first 2 controllers had the L2/R2 springs snap inside them (which is a very common issue). I don't know why Sony has not released the V2 version with fixed springs and analogs.

The 2nd controller had analog issues with stick drift, and now the 3rd controller is the same after a year of use. PS4 controller was built like a brick which never had any issues, PS5 controllers are such poor quality that I'm assuming they're built like this to earn them more money - which is why they don't release an improved version.

If you can handle the Xbox layout, go with it. I'm forced to stick with PS because of using the layout my whole life.",1,2022/01/06
"most certainly next gen been a pc gamer last couple of years and this controller spells next gen in many ways
very comfy with along haptic feedback giving gamers a feel for the game

looking forward to all the new games coming out with this tech",5,2020/11/25
Good battery life and good for the PS4 if you have the Magic S Pro USB adapter. However it sometimes runs out quickly. Be aware of that but still 5 stars.,5,2021/05/27
"Dog ate the last one, the replacement was necessary",5,2021/09/23
Dare I say it 1 of the best controllers ever made yes thats right the triggers on them are a game changer they really are i promise u no other console will ever beat the duelsense im telling u now it makes things so real,5,2020/11/19
Best thing since the N64 controller. I always used a pro control as my hands were to big for the old one especially for games like fifa. This one is fine and it actually lives up to the hype. It is actually brilliant,5,2020/12/19
"i have bought 3 controllers from amazon all of them have ended up with epic controller drift on the left stick and no matter what guides you follow to fix, nothing ever works!! and have recently found out that these joypads are made to fail within a month or two .. if your joypad has a no1 where i have circled then it is defective made with cheap parts ... if however the joypad had the letter A where the one is you have a good one ... its a well know fault with these joypads be warned",1,2022/04/15
"It means we always have a handset charged, and I like that it plugs into the mains rather than sub.",5,2021/07/25
"This is one hell of a controller!! Engineering brillance! Comfort, style and function. Best controller in the market and will change gaming forever! Only negative is the PS button I find myself pressing the mic mute button, hopefully i get use to this",5,2020/11/27
"Can anyone explain to me why when this controller is off, and you press L1 and R1 buttons it feels like a spring is broke inside and it vibrates the controller as you hold it, not the vibration like in games, this vibration is in our physical world and it only occurs with L1 and R1 buttons it feels cheap and or broken.

I gave 1 star also based on the fact I prefer ps4 controller than ps5

PS5-
1: its bigger than ps4
2: It's heavier and has geater wrist strain on long hours of gameplay
3: L1 and R1 buttons feel cheap or broken
4: the D-pad hurts my fingers because of the way its designed, I thought they would fix that from the ps4 model.
5: buttons Square X triangle and O seem too low and don't feel as satisfying as the ps4 one
6: The built in mic might be breaching privacy issues when Sony can listen to you even if you turn it off, there is no proof they are or aren't mic should always be built in headsets not controllers.
7: Battery didn't last as long as I thought it would but when you have everything on it turned on mic haptic feedback and you be lucky to get more than 4 hours straight with intense gaming.",1,2020/11/21
Brilliant!! Got this for my boyfriend and he is delighted with it. The controller is INSANE! The sensitivity and the vibrations on the controller are made to perfection and it baffles me how something this amazing can be made!!,5,2021/01/07
"Feels larger in the hand than the PS4 controller, which up until now, has been the best video game controller ever. I think the PS5 controller takes the cake.

Requires a software update on setup.",5,2021/04/03
Technically not wireless as it comes with a charging cable 🤷🏻,4,2021/02/04
Feels great. A lot better than the PS4 controllers,5,2021/08/31
"Spare PS5 controller, genuine controller always handy to have a spare nothing worse than being mid game an your controller goes flat, love the design of these to the PS4 controllers as these are nicer to hold",5,2021/02/12
"The controller is a very nice piece of equipment in terms of feel and usage, however this is now my third controller I have had due to the right hand side lower shoulder button failing. This one only managed about 3 weeks. Amazon have been very helpful and replaced each one with no fuss, but I feel Sony should have fixed this by now. I understand it is a small spring that fails and you can get them off Ebay and fix it yourself, but my view is at nearly £60 it should be designed and built right. I will just keep sending them back until Sony supply something that is fit for purpose.",2,2021/04/12
The pad was fine but the box it came is was dirty with oily finger prints. Normally I’d let that go but I think while Covid is around hygiene should be at a higher standard,3,2021/03/31
"All in the title, box looked roughed up, but mainly the controller was clearly second hand.",1,2022/09/18
If you can afford this over the PS4 controller then I’d recommend it. Way better and superior. Besides the PS4 market is filled with reviews of fake controllers. Overall really good.,5,2021/04/03
Solid build quality that makes the dualshock 4 feel flimsy. Feels great in the hands. Haptics and adaptive triggers are better than expected added with the native support on steam makes it one of the best controllers i've ever had.,5,2020/11/22
"I don't actually have a PS5 (yet, anyway). I am looking for a BT controller that is suitable for Android gaming. The controller does not feel too bad but I prefer the feel of the Xbox One controller. The DualSense does not seem to have very good compatibilty for Android yet.",3,2020/12/30
"This is the second controller I have had, the original one that came with the ps5, well that lasted about 5 weeks of minimal use as only use weekend as work nights, first one all the buttons apart form the square button all just started sticking and nothing has been spilt on it its still as is from new, so I bought another one and this one the buttons seem OK but the stick drift on the right analogue stick is getting worse , I won't buy another one I want a replacement",2,2021/07/16
To say its supposed to be 2nd hand theres not a scratch or blemish on it as far as I can tell. Pity I havent been able to get a PS5 to test it on,5,2021/01/31
What can I say it’s a ps5 joypad and because it’s Sony it’s expensive for what you get and as with all past joypads no charger cable,5,2021/05/11
The best controller ever made.,5,2021/09/06

"Way more comfortable than the old controller. I actually use this with my PC and it works great with steam. Although it doesn't seem to work yet with PS Now on PC, so be wary of that before buying.",5,2020/12/03
"This controller is excellent. I really like the haptic feedback.
Hopefully a lot of developers will make use of it!
I've always preferred the Xbox controllers. Not so sure now!",5,2021/04/18
Sound as a pound👊,4,2021/02/19
I like the product but I’m here to tell people that if you buy a PlayStation controller whether it’s PS4 or PS5 it doesn’t come with a charging cable because you get one with the console.,5,2020/12/19
Top notch controller,5,2021/09/03
"Just got mine bit heavier than the ps4 controller, feels nice in the hand, looks like a darker grey then a white. You do not get a USB-C cable with it so keep that in mind",5,2020/11/12

Amazing product however my right trigger broke after a week of use. Constant clicking as well as broken haptics. Would absolutely be 5 stars without reliability issues.,3,2021/04/09
"Firstly the dualsense is a great controller, weighty and the haptic features are great but I'm now sat with 2 out of 3 pads that have stick drift!! After reading up and seeing an ifixit teardown the dualsense is using the same sticks as previous iterations and will suffer the same fate. Sony are facing a lawsuit for it but still sell ""new"" controllers with basically a different colour shell. Expect to wait 3 or 4 weeks for sony to fix any stick drift only for that replacement to suffer eventually anyway! Love the ps5, love the new games we're getting and I love the dualsense but this is laughable really. £180 to have 1 pad that will inevitably have stick drift *watch the ifixit video on YouTube to see how problematic the dualsense is and always will be.",1,2021/10/14
The best game controller ever. It is as close to the concept as possible. Sony pulled off a coup on this one. It is a game changer,5,2021/04/13
"Time will tell on things like battery and so on, but at launch this is a fantastic controller. Feels better in the hand than a DualShock4, and the new features are all great.",5,2020/11/26
X and the big face buttons both stick and the black plate isn't on the front fitted properly. I believe this item was resold despite me paying the full price for a brand new controller.,1,2022/07/21
Great gift and great quality,5,2021/08/15
"Update:

So now my third controller gave in. Another broken R2. Sending it back again.

So this is my third controller so far.
1st one R2 button failed so sent it back for service. Pretty annoying and well known problem, so not sure why Sony is not sorting it.
2nd controller bought ad a backup. Within a month the X button failed. Sent it back to Amazon to change it. Lucky I was within 30 days.

Pretty crap quality for the price we are paying.",2,2021/06/27
"I purchased PlayStation 5 and got extra controller from Amazon. I had to return the controller because the X button got clicky and started to stick. Overall I’m not impressed with the build quality but it’s not like you have much choice.

Now I’ve been playing with the replacement controller and X button is starting to wear out again. I would think it’s due to the design being new and it will go through some iterations before being fully solid.

Amazon was amazing about the returns: I sent the controller back describing the issue and received a brand new one.",2,2021/03/10
It took a while but we finally made it. Pricy but worth it.,5,2021/06/27
"It feels great in your hands, solid, great material, battery life of around 8 hours.

Stronger microphone than previous-gen controller, L3 button touch pad works better too",5,2021/03/14
"Really disappointed, worst controller I've ever had. Ridges on the colour change area just where you hold it. The handle bits are too thin as well to hold comfortablely. I guess it will depend on your hand size if the above points are a problem. I don't like the level if roughness on the underside. On all these points the ps4 controller is better. It's also heavier. And at 60 quid they don't even give you are charging cable. I'm interested to try the vibration stuff once ps5 turns up tomorrow, but suspect that will just be an annoyance to turn off after 5 minutes.",2,2020/11/18
Such a lovely design and it holds battery so much longer than previous generations. Always recommend a spare controller but it doesn’t take long to charge.,5,2021/03/16
Great controller to use bit after playing games with it fairly irregularly I now have a stick drift issue on the left analogue stick making some games unplayable and reverting back to a 9 year old DS4 controller which works perfectly. Will not purchase one of these controllers again. Cheap crappy design and not durable,1,2022/06/14

Arrived today - Be aware that it requires a USB-C cable to recharge and this does not come in the standalone controller box.",5,2020/11/12
Takes a bit of getting used to at the beginning because it might feel a but stiff. Feels much more spaced out and easier to hold than the ps4 controller.,5,2021/01/17
"How can I contact seller? It won’t let me find the option. Extremely dissapointed in this purchase. Bought this in March as a gift to sent to my brother in Venezuela! Absolutely disgusted that I paid for a NEW item and was sent a dirty broken used controller. Joystick gets stuck and sinks, theres dirt where the controller gets held. Would not recommend. Avoid at all costs.",1,2022/05/09
Love the controller the quality compared to the PS4 seems a lot better only complaint is that it’s a bit of a pain to set up on pc but that should be sorted soon,5,2020/11/14
"This is the second PS5 controller, the first was with the PS5 which developed drift after about 6 weeks so I replaced it with another and after less than 2 months the right trigger have broken, I am very disappointed especially after waiting so long to get a PS5 … Should have stayed with the Xbox.
Update,
Amazon are very kindly replacing this so hopefully third time lucky.",2,2021/09/24

Controler has a really good weight and feel to it and the trigger feedback is good enchances the game experience. The downfall of the controler is stick drift (you contine to move without touching controller). Bought this as a second controler and both are suffering with drift after 6 monts use. Now have to take up with Sony. At £60 it does not represent value for money whist this drift issue exists. Check the net thetes plenty of info out there on it.,2,2021/06/12

"We purchased a DualSense as a replacement gift for our eight year old nephew after his first broke.

Unfortunately, the same thing has happened with the replacement, on the same day it arrived. Exactly the same issue, an R2 trigger failure.

Due to the lack of games he's able to play on the PS5, he's been playing his back catalogue of PS4 games and I play with him.

However, the R2 trigger is very poor and weak. It's no coincidence that the R2 trigger on TWO DualSense controllers has failed. Far too much travel, no resistance when pressure applied.

This needs to be addressed by Sony as I've since read of it being a persistent problem on other websites since experiencing the issue.

We've now purchased a new DualShoock 4 for PS4 games only for our nephew to use on his PS5. We know the DS4 to be far more robust.",1,2021/01/30

"Great controller so easy to use, nice and light too, the feel of them are so nice thank you xx",5,2021/01/01
"This is the second DualSense I've used and the first one I've bought seperately as the first one came with the PS5.

Both have gone the same way as in the R2 trigger basically giving up all resistance when being pressed, something which defeats the purpose of the haptic system entirely.

I wouldn't mind but I had to shell out £450 for the console itself at launch with a controller included and then when that went I had to fork out £60 for a new DualSense.

When the DualSense works and isn't broken it's a great controller probably the best I've ever used but the way these keep breaking doesn't justify £60. It feels more like cheap Chinese tat than it does a premium next gen game controller.

Buyer beware!!!",1,2021/05/29
"Very good and fast response from seller, well packaged and functional in every respect",5,2021/03/10
Started to stick drift after a 2 month of use,1,2022/08/13
As described I would recommend and quick delivery 👍🏽,5,2021/05/09
"Haptic feedback is much better than I was expecting, especially after years of rumble on the PS4 controller this truly feels next gen!",5,2020/11/20

It's a PS5 dual sense controller! It's let's u play on your PS5 and works as expected!,5,2020/12/27
"The controller design itself I really like. It feels nice and weighty, feels like quality. BUT it has a major flaw in that the thumb sticks are prone to drift. Bought one used from Amazon but had to return as the right thumb stick was drifting occasionally, an issue I knew was only going to get worse.",2,2021/08/19
It’s the official controller what more do you want!,5,2021/04/28
"Very nice quality feel, if inly i could get my hands on a ps5 i could use it! Lol",5,2020/12/04

Absolutely good controller feels great to hold.,5,2021/04/09
I am very happy with my purchase. Thanks,5,2021/03/29
"The item was perfect ps5 controller, but within 10 minutes of use, the dreaded drift had reoccurred. I dont think this will ever go away due to Playstation not addressing the issue. Buy at your peril, i probably would not buy a ps5 if i had know this would be an issue.",2,2021/08/29
its is a very good extra for any one with a ps5. great prices from amazon,5,2020/12/18

feels good in the hands but let down with build quality issues.,3,2021/03/10
"Play Video
 The controller, like the DS4, will become completely unusable after several months if you play a game which uses the sticks a lot. As a rocket league player, having the stick inputs moving randomly makes the game impossible especially at a high level. I understand most players arent going to use the sticks as much as i do but theres no alternative products and this does not meet my demands. Theres so many features i have to pay for that i dont need, like lights a touchpad a mic and adaptive triggers etc. I cant afford to keep replacing these i need a cheap alternative or they need to make this expensive controller durable enough to last a few years.
Attatched a video demonstrating how the left stick input moves randomly and the right stick moves smoothly and normally.

TLDR - Controller too expensive to break this easily",1,2021/07/21
What a fantastic upgrade and improvement. World's apart for userbility comfort compared to the previous generation. Brilliant design.,5,2020/11/18
"I am extremely busy and have not had time to use it very much, I tried to and it worked but after a couple of weeks it stopped connecting, because I don’t use it regularly I missed the return window.",1,2022/05/10
great product,5,2021/06/09
"It’s a comfortable controller, haptic feed back is really good",5,2021/02/14
"I got this replacement as one of my PS5 controllers is suffering from stick drift, but this controller would not connect to the console at all or even charge.

The lights would flash when connected via USB, but nothing else and a few of the buttons are very stiff and if I didn’t purchase it directly from Amazon I would presume it was a copy, as the buttons just felt wrong!",1,2022/01/16

Excellent product will done Sony can’t wIt to try more games with this,5,2020/12/14
Very quick delivery & excellent quality. This is an awesome controller.,5,2021/01/06
"Sony hyped up this controller with the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers but apart from that the controller is a terrible piece of hardware. I've gone through two controllers now both with different problems. First one succumbed to stick drift and after doing some research it seems the PS5 controller has around 400 hours of life and after that it has a chance of getting stick drift which mine did. The second one now has a faulty spring resulting in the left trigger now being completely unresponsive. For the price these are being sold for you'd expect decent quality but no its far from it, 1 star is the lowest rating you can give but thats being generous",1,2021/06/19
"Brilliant product, loving the new designed controller delivery was really quick, highly recommend",5,2020/12/11
Can't test as it's no ps5 to buy. And this controller does not support PS4. Really should make compatable.,3,2020/12/27

"Decided to upgrade from a xbox 360 controller for my PC after having numerous pads develop analogue drift, the ps5 pad seemed better but 2 months after purchase and it has drift, worse i must say than the 360 pads had. Almost as if it's saying switch to mouse and keyboard.",1,2022/03/02

The r2 button is broke its line the spring inside has came away or bent,3,2021/01/05
After buying this almost a year ago. It has now stopped charging . Tried many cables and sockets to see if that was the problem but it was not. This problem started showing up roughly September 2021 where it’ll stop charging half way . Now it just does not charge at all.,1,2022/02/14
Great controller! Bought as a second one for the console.,5,2020/12/07
Very good,5,2021/05/07
"My PS5 controller suddenly stopped working after a few months. I tried every suggestion on the PlayStation website, but none of them was successful. The DualSense controller isn't getting any power. I bought and tried the PS5 charging station and the new USB cables, but they didn't work. I've been trying to get RMA and send the faulty controller to be repaired but Playstation customer service is unavailable.",1,2021/12/20
Great quality connected very easily,5,2021/03/07
"This is quite simply Sonys most BADLY made controller to date in terms of build quality, absolutely shocking, both the triggers will need constant maintenance in terms of replacing the springs inside. It needs a V2 made with springs that actually last instead of them falling out of place every month.

ORIGINAL REVIEW - The controller is fantastic in almost every aspect, and that one aspect is sticking shoulder triggers. My R2 button after a few weeks of heavy use has started to get stuck halfway pressed, currently it remedies itself by pressing it several more times until the position resets. This seems to possibly be a design flaw with the springs on each L2/R2 trigger so be careful on how you use them.",1,2020/12/05
All good,5,2021/05/03
Great thank you 😊,5,2021/03/08
"The controller is excellent (the best I’ve ever used), until it breaks. There are two known issues that are well-documented on the Internet: a stick-drift issue and an issue with R1 and R2 buttons breaking. I’ve had to return 3 controllers in five months since my R2 button keeps breaking. I’ve noticed that Sony have just released a new version of the controller with a slightly different model number so I’m now hoping that the issue have been addressed.",1,2021/11/05
My son likes it,5,2021/03/15
Best controller ever. So comfortable. Build quality is top.,5,2020/11/15

Cool,5,2021/03/31
"They look and feel amazing. But the quality of the build is abysmal. Stick drift ruins the ability to play. And there always seems to be something wrong with some aspect of it otherwise.
Sony really need to rethink the way they manufacture these. The price demands better quality.
Hopefully third party controllers will be better.",2,2021/05/06

One of the buttons keep sticking so I contacted Amazon who told me to speak with Sony as still in warranty and am yet to get through to Sony after months of trying!! Very poor service from Sony and Amazon!,1,2022/01/27
Great product,5,2021/01/15
The best controller ever,5,2020/11/17
Don’t be silly like me and buy this thinking it could be used on the PS4 too. I have a ps5 but I was optimistic. Oh well still a great controller.,2,2021/08/07

"The controller posted to me is a defective model that has the infamous left anolog stick drift. I only used the controller for a few days before noticing the issue, which I immediately recognized as the stick drift defect that has plagued many. The DualSense is the best video game controller ever designed by Sony and far superior to the DualShock 4. But with a defective version of the controller posted to me, I can't recommend this product.",1,2021/08/09

"Delivery was late and when the package actually arrived the ps5 controller box had been opened! Charging wire doesn’t come with, controller looks fine no scratches but haven’t tried syncing it to ps5. Overall disappointed as this cost me £60!!!",2,2021/05/17
The controller is faulty . No wonder why its been sold . Will be returning item tomorrow,1,2022/04/12
"R2 button oversensitive due to loose spring rendering it unusable. Arrived without protection in the box covered in dust, not even wrapped in paper. Built-in battery means that when it runs out and you want to keep playing, it's not wireless anymore (as opposed to 2 AA batteries in an Xbox controller). Charging cable too expensive to be included in the box! Also, I don't like the convex shape of the sticks which make your thumbs slip easier than from a concave-type Xbox sticks.",1,2021/04/02
"Item came on time, all going well. When I opened package the box to the controller looked tampered with, where the seal was not fully sealed down. All seemed fine inside the box, so I charged it up. When I connected it it went crazy, scrolling around by itself. I reset it and installed again, got to starting to play and the controller was going mad by itself. I have sent it back and bought one in Asda where I can check the box before buying.",1,2021/02/21
"No charging cable? For a £60 controller? Sony taking the piss with that. Yes as a controller it’s fine, but to not include a charging cable when they cost so much it wrong.",2,2021/06/05
"It's the best controller I've ever used however, within a few days it got stick drift ( the sticks controls moves the character or camera without any input by you ) which is really annoying, thing is amazon won't give me a replacement, only a exchange for a different item or a refund....",2,2020/11/30
Compatibility with other devices like Windows and Mac is not great compare to Xbox's. That's why I had to return it.,2,2021/08/10
"Ordered from Warehouse with product listed as “very good” condition. This isn’t the case, the item doesn’t function at all with severe stick drift and random buttons being triggered. Don’t recommend",1,2022/01/23
As title states the triggers have broke already after only 6 months. R2 trigger is extremely loose and doesn’t work with ratchet and clank rift apart which is such a shame,2,2021/06/13
"Most people will have seen the media about drifting, but the shooter buttons also are really bad. They've designed the controllers to have multiple fancy functions, but the quality is just ridiculous. The one i'm using just broke after 2 weeks!! The R2 button just gave up. They should concentrate their efforts on quality first instead of ripping us off with high turn over. I've had an Xbox controller on my PC for 2 years and still going good.",1,2021/03/05
Product box was extremely damaged and when I used the controller the left analog stick started moving itself,1,2022/03/17

"One trigger button was slightly higher than others on arrival. Within an hour, the button was unusable as it kept sticking. Great service from Amazon on returning and the refund was issued once the item was received back. Very inconvenient though as I had to go out to buy another one from somewhere else on the day. Sony need to address this as I’ve heard it is a major issue with the new controllers.",1,2021/02/20
I have ordered two of these controllers recently and both were faulty? Does Sony have an issue with the Batteries in these?,1,2022/02/16
You'll be shilling out £50+ very regularly to replace these god awful drift doomed controllers. Things don't even last a year.,1,2022/02/18
"Controller suffers from stick drift, Amazon return window closed so have to deal with Sony direct.
Dealing with Sony is a nightmare. therfore I recommend you purcgase from a bricks & mortar store so you can physically return it.

left stick drift after barely month of use. makes games unplayable as characters can't move right,1,2022/02/27
"It is original product. All functions are working fine, the battery life is also good. Nothing to complain about. It is a bit more massive than the previous version (PS4) but it feels very handy for me.",5,2022/09/19

Total waste of money 3 months old now unusable continuous movement in both analog sticks when not in use not covered by returns policy,1,2022/01/04
So the left stick started drifting to the left after about 4 weeks. I play rocket league on PC with it and it makes the game unplayable when you're holding the stick to the right and your car keeps turning left. And there is no option on amazon to return the damn thing so I have to go through the awful sony support. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS.,1,2021/03/22
"Didn't use much, joysticks started to drift and cannot use, waste of money",1,2022/02/28
Already need to buy a new one however my first controller that I got with the Ps5 lasted since I got it through all lockdown when I was playing non stop yet this one has worn down in a few months and I haven’t played it anywhere near as much. Not happy considering the cost.,1,2021/07/01
"These controllers have not been rigorously tested. The springs in the trigger fail as they do not appear to work very well with the haptic feedback function.
Mine has broken after 4/5 months light use. Really not good at all at £60 for a controller.

"had to return 2 of these, first one x button was sticking and second the analogues clicked when moving left to right. waiting on the third one now so hopefully be able to change the rating as the pads are really good just full of faults. pad i got with the playstation works fine just seems to be the extra ones bought have had faults.",1,2021/01/28

"Well upon only having for such a short time the r2 button breaks, this is due to the small thin spring that is inside giving it the haptic tension snapping thru pressing and might I add not pressing by force either. In a nutshell the pa4 controller wins over the ps5 as still have the original from 10 years but with ps5 controllers these need replaced within the year.",1,2020/12/13
The L2 trigger is very loose less than one week after using the controller. I have another one which is perfectly fine but the one I bought from Amazon is giving me troubles while playing as it presses itself without me touching it even though I haven’t played games that require the use of that. Very dissatisfied with this Amazon!,1,2021/02/06

"Dissapointing launch issues with these controllers. Drift on analogue sticks. Replacement also had similar drift issues. In fact it was much worse. Now I have to contact Sony. 40 minutes on phone to them, the call disconnected and I had to call again. Then the lines closed. I will just throw the controller in the bin.",1,2021/04/01

If you're a PC gamer get this controller. With the state of controllers right now with xbox elites having constant issues and licencee xbox controllers being shoddily made I can't recommend a better controller. The Duelsense is more comfortable made with better materials and overall feels a lot more expensive than it is. works fine with steam and almost any game can be imported into your steam library. Also tested on Gamepass and works there as well.,5,2022/03/10

The second original one developed stick drift in left stick after four months, Sony replaced it. Less than a year later, one of the replacements developed stick drift in the right stick, but the warranty has expired and none of the simple fixes have worked. Three broken controllers in 18 months. Edit: two weeks later, fourth controller has a loose/sensitive R2 trigger. Absolutely ridiculous. I'll be seriously considering an XBox next time.",2,2022/05/18
"I don't own a console.
This works on PC really well.
Some games support the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Not many, yet, but I hope they add more because it is very good to feel resistance on the trigger.",5,2021/12/30
"This is a good controller with a lot of cool features and a nice design. However after having it for a few months the issues have become clear. Its battery life is terrible.. without a charging stand it will die almost every time you try to play a game. On ps5 exclusive games it's honestly amazing, the haptic feedback is great and small improvements like the built in microphone with mute is great to have. But most games can't use these features so it just drains battery life with no real upside besides from the design itself. As this doesnt work with ps4 and the limited ps5 consoles atm I cant give it a higher rating. Although once these features are more established it can be amazing. But the battery life is something to be vary of in the ling term",3,2021/05/06
"I imagine you get better experiences with this on a PS5. Because it’s practically impossible to get a PS5 and apparently dual sense features are planned to be added to PC versions of PS5 games later (Like Horizon 2 etc.) I decided to get it as a PC controller.

You can customise it through Steam just like the DualShock 4, being able to change the lighting on the controller too like in the pic, and for the most part it works just like a standard controller.

My main reason for saying it’s not great as a PC controller though are:

A) the battery in the controller is awful - I’ll get 4-5 hours out of the controller when connected via Bluetooth tops.

B) it doesn’t charge properly: if I leave it plugged in it will just remain on charge in perpetuity. Plugging it in to a battery doctor shows that it’s drawing 0.1A constantly even when it’s switched off. This also means if you turn it off and leave it for a few days off charge it will be dead when you try to switch it on again. I don’t know if it needs a firmware update via a PS5 but you can’t do one via PC.
C) Steam can really get angry with the controller and crash itself - sometimes the controller will connect to the PC but steam won’t detect it and apply xinput to games. The only way to deal with this is completely rebooting the PC, if you don’t if you attempt to turn the controller off Steam will crash, rebooting steam at this point just stops steam detecting the controller, even though windows can see it and read inputs.

In summary, if you’re after a PC controller I wouldn’t get one of these. The frustrating part for me is the poor battery life, which is somehow worse than the DualShock 4. In contrast I used an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller and it didn’t run out of charge for 2 weeks. But I guess it depends on if you would be comfortable paying that kind of money.

Either way: there’s plenty of other controllers out there that are better for PC gaming right now.",2,2021/07/24
"shelled out £500 back in late May 2021 for a new PS5 from Currys.

Mid - late June 2022, im experiencing stick drift!

Weird movement on during rocket league and random, erratic car movements in GTA V.

Surely this should last more than a year? (I was away from the UK for 4 weeks too, so approx 11months usage!)

Absolute dire - do the new controllers (midnight black) suffer from it too? I guess always wait a year before buying a new console.",1,2022/06/28

 Sony is currently dealing with a class action lawsuit against faulty PS5 controllers and the law firm is looking for free replacements.
Sony's PlayStation 5 (PS5) is in a bit of trouble. There have been multiple reports about the DulaSense controller, that comes with the PS5, reporting some serious rocker drift issues. According to players, the DualSense controller has a stick drift problem and while Sony has an update to fix it, many are reporting that the issue is persisting despite the update.

Sony is also grappling with a class action lawsuit regarding this and the law firm suing Sony is looking for free replacements of faulty devices.

A drift issue in a controller makes game characters move without command and can also change camera angles leading to disruptions in the game.
However, the problem here seems to be a hardware one and not a software one that can be fixed with an OTA update. According to iFixit, who disassembled the DualSense controller, the drift issue could have links to four parameters - sensor wear, spring fatigue, material stretching and junk like moisture and dust.
According to Alps, the PS5 joystick makers, the operating life for the RKJXV’s potentiometers is 2,000,000 cycles”. A professional calculation by iFixit shows that a gamer can hit 2,000,000 in about four to seven months. This could cause wear and tear of the potentiometer in the controller and as a result, the joystick may slightly deviate from the center point, which gamers call a “drift”.

Additionally, the wearing of the spring inside the joystick lead to the joystick being unable to reset and the plastic material detoriates over time which could lead to just and other junk accumulating. This, in turn, can cause inaccurate position feedback or “drift” problems.

Therefore, the only way to solve this issue is to replace the controller. Players have tried to restart the Bluetooth, restart the PS5 and reset the DualSense controller to fix the drift but it has not worked. And a software update isn't going to help either.",1,2021/02/22
Excellent spare Sony PS5 controller that matches my existing one. Perfect service from Amazon with delivery and packaging,5,2021/07/21
"Great controller whilst it lasts, haptic feedback is good, similar to hd rumble on the switch. Adaptive triggers are very fun and immersive although can be quite noisy if playing in a quiet environment.

However longevity is a concern, the spring under the right trigger failed on me today, still usable but the trigger has little/no resistance. Seems others are experiencing the same issue. Hopefully it's a defective set of springs rather than a widespread issue...",3,2020/12/24
"Had the controller for about a month and it already has horrendous stick drift. The controller itself feels sturdy and nice to use otherwise, more so than the PS4 controller.",3,2021/04/19
I bought my ps5 a little over a year ago. The controller has started getting stuck drift recently making it unusable. Given it’s over a year I have to buy a new one at £60! It’s such a joke and a terribly made product. Three of my friends have had hen exact same issue.,1,2022/04/13
Massive upgrade over the DS4 and it’s much more comfortable….and on every ps5 product there is poor reviews just ignore them as they are left by sad xbox fanboys trying to make Sony look bad…,5,2021/06/14
"The DuelSense is one of the best PlayStation controller I’ve ever experience. The design is similar to the PS4s Duelshock 4, but they’ve managed to up the comfort level ten fold. When I first heard of the Adaptive Triggers feature I thought it was another gimmick, but I was wrong about this. The triggers gain resistance depending on the situation your in, and feel totally realistic and you can tell this is a next generation controller. The vibration has been also been improved and feels more responsive then ever.

The PlayStation 5 comes pre-installed with Astro’s Playroom, this game demonstrates all the new PS5 + DuelSense Controller features, and it’s mind blowing. With all these extra features it definitely does tank the battery, I played roughly for 13-15 hours before I had to put it on charge. If you play normally when you get home from work or a busy day, I’ll say 1-2 charges a week. Not that bad for a fully featured controller.

My experience with the DuelSense has been nothing but amazing, and definitely blows the Xbox elite out the water and this Is just the standard out the box PlayStation 5 Controller. I’ll be happily to pay the price if mine gets broken or damaged.",5,2020/11/23
As expected brand new,5,2021/05/16
"The charging cable IS in the box lol. Awesome controllers, the duel sense takes a little while to get used to but amazing. For those saying they don't send a charging cable, they do. It's in the box. It looks like part of the packaging but lift it open and you shall find a charging lead. I very almost thought the same thing.",5,2021/03/02
This controller is a thing of beauty but I’ve dropped a star as is an absolute joke you are charging this amount for a controller without even providing the means to charge it.,4,2020/11/13
"I have to admit at this moment in time the controller of the PS5 is impressing me more than the console itself (which I have encountered a few bugs with).

This is the first time in my gaming life where I can say I would happily recommend someone to pay RRP for a controller - everything from the technology to the design and feel oozes premium quality. The tech (particularly the adapting triggers) feel strange at first, but definitely add a new element to gaming.

I have the Xbox Series X too and the X's controller feels SO cheap in comparison and something I couldn't even recommend someone spending £40 (pics attached in case I get accused of being a fanboy). I'd even argue it's on par - and in some way like feel - better than my Elite Controller (although I haven't tried the Elite 2).

Of course it's hard to say if we'll have any issues with the new tech (in particular the adaptive triggers), but for now its a 5* from me - massive well done Sony!",5,2020/11/21
"There are 2 next gen consoles, but only 1 next gen controller.. And this is it. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are on the next level and nothing you have experienced before. Once you use this controller you will never want to go back to a ps4 or xbox controller. Next gen starts with the ps5 for a all round next gen feel. Just charge and play. Unlike the new new xbox controller that still needs AAs.. In 2020. I'm sorry but the ps5 controller alone will just blow you alway",5,2020/11/20
"Listen when you buy a ps5 you get a lead to charge pad and if you buy a spare pad you don't get a wire simple as you have one. So stop crying like babies you can only only use 1 pad at a time 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

By the way the pad is awesome best experience is Wrc 9 so far",5,2020/12/18
Ha only 4 reviews atm - controller is good but the price tag isn't :),4,2020/11/13

Dualsense is miles ahead of the competition!,5,2020/12/18
Amazing next gen tech,5,2020/12/06
"After buying the console at launch the dualsense controller is already starting to break, the R2 has already become very loose and eveytime it sits it slightly triggers and the game responds or fast forwards videos, this controller is great but the parts for the trigger are weak, it's still functioning but will be getting it replaced or returned already after 5 months, my old dualshock 4 from the launch ps4 is still great while a newer DS4 has a drift from day one.
The new controller are built worse than previous versions and this issue is also effecting switches (drift con) and xbox controller's. This needs to be looked into and warranty should be extended.",2,2021/04/15
Love the product but it is flawed. Never had a problem with the one ps4 controller I own since launch. This one has developed terrible left analogue stick drift within 6 months. I hope Sony invest to fix this. At £50-£60 a controller the product should be better.,1,2021/11/07
"Coming from the disabled gamer point-of-view (I am paralysed from the neck down and can only do things using my head and a chopstick in my mouth), I think the box for the PS5 controller is easy to get into.
I would have liked to have seen a carry case that the controller comes in (something like what you get with the Xbox Elite Controller, but maybe this could be added in future.
As far as the design of the controller goes, I think it’s a bit difficult for me to use as the sticks are too low down, and it can’t stick to any of my clamps that easily to help me with gaming. I would also like to see PlayStation release an Adaptive Controller in future, as that would be enough for me to buy one.",1,2021/04/05
"My ps5 came with this controller, features are amazing, but the x button sticks in the controller for almost half a second and then pops back up, this has been happening since I got my ps5 and I am not able to contact seller since sony told me to contact seller so now I am stuck with a really nice controller with an uncomfortable button which gets stuck. I'm calling Sony now to see if I can fix the issue but I just hope I can get a replacement.",2,2020/11/26
"Stick drift after 10 hours. Playstation has to sort their controllers out I went through about 5 with the ps4 all of them were stick drift and already on my second one with ps5. I had ONE xbox controller for the 4 years I had my xbox one, sort it out Sony.",1,2021/05/21
The controller feels great in your hands but the life span of them are absolutely dreadful I had a PS4 controller it lasted me nearly 2 years without anything going wrong I've had a PS5 since releas and it's already got stick drift I'm not happy,1,2021/06/12

Working perfect fast delivery,5,2021/03/18
"It really is. The feedback you get from the games played on this is amazing.

If you are debating whether you should get a second controller - don’t. Even though the battery life is better than the DualShock 4 (or that’s what I’ve experienced), it would be useful to have another one as a backup or even for local co-op games.",5,2020/11/25
Very pleased with the product and the service,5,2021/05/04
"There was a lot to look forward to when the next generation of games consoles hit the market. In the lead up to release we saw some impressive games and hardware. The DualSense controller was amongst these reveals, but I feel like ether I missed it, or not a whole lot of emphasis was placed on what it meant to be going from DualShock 4, to DualSense 5 controller.

I'm not going to be able to fully convey what it's like when the DS5 controller hits you with that ""whaaaat the?"" moment, but if I had to compare it to something else, I'm thinking of something like pinch to zoom when that came out on phones. Reaching to your screen like you're pinching and pulling a piece of paper in a virtual world, it makes you feel so connected. The DS5 isn't just a controller any more, it feels like a receiver. You're playing the game, and the game is giving you meaningful tactile information back through your hands. You WILL stop and take notice for a moment as you play your first PS5 game (make it Astro's Playroom), and if you're anything like me, you'll wonder how you've gone all these years without it.

The haptic feedback has so much depth to it. You could close your eyes and run through an open area within a game, and the controller would be giving you enough feedback that you could tell just from that if you were running on grass, sand, glass or metal.

The triggers can created points of tension, making it more or less difficult to pull them depending on what you're doing. The triggers can also apply outward force to push your finger back out, providing even more feedback to what's going on in the game.

Over all, the controller has had many other improvements that you would generally hope for too. Improved shape for more comfort. Better touch pad. Better placement of the share and options buttons. Dedicated mute button for the built in microphone. Smoother, less squishy triggers. Improved grip on the controller and analogue sticks.

Each generation of console that's came along has provided similar advances over the previous generation. Better graphics, more features, etc etc. The controller is something that's remained mostly the same, with small iterative improvements over the years. The DS5 is a big step forward in opening up new ways of experiencing and interacting with your games. Along with the usually iterative improvements and changes, it's been given a whole new way to let you feel the world you're interacting with, and if developers put it to good use, new ways of challenging and exciting players for years to come.

There's a next gen PlayStation, there's a next gen Xbox, there's even a KFConsole! There is only 1 next gen controller out there, and it's the DS5.",5,2020/12/29
Everything ok!!!!!!!!!,5,2020/11/20
"The controller is amazing, feels sturdy and premium! Very annoyed it doesn't come with any cables, that's really cheap and poor.",4,2020/11/12
Works fine hope I don't start getting stick drift,5,2021/03/07
These controllers are a massive step up from the PlayStation 4 controllers for sure! Although the battery life may not last as long it’s new features definitely make up for it! They’re easy to use and comfortable in my opinion.,5,2022/12/21
"Nice looking easy to hold controller. Not much more to say. Very easy to connect to the PS5 in the first instance and had no issues with using wirelessly since. They hold a good charge and are quick to charge when required, either though a cable or the controller charger. They can’t take much damage however and a raging bounce off the floor did cause some damage but then they weren’t built for this !",5,2021/02/10
"Controller only worked for about a month, tried to return via Amazon for an exchange but all I can seem to get is a referral to Sony direct, Amazon seem to have washed their hands of it and it’s my problem now!",1,2021/05/08

"I havent even got my ps5 yet, so looked at the extra controller i bought, i was feelin good and excited about my ps5 arriving and then i opened the controller! The cheap bastards didnt even supply a charge cable, wtf, it does feel quite comfortable tho, similar to the ps4 controller, if not better, after comparing the 2 the ps5 one feels better! Abit like the xbox one elite controller, feels more substantial, just better, yeah no cable! I can live with that as i had one anyways",5,2020/11/17

Decent controller. Makes your hands sweat . The thumb grips are rubbish and your finger slip off them.,3,2020/12/03
"As always with sony, a little pricey, but the in all fairness the PS5 is in another level, the feedback and sound and motion detection you can use woth this controller is unreal, I'm sure as more games cone out the price will be worth every penny.",5,2021/05/22
"Its a playstation, anything that is branded playstation gets 5 stars. If it was an xbox then I wouldn't be writing a review as the PS5 is clearly better. Dont try and convert me...",5,2020/11/14
"I love this controller, I have bought two of them, you can read any of the other reviews for all the reasons I love them, truly do believe the hype, they’re great.

I have however left this with 3 stars, and that’s because one of controllers after only 20 days of use has developed a faulty trigger. I think those adaptive triggers, despite being one of the best parts of PS5, are going to be pain points going into the future.

My right trigger has become loose and does not have the same tension as the left trigger.

I’ve sent it off for a refund, and I’m not overly bothered as I have a replacement. But just something to be aware of.",3,2020/12/07

"It's Sony so of course it's to be expected that it's great quality, was easy to setup even with my PC or iPad and it is extremely durable since it's taken a few tumbles. Definitely don't regret this purchase whatsoever. The only downside is the grip is super textured so it can get dirt and grime trapped really easily but as long as you're not covering it with cheeto dust it should be fine.",5,2022/11/10
Useful gaming equipment,5,2022/06/14

Excellent does what it says on the box plus you can add a wired headset to the controller. you can move around and sit where you want. My son loves it.,5,2021/06/06
"These are not cheap though I feel controllers somehow a big step up from the PS4 one

"These are not cheap though I feel controllers somehow a big step up from the PS4 one

"It's Sony so of course it's to be expected that it's great quality, was easy to setup even with my PC or iPad and it is extremely durable since it's taken a few tumbles. Definitely don't regret this purchase whatsoever. The only downside is the grip is super textured so it can get dirt and grime trapped really easily but as long as you're not covering it with cheeto dust it should be fine.",5,2022/11/10
"Good controller but still have a few things to work out ,the buttons stick from time to time so had to buy lubricant to stop this from happening ,otherwise overall very good value for money .",5,2021/03/09

My son he is very happy with control pad thank you,5,2021/03/09
Ordered a ps5 controller for pc use and work amazingly. Have an Xbox one too and it is very good. The Xbox controller is better optimized for pc use and less complicated in general and the ps5 dualshock is not supported by all games but it is a great controller and would recommend.,5,2022/08/28

"Great controller,needs a charging cable to be included really at £60 but you do get one at least with your ps5.",4,2020/11/21
"Good controller, however slightly overpriced compared to alternatives especially considering the fact that it has no charging cable and I had to buy one separately which is quite expensive.

"If you are looking at this you probably already know about it, its a DualSense controller for a playstation 5.

Having already had 1 I wanted a second for playing 2 player games locally. It feels like its built to a great quality and has excellent haptic feedback.",5,2021/04/13

"Next gen console must have a next gen controller and these ones are 100% next gen, Sony have done it again with the next generation of dualshock controller

It just feels right in the hands as soon as you hold it
USB Type C charging port as it's all going that way now
Haptic triggers!!!! They take a bit of getting used to but weyyyyyy heyyyyyyyyyyyy there spot on with the feedback and resistance depending on what is going on onscreen at the time
Not used the onboard mic yet but then i havent played astro bot yet
Thumbsticks feel very much like the PS4 thumbsticks to felt right at home straight away using them
Got this as a spare for rotation when one goes flat as i'm not keen on having it plugged in playing and charging at the same time",5,2020/12/01

Good product,5,2022/12/18
"Much better than ps4 controller, feels nicer more weighted and the haptic triggers are dope. It is very good. Defo recommend.",5,2020/12/14
"Do not buy this controller in my opinion. It was a slight upgrade from the ps4 controller and I mainly bought it because of the usb c charger, as it is more convenient for me because I use the same charger for my phone. However it does not come with a charger in the box so if you don't already own a usb c charger then tough luck. My main issue is the stick drift that started after owning it for only 2 months with very moderate use for most of the time. I have kept it in perfect condition and always returned it to its box after use so there is no chance that dust got into the joystick. The stick drift makes games close to unplayable with your character aiming up very noticably (I usually play FPS) and there seems to be no way to fix it as far as I can see. Never buying this again.",1,2021/04/27
Super responsive controller hubby loves it very recommended,5,2020/12/29

Yea yea,5,2022/12/16
"The controller feels much more responsive and better to hold it is well made and strong im not sure the white will age well in my house but it looks great
the only complaint i have is the new microphone that is built into the controller the problem is people can hear the buttons being pressed expecially when my son plays who is heavy handed
the triggers feel much more responsive too and i like the whole feel in my opinion it makes me feel more comfortable in game and maybe slightly more accurate when playing FPS games a solid 4.5 from me amazing except for the built in mic which i don't like",5,2021/04/08

"Unfortunately the Dualsense controllers that came with the PlayStation 5 nearly two years is faulty.

However, I am pleased that this controller had quite a quick delivery, works as intended and was definitely brand new.

I would suggest to get a warranty in the event something does occur so at least you have peace of mind.",5,2022/10/03
"Purchased a PS5 from Amazon but needed an extra controller so purchased this one as a 2nd one, the controller worked okay at first but then it started to drift up, so basically walking around in a game looking at sky.
Did hard resets on the controller also turned off Bluetooth as well. However the controller only worked with Bluetooth off and connected with a cable which is pointless so it had to be replaced. Up to now the replacement has been spot on.
Also because a PS4 game was being played on the PS5 we connected a PS4 controller to the PS5 which worked wireless great.",1,2021/01/11
"The new DualShock controllers really expand on the functionality from the previous generation and find a way to innovate on top of an already phenomenal product.

The Adaptive Trigger technology is the shining star of this product and is something you really have to experience to understand. While the previous generation had Haptic Feedback that allowed you to “feel” things like the draw of a bow with the vibrations, Adaptive Trigger layers on that by providing resistance based on an activity for an experience that is truly amazing. Now instead of feeling something that imitates the pull and snap of a bow or click of a trigger, you can actually feel the resistance of that string or trigger. With Adaptive Trigger, you can even feel the “weight” of objects, with a heavy weapon commanding a heavier trigger to pull, and a light and agile weapon having a feather light trigger.

Adaptive Trigger isn’t the only thing to rave about on this though. This controller shows that Sony is in tune with trends and the future (and present) of gaming. The Audio/Microphone button is a total game changer for people who enjoy playing games with chat, replacing clunky press to talk or always on formats. Also, the controller now has a built in microphone… so no more excuses for not joining comms!

They also made improvements to the touchpad, but it still is too clunky to use IMO and I would far prefer some sort of heads up display screen or something as almost nothing uses touchpad functionality short of the keyboard. Also, the built in speaker is much louder and more games support it which is great to see.

Overall, a really awesome product and I can’t wait to see what Sony innovates in the future!",4,2022/10/12
My PS5 is now complete. Extra remotes to play as long as I want. Battery life is shorter than the 4 but the remote itself has more functionality. For 70 dollars it had better last awhile!,5,2022/12/26

The PlayStation 5 is awesome! And I’m so glad they sell the controllers on amazon. Will be nice to have a backup controller and one for 2 player games. Works great!,5,2022/11/18
"I like the PS5 controller in general. Haven't seen any 3rd party controller that I like better. Button clicks and ergonomics are great--it's obvious that Sony has been in the controller-making game for decades.

BUT... the rumble and sound that comes from the controller is absolutely atrocious. I always turn those things off immediately. Even without those ""features"", I think the controller is worth it... I just don't understand why they even put volume in the controller if it has to be so distorted that you cant even make out whats coming from it. The rumble is a gimmick that should have died with the N64 rumble pack.",4,2022/09/29

"Needed a Gaming controller for PC. Simple. Browsed amazon for any efficient and cheap controller to get the job done. Needless to say, You get what you pay for. Wish i just bought this one instead and glad i did now after the fact. Its comfortable, not clunky, preforms great for fighting/FPS/RPG or any general type gaming. Great Product and definitely a must have for gaming controllers",5,2022/10/17

"Both remotes are now easily charged so when the kids are ready to play there is no wait, no arguing. Nice compact, sturdy device that charges rather quickly.",5,2022/10/31
"I remember being a kid, and growing up thinking controllers were only to control the game. You had joysticks, and buttons. Then more buttons. Then even more buttons. At some point, where I stepped away from gaming, my son stepped in...but when we experienced these DualSense controllers, WOW. I never thought I'd see a day when haptic feedback would be accompanied by actual pressure feedback on triggers. It adds whole new dimension to game-play that I never thought I'd see. It charges via USB-C, which is the way most things are going these days due to the ability to charge faster and also carry data along the same cable.

This controller came in manufacturer packaging and all. It's brand new, OEM, and works great! I can't wait to see what the next generation of controllers can do, but the sensitivity and game play from these is phenomenal!",5,2022/08/17
"I’ve been playing PlayStation since the 90s. I have never had issues like I‘ve had with PS5 controllers.

I got a PS5 in December 2021, and one year later, I’m on my third controller, and that one is falling apart. Every one of them has failed in a different, unique way. Let me list the variety of failures:

1. Within two months, the controller that came with the system had stick drift in the right stick that made it unusable. The stick was loose and you could hear it bouncing around if you wiggled the controller.

2. This one worked for about three months until L3 started making a crunchy noise and eventually started drifting and not responding to L3 inputs. The X button was always really sticky on this one. You’d press X and the button would stay depressed for a second before popping out. Many game characters accidentally plummeted to their doom with this controller. I don’t button mash and don’t have large hands, and I’m not abusing them.

3. My current controller lasted almost seven whole months. By “lasted,” I mean it never worked with any headset, but still technically worked otherwise. I tried multiple headsets, and they all had the same nonstop buzzing, static sound. I mostly play single player games through a sound bar, so I just lived with this and used the controller itself as a mic for the occasional co op game (which was a pretty bad experience as well. My co op partner couldn’t hear me well unless I held the controller close to my face, but who games like that?). But now the rubber on the left thumb pad is starting to tear off. It’s still useable but I know it’s going to need to be replaced soon. I’ve never seen a thumb pad tear off a controller, let alone in a few months.

The haptic feedback is pretty neat, but I end up turning off the adaptive triggers in most games. It feels kind of gimmicky and doesn’t add much, in my opinion.

If anything, I’m a PlayStation fanboy, so this is extra frustrating. I had like six controllers throughout the entire PS4 era, and I’m coming up on four within one year for the PS5. Maybe I’m a fringe case, I really hope so. But at $80 a pop, I expect the controller to not literally fall apart in my hands. I shouldn’t need to disassemble and clean out my controller’s innards, at least not after a few months of use.

I feel kind of stuck because I can’t afford to buy a new $80 controller every few months, and I have no faith that any new ones are going to hold up. I really don’t want to keep giving Sony money but there aren’t a lot of other decent options.

I hope your luck is better than mine (very probable).",1,2022/12/12

Kids love the freedom away from keyboard and on-screen controls. The have to repair when used across devices - slight inconvienence.",4,2022/09/17
"I use this with my PC. Honestly it is, in my opinion, the best controller that exists. I also have an XBox Elite controller which is nice, but this one feels just as well built and more ergonomic. The build quality feels a bit better than the PS4 controllers.",5,2022/08/29
Will likely return my controller as it feels like buttons are already sticking and the controller just lacks durability. I take great care of my peripherals and this controller feels like it is over a year old after only 2 weeks of use.,3,2022/11/08

I have always loved Playstation's controllers and this one blew my mind and I needed a second one to keep charged when the first one runs out of battery. The only downside is that you don't get a charging cable with your purchase. I ended up buying the charging station anyway...,4,2022/04/05
"I ordered two of these, and I just opened them today since I have been busy. Something does feel off about them but whatever for that.

They do not come with cords at all so make sure you have a USB C with USB cord already on hand.

I’m leaving a 3 star review at the moment becaus they seem like they work, but one of them was definitely used!! The back of the controller has dirt on it, and the tape on one of the boxes seem like someone tried to pick it off and put it back on. (I use a knife to cut tape on boxes)

We will see what will happens on how they work. :( disappointed that one seems used!!",3,2022/07/21

"Very effective when working properly and a nice design. I deducted two stars for the fact the controller I got with the PS5 originally earlier this year developed intermittent connection issues, and I had to pay for a new one that worked properly with my headset.

Even to my friends they didn't even know what happened, tue controller was connected yea, BUT when I went to play a game it would not work...I had to go to the settings and mess around to get it to randomly start working like a normal controller...anyways besides that experience I do love the controller so much",5,2021/06/07

I very much like this. I purchased this PS5 controller because it's compatible with my PS3 and PC games and it's difficult to find decent PS3 controllers these days. It feels lovely to use and has nice features. Eventually I may even get to use it on a real proper nice PS5 console once they actually become available to us mere ordinary folks. One day. Not really a criticism but it would be nice to purchase the official Sony controller with an included Sony official controller cable but I suppose this is too much to expect. Even a new Apple iPhone does not come with a charger. Those Nintendo handheld thingies do not come with one either I think.,5,2021/06/28
This was a birthday gift and it works like the original one that comes with the system.,5,2022/04/05
Great seller shipped same day ordered very fast no issues the ps5 controller will be used with my pc is very comfortable and love that it comes with usb type c,5,2022/02/20
Works great straight out of the box,5,2022/07/07
"Better than expected, feels immaculate! Highly rate this product",5,2022/06/28
Excellent delivery timing. But the product did not come with a charger & I wonder why??? It would have gotten a 5-star from me if it came with a charge.,4,2021/08/18
"I use it only for PC.

It's great in PC games and emulators. Especially good for Zelda: Breath of the Wild via Cemu emulator, because of the motion control support.

Decent battery life, great ergonomics, very responsive controls.",5,2022/03/17
Came on time and operates like a controller should,5,2022/03/16
Doesn't work that great,5,2022/04/06
"I do not own a PS5 so have yet to experience the haptic feedback but I use it with an 8bitDo Bluetooth dongle and use it on Windows, MiSTer FPGA and my Switch and it is my favourite controller I have ever owned. I used to prefer an Xbox 360 controller over Dual shock 4 but now this is my go to. Can't wait to experience the haptic feedback once I can get my hands on a PS5, I have only heard great reviews.",5,2021/08/27
For some reason Playstation has not figured out an easy way to connect and keep connected their controllers. Had to return this one.,2,2022/10/19
"I understand recirculating returned items, but when I'm paying full price for this I'd expect all cords to be in there (I'm not a PS5 owner, was using for PC) and that the controller be cleaned thoroughly. While there wasn't dirt or grime, there were tons of little hairs sticking out of nearly every opening in the controller so I decided to return. Will be purchasing new at a storefront",2,2022/08/03
"Why couldn't you include a charging cable? Or at least have two in the PS5 box.
The supplied PS5 charging cable has distinctive box square ends so finding one to match isn't an option short of getting an additional PS5.

When charging its hard to tell when charging is finished or the cord isn't connected as there are no lights when plugged in. My previous dock showed different colours for charging / full.

The lack of colours. You have two controllers one is charged and one isn't. Which one do i use?
The only way is to try it out and end up with a flat controller or read the serial number.

Other than the issues above, its got a nicer feel to the PS4 dual shock, somewhat textured.
The haptic feedback is only on two buttons which is a shame. It kind of feels like it wont last as long between charges to make the lack of colour worse.

Best demo of the haptic feedback in the game is in Astros Playroom. When in the monkey suit you do rock climbing in some of the later bits or in hidden areas some of the rock climbing holds break if held too hard. The player has to judge the weight put onto the holds just enough.

Would be nicer if this was a true haptic feedback as i believe there are only certain levels and certain resistance applied. A true haptic feedback would push against you rather than providing resistance only",3,2020/11/16
"I needed a second remote for my son. Ps5 only has 1 style of remote so pretty hard to rate otherwise

Delivery was good came next day",5,2022/03/26

"good, arrived new and as listed, fast shipping.",5,2022/06/06
"Great quality…I bought it to play Call of Duty Mobile..

Runs great on my IPAD.",5,2022/04/30
"This one is THE BEST. LITERALLY THE BEST CONTROLLER EVER MADE.

Not because of the adaptive triggers (fun gimmick, but meh) but because of just how PERFECTLY it feels and responds.",5,2021/10/24
"The Dualshock 4 was a very good controller and it served Sony well, I always preferred the Xbox style controller so with the PS4 I ended up getting the Nacon Revolution controllers. But the new dualsense controller for the PS5 is amazing, it's kind of a half way between the Dualshock and a Xbox controller. But the new sensory features the controller brings games to life!

Just play the Astro Bot game that comes with the PS5 with this controller and you just have to marvel at what the Sony engineers have come up with. A fantastic controller with great features and makes gaming that little more enjoyable.",5,2020/12/05
"Muy buen mando, la experiencia es bastante buena, solo me gustaría que en un futuro muevan la palanca izquierda en la parte de arriba donde está la cruzeta y viceversa la cruzeta dónde está la palanca, así es más cómodo, solo eso y funciona muy bien en mi pc.",5,2021/06/13
"It's slightly heavier than the previous DualShock 4 controller but in a good way, the weight feels nice in the hands. The triggers have a bit of extra tension to them which leads to more precise analogue movement. The underside is slightly grippy and the texture hides a pretty awesome surprise if you look really closely. All in all this is a nice improvement over the last model and it works flawlessly with my PC.",5,2021/06/29
Fast shipping and nice product,5,2022/01/26
"Worked great the first month of so. Now wireless doesn't work. Sony offers no support or trouble shooting for PC issues.
The building is incredible. Very solid controller with the most advanced parts. Feels very solid in the hand not typically controller flex in-between the main parts of the body.
Steam big picture Will fix compatibility with just about any game. If it's not on steam add it as a non steam game then play it on steam big picture.
Still hard to recommend giving the wireless bugged out and there is no fix.",2,2022/03/25
"Sticky circle button right out of the box.. Otherwise, good. What a shame.",2,2022/09/25
A second controller is a must for all ps5 owners,5,2022/04/21
Works well however stick drifting happen . Might need to contact Sony for a fix,4,2021/11/20
Very good,5,2021/12/29
Great controller for the money,5,2022/04/04
Competitive micro sensitivity like nothing on the ps4. It’s the best fight gaming pad there is.,5,2021/09/10

"Working as it should.
Just got it in Friday, had to charge so only used it a couple hrs. So far so good.",5,2021/04/25
Does what it needs to do. The package contains controller only no charging cord.,5,2022/01/01
"I really like the feel of the PS5 controller, Sony did a great job. No issues so far and as a bonus you can pair it with an Apple TV to play games.",5,2021/08/29

"Very pleased with the item and saved $20 the seller was amazing and sent a courtesy email to me, just to check and make sure everything was fine and if any queries etc to contact them item was brand new and original and works as it should",5,2021/05/21
"Bought controller condition as “new”... the sticker seal on packaging had clearly been removed and reapplied and the controller had small smudges suggesting it was actually “used.” Condition looks like it’s in good shape, but disappointed it came as it did.",3,2021/05/25
Came to me a day early and in perfect condition. Didn't come with a charging cable which is normal in the original packaging. Works well on pc and much improved to the previous generation controller,5,2021/06/26
Stick drift not even 2 weeks out of the box. What an absolute Pile of SSSHHHH. I should've listened to the reviewers.,1,2022/12/20
Works just the same as PS5 included controller. Battery life could be better,4,2021/06/06
"Feels solid with a slight texture on the underside of the controller. Sony really improved the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

Astro playroom, which comes free on the PS5, demonstrates all the features very well.

Just wish it came in different colours.

Edit: revising my review after my controller became faulty in under a month. It appears that joystick drift and loose triggers is a common problem with this controller. Hopefully Sony steps up the quality control and address these design flaws.",3,2021/02/07
"Such a great controller. Always have to have two controllers for a console so as soon as I got word my preorder for the console had come in I searched for another one and Amazon was the cheapest by $10, free shipping. It came next day!",5,2021/02/11
I received a defective controller and I request to return it. It's been almost two months and still haven't received my refund!!!,1,2022/12/12
"Simple really, the delivery was great with excellent communication from dispatch to the door. Product really is self explanatory and did exactly what was hoped and expected. 5 Stars",5,2021/06/28
He like it,5,2021/07/09
Bought it when it is cheaper than DS4. Work on PC using steam controller setting. Need a third party software or bluetooth receiver to make it fully work.,5,2021/06/26
everything good thank you,5,2021/05/31
"It's a shame that Sony makes us use this poor quality product to play PS5 games. I am rough on my controllers in general but previous generations would still last me 3+ years. Both of the Dual Sense controllers I own have become unusable in less than 6 months because of stick drift. Apparently, this is a common problem that has sparked a lawsuit against Sony. I won't be able to play any of my PS5 games until I pay for another one. I guess Sony found a way to more than double my PSN subscription cost. Hold off on ordering one of these until they resolve the issue if you can especially if you are rough on controllers like I am.",1,2022/01/11
As described,5,2021/06/09
Works great,5,2021/06/07
"Genuine product, works well.",5,2021/11/26
Defective and multiple buttons don't work. The X and L2 button don't work. Worked with the technical support for the controller and they said it was defective. Even added a picture incase they try and say it's bs fraud.,1,2022/10/09
"This is apparently a cheaply refurbished controller. It quit working ten days after the 30 day warranty. Don't buy here. For the cost, you can get it directly from Playstation with better support.",1,2022/11/13
To use this controller it says it needs to update but when I plug it in to the console it doesn’t recognize this controller so it won’t update so it’s basically useless now after a week of use. Thanks I spent 70$ for nothing.,1,2022/09/08
"EDIT: Updating the review to remove a star. I've had yet another controller develop problems. This time with stick drift on the right analogue stick. About to file ANOTHER WARRANTY claim :-(

The features of this controller are amazing. Adaptive triggers. Feedback. Etc. Plenty of reviews out there for these for you to find out more.

The build quality however is very sketchy. I'm onto my third replacement In less than 12 months. 2 had the right trigger fail (broken spring internally), and one with a sticky X button that doesn't pop back up when pressed.

These are known issues which seem pretty common when I googled them.

Fortunately Amazon's return policy is incredible and has offered replacements each time a fault arises.",2,2021/10/08
"This is a replacement controller for another that had button stick.
Perfect, no problems with this one at all.",5,2021/07/13
"Has better haptic feedback than last gen, longer battery life and longer bluetooth range, it's also heavier. Other than that it's what you would expect a playstation controller to be.",5,2021/04/01
The new DualSense controller is great for gaming feels comfortable in your hand and the new triggers and haptic feed back really increase the level of enjoyment in game.,5,2021/04/08
"Great controller. Fast delivery, good packaging.",5,2021/10/12
"I found this controller to be not as responsive as it could be for games. I've got a feeling that it won't last too long before it needs replacing. Will someone come up with a cheaper generic replacement as I don't need a controller with a speaker inside it? Another thing I found is it only flashes once when on charge so I have to guess when its charged. I can't say I'm impressed with the whole PS5 experience as it's counter intuitive, doesn't download when asleep, is over-complicated to find on screen information and for some reason Sony wants my birth date which is none of their business. On the plus side it is easier to start playing then Xbox One.",2,2021/08/07
"Got this during the Prime Day Sale and couldn’t be happier! Great product at great price! Thanks, Amazon!",5,2021/06/27
"Bit different with the weight distribution, but what a beautiful control. Love it for PC.",5,2021/07/24
"This may be the best controller ever, but the fact that it doesn't come with a pairing/charging cable is unacceptable. The instructions even state things like, ""Connect the controller to your console using the USB cable included with your console,"" and, ""Use the USB cable included with your console to connect the controller..."" And yet, said USB cable does not exist. Other users may say it's a minor cost, to purchase another USB cable - but if it's so minor, why hasn't the manufacturer included it? Especially after the manufacturer says to use the included cable in order to use the product? Sorry, Sony, this is a big fail.",1,2021/06/15

"Awesome controller, great price, great features with an amazing attention to detail. It’s by far the best that Sony has made for its Ps5",5,2021/01/17
I bought the controller used and immediately there were problems. The controller went haywire and would drift like crazy. The L1 and R1 buttons didn’t work as well as the touchpad. Maybe my controller got damaged in shipping but I would never buy a used controller from amazon again.,1,2022/04/17

"In sonys attempt to make a superb controller, it would seem that they made a problematic controller w all the haptic feedback stuff, stuffed in it. After just a few hours, left joystick would drift to the left. I even turn off excess haptic, does nothing to fix it, reboot it, nope. Unacceptable at this price for them not to fix,as there is lots of info regarding this.",1,2021/07/30
