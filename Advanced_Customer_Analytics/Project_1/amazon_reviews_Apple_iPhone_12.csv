Refurbished IPhone 12. Immaculate and half the price of a new iPhone 14,5,2022/12/23
I am out of words to say that one is perfect phone for me.,5,2022/12/09
Am a regular apple user and this phone is great. I don‚Äôt think you need the latest model. The facial recognition makes it quicker to open. Camera good quality too.,5,2022/11/23
"I had one of these a while ago but it was the first that Apple brought out. When I got a new Apple I passed it onto the wife and she thought it was great, years pass and the phone packs up ( the battery) so I bought her the iPhone 12 upgraded version it‚Äôs taken a while to get her bearings on it but she getting there!",5,2022/10/28
As expected,5,2022/11/28
"Overall a very good phone, and serves its purpose- finally replaced my old iPhone 7. It needs a bit of getting used to slid to the next screen.
Saved ¬£¬£¬£ during Prime Day. Items arrived opened box and without a manual- but received an extra discount. Very pleased with the extra saving!",4,2022/10/19
So the phone works amazing had it for a good few months now and has done me wonders but the only problem is the battery seems to not last as long as it should do I don‚Äôt know if it got damaged on the way or that‚Äôs me just having to much of expectations but other than that I would recommend having this phone,4,2022/07/26
The iPhone 12 is the best iv had to date the quality of the graphics in games and the battery life is a lot better so would definitely recommend.,5,2022/10/23
Battery life is good nice colour all in all a good phone,4,2022/09/22
"I bought it for my son and he loves it. It works smoothly, it perfectly lies in the hand. Very fast delivery",5,2022/09/29
"My last iPhone was the 1st Gen iPhone SE in 2016, it was great however it had a small 32GB storage, I got rid of it because I kept running out of space and iCloud drive wasn't great at the time, hence I got the 256GB capacity iPhone 12

Been on Android for 5 years and it's been a welcome return back to iPhone, the phone is smooth, animations are immediate, FaceID has never let me down, with Apple's 20W charger, the charge time is pretty good too. iPhone 12 has wireless charging which makes it perfect to charge conveniently in the car.

Battery life is okay, nothing to write home about, I'm a power user and I can get 6 hours of screen on time day to day, and very rarely have I killed it in one day.

Design wise, if you loved the iPhone 4, you'll love this, it's an extension of that design idea, not slippery to hold like previous iPhones, this is Apple at it's best when it comes to industrial design.

Highly recommend the iPhone 12, I think it's the pick of the bunch since the Pro models have the same A14 processor and unless you really want LiDAR and the extra macro camera, I think this is the pick of the bunch.",5,2021/07/12
Battery efficiency good after few months use,4,2022/07/11
The face recognition very quick and efficient. Battery life better than my previous iPhone.,5,2022/09/25
Very pleased with my phone thanks,5,2022/09/25
iPhone is excellent does everything it‚Äôs supposed to do,5,2022/09/22
"A real bargain from Amazon warehouse. Came in pristine condition 100% battery and 9 months of Apple care still on the phone.
Happy customer and would definitely look at finding the same deal again in the future",5,2022/08/19
"Ordered to replace my iPhone 11. Phone has a great camera, facial recognition, easy to use, clear screen quality etc‚Ä¶ but the battery does not last long at all. I feel I am constantly having to charge it up where I could have the same usage with my iPhone 11 and the battery would last all day.",3,2022/08/10
"This was a replacement for my ageing iPhone 7plus and it was worth the wait. I got this before the iPhone 13 was release at a very good price, its screen, battery life and speed are all excellent and with the longevity of the apple devices and the support for several years of updates I had no hesitation to buy another over the android devices that have very poor support for anything more than one year. I have been delighted with the ease of migrating data from one phone to the next which used wireless pairing and seamless migration of everything from my old phone to the new one. The camera is also excellent and its a nice device to hold too. Shame I have to put it in a case for work due to the hostile environments I work in. Otherwise I would recommend this to those looking for an upgrade from an older device at a more affordable price",5,2021/09/24
Had to send my XR back bad connection problems but usual excellent customer service from Amazon so decided to upgrade to a 12 not a lot of cosmetic difference between them nothing seem to change much on the working aspect of the phones keep giving fancy write ups re the camera but sadly a picture is a picture to me I don‚Äôt see the difference between any photos never really grasp the extortionate prices for I phones one is much like the other if you compare them on apples compare I phones there is very little difference in the phone apart from the price legalised extortion by apple really had all different models of iPhones since their conception only had trouble with the XR but the warranty covered that so see how this one goes,5,2021/12/24
"The iPhone 12 is a brilliant phone. I originally had an iPhone 8 and upgraded to the 12. The camera is brilliant - the pictures come out so crisp and look amazing. I like the more rounder edges of this iPhone as well. I got the iPhone 12 in blue and it looks so great, the picture of it doesn‚Äôt do it justice! The only downside of this is that due to the price I‚Äôd have hoped to have got headphones and I thankfully already had a mains plug but if someone else was buying an apple product for the first time then you will need to buy one or you aren‚Äôt able to charge your phone. The size is of this phone is great too, I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt go for the bigger size because this can fit into your pocket perfectly. I love that this has face recognition (what did I do before this?!) it‚Äôs so much easier to use now even though with having to use masks all the time right now it isn‚Äôt difficult for that but worth it if you aren‚Äôt needing to use Apple Pay!",5,2021/05/09
"The only thing I was pleasantly surprised about after a few days usage is the battery life, which I expected to be worse after reading other reviews. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 Plus that I used for 4 years, so I was expecting to notice the upgrade. I easily manage to get 30-40% charge at the end of the day with normal use (about 1h in voice calls, 15 minutes videocall, occasional YouTube videos, texting and 3-4 pictures throughout the day).
I'm not using the camera for pictures and videos much, as I prefer using my Fujifilm mirrorless for photography.
I love the blue color, but I am biased as it is my favorite. I was tempted by the black one, which I believe is going to be the most picked one. Face ID works like a charm. It's unfortunate we are in a pandemic and wear masks when shopping, so Face ID won't work for contactless payments. It does quickly switch to passcode though, so you can avoid removing your face covering, as you are not supposed to. I have tried recommended methods to make it work with a face covering, but it did not work for me.",5,2021/02/25
I am happy with my phone and the option of pay few pound per month interest free for 12 month,5,2022/08/05
"I like it, battery long life, the phone so good.",4,2022/04/30
"I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven‚Äôt used the camera yet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now. I can only say that I love iPhones and think they are worth the extra money.üëç",5,2021/08/15
"The last time I bought a new iPhone was in 2011, since then I‚Äôve always bought 2nd hand because of the cost, but this time Amazon let me get the phone on monthly payments.
I went for the iPhone 12 256GB and WOW, I was impressed the 1st night I had it. I‚Äôm a photo taker and this phone just amazes me with the quality of the camera alone. All the photos were taken at night with NO flash and they look amazing.
Siri listens for the 1st time ever!
It‚Äôs soooooo loud compared to my old 7s Plus, it‚Äôs almost like I have a soundbar in my pocket!
I love the colour, I went for the Green one, well it is different!
It‚Äôs seriously fast too, once I ordered a 5G sim from my provider that is!
I have zero complaints about the phone, worth the money as I know it will last!",5,2021/08/21
I like it. No problem with it just like it‚Äôs says in description. Brand new. No damages. Working perfectly.,5,2022/07/20
I would never change an Iphone for Android,5,2022/08/13
Nothing special. Same as all iPhones. Only stay due to my music collection,3,2022/07/26
"I had struggled along for a while with my old 6s. Big mistake. Bought the twelve after reading all the reviews of 11-13. Very easy to set up from cloud. Love the magnetic cordless charging. Battery life seems endless compared to old phone. I do lots of calls,emails and SMS/WhatsApp messages and calls. Don't use camera that much. Great phone.",5,2022/04/18
"Expensive for what it is, but then all the newest phones are.
It is a nice phone though and I feel if you‚Äôve had multiple iphones in the past, you know what it‚Äôs all about. It‚Äôll take some adjusting to without having a home button at the bottom and a few additional button combinations and swipe patterns to get used.
The camera‚Äôs are a noticeable improvement, and I do like the face id to unlock - and when I‚Äôm wearing a face mask it will still unlock if it detects I‚Äôm wearing my apple watch so it knows it‚Äôs me.
The bigger screen is nice and I‚Äôm hoping the battery lasts longer with it being bigger but I have to say I do like having a phone you can operate with 1 hand and this does require 2 to reach all extremities of the screen.",5,2021/07/30
"The phone is fantastic. All the latest features, durable and a great battery",5,2022/07/17
"It's fairly responsive in touch and speed with opening apps
The camera doesn't feel that much improved but it's still very good

I'd say the best thing about the phone is the better CPU allow smooth operation and of course a better battery life

I've given 4 stars due to the fact that Apple take the liberty of removing earphones, chargers or adapters. I sincerely hope other companies don't follow suit.

It's crazy enough paying almost 1k for phones nowadays and to receive nothing else additional feels like robbery",4,2021/09/27
"Arrived on time, I upgraded from an iPhone X. Camera is really great and some nice new features",5,2022/07/10
"Easy to get used to the controls, arrived within 3 days, perfect",5,2022/07/08
Blue colour model has back panel which is not up to mark or colour is dull or different from online page,4,2022/02/23
"I bought this iPhone two days ago and it arrived today. I confess I was so afraid of being robbed on the way from UK to Dublin. Well, thank Gosh it didn't happen. I got it, recharged, put my acc on it, all my apps, SIM card and everything is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I need to write about the performance of the phone (because it's awesome) but I am sure to recommend if you are looking for a phone here in Amazon, check the sellers and the reviews and pray :D

Thank you",5,2021/11/15
Bought this phone sim free to replace my old iPhone 6s Plus. Fantastic phone that I‚Äôve just had for over a week now and I love it. Really impressed by the quality of camera too. Great purchase!,5,2022/05/12
"Phone arrived on time, the currier arrived to the door and we both was scared on the trade of parcel for password and at the end we made safe; nothing wrong with the currier, the shipping was excellent. I turned on the phone and the system started with aggressive configurations and queries for phone identifier, I text a software engineer in the group to restore IMEI and component serial, technically the amazon control team was using a foreign country identification for myself name, and I am attending the reset to first start of the phone to obtain primary original IOS addons and amazon shopping reference in UK.",4,2021/06/07
Came in perfect conditions. No complaints,5,2022/06/23
"This is definitely my favourite iphone I have had so far, the design is great and feels really nice to hold and feels really smooth to use with its fast speeds, the camera takes really nice clear pictures and the video quality is great, also the sound from the speakers is great and loud which is good when watching videos and listing to music on, the screen size is also perfect for me as not to big and not to small, nice to watch YouTube and other videos on and also good for gaming as games also run nice and smooth. This is the perfect mobile phone for me as does everything i want and just the right size. Highly recommend this iphone as very happy with it.",5,2021/06/20
"Used Android phones for years, pretty much every pixel phone, and quite a few samsungs, thought it was time to try an iphone.

Love it, nice design, quality, great camera and battery life.

Everything about it feels premium.",5,2022/04/18
Apple rarely disappoint because they follow a formula that works. If you have used iPhone in the last 5 years. You come to expect what iPhone‚Äôs are capable with. This iPhone was purchased as an upgrade from an iPhone 8 Plus for my mum and it is an healthy upgrade. If you have an 11 or XR maybe wait till 14 because by that point their should be a noticeable upgrade.,5,2022/01/13
"Switching from Android to an iPhone for the 1st time was an adjustment but the phone is really easy to use, camera is great, battery life very good.
All in all very pleased with the iphone 12",5,2022/04/20
"Pros:
It gives premium feel and rich experience, which is obvious.
Camera is really good which iPhone is known for.

Cons:
Sometime it hangs all of a sudden. The app icons doesn't work at all. And I must restart the phone to make it work again. It may be one device issue but it shouldn't be even for one device given the price.

While talking on WhatsApp call, my voice won't go through if the other person is talking.",3,2022/02/07
"I bought this as an upgrade from iPhone 8. Love the face recognition , easy to set up from my old phone.
Camera is better. And bigger screen.",5,2022/05/10
"We always save up and purchase our phones out right and then get a monthly sim only deal as you save a fortune over a 2/3 year contract. This iPhone isn‚Äôt all bells and whistles - not a huge difference from our previous iPhone 7 Plus - however the camera is significantly better and the battery life lasts a whole day without charging and the face recognition is quick and easy - even wearing glasses or a mask! . Having said that, I probably don‚Äôt use all the features on it - so may be missing out on some major upgrades - but for my needs it‚Äôs perfect.
We are an Apple family and love them and if that‚Äôs the case, would recommend this phone.",5,2021/06/13
"Great phone, not a fan of the lack of a headphone port",5,2022/06/04
"Very good Smartphone - like ever - but one important thing is missing: FingerPrint reader. Nowadays where we are constantly using masks, just face recognition is not enough. It should have kept the fingerprint reader - in the same way I have in my old iPhone 8.

I have a Xiaomi that costs 30% - and IT contains both, face and fingerprint options. This is a very expensive product, should bring everything - including the charger... come on!",4,2021/07/27
"I am very satisfied with this phone. For my needs it‚Äôs absolutely fine: wonderful pictures, battery life is good, easy to use!",5,2022/05/17
My previous phone was an iPhone X and in its case the C fitted in most of my pockets the IPhone 12 is just a little bigger and once in the wallet it does not fit in most of my pockets,4,2021/10/29
It‚Äôs Apple and it‚Äôs an iPhone and as expected it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted. Face recognition is a massive improvement on using a finger.,5,2022/05/09
"Great phone, good price.",5,2022/06/14
"I moved to iphone from samsung just for camera quality. however if you are looking for best pictures, u still need to go for pro or even pro max. Before buying, i watched quite alot of youtube videos which compare the cameras and donot really find a big difference. In real life, when you put both iphone 12 and pro cameras together, it makes a difference in my personal view. Especially when it is dark, or complete opposite too bright ! So if you are buying mainly for camera and paying this money, just try yo go for pro if you can, if not, it is a great phone, great battery life, super fast... best iphone generation...",4,2021/02/14
"Absolute disappointment. Never had so many issues with network connection on any devices I owned. Week mobile reception, Wi-Fi is the worst won't connect or stay connected. Total garbage. Will sell it and never look on iphone again. Even Friking Poco F3 does better job for less than half price.",5,2022/02/17
Can‚Äôt go wrong,5,2022/06/13
"My old iPhone 7 broke. Bought this iPhone 12 to replace it. The colour blue is okay as expected. The bigger screen is what i wanted. Other functions are all similar to my iPhone 7, so i had no problem using it. It takes better pictures, comfortable to hold, battery life is okay so far as i turned icloud back-up off so the battery life lasts longer. I am quite happy with it.",4,2021/07/20
Would take a photo but can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm using the phone because it‚Äôs so good! It‚Äôs apple so you should expect it to be good. Came well packed and I damaged. Came on the day it said and was perfect.,5,2022/03/19
"This is a replacement for my iPhone 5, which tho working fine, could no longer download apps! ü§¨. Love the phone & colour & all its additions. Size is great as my eyes are not. Only downside is the keys are a bit too small & I keep hitting wrong ones.",4,2021/09/21
"I‚Äôve been needing to get a new phone for months and originally I was going to get an iPhone 11 but after the 11 being out of stock EVERYWHERE, I decided to buy the 12 since Amazon offered a pay-monthly scheme for it. The payments are ¬£145.80 spread over 5 months which is really good and overall works out cheaper for me.

The colour is gorgeous, the camera is excellent and overall it‚Äôs a very good phone. Really pleased :)",5,2021/10/16
Great phone and easy to use.,5,2022/06/02
My iPhone 7 was no longer keeping up so I took the plunge for a new phone. The technology is mind boggling and the device is beautiful. Facial recognition works even in the dark making this phone even more user friendly and convenient.,5,2022/03/01
"All my Busines and family activity.
I should not have bought it. Facial recognition good. Battery life awful. Should gone for iPhone 13.",3,2022/04/18
"Great phone, a lot of money but they usually last long. The finishing on the back (shiny on the standard 12) is a bit annoying as it gets full of fingertips, the lack of headphones and charging brick is a joke for the money you spend.
The building quality is amazing, the software is brilliant and the transition from another iPhone is amazing.",4,2021/07/12
Just bought this iPhone 12 in purple beautiful phone really great price on Amazon thank you! Very easy to set up and install from your old iPhone there is definitely a difference between the iPhone 11 and this iPhone 12 well worth buying this is my favourite iPhone and I‚Äôve ever owned and I‚Äôve had iPhones since iPhone 4 very good experience buying from Amazon as i was able to pay monthly interest free instead of outright like I‚Äôve done previously with apple just noticed it‚Äôs 20 % off today so even more reason to buy this stunning iPhone from apple via Amazon as far cheaper than apple store,5,2021/05/04
"Really nice phone to be honest. Always been an android user. Slowly been moving over to apple devices elsewhere and decided for this upgrade to switch. The eco system is fantastic and the iPhone 12 just completes it. The battery life is phenomenal, I‚Äôm not glued to my phone so obviously your mileage will vary. But it always last the day and will charge to 80% to preserve the life of the battery. As I don‚Äôt require a full charge each day. Really snappy and hasn‚Äôt let me down once yet on the 3 months I‚Äôve had it.",5,2021/06/25
"I bought this for my son and I don't know the first thing about technology but I know that he wanted a iPhone so I read the reviews and decided to buy it for him off Amazon, I checked around to make sure I was paying the right price and I do trust Amazon so my thinking was if it's not what he wants I can return it and get a full refund. He loves it and says it's much better than the phone he had which isn't a iPhone but a good one nethertheless. He went for a walk and sent me the above picture on his new iphone it was getting dark and the quality is exceptional compared to his old phone. He said it's brilliant and would highly recommend it.",5,2020/12/14
"I decided to buy a new phone as opposed to a secondhand phone, although it‚Äôs very expensive it‚Äôs what I have been using for years! Still working out how everything works!",5,2022/03/14
This iPhone 12 have been amazing the battery life would last even the whole day I love it only thing I dislike is that we weren‚Äôt given a proper charger,5,2022/03/15
"I‚Äôve had an iPhone 6s for some years and decided to upgrade to an iPhone 12. I thought I‚Äôd notice a difference but apart from having lots of storage I‚Äôm disappointed with my new phone, nothing seems any different with it, for example battery life is still poor, downloading speed still quite slow etc, not sure it was worth the money",3,2021/12/29
"I changed from an 11 Pro Max to the 12 because I like to keep up to date, even though to be honest it doesn't feel any faster because it shares the same gig mem. But I was a little tired of the weight and size of the 11 Pro Max and enjoy the smaller form factor of the 12. Though I must say I didn't see the phone in person (in an Apple store) before I purchased online, and I wouldn't call it red, more like a dark salmon in colour. If I had seen it in person first, I would have gone for another colour. But then again, after the case is on, all I see is the camera cut out.",5,2020/12/28
Nothing new,5,2022/05/20
"iPhone 12, is a phone worth purchasing. I found it abit challenging at first not being able to find my way around the interface, however, now I have adjusted, thumbs up.

Face recognition is new to me and I now find it very useful when not wearing a mask üòÇ. Battery life is excellent.
I also like the feature were I can set it on 4G/5G.",5,2021/09/22
"The phone is as expected.
However just pray you don‚Äôt have any issues.
I had issues and Amazon and Amazon‚Äôs customer service is simply shocking.
You pay over ¬£800 for a phone and have a problem within 24 hours, I expect a replacing phone not a repair!!
I ended up going to the apple store in birmingham who sorted the phone.
I‚Äôll never buy an item like this from Amazon again",5,2021/08/25
"Small improvement but does feel better to hold, the camera is miles ahead of the X too. Upgraded due to iphone X age had decreased perfomance, maybe hold out for next release if you are with an iphone x still",4,2021/07/25
"I have been an android user since I switched from my iPhone 4 back in 2011. This design really takes me back and I‚Äôve got to admit Apple have done a superb job here.

I‚Äôve recently used the pixel 2xl and the pixel 3a and considering google have done a really good job with their own stripped back software, for me it‚Äôs nowhere near to Apple.

The iPhone 12 feels and looks premium and the iOS is a game changer compared to Android.

Personally I prefer to purchase my phones out right than sign up to a 24 month contract. Depending on what sim deal you can find you could save around ¬£400 to ¬£600 over 2 years so it‚Äôs always worth checking.

Overall it‚Äôs a great iPhone and looks fantastic in blue.!",5,2020/12/02
"The iPhone 12 is superb it is the perfect middle of the road phone. Its updated to latest specs and software does what ever is needed.
Its an excellent phone its screen is the perfect size, especially now that I just upgraded from iPhone 7. so its a world of a difference. the only issues are the price it is overpriced and the faceID which I feel is a step down from the more secure touchID and too much of a gimmick.
The battery is outstanding it literally lasts all day - 2 days without recharge especially if you‚Äôre a light user!
A superb all around phone.",5,2021/04/03
"Having upgraded from an iPhone7 I‚Äôm absolutely loving the 12. Have got used to facial recognition & swiping very quickly. As always, transferring phone info over was very quick & simple. I‚Äôve watched a couple of YouTube videos to understand the extra/different functionality which has really helped. Battery life is definitely much better than my 7. All in all I‚Äôm very happy with the 12.",5,2021/08/06
"I fell in love with the phone. But, my service provider couldn't facilitate eSIM. And it's very difficult to change eSIM for any emergency needs or we travel to other places and wants to use new SIM.
Apple should have provided Dual Nano SIM's. eSIM's will be difficult process for everyone to get and configure it. I'm sure not even 0.5% of iPhone users are adaptive to eSIM.",5,2021/08/08
"Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a ... load of money with them.
But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger. So please spend how much extra?
Its like selling a car without tyres
It is disgraceful, it should be illegal.",3,2021/08/18
"had a old phone that was small so this one is much better because it has a bigger screen.
i like apple phones so bought this one.",5,2022/02/17
"This is a perfect phone. Perfect size ,weight, smooth and elegant design. Impressive battery life for an above average user. I recommend a 256 GB. The only area I am very slightly disappointed is the screen response and touch ( typing) not bad though. I felt the phone is slightly overpriced from that perspective. I also recommend a green one . And also,I think i phone 12 is the perfect one unless you are OK with very heavy and big phones. I felt like the money I spent on this phone is not useless. Go ahead and get it. You will not be disappointed.",5,2021/01/12
Everything good iPhones are a great bit of kit.,5,2022/04/09
"Apple just keep making it easier to upgrade between their phones! The whole setup was effortless and face recognition is working well.
This is the first time I‚Äôve had an iPhone with no home button, but it‚Äôs very self explanatory and easy to use.",5,2021/12/08
"It is so pretty! the iphone 12‚Äôs design is so pretty in my personal opinion, it has amazing compatability with a lot of apps, the battery life seems good so far, i hope it stays like that

Update: Battery life has gone down so badly over the past year of having it, face ID has broken within 4-6 months of having the phone too üòê Apple has gone downhill IMO, I've upgraded since",3,2021/10/07
"Another year, another new iPhone and this time it is really a different from all iPhones before not only because supports 5G or of the new square design, but everything it‚Äôs new inside and out and looks and feels promising. Delivery from Amazon top notch only took 2 days. The phone itself works great, connectivity is much better than previous models and battery life is just as before, screen is crisp and colours are great, camera performance is excellent for day and night photos, stereo speakers are definitely the best of all phones I ever used, they simply deliver immersive sound that matches cinema experience. All in all Best iPhone to date. Negative: well the price is on the higher end but we all know that.",5,2020/10/30
"Upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus and its so so much better. Crystal clear screen. Better cameras front and back. Face recognition is fantastic, So far battery life is excellent only having to charge at night and even then its maybe down to 40% after using a lot during the day. Wireless charging makes life easy once you have the charge pads/stands. Thought id miss the home button but No its an excellent phone.",5,2021/06/29
"the last iphone i had was the iPhone 5SE. I then decided to switch to android. I had two Android smartphones over the last few years, one midrange and one top range but i was increasingly feeling dissatisfied with the Android experience.
i decided to upgrade to the latest iPhone and that decision has proved to be the right one. i am very satisfied with the iPhone 12. It is superb and thoroughly deserves to be called a smartphone. I couldn't be more pleased with it.",5,2021/04/25
Is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand.in your pocket too. It has quite good camera. The battery is not that bad. I charge it once a day and is enough for me. I listen to a lot of music during the day. This shows that it can handle daily tasks really easily.,5,2021/09/18

"Have been a Apple iPhone user for the last 10 years using a iPhone 6 which has never let me down, this upgrade to the 12 was a big step for me but after 3 weeks of using the new phone I am glad I purchased this phone it is fabulous and easy to use I would certainly recommend the iPhone 12.",5,2021/07/29
Bad experience getting this phone from amazon. Call started to drop after a year. Amazon products support did not help keeping telling me the stuff which is common i.e restart the phin. Turn the aeroplane mode and then off etc. I have got the phone which doesn't work and have paid full price for it. Should have gone to Apple directly üôÑ.,1,2022/10/30
My 8th iPhone and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Got it at a good price. Purple is actually really nice. And it was ¬£20 cheaper than the other colours.,5,2022/01/13
"It‚Äôs the first time to buy an Apple mobile phone on Amazon. I personally feel quite nervous, because I don‚Äôt know if it is really necessary to buy it on Amazon or go to the Apple store. Start with the mobile phone, everything is normal, the quality is guaranteed and it is worth buying.",5,2021/08/23
"I‚Äôd written off the idea of getting an iPhone after being disappointed with the iPhone 6 I had in the past but, after advice from family I ordered this and it‚Äôs perfect üëç",5,2021/12/25
Excellent phone no problems easy to set up,5,2022/03/10
The phone is great everything works fine just display is worse than on my iPhone 6s. A little yellowish. I was thinking to return it back but after I watched many videos on YouTube I decided to keep it as many people has similar problem. First time disappointed by Apple quality. Apple saying there‚Äôs nothing wrong with display it‚Äôs tuned by factory to yellowish tint and it‚Äôs still within specifications,3,2021/08/15
"The only thing against this phone is my face's ability to either mute the sound or facetime someone mid-call.

Apart from that battery life is excellent, face recognition is a real plus, and everything else works as well as you would expect an Apple product to.",5,2021/09/29
I‚Äôve always been an android user however this year I decided to treat myself to this Apple iPhone and it has not disappointed me wish I made the switch sooner.,5,2021/12/30
Wonderful product and genuine without a doubt,5,2022/03/02
Bought this on Amazon. Great price compared with competitors. Great phone.,5,2022/02/23
"I bought this for my wife to replace her 6S and she absolutely loves it.
The camera is superb and so is the quality when watching videos on YouTube.
It is a solid phone with superb features.
The lack of a charger I feel is irrelevant as you can use your old chargers anyway and the battery life is a massive improvement.
The lack of a headphone jack is also irrelevant to me as I bought an excellent adapter which works perfectly with wired headphones.",5,2021/02/10
"¬£750 overheats after playing cod for more than 30 mins, even with graphics set to low and frame rate set to medium. It may be graphically 40% faster but only when not playing games especially COD. Game plays better on a Samsung s8 which is 5 years old. Very very disappointed with playing games on this massively overpriced, over hyped iPhone.",3,2021/09/09
"It arrived the next day. The phone is slightly smaller than my old iPhone 8 Plus but it fits better in my hand now. The resolution is visibly better, not quite used to the face recognition yet but I‚Äôm sure I will get the hang of it",5,2021/09/13

"I‚Äôve just upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 12. Really pleased with it, very easy to use and very light. I am bias as I do prefer apple products to android.",5,2021/11/27
"Really substantial upgrade from my iPhone 8, which was already a fantastic piece of kit. Just miss the sleek, more compact profile of my old phone too... this one is chunky in comparison. Having said that, the battery life, camera and screen blow the iPhone 8 out of the water. It really is effortless to take great shots with these two cameras! The screen is just fantastic. Feels solid, which is good because it is going to be with me for a few years yet given how overpriced these things are.",5,2020/12/12
Fantastic phone. Went from iPhone 7 to this one and never looking back even though I loved my 7. Would not have any other product than Apple simply the best. So easy to use and everything just went from one phone to this other with no sweat or swearing!,5,2021/08/16
"Coming from an old ‚Äòwindow‚Äô based phone, I found the iPhone great to use.. although not as intuitive to set up or find my way around.",4,2021/06/28
"Great phone. Snappy sharp and feels like good high-end quality. I really like it. It‚Äôs actually a perfect screen size for functionality in all senses for everyone. Not too big, and not too small, perfect for general use; browsing, Instagram, etc and brilliant OLED screen for Netflix with support for Dolby Vision. It is bright and responsive and fast in all conditions, including sunlight viewing. Do genuinely recommend, even though it‚Äôs a bit pricey.",5,2021/02/08

"I am an Apple devotee, so, perhaps, slightly biased. As with all of the Apple products I have owned, superbly well made. Works and integrates with my other Apple products. Technology as it should be, in my view. One criticism, battery life could be better, but, I do get by with one charge per day.",5,2021/07/05

 The appearance of the iphone 12 series has changed alot this time,the camera has also been enchanced a lot.

The calculation and software have improved a lot, which is really great.especially the night shot taking is really good you can feel it on the screen,its tough level.

If you are pursuing excellent camera functions and like Apple highly integrated ecological chain,then iphone 12 series is a very good choice and the choice will not make u regret it.

"Got this for my wife for Christmas and she's enjoyed using it so far.

However as a Samsung Galaxy S fan, I must say that a 60fps screen is a bit strange for flagship tier phones in 2020/21.",4,2021/02/24

"Amazing phone, great looking and easy to use. Camera is also top quality. My first iPhone, always been a android guy but this has been a breath of fresh air and a good change.",5,2021/09/12
The Iphone12 is the best of the Iphones so far but the price is expensive ! However buying a sim free phone is cheaper in the long run as your not tied in on any contract! I am very happy with this phone you can do so much with it !,5,2021/06/06

 I bought this for my dad's birthday , the product description suggested its a ""New iPhone 12 128GB"", however it arrived in a brown Amazon box with bubble wraps inside. It didn't come with the official apple boxing and I have checked the serial number it was a refurbished iPhone.

Won't recommend, this is not a brand new iPhone.",1,2022/09/15
This is definitely the best iPhone I've owned and I've had them all since the iPhone 4 great build quality great battery life the screen looks amazing the stereo speakers are great too. The iPhone 12 doesn't come with charger or headphones which is a little disappointing but I use a wireless charger anyway so it didn't bother me . I usually go with product red but it looked a bit orange this year so got the blue version and I'm glad I did it looks stunning,5,2020/11/14
I purchased this for 650 which is the same as apple store price for a new iPhone. This was advertised as new. However in the confirmation email it said old- like new. Battery life 98%. I immediately cancelled the delivery.,1,2022/10/13
Was a Xmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.,5,2021/12/27
"Frankly it was not much of an improvement on my IPhone 7, which my wife now has. The challenge of transferring data is far worse than the Apple solution suggests as it does not transfer music not bought from Apple. In addition, the developers seem to live in their own world which assumes that users are all geeks.",3,2021/06/05

cool!!!!,5,2022/02/02
"5G on and off, used usb leads to charge which made sound muted, phone keep going headphones mode despite no headphones were attached. Requires phone to restart. Did not find Apple standard except the price which was as high as for Apple products.",3,2021/07/26
Not very good sound compared to Dolby on android but it is half the price of a top Samsung galaxy.Also could do with clearer display a bit of a let down but some apps are better and cheap for a 5 g mobile,4,2020/12/07
"Hi very pleased with my iphone 12 , very good screen size, and easy to use.",5,2021/11/13
The set up I had to do twice so make sure you update your old iPhone first. No instructions in box but lots of hints on phone. Took a while to work stuff out.,5,2021/08/15

"I was impressed with the delivery service, the phone arrived within 24hrs. Xfer of data from my iphone 6 was easy. Good phone at reasonable price.",5,2021/09/18
"Rip off. As has been said before, the lack of a charger is a total scam from Apple. Yes, Apple, you are reducing your carbon footprint and all that, but at the same time you are also making a tonne more revenue from accessory sales. If it was a genuine move, you'd supply a voucher code entitling buyers to order a charger for free. And the design to include a USB C cable? I mean what wall sockets have USB C? None. Who has a tonne of USB A power adaptors knocking around? Everyone. Simply including a cable that connects the phone to USB A would alleviate this issue, but no Apple in their wisdom assumes USB C is fine.

I have Macbook Pro which is generally fine and a phone could plug into that to charge, but I bought the phone for my teenage son. He'd never have an previous adaptor to use. I saw the light and switched to Samsung S series phones years ago. So his birthday present was almost useless out of the box - I wasn't even offered an upsell to get a charger at time of sale. I anticipate alot of moaning in the coming days as he slowly starts to realise other short comings of this overpriced phone, but for me the no charger/USB C cable thing is a complete joke. AVOID!",1,2021/06/30
Overall meets expectations,4,2021/06/30
I am still learning how to find the various features. Would appreciate an operating manual.,4,2021/05/06

"Okay - lots of good stuff: great camera, great speakers, amazing screen etc. But one huge flaw: one of the points of upgrading to 5G is that you should be able to ditch your wifi (provided you're in a 5G area). But, you can't, and here's why: you cannot back up your phone using 5G. This makes no sense, as 5G is often faster than wifi. So, that means I can't cancel my wifi that's costing me ¬£35 a month - just to back up my iPhone!",3,2021/01/24

Very happy with iPhone also safe,5,2021/12/08
"I never write reviews on amazon, this is my first but I felt it was necessary as the iPhone 12 is an expensive product and I had high expectations for it. Undoubtedly Apple will launch and revision but for those of you who are thinking of buying this product, perhaps wait until everyone else who has ""tested"" this product for apple and exposed the bugs have helped refine the next version.

Here are the issues I am experiencing:

- Phone network reception just drops sporadically and does not restore itself, you need to restart the phone
- Copy and paste does not work
- The face recognition is not user friendly due to face masks or sunglasses, the thumb reader would be better under the circumstances

If any of the above is a concern for you, consider something else.",2,2020/12/09

"I decided to upgrade from iPhone XR recently to IPhone 12, as I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had battery life/efficiency.

Normal use on my previous IPhone XR would take my battery life up to late evening from a full charge the previous night, which I was more than happy with.

Same charge on this IPhone 12 from Amazon gets me to about lunchtime. Totally disappointed in this product to say the least. I‚Äôve lost all confidence in purchasing from Amazon.

I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had a so much better battery efficiency which was the reason of my purchase/upgrade.

I can only assume this ‚Äònew‚Äô phone is a refurbished phone that no one else wanted and /or returned.

I‚Äôm actually trying to finish this review before the battery runs out. I kid you not.

If I could give this review zero stars I would.

"Let me repeat, it didn't last 1, single, solitary week.
Not 1.
It didn't last 3 days.
It lasted... 2... kinda.
Galway through the second it started turning off with no warning.
No problem, I'll just send it back... nah... Amazon don't like that. It's been over a month. I've talked to Amazon support more times in that period than I'd like to admit, more than I have to my grandparents. And they refuse to issue a refund. So, I have paid eight hundred pounds for the oh so enviable opportunity to peruse the Amazon support pages and struggle with their support team.

The phone is probably fine but, and I can't stress this enough:

DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!

Buy it from someone who accepts in person returns, like Apple or Curry's.

AVOID AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT ALL (and I do mean ALL) COSTS!",1,2021/03/19

"Bought this phone from Amazon on Prime Day - from a market place 3rd party seller sold 'via Amazon' and sadly discovered the phone had a 3rd party camera added to the phone and then sold as brand new.
How do we know? - Apple confirmed that the serial number of the camera was not a genuine Apple camera serial number when they ran diagnostics and so this phone camera will never work and this iPhone was corrupted despite being sold as brand new boxed and wrapped. I will never buy an Apple phone or high-value phone from Amazon but only from the direct Apple shop - in the future. I would advise anyone to proceed with caution after my experience.

"This phone i have only had a day and i have seen vast improvements to the older version of this phone and arguably the building blocks for this phone the iPhone 11. I bought the iPhone 11 and it was the replacement to my old iPhone XR. after having this phone for the short while i have the phone i have seen many aspects which make the upgrade worth it. This iPhone for starters has 5G and the phone also has a better chip. This Iphone has a new technology called super retina XDR display and this display is much better than the ones on the XR and 11 as they didn't even have the same pixel density as the iPhone 6! the other improvement is the the curved edges and this may sound like a weird point. However the phone is better looking and is more grippy to your hand, it also makes the phone feel newer as the older phones had slight curves in the screen which now look outdated. The sound quality is about the same as the 11 with stereo speakers. The next thing to point out is the bold colour choices, you can get plain white or black but there is also a purple, blue, green and red edition as well. I picked the blue colour and it is like a deep impact blue to the like of the blue you see many fords painted in the UK. The red is a slight salmon colour and you will think the phone is quite coral. the green is nice and looks minty. However the purple is a candy floss like colour and is a bold choice. However i don't think you will regret buying the purple one!. The last point of my review is the storage option and the base amount is 64GB and this is not enough if you have a lot of music and photos and apps then you will want the 128GB version at an extra ¬£50 to the base model. if you are a hardcore Iphone user and feel as if you need 256GB of storage then my advice would be not to buy the basic 12 and get the Pro or pro max and get the upgraded storage option. Yes you will pay a bit more however you will not regret it as the pro and the pro max add a ton more features and have the more classy stainless steel bands and have 3 cameras. So thats my advice hope it helps!",5,2021/05/04
Good price from Amazon. Speedy delivery.,5,2021/10/04
"I've always had cheaper Android phones, never wanted to spend Apple money. Not against the brand, but I don't like having expensive kit in my pocket. (I've had an old apple Ipad for years, so I'm not scared of Apple). Anyway, more recently I upgraded from a Huawei p20 lite - a ¬£200 phone) to an Iphone 11, mainly driven by the better camera and thought It‚Äôs about time I treated myself to something a little more expensive, as I've never broken or lost a phone in my pocket.
2 Weeks in and I'm still getting frustrated, I just can‚Äôt do the things I would expect from a phone!
My main gripes are:
*I have 25 Gb of photos on my Android, I just want to move them over. I don‚Äôt want my photos on the cloud, I have enough backups. I just want them physically on the iPhone. it seems the latest ios has blocked direct transfer from Windows (I can see the file, just cant paste to it). All other routes are extremely painful. Just let me drag and drop please!!!
*Same goes in reverse ‚Äì considering the main reason I bought the phone was for the camera. I own my photos, why can‚Äôt I just easily take them off my phone. I don‚Äôt want them in the cloud, I don‚Äôt want them hidden when I delete them. I want direct access to my own files please.
*This was my first IPhone, so I was expecting the transition to be nice. Open the box and no USB adapter??? There is a USB C lead, but who has a USB C charger? All my wall plates around the house are USB A. My car is USB A. My PC is USB A. great, so I need to spend another ¬£20 to use my phone, and another ¬£20 updating all my leads in my car, at work etc.
*To the above point, why isn‚Äôt this just a USB C standard?
*If transferring photos is difficult, everything else seems impossible. Absolutely no visibility of folder structure in windows.
*The phone is bulkier and a lot heavier than my P30 lite, and so far I haven't seen anything to benefit the extra mass or bulk.

I really wanted to love this phone, but so far all I want to do is just return it and go back to my old phone which is 1/3 of the price.",2,2021/04/04
Absolutely fantastic phone- can‚Äôt deny the quality and that‚Äôs why they are the price they are!!,5,2021/09/18
"Finally upgraded from iPhone 6s. Loving the speed, the screen, the camera‚Äôs Bokeh feature. Great phone. Bought it from John Lewis. To my disappointment they further reduced the price 2 days later. BUT I discovered they actually price match themselves and they gave me a refund of the difference - no quibbles. Excellent!",5,2021/09/07
"My first iPhone since the iPhone 6, so far I am very happy with it. Coming from android I was happy with the The user layout. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate the build quality of the phone is very sturdy and light but so light it‚Äôs at risk of feeling ‚Äúcheap‚Äù. This is really nitpicking. The phone‚Äôs snappy response means all tasks I throw at it are carried out smoothly and effortlessly.
Bad points: no charger is a pain in the backside! Not having a usb c powerbrick to hand meant I had to revert to an old iPad charger I luckily had. Why they went for a lightning port to usb C I will never know as it is the most pointless and least available connection. (At least to me) I have now swapped back to a lightning to usb 2.0 and normality is restored (yes the charging is not as fast anymore) overall a good purchase in my opinion but I might not be able to say the same If I was coming from an iPhone 11 or similar.

Overall, a good phone to consider if you are due an upgrade or like me have an older phone dying a horrid death! I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs others out there who will say Android is better and to be quite honest I believe both have their flaws and benefits.",5,2020/10/25
"Ignore the reviews from people who haven‚Äôt bought one, that‚Äôs laughable. Yes the phone doesn‚Äôt come with headphones or a power plug but it‚Äôs hard to believe you would really need another power plug if you‚Äôre in the market for this phone. Just wasted plastic at this point. Having said that I did upgrade to a usb-c power plug and it charges from dead to full in 1hr 30 and fast charges to 50% in 30 minutes, the battery also holds charge a lot longer than a phone you‚Äôre likely to be upgrading from like an old 7, 8, X. The most impressive feature is the camera with night mode and wide angle. The Oled screen is also stunning especially if you turn the lights off and watch a Dolby vision video. This will be the phone that people own for 5+ years without needing an upgrade. When you think the iPhone X was released at ¬£1000, this is a much more refined product and coming in ¬£200 cheaper.",5,2020/11/28

Overall the design on the apps and UI (user interface ) feels nicer to the eye and more snappy the oled screen is great for dark gritty films.

"Hi
Ok i havent purchased an iphone 12 ...but here are the reasons why and what people interested in purchasing should know :

1) there is no charger in the box, you get a lightning to usb c cable, not even a standard lightning usb cable, so if you havent owned an iphone before you WILL have to buy a new adapter as the cable provuded in the iphone 12 box WILL NOT work with a standard iphone plug, so thats an extra 20 odd quid

2) there are no earphones in the box either.. it really makes me laugh out loud when i think a premium priced product has been watered down so much..so add another 20 odd pounds for a new pair of earphones

The phone itself is just a larger version of an iphone 5..bezels prone to chipping

Im really dissapointed with apple, that they are watering down all theiir produxts and claiming a clean footprint...so new users who havent owned an iphone for a few years have to fork out close to ¬£60 extra for earphones and a chsrger

Even if apple gave a discount on a charger purchase when buying thr iphone it would have been slightly better but no...

not good..not good at all",1,2020/11/04

Most people who buy these have already looked up the spec so I won‚Äôt go into that side, but I do know you will enjoy using this beautiful phone and all it‚Äôs features.
There are some cheaper very good phones out there, but I like the reliability of Apple phones and they are always in good enough working condition to pass down to grandchildren when you upgrade",5,2021/03/04
Cannot go wrong with an iPhone. Always have them and would recommend to anyone,5,2021/04/08
"It was time to retire my 6s after many years of loyal service.
I kept waiting for Apple to bring the fingerprint back but as it wasn‚Äôt happening got this one.
Great phone otherwise but the face recognition doesn‚Äôt work half the time. It‚Äôs a problem in the shops, in the dark, when wearing a hat and sunglasses and sometimes just for no reason at all. Please bring back the fingerprint!

Why Apple and not Samsung or any other phone brand? Cause of security! And because they stand up to Facebook and other companies that want your private data to sell you more stuff and make money off of you! Google for example should give their phones to people for free seeing how much they ‚Äúspy‚Äù on their users.",4,2021/11/15
Great battery life nice looking feels strong easy to use,5,2022/02/18
"My daughter is very happy with this phone.
Compared to her X, this is super fast, and styled like the 5c she had way back.
Usual Apple quality.",5,2020/11/05
"I am an iPhone user and I‚Äôve had iPhones since the 3G version many, many years ago.
This is my 1st with an OLED screen. For me personally, iPhones have gotten a bit chunky over the last few years and have gotten thicker each year since the 6 and 6S.
The iPhone 12 is only 7.4mm thick with a super glossy 6.1‚Äú screen which reminds me of the iPhone 4 with its straight aluminium sides and for me it‚Äôs perfect.
I have small hands and this is probably a little bit big for me to use comfortably but I think that 6.1‚Äù is the perfect size screen for trolling the net and using Safari so I‚Äôll put up with having to use 2 hands every now and then.
The battery is comparable to the XR I had previously and the blue colour matches my Apple Watch 6 perfectly.
I bought the 128gb version to help with resale prices next year but 64GB for me would have been enough as I still have 102gb free after 2 months use. (As a guide I have 79 songs, 3 videos and 169 photos, I‚Äôm certainly not a heavy user! )
If you are reading this and are thinking of buying one, the iPhone 13 will be out in a few months and it‚Äôs expected to have a slightly faster processor and a different camera arrangement and new colours. It may be the 12S, it may be the 13, but in my opinion you can always miss a year out.
This phone is well made, takes great photos and has a sublime screen with iMessage as well as 5G (which I‚Äôve tried using O2) and the benefit of the best App Store in the world. Buy it and enjoy the Apple experience.",5,2021/07/29
" I have an iphone 11 and am very happy with it, I purchased an iphone 12 for my wife as a Birthday present and have been comparing the 2 phones, I really like feel of the iphone 11 which is an aluminium frame the iphone 12 does not have the same premium feel, it is a lot lighter in the hand, the 11 has rounded edges whereas the 12 has flat.

Speed wise using you cannot tell a difference, we are both using 4G, when my wife changes her contract and opts for one with 5G her smartphone will be a lot faster.

Both smartphones outperform the cheaper brands when receiving text messages, and Whatsapp and also email messages.",4,2021/03/13
A fantastic product to use. Data transfer was a breeze. Battery life is excellent. A couple of minor glitches in software which I am sure will be fixed in future releases e.g. during a WhatsApp video call if you toggle between screens then video keeps dimming after every few seconds.,5,2021/06/06
"I don‚Äôt know what's going on with my iphone. Some apps stop working normally for a few minutes and today, out of nowhere it was running half a screen for a few seconds and restarted alone. However, I want a new device and not have it repaired because I bought it on March 24th. I await answers and that my problem is solved. Thanks.",1,2021/04/26

"iPhone 12 is so easy to open using face recognition , compared with the iPhone 7 with finger print opening , which never works!",5,2021/04/23
"Great phone, amazing screen and just easy to use. Best feature of iPhones is the software and all the integrations with Apple products. I personally would have liked a bigger battery as it goes down relatively fast when using 5g during the day. But overall I must admit that for the average user (me) iPhone never lets you down.",5,2021/01/17

"My brother was looking for the ""mini"" version of this but it was sold out everywhere, so I helped him buy this one and he's very happy with it still. :D",5,2021/05/30
Perfect,5,2021/04/02
Overpriced hype. Can‚Äôt see any difference between this and the iPhone 8. Not worth upgrading or maybe try Samsung. I think I will.,1,2021/04/05
There are plenty of reviews for iPhone 12's out there so I'll stick to the Amazon experience. The price undercuts purchasing direct. One day later I got a SIM-free iPhone 12 in the branded box ready to stick my own SIM straight in. Worked like a dream and I spent less than buying direct - especially as I was happy to get the blue as it was a bit cheaper for some reason (but who cares when it spends all its life in a case!).,5,2021/09/02
I bought especially for esim support but Three UK is not supporting although they claim that they have on their website,5,2021/01/06
