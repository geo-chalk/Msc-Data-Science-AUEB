Lovely pair of trainers,5,2020/08/18
Loved the shoes I won Christmas,5,2022/12/24
The shoes arrived and the box was crushed pretty bad which is kind of a bummer because you like to keep the Jordan box but the shoes are OK,4,2022/11/09
These are a perfect fit even with wide feet. The size 12 worked great.,5,2022/12/02

Such a classy and traditional sneaker for work.,5,2022/11/19
My son liked the fit and style. He swears he can jump higher in them.,5,2022/11/13
"For the many saying they run small, I've found if you break them in and loosen the laces up they fit well. I usually have to buy extra wide.",5,2022/10/23
"I like how quick I got these but the fit was smaller than expected, othere than that everything went well",4,2022/07/27
My son like them,4,2022/08/17
These are so comfortable and the size was perfect. Very light on your foot and can keep on your foot for a good 24hrs without any feeling of discomfort. I highly recommend that you also get a pair yourself. 5 star all the way,5,2022/09/24
Pleased with the purchase!,5,2022/10/30
I don't understand the hype with nike shoes. I've bought 3 pairs and they're all uncomfortable. These are no exception. The tounge wraps around in the inside of the shoe and irritates my foot. Can't wear them for more than a few hours before I have to take them off.,3,2022/10/02
"Nice looking, but narrow.",4,2022/07/26
Everything fix my Husband to a T.,5,2022/10/20
My litlle boy love this tennis.,5,2022/10/03
"I bought these shoes just to casually wear, and they are now my favorite shoes. They fit great, are highly comfortable, and look amazing. I would highly recommend.",5,2022/08/29
Good,5,2022/09/30

"Product was as advertised. Gifted for relative. Loves the shoes. For Jordan Shoes fanatics, not the cheapest nor the most expensive, but fits budget for average consumer.",5,2022/05/17
Me encanto,5,2022/09/07
"My intention was to immediately wear this shoe to the gym. It is a great looking shoe that I do not want to scuff. Therefore, I will most likely only wear it on special occasions until it is thoroughly worn and ready for gym use.",5,2022/06/02
Great fast delivery good quality products,5,2022/08/22
It's an excellent bargain for the quality of the product,4,2022/03/12
Comodas,5,2022/08/31
" I LIKE THE QUALITY OF THE SHOES. THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE. ONLY, THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIZED RIGHT AND LEFT. I THINK IT WAS JUST AN ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION. OVERALL I WILL BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE THEM FOR A DIFFERENT PAIR.",5,2022/05/22
"The shoes are nice but my son doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúwide foot‚Äù yet these are still very slim and hard to get on even after loosening the shoe strings. He did eventually get them on and they didn‚Äôt hurt once on. Otherwise, nice shoe.",4,2021/10/20
I really like these shoes they are lite and look great. I wear a 10.5 and ordered a 11 glad I did they fit exact so order a 1/2 size up if you buy them.,5,2022/05/22
"Muy c√≥modas, excelente la calidad y la entrega a tiempo a Antofagasta-Chile.",5,2022/07/27
Very nice,5,2022/08/18
I love the shoes but unfortunately for me the stated size was inadequate . Too small the toe box was cramped and I was unable to use the pair of these wonderful shoes .,3,2022/05/09
Very thin not sure if they are authentic.. but new and clean,2,2022/11/30
"The fit is too tight. AND, it looked like a knockoff ! I wear an 11 1/2 and I ordered a 12. The fit was still too tight. Be nice if it came in a D. I gave them to my son who has slightly smaller feet and they fit him just fine. This is the second pair that was too tight. I will not buy any more Nikes' on lione.",3,2022/01/18
Playing,5,2022/07/30
"My kid needed a basketball shoe but found this one very hard to pull on and off. He liked the styling but we ended up returning it because it seems like it runs small even though we got a size bigger than normal. Bonus, the local Dunhams had basketball shoes for half the price of this one.",3,2021/12/25
I need to exchange for another Michael Jordan‚Äôs shoes,3,2022/05/02
"Excelentes tenis, son originales, yo soy en nike 11.5 y me quedaron perfectas, excelente compra",5,2022/04/20
Shoes look like cheap plastic. For $150 bucks paid I believe these are cheap knockoffs,3,2022/02/21
"Not leather, I believe these are knock offs.",3,2022/02/12
"Though I like the shoe but the with was way too tight for a US size 11"". Truth be told can't just wear it I will be giving it to my younger brother.",3,2021/11/02
"Decepci√≥n, no son originales y en ning√∫n lugar vi que no lo fueran. Hasta que los recib√≠ me di cuenta y creo que por unos cuantos dolares m√°s, hubiera valido la pena pagar unos originales. Ya revis√© en la tienda nike.",1,2022/11/18
Just good shoes,5,2022/04/18
very good,5,2022/04/21
These are the most comfortable and well fitting shoes I‚Äôve had in a long time. The colors are super vibrate and they last for a long time. 10/10 will recommend,5,2021/10/25
Shoes looked great and were in perfect condition,5,2022/02/12
This product fit awkward across the toes and not that comfortable.,2,2022/08/03
"These shoes are really slim and form fitting. After one hour of use, my feet were throbbing. I am going to dump these shoes and go with a different brand. No arch support or heal support whatsoever. Never buying Nike basketball shoes again.",1,2022/10/20
Nothing,5,2022/03/17
"Love the shoes! They did fit a bit tight at first, but after wearing for a few occasions they fit better. üî•üî•üî•",5,2021/11/12
"The shoe is extremely narrow. I have to return it. I have narrow feet, and I can't even get my foot in it.",2,2022/06/08
I like the comfort in the tennis shoe,5,2022/01/06
Very satisfied.,5,2022/02/14

"Shoes came in an unmarked box by themselves. not a Jordan feel, not a Air Max look, strictly Fugazi.",1,2022/10/15
fastshipping and fit size,5,2021/11/03
Nothing to dislike. These shoes are awesome.,5,2021/09/18
Big disappointment the Air Jordans were fugazi's I kicked them to the curve I wouldn't even walk on the court with those sneakers.,1,2022/09/05
Demasiado peque√±o y esperaba que fuera m√°s mejor y original,2,2022/02/19

I wasn't happy .,1,2022/09/11
if you want a pair of jumpmans not jordans you found your shoe!,1,2022/08/08
Esta muy angosto de los lados. La c√°lida est√° buena pero est√°n apretados,2,2021/10/16
I couldn't wear them cause they were to small at the top too narrow,1,2022/05/08
"the sneakers were excellent. but i was sent size 11 instead of size 8
when i re ordered the size 8, i was charged $60 more.
that is neither good or ethical.",1,2021/12/27
"Item came opened, had rubber bands on the box and did not say air on them. Not certain they are real. Should have gone to a store.",1,2022/02/21
