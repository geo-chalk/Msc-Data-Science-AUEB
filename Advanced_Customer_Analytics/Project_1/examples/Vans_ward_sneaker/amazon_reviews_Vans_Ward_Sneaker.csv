"Size 11 UK and they fit perfectly, the same as all my other Vans.

Seen some people call them “fake” they are 100% genuine. These aren’t old schools they are Wards so slightly different, the only difference being “Vans” on the tongue.

Compared them to another pair of Vans and they are identical in every way in both look and feel.

Wore these on a recent city break which involved a lot of walking, heavy rain etc and they are perfect. Same as all other vans, very comfortable and durable.

The price is simply unbeatable! Will be picking up a few more pairs.",5,2022/11/19
"Brought these on the bfs,they come very next day delivery was quick.i usually take a 7.5 but these are fairly big but nothing a couple pairs of socks won't handle so if you are after don't get extra half.but yeh overall brilliant shoe always had vans",5,2022/11/27
Thankyou,5,2022/12/20
"Everything you'd expect from Vans. Quality materials, well made and as comfortable as ever",5,2022/12/11
These trainers looked durable & are very sturdy looking. Good thick bottoms for longevity & comfortable. Definitely keep feet dry in wet weather.,5,2022/12/02

"I love Vans shoes, these are the classic design in my view. Good value, high quality. Will definitely buy again.",5,2022/10/24
"They feel quite heavy but give a light step to walking, easy on and off.

Just one grumble, they still smell like a cobblers shop after a month. I only wear them twice a week, it should go in the fullness of time.",4,2022/07/14
"Would prefer it to be made of suede for longer life durability but canvas is fine, will just have a shorter life span",4,2022/07/04
"Seen a lot of reviews calling these shoes fake but the truth is everything checks out. Stitching is great, comfort is good, material feels authentic. Even checked online to see how to spot fake ones and couldn't. Came packaged properly warped in paper in the vans box and with it's vans tag. These shoes are spot on.

From what I believe a lot of these reviews calling them fake are rival retailers hoping to boost business, so I'd take it with a grain of salt.

If anything changes I'll update this review.",5,2022/06/24
"All as it should, size runs true",5,2022/10/04
The shoes looks quite good and seem genuine. But my god it feels horrible to wear. I can literally not feel my foot after 30 minutes because of how poorly thin the sole is. Definitely would not recommend,3,2022/09/03
Value for money,5,2022/09/28
"Great looking shoes, however side walls are already peeling away from fabric where shoe naturally bends when walking and there is a lot of rubbing at the base of the toes.",3,2022/08/14
"Overall these are very close to the Vans Old Skool. The big drawback is the insole is much harder and offers almost no padding on the heel meaning extended wear can be quite uncomfortable.
Sole isn't removable unlike the Old Skool so you will be limited to the in built sole.",3,2022/07/22
My son loves them,5,2022/09/10
"Wanted something different than I usually wear, got a size 12 which took a little time to break in but fit perfectly and so comfortable.",5,2022/08/03
Fits narrow. Feels tight on the sides and looks like a boat from viewpoint.,3,2022/08/26
"A tiny bit big. Could have gone half a size down even though they are true to size apparently. Thick socks will do the job but I wont be wearing them when it's hot. Might not be a problem. I got a good deal when they were on sale, so swings and roundabouts.

Anyway first I was worried they were going to be fake as ward are strange Van's as Van's don't actually sell them on their site. But when I got them I did all the tests and they passed all of them, including the barcode being right and the clk on the sole and sticker inside and outside the box. So all good. I will probably save these till autumn and get them waterproofed.

The shoes a pretty much old schools but have tiny differences like the Van's logo on the tongue and some of the stitching patterns are a bit different.

All in all a good day to day shoe. Just like old schools and cheaper.

When you get yours do the barcode test, benable test (sole should bend easy at end of toe cap) and the sole code check and your good to go.

Eg mine had CLK on one panel on the sole, then a little round sticker inside the top of the box and on the barcode on the outside of the box and your safe

Good purchase

Walking and every day use,5,2022/07/11
"Very nice, comfortable shoes that are easy to style. The only issue I've had is that the glue holding the sole is not that strong. I've worn my shoes everyday for about a week and the glue is starting to break already on the side. Not an awful problem but it's a bit annoying.",4,2021/11/14
I bought them for my son. He rates them.,5,2022/07/05
I'd read a few reviews stating that the Vans were fake. I can say that these are 100% genuine. I'm a big collectors of various styles of Vans and these are some of the comfiest Vans I've ever worn. They look amazing and something different than what everyone else has with the gum soles. Would definitely recommend them,5,2022/03/14
It was exactly what i thought is wad going to be and I am happy with it,4,2022/02/17
Can’t go wrong with a pair of vans. The shoes are perfect and packaged really well. Best shoes you can buy for the price!,5,2022/06/06

Brilliant in every way,5,2022/06/05
They were a gift for my boyfriend and he loved them !,5,2022/05/22
"I've always thought that Van's are overpriced for their quality and comfort when compared with other brands. Nevertheless my son likes to wear them, so I'm always looking out for them at good prices.
These fit the bill completely. They arrived on time, in the expected Van's box, with genuine tags and code numbers.
Genuine Van's at a bargain price and everyone is happy.",5,2021/12/10

,3,2022/02/19
"The fit is perfect it is my usual size. I love vans just calssic staple of shoes goes with pretty much every outfit, easy to maintain. I highly recommend you get these especially when they are on sale or have an offer. P.s. they are a little flat so be weary of that and not waterproof/resistant like airforces.",4,2020/12/03
A little disappointed in these Vans. I had a similar pair around 5 years ago. This latest pair seem to have a lot more room in them even though I purchased the same size. My biggest gripe us that the tongue is not padded and is quite stiff. They rub whilst driving. Also the sole is hard and not so flexible. Great for durability but it makes a slapping sound on hard surfaces which I find annoying. I bought these as a change from Converse all stars. I wish I hadn't.,3,2021/04/18
Very pleased with them received the next day thank-you,5,2022/02/02
I have been buying Vans for years. In this case within 3 months this rubber edge has started to peel away when I bend the shoe. I have other similar pairs that have taken years to start doing this,2,2022/06/15
"Looks great, wearing right now! Fit is perfect and no complaints on size or look.

Value is in the brand, the typical length of wear is upwards of a year or two of wear every other day. I walk 1hr a day, so I'd say that these could last upwards of two years and still look good with their quality.",5,2021/05/19
"im not a shoes freak, but these vans are simply the best fits perfect very affordable and the colours are exactly in person. i have at least 10 pairs of these bad boys and still counting. love them",5,2021/08/20
My son is very pleased with these shoes.,5,2022/01/12
"i am well happy with these trainers especially when there're hard to get in size 13. i've looked for years and i couldn't be more happier to get them at that price, i'm tempted to get another pair if i can.",5,2021/07/19
These shoes are not FAKE! Great fit and look.,5,2021/12/23
Bit expensive but no more than in store.,5,2021/12/27

Son loves them,5,2022/01/03
"Great fit and look good.
This classic design is a popular choice and look good with whatever I'm wearing. Someday I'll replace these with another pair.",4,2021/02/10
"I already had a pair of vans that looked almost identical to these. However, these felt bigger and cheaper. Almost feel like a fake but don't know if they really are.",2,2022/05/14
Look dope but I’ve had to send my first pair back after they started to become unstuck at the seems. I’ve had a replacement pair sent and the same has happened . Can’t see how to return the replacements. Really bad for a nearly £60 trainer .,1,2022/08/18
"Great little shoe. Well known for decades. IMO you should go for the ""cush"" option that has more cushioning as standard these are not comfortable shoes. I buy these and put gel insoles in to make up for it 😊",4,2020/05/12
"Good comfy shoes but they don't last well enough for skating. Rubbed against my left heel for a few days until a callous formed. No cushioning in the sole, treasd is shallow and wore away quickly. Fine for dossing about in but NOT skate shoes. Fitment was OK for once as Vans are reknowned for irregular sizing.",3,2021/02/16
Comfy fashionable as always Gr8 fit,5,2021/11/11
"good product, but I hope those ones will have a longer life span compare to my previous Vans C&L 59.
Usually I can keep a pair of era 59 for 1entire year, but had to change my C&L 59 after 6 months.
I think thoses ones will have a longer life span due to their increased thickness",4,2019/08/07
Superb for big feet,5,2021/11/06
"Definitely don’t fit like your standard old skools, these aren’t a fake they’re just a different style of vans but the tongue has a tendency to slip to the side constantly. Might be better style for someone else but not for me unfortunately!",4,2020/01/19
"They look great and turned up in perfect condition. Had the thread the laces myself as they aren't threaded at all. They were a bit stiff the first few times I wore them and caused a few pinches and rubs but after that they're perfectly fine. Very comfortable and feel suprisingly sturdy. Would definitely recommend.

Edit: Updated to 5 stars as these are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn yet they feel sturdy too.",5,2019/09/19
"Very nice pair , look really good and good value for the money",5,2022/12/08
"Really pleased with these for the price, needed some vans to add to the wardrobe and they do exactly that, I won't wear the. All the time because I find the canvas material can rub your feet at times but pleaser with that.",5,2021/03/06
They last a really long time I've even worn them to school as school shoes and they didnt break once I've pretty much worn them everywhere and not even a scratch really good and really recommend them,4,2020/04/13
"My first pair of vans; impressed with the quality, comfort & fit. Really pleased & would definitely by another pair.",5,2021/07/14
"I have worn Vans for over 30 years and they are still one of my favorite shoes to wear, they are none slip and tend to last for ages. They are well made and dry fast when they get wet. I usually wear Lot-tops as I find they are a great fit.",5,2020/07/08
Bought these men's Vans as a gift. Trainers were as described and size true to that advertised. Quick delivery service from seller. Delighted recipient.,5,2021/06/01
"Fantastic trainers, stylish and comfy, no breaking in required and so much cheaper than the Vans site.
Perfect.",5,2021/06/26
Good product with affordable prize but must check the size chart before ordering. As it’s got the flat sole so I must say it’s good for hitting leg days at gym must order.,5,2021/01/30
I've been wearing these for 20 plus years..they never fail,5,2021/07/25
"I have worn these every day since I got them and they're so comfortable. I walk a lot and they survived a 4+ mile walk in the middle of a heatwave.
The rubber has started to split a bit near where my toes bend but that's to be expected because they're being used ... literally everyday hah.
Worth the money and I recommend Vans to anyone!",5,2019/08/25
Ordered size 9 and perfect fit. Very comfortable!,5,2021/08/02
I used to wear converse shoes and replace them when they wore out. I started to realise I was replacing them far too frequently. Vans make shoes that hold up for a lot longer and feel better. This classic design is a popular choice and look good with whatever I'm wearing. Someday I'll replace these with another pair.,5,2019/11/28
Exactly what i ordered. Delivered a day earlier than expected. Over all really pleased,5,2021/06/29
"Good quality, good value ... true to size as well which is rare I am finding.",4,2020/07/02
Just i expected comfy and perfect fit,5,2021/06/30
"Great product. Only issue was the right shoe had white marks on them. It wasn't too noticeable so I just wore them anyway.

I am sure it was just due to the way they had been transported as the box was crushed.

Apart from that they fit fine and are as expected.",3,2020/05/29
Great price and good service.,1,2022/09/15
Look really nice on. Just took afew weeks to get used too as it would rub at the back of my foot and bleed. But once broken in. Are fine.,4,2019/09/30
"Only had them a day, but they good and at a decent price. Been buying Vans for a while and they fit as expected.",5,2021/04/07
Very comfortable shoes. Fit exactly to my shoe size. Quick delivery.,5,2021/06/20
"Perfect fit, They have gave me blisters on back of my feet but that could just be because they are new they need wearing in, So your choice want a bit of pain to get them to fit here you go.",5,2020/05/30
"Great shoes, love vans. Fit great, they’re comfortable and just all round a great shoe to own. Look smart and clean. Would recommend 👍🏼",5,2021/03/13

"Brought for my partner for Xmas, he gets through his trainers very quickly normally. Had since Xmas still look amazing. Really good budget shoes",5,2021/02/16
"If you know your vans then you’ll see these are blates fakes , but saying that they are very good fakes . And for half price of originals . They will be worn only around the house so won’t be able to comment as to wear and tear. I will continue to wear my originals outdoors. So I don’t know how long they would last up against real ones",3,2019/05/29
Perfect!,5,2021/07/26
"Absolutely in love with these, as soon as i got them i put them on (with nowhere to go) they're stylish, comfortable and go with almost any outfit. Would definitely recommend.",5,2020/08/22
Great shoes. And perfect size. My husband is very happy with it. Great and fast delivery.,5,2021/03/21
Got these shoes to use a skateboard with mostly and just do casual city walking and things like that but I found they were not comfortable at all Very rigid I’ve worn dress shoes that were more comfortable,3,2020/05/23
Good casual footwear,4,2020/07/09
"Great shoe but I got it half a size too big, so it doesn’t fit me yet",4,2019/10/17

"Disappointed, bought as a gift ,no vans box ,no little red card attached and they the vans were already laced up like they were returns.

Everything about it,5,2021/04/15
Completely fake so high priced because of that fact. Not easy to spot unless you look for it or know. Stitching is wrong and the stripe is wrong to. Vans logo on the tongue shouldn’t be there. Comfortable though but poorly priced as not genuine!! Extra tenner or so for the real deal,3,2019/03/14
good service very comfortable,5,2021/03/14
"Like other reviews, I was initially concerned these were fake, however following the checks (barcodes, sole stamp and bendable) my fears were allayed. As usual with vans, great fit and look good.",5,2019/12/07
"Brilliant product, exactly what I was expecting!",5,2020/12/07
"Very sore on the heels. Both heels blistered within a short walking distance. Like my DrMartins will tape my heels till they're broken in.

Didn't expect that with a canvas shoe!",3,2019/12/08
Comfortable and classic. You can't get better than that. Great price too. I'm an 8 so I bought an eight and they fit like a glove. Perfect.,5,2020/01/27

"Exactly what I expected or hoped for- a pair of Van's in the style and size I requested, nothing mind blowing",5,2020/03/14
"Just avoid buying this product, spend a little more and get it from a high street shop. I'm very disappointed.",2,2021/09/28
"Crap. Utter crap. So uncomfortable, I absolutely hate myself for this purchase. May well be genuine, but boy oh boy. These do not even compare.",1,2022/04/07
"Usually go into shops to purchase shoes, but with the discount for black Friday, it was too good a deal to refuse. I went for a 1/2 bigger size than normal for this order as vans are slightly tighter than other shoes I find for me.",5,2018/11/22
comfort,5,2021/03/11
Always had three for skating great,4,2019/06/12
Classic style and very comfortable. I own lots of pairs of Vans and these are exactly what I expected them to be. Less stitching than the Old Skool vans too,5,2019/09/07
"The shoes are great as always. However mine arrived with countless little scuffs around the sole that I can’t clean off. It’s hard to capture these on camera but they’re very obvious in person. I’m aware this isn’t the end of the world, it’s just a bit annoying when you buy a new pair of shoes that they’re already scuffed up.",2,2020/11/27
Great to get a classic at such a good price,5,2020/07/09
"Pretty much the same as the old skool ones. They fit the exact same just a bit cheaper, and the quality is exactly the same!",5,2019/10/29
Dislike,5,2021/01/21
"Ordered for myself (female) as I have quite wide feet, and they fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Good quality and so far no damage after a few months daily wear.",5,2019/07/21
"I have purchased this good looking pair of shoes one week ago. After 3 days of wearing them on my usual daily activity*, there was already a hole in the shoes! It has now been 1 week and the hole is getting bigger and bigger.

I had already been disappointed when I bought a pair ofvans last time, where the shoes lasted 2 weeks because the glue around the rubber was weak so the rubber came off after wearing them a few times.

I will go back to my usual other Skateboarding-style shoes which last usually 6 months, not 2 weeks.

Really disappointed, I completely lost trust in your band.

*My usual daily activity is cycling 30 minutes while commuting, playing 15 minutes of ping-pong, and walking like a normal person, nothing that could explain the hole.",1,2019/09/05
Very good quality and they are real for people who are concerned,5,2020/06/01
Perfect for son for school. Good sturdy shoe.,5,2020/08/09
I love it it’s little bit big that was my problem I don’t order the right size anyway thank you 🥰,5,2019/12/06
"Bit too narrow for me.
I've had other vans that were no problem but even half a size a size up was still quite narrow for me.",3,2019/09/06
Ordered the wrong size! My own mistake. Returns and replacement was fast and easy process. Would definitely recommend,5,2020/01/08
5 star product,5,2020/11/04

Great shoes and I got them at a great price while they were on offer. Recommended 🙂,5,2020/01/04
We seem to believe these are not genuine Vans. Not sure if I read the advert incorrectly but I’m pretty sure it didn’t say anywhere that they are replicas.,1,2022/01/28
"Comfy, wear these every day. As you'd expect if you've ever worn vans before",5,2020/02/14
"Really cool trainers, a slightly cheaper alternative to the Old skool Vans but definitely look the business and are very comfortable.",5,2019/10/10
Zero complaints,5,2020/10/20

"I was extremely excited to put on my very first Vans shoes, then I got to wear them. I mean, the quality and size was great but the back of the shoe kept hurting my feet. My feet had been bruised after taking a walk to the grocery store. Consequently, I had to get a refund, thanks anyway.",2,2020/07/02

"Look good, feel good",4,2019/01/07
"Not sure if I ordered the wrong type; but not as good as the last pair I bought in a Vans high street shop.

These are basically plimpsoles. The ones I bought from a vans shop had an insole which is super comfy and the sides and back (around the ankle) are all padded; whereas these are not.
No vans tag on the side and red rubber logo already falling off (after 2 days of wearing them around my office!) Have me questioning if they are authentic or not.",2,2018/11/07
Bought them for hubby .good price amazing quality arrived before Christmas.,5,2020/01/05
"Wanted them for a while, great fit and look! However I’ve worn them about 4/5 times and the sole on the inside of the show has started to tear away and is causing great pain on my heels.",3,2018/10/09
"Nice present for teenage boy, wears well and still looks good",5,2019/12/30
Exactly as described,5,2020/07/07
Very poorly made. The suede has split along the seam. We are outside the return window and cannot find contact details for the vendor. They were a Xmas gift and have had a few wears but not extreme. We have pairs much older that are truest bartered and have not split anywhere. Amazon needs to step in where good are faulty,1,2021/04/05
it is nice,5,2020/07/03
The shoes are super comfortable and the ordered size fits great. The workmanship is impeccable. I hope I can wear the shoe for a long time,5,2019/02/14

"They're not comfy at all, they're like the cheap shoes you buy at primark. The back rubbed my ankles to the point that they bled, never had a pair of vans that were this bad so I don't think they're genuine. Definitely only buy from the vans site or store in future.",2,2020/04/25

Great product at a great price,5,2019/12/29
No complaints on fit or speed of delivery as they were spot on. My big problem is that after a couple of months of wear there is an inexplicable rip that’s developed on the top of the shoe (only describe it as the rim of the shoe). Now having worn vans for years I know they are very durable and sadly in this instance they haven’t been. And I’ve not been able to get in contact with anybody to discuss this further. It’s not as if I’ve stress tested these shoes as I work an office job and wear them to work so there’s no reason they should be falling apart this early on.,1,2019/03/13
Nice comfortable on my feet 13hrs a day.,5,2019/11/04

You cant go wrong with black classic vans,5,2020/10/20
"I have never owned a pair of Vans before and used to having Converse and Superdry canvas shoes. I was unsure about the look of them before they arrived however quickly changed my view on them once I tried them on. I am a size 9 and they fit perfectly although I had to open up the laces in order to get my foot in to begin with.

The shoes are made of a canvas side where the white strip is and a suede toe and heel so be sure to protect them with a suede protector.

They are extremely comfortable and very well made, even better than the converse shoes I own. They can get a little hot when walking around as there are no vent holes and in warmer temperatures your feet can get pretty sweaty especially as these are a dark colour too.

I tend to wear them with a dark jean as that’s what they seem to go best with and they could also pass for a smarter shoe than casual if you were going out in the evening.

The rubber bottom has hexagon and diamond grip which is perfect for picking up loose stones but a they are pretty thick I couldn’t feel them digging into my foot.

In Summary, very comfortable and very well made, if the design is to your taste you won’t go wrong with these.",5,2018/08/02
"What I love most about these shoes is that anyone can wear them. I remember getting my first pair of Van's as a teenager and 20 years later Van's still have the same great style and comfort. This particular design is very popular at the moment and I think the reason is they look great with everything. Van's are well made and are so comfortable, you just can't go wrong.",5,2019/07/24
"Love the vans brought from Amazon, so easy to keep clean and at a great fit. They had my size in stock which was great and easy for me to order.",5,2019/08/22
"I normally take a seven and a half shoe size, but these Vans Canvas Low-Top Sneakers were a size eight - lucky that they were, because they fit fine, and a seven and a half would be too snug. As other reviewers have stated, these are very similar to the venerable Converse tariners - canvas uppers, rubber soles - and as such, you may want to add odor eaters in them, because your feet will perspire in them (Unlike Converse, they don't come with piereced ventialtion holes). That being said, I think the manufacturing quality is a step up from Converse, and they look really cool, even on a duffer in late middle age like me. I've not had them long, so I don;t know how long they'll last, but I am very pleased with them so far.",4,2018/08/01
"These Vans Ward shoes are a low top canvass sneaker style shoe with the classic quality and comfort of a Vans shoe.

The shoes are solid and feel like they will be hard wearing. I have found all of my Vans to be very hard wearing and these won't be an exception from what i can see.

They have a thick and comfortable sole and feel bouncy and supportive.

I'm a big fan of Vans and have never been let down by them, with several pairs in my collection. I tend to have more of the classic skateboard shoes but these sneakers make a nice addition the range

They look quite casual with their patterned styling but can easily be worn smart casual and these will definitely be getting worn out and worn into the office at times.

The shoe are a 7.5 and fit me perfectly. I range from 7-7.5 and find Vans can be a little narrower so 7.5 is perfect.

Another excellent shoe from Vans.",5,2018/07/31
"I like my trainers to have a certain retro appeal to them so the 'Vans Canvas Low-Tops' are just the thing. The combination of black and white looks clean and has that 70s/90s/today appeal to them, a look that keeps coming back. The white laces and go faster stripe along the side give them a somewhat timeless appeal. The sneaker itself is very well made with some good stitching and very comfortable inners; it is like wearing slippers. I would not wear these as exercise trainers as the white bottoms are likely to mark easily, instead they are better as a fashion sneaker to wear with jeans.

The description describes these as Men's, but they are totally unisex with nothing to stop them appealing to either sex. Indeed at size 6 they are more likely to fit a women's foot and they do. They are the right size as stated. The fit is a snug one, but comfortable. I am not one to batter my trainers and even the cheapest pairs I have last a long time, from what I can tell these appear to be well made and will last even longer. I plan to keep mine looking as new for as long as possible.",5,2018/09/03
"These sneakers are absolutely top quality as you would expect from VAN. I don't think the ""canvas"" description is entirely accurate as the outer material is quite thick, and feels more like suede than canvas. They fit me perfectly (10.5 - I am usually either 10 or 11), are extremely comfortable, and look great worn casually, or smart casual/smart. The gum rubber soles are thick, and give very good grip. These may not be cheap, but the quality definitely makes them stand out from cheaper, similar looking sneakers. I will be giving them a lot of wear, and I expect them to last a very long time. Highly recommended.",5,2018/07/31
I like the packaging,4,2019/05/29
"A pair of sneakers. Billed as being for men, but women could probably get away with wearing these quite easily.

They're suede. Low top. Black on the main body. And white on the soles.

They do up with white laces.

They're a very snug fit. And they look really nice.

The ones I had were 8.5 size - nobody seems to make half size any more, so that was nice - and they fit really well indeed and were comfy to walk in.

So they're a really good product.",4,2018/07/29
"These canvas shoes are very well made and surprisingly comfy. The design is very casual, but still quite smart. Clearly, they're a fashion item, and you pay a bit of a premium for the name, but they're still a good quality pair of shoes, even if you're not into labels.

It's not that clear from the photos, but the sides are made of canvas, while the toe, heel and lace areas are a black suede material. It's all black, but the suede has a slightly darker appearance than the canvas.

I'm normally a 10 or 10.5, but the size 11 fits me perfectly (without socks); I'd therefore recommend considering going a size up.",5,2018/07/24
"Not much more to say really! Fantastic trainer, classically stylish, hard to beat! Have lasted me well for a good few months so far and not showing any signs of falling apart soon - unlike most pairs of converse I go through!
Really comfy, great fit - look fantastic with most outfits.",5,2018/11/14
"This is the first time I've had a pair of Vans and I am very pleased with them. This sneaker is low top which I find comfortable straight away, you get none of that uncomfortable rubbing on your ankle. The shoe is canvas with suede across the toe and heel and the classic white Vans stripe down the side. I have found the shoe to be supportive to wear and the sole is bouncy and cushioned to walk in, even over gravel and stones. I have found these shoes to be comfortable and a great fit.",5,2018/08/08
Great shoes. Very comy. Purchased on prime day so saved nearly £20 . Which was a bonus. Arrived when they said. Great value. Highly recommend the seller and the vans.,5,2018/09/06
"I’ve been a huge fan of vans shoes for years and I love this pair too. They are very comfortable but also sturdy and give your feet good support. They will last a while and you can wear them throughout the year in all weather conditions. They look good, with the distinct vans style, and are also easy to clean. I have worn these walking round the city for three days in a row and had no problems at all, didn’t even need to break them in. Perfect!",5,2018/08/14
"I am a Vans convert for many years. They are comfortable, stylish, well wearing and just an all round great shoe. They are robust and well made. Thicker than the canvas type shoes. I can't speak highly enough for Vans. They know shoes!",5,2018/08/15
"Bought these in the Prime sale for my husband as he loves these vans, they came quickly and were perfect!",5,2018/08/04

"These trainers or sneakers if you prefer are very stylish. They are inspired by Vans Classic Old Schoo trainers. The Van's trainers are low top, vulcanized lace up style with Vans signature side stripe. They come with a smooth Lining and a cushioning insole which adds comfort when waring them in. These are nice and comfortable trainers and look great too.",5,2018/08/09
Bought by my daughter and a couple of friends as a birthday present for a mutual friend. She absolutely loved them.,5,2018/07/31
"Not a bad word to say about these. You know what you're getting when you buy a good pair of Vans, and these were at a great price too due to it being Prime Day. Perfect fit: look like a boss.",5,2018/07/25
"My husband loves these sneakers. The sneakers he normally wears are of the cheapest variety and of course there is just no comparison. At last he believes that you get what you pay for. These are black with white stitching, design , lacing and soles. The main body of the shoe is black canvas and has a white leather strip. The toes and heels are a suede like material. They fit perfectly and are really very comfortable. They also look very smart.",5,2018/08/02

"I have over 30 pairs of converse shoes but i have never had a pair of vans before and i was really surprised by them. They are super comfortable, and gave good support to my feet. The suede accents were nice, but i dont feel they added anything to the shoe. I also feel as thought they need air holes like converse have as they did make my feet sweat a bit, but it has been extremely hot.

They go very well with leggings, jeans and even skirts for a casual look. Very impressed with them and would buy in another colour. The thing with both converse and vans are that they have pure rubber soles which last for years and years. This is why they are worth the money. They will last ages.

As an end note i am not sure why they list these seperately for men and women as the shoes are completely identical.",5,2018/07/27

"While I love the shoes, I have only had them for a couple of weeks and the inside sole is already breaking towards the back of the shoe where it meets the heel. Very disappointed on quality as the shoe is great overall. Not sure if I should take them into a Vans store to replace them?
Feedback from the seller would be appreciated.",1,2018/08/03
Fake,1,2018/08/22
"As ever when I buy deck shoes online I was left disappointed by these . Once again the base soles are not as thick as I wanted or as appeared in the pictures .

Vans should know better and build their products with thicker tyres.

The uppers were ok but I felt a little flat. I will always buy these on the high street from now on.",2,2019/03/28
Had to give away :( larger than nike sbs and larger than lakais,2,2018/08/30
"Real.
Good fit.
Worth it.",5,2022/10/07
Can’t comment as these were bought as a Xmas prezzie for my son. I’ll get back to you,5,2019/11/13
"Second pair, as expected",5,2019/08/29
The shoe fit as expected....very comfortable,5,2022/08/04
I managed to get these on offer at a very low price. They’re not an outstanding trainer you’re not going to get loads of compliments but they’re basic and a good price.,5,2022/09/01
Great value for money. Brought them for my brother for skate boarding. Not ver durable for skating but for normal everyday use they are great.,4,2021/08/21

Comfy but not as comfy as my old ones. Not as thick around the ankel,5,2022/12/03
"Nice pair of vans, so nice I brought two pairs lol
comfortable on the feet and look nice too with the gum sole....
Good value for the price and speedy delivery as always. Thanks Amazon",5,2022/12/04
"Ordered a 9.5 for the son, tried them on and was too large, but fitted the husband who is a size 10 so he gained a pair of trainers and didn't have to change them",5,2022/09/03
"Bought as a gift, always such good value for money (especially at Black Friday price).",5,2021/12/21
Great product and I caught it when the price was fantastic!,5,2019/09/19
"Bought as Christmas present, they’re his favourite for comfort n fit, plus they’re washable, with care last for ages",5,2022/01/18
"As expected with any pair of shoes, they did give me a blister on the heal and big toe, but this disappeared after a few days and now they are extremely comfy. The laces are made with a decent fabric, so they aren't going to snap off any time soon.

Can run quite easily in them without them sliding about. The size was true to advertisement.

Funny flaw about them though, if you walk in a specific way, you can make a farting noise with the heel of your foot and the sole.",5,2022/04/12
I really liked these and they were the only ones in my size (11) - the were too big unfortunately and I ended up returning them. Do seem bigger than normal.,5,2022/12/08

Amazing shoes,5,2021/07/06
"Had these shoes for like 8 years and still I’ve them and wear them although I do clearly need a new pair but point is, amazing shoe!!!",5,2022/11/28
e size. I wear a size 14 shoe. I had to order these overseas from the UK. They look and feel like the real deal. No telling if they are a knock off but they fit well for my large wide flat feet!,5,2022/07/24
"Well they were supposed to arrive on the 14th of July, but came today 8th. So that was a pleasant surprise. Brand new, great look. Seem authentic. Fit well. As a Gen X street skater, I have not owned a pair of Vans since the 90s so I’m jacked they came early and are on my feet.",5,2022/07/08
"El estilo es espectacular, no muy Sport, eso era lo que buscaba, no es un cómodo como para estar caminando todo un día en un parque de atracciones",5,2022/04/27
Perfect,5,2022/06/15
"Definitely buy at least one size bigger. I always get size 11 in shoes, had to return the first one because it was nowhere near fitting. 12 worked, but I probably could’ve gone 12 1/2 easily",4,2021/07/22
"Well first off when I bought these they were labeled as unisex shoes not women's shoes. I had to keep returning them and getting a size larger each time because the toe box is so narrow that it was uncomfortable. By the time I got a size that weren't uncomfortable for my toes widthwise, not only did the to box then stick out way too far past the end of my toes but then with the way the shoes are sewn it would pinch down on the top of my toe joint and be uncomfortable in that way. I don't know whose feet are shaped in a way that these shoes would fit but it's definitely not my feet.",2,2022/05/08
I love the colour it jus fitted exact on my feet so if ordering order a half size bigger,4,2021/09/26
"He’s been using my sons, his dad, and he didn’t try them on when we were there, he continued to use his dads so his new ones would stay clean 🤙🤪",5,2021/12/23

Happy,5,2022/05/03
Said held in customs I was worried about not receiving then in time for a event bit they arrived earlier than the expected delivery date from the U.K. FIT AMAZING and just as advertised thank you first international shipment went without a problem very easy I would reorder and use this company again,5,2021/07/15
Quedó muy bien,5,2022/03/07
Nice shoe - runs a little small to size,4,2021/05/06
These lasted for a long time.,4,2021/07/27
I ordered it as a gift and I heard it fit perfectly!,5,2022/01/10
"My wife ordered these and even on the order it shows she ordered a mens 9. She was sent a UK size 7. Turns out it was on a UK amazon site so turned out to be a huge pain. Whomever she spoke with at Amazon was very helpful but still took quite a while and would have ended up costing us $45 to return the shoes but she managed to make it work.

She loved the shoes but way too small.",4,2019/08/22
Excelente producto,5,2022/02/04
My son loved them,5,2021/12/27
"I love Vans, though its hard for me to find time as a single parent to get out to a store and try on shoes and look around for something I like feeling like the employees are waiting on me. So I thought I'd give Amazon a try, never having bought shoes before. I was hesitant at first whether or not the fit would be right but when they came they were just what I wanted and saved me the time. Good work Amazon.",5,2019/10/18
"I normally wear size 14 in everything. I have another pair of Vans but I swear every size 14 I’ve ever tried was too large. I ordered a size 13 and they fit perfectly. I swear they run large but the majority of comments seem to say they’re true to size. Maybe they aren’t ordering the larger size like I am, and may be the larger sizes do tend to run one size up. I’m super happy with them! Can’t wait to wear them out.",5,2019/10/25
It was to large for my feet. So as a size 11 for women we should get 9.5 form the men size.,4,2020/10/24

I’ve been wanting some of these for awhile now and these were perfect my nephew even liked them and wanted some. They felt great,5,2021/08/07
"Typical Van's, still a decent board shoe.",4,2021/04/19
Got these for my BF he has had them on daily since and says he loves them and they were just what he wanted. very happy since he really needed a new pair!,5,2021/06/02
"They look how they look in the picture, and they fit perfectly.",5,2021/10/17
I like everything about this shoe because it's perfect for my particular foot. It gives me the support I need and the comfort I want in an unsuppinated and non- pronated shoe. Thanks.,5,2021/05/26
Order these for a Christmas gift for my grandson,5,2021/11/03
I’m not sure why other reviews are saying these are fakes. Mine are 100% genuine Vans. The fit is a bit smaller than advertised but that’s just how Vans fit (by half a size).,5,2021/03/04
Awesome shoes I’ve been wearing for the last 14 years. Great look and feel. These are only for the people that don’t need arch support. Only problem is they put a sewn vans patch on the tongue of the shoe that makes it stiff and rub the front of my ankle.,4,2019/10/05
Perfect for what they are supposed to be used for. If you are looking for all day comfort and you are picky about your arch support and cushion.....still buy these because they are awesome but also buy inserts. 😉,5,2020/11/16
"Pricey but had to have them!! Awesome style and Look good with shorts, especially camouflage shorts (don’t wear flip flops with them as I don’t like being a clone) but like a few others have commented, not the best arch support and for darn near 100 bucks you would think the manufacturer would do a better job in providing that, but comfortable enough for minimal walking.",4,2019/06/23
They were the wrong size needed size 15 usa got the small ones,4,2020/10/24
"Bought for 15 yr old son, hard to please, he is happy with fit and feel. So thumbs up!",4,2020/10/19
My son has a large foot and these are perfect for him. And he loves the original style.,5,2021/06/25
"I bought these low top vans sneakers not to long ago to replace similar ones I use to have that were all black, but had gotten very warn out after wearing them for years. These are very nice black and white sneakers that fit as expected, and I wear them on a regular basis.",5,2019/12/07
"I liked the shipping amazon uses for delivery, fast and efficient. My son loves the shoes. I believe now he has his own account and will be ordering more in the future. You rock amazon.",5,2020/05/27
Decent shows for fasion. Fit is roomier than all my shoes do. Ill wear them on my Harley like a Billy bad%@¿....,4,2020/02/25
Very pleased,4,2020/11/15
"Yup, these are vans. 5/5",4,2020/09/23
Quality is great comfort is great but it is very low top in the pic looks like it's up to the ankle at least but it's lower. And it looks too skinny and long. Wasn't my cup of tea plus the whole world seems to be wearing these where I work I see atleast 3 diff people every day wearing these exact shoes. Just wasn't my cup of tea and it is pretty expensive!,3,2021/02/16
me duraron solo 6 meses cuando he comprado vans toda mi vida y me duran siempre mas de un a#o... estoy dudando si son originales...,3,2021/06/18
Got a size 8.5 since my man is a size 8 and it barely fit him. I recommend going a size up.,4,2019/12/26
"Not good support for your feet, but for casual wear they’re great. I’ve bought this shoe twice now, they last a long time, and are comfy, like I said, for casual wear. Standing in these too long will hurt.",4,2019/05/22
"I ordered these shoes expecting to get a new pair of vans like advertised, but instead got a pair of used shoes covered in dirt and scuff marks. Pretty rediculous.",1,2022/10/14

cool shoes. they match the colors of my beagle dog lol,5,2021/05/06

"My husband has been wearing Vans for about 10 yrs. and these sneakers are as close to the original ""skater"" sneaker as you can get! Fashionable w/o being over the top...wide enough that they don't bind his feet and stylish looking. A great price and a great sneaker",5,2019/09/22

Wasn't really comfy. Also was a weird film of oil or something on them. No clue what it was. Wish I could return but I used a gift card.,3,2021/01/11
"good shoes - looks and feels good except they gave me one size bigger than i ordered and i could’ve be bothered to return it, it fits just a little loose.",4,2018/11/26
Sneakers are great but not true to size recommended getting atleast 1/2 size bigger.,5,2020/10/30

My son wanted these shoes for Christmas and he loves them,5,2020/12/27
"Yup, great shoe",5,2021/03/17
"Vans, like everything else, have been getting more expensive while getting lower in quality. These shoes are canvas (they look like leather or at least ""pleather"") in the photo.

They're also really narrow in the toebox, and we're uncomfortable to me at least.

Overall, too expensive and poor fit, so I returned them.",2,2021/09/01

I was really disappointed I had to return the item. And even more disappointed when I went to the Post Office and they told me it would cost. $37.50 to return a $45.00 pair of shoes. I'm still in shock!,3,2019/11/08
I’m up and down if there real because the tongue is different then store vans and the bottom is darker but I’d say overall it’s a good pair and true to it’s appearance.,3,2019/12/22
Love vans!!! this is like my 10th pair.,5,2020/08/27
Pretty good overall maybe a lil more comfort could be added but I would still give it a 5 star,5,2019/12/22

Love these shoes. Exactly what I needed.,5,2020/03/02
"The shoes are missing the side tag/label that nearly all vans have. The material is more of a hard canvas than the typical softer fabric which vans uses on their shoes. The Vans logo on the back of the sole is much smaller than normal. The tongue feels and looks very cheap. They also came in a plain, brown, shoebox with no markings, even the stuffing paper itself was also very plain. They did not come with extra laces either. Their is no support in the shoe.",1,2021/04/14

They are fake!!!! The second I opened the “vans” box I could tell by the stitching and the tags. They also run small. Hurt my feet. All I wear and buy are vans so I know how new ones feel and these are crap. Just order through the vans website and save the trouble. Cheap crap. I am pissed because I paid full price $70+ for knock off cheap a** shoes,1,2020/11/22

"Size was way too big to be the normal 15 I always get. Thought no big deal, just send it back and get one size smaller. Nope. You have to provide your own shipping and it’s $166.73 to ship a two pound box back to the seller in SCOTLAND!! So now I just basically gave him $75 and have no available recourse. Super crappy.",1,2021/03/15

Why did the store sensor that needs a special tool to remove it come on the shoe? Now I have to take it somewhere to get the theft tag sensor off or risk getting ink all over the shoe if I remove it,1,2020/12/29
