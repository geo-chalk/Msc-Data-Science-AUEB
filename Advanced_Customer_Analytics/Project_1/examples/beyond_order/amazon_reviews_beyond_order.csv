Purchased this for my brother who like Jordan the author. Wanna sort yer life out. Listen to this man!!!!,5,2022/11/25
Easy to understand written well love it,5,2022/11/30
"To say Jordan Peterson is marmite is something of an understatement. He is both adored and hated in equal measures. Much of the hatred often, it seems to me, comes from people who don't seem to have read what he actually said and don't care. This volume experienced something of this in production from certain people at the publishers who wanted to cancel the book. Now we can read and find out for ourselves.

I am admittedly more in the pro-Peterson camp. I've read both his previous books, including the admittedly difficult ""Maps of Meaning"" as well as his next one which was aimed at a popular audience, ""12 Rules for Life."" The latter one reminded me somewhat of a book by Alfred Adler, a onetime collaborator with Freud, who later left to form his own school of psychology. The Adler volume is entitled ""What Life Should Mean to You."" Peterson acknowledged Adler in ""12 Rules,"" so presumably is attempting there (and in this book) to do something similar, namely to show ways of living a meaningful life in your own way.

Though Adler is not mentioned in ""Beyond Order,"" it follows the same format as ""12 Rules"" with essays round certain principles that Peterson wants to discuss, In this he uses his experience and academic knowledge from his study of psychology. The interesting thing I find about Peterson is they way he combines many fields of knowledge including literature, neuroscience, behaviour therapy as well as Jungian dream analysis. At the same time he brings it to ground in everyday experience in an easy and accessible style that in some ways improves on his previous volume. Over all I would say it is the better book, but that maybe because there is a slight difference in focus. In ""12 Rules"" the focus was perhaps more on what is need to survive in life. ""Beyond Order"" more about how to thrive.

Each of the essays/chapters is designed to be read as a separate entity. Of particular interest to me was the one on relationships which has a title about working on keeping the magic in a relationship while pointing out how all relationships are about negotiation, unless they break down into tyranny or slavery. Another high point is a rule about cultivating beauty which is possibly the best essay of all. Peterson never avoids the difficulties in life. Much of this is down to earth advice, but sometimes that can be over looked. This book, like its predecessor, is largely aimed at younger people looking for direction who may feel they need to hear this.

In the end do I find much enlightenment . Here perhaps, I should express an interest in that I am a practicing psychotherapist. Much of what Peterson discusses here was already known to me, sometimes from the sources he cites. But at the same time the combination of things put here is up to date and so has freshness about it. Those looking for controversy here will probably be disappointed.

One of the things that started the ""cult of Peterson"" before he became well known and controversial was his lectures in which he shows himself to be a brilliant explainer of many strands of psychology. This is on show here, and written after a period of severe illness which is mentioned in the introduction. This is a fascinating book. It is good to have him back.",5,2021/03/31
"I’m a big fan of Jordan and his work, admittedly more than most people. I’ve read his previous book ‘12 Rules for Life’ and listened to many of his lectures. I’ve also tried listening to the audio book ‘Maps of Meaning’ but gave up after a short while.

A lot of his theories and teachings really resonate with me and my personal outlook towards life. He’s definitely an intelligent man and is very professional in how he articulates his own beliefs and experiences. In many ways, he knows how to highlight aspects of life and translates valuable lessons with an approach that makes sense to almost everyone.

However, if you’ve listened to him as much as I have, you can pretty much guess where he’s going before he’s began. Some of his metaphors and the stories he uses as examples can lose you quickly and the message he trying to send doesn’t quite hit the way it should. He uses Harry Potter as well as Disney princess references a lot, to help translate of messages for each chapter. I personally lose interest quickly when he does this.

In conclusion, this book is a good read but not a massively great one. However, if you’re fairly new to Jordan and his work, it could be very beneficial to you. For someone like myself who’s already familiar with him, it was ok but proved as a useful read to start my mornings and influence my day, in a productive manner.

For someone who’s never heard of Jordan or his work, I’d argue it’s definitely worth your whole familiarising yourself with him. 12 Rules for life is a very good read as well as his lectures being a very good listen.",4,2021/11/17
This man is a great orator. The way he sublimely articulates his views is par excellence. Speaks to your soul and spirit and about what it really means to be human. Thanks Jordan,5,2022/10/15
"The old say goes ' An unexamined life is not worth living...' This book will be a valuable addition to your collection of Self-Help / Psychotherapy books.
Jordan Peterson's mantra is improve yourself and the world by examining those aspects of your life that we take for granted.
It provides lessons that can be life changing. A great work by Dr Peterson... 10/10",4,2022/06/27
"Brilliant book. Highly recommend listen to his ""lectures"" about the different chapters as you progress through the book. Being dyslexic this really helped.",5,2022/09/24
I found this book more comprehensible than the original 12 rules for life and less abstract. Dr. Peterson continues to use his insight to great effect and benefits the world with his wisdom.,5,2022/09/12
Nothing,5,2022/09/30
Then after a while forgot everything and moved on with my life,4,2022/07/16
Bought as Xmas gift so can’t comment!!,3,2022/11/07
"I ordered a hardback version of this book & a hardback copy of 12 rules for life to have the collection.

Despite the white cover of 12 rules for life turning up with scuffs on (which was very disappointing) due to the terrible handling of my local Amazon couriers....

I still have to rate this book 5* regardless and won’t let a courier bring down my feedback to JP.

An absolutely incredible read & would recommend this to anybody who has a vague interest in self help, psychology or philosophy. If you have a strong interest in any of the above this book, as will the counterpart: 12 rules for life, change your perception on the world.

I’ve been a fan of JP since 2017, listened to all of almost all of the YouTube material on his channel and will be purchasing Maps Of Meaning shortly.

I can’t wait to read the next book with 24 shorter rules!!!!

I know you read almost all of your feedback to gauge public response & if the tables have turned & you’re reading something I’ve written... THANKS FOR CHANGING MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER!!!

You’re looking fantastic in the Podcasts recently & it’s great to see you back producing incredible content once again.

I wish you, Tammy & the family the best of health, wealth & happiness... (you’ve already an abundance of meaning)",5,2021/04/16
"My husband bought me this book as I’m a big fan of Jordan’s writing & podcasts, etc. This book provides an antidote to all the nonsensical political correctness (this doesn’t mean I lack empathy & compassion!), free speech & shameful arbitrary unkindness in today’s world. Having been lent the first book, 12 Rules for Life, by our son, & found it comforting & personally helpful, I underlined some pertinent passages for our daughter. She’s more of a spiritual person & found the references to religion a tad tedious but my advice was read on & look beyond this. I found Jordan’s latest book to be a rare treat, giving insight into how to live a better, more authentic life with the benefits also spilling over into the whole of society. His obvious kindness & compassion towards the human race gives me hope that I can become a better version of myself & in my humble opinion most people would get something positive from both books. His advice is not sentimental & there is no air of superiority. As ever, I found myself visiting the internet to look up some of his interesting references to historical events, science, psychology & mythology. Hugely enjoyable read. I will be revisiting both books in the future!",5,2021/06/09
This is a great work that summarises his work in the most applicable way to your life. Highly recommended.,5,2022/08/11
"I know that Dr Peterson is accused of all sorts of things including (but not limited to) transphobia, encouraging the ""far right"" (whatever that is this week?) and as one of the main enemy's of oppressed minorities. I have to say I'm baffled as to why he creates such hostile feeling, as if his critics actually read any of his writing they would find the opposite is true. Personal responsibility is the touchstone of his work and is surely the most sure fire way of not blaming others for our own problems/shortcomings/life outcomes. Perhaps telling people not to abdicate their own responsibility for living in this world is a pill that many would prefer not to swallow? Being far safer simply to apportion the blame to some exterior set of circumstance (or group of people). Dr Peterson never denies that some of us have more crosses to bear than others, but he reminds us also that personal action is more powerful than we believe. We do live in troubled times but this second volume offers more positive ways we can live better lives benefiting both ourselves and others. As you may have guessed; highly recommended!!",5,2021/04/09
I expected a read similar to the original twelve rules which I really enjoyed. This book reads more like a text book and I found it heavy going - not a book to be picked up for a lunch time break.,3,2022/07/20
"Absolutely love the book and author's honest approach to practical life circumstances and providing the tools for self-reflecting, improvement, understanding and developing as a better human being. Once you read one section of a chapter you begin to realise the negative journalism surrounding the individual seem highly unlikely at worst and completely irrelevant at best as he delivers some of the most thought provoking, community driven self development available today.

To sit and converse with this person for an hour would provide a lifetime of self melioration but this book is the next best thing and an absolute must read as a follow up to his previous 12 Rules for Life which helped me from being a waste of space of a human being to something far better.",5,2021/11/05
"I do not say the words above lightly. In several years, there will be university courses on the ideas that Peterson has combined from other great thinkers to produce a truly novel approach to facing the eternal questions plaguing every human being.

If you believe that our evil fad of denigrating public figures for no reason other than the fact that they are prominent is a valid reason to not even attempt reading this book, I have no words for you, other than these: ‘Good luck, pal. You’re going to need it.’",5,2022/02/02
"Nothing against the book itself but the physical copy arrived absolutely scraped up, creased and battered. Very disappointed.",2,2022/12/14
"Most magazine/newspaper reviews of Peterson's books that I have read seem fairly shallow, probably because they have been written quickly. People want to categorise the author and his books.

But these are more than 'self-help' books, they are more accurately philosophy: based on a knowledge of human psychology, and a careful study of humanity's origins, culture and evolution. Each chapter is an individual essay on a topic, and can be read again and again, because they diverge so far from the chapter title, and discuss quite surprising linkage to ancient stories, culture and wisdom.

The chapter 'essays' are written for the 'thinking' reader. Don't expect Peterson to be banging the drum for one particular political viewpoint: but read this to gain an honest (and balanced) perspective, then make up your own mind.",5,2021/07/19
I was already stupendously pleased to have the hard back in my collection. Now this paperback is the ideal size and weight to place in a back pack and read on the go.,5,2022/05/11
"What a book by one of the bravest and greatest intellects on the planet. Fantastic insights provided by Jordan, very thought provoking, the work of a genius.",5,2022/05/17
"I'm approx 2/3 the eay through and able to give an opinion now. This piece is easily as good, if not better than 'An antidote to chaos', the two together form what will no doubt be his seminal works. Why isnt this book getting the press it deserves? Is it because Jordan has been effectively cancelled?

I honestly cannot see how anyone, even in this age of the perma offended, could take issue with his writing. That is unless you hate introspection and are too much of a coward to take a cold hard look in the mirror.

Anyone seeking the courage to live a fulfilling life should read these works.

A great man, we are lucky to have him. I hope his recovery (if you can call it that) is sustained and he may continue to illuminate the world through his writing.",5,2021/04/05
"They said it was like new it was , it arrived well packaged and protected ( pet hate of mine damaged and bashed books !) so to recap . Great item as described saved a small fortune which meant I could buy more on my list ! Perfect as trade should be !",5,2022/01/29
"Dr JP’s first book was great. A little didactic and masculine in its approach, but hey, it helped me and my marriage immensely.

This book is in a different conceptual universe. It is the counterpoint to the first, this time examining principles that are feminine in nature. And it’s amazing.

It’s superbly written. It doesn’t surprise me JP was delirious while writing this. I’m not so sure he did. He writes like a man possessed by an Angel - an Angel that wants you to be all that you can be.

With gratitude

David joshua",5,2021/08/25
"As a big JBP fan I am going to be critical here....He tries to do to much with so many of his sentences and paragraphs that at times detracts from the point he is trying to make. HIs sentence structure distorts and distracts the reader, is sometimes unnecessarily complex, or just drags out a point he is making. 12 Rules for Life was better written, grammatically and from a delivery of ideas standpoint, in my opinion.

If you followed JBP between 12 Rules for Life an Antidote to Chaos and the release of this book then you will have heard much of what he is saying here. That being said, I am very happy I bought it, read it, and have it. I would certainly buy it again!",5,2021/04/10
"I've just been delivered the book, opened it and stumbled upon this: ""To my wife, Tammy, whom I have loved deeply for fifty years, and who is admirable, IN MY ESTIMATION, in all regards, and beyond all reason.""

This single paragraph captures the essence of Mr. Peterson's personality and work, a man capable of more empathy than his ""haters"" would like to admit, a man who is precise in his speech, who chooses his words carefuly and who puts reason even into a praise to his wife!

Reading about the book's chapters it seems that this is ""another self help book that teaches the OBVIOUS"", as JBP's critics have called ""12 Rules for Life"", but if ""the obvious"" would've been easily achievable, Mr. Peterson would not hold lectures all over the world explaining it, produce much more content than one can follow and now write a second book about ""the obvious"".

Therefore, I'm grateful for Mr. Peterson's effort, and not only for writing this book, but for everything that he does in helping people straightening their lives.",5,2021/03/02
"I received the book almost destroyed, totally damaged. Shame.",3,2022/06/14
"The essence the book is sound, a good companion to the 12 Rules for Life. However, the way it is written irritates me. I read a lot but find Petersons verbose use of language and sentence structure distracting to the message in certain areas of the book. I find myself re-reading sentences just to make sure I have understood the structure correctly as to not misinterpret his words, which then breaks up the flow of what is actually being said. An example ' the developing infant must also hone and perfect the operation of his or her currently dominant motivational state in harmony with all his or her other internal motivational states.....' it goes on.",4,2021/03/16
"This book is a fantastic read. It truly opens your eyes. It answers many fundamental questions. It answers:talks to you from the perspectives of mythology, religious, science, psychology, and physiology. It is a solid write. It ensures that you have a solid understanding of what is going on in your life at multiple levels of analysis. Individual and social. It pushes the limited of archetypal questions to form archetypal answers. It reflects such understanding to many thousands of years of human development. It is extremely practical and you can apply all concepts in your individual lives. In my modest opinion I am grateful and full of gratitude to have the chance to read this book and live in the time of its author. Fantastic.",5,2021/04/12
"It's an honor and a privilege to be able to read yet another one of this man's books. I have never been the biggest fan of self-help books, so I approached the first 12 Rules book with caution. It was so much more than what I expected. His 2nd book is no different.

Dr. Peterson weaves together aspects of religion, psychology, mythology, psychoanalytical theories, philosophy and many other areas into a book with simple, and at the same time complex rules to help each person become the best version of themselves they can possibly be. It seems to me like the things Dr. Peterson has to say in his works are things that every person deserves to hear, but never does.

While uninformed faux critics of Dr. Peterson and his work, who base their opinions of him on the most recent HuffPost or Vox article exist in multitudes, one should not let these people dissuade them from reading what is one of the most remarkable books in recent years.",5,2021/03/02
I really wanted to love this book. I did find some very useful information in this book however I felt like he kept going off on a tangent. Not sure whether it was a book beyond my intellectual ability but I’d start reading a chapter then forget what the theme of the chapter was as he’d start talking about something unrelated. I don’t know.,3,2022/01/20
"Although I’ve heard Peterson say that he wrote parts of the book whilst unwell, I enjoyed it more than the first book. It covers a range of problems and his ability to talk about something which at first appears tangential and out of context but then relate it back to a rule is genius. This has been a really enlightening read for me! The style of writing is also very accessible.",5,2021/09/14
"Excellent follow up to his 12 rules with more gems and advice for life.

1. Don't stifle creativity or the institutions that provide opportunities
2. Be all that you can be
3. Don't let sleeping dogs lie
4. Where's there's muck there's brass
5. Avoid vexations to the spirit
6. My favourite and just brilliant: Stay clear of 'isms'
7. Strive to do one thing really well
8. We live in a beautiful Universe, using art and poetry to illustrate.
9. Address your skeletons in the cupboard
10. The old chestnut, work on romance and relationships
11. Avoid developing negative aspects in one's personality.
12. Dealing with aging and personal suffering.",5,2021/03/15
"This is a fantastic follow up to 12 Rules for Life, however this book is a step up in terms of difficulty, tackling complex issues with relevant metaphors, personal stories and observations and provides as many questions as answers. It seems like an to attempt to tackle the major societal issues facing us today as well as a motivating and uplifting personal book of self help and I think it succeeds with doing both. However, I have a feeling this will not be a popular book with many people who don’t like JP no matter what he says or writes, but there is no doubting this in an exceptionally brilliant book.",5,2021/03/06
"J.P. Beyond Order provides a personal journey, naked and cold, yet warm and contrasted with hope and 12 more rules which could unlock the future. Once more the clinician provides a roadmap to fulling our potential and living a more rounded life. The personal accounts this round are much deeper and evoke even more emotional resonance than before. A modern-day thinker and intellectual that challenges the modus operandi and breaks out from the matrix and live on your own terms within a framework that allows growth and development, interpersonal relationships to flourish, and the human soul to rise and soar.",5,2021/03/20
"Like his previous book, this is very dense and can be difficult to read. You must pay attention; you can’t drift off for a moment. It’s worth the effort: as ever, the author moves fluently between the pragmatic and the theoretical, marshalling everything from the Bible to Harry Potter to illustrate his wide-ranging points. But what I love most about his work is that, through the dense prose, you get a strong sense of how much he genuinely cares for others. His critics who accuse him of ‘hate’ really couldn’t be further from the truth.",5,2021/03/31
"Mr Peterson, I just wanted to pass on my sincere thanks to you for writing this book and for your phenomenal contributions to the world. The depth of your teaching is unparalleled and you are actively propelling me towards the realisation of my potential. At the time of writing, my primary focus is on improving my (verbal) communication skills. I am reading the book out loud, speaking slowly and carefully as I absorb this profound knowledge whilst facilitating the process of finding my own voice. I am thoroughly enjoying working through the book and recommend it wholeheartedly to every person regardless of background/outlook.",5,2021/03/11
"There is nothing to say about Jordan B. Peterson that was not said before. His work has to be tried with a pinch of salt and open minded. As long as you choose to let other people to tell/suggest you what you like, what you should think or to like or to dislike then his work is not for you, since it requires to use your own brain and make your own opinions.
In my opinion this is the new ""second testament"" in addition to his previous book what was the ""new testament"" and together now can make the new ""Bible""",5,2021/03/02
Great book,5,2022/03/19
"It's one of the best books I've ever read. At times I felt these things should be thought by our parents and teachers in school since this relates mostly with clarity, values and responsabily in your life .
The boring part for me was the Disney characters serving as archetypes. But I suppose he had a certain audience in mind for that example.
It's very good book that I highly recommend, especially if you have a cynic view on life.",5,2021/04/07
Dr. Peterson is once again showing us the fundamentals of a meaningful life. He is imparting his wisdom with deep care for the audience and with profound thought. This and his previous book have helped me cope with a personal loss in a more courageous way than I would have managed otherwise. I recommend the book to everyone who would like to emerge a better person from the chaos of life.,5,2021/05/11
"It has taken me time to read, and re-read and to digest. Watching Petersen’s YouTube lectures has also helped. As a teacher, coach, and student support provider it has greatly informed my understanding. On a personal level it has formed part of hand and footholds needed to climb up from a dark place.",5,2021/08/09
"This is an important sequel to his second book, 12 Rules for Life.
If 12 Rules for Life was helpful, this one takes everything one step further,
and possibly deeper. I have found the pair amazingly useful and mind opening.",5,2021/10/20
"If you are ordering the paperback version of this book note that they seem to only offer a large print edition!! I didn't realise this and its mildly irritating as (A) I am longsighted and (B) I have a smallprint version of the first book of his, 12 rules for life.",4,2021/03/19
"I'm so excited that JBP is well again and back with more excellent advice. I particularly like rule 11 on not letting resentment and anger get the best of you, but all of it seems very useful.

My only complaint, and nothing to do with the book itself, is the shabby and torn condition it arrived in. Amazon delivery quality seems to be getting much worse these days, particularly for books. Maybe someone in the Amazon warehouse doesn't like the popularity of JBP's books?",5,2021/03/02
"Jordon B Peterson work is life changing, I'd highly recommend.",5,2022/01/28
"This is a book and a philosophy for life which has been carefully researched and reflected on over a period of time.
It is a wonderful 'mix' and bringing together of philosophy, psychology and religion. It has therefore 'struck a chord' with me and I wish I had been introduced to this kind of thinking at a much earlier age .....brilliant !",5,2021/05/17
"His advice on how to live isn’t so much revelatory, as I’m sure a lot of people including myself already follow his rules, to an extent, without reading his works - but it’s the way he articulates the behaviours we exhibit which can go a long to self preservation and improvement - and in turn helping others and as a result improving the world at large.",5,2021/04/25
"I have a deep love of evolutionary biology as a psychologist and this book asks many of the vital questions we need to ask in today's society. Similarly, it's references to Piaget and Jung etc are very accurate to the works and intentions of those great minds. The integration of mythology and religion speaks to the ancient narrations of culture and what faith is.
In summary:
Wonderfully written and the answer to many of the pathologies in today's society. I have a deep love for the prequel and the new book is great also.",5,2021/03/02
"Great book for understanding life and its a great asset to help you get your life on order and understand that this world is not perfect. We all going to always have challenges and chaos but it's the balance of order and chaos that will help you balance your life. I would highly recommend starting with 12 Rules of Life, Antidote to chaos.",5,2021/04/26

"There are some nuggets of wisdom in there, stuffed between a bunch of bloated and nauseating nonsense. Not akin to the revelatory nature of the first book, it’s worth a read, but there are chunks you may wish to skip past.

"JBP never disappoints and this new book yet again challenges you to think, reflect, aspire and put in the hard work necessary to become everything you could possibly be. Outstanding!!!!",5,2021/05/28
Another really interesting collection of 'rules' to live by. Populated by the author's deep thinking and conscientious work effort to make this life better than it was before. Particularly enjoyed the recounting of real-life stories to illustrate his viewpoints.,5,2021/04/07
"Well thought through and full of useful anecdotes. If you find „Maps of meaning” to complex, this book follows similar concepts but provides a “lower level of resolution” view, so it might be more accessible for a casual reader.",5,2021/03/24
"I don’t quite understand all the positive reviews. I read and thoroughly enjoyed The 12 Rules for Life, but this book is turgidly written and lacks the verve of the first book. Peterson makes some good points in this book but you have to plough through an awful lot of verbiage to get there. Although most of the good points have been made elsewhere somewhat more cogently.
I feel that if you view Peterson as an interesting commentator on psychology you will be disappointed by this book. On the other hand if you have bought into the cult of Jordan Peterson and feel he saved your life then you’ll view this book as another missive from the mountain top.",2,2021/08/14

"OK - Peterson is obviously a clever guy, knows a lot of stuff about a lot of things. But this book is not the life fulfilling book that people say it is, it is OK at best, life-changing - certainly not. If he were sitting next to me telling the story, after about 10 pages I would be bored. I've spent money buying the book so will goddam finish it - but the messiah - he ain't.",2,2021/03/26
Very disappointed how it arrived. I could’ve just bought a second hand book!!,1,2022/06/23
The font size is incredibly large which makes it very difficult to read the book especially for someone who reads fast. Combine it with Dr Peterson's writing style (a flow of thoughts rather than a structured narrative) and getting through a softcover becomes very tough.,2,2021/07/08
"I bet the book is superb but the delivery was the worst. Ripped and dirty, as if it was dragged on the road, tied to a horse. 0/5 delivery

"Beyond Order is not altogether an easy text, with often long, drawn out passages that can be fairly academic and abstract to read, especially to those unfamiliar with reading non-fiction texts.

Having said this, Peterson does write beautifully, and once you get into the style and flow of the writing there are some wonderful messages and stories contained within, amongst many literary, Biblical and even Harry Potter references, to engage one’s thinking and concentration.

Each of the 12 chapters starts with a new Rule, though Peterson does have a tendency to meander and digress within the text. So the use of subheadings provides useful guidance within the sections for the reader, as well as stopping and starting points.

Ultimately, Beyond Order is a conversation with a clever man who touches on issues and themes that you may have pondered at some point throughout your own journey in life. And whether or not you agree with Peterson doesn’t really matter. Beyond Order is a book to get you, personally, to think about the bigger picture and address parts of your own life and the perspective you take.

All in all, this is a good, intelligent book that I enjoyed reading.

I hope you find my review helpful.",5,2022/02/19
"Poor old J.P insulted & attacked to stating the truth and trying to help people.
A mere 25 years ago he would have been classed as being a liberal, now in these nutty times hes Mr. H",5,2021/12/20
"This, like other Peterson books, is rehashed non-sense masquerading as helpful advice. It’s written in an inaccessible format that makes stupid people think that Peterson is intelligent. Everything about the guy screams the opposite - he rambles, speaks quickly and has these dull monologues where he uses words inappropriately.

Really intelligent people use simple language and can explain concepts to anyone.

This was totally useless, as is all of petersons work.",1,2022/09/18
"First of all I would like to say that I have not listened to any of Peterson's lectures or speeches. When reading this book (just like the previous 12 rules for life) most of the time I had no idea what I was reading about. This would be even more true if I wouldn't have finished each chapter in a day. In each chapter, there is just too many details, different examples, situations and psychological terms I didn't understand. Each rule is described in 30-40 pages which is just too long. After reading each chapter, I could only remember one or two sentences. All in all, I don't even now how to rate this book. Why did I even start reading it? Probably because of peer pressure. It is advertised as the most selling book in our country. Everbody keeps telling ""You must read this book"", but my advice is if you are not into this kind of books and if you have a feeling you wouldn't like this book, just don't read it - no matter what other thousand people around you say differently. Or, maybe all of this is not true and I just had too much coffee while reading it ;)",4,2021/03/11
"I’m a fan of how Jordan Peterson thinks, or at least how he lays out his logic in a structured format. Oddly I found his first book lacked a little structure, jumping from the personal, to the professional a lot. But somehow it worked really well.

I listened to this as an audiobook and in parts I was enthralled by - again- the mix of personal and professional stories. However for me there was far too many sidetracks of trying to make his point on how the same stories have been told since biblical times. There are so many analogies I forgot what his point was half the time. Seemed to be a lot of filler talking about religious stories. Harry Potter also got a lot of space....

Worth listening to or reading or the nuggets of gold but they are well hidden in a heap of other stories, which for me didn’t quite work.",3,2021/06/06
"I read a fair amount of books and rarely write reviews but I felt it was the least i could do after having the privilege of reading this book.

First of all, this is not a self help book! Well it is but only partly. This book is an instruction manual for understanding the principles of the world we live in and organising the human psyche accordingly. It is a philosophy book also, a phycology book, it has ancient mythology in it and much more.

Jordan Peterson uses a central point for each chapter, which he toys with by layering many completely individual gripping story's that each have incredible value on their own, but somehow all come together and lead to the central point accompanied by an ""ah-ha"" moment.

I am somewhat careful of which authors I read nowadays as you will almost certainly unconsciously take on board some of the opinions of the material you read even if you disagree with them, having said this every single word in this book has been careful selected by a man who I believe to be an ethical human who has a great perspective about life. You wouldn't go far wrong if you blindly absorbed every single last letter written in this book (i wish i could haha).

Instead I am listening to a couple of chapters of the audiobook at a time whilst i drive to work and then re-reading and taking notes when i get home, so i can fully incorporate the wisdom into my life and apply it. You could read or listen to this all the way through just once which would be very interesting but you will miss out on such a wealth of knowledge by doing this.

Another tip is that, this is the sequel to '12 Rules For Life - An Antidote To Chaos', if you haven't you should read this first. In a nutshell I would say the first book is basically about getting your life in order, where as the second book is a bit more complex and is aimed more at how to win/ achieve your potential, although this is a generalisation. Overall read the first book first, especially if you don't have your life in order, then get your life in order and read this a year or two later. If you have already read the first book, or your life is in decent this will not disappoint... and dare I say, I think this one may actually even be better than the first!",5,2021/03/07
"Before reading JP I was what is known as 'woke'. I did not fully understand that the extent to which respecting someone's chosen pronouns actually helped to further the Marxist agenda. Indeed, The Professor really opened my eyes to the sinister plot behind anti-discrimination movements. There I was, thinking that people might be affected by systemic issues based in history, but no! It's all down to the individual. Equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. As a white man, I feel freed by the notion that my life chances are better because I'm better than others, and not just fortunate to be born in the body, and to the parents I have.

Before I came into intellectual contact with this Daddy of psychology, I was a mere mortal. Sure, I watched every episode of Rick & Morty and so was already of an above-average IQ. But Peterson's revolutionary ideas really helped me break through that final barrier. Ideas like, 'clean your room'... wow. I'd never before considered that a clean home would equal a clean mind. BREATHTAKING. JP is a true CHAD and the ONLY expert I will listen to, as is my right.",5,2021/06/10
"Read 12 rules for life first as this is a sequel and more advanced, great book, recommended for all for self developement.",5,2021/09/03
"Seems other reviewers are taking Jordan's words in very bad faith. Read for yourself. People seem to be trying to take the worst possible interpretation of what he says by trying to read between the lines and fill those gaps with their own imagination. For example when Jordan talks about ""how we all could have been nazis"" he's not saying ""it would be great if we could have been nazis"" he is saying ""the German population in the 1930s were not so different from us and we all have the potential in us to unwittlying become evil if we don't be careful and pay close attention to ourselves"". He's saying watch yourself so we don't repeat it. He often references the book Ordinary Men which is an account this from world war 2.

I don't agree with him on a few significant issues but he truly is a genius in getting to the core of humanity. His writing is truly brilliant and he seems to have an ability to point out behaviour and motivations in myself that seem to obvious once you hear them, but could not identify before.

Highly recommend this.",5,2021/03/02
"I am not one for long words and paragraphs that try to remind the reader of the authors superior intellect! I do however want to be able to read something that i cant put down. This book is a very useful door stop that was far too easy to put down and was clearly not aimed at me! 1st rule to buying a book, check the title of the first paragraph.",1,2022/06/10
"Beyond Order shows JBP as more of a social creature, calling for an affirmative attitude towards conserving culture and creatively transforming it. This balanced account, which draws upon his work with individuals in a clinical setting, corrects some of the extremist errors in Freud and Rousseau and undercuts our crude 'expressive individualism'. Peterson punches holes in our social imaginary by drawing upon a variety of fields, centring on his deep and time-tested work as a psychologist.
Peterson sounds more like the late, great, Rene Girard at times and implicitly refers to mankind as a 'mimetic' creature. Here, he seems finally to be finding the purposeful contours of evolution, expressed through psychology and religion and iterated over aeons.
The iterated game that he refers to, bringing the best of Piaget, reintegrates play and utility, highlighting that life is not a zero-sum game. Contra the ideologues or the nihilistic expressivist, drifting from nothing meaningful to nothing meaningful, Peterson has hope and promises that beyond order there is something paradoxically intelligible and worth living for. He encourages us to be grateful in spite of life's suffering, offering a plethora of reasons why this is the best approach to life. Beauty, practical logic, and love amongst them.

Ignore many of the ideological one star reviews, most of which are by people we know who have not read the book. Beyond Order is a measured and readable book from the much maligned professor and a welcome return to form after a few turbulent years beset by illness, family suffering, and the pressures of public life. Books like this one can take you beyond cleaning your room, and beyond ossified order, if we let them with some semblance of humility.",5,2021/03/02
"Unsurprisingly, he writes in the same rambling, idiosyncratic style that he speaks, meaning that much of this book feels like wading through a thick layer of mud. He is excellent at using paragraphs of text to make often rather simple points, which probably convinces people there is some great wisdom there when most of what they don't really understand can't really be understood anyway because it's just word salad- very postmodernist of him to be honest. However, I have to give this completely unbearable book 3 stars because there was some actually useful advice I could apply to my life.",3,2021/06/28
"Pretty much all the rules I can agree with. The descriptions and explanations however are absolutely horrible. From going off on tangents to irrelevant prose bordering on nonsense, Peterson seems to meander away from his own rules and back again throughout the book. There is also of course the careful sprinkling of his own agenda where he never misses an opportunity to slate socialism or anything else he doesn't like, which comes as no surprise really if you know who he is.

Ultimately it's more like every other self-help book than Peterson would like you to think. Each of his rules could have been explained much more concisely and coherently in a page or two. It's worth glossing over but it won't achieve anything other than parting you from your money.",3,2021/03/28

"I really enjoyed reading the 12th Rules of Life, but Beyond the Order is boring to say the least. Sorry",2,2021/09/28
"My title says it all, for me anyway. Look, if you like or are drawn to the ideas in this dude's work, I think you'd be better served picking up a copy of The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (yes, the legit Roman Emperor) as a good intro into some OG Stoicism (it's basically lil notes and exercises he wrote to himself in his practice of Stoicism in dealing with the ups and downs of life and such).",1,2021/07/10
"There’s plenty here for his critics to get stuck into; he really hates the kind of group think which enforces deference to linguistic and ideological correctness. He’d have fun with the current campaign by the Merseyside Police: “Being Offensive is an Offence”.

And if you find yourself, like one of his clients, in a department where people spend time worrying whether the word “flip-chart” might be offensive to Filipinas, well, he has sound advice: “Do not Do What you Hate”. Get out of places run by idiots.

The book is also a validation of his own role; as he observes, being able to articulate what many people instinctively feel but can’t articulate is a valuable role for a public intellectual. The fact that so many people are, in fact, afraid to articulate what they actually think is something that should give us all pause.",5,2021/03/07

Another JBP masterpiece.,5,2021/04/04
"The content is fairly good. The fairytale references, Harry Potter&LOTR/Hobbit stuff, religious tales, anecdotes from his clinical practice and mythological stories woven throughout the book aren't my thing but were sometimes informative and useful. I don't know if their inclusion made the core messages stick, or diluted the message, distracting and rendering it less persuasive at times. This book has less of the prescriptive and authoritative tone that 12 rules for life had and leans more on anecdotes and cultural folklore (religious and mythological narratives) to support it's messages of avoiding self induced collective or personal suffering. The narrative examples used to develop a point weren't always very cohesive with one other or persuasive in supporting the chapter themes. I was left wondering whether they were being shoe-horned in to back up personal beliefs or opinions, with a second serving of Christianity after our first in 12 rules for life. The opinions in Beyond Order are not bad ones, but perhaps a few more concise chapters of well-reasoned opinion might have sufficed rather than all the folklore.

Similar to 12 rules, this book reads like it was written by a stern father figure with a target audience of 20 year olds who haven't quite managed to fully cope with the responsibilities of adulthood yet. It has worthwhile messages and I can't fault the arguments or advice given. There wasn't anything particularly controversial about them though and some added little to my thought process.

Worthwhile were sections on conceptualising grief: acceptance, rationalising and reacting to grief constructively. Understanding the benefits of hierarchies and power structures, processing traumatic experiences properly, taking practical steps to add beauty to your world. The importance of social connection for checks/balances, in avoiding deviant incompatible beliefs/behaviours, for healthy reassurance or guidance to relieve anxieties. It didn't have the empowering or inspirational impact 12 rules for life did but they're different books and that's a tough one to follow.

Repeated and mildly irritating repetition of the word ""import"" in the place of the more common word ""importance"" did grate and seemed a bit pompous. That's a petty complaint, I know.

I do find the author likeable and the book is worth reading if you need personal tips on your own fulfilment of the Will to Power, self efficacy or sorting out a few lingering hang-ups left over after implementing the earlier 12 rules. I find him a bit heavy going and at times, joylessly earnest. That may just be the content and not a reflection of his personality but I'll need something a little more uplifting to read next.",3,2021/04/10

Just mind blowing,5,2021/04/14
Awesome,5,2021/11/13
Should be a further volume of required reading!,5,2022/07/26
"What can I say? Jordan Peterson never disappoints. Regardless of whether you've read his previous book, this is an absolute must by an intellectual powerhouse.",5,2022/08/07
"Another incredible insight into some ways you could go about improving your life on a daily basis, by taking small steps, and taking individual responsibility.

I actually preferred this one to the first book '12 Rules for Life'.",5,2022/10/06
This is one of those books I know I should read but sabotage myself too much to actually pick it up.,5,2022/10/07
"Beyond order is a lot more technical, thorough and in-depth and requires more attention. However, it is also likely more powerful and transformative. It travels the whole range of complexity from the basics of social interaction to difficult philosophical questions. A patient reader can take away a lot from this amazing book.",5,2021/03/02
It’s really written for those who have eyes to read and ears to listen. Thank you Jordan.,5,2022/09/21
Great read,5,2022/12/15
Read the 12 rules. Then give it some time. Then read this to reflect. It's the best thing you can do with your life.,5,2021/09/25
Brilliant book. Bought this after reading the original 12 rules for life and was majority impressed with the second edition!,5,2021/04/12
"Very clear and helpful .
Genius .",5,2021/06/09
"Very engaging.

Really felt Jordan Peterson was teaching new things and not just making another book because the first one went great.

Also, I mostly agree with his ideas so I loved the ways he presented these ideas.",5,2021/05/27
"As the title suggests, this is not as ordered as the previous book by Jordan Peterson. More like an open market place where different stalls can overlap in the products they sell, compared to the supermarket aisle of the former work. I didn't find it quite as inspiring as ""12 Rules for Life"" but equally enjoyable and revalatory.
Once again, Jordan talks us through his monumental knowledge of philosophy and pshychology, backing his ideas up with arguments going back through the ages.",5,2021/11/14

"Jordan Peterson is a Canadian psychotherapist who studied at McGill in Montreal and has long taught
and practiced in Toronto. He became famous a few years ago with his 12 Rules of Order. Beyond Order
embraces the chaos of life, and is portrayed as a balance to its predecessor in a way akin to the principles
of Yin and Yang. Peterson became wildly popular (and despised) because of his reiterating points of
tough love that nobody seems to say anymore, especially in self-help books. As one journal's review
said, he was smart enough to write a self-help book that would be read by men. This isn't just white
men either, as the crisis of masculine identity is multiracial. I don't necessarily ""get"" Peterson the way
some of my high school friends did. But a few years ago, I had to go to one more rehab, this time
a brief and hardcore one, with heroin and meth addicts used to being in jail. I was the only one who drove
there. But before I left, I had to make a car payment, and I said to myself ""make the bed for Jordan Peterson"".
In an era that has overemphasized rights (as Mary Ann Glendon pointed out), he reminds us of
responsibilities, and their importance for being a socially desirable person, among other things.

In recent years, both he and his wife have been seriously ill, and he praised her for responding
with strength that he may not have had. His daughter has also been seriously sick at times.
He emphasizes that the world is a tough place, with bears, dragons, the cold north trying to
kill its people, and queens like Maleficent and authoritarian kings. Maleficent turns into a dragon
and that's normal in the story, but what if Queen Elizabeth did? He shows the importance of
stories, such as Beowulf, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. Basically, he is exposing his more
academic work Maps of Meaning, which is heavily influenced by Jungian types and the religious
myths studied by Mircea Eliade. For me as a Catholic thinker, it reminds me of Louis Bouyer's
Invisible Father and the development of myth, ritual and rational theology. Peterson's theological
and metaphysical framework appears to be flexible, but he knows the concepts and what they
have meant throughout history. He knows the Jewish and Christian stories and beliefs, but also
Islam and Eastern spirituality. I laughed when he said ""nobody says, Dad, read me the periodic
table"", they want a story. I actually did have a great affection for the periodic table as a kid.
Peterson is eccentric, as a British (I think) journal's review pointed out-he claims to have viewed
1.2 million paintings, a thousand a day for four years. This was in the chapter ""make one room
in your house beautiful"", the sequel to clean your room and make your bed.

The first new rule discusses society and institutions. Freud and Jung, although essential, were
too individual. We need relationships that draw us out of ourselves into love for the other,
which in turn develops the self. We need both change and tradition. Avoid ideology. There's solid
advice on romance and marriage. You don't find the right one, you make it. There are billions of
people and millions could have been suitable for you, so yeah you probably missed someone
better. There's good wisdom on intimacy as it relates to affairs. Think about children when you
are fertile, don't begin in your 40s when it's too late. There's also a nice discussion of friendship.
High school and college friendships can endure even if you were randomly thrown together
as roommates. But by your 40s, your personality has crystallized. Some high school friends
I've maintained friendships with and developed; others were great friendships back then but
we've become different people. We still can exchange affectionate greetings, but it's not going
to be a consistent relationship because we've become different people.

Three of the chapters are devoted to solid principles of recovery spirituality. These are writing
and taking inventory of past traumas, overcoming resentment, and living in gratitude. This
book is an affirmation of existence over nihilism. Nietzsche is treated with respect, a figure
of tragedy more than arrogance. But ultimately, as Fulton Sheen put it, life is worth living.
This is not by denying the chaos, tragedy and pain of life, but acknowledging it and responding
in love, humility, honesty and gratitude.

Peterson argues against all ideologies. Environmental ideology, for instance, argues that the
world would be better without people. He includes conservatism among ideologies, while
acknowledging conservative tendencies. Peterson has been portrayed as an ideologue because
of the polarization of Trump supporters vs. the identity politics of race, sex and gender, which
get us caught in power analysis, and ultimately trapped in resentful attitudes. Life is painful
and difficult, and yet good, no matter where in society the other person is coming from, and
what their family and life experiences are. This book shows the nuances of his thought, which
are quite different from how he is portrayed by the advocates of identity politics and
political correctness.",4,2021/03/03
"Our times have seen few individuals capable of standing back from the details of our lives with sufficient clarity to describe ways of thinking that possess the potential to answer the hardest questions asked by our generation. Thank you, Dr Peterson for your contribution to push forward the good in our lives.",5,2022/12/27
"Since the publication of his previous book, 12 RULES FOR LIFE, JP has had a host of medical challenges. His daughter has been ill; his wife has been gravely ill and he himself has been seriously ill. These illnesses did not just remind him of life’s transience and fragility; they destabilized his life in profound ways. As a result of those experiences his new book is itself very serious, very personal and, at times, quite dark. He emphasizes the tragic elements of human life, though he also offers wise counsel for how to conjure with them.

The twelve new rules are as follows: (1) We need rules but we also need to make creative adjustments to them; (2) Be heroic; bring order out of chaos but revivify stultified law that has atrophied; (3) Don’t let serious problems fester because you’re afraid to face them; (4) Life becomes more meaningful as responsibility is embraced; (5) Do not do a job that you hate; (6) Do not succumb to simpleminded ideologies; (7) Do one thing very, very well; (8) Art and beauty are the bedrock of civilization; surround yourself with it; (9) Move beyond bad memories by understanding them and writing them down; (10) Keep romance in your marriage; (11) Don’t be arrogant, deceitful or resentful; (12) Be grateful in spite of your suffering.

These are all first-rate rules and while they have certain commonalities (the need to take responsibility for yourself and the need to combat chaos, e.g.) they are also independent of one another in the sense that they do not follow logically one from the other. In other words, this is not a tightly-argued book with twelve closely-related chapters. It is an extended reflection on twelve rules (he could have offered 25 or 50). He is at his best when he draws on all of his resources: his knowledge of psychology, his knowledge of myth/ritual/religion, his clinical experience, his personal experience, his general wisdom based on broad reading. Hence, the top chapter is probably #2, on heroism, a subject that repeats throughout the others.

My only criticism of the book is that he may be hitting the tragic elements of life a tad too insistently, probably as a result of his recent experiences. If I could editorialize a bit, I particularly liked the chapter (8) on art and beauty (“Try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible”). I would add to his comments the notion that we should not just be surrounded by beautiful objects, we should be constantly in touch with the genius of great art (and great thought in general). In the contemporary world we tend to err on the side of ‘democracy’—celebrating ‘everyone’s truth’ and ‘giving voice to the voiceless’. We should not forget to give voice to the brilliant and we should not forget to extend ourselves and not just seek cultural artefacts that are ‘like us’ or reflect our own biases or limited experience. We should be in touch with greatness if we are to grow, to expand our vistas and our imaginations. That means preserving our great traditions and celebrate singular achievement and singular genius. JP surely agrees with that; one of the hallmarks of his thought is the Burkean notion of the importance of our cultural, intellectual and religious traditions and the manner in which they can inform the present and future. I would simply have liked to have heard more from him on the subject.

One other brief comment: his walking the fine line between rules and creative adjustments to them should be a rule for all. Many of our contemporaries seem mired in the past while others seek to escape the past entirely. We need balance here. We need to preserve what works and what is necessary but we also need to embrace new opportunities and, with the growth of knowledge and experience, grow ourselves. This commonsensical approach sometimes appears to be impossible within our current political condition.

Bottom line: a must-read from the public intellectual who is actually changing the world in changing the lives and thought of millions of readers.",5,2021/03/11
History will record Jordan Peterson as one of humankind’s great thinkers. People will ponder and think about his ideas for centuries to come.,5,2022/12/18
"Dr. Peterson’s strikingly personal account of his struggle with his family’s serious physical illnesses as well as his own addiction, recovery and associated mental and physical illness—including pneumonia—in Canadian, American, Russian and Serbian facilities is perhaps the most moving element of his work. If you only read one chapter of this book, read the “Overture,” where he notes:

…it is also true that the meaningful immersion in what I was writing, which continued during the entire time that I have related—excepting my unconscious month in Russia—provided me both with a reason to live and a means of testing the viability of the thoughts with which I wrestled.

To me, his struggle with disease and suffering is evident in the somber and more nuanced approach of Beyond Order—not an optimistic American-style self-help guide like 12 Rules for Life, but a diary of psychological discovery and insights informed by the tremendous suffering of the authors tormented soul. Which makes it a better book, in my opinion, because this time Dr. Peterson not only talked the talk but walked the walk. Thus, the book not only provides advice but also a concrete example of how to live, in its testimony. Perhaps not quite the visit of Er to the underworld in Plato’s Republic, but almost.

No wonder Dr. Peterson’s writing recalls classic myths about trips to hell and back by Orpheus, Odysseus, Psyche, Heracles, Alcestis, Aeneas, Hippolytus, Theseus or Sissyphus, among others:

Is it not possible (even though it may not always deliver us from the terrible situation we find ourselves in) that we would all be more able to deal with the uncertainty, the horrors of nature, the tyranny of culture, and the malevolence of ourselves and others if we were better and more courageous people? If we strived toward higher values? If we were more truthful? Wouldn’t the beneficial elements of experience be more likely to manifest themselves around us? Is it not possible, if your goals were noble enough, your courage adequate, your aim at the truth unerring, that the Good thereby produced would…well, not justify the horror? That is not exactly right, but it still comes close. Such attitudes and actions might at least provide us with meaning sufficient to stop our encounter with that terror and horror from corrupting us and turning the surrounding world into something all too closely resembling hell.

His struggle has convinced him that reason has its limits, and experience is a powerful teacher. While reason may be sufficient to understand order, it is insufficient to withstand chaos such as he experienced:

…chaos is where what we do not expect or have remained blind to leaps forward from the potential that surrounds us. The fact that something has occurred many times in the past is no guarantee that it will continue to occur in the same manner. There exists, externally, a domain beyond what we know and can predict. Chaos in anomaly, novelty, unpredictability, transformation, disruption, and all too often, descent, as what we have come to take for granted reveals itself to be unreliable.

Descent into the hell of addiction, withdrawal, illness and recovery, in the case of Dr. Peterson’s long voyage into the underworld and back. His journey is what makes his testimony a powerful argument for the notion of redemption through suffering, in keeping with traditional imitation of Christ in general, and Russian Orthodox tradition in particular, especially Doestoevsky’s near-death experiences which led him to find God following a mock execution and years of cruel Siberian exile.",5,2021/09/08

I loved this book. It offered a lot of value and reinforced a lot of what I had been taught as a child and was greatly uplifting for me. Great source to maintain that moral compass.,5,2022/11/23
"When I read and reviewed the first 12 Rules for Life book, I described it as a sort of self-help book for people who don't like self-help books. Present was the distillation of common sensical (but often unarticulated) ideas, but absent were the trite catch phrases and easy fixes that plague much of the genre. I'm pleased to report that the same can be said of this second volume.

While this is ostensibly a self-help book that distills important psychological ideas into a dozen simple ""rules"" for living a better, more meaningful, and more productive life, it's much more than that. It's a wide-ranging treatise on psychology, philosophy, theology, and occasionally even politics (though not too much, and always in a fairly balanced treatment). It's true that the rules themselves are somewhat simplistic--some might even say self-evident. And that's a fair statement. The value in such a book as this, though, is less in the list of rules as they can be read in the table of contents, but in the immeasurably rich explanations and analyses that explain--at a remarkably deep level--the sound psychological, philosophical, historical, theological, mythological, and narrative reasons for each of the rules.

The author has an amazing talent for seamlessly combining important ideas from all of these disparate fields in a manner that manages to be accessible to a wide audience without ever speaking down or boring readers who are already familiar with his subjects. It's a rare book indeed that can transition so effortlessly between discussions of cognitive neuroscience to the Bible to Harry Potter and back.

That's true of both this book and its predecessor (to which I also gave a five-star review). However, I have to say in all honesty, this book manages to escape the all too common pitfalls of sequels and indeed might even surpass the original (though I maintain that it's best read less as a sequel and more as a second volume of a single long work). Admittedly, some of the examples revisit subjects already familiar from the previous book (or from Peterson's other writings or lectures), but these few stories are important enough that they bear repeating. More importantly, the new material is invariably fascinating, filled with historical notes, literary analyses, scriptural interpretations, and--my personal favorites--psychological case studies.

With regard to that last category, this book manages to accomplish something remarkable: it is a self-help book that does not insult the psychologically literate reader. Instead, it draws deeply from the psychological literature (particularly the psychoanalysts, though certainly not limited to them alone) and might even inspire some readers to pursue further study of psychology or even a career in clinical practice.

Most importantly, the book differentiates itself from the bulk of its genre by eschewing the easy and the feel-good in favor of the real and the substantial. There are no trite mantras, no happy cliches, no greeting card philosophies. Instead, there are real--often brutal, but equally often hopeful--psychological insights. This is the kind of self-help book that could genuinely help the reader who heeds its advice, precisely because it offers oft-difficult substance rather than simple but ultimately meaningless pronouncements.

At a time when much of the world seems shallowly moored at best--and completely unmoored at worst--this book is a godsend for those looking to lead a more meaningful (and with any luck, happier) existence. I cannot recommend it (and its predecessor, though you can easily read the books in any order) highly enough.",5,2021/03/03
It’s a really helpful factual book,5,2022/11/27
"Dr. Peterson's first book, with its white cover, provided guidelines to improve your life when conditions are normal. Simple advice, with concrete guidance, to incrementally make each day a little better than the last. Nobody could've predicted the trials and tribulations Dr. Peterson would be exposed to after that first book's publication. These are covered in detail in the overture and include him waking up in Russia tethered to his bed, with fatal illnesses and lots of medication preceding. His second book, with its black cover, provides 12 more rules to follow when life inevitably doesn't follow the plan. When the assumed order underlying the first book falls apart and chaos takes over.

This book is written as you would expect, with an intense, fast-past narrative filled with personal anecdotes and historical and biblical references. Blunt and straightforward advice and cautions. Dr. Peterson has become world-famous and you will hear his inimitable voice and tone as you read. His writing is dense, many sentences will cause you to stop and think before proceeding. I don't recall the first book being as serious as this one, but that makes sense given the change in underlying premises. I've included below the 12 follow on rules, as well as the initial 12.

From Beyond Order:
1. Do Not Carelessly Denigrate Social Institutions or Creative Achievement
2. Imagine Who You Could Be and Then Aim Single-Mindedly At That
3. Do NOt Hide Unwanted Things in the Fog
4. Notice That Opportunity Lurks Where Responsibility Has Been Abdicated
5. Do Not Do What You Hate
6. Abandon Ideology
7. Work As Hard As You Possibly Can On At Least One Thing and See What Happens
8. Try to Make One Room in Your Home as Beautiful as Possible
9. If Old Memories Still Upset You, Write Them Down Carefully and Completely
10. Plan and Work Diligently to Maintain the Romance in your Relationship
11. Do Not Allow Yourself to Become Resentful, Deceitful, or Arrogant
12. Be Grateful in Spite of Your Suffering

Original 12 Rules for Life
1. Stand Up Straight with Your Shoulders Back
2. Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible for Helping
3. Make Friends with People who want the Best for You
4. Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not to Who Someone Else is Today
5. Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them
6. Set Your House in Perfect Order Before You Criticize the World
7. Pursue What is Meaningful (Not What is Expedient)
8. Tell The Truth- or, at least, Don't Lie
9. Assume that the Person You Are Listening to might know something that you don't
10. Be Precise in Your Speech
11. Do Not Bother Children When they are Skateboarding
12. Pet a Cat When You Encounter One on the Street",5,2021/03/11
"We all know this, that after a huge, fabulous and highly-successful first of anything, following up is a tough call. The first 12 Rules for Life was such a delight, and a lovely introduction to some pretty highbrow philosophical mainstays that most people wouldn't easily face, that I had wondered, as I finished it a year or two ago, just WHAT Dr. Peterson would/could/might write next. That didn't matter much, of course, as that first ""12 Rules..."" was so brimming with great food for thought that I figured I could just flip it over and re-read it, a lot and for a long while, until whatever follow-up came out.

My first impressions, on navigating its first dozen or so pages, was that it ""felt"" different from the first, a bit more intimate, and bit less academic and footnotey, but just as direct and linguistically precise. That's always a treat. There is a feeling, when reading Dr. Peterson, that he weighs his words very carefully (as he of course also recommends that we all strive to do) and that despite the great care he takes to wrap his ideas in just the right expressions, he never loses his trademark down-to-earth style and clear accessibility. Many with his academic credentials and experience would quickly sound lofty and a bit stilted in similar complicated landscapes of thought, but Dr. Peterson somehow keeps it fresh and within reach. That's not to say that any of this is ""light"" reading, as it is far too substantial to deserve such a label, but it feels more like deep, demanding and insightful conversation at a friend's house, than any sort of one-way lecture at some haughty institution. Indeed, there are many passages which are downright funny, plainly or a few layers beneath the obvious, and they serve to underline that dinner-conversation feeling, which keeps this book and its former near-namesake totally enjoyable, sweetly challenging and, at times, brutally direct. We are all on a similar journey, of grand, wonderful and sometimes despicable humanity, trying to dodge responsibility, cheat the game, choke our conscience, cover our tracks and protect the worst parts of ourselves, for some silly reason... Dr. Peterson reminds us of all that (and quite a bit more) and he manages to do this with total inclusivity, without talking ""down"" to anyone, making it clear that he too faces pretty much the same challenges, which spare no one. That kind of wisdom, paradoxically, could come from your favorite farmer, guru, midwife or bus-stop stranger, but Dr. Peterson does a much better job getting those thoughts on paper. The book is a gem. Lazy thinkers or change-reluctant readers may resist the workout, but they'll lose out. This is not a tough read, but it's not pop-psychology either.",5,2021/05/06
What can I say! JP has become my hero. Both his books have been clear thinking processes that will benefit all who read them.,5,2022/10/21
"His 2 books make an excellent pairing.

The difference between the two books, according to Peterson, is that the first focuses ""more on the dangers of an excess of chaos"", while the second is more concerned ""with the dangers of too much structure"". Peterson says that 12 Rules ""argues for the merits of a more conservative view of the world"" while Beyond Order ""argues for the merits of a more liberal view"".
In this book, the next set of 12 complementary rules are

1. ""Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement.""
2. ""Imagine who you could be and then aim single-mindedly at that.""
3. ""Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.""
4. ""Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.""
5. ""Do not do what you hate.""
6. ""Abandon ideology.""
7. ""Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.""
8. ""Try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible.""
9. ""If old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and completely.""
10. ""Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship.""
11. ""Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.""
12. ""Be grateful in spite of your suffering.""",4,2022/05/09
"“Beyond Order”, by Jordan B. Peterson, has 12 new rules; 12 MORE rules for your life, to help you manage the chaos.
It’s readable, but not easily. In order to potentially benefit from this tome, you’ll need to pay attention and work at it. Peterson is a professor, as well as a clinical psychologist, and it is evident in his writing.

The book begins with a recap of Peterson and his family’s considered challenges with health issues over the last few years. It’s presented factually but I wonder if it was meant to raise empathy for the coming content. He also advised that he, along with his publisher, decided to keep the topic of COVID out of the book, for reader’s benefit. OK, groundwork laid.

RULE I - Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement

The first half is fairly self explanatory, you could figure it out with common sense. The second half? Buckle up. There’s a hodgepodge of literary texts including Jung, Freud, JK Rowling, Disney Fairytales, the Bible - all that are used for this introductory discussion. Included with the literary are examples from Peterson’s practice and teaching experience. It’s all interesting but when boiled down, one man’s opinion, bending writing of other’s to suit him, especially scripture.

I’m not going to take the time to note all the rules, this review would be massive. To summarize, Peterson wants us to pay more attention to the folks we love, to nurture the relationships, put in the work to make them healthy. While we’re at being healthy, mental and emotional health should be handled by professionals. Yup, he drops in commercials, erudite tho’ they may be. He wants us to have beauty around us, in our lives. The attempts at biblical application in these areas are very far from what most conservative/ reformed people accept, it’s amazing to me that this author is accused of being “ Alt Right” or “Conservative”.

Peterson closes with RULE XII - Be grateful in spite of your suffering

Suffering is mentioned a lot over the course of the book and the over all tenor is dark and serious. It’s also completely without humor. It’s hard for me to fathom that with a career as long and varied as this author has experienced, he couldn’t include a few vignettes of a lighter nature that would illustrate his points. When I love, I laugh, a lot. Love is patient, kind...not erudite and factual, at least not for most people. Be grateful. I am - the book is over.

On the positive side, Peterson encourages personal responsibility and the tending of your most intimate relationships, (family, friends, love). On the negative, trying to get to that information is a chore and then some. His literary bending, especially unorthodox use of scripture and its application, was just too hard for me to ignore and quite frankly, invalidated many of his conclusions, for me. When I have a few moments of quiet, I plan to reread these 12 rules over again, but only 1 at a time. I want to see if it makes a different impression reading them in smaller doses, “Beyond Order”📚",3,2021/03/02
"I've been a fan of Dr. Peterson's since he broke into the limelight a couple of years ago. His thorough, serious stance on gender and the realities of life hit me hard as a woman in my late twenties. I did not like the conviction with which he communicated his views because his statements shook me and got me to face things in my own life I'd been quietly overlooking.

I enjoyed his first book--the rules broke fresh ground and had me consider issues of hierarchy, resentment and precision of speech in new and profound ways. I followed his political scandals, one after another, all the while putting his wisdom into practice as best I could.

Then his health took a nosedive and quarantine happened. Like many, I was concerned for Dr. Peterson's health, but I also began to wonder if the very philosophy he embodied with such conviction might not have had something to do with his catastrophic descent into chaos.

I began to wonder if the dead seriousness with which he built his knowledge and with which he tried to address our collective morality might not have become so heavy and one-sided that it doubled back on him and pulled him under. After all, the political scandals which befell him and which he courageously took head on with truth and seriousness were ultimately part of the larger turning of the wheel of mass media, creating scandals so as to keep people entertained and the money pouring in. In that light, Dr. Peterson's seriousness began to work against him; to feel heavy-handed; it seemed increasingly absurd to me that his proposal to take on the full burden of life with utter seriousness--a worthy message, no doubt--was being widely circulated through the mass media which itself operates on scandal, conflict and the carnivalesque (see Moeller's The Moral Fool). I wonder if the lack of humor with which Dr. Peterson confronted the subversive chaos of mass media is the equivalent of Harry Potter confronting Voldemort without carrying a piece of the dark lord's soul within himself. (Fans of Dr. Peterson's work will see where I was trying to go with that example.)

When COVID happened, everyone got a taste of the chaos first hand. Everyone suffered and tried their best to deal with it. In my case at least, the most difficult part of dealing with this collective catastrophe was keeping enough perspective to continue to let in light; to continue to see the levity in each situation even as the routines I took to be my life began to crack and reveal the unevenness I'd actually been depending upon since day one.

The release of this second volume, then, really seemed to hit the wrong note. The book was more Dense Seriousness, more rules, more deep philosophizing about abstract ideas in a time where everyone had little bandwidth for abstraction.

Dr. Peterson's ideas broke into the masses due to their serious nature, which stood in contrast to the carnivalesque churning of the mass media as we know it today. But without a touch of the carnivalesque in the Rules themselves, their application renders us too stiff and one-sided: terrible qualities in times of true uncertainty.

I am greatly indebted to Dr. Peterson's work. I would not have even come to these conclusions were it not for my having gained so much from his ideas in the first place. Having said that, the absence of humor, of play, in Dr. Peterson's work is something I've increasingly become aware of and is something readers should keep in view when absorbing this great man's writings.",3,2021/05/26
"Jordan Peterson is such an insightful, intelligent, and inspiring man.",5,2022/10/09
"I think this book is clearly an expansion upon the ideas established in his previous book 12 Rules For Life: An Antidote To Chaos.

As Dr. Peterson has been doing for years, he frames his discussion as balancing the dichotomy of chaos and order. The previous book was focused on the first half of the equation, establishing order when things become too chaotic, while this book attempts to explain the need for a certain amount of chaos to to stave off tyrannical order. Collectively the books try to mark out actionable steps on can take to achieve a proper balance between chaos, a place of creativity and exploration, and order, a place of stability and safety, in ones own life; as too much of either is detrimental in the views of the author.

Dr. Peterson re-examines a number of examples from his previous book to demonstrate how once order is established, it can become tyrannical. He also delves deeply into new and interesting illustrations to exemplify drawing oneself out of a life of tyrannical order.

As is generally the case for Dr. Peterson, he has not reduced this texts to terms so simple as to drain them of their value. What he speaks to is genuinely complicated and thus the text equally nuanced. Don’t expect to come away from this book with the full understanding of the workings of universe, you may need a careful reread for that. But you might just come away with some well founded ways to improve the way you live your life.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first read through of this book and look forward to many future rereads. There always seems to be more to glean from a Jordan Peterson book than one is able to ascertain a first glance. I also look forward to future books expanding further on established ideas or exploring totally new topics. I am never disappointed by a Jordan Peterson book, nor do I ever really seem to be finished reading them.

"4.5 out of 5 stars.

Say you're in Texas. And you watch the start of a thunderstorm after a few weeks without rain from your front porch, door, or window. You might be delighted by the wind change, the lightning, the thunder, then the building crescendo of big raindrops. After a few minutes you see the ground soaking up the rain. You say, ""Man, we really needed this."" It fills you with a little awe and wonder.

That was like Peterson's book, <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</i>.

But, after an hour of rain, you're no longer watching. No more awe and wonder. You kind of worry about it flooding. You're glad the crops, the lawns, the lakes, et cetera, are getting the water, but you're not pumped like you were when the rain started.

That's kind of like Peterson's <i>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</i>.

It's nice to have, but you're not as wowed as you were the first time. But it does seem to be a bit of an afterthought, an addition, and an unnecessary one. I mean, the former was ""12 RULES FOR LIFE!""; this one is ""Oh yeah, here are 12 more if you need 'em.""

Not to say that Peterson's sparkling wit, psychological cases, and literary/mythological/cultural references aren't interesting, welcome, or right. They are. And some of this work quite shines, and should be trumpeted. Particularly important and interesting is Rule VI, ""Abandon Ideology,"" especially its trenchant takedown of Marxism, Critical Theory, and Postmodernism. ""This kind of theorizing is particularly attractive to people who are smart but lazy"" (p. 171). A biting and true statement of most of academe if there ever was one.",4,2021/10/14
"Peterson is an absolute blessing to all of those who have heard his insights. This book explains ideas with both depth and clarity. For me, my journey with JP began with lobsters and I've enjoyed everything since.",5,2022/09/18
"The catastrophic over-diagnosis of ‘neurosis’ in these trying times is taken to task, lest all end up as ‘neurotics’ for good.

This book was not only more personal and heartfelt than its predecessor, but also had a slightly more authentic tone throughout. One can almost see the wisdom of this man's conscience develop from the previous book 12 Rules for Life, to this book Beyond Order. Much of it is indeed a rephrasing and rehashing of his previous book, but a great deal is refreshingly novel and some things even just straight unexpected. One might feel like a hero of heroes just by reading certain aspects and 'scenes' of the book. Anyone who found 12 rules for life beneficial is almost sure to find this also, as one might say, an added layer of gold knightly armor to lay upon the previous layer. In addition if you or someone you know or love, is involved with benzodiazepines or other anti-psychotic medications, or is struggling with them, then this book will help you understand how you are not alone regarding such serious and sometimes even, life and death serious; problems. The attention drawn to the societal ignorance regarding benzodiazepines and other (potentially) dangerous medication is brought to the fore.

Hits Hard On the inevitableness of both anxiety and acute depression as an ever present and eternal threat that only the ‘Hero within’ can slay. Anxiety does not imply the ‘Need’ for anti-psychotics. Anxiety is normal phenomenon and can easily be a necessary precursor to further development,(one’s unconscious simply demanding that you start exercising for example!) and not, as many say, pathological, and these points are driven home perhaps better than any other.",5,2021/03/02
"Such a thought-provoking book, mini profound and useful ideas and writings. We really appreciate it! And it arrived in perfect condition and timely.",5,2022/09/20
"I can't even describe how much the previous 12 Rules For Life worked on me. I have said this for a very long time regarding Jordan Peterson, he is the thinker that puts words to my unorganized thoughts. There are obviously many new ideas that I learn from him, consisting of thoughts from a myriad of other great thinkers that he has has read and researched in his life/career, however, one frequent thing that I have happen to me when I am reading his work or listening to him is, finally having the words to attach to ideas that I already knew to be true.

Beyond Order, in my opinion, delves deeper than the previous 12 Rules For Life. Although I loved that book and will read it again for a 3rd time, there were moments where I felt certain chapters could have been shorter in order to get his point across (and a great length); although I understand his reason for writing it the way that he did, because they were all fully fleshed out complex ideas that he as been thinking about for a long long time that would not have been done justice had he not written about them in full detail. With this book however, I felt that it managed to have that same sort of intrigue and fleshing out of ideas without that similar feeling I had of the chapters being too long.

Like every person I battle with the tragedies of life, occasional temporal feeling of loneliness (especially considering covid), and vast intellectual questions regarding many other struggles. This book has helped me tighten my focus with certain aspects of my life, and better organize myself. I am excited to learn more from it, as well as Jordan as time continues and if life permits.

Thank you Dr. Peterson,
God bless everyone",5,2021/03/23
"Jordan Peterson has unlimited compassion for all people. He has seen it all and has not given up. If you follow his advice in his books, you will have a better life. Life decisions will be clearer and life choices will be easier. Most importantly, you will know who you are and what you want. The added enjoyment is that Jordan Peterson reads the book to you personally.",5,2022/07/18
"No matter what book i pick, as philosophy or psychology, there is always things that i agree with , things i am learning and things i totally disagree with.
It's also the case with this second book of Rules for Life by Dr Peterson.
I was letting down by the religious aspects and ideas ( i don't follow religion and i don't believe in a divine power), but i understand also that the Bible also preaches other things along religion.
I am very well ""trained"" in mythology ( the book has a lot of it), i liked that part but for those that don't know much about it, it can be a letdown.
I always believe and i agree that, first of all , we have to fix our own self to be a better person and to achieve a better life and to be happy and also to understand our past our mistakes and to try to fix those aspects as well in order to "" win"" against anxiety or depression.
However, as most psychologists argue ( or maybe i did not understood his message well about this aspect ), i do believe that the world is full of people that are creating problems can't be changed or saved. I don't believe that actually a lot of people can be helped. They cannot be and we should stop trying.
These people are the result of immature, irresponsible, pure evil parents that should not had kids from the beginning.
I don't hold any qualifications on this field, but i can't close my eyes and lie to myself that if i clean my room, the world would be a better place. I will be a better person, yes.
It's always a challenge when you pick up books like these.
Dr Peterson remains, however , one of the best thinkers we had. Ina very long time.",4,2021/05/30
"2020 will go down in history for my generation (and Generation Z) as one of the most insane, unhinged years in human history. It was a year that generated unemployment, uncertainty, fear, depression, and, of course, chaos. For Dr. Peterson, chaos is one of the most paradoxical elements of existence. It can inspire fear, but also courage; it can paralyze us into depression, but also invoke a sense of hope; and it throw us into stagnation, but also spark the internal flame of creativity. When each of comes face-to-face with chaos, Dr. Peterson wants us to answer one simple question: what will be our reaction? Will we lay on the floor, curl into the fetal position, and admit defeat, or will we stand straight, push our chest out, and embrace untapped potential? This question defines the thesis of Beyond Order. More importantly, it's a central idea that Dr. Peterson has routinely talked about in his speeches. When I came into contact with Dr. Peterson's ideas for the first time, one of the first videos I watched was his presentation on the psychological and symbolic nature of Biblical stories. In his analysis on the story of Genesis, he points out that God brings forth meaning and existence from an endless void. Chaos can be daunting, but it can also be the catalyst for bringing forth something bigger in ourselves, or the world around us. The rules in Beyond Order can provide you with the foundation for doing so.

In 12 Rules for Life, Dr. Peterson taught us how to solidify order in our lives. A foundation of stability is beneficial to us all, but to deny yourself the courage to step into the unknown is an open door invitation to personal stagnation. Find your courage and embrace the unknown.",5,2021/03/06
Dr. Peterson is a genius! Brilliant and important information for daily living presented in simplistic style. I'm an avid learner about human development. This book and Dr. Peterson's prior books are essential to read to truly embrace a quality life and family!,5,2022/08/15
"I echo the others’ comments. Peterson has magnified our responsibilities to ourselves and each other over the last several years. Humbled to have lived to hear his lectures, learn through his experiences and interpretations of countless clinicians, and apply these principles to my life.

It is unfortunate that writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, hired by Marvel hired in 2015 to write the Black Panther comics and currently Captain America series’ author, has chosen to attack Peterson and used catchphrases from JP’s books as the inspiration for Captain America’s nemesis. Respectfully, I have read both authors, and this world has room for both men and their messages. I am ashamed that Coates chose his platform to send such a message.
Instead of hating, I would ask Coates to please personally read (and absorb) the messages in JP’s books before attacking someone’s character in such a tone deaf way. Shock and awe is not the way. Try again, sir.

David Goggins, Ayaan Hirsi Ali , Tim Ferriss, Joe Rogan, Jocko Willink, Candace, Matthew McConaughey, Wim Hoff, and many others all seem to find points of disagreement and commonality with JP but don’t throw stones. Question is: Why do you? Or is that the point - zero conflict resolution.

Lastly -
As Corey Friedman phenomenally summed up in his article: “Coates overlooked the downside to writing a rival into a timeless tale, rendering him immortal in a narrative sense.”

Thank you, Professor, for putting another gem into our toolbox. Keep the books coming!",5,2021/04/18
"For being one of the most wise and intellectual minds of today, he portrays such humility. This review isn't even so much about the book, as I've not read it all yet. But I know it will not disappoint me, and be every bit invigorating and helpful just as it's predecessor was. I watched a recent video of him on youtube where he discusses the book a bit. He mentioned how he doesn't understand why people have been so patient with him, so encouraging and eagerly awaiting his return. I love this man, and I have prayed for his recovery. I have prayed for his family's well being and recovery as well. I pray nothing but blessings upon the Peterson's. I am grateful for him and his work. If he is to ever read this review, we've been so patient with you because we genuinely love you, what you are and what you do. You've changed the course of lives, impacted millions positively. You're a sage, a wonderful husband to Tammy, a mentor and a teacher, a leader, a strong father figure and a God send. We don't care that your own life fell apart in the sense that you have no right to give advice. We care that you're genuine, sincere and transparent in your own struggles. Life is suffering, indisputable. Right? None of us are perfect and God bless that we don't have to be, because who could shoulder that burden? Thank you for being you, on behalf of all us who support you.",5,2021/03/04
"The book is solid and well passed. I like the fact that it doesn't linger on biblical passages like the first one for instance. I also enjoyed that this book has more clinical anecdotes for each rule. That being said, there are some things that I didn't like so much:
a) I didn't get a strong connection with the rules and the examples/anecdotes this time around.
b) The Immersion Reading (hearing the audiobook at the same time that reading the eBook) is not well implemented here. There are substancial differences throughout the audiobook and the eBook that makes almost impossible to enjoy it. Sometimes the narration includes some footnote and the eBook doesn't highlight it and instead waits until the narration continues on the chapter that you are and sometimes the text deviates from what the narration is saying (it is clear that the audiobook is from a revised copy).
c) There aren't many curious facts (like the famous lobster one) in this sequel. I feel that this such a shame because this provided the first book with a change of pace; a little rest if you will.

All in all, Beyond Order is a good sequel with some minor annoyances, but worth your time nevertheless; finally, I want to say that the artwork is fantastic and seems like the one that you could encounter in classical books like in John Milton's Paradise Lost or some other epic poem.",4,2021/07/07
"Not a casual read, you have to be prepared to concentrate, but it is so worth it.",5,2022/08/17
"Great read for anyone, I enjoyed it.",5,2022/08/30
Engrossing. Truly eye and soul opening. The inability to represent this book with mere words should leave you curious enough to purchase. One of the few permanent additions to my library.,5,2022/07/25
Excellent author,4,2022/08/21
"I’ve read both 12 Rules and Beyond Order. The author manages some valuable insights but discovering those gems felt cumbersome due to his wordiness. Just felt a shorter, more direct narrative would have sufficed.",4,2022/05/20
"Enjoyable read, read the first one, liked it, so I ordered this one as well. Jordan Peterson is more than anything a father figure for those who grew up without one, he tries to advice young people on what to do (like a parent) and helps the younger generation better understand what is expected of young adults in a world that is foreign to them due to their lack of experience with it at such an age.

It's mostly common sense, and advice to help people understand how they should handle their life, and to better inform them on how to engage with others in the work place, or in social gatherings, ect just stuff like this, and how to stay overall positive, and motivated to reach your goals further through life. His first book helped me, I lost my father at a young age and I was bitter over it, I had no one to blame and I deeply wanted to blame someone (the world in general) over time though I came to realize this is something we all experience, and it was simply our time.

We are all equal in that respect, and with time I came to accept that and move on.",5,2021/03/22
"Jordan Peterson gets an extremely bad rap for being someone he's not by many of my fellow left leaning people. In fact the only reason i started watching his youtube videos (college lectures mostly) was because i just had to see more about this ""bigot"" but was immediately surprised at just how off based i was. i went from watching a video or 2 just nitpick his perceived flawed ideas to actually realizing something crazy. i was agreeing with everything he said. if you take off the outrage goggles and listen to his actual message you'll realize what he's saying isn't that outrageous. what's outrageous is what people THINK he's saying due to an oversimplification or something taken out of context. after devouring this book jordan's ability to relay extremely dense information in a light and casual way makes a night binge reading very relaxing. this book will change the way you look at things throughout your life. it's not a self help book or anything so silly and artificial. it has genuine coherent information that will make you a happier more fulfilled person. get this book and read it as soon as you can.",5,2021/07/13
Loved the book. High quality cover and binding as well.,5,2022/07/31
"Being familiar with JBP via YouTube for a few years now, this is my first book by him. I get the feeling I should have read Maps of Meaning and Twelve Rules for Life first.....although it's certainly not necessary in order to benefit from this read. It's such a pleasure to read someone who uses language so precisely. The risk is that sometimes it seems to take forever to get to the point, but you will not fail to understand the lesson.

Probably not fair to judge without having read the other works, but his message comes through so well when you watch him speak. Books don't capture his wit and humility. The chapter illustrations are very thought provoking; He had an interesting interview with the illustrator a few months back.

At any rate, there are no surprises here, and you will finish the book thinking that you really do need to clean up your room.",4,2021/08/22
"Not as good as the first book, which I read much more carefully than this one. So perhaps I'm not being perfectly fair. The first installment was an easy five stars and this one not far behind it.",4,2022/03/30
"Peterson does an excellent job decoding the insanity off today. Reading this offers a depth of clarity that is not spoken of in normal conversations. However, it arms you to have dialogue about right and wrong and why we need to stand for our values even, or possibly especially, when attacked verbally. Being able to articulate why one stands where they stand on a topic is a dying characteristic of modern conversations.

I have liberal friends that can’t defend their points without ad hominem attacks. I had one apologize just yesterday for a conversation last week where all I did was ask a question and then let him respond. Luckily my friend thought about his reaction afterwards and realized that not only was he triggered but responded in an uncivilized way.

We are still friends. It worked for me. It can work for you too, but you must prepare for the attack beforehand.

I highly recommend this book.",5,2021/09/07
"While it is objectively true that a majority of these ideas are distilled and restated from other sources, it needs to be said that this is one of the most educational, refreshing, and necessitated works of this generation. It comes at an absolutely crucial time, when some of these topics truly need to be talked about, and he expresses these thoughts from the perspective of someone with experience and a truly loving heart. This is the influence that many of us need. While some of the science is hard to stomach, the discussed material is eye-opening and critical to discern, whether on an individual or larger basis. All of that being said, I appreciate this work very much!",5,2022/01/07
"Amazing! So far an amazing book. I just finished 12 rules for life again yesterday before this release. That book saved me especially over the last year. Buy this book and the first one. Don't fall in the trap that the media tries to set about the quality of character of Jordan Peterson. He only wants what's best for everyone in the world. Truly a light in the darkness.

Edit: Well I picked it up and didn't put it down until I finished it. Amazing content. I watch a lot of his online lectures and his voice really shined through in this book. Felt like he was speaking his personal knowledge directly to me. I couldn't recommend it more.",5,2021/03/02
"Peterson again describes the human condition, and specifically the motivations towards ideology and resentment. Not only does he understand the reasoning, but he is able to provide an antidote to the chaos. Yet, this time he explains how orde and chaos are intertwined and essential parts of every healthy person. Extremes of both lead to trouble, but a healthy dose of each is needed for an efficient and happy lifestyle.",5,2022/04/12
"This is the continuing book for the highly successful ""12 rules for life"" book by Jordan Peterson.

Jordan Peterson is the breakthrough source for this self-help, get things in order and plan for a wonderful life source of information. When you are done with ""12 rules for life"" move to this one. Both are very good and top sellers. I think this is perfect for those early 20's kids who need some guidance and to set some self boundaries and practices that will help mold their lives for the better. Even those who need a refresher to help them daily - this is a good read.",5,2021/12/31
"I've been following Jordan Peterson for the past 3-4 years by watching a lot of interviews and podcasts featuring him and have become a fan. He calls things like they are, he connects tangbile examples from familiar stories and myths to articulate his points and helps to create a framework for placing us in a historical perspective that allows us to see things from a broader view. I particularly enjoyed the stories he shared from his clinical practice as they were very deep and memorable. He illustrated several points that he continues to come back to in his podcasts in further depth and even if you don't agree with everything he says, it will force you to examine things in a different light. I also enjoyed him sharing some of the details of his personal struggles as it also helped make the book different and enjoyable. Highly recommend to fans of Peterson and anyone else!",5,2021/07/17
"It is delightful to see that Jordan Peterson is back on his feet after two years of chaos (health problems of himself and his family). This book, continues the line of conversation in the previous book (12 Rules for Life) and offers moral and scientific explanations of why focusing on individual and avoiding playing victim is the best way to proceed. And why post-modernism, Wokism, identity politics and Marxism are a danger to civilization as we know it and why we are doomed to end up with everyone being worse off, if these ideologies and their social media mob keep attacking precious values like freedom of speech and individual responsibility. I hope his ideas will spread fast enough to save us from this unfortunate trend of the past decades which has rapidly destroyed family structure and has made men weak, women unhappy and children confused.
I hope we will see more presence from him in both writing and on screen and he will further shed light on and call out extremists on both right and left.",5,2021/03/09
"While there is overlap of the two subjects in both books, Beyond Order seeks to solve the issue of too much structure in life (as opposed to too much chaos, as was addressed by 12 Rules for Life). Peterson delivers on that goal through a philosophical and theological defense . As someone who temperamentally tends towards structure more than chaos, I personally found this book more instructive and useful than the first.

Fair bit of warning: this book is more complex and abstract than 12 Rules for Life. It's difficultly lies somewhere between 12 Rules for Life and Maps of Meaning (a very abstract book). Additionally, Beyond Order seemed to be a bit less polished at time. JBP painstakingly simplified many of the ideas in 12 Rules for Life, and it seems as though he didn't take as much time simplifying many of his ideas in this one. Still, this changed the way I think about ideology itself, creative endeavors, and the importance of beauty.

Strongly Recommend!",5,2021/03/11
"Dr. Peterson wrote this book while recovering from a personal and medical crisis, and you can kind of tell. His points aren't as cogent and linear as they are in 12 rules. That said there's still treasure here, maybe even deeper thinking due to his exploration of the unknown. If you're a Peterson fan, it's a must read and a helpful expansion of his ideas on taking responsibility and forsaking the demons of resentment in all their virtuous disguises. Very glad to have it on my shelf",4,2021/12/15
"I enjoyed it more than the first book by Jordan Peterson. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a better book though. But I love it and recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their life or finds interest in human improvement (in a general sense).

P.S. People are commenting about how he made this book to just make money and sell more. They might be right for all I know. But they do not realize that Peterson is taking these rules from a list of 42 that he made up years ago. He might write another book and a half and I still wouldn't say he is just writing these books to make more money. He wrote these 42 ""rules"" in a Quora answer to the question ""What are the most valuable things everyone should know?"" I highly recommend checking that out.",5,2021/07/15
As for the movies is hard to follow the awesomeness of the first book in the series. Nevertheless Dr. Peterson brings rules that will make people enjoy inspiring lives.,4,2022/03/05
"I'm biased in my review as I love Jordan Peterson's content. His content is always a delightful and powerful learning experience for the mind that wishes to learn something new.

"This book was just as insightful, if not more insightful, than 12 Rules for Life. I am relieved to hear the Peterson family survived the health catastrophes they faced in the last couple years. I don't see anyone else shedding light on the importance of truly good virtues, such as responsibility, honesty, courage, gratitude, and humility, to the extent that Dr. Peterson does. Western society has fallen into the trap of blaming external structures for all problems, leaving a large void in the realm of personal responsibility, which Dr. Peterson is single-handedly filling with his work to the greatest extent possible. This book, paired with 12 Rules for Life, makes for the ultimate guide to navigating the darkness of the world to find the light. I hope Dr. Peterson continues to live a healthy life for many more years so that the world can continue to be blessed with his brilliance.",5,2021/03/27
"A perfect add on to his ""12 Rules for Life"". I read it in one day - consuming it like a pint of Cherry Garcia ice cream after a long fast!

Now am going back through again, to really digest the wisdom behind the words. I am taking notes and looking at ways to make his words become action in my daily life. His first book, in its common-sense simplicity (CLEAN YOUR ROOM before you try to change the world) helped me focus on what is important, how to be more empathetic, and of higher service to my community through efficient use of my resources. This one is filled with nuggets equally helpful.

What a blessing to have him back, and how remarkable to see what he could produce while he was going through such horrible health issues.

Highly recommended read.",5,2021/03/14
"I admit that I have only read the 1st rule so far, but that is because one must only read a couple of paragraphs before stopping to ""grok"" what he has written. This is not a fast read. I have at least one highlight in every paragraph.

Rule #1 is ""Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement."" He states that social institutions and hierarchies are created over a period of time to efficiently solve various problems. As such, they should not be attacked carelessly.

On the other hand, these institutions exist in a world where the environment is complex and changing and they often become corrupt. Therefore it takes creative people to take the risk to break the rules for a higher moral purpose. However, this must not be done carelessly.

This first chapter is worth the price of the book many times over.",5,2021/03/16
"Through countless (hundreds if not thousands) of interviews, articles, debates and discussions over the past five years (with an extended health-related break in between), Peterson has sharpened his positions to where no reasonable objections present themselves. This is the value of speaking to people who disagree with you in an intellectual (and not mindlessly ideological) manner. The advice is perhaps more useful than the first book, because I genuinely believe that we live in a time of excess order where creativity and original thought is stifled in the name of promoting ideological causes based on a faux empathy. A new sort of orthodoxy has replaced traditional religion as Nietzche predicted. Ironically, the new orthodoxy is more rigid and less forgiving than the Judeo-Christian system to which it stands in opposition. I can’t recommend this (or Peterson’s first book) enough.",5,2021/04/08
"You can't go wrong with anything written by this dedicated hero of truth. Read 12 Rules for Life first, it will be life changing for many people. For me, I have to read his books slowly to absorb the depth of the meaning contained in the words, it's kinda like diving deep into a religious text, yet his writing style keeps the content accessible to the average person such as myself.",5,2022/01/26
"This is a book that can give repeated guidance and impact you at different moments in life. It will stand the test of time.
Well done.",5,2022/05/04
"At the end of the book, I was grateful for Being and the struggle to live in closer to the ideal of love, truth, and nobility. At first I was appalled and disgusted by the grunge press coverage and two negative reviews on Amazon. Nothing in the book I found to rise to that level of disgust. I tried to find solace in the rational, the wise, and the difficult discussions about the book. In that struggle, the negative and nakedly bias (bordering on ignorance, hostility, and intolerance) views no longer held a sway. They melted because they failed to present anything that is not flat or stale or new. I hope they will keep trying to bring new ideas up and engage in a conversation that is intentionally designed to elevate all of us not just some ego-infested view point.",5,2021/03/04
"This, along with Peterson’s other books, isn’t a book that you can power through and expect to glean significant insights from.
This book needs to be enjoyed slowly, studied almost line-by-line, I find myself taking many notes as I read through. Underlining important concepts and cross-referencing points, threading the narrative together.
It’s better to read a chapter slowly and thoroughly and meditate on it for perhaps a few days maybe even a week. The ideas and concepts presented are deep and will require you to take the time to digest them, think them through, challenge them and discuss them with others.
I would argue anybody that has already finished the book should do themselves a service and read it again but this time with purpose, slow down, take notes, work the rules into your life. And clean your room!",5,2021/03/04
This book needs to be read again and again and then it reveals many hidden stories of life.,5,2022/05/12
"People tend to bash on peterson for making a second book, I think that it only makes sense to add 12 more rules since, in his original list there were even more than 24 rules. I also feel that the rules are also talked about in his lectures and interviews, meaning that he does have a passion and reason to write them in an extra book.",5,2022/01/13
"Years of clinical expertise are brought to bear on the universal struggle to find meaning in an existence plagued by suffering, an existence which, due to this suffering, also provides the opportunity to fully exist in a state of responsible adaptation. The case is made for perceiving the truth in the darkest reaches of one's own psyche as well as in the viewpoints of those with whom poltical preference may differ. In short, evil is shown to illuminate the presence of good, and the contrast of the liberal versus conservative perspective is shown to illuminate the more inclusive reality of the human social structure. Political, social, and psychological progress are shown to materialize for the individual willing to embrace the challenge of 21st Century reality with a degree of Biblical fortitude.",5,2021/03/22
"I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. It is a great source of practical wisdom and insight into the reality of life. Personally it has helped me view the world in more realistically. It has helped me make more sense of the suffering and personal responsibility that one needs to embrace daily and the necessity of it. In other words, It has helped me understand more that meaning and joy is found by one taking up their cross daily.",5,2021/12/01
Profoundly insightful. Crystallizes the noble aspects of our consciousness such that we may wield them more effectively against the struggles of our lives. Highly recommend,5,2022/04/22
I am a counselor and this book was recommended to me by a colleague. I really enjoyed it and have implanted things from it in my own life as well as my work. I plan on continuing to read this periodically because it's not a one-and-done. You can keep pulling things from it.,5,2022/01/31
"As an avid reader, this is the only book review I've ever written. For anyone willing to do the work to apply the rules laid out in this book, the doors that lead to a renewed vigor and upgraded experience of life will be blown open. Seriously. Read a section, and if you earmarked the page, or, as I often did, jumped up off my couch and walked around my living room saying ""what the hell, wow,"" then put the book down and write about that section. Examine your life against the book and do the damn work. This isn't a book you want to blow through in a week. It's a book you want to treat as you would a holy book, with careful introspection. Bless Jordan Peterson. I'd recommend this book to anyone.",5,2021/03/10
I read his last book and enjoy his insights. He is brilliant.,5,2022/05/10
"Jordan peterson is a prolific professor and author. He has a style comparing different literatures and incorporating his clinical practice experience. His practical advice is the best part of the book particularly when he provides examples from his practice. I enjoyed his analogies with stories from ancient myths and current movies, however it seems he overemphasized the meaning behind certain pop culture. The book becomes complex when he goes around pure abstract concepts, but this complexity might be only my perception as my first language is not English and my language is more advanced in other scientific fields that are neither philosophy nor history.",4,2021/06/29
"I came away understanding myself and others in ways I hadn't before.

Thank you(!) Jordan.",5,2022/04/20
"It is very good book. It makes you think of your own life, experience and the people that you love and care. The author is heavy on moral positions, bible passages and judeo christian points of views but it helps to build his arguments He takes a conservative point of view on many topics but explores and explains why the counter argument is less valid, even calling it a matter of biological endowment “how we view life”. You do not need to share all his points of view just think about them, your reality and experience to make them yours. It has a very good overview of how society, philosophical and psychology interact and help build the world we struggle to live in.",5,2021/03/14
Another good book from JBP. It wasn't as good as the first 12 rules but still a great read from start to finish.,5,2022/04/04
"Contrary to what the main stream media says about Dr Peterson, Beyond Order and his prior 12 Rules for Life have been for me and many others within my circle a guiding light. As you read either you’ll find yourself experiencing ah ha moments. And what I mean by that is, Dr Peterson articulates something that you’ve intuitively known to be true but you could not put that intuition into words. Dr Peterson has found those words for you and brought them out to the light of day. So buy both books and find the time to quietly read and contemplate the application of his writings, you’ll be the better for it.",5,2021/04/14
"I enjoyed this as I did the last one. Both books stand on their own and though they build on each other neither is a prerequisite to enjoy the other.

One of the positive externalities of reading this book is a noticeably happier home life. Having a foundation for sorting my thoughts and putting order to the world around me, makes the world around me less chaotic. My children, far too young, and my wife, far too busy, have read this book but they have all benefited from it.

It’s troubling to me that the contents of a book like this are regarded as controversial, read it and let me know what I’m missing.",5,2021/03/20
"I think Dr. Jordan Peterson's lectures on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche were taken to heart. He internalized the idea that we need a new, ideological framework to bolster individualist and increasingly secular Western Civilization. He had a rough idea of this in ""12 Rules for Life"" but pulled in as much science as history and personal anecdotes.
""Beyond Order"" distills ideas from ""12 Rules for Life"" and focuses itself on the ideological foundation for individualism in the form of personal responsibility and classic Western civilization as a whole.
This is a must-read book. And it can be read without reading ""12 Rules for Life"".",5,2021/05/24
"I’m a fan of Peterson from his previous book “Antidote to Chaos”, a text that changed my life permanently for the better. Regardless, because I liked the first book so much I was worried this one would be underwhelming in its significance but after reading it that couldn’t be further from the truth. Peterson takes the ideas he’s mentioned before and goes 10 stories down to their basements. If you liked the first one, you’ll like this one, and if you didn’t like 12 rules for life, this one could possibly win you over because he took seriously a lot of the criticism from his last book and improved tremendously. Great read, especially out loud.",5,2021/03/05
"It's nice that the intellectual still lives. I wish more people younger than Gen X could grasp such knowledge. Jordan's ability to masterfully intertwine literature, the arts, politics and collective culture is amazing. The substance here makes this book one that can read and re-read time and again. Unfortunately, much of this is not appreciated by the larger masses who get their news and base their lives on BS like CNN and binge watching false,anger-fueling documentaries. Thank you, Jordan. Time to re-read.",5,2021/09/15
I purchased the paperback which is quite expensive at over $26. It's a smaller than average sized paperback and the print is small and somewhat faded. I think it's been mass produced without the original publishers knowledge. It's going back,2,2022/12/09

"I started reading yesterday and I felt the tone of this book was different from the first. The first I found to have more humor and light-heartedness to it. The first book also had deep serious questions to it and it felt like it was my dad talking to me. Beyond order starts out with Jordan speaking about all the hardships him and his family has endured. This book, to me, has more of a feeling of getting through the darkness even after you have set yourself straight. I am very interested in getting through Beyond Order to see how it builds upon 12 Rules for Life.",5,2021/03/04
"Beyond order is a little more cerebral than 12 Rules which was an easy-to-understand fire hose of practical advice. Beyond order takes time to develop the concept that too much order leads to being unable to appreciate beauty and life.
What I appreciate about the book is how much it made me appreciate the heroic and noble part of existence and how-to stand up to suffering and malevolence. I also better appreciate the horror of resentment, deceit, and arrogance. And finally what the highest goal in life is and how to use it to conquer the horror of life.",5,2021/03/31
"It is unthinkable. It's been less than a week since I finished reading this book and I can already see the good impact that the rules have had in my everyday life. Besides the good impact, I really enjoyed reading it and it had some very interesting stories from the Dr's work and life. This book is beautiful, just as the first one. BEYOND order, is really BEYOND beautiful.
Read the book and once you finish it, reflect and after a few days come back and if any of you don't like it, I give you your money back. 😉 (just joking)",5,2021/03/10
"How to be a Hero
Professor Peterson worked on this book while he and those dearest to him were suffering potentially terminal illnesses. Having meaningful work to do helped him to overcome the stresses of his situation.
The book looks at many areas of life where we can work to make things better for ourselves and those around us. He bases his advice on his experiences as a psychologist, educator and parent. Our personalities develop through our interaction with others and living in community shapes our sense of right and wrong. We learn that playing fairly is more important than mere victory, he says.
The art and literature created over the millennia tell us how those before us dealt with life’s hardships but also wake us to what life can offer to offset those hardships.",4,2021/03/29
"Actually reading books for me is a bit rare. Reviewing them is even more rare (I think this is the first.) I’d rather listen to books because I can consume them faster. This book is worth the time to read carefully, as are his others as well. The amount of dedication he puts into his work is something to really see for yourself. There are plenty of books out there that can change your thinking, or even paths in life, this is one of them in my opinion.",5,2021/07/21
"I discovered Dr Peterson a few years ago with his lectures. Upon searching for more and purchasing his previous book I thought I understood his wisdom. His teachings improved my character and simplified my life. I pre-purchased this book not expecting new approaches. After reading just 26 pages, to my astonishment found new powerful nuggets. This is another important book. In my view, already an essential read. Looking forward to more study using this book as a guide to gain more wisdom. What a gift among many Dr Peterson gave us.",5,2021/03/18
"Si excited to finally receive this book which I pre-ordered.
I read 12 Rules for life and gained a lot of insight that helped me w personal growth. I recommended to my nieces and nephews (teens) and they liked it and said they also gained new perspectives on societal issues upon further research on Dr. Peterson.
I’m so excited to read this one. I’ve been so busy since yesterday I’ve literally haven’t had time to start reading it. I want to really sit down for a good hour or so uninterrupted! Hopefully in the next couple of days.Can’t wait!",5,2021/03/03
"However definitely less to the point than the first book in this series. The reader can tell he struggled to write this book and feel good about it. At the time of him writing this, his focus was on tragedies in his personal life so I cannot take away a star from my review. He suffered, almost died, his wife almost died and he wrote a book that fits between his other two books in quality.",5,2021/08/14
"This is a book for everyone. All his books are for everyone! I'm a mom of three young adults who thinks the world of this author and his wonderful family. I have this book in hardcopy from Amazon and also Audible. I enjoy Dr Peterson's lectures and messages.
I first came across him on YouTube. I agree with him 100%. He has great courage, integrity and intelligence. The pictures by Juliette Fogra are exquisite! My favorite chapter is #8 Try to make one room as beautiful as possible. Check out his self-authoring program too!",5,2021/04/03

"Another necessary and brilliant book by the intellectual powerhouse that is Dr. Jordan B Peterson. Our world culture is in tumultuous times. Life expectancy is going down. Power and resources are rapidly accumulating in the hands of fewer and fewer people. States have a monopoly on violence. Technology is growing exponentially. If we are going to survive, or dare I say, thrive, we need to remember the hard-won wisdom of the past, and Jordan is doing his damndest to equip us with the tools required to help confront this chaos and turn it into habitable order.",5,2021/03/24
"Blessed is the book that upon turning the last page you lament its brevity. This one, and its mate, consistently thread the line that runs between the ""thou shalt nots"" and the ""blessed bes"", that ideal of human operation that produces meaning, showing as it goes how meaning is the palliative for suffering, which, like love, runs through all of human existence. After over two hundred lecture hours and three books, this good man's world is home to me. I pray for him and his family, that they may abide among us as family.",5,2021/04/13
Book was I great condition and a good read!,5,2022/03/19
"Jordan Peterson doesn't tell you what to do. He helps you understand, think critically, and act responsibly. This is a labor of love. JBP has worked diligently over his career to help others, and make the proper connections between philosophy, scientific studies, nature, religion, and phycology. He has no agenda other than to uncover the goodness in people, and reveal the truth of the world. Give this a chance if you've read his first book already. It expands upon the wise foundation he presented previously.",5,2021/05/18
"This book lifts the heart up. In many of the chapters I could almost feel myself becoming a more whole person as I was reading it. Reading this will almost certainly make you a better person, no matter where you are today.

I am very grateful for this man. I really do believe he is sort of refounding western civilization, and it couldnt have come at a better time.",5,2021/08/19
"Dr. Peterson once again nails it with this most recent collection of writings. Much of what he writes is already common knowledge that most people know, but his ability to dive deeper and speak on these points with analogies is what is so special. It’s nothing short of a blessing to be alive during the same time that he is.

To the cry babies that misunderstand him, usually purposely: He is more successful than you’ll ever be, and the reasons why are written in this book and his first 12 rules. The irony is really quite stunning.",5,2021/03/03
"Never really know where Jordan Peterson is going to go next, there's always an interesting new idea that I've never considered before. It's a bit of a heavy read and better suited for people who prefer deep and complex philosophy over silly pop psychology.",5,2021/11/08
"Peterson’s wisdom is vital nutrients for the hungry of those wanting to make sense of their lives. This book offers more thoughts to ponder on, and actions to take to make your life more meaningful by accepting responsibility to become more content; to hopefully become more competent and to make the world a better place; To flourish and become the superhero adult that everyone can count on and admire; To ease your own suffering and your fellow mans. May this book bless you as it has myself.",5,2021/04/22
"Read in tandem with the original 12 rules, you shouldn't be disappointed. Though this book does read a little differently than the first, it seems necessary for the elaboration he goes into on subjects mentioned in the original. A fine addition to my bookshelf that I'll be re-reading many times.",5,2021/10/12
"I bought this book drawn to the premise of understanding true ""order"" in the world of chaos, but I acknowledge my negative bias towards Jordan Peterson given various public arguments he has made. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, Jordan Peterson does make well rounded points in the first 5-6 chapters regarding personal traits that are intriguing to consider introspectively or to those you know. Through about the middle to latter half of the book, JBP starts making some debatable points around gender roles and politics... not what one looks for in a self-help book. Self-help is self-help, not taking the turn onto the road of political and societal debate. Lastly, JBP references the ""wrongs of ""-isms,"" dismissing socialism, communism, etc... whether you agree with his arguments or not, this was not applicable to the overall topic of the book.",2,2022/05/20
"Buy this book.
Read it slowly and carefully.
Digest it, understand, and live it!

Then, if you have not done so already, buy his other book, “12 Rules For Life”, and do the same. It will truly help you lead a better life.

Finally, if you have teenage children or kids in college, do everything in your power to get them to read this book and 12 Rules. These books are the “Vaccine For Leftism”.

I can’t recommend this book highly enough. God bless Dr. Peterson.",5,2021/03/05
"I can't say whether or not it is better than the first but it is terrific in its own right. The first two chapters deal great rules but the chapters themselves are not his best work (IMO) but the remainder of the book was coherent, logical, and full of the practical and substantive material that Peterson delivers. He is a voice of reason amidst the crazy and often illogical times we live in.

Get it, read it, and reference it as needed.",5,2021/04/07
Just got my book with a dent and a glass ring stain! I though I was getting a brand new book!,3,2022/07/21
"I read Mr Peterson's first book and now this one. Both books are a must read, in my humble opinion. In this time where 'identity' politics, social blaming, attacking and cowardice are becoming the 'norm' of excepted behavior, Mr. Peterson's thorough, detailed call to courageous self-reflection, personal responsibility and the responsibility that comes with being truthful with oneself and your place and actions in this world is a much needed buttress against the 'noise' of mainstream media, politicians and the various societal groups fighting over power and influence.",5,2021/03/24
"Love this book more than the first one. I think Jordan Peterson write this book in a better state of mind and it really shows in its clarity and structure of this book compared to the last. If you had trouble reading through the first and understanding it, try this book instead",5,2021/09/19
The first book improved my life significantly. This one pushed me even further in a positive direction. Well done. I'd say this book is better than the first.,5,2022/01/03
"This book expands on many themes from the first twelve rules but with more of an emphasis on the creative and relationships side. Ideas are presented in several ways with the intention, I guess, of appealing to the different ways we all think and view things; though I sometimes felt like saying OK I've got it.
I particularly enjoyed the examples of actual cases from Dr Petersons clinical days and from his own family.
He's a real treasure and so is the book.",5,2021/03/20
Another Home Run by Jordan Peterson! I especially like the Biblical quotes and references in this book. This addition allows for exposure and the contemplation of a deeper psychology and formation of solutions to problems we as individuals face. Sometimes when reading you wonder where he is going but near the end of each chapter you find what he said previously converges much like a climatic moment in a story. I will save both books for my daughter when she is older.,5,2021/03/08
"As a fan of his on Youtube, this book delivers in the classic Jordan Peterson fashion, ...in your face with truth expressed in his unique delivery system, facts, experience and the blessing of the great people in history.

There is definitely a new path with this book though, It melds psychology with philosophy and illustrated his points with amazing art work. The perfect blending of the Arts and Sciences.",5,2021/07/26

"Great follow-up to Beyond Chaos.
It is definitely best to read that first.",5,2022/02/14

"Jordan Peterson hit another home run with this book! I loved 12 Rules for Life and this 12 MORE Rules for Life went deeper and blew my mind even further! Loved it! I will say, you should get the audio version. Jordan narrates and it’s very different hearing the words come straight from his mouth.

Definitely would recommend all of his books!

"As most sequels, this book is good, but not great. For me, it faded in comparison with the original “12 rules,” which I considered outstanding.

I doubt, however, that you will share this copy with family and friends (as I did with the original book).",4,2021/04/29

Peterson brings it!",5,2021/07/12

"Dear Jordan,

I love your first book ""12 rules for life"" because you wrote with passion and vigor. You inspire and change many lives. I bought your 2nd book ""Beyond order"" and is disappointed by its hurried writing style and its most of repetitive ordinary content. The only extraordinary sentences I found is on p. 137-p.138:
""What calls you out into the world, however-to your destiny-is not ease. It is struggle and strife. It is bitter contention and the delay play of the opposites. It is probable-inevitable-that the adventure of your life will frustrate and disappoint and unsettle you, as you heed the call of conscience and shoulder your responsibility and endeavor to set yourself and the world right. But that is where the deep meaning that orients you and shelters you is to be found. That is where things will line up for you; where things that have been scattered apart and broken will come together; where purpose will manifest itself; where what is proper and good will be supported and what is weak and resentful and arrogant and destructive will be defeated. That is where the life that is worth living is to be eternally found-and where you can find it, personally, if only you are willing and (with deliberation-my words.)""

With 400 pages, You can save people so much time and money by writing a pamphlet called ""12 more rules for life.""

A smart capitalist must live up to its name by bringing equal value to his audiences/customers. Wishing you the best, as always.

Still love you and your family from New York city;-)",2,2021/03/14
I loved his focus on nobility and voluntarily taking on responsibility as an antidote to suffering. To be thankful in the midst of suffering is to surely choose the higher path. I'm so glad that Jordan and his family have survived their intense trial intact. He has helped so many people and is a much needed blaze of wisdom in the dark.,5,2021/05/07
Peterson is one of my favorite lectures to watch and listen to. Really enjoyed reading this book.,5,2022/01/03
"After just reading the overture, I can already tell that this book has more weight and emotion between the lines.
Knowing the story behind what Dr. Peterson and his family have gone through this past year makes this book feel alive and more personal than any other book I’ve read.
It’s a great privilege to experience the life altering messages this book presents.
This book is worth much more than money!",5,2021/03/03
"""Abandon Ideology"" Pg 176. ""This is a terrible trap: Once the source of evil has been identified, it becomes the duty of the righteous to eradicate it.

You can get alot out of this book if you are open to learn.,5,2022/01/09
Absolutely amazing sequel to the first book. Recommend this to anyone but especially for those seeking any sort of inspiration or motivation or just to gather a greater understanding of life and why people are the way they are.,5,2021/09/30
"So happy to have a new release from Dr. Peterson. His talks and the information he delves into has helped me so much in terms of pushing beyond feelings of adequacy and self-worth. Consistently showing up for what you want to work towards, and living a coherent, truthful, and meaningful life are such essential ideas that need to be repeated. Thank you, good to have you back JBP.",5,2021/03/05
"A phenomenal ""self help"" book that will make you feel as though you have the tools to go out into the world, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and face life head on. A fantastic sequel, 12 more rules for life is a must read for anyone who enjoyed the original. If you've never read the original ""12 rules for life"" I highly recommend it as well.",5,2021/03/13
"I am 100 pages in and I believe this book is just as good as his previous, if not better. Jordan Peterson is at his finest breaking down the motivations of life through many different avenues of pop culture, movies, multiple different ancient religions, and clinical patients. I understand the duality of life on a different level already. This is a must read self realization/ help book!",5,2021/03/17
"After a year like 2020 how grateful I am after reading the forward from Dr. Peterson and the suffering he along with his family endured. Some how he managed, some how we all managed(hopefully). Not only did he manage but he pull back from oblivion and brought back this amazing book.
Perhaps with the help of the machine elf’s perhaps God.
Thank you for your work Mr. Peterson.",5,2021/03/04
"The book is great! The condition it was in after Amazon shipped it however was bad. NO PLASTIC WRAP for the book, just the small cardboard box that was left out in the rain, leaving the book with wavy, water damaged pages. No damage to the content of the book however I would expect Amazon to protect product during delivery at least in some small ways.",5,2021/03/19
"I purchased this book hoping to read something as interesting as the last one in the series and I did it. The content is meticulously written and you can see the great effort that Peterson put in it.
I hope that many of his content continue to rise in popularity and getting to young people who really need to listen/read his message.",5,2021/05/18
"Every one on our planet needs to read Jordans books! So much heart in that man. I feel like he is throwing himself in the lion's den for us. He would gladly be at home. He is a VERY knowledgeable man with a huge heart!
Butt that you will ever see this but thank you Jordan for all you have done.",5,2021/04/19
"I haven't finished the book, in fact I've basically just started - I will update the review when I finish. But I felt the need to let people know that this book is both written a bit clearer and is so far much more pointed. I am either a much better reader than I was or Peterson has taken note and improved. The latter is more likely.",5,2021/03/03
"Jordan Peterson is a world treasure. I’ve just finished reading the second of his “Rules” books. This latest offering is remarkably faithful to understanding the universal human struggle, and another graceful offering for examining its causes and links. We are blessed to have Jordan Peterson here with us and offering timeless insights. Thank You, Dr. Peterson, for Beyond Order:12 More Rules for Life.",5,2021/03/17
"Dr. Peterson shines again. I cannot relate to a public figure more than him. Peterson is a simple man who has been through a lot, and he tries to find ways to ameliorate suffering for others. Do not think that he is looking down on people and telling them how to live, he's learning with us on how to cope with the cruelty of the world.",5,2021/03/03
Highly recommend this for anyone that wants to think about themselves and their choices honestly and ponder ideas.,5,2021/12/20
I heard a Jordan Peterson lecture and decided to get his books. This is his third & follows 12 Rules of Life. You don’t have to agree with everything a writer writes to appreciate their work. He is admired because he speaks in a way people can understand. Incredibly insightful.,5,2021/08/08
"One of the best books I've ever read! Brilliant exploration and a fascinating journey into the human world. Thanks to J. Peterson, a ""map of society"" appears in the mind, according to which the reader can find his own real meaning and own path in life! I will recommend to have and to read both of J. Peterson's books to my friends.",5,2021/03/07
Dr. Peterson did it again. Fantastically written. Thought provoking. 10/10,5,2022/01/19
He has an excellent perspective on women and the feminie in all aspects. I haven't heard it before and I like it.,5,2021/11/23
Package was beat up and cover was somewhat bent nothing crazy but I expected 100%,5,2021/12/20
"Jordan Peterson offer down to earth guidance that doesn't have a bit of woowoo in it. He possesses the wisdom you think a tribe elder would have. And this seems like what our society is longing for. Like the rest of his work, this helped more clearly define the road that i am to be on in my career and personal life.",5,2021/03/21
Maybe I’m just older and connect to the ideas more but I enjoyed this even more than the first 12 rules. Great ideas and practical use to make change right now. Will read again at some point.,5,2021/09/25
"Dr. Peterson does it again. What I loved about this book is how each chapter is unique and different. One chapter you’ll see comparisons of stories that have been told in all of history, the next you’ll be hearing poetry, and then you’ll get a masterful and clear way to view the world that can help reduce suffering. Highly recommend.",5,2021/03/29
"In an age of endless victimhood, it is rare for someone to dismantle the logic of the mob and offer a solution: responsibility.",5,2021/11/11
"Really really enjoyed the book, Has so many things to think about and contemplate -- I highly recommend it.
Now, as Mr. Peterson says he sometimes reads the reviews I'm going to be incredibly picky ... from Rule XI -- in the movie Pinocchio, Monstro does not turn into a fire breathing dragon the whale remains a whale",5,2021/03/22
"It is probably marginally less entertaining than JP's first book, but given how good that was, this one is really a five star read.

Despite all the histrionics, JP's rules for life are actually practical, common sense and reasonable ways to approach the world and your place in it. It will help you make sense of lots of things.

This book is of great value to anyone; even if things are on the rails for you, this book will help you keep them there.

Do future you a favor and read this book.",5,2021/04/15
"A beautiful work. Each chapter is a world in itself. This book is even better than the first 12 rules. I suppose when you have a beast of s book like Maps of Meani g to draw from it is easier to hit a few home runs. Keep cracking at it, Peterson.",5,2021/05/19
"Jordan Peterson has improved the lives of thousands of people, including mine. This book is even better than 12 Rules for Life. I found myself copying entire pages of it in my journal because I wanted to imprint its ideas in my brain. Full of profound wisdom and deep humanity, it shows that JBP has not returned from hell empty-handed.",5,2021/03/13
"I've recently lost somebody very close to me. This book has helped me mentally contextualize their death, what they mean to me, what death itself means to me. That grief is an expression of love. That limitation brings with it an inherent appreciation for accomplishment. Thank you Jordan, the world is a little brighter for having you lived your life.",5,2021/04/16
"Just like the beginning of Avatar the Last Airbender, ""When the world needed him most he vanished."" 2020 was rough while Jordan was returning, but nevertheless, he returned with a book that is needed to the utmost extent in 2020 and beyond. If the world followed these 24 principles, (including the first 12) who knows what we all would accomplish.",5,2021/03/05
It is incredible to get into the mind of someone so profound like Dr. Peterson and being able to extract so much knowledge and understand life a lot more. His bible lecture from and Maps of Meaning lectures have had a profound impact in my life His first book of rules was amazing I can only imagine what wonders await me.,5,2021/03/03
"JBP continues to provide big thoughts which should make you think about yourself and your choices. The book is rather serendipitous, there's not a single idea he is driving, but you should have guessed that from the title. I look at it as a collection of short essays that generally hit really close to home.",5,2021/05/09
"Drawing on his experience as a public intellectual and clinical psychologist, Prof Peterson discusses the principles needed to live a healthy and productive life in modern times. Most persons, whether young or old, working or unemployed, will find the twelve rules in this book immediately practicable and helpful.

While critics often detest Peterson for supposedly reinforcing modern society's power structures, many of his rules are sensible and grounded in compassion, both for oneself and for one's community.",5,2021/06/24
You won’t regret it,5,2022/02/11
"I love this book. A fantastic add-on to his previous book 12 Rules for Life. It's so good to have Jordan back in the public...I missed him while he was gone. Far and away the most thoughtful take on the world as we know it today. Jordan, keep writing and I will keep buying and reading!",5,2021/04/02
"This follow-up book has a more personal tone than his first book and the wisdom of the author is laced in every single page. If you haven't read his first book, go read it, and then immediately read this book. Welcome back Dr. Peterson!",5,2021/03/02
"Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life inspires deep thought and reveals profound truths. As an axiom, one cannot receive profound truths if one does not believe in truth. Therein lies the problem. If one doesn’t believe in truth, then rules are irrelevant. So, I hope Peterson writes 12 Parables for Life.",5,2021/05/26
"This book (and the counterpart) are the best self discovery/help books of our time.  In the 70's we had Dr. Scott Peck and the ""Road Less Traveled"" series of books.  Now we have JP! One of the best psychologists of our time providing mass group therapy via the Internet and these books.  ",5,2021/05/12
"Jordan Peterson’s ability to breakdown the pitfalls of life and then provide an antidote is unique. This book, his second, is in many ways an addition to, and better than the original 12 Rules For Life. Life is chaos, Peterson certainly provides a useful gameplan for navigating that chaos. I highly recommend this book!",5,2021/04/16
So thrilled to have received this book. Currently reading. I waited for the paperback to come out as opposed to the hardcover or audiobook. I wish that the paperback was available at a normal print size. The large print takes some getting used to. But the content is much more important than this one detail.,5,2021/03/24
Thank you,5,2022/02/07
"If anything like the first book, this is determined to be a great enhancement for the tools of the first. Together create and find your antidote to chaos. The real adventure is learning, applying and most like finding it is not a cookie cutter solution for all in the same quest to find meaning and order.",5,2021/03/15
Dr Peterson's book is amazing I got it on tbe 3rd and im already 60 pages in and the amount of information & depth it goes in is of great value. I'm 20 years old and his books has helped me navigate many of life's hardships. The things your parents don't tell you about & school doesn't either.,5,2021/03/03
"Thank you so much for everything. You have no idea what positive things you have done to my life and so many others. I’m forever grateful. I’ve listened to countless lectures, podcasts and now both of your books (I’ll get to maps of meaning before to long as well). I just can’t thank you enough.",5,2021/03/22
"Each chapter is essentially a book in itself; one can absorb the essence of each Rule
per day, chew on it, let it sink through one's personal psyche and then move on.
This is like having a personal therapist to turn to...and a lot cheaper and probably more
effective!",5,2021/05/10
"Ok, it's always annoyed me when people leave a review before they've finished a book, but I can't help myself. I just finished the first chapter on Rule I, and I think it's one of the wisest, most profound, and well-written things I've ever read. I can't wait to see what's comes next!",5,2021/03/07
I bought the Kindle version & I have almost covered every page with yellow highlighting. This book is so wise - a manual on how to live & cope with the fractured world we live in at the moment. I would call this book - an antidote to insanity. This book is a keeper.,5,2021/03/08
Dr. Peterson has been through hell and back. As a Licensed Therapist with an existential worldview. Dr. Peterson continues to be an inspiration for me not only as a clinician but also as an individual who strives to live with conviction and moral character. This book has been an incredible read highly recommend!,5,2021/03/09
"While I like Peterson's previous work, this book just didn't offer much in my opinion. Also the readability is terrible. More words within parentheses than outside parentheses. I had to force myself to finish this book, which is strange, considering his debates and interviews have the opposite effect on me.",3,2021/11/21
"I bought the book more or less out of spite after prof. Peterson was abused by the Sunday Times reporter, but this book is actually excellent and offers very nice insights into living your life in the chaotic world. A worthy successor of 12 rules for life.",5,2021/04/20
"I dont intend to do this book, let alone this man, justice with one amazon book review. So i will submit my 5 stars, and leave it at that. Read this mans book at your advantage, or choose to forgo the wisdom held within, at your peril. I recommend the former.",5,2021/03/16
This book is as good as the first. Dr. Peterson is such an amazing person. I've seen him lecture twice and met him once. He is the very same person that you see in all the videos. Such an intelligent yet down to earth person who truly cares about people.,5,2021/03/12
"While Jordan was recovering, I began studying Jung’s work which gave me a lot of foundational understanding of Jordan’s work. Beyond Order is refined wisdom by an author with overwhelming competence, understanding, and conscious awareness. This book will be healing a lot of resentment in people throughout the years. Incredible.",5,2021/03/16
"Being that 12 Rules was such a runaway success, it was always going to be a hard act to follow, and such is the case. But, it is still a great read that is well thought out and the advice it relays is sorely needed in today’s society.",5,2021/04/06
"I’ve purchased and read both ‘12 rules’ books by Peterson. They are well-written, thoughtful journeys into creating a better person. Any review or opinion that attempts to paint Peterson as misogynistic, racist, alt-right or in any way offensive to reasonable human beings is utter nonsense. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.",5,2021/03/11
"I enjoy the logic and sincerity of Jordan Peterson’s book. From reading 12 More Rules for Life, you can sense his compassion for the reader and his desire to help. I found the book refreshing and inspirational. I believe that it is a self-help book worth reading.",5,2021/03/07
I love this book. I recently discovered Jordan Peterson and also his daughter. Their life experiences and the strength and grace with which they handle their challenges is really helping me as I navigate some extraordinarily difficult health challenges of my own.,5,2021/06/10
"I’ve been following JBP for 6 years and read his first 12 rules which was excellent. I thought a sequel would be hard to keep at the same level of insight and relevance. But this book surpasses expectations, again.",5,2021/07/04
"Never write reviews on Amazon, but for papa Jordan I’ll do anything. Only 3 rules in and my god is this book great. The rule on not hiding in the fog has helped put my existential crisis in check. If you liked the first book you’ll love this one.",5,2021/03/03
"This book is brilliant. I have the audible and kindle versions (gotta get it in)

Peterson is brilliantly insightful taking lessons from his first book and setting up a powerful companion that delivers a dense meal of rules to live by and study",5,2021/05/12
"My grandmother used to tell me liars burn in hell. Peterson makes a compelling argument that this is in fact the case. Lol

In all seriousness thank God and everyone that stood by him during his recovery that he is back.",5,2021/06/03
"Dr. Peterson does it again. A profound source for good in the world. He helped me and many others turn around our lives. For this, I am infinitely grateful. He's not perfect, he has never claimed to be... just another man struggling through life as we all do.",5,2021/03/09
Read it,5,2022/01/01
"Jordan Peterson is a personal hero of mine. His outlook on life is exactly what our world needs more of if we are going to put society back upright.

Buy your copy of this book before Amazon decides to deplatform it and remove it from their shelves!",5,2021/03/05
"Sought out this book to help me progress through life after high school and college.

Listen to his lectures on YouTube for a taste of what this book will be for you. I promise you will be a better person for introducing his work into your life.",5,2021/03/05
"Really learn a lot from this book.
If you are open minded this is a great read .
Would recommend to people looking for order in their life .",4,2021/06/04
"It’s not just a Book written by the “Foremost Mind of the Millennium” it is also the hardcover edition; any lover of Great Works knows the value of a Hardback edition.
Professor Peterson continues to help us negotiate the Semiotics of a New World that is being overrun by a Generation that seeks to destroy the fabric of Western Culture.
Jordan’s gives us the tools to “Counter the Left” and all their minions.",5,2021/04/06
Dr. Peterson’s clarity and insight make this work incredibly valuable in a difficult time. He has turned his own adversity into meaningful lessons we can all benefit from. Dr. Peterson has chosen to show courage and helped to make the world a lot less awful.,5,2021/03/20
The book I received was in excellent condition. Shipping was fast. A good experience.,5,2021/10/16
“Antidote to Chaos” is still the blueprint; “Beyond Order” is an excellent addition to that book. That said I believe that it would be a difficult read for people who have not familiarized themselves with the original that put JP in the spotlight.,5,2021/04/13
This book is a fantastic successor to the already powerful 12 Rules for Life. I’d hate to call it a self help book because in actuality it is an outline of being with a dissection on each rule that ties the opening statement together perfectly.,5,2021/03/14
"Just here to say the Red Skull really knows how to write a truly inspiring/motivational book, who knew getting your own life in order was more important than blindly following ideologies in a naive attempt to make the world a better place?",5,2021/04/12
"Thanks so much, better than the previous book which thoroughly surprised me. I zipped through it without realizing. I’m a huge JP fan and to have this be better than his previous in my eyes, I was thoroughly pleased.",5,2021/05/08
"I'm a psychotherapist from Regional Australia.

Beyond Order is a huge improvement over Antitode to Chaos (which was itself a brilliant book). Highly recommended. Jordan absolutely exceeded expectations here. If you're on the fence about buying it, definitely buy it.

Also if you're looking for a challenge, consider attempting to tackle his first book ""Maps of Meaning"". It may not be written for the layperson, but your brain will certainly thank you for the exercise!

Glenn Bate BSc(Psych)",5,2021/03/07
"Slightly more profound than his previous work! Although I am a fan of his first book which is more dense, I understand the utility for a
book much more accessible to the public. You can tell he took a bit more time writing this one",5,2021/03/06
"His eloquence and brilliance shines through. In the age of fashionable outrage and oppression, Dr Peterson shines a light into the darkness. If children were taught these principles, what a different society we would have.",5,2021/06/18
A phenomenal followup to his previous book. This is a must read. Lots of great insights and important truths. Dr. Peterson is with out a doubt one of the most profound public intellectuals to date.,5,2021/07/11
I was very glad to puchase the Jordan Peterson books because they are chucked full of knowledge and practicality that most people are not aware of.,5,2021/08/16
A brilliantly articulated continuation of 12 Rules for Life. Doctor Jordan Peterson seems to have an almost bottom less well of knowledge and understand aimed to help the individual make sense of life. We are truly blessed to have him. Definitely recommend!,5,2021/03/22
"Very well written, insightful, and meaningful in a way that can empower the man or woman who reads it and does not want to give in to the nihilism and depression of modern society.",5,2021/06/14
"Absolutely amazing. If today's political hacks weren't trying to push racist ideology in our schools (critical race theory), and ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT THE YOUTH IN OUR COUNTRY, this book would be required reading in our schools.",5,2021/05/31
The coordinated and clumsy loathing of this author is comically depressing. Basic psychological tips for making your life better are not controversial. Embracing symbolism in religion is an interesting concept for the formerly religious or the agnostic/atheist readers out there.,5,2021/04/08
4 stars only because he's so much more educated than me. I'm just a blue collar guy and it can be a bit too verbose for me. Really good stuff though. Thoroughly enjoyed!,4,2021/03/28
Jordan Peterson is a gift of rationality in a irrational time. I highly recommend this book as well as his many online videos.,5,2021/08/22
"Received this book yesterday and read the first 25% last night. Very thought provoking and uplifting. It should be required reading for every university psychology student, if not every student, in the age of mass hysteria and narcissism.",5,2021/03/12
"I had great anticipation for this book after reading Dr. Peterson’s other books and binging all of his lectures. Beyond Order: 12 More Rules For Life does not disappoint, it is so great to see Dr. Peterson’s return in the public world!",5,2021/03/04
Thank you - Dr Peterson - for documenting a detailed framework of rules to help us make sense of an upside down world and navigate the complexities of modern life. Please keep up the great work - the world needs great thinkers like you.,5,2021/03/03
"Don’t hesitate. Buy it. (If it’s your thing 🤓)

Not as good as the first, but still worthy of five stars in my opinion. I couldn’t put it down. I fell asleep a few nights whilst reading it and lost my place. It was a pleasure to reread pages because I couldn’t remember where I was up to!!!",5,2021/06/26
"I have read everything Dr. Peterson has authored and I have watched hours and hours of his online lectures and podcasts. He is one of the greatest intellectuals of our time. Please keep writing and talking to us, Dr. Peterson!",5,2021/03/13

Jordan articulates what the majority of us are thinking but can’t find the right way to say it. Stand up to the crazy culture trends because if you don’t chaos will ensue just as it did a hundred years ago.,5,2021/04/01
"As a follow up to “12 Rules for Life”, Dr Peterson’s “Beyond Order” is a must have book for anyone who follows his work. Incredibly insightful and deeply intellectual Dr Peterson is a voice calling out from the modern day proverbial wilderness!",5,2021/03/03
"Just got the book today and I am already balls deep. JBP does not disappoint yet again. Not an easy read but that's because everything JBP does, requires you to think.....a lot. So far a fantastic follow up to 12 Rules.",5,2021/03/05

"Admittedly I've not finished the book, but support Jordan and wanted to rate it 5 stars anyway, assuming that's how I'll feel when I'm done. He's one of the great thinkers of our time so it's important we listen.",5,2021/03/15
"An excellent and thought provoking read. Such an interesting mix of ethics, psychology, and even religion and mythology. It all ties together beautifully. I feel like this is a guiding light and a bit of a moral compass.",5,2021/03/07
One of the few authors brave enough to stand up to the intolerant woke mob when they cancel and take away livelihoods of people that don’t agree with them lockstep. Sound like a familiar group from the past?,5,2021/03/14

"12 Rules for Life for is a stand alone but I would not read one without the other. I don’t believe one is better than the other, they are both excellent books.",5,2021/05/19

"* I'm reviewing the actual print of both the hard copy as well as the paper back.

The paperback clearly says large print as does the Amazon description. So this one's on me. I am simply writing this in case you are reading the review and missed that part. The large print is rather annoying for me and I suspect for those who can read regular print. It's difficult to read. I will gladly give this copy away and see if I can find a standard print.

The hard copy is the larger book but the print is smaller. I refuse to believe this is unintentional. I appreciate the regular size print of the hard copy but there's so much blank space on the borders of each page it's artistically wasteful. Other books are not like this and I suspect they plan on doing regular size books with regular size print at some point in the future.

It's my hope that someone else comments to this respect so that others know the print really is irritating in both hard copy and paperback. With respect to help books are normally printed.",2,2021/03/17
"This book is a great compliment to his first book and his lecture series. Many of the stories you’ll read here you might have heard before, but put into context they reveal great truths about existence.",5,2021/03/05

This book has further deepened my sense of courage and armed me to travel into the abyss that is the unknown. That is chaos. That is BEYOND ORDER. MUST READ.,5,2021/03/23
"It seems as if our appetite for rules in life is as unending as the cycle of hope and disappointment that these illusory mental constructs engender. We want encapsulated wisdom. Our job is to follow the rules.
If life really worked like that, we would all have a happy life.
The author will have arrived when he is ready to give up on formulas once and for all, except maybe as they apply to routine matters like putting together a piece of furniture.
It is important to understand the dynamics of anything you want to be successful at. But, understanding and following rules are two different things. In living, I am either coming from the mind or from feeling.
If you chose the mind you will end up in anxiety. That is your body telling you that you do not have the conscious ability to deal with the complexity of life, but it does. It is only when you let go, and stop interfering, that you find peace in true control, as you are letting your innate body intelligence perform its role.
It is only when your are willing to take this seeming risk of putting feeling (and the meaning emerging from it) first, that you are playing the game of life and not being played by life.
It’s like he is stuck at the cognitive level and hence all the anxiety.",1,2021/03/18

While the information is a five, the readability is a 2.",3,2021/03/04

DO NOT buy this ""large print"" edition, unless you need it!
The paperback cover is super light and low-quality.
The book becomes exceedingly thick.
The format is quirky and weird, with tons of words separated at the end of the page.",2,2021/10/07

"I'm purely rating the condition of the product received and not the contents of the writing by Dr. Peterson. I purchased the paperback version. This book came with multiple folded pages, and 2 pages weren't even cut correctly and I had to cut them to size myself. I wish I had taken pictures beforehand. The book also appears to have lived in a moist environment in shipping or prior. Not satisfied with the condition.

The print is on the bigger side and bold, and the cover is nice and glossy.",2,2021/03/17

"I'm a HUGE fan of Jordan Peterson. I've been watching him on YouTube for years, from his instructing in the classroom to his guest appearances on Joe Rogan and others. It pains me to say this, but Beyond Order is a rambling, incoherent, meaningless book. His recitation of historical themes does nothing to strengthen his 12 More Rules; if those themes are actually somehow related to the points he's trying to make, the connection is never made. This book would merit two stars from another author, maybe even three. But given Peterson's stunning intellect and insight as expressed in the past, Beyond Order is a bitter disappointment barely worthy of a single star. Despite that I'm still a big fan and wish him only the best.",1,2021/05/11
"The book I purchased is listed as new. But, immediately I noticed two stains on the front cover and that the outside sleeve was bent in several locations and the corner of the book damaged. Opening the book, it went right to a page that had the corner bent down to such an extent it was already ripped. Very displeased to get a damaged book when I purchased a new one.",2,2021/04/14

"After reading mixed reviews I took the chance it was good. Nope it’s the first book I have ever had to return. It’s random rambling of useless stuff, authors stories, recaps of bible versus and nothing solid to follow to understand the point about any rule. You will either love it or hate this book I’d say from the mixed reviews, for me it was worst book.",1,2022/04/21

"Just as a quick disclaimer, I was never a fan of Jordan Peterson.
But there's enough hubbub going around about this book, that I thought it was prudent for me to give it a quick read.
It's extremely repetitive and none of the ""evidence"" he provides actually stacks up.
Worse of all, some of the information he gives is just flat out mathematically impossible to be true.

There are in depth YouTube videos about this if you want to learn more.",1,2021/04/23
"I struggled to page 200 and I am getting Nothing out of this book!
I see no real points in each chapter.
I honestly feel it’s a filler of dribble.
Now this is my first Peterson book so many times people live off what great works they’ve done in the past.
I DONT understand the praised reviews?",1,2021/03/28
Slogging through this tome is quite a task. Be sure you are up to it before you order.,2,2021/05/20
"If there were any ultimate message(s) to be had at all, they were buried ten miles deep by tedious over verbosity, and close to nonsensical rambling. Decided to put this mess to bed after about 100 pages, as it became absolutely intolerable by then.",1,2021/06/13
I haven't read it yet but I paid I good amount for it and I got it the second of March and didn't look more at it. I got to looking at it more and there's glue in between the pages and its making them rip.,1,2021/03/04
Expected more,2,2021/06/23
Bland writing and meandering text,2,2021/04/28
"Do not waste your time on this book. It’s long but the author never gets to the point.

The only useful parts of this book are table of contents and the last paragraph of each chapter.",1,2021/05/03
This is not a cohesive project. The first book was a masterpiece. This is a forced out piece of garbage.,1,2021/12/27
