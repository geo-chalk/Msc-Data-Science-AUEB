"A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat, with heavy firepower, strong armour, and tracks and a powerful engine providing good battlefield maneuverability. The first tanks were designed to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare; in the 2010s, they are a mainstay of modern ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat. Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapon system platforms, mounting a large-calibre cannon in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by mounted machine guns or other weapons. They combine this with heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's weapons, and its propulsion systems, and operational mobility, due to its use of tracks rather than wheels, which allows the tank to move over rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud, and be positioned on the battlefield in advantageous locations. These features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively with fire from their powerful tank gun, and defensively due to their near invulnerability from common firearms and good resistance from heavier weapons, all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations.[1] Fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat, armoured warfare.

The modern tank was the result of a century of development from the first primitive armoured vehicles, due to improvements in technology such as the internal combustion engine, which allowed the rapid movement of heavy armoured vehicles. As a result of these advances, tanks underwent tremendous shifts in capability in the years since their first appearance. Tanks in World War I were developed separately and simultaneously by Great Britain and France as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front. The initial vehicle, nicknamed Little Willie, was constructed at William Foster & Co. in Lincoln, England in 1915, with leading roles played by Major Walter Gordon Wilson who designed the gearbox and hull, and by William Tritton of William Foster and Co., who designed the track plates.[2] This was a prototype of a new design that would become the British Army's Mark I tank, the first tank used in combat in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.[2] The name ""tank"" was adopted by the British during the early stages of their development, as a security measure to conceal their purpose (see etymology). While the British and French built thousands of tanks in World War I, Germany was unconvinced of the tank's potential, and built only twenty.

Tanks of the interwar period evolved into the much larger and more powerful designs of World War II. Important new concepts of armoured warfare were developed; the Soviet Union launched the first mass tank/air attack at Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in August 1939,[3] and later developed the T-34, one of the predecessors of the main battle tank. Less than two weeks later, Germany began their large-scale armoured campaigns that would become known as blitzkrieg (""lightning war"") ‚Äì massed concentrations of tanks combined with motorised and mechanised infantry, artillery and air power designed to break through the enemy front and collapse enemy resistance.

The widespread introduction of high-explosive anti-tank warheads during the second half of World War II led to lightweight infantry-carried anti-tank weapons such as the Panzerfaust, which could destroy some types of tanks. Tanks in the Cold War were designed with these weapons in mind, and led to greatly improved armour types during the 1960s, especially composite armour. Improved engines, transmissions and suspensions allowed tanks of this period to grow larger. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with advances in shell design and aiming technology.

During the Cold War, the main battle tank concept arose and became a key component of modern armies.[4] In the 21st century, with the increasing role of asymmetrical warfare and the end of the Cold War, that also contributed to the increase of cost-effective anti-tank rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) worldwide and its successors, the importance of tanks has waned. Modern tanks seldom operate alone, as they are organized into combined arms units which involve the support of infantry, who may accompany the tanks in infantry fighting vehicles. They are also usually supported by reconnaissance or ground-attack aircraft.[5]",5,2018/01/17
"Let‚Äôs face it, we have all heard the stories of parents finding out their kids have been buying things on Minecraft using their parents bank card, because the parents made the mistake of having their card registered on the PlayStation store. So whether you have learnt your lesson and prefer to do it this way, instead of having your card registered to your playstation store, or you are buying this as a gift for someone else, this is a quick and easy way to purchase credit for the PlayStation store.

In most stores they only stock the ¬£10 or ¬£20 PlayStation gift cards, and even then sometimes it can take multiple trips to multiple different stores, to find one with the value you want. That can take a lot of effort and time, where as you can just purchase them here.

Buying them on Amazon means you have more options regarding the value of the voucher, without the hassle of trawling around looking for one that suits your budget. When you purchase these vouchers, you will get an email to email address you amazon account is registered with, and the digital voucher code will be there. You do not get a physical top up card through the post, just a digital voucher code via email. Once purchased it does not take long at all for the voucher code to come through via email.

I have purchased a few of these in the past and it was always been a fast and efficient process.",5,2022/07/28

"If I could give negative stars I would.

I recently purchased this for a friend's birthday under the assumption that it was a gift voucher, however it seems to be just store credit which comes as a code. Then it turns out that his account is in the Rep. Of Ireland and this voucher is land locked to the UK. Rereading the ad I see this, so when I request a transfer to a card I can use in the ROI I am told ""No Refunds"". I never wanted a refund I just want a usable voucher. Eventually got in contact again with Amazon Customer Support, the first rep just said that it was my fault and left the chat! Finally got back in contact with another rep before being passed over to another. I was told that they could escalate a ticket but that I need to speak with Sony first to get a reference. After what felt like 20 years I finally got through to Sony who said that there was no facility in place to facilitate regional transfer on vouchers and that I need to speak to Amazon. Got back to Amazon, passed around a few times before finally being told that that there was nothing that can be done and to ""take it as feedback"".

Completely Pathetic. As someone who has spent thousands of euro over the years with this site across various accounts and Amazon Prime, this is Pathetic Service from Amazon, I can't justify using the site anymore when there is not even protection for buyers. Completely unused and unusable product still being sold.

This is ridiculous, under the voluntary returns policy you are entitled to return the product within 30 days if it is unused. I understand the vender states ""no refunds"" but again under Amazon policy the seller must provide conditions equal to or exceeding Amazon's policies. I don't understand how one can say ""no refunds"" and just back away. Apparently that this doesn't apply to digital products, whether used or not.

Again reading other users reviews the whole product is a scam. It's advertised like a card but comes in a code, then some codes are completely unusable or broken as if they were stolen. It's as if it's being used for money laundering. I highly recommend removing this product from amazon as it's a total scam, mediocre. I've never had an issue with the site however I can't justify staying if there are no protection for purchases. Not even allowed to use PayPal who seem to actually stand by their users.

Let this be a warning to any user who dares look at this product, if the intended PSN account is not in the UK you will NOT get your money back. If the card is purchased and it turns out to be invalid, you will NOT get your money back. You're out on a limb if you buy this product. I wouldn't be surprised if this review is suppressed or deleted. PSN now have ¬£25 of my money which will probably never be redeemed, Please take my warning before anyone spends what little money they may have on this.",1,2022/03/23

"Bought this today, received the email and code within a few moments.
Have previously purchased digital codes with no issue redeeming them on playstation.

This occasion, attempted to redeem the code and was met with error messages stating ""code already redeemed"", literally tried for an hour to sort it, refused to work..

Contacted Sony, who just refer me back to Amazon, who refer me back to Sony, and eventually Amazon expect me to jump through hoops for them to make an exception to refund it, all for a trivial amount (to amazon that is), not to me, of ¬£10, so currently out of pocket with no working code.

Amazon unwilling to budge to make an exception, so my only hope now is if Sony can find a work around, rather than referring me to Amazon....

Honestly will NEVER buy a digital code from Amazon again, and despite years of being a prime member, will likely cancel my membership over this now.

UPDATE: Amazon did eventually agree (after much persuasive persistence with the webchat), to refund the amount as an Amazon gift card, I bought this same code again and the second attempt worked with no issue, so just be very cautious when purchasing and be prepared to fight your case IF this happens to you‚Ä¶",1,2022/08/06

I really wish I could 5 star this. I'm not even sure it should be 4 starred really. I use to love that I could get wallet top ups straight away to add to my game play being a gamer it helps to have access to quick top ups. You could redeem your voucher codes there and then and it would be done within seconds. Recently it now takes 1hr-3hrs for you to receive the code and sometimes you don't even receive a code or any contact please address this because I want to be able to give this a 5 star as it use to be a really good way to get a quick top up. Only reason I have given it a 4 is because I still want this to be a good/ quick way to top up.,4,2019/11/07

I bought a ¬£10 voucher from Amazon and within minutes I had redeemed the code on PSN and was downloading the game I wanted.
This is arguably the best way to pay for things on the PSN as you don't need to give Sony your card details and it avoids your detail being compromised which happened for a lot of people during the hack of the PSN in 2011.",5,2021/03/26
"I much prefer to purchase these top up codes on amazon than give Sony my payment details. The PlayStation Network has been hacked more than once in the past. I'm not exactly sure what Sony is doing with that Annual PlayStationPlus subscription that costs around ¬£50. It doesn't seem to be going into any decent monthly games so perhaps they should invest it into cyber security.
I also dont purchase a great deal from the Playstation store so when i do want something these are quick and easy to buy.
Im not sure why some people are having trouble with them. I've never had an issue so far, just purchase the voucher and you get the code instantly. Go to the playstation store (I do it on my PS4, not the website) and scroll to the bottom where it says ""Redeem"" and enter your code. Done, takes about 2 minutes max.",4,2019/01/06

All these things indicate that you are buying a physical gift card that will be delivered in the post rather than an email with a code within it.
I had seen these in my local shop but only in multiples of ¬£10 and I wanted a card with ¬£15 on it. The page also shows a picture of the card which looks the same as the ones I had seen in my local store - VERY MISLEADING !!!!!!!!!

Should be simple shouldn't it? But no. After buying it I find it impossible to find where Amazon stores the card number on my Amazon account. So I have to wait for my email to arrive.

"This is the easiest and safest way of adding funds to your psn wallet to buy games, dlc and whatnot . I wanted to buy some dlc for legend of heroes: trails of cold steel. What I normally did was visiting my local supermarket and buy a prepaid psn card, which is normally not the excat value I want, come back home scratch the card and go through the laggy ps3 psn to apply the code and then download.
This time a few minutes after purchasing this card, I received an email from Amazon with a link to the code which took me to PlayStation website; I signed in there, and immediately my code was applied. Instead of going to the laggy ps3 psn, I bought the dlc from playstation store, another login, and added them to the queue and turned on my ps3. Upon starting the game, I found the dlc already downloaded.
I do recommend this method also because putting your debit or credit card is risky as no website is immune to hacking and because you can choose how much credit you want rather than be forced to buy more credit than you really want.",5,2016/11/23

"There isn't exactly a huge amount you can review on these kind of items.

You need ¬£50 on your PlayStation wallet? Then buy this.

I often find that buying credit on the PlayStation store is a pain and sometimes just won't work. Whilst this method introduces a middle man as such it works and therefore can't complain.

Items like this can be bought and a digital code provided in most cases immediately. For some reason unlike when I bought smaller amounts of credit previously this purchase had to do some sort of background verification. This however was done after abouta10 minutes.

If you are stuck thinking of a gift for someone who you know plays PlayStation this isn't a bad idea.

"As a Brit living abroad, it is not possible to make purchases on PSN (as it requires being within the UK and paying with a UK card), so I have often had to resort to 'stocking-up' whenever visiting home. The advent of reliable websites for delivering wallter top-up cards over the last few years has meant I can change my consumer practice when purchasing games. Before using this service on Amazon, I have tried several other sites, which have typically been devlievered to my email box within 1-3 days, altough I have experienced a few problems. In contrast, I have used this service on Amazin three times, and have recieved the code instantly upon payment on each occasion. This has been true when using the service for lower denomination than 35 pounds also.

In conclusion, does exactly what it says on the tin, with no fuss, get it precisely when you want it. Highly recommended as a solution for those with UK registered PSN accounts who are out of the country for whatever reason.",5,2014/03/24

Easy.",5,2020/05/24

"As a Brit living abroad, it is not possible to make purchases on PSN (as it requires being within the UK and paying with a UK card), so I have often had to resort to 'stocking-up' whenever visiting home. The advent of reliable websites for delivering wallter top-up cards over the last few years has meant I can change my consumer practice when purchasing games. Before using this service on Amazon, I have tried several other sites, which have typically been devlievered to my email box within 1-3 days, altough I have experienced a few problems. In contrast, I have used this service on Amazin three times, and have recieved the code instantly upon payment on each occasion. This has been true when using the service for lower denomination than 35 pounds also.

In conclusion, does exactly what it says on the tin, with no fuss, get it precisely when you want it. Highly recommended as a solution for those with UK registered PSN accounts who are out of the country for whatever reason.",5,2014/03/24

"Having received some Amazon vouchers for Christmas I thought I would treat myself. The PlayStation store had some great titles at a very good price so I decided to purchase some PSN credit so that I could grab a bargain. After looking at my options I decided that it would be more practical to buy one ¬£10 voucher rather than two ¬£5 vouchers. Although I only had one item I managed to save time by not having to enter an extra redemption code. The extra time allowed me to download my new game quicker (Battlefield 1).
I am glad I was asked to share my experience of purchasing a ¬£10 PSN voucher as, upon reflection, I made a really wise choice.
I hope this review helps people who have the dilemma of having to choose between two ¬£5 vouchers and a single ¬£10 voucher. Remember, it may be nice to own two items, rather than one, but it will waste your time having to redeem an extra code. Nobody wants to waste time...",5,2017/01/27
My code will not show up,1,2022/12/18
all ok! simple and easy!,5,2022/02/14
"The product itself: It's a code, you can spend ¬£20GBP on the PlayStation Store once it has been activated, this does save onto your account and I don't think there is an expiry date so you could use it on your next few purchases until you have spent ¬£20 or more. The prices on the PS Store do tend to be overpriced, however, when they have a sale you can grab yourself a lot of games - some which are PSN exclusive (no retail copy) - at an affordable price.

Amazon's Service: It can take up to about four hours for you to get the code, if there is a problem Amazon's superb customer service can help you. However, in comparison to competitors this is quite poor with some pricing this at about ¬£17 - ¬£18 with instant delivery.",4,2015/12/25

It asks you for your password twice to make sure it‚Äôs you on the PS4 then asks if you want to add the funds to you wallet you say yes and the relevant amount is added to the wallet ready to purchase games etc on the PS4. So it really does seem to be that quick,fast and efficient. So I would definitely recommend buying the PSN card voucher.

It‚Äôs a shame because I wanted to order a few physical cards for our young gamer as stocking gifts.

To be honest I was a little confused as I thought this was a voucher that would have been delivered as a card but you get a code sent to your email.

"I much prefer using these. I don't trust putting my details on the ps4 anymore after the past hacks so I use these.

But I prefer buying them from Amazon because if you buy one from a physical shop and there's an issue (like it has a used code or hasn't been activated) then you have to go back to that shop to return or replace it. Doing it with Amazon means if there is an issue then you can message amazon while being lazy and laying on your couch. With it being November now and seriously cold, I'd much rather do all of that from my warm house.

Plus you get the code instantly so that just makes life so much easier. I highly recommend using Amazon for these.",5,2016/11/21

"I rarely use wallets for buying download games as once completed you cant sell / trade for other games as it's stuck on your console, but for games that are available in download format only it is worth it, I dare not put credit card / bank details onto a gaming machine so having instant codes available to buy online is great, no waiting for the post, all done and able to play in 5 mins ( or however long it takes to download a game) I would buy again for game DLC's and games that are downloads only.
Can't purchase by mistake due to security asking you to put in your assigned payment method and password, so anyone getting into your amazon account can't buy them so no risk of fraud.... ps4 also asks for password too once you enter the code.",5,2014/02/28

"Bought this to put credit on my PS4 store account. When confirmation email comes from Amazon, there is a link, which takes you to Sony, this lets you sign into you PS4 account. When signed in, you just confirm redeem code, and credit is added to your PS4 account. This system allows you to add credit within minutes of ordering from Amazon. Great if you want to quickly order something from PS4 store. Much easier than old way, of waiting on a card to arrive by post, and having to type in long codes. Very straightforward to use.",5,2018/12/02

"Okay. I bought this. Code was delivered within seconds - great. I entered the code and it failed. I tore my hair out thinking Amazon was at fault. Well, let me tell you, Amazon was NOT at fault and went above and beyond. What happened is this: I moved from the US across to UK, taking with me my PS3 and my PSN account (obviously). The registered country for my account is MA, US. I created a new account based in UK and the code was accepted. There is NO way to change your country on PSN! Sony have made it very, very difficult, and Sony doesn't care because they don't listen. Sony are the problem.

So Amazon still rocks, the codes obtained thru the European site will only work on accounts with European countries, not US. You cannot change your country on PSN (Sony sucks), and what else is interesting, the Playstation Store is differs depending on your PSN account's country. So if you see something you want on a US account, it most likely isn't available in UK!!

I give a 3 star rating because I'd like to give Amazon 5+stars but I give Sony 0-stars.",3,2014/05/31

"Completely forgot that it was my daughters, boyfriends, birthday so this was a quick easy way of getting him something I knew he would like and could be instantly printed out to pop in the card - much better that just giving money as at least I put some thought into it - all being late thought :) Really recommend and easy to purchase and download/use on the play station store.",5,2020/01/15

"With their lax security and constant hacks, I'd trust Zammo with my credit card details before Sony. Despite their atrocious record protecting customer data, they have now decreed that you can't send one off paypal payments to your Sony wallet anymore. You have to give them permission to take money whenever they like. Not happening.

These codes allow you to put money on your Playstation account and protect you from Sony and the hackers. They are instant. Hit the checkout button and you get the code on your screen (if you so choose) and can enter it immediately on the sony account page.

"Pretty straight forward to use, no issues at all.

As the PlayStation Store is about as dependable as a chocolate fire guard, I had to resort to using wallet vouchers when the store, accessed by IE, Chrome AND Firefox, refused to complete the order and blocked me for suspected fraud after three years of having my PS4 and after recently spending over ¬£400 on VR stuff. PS4 store stated wallet was empty when trying to use PayPal and that my credit card details were wrong when trying to use my MasterCard which is valid until 2021! Useless.

Thankfully, I discovered these. Paid for and redeemed in under a minute! As I was signed into my Sony account anyway, it redirected me and redeemed the code immediately. Might use these more often now.",5,2017/07/21

"The PSN card, to me, represents a more secure way of purchasing from PSN or SEN (Sony Entertainment Network) as it is now, especially given the well publicised hacking a couple of years back there's no way I wanted to keep my card details on their servers!
The online game code is definitely the best way to receive this item. When ordered Amazon requested card details to authenticate the purchase then came up with a requirement to verify which may take up to 4 hours. Within 4 minutes I recieved the code via email so overall am very happy with the service.The card is also 15p cheaper than it's face value when purchased this way, no idea why but it all helps!",5,2014/10/07
"Overall, this was the product I was looking for and worked properly. I gave this product 4/5 stars because at the time it was only available as an online code, instead of a gift card. Another problem was that it took 3 hours for the code to be emailed to me, which was inconvenient, but apart from that, it worked perfectly and I could easily add the code and continue to purchase games from the PlayStation store.",4,2017/08/10

This service on Amazon is the best ever code generator as you get them the moment you process the order. It will give it to you on the next screen after processing has finished, as well as sending an email to you as your proof of purchase should it mess up on SONY's end.

Use this way as its brilliant. I don't trust leaving details on the PS3 after the massive detail leak, nor do I trust random PSN voucher sites. Use Amazon and you get everything that you ordered instantly. Fantastic!",5,2014/02/03

Though I'd purchased a gift card. Should have read the description properly. The low score is because of the poor communication on the sellers side. When I realised that I had purchased a code and not a voucher I contacted Amazon to see if I could change the code for a voucher as I wanted it as a christmas gift. It has been nearly 3 weeks and still no reply. So I am now left with a code that I cannot access as I don't have a playstation account. And I can't give anyone else the code because they would have to access my Amazon account to get the code. What a waste of ¬£20.,1,2021/12/01

"Pretty much essential if you want to buy anything off PSN.

Also, it's safer and cheaper if you buy one of these top up cards instead of giving your credit/debit card details to Sony. Safer in that if Sony gets hacked again you won't lose your card details, and cheaper in that if you happen to have kids, they won't rack up a huge bill by purchasing horse amour in your absence. Saves time on phone bills calling Sony to explain as well.

The small print will tell you this is none refundable. What the image of the gift card does not say is that the product is s gift CODE that is emailed to you. Therefore if you are wanting a gift card to give to someone you will not receive it and amazon will not honour this and will ignore any complaint saying this is misleading. You instead will be forced into printing off a personal paper email to give to the person you wanted to gift. Never left a bad review before but pretty disgusting to mislead people.",1,2021/09/02
Its easy to order and get code right away which my Son use on his PlayStation game,5,2021/05/06
"Great as a gift or if you are worried about using your bank details on the PS4 as you can get hacked. I was actually banned from my PS because they took out 19.99 out of my bank for PS PLUS. I thought I got hacked or something and requested a charge back, and obviously PS4 banned me because of the debt. I had to ring up and buy this code so they could put it into my account. It was easy and you get the code straight away after you buy.",5,2017/11/22
"I really wasn‚Äôt sure how this topup card was gonna work out compared to others, but having loaded it into my account, I can confirm it‚Äôs the real deal and does just as good a job of adding credit to your PSN account as other topups. One satisfied customer.",5,2019/12/30

"So like others... I bought a redeemable voucher for playStation for my nephew for christmas, when he tried to use it, a message came back that it was used 12 months previously. Its a scam. Amazon wont do anything, because they're useless. Even though the sold the item they dont claim any responsibility for me not getting what I paid for. They cannot refund you. Contact sony, they dont care what you say. If you get through to Sony support, you deserve a medal alone! AVOID",1,2022/01/19

Excellent was to buy points but it can be confusing when it asks you to enter your credit card details again. I have looked into this and apparently this is to do with international licensing law. The same happens when using Amazon gift vouchers but rest assured it will not take money from your card and only from the voucher (assuming the amount is less that or equal to).,4,2016/05/22
Really easy to use. A simple way to add funds to playsation network.,5,2021/05/03
"Recommended to me by a friend and really is the easiest way to top up the kids PSN account - much easier than messing around with entering my own card details, address etc. Plus I retain absolute control, just top up the account using a pre-paid gift card with no concerns about my children signing on and buying things without my permission. I have bought these cards in the supermarket before now but Amazon is just as easy - once purchased the code is available immediately.",5,2017/06/09

"Came here after countless hours of PSN telling me that my credit card information was invalid which it wasn't they're just extremely pedantic! Anyway, after thinking I could never make a purchase on the store again I arrived here and I must say it is fantastic! Don't be alarmed if your code doesn't come through instantly, Amazon quotes 2-4 hours as a possibility however mine came through within 5 minutes of ordering! Probably the best way of topping up your virtual wallet especially if like me you've decided that Sony are just too incompetent to have you card details! MUST BUY!!!!",5,2014/05/28

"Would much rather purchase PSN credit this way rather than input my credit card details into PSN directly with the PSN being hacked so many times. This is a safe way to purchase items on the PSN without risking your details being stolen. I got my code through just minutes after purchasing so it was fantastic I was able to buy items straight away. You can also get the card delivered to you, if you are giving it as a gift. Very happy with purchase and will use again.",5,2015/05/07

Click - Pay - Enter Code - Download* - Play!

"I don't like having my cards or bank accounts attached to my consoles (XBL and PSN) so these are a great way to purchase off of the PSN store without that risk. I only top up my account when I'm about to buy anything, so even if my account does get hacked, any hackers would only have at most ¬£1-¬£2 rather thank my entire bank account. (Although Sony have since introduced two-step verification, I would still recommend this over linking your bank account).",5,2017/01/06
