# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the projects completed during my Master in Data Science program at AUEB. This repository
contains a collection of projects and assignments from various courses throughout my academic journey. Each project is
organized within its respective folder, making it easy to explore and understand the work I've done.

Each project contains the solution that was submitted, usually consisting of a report along with the code. To respect
the work of the professors, the handouts and data are not included in the repository. In cases where the data is
publicly available, corresponding links for data download are provided.

# Navigation

To explore the projects, you can navigate through the folders corresponding to each course. Each folder is typically
structured as follows:

- `{Project_Name or Assessment_id}/`: Contains the project files, including code, documentation, and any additional
  resources.
- `README.md`: Provides a brief overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running or replicating the
  analysis (if applicable).

The `README.md` also contains information regarding the course (number of projects, final exams, individual/group
projects, etc.). Moreover, the final grade of each course is mentioned. However, please note that this grade represents
the aggregated grade, including the final exam. Most projects received a grade of 10/10, with some exceptions where the
grade was 9.5/10.


# About the program


## Highlights

In this section, I've highlighted some of the best assessments and projects, according to my opinion.

1. **Advanced Customer Analytics**
   - Description: One of the best Courses of the Program, where applications of machine learning in the industry were 
                  demonstrated. The first project was a review summarization where we had the opportunity to scrape, 
                  aggregate, using various techniques (LDA, openai API etc) and plot the results in a PDF
   - Folder: [Advanced Customer Analytics](./Advanced%20Customer%20Analytics) 
   
2. **Recommender Systems**
   - Description: Again one of the best Courses of the Program. The second project could be a real-life project. 
                  A (Beer) Recommender system was used, which produced excellent results, using various techniques. 
   - Folder: [Recommender Systems](./Recommender%20Systems) 
   
3. **Deep Learning**
   - Description: Another excellent course, where we had the chance to dive deep into modern Deep Learning Algorithms 
                  and techniques. The assessments focus on computer vision starting from a simple dataset (Fashion 
                  MNIST) and the expanding to a more complex dataset containing X-RAYS (MURA Dataset)
   - Folder: [Deep Learning](./Deep%20Learning) 
   
4. **Text Analytics**
   - Description: The 4 assessments contain a nice introduction to Deep Learning for Text. Complex models were 
                  built using the building blocks of LMs (GRUSs, (bi)LSTMs, self-attentions etc.). Models were trained 
                  to perfoms various classification tasks.
   - Folder: [Text Analytics](./Text%20Analytics) 

5. **Machine Learning and Computational Techniques**
   - Description: Nice course with a LOT of assessments. The math behind the basic concepts of machine learning was 
                  explored during the assessments.
