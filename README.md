# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the projects completed during my Master in Data Science program at AUEB. This repository
contains a collection of projects and assignments from various courses throughout my academic journey. Each project is
organized within its respective folder, making it easy to explore and understand the work I've done.

Each project contains the solution that was submitted, usually consisting of a report along with the code. To respect
the work of the professors, the handouts and data are not included in the repository. In cases where the data is
publicly available, corresponding links for data download are provided.

# Navigation

To explore the projects, you can navigate through the folders corresponding to each course. Each folder is typically
structured as follows:

- `{Project_Name or Assessment_id}/`: Contains the project files, including code, documentation, and any additional
  resources.
- `README.md`: Provides a brief overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running or replicating the
  analysis (if applicable).

The `README.md` also contains information regarding the course (number of projects, final exams, individual/group
projects, etc.). Moreover, the final grade of each course is mentioned. However, please note that this grade represents
the aggregated grade, including the final exam. Most projects received a grade of 10/10, with some exceptions where the
grade was 9.5/10.

# About the program

## Program review

This section is aimed to provided my honest opinion on the program, which could help future candidates to decide  
whether this master's degree is suited for them. 


- **Part-Time option:**
    - The biggest benefit of the Program is the fact that it offers a Part-Time Option. This is targeted to
      professionals who want to combine studies with work. Although the load is very high, it is manageable and
      well-structured. Provided that there isn't another Master in Data Science in Greece that is truly part-time,
      pursuing the MSc in Data Science in case you are working is a no-brainer.


- **Course quality:**
    - The program exhibits a noticeable course quality. For instance, the "Advanced Customer Analytics"
      course provided a fantastic learning experience, showcasing real-world applications of machine learning.
    - Most courses will introduce new concepts and go into detail. The only downside, is that oftentimes the
      introductory material is repeated. For example, the concepts of classification/regression etc. were covered by
      more than 4 courses.
    - On the downide, some courses fell short of expectations, having an "undergraduate" structure. These courses either
      had hideous exams or bad course material, which was not suited to level of the MSc.


- **Communication with administration is sub-par:**
    - Timely and effective communication with the administration is crucial for a smooth academic experience.
      Unfortunately, we've encountered difficulties in getting our questions answered and obtaining clear information on
      basic information. For example, the academic calendar with available (elective) courses per quarter was never
      announced, thus we could not make a plan for the year.


- **Courses list was announced one week prior to starting the quarter:**
    - Late course announcements can be challenging for students trying to plan their schedules and prepare for
      coursework. In most cases, the quarter schedule (which included the courses list) wasn't announced until a couple
      of days before starting.


- **Overall too expensive:**
    - The cost of education is a critical factor for students, and it's important to ensure that the program offers
      commensurate value. In my opinion, the program was too expensive, especially when comparing the price to other
      public universities across Greece.

## Highlights

In this section, I've highlighted some of the best assessments and projects, according to my opinion.

1. **Advanced Customer Analytics**
    - Description: One of the best Courses of the Program, where applications of machine learning in the industry were
      demonstrated. The first project was a review summarization where we had the opportunity to scrape,
      aggregate, using various techniques (LDA, openai API etc) and plot the results in a PDF
    - Folder: [Advanced Customer Analytics](./Advanced%20Customer%20Analytics)

2. **Recommender Systems**
    - Description: Again one of the best Courses of the Program. The second project could be a real-life project.
      A (Beer) Recommender system was used, which produced excellent results, using various techniques.
    - Folder: [Recommender Systems](./Recommender%20Systems)

3. **Deep Learning**
    - Description: Another excellent course, where we had the chance to dive deep into modern Deep Learning Algorithms
      and techniques. The assessments focus on computer vision starting from a simple dataset (Fashion
      MNIST) and the expanding to a more complex dataset containing X-RAYS (MURA Dataset)
    - Folder: [Deep Learning](./Deep%20Learning)

4. **Text Analytics**
    - Description: The 4 assessments contain a nice introduction to Deep Learning for Text. Complex models were
      built using the building blocks of LMs (GRUSs, (bi)LSTMs, self-attentions etc.). Models were trained
      to perfoms various classification tasks.
    - Folder: [Text Analytics](./Text%20Analytics)

5. **Machine Learning and Computational Techniques**
    - Description: Nice course with a LOT of assessments. The math behind the basic concepts of machine learning was
      explored during the assessments.
    - Folder: [Machine Learning and Computational Techniques](./Machine%20Learning%20and%20Computational%20Techniques)

## Course Order

You may find the order I took the courses in. I have added one or two asterisks next to elective courses as follows:

*Recommended<br>
**Not Recommended

I would suggest to avoid stacking so many courses early on, and take advantage of the final semester, to make the
journey more enjoyable.
